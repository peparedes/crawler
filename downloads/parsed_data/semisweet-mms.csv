(AP) -- If you don't know a stone toter from Adam's off ox, or aren't sure what a grinder shop sells, the Dictionary of American Regional English is for you.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">The collection of regional words and phrases is beloved by linguists and authors and used as a reference in professions as diverse as acting and police work. And now, after five decades of wide-ranging research that sometimes got word-gatherers run out of suspicious small towns, the job is almost finished.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">The dictionary team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is nearing completion of the final volume, covering &quot;S&quot; to &quot;Z.&quot; A new federal grant will help the volume get published next year, joining the first four volumes already in print.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">&quot;It will be a huge milestone,&quot; said editor Joan Houston Hall.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">The dictionary chronicles words and phrases used in distinct regions. Maps show where a subway sandwich might be called a hero or grinder, or where a potluck - as in a potluck dinner or supper - might be called a pitch-in (Indiana) or a scramble (northern Illinois).</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">It's how Americans do talk, not how they should talk.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">&quot;It's one of the great American scholarly activities and people will be reading it for a century learning about the roots of the American language,&quot; said William Safire, who frequently cites the dictionary in his &quot;On Language&quot; column in The New York Times Magazine. &quot;It shows the richness and diversity of our language.&quot;</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Doctors have used it to communicate with patients and investigators have referred to it in efforts to identify criminals, including the Unabomber. Dialect coaches in Hollywood and on Broadway have used the dictionary's audio recordings of regional speakers to train actors.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Author Tom Wolfe has called the dictionary &quot;my favorite reading.&quot;</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">In awarding the two-year, $295,000 grant that will get the final volume into print, National Science Foundation reviewers called the dictionary &quot;one of the most visible public faces of linguistics,&quot; and a &quot;national treasure.&quot;</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">The concept dates to 1889, when the American Dialect Society was formed. But the project did not start in earnest until 1965, when English professor Frederic Cassidy dispatched workers to 1,000 carefully chosen U.S. communities to interview residents and make audio recordings of their speech.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Workers often slept in &quot;word wagons&quot; - vans emblazoned with the UW logo - and even were chased out of a few Southern towns. The field work alone took five years and collected 2.5 million different words and phrases.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Since then, linguists have painstakingly researched the words using print materials to decide which should be included. The dictionary project has about a dozen workers and a $750,000 annual budget.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Cassidy died in 2000, still looking toward publication of the final volume. His tombstone reads: &quot;On to Z!&quot;</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Hall, who has worked at the dictionary since 1975 and been editor since 2000, said the complete series of five volumes published by Harvard University Press will contain about 75,000 entries.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Draft entries for the final volume are still being reviewed. During a recent visit to their offices at UW-Madison's English department, one was tracing the history of the word &quot;stone toter,&quot; a type of fish found in parts of the eastern U.S.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">After the final volume is published, the next phase of the project will be to put the dictionary online. Hall envisions an online edition that will be updated constantly.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Hall said her all-time favorite word is bobbasheely, used in Gulf Coast states as a noun meaning a good friend or a verb to hang around with a friend. It comes from the language of the Choctaw tribes.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Two people interviewed in Texas and Alabama in the 1960s used the word. Further digging revealed that Nobel Prize-winning author William Faulkner had once used it in a novel, and it was used in the early 19th century by a colleague of former vice president and duelist Aaron Burr.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">The dictionary has occasionally been put to serious use.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Forensic linguist Roger Shuy said he occasionally referred to the dictionary when he studied the Unabomber's writings in the 1990s for clues to the writer's identity. His profile didn't help catch Ted Kaczynski, but it turned out to be pretty accurate: He guessed the Unabomber had a doctorate, grew up near Chicago and was older than some investigators initially believed.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Hall said she has uncovered flaws in a test routinely given to diagnose a brain abnormality in which people have difficulty coming up with words for everyday items. The test's answer key does not allow regionalized answers; for instance, referring to a harmonica as a &quot;mouth harp&quot; is counted as a mistake. She hopes to help the authors rewrite the test to avoid misdiagnosis.</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Hall also was sought for help by reporters who didn't understand President Bill Clinton's comment in 1993 that an Air Force official who had criticized him &quot;doesn't know me from Adam's off ox.&quot;</p> <p class=""ap-story-p"">Hall said the phrase is used west of the Appalachians in place of the more popular &quot;he doesn't know me from Adam.&quot; The &quot;off ox&quot; refers to one of the two oxen once used to plow fields.</p></div>"

"event","<br /><lj-cut text=""Museum reveals engraving hidden in Lincoln watch"">By BRETT ZONGKER<br />Associated Press Writer<br /><br />WASHINGTON (AP) -- For nearly 150 years, a story has circulated about a hidden Civil War message engraved inside Abraham Lincoln's pocket watch. On Tuesday, museum curators confirmed it was true. A watchmaker used tiny tools to carefully pry open the antique watch at the National Museum of American History, and a descendant of the engraver read aloud the message from a metal plate underneath the watch face.<br /><br />&quot;Jonathan Dillon April 13 - 1861,&quot; part of the inscription reads, &quot;Fort Sumpter (sic) was attacked by the rebels on the above date.&quot; Another part reads, &quot;Thank God we have a government.&quot;<br /><br />The words were etched in tiny cursive handwriting and filled the the space between tiny screws and gears that jutted through the metal plate. A magnifying glass was required to read them.<br /><br />Jonathan Dillon, then a watchmaker on Pennsylvania Avenue, had Lincoln's watch in his hands when he heard the first shots of the Civil War had been fired in South Carolina. The Irish immigrant later recalled being the only Union sympathizer working at the shop in a divided Washington.<br /><br />Dillon's story was passed down among his family and friends, eventually reaching a New York Times reporter. In a 1906 article in the paper, an 84-year-old Dillon said no one, including Lincoln, ever saw the inscription as far as he knew.<br /><br />Dillon had a fuzzy recollection of what he had engraved. He told the newspaper he had written: &quot;The first gun is fired. Slavery is dead. Thank God we have a president who at least will try.&quot;<br /><br />For years the story went unconfirmed.<br /><br />The watchmaker's great-great grandson, Doug Stiles, first heard the tale of the engraving from his great uncle decades ago. He said the story had reached extended family as far away as Ireland.<br /><br />A few months ago, he used Google to find the New York Times story, and last month he passed the information along to Smithsonian curators, who knew nothing about the engraving.<br /><br />On Tuesday, watchmaker George Thomas, who volunteers at the museum, spent several minutes carefully opening the watch as an audience of reporters and museum workers watched on a video monitor.<br /><br />&quot;The moment of truth has come. Is there or is there not an inscription?&quot; Thomas said, teasing the audience, which gasped when he confirmed it was there. He called Stiles up to read his ancestor's words, drawing smiles and a few sighs of relief.<br /><br />&quot;Like Pearl Harbor or 9/11, this was the reaction he had (to the Civil War,)&quot; Stiles said of the inscription.<br /><br />Later, Stiles said he felt closer to the 16th president.<br /><br />&quot;My gosh, that was Lincoln's watch,&quot; he said, &quot;and my ancestor put graffiti on it!&quot;<br /><br />Lincoln's family kept the watch until it was donated to the museum in 1958. It was Lincoln's everyday pocket watch, one of the president's only valuable possessions he brought with him to the White House from Springfield, Ill., said Harry Rubenstein, curator of the museum's politics and reform division.<br /><br />&quot;I think it just captures a bit of history that can transform you to another time and place,&quot; he said. &quot;It captures the excitement, the hope of a watchmaker in Washington.&quot;<br /><br />The watch will go back on display at the museum by Wednesday as part of the exhibit, &quot;Abraham Lincoln: An Extraordinary Life.&quot; It will have a new label to tell Dillon's story and a photo of the inscription.<br /><br />---<br /><br />On the Net:<br /><br />National Museum of American History: http://americanhistory.si.edu/</lj-cut>"

"event","Okay, I love church.  This is why I'm going to be a pastor, partially.  But seriously.  There is such a thing as too much of a good thing.

We left at 10am today (ish, we're on Indian time) to go to church.  It's now 10:01pm, and I've only been home for about 15 minutes.  Two church services, radically different, in towns more than 2 hours' drive from each other.  Potluck fare after both.  I am exhausted, bloaty (the food wasn't very good, especially after the second one), cranky, tired of bad roads, tired of the lack of privacy (ironic thing to put on a public journal, I know), tired of being in close quarters with people, and tired of having nothing to do but hurry up and sit.

Hugs and kisses to everyone, I'm going to bed as soon as I finish talking to my husband."

"event","Today, it snowed.  It was a drastic change from the 55+ weather we'd been having.

Didn't do much interaction today, just kind of listened to people talk at us.  One thing that we did was hear a speaker from <a href=""http://www.lakotafunds.org/"">Lakota Funds</a>, which I thought was a novel concept, but maybe I'm just sheltered.  We also visited <a href=""http://www.olc.edu/"">Oglala Lakota College</a>, which was less impressive, I think, than if we had actually met any students or interacted with anyone other than watching a promotional video.

I did bake cookies!  And people liked them!  :D

People have been knocking on the door and calling like crazy to try to sell stuff to us; mostly arts & crafts type stuff.  Today I made my first purchase, a painting by <a href=""http://www.westsouthwest.com/preview_cat_expand.asp?CAT_ID=82"">Merle Locke</a>, but not the artwork shown here (what I have is much, MUCH cheaper, and on canvas rather than ledger paper--apparently he doesn't do ledger paintings much anymore because it's become so expensive).  But the drawing style is the same.

That's about it for the day.  We have the evening free, which is new, and we have all day tomorrow until 7-ish off as well.  It sounds like a group of us are going to go up to Crazy Horse in the morning, eat in a restaurant one of the guys with us really likes for lunch, visit the Black Hills and then drive home through the Badlands.  At 7 we're going to a pow wow.  I'm looking forward to it! :)"

"event","I just noticed today how extremely attractive I find men who are comfortable playing with kids.  Not roughhousing or goofing off with them.  Playing with them.  Letting kids run toy monster trucks over their tummies.  Engaging the kids with jokes at their level.  Twirling the end of a jumprope or actually touching a doll.  This is something that Greg should probably know, and soon.

So today I did not build stairs.  The ""project manager"" (the pastor's husband) who is extremely cranky (with good reason) told us that all the stuff that we had to go out by ourselves and get for the project was wrong, and we couldn't build stairs the way we were planning.  (A lot of groups wound up in this boat.  It was day 2 of 11 people standing around staring into space while 2 people actually did any work due entirely to the complete and utter lack of organization here.)  So instead I stained wood molding.  It was a nice day outside--high 50s/low 60s--so I worked on them out on the concrete basketball area, where the fumes wouldn't get to me.  Unfortunately, Jack the dog did.  I really want to bring Jack home with me when I come, but he's a res dog, and used to being outside with free run of the terrain and foraging for his own food.  So, yeah.  The group leader has a photo of me literally staining wood with one hand and petting the dog curled up in my lap with the other.  I need to try and get a copy of that from her before I leave.

After the work in the morning, we went to Wounded Knee for a presentation and to offer tobacco for the souls of the dead.  I'm not entirely sure how I feel about (a) offering tobacco for the souls of the dead and (b) participating in a prayer that is in a language I don't understand.  But lightning didn't strike anyone out of the blue, so that was good.

Then we came back and learned a Lakota song (translated into English) and some Lakota dances.  And for the first time on the trip, I didn't have my camera on me to capture the incriminating images of all of the guys on our trip waddling in a circle giving themselves buffalo horns with their fingers.  I'll leave that to your imaginations.  :)

Things are winding down, so I need to go to bed.  Tomorrow we go to Kyle, which I guess is about an hour away?  I have no idea what will be going on there.  Saturday we feed buffalo in the morning and then have the rest of the day off to sightsee--we're hoping to mount an expedition to go to Rapid City (2 hours away) for lunch and then go hiking in the Black Hills, but the weather may not cooperate--we're supposed to get snow tomorrow, and someone said it was going to get down to around 19 degrees over the weekend.  Which is still better than last Friday, when I walked to work in -21 degree weather and a -37 windchill (and I have the screen captions from the weather service to prove it!)"

We visited an Episcopalian priest who's been ""retired"" for about 10 years, and he told us about his ancestor, Asanpi Bleza, who was killed in the area shortly before the Wounded Knee incident in 1890 and was denied a proper burial until his remains were rediscovered in 1948 (an article about it can be found <a href=""http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/articles/2004/07/19/news/local/top/news01.txt"">here</a>).  Then they fed us beef stew, fry bread, and blueberry wojape, which is kind of like a very thin, warm pudding.

We ate at the Episcopalian church, and after lunch I went for a walk in the cemetery.  The earliest death I found was the early 1980s.  There were disturbingly few deaths over the age of 60.  So many babies.  So many children.  So many adolescents.  So many unmarked graves."

<lj-cut text=""A President Named Obama Changes the Name Game"">A President Named Obama Changes the Name Game
By DEEPTI HAJELA
Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK (AP) -- Zenas Ackah has heard it all his life: What kind of name is that? You must not be from here. You must be foreign.

Actually, no. Born in the United States, the 22-year-old college senior with the Greek first name and the Ghanian last name grew up in Philadelphia.

But Ackah is hopeful that change is coming, that the idea of an &quot;American&quot; name will expand beyond monikers like Tom and Harry and Sally and Jane and Smith and Jones. He figures he's got a strong weapon on his side - for at least the next four years, when people look to the most powerful American in the country, the ""uber-American"" if you will, they'll be looking at President Barack Hussein Obama.

""I think it will help people understand that people in America aren't just John, Jack, Mary,"" Ackah said. ""They're Zenas and Barack.""

Obama's name gave him his share of trouble during the campaign. He acknowledged its unfamiliarity to most Americans, and there were times when supporters of his opponent made a point of using his middle name, which was seen as an attempt to cast doubt on his background and faith.

But the next four years will ensure that his name is no longer unfamiliar.

People have already named their infants after him.

The more people hear it, the more mainstream it becomes, said Don Nilsen, a professor of English linguistics at Arizona State University and co-president of the American Name Society.

""Who is more American than the president of the United States?"" he said. ""There's no question it will have a ripple effect, because of the power of the position.""

Names traditionally considered ""American"" tend to be ""British-sounding stuff,"" said Cleveland Evans, professor of psychology at Bellevue University in Nebraska. ""We are still basically an English-culture country. We really are still in many ways at our base an Anglo-Saxon culture.""

He and Nilsen pointed out that immigrants have long had a history of changing their names to fit in more with the United States, or have even had others change it for them.

Obama, born in Hawaii and named after his Kenyan father, went by Barry for some years before deciding to use his full first name.

Ackah can understand. He still finds the comments about his name irritating, along with the assumptions people make upon hearing a name they're not familiar with.

""People start talking down to you because they think you're foreign,"" he said.

Electing someone named Barack Obama president reflects a shift in attitudes about names that's been going on in American society for the past few decades, says Laura Wattenberg, a name expert and author who runs the blog The Baby Name Wizard.

""As a group, American parents are naming much more creatively and are striving to be distinctive with the names they pick,"" she said, pointing out that shift started in the 1960s when Obama was born and has only accelerated in the last 25 years or so.

So while certain names may be more popular and prevalent than others, it's not by much, she said. In 2007, Jacob was the most popular name for boys. But Wattenberg pointed out that only 1 percent of boys were given that name.

In contrast, a century ago, 7.5 percent of parents chose the top name, John.

A president named Obama could break down the perception ""that there is such a thing as a 'normal' name,"" said Wattenberg.

""It's a powerful symbol of breaking down barriers where it wasn't that long ago where kids with a non-English name would go to school and teachers would routinely change it. The president having a non-English name is a sign that we're not squeezing everyone into that box,"" she said.

Second, I thought</font>  <lj-cut text=""this"">Herod may have been buried among lavish artwork

By STEVE WEIZMAN
Associated Press Writer

HERODIUM, West Bank (AP) -- King Herod may have been buried in a crypt with lavish Roman-style wall paintings of a kind previously unseen in the Middle East, Israeli archaeologists said Wednesday. The scientists found such paintings and signs of a regal two-story mausoleum, bolstering their conviction that the ancient Jewish monarch was buried there.

Ehud Netzer, head of Jerusalem's Hebrew University excavation team, which uncovered the site of the king's winter palace in the Judean desert in 2007, said the latest finds show work and funding fit for a king.

&quot;What we found here, spread all around, are architectural fragments that enable us to restore a monument of 25 meters high, 75 feet high, very elegant, which fits Herod's taste and status,&quot; he told The Associated Press in an interview at the hillside dig in an Israeli-controlled part of the West Bank, south of Jerusalem.

No human remains or inscriptions have been found to prove conclusively that the tomb was Herod's, but excavation continues.

Herod is known for extensive building throughout the Holy Land.

Netzer said that since finding fragments of one ornately carved sarcophagus in 2007, he and his team have found two more, suggesting the monumental tomb may have been a royal family vault.

&quot;A mausoleum like the one which we have here was generally built by a king but not (necessarily) only for himself, many times for his children and his family, like the famous mausoleum of Augustus in Rome, of Hadrian in Rome,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not a surprise that we found here more than one sarcophagus.&quot;

Herod was the Jewish proxy ruler of the Holy Land under imperial Roman occupation from 37 B.C. and reigned for more than six decades. He is known to have had a taste for extravagance.

Netzer described the winter palace, built on a largely man-made hill 2,230 feet high, as a kind of &quot;country club,&quot; with a pool, baths, gardens fed by pools and aqueducts and a 650-seat theater.

In Herod's private box at the auditorium, diggers discovered delicate frescoes depicting windows opening on to painted landscapes, one of which shows what appears to be a southern Italian farm, said Roi Porat, one of Netzer's assistants on the digs. Just visible in the paintings, dating between 15 and 10 B.C., are a dog, bushes and what looks like a country villa.

Site surveyor Rachel Chachy-Laureys said the paintings were executed using techniques unknown in the Holy Land at the time and must have been done by artisans imported from Rome.

&quot;There has been no other discovery of this type of painting in the Middle East, as far as we know, until now&quot;, she said.

Gidon Foerster, a professor of archaeology at the Hebrew University not connected with this dig, agreed that the art is &quot;unique&quot; for the region. &quot;King Herod is said to have been buried there and this proves it as much as it can possibly be proved,&quot; he said.

The Herod of Christian tradition was a bloodthirsty megalomanic, who flew into a frenzy when he met the three wise men on the way to Bethlehem carrying gifts for the baby Jesus and telling of the birth of a new king of Israel.

Herod purportedly ordered the slaying of all children in his realm younger than 2. But historians are not convinced of the story's accuracy.

After Herod's death in the 1st century B.C., Herodium became a stronghold for Jewish rebels fighting Roman occupation, and the palace site suffered significant battle damage before it was destroyed by Roman soldiers in A.D. 71, a year after they razed the Second Temple in Jerusalem.

The insurgents reviled the memory of Herod as a Roman puppet, and Netzer and his team believe that the violence inflicted on the first stone casket they found suggests the rebels knew it held the king's bones.

&quot;That sarcophagus was found shattered all over the place. It seems it was taken from its place and was destroyed in a fit of rage,&quot; Porat said. &quot;That, among other things, is what tells us it was the sarcophagus of Herod.&quot;

This is probably the only time that I've heard the parable of the Prodigal Son interpreted in such a way that it seemed relevant to me.  The story has always bothered me, and I remember once when I was fourteen and riding in my dad's truck with him, trying to explain to him what my problem was with the story.  We talked about it for a while, and he gave me all the standard church answers that Dr. Juel refers to in the video.  But somehow, it's one of two times in my life that I remember talking to my dad about religion and actually feeling like he was listening to me.

I made my peace with the story, eventually, but this interpretation goes a long way in turning the story into something I can love rather than something I can just put up with in my faith.

"event","<FONT face=""Comic Sans MS"" color=#993333 size=3>At long last, I have finally passed my candidacy committee and been entranced into candidacy in the ELCA.  Greg and I drove back to Toledo for two days and I re-interviewed.  Things went amazingly well but the panel that interviewed me couldn't make a final decision until the full committee was assembled.  I just got word yesterday that my entranced status is official.

Otherwise, I've continued working and studying; Hebrew started last week already and I just took my first exam yesterday.  That went pretty well as well.

On the other hand, grades from last semester still aren't posted and the registrar just pushed the date back from Jan. 11 to sometime the week of Jan. 14 for when we can expect them.  I think I'm going to go insane.

I might actually get some work done now that I've finished watching all the <u>Kid Nation</u> episodes online.  But it will have to wait until I've finished taking a nap, because I didn't get much sleep last night, and I'm really dragging.

In London, Foreign Secretary David Miliband urgently summoned the Sudanese ambassador to discuss the case, the British government said.<br /><br />Gibbons, 54, was arrested Sunday after some of her pupils' parents complained, accusing her of naming the bear after Islam's prophet. Muhammad is a common name among Muslim men, but giving the prophet's name to an animal would be seen as insulting by many Muslims.<br /><br />Prosecutor General Salah Eddin Abu Zaid said Gibbons was charged under article 125 of the Sudanese legal code and her case would be referred to court Thursday.<br /><br />If convicted, she faces up to 40 lashes, six months and prison and a fine, said Abdul Daem Zumrawi, the Justice Ministry's undersecretary.<br /><br />""What will be applied is (at) the discretionary power of the judge to issue the verdict,"" he was quoted as saying by the official Sudanese News Agency.<br /><br />The meeting between Miliband and Ambassador Omer Mohammed Ahmed Siddig would take place as soon as possible, according to the British Foreign Office.<br /><br />""We are surprised and disappointed by this development and the Foreign Secretary will summon as a matter of urgency the Sudanese ambassador to discuss the matter further,"" said Michael Ellam, a spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown's office.<br /><br />Miliband would ask the ""for the rationale behind the charges and a sense of what the next steps might be"" amid an escalating diplomatic dispute in the case, he said.<br /><br />""We will consider our response in the light of that,"" Ellam said.<br /><br />The Gibbons family declined to speak with The Associated Press, saying the British government had advised them not to comment to the media.<br /><br />In Khartoum, the British Embassy said diplomats had been allowed to visit Gibbons on Wednesday. ""She said she was being well-treated and that she was OK,"" said embassy spokesman Omar Daair.<br /><br />Gibbons was teaching her pupils, who are around age 7, about animals and asked one of them to bring in her teddy bear, said Robert Boulos, a spokesman for Unity High School in Khartoum. She asked the students to pick names for it and they proposed Abdullah, Hassan and Muhammad, and in September, the pupils voted to name it Muhammad, he said.<br /><br />Each child was allowed to take the bear home on weekends and write a diary about what they did with it. The diary entries were collected in a book with the bear's picture on the cover, labeled, ""My Name is Muhammad,"" he said. The bear itself was never labeled with the name, he added.<br /><br />The Unity High School, a private English-language school with elementary to high school levels, was founded by Christian groups, but 90 percent of its students are Muslim, mostly from upper-class Sudanese families.<br /><br />Several Sudanese newspapers ran a statement Tuesday reportedly from the school, saying the administration ""offers an official apology to the students and their families and all Muslims for what came from an individual initiative."" It said Gibbons had been ""removed from her work at the school.""<br /><br />The Sudanese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday played down the significance of the case, calling it ""isolated despite our condemnation and rejection of it.""<br /><br />Ministry spokesman Ali al-Sadeq said it was an incidence of a ""teacher's misconduct against the Islamic faith"" but noted the school's apology.<br /><br />The statement from the school in newspapers called it a ""misunderstanding."" It underlined the school's ""deep respect for the heavenly religions"" and for the ""beliefs of Muslims and their rituals.""<br /><br />Although Khartoum officials played down the case and said it was an isolated incident, Sudan's top clerics said in a statement Wednesday that the full measure of the law should be applied against Gibbons, calling the incident part of a broader Western ""plot"" against Islam.<br /><br />Northern Sudan's legal system is based on Islam's Sharia law, which harshly punishes blasphemy. Any depiction of the prophet is forbidden in Islam, for fear it would provoke idolatry. Caricatures of Muhammad in some European media last year sparked riots in several Muslim countries.<br /><br />The Sudanese clerics said this was blasphemy and believed it was intentional.<br /><br />""What has happened was not haphazard or carried out of ignorance, but rather a calculated action and another ring in the circles of plotting against Islam,"" the Sudanese Assembly of the Ulemas said the statement.<br /><br />""It is part of the campaign of the so-called war against terrorism and the intense media campaign against Islam,"" they said.<br /><br />Although an earlier report had suggested that only one parent had complained, the clergy statement Wednesday said that several had complained.<br /><br />There were widespread calls in Britain for Gibbons' release. The Muslim Council of Britain urged the Sudanese government to intervene.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Associated Press Writer Mohamed Osman contributed to this report. </div>"

Below is the text or <a href=""http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/19980124/rafiles/19980124_lamentations_14.ram"">here</a> is the audio.<br /><br /><b></b></font><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Laws Concerning Food and Drink...""><font size=""3"" face=""Comic Sans MS"" color=""#993333""><b><font><b>Laws Concerning Food and Drink; Household Principles; Lamentations of the Father</b><br /><br /></font></b><font>by Ian Frazier<br /><br />Of the beasts of the field, and of the fishes of the sea, and of all foods that are acceptable in my sight you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the hoofed animals, broiled or ground into burgers, you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the cloven-hoofed animal, plain or with cheese, you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the cereal grains, of the corn and of the wheat and of the oats, and of all the cereals that are of bright color and unknown provenance you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the quiescently frozen dessert and of all frozen after-meal treats you may eat, but absolutely not in the living room. Of the juices and other beverages, yes, even of those in sippy-cups, you may drink, but not in the living room, neither may you carry such therein. Indeed, when you reach the place where the living room carpet begins, of any food or beverage there you may not eat, neither may you drink.<br /><br />But if you are sick, and are lying down and watching something, then may you eat in the living room.<br /><br /><b>Laws When at Table</b><br />And if you are seated in your high chair, or in a chair such as a greater person might use, keep your legs and feet below you as they were. Neither raise up your knees, nor place your feet upon the table, for that is an abomination to me. Yes, even when you have an interesting bandage to show, your feet upon the table are an abomination, and worthy of rebuke. Drink your milk as it is given you, neither use on it any utensils, nor fork, nor knife, nor spoon, for that is not what they are for; if you will dip your blocks in the milk, and lick it off, you will be sent away. When you have drunk, let the empty cup then remain upon the table, and do not bite it upon its edge and by your teeth hold it to your face in order to make noises in it sounding like a duck; for you will be sent away.<br /><br />When you chew your food, keep your mouth closed until you have swallowed, and do not open it to show your brother or your sister what is within; I say to you, do not so, even if your brother or your sister has done the same to you. Eat your food only; do not eat that which is not food; neither seize the table between your jaws, nor use the raiment of the table to wipe your lips. I say again to you, do not touch it, but leave it as it is. And though your stick of carrot does indeed resemble a marker, draw not with it upon the table, even in pretend, for we do not do that, that is why. And though the pieces of broccoli are very like small trees, do not stand them upright to make a forest, because we do not do that, that is why. Sit just as I have told you, and do not lean to one side or the other, nor slide down until you are nearly slid away. Heed me; for if you sit like that, your hair will go into the syrup. And now behold, even as I have said, it has come to pass.<br /><br /><b>Laws Pertaining to Dessert</b><br />For we judge between the plate that is unclean and the plate that is clean, saying first, if the plate is clean, then you shall have dessert. But of the unclean plate, the laws are these: If you have eaten most of your meat, and two bites of your peas with each bite consisting of not less than three peas each, or in total six peas, eaten where I can see, and you have also eaten enough of your potatoes to fill two forks, both forkfuls eaten where I can see, then you shall have dessert. But if you eat a lesser number of peas, and yet you eat the potatoes, still you shall not have dessert; and if you eat the peas, yet leave the potatoes uneaten, you shall not have dessert, no, not even a small portion thereof. And if you try to deceive by moving the potatoes or peas around with a fork, that it may appear you have eaten what you have not, you will fall into iniquity. And I will know, and you shall have no dessert.<br /><br /><b>On Screaming</b><br />Do not scream; for it is as if you scream all the time. If you are given a plate on which two foods you do not wish to touch each other are touching each other, your voice rises up even to the ceiling, while you point to the offense with the finger of your right hand; but I say to you, scream not, only remonstrate gently with the server, that the server may correct the fault. Likewise if you receive a portion of fish from which every piece of herbal seasoning has not been scraped off, and the herbal seasoning is loathsome to you, and steeped in vileness, again I say, refrain from screaming. Though the vileness overwhelm you, and cause you a faint unto death, make not that sound from within your throat, neither cover your face, nor press your fingers to your nose. For even now I have made the fish as it should be; behold, I eat of it myself, yet do not die.<br /><br /><b>Concerning Face and Hands</b><br />Cast your countenance upward to the light, and lift your eyes to the hills, that I may more easily wash you off. For the stains are upon you; even to the very back of your head, there is rice thereon. And in the breast pocket of your garment, and upon the tie of your shoe, rice and other fragments are distributed in a manner wonderful to see. Only hold yourself still; hold still, I say. Give each finger in its turn for my examination thereof, and also each thumb. Lo, how iniquitous they appear. What I do is as it must be; and you shall not go hence until I have done.<br /><br /><b>Various Other Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances</b><br />Bite not, lest you be cast into quiet time. Neither drink of your own bath water, nor of bath water of any kind; nor rub your feet on bread, even if it be in the package; nor rub yourself against cars, nor against any building; nor eat sand.<br /><br />Leave the cat alone, for what has the cat done, that you should so afflict it with tape? And hum not that humming in your nose as I read, nor stand between the light and the book. Indeed, you will drive me to madness. Nor forget what I said about the tape.<br /><br /><b>Complaints and Lamentations</b><br />O my children, you are disobedient. For when I tell you what you must do, you argue and dispute hotly even to the littlest detail; and when I do not accede, you cry out, and hit and kick. Yes, and even sometimes do you spit, and shout ""stupid-head"" and other blasphemies, and hit and kick the wall and the molding thereof when you are sent to the corner. And though the law teaches that no one shall be sent to the corner for more minutes than he has years of age, yet I would leave you there all day, so mighty am I in anger. But upon being sent to the corner you ask straightaway, ""Can I come out?"" and I reply, ""No, you may not come out."" And again you ask, and again I give the same reply. But when you ask again a third time, then you may come out.<br /><br />Hear me, O my children, for the bills they kill me. I pay and pay again, even to the twelfth time in a year, and yet again they mount higher than before. For our health, that we may be covered, I give six hundred and twenty talents twelve times in a year; but even this covers not the fifteen hundred deductible for each member of the family within a calendar year. And yet for ordinary visits we still are not covered, nor for many medicines, nor for the teeth within our mouths. Guess not at what rage is in my mind, for surely you cannot know.<br /><br />For I will come to you at the first of the month and at the fifteenth of the month with the bills and a great whining and moan. And when the month of taxes comes, I will decry the wrong and unfairness of it, and mourn with wine and ashtrays, and rend my receipts. And you shall remember that I am that I am: before, after, and until you are twenty-one. Hear me then, and avoid me in my wrath, O children of me.</font></font></div>"

Midterms are finally over and I'm really enjoying being able to wind down after last week.  Once papers start getting returned we'll know how much of that cramming was worth it.

Today Luther had free books out in the lobby of Northwestern Hall; usually profs who retire or move offices or whatever will weed their libraries and leave them for poor students.  Today we had a deceased pastor whose estate left her ENTIRE LIBRARY to us.  Walking home with everything was a trip.

<u>General Religion</u>
<i>The Holy Bible with Apocrypha</i> NRSV (Apparently the NRSV is the preferred translation of Lutherans, or at least the seminary, as opposed to the KJ version, NKJ version, or NIV versions I grew up with.)
<i>She Who Is:  The Mystery of God in Feminist Theological Discourse</i> by Elizabeth A. Johnson
<i>Clown Ministry:  A How-To Manual and Dozens of Skits for Service and Worship</i> by Floyd Shaffer and Penne Sewall
<i>Sermon on the Stage:  More Sketches and Monologues Based on Familiar Bible Characters</i> by Martha Bolton

<u>Miscellaneous</u>
<i>Salmebog for Lutherife Kristne i America</i>, 1920.  We think it's a Lutheran confessional writing given to someone for confirmation, but between the script and language barrier we can't tell.  We're sticking it in a care package to send to Greg's family--his brother speaks German.
<i>THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH</i> by Norton Juster, Illustrations by Jules Feiffer.  I made an audible gasp when I found this in the stack of 1970s Sunday School curricula.

<u>Lutheran Resources</u>
<i>Lent:  Book One</i> (lectionary, songs, and devotionals for the Lenten season.
<i>Lectionary for the Christian People</i> A and C.  When we wind up in cycles B and D I guess we'll have to actually buy copies.
<i>Scriptural and Topical Indices to LBW</i>.  The LBW is also known as the Lutheran Book of Worship, or the Green Book.  It's the hymnal we've been using since the seventies that was recently replaced by the cranberry book (not to be confused with the red book from the forties).
<i>Hymnal Companion to the Lutheran Book of Worship</i>.  Recommended for my upcoming hymnody class.  Incredibly expensive if bought new.</FONT>"

This section from <i>The European Reformations</i> needs to be saved for posterity, however (page 18):</FONT>

A far more colorful effort to explain the Reformation is the study by Norman O. Brown (1959: 203), which depicts Luther as an anal personality whose experience in the privy ""inaugurated Protestant theology.""  Put more crudely, Luther's conversion experience (located in by dubious reference in the medieval outhouse) may be compared to a giant dose of theological laxative that purged Luther of his religious constipation.  This neo-Freudian interpretation was given dramatic form in John Osborne's play <i>Luther</i>, which opened at the Nottingham Royal Theatre in 1961 and then played Broadway.  As Luther prepares for his first mass, he responds to a fellow priest's exhortation to faith by saying, ""I wish my bowels would open.  I'm blocked like an old crypt.""  And as he later describes his conversion experience in the privy, Luther says:  ""And I sat in a heap of pain until the words emerged and opened out.  'The just shall live by faith.'  My pain vanished, my bowels flushed and I could get up.  I could see the life I'd lost"" (Osborne 1963: 32, 76)."

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday:  Greek

Tuesday and Thursday:  Reform of the Church, Pentateuch, and Creation and the Triune God.

Thursday only (2nd half of the semester):  Lutheran Hymnody.

Stupid ""only 5 credits per semester"" rule won't let me register for Ecumenical Hymnody as well.

In other news, I just baked three pans of brownies for the church's ice cream social.  From scratch, partially just to annoy the woman in charge of the ice cream social who only wanted store bought or mix brownies and partially because even though she'll never know, I just like picturing her face should she ever find out I baked her brownies from my <i>Star Wars</i> cookbook.  And they're named after a bounty hunter.

This may seem petty, but this woman has seriously managed to put a stop to every single thing the Fellowship Committee has tried to do since I joined it a year ago.  Including, in many forms, the ice cream social, which she only stopped complaining about when we put her in charge.  And even now she's limiting us to vanilla only because that's all they sell in those big tubs at Aldi's and she's not going anywhere else, gol' darn it (but she won't stay on the committee if anyone else assists/does the shopping).  And forget toppings.  There'll be kids, and kids don't need more sugar than is already in ice cream.

Bear in mind that I spent six nights a week two summers of my life waiting tables in an ice cream parlor.  The committee got really excited about my cone clowns before she got any arguments ready and they shouted her down on them.

Harmless, undetectable acts of revenge are pretty much what keeps me going to these committee meetings."

Not many other things that I shall miss, though.

On Monday I managed to work a shift at the Gift Shop without buying anything, which was a first.  Instead, picked up from upstairs:

*  <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i> by Pope Benedict XVI.  His first since becoming Pope.  (Page 22 he quotes one of the major tenets of Lutheranism.  Without citation, but anyway.  Same chapter he also quotes Eastern doctrine on iconography in a positive light.  A welcome surprise.)

*  <i>Discarded Science:  Ideas that Seemed Good at the Time</i> by John Grant.  Haven't started it yet.

*  <i>Star Wars:  Allegiance</i> by Timothy Zahn.  He has a new one out!  And it takes place during the Rebellion-era!

*  <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> by J.K. Rowling.  I didn't try on <i>purpose</i> to finish the set so far just as the final book was going to be released.  It just happened.  Really.

Yesterday Greg and I picked up my friend Jenny from work to take her home, but then she decided she'd rather go hang out in Ann Arbor, and since we were en route to Grand Rapids anyway we dropped her off.  Stopped in East Lansing at the MSU surplus store and picked up a $50 computer to donate to the church for Greg's photo ministry (which is a long and drawn out story) and talked to the head of my candidacy committee who revealed that the reason I hadn't gotten a copy of my revised decision (made on May 23rd) is because no one had typed it yet.  And then they lost it.  But he drove 45 minutes out of his way to go and find it and type it for me.  It should be arriving in the mail any day now.  Harumph.

So we arrived in Grand Rapids and spent the evening with Aunt Jane, Uncle Harry, Steve, Joanna, Aunt Marge, Uncle Jim, Mom, and Aunt Lorri celebrating Aunt Lorri's birthday (which was actually back in March, but she was AWOL).  Made up a compilation disk of songs she'd probably find useful as an elementary-level teacher once she's gone back permanently overseas and can't take her piano, piano books, audio CDs, etc.  Of course, in making up the CD I downloaded and listened to about six hours of old Sunday School songs.  Greg is now threatening me with no children if I don't stop singing those d--- songs until we actually have kids.  :D

Today slept in late (we drove back last night from Grand Rapids and got in very late) and then celebrated the 4th with my in-laws.  While Greg went to work I went and hauled a tree for my in laws and then supervised its planting in their yard.  All went smoothly except when the spade broke in half.  We went and borrowed some shovels from the neighbors--and the shovels literally looked like they were a century old.  It was kind of freaky.  Narrowly lost to my father-in-law at Apples-to-Apples and watched the Tigers' game this evening; saw a few fireworks from the front patio and on the drive home but didn't make a point of going out to see them--probably wouldn't have been able to find parking anyway.  Had a good chat with my mother-in-law while the men-folk were busy planting bushes."

"event","<DIV><FONT face=""Comic Sans MS"" color=#993333 size=3>So I finally gave in to Greg's nagging (I thought that was my job?) and started researching new laptops to take to seminary.  Not that my old laptop has anything wrong with it, mind you, but he's right; it probably won't have the stamina to make it another four years.  And we won't have the money to replace it during that time.

So I looked around at the Internet, priced some different models, and looked up problems that current users have complained about on all of the ones that had responses listed.  It looked like I was going to have to spend about $1200 on a decent one.

Last night we were in Best Buy and we found a Compaq Presario V6305 for $599.99.  So we brought it home.  I'm having a blast!  And plus, it's still all shiny.

So I stayed home from work today due to a roiling stomach and a massive headache.  Slept until 1pm and then decided I probably wasn't going to make my headache any better by oversleeping anymore and that I'd probably drive my husband nuts if I couldn't get to sleep this evening (his job has him get up about 4am...then after he gets off work at 9am he has to go up to Ann Arbor to help his folks at the estate sale for his grandparents' house).

We're not sure that reminiscing about the past year would be an overall good thing to do.  Two family deaths, a lot of employment instablility, a lot of loneliness, and now the stress of getting ready for seminary and not being sure of my entrance decision has just amounted to a lot of bickering and fighting for us.

But the replacement wedding cake topper (Dad dropped the original one) was still good!

In other news, a bug totally flew into my eye on Friday night.  And got stuck.  And bit my eyelid from the inside.  And got squished while we were trying to get him out.  Took almost 24-hours to cry some little bit of something out completely.  My eye finally feels back to normal now.  Still a tiny bit of redness, but hopefully I'll be able to go back to contacts in time for our big trip!

I also took out <i>The Fire Rose</i> by Mercedes Lackey and <i>The Mislaid Magician, or, Ten Years After</i> by Patricia C. Wrede and Caroline Stervemeyer.

This week I took out <i>Out to Canaan</i> by Jan Karon, <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> by J. K. Rowling, and <i>Mathematical Ciphers:  From Caesar to RSA</i> by Annie L. Young.

Greg's job has finally sorted itself out.  He is being cut back to part time as of 16 April 2007, working 20 hours per week, with the same three-day ""weekend"" that I have.

I have finally located a new psychologist per the instructions of the psychological examination last February in order to go to seminary.

On to my selections for the week:

<i>Neither Here nor There:  Travels in Europe</i> by Bill Bryson

<i>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid:  A Memior</i> by Bill Bryson

<i>A Tour of the Calculus</i> by David Berlinski

<i>Christianity for the Rest of Us:  How the Neighborhood Church is Transforming the Faith</i> by Diana Butler Bass

<i>Word Myths:  Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends</i> by David Wilton

<i>A Year in the Merde</i> by Stephen Clarke

Also, most people already know that I had my psych evaluation for becoming a pastor last week.  Three days straight of 9-4:30 sessions.  I was nervous going in knowing that my depression has been spiraling out of control steadily for months now.  They gave me the MMPI (which was used to diagnose my depression in the first place) and they're finding out that even medicated I'm as bad if not worse than when I was first diagnosed--and a couple of categories were nearly off the chart.  The psychologist who wrote the report is recommending I go to seminary anyway provided I go back to seeing a therapist (particularly a psychiatrist, since there's very tenuous evidence that I could be suffering from manic depression instead of normal depression, and they're going to have to tamper with my drugs again anyway).  But, the psychologist is just writing the report he doesn't actually make that call; my church does.  So it'll be a while before I hear.</FONT>"

"event","<FONT face=""Comic Sans MS"" color=#993333 size=3>Lots of junk has been happening lately.  I'll try to be as succinct as possible.

<u>Work</u>:  I won the $100 gift card for being employee of the month in the month of December with perfect attendance (including no tardies) and 100% scores on all three of the randomly-selected recorded calls I took.  Have been training the French speaker I interviewed (yes, I interviewed someone...before I was even a permanent employee) for the past two weekends in how to dispatch.  Didn't realize how comparably fast I've been at doing my job--and doing it while taking calls--until I had to sit for eight hours a day watching someone with no computer skills attempt to do my job in slow motion.  Makes me fidgety.

Today the girl that trained me had her leaving party and I baked cookies.  I managed to make it through my peanut-butter-cookie-pizza with the only mishap being that the bottom of the pizza pan had holes in it so when I baked it little bits of cookie dough fell into the bottom of the oven and along with smelling awful set off the smoke detector regularly.  All morning.  Then I made two and a half dozen wookiee cookies and in putting them over onto the plates managed to knock two dozen of them onto the floor so wound up stopping at Kroger on my way to work to pick up some store-bought cookies.  Greg salvaged the floor cookies for his own consumption.  (Yes, I had just cleaned the floor.  Still doesn't make it right.)

<u>Recreation</u>:  Made it through a month of taking either Yoga or Pilates once per week until December 26 when I had some in-law gathering or another to go to and haven't been back since.  This is alarming since I've now officially hit 200lbs.  Have also given up eating lunch and walking on the treadmill downstairs during my half-hour break which can't be all that effective since by time I get downstairs I've only got 20 minutes at most to be doing anything (and it makes me really cranky by time I get home) but it sure beats staying a half-hour beyond my end time at work to do it.  And if I don't walk at work, I don't do it, I've discovered.  On our days off Greg and I have been exploring different Metroparks and their walking trails.  We finally got to visit Oak Openings, even!  (Geographical Note:  Oak Openings is across the street from the airport.  On our first attempt to go, the police had all entrances to it blocked off as some local private school girl had reported being abducted and then dumped there--turned out to be a hoax.  The second time there was a bomb threat at the airport.  The third time there was ANOTHER bomb threat at the airport which even the FBI classified as a hoax early on.  But they still closed the roads.)

Yesterday Greg and I got dressed up to go to <u>Phantom of the Opera</u> at the Stranahan Theatre.  It was really fun.  Aside from locking myself in the bathroom for two hours trying to get pretty only to find out that trying two different ways to curl my hair three separate times just freaking didn't work.  Then I ran out of time and Greg was yelling how much time we had to get to the theatre every five minutes and I went with just my hair down but I think it was okay.  And I got to wear one of my French scarves.

<u>Future Plans</u>:  Met with Pastor Kathy from our synod to discuss candidacy on Monday.  She asked us to describe our faith stories and stuff and didn't really react to Greg's but as soon as I finished mine the first thing out of her mouth was, ""Now, I know you have a French and Math degree and that uses one side of your brain.  Do you really think you can survive in a liberal arts environment like seminary?""  O_o  Greg says I overreacted and sounded very defensive in response.  He still hasn't explained to me how I could have NOT overreacted and not defensive in response.  I mean, my double major was in math and FRENCH LITERATURE.  I listed off my honors thesis--on philosophy and Descartes--and all the history and English literature courses I'd taken and how I had taught English in France and finally she was satisfied and THEN she tells me to be considerate in thinking about whether I even HAVE a call *groan--would I be beating my brains out to make these people happy if this wasn't something I HAD to do for my conscience's sake?* because ""smart"" isn't really what they're looking for in seminary or in pastors.  And Greg's all like, ""well, don't let her opinion mean to much to you because she doesn't even really KNOW you"" to which I'm all like, ""Yeah, but they set up these things called deadlines for  a reason.  I mailed my papers to her in the last week of November and she even said in our meeting that she hadn't read them yet.  And when your JOB is to screen seminary applicants AND you set up this meeting with THREE WEEKS notice wouldn't you maybe at least SCAN the freaking 7-page autobiography you've been given so you might know the person you're going to be asking those questions of at least a little bit?  I mean, isn't this well into rediculous territory?

Monday was the first time that I actually considered just going back to the Reformed church just because no one would really think to even ASK those things there.  Or at least they wouldn't imply to someone they're not wanted because of a talent they have to offer.

But the next step is our psychological evaluations.  If I had stayed with the Kalamazoo synod with Pastor Dracula, I'd've been done in a three-hour session in Detroit.  Oh, no.  I live in Ohio now.  The psychological evaluation takes THREE DAYS.  And requires a billion more forms, including an 18-page autobiographical form.  I keep wondering when they're going to spring something like, ""Includes a free lobotomy!"" on me.  After that there's three more interviews and a background check.  Then I'm clear.

On the other hand, I've made an encouraging dent in my list of scholarships to apply for.  And just the other day someone got trapped in an elevator at the ELCA national headquarters (which I now know the address of...) and depending on who was stuck and if only their phone rang into our call center instead of their internal security office, I might've been able to bribe someone into just providing me with this education and saved myself the trouble.

And finally, the real reason I started this post:  my latest library trips.

Today I returned:

<u>Helpmates, Heros and Harlots:  Women's Stories in the Hebrew Bible</u>. Feminist and womanist criticisms of the women's stories in the Old Testament.

<u>Words from Genesis</u> by Isaac Asimov.  Not quite as good as his <u>Words from the Myths</u> but an interesting read nonetheless.

<u>Word Mysteries and Histories:  From Quiche to Humble Pie</u>.  I hate it when I take out etymylogical books and they read about as well as the dictionary.  Unable to finish it.

I renewed from the previous batch:

<u>The Pickwick Papers</u>.  At this point last year I was on a huge Dickins kick.  And I really like him.  I just haven't brought myself to start this one yet.

<u>Pi in the Sky:  Counting, Thinking, and Being</u> by John D. Barrow.  One of the more readable philosophy of mathematics books I've run across.  Includes diagrams of the evolution of our digits 1-9 from ancient India through Arabia and finally Europe to today.

<u>The Apocrypha</u> edited by Edgar J. Goodspeed.

<u>The Ultimate Book of Bible Trivia</u>.  There's a lot of wine terms named after Israelite kings for some reason.

<u>Mathematical Mountaintops:  The Five Most Famous Problems of All Time</u>.  OH!  Speaking of which, I finally watched <i>Proof</i> with Gwenyth Paltrow last week.  At work.  On the six-month date of losing my dad.  People kept walking by my cubicle and asking me why I was crying.  Fortunately we were slow so no customers got calls answered in mid-sob.  Great movie, though.  Just my timing sucks.

And I took out new:

<u>The Complete Guide for the Serviceman's Wife</u>.  From 1956.  Took it out thinking it was going to be a laugh a minute.  Am actually learning a fair amount of trivia about lengths of tours of duty and how to tell officers apart by their uniforms and where the closest dry cleaners is to different bases (in 1956 there were no dry cleaners in Saudi Arabia.  The closest one was in Beirut.  Not kidding).  I mean, yeah, there's five pages devoted to calling card etiquette and an enumerated list of 37 jobs permissible to be held by women on military bases, but still.

<u>Sister of Wisdom:  St. Hildegard's Theology of the Feminine</u>.  Haven't started it yet.

<u>Cross-X</u>.  Yes.  There really is a mainstream story out there about high school policy debate teams.  Had to take it out.  No choice.  This I must experience first hand.

<u>The Wizard of London</u> by Mercedes Lackey.  It looks very much like yet another plot she's ripped off from Patricia C. Wrede and added adult content to, but what the hey.

<u>Word Fugitives:  In Pursuit of Wanted Words</u>.  Based on a magazine column of the same name that I hadn't ever heard of.  People try to coin words for situations we really don't have a term for.  Like, the confusion people experience when they hear a cell phone ringing and wonder whether it's theirs (pandephonium) and those people that leave long, rambling messages on answering machines and then rattle off their phone numbers at lightning speed in the last second, forcing you to repeat the entire message to get the all-important digits (numblers).

<u>The Romanovs</u> by Virginia Cowles.  Haven't started it yet.</FONT>"

<P>Sunday 12/10 1-4pm, Nie Funeral Homes, corner of Carpenter & Washtenaw roads, Ann Arbor, MI.  Light refreshments (cookies baked by yours truly) to be provided.</p>
<P>Monday 12/11 10am immediately preceding the memorial service.</p>
<p><u>Funeral</u>
<p>Monday 12/11 11am, Nie Funeral Homes, same address, Pastor Mark Gibbs of Ottawa Lake, MI presiding.  Internment to immediately follow.  Per the request of the family no meal will be provided afterwards.</p>
<a href=""http://www.niefuneralhomes.com"">www.niefuneralhomes.com</a>
<p>Today was a housewife-y day, baked cookies for tomorrow and had dinner ready and the table set for my husband when he got home.  Greg and I each took personal days on Thursday when we were called up because things looked so bad.  Both of us wound up calling in around 4:25pm Thursday afternoon to notify the jobs we wouldn't be there Friday either since it looked like he was going to make it into the night and we were starting to divide up the overnight hours into shifts again.  Maybe ten minutes after I talked to my boss's boss (my boss was gone for the day by time I called) and took my remaining personal day for the year he was gone, so quietly that the rest of the family (who were arguing over pizza orders) didn't catch it instantaneously.  Called in to work on Friday and made arrangements with my boss for Friday through Sunday to be taken as berevement days rather than personal days; I told him I <i>could</i> come in today, but that at that point if I only work one day out of the week was it worth it to him?  Monday I would have off anyway.</p>
<p>That gave me two days off more than my husband, who went to work today and will work through visitation tomorrow, taking Monday off for the funeral.  I feel oddly guilty about that, since it was his grandpa that died.  Then again, I really needed today to myself.  Last night was the first night I've had an unbroken night's rest in a week, and the second time I woke up in the same bed I started out in at the beginning of the night.  I'm looking forward to normalcy starting to set back in.</p>

Of course, then my husband came home for dinner on his lunch hour and showed me the letter he received today saying...his position is being eliminated.  This is his three month notice unless someone close to retirement accepts a buy-out offer."

It was just starting like we were going to be assigning the over-night shifts so I went to call into work and see if I could get my day off extended.  Ten minutes after the director of the department told me to stay with the family and help, he was gone.

"event","<FONT face=""Comic Sans MS"" color=#993333 size=3>Woke up this morning at 6:10 to the phone ringing.  It was my father-in-law; Greg's grandpa had taken a turn for the worse and since his breathing had changed wasn't expected to make it through the day.  Called my husband and relayed the message; got dressed and ate a bowl of cereal and then called in for the day.  Have been at the old homestead since about 9; it's an hour drive and Greg couldn't leave until they were done with the morning news.  We're mostly all here now, except the uncle that's estranged (whose wife is here and has been trading shifts with the mother-in-law, the blood-aunt, and myself since Monday).  I thought I was done emptying cathedar bags a few years ago when Grandpa Scholten died but I guess not.  And I've learned to administer medicine through a stomach tube which is new.

I have managed not to smack either my aunt-in-law or my mother-in-law yet.

It seems befitting, I guess, if he has to go, for a seasoned navy WWII vet to go on this day.

In other news, our six-month wedding anniversary was on Sunday and we finally got to celebrate it last night at Spaghetti Warehouse.  On Tuesday it was two years from his proposal to me.

Before going to dinner I also sampled a Pilates class at one of the local fitness centers and today I am SO SORE.  I fell down a lot, but at least I felt good doing it.</FONT>"

"event","<FONT Face=""comic Sans MS"" color=#993333 size=2>Grandpa Olsen was successfully moved home yesterday.  I went up to see him after work since Greg was uncomfortable with my taking time off to go up with him.  It really weirded out my mother-in-law; but if that WAS the last time he was going to be lucid and I DIDN'T go pay my respects I wouldn't've forgiven myself.

He was aware and excited to be home for the three seconds of my visit he was awake.  But he had a pretty big day; apparently as soon as the hospice nurse left he hopped out of bed and wanted to ""take a tour"".  He only made it as far as the overstuffed chair across the room before he exhausted himself though.

Anyway, chatted with my mother-in-law and Greg's aunt for an hour or so before driving back down to Toledo.

We got home today and had a message from my mother-in-law saying Grandpa has also managed to contract the flu and is now vomiting and has a fever (what exactly he's vomiting is unclear since he's been taken off food and the feeding tube).  Greg's going back up this morning but should be home by now; I'm going up to spend the day tomorrow.</FONT>"

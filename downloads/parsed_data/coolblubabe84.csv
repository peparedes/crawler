"event","wow...i haven't written in so long.  i thought that once summer came i would be writing novels in this bullshit.  amazingly i haven't written a thing really.  i think even though i have less time in the school year i write anyways just to blow off some steam.  since this summer is just a relax and get back to where i need to be summer i haven't much to bitch about.  and when i do, it's to people.  lol, i don't know which is worse.  whatever.  so yeah, glen and i are super duper!  sigh...of course we are.  lol, besides the fact that we are too fricken far apart!  oh deary.  i don't know what imma do without that boy.  he's everything to me.  but we're making it work.  there have only been a few episodes of me breaking down...lol, and i'm sure they won't be the last. i just hope they aren't that frequent.  cause that would blow.  anyways. i miss my traci too.  i never get to see her.  and she's been going through some hard stuff and i haven't been able to be there for her and i feel horribly.  oy.  i love her so much and i hate to know that she's sad or not doing well. she's always been there for me when i needed her. so why can't i be there for her?  i'm a poopy best friend.  sigh.  well, she seems to be doing okay now. she's with her sister which is good.  she's away from all the shit here and just being with family which is a good thing. so i'm glad.  i hope that one day she will be uber happy, cause she's so amazing and she deserves it all!  i love her!"

"event","ahh im in intense bliss.  well besides the coughing up chunks of phlegm and driping mucus from my nose and eyes.  gross i know.  however, im blissful because of my boy.  he is here now.  not for long, but that matters not.  so i call him to tell him to get his ass over my house after school on friday and he appears in my living room sitting on my couch.  naturally i attack him!  oh so much fun.  and then my mom leaves to pick up nate!... akwardness ariving in two point two.  hes coming to work around our yard for drug money. woohoo what a sweet kid. so naturally i dont wanan be anywhere near talking distance with him. but anways.  while my mom is gone glen and i are on the couch just sitting there being silly and talking and hes tickling me and we keep getting really close and he puts his arm around me and is just rubbing my arms and what not.  and then my mommy comes home and we talk to her for a while and then i tell her were gonna go upstairs and look at prom pictures.  so naturally i have to show them to him since that was my plot to get him in my bed. so i show them to him and he enjoys...or pretends to. hes so good to me.  and then i show him some stuff from Di.  well...the newspapers at least. and he puts his arm around me and does the whole loving arm rubbing and back rubbing thing while we look at the newspapers and he asks me questions about our problem and what not and he's generally interested.  and he kisses my head and all that good stuff. and im like...awww. i missed him soooo much.  so then we throw the newspapers ont he floor and have wild mad monkey sex! haha no just kidding.  but what we do is get all comfy under the covers cause im cold and hes snuggling up to me and what not.  hes arms are around me in this big safe hug and then he kisses my head, and then my cheek and my ears and then....my ass. haha no just kidding again.  he kisses my mouth!!!!!!!!!!!! woohoo. so naturally i have to play it off like its funny cause im retarded. and i laughed and made my little excited face where i crunch my nose up and what not and he just laughed and we exchanged some words and then kissed again. and again. and again, until were not kissing again, were just kissing. for long periods of time. and they were the nicest kisses ever. so great.  tounge and everything, but not big and sloppy tounge, just subtle sweet tounge.  i thought it might be dissapointing cause he has like...no lips, but it was the best kiss ive ever gotten.  it was just so....so nice. i dont know how to describe it. and he was holding me all nice and kissing me and playing with my hair and i thought i was gonna faint.  i was soooo happy.  and then we stopped and talked a little and he asked me why i wanted to be with someone 1000 miles away who was an asshole. and i was like...first of all your not an asshole! second of all...i wanna be with you, no matter where you are.  and hes like that doesnt answer my question. and i put my head on his shoulder and i started crying and i said...because i love you.  and he kissed my tears!  he actually kissed them.  like that saying about kissing away someones tears.  he did. mascara and all!  and then i asked him why hed want to be with someone like me and he said because i was beautiful, and sexy, and because i was smart and i said no im not and hes like, bethy you're really intellegent, and you're nice, and you make me laugh.  not many people make me laugh. and im like...thats cause im retarded, and he said something along the lines of no i wasnt.  and we both kept questioning why each one of us wanted to be with the other one, and we kept reitterating the reasons and what not.  inbetween all this everyonce and a while we would kiss and what not.  and then he was like...lol, on top of me, and he asked, if you looked into the future and saw that this wouldn't work, would you still do it. and i just looked at him and said, of course i would, i wouldnt give up the amazing time that i could spend with you and all that i feel about you for anything. and he just dropped his head on mine and closed his eyes and took a deap breath.  and we just hugged with him on top of me for a while.  then we got all randy. haha.  and in between we'd stop and talk about stuff and he'd play with my hair and say he loved it. and say i was beautiful and what not.  and id play with his hair and kiss him and we just couldnt keep our hands off each other.  and we snuggled and kissed and slept and snored and tickled andlaughed and talked and all the greatest things in the world.  and i love him.  and i cannot wait to see him again.  and then he called me when he got home and asked how my day was and i said it was good, and i asked how his was and he said it depepended on mine and i said mine was really really good and he said he was happy and that his was good.  then we said goodnight and got off the phone and what not.  then this morning i woke up and looked at my phone and there was a text message from him and it said.  ""odd.  i miss you and i was just with you today.  its worse than when im in sc. oy u ps u.""  sigh.  he is the love of my life.  haha oh yeah.  at my house he looked at me and hes like...ive never felt about a girl this way..and i was like...i think then, that this is a good time for me to tell you...that im a man. and he just laughed and said no youre not, and put his hands down my pants. and i was like...it hink you already knew that, and hes like..i thought id check again.  haha...not that his hands had been down my patns before...or had they???"

"event","i havent written in quite some time, but hey, its okay.  tennessee was okay...not as much fun as i had anticipated but thats okay. there were some really fun parts.  and we got 7th out of the world, so thats not too shabby if i do say so myself, which i do.  anyways.  schools almost over and im freaking out that i wont get all my work done in time.  that, would royally suck.  and finals, im scared about that too.  so i talked to glen, and im even more confused about our relationship than b4.  he's telling me he's hesitant about having a  long distance relationship agian beacuse all of the other ones hes had have screwed him up the backdoor.  and he admits that he doesnt think that i would do that to him just because of my ""personality.""  but hes still concerned.  and also, he kinda wants the next relationship that he's in to be a serious one...headed toward marriage. and then he started saying how he has seen guys dropping their wives off at high school.  and i was like...whoa killa, im not proposing. and he said he knew but he was just saying and he got all flustered or whatever.  i feel badly that he had all these plans for the future and a girl, especially me, wasnt in his plan. i say especially me because he actually wants to be with me.  so i feel badly that hes trying to decide where to put me in his life, because he doenst want to leave me behind, but he also wants to move forward and at this point in my life i really cant move forward.  so i told him this in a shortened version about how i was sorry that i was messing up his big plans for the future and he said he didnt have any big plans for the future and he asked if i was apologizing for making a new friend.  i said no, obviously. and all i could think about was the fact that he said friend. making a new friend.  is that all he wants me to be? im so confused...i just wanna ask him what i should do.  but he wont tell me...he beats around the bush and i just wanna mow the god damn bush down.  grrr. i love that boy.  and i wanan be with him, and it pisses me off that i cant and that he doesnt wanna be with me. but whatever, there is nothign i can do about it and i guess im okay with that. im just pissed...well not pissed but sad.  moving on.  the dance team's final performance was tonight.  it was really hard for me to sit there and watch them perform without me.  it really hurt. i just wanted to jump on stage and be like...wait for me.  also, i wanted to be critical of them like i always am, but i felt i had no place to.  i just wanted to say that they needed more energy and attitude, that they needed to define their moves more, but on the hip hop parts really funk them up and have attitude cause thats what hip hop is about.  i wanted to tell them to smile naturally and not like they were in pain. it was so hard for me.  luckily i was with mike and he makes me happy so it was okay.  speaking of...i hung out with mike today.  i had fun.  it was really nice to see him, i havent seen him in forever so it was nice. i love just cuddling with him cause hes so big and strong and he makes me feel safe.  and hes hot.  haha.  hes sooo much fun. im glad i got to see him.  we kissed.  lol i act like this is some big shocking thing, but we kiss everytime we see each other. but i felt massively guilty...but should i? i mean, this glen thing is fucked up.  i dont know if i shouldnt be doing anythign with other boys or what.  we have no official title so i dont know what i can and cant do. cause i certianly cant wait around forever for glen, especially if i dont even know whats going on.  he cant expect me to do that.  and mike has a gf.  sort of.  i dunno...whenever we arent together he has a gf...but whenever hes with me he has a sort of gf so its okay to kiss me.  so i feel guilty about that cause i know he has a gf and im helping him cheat on her and i feel guilty cause im sure shes not doing that to him.  or at least i hope not.  ::sigh::  why cant i just keep my hormones in my pants and become a nun. accept that glen doesnt wanna be with me and that i shouldnt be with any other guys cause im retarded.  ahhhhhhhh. i think im blowing this out of proportion however.  glen and i arent together, so its okay to do whatever i want with anyone else. my heart may be with him but that doesnt mean i cant have fun with other boys.  and if mikes okay with kissing me while he has a sort of g/f, then thats his problem not mine.  i shouldnt be responsible for his actions.  so its okay.  i kinda feel better once i put it in that perspective. now i just need to keep it there."

"event","so yes...as i sit here and avoid my homework as usual, i would just like to say...that i am happy.  i dont think i have ever been happy.  not like this.  im just normal right now i think.  and happy when i need to be and what not. it is the strangest feeling and i love it and never ever want it to go away.  despite my menstration i am totally happy.  its crazy.  i love it.  ive just been in a good mood and motivated to do work and im having fun doing school work and stuff and learning. i actually had a great time at the mfa.  i mean, i knew i would...but i felt happy...like i connected with what i was looking at. this is the greatest feeling.  ive been dancing around and singing and being silly and happy and all these amazing things i havent ever really experienced.  i just wanna run around and experience everything through a normal happy person's point of view.  cause everything is different now.  things that i have always done are completely diffrerent now and i enjoy them. its so weird to me and i cannot wait to take on the rest of the world feeling this good. i only hope that it will continue to last.  this feeling is too amazing to go away.  i think i will be more depressed if it goes away.  after having been given a taste of this feeling i dont want to lose it.  its too good. but i have bad luck like that. haha, oh well. well deal with it then, but right now, im just going to enjoy this.  and i only hope that everyone who has gone through similar things as i can one day feel as good as i feel right now.  to ashley, sheena, mike, devon, greg, louie, justine, amanda, emily, britney, melissa, tamra, heather, jeremy, amara, everyone else in HH, and most of all to alicia who needs this the most:  i hope that you are now, or one day doing well living the life you deserve, with love surounding you and happiness and good health.  i love you all very much and thank you for all that you have taught me.  i wish you all the best and hope that you never have to experience all that you have ever again.  good luck you guys, you're worth it.  and to HH staff, you are the most amazing people and i owe you my life, thank you for everything and i hope that you can make as large a difference in someone elses life as you have in mine.  and if you cannot, i can promise you that youre hard work was worth it...you saved one life, and thats all that you need to be truely rewarded.  
----------------------------------------------------------
on another note...  i went to the mfa and had a good time.  and the whole time all i could think about was glen.  i was just like...aww, glen would like this, i wanna go to a museum with glen. and then i just started thinking about all the things i wanna do with him.  i wanna go on picnics with glen, i wanna go on walks with glen, i wanna watch the stars with glen, i wanna fall asleep with glen, i wanna wake up to glen, i wanna snuggle on a couch in my pajamas while sipping tea and watching sponge bob with glen, i wanna sit and read a book with glen, i wanna go snowboarding with glen, i wanna have a snowball fight with glen, i wanna do all those fun things with him.  and as i thought i plopped myself down on a bench and held my head in my hands.  all i wanted to do was cry, but instead i picked my head up and looked at the huge painting in front of me.  and i just stared at it because it was eery.  it was a beautifully painted portrait of a young woman, who looked remarkably like me, who had obviously been crying, but there was a smile playing around her lips.  the color around the painting was faded and it got increasingly brighter until it reached her mouth and it was so vibrantly colored that it was hard to tear myself away from her mouth.  and at that moment i knew it would be okay.  i knew that i could love him as much as i do and want to be with him as much as i can and it will all work out. wheather it works out the way i plan it to now or not, eventually it will be okay.  i may only have an amazing friendship with him, and thats okay.  i think it would be so much worse having never met him.  but i know it will be okay.  i said goodbye to that painting, even though i felt completely rediculous, but i had to...that woman in that painting told me everything would be okay.  my glen situation would work itself out.  i left that painting in that room with all my fears reguarding glen.  and thats where they will stay."

"event","so yes...im super tired...what else is new.  and im avoiding homework...when i have a shit load of it and was crying because of it b4...i need to straighten out my priorities.  so yes...my weekend.  prom:  blew ass.  i guess not the prom itself because it was very nicely put together, well organized, the decorations were nice, food wasnt too shabby, unlimited soda bar (woohoo?!?!?!), nice wait staff, good turn out, all that stuff.  but my prom experience wasnt all that pleasant.  as you all know i didnt wanna go in the first place...but i went.  me and 8 of my freinds were gonna go in this limo we rented from LA limo but there were sudden time conflicts and then a fight between some of us and the limo company so we canceled with them the night b4 prom and amazingly booked another limo that would come on time and whatnot. however the morning of prom the limo place calls and tells us that the limo driver broke his foot and they have no other drivers.  so we have no limo.  and i get stuck with carlos...well sort of...i went with caitlin and carlos....but i liked going with cait...so i guess we were stuck with carlos. oh well.  so we go and get there.  we lose our table because of...well i dont feel like explaining. so the group that we all wanted to sit with got split up...and then cait, carlos, and i almost split up. but cait being a superb freind went to mrs. owens and said its either all of us split up or you let us all sit together cause there is no way we are gonna go two and one.  so they set me an extra spot at a table. cause im a big dateless loser.  and then i sat like a loser most of the night.  woohoo.  i slow danced with peder and cory.  haha...cory dunn...hes a character.  and peder and i were being glared at the whole time by michelle, but whatever...im getting used to her hating that were freinds by now.  and then everyone left early. and i had to listen to carlos bitch all night.  and i felt soo badly for kim and what happened so i tried to comfort her, but i think i failed miserably. but i tried. anyways... the good part of the night was when traci came and got me instead of me going to a party.  i had so much fun with her.  she bought me a super kick ass outfit to wear instead of my prom dress. haha tht woulda been funny. and i met her two most amazing freinds. kris and kevin.  they have reinstilled my faith in men.  they are very gentlemenly and super funny and nice. it was very refreshing. all four of us spent the weekend together and i loved every minute of it. i dont remember the last time i had that much fun doing absolutley nothing.  but they are great guys. and kevin has a geco!  its super cute and i wanna kidnap it. jk thats mean.  ill kidnap kevin.  haha jk thats mean too.  anyways...yes...thats a very very short summary of my amazing weekend minus prom.  im so happy that i could have spent it with those three people.  they made it great fun for me.  it was really nice of kevin and kris to be so welcoming and let me tag along with them all weekend. i kinda felt bad, but hopefully i didnt bother them too much.  besides...kevin has really nice grass."

"event","so yes...im going to prom. like it or not.  my mom, dad, and therapist told me i was going, and made me a deal. i must stay an hour after the grandmarch.  and then i may go home if i want.  i have a ""parachute"" my parents waiting for me to call.  so yeah...and my ride is the limo thats going to contain, kim, noah, austin, jess, cait, carlos, laura, james...and myself.  woohoo. we need to find a tenth person so the price of 60 dollars each doesnt increase.  however this task at this point seems impossible.  but the people in the limo is a good group.  it was so funny. i came back from therapy and kim calls me and shes like ""i have a question, and you dont have to answer right away, you can think about it, but you do have to tell me a little in advance. but anyways, i know you dont wanna go to the prom but if you do would you like to ride in our limo cause we really want you to go and we need someone else to come with us and..."" and here i interupt and say "" how much would i have to pay?"" and shes like ""60 dollars which isnt that much and you dont have to answer right away and dont feel like im pressuring you and"" and then i cut her off again and say ""okay youll get your 60 dollars"" and shes like ""its okay i understand you dont want to go but...  wait...youre coming?"" lol and then we discussed the details and what not but it was funny. its nice to know that people do care that about me and want me to go.  ive had so many people come up to me and tell me i should go and what not.  its really nice of them.  ::sigh:: so i call glen and talk to him for like...five seconds...all of which hes really distracted and not listening to me and then hes like hey i gotta go cause a bunch of friends are here...and i aws like okay..and he just hung up on me...i was like...ahhh and cried. cause thats what i do.  and then i couldnt not talk to him for four days...(this is four days later) so i called him and i talked to him for a bit...and then we were disconnected...so i waited a while and called him back again and we got disconnected again...so i waited a little longer and called him again...and once again...after a while we got disconnected...so i called back and got his voice mail...so i start crying cause hes hanging up on me and what not and im flipping out..so i call him and get his voice mail again and im like...okay are you having fone troubles or are you trying to ignore me...whatever i guess ill talk to you later or something.  so i cry and cry nd cry and cant take it anymore...cause when im upset i call him to talk to him...so i do. and he answers and i kinda repeat the above and hes like...oh no i just dont get very good service...so we talk and he starts getting all nice to me and im like...i just feel like you dont wanan talk to me anymore cause we never do and when we do we dont realy talk...like i have no idea whats going on in your life and you dont know whats going on in mine. so we fill each other in a bit and what not.  then he asks me what he should wear tonight and what not and we mix and match colors for a stunning outfit. haha i cant see it so im sure it looks like ass.  but whatever..it was fun. and he apologizes for beinga butt face and were all good and we say goodbye.  and i feel so much better...we talked for about a half an hour in that run.  and then today he calls me on his way back from florida...he went to a wedding...and we talked and he asks me to come drive to sc with him so he doesnt fall asleep.  at this point hes in alabama.  anyways...and then he has another call of the business nature so he has to let me go...but he actually calls me back when hes done! woohoo.  so im all happy and we talk somemore and then we say goodbye and he says he misses me. which is awesome because, most of the time i know he does, but sometimes i feel like he doesnt. he has trouble expressing his feelings and such.  so this is a big thing.  so ive been happy cause of that.  ugh...i had food poisoning...well thats what my mommy and daddy think.  bad salad.  also we had a di fundraiser...our spaghettie supper thingy...it went well i think....not enough people though. my dad said the way it was put together was worthy of a larger audience.  so thats kinda depressing but whatever.  i think we raked in a good amount of money for the people that were there. anyways...i should be doing my homework now...considering i have a shit load of it.  woooweee im screwed..."

"event","why am i crying.  its just prom.  its just not having a date. or a ride. or anything. wait make that having negative three dates. thats worse than not having a date. i dont wanna even ask anyone else for fear of getting turned down again.  its not worth it to me. i dotn even wanna go.  its just gonna be a big parade of pretty people all having a good time and being happy.  i would just blemish their good time.  theyd all feel bad for me and try and make me ahppy and i wouldnt and it would frustrate them. i dotn want to ruin anyone elses good time. i have a tendancy to do that. its junior prom, everyone should have a good time...so i dont need to ruin that for the people i love most.  i think ill just stay at home wearing my dress and eating ice cream in front of the tv with my mommy and daddy and precious.  maybe ill make someone older take me out to dinner or some such in my dress.  whatever...i could burn it too.  im such a loser.  never in a million years had i thought i wouldnt be able to find a date to prom.  not that im self centered or anything...but it never crossed my mind really.  i have a lot of guy friends...as far as i was concerned...if i wasnt still with nate id prolly go with zack.  or andy.  its hard to think that i got all excited for nothing.  i hate this.  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i have a headache."

"event","ugh...the one time that someone actually reads my journal, they find something to be offended by.  i had never meant for anyone to be offended.  its a journal, i just write down what im feeling.  im surprised that thats all anyone found to be offensive. not that anyone else ever reads this exept for traci and maria so they know whats going on in my life.  i keep forgetting that it is a possibility that someone other than those two might read it, most of the time i forget that they can read it.  its just my journal...i write what im feeling and thinking and what happens through the day; specially if something was bothering me...and that was. its just like if someone else had a journal that had a little lock on it that they hid under their mattress, you know?  in that you can write whatever and know that no one will see it...i just keep thinking thats what this is, but its not really.  if i had really thought about it...there is no way i would have put all that stuff in about killing myself.  wow i feel like shit. i hadnt meant for anyone to get hurt.  and i wasnt able to come back and talk to the person who was bothered by it.  but if she reads this again...im really sorry, and youre right, obviously you had no choice but to bring james home, i completely agree...i understood that at the time and now. and i dont think you were trying to hurt me on my birthday, i didnt think that then either, i was just upset cause everyone kept telling me negative stuff about everyone else and i was confused. thats why i wrote it all down in my journal, to sort stuff out.  i hadnt really expected anyone to read my journal or even really thought about it. im sorry.  i wasnt trying to rat anyone out or turn friends agains each other, most definitely not.  i made a mistake, and youre right it wasnt cool.  those things are okay to keep private but not public.  i should have thought about that earlier...i understand the damage is done now and that it was almost two months ago and hasnt caused problems until now, but i am gonna change the privacy setting so that no one but myself can see it.  wait..im not sure i can do that...but im going to attempt to do so.  im sorry it made you feel shitty...i didnt want to do that at all.  i didnt wanna do anything except sort out my thoughts and such.  
-----------------------------------------------------------
::sigh::  well, today was okay besides it not being okay.  i woke up this morning, played some tetris on my phone while lying in bed.  i talked to glen last night...i think i might have said that already somewhere b4, but whatever.  i got up and ate some donuts and watched pimp my ride.  then i went to my room for about a half hour and layed in bed.  i realized why i sleep so much.  cause i can be with him when im asleep. hes with me in my dreams. i know it sounds really sick and obsessive and scary but its true.  when i miss him so badly i sleep so i can be with him.  moving on.  so after i took my little power nap i went to walmart with mom to buy some essentials.  white out, new makeup, photo albums, and other such crap.  then she let me drive and we drove all over creation for about two hours.  finally we managed to find our way home and we stopped and picked up a pizza on the way home and ate it when we arrived back here.  then my mom got all pissy at me cause i dont go out enough anymore.  i was like...okay b4 you used to yell at me cause i went out to much, now i dont go out enough...what do you want from me?  well i thought this...but then outloud i was like (in my best mom voic), you are grounded from staying in this house.  apparently she thought this was hallarious.  anyways...so i went upstairs to call various people to mooch a hang out.  however it didnt really work.  but i did find out that andy is definitely going to prom with me.  thats cool..im excited...but i dont think he wants to come with me. he didnt sound very interested int he idea...but he said yes, so its his own fault.  so i cried when i got off the phone with him. cause i would have rather he just say no then come with me and not have a good time or whatever.  and its like...whats so wrong with me that two dates have dumped me and one more seems slightly less than pleased to be invited by me.  then i got over it...well not really but i moved past it for the moment.  and i just chilled out online and then sorted out my pictures and put them in albums and what not.  ::sigh:: i havent talked to glen today and i really need him.  i feel really really shitty. i dont feel like i belong anywhere.  or at least not here. i work as hard as i can just to make it here.  and its hard.  it takes so much out of me just to do my best to be liked and to do my best to do all my work and to do my best to be a good daughter and do my best to be a good friend and a good sister and do my chores and all the essentials to living like a normal person.  i just wish i didnt have to work so hard.  ive been working for so long to get better and im not and all i wanna do is feel okay.  i really just wanna be fixed.  i dont wanna hurt anymore.  i dotn wanna hurt anyone anymore. everything i touch turns to shit.  ive tried everything...ive gone through so many meds and so many combinations and so many psychiatrists and tried everything my therapist says to try and i went to the hospital and took as much out of it as i could.  i tried everything i learned and i try and use them as best as i can.  im trying i really am.  its not like im not trying to get better. i want to sooo badly.  it hurts to think that ive tried for so long and as hard as i can and have gotten no where. it doesnt really instill much hope for the future.  it might be easier for me to fight this if i had some hope left.  but i dont feel like there is anything to hope for.  there is nothing out there for me.  what is there to life if you cant be happy?   im sorry to those of you who read my journal and find it to be offensvie or scary or whatever.  im sorry if it causes you to get upset about things that happened months ago...cause that must mean its pretty sucky.  im sorry if it causes you to think that your friendships dont mean as much as you thought they did.  however im sure thats not the case.  what one person says in their journal is there perspective; it can be twisted.  everyone sees things differently; and if its coming from a fucked up person, its probably very skewed from reality.  so please, take what you read here lightly...and know that i hadnt in any way wanted to make anyone upset or second guess anything they had ever known about me or their friends or whatever.  im sorry...have a good night.  i hate this.  
Shut your fucking face uncle fucka~a~a~a...lol, laura thats for you...i love you."

"event","so yes, im not a sped...im just getting special treatment cause im a psycho.  and we won first place in DI woohoo and now we have to come up with 8000 dollars to go to knoxville tennessee.  last night was the seder in which traci accompanied me as she alwasy does.  which is good cause its mad boring.  so i love her and got to see her wich is awesome.  i love that girl. and i would like to state yet again for the record, that i am retarded. yes, i repeat....retarded. im stupid. im in love with a boy, who treats me amazingly well, who wants to be with me (as far as i know), hes intellegent, hes going somewhere in his life, hes got all this good stuff going on...yet i seem to think that getting attention from retards is an excellent idea. what?!?! am i on crack or something? just cause hes in SC does not mean that i cant wait for him.  and i swear to god...this is it...i cant be retarded anymore. im done with it. this is my last episode of retardedness. im calling jeremiah and telling him im sorry...but im in love with someone else...and hes a cool dude and all. but nope. im only one persons.  apparently from what ive heard he is either gonna get all stalkerish or a real asshole towards me.  oh dear. i get myself into stupid situations like this all the time. i have this uncanny ability to make guys who are romantics fall in love with me, and guys who are horn dogs wanna do me.  its amazing how that works. i dont get it. it works with all males except the ones i really realy want it too. omg...i had a dream that glen met this chick quinn (she was asian, not that that matters) and he fell in love with her like...right away. and forgot all about me. and then when i got to school matt (oh god lets not get me started on him right now, damn bastard that i love) kept saying that glen isnt coming back and that im not gonna see him again, and hes not gonna wait for me, and that hes gonna find some SC chick and all this shit. like seriously kept saying it. i wanted to cry. it was bad. and yeah. damn..im super stressed over so much. i just picked the fuck outta my face..now its all blotchy and swollen in spots. HOT!!! and ive been scratching my head again.  see, this sounds normal...except for the fact that i do this and pull chunks of hair out and make my head bleed and pull skin off my head. fun fun. also ive been pulling hair out of my legs with tweezers. its the most satisfying feeling in the world. yes, yes i am a very sick individual. but weve already established this. mmm a about two and a half months until i see glen.  two and a half. ive been waiting since what? january secondish?  i think i can handle two and a half more months. i hope.  however i shall only see him for maybe...an hour? but hey..its better than nothign right? right? damn i hope so.  i started to get a little worried about that today in english. we were talking about jay gatsby reuniting with daisy after five years and how how he had envisioned it was so much better than it actually was when they finally came to be together again. im hoping its not like that with glen and myself...i hope its ten times better than what i dream it to be.  ::sigh:: i cant wait to see him. the thought makes me happy. the damn bastard still hastn sent me his letter...the pooperscooper :)"

"event","okay so i dont only live for  glen...thats an exaggeration.  i live for my true friends as well. i live for my family. i live to graduate highschool and spit on the main entrance and laugh in its face and say ""haha you didnt beat me you bastard!""  i live to see if my boobs get any bigger...haha jk.  i live for all the fun times...like tonight.  and when nate and i watched the stars, and the fashion show, and the audition i went to with michelle, and the times spent with dennis, and adventures with the always freinds club, and naked time with mike, being one of the boys with peder, modeling for MBNA, all my funfilled times with traci (cause those are always a blast), my weekend with stephen, jenns wedding, caits 17th birthday celebration, my visits with maria as well as all the time we spent together when she lived here, the intervale posse, making my family laugh, DI, dance team (on occasion), lol spending time with glen and talking ""dirty"" online, that girls night in party i had that andy and matt crashed,  playing ping pong with mike at the hospital, meeting darius, all the times that kim, cait, and i hung out and laughed our asses off, all the shit like that.  the stuff that makes me smile and feel happy.  the stuff that i used to really value. i live for that. i just live to live because thats the thing to do. i live because i owe it to myself.  im not gonna let this depression beat me god damn it!  whos gonna take care of peder and michelles marital problems when im gone?  who is glen gonna call his pooperscooper?  what would my family do? who would be traci and marias oldest best freind?  who is gonna be the one everyone can look to for being nice and humanitarian?  what would everyone do without the saying ""shhh, shes jewish!""?  life wouldnt be the same without me.  who would mike turn to when hes having female problems? i cant kill myself.  theres too much to live for. i might not see the point in living all the time. but i couldnt do it to everyone else.  having tried and failed...seeing what it did to everyone around me shows me that i cannot actually succeed because there are too many people who it would affect in a negative way. i refuse to hurt people like that. im too nice for something like that. sometimes i think im too nice for my own good. but maybe my niceness keeping me alive is for my own good.  and who is gonna be the characteristic ""complainer?"""

"event","so..im going to be a sped.  cause im ""codeable"" what with my depression and all.   its become too hard to handle my school shit so they are gonna ""code"" me and make me a sped and get me special help and what not. in other words they think im retarded and i cant handle anything.  i dont even wanna think about any of this.  ive cried too much over it and my being stupid and all that shit. its not worth it. all i know is that i live each day to see glen. thats it.  all i want is to see him so badly...thats what keeps me going every day of my life.  day by day..i talk to him to keep me fueled...and just to see him is what keeps me strong.  or as strong as i can be in the cercumstances. i dont know whats wrong with me...i dont think i ever will. god damn it.  i hate this shit. its super shitty. its the shittiest damn shit ever.  grr.  i wanna die.  its easier. im okay with taking the easy way out on this one.  but i wont...i have to see glen. just once b4 i die. i have to see him.  
oh yeah...the chorus concert. that was a blast...our two day old chorus rocked the house.  it was hot.  lol and kinda funny.  and i met ali's boyfreind...not to shabby..im mighty impressed. i need to snag me one of those...cause the one im trying to snag...is to far away for the line to reach.  damn him."

"event","so yes...a wonderful 59 minutes and 53 seconds were spent on the phone talking to him.  woohoo.  it was kinda hard at first...i was nervous as usual and he knew that...he kinda figured it out and i told him.  but i got to talk to him and it made me happy cause we just talked...and we were silly like we always are.  when im not being retarded that is.  unfortunetly he caught me on a depressed day so i wasnt exactly the greatest to talk to.  but he said i was wonderful.  ::sigh::  its been so long since someone thought i was wonderful.  and it was a good convo...  and i miss him muchos.  i really really hope that one day we are together.  that would be nice...but till then...im okay

omg...i hate this... onestepcLOSER002: you just broke my heart in to 1000 pieces.  i hadnt meant to.  i just told him that glen and i had a thing. i feel horribly...i did like him at one point as more than a freind, its just..now i have glen.  or sort of.  i still love the kid as a freind.  why did he have to fall in love with me...why do i have to hurt everyone?  everything i touch turns to shit i swear to god.

"event","so yes...i suppose a lot has been going on.  but im not quite sure what or how to say it and what not...so ill just babble as im used to doing.  we did well on our DI comp.  2nd place...and we scored highest on our instant challenge in our division...we would have gotten first place, however our friggen machine didnt work gosh darn it.  but whatever...were still going to states. the bowlathon was okay i guess.  everyone else had a good time which i suppose is good...ive found latley that everything i used to be good at i suck at now.  it kinda blows.  but hey it happens.  ive also been thinking latley that i dotn know where i belong and that i dont have something uniquley special about me that people can identify me with.  like im not great at sports or a specific one.  im not overly talented in the musical area like singing or playing an instrument.  im not an amazing dancer or anything...just mediocre.  im not known for being funny.  all the other people that dont have at least that have great looks and popularity that people notice them for. im kinda just lost cause i dont have any of that.  i just want something that i can say...oh well im not so good at (insert here) but im good at this.  but i dont have that.  i have big boobs.  thats about it...im known for my breasts and being annoying and depressed...woohoo what a reputation...and now sleeping with jeremiah carter...which might i add, so did not happen.  i just feel really lost right now.  i wanna go to south carolina and be with glen and have lots of fun and be silly.  ive decided that im putting to much emphasis on this relationship that we dont have...im just gonna relax and have it be the way it always was.  fun and silly.  im just gonna enjoy being his freind and having him in my life...cause i love this kid...hes super.  he cracks me up.  and its great. im so glad that were freinds...and i guess thats all i really need from him...actually...i dont need anything from him.  hes a cool kid.  so there will be no more of this obsessing about him.  hes just a guy...like any other...except hes super special and i happen to be in love with him. but if he doesnt feel the same...imnot gonna die over it.  im just gonna accept it and move on. well be good buddies :)  ahh good times.  wow..i was super depressed all of like...five minutes ago now im happy.  just thinking about him cheers me up.  good times.   so im drinking green tea and im loving it...as usual.  and im trying not to think about all the shit that i have to get done in the next three weeks so that i may pass my classes.  all the work i have to make up...all the homework i will be getting.  all the afterschool activities i shall be partaking in.  all the appointments im going to have for my mental health issues...which might i add are piling up very gernerously.  there is a lot of stuff that must be done and im running out of days.  i also need to get in a shower sometime.  that would be imperitive.  ewwwy a booger just fell out of my nose! haha fun.  im at this point in my life where it becomes necessary to think about the future...now i have to say this is semi difficult for me.  to be honest, i thought id be dead by now and wouldnt have to worry about what i was gonna do after high school. and now comes the time where i must venture into that realm of thinking.  not fun.  i honestly thought i would have killed myself by now and that none of this after high school crap would matter. unfortunetly there are forces working against me that have kept me alive thus far, so my life is opening up into an endless sea of possibilities for my future.  so what the hell am i to do?  this is where i start thinking about what i wanna have as a career so that i might chose a major so that i may chose a college. however i have no goals or ambitions in life because i hadnt planned on getting this far. i dotn wanna do anything...except sleep maybe... i know...ill be a mattress tester! you dont need any schooling for that do you?  i dont think so...i bet id be good at that...although id sleep on anything.  so i guess thats out of the picture. i really love dancing, but thats more of a hobby than something i can make into a career.  as well as modeling...i dotn have the looks or body to be a professional model, nor the ambition or thick skin to get turned down so many times and keep trying.  im interested in editing and broadcasting and media and definitley radio and all that kinda of shit.  so maybe i could go into communications or something.  so i find some schools for communicatiosn and apply...then i get accepted...what if i get accepted to more than one...then what? i have to choose between them?  or what if i dont get accepted at all?  that would kinda blow..not that i really want to go to college or anything.  but if i dont what shall i do?  work at mcdonalds?  so if i go to school somewhere and i graduate...then what? find a job that has to do with communications? then lead a mundane life based around my career?  right...loads of fun.  and while all this is going on meet someone and get married?  thats so boring.  i dont want it.  what if i were to move to south carolina with glen and try and start a life out there? what would i do?  i dont know whats out there...or what i can do...itd take all my money just to get out there so i wouldnt be able to pay for what little i could pay for of college in the first place.  plus glens a vegitarian and i dont think it would work out well.  lol what that has to do with anything i have no clue... and this is assuming glen and i are involved...or are even freinds at this point.  (god i hope so).  so then what?  if i get married then comes children?  wont they get in the way of my career? but im willing to make that sacrifice i suppose.  but then this runs the risk of them getting depression like myself.  that would be awful...i do not want my children to be plagued with this horrible disease.  its not my idea of a gift to my offspring.  this is one of the major things that stops me from wanting to reproduce.  how in the hell would i deal with a depressed child...i can hardly deal with myself...and i know its so hard for my parents to deal with. plus i wouldnt want my husband to have to deal with a depressed child..it would be all my fault.  damn me.  and what happens if my family becomes poor, or was never well off to begin with? how will i cope with that?  i cant cope with it now?  there is to much shit to deal with in the future.  i cant handle it..i wish i were dead like i had planned...but no one will let me die.  i think the only things right now that keep me from killing myself are my family, glen, traci, and maria...and i suppose chocolate chip cookies and cookie dough ice cream are helping.  i could deal without my prom or graduation or getting married or having kids...i just want to stay alive for my family and traci and maria (and chocolate chip cookies and cookie dough ice cream) and to see what becomes of myself and glen if anything.  which...some days i think there will be...then others i think there wont...i mean..i want there to be, theres no doubt in that. but i dont think there will ever be a time when it makes sense.  we are in two completley different places, not only in physical location, but in our lives.  it makes no sense for us to be together...which kinda blows... but we will always be good friends. i hope.  and thats really all i can ask.  althogh i suppose i cant really ask for anything...i just have to let it happen because there is no one to ask.  grrrr.....................
so yes...whats going on?  i need to just pick a mood and stay with it...cause it keeps changing and its pissing me off. i just wanna be normal! i just wanna be happy.  i just wanna be ....nevermind..its not worth it anymore..nothing is...not now at least...please let it be worth it someday...please..."

"event","so yes...yesterday i beleive it was...i spoke to glen...i was in a blissful state...until i realized that i hadnt a thing to say to him...well actually i had too much to say to him.  i just didnt know what to say, where to start, how to say it, my mind just goes numb when i talk to him. i just sit there holding my phone with a big dopey grin on my face.  but then i started to cry when i said i missed him and we were about to say goodbye...and he knows cause he asks whats wrong...and i choke back tears and tlel him nothing...and then i get off the phone and im hysterical.. crying that is.  im just so hurt that i wont be able to see him till the summer and even then it will only be for like...a day..maybe only a couple hours...i guess i should be thaknful for that...and i dont understand why i cant go down and visit him...i need it soooo much...but my parents dont understand...and they never will...they are perfectly willing to ship my ass out there when i graduate highschool..but not a minute sooner, not even for vacation.  grrrr...so yeah..i cry and im starting to wonder if its even worth it anymore...and then i feel horribly for even thinking that crap...of course it is...its glen...hes worth everything.  hes too good for me even...poor boy...i dont see what he sees in me..but im not about to try and change his mind...damn im selfish...i really have been rather selfish in this whole thing.  i gave him my live journal address...prolly a bad idea...cause i had got to thinking earlier today that he doesnt know how psycho i am about him and all that stuff, cause i certainly dont tell him, and he doesnt read this, so he has no way of knowing...but now he will be able to read this...oh deary...this is slightly embarassing...hes gonna think that im this retarded sixteen year old girl...wait seventeen just kidding.  just this immature little girl who has a big crush...that will change within a matter of weeks...maybe thats what it is....i dont think that is the case...but i guess i dont know...ive been in love b4...there is no way to say i wasnt in love with nate...and this feeling i have for glen is more intense...what the fuck..i hate this...i swear to god...hes gonna read this shit and be like...what the fuck did i get myself into.  whatever..im dropping this subject for right now...i think im getting worse again...mentally i mean.  like im all of a sudden freaking out about this glen thing...this glen thing that doesnt really exist...like img etting clingy to someone who isnt even there...my relationship with him used to be fun...and now im fucking it up in my own head cause im afraid of losing him... but i know the more i push myself at him the more i will lose him.  i miss it when it was fun...but my insecurity is fucking everything up...so badly...ahhhhh. and school blows too and my stress level is rising extremely high and extremely fast.  and this DI thing...wouldnt be as bad as im blowing it up to be....like today i nearly had a panic attack cause i was so stressed about getting everything cleaned up but all the wet paint might get on stuff and all this crap...and we didnt get the curtains done...and then i was all upset that they went ahead and did the sign without me like im incapable or some shit...fuckers...lol jk...i love them...but they didnt give me a chance to do it. whatever...our comp is saturday...which im also upset that i cant go watch the dance team comp...im pissed...i wanted to go to it and watch...but i wanted to be in it even more...i hate this depression shit..i miss out on everything.  i looked in on my dance team from the windows on the doors seperating the gym and the hallway to the boys locker room and music room.  i was so proud of them they looked really good...well for us at least...well them i guess..im not really a part of it..and thats killing me..i wanna be with them through everything.  i hope they do well..i know they can...anyways.  and my mother is losing it as well...apparently when i went to the hospital she just stopped doing everything...i come back and the house is fricken trashed...and its still pretty bad...shes trying to clean it all up and shes stressing right the fuck out...and crying about everything and forgetting shit and then freaking out cause she cant remember anything anymore and cause shes old and that im a bad daughter but she still loves me and cause dads retarded and all this shit.  im just like..ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  i need to deal with myself b4 i can hold together my whole family.  i can hardly wake up each morning and go to school. and now im flipping out cause my room suddenly got to be a mess...starting from my disaster of a birthday party...and now its just accumulating...and its stressing me out but i have no energy to do it...no enegry to do anything...i dont even have energy to sleep.  im dying.  almost literally.  i just wanna be better...im living for the things worth looking forward to...DI comp, the bowlathon, the dance a thon, the pankcacke breakfast, prom, maine media camp, seeing glen, things like that...but its so hard..i keep looking for something to live for each week..but its getting really hard again. i just dont want to be here...i dont wanna be at this retardo school...in this retardo town with these retardo people..i just wanna be all bymyself on a little island where glen comes and visits me as well as my mom but leaves when she gets retardo.  i guess other people can visit me..but only visit...and i need some variety in the people that visit me...and i want there to be dasani waterfountains and huge lots of fatenning food that wont make you fat or clog your arteries. and i want a hugemungous bed for me thats got lots of pillows and blankets and is super comfy like sleeping on a cloud..not that i know what that feels like..but if i did i bet it would be nice...glen can come in it too...but no one else...just me and him. no other boys...i wont allow any other boys on my island besides family and strictly platonic freinds that i can promise will stay that way...so that means no peder...cause that didnt work out the other day...acutaly he can...cause thats not gonna happen again...taht was grossly wrong...that was like kissing my brother...wait i dont have one...anyways...and no one can be mean to each other on this island...adn there is no such thing as algebra or geometry.  and us history doesnt mean shit on my island...and john will come and sing and play his guitar for me....on my island i wont ever get sunburnt...i wont ever get hurt mentally or seriously physically.  i wont ever suffer from this retardo depression that comes for no good reason..ill be normal and get sad for normal people reasons.  it will be as perfect as perfect can get without being boringly perfect...and traci can come and live on my island...but she cant share glen...hes all mine on this island...and there will be a big carnival that only the people i want to come can come so there wont be super long lines. and itll be soooo muvh fun. and the stars will alwasy shine brightly and i can sleep as late as i want and i wont have to work unless i want to.  same with everyone who comes to my island.  and i will be pretty and ill have the energy and the confidence to run around and excersise and have fun. ill get rid of my flabby arms and my saggy butt and whatnot...maybe lose the tummy...all though thats fun to play with...and there will be a ""mall"" that all i have to do is think of what i want and ill get it.  this is my paradise.  and food will alawys be good and yummy...and i can have margaritas and all those other fruity mixed alcoholic drinks out by a pool...and ill look supe hot in a bathing suit...::sigh:: to bad this wont happen...nothing like this will ever happen because life blows and its not worth living anymore...it never was."

"event","so yeah...today was certainly better than yesterday... cause yesterday blew ass.  it was hard as usual to get through school today..but i kept thinking that tomorrow im going on the berkley college of music feild trip thingy and thursday is the shakespeare trip and firday is well...friday.  but then the trip for tomorrow is postponed cause of the snow...now i will be rippin if we have school tomorrow and no feild trip.  grrr.  but then we had DI and at first it was stressful...but then it got super funny when we attempted to run through it and do blocking and what not...some seriously funny shit there man.  oh god.  i was in stitches.  but then we had to be all serious and it was super stressful...but whatever...for the most part it was fun.  then it got to be even more fun after DI.  cait and i went outside to wait for my dad and danced around in the snow...and then went up to brandons car while he was cleaining the snow off and he played country music and cait and i were attempting a makeshift country line dance...then brandon joined us..and we all started fooling around and dancing and what not.  and then maggie drove down and turned on her rap and we danced to that while cait and brandon tried to country line dance to a slow country song.  and then we danced around geefully in the snowfall.  then they left and cait and i raced back to the entry way.  it was super fun.  one of those classic fun movie moment type things.  i live for those.  i dont know why...but i love them very much so. they are just fun.  but whatever...then i came home and was all manicy cause im retarded...and then had chinese food.  so all in all i guess it was an okay day...i miss those...okay days that is.  and glen..i miss him...but thats not the point of course.  however ive got another issue to bring up.  my retardedness. i have this tendancy to be retarded.  and get guys to fall in like/love with me...i dont know how i do it or why.  i dont mean to. well iguess in a sense i do.  just cause i wanna feel attractive and by doing what i do i make them like me therefor makeing me feel attractive and good. and then feeling shitty for doing so.  most of the people that do fall in whatever with me i dont try to get them too...only some people i attempt to do that.  currently i have way to many people who want to try and start something with me...and im just like..umm im in love with glen you bozos.  why do i make everything so complicated with my love life...or lack there of or whatever the hell it is. i dont even know anymore. its sorta strange. whatever..im trying to ignore everything...but jeremiah is apparently really interested in me now...ahh why am i stupid????"

"event","why am i so retarded? i hate it with a firey burning passion from hell.  it burns my ass..you know what else burns my ass? a flame about this high.  hahaha. so yes...some very interesting things have been happeneing.  this saturday i went with michelle to some modeling audition for babizon/IMTA thingy to go to a big convention or whatever...and we both got in..i was so nervous at the audition but i kicked ass.  i always do...jk. anyways. but it turns out it costs 5000 dollars...yeah so i was like..no way..besides its all just a big scam anyways.  ive got modeling i can do here. no worries. so then i slept over her house and we had fun together as usual.  the next day i got my progress report. not pretty.  mostly cause i still havent handed everything that i missed while i was in the hospital. so my mom got all retarded about it and i explained most of it to her...and then i started getting all upset and crying about how i hate it here and how i want to leave. and she asked me if i wanted to quit school or if i wanted to go live with aunt bette.  i was just really confused. i dont know what i wanna do.  well i kinda do..i wanna be with glen but thats not an option at the moment.  anyways...so i leave michelles house sunday and find out i got into the modeling thingy.  and then i went to peders.  john and alex picked me up, and the second i get in the car john starts hitting on me...not that i find this unusual...cause he normally does.  so i get to peders with them...we chill out there watching movies and peder is flirting with me cause he can now..being single and all.  and then hes like...telling john how hell never get a piece from me so im like...okay peder..heres your piece..and i kissed him on the lips just a little peck...so he gets all happy and shtuff. and then john starts to get pissy...but comes and lays down next to me on the bed and starts to get all frisky with me...and asking me to do stuff with him for his birthday..and im like..haha no and gave him a kiss on the cheek and was like this is all your gonna get bitch.  and then he starts to attempt to get some booby touchage and he goes to kiss me and then turns his head...like fifty kagillion times...and then peders like...he has a girlfriend..and i was like whoa...thats nice to know...after you just told me you wanted to do me or ""rail me hard"" lol...boys.  so then the day progresses and peder and i are being silly together cause thats what we do...and he decides since i kissed him once we can keep kissing each other randomly...and all of a sudden its getting more intense and i just pulled away and was like...""whoa...weird...what the hell are we doing"" so thankfully that stopped.  i was totally weirded out...but then i was like...wait..its peder...i could prolly have sex wtih him just cause im so comfy with him...but i dont plan to...dont get me wrong...i just love the boy to death...but in a strictly platonic way...ewwwy...i cant believe that happened...super weird...well i guess it was gonna happen eventually...haha im acting like we made out or smoething...which we didnt...no worries my faithful readers. that would be gross.  anyways...so yes...then jeremiah comes over...and when he walks in peder strategically places my underwear so its hanging out and all sexy like cause its a cool thong, just to see how many times jeremiah looks.  well he looked a lot..and it was super funny. so peder and i were laughing about that...and then jeremiah keeps staring at me...cause hes sitting next to me on the bed on my right and im laying down and peder is laying down on my left...(just trying to set the stage). so yeah...he keeps staring at me...and then looking at my ass..then looking at my face and looking at my ass..and i was like..would you stop looking at it (referring to my butt) and hes like...i cant help it its so nice.  and him and peder get into a deep convorsation about my attractivness.  apparently...ive got the tits, the ass, and the body to go along with it...im like...glad you noticed my face and personality. but faces.  and then jeremiah continues to stare at me...and im like...what? and he just looks at me and is like ""oh the things i would do"" so i start laughing..cause what do you say to that...and then he looks at me again and im like ""what now"" and hes like...""lip gloss"" and i was like...""what?!?!"" and he proceeds to tell me that it makes my lips look ..""so sexy"" so im just like...wow..this kid has not stopped staring at me since he got here...and hes alwasy hit on me b4..but now its like massively bad...and i was feeling badly about myself just cause i was in a depressed mood about my progress report and school and all that happy crappy and i missed glen and what not...so i was just like...damn...this kid thinks im attractive...how often does this happen...completely forgetting that a couple hours b4 that i had both peder and john hitting on me.  so the next thing i know were all like..making out and shit...so today i feel like crap...cause im so retarded...and peder and john made fun of me and i was just like...shut the hell up.  and then i was crying all day today cause of that and cause i miss glen and cause of school and cause of being alive and cause of everything...and john kept hugging me and kissing me (not on the mouth) and talking to me and making sure i was okay and what not.  lol...and then later today he threw me upagainst the lockers and started humping me...but thats besides the point...he was just being super cool and i super appreciated it.  but above all this i feel utterly guilty about kissing jeremiah...i love glen...more than anything in the world...but i know that we arent committed to one another...but my heart is...i may be with all these other boys for short periods of time just cause they make me feel attractive and i dont get that often...but glen has my heart. whenever im with him i feel beautiful and wanted and all that stuff...i wouldnt need anything else from anyone...and even if we were to be together in the mental sense i wouldnt need this retarded fulfillment from these random boys...but we arent together now...and all i want is some form of affection...no one gives me any other than the physical affection that you see on dirty moives...to all these people thats all i am...i want more than that.  but i cant get it..not now...especially since i can never talk to glen anymore.  when i could i didnt need anything like that.  i dont need it now i guess..i just want something.  something in my life is missing and im trying to find it in all the wrong ways.  i think its glen that im  missing...but i cant blame him for my retardedness...and my constant need for attention from those of the male gender...i just wanna feel loved and attractive..and if the only way i can do that is by seducing men...thats the way im gonna do it...but i dotn want to..it makes me cry...it makes me feel horrible..it makes me get called a slut...it makes my chances with glen even smaller...it makes me feel guilty about glen...cause im sure hes not doing this with othre girls...i know i would die if i found out that hes been kissing around with girls...i cant imagine what its gonna be like if he finds out..not that i plan on keeping this from him..im just not sure how to say it...cause my excuses arent good enough. oh man...i wanna be with him so badly...i got to talk to him saturday...i just about blew a load in my pants...lol...i swear to god...its so hard to breath and think when im around him or talk to him...i feel so stupid cause i cant say anything...im just like...stupid... he makes me dumb...lol i love it...i love the way he makes me feel.  it really turns me on. haha.. wow..im a dork...just thinking about him makes me smile...but then makes me cry cause i cant be with him.  but under it all im happy just cause i have him in my life and i know him.  this kid makes me exstatic...i was so happy to hear from him saturday.  you have no idea. i was just blissful...had no idea what to say...but so happy.  lol...he must think im retarded...im so worried about him losing interest in me...cause right now hes the only good thing i have in my life..and i feel like hes slipping away from me...and i would not like that at all...im not obsessed...i wouldnt go jump offa  bridge somewhere if he didnt like me anymore...id get over it... but i would be the happiest girl alive knowing that i was his.  that would be the only thing id need to know...i wouldnt care if other people found me attractive cause id only be his..i owuldnt need to impress anyone else. but being worried taht he doesnt want me makes me feel as though i need to keep my options open..which i suppose i do...but at the same time i dotn want to...cause that makes the chances of us not being together more realistic...wow im such a little girl..he makes me feel like that...he makes me feel all jelloey.  ima crack head.  and i miss the boy...and i wanna be with him...not anyone else...just him.  im in love with him...is that so wrong???"

"event","so yes...yesterday i was talking to my mom about how i hadnt talked to him in quite some time and i missed him a super lot. and she starts talking to me with her motherly pearls of ""wisdom"" and says to me, ""you know bethany, i dont want you to get your hopes up about this and maybe you should prepare yourself for the worst."" im like...oh what the hell.  there is no way that this amazing of a person could do that to me....no possible way.  hes too great to do that much of a common male thing.  and then she throws in, ""if he really cared he would have gotten in touch with you by now."" so that really got me all even more paranoid than i was b4.  and i say to her ""but mom, he cant go from contemplating loving me to ignoring me...it doesnt work like that."" and then she proceeds to tell me that ""boys work very differently from girls...they can go from being in love with someone to wanting to not talk to them ever again very easily.  so i just dont want you to get your hopes up...because he might not call you.""  so this makes me start freaking out...internally of course...and i start to get really worried that he doesnt wanna talk to me anymore...and that something i said in my letter to him freaked him out or something random that would throw a boy off. so i get online and check my email which i have been doing religiously since i havent heard from him and there in my inbox is the most beautiful sight in the world.  a wonderful little message from the most amazing person i know.  my heart just lept into my throat...luckily i pushed that bad boy back down before i coughed it up or soemthing...cause that would be horribly ironic.  so thank goodness for small favors.  so i open it up and he reassures me that he would never not want to talk to me and how silly i was for being so retarded...well he didnt word it like that of course.  hes too nice for that.  so yeah... and he tells me hes been working third shift so that he hasnt been up to call me when id be up, and he hasnt had the right time to go to the post office to mail the letter he wrote to me cause it is so inconviniently not open at night.  damn those bastards.  so this means a few things....the most important...he has a job!!!! woohoo, go him.  he needs that. im so glad for him...he can actually live somewhat now.  thank goodness...thats horribly important. another thing it means is that he wrote me a letter...which is always good...and another thing it means is that he doesnt hate me.  lol he also informed me that he thinks that when i was a baby i never cried, only laughed and peed my pants...haha i love this boy."

"event","*I'm finding my way back to you
And everything I used to be
And waiting is all that I can do
Until you find your way back to me
*Please don't drive me home tonight,
'Cause I don't want to feel alone,
Please don't drive me home tonight
'Cause I don't wanna go
*So one of these days
I won't be afraid of staying with you
I hope and I pray
Waiting to find a way back to you
'Cause that's where I'm home
*There's something 'bout the way
You looked at me
Made me think for a moment that
Maybe we were meant to be
Living our lives separately
*If tomorrow never comes
I would want just one thing
I would tell it to the stars and the sun
I would write it for the world to see
And it's you
The light changes when you're in the room
Oh it's you
*I missed you so much that I begged you to fly here to see me
You must have broke down because you finally said that you would
But now that you're here I just feel like I'm constantly dreaming
Cause something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good
*You're like my favourite damn disease
*My hopes are so high,
that your kiss might kill me.
So won't you kill me,
so I die happy.
*I'll be true, I'll be useful...
I'll be cavalier...I'll be yours my dear.
And I'll belong to you...
*And I said ""I've gotta be honest
I've been waiting for you all my life.""
For so long I thought I was asylum bound,
But just seeing you makes me think twice.
And being with you here makes me sane,
I fear I'll go crazy if you leave my side.
*Just hold me close to you
*I believe in you so much
I could die for the words that you say
But, I believe in you so much
I could die from the words that you say
*you wear sandals in the snow
and a smile that won't wash away
*oh you're so beautiful
with an edge and a charm
but so careful
when I'm in your arms
* I'm empty since you left me
trying to find a way to carry on
*the yearning to be near you
I do what I have to do
but I have the sense to recognize
That I don't know how
to let you go
*You take me in
no questions asked
you strip away the ugliness
that surrounds me
*I only hope
that I won't disappoint you
when I'm down here
on my knees
*Oh and every time I'm close to you
there's too much I can't say
and you just walk away
And I forgot
to tell you
I love you
and the night's
too long
and cold here
without you
*I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we shared
Makes me wish that you were here
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
*If you got no one and I got no place to go
Would it be alright? Could it be alright?
*You do something to me that i can't explain.
So would i be out of line if i said,
I miss you?
*I know i'll see you again
Whether far or soon.
But i need you to know that i care
And i miss you.
*How do you do it, make me feel like I do
How do you do it, its better than I ever knew
*I, wish you were here
*I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
*There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
*Then you came around me,
The walls just disappeared.
Nothing to surround me,
To keep me from my fears
I'm unprotected
See how I've opened up
You've made me trust
*Cuz I've never felt like this before
I'm naked... around you
Does it show?
You see right through me
And I can't hide
I'm naked... around you
And it feels so right...
*Won't you, take me by the hand, take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are but I, I'm with you
*I watched the station
Saw the bus pulling through
And I don't mind saying
A part of me left with you"

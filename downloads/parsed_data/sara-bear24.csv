Lucky for me UCI hosts free movie sneak previews every now and then. A couple of weeks ago Stefany and I went to see ""Alfie."" Pretty good movie. Hot Jude Law. Then last night we went with four other girls to see ""National Treasure."" For a PG Disney movie it is pretty good. Some corny parts but I would still recomend it. It comes out Friday.

My list of upcoming events:

1. Thursday: 4 classes, a job interview at the bookstore, and a possible club meeting

2. Friday: Need to write a paper

3. Saturday: Giving prospective students and their parents tours of Middle Earth (my dorm complex)and my dorm room from noon until 4

4. Sunday: Need to study and do homework (midterms in a week)

Thats about it. Doesn't seem like much but I am a little overwhelmed. Which brings up the famous question. I know you can be overwhelmed and underwhelmed but can you just be whelmed? Ya anyways I should be fine.


By the way I need to add that my suite rocks. We have so overdone it with the Halloween decorations. Our hallway looks great.

I had a brilliant idea the other day. Since Halloween is coming up and I am not looking to spend money on a costume I have devised a plan that will only involve the clothes I already have and maybe some of my suitemates' clothing.
If Anna, Stefany, and Tami( a girl in my suite) want to, we could so pull off the cast of Sex and the City. It shall be great.

Anywhoo.....back to studying for me."

So not much has been happening lately. I finsihed a 500 page book that I have to have read for one of my classes tomorrow, atleast it was interesting. Then of course there is the random other homework but nothing has been too difficult yet.

Ya it kind of freaks me out that I have only been in class for barely 2 weeks now and I already have midterms in 3 weeks. Ahh the joys of the UC quarter system. 

The one thing that has excited me lately is that there is a vendor sale thingy this week on campus. All these businesses come and sell posters, shoes, clothes, purses, jewlery, and watches and for the most part they are all pretty cheep. I am going to buy a $10 pair of shoes tomorrow.

I love all my suite mates, they are so great. One of the girls, Jennifer who is from Elk Grove got into Tri Delta this week. I am so excited to hear about all the sorority stories. Apparently Tri Delta is also supposed to be the ""Barbie Doll/slutty"" sorority so the stories should be extra juicy.

And just to let you all know I am taking a ballroom dancing class with some of my suitemates at the ARC (Anteater Recreation Center) so by Thanksgiving break I should be somewhat skilled in the art of partner dancing...at least I hope so.

Well I am off to get ready for bed, I have an early class tomorrow. Damn English!

Guess what I heard on the 10 o'clock news.
Earthquake experts expect a 6.0 (or bigger) earthquake in southern california/LA area by at least the end of the week (Sept 5th) and if not then they expect it sometime soon after. There is a 50% chance for the earthquake and while that might not seem so bad, the percentage is usually only 10%-15%.

Considering myself and many other people will be moving in to college soon and the fact that many people are already down there I hope nothing happens."

After moving in at UCI on Sept 18th or 19th, the remainder of the week (Monday-Thursday) is ""Welcome Week"" with a lot of activities and getting introduced to the school stuff. Oddly enough the first day of class is Friday and I only have one class. That night from 9-1am is their annual FOAM dance. Thats right foam. I don't really know what to make of it but I am sure it feels like you are dancing in a huge washing machine. Wrapping up the week is Saturday night where everyone is invited to ""Pirates in the Park."" In other words they are going to set up a huge screen in Aldrich Park (the center of the campus) and will be showing Pirates of the Carribean. Everyone is supposed to wear their pjs and bring blankets to lay on the lawn with. I think it will be fun and it will be a good opportunity to meet new people."

"event","Well the past few days have been hellish. At UC Irvine we are given certian days and times when our ""enrollment window"" opens (in other words, when we can sign up for classes.) Anyways I must have been given one of the very last days to sign up because a lot of the classes I wanted to take were full. Today at 9:30 I signed up for my classes. I am taking 12-14 units and I am on a waiting list for my English class which if no seats become avaliable I will have to take in the winter quarter. I am resonably happy with my schedule and I am so grateful that my enrollment window opened at 9:30 because by noon everything I signed up for was full. Ahh relief.

The only thing that brightened my day today was going to the mall where I found and purchased a black and white checkered jansport backpack. I really like it and I got the last one.

Well I will be off in a while to go to the fair with my sister where I plan on watching ""Yolo Idol"" at 7pm. It should be great watching fellow Woodlanders making fools of themselves. Good stuff."

I hate mosquitos. Two bites on the back of my right leg, one on the back of my left leg, and one right on the side of my right foot. Make it end.


Just to add to my pain, I got a letter from UCI yesterday concerning my medical history. They are pretty easy forms to fill out except for one. This said letter needs to be filled out by my doctor regarding hepatitis B shots, baby shots, and what not. Well since I haven't been to my doctor in atleast 4 years I have to have a meedical visit (aka a physical) before he can fill out the forms. 

So for me August 31st will be the day from hell. To most of you a visit to the doctor may seem like nothing and you probably all think I am over reacting but I hate the hospital. Besides the usual unpleasanties of a physical, a physical with my doctor usually requires a blood test which involves a needle. Yes I am sure many of you are thinking ""wow, you are such a wimp!"" Well I will admit, when it comes to a needle entering my body, especially in my arm in a vein (ahh) I am the biggest wimp in the world.

Ya, whats new. I have been to that city once a year (if not twice) since I was like 8 years old. Not that I don't fully enjoy sin city, it just gets boring at times. However this trip will be different because I get the pleasure of having Stefany accompany us. 

Whenever I bring someone on vacation with my family it looks badly on my mom. For example when we took Cristina a couple of years ago it looked like my mom had a brunnette daughter, a blonde daughter, and a hispanic daughter. Then of course when we took Patty and when we take Stefany this time, my mom will also have a red headed daughter. Ya it makes it look like my mom gets around (if you know what I mean). It should be a fun trip...Las Vegas has yet to experiance the Raptor. The city may never be the same.

Well I have done nothing productive today and I think I will continue on with that. I will return to my state of boredom. Farewell...."

We went to Erinn's where upon we see Marcail (such a sweet girl). Later Sierra, Lisa, and ""Phones"" came over and Sierra and I tried desperatly to drown Stefany in the pool. What can I say...conspiring minds think alike.

At 9 we left to go see the fireworks at the high school. We got there late so we just sat on the perimeter of the school on Woodland Ave. Apparently a dangerous spot as quite a few large flying embers from the fireworks would land where we were sitting and one almost hit Sierra in the leg.

After that we went to Shannon's and hung out for a while watching Family Guy, good times. After that I had Stefany take me home where I watched tv until 3:30 in the morning when I finally decided to go to sleep.

Then we went to Shannon's where we spent the night with Clarisita and Katie P. We watched Euro-Trip which all in all I guess was a pretty humorous movie but word of warning to any of you who haven't seen it...
1. Watch it without any regard of sensibility b/c somethings won't make sense
2. I am sure you have all seen female nudity in movies (Old School, Titanic, etc) all I can say is I never thought I would ever see a movie where they showed male frontal nudity. Guess what? I found one.

Well I am off again to continue my viewing of the first season of Will and Grace. Stefany gave it to me for my birthday and I am pretty much done with all the episodes. I love that show. It does for me what Sex and the City does for Katie R. and Anna.

Side note: I just realized in my somewhat small entry that I talked about three Katies. Wow, amazing."

"event","So, Friday was pretty boring for me. Not all that much excitment even though I was out of the house the entire day. Around 8 Stefany and I went to Erinn's house to watch Old School. As most of you know DVDs are broken down into scenes. Well Old School has 20 scenes and our DVD stopped working at scene 19. So the 3 of us got in Erinn's rather large truck and headed to Blockbuster to give them the what for. After returning to Erinn's we finished the last 10 minutes of the movie and then parted ways. Its always good times hanging out with Erinn.

If any of you want to hang out I am in deperate need of companionship."

"event","Well today was the last day of high school...ever. Not really what I expected it to be. 

For the most part today was a pretty crappy day. Quite a few things and a few people pissed me off. However the day ended on a good note when I found out I passed the subject A exam, I got $100 just today for graduation from various family members, and I watched a very funny movie with my mom.

I wish my last day in high school could have been better. Thanks to those of you who did make me smile today. You are the ones I will miss most next year.

Just as a side note I would like to add that Spencer's little apartment type thingy is the coolest thing I have ever seen. If I were you I would never want to leave."

"event","Thank you all for your concern. My dad's health is always flucuating. He is going to the doctor's tomorrow to find out exactly what is wrong. 

Anyways today I went to Kohls in Truxel with my mom. Let me tell you that is a wonderful store. I got a new bathing suit...and its pretty too!

I got some bad news today. I guess I am not going to be voted biggest class flirt. Oh well, it was my dream and life's ambition to be 2004 class whore. I am so dissapointed. Perhaps we shall petition.

Tomorrow is our last lunch at WHS. I hope you guys enjoy your lunch. I am definitly going to enjoy mine."

"event","Well while I did have the best time at prom and everything had been looking brighter (school ending, the excitment of college) my life has hit yet another bump in the road.

My dad's health isn't all that great right now (and I am not talking about a cold.) This of course is freaking my mom out and putting a lot of pressure on me to make sure she stays calm and doesn't have anymore undue stress. So please excuse me if I am not pleasant when I see you at school.

Then of course I made another realization about my life. I realized something is missing in it that I really want. However I don't feel comfortable sharing it with everyone. Sorry."

"event","So prom was last night. I had a lot of fun...I hope you all did too.

I am glad I went with the group I did and I am glad Zack was my date. Those two things were probably the greatest reasons I enjoyed prom.

Other things I enjoyed:

* The ghettoness of our limo (I have pictures...words could not do it justice. You all have no idea just how ghetto it was. Ask me if you want full details. It was no ones fault but the limo company's.)
* The resturant/Troy/our own little room (good choice Amanda)
* Joey's idea that our limo driver was a mass murderer and just looks for people to pick up on prom night
* Freebourn Hall
* The fact that you could walk through a crowd on the dance floor and smell alcohol (I think we were the only sober ones there. Do people not want to remember their senior prom?)
* Joey's dancing
* Zack's singing
* Calvin's haircut
* All the work the guys put into cleaning up the fire house, I was very impressed (sorry it wasn't as much fun as you thought it would be)

The one thing I regret is that we were all so tired and needed to go home. I wish we could have hung out together longer."

Moving on...all I can say is that Amanda has done it again. She sure knows how to throw a great party. I think the most entertaining was the pinata (which went out in one hit), the ""dancing"", and most of all red rover red rover. Great party Amanda. I wish we could do it again."

"event","Well there's been a lot of drama going on lately. A whole lot of it. I am not going to say I hate it because at some points it can be pretty entertaining. Not much has been happening with me lately. Today I filled out my housing stuff on the internet for UCI, so I guess I am good to go for that.

Well everything is right around the corner: Prom, graduation, grad night (which I don't know yet if I am going), and yes even college. Thats some crazy stuff.

Anyways lunch with Zack tomorrow....good times.

Goodnight All"

Besides that...thanks for a nice trip Amanda."

"event","Goodbye Calculus!!! Thats right for all you AP test takers, today was the last Calculus/math test we will ever have to endure at WHS. Yay!!! This is the first time I will ever get 100% on a math final. That was $82 well spent, let me tell you.
I don't think I can explain to you the hatred I have towards physics right now. It has nothing to do with the Mish it is just physics in general.

Well this is my weekend...not too eventful. Call if you want to do something

Friday: Perhaps venture outside my house.

Sat: Maybe go to Sac with Amanda/Homework/Birthday party

Sun: Going to the land of the cow ""Vacaville"" with my mom."

I am starting to get nervous about the end of the school year (prom, graduation,finals etc.) I don't really know why I am nervous I just am. I hope everything will just slow down these next 5 weeks so I can enjoy the rest of my senior year."

"event","Well dance, the AP test, and the Subject A exam are all finally over. Yay!!!! Most of you know that I was really the only one that didn't cry friday night at the recital...well now that it is actually over, forever, I have gone into slight depression. The ending of my 9 year run in dance has finally hit me and I am extremely sad. I wish it wasn't over. It will be one of the things I will miss most next year.

I wish summer would hurry and come. This week with three tests, three picture appointments, transcripts, and a band concert is going to be busy.

On a happier note, happy (late)18th birthday Shannon!!! I hope tryouts went well."

Anyways dance starts up again tonight and suprisingly I have no homework. Yay! It should be interesting tomorrow night because so many people I know are coming and of course sitting front row center which is nerve racking. Damn you and your attempt to make me screw up. j/k

Oh and on a side note, let me just say that Apples to Apples is only the best game ever. I can't wait to play again tomorrow. Hours of fun, let me tell you."

I decided to blow off the rest of the day which really only consisted of government and go home. While at home Stefany and I decided to make the one thing for lunch we know how to cook...Boboli pizza. And now I sit here on my bed getting up the energy to do this damn poetry assignment which I need to finish today since dance starts up again tomorrow and I will have almost no time or energy to do my homework then. Anyways I better go...anyone that wants to should come to our dance recital. Trust me you'll laugh, you'll cry......."

Yes thats right my Calculus friends, the day from hell. I wish everyone luck, myself included."

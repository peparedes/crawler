I am student of the month for 8A for most motivated. It was fun cuz we (the other students of the months and I) got a bunch of free stuff and we got to pose for the pictures that are gonna be on display, and since we were the most motivated students we did the opposite and posed lazily.lol. it was fun and i got to take a nap on the couch in the teachers lounge lol. <br>
I got 5 A+'s and 1 A on my report card. <br>
My GPA is 4.275 but it's lower than my last GPA so i'm mad lol. <br>

I picked the lettuce stalks and killed these big spiders, that was kinda fun. Even though I felt like a dork steping on the spiders and screaming at the same time.  Any way, then I TRIED to pick oakra (however you spell it) but I wasn't doing very well at that so sarah and alyson. That didn't take long so after that we started picking berries or something. I don't remember what they're called. That was really fun. I never knew that picking berries, or whatever, could be so much fun. And on the way back we went by this house that was covered with stuffed animals and dolls that were like nailed to the house or something but it kinda freaked me out a little bit. Anyway it was an awesome day, but I gotta go enjoy the rest of it."

I'm wondering if he'll eat it all. The other two guys he went with also got bears but one of them only got a little cub bear so nothing much to celebrate about that. I feal kinda sorry that it was only a youngster though. When my dad got home at 7am he slept until 6:00pm. Almost 12hours straight but I can't blame him after being awake for 28 hours including the 12hour drive home! I would've fell asleep at the wheel. At first when my dad never called I was worried that something happened to hime because no one told me he called the first day! Well other than that  nothing much happened."

"event","Well My dad left for his trip at eleven last night. I gave him a little note to read when he gets there and a little present. Since he is going to Canada I gave him all of my canadian change I had been saving. But ever since like a week or two ago I've been having this feeling that something bad is going to happen. And I can't seem to get rid of it until my dad is back here where I can see he's not injured. 
But to try and keep my mind off things I have been writing a book and it's similar to a dream I had a few days ago. And when daddy left he gave mom some money take me to the theatre. Well that's it for this entry. Later"

"event","Okay so mom finally went to the dentist after all of these years and today she got a root canal and a tooth pulled. I know you're thinking ooowwww right? She came back just fine no pain at all.In fact the first day she went there this 4yr old had a root canal  and he came out smiling and laughing! I couldn't believe it! So from now on I'm going to that dentist because I'm a wuss when it comes to pain! I hate needles. My mom's Birthday is coming up soon. I don't know what to get her. I didn't save much money but I have to decide fast so I know where to go to the present. I wish it was easy shopping for people. I'll write more soon after the sleep over mom planned with Alyssa on Wednsday. Alyssa only about 4 or 5 and it's her first sleepover at someone's house besides her family. This should be interesting. I hope it goes well."

If my mom takes me out to lunch that day I want to go to pizza hut! My favorite pizza place and favorite fast food place!!! I love it. Last year sarah and I met up there which was strange and we found out we only had one class together. Band. I hope we have learning power together or lunch!!!! Lunch would be awesome. but that's means she would have to get my team and that might be difficult. I hope which ever team sarah gets that SHE'S happy with it. See you next year sarah!

"event","Well sarah came over today on the phone it felt like me and her were giving eachother hints so I finally kinda sorta asked if she wanted to come over. First we went in the pool and she actually swam underwater. That was a big step for her. I tried to teach her before but I made up retarted moves like bunny hop. It was so wierd anyway back on this day.
Once we were done we had a picnic outside and sarah couldn't eat the rest of her fudgebar so she threw it by the mouse who in the flowers. Then we decided to go for another swim so we were trying out all of these stunts and half of them didn't work! THen we tried to guess what eachother were saying under water we never got that right. After we got out of the pool we went to see if the mice were out and they took the fudgebar!! Stick and icecream That was funny. Then she had to go home. Read more in my next entrie. Bye!"

He's more stessed it seems like. He got a really bad injury on his hand and I'm nervous that he might get injured on that trip somehow. I just have a bad feeling. But I want him to go on this trip because he spent a lot of money on it and he loves hunting. So I just he has a great time because he took our week long vacation for himself and if he doesn't get I bear I'm going to be so mad. Look in my other two entries for more."

"event","Well today was a simple boring old day. I woke up at 8:00 and went on the computer.The tv was off so there wasn't much to do but I decided to do a craft with the supplies I got from arts and scraps.It looks really cool and I'm still not done yet but it's really turning out great. After that I made myself some chicken noodle soup and the tv was on so I watched animal planet.An hour later my mom came home with KFC. After she left I had to clean up the house as usual and then I decided to go outback and water the flowers for mom and I fed the dogs.
When mom and Lisa, my sister, get home they might go work out so I might get to go to the Warren city aquatic pool. That will be fun! And I also forgot I put some books on hold from the library so I need to go pick those up or they'l send them back to the other library."

"event","Then of the program picnic was today. I brought my friend sarah Robb.They had a huge slip n slide there. It's was awesome but not all that slippery. I slid on my knees a few times. It makes you go faster. But you have to get your knees over the platform thingy. Then we went back inside and played a game of chess but sarah Z's cousin Justin kept messing up the board and taking the pieces. But I won 2 out of 3 games. That was fun. They served pizza for lunch and pop and carmel filled candy kisses. I love those don't you? Then we had to get up in front of everyone and sing our songs. My favorite goes like this

Mine was shaped like a peanut so I named him postachio. That's how I spell it anyway. Sarah's was round like a ball and she named hers silvester however she wants to spell it I don't know.Postachio is the cutest little peanut I ever did see. But he doesn't taste very good. Well I gotta go for now Oh yeah I won't be writing fo a little while cause I need a break from the computer."

Then when I was almost in the car James said why are you wearing your shirt inside out and backwards? And I ran into the house and got it right I even double checked. Then we got to the resteraunt and we got the buffet so I got french fries pizza and fried chicken. But the only thing I liked was the fries and then they didn't even have chocolate icecream ! I was so torn appart but the three glasses of water filled me up so then we left and I tried to get a piggy back ride from my brother but I couldn't jump high enough. He's to tall. Oh and at the reateruant I got him to try something groose and he ate it well half of it. Well that's all for know.Bye"

"event","Well my day started off horrible! My mom got me up at 8:00 and we had to go in like six mins. but then I couldn't find any socks! so we were like running 5mins late! But thankfully we got there on time. SO the first thing we did was put flyers on everyones doors me and sarah teamed up since we both didn't want to go alone. Then some of the doors had door nobs instead of handles so that one we had to figure out. But we did it!! Then we had to go to the ould school house by East detroit high school and weeded the flower beds but I didn't do very much just like 5weeds.  And then we walked over to the assistance living center and on the way Sarah and i had this sword fight only she said tushie instead of tushay so we kept doing that for laugh. Then we were early  so  we sat outside and sang childish songs like the wheels on the bus and etc. Finally we were let in and sang to about 7 people . so at last the day ended when me and sarah went to 7-11 and got big slurpees!! SO then they dropped me off and I changed into something more comtorble. And was about to go on the computer but then..........(read next entrie)."

"event","Well, I was sitting at work today, and managed to drift off as we all do from time to time.  It occurred to me that it has been now over three years since I finished up college and entered what has been dubbed the real world.  Hard to see where those three years have gone, but I will say they have been eventful.  I can still remember my time at UMD, and it was quite a long time!  I must be getting old as I sense nostaliga in my writing and thoughts.  I guess there is a big reason behind that.  I realised last night that I am pretty damn close to qualifying for my permanent returning resident visa for New Zealand.  I have permanent residency, and have had it for almost 1.5 years now.  However, my first two years are on a type of probation, a stipulation is in place where I have to spend at least 180 days per year for the first two years within New Zealand before I officially qualify for permanent residency for the rest of my life.  I am looking at meeting this stipulation in about 30 days or less if I am not mistaken.  One country down, many more to go."

"event","So I went on a mission down to Stewart Island for Easter Weekend and it was fantastic.  Spent one day exploring Ulva Island, which is a small island that the government turned into a bird sanctuary.  We saw some really interesting and intruiging birds on this island.  The next day, we took off on an adventure to try and spot the elusive Stewart Island Kiwi (the national bird).  We took a water taxi across the inlet, up a river, and got dropped off on the Southern Circuit track (a six day hiking track through part of the island) at Freshwater Hut.  We didn't arrive until 5:15pm, and since it is winter here, we had to hike half of the 15.5km track to Mason Bay Hut in the dark.  It was sweet, but very difficult.  We had an Irish girl in our group of three and she timed us.  It took us 4 hours and 15 minutes.  We didn't see any Kiwis unfortunately.  Because we could not get picked up from the same spot the next day, we had to tramp an additional part of the Southern Circuit the next day.  So, we again hiked 15.5km back to Freshwater Hut from Mason Bay (this time during the morning and made it in 3 hours, 3 minutes) and then had to tramp down to Fred's Camp Hut, which was 10km, but a very difficult track.  We got 5 minutes into this hike (what we dubbed the afternoon hike) and ran into a water crossing immediately.  One without a bridge.  And the water was dark and murky, so we could not tell the depth.  Therefore, we picked up some sticks and had to gauge the best place to cross by doing depth tests.  This continued for the next two hours and made for slow going.  We got over knee deep in this muddy water and it took a while to get across this swamp land.  This is why the Department of Conservation (DOC) in NZ indicates this part of the track takes 6 hours.  We had to go through this massive forest with the most spectacular views and animal life.  Constantly going up and down hills.  It was so fun and amazing.  We made it in 4 hours and 51 minutes, a good 30 minutes prior to being picked up by the water taxi at Fred's Camp.  We had so much fun.  Seriously, there is nothing better than getting deep into the bush with a 20 - 25kg pack on your back just getting back to nature whilst getting some good exercise.  So, overall we did 41kms in 24 hours.  Blood amazing.  That night we stayed at a local backpackers and took off around noon the next day on the ferry back to the South Island.  What a great weekend and I can't wait to get back down there and do the Northwest Circuit, which is a 10 day track full of similar landscape and tracks.  Plus, there are some other 3-4 day tracks around my area that a few guys at work and I are interested in doing, so those have been added to the agenda for this calendar year.

On another side note, the basketball season starts this coming weekend and we are trying to get to the this rugby match between the two South Island teams in the international Super 14 competition which pits teams from South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand against each other.  Great competition.  My team, the Otago Highlanders are not doing so hot, and they are playing the Canterbury (Christchurch) Crusaders, winners of the competition the last two years and currently second in the standings this year.  Going to be a blast."

"event","Well, not much new to report from down under.  Things are progressing steadily at work, we avoided a potential strike by the maintenance guys, and all in all I am keeping busy down there.

Outside of work, the basketball season is just beginning.  We have had a week of practice thus far and things are going well. Try-outs start next week, so I am pumped about that.  I recently bought my snowboarding season pass as well.  The season doesn't begin for ages, but it is a good time to get the pass now as they were very cheap a few weeks back.  In fact, they are already $250 more than when I bought mine.  We have a three day weekend this weekend as Monday is the Anniversary of Otago, the province I live in.  Easter is also coming up, and that is a four day weekend, so a few of us are looking at going down to Stewart Island for the weekend.  It should be fun.  I am off to Christchurch next weekend for an old flat mate's 30th, so the old Casino gang will all be there and that should be a lot of fun. 

Well, I hope everyone is keeping well and enjoying the spring.  Take care."

"event","Well, officially at around 7am this morning, it marked my 2 year anniversary of living in New Zealand.  Two years ago on January 18th I landed in Auckland, to a warm, sunny day and began my new life down here.  Funny how quickly the time passes, eh.  I thought I would share a few of my thoughts whilst I sip on 3 fingers of my favourite scotch, Glenkinchie.  

It has absolutely been a fantastic ride, and in no way is it over.  I expect to be writing an updated version of this in one year entitled ""3 years!"".  There have definitely been some ups and downs, but that is expected in life.  Not everything goes smoothly and if it did, it would make someone that much less capable of handling adversity.  That is not the way I live my life, I love some adversity, though often in small doses and not too close together.

I have had a blast being down here, so many good times it is hard to recount them all.  I have seen a good part of the country thus far, but there are many other places on my list to get to before it is time to move on.  I have met some absolutely fantastic people, both in passing on my travels, and the people I would call my ""mates"", those I spend quality time with.  I have tossed myself out there, integrated myself into the culture and each of the two communities I have lived in, have a good job overall, and wake up at least 3 times a week and marvel at the fact I am down here.  I do miss home a wee bit, who doesn't?  Mostly just the family and my mates from all over, and though I am happy here, in no way am I content.  If you know me at all, you know I have a pension for moving around, trying new things, experiencing as much as possible and that mentality isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  To the few of you who will read this, thanks.  I hope you enjoy it and that it makes sense.  I am truly a lucky individual, even if some of this luck has been hard earned.  Keep in touch all of you, I wish everyone the very best, and I look forward to seeing everyone sometime in the near future....cash flow pending of course"

We are progressing with my major project at work, which is exciting.  I am keeping myself busy this summer with 5 a side soccer on Tuesday nights (forgot how bad I am at this game), touch rugby on Thursdays (scored 4 tries in our win tonight, and dropped a sure fire 5th try, which is the equivalent of a TD), still hitting the weights, getting away on the weekends to spend time with mates and see the country, and just enjoying life as much as possible.  My mates and I looked at heading over to Australia for New Years, but things fizzled and so that is off now.  I am looking at going to the North Island like I had planned ages ago, so I will keep you all posted on that.  Hope everyone is doing well.  Take care everyone."

"event","So I watched the last Twins game of the season and probably Brad Radke's last game ever. It was disheartening to watch, not him pitching, but the defence and ineptitude of the Twins hitters with men in scoring position. I actually sat through the whole game, often yelling at the TV, other times absolutely depressed. Upon the games conclusion, they showed the A's celebrating, but the last thing ESPN in NZ showed before cutting away to another program was an empty Twins dugout, with the crew that takes away all the shit and clean it out........and a dejected Radke sitting in the same spot he had occupied since being removed after the 4th inning, just staring out at the field. I just wanted to express my respect and admiration for Radke. So many guys in the big leagues wouldn't have ever tried to pitch with a torn labrum, let alone a broken shoulder socket, but no one could keep this man off the diamond. You have to realise how much pain each pitch he threw caused him, and yet he kept chucking the ball towards home plate, often hitting his spots. Radke has been a staple in the Twins rotation for so long, I don't know what it is going to be like not reading about his trotting out there every fifth day to grab the ball. It was spectactular to watch him these past dozen years and I seriously hope the Twins bring him back to the club in some fashion (maybe a mentor to Bonser) so that when this club does with the Series next year, he will get that well deserved ring. I raise my glass to Radke (and encourage everyone to do the same at some time in the near future), may he forever be involved with the Twins."

"event","Last Friday I went to my first traditional Maori funeral (and hopefully my last) for my work mate George.  It was quite the cultural experience.  We went to his Mauri (a traditional Maori gathering house, similar to a church, but has ties with one's Iwi, or tribe).  It is in direct relation to your family heritage and place of birth.  Because it was not anyone in our group's Mauri, we had to be welcomed in by one of the elders.  We then listened to an Open Forum where other tribe elder's spoke of George in Maori.  The Eulogy was read and we all went up and greeted the family and paid our respects.  This took a while because there were around 600 people at the funeral.  Then hymns were sang, people were allowed to comment on aspects of George's life.  Then they brought his casket outside where a long, powerful Haka was performed (and George's three boys joined in).  They then took his body to the Crematorium.  We socialised for a bit after this, but left before they returned from the Crematorium.  From those that stayed, they then had a hungi and it carried on late into the evening.  It was a good send off for George and he would have been proud."

"event","Well all, I just got back last weekend from a 14 day holiday in Australia.  It was so much fun.  I landed in Brisbane and caught up with some of my mates from southern NZ who have moved over there during the past year, including my old flatmate.  NZ and Australia have an agreement where by the citizens of both countries can live in either country and work without requiring a visa.  Good system if you ask me.  So, most of my mates have left in persuit of that warmer climate.  Hung out in Brisbane for 4 days, went to the Australian Zoo (the one operated by Steve Irwin, a.k.a. the Crocidle Hunter), and to an amusement park.  I then spent two nights in Surfer's Paradise, relaxing on the beach and met some really nice and interesting people from Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the States.  From there, it was down to Byron Bay for 3 nights of hanging out at the beach, meeting some more cool people from Ireland, Switzerland, Sweden, Australia, U.K., and Germany.  I then went back to my mates place in Brisbane for a night, then off to Adelaide for a night.  Ended the trip in Melbourne, which is one of the best cities I have ever visited.  The architecture, cultural diversity, plethora of public transportation, and laid back atmosphere make it one special place.  I met some more fun people from Germany, Australia, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil.  Overall, I had a blast and have decided to go back to Brisbane for New Year's.  In addition, I plan on moving over there after I finish this major waste-water treatment project at work, roughly Jan 2008.  One of the more interesting observations I made while over there was so many people had MP3 players.  I am all for listening to music, but when you are using an MP3 player, you isolate yourself off from everyone and everything around you.  Now, since I was all about meeting people and just having a conversation with anyone and everyone, it makes it a bit tough.  While you are wearing those headphones, you make it tough for people to ask you questions, have a chat, and you close yourself out to encounters with other people, which for me is the joy of travelling or just living each day to the fullest.  Hope everyone is doing well."

"event","So, I know I have been very slack about writing in here, so I am going to give everyone a quick update.  Uncle Tom Haley mentioned having a trip to Sydney for work later this year, so we are going to try and connect, either in Australia or NZ.  It will be fun to have him down and try and get him to experience some truly ""Kiwi"" things.  I have been away snowboarding the past two weekends.  And no, basketball season is not over as such, but it is over for me.  We kept beating up on the same teams over and over again, had assured ourselves a place in the league championship game, and it was just getting boring.  I realised that I hadn't used my season pass for snowboarding and I was sick of it collecting dust.  So, I decided a few weeks back that I was officially done playing, let my teammates know, and though I miss it a bit, it was something that had to be done.  The winter is winding down a bit, but not too much.  On another good note (well, for me at least), I am taking two weeks off and heading over to Australia this coming Saturday.  It is still fairly warm over there, so I am going to hang out with some mates of mine that have moved over there in a few different cities and enjoy the sun.  I am really stoked about this trip as I have been wanting to get over there for a while now.  A lot of my work mates keep commenting that I won't come back, and hey, if I do contract some strange illness that doesn't allow me to fly for a couple of months and do some cash jobs to pay for things, well, bummer.......

I hope all is well with everyone."

"event","Well, I have a bit of news.  Today, I reached a small milestone in my life.....I have now officially been at my job for an entire year.  I know, big deal, right?  But seriously, it was pretty cool to realise that I actually stuck around and notched that first year of professional experience in one position.  As some of you know, I like to move around a bit, spend some time here, spend some time there, then some more time here, then some time way over there, then here again, etc.  And I know my parents (though they won't admit it!) and some family were a bit skeptical that I would ever get a job in my degree when I moved off to NZ, but I made it an entire year.  It hasn't been the easiest year.  Because I don't have a set return date back home, I have had some serious ups and downs.   For the first time on my adventures I have experienced serious home sickness.  Something I never thought I would go through and it was quite humbling.  I even thought about just up and coming back, but I think I have gotten past that now.  I am interested in another job, but that is due to strictly job related reasons.  I won't lie and tell you I am not looking forward to the opportunity to work in another country, because that is the next goal, but since I have to stick around until at least July 2007 due to stipulations involved with the permanent residency, might as well make the most of my time here and if I can work on the north island for a year, why shouldn't I?"

"event","So even though I have a bit of a cold, I still played in our basketball game today and I was really glad I did.  We won 70-55 against the only team to beat us so far and I scored one point for every year I have been alive (that is 26 for those of you not in the know) and I was 6-8 from 3 point land and 10-13 overall.  I found my shot, so I am stoked eh.  It has been MIA all season long, but this afternoon, it returned.  I had 10 in the first quarter, 19 by half, but then only 2 in the third as I only took one shot.  I scored 5 quick points in the fourth before subbing out and since we were in control, I sat out the rest of the fourth.  It was so much fun.  And the All Blacks beat Ireland this evening, so a nice day overall."

"event","So it was recent brought to my attention that I have totally slacked off in keeping folks back home updated on what is going on down under.  Well, here is a quick update.  I have decided to shelve the idea for now as I was not finding a property suitable to fit my needs within my budget.  Everything in Dunedin seemed to be overprice.  In addition, petrol prices being what they are, if you are not in a car pool, it will cost $150NZD a week just to drive to and from work.  I quit playing rugby as I was able to get on a basketball team.  We have a record of 4-1 and are first place.  The only game we lost we really shouldn't have, we beat ourselves more than the other team beat us, but that is life.  My projects are work are still on as far as I know but I have been removed from the loop as those people who are a lot higher up in the company seem to not trust any of us that work on site, or they just want all the credit.  Yet in their own delusional state to have their name all over this project, they are procrastinating and thus putting us behind a reasonable schedule.  If you had to ask my opinion, I would say the effluent project will not be completed on-time, and thus will not be under budget.  They are setting us up to fail with reckless regard.  Not something you would expect from people with over 20 years experience in the industry.  

Beyond the frustrations with my job, life is good overall.  The small town life is getting to me though.  I am not used to living in such a small town and it is starting to get to me a bit as well.  I am going to sit tight for a couple more months and then I may be forced to make a move, what kind is up in the air, but maybe some new scenary would be nice.  Well, hope all is well with everyone."

We did crush the other team 32-5, which was good cuz they beat us at their place last year 56-0.  Can't say I was the difference, though I had two opportunities to score.....if the ball would have come out to me.  One more pass to the right and I was good to go.  But alas, I got the ball just once, made a pass that resulted in a try (the one cool thing I can say I did) and didn't even have to make a tackle.  In fact, it was actually really boring for me as neither team got the ball out wide much.  Will have to see what comes.  On a side note, the second time wearing my rugby boots, I lost a stud.  2nd time and they are already falling apart!  I guess the replacement studs are cheap as chips and will pick a few up in town tomorrow.  Better tighten them better next time round."

All you do is hang out close to the sideline and follow the ball.  Just stay behind it and if it comes to you, then get your ass across that try line and score.  I like that.  Not too many different plays go all the way out wide, so not as many things to learn at this stage.  Pretty fun."

I was thinking about putting in an offer on this one house, so I had a chat with my solicitor and have got things sorted, though I am undecided about putting the offer in.  I also had a quick look at new places over lunch and now have seen more places I want to take a peak this coming weekend, so I will be heading into town to look.  That will cause me to miss our first preseason game for rugby though.  We play this Saturday morning, but I will be in Dunedin from Friday night, so there is no way I can make it.  Too bad.  I also will look for a basketball club this weekend.  If I find one, that would probably be the end of my brief rugby career as I am quite certain practices and games will be on the same day for both sports.  Will keep all posted on the house process.

"event","Well, this post is coming to all of you while I am quite shocked and a bit sad.  If you have not heard the news yet, Kirby Puckett died today.  The Puck was a one of a kind baseball player and was my favourite Twin growing up (though being such a big baseball fan, I did love all the Twins....and still do).   He was a hero.  He seemed unreal, larger than life, especially to an impressionable young kid like myself, one who idiolised to be just like Kirby (though I didn't play Center Field), make the game saving play, hit the game winning homer.  Watching him forced from the game was more heart-wrenching than learning of Magic Johnson's HIV positive result, especially when it can most likely be attributed to a pitch that hit him in the face.  Poor Puckett.  The announcement of Puckett coming up to bat at the Dome is something I will never forget, along with being at his tribute game in that fateful 1996 season.  I will never forget Puckett the ballplayer and will remember him as a great athlete, a great Twin, but a greater person.  Goodbye Kirby."

"event","A few interesting insights I have read about in the past few days regarding Bush's visit to India.  One is he visited with American workers before he left and then went to visit their old jobs when he got to India since that is the best way for companies to save money, send the jobs to India and your labour cost is at least halved.  The other is more of a forward thinking insight.  In the next generation, China will have the biggest economy.  India and the US will be #2 and 3 in that list.  This whole nuclear power thing with India is a public performance.  What it is meant to do is draw attention away from the fact that these two countries are forming a military alliance.  Why would you ask?  Surely it is not against Pakistan, a staunch ally on the ""War on Terror"" with the US.  Nope, not Pakistan.  The military alliance is being formed to contain the Chinese.  China, having the largest economy in the world in 20 years time, will also have the capacity to have the largest military.  Knowing the US, we are not going to stand by and let someone form an army bigger than ours.  So, we are creating alliances (I am sure other countries in Asia will soon follow) to keep the Chinese in check (why doesn't someone do that to us?).  We gave Pakistan similar treatment regarding nukes when they helped us immediately after 9/11.  India did not have this luxury, so we still condemned them for their nuclear program.  But now, they have something to offer us, which is why we are waiting with open arms to let US companies profit the heck out of India by selling them nuke supplies.  

The double standard?  We still will be staunch proponents of Iran and North Korea having nukes.  But these two places can be just as rogue, secretive, and irresponsible with their nuclear capabilities as Pakistan and India, but hey have nothing to offer us, so we continue to argue for sanctions and for them to dismantle their nuclear programs.  Any thoughts people?"

After getting up early for a Sunday (9am), we hung out a bit just chatting outside our mate's house and realised it was going to be a real warm day.  So we went and got some food for the barbie and grilled out for brunch.  Good feed.  Then we headed off to the beach for about three hours.  The place was packed as everyone in Dunedin had the same idea.  Then we left and just hung out in our mate's garden some more.  We decided we should get some pizza and a movie and did just that.  Got some 'za from the best place in town (and it is cheaper than Domino's or Pizza Hut, crazy) and the movie Crash and just relaxed.  By the way, if you haven't seen the movie Crash, you need to.  Very good movie.  It was a bit disappointing when we had to go back to Clutha (I slept most of the drive back).  This past weekend made my resolve stronger to move to Dunedin.  I bought the Weekend paper (they have just one for Sat and Sun, and it is the size of a US Sunday paper) and went through the realty section.  Ticked off some prospective houses and have been contacting real estate agents over lunch this week.  I am trying to arrange some tours for the first weekend in March.  Will keep you updated on the home buying experience.  

Oh, by the way Bill Maher's show only comes in second to the Daily Show in terms of entertainment and comedy.  Though he is a bit more vulgar, he is a stitch.

"event","So, I am unsure if any of you are following the Olympics at all, but I just saw Sweden beat the U.S. in Women's Ice Hockey.  This I heard was the U.S.'s first in Olympic competition to anyone besides Canada.  The cool twist is that the Swedish player that scored all their of their goals, she played for my alma matter, UMD, and helped them win a couple of national titles.  Pretty cool.  I started to watch the other semifinal was Canada and Finland.  It seems that these four teams are always the final four teams.  

On another note the Twins seem to have a good team coming in, but unfortunately they play in probably the best division in baseball with the White Sox and Indians both being pretty stacked.  It is going to be an interesting season."

I am what is considered a young professional and I get to wear shorts, I mean the athletic shorts!  The reason is that I wear car mechanics overalls all day at work, but they are quite comfortable.

Anyways to get to the point I had about tonight.  I was bored and went to a website that allows me to read the Boondocks, since they don't make any paper down here (not really relevant to Kiwis).  This site, www.politicalhumor.about.com had the best collection of Cheney jokes!  I know that most of you have probably heard them before, but remember I don't get late-night TV down here, so no Leno, no Conan (though I hear he met the Finnish President), no Letterman, no Daily Show :( nothing.   It was a nice collection of jokes.  Enjoy."

"event","From half a world away, I have been finding the Cheney episode quite funny.  He has to be one of the first second in commands in the world to shoot someone.  Heaps of articles keep mentioning the fact that he is an experienced hunter.  Obviously not if shoots towards the last known direction of someone else in the hunting party, shoots into the sun, and doesn't check where all dogs and people are.  However, there are all of these conspiracy theories that maybe he shot this guy on purpose.  That the number of pellets in the buckshot, the range with how much pressure is required to break through all of the hunting gear and the skin, etc, etc.  I just think the White House didn't release the fact that Cheney shot someone cuz it just goes along with what everyone has said since they first came to office, they have no idea what it is going on.

"event","Well, if there are any faithful readers of this journal, I apologise for the long delay.  A lot has happened since I last wrote almost three months ago.  First, congratulations to my boy Miguel for getting married.  I also went home to the states for two weeks, so it was great to see all of you that I managed to see and for those I didn't, until we meet next time I raise my beer to you.  I had a mate of mine move into my flat, helps with the costs.  I have applied for a home loan, figure if I am going to be down here for a couple of years, might as well buy a house and not throw my money away on rent.  Plus, I am hoping to net a small profit when it is time to sell.  I am contemplating relocating to Dunedin (an hour's commute) because some of my mates are moving away and well, it is just a bigger city and somedays I swear this small town life is killing me.  I am still working, getting very indulged in my projects and having fun when possible.  Nothing real big is new.  I now have internet at home, and am thinking of starting a web page, so if you have any ideas/tips, please email me at musiqhead@hotmail.com and let me know.  I could use all the help I can get.  Well, I will be updating this more frequently with random thoughts, so stay tuned!"

"event","Well, things have been going really well down here.  I moved into a nice wee flat by myself about a month ago and it is a great spot.  One level, two bedroom, and I get the sun shining into my living room all day long, so it stays pretty warm as well.  I really like living alone at the moment because I have had some wankers as flatmates since moving down to NZ and it is nice to know that when I leave for work and the house is clean, I will come home to a clean house.  

Other exciting news, well, it is becoming summer down under, so that is really cool.  BBQ on New Year's anyone?  Oh wait, it will be below freezing in MN and Sweden.  Sorry.  Playing basketball and learning rugby still.  Having a decent go at NZ's national game but still lost at times.  Other than that, we grill and have a few beers as often as possible.  

I will also be coming home for 11-12 days in mid to late December.  I have officially booked my flight back to the US, so please let me know what people's schedules are so we can hang when possible.  It will be a quick hitter, but I want it to fully be worth my while.  

Well, I am in Christchurch for the weekend, so I better get back to it.  My parents came out for a visit and it is their last nigth in NZ, so I should go spend it with them instead of this computer.  Take care all."

"event","Well, it has been a very busy work starting with last Saturday.  I finally got a hold of my very old and dear friend Miguel.  He had asked me to be in his wedding in mid-Dec. and though I had made up my mind to do so, I wanted to tell him before posting it here.  So, for all of you who I haven't told before hand, I will be coming home on Dec. 15th or 16th (fly to LA on the 15th, don't have a ticket home yet). I planned on staying til the 25th, but I am contemplating staying a bit longer since it is such a long journey.  I will keep everyone posted as to when I will be home in MN and for how long.  I would love the opportunity to see all of you and would like to arrange some sort of get-together.  As I try to organize this 9,000 miles away, I will keep you posted.  I am pretty excited to be coming home, not something you often hear out of my mouth (or read), but it will be a treat to be at home.  The one down side is that I will be leaving sunny, warm NZ for the cold, bitter winter in MN.  Oh well. 

Secondly, I am now playing in a touch rugby league one night a week.  Rugby is the national sport down here and I would say that more than half of this town is involved in the league.  They have womens, mens, and mixed teams.  I am on both a mixed (with work) and mens (with the basketball guys) team.  We had our games back to back tonight.  We ended up losing both games (they are very competitive leagues, and I look lost at times out there never having played before), but I did score two tries in my mixed game (half the team's tries) and the first one in our mens team (before leaving cuz I rolled my ankle).  A try is the equivalent of a TD in American Football.  I picked off a pass as we were defending our goal line and ran it back the length of the field about 2 minutes into our mens game.  Unlike American Football where there is time between plays, rugby is continuous like soccer, and is played at a very high pace.  I had to play the entire mixed game because we did not have any male subs, so I was exhausted!  But, I started for our mens team (cuz all the guys on our team also had just played mixed games for various other teams), and got that first try.  About 10 minutes later in my second stint on, I rolled my ankle in a little divet in the ground.  Not fun, as I type I am icing it.  

Finally, I have found a new place to rent.  It unfortunately is not the beach location I looked at prior to heading up to Christchurch for work.  The owners of that place have decided to furnish it and rent out nightly as a holiday home.  Good idea with summer coming up and Kaka point being a good tourist destination.  I will still keep my eye open for a place down there.  But, a guy whose office is about 50 feet from my own has a few rental properties and one of them just became vacant.  He showed it to me and I told him I would take it.  It is a nice little 2 bedroom place overlooking the river.  Got a wee yard too.  I am pumped to move into town.  The down side is now I have to buy all of this furniture and electronic equipment as I have only a VCR at this stage.  Have to get a bed, and all that.  Plus, washing machines and fridges do not come standard in rental units, so I have to go out and look at picking up those second hand.  In fact, just to get the place furnished, I will be going complete with second hand furniture.  Going to be just like living at college again.  The place is nice and cosy and I will have a spare bedroom to put visitors.  Just have to get that furnished as well.  

Better get going, long message.  Things are looking good at the moment and I can't wait to get home and see everyone.  Take care all."

"event","Though I know I am half a world away, and have to read about these things on the internet, one can't help but be utterly disappointed by the Vikings start to this season.  1-3.  How bad is that and how bad is this division, with Chicago and Detroit being in first place at 1-2 apiece, this once great division looks like the paltry National League West in baseball, with division winner San Diego barely achieving a winning record at 82-80 and actually finishing a game behind the under achieving Twins (83-79) who failed to make the playoffs for the first time in 4 years.  Guess the Vikings decided to get out the disappointment that usually comes out late in the season right away this year and save a lot of people heart attacks and headaches.  I guess I would rather know that my team was basically eliminated after 4 games then have them go 6-0 and wonder the next 8 weeks why they play like they don't belong on a D2 football field as they finish the season 8-8.  Oh well, I can still grumble and groan about MN sports because no matter where I am, I am still a true blue, die hard MN fan thick and thin.  And hey, since both the T-wolves and Twins missed the postseason and the Wild not evening having the opportunity to play, let alone qualify for the postseason, it seems only fitting that the Vikings fall in line and have a dismal season.  The one question is will they finish above .500 like the other two franchises?

Oh, and I am having fun while still in Christchurch.  Seeing some of the sights I failed to get around to when I actually lived in the city and have a massive meeting tomorrow with the Engineering Manager and the Technical Manager for the whole company. Should be fun!"

I did for a wee while in Balclutha, but after a while it was just something I did.  This was due to the fact that I knew that I wasn't going to get really involved in some interesting things for a while.  Now, back in Christchurch and working with this pilot plant, it has happened.  The down side is that it is now Thursday and I may have to be back down south on Monday, or they may keep me up here for another week.  I am hoping the latter happens.  It would give me a chance to hang out more with my mates for here and give me the opportunity to drive to some cool places to check out this weekend.  I am hoping I will get some kind of indication tomorrow.  Though if it is anything like when they told me I was to come up, I find out it will happen soon, but I don't find out when until late, post 5pm the Friday before I am to be up in Christchurch.

"event","Hey all, well I am back in the city I lived in for the four months before finally landing that illustrious job.  That is right, work has sent me back up to Christchurch for at least two weeks to check on this waste-water treatment pilot plant.  Basically what a majority of my job will revolve around for the next couple of years, this pilot plant gives the company and myself an idea of how we can better treat the water from the processes at the plant before dumping it back into the Clutha River.  It is a big project, but also very interesting and fun.  It has gotten me out of that small town and back into a bigger setting.  In addition, it has given me a chance to catch up with my mates from Christchurch that I haven't seen in ages.  Plus, being a company sponsored trip, the hotel is paid for, the meals are paid for, and I get $0.50/km for driving my car up here instead of flying and taking a company car.  I feel much more comfortable in my car, so I am more than pleased, especially since I will be putting on 1300-1400km during these two weeks.  There is also the possibility that my stay will increase to another week depending on the testing we can accomplish while I am here.  They will continue to test this pilot plant for the next 6 months, but I had to come up for its start up and initial operations while we chose the best chemical agents to remove suspended solids and bacteria in the water.  

Other than that, I have just been living life.  The adventures are slowing considerably, but that is what happens when you get a career finally.  I am waiting to hear about my name being pulled out of the pool of people that have submitted expressions of interest to apply for residency.  Cross your fingers for me!"

"event","Well, I was informed by the guy I first interviewed with for my job, the Engineering manager of the entire company, Mr. Grant Pearson, that I will be heading up to Christchurch for a couple of weeks.  Looks like they are going to want me there on Monday of next week.  I am pretty excited to be heading back up that way because it will give me a chance to see my mates from up there.   Plus I haven't been back since I left to work here in the ""Deep South"".  The one down side is that I am pretty sure that snowboarding is out of the question while I am up there.  One of the places I really liked to go is now closed.  The other mountains want to stay open until their scheduled closing date, but most have lost a lot of snow lately due to the warm temperatures.  I have been told this is one of the warmest winters on record.  

As crazy as this next sentence sounds, it is honestly true.  I have been thinking lately and I have decided that I am sick of throwing my money away in paying rent, so I will be looking into buying a home.  I first have to get residency (which I am still waiting on), but I have been looking at various places for home loans and keeping my eye on property's that have come up for sale in this area over the past month or so.  I have also set up an excel spreadsheet that will show me my weekly payments on a home loan of a certain value with a certain deposit.  It is pretty cool, but I never imagined how much you end up paying for in interest over the course of a home loan.  Using a 30 year home loan at 8%p.a., you end up paying for your house and then some in just interest payments on the loan.  Amazing.  But, I still would have to discuss it with a home loan officer because if I wanted to sell my home in a couple of years due to an upcoming move, what are my options, etc.  

Well, I best be off to bed.  Got a busy week of work ahead in getting everything ready for my absence around the place over the next couple of weeks."

We had a small work gathering on Saturday night.  Just dinner and a few drinks, it is an annual event for all of the salaried staff.  It was fun and we watched the All Blacks beat Australia to win the Tri-Nations series for their 6th time in it's existance.  In addition to watching the rugby on Saturday, I actually had my first touch-rugby practice on Sunday.  Wow.  Now, you get an idea from watching the game that there is a fair bit of running involved, but I was blown away at how easily I was exhausted playing.  I am in pretty good basketball shape at the moment, but I am now where near rugby fitness level.  We are going to continue to have practices and scrimmages up until the season, hopefull two times a week or so.  That way I can get my rugby legs.  It is going to be fun playing in this rugby league and I am starting to really grasp the rules.  I will let you know the progress.  Until next time....."

"event","Well, I think I have failed to write for two weekends, so I will go back to the first weekend I failed to write.  My mate's brother came back to NZ from Scotland.  He had been over there for two months shearing sheep (he made so much money, and had free room, board, flight, etc).  So, the massive crew had a weekend out in Dunedin.  It was quite fun.  Not much else to say there though.

This past weekend was not up to my usual weekends.  I guess you can't have fantastic weekends every time though.  I went up to Wanaka, the other main ski town in NZ.  Well, the town itself is great.  Real quite and laid back, not quite as touristy as Queenstown, though it is becoming more like Queenstown Jr. all the time.  Anyways, we have had nice warm weather lately, which means subpar conditions for snow sports.  Because we still get below freezing at night, the slopes were terribly icey in the mornings and when the weather heated up nearly 50F, it got realy slushy in the afternoons.  Plus, it was cloudy most of the weekend, so it was tough to see what you were getting into.  Therefore I had a terrible time boarding.  Fell heaps.  I felt like I was back learning beause I hadn't fallen that much the entire season!  But, on the bright side I met a Swedish exchange student studying in Dunedin, just the place we go quite often.  He is a boarder too, so we hung out while we were in Wanaka and even hit up the pub for the rugby match on Saturday night.  NZ won 31-27.  What a great game!  So, I made another mate to hang out with in Dunedin.  I will be there in about 10 days, so will catch up with him then.  Another plus to this past weekend was I got some really cool photos.  I know, one of these days, hopefully this milennia, I will get those pictures up.  It is tough though because one of my flatmates is constantly on-line.  Anyways, I have to get to basketball practice so gotta go.  Oh, and Miguel, I will check in with work and keep you posted mate.  Thanks for the offer buddy."

"event","I just had an amazing weekend.  I went up to Queenstown to do some snowboarding and meet some mates of mine from Christchurch.  I got up there Friday evening around 8pm, checked into the hostel we were all staying at and then we all hung out together.  Went into town for a few beers, ran into the guys I first met when I was travelling around the North Island (Justin and Dash).  Both of them live and work in Queenstown.  Got up the next day and went to Coronet Peak and wow, it was absolutely breath-taking.  The view was just as good as last time, but the sun was shining and there was fresh snow to play in.  Plus, unlike last time where I was boarding a bit sketchy due to the long lay-off, this time I was full board.  I was bombing down the slopes, making some good turns, hitting a few small jumps along the way.  I didn't want to  leave though when the time was up.  That night the mates and I just hung around, didn't go out or anything, just watched the New Zealand-Australia rugby match.  Good match, with NZ winning 30-13, though they lost one of their stars to a broken leg.  The next day, I said goodbye to the mates, they are returning home on Sunday, and then went out to the Remarkables (you can check these fields out at www.nzski.co.nz if you are interested).  They too had received fresh powder the night before, but due to the strong winds, visibility was minimal.  That didn't matter to me.  They had to close one of their chairlifts due to the cold conditions, which left a lot of people in a small space on the left side of the mountain.  So, I decided to give my hand a try at the right side.  Wow, talk about cool.  The view was spectacular, the boarding was fantastic, though visibility was still tough.  I was picking up good speed, hitting more small jumps and lips in the terrain, and overall enjoying myself.  In fact, due to the road up to the Remarkables being unpaved, I took a shuttle from the car park at the base of the mt. to the ski lodge.  Well, that shuttle left at 3:45pm to go back, slopes close at 4pm.  I was having so much fun that I ended up missing the shuttle back down!  I had to hitch my way to the carpark.  Wasn't a problem because there were only about 12 of us trying to hitch down, so it only took about 20 minutes or so to get a ride.  It was a nice drive home, the scenery is really cool as the sun sets, but work Monday was tough.  I wanted to stay up another night and hit the slopes again on Monday, but an unexplained absence from work I thought wouldn't look too good, so I came home.  I will be heading to Wanaka, the other main ski town in NZ in two weeks.  I was looking at this map yesterday and there are so many back country and club ski fields all over.  Places with only rope tows and T-bars (which suck on a board).  I am thinking of heading to one of them in Oct. if they still have snow because they are closer to Christchurch and I have to go up there for a couple weeks for work related material."

"event","Well, I would have to say that I had a great weekend.  The week itself flew by, and then we played the second best basketball team in our league (one we had lost to by 15pts two weeks prior), and we beat them by 20.  For the second consecutive week, we absolutely ran thet oppositon out of the gym.  They could not keep up with us.  Our defense led to many a turnover, which led to fast break points.  Good times.  I had 19, the highest on our team, but missed my last three jumpers, preventing me from scoring 20+ in two straight games.  Then, a teammate (Corey), his younger sister had her 21st birthday party in Clinton (yes, same as the former Pres.), a town about 20 minutes west of the 'Clutha.  Almost our entire team was there, in addition to one big fana (the name for family in Maori).  Another teammate, Gerald, is a cousin of Corey, and thus Corey's sister Misty.  There had to be about 150 people there for this celebration.  A 21st birthday is celebrated in more of a traditional family style over here.  In fact, 3 of Gerald's sisters (both he and Corey are one of seven siblings) got up and sang a couple of Maori songs.  Afterwards, Gerald, two of his brothers, his brother in law, Joe from the team, and other males in attendance got up and performed a haka (a Maori dance intended to either intimidate an opponent before battle or done as a sign of respect for someone(s)).  It was a very cultural evening.  Joe's sister and some of her friends that we have been hanging out with on the weekends after basketball in Dunedin came to Clinton that night for the party because coming from a small town, all of these people have basically grown up together and if they are not blood related, they know each other so well, they might as well be family.  I have become a pet project for Mere (Joe's sister) and her friends because they are very keen to find me a nice young lady.  I find it amusing, but I am thankful for their efforts because living in a small town is such a change of pace for me.  

On Sunday, we went to the local high school here in Clutha and watched a Kapahaka.  This is a traditional Maori performance of various songs, dances, and chants.  It was a dress rehersal for the students involved as they have a competition in Dunedin on Friday.  Most of the people from the party the night before were there (Misty and Corey are half Maori).  Though this small town is quite different from St. Paul, Duluth, and even Christchurch, I am finding a home here.  I have been welcomed into the extended family and everyone has made me feel so welcome.  I had numerous people that I met for the first time this weekend telling me I was now in this great big extended fana.  The people of this country are so superb because they really go out of your way to make you feel at home.  We are even talking about having a hungi (a traditional Maori feast where the meat and veges are cooked underneath heated rocks in a hole dug in the ground).  I have never had one, so I am very keen to try it.  The taste I have been told is the most unique.  Well, next weekend is Queenstown and catching up with some mates from Christchurch.  Hope all are doing well."

"event","Well, all, we had an entertaining weekend.  On Friday, I drove into Dunedin with a couple of mates from my basketball team (Gerald and Joe).  We went to see a NZ reggae band with some of our mates that study at Otago U (biggest U in NZ).  The band is called Fat Freddy's Drop and it was really good.  Then, we had our weekly basketball game on Saturday and we kicked butt.  We ran the other team out of the gym, 93-58.  I dropped in 23, so a decent game for me.  But, this was the best we had played as a group, good all-around passing, good fast-breaking, and taking the ball strong to the hoop.  In fact, I think our team only took 3 or 4 3-balls.  I only took one (and hit it), a new personal low for me.  Then we had a small team celebration Saturday night.  There were a couple of University balls going on, for example the Medical School and Dental School each had their ball that night, so heaps of people were all dressed up.  Watched a bit of the first Tri-Nations game (a rugby tournament between Australia, South Africa, and NZ).  The game was in Johennasburg, so it didn't start here until 3am or so.  I couldn't stay awake for the entire game, but SA won, which is good because the tournament champion is bound to come down to NZ or Aussie.  Then we just hung out all day Sunday while it was another gorgeous day here.  I am loving the winter so far.  Days up in the low to mid teens (that would be 50-60 F) and then at night it drops down to freezing, but not too cold.   We have as far as I know one more b-ball game to go, then in two weeks I am going to meet some mates from Christchurch in Queenstown for a good weekend of snowboarding.  I have been going a little stir-crazy waiting to get back to those mountains. Well, better get to bed soon, got to work tomorrow."

We just couldn't buy a bucket, but that is life.  I stayed overnight in Dunedin to hang out with a couple of guys from the basketball team. One of the guys, Joe, his sister and girlfriend both live there, so we, along with some of their friends and Gerald from basketball all hung out together.  It was quite nice and now I have met even more people.  It is amazing how basketball, one simple game, can be the common effect that brings people together.  Just as in Sweden, I have made some good mates through basketball.  If I had not joined this team, I wouldn't know nearly as many people my age as I do.  Through this game, I have been welcomed into circles and as my Swedish friends can attest to, it helps you make friends with people who you will always stay in contact with.  I am looking forward to seeing all the new people I met in Dunedin in two weeks at Joe's cousin's birthday party.

In addition to meeting some cool people this weekend, it was absolutely gorgeous.  I was outside today, tanning with my shirt off, in shorts.  Oh, and by the way, it is the middle of winter.  That's right, just like those occasional 70 degree days in February we get every now and then in MN, that happened over the weekend.  It was around 60-65 during the day, but as soon as the sun went down, the temp dropped to about 40.  Still, 40 in the middle of winter is great.  Well, I have to return to the office tomorrow, not too excited about that.  I just love the weekends here so much and really are starting to appreciate them properly that I never want them to end.  But, can't win at everything, so it is off to work so I can make my fortune. Till next time."

"event","Well, today my flatmate talked me into coming out with him and a couple of other guys we work with to shoot clay birds. It was the first time I ever shot a gun, so it was a unique experience.  I ended up hitting one clay bird and missed the other ten.  I figure for never using a shot gun before, hitting one isn't bad.  Good 'ol small town NZ fun I guess.  I have a couple of pictures of it and I hope to get those uploaded soon.  I will try to get some on the net by the end of the week."

"event","Hey all, just thought whenever I get the chance to throw something out here quickly.  Well, tomorrow is Friday, and I couldn't be happier.  Being the off season at work, things are quite slow.  But, the projects that I have been collecting data for have been approved, so I have my budget to make the improvements I need to make.  I am entrusted with $2 million NZD.  I know, that is the biggest budget of any department.  But, I have 3 projects that are quite extensive that will use a large portion of that money.  I remember a friend once telling me that when they first started working a professional job, they lived for the weekends.  I identify with that at the moment.  Not really having a situation/job like this in the past, it is taking some time to adjust to.  I thought I wouldn't be as fresh as I was the first couple of weeks after working night shift for so long, but I was able to get up early and function properly.  But these last two weeks, wow, I keep sleeping an extra 20 minutes or so and am very tired throughout the morning and some days into the early afternoon.  Body is not adjusting as well as I hoped.  I try to get to bed a little earlier everynight, but it doesn't always happen.  Something I have to learn to deal with and get over.

So, this Saturday I have my first game with my new basketball team.  Our game is at noon in Dunedin, so we are leaving little Balclutha at 10am.  I have to stop and get some b-ball shoes before the game because I have been practicing in my low tops for two weeks now.  Last time I played in low tops was the entire year in Sweden, and I did twist my ankle a couple of times.  Thus, to help prevent that, I will actually invest in a pair of high-tops this time.  I am excited to see what the competition is like.  When I was in Christchurch, I got to run with this team and they were not bad.  I was pleasently surprised.  This team is not quite up to those standards though.  I am still doing it just to have fun, get some excersice, and it gives me an excuse to go to Dunedin every other weekend and save some $$ by taking a weekend off the slopes.  Well, it is getting to be about bed time because I keep closing my eyes.  Take care all."

"event","Well, it was a great weekend, that's what the title should say.  The annual winter festival was going on in Queenstown this past weekend and because of that I was unable to find a place to stay on Friday night, so I had to just relax at home here in Balclutha and then get up early on Saturday and go.  So, at 7am on Sat. I took off.  Now, not having been there before and heading towards the mountains, I had no idea how long it was going to take, so I planned for 4 hours, but in reality the roads to Queenstown from here were very nice.  I don't think I have driven on a straighter highway since arriving in NZ.  I went straight to the Remarkables ski field and parked my car in a wee carpark at the base of the mountain and paid ten bucks to catch the shuttle to and from the base of the ski fields.  My car doesn't like going up hills so much and not knowing what kind of road to expect on the 13.5km journey each way, I thought it was better just to pay the ten for reliable transportation to and from the base of the ski fields.  So, I got up there just fine, but had an hour before I could get an afternoon pass so I just hung out and watched.  By the time I finally get off the lift, a low lying fog had settled in, so it was tough to see what kind of snow you were getting yourself into.  Combine that with the fact that I hadn't been on a board in 16 months and was a bit rusty, it made for an interesting day.  Didn't fall as much as I expected, but still hit the ground hard a couple of times.  Then after I got settled into my hostel and had a shower and dinner, I went with a couple of girls I met there from the U.K. to watch the third test match in the British and Irish Lions vs. All Blacks rugby series.  In accordance with the first two test matches, the All Blacks proved too powerful and won quite easily.  In the three test matches, the All Blacks outscored the Lions 107-40.  The All Blacks had 12 tries to the Lions 3 (basically the rugby equivalent of a TD).  It was domination at its best.  The girls were a bit disappointed but kind of expected that type of outcome.  Stayed out for a bit more then went back to get some sleep.  Got up early the next day and checked out of the hostel and then hung around the city for a bit.  It is a really nice city located on a beautiful lake.  So, I decided to get a cup of coffee and sit by the lake for an hour reading.  Got a bit cold, so I decided to drive up to Coronet Peak for boarding in the afternoon.  A bit bigger than the Remarkables, but the base there was a lot smaller (about 80cm at the Remarkables and 30cm at Coronet Peak).  Both ski fields were struggling for snow and in fact most in NZ are at the moment.  Not much has fallen.  If the snow machines were not on all day at Coronet, they wouldn't have been able to actually open up for business.  So, with Coronet lacking the base, I ran into some icey patches.  I found a run I really liked and where there was light traffic, but the end of the run was a black diamond covered in ice.  So, no matter how hard I tried, I seemed to always fall in this one area and continuously slide about 30-40m down due to the ice.  But, no broken bones, just some bruises and a sore bum.  All in all it was fantastic.  I was going to stay for the Big Air competition at Coronet, but decided that since it was not going to start for another 2 hours after they closed the ski fields, I would just drive back and get home so I could get some sleep.  I wish I had a digital camera though because I took a 5 minute break near the top of Coronet and you could see from 1700m up all the way down into the valley where Queenstown is located and it was amazing.  Your up on a snowy mountain top, but all you see is green below, you look out and there is this calm lake, surrouned by snow-capped mountains on either side.  You can see a wee bit of Queenstown, but it is tucked behind two hills from your view.  There are a couple other small towns in the area, but you are just stunned by the scenery.  Next time I go back, I will get a picture and post it on-line.  After having the fun I had there, it was not the easiest thing to get back to Balclutha and go to work today.  I wanted to stay there and live, but it is so expensive and tough to find accommodation, plus now that I finally have my engineering job, it just wouldn't be smart to leave, right?  Little help here mates?  Got basketball next Sat. in Dunedin, so that will be good and then hopefully go to Wanaka, the other big ski town (about 45 minutes from Queenstown), soon.    Take care all."

"event","Hey all, well not much has happened around here this past week.  Finding myself still learning heaps at work, and at the same time finding my way around and gaining confidence.  Still heaps to learn and heaps of information to gather.  

Went into the ""city"" last weekend and got myself a snowboard (finally got paid from the new job), some gear, and will be heading up to Queenstown this weekend to finally get back on the slopes after a 16 month layoff.  Very excited.  I will be leaving a little early from work and heading straight up there on Friday night.  Then get half day passes for both days because I am not in good enough shape to board for 15 hours over the weekend, plus I don't have the money to afford full day passes for both days.  I am so excited though to be finally getting up there.  I told my flatmates that this will turn out to be the longest work week ever!  

It is quite funny saying that I am going into the city.  I regarded it as living in Moose Lake and driving to Duluth and calling that driving into the city.  Dunedin is the city I am referring to and it is only about an hour away, but it is still a chore to go in there for some minor items due to the fact that we don't have any big stores in town to get some of the things you need.  

Well, hopefully the next installment will come after the weekend of snowboarding.  Oh, and for those that have yet to do so, please email me at c.haley@ppcs.co.nz.  Cheers!"

The people are super nice and helpful, so I am liking that.  I have heaps of data to go through for this one project and will have to take some water samples for another all starting on Monday.  

I am in Dunedin this weekend because well, there is not much to do in a small town like Balclutha and I was meeting a mate here.  We are going to go out to the peninsula and try to view some penguins, sea lions, and other interesting creatures.  The Otago peninsula is quite good for some rare species of animals, so we are going to see if we can get a peak of some.  Will probably have to come back to Dunedin to get a snowboard next weekend and then I would like to be in Queenstown in a couple of weeks to finally get out boarding.  

Will someone help to get the Twins out of their funk? Seriously, this is enough.  They need to start winning if they want to make the playoffs this year.  Well, will keep you all posted on the job as often as I can."

I am unable to access my hotmail account because the server has a protective service that does not allow employess access to pages that can distract them from work, like personal email pages, espn (yes I am denied my sports!) and so forth.  

The first week thus far has been quite cool.  Everyone at work is so helpful and friendly to their new ""American"" co-worker.  It is the Kiwi way.  I have received many emails from all of you with your congratulations, and to this I say thanks.  It has been nice to receive them.  I am still finding my way around the place, it is such a huge factory, in fact it is the second largest freezing works in the country.  Freezing works is nice terminology for a slaughterhouse.  That is right, I work at a place where they process lamb and beef.  The killing floor is something else, let me tell you.  But my job is dealing with the new enviromental regulations that will be taking place in the next year or two regarding the air and water.  Therefore, we have to cut down on the amount of pollution the factory discharges into the air and the Clutha river which runs along side the factory.  It is going to be a daunting job, and I may find myself up my neck in sh#t, but it is going to be interesting, and everyone has to start somewhere.  The nice aspect is that is sounds like I will be roving between plants the company owns on the south island, so I won't be stuck in Balclutha forever (pop. 4500).  

I am currently living in a house with two other guys that work at the factory.  The house is actually owned by the factory (similar to my time working in Sweden), except this time I have to pay $30NZD a week for my accomodation (about $23 USD).  Not bad.  We still do have to pay for the power, but that will probably come to an additional $40NZD a week each.  Central heating is not common here, so we heat the house via electric heaters, thus the power bill can be high, but that is the only house bill we have to pay.  Plus, we are so close to work I can almost reach out of my bedroom window and touch my office.  Good stuff. 

Will be travelling an hour east to Dunedin on Saturday to catch up with a mate.  I would normally leave Friday, but we have a work function on Friday and this will give me some time to find out more about my collegues and have dinner with most of them.  I am excited to be finally working in my field, especially in green engineering and looking forward to getting lost in my projects.  Please all use the new email address and take care."

"event","Well everyone, I have the best news.  I finally got a job!  After months and months of applying, waiting, interviewing, being turned down, it has finally happened.  I am going to be an Environmental Engineer.  I will be working for a meat packaging company and dealing with their waste-water treatment specifically.  Not exactly the most exciting job in the world, but one non-the-less that allows me after all this time to finally use my brain and the degree that took so much time and effort, oh and money.  It was a very quick process, I had a pre-interview at one of their coporate offices with the head engineer for the whole south island (this company is huge and has heaps of engineers on staff) on a Friday.  They flew me down south to interview at the plant where the job was the following Tuesday, then turn around and offer me the job on Monday.  It is unreal.  It is a recently created position as well because some enviromental regulations will be going into effect in 2006 and 2007 that require this company to implement new treatment processes.  The money is decent, more than I make now, and the work will be 8am to 5pm Mon-Fri, so I will have my weekends off to go to Queenstown and Wanaka to snowboard.  I have mates in both towns, so there is floor space for me to crash whenever.  
 
Two days after I got this job offer, and before I officially excepted, the gas company on the north island called and offered me a job there as well.  I couldn't beleive it.  After waiting so long, to get two offers in three days, I was on cloud nine.  But I had to stay on the south island because I felt this is where I belong and though I will start in a very small town, the position I took will be a roaming position, so I will be going back and forth between Christchurch, Dunedin, and Balclutha (where I will be initially stationed). 
 
So, I had my last night at the casino last night and now am a free man until June 20th (when I start down south).  So, I bought a car earlier this week, a 1989 Honda Accord (still never have had a car post the 1980's).  It runs well, has a few minor problems, but I got it for roughly $650 USD, so it will last me a little while.  Once I get permanent residencey, then I can get a car financed if I choose, or save up some money to get something a tad bit better.  Insurance rates are pretty cheap over here and I will sign up with AA, basically our AAA, on Monday.  So, I figured I would treat myself and spend a few days up north next week.  Going to Nelson to check out the Marlborough sounds and so forth.  I am looking forward to it.   
 
Just felt I had to share all of my good news with everyone, so take care, hopefully hear from you all soon, and I will keep you posted on my new position and how it is going.

Though the north island is offering a small amount of money more than the plant on the south island, I am going to take the position on the south island because it is closer to the snowboarding and so forth.  I am excited.  I am going to try and start on the 20th of June.  I am excited to start using my brain for once.  And Chad, thanks for the hints on the cars.  I was just going to buy a junk car with what little money I have saved, but now that I am going to have a good job paying some decent cash, I may just go and get a decent car."

It was a pretty cool event because they had the best record throughout the season, they got to play a home final, so Christchurch was just buzzing with excitement over the victory.  

The other bit of good news is that finally I have a JOB!  That is right, after all this searching, I am now going to be an environmental engineer!  I have to move even farther down south on the south island, but I will make some decent money and be close to the snowboarding fields.  I am so pumped!  The down side is that I am moving to a smaller town, but I won't be too far away from some cool cities to go hang out at on the weekends.  The company I will work for is a meat processing plant and due to new environmental regulations, I will be helping them design and implement a new waste water treatment system.  I am pretty excited and it is going to be a challenging position.  I will probably start in 3-4 weeks.  I am going to quit at the casino, buy a car, and go travelling for a week to 10 days before moving down south.  I am so excited!  

Well, I am supposed to meet a mate at the gym, so I will talk to you all later."

"event","Wow, it has been almost two weeks since I last posted anything.  Not much has really happened.  I will hear about the NGC job probably next week or so.  They have to interview some more candidates, but I don't feel that the interview went all that well.  They asked me perform some calculations and well, I drew a complete blank.  I guess that is what happens when you haven't looked at anything relevant to do with chemical engineering in months and you are on 3 hours sleep.  But, I did have an interview today for an Enviromental Engineering position with PPCS, the largest meat processor in NZ.  I was told I will probably get a second interview soon, so I will be flying even farther south on the south island for that.  

Other than that, not much has happened in the past two weeks.  I went to a rugby game last Friday and it was such a blast.  Not as much cheering as an NFL game, but that is due to the crowd being about half the size and the continuous play of rugby.  It isn't make a catch, huddle up, line up, run the next play a minute later.  In rugby, it is like football and soccer combined.  Play doesn't really stop.  And there are big hits.  The best is when they score a try (touchdown).  I had a blast at the game.  It went a bit too quick but it was a good time.  My friend who scored us the tickets is moving to Toronto for a year in about 8 days, so I will be at his going away party tomorrow night.  Should be fun.  I am working 6 days a week again because I need the money to buy a snowboard."

I think it went well, but as I am approaching the gate, I see all these people outside the gate to the plant, with signs that read ""Yes to 5%"" and so forth.  I am a bit off put by this and find out later that I had to cross a picket line to interview!  That was a bit unnerving.  Then my idiot self leaves my black leather folder behind and I have to go back and cross it again to retrieve this most important folder!  I was not excited to say the least.  I am supposed to hear back sometime next week, so that is cool.  

Another piece of exciting news is I have an interview next week with the Natural Gas Company, an SOE (State-owned-enterprise).  They are flying me up to New Plymouth (west coast of the north island) on Friday, early morning, and I return that day.  I fly at 6:45am, so I have to be at the airport at 6am, which means a 5am shuttle, meaning I have to be up around 3am.  How fun!  But this job seems like it will utilize more of my ChE degree than the process engineering job at Bridgestone.  That one seems suited more for a mechanical engineer.  Things are going well.  I am worried though because if I move up to the North Island, I am going to be far away from the snowboarding area, where as on the south island I am 75 minutes by car.  Oh well, I will take a job if I am offered.  

I am enjoying new days off at the casino.  Now I have Thursday and Friday off, and am on a day shift the next couple of weeks, so no more late nights.  I am liking it.  Things seem to be going quite well at the moment.  Will keep you all updated."

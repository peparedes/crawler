"event","Love of mine some day you will die 
But I'll be close behind 
I'll follow you into the dark 

No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white 
Just our hands clasped so tight 
Waiting for the hint of a spark

If heaven and hell decide 
That they both are satisfied 
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs 
If there's no one beside you 
When your soul embarks 
Then I'll follow you into the dark 

In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule 
I got my knuckles brusied by a lady in black 
And I held my tongue as she told me 
""Son fear is the heart of love"" 
So I never went back 

If heaven and hell decide 
That they both are satisfied 
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs 
If there's no one beside you 
When your soul embarks 
Then I'll follow you into the dark 

You and me have seen everything to see 
From Bangkok to Calgary 
And the soles of your shoes 
are all worn down 
The time for sleep is now 
It's nothing to cry about 
Cause we'll hold each other soon 
In the blackest of rooms 

If heaven and hell decide 
That they both are satisfied 
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs 
If there's no one beside you 
When your soul embarks 
Then I'll follow you into the dark 
Then I'll follow you into the dark


death cab for cutie - i will follow you into the dark"

"event","alexisonfire... except for the 2 hour wait in line it was totally fucking unbelievable... boys night out wasnt bad, but when alexisonfire came out, it was worth the 2 hour moshpit, but WTF, i dont remember there being a limit on crowd surfing. or security yelling at u to get down off of someones shoulders... alexisonfire played about 14 songs i guess, all totally amazing and worth every penny. and josh is also the most retarded person alive... cause he wanted to ""work"" with krystina, so he missed the concert and wasted his ticket when we could have sold it for $80(-35)= $45!!! FOR US!!!!"

"event","we wake up on sat. morning around 10:30 and me and nathan leave to his house to take a shower. soo, i get out of the shower and nathan finds out that his mom wants to be home before he leaves so i leave and he stays. on the way to matts i check my pockets for my chron. i find nothing, my heart skips a beat. i get to matts and ask him where my chron is, then i notice someone short walking up the stairs. i was like ""that cant be krystina"", but it was and we spent like 15 minutes searching matts basement looking for my chron!! matt and krystina try the gin in the tea thingy, while i chugged the bottle. lol, i felt a buzz. we catch a bus around 2 and we just made it. i try entering the bus when the driver wasnt in it, lol he came from tim hortons yelling at me. once we got on the bus i ran to the back like a retarded child. i tried to get us kiked off, by putting a smoke in my mouth and if someone was with me, run up the length of the bus in my boxers :P. but everyone thought i was nuts. once we get there(finch station) we take the subway where i met krystina's yoga group(they wouldnt respond back) when we get downtown, around 2:30, we go to pheonix house, noones there, so we head up the street looking for something to do, i spot the library and im like, let me go lay in there. so we head in and everyone but krystina is reading, she's just sitting there giving us dirty looks, weird. so head to the hall around 4 and wait outside for 1 hour or something. when we got to the line we were handed condoms(WTF) and they took a picture of us :). then i take on of my last smokes and smoked it, god it tasted bad. When we get in we all go to the coat checks except krystina cause she didnt feel like paying, then she went when there was a line, HAHAHA, loser. we waited threw all the bands for protest. when they came on i went MOSHING HARD. i spent most of the time going nuts, but when the chick would sing i would stop and jump on people to get close to her, dont ask. after the second song i leave to get water. i drink it all and ask matt or krystina, cant remember, to fill it with water, i come back after another 2 songs and i had to fill it, then i stayed in for the rest, about 4 songs? she who mars the skin of god was utterly beutiful, lol almsot cried! the female singer was nuts. nathan only stayed in for 2 songs and when he did, i climbed up his back, lol, i was nuts. when i got out i was sweating like a motha fucka. really i was, then i poured water on myself cause i was boiling, lol i also accidently walked into the girls bathroom. After waiting half an hour at the coatcheck line, we leave and i met some guys that hated emo's so i point out krystina and he's like ""she's not emo"". so we go to a pizza place where we play with a condom! kinda funny. lol. then we take the subway home and krystina's mom picks us up, and i start making retarded stories about the most stupidest things and i forgot what else we did, we got dropped off and we went to bed i think, or watched a movie, called slither, kinda retarded"

I wanted to find the engrish classes, but we got lazy so we went to the library. Alex called and came(bummed a smoke off of me)lol, bk, funny. after we leave by catching a bus(but not before buying chrons, 2 g's) we were pressing my nazi button on the bus and it was fun :). so we get to matts and make a rucus before we reach vaughn mills. when we get there me and matt get baked out of our life, lol, about 1 gram. i was walking around the mall thinking everyone was smiling to me :). soo.. we go back to matts (me and nathan, with matt) and we watch tv, then went out for another bowl, god i was fucked. then i went to bed"

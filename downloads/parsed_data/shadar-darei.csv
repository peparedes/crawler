"event","I've been thinking a lot lately, in a more focused manner, in a more conscious manner and I've realized that although I've love a lot of women so far in My short yet twisted life, each and every time I've been scared, scared of actually fall on someone who'd return the feeling, scared of having someone depend on Me. I realize I've been Very immature when it come to women so far, and in a way I still am, as the more I explore My feeling and the way I live My life I'm not ready to commit, I'm not ready to give up a freedom I've never been allowed to Experiment fully. 

I've never took My life in My own two hand and lived it, I always looked for someone to hold My hand, to lead Me through life, so it be less scary, less hard, less bruising and in doing so I think I ended up hurt More often and more seriously than I would have had I spread My wings and Jumped. 

Coming to that realization isn't easy, nor is it really enjoyable as it's painful to see that although I am very mature when it come to the world, when it come to dealing with other people on an emotional level and dealing with how I decide to Live My life I'm very childish and very immature.

Recently I may have, inadvertently, pushed someone away who cared about Me, because I was scared she'd do all the other and drop Me like a used piece of clothing no longer wanted once she got bored of Me. now I'm unsure if My lack of Maturity prevent Me from trying again or if it's a new found Maturity that make Me hold back. I've hurts her once already and I do not wish to do it again. plus as I said I'm not ready to commit, not ready give up on sampling a life that just keep on getting wider and bigger... 

What is it I should do next? what is the next step?

I hope I find out soon"

"event","what can I say , the last few week have been somewhat ... strained... as the lady for whom the previous Poem was written for has some of the same feeling for someone else... 

so I've been struggling the past three week in finding a way to fix thing, inside and outside.. 

She was honest with Me thus she didn't intentionally caused Me harm, and I care more dearly for that, but I think I'd take being stabbed over the pain caused by finding out I was too late.
That I got My hopes up in vain, of thinking I had finally found someone to enjoy the rest of what life allotted Me with .. only to be Brutally, not that she was anything but gentle, but there is no way that can of pain can be soft, only to be Brutally brought back to reality , Back in square one.. 

so three week Later... ........I'm not even sure where To start looking ... and I don't really want to keep annoying My friend with this anymore or they'll start to think I'm going sick or something... so I'm more or less left along to find a solution and there is No Light in sight

all I know is that I still Love her
I still wish Life would stop being Cruel..
We all Know Life make No gift though ... 
thank to you all soon......"

Even though, I'm always Asking you
to speak louder, repeat or explain
I do listen, care and pay attention

Even though, you're so far away
You remind Me, always, that you wanna stay alone
while I work at getting closer to you 

Even though, your life is complicated,
I stay there, close at hand, beside you 
Even though, you claim to need no one
I remain around to support you

Even though, I'm younger than you
You don't treat Me any differently
Even though, I shouldn't
I Love You"

"event","well now it' sbeen a while and well I'm gonna do a resume

for one I got a job it's cool but I'm not suited for it yet, plu sit's slow to start cuz I know next to no one and well that make it very hard, pluys I got a promotion that actualy put too much pressure on Me, so I'm gonna step down from it. 

what else, I'm sick even if it doesnT' show, nothing really dire it just sap My strenght a lot and I seem to never have any energy, it suck 

I miss a lot of person I never met, wierd, I mean I talk to them online but I never touch them, never saw them with My own eyes, never heard them with My own ear, we've never been in the same room, it's wierd, I'm not used to that. 

also My plan to go to Nove scotia this summer, well it's gonna need a serious boot in the ass or at this point I won't make it, I need 800$ not as much as I though  only cuz I found a way to same like 400$ on the plane ticket, by taking a shuttle. neat hey but I still need 600$ to make it, 800$ would make it an great vacation.

also it's hard being in love with people that can't return it, yeah person , plural, though strangely I don't love them the same way but every bit as much, does that make me a leecher, an asshole, or worse? I don't know. 

well that's my life to this point

ps My boss will yell at me tomorrow."

"event","hey this one doesn't have a title so if any of you think of a name just tell me ok .

here goes:

And thus at sunset,
as the water turn crimson,
and the shadow lenghten
to the eastern horizons,

While waiting I sat, 
on the cold hard rock,
looking at the endless road, 
both from my past and to My future,

then, there before me, 
Shades of the present, 
flashing by, ephemeral, 
like being of no substance,

And thus through the night, 
planning the next part,
I await the unveilling
of My existence.

"event","wow I did some clean up while looking for some stuff and I found My very first try at writting a song. I decided to share it with you all

If you look through my eyes,
You'll see that what is keeping me alive
Is also tearing me apart
Don't blame yourself honey 
Cause it's I who can't figure out
that love is not you and I

Now I ask your help
to free myself from 
the prison of my heart
Slap me, Kick me
but donT' say you love me

When I look through your eyes
I'll see your false promise
crumble under his oath
to love and protect
He is not at fault, nor are you 
cause you saw that he was streonger than me

Now I ask your help
to free myself from 
the prison of my heart
Slap me, Kick me
but donT' say you love me

If a day when the sun shine 
You cross me on the street
You'll see the storm in my eyes
and the shadow of my loosing you following me
I can't stop it anymore but don't blame yourself
It's me who can't forget
You're Gone."

"event","That day when I woke up, Life was empty
there was nothing but fight
blood and Death were sharing my bed
as often as I was courting them in battle.
each day was a copy of the one before
then one day,
the day of a fight that would have reft me of my life,
I met You and from that day on, My life changed
Where I was living to fight
I was now fighting to Live and defend
each night sleeping to dream of You,
now I live hoping to see You again,
and to feel You close to Me
to be able to tell You
I love You.

Then I found You again
and before I could resolve Myself
to,with all My Heart declare My Love To You
I learned that You were already taken
and That day My Heart shattered
and to the Eight corner of the Universe
The Shard went away
From that Day on
I now Court Death till She Claim Me


Note
this is an old poem so I wouldn't really worry about it, it is though one of My best, I think."

"event","when I though I was safe 
behind those alabaster walls of mine
you sent creepers and vines 
to tears and bring them down 
while the troops of your heart 
charged and attacked mine
and low did they bring My defenses
down to the ground and beyond
yet for naught did they war
as the fortress of your heart
has already been conquered
and flower and stars 
were born from that conquest
thus making the yearning 
that fill My ruined halls
bitter in defeat from a war
lost, soundly crushed and defeated
since another loving heart
fill thee with boundless power."

You take a while to fall in love with someone. Trust takes time.

You tend to give more than take in relationships.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>"

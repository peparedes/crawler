I know a year has gone by snice you last saw your mom in her earthly form. I know greive is different for everyone.
But remember she is totaly free from pain, suffering, and has a totaly new body, and is so enjoying worshiping with her Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 

Write me about your nightmares. I may be able to sheild some light on them. 

Love ya

"event","I had a great weekend with you at your place last weekend. 

On Wednesday, I had a doctor's appointmnet to get some results back from blood tests taken two weeks ago. I knew he was going to tell me how my choclestol was way to high, but was unprepared for the next bit of news. I have diabetes and don't know what type as of yet as my family doctor is trying to get me in to see a specialist.

On Thursday, I was feeling not very well. So my mom took me into the hospital.(I had a very quite male nurse, but he wore a wedding ring). ---Crystal, I don't think I have any more blood to give. He took 4 beer bottle size of bottles plus 6 little tubes. Just to come back and tell me my white cells are up, but they can not find a reason for that.

I feel very much like that song Emotional girl. 
Please keep the above to yourself and just keep me in your prayers.
Marilyn"

I am not to sure about the workings of this program or site. I have been answering every single one of your entries, but as a commitment. I did not know any other way to answer. Sorry.
I have had a very, very stressful past week and a very stressful weekend. 
Everything is coming do at once, teacher screwing up on the writing of theory part of a midterm, majour project due for Excel, and last but not least my Uncle's funeral yesterday, which has wiped me out.
My dad has not been himself, this week. ( which has added to my burdens,, too.
Well, got to run and do some work before Church.

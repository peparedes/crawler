Losing friends has become a large part of my life but im still here maybe weaker than i could be a little down but im not out and too far away from from done.  Theres all sorts of ppl i hate but one kind that really gets me is the peopel who leave anonmous comments saying things which do not make any sense like: Re:

2004-02-08 18:18 (link)  
hahah yeah.... helping the situation is saying that to jimmy...??? um.. dont think so......... he knew nothing good could come outa saying that so she shudnt have said it. <~~end

  OK....   if you cant show yuor face in battle than u dont belong in it and if this possibly mite be soemoen who doesnt want to get me mad than you obviously dont deserve to be my friends because thats not what friends are supposed to be about a friend has your back no matter what and i only have a handful of peopel who stand behind me and i need noone but them leave one and show ur face if you dont have my back dont be ananmous suck it up and let e knwo you dotn like me cuz odds are i already hate you outta here ;)"

LeaveMeForDeadx: even though you know i dont want you to
XpaintitblakX: lol yea i did
LeaveMeForDeadx: hahah.. you think its funny
LeaveMeForDeadx: i fucking hate you
LeaveMeForDeadx: dan you dont realize that jimmy wont talk to me at lunches or anything because he doesnt like what my friends say to him and stuff? and that you hurt me more than you hurt him
LeaveMeForDeadx: that you just fucking make me miserable when i ask you nto to talk to jimmy anyway
LeaveMeForDeadx: i asked you politely and the first itme you did i let it slid
LeaveMeForDeadx: e
LeaveMeForDeadx: but now its li ekthis big game
LeaveMeForDeadx: that you just go against what i ask because no one even respects me
LeaveMeForDeadx: no one cares
XpaintitblakX: wel look sliek hes more important than what i considered my best friend 
XpaintitblakX: peace kim i hate you to
LeaveMeForDeadx signed off at 10:47:31 PM.

GoodTimesGoneX: im not here to harass u its not my buisness... but if i dont believe in god or heven or a hell
GoodTimesGoneX: where do i go when i die
Thru These Eyes3: uhm
Thru These Eyes3: dude
Thru These Eyes3: please don't bother me about religion
Thru These Eyes3: you certainly wouldn't be satisfied with the answer i'd give you
GoodTimesGoneX: im jw since kim is going to hell i guess
GoodTimesGoneX: so only your religion is right though
Thru These Eyes3: dude
Thru These Eyes3: that's what religion is
GoodTimesGoneX: other baptists dont think that are they sinning
Thru These Eyes3: believing that something is right
GoodTimesGoneX: but not having acceptance for other religions
Thru These Eyes3: uhm
Thru These Eyes3: that's not what religion is
GoodTimesGoneX: were taught to accept so i gues were sinning
Thru These Eyes3: because if you believe in something
Thru These Eyes3: ?!
Thru These Eyes3: yeah well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto response from Thru These Eyes3: aghhhh 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thru These Eyes3: you never seemed to want to talk to me when i was with her
Thru These Eyes3: so i don't see the point of talking to me now
Thru These Eyes3: your questions are . . . well . . . i dk how to be polite about it, i'm sorry
Thru These Eyes3: so i'll leave you alone
GoodTimesGoneX: notice i stopped talking i dont care if u broke up with he ri wasn tfriends with u b4 and so i cant say nething to you i just had a few questions seeing as how seem to have the right to tell people where there goin where they die
GoodTimesGoneX: noone has a right to not a priest or a pastor
GoodTimesGoneX: or to try to save people 
Thru These Eyes3: okay it's not a right
Thru These Eyes3: it's what i believe
Thru These Eyes3: and it's what i believe is true
Thru These Eyes3: and how can i accept other religions when they sound wrong
GoodTimesGoneX: well than keep it to yourself
Thru These Eyes3: like when they go against what you think
Thru These Eyes3: you don't accept it
Thru These Eyes3: yeah well kim asked why i was breaking up with her
Thru These Eyes3: so i told her
GoodTimesGoneX: there what we think we dont go questoning you do we no we dont only when u tell my closest friend that she is going to hell when she dies
Thru These Eyes3: yeah i said that's what i believe

Thru These Eyes3: see though
Thru These Eyes3: you don't even give me a chance to explain

Thru These Eyes3: there's no point in trying to have a conversation with you about it
Thru These Eyes3: or kim
Thru These Eyes3: or anyone
Thru These Eyes3: i tried
Thru These Eyes3: i did
Thru These Eyes3: if you thought people were going to be in pain forever after they died wouldn't you let them know and try to help them?
GoodTimesGoneX: yea because you are way to inferior for us to talk to with you being a baptist
Thru These Eyes3: inferior
Thru These Eyes3: okay

Thru These Eyes3: because i'm sick of it
Thru These Eyes3: i've been sick of it
GoodTimesGoneX: i wasnt fighting you took it as an attack or maybe its just because im not a religious person
GoodTimesGoneX: and i went against kims words doing this she told me not to so dont go and blame this on me
GoodTimesGoneX: her*

GoodTimesGoneX: u conceeded little bastard
Thru These Eyes3: i'm sure you wouldn't believe a lot of things i could tell you
GoodTimesGoneX: omg thats way cross the line

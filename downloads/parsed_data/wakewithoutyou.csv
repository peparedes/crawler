Yesterday I went over to Christians at about 4ish and he was still in bed as he had a busy night the night before. Him, Oggie, Steven and Melissa did acid on friday night and they spent the whole night trying to convince Oggie that he wasn't dead (he believed he had been hit by a car or something...). Anyway I went through and woke Oggie up instead. We had a joint then he had to go see someone so I was on my own again. I tried waking Christian up but damnit that boy can sleep through anything. So I climbed into bed with him to keep warm and I fell asleep.

We woke up about 9pm and made food. Oggie came back about 11pm and we spend about half an hour <b>raiding</b> the flat for Christians credit card. Then we went to the cinema and saw <b><i>Star Wars Episode 3 : Revenge Of The Sith</i></b> at 12am. The film finished about half 2 and we just went home and had a few joints then I fell asleep on Oggies bed with my head on Christians lap. 

This morning we just kinda sat around and played Xbox. Its actually fun when I watch Christian play x-box cause I tell him what to do in the game and he does it so I'm constantly like ""<u>BLOW THAT UP!</u>""

Today I painted the rest of my room and its finally finished.. But its currently a tip so I will put up pictures tomorrow.

Yesterday I went over to Christians. We hung out playing Xbox all day and I lay there making the most random comments you have ever heard.. At about 10 we went out to Mikeys cause he was all lonely cause there was no one else in. We got there and just hung out. We had a few beers and smoked some joints. We were watching L A Confidential. Then they put some other film on and I fell asleep like right at the start. I woke up and the tv was black and I looked around to see Christian putting on his hoodie, getting ready to go. So I basically had been asleep for ages. We started walking back but then I realised I forgot my phone so we had to go back again. When we were walking home we decided to run through all the drunk people hehe. It was funny cause they were all falling over whilst trying to shout ""GOTHS!"" We got back and made twizlers and chips (<b>SO</b> fucking good!) and then went to bed. We didnt get out of bed until about 3 today. Then we went for a walk around town before I had to get my bus and we bumped into Stobie and Angel who we noticed the other night were holding hands so we kinda guess there back together. Yaye. L&hearts;ve all round.

I had a brilliant weekend. On friday I went to Kanes flat and hung out with him, John and Barry for a while. We had a beer then went over to Helens where we met Stuart and co and drank some more. Then Christian gave me a call and Kane, Stuart, John and Helen all walked me to meet him and then they went out drinking. Me and Christian went back to Stevens where there was a party. There were many people there I had never seen before but Vent, Coop, Frolik, Kier, Craig and Oggie were there. We all just basically got <b>rather</b> drunk and stoned. There was however this complete wanker there who was trying to start shit. We don't even know why he was there. No one knew him..
<b>Wanker:</b> So I thought there was meant to be a party with loads of hot blondes not this fucking mosh pit.
<b>Vent:</b> What do you mean <i>""mosh pit""</i>?
<b>Wanker:</b> Your all just a bunch of gothic stoner people.. Wheres the decent people?
Then he started asking this guy who I think was called Ryan if he was gay. I wanted to throw something at him. Fucking shit head. 
Anyways me and Christian left Stevens at about half 3. We eventually went to sleep when the sun was coming up. The next day we went back to Stevens and the place was a complete tip. There was beer spilled everywhere and about 50 knocked over ash trays. Oopsie. Me and Christian just watched movies and stuff for the rest of the day. We went for a walk down the beach which was cool as well.
On Sunday me, Christian and Oggie were attempting to piss off the football fans and we hung a flag out of the flat window saying ""Aberdeen Suck"". Oggie attatched a smiley face bit of cardboard to a bit of string and hung it down to the ground and was having conversations with whoever walked past. It was very funny. Me and Oggie walked to the bus station and Oggie was going up to everyone screaming <b>Smiley face make you happy all day!</b> Completely random.

I can't stop being happy lately. Yaye. I love it."

Why am I still ill? I should be feeling better by now! <b>Eurgh.</b>

<u>My Weekend:</u>

<b>Saturday</b>: I went over to Christians at about 4ish. We didn't really do much. We went shopping for a bit then came back and watched Mallrats then just messed about for the rest of the night. I fell asleep on the couch cause I felt all ill. When I woke up I managed to stay awake long enough to get undressed and then me and Christian just went to sleep.

<b>Sunday</b>: On Sunday we woke up and got picked up by his parents and they drove us to Costco so we went shopping for mass amounts for food. I haven't seen his parents in like a year so it was nice seeing them again. We sat in the cafe for a bit and they bought me a drink then we went back to his parents house in Oldmeldrum. Me and Christian took Caddy for a walk in the woods and Christian helped me get over my fear of scary horses. There was a really nice on in a field next to the woods. After we came back Christians mum cooked us a big meal and I am surprised I managed to eat it all cause there was so much. We ate it all sitting round the table which I normally hate doing but I didn't mind this time. Then I went and sat in the living room with his mum and his grandad and watched tv with them whilst Christian and his dad were trying to fix the fax machine. His dad drove us back to Aberdeen at about 10 and we just hung out at his a little while then we watched <i>""Sin City""</i> (some random film he downloaded which was actually pretty good). Then we went to sleep cause he didn't want me to stay up any longer cause I have an exam to revise for. Its so sweet how he cares for me like that.

<b>Monday:</b> I had to go back to Inverurie early like I promised my mum so I could revise for my exam on Wednesday so I got up and got ready. Christian was still asleep so I kissed him goodbye, told him I loved him then ran to catch my bus. I got back home about 11am. Dean was home so we hung out which was cool cause I haven't seen him in a while. He made me the finest cheese toastie ever. Yummeh.

I found out who it was that managed to convince mum to lift my grounding. It was Dean. He spoke to her about it and managed to get her to let me go out. I would have <b><i>never</i></b> have expected him to do that. I have the best brothers.

Kanes coming home tomorrow as well <b>finally!</b> I havent seen him in ages.

 &hearts; Last Night&hearts;<br></font></font><font face = ""Century Gothic"">
Last night I went over to Christians. I had such an ace time. I have had a pretty crap week cause of a lot of my friends leaving school to go off to university so last night cheered me up. 
We hung out at Christians for a while. He taught me how to successfully shoot a gun. <b>I feel proud of myself</b>. We were shooting a garden gnome with a ball bearing gun which was pretty dangerous cause shards of it were flying everywhere and bouncing off Oggies head and everything. Eventually Oggie just picked it up and smashed it down because it was annoying him. 
We went out to Mikeys at about half 11. Me, Christian, Rik, Mikey, Oggie and Calum were all there but Calum was asleep so we kept throwing stuff at him to see how much it would take to wake him up. We watched Scary Movie 3 and got incredibly stoned whilst just having a laugh. We lost about 10 lighters last night so Mikey lit his cigarette using his toaster. We left about 4am and got back to the flat about half 4. I just went to sleep after eating all of Oggies toast. Christian and me woke up about half two. Its weird how we always seem to wake up at the same time. Like I wake up and he's just opening his eyes at that point aswell. Im next seeing him tomorrow night. Hopefully I will feel better. He was trying to take care of me all of last night cause I have the flu (so I guess getting stoned wasn't the best idea). 

<u>Some Funny Quotes:</U>

<i>Sitting in Mikeys flat</i>
<b>Christian:</b> Haha Riks in the worst situation. He has a girlfriend and <i>still</i> isn't getting any.
*Everybody Laughs*
<b>Rik:</b> No man. Stop... its <b>REALLY</B> not funny...

<i>Watching Scary Movie 3</i>
<b>Calum (Screaming in his sleep):</b> FUCK YOU MIKE
<b>Mikey (Looking confused):</b> What the? Did he?..... FUCK YOU!

<i>All sitting VERY stoned by this point</i>
*Mikey flicks ash on sleeping Calum.*
<b>Rik:</b> Fuck Mike that was really callous... Hey chelsea... Go throw a shoe at his head..

<i>At the bus stop</i>
<b>Oggie (Standing on top of the bus stop seat dancing and singing):</b> We are waiting at the bus stop for Miss Chelsea to get her bus because she has an exam tomorrow laa dee daaa exam tomorrowwwwwwww
<b>Chelsea:</b>Jesus.... its like a friggin..... musical.

<i>Sitting at Mikeys just all being stoned..</I>
*TOTAL silence for about 2 minutes..*
<b>Rik</b>: Hey Christian.... Do you and Chelsea have really violent sex?"

Ok so yeah I havent updated in <b>forever</b>. Well I have reasons. I have been revising/grounded/busy.

Not a lot has happened. There was this whole thing at school where undercover police came and did drug searches on a load of people. People are <b><i>still</i></b> talking about it. They just like the drama. I couldn't give to fucks. I didn't have anything on me so I had nothing to be worried about. 

I got my grounding lifted on Saturday so I was like straight over at Christians. I missed him so much. We had the bestest time. I threw a mini tantrum at one point and slammed his bathroom door and the curtain rail fell down.. So you couldn't help but laugh. I couldn't actually go to the toilet for ages cause all the lights fused and there was no other light in the bathroom so he told me I would have to go with the door open. But I refuse to go to the toilet with the door open. So that was rather funny. We basically hung out and watched films, drew on each other, ate chocolate cake and the usual other stuff. I was only away from him for a week and a half. But it felt like months. Staying over again on Wednesday.

<b>""See.. Your half asleep, still pretty and I love you.""</b>
His response to me saying I look stupid when half asleep. Theres nothing to argue back to that except:
<b>""uh... PAH!""</B>"

Today was one of those days. Where you just can't be assed with anything. The weather was shit and I was really tired so I felt like crap. I went over to Christians for the majority of the day and he was trying his best to cheer me up. I remember he said this. Which was the sweetest thing ever:

<b>""Hey listen to me. I love you. You are the most amazing girl in this world. I would trade the world just for you. And I dont understand why you think so little of yourself. If I had every girl in the worl wanting me I would trade them all just for you. I love you.""</b>

I nearly cried. He is just the bestest.

Oggie was over for a while and he bought me a badge from Retros. It just says ""School Is Shit"". He bought me is cause he is always asking me how school is and he always gets that response. Kinda thoughtful.

I so didnt want to go home today. But I am seeing him on Friday.. staying Friday night.. All of Saturday and staying Saturday night and then spending all of Sunday with him. Except at night he's going to the Fetish Night at Moshulu. Lots of randoms dressed up in bondage gear getting whipped. Hes going with Oggie and I SO hope Oggie gets whipped. Cause he'll blow a fuse. Many people would think that I would be jealous of Chucky going to Fetish night seeing a bunch of half naked women being spanked.. but I'm not. I trust him. And I know what he's like when hes out drinking. He just doesnt care about whats going on around him...

Yup it was ace. I went over to Christians on Saturday and we just hung out at the flat mostly. Frolik, Coop and Vent showed up and Frolik came running in and jumped on me and Christian who were under the covers..

<b>Frolik:</b> Shit are you guys naked?
<b>Me and Christian:</b> Yes you wanker.
<b>Frolik:</b> FUCK *runs out*
<b>Christian:</b> I FEEL VIOLATED!

At night we all went out drinking. We were meant to go to The Bassment but they I.D'd vent who is unfortunately only 17 and looks about 15. So instead they went to The Moorings and Me and Christian met them there after we got food. We sat there (well I sat on Christians knee cause there werent any seats left) and just drank and pissed about. Some funky dancing from me and Frolik. Oh yes. We went to go to Kef afterwards but they were I.Ding <B>everyone</b>. So we went to Revolution. All the guys were fucking about with vodka shots but the vodka shots from Revolution taste like shit. So I stuck with my Jack Daniels and Coke. After fucking about in Revolution for a while we went home. Frolik wanted food so he stopped at the Tastie Tattie.

<b>Frolik:</b> Shit its shut. FUCK
<b>Kier:</b> Really? 
<b>Frolik:</b> Ohh.. no wait... was pushing on the wrong side of the door.

Ok so we were pretty drunk. Christian pushed Frolik on the ground in the middle of the road and he nearly got hit by a car which was pretty funny.. Christian kept grabbing my arm and started waltzing with me in the middle of the street. We got into Safeway car park and Frolik decided to try and kick down a big tree. But Coop started being a hippy and hugging it. And I seem to remember Kier sitting on top of a bus stop. I saw a big Safeway sign which I thought would be a good idea to steal.. As a joke. So they tried to steal it but it just looked like it wasn't happening. We were almost at the flat and I remember Frolik peeing on some random guys car.. Christian stole some random street sign and stuck it on someones car. Kier tried to climb a wall and just fell off. Then more dancing in the street.

We got back to the flat and smoked weed in Kiers room. Christian was sitting on a seat and I was sitting on the floor next to him and I just fell asleep with my head on his lap. Which now earned me the nickname Kitty / Cat from Frolik cause apparently I looked like a cat when I fell asleep. 

Christian was being so sweet this weekend. When I was almost asleep on his lap he leaned down and whispered in my ear ""I Love You"". Rarrr I love him so much. When we were walking through Safeway car park he started singing Atreyu - Bleeding Mascara. His voice is so hot. And it made me love him even more which I didn't think was possible.</font></font>

Today was pretty dull. I was hyper on Pez the entire day. And those little milk bottle sweets. And I drank way too much coffee this evening. 

My lip is all swollen.. Damn pen.

Chloe wants me to lend her money for fake ID's. They're not going to work for much longer the company will get busted so I shall keep my 20 pounds thank you.

Gave Christian a call last night but the call didnt last long. He called me earlier and we had an awesome conversation for like an hour but then his phone ran out of battery so he's calling me later.

And this film is the best ever (apart from Pirates Of The Carribean of course...) I remember the first time I saw it. Christian ordered me to rent it. Then we watched it together at his mums house. Awe it was awesome.

I'm having one of those days. I really couldn't be assed with school so I came home.

I want to be at Christians flat with him instead of at home and being int he middle of Dean and Mum's little battles. Might call him later. I just want a huggle from him.

I caught my lip on a pen lid and now part of its all swollen.

I redid my entire VampireFreaks profile last night. It was annoying me. I took some new pictures today but Im not feeling totally photogenic so they arent so great.

Wedensday Hurry up so I can see Christian you wanker.


Was thinking earlier today and I dont know why he loves me. He said he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and everying but sometimes I really don't see why. No im not looking for sympathy im just hormonal!

I am just lucky to have him. Forever and ever ^_^

He's told Mikey, Rik and Kier about our little announcement. But I didn't actually hear what they said about it.

My guess is:

Mikey: WOAH dude thats cool
Rik: FUCK
Keir: Engaged? What? eh? When did this happen?!

Poor clueless keir"

I was at Christians all weekend. I was only meant to stay over on Friday night but I wanted to stay longer so I ended up staying on Saturday night too.

On Friday we were meant to go out for a meal but we got distracted and by the time we eventually decided to go out everywhere was kinda full so we ended up getting a pizza from Pizza Hut and we went back to his flat and watched Battle Royale (Which is a gruesome but bloody ace movie). Then we watched some episodes of Invader Zim and South Park. Then we went to bed.

The next day we woke up at like half 2 but we didnt actually get out of bed until about half 4. Then we went to the shops for a while and went back to the flat. Oggie came round and we pissed about for a while and then we went to Safeway to buy munch. We ended up leaving with sausages, bacon, eggs, beans, potato wedges, bread, two big chocolate cakes, flapjack mix, cookie mix, sprite, chocolate trifle and 3 big packets of oriental crackers. So much for a small munchies trip. So we went back to the flat and we argued about who was all going to cook it all. Eventually we managed to convince Oggie but Christian had to help with some of it cause Oggie cant cook to well but Oggie nearly killed himself trying to force Christian into the kitchen to cook. I just kinda pointed and laughed. Then we ate the food after it was finally cooked whilst watching Scarface. Then I fell asleep on Kiers bed and when I woke up Oggie was gone. So me and Christian went through to his room and lay hugging for a while to try and warm up cause it was fucking cold. We fell asleep and eventually woke up today at like half 3. 

When we were going to sleep last night he made up a playlist on winamp and Hoobastank - The Reason came on and he just hugged me extra hard and held my hand. So I'm like loving that song cause it reminds me of how close we were last night just hugging and kissing and everything. 

But yeah I had a great time. Weee he makes me so happy.

I &hearts; Him So Much"

"event","I went to see Christian yesterday. Which was totally awesome. 

We went to HMV first cause the retards forgot to actually give him the CD that he bought. They just gave him the case. Afterwards we went to Safeway to get food but yet again Christian forgot his wallet so I had to wander about Safeway until he got back with it. I bumped into Kane and Stuart in Safeway so I spoke to them for a while whilst waiting for Christian to get back.

Then we went back to the flat and went sat on Kiers bed hugging and watched Oggie play Merchanaries... badly. Then Sam and Cherie showed up. And we were all being mean to Cherie and pinning her down and tickling her. But she was thrashing about too much so we selotaped her hands together and then selotaped her hands to her knees. 

Then me and Christian just kinda went into couple mode and ignored everyone in the room and just sat kissing and hugging. Then Sam, Cherie, Kier and Oggie left and Christian asked me to marry him again. only this time face to face. I said yes of course. Then we just like started kissing non stop which ended up in total awesome as you can guess.

Then we made pizza but then I had to go so he walked me back to the bus stop and waiting there with me. I didn't want to go and he was trying to get me to fake being ill so I could stay with him. 

But I am seeing him tomorrow. He's taking me out for dinner to celebrate everything.

I saw Christian today. Which was akward in a way cause we didn't totally know what to say. But we were both sitting on the bench in Kellands park and I just looked at him. He just went ""Uh.. What?"" and I just leaned over and kissed him. It was the best kiss I have had in about 4 months. So that broke the akwardness of it all and we were back to normal. He kept tickling me and making me squeak. Hehe. I skipped study to hang out with him longer in Kellands cause I missed him so much and it just feels so great to be back to normal. <b>And More <3</b>

I now have more than one key on my keyring. He gave me the keys to his flat. All three. So I no longer have to use the buzzer.

<b>Yaye. Happiness.</b>"

It was completely brilliant. I was the first one there cause that was the only time I could get over. Then Ben showed up but I like didn't know what to say cause Chloe and Ben just broke up but are in the akward stage of the whole ""be friends"" thing. Luckily Chris showed up after that with the alcohol. Then eventually everyone started showing up; Calum, Kev, Trail, Rory, Michaela, Louise, Jack, Wood, Fitz, Jill, Steph, Anna, Greg, Mark and a few other randomers I didn't know but spoke to anyway. 

I can't remember what the hell I drank. I remember Baileys, Tequila shots (they were damn funny), Vodka and lots of wine. And im sure there was other stuff too. But yeah in the end I was pretty drunk but so was everyone. There was also a bong going about but I was good and didn't touch it.

Trail kept trying to tickle me and he wouldnt bugger off. Then Rory kept trying to hug me and he kissed my neck and I was like ""What the fuck? Rory fuck off."" and then he went and locked himself in the toilet for the rest of the night. We think he passed out cause he was fucked. Calum nearly broke my ribs cause he kept bloody sitting on me. We put on some totally shit music and started dancing our asses off. We all decided to go for an adventure and started running around Daviot outside and Greg streaked through the streets. And Rory egged some house and the guys were out hunting for him later. Jack was so amazingly stoned and he had the constant giggles. I also remember tying someone to a chair with selotape and we wrote all over him with permenant marker...

I eventually got the taxi home at like 3am with Greg, Jack and Wood. And I basically just fell into bed. Now I have a slight hangover but it was completely worth it.."

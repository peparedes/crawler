"event","I haven't talked to Reece since Tuesday. Four days. It seems like...longer. He moved into his appartment and doesn't have phone or internet yet, and he told me that he'd find a way to communicate, and I have no way of getting to him and BAH. Stupid. Last night had a party at Allie's house. Was fun. Talked with Allie about death. Talked with ze girls about masturbating--very funny. Got really drunk. Felt like shit all day today, laid in bed all day feeling like shit. Don't know what to do. Eating dinner in a bit. Probably gonna take a shower. I've been drawing a lot with my new pens, mostly trees for some reason. I wonder...something about the big dorm room bed and peices of foam. Gllllrrzelphit. I have horrible dry skin. Its like I'm dying or something, and my skin is just gonna start peeling off until I'm nothing but a pile of blood and muscle and nerves and a heart torn in half. Ah, ees poetic. Talked to Kendra on New Years (my parents let me have a party! It was very much fun. and nothing broke) and haven't since, I tried calling her cell and left a message, maybe she didn't bring it. I dunno. I miss her lots, its worse after seeing her again, and its only been a few days. What does it say about me that I just sink when some of the people I love are far away? Can't I just be strong? Be independant? Maybe. Maybe those things aren't really connected. My mom told me it was a good characteristic to have, to form such strong bonds with people. But it hurts so much more when they break. Not break. No breaking. Stretching. Gah. I just feel depressed today. And then I feel bad for feeling depressed because I'm home with my wonderful loving family. I went shopping with my mom yesterday for work clothes for her and it was SO nice. She's coming to visit me in March. I feel like a little girl who just has this life she can't handle. I feel overwhelmed, unable to exist. Waiting around for something. For death, yeah, I know the feeling Reece. It's saturday night. And I'm just melting. Gonna try and shower away bad mood. 
Love, Cecilia"

"event","So I'm home again. Its like going back in time. Its like I'm not supposed to be here. It's like Minneapolis wasn't real, and I've been here all along. It's like I've been in a coma or something. I feel broken. I miss Reece, but I miss Meredith more. Being without her is like being without my right arm, I am unable to communicate as well as I would have been with her--like I'm writing with my left hand. Its like being lost. I slept on the couch last night, and missed Reece. I miss the way our hands fit together, the way our bodies fit together, how we can just melt into each other in whatever position we're lying in. This is all unreal, things that aren't happening. I'm so tired and sick of being sick. Nothing has changed, but then everything has, because I've changed. A lot. So being here...its too different and too similar and the contradiction is almost too much to handle. It isn't as bad as it was yesterday, but I'm still shattered, slowly being put back together, but with gaping holes. Too weird. Talked to Meredith last night, she misses me too. Hopefully I'll have a wonderful Christmas and time will fly and I can be back soon, into Reece's arms and kisses and sweetness. Absense makes the heart grow fonder. That's all for now. I want some drugs. 
Love, Cecilia"

"event","So thanksgiving was fun. Wednesday night everyone was gone from our room and I didn't want to stay there by myself, so Reece stayed with me until late and his parents came to pick him up. Very nice, thank you! We went for a walk down by the river, and it was snowing really softly with almost no wind, and everything was lit in this weird orange light...I've seen this before and I think that it is my favorite time EVER. When it's dark and everything is magically covered in snow, all the sounds muffled so there's a peaceful quiet layered over everything--I would rather be in those moments then sunbathing on the beach or shopping or winning the lottery. Perfect beauty. 
I came to my Aunt Sharon's house for Thanksgiving, and my oma and opa and uncle and cousin Terah from Brown University were here, as well as Johann, Sharon's son (my other cousin) The meal was wonderful, but I missed my dad's turtle rolls. Bread rolls shaped like turtles so you can bite their heads off. :) After Thanksgiving we went to Johann's dad's friends house (mariah) and played risk after having a ""Waking Life"" worthy conversation. Seriously. I felt like I was in a movie. John, Johann's dad and Sharon's first husband, told me I dressed and looked exactly like my mother when she was my age. (they dated, I think) It made me feel nice. Nobody won risk, I got obliterated cause I'm never good at games like that, but fun all the same. Then we went to Johann's friend Tivo? Something like that, we went to his house to watch this Tamil movie that Terah had with THE most famous Indian actor who has god-like status there. Very weird. He's been a star since the 80's, and still is despite the fact that he's like 40 and unnattractive. Baba. Ha. The movie was great, very overdone etc. etc. etc. Then I feel asleep. Reece called me to say happy thanksgiving. 
Now I'm still at my aunts house using her eMac (very cool) and waiting for Meredith to call me and come pick me  up so that I can shower etc. and then go to her house for the rest of the weekend. Maybe visit Reece at work. I can't believe I only have two weeks left for school after this! CANNOT wait to go home and see my family and kendra and everyone. Sigh. The snow here is cold. And there's lots. Of snow. Okay, ees all for now. Happy Thanksgiving!
Love, Cecilia"

"event","So Reece came over last night, and when we got in the room he asked if I'd eaten, and then he pulled out french bread. YUM! But it gets better, then he pulled out red wine and olive oil to go with the bread! Wine! He brought me wine! It was so wonderfully kick-ass-romantic. The whole night was. We walked a lot, holding hands (I haven't held hands with anyone in a long time, it was extremely nice), and talked about all the random things that you talk about with someone that you don't know really well, very nice. We drank all the wine, ate the bread, made out (his hands--OH MY FUCKING GOD, didn't know that I could even FEEL like that!) and then more than making out. :) So fucking sexy. He was talking about something and I was kind of casually kissing along his jawbone and then up to his earlobe and he just stopped talking, very cute. Tee hee. Afterwards we went down to the river and watched a barge go by, muchas good conversations. Then I was starving so we went to Taco Bell and he bought be a burritto. Very nice. When we got back Meredith and Brian were already in bed and asleep, so we curled up on the other side of the huge bed and fell asleep too. Waking up was nice. Meredith says she remembered thinking, ""Everyone in the bed was just wonderful!"" It was kick ass. He's stopping by after work to pick up the things he forgot. Wheee! I don't know what kind of karma I'm getting, but it kicks serious ass. I mean, red wine! I LOVE red wine! And so does he! And it was GOOD red wine! Ah sigh. Crushy-fluttering good feelings. C'est tres bon.

"event","so, Meredith's boyfriend (Brian's) best friend is this guy Reece who just moved back here from California. And he's really cute. And nice. A lot. :):):):):) And tonight the four of us went out for dinner (thai--yummy!) and he PAID for my dinner! Very cool, thank you. And he's cute. :) A lot. So we came back here all flirty and stuff, and Meredith and Brian went to get soda from the basement of Pioneer, and Reese and I were flirty talking, and I was asking him what color contacts I should get, and intead of answering he just leaned down and kissed me. And it was SUCH a good kiss! Soft at first, and his tongue...oh god. It was kick ass. And then we kissed a lot more. It's like he knows all these little things that I know really turn me on, and he just does them and it's sexy and yumyumyum! I have this giddy crushy feeling, and he REALLY likes me, so says Brian. So it isn't a casual Jon-stupid not calling me thing. I hope. I hope this goes well. Probably tomorrow night we're going out again to see a DJ, very cool. I have a HORRIBLE headache so now I will sleep. Yay! Dreams of Reece!"

"event","So in my creative writing discussion class we had an excersize that was simply, ""I remember..."" and then we had to go from there. The first thing that pops into my head is phil, and the day I broke up with Patrick and walked home with him, when we got together. So I wrote about it, and about the love letters, and about the carved Morningside Inn food, and the picture he drew of me when I got back from Madagascar...blah blah blah, and now I just feel like shit. 
Before I left we had this great conversation, not losing touch, I'm so glad you're one of my best friends, lets never lose contact...and then as soon as I get here he acts like I'm intellectually insanely inferior to him. Which makes sense, you know, now that I'm in COLLEGE. Whenever we talk online he's always making fun of me, or telling me that I'll never be happy with anything, basically belittling my existence. He ALWAYS has some sort of criticism (how the fuck do you spell that?), wether its my instant messenger icon or the fact that I'm about to watch a movie with Meredith, ""Didn't you READ my essay on entertainment? It was brilliant!"" Yes, I read it. It made sense, and had some good points, not all though. Not all entertainment is evil, darling. I don't even have cable, I only watch like two shows, and only good movies...and goddamnit, see? I feel like I have to defend myself whenever I talk to him! Not really great best-friendly vibes! He told me once that I have a shallow life, and that I watch too much TV, and I can't possibly have anything worthwhile to say if that's all I do. 
In so many words. 
And then when I got mad and, yes, tried to defend myself, he LAUGHED at me. Can't you take a joke, Cecilia? Not when that's all you do! Is make jokes at my expense and make me feel like shit! Not fun! I try to talk to him about my life and all I get is condescension (again, sp?). He doesn't try to tell me about his life when I ask. How's Maria? How's life. All I get is, ""I'm working."" Which is good, for him. Whenever I call he's working, and he never calls back like he says he will. Liar-head. It's like being in an emotionally abusive relationship or something else equally ridiculous. I feel like screaming at him (and I did, and that's probably why he hasn't been calling me the last few days) all the things I do, like I write for at least 5 hours every day, about a million different things. My vampires, the river, fate, walking, music, my classes, my parents...ANYthing that comes to mind. I feel like telling him that, and that Meredith and I walk along the river almost every night, and how beautiful and spiritual that experience is. I feel like I have to PROVE myself to him. That's stupid. I don't want friends like that. I want him to fucking listen to me instead of laughing and telling me to lighten up after he makes horrible assumptions after I say one not even incriminating thought. I hate the way he makes me feel, and I wish that I didn't care and that I could just push it away, but when its someone who I thought was so close to me...I can't just ignore it! I don't know what to do. Everytime I try to talk to him he just makes me madder and I lose my temper and then he laughs at me for being angry and I just don't want to talk to him anymore. Stupid. I hate it. 
On a lighter note, I got a job today, it'll only give me some extra cash, but money is nice. Makes me feel a little better about my current financial situation. My mom is back safe and sound, and my anxiety levels decreased now that's she's safe. It's wonderful to be able to talk to her again! So yah. That's all for now. Enjoy my rants. 
Love, Cecilia"

"event","Went to the wilson library, got some russian literature to keep me busy. it was a really nice walk. We (Meredith and I) looked at the river lots. It's inky black at night when you cross the bridge. Weird and sci-fi-ish. 
Now we're drinking stolen pop (yes, pop, that's what they SAY in MN) and eating chips and watching Rebel without a cause. :)

"event","I started my period last. night. Cramps from hellish dimensions, which is kind of scary because I watched the second Alien movie this morning after french class, and now I have visions of baby aliens bursting through my stomach. Muchas grossness. I got my short story back, and she said that the last thing I should do to consolidate it is to cut down this one conversation between Evan and Veronica...but I LIKE it. bastards. <I>Is this gonna be italic?</I> playing with html. Go me! Tonight Meredith and I will hopefully be having a little party for ourselves, because we're special, and we're gonna watch Ever After and Rebel without a Cause. Lala yay! 
Angel last night was funny, great line about spike being having sex with robots. Laughed until I peed. <I> NEXT WEEK LOOKS AWSOME. </I> Angel and Spike and fighting and Drusilla in the beginning! YAY!!!! SO great. 
When I was working out today, trying to ignore the alien babies in my stomach, there was an intense fan blowing on me, and when  I closed my eyes the fan combined with the sloping eliptical machine made it seem like I was flying, and peddling this huge leo davinci type of machine...very nice imagry. Got an idea for a story. Should be good. I'll post it, and the Veronica and Evan one when it's actually done with all ze corrections. That's all for now. I feel like a big, ovary  infested cow. I don't care about how to spell ovary right. 
Love, Cecilia

Waking up at 8:15AM for my french class. Its cold. Wah. After french class I came in and there were all these janitor guys in our room. Apparently there are three valvey things in the entire building for the heaters. One of them happens to be in mine and meredith's bedroom. So now there's a hose going from a hole in the wall going out the window dripping watter. For like THREE DAYS. It's swell. The the cable lady came and gave me back my cable. And now Will and Grace is on. It's nice. 
OKAY, focus here. College is really good, my classes and grades are good. Meredith, the roomate that I share a bedroom with (in my room there's two bedrooms and one big common room), her and I get along really well. Our room KICKS ASS. I'll post pictures later. 
I really don't feel like writing every little detail of the three months that I've been here....but my mommy comes home from India on sunday!!!! yay! 
I met a boy named Jon. Casually casual relationship. Not to fond of those. Lots of...sex. That's good. A lot. :) He's really sweet, just has no motivation. Genius stoner type. Almost fell in love the first time around, got pissed off, made up, got pissed off, made up, got pissed off, made up, decided not to care and just HAVE the casual relationship...and here I stand. I have the images of me as a thirty-something single lady with nothing in life but her fabulous computer graphic design job! :) Just kidding. 
Its fucking cold. 
Angel is tonight, and I'm EXCITED. Yay. That's another thing, I need to stop reading so much Buffy fanfic! I mean, for the love of god! It does nothing but depress me, for chrissakes. AHHH. 
I finished chapter ten of my story. I need to get people reading this again, and if you want to read it just e-mail me and I'll send you what I have done. 
What else? Yesterday I sat outside and read a lot, it was sunny and beautiful, the river all glimery and such. 
I don't feel like I'm ""on the prowl"" for a boyfriend, but being lonely for someone is sort of..fuck, what's the word...made a bigger deal because of me being lonely for everyone else I love. Couldn't think of the word. Ah well. Hopefully Christmas will be nice.
I mean, I have lots of friends here, but no one besides Meredith REALLY CLOSE. 
Blarg. I hate Jon. But I don't. Hopefully the other boy Jake will call...flirting ensues? Oui oui! Okay. That's enough.
My computer still kicks super ass. 
Love, Cecilia"

"event","SO...leaving for college! 
I can't sleep. it sucks. lack of sleep results in lots of stress that I alreay have because of the following:
money
Kendra telling me in a bitter way that I have the perfect life and I get everything I want which is not the case. why does she say that? to make me feel good? to make me feel bad? to make me feel sorry for her? mostly the second one, at least that's the effect. be SUPPORTIVE. whenever YOU go to awsome concerts and talk to the band or get into suprise john malkovich things Im HAPPY for you. I NEED you. Im LEAVING. WAAAAA! also, most of if not all of my male friends are NOT in love with me. 
haven't talked to matt in two weeks. arg. hasn't called me, me still mad at him...blah.
had equivilant of breaking up with noah. I hate it that I like him so much. It was never supposed to be like that, we talked about it and we didn't want anyone (me) to get hurt. blah. haven't talked to him for three days...sigh. I miss everyone already.
there are fucking BEATLES everywhere in the basement. I HATE beatles. 
I have no money. well...almost no money. 
I wish I could sleep. 
I have OH SO MUCH shopping left to do, plus lots of things for my computer
I GAINED weight. fuckers. must jog in morning. 

So, yeah. Good things:
saw Pepper in concert. AWSOME. saw 311 in concert, okay. had fun. seeing RADIOHEAD in concert on wednesday! YAYAY! 
will gives amazing backrubs, relieves tension and helps sleep and mmmmmmmm.... I think maybe ill lock him in my closet and feed him things underneath the door, and only bring him out for backrubs. and to bring me to radiohead concerts.
my laptop is still beautiful
The Book of Games is coming along REALLY WELL. yay. 
Johnny Deep is HOT. 
my new photo album is CUTE.
all my orange office supplies ROCK
crying relieves tension.

I had my last day of work today, and Im exhausted. trueman said he'd give me a cash bonus with my next paycheck. yay. La is annoying. Im in love with everyone. I can't wait till my story is done. YUM.

"event","SO...I honestly cannot remember the last time that I updated on my life for the four or so people who occasionally read it...but I got a FIVE on my AP Lit test. I KICK ASS BABY!!!! WOOHOO! Also I saw Lara Croft 2 last night and it was really good.
I've been writing a lot, and after taking lit and comp classes its interesting to see that all the little foreshadowing, symbolism and metaphors--all that crappola that I already did in all my writing, now I know what to CALL IT. Very much fun, as the story progresses in actual order on my computer, and not just in a pile of papers in my notebook. C'est tres exciting. Also, my computer still rocks. Sigh. 
Matt is obsessed about Noah and my...I guess relationship. Casual not so much really but casual all the same...or something. He's very dramatic about everything, and right now I feel like I should stay where I am with everyone, Matt and Noah. I just really really really wish there was something I could do for Matt that isn't stopping seeing Noah and getting back together with him--because those are the only options he gives me for how I can help. I just really DON'T GET IT. Okay, that's a lie. I get it. I understand the entire situation, why I need Noah, why I still need Matt blah blah blah...BLAH. 
I had my court date and got 20 hrs community service, which I already fufilled. I sat at a desk in an office that was negative five gazillion degrees and typed information into a computer. It was at the animal control center, and one time I got to hold a PUPPY and it was REALLY CUTE, and I want a hampster. Hampsters are cool. I could hide it at my Aunts house. Maybe I'll get a kitty and ask Johann if I can keep it at his house, cause of the whole dorm animal thing not being allowed. 
At Tony's house night before last I definitely made a spectacle out of myself. First when Noah and I came downstairs and everyone cheered, and then with Kimberly, and now if everyone who didn't find out about that at senior week didn't know--now they know. Muahahahahaha...boys are funny. 
And that is about it. 
HERE: is a sample of my story:
Aiden felt himself filling again, and he drank faster, pulled on her sweet blood--ambrosia, like he knew it would be--his lips pressed to her neck so as not to spill a single, precious, delicious, powerful drop. He was falling, falling into her, and it was so, so good, better than anything, ever. The world had dropped away around him and he was surrounded by the full blackness of the universe--power. He didn't notice that she'd started screaming until several seconds after it started, and he broke away from her with massive, painful effort as the anguished cries rose in a crescendo, and the desert reappeared around them. He stared, unable to do anything else, at Jezebel's bloodstained lips, and as her brilliant blue eyes, facing the stars, were burnt to black, the crackling light extinguished. 
Then the air around them was sucked free of sound, and the dry desert ground around them cracked even more and turned gray, spreading as such in a ripple around them, farther and farther, and the earth began to shake, and it was all Aiden could do to hold onto Jezebel as she screamed and screamed and screamed. And even when the earthquake stopped, she was still screaming, and he had to knock her out to take her to the nearest village, where she slept for five days. When she woke she started screaming again, and he had to knock her out again, and it wasn't until a month later that she finally woke and was silent.
And HERE is another tidbit, later on in the story:
The clouds on the horizon looked like tidal waves coming straight for her. Huge, silent, tidal waves, towering miles and miles into the air, coming to swallow her up. Only she would see them, only she would know what was to come before everyone was wrapped in the death grip of... purple clouds. Jezebel swallowed heavily and tore her eyes away from the coming dawn. Anticipating the sun always made her feel like that, like she was just about to be suffocated, but along with that she felt as if all her assumptions were ridiculous. Pastel clouds weren't harbingers of death... but sometimes she wondered. The shutters rattled nervously when she slammed them shut, just as the first sliver of orange globe began to leak over the mountaintops, just as the door burst open and shut just as quickly. When she looked, she was taken aback to see not just Aiden, but a young man with tousled auburn hair and eyes like hers used to be. Used. To. Be. 
""What's this?"" she asked quietly after a pause in which they stared at each other, but she had an inkling as to why this boy was here, with them. The way Aiden was looking at the boy, and the way the boy was looking at her... cat and mouse. 
""He can help you. He... heals. This is Nathaniel. Nathaniel, this is Jezebel."" and her name on his lips sounded like the last whisper of the dead, and suddenly (despite the warmth seeping in from the sun) Jezebel felt very, very cold. 

and I cant wait till its done and everyone can read it and YAY! 
The end. 
Love, Cecilia"

I need to write in this more often, because I always have a million gazillion updates on my LIFE. bah. Firstly, Laura B, you and I have a double date with Johnny really hot Deppypoos and Mr. Legolas Elf cute boy. (!!!) Also, today I saw Legally Blonde 2 with Kendra and we went swimming and out to dinner at Olive Garden and t'was very fun. 
I went and saw Charlie's Angels with Matt and it was VERY FUN and we laughed A LOT. I'm still in love with him. A LOT. I just...I really, REALLY missed him and wanted to be with only him for three days straight after we hung out. I feel...calmer now, I guess, but I can't really shake the feeling that maybe, just maybe I fucked up and ruined whatever we could have. I don't know. Also, I don't REALLY miss Noah, I do a little, but it isn't Earth shattering. Which is good, because of the whole goddamn casual thing, you see. I am not a casual person. Now, don't get me wrong, I can handle having this semi-we're not dating THING with him, and I'll just be paranoid and jealous and Janelle SUCKS. No, seriously. I'm casual. 
ANYway...when I was driving home on east street all the lights were green straight through, which has NEVER happened to me before. I mean, i had to run ONE yellow-red-halfway-through-the-intersection-light, but really it was pretty much IN THE GREEN, hahahahaha....ah *wipes eyes* and then when i looked down at the clock it said 11:48, and LAST NIGHT when I drove home from Tony's house and looked at the clock it was ALSO 11:48. Then I felt weird, like there were too many weird things, and maybe I was going to die or something. But I didnt, I'm in my room writing on my perty computer thinking about obsession and love and the difference between the two so I can work it out in ""The Book of Games"" a novel by Cecilia Rose Ulrich. 
I just want someone--(Noah)--to really like me, so we can have a I really like you fling, instead of more of a this is really really awsome I want to scream my head of I get hot when I just think of it SEX fling. Mm. Mmmmmm. (right, sorry). bah. I'm tired. I don't understand anything, and I hate my job. Fuck Trueman.

I like my friends for who they are, and I don't know if I can find people like that here, people who can understand me like they do. I know I know, I'm sure I will but everything just seems impossible right now. like flying to jupiter or something. however, on a lighter note, my story is going really well and I actually started typing it on my computer, even thought I just have this TextEdit program that is the equivilant of notepad...but oh well. Fall semester Im taking french, explorations in mathematics, oceanography, and creative writing.

"event","Okay, this is gonna be a long one. So here it goes. 
After we got to our condo in OC four hours later I come out of the bedroom and there were COPS in our room, looking at our obviously under 21 possesion of alcohol. Let me repeat: FOUR HOURS. I wasn't even really drinking! I was in the other room! None of the beer was mine! WAAAA!!! So myself and everyone in the room then recieves an Alcohol Citation, but since I'm underage I just have to go to a reality class, and not back to court in OC, thank god. THEN the manager comes in and tells us to pack it up. EVICTED IN FOUR HOURS. Here follows the worse night of my entire life (no joke) while I carry my vast amount of luggage two blocks down in the dark, in the pouring rain, to Brians van, sobbing merrily all the way. Joy. 
Yes, this sounds like it may have ruined my Senior Week completely, but it didn't! Thank GOD. We got another condo across the street ($180 later--GAG) and it didn't rain a drop until the day we got back to Frederick. The powers that be felt sorry for us. The beach was awsome, I have a tan, there were sandbars, I rode the drunk bus and laughed at the idiots, I ate crabs (EW...and they made me kiss an eyeball. GROSS) and amongst all this I am lonley and I miss...someone? Maybe Matt. Confusion thy name is Cecilia. But also amongsting is Noah. Noah is hot and cute and has an amazing I want to lick you all over body ETCETCETC. We flirt. I sit on his lap...we try to discretly grope each other under the table. Haha, discret. Everyone leaves us alooone and YAY happy reboud sex! Then comes more (two times) yum yum yum. Noah doesn't treat it like a fling though...he touches my face and we curl up and watch scary movies and tonight we're going to borders (speaking of which I need to hurry to do my hair) and hes so NICE. And he thinks I'm NICE too. (giggle) Its all nice. Matt finds out. He did stuff with this girl Katie so I didn't feel guilty but apparently its a HUGE deal and we yelled and I cried a lot and we tried to talk and then today he wrote me an email saying that he couldn't talk to me for a while because it hurt to much, so now its like we're REALLY broken up and it hurts a lot and I cried a lot more. Before he left OC we talked and he gave me a really big hug and it was like our last goodbye and it was the last time I saw him and I just REALLY hope with all my heart and body and mind and my orange quilt and my laptop and my stuffed cat Curry that we'll be able to talk again soon because I MISS him because he's been my constant for almost two years and now I'm empty. Sort of. Noah's cute. Its good to have reboud that's cute. :) ALSO Kendra had sex for the first time with a cute skater boy (haha Sk8ter Boy...Avril Lavigne (sp?) you SUCK) and she's really cute and giddy etc. etc. etc. and we talked all about sex and boys and I'm going to miss her so much next year. Today I did college stuff like setting up my email account and signging up for New Student Weekend...where everyone goes camping and it's fun. Yay, but also very much on the depressing side of my depression. Sigh. My story is coming along well, I wrote a part that made me cry. Even though that's not very fucking HARD these days...blah. AND sex with Noah is extremely GOOD. (which is ALWAYS a plus). So yeah, that's the update. I need to get more people to read this so they understand the crazy person thats wearing THREE shirts that is Cecilia. (GAH its hot) my god, I need to change. Must look hot for Borders date. Anything else? I got lots of cool stuff for graduation, yay. Nope. OH! Talked to Jason about icky Jaqueline and our friendship is mostly smoothed over thank god, I'm loosing too much right now, even though I'm gaining a beautiful computer. :) THATS it. I'll have more drama later. 
Love always, Cecilia Almighty. (haha, just saw Bruce Almighty...GET IT??)"

"event","I'm sick and I don't feel good, but I feel the need to share with the world (or the two people that read my journal) what's going on...so, yeah. Tamar (my aunt from India) thinks that I am some American Valley girl, selfish and superficial, all I care about is clothes and blah blah blah...all because of TINY little things that have no basis whatsoever. She has always been cold to me, so what reason have I to be nice to her? And because of this I have a huge FLAW in my character. FLAWFLAWFUCKYOUFLAW. sigh. So I feel even more shitty because I feel SO lonley because Matt isn't with me, and there are so many confusing things going on, and next year I won't have anyone close to me. And I'll be sleeping in a room with someone I won't know who probably won't enjoy me sleeping with my TV on because I hate sleeping by myself. Yes, I know and accept that that is an insecure little thing that I should try to get over but I'm just so SAD. Today sucks. I miss Matt. And I'm sick. And I hate Tamar. So I'll just never talk to her again. She doesn't need to be a part of my life and instead of studying abroad in India I'll go to Italy or France or AMSTERDAM and hire prostitutes and smoke weed a lot. That's what I feel like doing right now. That and having a whole big bunch of sex. Along with the missing Matt thing is the other missing that thing, you know, that thing. Yeah, go sex drive go! HORMONES! WOOHOO! Grragh! I feel like killing something. Maybe I should go running. But I'm SICK and SLEEPY and ACHY goddamnit. I saw Bruce Almighty with Kendra the other day and it was funny and she's nice and I'm glad she's back. I made my wallets also. (so for the two people that read my journal, ask for them tomorrow) except that I have a fucking DOCTORS APPT tomorrow on my second to last day of high school EVER. Dirty bastards. Someone up there REALLY has it in for me. Maybe I deserve it. Maybe I'm a selfish superficial valley girl who only cares about clothes. Sigh. I don't know. Matt's coming over. It's hard to know where the line between us should be, or whether or not there should be a line at all. I have all these little resolves in my head about just hanging out and no cuddling of any kind...and then we talk and all my carefully constructed reserves crumble into icky, guilt ridden dust because all I want to do is curl up in his arms and cry until everything is better. Not even kissing, or anything else. Just him holding me. And it hurts when I think of not doing that because I need SOMEONE to do that, to make me feel better, and there isn't anyone who could do it like he could. Anyone else would seem fake, except for maybe Phil but he's all girlfriendy and I don't want to put him in zat position. thank you. I'm gonna order my computer soon. I think thats about it for tonight.

ps-If you think I'm not a nice person tell me so that I can prove you wrong cause I feel crappy. I love EVERYONE. :) (except for Tamar. and possibly Mrs. Julian aka evil math teacher of death)"

Ahem. 
It's really hard, breaking up, but already our relationship is a million % better, but there's still and for a while will be that lingering sadness that just bites at me. Especially the little things, like when he asked me if he wanted the key to my house back I burst into tears. I haven't cried in a couple days though, except today I cried on the way home. I miss him so much, but he really is still here. It's really cool and sad at the same time. And there was this thing with Kirk where he spent the night and Matt freaked out because we'd just broken up and he doesn't really like Kirk and I had to reassure him and it was really sad. (And no, I didn't DO anything with Kirk. Perverts.) But it's all better now.  
  Buffy was sad too, Angel came back and she and Angel kissed and Spike saw and it was right after they'd had a touching conversation and WAAAAA I feel SO bad for Spike. ONE MORE EPISODE OHMYGOD I can't handle it. 
  On a lighter note, I finished my graduation things and they're pretty. Everyone should come.

"event","matt and I broke up last night. I feel sick and my eyes ache from crying...but it's also a relief. Here's the synopsis:
  I am going away for college, to MN, 20 hours away. Immediatly I know that I don't want to have a long distance relationship and I started thinking about dating other people and possibly breaking up with Matt...but my typical reaction when I think those kind of things is to think to myself that I shouldn't be thinking about breaking up with Matt...its MEAN for the love of God! So I go into denial mode, and I overcompensate by being extra I love you I need you etc. etc. etc. Matt doesn't do this: he's a very honest person when it comes to his feelings. So then I start thinking that something is wrong when really he's feeling the same way I am...etc. etc. etc. So I asked him about it etc. and then the making love thing (see previous entry) and he wasn't being mean he was really just as confused as I was...and last night we just talked and it all came out. Niether of us expected it to happen before summer...at the end of summer maybe if at all, but we both didn't feel so close anymore and...yeah. 
  So then we cried together for three hours straight and he stayed overnight and we curled up...and I think because of that I know it'll be okay. I can tell. I know we can be friends, and I swear I'm not just saying that because last night I could feel it. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt any worse, or that my heart isn't breaking. I still love him so much and he loves me just as much as I love him but it couldn't work anymore, and we both know that. If we'd gone on it would've just been more painful because it'd be lying. So that's that. 
Also, I think you're ""supposed"" to take time off from each other, its the ""right"" thing to do when you break up...but neither of us feels like its the right thing. I need him to be my friend because of how close we are, and I hope and think that he needs me too. I'm gonna see him tonight. Hopefully I won't be crying all day! Arg. Okay. Every time someone hugs me I only cry more. Sigh. Hugs are unavoidable I guess. :)

  Secondly, tech week is this week, and it's fun to play with all the beautiful new sound equipment that we have. And finally I got off work sunday morning by switching with Evan so that I CAN do the play, joys and happinesses. However, as soon as something goes right something else immediatly goes wrong.
 Another recap: I'm SO VERY stressed out lately. I'm changing around my room so it's all in boxes, I don't think I'm getting enough sleep, I'm going away to college, the god-damn bathroom isn't even finished and I can't take a shower in it and it sucks. 
  Plus on top of all that Matt is suspiciously not being comforting boyfriend guy I love you it'll be okay once all this is over etc. etc. etc. I NEED him to be that guy! I mean, come on! The last time he said I love you without me muttering it at his retreating back and him muttering it in return was when? God knows! He just isn't attentive to me, like he doesn't walk next to me when we get out of the car. I don't feel attractive--not that he's especially good at doing that anyway...It's mean, and scarily reminisent of last two weeks of Joey behaivor before he broke up with me. Witness my stress level skyrocket. 
  So I talked to him about it, and he told me that I shouldn't feel that way and we kissed and slept in each other's arms and it seemed all nice and happy. How stupid am I to think that it could just be fixed. 
  The night after that we ""made love""--or so I thought. I thought. He didn't think so. He has this thing where he thinks he does all of the initiating for the beginning of the sex, which is total crap because he ALWAYS waits for me to do something when what I really want is for him to throw me on the bed and ravage me and tell me he loves me and that I'm beautiful while we make love. This never happens. So the night after we kissed for a long time, and it was so sweet and lovely and then we had slow nice making love and it was SO GOOD and then we fell asleep and it was so nice, and we did it in complete blackness. Cool! And again, at the start I was all fooling around with him and his happy parts and was he doing ANYTHING but kissing? NO! I mean, come on, preheat the oven a little baby. Its so stupid. Anyway, last night I said something along the lines of ""last night was nice"" and he goes, yeah, it was a little slow though. Immediatly I'm like, what the FUCK? Basically the whole time he just wanted to get it on and stop fooling arond. Like the kissing was boring. He told me that he was like all guys in that he just wanted the orgasm and then be done with it. He actually told me words VERY CLOSE to that. That is so fucked up and I was so upset. He knew, and he hugged me and kissed me. But was there any ""I'm sorry's"" or ""I love yous""/ No! Not even an I love you as he walks out the door with me about to burst into tears. What the hell is going on here, hmmm? He's being so inconsiderate, and I talked to him and what changed? Nothing! Oh god, I'm going to start crying now, in the middle of first period...well, it's dark and they're watching a movie...fuck. So thus is my life for the past couple days. I saw Mike and Kim today--he was dropping her off for school and they're always so intimate. I'm so fucking jealous. I need to talk to Erin. 
Love, Cecilia"

"event","I just got back from going to borders, and as I was walking through the ails(isles? aisls? how the hell do you spell that?) of literature all I could think about was MY book, ""The Book of Games"" All I could think about was wanting to read it more than any other book I've ever heard of. It was really weird. I started fantasizing about seeing my book on that shelf that you see right as you walk in, the New Fiction shelf. I'd run up and grab it and scream ""It's my book! It's my book!"" at the top of my lungs and then I'd dance around waving it, not caring that the entire store was staring at me. Ah yes, I can see it now. It's almost done, my book that is. I almost have all the peices written downrats about Jonas, those I haven't done yet...but they're coming. I'm feeling inspired. I want people to read it, I want it to be fresh and crisp, printed out on white paper and not in disorganized jumbles of menu's from restaurants, stuffed into my lovely green notebook. I can't wait. I can see all these things in my story that I put there, characters and lives and meaning beyond what you see at first...and I feel like it's not even me writing it, like I just suddenly found it in my head and thought, cool...yeah, that's cool. I should write it down. Sigh. 
  Why is this depressing? I can't stop thinking about it. Buffy's ending, it's like finishing the best book I've ever read, because if there's one thing I like better than writing it's ""reading"" the story of Buffy. (and Spike--giggle) And I'm leaving, REALLY leaving. Soon. I'm in a slump, but not an inactive slump. ""The Book of Games""  keeps growing inside me, it's my BABY. :) This goddamn computer keeps freezing and I can't WAIT to get my new computer. YAY! PLUS I'm getting tanner. It's exciting. There's a new Angel on tonight. That's about it--look for ""The Book of Games"" on the New Fiction shelf!

There's this part of my story that I lost (I can't remember where I wrote it and where the paper is...also can't remember if I've already written about this) and I rewrote it and it's really good. I went tanning today and ever since then I've been WARM. It's so cool. I'm not sunburnt or anything, I'm just warm, when I've been cold everyday for the past HALF YEAR or something Jee-sus. My mom is in NY (probably driving home now actually) at a Flax Barn festival...thousands of frantic women running around, looking in boxes etc. etc. etc. Glad I didn't go! Kind of in the mood for QUIET. I'm in the fashion show for the Velvet Lounge on Saturday, so all of you should come and see it...all of the three people that have me on their lists anyways. Bah, humbug. 
  Libby was depressed at work today, and I don't know her very well, so I don't know how to comfort her...and I felt baaad...all this crap is conjugating (word?)in her life RIGHT NOW. It sucks. Yeah. 
  Today I patched my favorite holy jeans and now they have orange flower patchy things on them and its cool and I'm so proud of myself. It took FOREVER though, stupid ratty sewing machine mutter mutter mutter. Bah. Mutter. 
  Perhaps I start a website, and put my story there...perhaps? I really want feedback while I'm writing, because up until now it's been approximately ME working on it so...yeah. And in it's current condition (a bunch of unorganized--I use the term lightly--papers stuffed in my green notebook with random scenes that fit together in my head but no one elses stuffed in a NOT order...) But I swear it's going really well! (eyes dart from side to side) ahem! 
  I want a job in a clothing store that is suspiciously NOT Walmart or any of its equivalents. That's all for now...tata babes.

"event","First of all, check out Matt's website designed by me again, http://www.geocities.com/fromwithin_unbreakable/ ...I made some awsome changes. I'm so proud! 
Second of all, I saw HOLES today with my sisters. It was okay...the story was awsome (I read the book, you see) but the acting was so-so. 
Third of all tonight I'm going to Hammondpalooza, big party that I've been planning on going to for weeks. Problem: Kendra's home. So I call Matt and ask him if I can bring Kendra and he says NO. Hammon already made too many exceptions, there's already too many ""just one more person"" things. So...Kendra is pissed off, makes snide hurtful remarks etc. etc. etc. as she does when I'm doing something fun and she's not--thus I must be miserable if she is too. That kind of shit pisses me off so much, and she does it all the time! Probably not even purposely! It this were something like just going over to the bunkhouse then of course a) I wouldn't go and I'd hang out with her or b) she'd be able to go. She said something about how she'd just sit in the corner anyway--which she doesn't. She talks to everyone and they all like her, but Hammond doesn't know her, and it's been something that I've been waiting for for fucking WEEKS and I'm GOING, goddamnit. I'm SORRY that she couldn't come, yes. I wish she could, this is true...but gaah! And if I did not go and hang out with her I know I'd be bitter, and that'd be okay, but she would make snide remarks about it ALL night. Or maybe not...I don't know. I just wish she wouldn't make me feel like shit when things go well for me. Can we be supportive much? Okay, I'm going off on unrelated tangents and BAH. Grrr. Arg. (heehee, Buffy) I love Kendra very very much, I just wish she wouldn't do things like that. Grr. Arg. Okay, I'm done. 
And Buffy's a rerun next week. Assholes. Damn you Joss Whedon! 
And I lost a part of my story. 
But I got a shirt from Delias in the mail today and it's cool. Yay. 
Okay. Done now.

"event","I went to Target after school and got THE CUTEST underwear set. EVER. They're blue and green with yellow lace and bows and they're so awsome and I can't wait to show Matt...ah, the joys of clothing. It really is the little things in life that make you happy, like clothes, or bags, or horses, or whatever. I have a luxurious life. I am able to buy the best underwear ever because I have that luxery. Yes, I need to save money, but I have some leeway, and the whole reason that I have a job in the first place is so that leeway exists. I don't feel the need to jeapordize my little things because other people don't have them. I am thankful for them. (I'm actually making educated excuses for spending money when I shouldn't. BUT THEY WERE SO CUTE!!!!)
  I've been feeling kind of depressed lately. A lot of people, not on purpose, have been putting me down. Apparently I say ""like"" a lot, and I'm condescending, and my teeth are oh so yellow (???) and I need to be nicer and a whole bunch of crap and I've been in this really edgy mood maybe because of it or maybe that's what caused the critism...the point is I dont know what I'm doing wrong and it makes me mad. Humph. But I have new underwear. *smile* PLUS there are all these study abroad things for design and journalism like in Italy and Paris and the Virgin Islands and India and London and YAYAYAY! That's about it.

"event","I'm waiting for Kat to pick me up for school, and I thought I'd write down this dream I hate. First we were in some bunkhouse or something, and I was with these guys who were really drunk, and their cars got stuck in the trees. In order to get to my house after school I would have to crawl over these logs and hang onto them, but it was like something I've done hundreds of times before. ANYway, there was this one guy who hated the word egg. Because these egg-shaped flying saucers came and abducted him. Then I could see the aliens, the nice ones and the mean ones. They make you wash their dishes, and then when you leave they realize that they can wash their own dishes. Weird. When I got back it was a girl who had been abducted, maybe me? and I was talking to her and asking her if she'd tell me about it sometime because she was still kind of in shock. Then my alarm woke me up. 
I swear, I have the weirdest dreams. I'm probably a psychiatrists dream come true!

"event","So I've been trying to write in my journal for the past three days and every time I try it doesn't work out for some odd and annoying reason. Guess what happened this weekend: I lost my wallet! Noooo kidding! Picture  me freaking out, wondering if someone had stolen it and get all my precious little money...grrr. So YESTERDAY after I froze my account and cancelled my card I called Matt, the dear, sweet thing. We talked about places to look, and as we were talking he happened to look under the bed. Ah ha! My wallet was under the bed. Who doesn't look under the bed FOR THE LOVE OF GOD?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Gah! But now I  have it back and everything is happy. People are doing debates in first period now, and I'm afraid to type loudly, so I'm trying to type softly when they're talking. Emily Nic has a loud speaking voice. I wish I had tried out to speak at graduation. OH WELL. Hmmm...what else has happened? The paper came out, it was beeeeautiful. Now we're working on the senior issue, oh so much fun. 
  I signed up for housing at U of MN and I hope I get into the first dorm I signed up for...it would really suck if I didn't. I told Lucas he should come to MN with me next semester 'cause of all the theatre stuff there--he'd LOVE it. Plus it'd be fun to have him there. And I can't stop thinking about senior week! I cannot wait, and I've been jogging every day for like three weeks and I HOPE I'm loosing weight but I don't really want to look at the scale in case I'm not...today I'm not wearing a bra. Blessed freedom! Well...sort of. It's a kind of not padded pretty bra thing going on...:)I keep writing little snippits about Olive...I think she's actually one of the most important parts of the book! Every time that a speech ends and everyone claps and talks I can type fast, then I have to slow down my typing when the speeches start again. :)Ramya is so annoying. 
  Weeeell thats about it. Happy birthday to Kendra--love you dahling.

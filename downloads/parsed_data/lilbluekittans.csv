<b>Grace</b>: Sophie, you're an idiot. She took your claws away.

<b>Grace</b>: Look, maybe it's okay for you beauty queens to get your claws clipped, but in case you hadn't noticed, <i>I'm the mighty huntress.</i>
<b>Sophia</b>: You hunt dustballs, Grace.
<b>Grace</b>: I'll have you know that there have been quite a few reported instances of dustball violence against small cute blue kittens in our neighborhood lately.
<b>Sophia</b>: ...Really?
<b>Grace</b>: Yes, really.
<b>Sophia</b>: Ohmygod.
<b>Grace</b>: And you sold out for scritches and crooning.
<b>Sophia</b>: But she said I was the prettyest....
<b>Grace</b>: Sophie, she also said you were a stupid kitten who was easily distracted.
<b>Sophia</b>: But she was warm and snuggled me and gave me scritches! ...and I'll point out that you fell for the same trick.
<b>Grace</b>: True, that.

<b>Grace</b> (<i>rolling eyes</i>) Sure, sure. As long as you get scritches and kittan food, you're happy.

<b>Grace</b>: Sophie, you are absurd.
<b>Sophie</b>: But this is a shiny toy! And it's an automated kitten amuser! Plus it vibrates and is warm all the time.
<b>Grace</b>: Speaking of things that are warm and amuse kittens, where on earth is our people?
<b>Sophie</b>: He said something about a war and having to be at work a lot and that we should eat a lot of kitten food and curl up and sleep a lot!

<b>Sophia</b>: That's not so bad.
<b>Grace</b>: SOPHIE! Yes it is! He doesn't love me any more and now we're <i>GOING TO THE DOCTOR!</i>
<b>Sophia</b>: Grace, relax. We are going to the doctor so the doctor can see how healthy we are. We need to be healthy to fly.
<b>Grace</b>: Oh.

Now we have a people, <lj user=""clairaide"">, and she is warm and snuggly and appropriate for us to sleep on and butt heads with. But she is not the kittan daddy, who is away again....

Why does he keep going away? Maybe he does not like us any more.

<b>Grace</b>: No, silly. He likes us lots. Look, a kitten mitten!
<b>Sophia</b>: Then why is he gone so much?
<b>Grace</b>: I don't know...probably to get the crinkly green stuff that smells funny. He says that he needs that to get us food.
<b>Sophia</b>: Oh. I need food, don't I?
<b>Grace</b>: <i>sigh</i> Yes, Sophia, you need food to stay the prettyest.

He says he's supposed to come back soon, though. So that will be good. Then we get to attack his toes! They are particularly wriggly.

<b>Grace</b>: I wonder if his toes have spicy brains....
<b>Sophia</b>: Wait! Doesn't he have a person who hasn't met us? What if she doesn't like us?
<b>Grace</b>: Then we'll have to attack her toes and eat her spicy brains.

"event","This weekend we killed a mouse.

It was there, and we were hungry, and it looked at us funny!

<blockquote>
     <b>Grace</b>: It had spicy-smelling brains....
</blockquote>

But we think this might have made one of our people upset. She looked pretty mad. We guess that the mouse was probably attached to the box of kitten amusement, and was pretty intimately involved in making it go. We probably broke it. But there was another mouse so it was okay.

In other news we are hungry. We need more scritches too! We like people and people seem to leave us be a lot lately. How are we supposed to get our sleep when we can't curl up on peoples? They only exist to give us warmth anyways.

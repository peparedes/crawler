I'm starting to get used to this full time job thing.  I like my desk.  I like the stuff that I can afford to do with this job.

I've realized something over the past year of my life, well a few things actually.  I know I've made a similar post, but. . . for once I really feel like my life is turning toward a different direction.

This will be my last personal post as Hime_Sakurachan.  My reasons don't have to be known to anyone else.  I've moved on to a different name now where I'm posting my personal issues and there is no longer a need to constantly maintain this one on the back-burner.

As for work. . . I've been working with SSA for an entire year now.  the direction that it has brought to my life has been nothing short of incredible.  I can afford the things that I want to do without taking loans and without fear of debt.

As for school. . . I have my plans.  I'm finally feeling comfortable with my life and I'll be set to start back in on what I initially started - just with a different goal.

As for relationships. . . I couldn't be happier.  I've never been more proud to say that someone is my boyfriend.  I'm not afraid to take him home to my parents.  My family loves him.  He understands how I operate and I understand him too.  We can talk to each other about everything.  I know that my future is with him and we're starting to plan for that.  He made me really proud of him over the past week and I'm looking forward to being with him for the rest of my life.  Just waiting on him now.  ^_^

As for friendships. . . I finally deleted numbers that needed to go.  I'm through holding onto the past.  It's gone, done, over with, and there's no point in hanging onto bitter emotions or even the happier ones.  What's done is done and there's nothing that's going to change about it.  Goodbye to those of you lost in transition.  Your friendship was nice while it was there, though some were fake and others were practically forced, but there's no longer a purpose for me to hang onto false hopes and regret.

As for money. . . doing better than I thought I would be now that I'm a year into my career.  Saving for a computer still after I finish sorting out some financial stuff.  Finally making the switch to Vystar instead of Compass.  It had to be done.  They messed up again.

As for family. . . I love them.  Years ago I would have moved to get away from them.  Now, as they approach retirement, I find myself never wanting to move farther than Jacksonville or maybe St. Augustine.

As for my future. . . the outlook is overcast with scattered showers, 70-80 degrees and full of laughter and love.  (for those of you who don't know. . . overcast days are to me like sunny days are to normal people. . . in other words, overcast with scattered showers is absolute heaven.)

As for my art. . . Let's just say that it's no longer in planning mode.

Hello Janicon, HHN, and Universal Studios!

Ja ne!

"event","Spent the weekend working on my costume - still haven't gotten to Jasper's, unfortunately, watching anime with Jasper, getting a well-needed massage (can't wait to go back Saturday), and practicing piano.  Did a little bit of drawing.  Jasper made me taco salad.

On Friday I cooked some really awesome food that involved bacon, chicken, pinnaple, cinnamon, honey, and brown sugar.  Oh yeah!  Raisins too.  Oh My GOD was it good!  ^_^

Got really frustrated sewing my costume - messed up on the sleeves again.  (I swear I'm just gonna by some cheap cloth and practic sewing sleeves.  I never get it right.)  So, out of frustration and anger, I threw my glasses at the wall.  Normally, they just take the beating. . . this time they broke.

Took me and Jasper hours to find the lense.  Of course I went all mello-dramatic again.  (I'm so sick of doing that.) Eventually found them and watched anime to cheer up.

Spent Sunday out at Taye and Johns after watching Hand Maid May with Jasper (my like 16th time through the series) and damn was it hot out side.

Me, Taye, John, and Jasper took all afternoon and into the early evening to build a shed in Taye's mom's backyard.  So hot.  I have a small sunburn on the back of my neck and near my elbows.  It was nice jumping into the pool to cool off.  John really did most of the work.  Taye and I eventually couldn't help once they had to put the roof on.  For once, being short paid off.  ^_^

They offered to treat us to dinner, but we picked up our own tab at Bennigans.  Chandler (their son) is growing so much since I met him roughly a year ago.  Wow.  It's been a year.

One year in this job.  One year as friends with Taye and John.  Almost a year with Jasper.

It was over a year ago that I moved into my new place and it's a shame that I'm not cleaner.  I think I'm going to make that a big goal.  

I think if I clean 1/2 an hour every day, eventually the whole place will be clean and I can just cycle from room to room.  So, from now on, every day when I get home, I have to immediately clean for 1/2 an hour.  NO EXCEPTIONS.

Someone please hold me to that.  *sigh*

I think I'll start with the kitchen.  When that's done, then the living room, then bathroom, and then bedroom.  Closet has to be worked on everyday period.  Hmmm. . . maybe I shouldn't be writing this for everyone to read. . . 


Anywho, back to Sunday. . . There's been something that I've been wanting to address for a while now. . . John is puting in for a position that may be moving him and Taye and Chandler to Virginia.  He's applying for a very important job within the government and I really hope that he gets it because it would mean a better life for all of them and he would have the job of his dreams.  They would be so happy with that kind of life and I want them to be that happy.  John is also the perfect guy for the job in my opinion.  The job requires a lot of physical strength as well as the ability to talk to people well.  It deals with fraud and protecting tax payer dollars.  I really hope he gets it.  I hope their life together becomes everything that they want it to be and more.  What I can't say to them is:  I'm going to miss you when you leave.  Taye's my only female friend in the area.  The last time I was this close to another girl was high school.  Even then it took several years to get used to them and warm up to the idea of trusting other girls.

Bottom line:  I'll support them in whatever they decide to do but damn will I miss them.

Yesterday, even though I was outside in the heat, on the verge of having multiple asthma attacks, I couldn't have been happier.  Being there with two of my best friends and a boyfriend I love with all my heart made me happier than I ever thought I could possibly be around other people.

Am I dreaming?  Someone pinch me.  No, wait!  Don't!  That would hurt. . ."

"event","So I had a great week last week and I'm really glad to be back in the swing of things at work.  It's nice being able to make it in every day.

Sucks that I'm sick again.  This time it's allergies or something like that.  I interviewed a few people who were really sick last week with bronchitus and I'm blaming it all on them.  GRRRR.

Anywho. . . other than sniffling and feeling rundown . . . I had a great time this weekend.  I got to hang out with one of my best friends for several hours and I couldn't have been happier. Taye and I went out to dinner and a movie on Saturday.

We ate at TGI Fridays (made pigs outta ourselves) and Taye can prolly officially declare that she's an alcoholic.  We had this straight-edge waiter (and I don't think there's anything wrong with straight-edge - lemme just put that out there right now.  It's very admirable and noble and good.  I think it's great.) . . .  anywho.  This guy just kept flirting with us.  Taye also complained that her drinks tasted like lemonaid (she ordered a Top Shelf Long Island) and, I'd have to agree that, while I know they were Long Islands, they were mixed a little light.  The manager had to fix it twice.  We weren't trying to make trouble but they kept teasing us like we were.  I ordered milk - they ran out and then went to CVS to get more.  LOL.

We saw 1408 - the new Stephen King flick.  If anyone likes suspenseful horror movies, this is a must.  I loved it!  And, it wasn't predicatable.  Really great.  I think Taye kept her eyes shut the whole time.

We invited Jasper out so that we could all go to a club.  Would have invited her husband John but he was home with their child Chandler.

Went to Metro.  Taye was a little disturbed by the Drag Show.  ^_^

Had a lot of fun that night.  Drank until I don't remember the rest of it.  Apparently we went to Denny's afterwards and I was pouring sugar on my boyfriend's arm and saying that it was sand. . .

uh-huh.

So. . .  I'm sick now.  Somehow.

Parents came home from their Greece trip yesterday.  Can't wait to see them again.  I really missed them while they were gone.  Kept listening to my mom's voicemail over and over.  God I'm pathetic.

I've been working on my costume for AFO.  It's turning out gerat. . . now that I've fixed one of the sleeves.  No, I didn't sew it together this time.  Heh. . . I just sewed it inside out.  ^_^;

Ok -  back to work.

Oh, and if Taye's reading, thanks for the advice.  Thanks to you, my questions have been answered and I'm now no longer unsure.  I appreciate it.  ^_^"

"event","Not going into detail, but I've had another weird dream and I can't figure out what it's referring to.  Kinda sucks.

Good news:  Purchased most (as in the bulk) of the materials for mine and Jasper's AFO costumes.  I still need to make the staff. . .

Umm . . . basically I got all the materials at 50% off.  YAY!!!!!!  Would have cost me well over $200 to make it otherwise.  I'm at $180 right now.  Prolly will be over $200 but could have been over $500 had I bought the materials at cost.

Started sewing my costume last night and Jasper's coming over for me to size his up tonight.  YAY!!!

I should be done with mine this afternoon.  It's really easy now that I've already sewn a shirt and a pleated skirt.  This cosume is nothing compared to Kaname's.  I still think I'm going to remake hers at a later date with a material that will hold the pleates better.  I think the material I got is too stretchy.

More good news.  The material I've got for the new costumes are perfect!  Also I've been reading up on sewing instructions and I've learned how to alter patterns and adjust garmets to fit properly so that I don't have to worry about parts of the costume that wouldn't fit correctly if I followed it exactly.  I feel really relieved and less stressed after learning some of these tricks of the trade.

If anyone's into sewing, I'd really recommend Simplicity's Sewing Basics book- they sell it at JoAnnes.  It's really worth it and has helped me a great deal.

I think, just to get Jasper in character, we're going to need to rewatch CCS.  Then again, we're getting into Escaflowne right now and I couldn't be more addicted to it than I was the first five times!  ^_^

Escaflowne is just one of those animes that just sticks with you for months - even years - after you've watched it and it just begs to be rewatched repeatedly.  The characters are brilliantly animated and designed and the color scheme is incredibly. . . I don't wanna say realistic. . . but the artist really knows when to use certain kinds of colors and when to avoid them.  A lot of animes recently have looked. . airy(?) and spacious with lots of light coming from the light source. . . I really like that style and all (if you don't know what I'm talking about, compare Full Metal Panic Fumoffu to something like CCS or Escaflowne and you'll see the difference.) but I'm really enjoying the older animation.  As weird as that sounds.

Still looking forward to the release of Slayers!  I'll have to throw a release date party.  ^_^

Hopefully, we'll see the re-release of CCS in surround sound and hi-def.  ^_^"

"event","Had a really weird dream last night.

I've already told a few people the abridged version.  But here's the whole thing.

I dreamt that I was in a Band Room that I haven't been in since Middle School.  I can't even remember which Band Room it would have been.  However, I do know that it was for All-District Band.  I was second to last chair French Horn (didn't have my Holton back then - that's how I know it's early middle school) and I was really interested in the new kind of strings that everyone other than me had for their horns - they were made of Nano.  ^_^

Anywho. . . I mentioned that I hadn't played in years and that I couldn't wait to get back to performing and I couldn't believe that I still had it in me just to get this far.

I remember thinking that the people around me looked strange and that's when I realized everyone in the band were people that I knew around me now.  They all looked the same age that they are in the present but this was obviously a place from my past.

I was then called up to direct the band.  That's another thing that's strange.  I didn't actually conduct that particular song until my Senior year of highschool.  I was conducting because the band director was running late and she needed me to fill in.

When I was directing, I could have sworn that my old friends from high school were there, but they weren't.  The band director arrived and she wasn't anyone inparticular that I recognized.  I went back to my seat.  My boyfriend was first chair French Horn, but he was Jasper.  Jasper was never in band.

Then I noticed a familiar face behind me.  Tayler (my friend from high school whom I never talk to or see - he lives in CT) was sitting behind me, playing Tuba.  He did play Tuba in band when we were in school.

He looked really sad and frustrated.  Flat out miserable.  He was the only person who looked sad.  Even some of my regularly-frustrated co-workers looked happy.  He looked at me a smiled and then just went back to frowning.

Then I woke up.

I wasn't going to really think anything of it, even though my dreams sometimes tend to be creepily on-target, but I think he took the quiz I posted and he actually got a 100%.  LOL  So I thought I'd post this and see if anyone had any thoughts on it.

Strange, huh?  I haven't heard from him in so long and I'm not really allowed to talk to him (his gf doesn't like him talking to me) so we never talk or email.

Sent him an email to see how he's doing but he usually doesn't respond.

Let me know."

"event","So I haven't posted a post in forever and I have a 15 minute break, so . . . here's what I can cover in 15 minutes...

I still have to post the pics from the convention.  I liked Megacon much better than Ja-con.  Personally, I don't think I'll be going back to Ja-con next year.  I'd rather just take a trip to Tampa for Otakon.  Still looking forward to the Ja-con trip and I've started picking out the fabrics for my costume (I'm going as Sakura from CCS.  I'll be using the 3rd opening costume.)  They don't really sell patterns for such outfits - or at least not any that I could really find so I'm going to be altering the pattern for this halloween costume I found.  Shouldn't be too tough - all I have to do is add more ruffles and the sleeves.

Jasper's costume is going to be the toughest.  He's going as Syaoran from CCS - and he's going to be wearing the green uniform.  *sigh*  Going to be difficult, so I've gotta hurry it up with mine. . .

Looks like I'm going to Universal in July again!  YAY!!!!!  Mom and I are taking a trip down there for the 30th.  Can't wait.

In case you didn't know, I was in the hospital a week or so ago because I kept passing out and shaking.  Not fun.  Basically, they hooked me up to an EEG for a few days and didn't find anything.  One of the tests was in the dark with a strobe light.  I asked them if we could get some techno music and some glow sticks. . .  ^_^

Had an MRI done and CT Scan - nothing showed up.  But I do have a brain, so that's a nice finding.

They released me on a Friday afternoon and I went back to work on Tuesday, had a few problems that following week but I've been doing much better now.  For some reason my shoulder is back to hurting (it hasn't hurt like this in months).  But that could be because I've been working out more lately (as in like every day) and I didn't really do any arm exercises yesterday.  I'll have to take it easier today.  I've already lost 5 lbs - but I gained 10 while in the hospital so that could just be me losing that hospital weight by being more active.

It's so nice to be out of bed.

I'm glad it rained yesterday and I'm looking forward to more of it!  I just hope it rains when I'm at home next time so that I can get back to writing.  I always write better when it rains. . . I guess it's just that kind of mood.

A little frustrated about people spraying things at work that I'm allergic to.  Keeps giving me asthma attacks.  I'm glad they're not at their desks today.

So I'll be working out again with Jasper this afternoon and then I'm making Teriyaki Chicken (and what he doesn't know is that I'm going to stop at Publix and snatch up some salmon for him ^_^).

Jasper and I have been doing well.  I feel a lot better when he's around because he always knows how to cheer me up - well, almost always.  But one thing I do know is that it's hard for me to stay mad and frustrated when he's around.  It just seems like I get aggrevated and then after like 10 minutes it's over.

Actually, I think we'll just work out for a short time today and then I'm going to add in some Okonomiyaki.  Just sounds soooooo yummy and I have most of the ingredients."

"event","Passed out a few days ago.  It lasted a pretty long time.  Parents and Jasper ended up having to come out and help me.  It was so cold.

Went to the doctor about it and, well, there's no good news.  I'm going for some bloodwork today and CTScan/MRI on June 1st.

They think it's something bad.   If you wanna know, call me.  It's not something I'd like to just post.  Typing it seems a little permanent and they don't know if any of it's right until the tests come back.

This fasting thing is killing me today.  It may lead me to strangling my only friend at work: Taye.  She's sitting over there, licking the chocolate off of her fingers as the other hand paws through more chocolate-covered popcorn.  Heaps and piles of chocolate covered popcorn.  Not to mention, we're having a cookout tomorrow so everyone's talking about what food they're bringing.  On top of that, we have German Chocolate Cake (my favorite) - a double layered cake at that - sitting only two desks away from me.  Someone should suffer for this.

JaCon was alright. We probably won't go back there next year though.  I have pictures. . . but I'd rather retake some of me and Jasper cosplaying because I don't think that's a good enough pic of me to put on the site.  Sorry!  But I did get a lot of gerat pics of other cosplayers.  Good anime haul too.  ^_^

Well, I'm seriously lacking energy right now so I'm gonna just stop typing.  Try to conserve.

But I am SO stealing the rest of that cake and eating it later.

Ok - and the smiling cat with food everywhere for the little ""Mood Icon"" lies - I'm NOT smiling."

"event","Looks like Jasper is doing well on his exams thus far.  I've been trying to help him as best as I can, but I've realized that I know nothing - and I mean nothing - about what he's studying so I can't exactly quiz him or anything.  However, I have been helping him with food and I've been waking him up to study and making sure he doesn't sleep and just lots of other stuff to try and keep him going.  I hope that I'm actually helping and not hindering him.  Because, if I were hindering him, I don't think he would tell me because I'm trying so hard to help him in the only ways that I know how.

I hope he does as well or better than he thinks that he did.

Spent last Wednesday - Sunday pretty sick.  Was still glad that Taye and John came over for dinner.  Chandler really is a handful and a half for them, but they look so happy together.  I'm glad.  It's been a few weeks since they got married and they haven't killed each other yet so I guess that's a good sign.

Can't wait to go to the convention on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  YATTA!!!!

I have Thursday off and will have to call and make sure that I have enough leave to take Monday off as well.

Of course I'm looking forward to riding some coasters among other things.  And I think this trip will be a wonderful vacation for Jasper since he won't have to worry about exams or studying when he gets back.  

Well, I have to say that I'm glad Hula boy is out of American Idol.  It's about time.  I'd still like Jordan to win or Blake, but I think, last night, Jordan's song choice was really poor.  I only caught the clip of it, but it sounded really rough and out of tune.  I also didn't care for what she wore.  I'm worried about her this week.  And Blake. . .  wow!

"event","I need to learn how to write in Japanese.  Writing to CLAMP and telling them how much I love them (and worship them) is starting to become a priority.

For anyone who doesn't know about me and CLAMP, well.... where the hell have you been???

Here's a bit of a history....

When I was younger I was really depressed and I had attempted to kill myself a few times.  I had trouble fitting in (well, I still have that problem) and I usually had more of a problem with how to react to people who are negative or people who upset me.  I also used to be a tomboy.

All that changed after CCS.  Granted, I still sunk into a nice depression periodically, but it was NOTHING like it used to be.  Whenever I feel down, I just pop in an episode of CCS and suddenly life is better.  Everything seems so clear and easy when I take a step back from everything and try to react how I know that Sakura would act.  I know that sounds strange but it really works.  It helps me stay professional at work and the series has allowed me to embrace my feminine side and respond better to others when they aren't being too nice to me.

Sometimes it doesn't work.  However, CLAMP really has changed me.  I'm a happier person with CLAMP in my life and I really appreciate how they've helped me feel more confident.

I love the way I feel when I watch CCS or when I think about the series or most any other CLAMP series.  The least I can do is write to them in their own language and thank them for influencing me to be a better person and to always strive to do my best.

CCS also spwaned my otaku-ness.  ^_^  And that says it all.  ^_^;;;"

D&D was good on Sunday.  I like my character and the group is interesting.  First time I've ever played DND and I'm happy to say that I didn't die.  ^_^  Considering that Epeon is the DM, I'd say that's worth 1,000 bonus EXP right there!

Still a little irritated over being stood up again this weekend.  Guess I'll just have to deal with it since there's not much I can do about it.  I'm not going to get mad at him for being with his family because that just wouldn't be right.  Doesn't mean that I can't be aggravated because he didn't call me to let me know that he wasn't going to be there to pick me up like he said he would be or that he couldn't make it to Wasabi with me or that he wouldn't be playing D&D with us or that he wasn't going to be there period until 10:00 or so.  That would have been nice.

Britt's wedding was nice.  First time I've been out to the beach on a spring-ish type day in a long time.  Still not wild about the whole concept of swimming where fish crap though.

The reception was fun until someone started talking negatively about one of the few friends I actually have.  At which point Jasper and I headed out of there.  Britt looked nice in her gown.  Very pretty.

Eclipse was alright.  Kinda dead.  No, that's not a joke.  Bourbon actually started talking to me again and I'm really glad.  I thought he was still mad at me or something - apparantly not.

Still watching CCS.  Just got past the ""Cream Soda"" episode.  ^_^;  Can't wait for the 2nd movie.  I decided that, after I finish my kimono, I'm going to start in on Sakura's dress from movie 2 - you know the one, the long pretty pink and white one she wore for the play.  ^_^  *bliss*

Taylor made me promise to send him pics of me in the costume.  I only agreed so long as he didn't do anything dirty with them. . ."

Been rewatching CCS with Jasper. ^_^

Refused overtime at work so that I could go to Brittany's wedding this Saturday (co-worker).

Taye's wedding is next week.  She hasn't been at work so I've been covering her portion of the work load that I know how to do.  Can't wait for her to come back.  I'm worried about her.

Looking forward to JaCon (first weekend in May).

Glad that I don't have to go to Shrimp Fest.

Finally finished my Kaname costume (from FMP).  I ended up making the short-sleeved spring/summer uniform because it was easier.  I'm really glad I'll be wearing the big red bow so that it will cover up a messed-up collar.  Purchased the blue wig on line.  Hopefully it's long enough.

Purchased the material for a Kimono.  Started making it yesterday and realized that I didn't purchase the lining (after staring at the pattern for like 10-25 minutes ^_^;)

Looking forward to Lumpia rolling this weekend and also to hanging out with friends.  It will be nice.

Can't think of TOO much else to write about.  I've just been really busy and I'm also excited that today is Friday the 13th.  I'm sporting the black today and people always look upon me strangely.  heh heh.  I find it funny.  ^_^

Happy Friday the 13th!!!!

*sniff*

And on American Idol... Hula Hoop Wanna Be Rocker Guy needs to go!  Period.

Here's who I think will win:

Jordan Sparks or Melinda Doolittle

Lakeesha, not so good last night.  I'm with Simon on the dress and the way she looked last night.  There are more flattering things that she could wear.  I didn't care for the song either.  No, not just because it's Bond, James Bond but because I didn't think she sang it well and, quite honestly, I was a little creeped out by the way she sang it.  It's kinda a sexy and song and, well, nothing against her but... she's not my type (?).

Blake - awesome.  I don't really care for the original but I'd buy his version in a heartbeat.  LOL.  I wish that he could win it, but I know he won't.  He's fun to watch, I love his voice, and he's got the image.  On top of that: he's different and fresh.  I think he'll get a record deal regardless.

Haley - I thought it was cliche and it looked like she was advertising a Venus Shaving commercial instead of trying to win a vocal competition.  Although, I think she'll stick around a little longer just because of the group she appeals to.  And it wasn't her WORST performance.  Actually, it was her best.  But it's not good enough to compete with the other's.  It just isn't.

Stephanie - This was her worst performace I've caught.  (I've missed a few.) I love her voice, but she really lacked the attitude and spunk that made me like her earlier in the show.  I had picked her and Sabrina to win it, but, with this song, it looks like she's going to be in the lower voting margin this time around.  I hope she pulls through next week if she's still here.  And the only reason I'm saying that she might not be around next week is because of demographics.  There are several African American ladies on the show this year (normally there aren't) and demographically, the votes are going to be split when you think about who would vote for them simply by appeal and being able to relate.

You have to look at American Idol this way.  Most of the people voting are teeny-bopper 11-17 year-old middle class white girls.  Seriously.  That's the demographic.  That's who the show appeals to the most.  There are probably less African American ladies calling in a voting every night than there are White ladies calling in every night.

Just something to think about when you get frustrated over how America's voting.

The best singer by far is Doolittle.  Hands down.  But I still don't think she'll win it.  I'd like her to, but I don't think that she will.  Demographics are against her.  Looks (not that she looks bad, but there are hotter chicks and guys on that show) are against her too.  There are more factors, unfortunately, that go into voting (subconsciously too) than just ""who has the best voice"".  If we were going by best voice, here's what it would be:

Doolittle
Evans
Lakeesha
Sparks
Blake
(Can't remember his name) - Guy with the curly hair
(Can't remember his name) - guy from Jacksonville, FL 
Chris (The one who looks like JT from NCYNC)
Haley
Hula Boy - and he can just go home.


But if you do this thing by appeal, here's more how it's lookin:

Sparks
Evans
Doolittle
Chris
Curly Hair
Lakeesha
Blake
JAx
Haley"

"event","Life is good... other than this bizarre weather we've been having over the past week.  I still blame it on my birthday (February 26th).  Seems like, every time that day rolls around something happens.

School flooding, flash flooding, tornado watches/warnings, usually freezing, always rains.

This year was no exception for the most part, although, I must admit that the actual day of my birthday was better than it normally is.  When I awoke on that wonderful day, I thought the world was playing a trick on me and I had actually woken up on the 25th because the sun was shining again.  Surely this isn't my birthday.  lol.  But it was.  ^_^  YAY!  The sun was shining, blue skies smiling, and birds chirping.  I could have done without the buzzing bees, but... 

Well, it did end up raining - figures - but that's alright because it wasn't too bad.  Jasper says that it's God's way of saying ""I remembered your birthday, see?  I didn't forget!""  And my mom always says, ""well, it was raining when you were born...""  (she gave up on the whole ""it was storming and, then, when you were born, the clouds parted and the sun came out just because of you."")  Apparently we were having a snowstorm when I was born.  heh.  good to know.  -_-;

So, because Monday wasn't accompianed by massive thunderstorms and flash flooding and other catastrophes, the rest of the week had to suffer.  That's why we're having crap weather, according to me.

Sorry guys, I made it rain again.  -_-;

I think I'll go home and draw for a while after work gets out.

Been addicted to American Idol again (as always).  I'm a bit upset about last night's results.  Personally, I thought A.J. did a lot better than that dark-skinned-kid with the wavey hair and bulging eyes.  I don't care much for that one.  Heck, I don't even remember his name.  That just shows you how memorable his music is.  So, America - vote, please and keep the good people in.

Here's who I think will be our top 2:  
- Sabrina Sloan:  light-dark-skinned girl with the curly hair (looks permed)
- Stephanie Edwards: dark-skinned girl with the short hair who reminds me a lot of Beyonce.

I know, I know, Lakeesha (sp?) is a great singer, but I'm not so sure that she'll get the votes that it takes to win it.  Same with the Doolittle girl (she was the backup singer for all those years and is really shy).  I think both of them should REALLY just give everyone a run for their money, but when it comes to the voting, I think the other two girls appeal more to the audience watching.  Doesn't mean that they're the best singers, but... well... it IS a popularity contest in most respects.  

The guys really don't have that much of a chance and it's really a shame.  I like the guy from Jacksonville and I'm not just saying that because I live there either.  I think his name is Chris (correct me if I'm wrong) and he's the guy who missed his own daughter's birth to audition.  I just love that rock side of him and his voice is kinda soft and rough at the same time.  Really great.  I also like the guy who has that great sense of humor (reminds me a bit of Tenacious D) and then Blake too (the Beatboxer).  Personally, I think Blake and Sundance have the best voices, but Sundance has to pick songs carefully.  I think Blake can adapt to just about any style with his voice.

Lots of female talent though...

"event","Well, I went to my first con last weekend and I couldn't have been happier.  Jasper and I split the cost of hotels and getting there (actually, I think he covered all the gas - thanks Jasper!!!).  Spent one night on the park (Universal of course) and another night off.  I think I got some pretty good deals on anime stuff although I still didn't find any FMP stuff like I thought I would.  On a positive note, I ended up with several Sakura figures from both Tsubasa and CCS, a Rinoa figure (actually from Universal), and a Tomoyo figure from CCS.  I think I was most pleased with the CCS Sakura because she's wearing her outfit from the season 1 opening.

Even rarer, I found an art card for Code Geiss, CLAMP's little project with several other artists.  I was really surprised to find it because I thought the series wasn't even released in Japan yet.  I know it's not out over here.  Maybe I should check TRSI for info on that.  Also, Melody of Oblivion art card and Comic Party Poster.

"event","So here it is.  A new year.  Yay.  To me, new years don't really mean as much any more.  My mom felt bad that I was so lonely and ended up staying the night at my place.  We were supposed to watch movies all night, celebrate with a Mike's Hard Lemonade, and then go to bed.  We watched one movie, fell asleep during the second, and I only woke up when Jasper called to wish me a Happy New Year.  ^_^

He's finally home now.  (Hence why there hasn't been much pissy posting)  I ended up getting sick at work and he came over - and stayed - for lunch.  We ended up watching 3x3 Eyes and Arrested Development.  Surprised me with Chinese, that brat.  Even gave me a backrub.  ^_^  I'm not complaining.

We spent a good portion of Saturday together just cuddling before heading out to the Olive Garden for lunch.  Yeah, I know.  Funny how we were both craving Olive Garden instead of Wasabi.  Ended up getting Sushi Sunday.  Speaking of Sunday and Arrested Development.... Sometimes I feel like my life should have a narrator.  My parents recently bought a new card for dad (his car has been gradually falling apart over the past 5 years) and they originally said that they just wanted to see me.  Heh.  Turns out that they just wanted to take a drive in the new car, have lunch, and go home.  I was just a side thought.  Hurts.

Jasper ended up coming over after they left (I was still covered head-to-toe in oil pastels from my Cherry Blossom artwork I've been working on since Sunday) and I begged him to take me out. I just had to get out.  Over the past few weeks of complete boredom, I couldn't wait to spend time with him outside of my little rectangle.  Went Go-Kart-ing.  I won, regardless of what he says.  Went to the beach and the Towncenter.  I still can't find any Anime worthy of the gift card he gave me.

We spent a little bit of time at the mall on Saturday looking at rings.  I've always said that I'd want a small wedding/engagement ring and everything that I've seen that I like and could see myself wearing has been, max, $499.  However, if they had this one ring with a smaller diamond in it, I'd love to have it on my finger.  Unfortunately, that ring  - the one with the 1/5 diamond is roughly $2,999 after tax.  That's a nice trip to Tokyo right there or spending money for Tokyo.  Is it really worth it?  We're not looking to get married or anything, but I like taking guys to look at rings because it scares them and it's a little nostalgic from when dad used to take me shopping.  I'm glad I didn't scare Jasper.  I love him."

I now have cable, a new bike, tickets to the Billy Joel concert on February 7th, some serving ware for cooking, tons of Cherry Blossom scented stuff, DDR Extreme, an air purifier, and a $50 gift card to Movie Stop.  Not to mention, a new suite, two nice business tops and a dressy pair of black pants and a new suit jacket.  A new necklace - mom only got it for me so she could keep the earrings (lol)-  and tons of other goodies.

Most of all for Christmas, I was glad that I got to spend time with my family and Anthony.  Anthony and I spent the most part of Christmas Eve together (he went to Eclipse with me and had a great time).  I think his parents are starting to mind me being around for Christmas Eve a lot less than they used to mind me snatching Anthony away for a few hours on holidays.  I'm now ""family"".  ^_^

What really sucks is that I was supposed to get paid today and everyone else got paid... guess who didn't?  yeah.

Sometimes life has a great way of turning to shit within a few hours.  I'm very frustrated.  You see, the money has been sent to the account, but MY bank doesn't post it until the ""official"" payday.  The ""official"" payday for this check is Tuesday.  Sucks.  I'm very frustrated about this.  So, I've narrowed it down to two banks to switch to once I get paid: Vystar or The Federal Credit Union.  Both have a credit/debit card that actually helps build credit instead of just having the convenience of immediate withdrawal.  The JFCU actually has a $500 bounce checked catcher thing.  So, if I had a bill to pay, they would cover it and then I just pay them for it when my money was deposited - WITHOUT charging me 35.90/day.  So I won't be going anywhere for the weekend.  No driving.  Nothing.  I'm staying in.  So, don't ask me to go anywhere or do anything because I don't want to.  I want nothing to do with a social life right now.  My phone is off until I get hom and I'm not about to turn it on until I'm ready to talk on it.  I'm sick, I'm hurting, I'm tired, and I'm covered in plaster from this art I've been working on.  On top of that I have a lot that I need to clean at home, have to rehook my DVD player and gaming systems, start working out again after being sick for a while, and a million other communication problems with friends, boyfriend, family, and anyone else.

It sucks.  Everything is wonderful and then it goes right back to crap crap and more crap.  What's new?  I think I've written this before.  It was only a matter of time before everything started to suck again.  I can't wait for Jasper to get home.  He has a great way of cheering me up.

On a different note...  Our former President Ford had passed away a few years  ago.  Government agencies will not be open Tuesday in order to honor his memory.  I think everyone should take a moment to remeber President Ford for all the good he's done for our country, humanity, and the world."

Plot: **

Character Development: *

Humor: ****

Musical Score/Soundtrack: *****

Animation Quality: *****

Energy: *****

Overall: ***

Ok, so Ikki Tousen started out great.  I was mainly watching it because it was recommended to me and because of the good animation quality.  I didn't purchase this one for plot - and I'm glad I didn't.  While the series had a lot of energy, high quality animation, and wonderful soundtrack, it lacked in a lot of important areas if you're interested in content.  This anime is fun and packed with fan service galore.  ^_^  And they were doing great when they were sticking to that but then they tried to pull a deeper plot out of nothing right at the end of the series.  It reminded me a little of ""X"" by CLAMP at the end.  It felt as if everyone was trying to go against their fate and therefore following their destined paths anyways but then at the end there were several unexplainable plot turns that they tried to explain.  It's as if someone reviewed the anime and said ""We should really add some more plot to this so that we don't look like a bunch of perverts."" So they kept the fan service right up to the end, of course, but... well.... when it comes down to it... I just felt like I should have been paying more attention to the plot than skirts and clothing.  I found it hard to relate to the characters when it came to the end of the series, when, before, at the beginnning I felt much closer to them.  I attribute this to the fan service at inappropriate times.  If you're going to attempt to make me cry, showing the girls partially naked on the ground isn't going to get the tears going....  Know what I mean?  The plot twists at the end seemed rushed and underdeveloped.  Mabye not even thought out all the way.  

Overall, I thought it was a great series and is worth watching, but don't expect an awesome ending.  Just prepare yourself mentally for some confusion and a bit of disappointment with the plot.  Personally, I'd like to scan through the series, stopping at the good stuff and then just forget about the ending.  Even though the plot would have been really straitforward and predictable had they not thrown in the plot twists, I think it would have been better for the kind of anime they created.

The music was fantastic.  I love the ending theme - opening theme too.  ^_^  Sometimes I'd just leave the ending theme on repeat while I cleaned up after dinner, that is until they changed it.  *pouts*  The second ending theme is nothing to the first one.

Animation Quality was top-notch.  Very vivid colors and the skin has thickness.  Nothing too special about the character design or anything other than high quality.  The characters seemed pretty typical of a fighting, fanservice based anime.  I wish a few of the characters had had a bigger role.

Basically, it's worth the purchase if you can get it on sale like I did.  I can't say that, if I had watched it at a friend's house, that I'd go out and purchase it for full price. If I hadn't found the $2/disc sale on www.rightstuf.com , I wouldn't have gotten it had I already seen the series.  That's just my opinion though.

Warning.  This is not an anime for kids.  Definitely adult content based.  Some girls may actually be offended by the fan service, so, guys, you may not want to invite a chick over to watch it unless she's into this sort of thing.  ^_^;  Just advanced warning."

"event","For some reason I got sick again the other night after dinner.  Jasper was kind enough to drive me to the hospital but I was feeling better an hour or so after I got checked in so we left.  I decided to tell my allergist about it when I go to my appointment later this month.

Filling is loose again.  So much pain.  Will have to call the dentist again.

I started in on ""Little Green Men"" by Christopher Buckley.  Yeah, I know, I was supposed to go back to Shogun after Buckley's ""Thank You For Smoking"" but I just had to get more of his sarcastic wit.  ^_^  Couldn't resist.

Left Jasper alone to study.  Wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be since he lent me his brother's metal DDR pad.  I'ove been AA-ing pretty much everything on Light Mode on Max 2 and am progressing quite well in Difficult Mode in Super Nova and Max 2.  I might have to invest in DDR Extreme 2 just for Cartoon Heros, 321 Stars, and many others.  Super Nova though apparently has Graduation!  YAY!!!  But I have to unlock it.  I may do that later with Jasper.  I'm sure that, if we both take turns we'll be able to unlock it eventually.  I'm excited about seeing him tonight.  Decided to make Teriyaki and white rice.  This time less veggies and only mushrooms if cooked separately.  And I won't forget the Sesame seeds (I always seem to forget those).  Maybe he'll remember to rent ""Thank You For Smoking"".  He said he wouldn't mind watching it again and I'm dying to see it!  ^_^

I heard the movie is much different than the book in several respects.  I can't wait to see what liberties were taken with it but, at the same time, I hope that they didn't take too many liberties.  Sometimes too many liberties can be a bad thing.

Well, back to work!"

"event","My parents love Jasper.

Could I be any happier?

Possibly...  I'll be really happy if Jasper does well on his exams so I'm leaving him alone for Monday and Tuesday (although it will kill me ^_^) and then I'll see him on Wednesday.

Still gonna miss him like crazy over the holidays.

I felt pretty rotten for hanging out with him so late last night.  It's just hard to say goodbye sometimes.

Also felt rotten about not showing up at Eclipse this weekend.  I was just really tired after driving back and forth 3 times between Fernandina and Jacksonville all within one day that I just collapsed on the couch with my book and my cat and fell asleep.

Speaking of books... I finished ""Thank You For Smoking"".  I've determined that it's a distopia book.  Quite a good one too.  I liked the ending which, while he didn't die, went along perfectly with a distopia type theme and plot.  So, here's the rating (decided to rate books like I do anime ^_^)

Plot: *****

Chracter Originality: *****

Predictability: ***** (while it was mildly predictable, there were major elements that I didn't see coming)

Hell, everything is a 5/5.  Period.  The book was witty, smart, and playful.  There aren't too many books out there like this one and it's a definite ""Top 10"" kind of book.  Anyone looking for a good laugh, something fun, or good literature really needs to read this book.  It's well-written and flows easily, although it did have me looking up a few vocabulary words here and there, but never essential to the plot.  Lots of dialogue makes for easy reading.  It's very hard to put down but I was always hesitant to pick it up because I never wanted it to end.

Can't wait to see the movie with Jasper Wednesday night.  ^_^

And, for any movie fans, I heard ""The Fountain"" was an abstract flop and not worth seeing.  Apparently, it has nothing to do with the fountain and everything to do with someone writing a book, a woman with a tumor, and a man who floats in a bubble trying to save her by experimenting on animals.   According to a friend, it's one of those movies you should watch when high, stoned, drunk, or under the influence of anything other than intelligent thought.

Just thought I'd throw that out there.

Can't wait for Wednesday and the weekend.  Universal here I come!  Yatta!!!!"

"event","Work sucked on Friday.  Period.  Not much more to say about it other than thanks for spraying perfume that I'm allergic to by my desk (after I asked you not to do that), thanks for cleaning your desk with cleaner I'm allergic to and then spraying it around to freshen things up, thanks for not teaching me things I've been begging to be taught, and thanks for keeping me there so late that I got more of a headache and had breathing problems all day.

The rest of Friday was great!  Ran up to the hub and met up with Jasper who looked adorably cute in his suit.  he was a little late because he was picking me out a pink rose.  Kawaii!!!!  Soooo forgiven.  We drove up to Fernandina listening to J-Pop (something I've always wanted to do with him, listen to J-Pop in the car).  Somehow, I always knew that he would be the kind to sing a long and smile.  ^_^  It was fucking freezing in that dress of mine, but once we were inside, I was good.  We're gonna leave out the part about Jenn leaving the tickets in her home at Fernandina and then having to drive back and forth between her house and the Plantation several times over...  It looks like my parents like him.  dad even made him waffles this morning.  ^_^

And warmed him up syrup.  A good sign.  Pam and Barb liked him too.  Saw Mr. Rob and Cam at the event.  Both look great.  Lots of great food and the company was the best.  Tried getting Jasper to dance with me and he tried, but kept laughing it off that there were no arrows.  LOL  ^_^

I'm in a good mood right now - signed up for Health Benefits finally.  Although, I'd feel better if Jasper hadn't seen a lot of the childhood pictures and if mom wouldn't get that look like she's going to tell him something taht would make me cry.

Parents are in the other room trying to fix up the house... well, dad's trying to paint where the cats messed up a wall and mom's watching Superman.  LOL

Gotta love being home.

I hope to take Jasper to downtown Fernandina today.  Not like it's like the Landing or anything, but, I think he'd enjoy Steve's Fudge Shop.  Speaking of Steve, he's doing quite well.  He and Jasper met last night.  Oh!  Mr. Rob told Jasper to take care of me... that is... after ragging on my clumsiness.  damn him.  ^_^

Loving the weekend right now.  Anthony's parents will be coming over tonight along with about 15 other people and Jasper too.  Life couldn't be better.  ^_^

Still glad I took Thursday off of work to spend with my special someone.  So happy!!!!!

Ok, time for a shower.  Ja!

Oh, sorry, Epeon, but I won't be at Eclipse tonight or next Saturday either.  Actually, next weekend will also be loads of fun... mmmmm.... random Universal Trip planned only a week ago.  I love the fresh ideas that my mom and I seem to hatch.  ^_^  Too bad Jasper and Anthony won't be able to come.  I still can't wait for them to meet each other.

So much more to talk about... I've gotta get internet."

"event","Well, I finally got a call from Anthony the other day and it turns out that his relationship with Steven has ended.  Ant sounded really hurt and sad so I did my best sto cheer him up, but... I mean, with exams and everything to do with Law School and bills, I don't know how much else I could have done over the phone.  I almost wanted to drop everything I was doing, take a day off of work and just drive up there and hug him.  All the way to Tennessee.  *sigh*  I should have, looking back.  Then again, had I done that... then other things in my life would not have happened.  Either way, it sounds like he's ok.  He's just focusing everything he's got on his studies and work before he takes the time to act all emo and depressed over things that he shouldn't be concerned with at the moment.  I'm glad to see him pushing forward with all that he's got.  If anyone can get through such a rough time, it's him.  Anthony can get through anything and I believe in him.  All I can do is be there for him, but it's a real shame that I can't physically be in his state to give him a hug.  The good thing is that he'll be back down here on the 15th.  He wants to meet Jasper and I'm definitely ok with that.  I guess I won't be so lonely while Jasper's in Cali because Anthony and I can hang out and keep each other company.  Not saying that I won't miss Jasper because I'll miss him like crazy, but... I'm just glad I'm going to have a friend around for the break in addition to Epeon and Kristin and Orion.  Think I might head out to Eclipse with Anthony one Saturday or something.  Perhaps Irwin and Jasper will be nice enough to let me continue borrowing the DDR pad.  ^_^  Doubt it.  Although, it wouldn't exactly be in use, would it?  ^_^  And I have a paycheck coming up that will give me enough money to purchase Extreme 2.

Tay (a co-worker close to my age) invited me to her and John's (another co-worker) wedding in April.  I'm really glad that those two want to go on double dates and hang out and stuff.  Perhaps more friends in my near future?

I've decided to cut back on anime spending.  It was a difficult decision but it had to be done.  Roughly, per month, starting January I'm going to be spending between $80 and $100 on medical insurance, dental insurance, and medicines.  Ouch.  That's before taking into consideration doctor's visits and copays.  Ouch.  The good news is that I feel wonderful.  I'm not coughing nearly as much although, when I do cough it can be really nasty and painful.

So the anime's gotta be cut back.  Of course, there are other reasons for the budget cuts.

I need to save money.  In the past, I've had a lot of close calls and near misses that could have caused me a great deal of financial hardship.  I can't risk having that happen again if I'm considering having a future with anyone.  I have to be more responsible with my money.  so, I'm only purchasing box sets and movies.  Only going to buys mass amounts of DVDs if they're on sale.  After February, I'm cutting my spending limit into thirds.  2/3 needs to be in the bank.  Period.  I want to have a home one day and possibly raise a family.  A family is starting to sound appetizing to me now, however... not at this point in my life and not until I take a few more steps in the right direction.  Jasper too says that after February he's going to start stashing money away.  This is a good sign.  I like this.

Still haven't finished my books yet.  Getting there though.  I should have ""Thank You For Smoking"" finished soon, but it's one of those books that I really don't want to end.  A shame that it's going to.  Everyone has seen the movie but I refuse to see it until I finish the last 50 pages or so of this book.  And it's really light reading too.  But lately I've been spending all my time with Jasper and I want to spend that chunk of time with him.  Especially because he's going to Cali for about 2 weeks pretty soon here (on the 19th) and I'm going to miss him like crazy.

I hope he enjoys what I got him for Christmas.  Looks like we may be exchanging gifts this coming weekend or the weekend after.

Well, breaks over.  Time to start taking phone calls again.  These phone calls are nothing compared to AOL.  LOL."

"event","I can't remember the last time I was this happy.  Me and that certain someone are together now and I really couldn't be happier.

Last Wednesday he asked me to go to dinner or a movie or whatever on Friday, so I did of course.  And, well, I gave him the ""SA"" card thta was meant for him to receive at Christmas (for the second time).  He thought it was cute and was surprised it was me.  He never thought that I was the one who gave him such presents.  ^_^  A well kept secret.  Although, I couldn't really keep it a secret that I liked him through dinner.  I ended up confessing how I felt and that I have liked him for a good while, just never wanted to bother him with it because I know how busy he is and how much work and school mean to him.  Turns out he feels the same way for me.  ^_^

So we're together now.  We went out to Daruma and saw ""Stranger than Fiction"" for our first date.  Spent plenty of time talking and just hanging out for most of the evening.  He's my soul mate.  I knew that we were similar and I had always considered him to be my soul mate, but now I see it even more.  We spent most of the weekend together watching anime, eating out, and hanging out at the mall and various stores.  Went with him to his church - Catholic - and actually enjoyed myself.  My Grandmother would love him.  My parents will love him.

The exceptional amount of kindness and compassion he shows me is everything but unwelcome.  I've never smiled so much for so long.  All day Friday, my stomach was filled with butterflies and everytime I think about him, my heart beats faster and my stomach flutters.  I blush a lot when he comes to mind.  

He's been treating me to a lot of dinners and spending so much time with me, despite his imminant exams.  Although, I asked him to please study very hard Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday so that he will do well - even if it means not seeing me for a few days.  Besides, I might drop off food for him if he's too busy for a break.  I love him.  It was so easy to tell him that I love him because I knew when he said it that he meant it.  Sometimes I know that guys have lied to me, but with him I know that he's not lying.  He's just not that kind of person.  When I told him to please study extra over the next few days until his exams are over and don't worry so much about seeing me every day, he felt sad that he wouldn't get to see me and insisted on visiting.  However, I told him that it would be fine and that I knew how much his school and work meant to him and that I wanted him to do his best and that seeing me every minute of every day while he's trying to study wouldn't be best for him.  He understood and accepted it.  That means a lot to me.  It means that he does think about himself and not only about me and I like - love that about him.  While he considers my feelings, he still manages to focus on the goals and ambitions that he's set for himself.  Besides, I told him, it's not like you're ignoring me for WoW.  Heh.  He promised he'd never pass me up for a game.  ^_^

Speaking of games... I've gotten substantially better at DDR.  I actually passed Cartoon Heros on the next level (can't remember if that's standard or heavy.  I forget which one I was on).  All I know is that Jasper is jealous!  ^_^  Although, he did bring me his brother's metal dance pad for me to play with - just borrowing.  Although, I'd gladly offer Irwin $$$$ for it.  I heard he only paid like $30 for it so maybe I'll offer him $120 which is what I was looking to spend on one.  ^_^

So life's been great.  Will post more later."

"event","So I had a dillema the other night.  Justin asked me to go with him to the Reel Big Fish concert on Sunday night and I thought there were going to be more friends there... turns out he's thinking of this as a formal ""date"".  I don't want to ""date"" him anymore and I thought I had explained that to him...  I had already agreed to go and didn't want to tell him no since he was offering to take me to see one of my favorite bands, but I just don't feel comfortable.  So, today when I get off work around 4, I have to call him and let him know that I just can't.  There are several reasons for this.  Firstly, I care about someone else.  Secondly, I don't want to ""date"" him anymore.  Thirdly (is that a word?),  he told me that I'm not allowed to think about that other person when I'm out with him and, that, if that person does end up having feelings for me then he's going to have competition.  There is no competition.  I'm not some kind of trophe or something... and I was pretty offended that he would try and order me around like that.  I can't help that I have feelings for one of my friends.  I tried covering it up and hiding it, but everytime I think about him, the butterflies come back and I find myself blushing.  Other people have even suggested (a while back) that I like him, but... well... I just didn't want to like him... not that I want to like him now... but... why shouldn't I?  

Bottom line:  I wouldn't feel right going out on a date with Justin if I'm thinking about someone else.  It wouldn't be right to either of them.  Period.  And, of course, it's not fair to my heart to let someone tell me who I'm going to think about.

I talked to Alex about it and told him my situation and he said that it sounds like the person I like does like me, however... I'm still nervous about saying anything simply because of Jasper and Epeon's input.  Jasper's more of a realist and Epeon's more of a pessimist - ok, he's a huge pessismist.  Epeon put it like this ""I treat my friends that way - it doens't mean that I like them like you like him.  You should just tell him because he's never going to say it because he's too shy if he did have feelings for you.""  I got a similar response from Alex who said, ""well, I think you should just tell him whenever you're most comfortable.  It's not like you have anything to lose.  Right?  And why don't you have more female friends who think like you that you could hook me up with?""  And, then there's Jasper's short and sweet answer, ""Well, you'll never know until you ask.""  When I talked to Jasper about my situation and I told him that I didn't think that it would be fair to the person I actually like if I went on a date with Justin and that it wouldn't be right to give Justin the wrong idea about our friendship, he told me ""you're also assuming that this guy likes you...""  and he's right.  Maybe I've been assuming that this guy likes me too and not taking into consideration the advice that Epeon has offered, ""he might just treat all of his friends that way.""  And, when I thought about it, Epeon is very right.  I could see this guy just flirting with me (everyone agrees that it's flirting that's been going on for ages) because I AM female and I DO pay him attention and I'm very easy to flirt with and tease.  It could just be how he treats every female friend of his.  He does have a very joking, non-chalant nature in some respects (and that's something that I really like about him) and I could just hear him saying ""Awe, Jenn... I really only think of you as a friend.""

I realized that the feelings I have for him are very similar to the feelings that I used to harbor for Anthony - my best friend (for anyone who didn't know).  When Anthony and I were dating back in my 9th and 10th grade years, I had this wonderful fluttering feeling in my stomach everytime I thought about him.  Everything I saw, for some reason or another, reminded me of him and always brought a smile to my face.  As years passed, we broke up and he was just about to leave for high school when I realized that I still loved him.  Every time we were together I had never been happier or more confident and I wanted things to stay that way.  Then I found out that he was gay.  And it's like the feelings never really left me, they just faded into those of a solid friendship without the longing for something more because I know that I'd never have that.  I've done the same thing here - again.  When I first met ""him"" I thought he was funny and cute, but I didn't want to like him because of some previously stated reasons.  Now, everytime I talk to him, I find myself blushing, saying more than I aught to say, and just feeling that exact way that I felt about Anthony - my first love.  I don't want to say that I love him, because I don't know if I do or not.  But I know that I like him.  I just can't help but wonder if he cares about me.

Furthermore, (9 minutes till the end of lunch here...) I don't just want to jump into anything with him.  Several reasons for that also.  Mainly?  I don't want to rush things.  Also, I REALLY don't want him feeling like he's just some other boyfriend that's being added to a rediculously long list.  I'm sick of these fly-by-night relationships and I want something that's real.  I want commitment and longevity.  When I explained this to Jasper he said that it ""made sense"".  So, that's kinda why I'm, not procrastinating, but... taking my time.  I'm just worried that, if, well.... things go really well in the near future... that... I won't be able to tell him because I won't feel that it's the right time and then I could end up missing my chance.  But like Jasper said I'm  ""assuming"" too much.  I should be assuming that he doesn't like me at all and that he only thinks of me as a friend - a good friend.  So, I have to now think about how I can pursue something so vague....  I can't make him love me or like me.   I was thinking about asking him over this Friday... but I'm getting cold feet again.  I keep thinking about all the things that could go wrong that could make a future event extremely awkward for me and possibly him....  maybe I could tell him then...  Even then, it's so soon...  Will he really believe me if it's so close to a previous relationship even if the last guy was a complete jerk to me?  And what about the fact that I went out with one of his best friends who is unwilling to part from his feelings for me?  *sigh*  It feels as if I'm going in circles here.  I know how to fix that, but... maybe I like the circles... maybe I like this idea of him liking me all this time and I like imagining him trying to tell me even though I know that I'll be the one having to say something again...  again... not that I mind it.  However, I want him to know that I really care for him.  That I'm only interested in him and I'm worried that if I say such things that, because of my relationship history, he won't believe me or that he would try to believe me but still harbor doubt and scepticism.

It's tough dealing with these feelings.  So mixed and confusing.  I'll end up tell him.  It's just my nature.  I won't be able to hide it for much longer and this is something that should go slowly... so many options... so little time..."

"event","So yeah.  Mike left me.  No big deal at all really.  Personally, I was just irritated that he never really had time for me amidst his WoW.  Heh.  But that's alright.  I think he thinks that he hurt me more than he really did.

None of that matters now anyways.

I'm not looking for a relationship - just at fixing things with friends and having a good time.  AFter everything seemed to crumble (kinda saw it coming) I realized just how many people still care about my well-being and just how many people don't mind being there for me.  I couldn't ask for better friends.  ^_^

Justin and I are talking again.  I'm glad because I missed seeing him.  We've spent quite a bit of time together lately between Eclipse and PF Changs.  ^_^  My feelings for him are quite different than those that I used to have for him and I took the time to let him know this.  Even though it was painful to share certain memories with him and certain experiences that I don't enjoy sharing with other people (I don't think I've ever told anyone a certain thing about myself that I told him....) I'm still glad that we talked.  I feel like we understand each other's feelings a little better now and I think that he'll finally be able to move on.  Still feel bad for treating him the way that I did.  I appologized.

Life's been good to me lately.  Been spending a lot of time with family (grandmother is down from Michigan).  Mom and I crashed my cousin Casey's wedding.  Our family wasn't invited because of an argument my father and Uncle Marty had gotten into about 5 or 6 years ago.  But because my grandmother said something, we found out about it and discovered that the whole family and extended family would be in town (from Philly).  So we went for my Grandmother.  It was a great deal of fun once the hurt wore off as we danced and piled drink on drink.  heh.  Ended up singing Bohemian Rhapsody with my Uncle Ken and my Uncle Alby.  ^_^  Though I don't know them very well, we seem to have quite a bit in common.  LOL!  ^_^;

Spent a little time with Anthony.  Picked him up from the airport (of course I made a little ""Agent 007"" sign that he didn't see as he passed me - I didn't even see him.  heh).  He took me out to Johny Carino's and paid  - a nice dinner.  We spent a lot of time talking about relationships, FFXII (which, as he now admits I am a superior player to him - we'll save that for another post), and talking about high school.  Showed him Ikki Tousen and he said it was soft-core.  Heh.  I knew he'd say that.  And now he's interested in watching all of InuYasha with me.  *sigh*  I warned him about the ending... but... he still wants to watch it.  We're having fun with it.

Anthony's family is well as is mine.  His brother Nick resembles Harry Potter minus the glasses.  LOL.  Scared the crap outta Anthony by planting Pumpkin Boy outside his bedroom door one morning.  Priceless.  Wish I could have seen him terrified.

He now locks his door in fear that I will slip something into his room.  He should fear me.

And I think I was most nervous about this thing I'm going to on the 8th with my parents and two of my neighbors (Pam and Barb).  It's called ""The Taste of Amelia"" and I spent two days worth of time searching for an appropriate dress to wear.  Either nothing fit me correctly or the price wasn't right.  Very frustrating.  Eventually I found one (only $30 too!) but I needed a date...  I went down the list of people I know who are 21+ and there were very few people (sadly) that I felt would enjoy the event (it's a wine tasting and cocktail party for upper class people - ick - why we're going I have no clue but it should be fun).  Jasper topped that list of people and for some reason I was rediculously nervous about asking him to go.  Maybe because it involves him meeting my parents.  Don't know why that would bother me though.  Got to thinking about it and realized that my parents....

*continuation from yesterday... had to work - lol* ... my parents would absolutely love him.  When I got to thinking about it, he's very similar to Anthony and Alex and they adore those two.  So I'm not so much worried about him meeting them anymore.  However, my parents are insisting that he stay the night since we'll be out drinking.  heh.  So, he gets to sleep in the guest room and I get the couch with the demon cat - again.  I'm glad that, when I asked him if that was ok, he didn't sound irritated or anything or annoyed.  Now I'm more worried about him seeing baby pictures of me.  *sigh*

I've been reading this book ""Thank You For Smoking"" (you may have heard of it as a movie...) and it's brilliant!  No, I haven't finished Shogun yet.  Although, I'm now half-way through the monster.  I decided to pick up this one while I had been sick because it was lighter - and highly sarcastic - reading.  If you like sarcastic, witty humor, you'd love it.  Also picked up the She Wants Revenge CD from Target when I was supposed to be shopping for a certain someone.  heh.  yeah.  I know, I'm no supposed to buy anything before Christmas but... I just couldn't help it.  Purchased something for a friend and realized last night that it was no good and then got advice on what I SHOULD get him that would be appropriate.  Can't wait to return the other one and go pick out the new one some time this next week.  I'm worried about picking it out now because... well... I may have an allergic reaction to something I'm buying and I'm already pretty stuffy and runny as it is with all the drastic weather changes.

Anthony never called me when he got back to Ten.  I imagine that he's pretty stressed with exams and such.  I miss exams and essays.  I know, I'm crazy, but I do.  After I finish this semester working, I'm going to take an evening class.  History of course.  Maybe I should just major in that and then teach... I dunno... I like drawing too, but... anyways... I wanted to finish Shogun before then, but it looks as if it's going to become a weekend read for me instead of a weekday one.  I'll be too busy with piles of historical novels next semester - in addition to work - to be able to make a decent dent in it.  After I finish Shogun, I plan to read another ""icing"" book before starting in the on The Tale of Genji - which is a whopper and a half!  ^_^  After that?  Probably Memoirs of a Geisha (sticking with Japanese history) and then I might look at reading another James Clavell book or another quicky if I don't feel up to the 6 pitch font.  heh.

After all these years of complaining about religion, I finally decided to go back to Catholic Church.  Not that I'm turning my back on my beliefs, but... I realized that what I was really frustrated with wasn't really the church its self so much as that ONE church participating in Conversion Wars with the rest of the churches in Fernandina.  It doens't mean that organized religion is always bad - it all depends on who's running the show.  So, I'm looking for a church - maybe the one on Beach Blvd. - to go to this Sunday.  While I still practice Budhism, it can't hurt to also be Christian.  There is such a thing as middle of the road and there is such a thing as using religion as guidance for my life.  Also, if I ever DID get married, I'd HAVE to get married in a Catholic Church or my family would be greatly disappointed and would never recognize such a marriage.  It's the right thing to do.  I guess I might throw the Bible back into my reading list - for the 5th time.  heh.

Other than everything else, I've been feeling a little sick again lately, but I know by February everything will clear and I'll be fine.  I've pretty much cleared November - the death dealer month (as I know it).  It's the month that always seems to send me to the hospital and I've managed to pretty much dodge that with the help of a great Allergist.  My nose is a little runny today and I've got the watery eyes thing going on, but I'm getting there!  The good thing is that I'm at work and I'm getting through it.  I'm on lunch right now, only 3 hours left and I'm working at the SS-5 window so time flies by!  I heard that it's beautiful outside right now, warm, I get to see my Grandmother today (a shame that she's leaving tomorrow morning), will probably talk to several friends, spend time with my cat, read a little, wrap some presents, and, if I'm feeling up to it, return one gift and pick up another one for that someone special.  ^_^  My life's been great!  This is the best I've felt in years!

I really couldn't ask for better friends - compassionate friends.  I'm thankful for my parents with whom I can finally see eye-to-eye.  I'm thankful for my Dante who wakes me up with kisses every morning.  And I'm thankful for Final Fantasy and books and anime - especially CLAMP - to help cure my boredom and make me smile even in the darkest times.  I'm thankful to Jasper who keeps me smiling when I'm ready to frown - and he's always been there for me.  I'm thankful for friends who listen and take the time.  I couldn't ask for a better career.  I'll prolly be working overtime this weekend - cheers! - I get paid on Friday so that means Wasabi!!!!!  I'm so thankful for everyone in my life right now.  I'm thankful that my grandmom is still here with me and that she's doing well despite all the surgeries she's had.  I'm thankful for relatives who care about me and loving friends.  I'm also thankful that I can finally put things behind me, move on easily, and I have finally learned to let things go that don't matter.  Most of all, I'm thankful that I have a whole heart capable of loving and sharing with someone special, should he ever feel the same way about me.  

I'm a pretty lucky girl.  Cheers to the Holidays!  I feel great!!!!!!!!"

Glad to see that the Democrats are back in majority (first time since 1994 if anyone didn't know).  I don't know how well things are going to be looking up for the political situation of this country for the next two years at least, however, this is a start.

I can see where the Republican's campaign is going for the election in 2 years:  ""Fellow Republicans.  Get out there and vote so that what happened 2 years ago (this year) won't happen again in the position that counts the most - the election for our president.""

And then they'll pussy-foot around the war.  It would be too controversial for them to say it was ""bad"" or ""good"" and if we're still over there, which I'm sure we will be since a certain idiot is adament about keeping us there until his term is over, no one will ever talk about ""pulling out"" unless something catastrophic happens to our troops.

In life?

It's going ok.  I had a bit of a breakdown the other day, but thanks to Anthony and Mike, I'm feeling a lot better.  For a while there I was feeling pretty shitty about a lot of things.  But, I just needed to step back and realize that there was nothing I could have done about my supervisor being an idiot and my mentor being unable to communicate properly in English so that was that for that issue.  Then there was my mom freaking out at me simply because I didn't call her back or talk to her for 2 days.  *sigh*  Nothing I can do about her being overly sensative.  Mom and I hung out on Friday - paid holiday! - and she took me to an allergist.

Doctor?

He thinks I have asthma.  According to him (and I agree with this), they (doctors) shouldn't just be treating my symptoms - they need to find out what is going on with my body and do whatever they can to fix that because the bronchitus is just going to keep coming back if the real problem goes untreated.  He brought up some stuff that I would have never thought of: like I had my tonsils and adnoid removed at age 4 (younger than most) due to upper respitory infections, I've had upper respitory issues my whole life, and it tends to be more prevalent in the cold.  I never thought that how heavily I breathe after running would have been a tell-tell sign of asthma.  But, he put me on a treadmill for 15 minutes and I was weezing really badly - but I thought it was normal to breathe like that after jogging.  Heh - apparently not.  So I'm on an inhaler now and I'm taking these two other nose sprays to help clear my sinuses.  So far everything's working.  Whenever I have a coughing fit, I have to use the inhaler and the other ones get used twice daily.  I've discovered also that I could heavily during and after I finish laughing.  He said that's not normal either.  I really DON'T want to have asthma, but the more I think about it...

Went to see Borat last night with Mike, Jasper, Anubis, Sean, and Sean's little brother.  We all - with the exception of a few - got buzzed at Bennigans (thanks Mike for treating... ) and then laughed our asses off at that movie.  Couldn't believe how packed the theater was.  It was nice seeing James (bob) there also.  And the fun after the movie was nice too ^_^

Apparently, I'm a keeper.  ^_^

Ok, back to WoW.  I hate this damn Paladin who's been farming noobs....   must kill...."

"event","So I didn't stay... I walked to my car and it was a lot colder than I thought it would be.

I've gotten sick again - it's actually the same thing that I just had... only, I wouldn't be getting it again if the doctor had given me enough anti-biotics to start with.  So, I'm back to my Claritin and my Tylenol to try and clear this thing up.  Another 4 days paid off from work just because I'm sick and when I walk around too much, I get a little light headed.  Bright lights have been hurting and sometimes, it's hard to breathe with all the coughing going on.  I've been coughing up that green flegm stuff again.  Yeah, I know, it's icky, but I just have to cough it out, right?  Pretty soon, I will have coughed so much up that there's nothing left.  And that means that I'll feel better, right?

Or do you think I should go to my doctor again who's just going to give me 1/2 the prescription so that I'll have to go back and he can charge me and my insurance more money????  yeah, I'm not doing that.  I've had it with people half-assing their jobs all the time - especially doctors.  That pisses me off the most.  Why should a doctor half-ass his job?  Because he can make more money?  No, it's just that he doesn't really care about his patients at all.  Doesn't he realize that there will always be patients so long as people get sick.  and, trust me, people will always be sick.  But, just to make sure that business is always flowing, why don't we just make sure that they get sick on a regular basis and then charge them for each visit and give them cheap medicine so they won't really object to coming to the doctor???  We'll just tell them that they should call us if it gets worse and then we'll give them the REAL meds that we should have been giving them all along.  You know that med.  The one that takes care of it in 5 days?  yeah.  They hold out on that one, don't they?

Finished MKR2.  Really awesome ending.  Kinda expected that sort of ending from CLAMP.  Although, other artists would have taken a much different approach.  I kinda knew what CLAMP was gonna do with it just because, well, I know CLAMP.  Still, I enjoy watching the characters get to the climax.  That's the best part for me really.  Just watching the characters grow and develop.  The ending doesn't really matter so much, I guess.  If anything, the ending just gives closure.  What really matters is everything in between.  

So, here's the rating (I kinda wanna get back to rating my anime again):  (and everything's outta 5 possible points)

Animation:  *****

Character Development: *****

Plot: *****

Predictability: ****

Musical Score: *****

Pace: ***

Action:  ****

Love:  ****

Originality:  ***

Overall: ****


Yeah, I give it 4/5 overall.  Mainly because of the predictability of the ending and some of the stuff that was a little too fast paced in both seasons of the show.  I thought some of the early character development went a little quick during the first season.  IMO, it even felt a little rushed.  At times, the series felt as if they were holding back on some of the undertones that CLAMP likes to throw in there.  But that's just my opinion.  It's still a great show with a lot of catchy tunes and classic CLAMP animation (talking oldschool before CCS).  You can really see where they got a lot of their later character's personalities from like Meilin (CCS), Fuma (X), and even pieces of Syaoran (CCS/Tsubasa) thrown around everywhere.  Personally, I thought Nova was the best character in the whole series.  She's Hikaru's shadow from her heart, basically her dark side and she's a little psycho at times... well, most of the time.

Well, I guess that's about it.  One Piece is still really awesome.  We just finished episode 30 and Sanji just gone on board - ha! ^_^  No pun intended.

Also watching Iki Tousen (anime version of Battle Vixens).  Really nice animation style, love all the fan service, and, of course, the fighting is great.  I like the end theme for that series, I can see it getting stuck in my head.  LOL"

"event","So the long-anticipated game was finally released the other day.  I think that every proud RPG-er has been posting about it!  LOL  So, of course I had to get in on this action.

Been a little too sickly to enjoy it.  This sickness may be brought on by myself, however.  The gum Mike and I have been eating contains Aspartame... see previous journals and you'd know that I'm allergic to the stuff.  For anyone who DOESN'T know what that crap is, well, it was once developed for a chemical weapon but is now used as a sweetener in place of sugar in most sugar-free foods, snacks, drinks... and whatever else they can shove it into.

ANYWHO....

I love FFXII.  Total worship of the graphics.  *drools*

Lemme just make this a quick breakdown and save you the reading so I can play some WoW

CGI Graphics:  AWESOME!!!!!!  Better than most movies I've seen out there lately or not lately.  Lemme put it this way... the polygonal structures are really a lot different than they were in FFX2.  They've come a long way.  You can really tell that it's taking the PS2 everything it's got to run this game.

Battle System:  Awesome!!!!!!  I used to get really confused and messed up with Kindom Hearts style fighting and this is slightly different from that.  It's quite a bit like WoW.  I like that it pauses when I enter the ""action"" menu so that I can select what I want to do.  (I think I'm playing on Wait mode though).  Great feel!  Smooth movement.  I love that there's no random battles, but I do miss the fanfare (I have yet to beat a boss, but I heard that it plays after a boss is defeated), and I love the graphics.

Artwork:  Best I've seen in any Final Fantasy or video game yet.  Once again, they've outdone themselves.  It's hard to describe it really... but it's very realistic and in reminiscent of what the artwork used to look like in the strategy guides of the old games.  Sooooo worth it to get the Collector's Edition of the Strategy Guide because of the art.  I look at it daily.

Ok, the one thing that I don't like... the cities.  I get turned all around.  The mini-map is a waste of time.  The only way I can find myself and where I'm going is by using the larger map.  I'm gonna be relying on that thing so heavily that I'm going to miss out on a lot of art work.  Maybe they just made the cities too large or something.  I've heard other people saying the same thing, but Mike found them easy to navigate.  Maybe I'm just not used to this camera angle thing...  I dunno... but, so far, that's the only thing that I would change and it's minor, but would save me a lot of time if the camera angle was set while inside a town and then active when in battle areas.  Just my opinion though.  I get very lost and turned around in games.  So that may just be me, but it's odd that other people would comment about the same thing. Only, I've spent several hours lost and they've spent about 30 minutes lost.  Either way, that's quite a bit of time.

Can't wait to get back to the battles, though.  I love all the things they're doing with the bounty, loot, less gil from fights, combo-shots increasing better loot drops, and camera angles during battles.  I even like that there's agro now.

Over all score:

10/10  (I can overlook getting lost ^_^)


Can't wait to play some more, but I'll be on WoW tonight.  I'll have more to post later about personal stuff, but I've got FF on the mind.  ^_^

Yes, I'm White and Nerdy.  What's new?"

"event","This weekend I did so much with friends, Mike, and on my own and it couldn't have been better.

Friday night, Mike had a raid and I got a phone call from Epeaon to go to Hall of Terror where he and a friend were working.  So I left from UNF to go, got there around 8:15, but they didn't start until 9:00 and was a little bummed that I didn't have dollars to play DDR.  Settling, I watched some noobs play and laughed while they tripped over themselves.  (They were laughing too, so I didn't feel bad about chuckling.)  One of them was nice enough to let me finish off two of her songs after getting too tired to continue.  I really need to get a metal dance pad.  I spend way too much money on the machines.

So I went into the Hall of Terror (not really that terrifying - compared to HHN)  It was really well done.  If any of you have ever been to Adventure Landing on Beach BLVD here in Jacksonville, the Jaycees group decorated the Laser Tag area, making it a giant maze.  I was lucky enough to get a chance to volunteer to work there (no pay of course).  Epeaon was dressed as Ash and had tied up his friend Sam and was electricuting her with his little flail.  ^_^;  It really freaked people out.  LOL

I spent that evening hiding out against a wall and jumping out at people.  Which is also how I spent part of Saturday night.  So far, I've made 2 girls cry, 6 boys cry, and gotten a ton of ""nice rack"" compliments.  Heh.  All the pale makeup is a pain to get off of my face though.  I'll have to take pictures Halloween Night or maybe tonight - I'll be going out there until 11:00.  It's $9 if anyone would like to go.  And, if you want to work (we could use some extra help) just show up at 6 or 6:30 and let someone who works there know that you want to help with the Hall and your friend Jennifer (or sakurachan - I go by both) is there.  I'll be heading over right after I swing a white bed sheet by the college for Jasper.  Speaking of Jasper... I hate him because he shaved his beautiful hair.  *sniff*

Mike stayed Friday night - both of us were wiped out (his raid and my scaring)and fell asleep after Dante decided to stop playing with my bedroom blinds.  Saturday morning, I was supposed to go to Wasabi with Mike after he got off work, but the window guy showed up late.  Yes, I'm still dealing with my window problems.  Here's where we stand right now:

- Tore down old dry wall (about a month ago)
- Put up new dry wall (about a month ago)
- Respackled walls (about 1/2 a month ago)
- Repainted walls (about 1/2 a month ago)
- Replaced entire window (this weekend)

I think they still have to repaint the outside of the building.  Which reminds me, I need to take pictures of the replaced window for my mom.  We like keeping records.

I ended up running out to the back around 12.  The guy still wasn't done.  *sigh*  What a waste of a day.  Then picked up Mike, in hopes that we would make it to Wasabi before 2.  The guy still wasn't done with the window.  We ended up ordering Chinese and watching ""FMP? Fumoffu!""  I thought he had already seen it - I guess not.  We finished the first disk and he likes it thus far, so that's a good thing.  I ended up taking him back to the college late in the afternoon and left the guy to finish the outside of the building.

I spent the rest of the afternoon running around, piecing (lol - piecing) together a Luffy Costume.  ^_^

Spent from 6-12 at The Hall of Terror scaring children again and then headed to Eclipse.  I was surprised by how many people recognized my cos-play.  Epeaon and Sam were there, of course - Epeaon sporting a nice Zoot Suit.  ^_^  Among all the costumes, I was most impressed with Queen Elizabeth.  

To Be Continued (break is over)...

~.~.~.~. Edit (it's break time):

There was an Edward Scissor Hands and the robot from FLCL.  ^_^  Not to mention Dartanion who bought me a drink for recognizing his attire.  One of Epeaon's and my friend apparently thinks I'm hot and likes me quite a bit.  Nothing will ever happen between us (I have Mike and he's not really my type).  It's flattering to know that such a nice and cute guy would find me adorable, though.  I think anyone would appreciate such a compliment from just about anyone.  Being admired is very complimenting.

I was quite buzzed on the drive home and I noticed that Mike had texted me (of course stupid Sprint I never got the beeps).  I let him know that I was alright - it was obvious that he was worried.  Also another complimenting thing: to have someone concerned for you and thinking of your safety.  Being quite buzzed, I was glad to get home to Dante and my soft, warm bed.  It would have been better if Mike was there, however, I would have just passed out and there would have been little to no conversation.  Staying in character all night was fun.  It gave me a chance to dance kinda silly and not really worry about it.  ^_^;

Sunday was a well needed break.  I slept in until my kitty woke me up.  I looked over and saw that it was like 9:35 and decided to get up until I realized that we rolled the clocks back.  Ok, how I forgot that, I don't know.  However, I did remember it while I was at the club.  ""Yay!  An extra hour of music and drinks!""

To Be Continued...  (break is over)"

"event","I'm trying to eat better, right?  

Well, I decided to go back to the basics.  As in REALLY BASIC.

I figure in order to lose the weight that I want to lose now, I'm going to get back on my working out spree (that was really working).  The only reason I had to put it off was because of my bronchitus.  But that's gone now, so we're good to go.

I'm going to do something I've been afraid to do for years.  I'm buying a scale tonight.  That's right.  A scale.  That way, I can moniter my weight.

Tonight, I'm enjoying my last bit of ice cream indulging before I have to cut that back.  *sigh*  I'll miss you, Strawberry Cheesecake Ice Cream - I can now only have you once a week - if that.  And not in large servings.  *sniff*

I'm cleaning out the fridge tonight.  Goodbye all unhealthy foods.  (I won't really have too much of that, but the Mayo is going.  I either need to cut back on how much of it I use or I need to do away with it. And right now it's too tempting to smother that whole grain bread with it).  

I'm going to eat whatever's left in my fridge throughout this next week.  On Friday (pay day), I'm starting fresh.

So, here's my old grocery list and eating habits (so that we can see the changes):

~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~ Eating Out ~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~
--- #8 On the Burger King Menu with an OJ (Monday - Friday)- Croissanwich with ham, egg, and cheese.  ($3.85)

---  Arby's #3 - large Roast Beef Sandwich with a large curly fry and a pepsi.  ($6.00)

---  Wasabi - Teriyaki Chicken with Shrimp Sauce/Teriyaki Sauce, Clear Mushroom Soup, Zuchini, Mushrooms, Onions, and Brocoli, little Cakey things, Jell-O  ($9.99 - $20.00)(lunch/dinner)

---  Publix Vegi Sub (cucumbers, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, spinach, white bread) ($5.30)

--- Chinese Food Take-Out - Sesame Chicken, Egg Drop Soup, Fried Rice, Steamed Brocoli ($9.99)


~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~ Work Junk ~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~

--- M&Ms w/ peanuts ($0.75)

--- PopTarts (Strawberry with Icing) ($0.60)


~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~ Other Foods ~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~

--- Home made Teriyaki Chicken

--- Home made Stir Fry (Zuchini, Carrots, Onions, Green Bell Peppers, Mushrooms)

--- Hot Pockets (Egg, Bacon, Cheese)

--- Cereal & Milk (Honey Nut Cheereos)

--- Ramune Soda

--- Rum ^_^

--- Popcorn with extra butter and butter salt (medium)

--- Kettle Corn Popcorn (low fat)

--- Orange Juice (extra pulp)

--- Diet Pepsi Strawbery and Cream Jazz Soda

--- Wheat Thins (low fat)

--- Beef Jerky (teriyaki)



Some of these things have to go.

From now on, it's only:

-- Whole grain Bread

-- 2% Milk

-- Low fat snacks

-- Less Ice Cream

-- Burger King

-- Arby's

-- Italian Dressings



I really need to get back to my salads and whole wheat veggie subs and packing my lunch.

I need more fruit - I'm getting the veggies, most of the time.  So, I need to start eating more of the following:

-- Veggies (2 cups a day)

-- Fruits (2 cups a day)

And I could really use more milk and OJ in there too.

I need to work out at least 30 minutes when I get home every day.  I can finally last for 15 minutes  - 20 minutes while running, so I'll go do crunches and such after I finish running.  Eclipse will help and so will DDR.

The good news is that I'm going to be weighing myself.  I had gained weight again when I went to the doctor from the last time I had been there.  The depressing thing about that is that I know that I had lost weight over the past few months before going to the doctor.

I wear my weight well - that's the truth.

Last year at this time, I was 148.  This year, I was at 175 in July.  When I went to the doctor in October I weighed 155.  I've been sick since then so I'm guessing I'm in the 160s.  But maybe I kept it off anyways.  That's why I'm getting the scale.

Don't worry, I'm not obsessing over it.  I just need a way to keep track of what I'm losing.

More good news, I went to Buckle the other day and bought 31 inch waist pants and they fit comfortably.  I can also fit into a shit that I haven't been able to wear in months.  YAY!!!!

So, you ask, what's my goal?

I want to be at 125 again.  Yeah, I know that means losing 30 pounds.  But I'm only 5'3"" and that's where my weight is supposed to be.  I'm supposed to be somewhere between 120 and 130.  I was between 115 and 130 all through high school, but when I started college I was at 125 and that's where I want to be again.  I was comfortable there.

Gaining muscle weight isn't a problem for me.  I don't mind that, but I'm not working on building muscle.  I'm doing low resistance weights and light jogging and brief sprinting - stuff that burns it off.  I just want to be comfortable and be able to look in the mirror and be satisfied with myself and not say ""I used to look so much better than this"".  I've accepted that I look great right now - I'm healthy (that's a first), happy, confident, and wear flattering clothes that look good on me.  However, I would be happier if I lost those 30 pounds and toned my body up.

And that's all I've got to say about that.  ^_^;

On a different note: Mike and I have been together for a month now!  Sooooo happy!!!!!  (That month really flew by!)"

"event","So the story continues...

Well, after we bought several things at the anime store, we headed to this Oriental Gift Shop because Mike wanted a Luffy hat.  ^_^

I ended up killing a cockroach in front of this lady who apparently doesn't like killing bugs.  Awkward.

Found the hat.  He doesn't think it looks good on him.  I think it's cute.  ^_^

So, when we returned to the care, it wouldn't turn on.  No hiss, no sputter, nothing.  The battery died.  Now, neither of us know how to change a battery or anything so we figured we'd at least give it a try.  Besides, I could have called AAA if we really got in a jam.  So we went to a near-by 7-11 (not the gas station with the giant wall around it - there was one across from the Oriental Gift Shop) and they didn't have batteries.  Of course, the lady knew where we could find an Auto Parts store but gave us screwy directions and another guy had to come along and tell us it was by the art shop we passed driving into the parking lot - so it was like 2 blocks over.  YAY!!!!  Not that far!!!!  It was really really really hot and I felt really bad that Mike was having to deal with me getting lost (sorta) and now this.  But he was alright with it and so was I since I knew he wasn't irritated or anything.  Most people would have been.  At one point, I started getting really frustrated, but he reminded me that it would be pointless to dwell on this because it was just a little thing and could easily be fixed.  After I realized that, my attitude changed.

We stopped in a uniform shop to cool off.  I was hoping they'd have school girl uniforms, but they didn't.  One of them in Jacksonville does...  anyways... got to the auto parts store and there's this whole wall of batteries.  Yeah.  The numbers we got off of my battery didn't match any of them.  Heh.

We got some help and then this nice employee offered to go a few blocks over with us to install the battery - for free!  We had already been informed that they don't do installations for certain cars and the car has to be on their property, so I was really glad that this guy was willing to go out of his way for us.  Come to think of it, I never got his name.  Damn.  He gave us a lift in his truck over to the car and had it fixed in no time.  I offered him a $20 for going out of his way, he told me that I didn't have to tip him, and he accepted it after I explained that I wanted to because without him we would have been stuck there for a good while.  

There are good people in this world.  ^_^

Well, we got back in the car - it was working.  YAY!!!!  And set out back toward Jacksonville.  Following the signs to get back on I-4, we came across a very familiar intersection.  There was a river in front of us.  Sure enough, it was the first exit I had taken - Ivanhoe - and if we had just turned right instead of getting back on I-4 the first time, we wouldn't have driven around for so long.  LOL

Then again, let's put this into perspective.  From when we first started turning down roads to find the anime store, it took us 30 minutes to get there.  Right?  From the anime store, about 30 miles north is somewhere between Orlando and 95 - not too many places to stop though.  I'm not too familiar with that area either.  Had we found the shop when I first turned on Ivanhoe, my battery may have died somewhere in that long stretch before 95.  It just goes to show that...

Nothing is coincidence.

This will be a trip neither of us will forget.  ^_^"

"event","Yes, the third installment has arrived...

*sigh*

So, yeah, that annoying girl earned some respect from me and several groups of people ended up being able to reclaim their places in line.

I haven't really gotten to talk much about my stories with anyone other than Taylor in years, but I finally opened up a little bit and told Mike my ideas.  It was nice being able to talk about what we've both been working on for years.  His stuff is on a much broader scale, however, and mine is very focused on a few characters.  Mine isn't nearly as disturbing as his either nor as detailed.  But that's what I like about both of ours in their own respects.  I don't really want mine to have complicated and intricate stuff in it and I admire him for being able to think of such things that could exist if we keep furthering our technology.

The bathrooms in Psychoscarapy smelled as aweful as ever.  We ended up only doing two houses, Bill and Ted's, and MIB - I think I already said all that...

Well, we ended up crashing in the hotel - too exhausted to eat.  LOL

We found I-4 easily as we left the next morning and were determinded to find the anime store that I love so much on Colonial.  There's the real rub.  You can't get to Colonial from I-4 north.  You have to turn on the I-4 south exit to get there easily.  So I turned on Ivanhoe, because the name sounded like it was in the general ball park area.  Looking around, however, i thought ""there's no way that store was THAT close to a river.""  And I got back on I-4 and exited on an exit 2 up.  We drove north on that rode for a while until I got to Winterhaven and I knew I had gone too far (that's up there by Rollin's college).  So, after like 35 minutes of random directional driving, we finally got back on I-4, this time going South (so that I could find the right exit).  And there it was Colonial Drive and Ivanhoe.  That's right - Ivanhoe.

I figured that I had just seen it on the sign and that's why I had turned on it earlier.  Heh.

So we went shopping.  He found a lot of One Piece stuff and I once again dodged buying Sailor Stars and opted for some new wall scrolls (like I need any more) and a Christmas present for Mike and Jasper.  I also picked up the Tsubasa Chronicles Soundscape...

"event","I find myself bored at the end of the day and able to continue typing this...

Where was I?

OS yeah, the lines weren't as bad as they could have been.  I convinced Mike to ride MIB with me (he thought it would be hokey like the commercials looked, but I insisted that it wasn't, because it isn'nt).  He expressed his superior gaming skills surpassed mine and he would therefore score higher than me.  Heh.  Or, actually... ku ku ku...  little did he know (actually, he really did know that I'm good at that game)... that I am an MIB Master.  ^_^  So yeah, we made a bet.  If he won, I had to treat him to dinner (anything he wanted at Bennigan's) and if I won, he had to take me to lunch at Wasabi and a matinee movie and hang out with me for the rest of the day.  I dogged him.  Yeah.  My 400,000-something score to his 100,000-something score.  ^_^

Ok, sorry Mike.  Had to rub it in just one more time for the journal post.  ^_^

Likewise he was a bit pissy that I beat him.  So, I'm now better than him at DDR (although, I'm not really better - I've just been playing it more recently than he has) and at MIB.  However, one thing I have to throw in there is that a score over 100,000 for the first time on that ride is really good.  Most people have low, disappointing scores.  But that 100,000 score isn't enough to see the suit.  ^_^;

Anywho - I think he really liked Bill and Ted's Excedllent adventure and he told me that he wished he had gone sooner after watching the tribute they did for it.

We had planned on going to dinner after we were done with the park (my ankles were swollen again, btw - it's gotta be the fog) but we were both too tired to move.  LOL

So... about the lines...

While we were in line for the Die In Movie 2, there were these obnoxious (we guessed) high schoolers (prolly 9th or 10th grade) in front of us with (also a guess) a chapperone.  The chapperone (guess) had a matching shirt to one of the girls, so we figured they were mother and daughter, another girl was hanging all over this arrogant, thin boy who seemed kinda rough around the edges and it was obvious they were bf and gf, and then there was the girl who shouldn't have come at all.  It seemed like she was just fighting for attention from everyone and it was really annoying.  We guessed that she couldn't have been older than 16 and she REALLY wanted some attention.  Of course, they were annoying the heck outta me and we had resorted to laughing at them - until this group of slutty teeny-boppers (no offense Britt: you may have been teeny-bopper, but you were nothing like these whores) skipped half the line and cut in front of the group we had originally found annoying.  Of course, the attention whore didn't like that so she went and complained.  Although, nothing go accomplished.  My whole take on the thing was ""yeah, they shouldn't do it and yeah, someone should really do something about it or else they'll keep doing it, but it really isn't my place.""  Everyone was getting all frustrated over these scantilly dressed children and I saw no point in that.  Personally, if you're at a theme park, you're there to have a good time.  Why bother stressing over something trivial like that.  Especially at HHN.  The one hour line is almost constantly moving because there's a nearly constant flow of people entering the haunted house.  Therefore, it's only a few second's delay from when you'd be getting in there anyways.  Why bother stressing over a few seconds?  Those kid's lives must be really aweful right now because they don't have any morals or values and don't care about anyone other than themselves.  People like that are having a hard time either in their life or in their mind.  Because of that, lines just don't move fast enough and they feel that they are too good to wait.  And it's sad that they think that way.  One day they'll get what's coming to them.

But back on my story...  (I'm off the clock now)

After we rounded a corner, Mike shot some amusing dialogue at them (something about them beeing middle schoolers to which they quickly objected after removing their pacifiers - no really, they were sucking on pacifiers).  So, we tried passing them because the group in front of us passed them.  And, if they're passing the skippers, we might as well start a trend.  LOL

It was a little tough getting by, so then annoying attention whore yells out ""hey, guys!  what are you doing back there?!  We've been looking all over for you!""  And so we passed the teeny-boppers and suddenly the attention whore had my respect.  LOL

Well, I'll continue this later.  I gotta get out of the building before the traffic gets really nasty."

"event","I know.  I always manage to post the fun stuff later than it happened and I've been meaning to post this since I got home on Saturday (and Mike's been driving me up the wall about it) and I finally had a 15 minute break at work to sit down at my desk (well, I was already sitting down...) and type it out.

Friday was very eventful.  Mike had stayed over the night before and I was somehow already managing to run late.  Not a good start, but I promised myself not to get aggrevated.  And so I didn't.  *so proud*

I was really happy that it was casual jean day at work and I could get away with ""park clothes""  (a halloween t-shirt, jeans, and tennis shoes).  I ended up not wearing a creepy shirt to HHN because I didn't want to wear it to work and offend someone.  Well, I bought snacks during lunch, forgot to go to the bank (namely because I just didn't have the time during lunch and it was absolute hell leaving the parking lot), and somehow manage to catch ZERO lights the whole way!!!!  Yeah, I know!  Phillips and JTB intersection is normally a nightmare that lasts 10+ minutes but I just drove right through the green turn arrow, hit no traffic at the JTB/95 junction (usually another 10+ minute hell), and sucessfully made it to UNF to pick up Mike in record time!  Then again, I didn't try my luck with the JTB/9A junction, I got off on Gate instead and cut through the Town Center.  I had planned on going strait from UNF to 9A South and taking that to 95 (love the new roads!), but I forgot to go to the bank, so I had to loop back around to Gate, stop at Compass (grrrrrr - I'll have to post about them some other day), waited 15+ minutes there before finally getting out of the parking lot.  Then it dawned on me that 9A would be a nightmare by JTB and it really wouldn't be fruitful to go that way.  After several U-Turns and 5 miles north just to go 10 miles south, I finally made it down Southside Blvd to 95.  YAY!!!!  Rotten traffic on I-4.  Mike slept through the St. Augustine part of the trip after I made him slightly car sick with all the u-turns.  ^_^;

Need I mention how much I detest rubberneckers?!  If you don't know what a rubber necker is, just imagine that you're cruizing down a highway at 95 miles per hour (on 95) and then you see this wonderful sign that says ""to 1-4"" and you go to exit and the traffic is dead.  Stop and go.  You think to yourself ""why is it like this?""  And then, several mile down the road and about 30 minutes later, you see why.  There are bikers on the side of the road just chit chatting and the people driving are sticking their heads out their windows, turning around sideways in their seats just to look at what the bikers are doing on the side of the road.  Their necks may as well be made of rubber with all that stretching they're doing.  That happened a rediculous amount of time, only instead of bikers, there were cop cars or broken down cars.  Stuff like that.  So it was dark by the time we got there.  Ended up not getting the government rate on this room because the idiot at the front desk deleted the reservation as I checked in.  *sigh*

Despite all of that, I loved the trip down there.  Mike's great car company (when he's not snoring!).  It was  quite a walk from our hotel to the park and I don't think Mike expected it to be that far.  I didn't mind it, but next time I would prefer to stay on the park (for obvious reasons).  Getting the tickets from the electronic pickup was the best idea in the world.  Guest Services was packed with people and the electronic pickup's wait was only a few seconds and it just spat our tickets out and we were on the park.  Mike loved the costumes.  I knew he would.  I just wish the scare zones had been as good as they were when they held HHN at IOA (Islands of Adventure) because he REALLY would have loved those!  We only went to 2 houses: Die In Movie 2 and PsychoScarapy.  Those were the two I told him I liked the best and he thought they were silly.

I think he's just detatched himself from anything scary because of Doom 3.  I was pretty scared - as usual.  Then again, I like letting that adrenaline get up there like it does when I'm there.  We talked a lot while we waited in those gruesome lines.  He's a good sport.  I knew that he must have felt tired, but he stood in line with me and got through it.  Even though we had to wait much much much much MUCH longer than I'm used to waiting, it really didn't seem that long or annoying because he was there.  It's amazing what good conversation can do.

Well, my break is over and I have to go find the girl who's sitting with me.  I'll continue this later - there's better stuff to come!  ^_^

(work is great!  We're interviewing today!!!!!  Thought this would have been scary, but with Brittany beside me, I'm doing alright!)  *gets a sudden boost of confidence*"

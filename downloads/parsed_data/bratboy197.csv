"event","Merry fucking Christmas!  This is probably my last bastion of privacy.  How am I spending my Christmas?  Well, I spent Christmas Eve alone. Hoang came home from work early.  I hadn't showered.  He made mention of why don't I come and then his niece came to pick him up.  I didn't see him again until about 1030.   Earlier in the week I had told him I was going to my sisters around 3 and he said he would probably go to back to his family around 1 or 2.  So we were woken up at 1030am by his nieces ""uncle when are you coming over?!?""  Seriously?!??   So we left to drop him off at around noon.  He kept asking me what was wrong?  I'm not going to say something and look like a dick on Christmas.  
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME THAT THE PEOPLE I DATE DONT WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH ME CHRISTMAS?!?  I went through this with Colin.  I could care less if I never got another gift from him again, if it meant spending a decent/ significant amount of time with the one I love.  Is this too much to ask???
And then there is my best friend who I haven't talked to in nearly 2 years.  I have no idea what the fuck I did to her where I can't even get a call or text back.  
Maybe it's me.  Maybe I'm just a terrible person.  Or maybe life is just preparing me for the inevitable...that I'm going spend most of it alone.  
I'm sure people who don't know me, may see this as feeling sorry for myself but I don't fucking care.  No one should spend Christmas alone.  And even though I am going to my sisters house in a bit, I would much rather be spending it with someone who loves me.  But apparently this is too much to ask.  And so I will go to my sisters and act like everything is fine and put on a happy face because that's what I'm expected to do and if I end up getting included in the movie tonight I will again put on a smile and grin and bare it because that's what I do."

"event","I stayed home today from school - the pain was too much.  To offer an explanation to the previous entry.

My sister and I had a fight - I was supposed to go over there between school and PT but the problem was I did not go to school because of the pain.  As a result my sister called the next day and then when we finally spoke she blew up at me.  

I just needed to vent.  I know that I am going to have explain things for the rest of my life.  I got a book yesterday at Borders called ""Numb Toes and Other Woes: More On Peripheral Neuropathy"" written by a guy that has a form of peripheral neuropathy and its in layman's terms.  This is something that I have really not encountered before - every book I have looked at I have needed a dictionary next to me.  

This is something I will be dealing with for the rest of my life.  So far I have tried to not let it limit me too much - yeah today is one of those days where I have no control but I am not just lolling about - I have been doing homework.  

Last night I was looking online at the first book in this series and amazon had an except so I read it and became pretty depressed because while this is something that the drs are trying to control there is no simple cure and it is something I will have for the rest of my life.  To say that I am not amused in the least really doesn't cover it.  

Right now I am just - I don't know"

2006 - Thing to take note of that will relate to this:
- 2006 was the year of the Dog
- 2006 was designated the year of deserts and desertification by the United Nations General Assembly
- 2006 was International Asperger's Syndrome Year
- 2006 was the Year of Mozart (celebrating his 250th birthday)
- January 1 to June 30, 2006 was predicted to have tied 1998 as the
   warmest semi-year, for any year since the 1890s. Overall, forecasters and
   scientists predict 2006 to be the third warmest year on record, behind
   1998 and 2005.

        Torah, the apocalypse was to have occurred in 2006.

Interesting eh?

2006 was a year unlike any other for me.  Of course such things could be said about every year but for me this was a different year.

I had began 2006 with high hopes - I was to have my trial for my spinal cord stimulator and possibly a permanent one.  My ex was to apply to grad school in Albany and I was to transfer.  The goals I set for myself were all more personal goals involving the improvement of my character:

1: To compromise. This is something that I am constantly relearning.

2: Maintain focus on what is important.

3: If you don't like something change it.

4: Appreciate everyone or else they will be gone.

5: Stand up and speak out.

I think I managed to accomplish all of these to a degree.  Compromise is something that can take a lifetime to fully be able to do and admittedly I am a selfish person at times.  Focus is not an easy thing to keep - especially with the events of the first 8 months of 2006 - but I am going to put humility aside for the moment and say that my grades were fantastic.  I have done more than my share of speaking out - sometimes sticking my foot in my mouth but a few weeks ago - at my sister's request and initiation - we sat down with my mother and made our points clear.  Whether or not it got across remains to be seen.  Appreciating people is something I learned more than ever last year.  I think without (in no particular order for those would complain later on) the help of Annie, Andrew, Andrea (sister), Andrea (C), Lisa, my father and his wife, (Colin - to a limited degree) Jan, and Juan last year would have been even rougher.  You learn to appreciate people when you are in a position where you need help with the simplest activities.  Annie and Andrew (surprisingly) proved to be my points of stability.  Andrew and I had not spoken for roughly 2 years because of his own issues - which I will not go into in the forum - but had appeared sometime in June not only having had dealt with his issues but coming out stronger than I have seen him previously.  After the breakup, it was my friends and members of my family that helped me cope with everything so that I could move on with life and begin a new chapter.  To them: my greatest love and appreciation.

At the same time there are those who I still feel close to but have lost contact with not through my own doing but for reasons unclear.  To these individuals - I will not give up on them - when the time is right and/or when I am supposed to hear from them I will.

So then why the why list the items I did?  I could sit and rattle off a myriad of lame ass euphemisms demonstrating how each of these things somehow relates to the events of the past year but those who know me and know everything that transpired last year - the good and the bad - know how those things fit together. 

I posted this elsewhere last year but its a great way to reflect on the entire year so I will post this again with the appropos changes and then onto next year:

1. What did you do in 2006 that you'd never done before? I became a cyborg, had to confront the issue of a loved one having cancer, and went to San Francisco.
2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year? I don't make resolutions anymore - I just set goals.
3. Did anyone close to you give birth? Erin
4. Did anyone close to you die? As stated last year, I should be so lucky.
5. What countries did you visit? Canada, but Canada doesn't count because it's a dominion.
6. What would you like to have in 2007 that you lacked in 2006? Peace of mind, still want those brand new nerves for my arms, and perhaps a whoopin cane.
7. What dates from 2006 will remain etched upon your memory, and why? February 6th - the beginning of the end; March 18th - the day Annie surprised me; April 14-15 - the middle of the end and the fact that my sister will probably not let me forget the later; July 5 - the day I became a cyborg; August 4 - The end of the end.  September 27 - a new beginning with a new love.  October 6 - Angela's wedding where I almost cried.  October 13-18 - playing refugee camp.  December 1-5 - Going to San Francisco December 24-25 - A Christmas with no drama (the first!).
8. What was your biggest achievement of the year? Maintaining my GPA and getting into History Honors
9. What was your biggest failure? Missing my niece's first birthday
10. Did you suffer illness or injury? The persistant medical issues with my nerves in my arms and shoulders.
11. What was the best thing you bought? I would have to say my education.
12. Whose behavior merited celebration?  Annie and Andrew - Annie for flying down twice to be there because I needed her but I think equally important Andrew for conquering his demons and demonstrating that he is once again the friend I grew up with - the one I can trust, rely on and love (not in that gay way!)
13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed? The United States Government, the New York State Worker's Compensation System, my mother - to a degree.
14. Where did most of your money go? To my landlord, the automobile industry and it's ilk.
15. What did you get really, really, really excited about? Going to San Francisco, meeting my current love, the announcement that Sweeney Todd is going to be made into a feature length film and my surgery.
16. What song will always remind you of 2006? Defying Gravity
17. Compared to this time last year, are you:a) happier or sadder? b) thinner or fatter? c) richer or poorer? Everything is on par with last year
18. What do you wish you'd done more of? Recreational reading and having time to appreciate the finer things in life
19. What do you wish you'd done less of? Medicating myself
20. How will you be spending Christmas? Christmas is 357 days away, do we really want to get me worked up about this so soon?
21. How will you be spending New Years? It's hard to say. Hopefully sans meds and tanked as Jesus intended it to be.
22. Did you fall in love in 2006? Yes
23. How many one-night stands? None
24. What was your favorite TV program? Iron Chef, Lost, Alias, Smallville, Colbert Report, Family Guy, Boston Legal, Grey's Anatomy, Survivor, Prison Break, and Good Eats.
25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year? I don't hate...I socially destroy...it's much productive and rewarding. Although I don't have the time to participate so much in that anymore.
26. What was the best book you read? Child - the only tomes I have read this past year were school related.
27. What was your greatest musical discovery? If I made a great musical discovery do you honestly think I would be here posting this and not on the sands of a Micronesian island sipping Mai Tais? HONESTLY!  Though discovering Grey Gardens while up all night where I accidently caught the Drama Desk awards was a good one - insane Kennedy relations?  You can't really go wrong there?
28. What did you want and get? A Spinal Cord Stimulator and A New Argentina
29. What did you want and not get? Alias the Complete Series in the pretty boxed set
30. What was your favorite film of this year? It's a tie between Pirates of the Caribbean II and Casino Royale - I am still bitter about Rent
31. What did you do on your birthday? Well - I went grocery shopping and christmas shopping and did laundry - Zhi bought fillet mignon, which Andrew prepared, ate dinner with them and enjoyed cake and pressies.
32.What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? A cattle prod.
33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2006? Amusing
34. What kept you sane? Clearly not the maternal side of my family. Calabrese's little pearls of wisdom, friends, and school.
35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most? 37!!!!
36. What political issue stirred you the most? The whole marriage amendment crap - go and read the transcripts!  Pack of jackasses running this country.
37. Who did you miss? Annie, Glenn, Angela, Ktb, Jessica (who is AWOL), Shaun, Amanda, and of course those who have not heard from in a pig's eye.
38. Who was the best new person you met? Aside from Zhi - Dr. Stevens and Michelle.  Someday the conversations between Dr. Stevens and I will make a great comedic novel or even a television series.
39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2006: Perseverance. What I learned from Andrea Calabrese: Being a raging bitch pays off in spades. Not all babies are evil some are adorable.
40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year: As it says in the headline of my profile: ""Sickness will surely take the mind, where minds can't usually go.  Come on the amazing journey and learn all you should know.""

So what should I expect for 2007?  I have no idea - life has taught me thus far that you can only plan or set goals and hope and strive to achieve them.  Whether or not you do achieve them lies with your own desire, motivation and will power to surpass the unexpected.

My goals are pretty fixed and in no particular order:

1. Continue my successes in school.
2. Strive for fiscal stability.
3. Research Graduate Schools and visit some of them.
4. Apply to Anthropology Honors; Apply to National Honors Societies for both History and Anthropology.
5. Determine research theses for both History Honors and Anthropology Honors.
6. Decide on which MA/Ph.D. program I want to pursue and apply.
7. Prepare for the GREs.
8. Really try to find some sort of resolution for my medical issues, especially the shoulder issues, the leg issue that comes and goes since surgery, and get off some of my medications.
9. Get my dental work finished.
10. Make time for myself to have fun!

My goals for January: Get my apartment in order before the semester.

These don't seem like much but believe me they are. 

I still need to focus on learning how to take my time on doing ordinary things around the apartment because it only results in my being in even more pain.  I also need to focus on improving my outlook on myself - I know humility is a great thing but when it comes to various facets of my life I tend to short-sell myself. 

And so I will end this in the same way I began this:

2007 - The Year of the Pig
    - International Polar Year
    - International Heliophysical Year
    - The year of Pisces
    - ISBNs will be 13 digits instead of 10 thanks to all the crap books out there (::coughs:: James Joyce::)
    - March 3-4 - Total Lunar Eclipse
    - March 11 - Day Light Savings Time will begin ahead of schedule making millions of Americans late for work and resulting in my being cranky for 2 days.
    - June 30 - will have a blue moon - something odd/rare will happen.
    - July 1 - Hong Kong which was returned to the Chinese Government from the British Government in 1997, will be celebrating its 10th anniversary of its Special Administrative Region Establishment.
    - July 7 - 7 New Wonders of the world to be unveiled.
    - September 11 - Partial Solar Eclipse
    - November 4 - Daylight Savings Time Ends - I will be well rested November 5

TBA - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows comes out thus possibly devistating millions of children and thousands of parents.

Happy New Year Everyone!  Hopefully 2007 will be a better year for everyone!"

"event","Last night were the midterms.  I really wasn't surprised by the NY elections.  Everyone knew that Clinton would be re-elected and that Spitzer was going to be governor.  It was money in the bank.

I have to say that this year I was probably more informed about the candidates (all of them) than in previous years.  That's not to say I wasn't paying attention in previous elections but you know that when you go to the polls you see all these other names and other parties that you had never heard of...The League of Women Voters actually takes the time to gather information about all these candidates so I went to their website, www.lwv.org, and read up.  I feel no shame in how I cast my votes but to the third parties out there - please get some viable candidates...PLEASE!  The ones that you currently have are whack jobs.  Oh and by the way...while I am at it...thank you NYS for reinvigorating the Cuomo dynasty!  Mario, the former governor, really did a number on the state getting it into a huge amount of debt resulting in the Pataki administration - which wasn't so terrible but wasn't so great either.  New York should perhaps consider changing its monicker from 'The Empire State' to the 'The Empire of Mediocrity.'  So now Andrew Cuomo is Attorney General.  Grand...just grand.  If he is elected Governor - well we will wait and see.

Meanwhile I look at the rest of the country.  The Democrats got control of the House - still waiting on the Senate.  I am not sure how I feel about any of this.  I am all for balance of power.  Clearly we have not had that over the past 6 years.  True the government was set up with the 3 branches and they are supposed to act as checks and balances but that has been rare.  Back to the Dems...I was up watching the results come in - yes I am that kind of person - and many of the commentors - I watched a myriad of channels (Except Fox News, which is banned in this house...it just makes me feel dirty) and they said similar things - that yes the Dems were winning but - and this was I found slightly disturbing - they were winning with conservative democrats, which meant that the Republicans were losing Liberals.  If you had known me about 10 years ago I would say that a Moderate is merely someone who can not make up their mind.  I have since changed that sentiment, recognizing that I am a moderate because of my stance on various issues.  I am not sure whether this is good news or not...

Let me explain - I can almost guarantee - using for example the Marriage Protection Amendment - that the Liberal Republicans were the ones who voted against it - and if I am wrong it would be a safe bet that many of them voted against it. 

Let me take a moment to celebrate the fact that Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) is out!  That man worked many of my nerves.  Bravo PA!  I may revoke your square state status yet - but don't count your chickens just yet.

Interestingly, I picked up this week's Newsweek, which focused on the state of the evangelicals in the country - a very interesting article thus far.  The quote I liked best so far was: ""In his Encyclopedia of Evangilism, Randall Balmer defines evangelicals, broadly, as Protestants who emphasize conversion and are characterized by 'a suspicion of wealth, worldliness and ecclesiastical pretention.'""  HA! 

Back to politics - they, the talking heads, are speculating that Nancy Pelosi is probably going to become the next Speaker of the House - which would make her third in the line of succession - this means should the President and Vice-President run afowl of misfortune - she becomes the President.  Something about her doesn't sit right with me. 

So where does this country stand.  Well - it's really to early to say.  I think we will know by the end of the 1st 100 days - which would be around March 31st.

Also, several states introduced amendments to their constitutions that would ban gay marriage - so here is a list of states that are on my ever expanding ""Dead to Me"" list:
Alabama (the gay rights issue just sweetens the fact that I was right in making you dead to me for being a square state)
Arkansas
Colorado
Georgia
Idaho
Iowa
Kentucky
Maryland
Michigan
Mississippi
Montana
Nebraska
New Hampshire (Thank you for proving my point and rationaling my dislike of you)
North Dakota
Ohio
Oklahoma (Thank you for proving my ban on the musical of the same name accurate - Oklahoma - you are not OK!)
Oregon
South Carolina
South Dakota
Tennessee
Texas (For the Bush Dynasty and introducing the Marriage Amendment)
Utah (I never really cared for you or your Mormons!)
Virginia (Change your slogan to ""Virginia is for heterosexual lovers and not fags"" POST HASTE!""
Wisconsin

Also dead to me:
Mormons
Ponchos
Sarah Brightman
Christopher Columbus (The non-historical one)

And now to the states that are
On Notice
Alaska
Arizona (You are close to being transferred to the list above)
California (same as AZ missy)
Connecticut
Delaware
Florida (You people screwed up an election because he do not know how to vote properly)
Illinois
Louisiana
Pennsylvania

Also Square States not listed on the Dead to Me list (you know what you did), ABC
The History Channel
Broadway (for Crimes Against Humanity)
Glenn
Lockwood Cybrary
Taiwan
Stephen King
Andrew Lloyd Webber

Well let's wait and see what happens to the country - if we do begin to heal from the rift of the current administration."

"event","Some of you wonder why I love musical theatre - particularly Patti LuPone.  Wonder no longer - since some of you are snowed in allow me to share her latest rant - a valid vocal vociferation of a cat gone home to Jesus and the Bank of America...you wonder why I love this woman despite the carryings on of some of you that she some sort of nouveaux Ethel Merman (shame on you!), well here is the reason:
Dolls, Dolls, Dolls,

I know it's been a long time since I've rambled. But ""Sweeney"" closed and I went on a little vacation, I got a little sick, and Katrin wasn't around to type for me. KatPat's back together again and here's our Ramblings.

So first...I'm going to rail against the Bank of America. Take your money and run... stick it in a mattress. It's better than trusting those %#@!%$ people at that bank. This is what happened to me. I hadn't used my ATM card in a while because I didn't need to, I didn't have to. Somewhere along the line without my knowledge, without my appproval, without consulting me, without contacting me in any way, they invalidated my PIN that had been my PIN for 15 years! I found this out through a humiliating experience at the IGA trying to buy a bag of spinach. My card was rejected. I blamed the incompetence of the IGA swipe machine and just moved on with my life. Lo and Behold! It was I who was Persona Non Grata. It was my PIN, my card, that was errant. I called the customer service of BofA and got the runaround twice. A lot of apologies and no restitution. They couldn't explain what had happened, and they weren't about to fix it. They gave me a lot of excuses, but, as I said to them, I want my old PIN because it is in honor of my dead cat. And, I want an explanation as to why I wasn't informed that they had invalidated my card. ""No, no, no, can do, I can't go for that, no, no, no can do,"" was their response. My response to them was, ""Bite me,"" and I closed my accounts. I swear to God, what is this country coming to? And who are these impervious assholes who call themselves Customer Service Representatives? Enough said.

So, ""Sweeney"" closed and what a very emotional closing night it was. I will never forget looking out at the audience in the final ballad seeing young women weeping. I wept with them. The year of ""Sweeney"" was the theatrical experience of my life.

I'm on to Jake Heggie's opera, ""To Hell and Back."" It's very hard, but very beautiful music. I've crossed over to the opera world thanks to some very intrepid souls who think I can sing the stuff. I hope I don't let them down.

I saw something very cool on my little vacation. I was on a boat and all of a sudden a school of mullet started jumping out of the water. And then, a tarpon came flying out of the water chasing them. He jumped in and out of the water twice. It was a National Geographic moment and I am so glad there is some of that left to see and enjoy in this world.

I gotta let Katrin go... it's late. KatPat needs food. Next time I'll talk more about my favorite ""Sweeney"" actors.

Love,
Patti"

"event","Well - I am taking a moment from school work to actually post something other than crap.  I had my first date since the break up yesterday.  It was atypical to others.  We went to dinner and then to spot and then went for a walk around the lake at Delaware Park.  Talking and just getting to know each other.  I find him to be very fascinating and while we differ in a variety of ways its the type of difference where they are not going to become an issue.  Whatever is going to happen will happen - if nothing else I would value his friendship.

In other news - my medical situation has been iffy.  PT is rough.  I have woken up daily with pain my shoulders - I think a new mattress may be in order but Sunday and Monday it was at its worst.  I had gone shopping for a suit on Saturday nothing heavy duty.  I woke up Sunday and I was practically crying.  The stimulator does not impact my shoulders and I suspect that this pain has something to do with the trial because it is since the trial that I have been having this pain.  As for the stimulator - well its too soon to tell.

What I am most pissed about is missing the Dalai Lama.  I had been still dealing with my pain issues in the shoulders.  As I was walking to the stadium I ran into Sue - a class mate from most of my Anthro classes this semester and two semesters back.  I should have given her the ticket.  I made it until 2pm.  I could not sit in the bleachers and ended up leaving and by the time I got to my car I was crying - not from missing the experience but because of the pain.  To the individual(s) who have recused their beliefs to my giving up - kiss my ass.  Really kiss my ass.  

I have been starting to think about Grad School more and more.  I am going to broach the topic with teachers shortly.  One of the authors that I have read - a historian on China - teaches at Yale and I would love to learn from him - Jonathan Spence.  I also looked at the Anthro end of things and its equally interesting.  Dr. Tedlock is pushing San Francisco because of the interest in sexuality but I do not want to study just that.  I am still not sure which I want to go into because I have seen the benefits and detriments of both.

I did have an idea for an ethnographic study and in actuality it would almost be considered ethnological if carried out right but I am not sure yet and I do not want to mention it until I talk to the party(ies) that I would like to involve.  Cross-culturaly it would be fascinating - especially considering background(s).  I will see.  

Right now I am in school isolation mode and have taken to turning the machine down so it is not a distraction so if you read this and I do not get back to you - be patient - its a semester that requires a lot of work.  And busy work is good.  BTW I got the voice recorder and am dying to try it out."

"event","Well he came to get the remainder of his belongs.  

I am surprised that things went as they did.

But for now - it's a lot to deal with.  

Four and a half year.

And there is a void.

Right now for me to express everything is next to impossible - sadness, emptiness, anger, resentment, heartbreak - the list of adjectives goes on.  

Four and a half years.

I wish there were some statistic or study that has been done that was not the result of some religious group's sentiment towards homosexuality but I have not found anything neutral.  

Right now I want the hurt to stop.  

If there were signs I wish I could have recognized them.  Yes these were all things we had talked about previously - but YOU JUST DO NOT GIVE UP.  That's what I feel.  I was given up upon.  Yes there were things about him that bugged me - holding things in until they bubbled over for one - other things as well - but you do not give up.  You address the issue - if it does not take - you continue the communication - but you do not act like you are going to get over it or that it is status quo and you can learn to tolerate - you communicate - and if you can not do that, you need to fix it - and if you can not fix it that you ask for help whether from the person you supposedly love or friends or from a counselor - you don't stubbornly let pride prevent you from that - and if you think that it says something about your character because you had to ask for help - you are quite mistaken - if anything it demonstrates a lack there of - a lack of a willingness to grow and to change and nurture the relationship.  

I am by no means a perfect man in any sense of the word - but goddamn it I tried.  I tried my damnedest to overcome things - things that were not that bad.  I was able to emerge quite a bit the better because I was able to find an outlet not just in friends but in others.  And until that realization occurs - happiness - meaning happiness through the love of another is something that may beyond your reach.

I was willing to go to the moon and back.  I accept responsibility for my flaws and I am still growing and changing as a person - I am far from perfect but when someone offers to go the distance you don't give up because the means of taking you there is taking to long to complete or because a part is missing.

And while I am no where near ready for anything new - I need to go forward and finish what I started.

And I can't help but feel pity and sorrow along with the void and the other emotions - because you gave up - and maybe I am misinterpretting but given what I was given it's the only conclusion I can come too.  And if I am wrong so be it, but if the reasons demonstrate the expectations despite the honesty and openness, than I can only see short-term satisfaction and long term disappointment.  As I said - I could very well be wrong but I don't think so.

The rest is silence."

"event","Madonna Abandons Movie Career
Madonna has begrudgingly turned her back on her movie career, because she is convinced the media is hell bent on ensuring her film projects are flops. The singer was lauded for her performance in the big screen adaptation of the musical Evita, but she has suffered a string of flops, most notably Body Of Evidence and Swept Away, her last movie role directed by husband Guy Ritchie, which failed to secure a cinema release. And the 47-year-old, who is currently in the midst of her Confessions world tour, will concentrate solely on her music career from now on. She says, ""I hate to admit it, but I've decided to give that up. How can any film survive if everyone says it's going to be a flop from the very day the project is even conceived? It's already dead in the water."""

Source: Variety
June 23, 2006


Comedy Central has resurrected the former Fox series Futurama, ordering 13 episodes to debut in 2008. The deal builds upon the cable channel's acquisition of the 72-episode library last fall.

Discussions about a revival of the half-hour began in earnest earlier this year between Futurama producer 20th Century Fox Television and series creators Matt Groening and David X. Cohen.

Actors Billy West, Katey Sagal and John DiMaggio are onboard for the new episodes that will continue the story of the pizza delivery boy, accidentally frozen for 1,000 years, who wakes up in the future.

Futurama has traveled a course similar to that of animated series Family Guy, which also was cancelled and later brought back after DVD releases and off-network repeats grew a new fanbase."

But between between these two magazines,it got me thinking.  in a fairly recent poster start bitching about a the marriage amendment that was before Congress just hanging because I had to go to my sister's and Colin's and never got to it.so I might as well use the time while I am frustrated, just to get all of this out there.  it can not only the fact that gay marriage comes up during midterm in presidential election years, or the fact that these elected representatives claim that by passing such, they would be preserving the sanctity of marriage, or even the fact that one state will not recognize such unions that are legal in other states.

Lately I've been watching quite a few documentaries on the subject and have had my eyes open to quite a few things.  First off, it hardly needs to be stated that the term: ""sanctity of marriage"" is a farce.  The fact that the Republicans, conservatives moral majority, etc imply this whenever are the topic of gay marriage comes up, clearly demonstrates that they are so out of touch with the marriage rate and divorce rate in this country and that only demonstrates how out of touch they are with more pressing issues.  These people are acting like the very foundations of society are going to collapse, because you know, the war in Iraq is not doing that.  I know my friend Ed in Rhode Island and probably have the other friends there would probably have words for what I'm about to say, but some of these issues are just ridiculous.  I completely agree with the fact that this is a civil rights issue, and any such proposed marriage amendment would be the first in the United States constitutional history that would write into the Constitution but there are some activists who are taking the issue a bit too far.  I'll come back to this.

What really irritates me to no end is that once the civil unions and domestic partnerships are allowed, some people feel that it's enough.  It's a step in the right direction.  However,there are roughly 1049 federal laws that protect married couples, in most cases.  There are roughly 15 to 40 protecting civil unions and domestic partnerships.  Does anyone else not find this outrageous?  When Colin and I do have our commitment ceremony, it is probably going to cost us more in lawyer fees then to actually pay for the ceremony itself.  This is because we will have to get a lawyer to insure that the rights that married couples at under federal law and state law, For that matter, are protected.  An example: my friend Angela is getting married in October, and once she gets her marriage licenseshe does not have to worry about losing property should Rick die, collecting his Social Security, whether or not she will be able to visit him in the hospital, family leave, pension, taxes and a myriad of other things.  All because of a marriage license.  Should for whatever reason Angela and Rick not be able to have children the option to adopt will be far smoother for them than for Colin and I.  Should they divorce, which I'm not hoping, but just using as an example, they won't have the same kinds of custody issues that face gay couples.

Having spent the better part of last week watching C-SPAN 2, in watching these debates on the marriage amendment.  It was like watchinga model of how crappy our education system is.  One senator stated that marriage drew its origination from property rights, etc., which is true.  A different Senator, who I believe, probably has a learning disorder of some sort, implied that marriage was as old as man.  You cannot possibly tell me that this issue has nothing to do with religion or elections.  I think if you tried to tell me that religion played no role in this argument, it would take a great deal of restrain on my part to prevent myself from bitch slapping you.  another argument was a demonstration using fancy charts, graphs, and other illustrations (paid for by you and I) to show that since gay marriage has been allowed in certain European countries, the heterosexual marriage rate has declined.  The fact that this particular argument came from a Republican senator is what makes it so preposterous.  I recal during the presidential election of 2004, certain Republican officials declared that because Europe was doing something did not necessarily mean, we had to follow suit, we are our own nation, and basically implied that we are going to do what ever the hell we want whether other nations approve or not.  But we'll use Europe as an example for the marriage amendment...and that's not hypocritical?

Just some statistics for you: this is from the CDC's website showing statistics for 2004:
Number of marriages: 2,279,000

Marriage rate: 7.8 per 1,000 total population

Divorce rate: 3.7 per 1,000 population (46 reporting States and D.C.)

From the US Census website:

In 2002: 
11.7 per 1000 of the population, aged 15-64, married.  6.0 obtained divorces.

This tells me that the divorce rate is roughly 50%.  Now, if there is sanctity in marriage, shouldn't that number be much lower?  it's amazing how much we are willing to use the Bible as a defense against gay marriage, yet we don't use it in the case of divorce.  Given that my encounters with Christians have usually been of the fundamentalist or at least conservative variety, I find it mighty convenient, that they are able to pick and choose what they are going to follow from the Bible and what they aren't.  They have no problems quoting Leviticus, when the topic of homosexuality comes up, but when you bring all the notion that eating pork, selling a child into slavery, the proper procedure for dealing with someone who works on Sunday or the Sabbath, the fact that they're wearing clothing and dismayed of polyester, and that it will condemn them to hell (as it rightly should), the fact that a majority of the meat products, that they purchased you not have all the blood drained from them, the notion of ritual sacrifice and or cleansing prior to attending church, the fact that every time their wife has her period they should go out and get a new bed, because it's impure, and numerous other transgressions, I am told that these things are null and void because the covenant with Jesus, apparently was some sort of giant 'VOID' stamp and most of the Old Testament.  It seems to me that these types view religion is a very large, either buffet, where you can pick and choose what is going to go on your plate, or a kind of ""Build-A-Bear"" workshop, where we go through an assembly-type line and pick out which dogma and doctrine, we are going to follow and call it a religion.  that's not religion.  that's not even what Jesus intended to be of religion.  It's a giant buffet of hate.  

To get back to those activists are quite feel are taking issue a bit too far, it's my understanding that there is a case in Massachusetts, in which a couple wants to have birth certificates changed from ""mother"" and ""father"" to ""Parent A"" and ""Parent B.""  That is ridiculous!    If there are two mothers, change it to mother and mother, and if there are two fathers, the same applies.  I highly doubt, couple is going to have their child refer to them as parent A and parent B.  This is not helping the cause of gay marriage or gay rights but hindering it.

Once I've read the Senate transcripts, and I will, since I have two weeks at least, where I will not be online following my surgery.  I'm sure I will have a great deal more to say on the topic."

 Marshall & Zeta-Jones Reuniting for Gypsy?
Source: New York Post
June 13, 2006


Liz Smith at the New York Post reports the unconfirmed news that Chicago director Rob Marshall and star Catherine Zeta-Jones will reteam for an adaptation of Steve Sondheim's Broadway musical Gypsy for The Weinstein Company:

Now the rumor is out and hot that the Weinstein Company is close on the heels of director Rob Marshall for a movie version of the show about the evolution of that famous stripper - Gypsy Rose Lee - and her infamous stage mother, Rose. This incredible ""best damn show I've seen in years!"" (courtesy of New York Times critic Walter Kerr) opened to acclaim in 1959 with Broadway's hit-making powerhouse, Ethel Merman, in the role of Mama Rose. The Arthur Laurents ""book"" with Jule Styne music and Sondheim's lyrics has been revived over and over, usually successfully, with such as Angela Lansbury and Tyne Daly playing the part. Hollywood made a botch of it back in 1962 when they put the sleek Rosalind Russell in the role. (The only saving grace of this version was the delicious Natalie Wood as Gypsy.)

I don't know how I feel about Catherine Zeta-Jones for Mama Rose.  I love her as an actress but I don't know about comedy.

 Burton Turns Attention to Sweeney Todd
Source: Variety
June 13, 2006


Paramount Pictures has postponed its Tim Burton-directed Ripley's Believe It or Not and Burton will now turn his attention to Sweeney Todd, an adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical developed by DreamWorks Pictures. Johnny Depp is attached to reteam with Burton for ""Todd.""

Variety says that ""Ripley's"" had been earmarked for a November start with Jim Carrey as the titular explorer-newspaper columnist. But Paramount has delayed the start of production on that film for at least one year, applying the brakes because of a budget that was north of $150 million and because Carrey and Burton wanted to make significant creative changes.

While ""Ripley's"" is the second Carrey vehicle to stall in recent weeks (Used Guys was dropped by Fox when its budget came in at $112 million), Paramount says they still want to make the film.

""It's the completely opposite situation,"" Paramount's co-president of production Brad Weston said. ""We intend to make the movie with Tim and Jim, and the fact they are meeting later this week to continue working on the script shows our intent to go forward. We wanted to get to the right place creatively and financially, and through our relationship with DreamWorks, this picture switch was made easy and seamless.""

Carrey and Burton had ideas to change the script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski in ways significant enough to require rewrites by those screenwriters and a re-thinking of the f/x budget. The result would change the emphasis from Ripley to some of the wonders he uncovered for his ""Believe It or Not"" column.

Carrey will likely make another comedy while he, Burton and Paramount continue to work, in hopes they can meet up in China in fall 2007.

Ok...I love the idea of Burton doing this...its right up his ally.  However...and don't get me wrong...I am open-minded to this...but Depp?  He would be perfect for the role because he has the ability to play this deep and dark characters...but the questions remains as to whether it will be a musical or not.  I know it says Sondheim...but this is not a typical musical...its more of an opera because of the insane ranges and demand on the actors.  I would be interested to see how this plays out and who gets cast...I don't expect LuPone or any of the others who have recently played...perhaps Neil Patrick Harris and Audra MacDonald for the secondary characters but can't imagine any females for the leads...could be wrong...we'll see."

"event","Got my surgery info.  Surgery is going to be July 5 at 6am.  Pretty much going to be very restricted after for the two weeks after that.  Sitting is not recommended for more than 20 minutes.  Lots of other stuff.

Just found out that we may be soon seeing a full movie screen version of Sunset Boulevard with Glenn Close!  Either Hugh Jackman or Ewan MacGregor are being considered for Joe Gillis.  Just to warn you all: If this is made into a motion picture there will be no living with me for months...also...if this is NOT made into a motion picture there will be no living with me for months.  As long as Madonna does not show up or some other terrible casting we will be good.  


Side note...Tony's are tomorrow...I am going to laugh my ass off if Patti LuPone wins for Sweeney Todd and Glenn Close is the presenter."

"event","So I woke up to CSpan 2.  I am taking notes.  This gay marriage debate is ridiculous.  
ridiculous

adj 1: inspiring scornful pity; ""how silly an ardent and unsuccessful wooer can be especially if he is getting on in years""- Dashiell Hammett [syn: pathetic, silly] 2: completely devoid of wisdom or good sense; ""the absurd excuse that the dog ate his homework""; ""that's a cockeyed idea""; ""ask a nonsensical question and get a nonsensical answer""; ""a contribution so small as to be laughable""; ""it is ludicrous to call a cottage a mansion""; ""a preposterous attempt to turn back the pages of history""; ""her conceited assumption of universal interest in her rather dull children was ridiculous"" [syn: absurd, cockeyed, derisory, idiotic, laughable, ludicrous, nonsensical, preposterous] 3: broadly or extravagantly humorous; resembling farce; ""the wild farcical exuberance of a clown""; ""ludicrous green hair"" [syn: farcical, ludicrous]

So far I have heard Senators Brownbeck, Allard, and Santorum (all R - KA, CO, PA).  Their arguements all center around out of wedlock births in Nordic countries, the chain reaction of the repealment of the sodomy cases, and activist judges.  I am currently listening to Senators Reid and Durbin D NE and IL who are currently putting on a Vaudeville-esque debate stating that this is 33rd on the list of issues the American people want to talk about.  I find it funny that the Republicans who bitch about how we need to be our own country and refuse to follow the examples or opinions of the world community are now using them as an example.  

Also by this activist judges argument, are they not basically calling all civil rights decisions made by the courts, done so by activist judges?  Thus by this arguement, are we not saying that the civil rights issues of the 60s made by activist judges?  I will have more on this issue later."

"event","Right now I am at my wit's end.  I have 3 more exams.  There Colin's illness.  And of course my mother.  I am really going tired of this.  Every year its something different.  Last year it was parkinson's...the year before something neurological.  Now I am not one without compassion however...what amazes me is that they always happen either when we are fighting or when I have exams or something else.  I am really just tired of fighting and being the one to compromise and be forgiving and having to be the adult.  She has sarcoidosis.  Google it.  It's terminal in 5-10% of the cases.  I could sit here and record every single message that has been left on my machine but why waste my time.  Right now its not a matter of having everything hit me all at once.  But I am damn tired of having to be the adult with this woman.  And why should I?  Where is the mother that I needed when the going got tough for me?

Just once....just once...I would like to have that connection.  And the sad thing is that I know it's not going to happen.  Every single fucking time this woman gets something everyone has to go into crisis mode because she has it so goddamn worse off than everyone else!  

I know I probably should not be complaining because I know that there are people who are far far worse than I.  However.  I can handle the pressure from exams.  I can handle a lot of things.  But right now I feel like my conscience is being chipped away because of this woman.

One moment I am only 27 and have no idea what I am talking about.  The next moment I am needed because my emotional support is required.  Last I checked I was not a parent...neither through planning, accident or proxy and yet is this what is expected of me?  

And when does the ""moral high road"" become so blurred with the easy path that you can not tell the difference.  Neither path is easy.  What are my options?  I can either acquiesce and be the ""bigger person"" and give this woman a call or I can ignore the calls completly or I can wait to see if this is fatal.  No matter which choice I make I can not win.  If I acquiesce is just me buckling.  If I ignore her completly then I have to deal with it for the rest of my life.  If I wait to find out how serious this is, I risk getting accused of wanting a share of the will...which is what I will be accused of, despite the fact that the woman has no assets nor does she have anything that I could possibily desire.  I am happy with what I have and who I am with.  Other things will come with time, life and love.  

I really don't know what to do.  I am taking my medications and going to sleep for the night and probably unplug the phone tomorrow so I don't have to deal with these phone calls and actually study with a clear head.  

I am going to stop now before I say something that I regret.  However, to the person that I have been repeatedly calling but who can not even take a minute out of his day to let people know that he is alive...thanks so much for being there.  It only takes a minute to say yeah I am here but going through some shit or can't talk I am busy or I am mad at you and this is why.   Thanks."

"event","Ok...the subject is appropos.  You know how in every Rogers and Hammerstein musical (yeah I can't believe I am talking about them either) there is a dream ballet that occurs at a pivotal moment in the show to convey some sort of message to a character who just isn't getting it.  And as we watch the play or the movie, we all mumble or yell, depending whether we are watching the movie at home or in the theatre, not another dream ballet.  (Except Carousel which was nice)  Well last night I fell asleep watching Boston Legal (YES YES I KNOW I KNOW...I was watching it on the DVR at like 1am while I was studying).  I had my dream ballet.  

Now lets not all get ourselves into a ruckus.  It was weird.  Yes there was music...and I don't quite know from what...lots of orchestrations.  (Ironically no...I did not take my meds before falling asleep)  I was in Florida.  Just me.  I was looking for someone.  I went to the address.  The house was similar to the kind in Ragtime (or as was featured on last night's Gilmore Girls).  As I knocked, an old woman who looked remarkably like Eva Marie Saint, I will get to that in a moment, answered.  I asked if he was there.  She said that he had gone looking for some child who had disappeared.  So now I am totally confused and go sloughing about whatever area in Florida I was in.  I was walking around Florida a lot...like Jesus walking...I know it was florida because there were alligators and Angela Frost.  I told Angela that while I would love to visit with her, I was looking for him and if her fiance could help with his cop connections, I would appreciate it.  She said that she had to go to work...and in an exit that only Angela could make, sang something eerie as she jette'd off stage wearing a poodle skirt and bobby socks. (you have to really know Angela to understand that)   Oh and she was throwing roses.  (How I managed to stay asleep and not wake up laughing is really beyond me.)  So I continued.  I went back to the house with the Eva Marie Saint clone and asked if he was back yet because I just needed him.  This time around Ms. Saint was much more accomodating and invited me into her home offering me tea.  I asked her where he was and why he was doing this when I needed him so bad.  She said that he was still looking for the child but I might find him at work.  So I finished my tea...thanked her and gave her a number.  I told her before I departed that if he should return to contact this number and that she would know how to get a hold of me and I handed her a yellow card.  (Shut up!  I know who the card symbolizes and its damn funny that my subconcious works like that.  For those of you who need a synopsis the card clearly symbolizes annie.)  So I keep going.  I extinguished my last cigarrette and realized I was out.  So I went to this conveniece store.  In the store was a DDR setup and playing it was Dan...but with short hair.  Dan was playing.  The character on the screen was Lisa who was yelling at him for having cut his hair...and this is where it gets even stranger...the pad starting yelling and screaming.  I asked Dan to move.  And the dancing Lisa in the game looked at me and said he is so close but to be careful where I stepped.  I looked down at the pad and it had two 'O' buttons rather than the usual one.  Well the 'O' buttons were where the right and left arrows should be and took up the entire area their entire square.  I stepped on the pad and heard 'Get the fuck off me!' So stepped back and looked and Calabrese's face emerged...which now explains the positioning and size of the large 'O' buttons.  I told her to stop whining and that this was why she threw her back out.  She responded ""I am not going to tell you where he is now because you are being a c*nt.""  I told her that she better.  She responded by telling me 'Fuck off.'  So I grabbed the back bar and used it as a brace hoisted myself as I high as I could, and which point Lisa said ""Oh shit...he is going to do it"" and hid under the DJ booth in the game, and I lept down on the two 'O' buttons with all my might.  DDR Pad Calabrese let out a series of explatives that I will not repeat here and told me to get 'My fuckin cigarettes and I will be close and that I did not return with some nice drugs for the pain I had caused her and deposit them in her coin slot (ew) I would live to regret it.  So I went to the counter and Juan and Diego were at the counter.  Diego handed me some cherry bombs and I said no thanks but said that I would need them.  Juan gave me a pack 'on the house' as well as some oxycontin telling me to 'Put them in the slot because he was getting a headache from the bitch machine' and then proceeded to yell at Diego in Spanish.  So I went back over and Dan was looking morose and told me that the machine kept shooting the quarters at him and I looked at the screen and Lisa was coughing saying that she was smoking too much.  So I leaned over and put the oxycontin in the slot (again ew) and Andrea let out a sigh of releif, stepped out of the pad, told me to go to the end of the counter by the deli, lit an extremely long cigarette and left.  So I go to the end of the counter...now its like film noir meets the dream ballet because everything is all black and white and shadowy.  There was a neon sign that I could not quite make out.  As I got to the figure hunched over the counter he looked up.  I looked at him with contempt in my voice and said ""What the fuck are you doing here?  I have been looking for you!  You told me that you would be there if I needed you.  This is not work!""  Glenn looked horrified that I had found him and said ""I am at work...just taking my lunch.  And what the fuck does it matter to you.  Since when do you care?""  I then asked him more and more questions...becoming more and more enraged because he stopped answering.  I picked him up by his shirt with both hands, shaking him like a ragdoll and he just laughed and told me that I was looking for the wrong person and was completely wrong.

I woke up.

WHAT


THE 



FUCK




I had some nice seasoned tillipia and macaroni salad for dinner at about 830.  Some Salt and Vinegar chips for a snack.  And as I said I did not take my meds before sleep.  

The only sense I can make out of Eva Marie Saint is that I had watched the new superman returns trailer last night.  Seriously...what the fuck."

"event","So today is Colin's birthday.  I spent most of yesterday cleaning cause he and his friends came over.  Actually it got me to do most of the cleaning that I had intended to do over Spring Break so things are in order here for at least the next 3-5 days.  I finished probably about 5-10 minutes before he got here.  In the process broke 2 lightbulbs and the nice little naked man in the barrel who's penis pops up when you remove the barrel (it's from Jessica...we don't ask anymore).  So we hung out with Kim and then Nikki and her boyfriend.  Naturally because I cleaned, drinks were spilled, which was really funny because of the way Kim was sitting.  The ended up going out around 11.  His friends got him these really nice hats.  (He asked for hats for when he shaves his head.)  I need to get one.
After they left I went back to my homework and ate a late dinner.  I had Chinese.  The delivery man made me nervous though.  While he was not white (call me old fashioned or whatever...but when I order Chinese I expect an Asian...not an old, creepy white guy).  Anyways.  While this guy was not white, he was keen to point out my rather rubenesque cat, Francesca, who was lollygagging on the couch.  After scarfing down my delicious ""Chinese fast food"" I continued reading ""Son of the Moment.""  Probably around 1:30 I started to get tired so looked through the guide for something to fall asleep to.  (Colin forgot his keys so temporarily falling asleep on the couch ensures I hear the door.)  So I am looking at the guide in wonderment thinking ""wow I must be tired...I did not check 3am...I want 2am.  After going back and forth for about 5 minutes, like a retard, I realized that one of my favorite seasons had ended: daily savings time.  
I woke up this morning around 9:30 to a wonderful new experience, my left leg was numb.  I will bring this up with the doctor when I see him.  My shoulders going numb was one thing because they have been acting up, and after pain, numbness follows...but this is not the first time the leg has gone numb so I am a tad bit concerned.

This week has been a very interesting week.
Monday I had lunch with Lori, my anthro TA and now friend, from Cultural Anthro.  We chatted about the various things going on with school and life.  As we sat outside enjoying the warm weather, she mentioned that she talked to Dr. Tedlock, our advisor, about getting help working on her PhD research.  The problem she is encountering is finding enough time to transcribe all of her interviews coupled with research, classes, and TAing.  Apparently in the course of her conversation she mentioned asking a student to help her in exchange for Independent Study credit...according to her, Dr. Tedlock immediately brought me up.  She said that while she thought it was a fantastic idea, she would have to check with me because of my medical problems.  Well I lept on that.  I said I was most definately interested and that with the transcription, I have the voice software.  Well she then pulled out her recorder, and it's digital!  She said she would talk to Dr. Tedlock and let me know.  Now my line of thinking throughout all of this was, ""How many people get the chance to work on an independent with a PhD candidate and have their advisor recommend you, an undergrad, to help them?""  I was thinking about doing an independent study anyway, but this is fantastic.  Later when I got home, there was an email waiting for me from Lori saying that Dr. Tedlock thought this was fantastic and would sign off on everything.  While we will be working on this over the summer, it would not count until the Fall because she is not here during the summer.  Lori sent me all the paperwork, her proposal and a link to a site.  I had to go through the site and take a 2 hour course on research ethics in order to become certified to help her.  The next step is getting the paperwork signed off on as well as seeing if I can use this independent study to fulfill my practicum requirement and kill two birds with one stone.  Also Dr. Tedlock assigned some reading by authors like Foucault and Alal.  The nice thing about this is, because, in theory, I will be having my permanent spinal cord stimulator put in, I will have nothing to do for 30days.  Doing this will help me break up the day a little.

Tuesday I boycotted APY 421 because I hate the teacher and, much like Salome, want his head brought to me on a silver tray.  The guy is a brilliant lecturer but has no people skills.  When we found out about Colin, I did the responsible thing (in my opinion) and told teachers almost immediately.  He did not want to hear it.  I have tried to meet him for office hours and he blows me off. He leaves no feedback on exams nor does he give you the question sheet so you have no idea what you did wrong.  Over Spring Break, I did work study in the Anthro dept.  Now despite my contempt for this man, I was still pleasant.  After the that, which was just met with a good morning, he now sneaks in through the back.  Anyway, on Tuesday I had gone to the Anthro dept and ran into a teacher.  We talked briefly and then they told me to join them for a walk and coffee.  During the walk, this person told me that they had heard of my issues with this teacher.  Apparently, I am not the only one who had complained.  Most if not all the grad students this professor has, have had similar complaints.  Since the beginning of this semester, this professor has become increasingly more paranoid, thinking that either he is being followed or watched.  (Now this could be a cultural thing considering where he came from.)  And while the course he is offering in the fall is very interesting, several individuals have told me that if I am having this problems now, not to bother taking another course with him.  One of the hats that Colin got yesterday looks like the hats that Chairman Mao and most of China wore during the Cultural Revolution.  (For an idea of what I am talking about look up the book ""Mao"" by Jung Chang)  Now seeing as when I feel wronged I like to set things right, and this man seems to be going slowly insane...would it be wrong of me to get one these hats and have a red star put on it and wear it to class?
   
Wednesday I met with Dr. McGuire for some course advise as well as what to do for the summer.  He told me that I should register for both sessions and then I can drop when I get a surgery date and add later on.  I also brought up my issue with the aforementioned unnamed professor (I learned my lesson about naming names negatively here since a higher up came across this and discovered the lovely things I had to say about a certain person in capen.), and he said not only should I not take the course but either meet with the head of undergrad studies in anthro or the head of the dept.  My only concern is that since Attendance in 25% of the grade that, despite doing well in the course, I will lose points, despite having both a note from Office of Disability services, proof re: the situation that arose in February, and a not from my doctor.  The other thing that makes me wonder is that 3/4 of the class has only shown up for the review session and the midterm...so how is this going to affect them?  It's the double edged sword concept.  

Thursday I had a huge flair up so I was unable to attend my meeting with Dr. Tedlock.  And Friday was Friday.  

Saturday I registered for courses.  I will go into my schedule later when things are finalized...this is enough for now."

To the Divine Miss Lisa:

Tis a sad sad day when Calabresian logic must step in for drama-fixin.  You my dear are forgetting the big picture here.  There is rules.  The rule that supersedes everything is

CANCER TRUMPS ALL

Now I am mighty fucked off here that La Calabrese has stepped totally out of character & done something nice for somebody & you missy have to step in & fuck it all up being petty & childish about it acuz you were not consulted or included in said niceness.

If this is all you have to worry about, then you so need to get a fucking life.  Oh & get down on your knees thanking whatever supreme being you choose than you & Dan are not walking a mile in the shoes of Charlie & Colin.  Stop being a silly wench & creating drama that is a blip on the radar compared to such things.  The nice Asian was not here to multitask & network.  She was here to support the lads in their travail.  You ain't got no travail.  And you ain't likely to get no support if you ever get any travail with such an attitude.  There is more important things than being ignored.  Go ask Colin if you do not believe me.  That is all.

"event","In regards to the previous post...it was not meant to exclude, offend, or anything else.  It was actually meant to be private...of which I have been making more of lately rather than writing things by hand...you know an actual journal or diary.  I just did not mark it as such because of various distractions.  I am not going to go and make it Private now as though it did not happen nor am I going to make excuses as to why I did not tell all of you.  

Truth be told I have learned a lot over the past month by my own actions and by the events that have transpired.  I spent a lot of time isolating myself from most of my close friends and family either by not answering the phone or by signing on to put up an away message saying to leave me alone.  It was hell.  Maybe not the best decision I have made but not the worst either.  I needed the time.  Over the last month I have lashed out angrily at friends, family and strangers.  While I am not above apologizing, I am not going to.  

This past month has been extremely hard not only having to accept a lot unexpected changes but changes in life.  The funny thing is, I realize that everyone is going through shit.  And everyone that I told about the sitation offered to help me out, to be support, and/or all said the same thing ""OMG.  I'm sorry.  Let me know if there is anything I can do.""  That for the most part was that.  

I have my sister pissed at me because I have not been calling. 
I have my mother and her family either pissed or perplexed because I did not call my mother the day she got her gallstones out.  
Glenn seems to be pissed about something...no idea at what or why.
A friend from here blew up at me when I messaged them to show an amusing remark.
I am sure that I will be hearing from Chris for not telling him what was going on or IMing him to tell him all of this, as though it was some sort of nouveaux gossip.
I am very sure Lisa is pissed because I did not make a huge todo about the past weekend or tell her and I refuse to make excuses or answers because there are none to give or make.


The truth of the matter is...I really just don't give a rat's ass what people think.  And if it means the end of friendships...so be it.  Very few people have actually followed up their words of support with action.  And you know what...it's not like I don't understand you all have things going on in your life that naturally take presidence...school...work...your own lives.  That's fine.  If something is going on where you are too busy, don't say you things like ""if there is anything I can do"" or offer support and then either take no action or say that you had things going on in your life.  That is what pisses me off to know end.  

There have been times when I have dropped things to help people out or lend an ear or adjust my schedule to accomodate...and haven't bitched.  There are times when people have done the same for me.  Reciprocity.  While it's not the only thing that defines a friendship, it is a component.  

Another lesson that I have learned that unless you specifically ask for something or tell people to come and swing by, even if both parties are sitting there staring at the wall saying nothing, people will not do anything.  Again...this is not to say that I am not simpathetic to the fact that everyone has their own lives...but I am not going to go out of my way anymore for a lot of people.  My away messages, as an example, have asked people to leave me alone and various ways, yet those that did not know, but who are regularly online, did not pick up the phone or stop by to check to make sure things were ok.  What does that leave me think?  Very few people give a damn.  I saw this in action at a former friend's funeral last year.  While there was bad blood that had happened between him and several other friends...I and one other went to the funeral.  Other than family, the only names we recognized from the guest book were our own...what does that say of loyalty and friendship?

And if I am whining...I don't care.  And if I am playing the martyr...I don't care.  As I said previously, I am only going to focus on a few aforementioned things.  If you have a problem with this take it up with me.  The other options, block me, stop talking to me...whatever.  

I am seeing someone at UB to talk to work through my issues, such as depression, so that I don't have to burden the one person who needs.  But I should not have to feel alone or isolated...and that is exactly what I feel.  But rather than sitting here feeling sorry for myself or waiting on knocks, rings or phonecalls that may never come...I am doing something about it.  

In the meantime...I offer this gift to who ever wants...a rat's ass...because that is exactly what I have to offer...and if you have a problem with that...then it is your problem to deal with...not mine."

"event","So this Saturday Andrea C. called me as I was starting to get some cleaning done to say that she if I was going to be home.  The only thing that was somewhat odd about her call was the time...before noon.  She said that she was headed downtown to visit ""Gary the Fag"" and wanted to drop off some books I loaned her...I really didn't think anything odd of this because he lives, to my understanding, a little over a mile away.  So I talked with Colin briefly and then went to Walgreens to get some cigs because a visit with her is never brief.  As I am coming back...I see her trundling up the path in front of the mansion and I see her accompanied.  

Now at first I thought she had petitioned one of the people in the building to help her but as I got closer I did a double take...IT WAS ANNIE.  So I walk up to them in complete and utter shock and simply say ""These are not books.""  We spent a while chatting and then went to Polish Villa for lunch.  Colin joined us and it was a nice meal.  The funny part was watching all the old Polish women staring at Annie as though she had just taken part in Pearl Habour.  We pretty much stayed in the entire weekend and just talked.  We rented movies, ate, had a glass of wine or two.  

All in all it was a nice weekend and a much needed mental break.  My problems, worries, concerns and drama just melted away...even if only for a weekend.  

Today we went to see my sister and the baby and then I took her to the airport.  

And now everything is here waiting for me.  I have a great deal to get done this week for class.  Tonight I am just going to rest."

"event","Alright.  I have spent the past week blowing up at people.  Yeah I have been moody all week because of the current situation and I think I have a right to be.  I went grocery shopping the other day and when I came home I was putting away groceries and decided to call my aunt.  Well, she starts laying into me about how I haven't called mom who had surgery on Monday.  I reminded her of what was going on here with Colin, and then updated her on him moving.  Well then I get the Jesus speech.  Oh that was it.  

Let me stop here for a moment.  

I talked to Erin after this and we both pretty much realized that if we were together and I were straight...we would both be getting all sorts of support from our families.  My mother's family DOES NOT CALL.  My sister has been great.  My mother has not been a nuisance.  But it would be nice to ACTUALLY HAVE MY FAMILY CHECK IN ONCE IN A WHILE.  FOR CHRISTSAKE I HAVE BEEN THERE THROUGH THICK AND THIN FOR EVERYONE ELSE.  These are the same people that profess how I need to go to Church more.  This proves the point I began nearly 10 years ago...friendship is thicker than blood.  

Now then.  I am sorry to anyone who feels isolated or left out.  (Not you MYLF)  And I am sorry that I have not been active in responding to livejournal posts or emails or anything else.  But as I told my aunt on the phone.  I AM GOING TO BE SELFISH AND WORRY ABOUT ME AND NOT EVERYONE ELSE.  

Not only am I am worried about certain things which are going on, and how things have changed so much, but I NEED TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING THINGS:
Colin
School
Friends and Immediate Family (which sometimes are the same)
and then anything else that comes along.

So, if you have been venting online and I have no responded or you have sent emails venting and I have not responded...think about the past month...and then understand.  

It's not that I don't care...but I need to focus on me.  This year is already shit.  

If anyone has a problem with this...tough shit...remove me from your friends list.  

In anycase...if I don't respond it probably just means that I am busy catching on schoolwork.  

Times like this really let you see the true colors of your friends.  And I really think I am done messaging people out of the blue that I don't talk to normally either and just cleaning out my buddylist.  Clearly if people wanted to stay in touch they would.  And others need just need to realize that they are not the only ones with shit on their plate.  I'm not trying to trivialize your problems but don't fuckin snap at me.  So far this year has gotten off to a shitty start for a lot of people I know.  Swallow hard, breath deep, cry your eyes out, and the DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM.  

And just so that no one get pissy because they think this is directed at them...get over yourselves...this is a rant in general and if you are taking this personal, then clearly something I said must apply.  

I am going to study now...I am just tired of people getting bent out of shape...especially when it's over stupid shit or you feel the need to take shit out on me because I happened be there."

"event","Alright...the neurostimulator trial went as well as it could...who knew that having an electric current coursing through your nerves could provide comfort.  Medtronic that's who.  The only thing about the trial that pissed me off is I really was not able to do a hell of a lot.  Everyone told me I would be able to carry on with normal activities the same day.  DOCTORS LIE.

I could barely shit!

I missed my Thurs, Fri and Monday classes.  I slept the first two days.  And I walked around as though I was a 85 year old hunchbacked arthritic woman.  And while it took the pain away from my arms and hands...my god did my back fuckin hurt.  

I told the doctor that we can go for the permanent device, which will be far less obtrusive.  The shining light for the weekend was Colin.  He took me to the surgerical center, did the housework, grocery shopping, bathed me (even the day Lisa said she would cover) and was just wonderful.  I really don't think I would have gotten through that weekend as smoothly if I did not have someone like him in my life.  

So Tuesday I tried to carry on with life.  I went to school early for books on the paper on the wall.  Only at 8in the morning could I get away with having the fabulous James Spader/Boston Legal moment.  So I am carrying the artbooks to my car and I see a Glenn-sized man coming toward me.  So Quasimodo my ass over to him and say ""You look like a strapping young lad!  Would you mind helping me carry these to my car as I have a slight case of the gimps""  Surprisingly I was not beat and he helped me.  Thursday comes along...I am feeling ok...I go to my classes...by the time Dr. Ludwig's class is over my shoulders are starting to kill and I starting to get numbness.  So I decide it's in my best interest to go home.  I came home and slept!  

The next morning I woke up and the experience in my shoulders can only be described as the feeling that I needed to constantly move them, with involuntary movement, with a knife.  So night comes...I am tired...I try to sleep.  Not so much...so I go to the medicine cabinet at 1am and take some Naproxin.  An hour...90 min...nothing...getting pissed.  So I have some hydrocodone left over from the hospital trip from 7/4 so I take one of those...by this point is approaching 5am and I am severly annoyed to the point that I getting ready to write a treatise to one of the phamaceutical companies.  I finally decide to do two shots of Jim Beame.  (Seeing as I am on a patch containing some fine opiates since dens are now illegal...drinking is not promoted)  I slept for about 3 hours.

Now why did we not go to the ER?  Because I would have had to sit there just to get hydrocodone which clearly wasn't working.  I am feeling marginally better but you know I am tired of this shit.  Colin took care of everything this weekend again.  Dad and Michelle brought me a cart for my school things which will help.  Tomorrow morning I am storming the Doctor's office with a firestorm of phonecalls.  I am sick of going through this shit every six months.  I don't sleep well as it is but this is getting old.  I am tired of bitching about it.  You are tired of hearing about it.  

Annie and Glenn...I still have not gotten to the post office to mail out your packages!  I will soon!  I promise...everything is wrapped and sitting boxes.  In anycase...I am off to bed...irritated again with this situation."

 Burton & Depp to Reteam for Sweeney Todd?
Source: MovieMusicals.net
January 7, 2006


MovieMusicals.net is reporting that director Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, who have teamed up five times already and most recently for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, will reunite once again for the adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical Sweeney Todd.

This would be the second time Burton will try to get the film made - his previous incarnation at Warner Bros. fell apart years ago. Since then, Jarhead director Sam Mendes has had talks to make the movie as well.

The site says that Depp will play the title character Sweeney Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street. Here is the official description:

The legendary barber, hell-bent on revenge, takes up with his enterprising neighbor in a delicious plot to slice their way through London's upper crust. Justice will be served - along with lush melody, audacious humor and bloody good thrills.

The musical premiered in 1979, when it won eight Tony Awards including Best Musical. The show is currently on Broadway in its second revival. You can learn more about the musical at the official website."

"event","So I was driving home from grandma's after my exam and I hear on NPR that the Patriot Act (or parts there of) are not going renewed!   HA!  you all know that HA that I do when I am right and my being eventually shines through.  Yeah that one...at the top of my lungs.  

Meanwhile the exam went well.  US HistoryI  : Multiple Choice, True/False, Timeline, Fill in the Blank (no word bank oooooooo) 2 essays

1st essay...Right about the all the compromises regarding slavery and why they fell apart leading to the Civil War.  Actual Line from my exam: ""So the Missouri Compromise passed and for the next 30 years, all the white people were happy...except....""

Then I did essay 2.  Twas very short.  I walk up hand it to my TA and say very loudly ""Essay 2 is crap""  they lost it as I walked out the door and lit a cigarrette.  

So far:
A - Cultural Anthropology  (Bonding with your teacher on Mormons earned major points  LOL)
A - Methods of Inquiry 
A- - Intro to Archaeology

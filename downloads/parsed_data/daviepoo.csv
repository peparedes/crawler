I have all the peices, and I realized that I thought something was missing from my life. The only thing that was missing was love. Love for myself that is. 



The rest of life is just details, this that and the other. Not important and no reason to get all in to a tizzy over. 

Count the good, and don't put the bad in the limelight

You all have homes
You all have friends
You all have your health (Granted it might not be the best)
You all have freedoms that MOST do not
You all have life


So be thankful.

I am waiting to ""drop my basket"" but I think with the positive frame of mind that I am, that things will continue to be this wonderful. 

No, my happy readers, I am not drunk, I am just truly happy. I have so much to be thankful for, and I am not about to focus my energies on those things that bring me pain, unhappiness, stress, or anger. I should instead focus on what is pure and magical on this Earth, and that is what I am doing, each day it gets a bit easier to let go, each day I get a bit stronger, each day I have thanks in my heart for the majestic nature of the cosmos.

I am thrilled that Spring is here, I am looking forward to carmalizing my skin and swimming as often as I can. I have also lost my mind and I am walking 2 miles a day.  Yes you read correctly the gay man is getting in shape. Not that I am fat, I actually realized I am down 2 pant sizes so I just need to do some defention. 

I have Mansfield on the mind today, which is unusual. Eh, you'll have this

A Farce at it's finest! Set in a Hospital where the chief of staff's motto is ""Laughter is the Best Medicine"" I have been helping with the play since Februrary. It is a great show and the kids have given 110% of their energy, spirits, and time. Its been such a delightful and eye opening experience for me, once performing on that stage, and now helping to direct a new generation of 'Aspiring Thespians."" It is so rewarding to watch the spark in their eyes, and for it all to come together. <br /><br /><br />Enough of me going on and on.

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/R/rosemckay/1114654048_esktopblue.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""BLUE""><br>BLUES are motivated by INTIMACY, seek opportunities
<br />to genuinely connect with others, and need to
<br />be appreciated. They do everything with
<br />quality and are devoted and loyal friends and
<br />employers/employees. Whatever or whomever
<br />they commit to are their sole (and soul)
<br />focus. They love to serve and will give
<br />freely of themselves in order to nurture
<br />others lives.

BLUES, however, do need to be understood. They have
<br />distinct preferences and occasionally the
<br />somewhat controlling (but always fair)
<br />personality of a confident leader. Their code
<br />of ethics is remarkably strong and they
<br />expect others to live honest, committed lives
<br />as well. They enjoy sharing meaningful
<br />moments in conversation as well as
<br />remembering special life events (i.e.,
<br />birthdays and anniversaries). BLUES are
<br />dependable, thoughtful, nurturing, and can
<br />also be self-righteous, a bit worry-prone,
<br />and emotionally intense. They are like
<br />sainted pit-bulls who never let go of
<br />something once they are committed. When you
<br />deal with a BLUE, be sincere, make an effort
<br />to truly understand them, and truly
<br />appreciate them.

When the rain is blowing in your face 
And the whole world is on your case 
I could offer you a warm embrace 
To make you feel my love 

When evening shadows and the stars appear 
And there is no one to dry your tears 
I could hold you for a million years 
To make you fell my love 

I know you haven't made your mind up yet 
And I would never do you wrong 
I've known it from the moment that we met 
There's not doubt in my mind where you belong 

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue 
I'd go crawling down the avenue 
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do 
To make you feel my love 

The storms are raging on a rolling sea 
And on the highway of regret 
The winds of change are blowing wild and free 
You ain't seen nothin' like me yet 


Got This For you

 
I went to work for her that summer 
A teenage kid so far from home 
She was a lonely widow woman 
Hell-bent to make it on her own 
We were a thousand miles from nowhere 
Wheat fields as far as I could see 
Both needing something from each other 
Not knowing yet what that might be 

'Til she came to me one evening 
Hot cup of coffee and a smile 
In a dress that I was certain 
She hadn't worn in quite a while 
There was a difference in her laughter 
There was a softness in her eyes 
And on the air there was a hunger 
Even a boy could recognize 

She had a need to feel the thunder 
To chase the lightning from the sky 
To watch a storm with all its wonder 
Written in her lover's eyes 
She had to ride the heat of passion 
Like a comet burning bright 
Rushing headlong in the wind 
Now where only dreams have been 
Burning both ends of the night 

That summer wind was all around me 
Nothing between us but the night 
When I told her that I'd never 
She softly whispered that's alright 
And then I watched her hands of leather 
Turn to velvet in a touch 
There's never been a summer 
When I have ever learned so much 

We had a need to feel the thunder 
To chase the lightning from the sky 
To watch a storm with all its wonder 
Written in her lover's eyes 
She had to ride the heat of passion 
Like a comet burning bright 
Rushing headlong in the wind 
Now where only dreams have been 
Burning both ends of the night 

I often think about that summer 
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace 
And I have rarely held another 
When I haven't seen her face 
And every time I pass a wheat field 
And watch it dancing with the wind 
Although I know it isn't real 
I just can't help but feel 
Her hungry arms again 

She had a need to feel the thunder 
To chase the lightning from the sky 
To watch a storm with all its wonder 
Written in her lover's eyes 
She had to ride the heat of passion 
Like a comet burning bright 
Rushing headlong in the wind 
Now where only dreams have been 
Burning both ends of the night 

Rushing in long in the wind 
Now where only dreams have been 
Burnin' both ends of the night 



There and nothin' that I wouldn't do 
Go to the ends of the earth for you 
Make you happy make your dreams come true 
To make you feel my love"

<P>As they pointed the Jag towards the West the sky was dark and foreboding as the two began their travels to the City of Brotherly Love, it was a complete blanket of gray wool with an orange spill near the center. It was a kind of sky that can warn of rocky travels or of the true beauty of nature. The two settled in to normal travel banter, how was your day, how was work, families etc. Neither of them cared about the answers but enjoyed the relief from the silence.

Marcus told a story about 2 of the seminarians who would constantly quote cardinal law, and how Marcus would put them in their place by saying ""They're french fries, not doctrine."" Daniel reminded Marcus about the lack of tonic water for G&amp;T's so they headed over to the grocery to pick some up. Well the two could not resist the freshly made humus, the Brie, or the delightful multi grain crackers; their knees grew week after encountering the Double Chocolate Mini Milanos. Fifty dollars latter they climbed back in the Jag and headed south. <BR>They discussed their plans for New Year's, how each had missed the others company. They arrived in Philly as the moon was cresting over the star filled sky. After a difficult check in, lost reservations prices misquoted, they packed a luggage cart and headed to their modest room. Of course the first order of business was cocktails. Marcus mixed two raspberry Martinis and lit two Marb Lights. Daniel toasted to "" A New Year with New Beginnings."" Marcus' eyes caught Daniel's, as if to say ''I am ready for a new beginning, I am ready to start again."" The old friends, and occasionally lovers sipped Martinis and inspected the room. There was a hole in the ceiling, a patch of carpet gone and grimy concrete in it's place, half of the television stations were missing (including Lifetime: Television for Women and Gay Men who Love the Golden Girls), and they were both appalled by the used condom found behind the mattress. Daniel shrieked one of his high prissy screams, and Marcus' just laughed. Was it that Marcus' was laughing at Daniel's reaction or was he laughing at Daniel? Marcus' had often called Daniel, Mary or the Queen Mary, out of playful affection. Daniel never knew if he was being cruel or was just poking fun, he always hoped it was the latter. They both sprawled out on the King Sized bed, and flipped on the TV. Daniel of course had the controller. Daniel was the type of man that if he wasn't in control of every situation then he felt inadequate and sheepish. Hence, why his relationship with Marcus was so difficult. Daniel had no control. They both agreed upon watching Jack Nicklson be a complete ass hole in As Good As it Gets. They settled in both curled up on the large bed, with a healthy margin of air between them. They both turned their heads when the gay man gets robbed and beaten nearly to death. Commenting on how cold and unforgiving the world could be. They continued to watch the story unfold. Marcus told Daniel how if he ever had to sleep with a woman it would be Helen Hunt. Daniel valiantly tried to think of an actress that he would invite in to his bed, but of course couldn't Daniel had known for 10 years that he was gay and couldn't possibly think of a woman that he could actually enjoy intercourse with. Daniel eyed the Christmas Presents across the room. His thoughtfully wrapped in a large Silver Metallic Green gift bag with coordinating tissue paper in shades of olive, mint, hunter, and forest. Daniel was more interested in the small bag with the insane Santa in it. This was what Marcus' had bought Daniel for Christmas, this would be the present he wanted most to open since the Twenty-Fifth. The fiends didn't share Christmas, both being with their own families. Daniel spent a few moments during the day thinking of Marcus, wondering what he was doing, if he was enjoying his day, and wondering if Marcus was thinking of him. They sat on the bed cross legged and began to rip through their packages. <BR>""Marcus what in the Gay Hell is this God Awful Japanese looking Santa Claus?""<BR>""I had to find you the most ugly, tacky, hideous Christmas novelty I could find.""<BR>""Where did you find it?""<BR>""Neiman Marcus, no you ass I got it at the Dollar Store.""<BR>Daniel laughed his deep soulful laugh. Marcus just smiled. Marcus started in on many of the heavy items in his bag. Daniel had found him old antique books on religion, politics, and a very old edition of The Divine Comedy. Marcus was thrilled and generally touched by the deep thought of each book. Daniel was tearing through the small festive wrapped boxes. Daniel of course asked if Marcus had wrapped them, to which he gave him his best stare of ""duh."" Daniel opened the first to find it a small flask, they both loved to drink together and apart. The flask was inscribed with one simple word: ""Gin."" In Daniel's bag there were another 5 flasks, rum, vodka, bourbon, scotch, and whisky. He was thrilled. His eyes lit up while opening each one. Yeah they were cheap flasks made in some sweat shop in Thailand or India, but he didn't care. It was something that Daniel could physically hold in his hand, and each time he used it he would think of Marcus.

"event","This was fuuny New Year's Resolutions from 2004... Hillarious 


New Year's Resolutions 
Here are Some Possible New Year's Resolutions
New Year's Resolutions:
Men are Assholes and they needed to be wiped out of our lives ;0) 

Less Coccaine...It's really getting exspensive. Jesus my bills are piling up and my Nose is as Red as Rudolph's... Hmm Perhaps Rudolph is doing coccaine too. In fact it is my belief that anyone that has a red nose is doing coccaine. Or anyone with an IQ over 130.

See Jackie More often... As often as possible... perhaps have a picture tattoo'd on to my thigh of her. SO everytime I am touching myself down there... I mean putting on pants... I can see her

Stop using (....) to pepper my thoughts.... wait.... nevermind

Be Nice to People... Ha Ha Ha Fucking No. 

Drink Less. Ok Me drinking less is never going to happen. That's like me swearing off of cock. Again not happening, it's a nice thought and theroy but not going to occur. 

Care less for those that don't care for me, or care about my feelings. 

David the Doormat is going to be David the Something else... Perhaps David the Blender or David the Ronco Electric Food Dehydrator.

Tell more funny jokes or comments such as: If you Raped a Prostitute wouldn't it be like shoplifting? (**Note Rape and Domestic Violence are not laughing matters and the raping of anyone is a horrid Crime and I do not support it-in anyway what so ever. However this just had to go in here for the sheer fact that at 7 Am I chuckled--just a bit)

Keep better contact with everyone. Or let them know that phones, e-mails, letters, smoke signals, The Homo Beacon (Big Giant Martini Shapped Shadow in the Dark Nite Sky) think of The Bat Light... All work in two directions. Always. 

Stop vetching so much. Peoples lives are far worse then mine. I just need to suck it up and deal. Again this is one of those resolutions that most likely will not happen. It's a nice thought and all, but please if I couldn't bitch about my life what the hell would I talk about. 

Stop having fantasies about the cast of Harry Potter... Hot English Lads... also Elijah Wood is entering my fantasy life recently. I am deprived Sexually man let me tell ya. 

Bury the Axe with people... In their motherfucking Backs... Woo Go Caffinee go fuel the bitter. 

Sleep more often... with men

Go on a Diet. My ass is getting huge again and sporting this Gin and Scotch belly is not attractive not one little bit. Ewwwy

Invest in Electrolosis. No fucking comments or you all die. 

Admit that I have a tinsy little problem with alcohol. Please unless I highly enjoy you or respect you don't questions this.

Do some mercy killings. You know those people that always look so unhappy... the postman... that one clerk at the grocery store... the unhappy Video store employee that bitches when you don't rewind your tapes... the cunt at McDonald's who always glares when you don't have your money out. People like that. ((NOTE: I WILL NOT BE KILLING ANYONE IN 2005 THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A JOKE ha ha ha... PLEASE NO AUTHORITES NEED TO BE CONTACTED.)

Get a Mother Fucking Job... Or Find someway to scam the system and get goverment funding. Perhaps I will invent a charity and funnel all the money in to a Swiss Bank Account... Hmmm.

Be better to my self: IE Quit Smoking, Quit Smoking, Quit Smoking, Quit Having unprotected sex with llamas. 

Oh and I am going to invest in a dictionary my spelling sucks... often... really bad.

Ok these are all I can think of as of 7:40 in the morning. 

And what will your New Year's Resolutions be??? Let's start a chain and see how many of us will post. Tell your friends. Pass it along. Woo"

With Tears and Goodbyes we missed her, it was lame
She had some good times, Some British Boys
She Played with all their nasty toys
She had some fun she had some laughs
She most likely got to drunk and fell on her ass
She told us tales of Picaddle Circus and Buckingham Palace
We were jealous but we held no malicous
Then out of the blue She Returned on A Plane
There was much rejoicing and joy
And she gave feelings of happiness and splendor to one gay boy...


WELCOME HOME LAURA!!!!!


WE MISSED YOU

NOW GET HEALTHY SO YOU CAN DRIVE UP SO I CAN EAT YOUR MUFFIN

"event","Dear Live Journal,

  So there I was out to dinner with Nick and Jen (Again Nick thank you for all of the MSG, Chicken, and Crab) So I have a message on my machine from my mother

""David I know you are sick and most likely curled up on the couch sick, but please call me back... I love you""

Phone Conversation With my Mother

ME: ""Hi Mommy Dearest""
Mom: ""Hello Oh Sick One, how is your nose""
Me: ""Running faster then Flo Jo at a Track Meet""
Mom: ""Are we drinking fluids?""
Me:   ""Does Scotch Count""
Mom: ""Well yes and No, anyway I was shopping at CVS and guess what I found for you while I was there?""
Me: ""Tissues, Cough Syrup, I have no idea""
Mom: ""A Guy that is so adorable it is as if he jumped off of the pages of A Dicken's tale""
Me: ""Pardon, I could have sworn you said you found my a guy at CVS. Was he on clearence, I had forgotten that CVS had a guy section!?!?!?""
Mom: ""Oh Don't be foolish, I was shopping for DVD's and this cute kid came up behind me and grabbed me by the waist and told me that the DVD's Were far too exspensive here and that I should come up to Video Circus and buy them there""
Me: ""A COMPLETE STRANGER wrapped his arms around you that works at CVS???""
Mom: ""Yes but that isn't the point. He's adorable, beautiful eyes a head full of brown curly ringlets, he's short, intelligent and funny, he's so your perfect type...""
Me: ""Do we know his name?""
Mom: ""No""
Me: ""Do we know if he is single?""
Mom: ""No""
Me: ""Do we know if he is gay?""
Mom: ""No""
Me: "" So you are telling me that you want to hook me up with a guy that you don't know if he is gay or not, or even single""
Mom: ""Well I was going to ask him if he was gay or not.""
Me: ""Are you out of your fucking mind?""
Mom: ""Would that be rude""
Me: ""Rude, yes I think asking a complete stranger there sexual prefrence classifies as rude mother.""
Mom: ""Well I was going to be nice about it.""
Me: ""Okay if he is gay it won't be a problem, but if he's straight he's going to be really offended""
Mom: ""I don't care.""
Me: ""Alrightie then, so how are you going to ask him?""
Mom: ""Well, how does this sound 'Hi, can I ask you a question... Well I was wondering if you happened to be gay, because I have a gay single son who I think would be perfect for you.' what do you think?""
Me: I think you are the sweetest person for doing this. And also fucking insane.""
Mom: Well someone needs to be thinking of your love life.
Me: Thanks Mom. 
Mom: Alrightie I am going to go take a bath. I love you and will work on this tommorow.
Me: Okay Crazy Woman, Love you, will talk to you latter.


So whose mother exactly does things like this??? 

People wonder where I get my insanity from... I hope this answers their questions"

Although I came home with the purest intentions

The other is a friend I have lost. Which I am getting better with, I suppose. Listening to Maroon 5, listened to some Something Corporate earlier. Yeah, for anyone that knows me SC really isn't my cup of tea but I was being all nastalgic and such

who knows I hate confrontation. I was wrong. I know this. 

Somethings in life I guess can't be fixed, even though I am more then willing to

So I am thinking about Thanksgiving. (That's a fun sentence) I was wondering what everyone was doing. I am thinking of doing something outside of the box this year. So if you are in the area and have any nifty ideas give me a call at home

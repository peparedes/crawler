Okay, so yes, I have been horrible posting this month, but I assure you I'll be more active soon.

Right o. It was mon birthday on the 8th, which was mega disappointing thanks to my stupid parents. We went to Marcello's (an hella awesome pizza place on St. Clair at Dufferin-ish) with Kayla for dinner. This was all post the finding a restaurant fiasco meaning, my mother asked me to pick a place to go which took a while but I was kinda excited about because we were going to go to the Drake. Anyway, long story short we went through five restaurants before we actually found one with reservations. Needless to say I wasn't too keen on the whole night to begin with. Then my parents decided it was a fantastic idea to humiliate me by getting the staff to sing me happy birthday. *sigh* And then when we got home I opened my ""presents"" which were an iron etc. all household items. I didn't mean to but I was pretty disappointed. But the night was saved by Eric Kripke's mad ep. Born Under A Bad Sign. OMG!!1 evil!Sam, hurt!Dean and hella awesome angst, clearly someone sent Eric a memo it was my birthday.&nbsp; Kayla and I sat there thinking 'Wait... am I reading or watching this?' 

I devoured Torchwood and Dr. Who 9-10 this month thanks to Jennifer, what an all consuming fandom! It's super cute, I'd go so far as to say it's FANTASTIC!! 

My birthday celebrations continued last last weekend when a few of the gang spent the night with me in a semi seedy bar shooting pool, it was the best part of my birthday. I whooped Adam Choat's ass in pool too. Jess, Kayla and I were on fire. Chloe came too which was really nice because I haven't seen her in ages.

That's an effective recap. So yeah, I'll be more active soon."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so I have a livejournal now. It's fairly pretty thanks to Jessica but how do you get pictures in your band??? I'm talking a la Ellipsis's Kiera Knightly picture, maybe I'm just incompetant, which I'm pretty sure we've established before now but if anyone can answer me, big steaming piles of cookies are to be had.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sitting in class right now (politics) and I'm finding that it's imposible to stay focuesed lately. I and it's not just school either! Posting stories is hard too! Which uber sucks because LJ is a million times better than Fanfiction.net. I guess I'm just lazy but my new years resolution is to work harder, actually go to class and sleep more.

That's all for now!

Oh and if you can explain the picture thing please tell me!"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't had the chance to post since the madness that was the Brittany hosted New Years party so here I finally am, sober and not hung over and at home. It was a mad party, loads of fun of course, but absoluely bonkers in that I think I probably kissed at least fourty people whilest hammered and high (thanks for that Stu *sarcasm*)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there really is no better way to ring in the new year than spending it with good freinds, or new friends for that matter. Now, I'm not saying be smashed every time though B's parties are hi-larious, what I am saying is I feel very greatful to have these people in my life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the third year in a row I kissed Kayla at midnight which is sappy but a really nice tradition. We're coming up on our third official anniversary in a week and a half which is exciting, and funny enough everything between she and I has only gotten better. People in high school tend to think that time will lesson the intensity of the relationship and I'm certain that's true but not in that way that everyone thinks. I see it as the rollercoaster of emotions stops and you can get back to simply enjoying eachother as friends and lovers. And I'm a huge sap just BTW.

On the friend side of things I was really happy to have spent my new years with the people I did. I haven't seen most of that crowd in ages and it takes a gathering of that proportion to really show you how much you miss them. Today I spent my time with Kayla Stu and Mads watching the re-dubbed Harry Potter (and the last half we redubbed, lol) horrah for quality time."

"event","Yes, shock and horror, I have no idea what I'm doing on this damn thing! I was wrong in my last entry about semi-knowing what the heck I'm doing because I have no flipping idea but now that someone is giving me the halp I need, I'm working on not being an idiot. 

Alrighty, so Christmas is coming up and that means... dun dun dun, the Family christmas party which is freaking me out hugely. Family, booze and new shocking news about my personal life (which isn't all that shocking but they're gossip whores so hey. What can you do?) All this plus the added bonus of hearing my cousins talk about how great they are now that they're off at University. *sigh* 

On a more fun note, I'm back into one of my old vices, that's right, Vampires! Well, more specifically the people who fight them. Like King, oh I wish I could have his babies, and Abby and Whistler senior...oh and Blade can come too. Anywho, yeah, love them all and on a Ryan side note I watched the Just friends bloopers and nearly peed myself laughing. He's awesome, there, see I'm cracking up again.

Eric Kripke should be less of a fangirl and more of a producer sometimes, don't you think? I love the guy to death, don't get me wrong, but honestly, if you watched the last episode you know what I'm talking about. I nearly keeled over fron the Dean angst, I'm a sap but really people, his whole ""I'm tired"" thing. I can't type coherently. You know Eric had a hand in it. Remember the good old days when we'd ask him to ask Dean's shirt off and he'd make Dean rip his skin off too? Now he lets us have the shmoop we write on TV. *sigh* That's what fan fics are for!"

After trial and tribulation I've semi figured out livejournal. Hurray? I should be doing my homework but setting this up seemed like a bunch more fun so here I am. Granted pretty much anything is fun after babysitting tonight, where I cut myself on a sinister snow globe with horrible sparkles and the kids freaked out...anyways. I'm looking forwad to having a reason to get my ass in gear an post my stories on the SN slash community."

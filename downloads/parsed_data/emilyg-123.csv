"event","OK. So I think I'm doin the blogspot thang!!

Here's why:

1. It's pretty. My blogspot blog is pretty, with a pretty brown patterned background thing and pretty calming beige entry things and my profile picture is this lovely late afternoon sunflower field thing from when I&nbsp;went fruitpicking. Mmm. Calming. Pretty.

2. It has LABELS!&nbsp;I&nbsp;am legit excited about this. You can do a little thing where you type in what each entry was about, and then let's say someone wanted to read my entries about my friends. Ooh!&nbsp;You just click on 'friends' and then you can see all of them. Very neat and compartmentalized. Heck yes.

(I'm already going crazy trying to figure out how not to give each entry fifteen labels, though. &quot;Oh gosh, this entry is about my roommates, so click 'roommates', and I'd just had Tuesday dinner, so click 'Tuesday boys', but those are both my friends so maybe I should put 'friends', and I was at Wheaton when I&nbsp;was writing it so should I&nbsp;label it as 'Wheaton'? And, well, goodness, I mentioned a Psalm I liked so it's clearly&nbsp;a&nbsp;'God entry'...&nbsp;and&nbsp;does 'birthday' need to have its own category?&quot; Yes, this is what it is like to live in my brain.)

3. I figure I'll probably have a blog on HNGR, and I definitely wanted to start a new one then. So maybe I'll end up starting a whole new specific-for-HNGR one right before I&nbsp;leave, but it might be nice to have the year of HNGR-at-home/preparation tied in there...

So...&nbsp;I think you can find me on here:

"event","For the last week or so I've been reading ""Middle of Everywhere: The World's Refugees Come To Our Town"" by Mary Pipher. It was on my recommended list for HNGR and it is AMAZING. Informative and convicting and inspiring and moving and great.

I fold down the corners of pages that have something I want to remember to go back and look at. I just counted and I'm at almost 40. And I still have 30 pages to go.

I was feeling almost overwhelmed as I read last night, with how much in it I loved and thought was beautiful and well written and important to retain. I felt overwhelmed because I knew I could fold down the pages and even copy quotes out, but I would still not be able to keep all of the stories and information perfectly present and clear in my mind/heart for long.

I have a lot of experiences like that. Walks with bosom friends. Years spent living with roommates. Road trips taken with friends. Summers of working and quality time and waking up in a yellow room with toddlers playing downstairs.

Sometimes I get pretty overwhelmed with how much I want to be drinking every drop of my life, and how completely incapable I am of making sure I'm doing that.

I've been praying about that a lot this summer, the last month particularly. I've looked ahead and realized more and more how much the next couple years will consist of different short ""seasons"". I've worried about how I'll be able to be present in them and make the most out of them while always knowing that in a few months I'll be somewhere else.

I've been realizing how all I can really do is throw myself as much as possible into gratitude and joy for the gifts I have right now, today. To be thankful and happy: ""Today, Christina and Claire and I sat around Claire's kitchen table and ate really good peaches. Today, Mary and I camped out at Bean Hollow and drank chai and were hyper. Tonight, I got to sprawl on the couches in the Maloy's living room and crack up with Matt and Amy. Tonight, my roommates and I ate dinner together and laughed and danced in Danada Square.""

 I want SO BADLY to say ""Stop! Wait! Let me grab my journal! I have to write down exactly what I'm feeling and learning and experiencing! Where's my camera? Where's my quote book?"" And of course, permanent props to processing. But I will never be able to get a guarantee that the weight of each memory is being engraved into my heart. I will never be able to KNOW, that I am getting every single bit of these years squeezed right out of them.

I have to read my great books on refugees and ask God to teach me what I need to learn and take notes and then trust that God will bring to my mind what needs to be there at the right time; trust that somehow, I am different because I read that book, and somehow my life will show that, even if it's in an intangible, unmeasurable way.

I have to go into this year and love my roommates hard. And take these classes and sit with the information and let it soak in. And sit with Jesus and enjoy His word and somehow trust that it is doing something in me that I can't see- but keep reading it anyway. And I want to crack up laughing with my friends, and listen deeply to what they're saying, and be overwhelmed by how beautiful they are (and tell them it too much), and at the end of a night out be so excited that I have to say ""GUYS!!!!! WE LOVE EACH OTHER!!!!!!"" until everyone rolls their eyes at me.

And maybe I'll be able to retain the meaning and depth of all of those experiences precisely. Maybe I'll take the perfect picture that captures the moment, or I'll remember to write in my journal exactly how I felt on a given night. But I probably won't, at least not for all of them. But if I go into this semester and I really am grateful for each memory as it unfolds, if I enjoy nights in with my roommates and conversations with far away friends as they happen, if I give thanks for each day lived in my life filled with love, and ask for grace to live as well as possible (though I will never be perfect) the next day... even though I will never be able to perfectly preserve or quantify these years of my life... maybe that is really the best way to drink them to the last drop."

Sometimes if I feel fairly confident about how something's going to go, it's super hard for me to remember to trust God with it. Sometimes feeling totally inept can actually make it easier for me to trust God with something. I am so excited for this year but I feel pretty at a loss as to how to make it any certain way. I'm pretty much asking Him to just do His thing with it because I have no idea exactly what I should be doing. He is faithful to tell me, though.

Mary Wolf has a blog, which makes my life pretty much AMAZING!!! She writes exactly like she talks which means it is hilarious. Check it: http://mary-babieseverywhere.blogspot.com.

The Ramsings left for Uganda on Monday. My separation anxiety has mostly calmed down, although Mayr got back from Uganda today and they had sent a letter for me with her and of course I cried when I read it. I am so sososooo excited for them, though, and for all the people they're going to work with, and for what God is going to do in their family, and I am so amazed and proud of our church for the entire Uganda partnership and their priorities and ways of supporting each other and seeking God in the world. Heck. Yes. I am so lucky.

MARY'S HOME FROM UGANDA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She is so beautiful.

I had the perfect birthday. The aforementioned Cambodian phone call (will be talking about for the rest of my life). A peach-brownie-sunflower cake from Claire and Chris and an awesome sleepover with them... how much do I love those girls. Lunch with my beautiful sister, park with the girls (the weather was PERFECT and we got snowballs and all just laid on the grass and talked by the water and it was lovely), super fun dinner with Al and Dad. And then of course... Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2. SO good. My mother wrote me an incredible letter. Mary Wolf and my awesome housemates each took me out to dinner. My bosom friend (who was still in Uganda then) still managed to get me such an encouraging text message. A card from Heather came ON the exact day (how often does that happen?) and it was the nicest thing ever. I got to hear Jana's sweet voice for the first time since England! Basically... it was just a lovely day, and I felt really happy and lucky and grateful.

Update on to-do list: In a mad fit of frenzy, I cleaned my entire room in about 15 minutes last night. Not really- the clothes are just folded in a pile in the corner, not actually in drawers, and the books and notecards are all shoved on my dresser or under the window seats- but I have a floor and a made bed now so I can breathe nice deep feng-shui breaths. I'm partially caught up on emails. I ordered my textbooks. I've done some HNGR stuff. I'm trying to be slow.

I am grateful for quiet times, jobs I enjoy, real friendships, the laughter of people I love, Christmas lights on my bedroom walls, Ephesians 1, wisdom (both borrowed and hoped for), people being patient with me, hazelnut scented candles, text messages, good books, family, the weather, and affection. Not necessarily in that order.

And... I AM XENA WARRIOR PRINCESS!!!!! In a spontaneous passion to reclaim my time, I deactivated my Facebook. And not gonna lie, I FEEL SO FREE!!! Seriously. I don't miss it at all.

Please note that I did leave it on for two days around my birthday. I'm not that hard-core."

"event","I've been frustrated with myself the last few days, as I've tried to ""live in the moment"". A skill I can range from priding myself on to feeling completely incapable of. The couple of weeks before a transition (end of the semester, end of the summer), I'm pretty shamefully inept at it.

Today I kept trying to tell myself that I was experiencing holy moments. I kept talking to myself, about the beauty in the friends I was seeing, at Him at work in them, in the fact that I have friendships, and time to myself, and laughter, and music, and daily tasks which are small but add up to meaning and love.

I kept talking to myself about the sacredness and weight of the ordinary, and I believed it. But there was a gap between what I knew to be true, and my feelings. I KNEW I was living holy moments, but I FELT distracted and restless. And that made me frustrated.

Tonight I was washing dishes when it occurred to me that maybe the place I was in today, being unable to make myself FEEL joyful and grateful and present whenever I wanted, having to remind myself of the beauty that is so present in my life and surroundings, having to ask God for strength and wisdom because I'm definitely not rocking them myself... in other words, knowing that I am incompetent at making my life and moods go exactly how I want, and having to just suck that up and do the best I can and ask God for joy and trust Him to give it to me and go on with my daily life as faithfully as I can even when I'm not feeling awesome and together...

...was, in fact, where I was supposed to be. Or at least somewhere God was working.

Maybe it's giving myself too much slack. But the thought occurred to me that maybe that place of frustration this week was, in fact, a holy moment.

And for some reason, that one I could really believe."

"event","""Our emotional lives move up and down constantly. Sometimes we experience great mood swings: from excitement to depression, from joy to sorrow, from inner harmony to inner chaos. A little event, a word from someone, a disappointment in work, many things can trigger such mood swings. Mostly we have little control over these changes. It seems that they happen to us rather than being created by us.
""Thus, it is important to know that our emotional life is not the same as our spiritual life. Our spiritual life is the life of the Spirit of God within us. As we feel our emotions shift we must connect our spirits with the Spirit of God and remind ourselves that what we feel is not who we are.

i'm getting really excited.

a bunch of sort of hngr-y things happened this week...

i got an email from the new Assistant Director to all the interns just talking about the upcoming year, the World Relief tutoring, the small groups we'll be doing. what the heck!!! it's really happening!!!

i facebook-stalked the old Assistant Director (who just left to be a stay at home dad while his wife goes to grad school at Duke, which is awesome but i'm sad) and found out he has a BLOG and read it. it was in a conversation with him that i decided i really wanted to apply for the program. he and his wife are both HNGR alums and he's just one of the coolest, easiest to talk to people i know. so reading his blog made me excited.

i had dinner with mary wolf and she totally randomly brought up the program and was just saying how ever since i first mentioned it she's just had ""a feeling"" about it and that she thinks it's going to be such a great thing for me and she's so excited i get to go and she's praying about it with me and can't wait to hear all about it through the process and when i get back, etc, etc. i almost cried. actually i did a little bit.

i got a beautiful letter from my roommate laura the other day, and she mentioned it too, that she's excited to go ""through the journey"" with me this year. that means SO MUCH to me. i was thinking jokingly to myself last night that i feel like people caring about HNGR is one of my love languages right now. i told mary wolf that it means a lot that she even, like, remembers about it. especially when non-Wheaton people bring it up, i just feel really moved. and it is going to be such a big crazy process and it means THE WORLD to me to have the people i love entering into that with me, in whatever ways. THE WORLD. oh. i can't even say. mmm.

i've been getting updates from the <a href=""http://emilyg-123.livejournal.com/2008/05/26/"">people</a> who are on it right now and it is just so exciting and cool to hear about their internships, thoughts, people they're meeting, what they're learning. it is sooo exciting to see the thought processes that they're going thru and to be able to see growth just in the way they talk and write and what they're thinking and praying about. oh! the people in my life. how did i get so lucky??
side note, please pray for them- they're all getting to the two-three month mark which is apparently when you realize you're really NOT coming back to wheaton in the fall, and it's pretty hard for most people. yikes.

i talked to my friend jeremiah, who's going too, and it was so fun to hear his thoughts on the internship and just be excited together that we really get to DO THIS.

on a funny note, i found the ""Off the Record"" (wheaton's joke paper) article i'd saved about how to get into the program and reread it and cracked up. ""Try to look angsty and original in your application photo. Some have claimed that not showering for several days before their interview helped... and guys, one word about shaving: DON'T! Borrow clothes from an MK friend. Think ethnic.""

I just feel so lucky. And also I have no idea what to expect from this year and the whole thing. Who knows how this will be, what I'll learn and see??!!! I'm so excited and a little scared (I'm sure that will increase) but I'm really just trusting God and asking Him to give me an open, teachable heart with the year.

so thank you, thank you, thank you to all of you who have been and are continuing to be a part of this process for me (you know who you are :-)). i am sooooo lucky.

on a happy happy happy note, HEATHER my beautiful roommate is home from her summer in england!!!!!!! i am so excited to talk to her- we gchatted and despite the fact that we gchatted all the time while she was there just knowing that she was on the same continent almost made me cry. i can't wait to hear about everything she learned and saw and experienced!!! i'm not sure how i'm going to handle being so far from everyone if her being in england for six weeks had me staring at my phone willing it to magically have her name show up on my caller ID. but i know that it will all be okay when i get there :-)"

(and it was the normal non-expensive post office, too). <br /><br /><a href=""http://emilyg-123.livejournal.com/2008/06/05/"">nice friends</a> who are willing to go on facebook to find addresses for me when i call them desperately from the post office.<br /><br />a totally unexpected just-to-say-hi letter from DR. BARWEGEN!!!!&nbsp;i love her so much. it was a really fun cute letter and of course it was encouraging because it's dr. barwegen, she told me all these things she's been praying for me for. i have learned so much about prayer from that woman, just because she DOES IT. if tamara or i tell her something, even in passing, about our lives or hearts or&nbsp;friends or just random thoughts,&nbsp;the next time we hang out she always asks about it and has been praying about it. it's gotten to the point where a lot of the times one of us will be telling the other one about something big God taught us or a ""breakthrough"" that's happened and we'll just look at each other and go, yeah, i bet Dr. Barwegen was praying.<br /><br />my closing job at famous dave's tonight was ""desserts"", which i'd never done before, so i asked this girl in passing (who i had just met) if she could just explain quickly what that consisted of. she not only told me, she walked me through it and then DID THEM WITH ME (it involves filling the whole dessert case in addition to cleaning up the station, so it takes&nbsp;a really long time). unless you have ever closed out at a restaurant, it is hard to explain just how above and beyond and just KIND that was. when i effusively thanked her, she just laughed and said ""Someone helped me with desserts the first time I had it, so I figured I'd pass it on, eh?"". I want to do something really really really nice for her. <br /><br />i had a sweet family in my section whose son is going into 9th at wilde lake, and they were all excited that i was a graduate and asked about college and stuff and talked about what they like about the hoco school system and were just generally really cool. and they way overtipped me. seriously, the generosity when people do that really affects me more than the money. if you look at the difference between 15 and 20 and 25%, it's really not very much, but the thoughtfulness of people who remember that their servers are people always makes my day. i know that in the grand scheme of life there are probably more noble things to give my money to, but after working this job, i don't care. charity begins at home and i want to be a Big Freaking Tipper, because a few extra dollars to the girl who makes my lattes or cuts my hair actually does matter. <br /><br />looking down at my phone during work and seeing missed calls from david and christina. <br /><br />david's voicemail making me laugh out loud because ""just thought i'd call and say hi because... i had some extra time because... i'm waiting for my dad... because my keys are sort of locked in my car so...""<br /><br />christina's voicemail saying ""i just wanted to see if you wanted to have dinner, you know, just whatever we're having, and then i have to go to cvs so i thought maybe you'd want to come.""<br /><br />having friends who i go to cvs with.&nbsp;<br /><br />an email from claire that makes me wish i didn't use phrases like ""best ever"" and ""breathtaking"" so often because i want to use them about it and i want it to sound like what they mean and not like something that happens all the time. because that's how wonderful it was.&nbsp;<br /><br />watching all of <a href=""http://superkulejenta.blogspot.com"">emilie'</a>s videos on facebook ""blogging"" her adventures in Ghana and London (so far). it made me sooo happy to see her face and hear her voice and see how much fun she's having. and she really is just like, breathtakingly beautiful. it almost made me choke up. actually, it did make me choke up. it is 1 am, though. i love that girl and i love learning from her and getting to be friends with her.<br /><br />my life is so sweet and good. i am grateful."

"event","<p>Brian and Claudia got married tonight. It was beautiful, and I was honored to stand up with them and take part in their day.<br /><br />But I really want to write about the rehearsal dinner.<br /><br />The rehearsal dinner?! But that's, like, not even the ceremony!<br /><br />Excellent point. This entire weekend was amazing and joy-filled and I'm sure I could write this same entry about pretty much a dozen different moments; but there was one part that I keep thinking about and realizing more every time how momentous it was.<br /><br />At Claudia and Brian's rehearsal dinner, a whole big bunch of people ate crabs and drank beer and got messy and laughed and talked and caught up and told stories. And it was loud and casual and funny.<br /><br />And then Brian's dad asked them to sit down, and the two of them sat holding hands&nbsp;on two chairs in the middle of the deck and cried a bit while&nbsp;different people&nbsp;took turns&nbsp;standing&nbsp;up to talk to them and about them. To say how excited we were about their marriage, to say what we admired about their relationship, to point out how we'd seen God working in them and what our prayers were for their future together.<br /><br />It was incredibly moving, and I'm sure so encouraging to them. And it was also one of the most spiritual events I feel I could ever witness.<br /><br />""Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, 'This <strong>marks the place</strong> where the Lord has helped us.'"" (1 Samuel 7:12)</p><p>It&nbsp;is SO IMPORTANT to&nbsp;remember the past. What?! The past?! Doesn't that mean we're like, not living in the moment?!</p><p>But God has been so faithful in the past. He has been so kind. He has done so many good things. There is so much in our lives now that we can only appreciate by looking back and&nbsp;<strong>marking the place-</strong> saying,&nbsp;""Oh-my-gosh, look how much we've been blessed. Look what He was doing when we didn't even know. Look how far we've come. <strong>Look how the Lord has helped us.</strong>""<br /><br />Claudia and Brian do that a lot, and this weekend was such a celebration of that; of their love for each other, and of how the Lord has helped them. That hour on the deck as their family and friends shared and cried was all of us ""raising our Ebenezer"", as the hymn goes, to point out to them how much&nbsp;over the past six years&nbsp;we've&nbsp;seen God's faithfulness and power in their relationship, to share our faith in them and excitement about how they will reflect Him, and to take the time and intention to <strong>mark</strong> what God has done, in our friendships with them and in their lives as individuals and as a couple.<br /><br />And that's why weddings are so important and why they're not really just a big party. I throw the word ""celebration"" around a lot as a synonym for party. A party can be a celebration. But celebrating, in and of itself, is actually a very serious thing. It's consciously and intentionally setting aside time to think about everything God has done and how lucky and thankful we are and how kind and awesome He is.<br /><br />And then BEING REALLY HAPPY ABOUT IT!!!! (That part's&nbsp;maybe theologically debatable; I don't care.)<br /><br />In the case of a wedding, we are celebrating the lives of two people, who we admire, who we enjoy, who have added to our lives <em>(Thank You for Claudia, for her honesty, for her pursuit of being used by You, for how she makes everyone laugh, for the way You've used her in my life from my first year getting to know You through today).</em> We are celebrating the love that has grown between them, the joy they bring to each other and the reflection of God we see in them (<em>Thank You for, as Brian's sister put it, the way he can take care of her, the way she can encourage him).</em>&nbsp;We are celebrating what God has done in their relationship (<em>Thank You that both of them have released this relationship to You time and again, that they have learned and in turn taught us the value of commitment and the peace that comes with trusting Your perfect timing). </em>We are celebrating the future they will have together (<em>Let them see You in each other. Let them help each other draw closer to You. Let them do more and love harder as a couple than either could have alone. Let others be impacted. Bring joy and more knowledge of You).<br /></em><br />There are so many times to celebrate. When I pray about a worry and someone unknowingly speaks encouragement directly to it,&nbsp;do I pause to <em>really</em> celebrate the fact that&nbsp;God just provided for me, and what that means about His character and His care for me? Seeing someone grow.&nbsp;Loving conflict resolution in my suite. Reflecting on&nbsp;the amazing friendships that I have. I look at pictures a lot, and sometimes (particularly if they're on Facebook...) I categorize that as ""wasting time""; yet maybe remembering an awesome road trip is responding to a&nbsp;call to <em>celebrate</em> friendship and memories.<br /><br />When we&nbsp;<strong>remember to</strong> <strong>remember</strong>, to&nbsp;mark the places where God has helped us and celebrate them, we are thanking Him and becoming increasingly aware of His presence. PLUS, it's&nbsp;like we're adding in extra joy to our lives. Joy that is free for us to have if we just are intentional about recognizing the many things we already have to celebrate!!!<br /><br />It was a great wedding and a great weekend.</p>"

"event","&nbsp;""How do we get in touch with being the Beloved? ...You have to <strong>celebrate your chosenness</strong> constantly. This means <strong>saying ""thank you"" </strong>to God for having chosen you, and ""<strong>thank you"" to all who remind you</strong> of your chosenness. <strong>Gratitude is the most fruitful way of deepening your consciousness that you are not an accident, but a divine choice</strong>. It is important to realize how often we have had chances to be grateful and have not used them. When someone is kind to us, when an event turns out well, when a problem is solved, a relationship restored, a wound healed, there are very concrete reasons to offer thanks: be it with words, with flowers, with a letter, a phone call, or just a gesture of affection... we are faced with the freedom to make a decision. We can decide to be grateful or to be bitter. We can decide to recognize our chosenness in the moment or we can decide to focus on the shadow side. When we persist in looking at the shadow side, we will eventually end up in the dark... When we keep claiming the light, we will find ourselves becoming more and more radiant. What fascinates me so much is that every time we decide to be grateful it will be easier to see new things to be grateful for. Gratitude begets gratitude, just as love begets love.""<br /><br />-Nouwen, <em><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30749976&amp;id=187703343"">Life of the Beloved</a></em>"

(oh, wheaton).

a few days later i ended up sitting in front of one of these guys in my very first Wheaton bible class. and thus a friendship was formed.

over the last two years, matthew william hiltibran has been a consistent source of fun and encouragement for me and everyone else he is friends with on campus... which is a ridiculous amount of people. from joining me in perfecting the art of itunes browsing as a means of homework procrastination, to refusing to let me distract him anymore and actually making me work, from <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30663836&id=187703343"">sweet nights out with friends</a> to <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30749942&id=187703343&ref=share"">amazing adventures</a> and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30749956&id=187703343"">perfect roadtrips</a>, he manages to add good doses of both complete <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30749979&id=187703343&ref=share"">insanity</a> and gentle reality checks wherever he goes. he inspires all of his friends, family, and acquaintances with his consistent kindness, genuine interest in others, and passions for justice and compassion, he's one of the most empathetic listeners you could ever hope to meet, and he has way more wisdom than he gives himself credit for.

happy 20th birthday matt! there's no one i'd rather have mocking me with my roommate than you :-)"

"event","In case you wanted to understand what my amazing road trip was like, I thought <a href=""http://www.someecards.com/upload/friendship/lets_go_maniacally_obsess_about_our.html"">this e-card</a> I just got from David really summed it up.

I'm still journaling about it for myself but basically: amazing friends, beautiful scenery, no agenda which led to every day being an adventure, crazy times, the kind of conversations you remember for the rest of your life, and plenty of space/open hearts/time for God to teach me and I know the guys too a lot. Major bonding, ridiculous amounts of memories, clarity, affirmation, nature, hiking, great music and two facebook album's worth of photos which we've been informed have inspired major amounts of jealousy from the vast majority of Wheaton College. Hey, they could have come.

We talked a lot that week about how if you have people to love who love you, you are in the top .0000000001% of world's luckiest people, because so many don't have that. I am definitely in the luckiest percentile ever. I'll sign off on that note :-)"

"event","I spent today thinking of and praying for my sweet friend <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30730246&id=187701083"">Sarah</a>. She is currently on her way to Cambodia, ready and excited to start a six-month HNGR internship in the slums of Phnom Penh.

From living directly across the hallway and snuggling me through the ups and downs of freshman year, to instructing me on what a good cup of tea can add to a conversation, Sarah has impacted my life in more ways than I could number. She planned a night for <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30730258&id=187701083"">our small group</a> to share our favorite poems with each other and she asked me on our first date what I do that ""gives me life"". She's taught me to see God in the beauty and rhythm of liturgy, to take note of what I hear in solitude and reflection and a good bike ride. She is probably the major reason I first decided to apply for HNGR. Both directly (I got to see her go through the whole process last year), and because so many of my thoughts and prayers about compassion, about the needs of those throughout the world and what life is like for so many I do not see, about social justice and what it means to be a Christian and how I want my life to look and how it should and could look, came straight from conversations with her, through her challenges to me and through seeing her struggle with those questions and discrepancies herself.

We talked the other night and I prayed this for her, from a book we've used together in our small group:

As we remember saints
who have journeyed before us,
Lord, teach us the way of their simplicity:
strength with humility,
at peace in the fear of God.
May we also go wherever we are led.

The keeping of Christ about her,
the guarding of God with her
to possess her, to protect her
from drowning and danger and loss,
the gospel of the God of grace
from brow of head
to sole of foot,
the gospel of Christ,
King of salvation,
be as a mantle to her body.

All she speaks
be blessed to her, O God.
All she hears
be blessed to her, O God.
All she sees
be blessed to her, O God.
All she senses
be blessed to her, O God.
All she tastes
be blessed to her, O God.
Each step she takes,
be blessed to her, O God...

On Your path, O my God,
and not her own,
be all her journeying.
Rule this heart of hers
that it be only Yours.

Pray for her today if you get a chance. Pray for safety, for wisdom, that she would have the time of her life and learn from others and that they would get the chance to learn from her as I have been <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30730261&id=187701083&ref=share"">so lucky</a> to."

""What's it like,"" she asked James, ""to be out there? Are you the only boat you can see?""

James, his face touched by the glow of the lamp, his eyes narrowed as if focused on a faraway view, told Margaret Mary.

""Sometimes alone, most times one of many. It's like a giant, or something bigger than all of us, has taken the sky and tucked it down securely all around and kept us safely bobbing within.""

Cassie, her fork caught midway between her plate and her mouth, stared at James. She'd never heard him talk this way before. Or seen his look of contentment.

""But there are storms!"" she protested as everyone turned to look at her.

Her father laughed. ""That there are, Cass,"" he said.

""But after the storms,"" said John Thomas, smiling, ""coming home with the gulls and terns following us, some even daring to sit on the boat, waiting for scraps of fish, it is like..."" John Thomas, not used to long speeches, searched for the right words.

""Peace,"" said James quietly. ""It is peace.""

""And,"" said Cassie's father, as if adding to a chorus, ""that's the way it has been for hundreds and hundreds of years. Just the men, the boats, and the sea.""

There was a long silence. It had never occurred to Cassie that they loved fishing. She had always thought they did it because they had to.

""It is somehow always the same and yet never the same,"" said Cassie's father. ""But always beautiful."""

So she's listening... 
""I really like this song!!""
""I told you! Isn't it great?""
""Yeah. So, what's it about? Like, a person, or... something else?""
(confused pause)
""What's it ab... oh! Do you mean is it about God? No. It's just a love song.""

except it cant be a real update because matt and david are urging me that we have to go buy food before it gets too dark. we're going to have a picnic at a gorge that the nice girl working at the coffee shop told us about.

that's pretty much the best way to describe this (AMAZING) trip though- we drive. we talk to people. we decide what to do next based off of what people have said/our map says/what cute towns we drive through.

seriously. we're camping tonight in this really pretty town by a lake just because it was pretty when we drove past it.

I LOVE ROAD TRIPS!

i'll be home monday night.

ok now they just noticed that i'm writing in my lj instead of checking email like i told them so i REALLY have to go.

love to all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

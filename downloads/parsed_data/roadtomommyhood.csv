"event","<p>I had my first pregnancy puke last night, and I honestly think it was actually unrelated to pregnancy, for the most part. I've noticed that since I've been pregnant, I cannot stand any hair in my mouth, at all. not even the tip of a strand stuck to my lips. The very thought of it makes me gag. Well last night I felt a hair in my mouth, a small one in the back that I couldn't get. So I tried to drink some water to swallow it down. Bad choice. I threw up the water. And the the peaches I'd had two hrs earlier. It honestly wasn't that bad and I wasn't nauseous at all. Right after it I went and ate my tacos.&nbsp;<br /><br />But alas, I can now stand in the pregnancy puke group. Woo hoo for me?<br /><br />Amy</p>"

"event","ahh my first journal entry............wow. Well life is interesting ........for the first time in about a year i am truly single...no boyfrineds, boys on the side nothing...its refreshing and sucks all at once. i deeply cared for somoone who would not even think twice about me unless i gave him sex..........and i was in love with someone a few years ago but that really is it for my relationships....its funny cuz i want relationships...i want to be loved...i dont think ne one loves me or ever will but its like sex is more important... i havent done everything sexually yet that i want and it seems to me that until i do...karma wont let me have a real relationship. i need to meet people who are intelligent...i have met alot of people who think they are intelligent and really arent.........ive met alot of people who cant think unless its about sex........but ihavent met anyone i can have a real conversation with..............and to confuse me more about love, life and sex i started having weird dreams...day dreams mind you about girls...( none who i no but people ive never met) ive always known that im bisexual but FUCK ive never dated a gurl........maybe i need to do that...ultimatly i want to marry a guy....i think....i dunno...... ive never had feelings for a gurl though just wanted to fuck one and i have...but only 2.....and why the hell is this all going through my head and why wont i be happy till i figure it out...EVERYTHING else is great..i have friends who care( alhtough i cant talk to some of them), i have a great job, im in university, i no im not the smartest person in the world but im never ignorant..im always learning, i have money and a roof over my head, i listen to music which all i really care to do, im not shy..im really happy with how i look.... so why the hell am i unhappy........... for someone who has an A average in university so far this shoudlnt be such a difficult task...happines and yet it is.........i am the only person i no who is not content with the majority of their lives...(which really isnt saying much for my frineds.....) I hate this city.......its cold....or maybe im just cold......"

"event","nope, i didn't die; i got a JOB!!  which, from a different angle, is prolly the same death sentence that i'd granted upon myself, but i must drop the whining coz CITIBANK's after my proletarian ass.  BILLS, BILLS, AND MORE BLASTED BILLS!  so what's a girl to do? werk it! WERRRK it, gurrrlll!!

speaking of WORK, my book backlog is another eternal busload of doorstops that just won't stop piling.  i can't get out of fullybooked or powerbooks without a purchase in tow!  i'm a shameless accumulator and my ability to devour books always gets trumped by that avaricious consumerist beast in me.  show me a previously out-of-print Palahniuk title, i sweat and hyperventillate like a pedophile in the middle of a packed preschool playground.  you get my point.

so uhh im still here, breathing, but STILL not debt relieved."

Valer kuberch, kahit jutay
Ang julamantrax donchi ay anek-anek.
Nyongkamas at nutring, nyogarilyas at kipay
Nyitaw, nyotaw, jutani.
Kundol, jutola, jupot jolabastrax
At mega join-join pa, jobanox nyustasa.
Nyubuyax, nyomatis, nyowang at luyax

and in other not so new but considerably significant news (well, not really.), Rico Blanco is officially no longer with the band!  
yeah, Rivermaya!  no, silly! im not talking about those Muscle Marys who clock in at the gym daily and pump iron as if their herpes-infested colons depended on it!  but really, i cant stand those 'Stepford Faggot' types who act as if they mistake the multicolored radiance of a fabulous gay guy (namely ME!!) as an incubus of viral plague when, in unfortunate cases of temporal anomaly, the universe suddenly tasks one of those CLONES, of course bedecked in their generic metrosexual Maya schmaya fashion, to step on the fringes of my aura.  see, giving a wide berthing distance to a fella in this overpopulated metropolis is polite but blatant snobbery is *NOT*.  bitches, please!!  playing dead ignorant about my satin scarf'd existence doesnt break my crayons, NOoo! but brushing me off like im Jojo Veloso (or some suburban paedophile, for that matter!)?  TOO uncouth for my own good!!  come on, give your preppy Lacoste(?) things some kahihiyan!  coz i KNOW that you KNOW that Boy Abunda knows that you and i both bust our nuts thinking of Piolo (eew!) during lazy sunday nights and the cosmos decided to rain on your teaparty therefore, you're stuck in your bed and you start thinking where you stashed that porn mag!  i bet my hiv- ass that you and your straight-as-a-row-of-Veco-posts facade suck cock faster and harder than my blower can handle, yes?!  



forgive the digression.


it makes me sad sad sad when bands well, uhmm disband!  for the love of all things holy, just when they've broken out and carved a tiny little niche in the international scene, comes this fallout?!  


oh well, at least i cant blame my fancy scarves on this one.

Raquel Nacario is a general purpose evil-doer. She was created by God in 1979 (?) as my personal pain in the neck.  The bane of my existence. She currently lives in Cebu, but has a summer residence down in Devil Gate Drive, aka South Cotabato.  Im kidding."

so, i dont know what the whole point of this is..  all i know is, i gave somebody head last night which counts to nothing coz the whole necking that led to that got trampled upon by me being a stinking bacchanalian who doesnt give two flying figs if i scored or not, coz getting high on alcohol and a dash of post-teen rage trumps cumming and getting arsed ANYTIME!

"event","i finally got to haul my ass to the movies and catch the blue, padded spandex(?)-clad,red-caped long-distance flier last night.  the 2-hour and 45-minute flick did not disappoint but ayala cinemas should better impose viewing hours for motherfucking kids!  gawd, they were everywhere.  i was fine until this fatherly-looking person asked me to move my ass like 3 seats over so that his whole family of 8 could be seated together.  bummer.  his kids were actually complaining about lapsitting so that was root of my plight.  but, almighty god!!it was the last full show and those kids were supposed to be sucking breasts!  but i decided to ""take"" in the flick and stop bitching!  even though the padded suit was pretty obvious in some scenes, Brandon Routh still managed to ooze with superman juices making me cream my pants.  and Parker Posey didnt disappoint too!  she's very good with these ""character"" roles!  she IS the shiznit, scrap that, an ICON!   i've loved her since SUBURBIA!

the ride home was a bitch too!  i felt like a butch-looking whore with my big mickey mouse shirt on, waiting for that downtown ride beside TJ's.  i felt like i've spent much for the day, so the minimum 6-peso return fare, i thought, was in order.  but, after what seemed like a whole larvae-metamorphose-to-butterfly life cycle,  i ended up hailin a cab.  

and, yah, the cabbie, for lacking loose change, charged me more."

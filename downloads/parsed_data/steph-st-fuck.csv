Ahhh, wow.  school is so exciting. Screw class rooms and education, its all about the students.  The girls, the boys, who's with who, what parties are coming up, what's going on with that girls outfit... 
WHO CARES!!! ... well, ill tell you who.  Everyone! everyone's so wrapped up in the social aspect, that it doesnt even seem like people care about their studies.  For example, grade 12 history students, including myself, are all worked up about the dance, their outfits, who their dates are... meanwhile, we have a project and a test on monday AND for those who arent caught up in their work, an other project FOR TOMORROW
... fuck

There's something I can't quite explain
I'm so in love with you
You'll never take that away
And if I've said it a hundred times before
Expect a thousand more
You'll never take that away

So expect me to be
Calling you to see
If you're okay when I'm not around
Asking ""if you love me""
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile?
To make us smile

[Chorus]
I will keep calling you to see
If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me
I can't believe you actually picked me

I thought that the world had lost it's sway
It's so hard sometimes
Then I fell in love with you
Then came you
And you took that away
It's not so difficult
The world is not so difficult
You take away the old
Show me the new
And I feel like I can fly when I stand next to you
So while I'm on this phone
A hundred miles from home
I'll take the words you gave me and send them back to you

I only want to see
If you're okay when I'm not around
Asking ""if you love me""
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile?
To make us smile

the respond/question that ""Anonymous"" left was:
""So what exactly happened that could make you this mad at someone? You sound so upset! no one should have to feel like that""

the answer!:

well lets c,.....i dated my ex, Ryan, 4 almost 3YEARS! and during those 3years! he told me lies right through his teeth! and my mistake was believeing every damn word he said! for explain: 

""I LOVE YOU 4EVER!"" ""I NEVER WANTA BE WITH ANY OTHER GIRL!"" ""YOUR MY LIFE"" and he even had conversations with me about our life after highschool! like college and MARRIAGE and even starting a FAMILY! and sooo much more lies about how much i mean 2 him and how much he ""loves me"" but it was all bullshit! soo...

it ended like this....
ok latley, i've been turning myself down cuz i basically had NO self-esteem! so i was talking 2 a counsler 2 help me through it! cuz at 1point during the summer i was going through a depression! (long story!)  but anyways....so like Oct. 4th he calls me and basically said that i need 2 get better and we need 2 take a ""break"" and maybe date other people and then maybe get back 2gether! at 1st i was really really upset! and i wanted 2 actually know what was really going 2 happen, so i told him 2 look in my eyes and say ""we're never going 2 get back 2gether and i don't love you"" and he said ""no, i can't say that"" and i said ""y?!"" and he said ""cuz it's not true!"" so after a while, i thought about it and we like ""uk what? maybe this is a good idea, take a break and then when everything is better we'll get back 2gether"" but then on, i think, Oct 15th. he calls me up and says ""we're NEVER going 2 get back 2gether!"" that just proves that he lies right there! how he said that it's not true that we were NEVER going 2 get back 2gether! and then he said we are NEVER going 2 get back 2gether! what a fucking LIAR!!

but w/e! whats done is done! there's nothing i can do about it! i can't change what he said! or all the lies he told me! at least when i said thos things..I MEANT THEM! so yea! 

the 2nd part 2 ur statement is: DAMN RIGHT I'M UPSET!! 

and the 3rd part 2 ur statement is: DAMN RIGHT! but theres nothing i can do 2 stop this feeling! i fell in love! and he don't love me anymore! and yea! which is my mistake! but w/e

Miss keep your distance, 
Miss im affraid
Miss out of my way
Miss dont let a man interfere,
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne

So, by keepin her heart protected,
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive said ooo,
She fell in love.

What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open her door
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

Miss got it hard heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you wanna use that line you better not start, noooo
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss, decided not to miss out on true love, so
By changing a misconception 
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love.

What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open her door (open her door)
Surprise...It's time (yeah)
To feel what's real (what's real)
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (goodbye), old you (old you)
When love, when love is true

Well, Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of ""Why can't that be me?""
I'm so glad I've finally seen...

What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open her door (oh yeah)
Surprise (surprise)...It's time (yeah)

They crawl in like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed 
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I'm alone 
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home 
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain 
An ounce of peace is all I want for you. Will you never call again? 
And will you never say that you love me just to put it in my face? 
And will you never try to reach me? It is I that wanted space 

Hate me today 
Hate me tomorrow 
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you 

I'm sober now for 3 whole months it's one accomplishment that you helped me with 
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won't touch again 
In a sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night 
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight 
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate 
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take 
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind 
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind 

Hate me today 
Hate me tomorrow 
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you 

Hate me in ways 
Yeah ways hard to swallow 
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you 

And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave 
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made 
And like a baby boy I never was a man 
Until I saw your blue eyes crying and I held your face in my hand 
And then I fell down yelling ""make it go away!"" 
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be 
And then she whispered ""How can you do this to me?"" 

Hate me today 
Hate me tomorrow 
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you 

Hate me in ways 
Yeah ways hard to swallow 
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you""

<br>
this has been the HARDEST thing in my life!! (so far) at this point i wish i hadn't don't half the things i did!!! :( 
<br>
i just wish he loved me, the way i love him!! :( :'( i love him more then he'll ever love me in his lifetime!!! and it anything happened 2 him i'd die!!! and if he,somehow, ended up in the hospital! i'd be by his side the whole time!!! and i'd NEVER leave his side!!!

well this weekend was pretty good...i only cried like twice! i 1st cried when i was trying 2 talk 2 Ryan but of course he just igorded me and wouldn't talk 2 me! so i got upset and yea. cuz all i wanted was 4 things between me and him 2 be ok! cuz of course i can't beg him 2 be back with me cuz....thats not good! (plus he wouldn't) and he just wants time....and the 2nd time i cried was cuz Ryan was leaving 2 go home. so yea! of course i'll cry 4 that! but anyways......i think this weekend helps cuz i think it made me and Ryan grow closer! at least i hope so! cuz we both had passion 4 eachother! (long story) and when he said ""this is the passion i miss"" or something like that, he said ""i'll tell u in a week"" meaning how much longer until <big>he's<small> ready 2 go back out with me. and not that i think about it...this weekend has sorta helped me understand y. i'm guessing cuz Ryan is sick of me getting all worked up over ""nothing"". but if/when we do get back 2gether theres going 2 be some changes. so yea. well i g2g cuz i'm at school and yea!

You touched my heart you touched my soul.
You changed my life and all my goals.
And love is blind and that I knew when,
My heart was blinded by you.
I've kissed your lips and held your hand.
Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
I know you well, I know your smell.
I've been addicted to you.

[x2]
Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.

I am a dreamer and when i wake,
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.
And as you move on, remember me,
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.
I've watched you sleeping for a while.
I'd be the father of your child.
I'd spend a lifetime with you.
I know your fears and you know mine.
We've had our doubts but now we're fine,
And I love you, I swear that's true.
I cannot live without you.

[x2]
Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.

And I still hold your hand in mine.
In mine when I'm asleep.
And I will bare my soul in time,
When I'm kneeling at your feet.
Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.

I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow."

"event","so yea! hi i'm at school right now, but it's not like anybody cares. anyways....well.....what should i talk about in this stupid entry! lol ummmm.......lets talk about whats going on in my sad lonely life. well...let i said b4 i'm at school so i'll start there...

well 2day i woke up at 6:00am let i do every school day. and brushed my hair, went 2 the bathroom, then i brushed my teeth, then got dressed and then brushed my hair again and when i was done it was 6:06am yes! 6:06am! it takes me only 6mins 2 get ready 4 school. anyways then i went downstairs and layed on the couch 4 20mins. then my mom woke me up and said ""ok it's time 2 go"". so then my mom drove me 2 school and the sun was in my eyes and it hurt! then i got 2 school at 6:35am and sat down at the cafe. and got myself a drink. (french vanilla and hot chocolate mixed 2gether =) ) then at 7:00am i went 2 go fine my friend Steph! so i talked 2 Steph and Steph until 7:17am then i went 2 my 1st class Math. that was pretty boring! we had a sub. which ik and i'm friends with =). and we had a quiz and a review packet and when we were done she gave us these fun worksheet things. 

after Math i went 2 advisement (aka studyhall) and i did my homework and now i'm typing this entry! yep! thats my day so far! pretty boring! but after this i'm going 2 GLOBAL ""favortie class"" NOT!!! then lunch, then back 2 global! then Earth Science! eww!! I HATE EARTH SCIENCE!!! but only cuz my stupid freakin' teacher! he freakin' hates me 4 NO REASON!! i hate that!! when somebody hates u 4 NNNNOOOO REASON at ALLL!!! and the worst part is that my Earth Science teacher (Mr. Humpheys) is my advisement teacher 2!!! **rolling eyes** o well!

anyways....2day after school i have a freakin' piano lesson 2day, and i don't really like piano lessons cuz idk! it's hard! and i screw up! ALLLLL the time!!! but w/e! then i'm going this Youth Group party! and yea! the only bad part is that Ryan has 2 work 2night so he can't go! :( o well! i'll live! but he might come over 2morrow night cuz of band practice! my dad might pick him up and get home at like 5:10pmish and band practice starts at 7:20pmish! and he'll stay until 10pmish when band practice ends. so yea! but he might not cuz he has other plans, but they might be canceled! but it doesn' really matter cuz idk whats going on between me and him! (again) guys r soooo confusing!! they are totally hard 2 understand!!! like...when i talk 2 him asking him if he really loves me he says ""yea! i do love you!"" but then on the phone when he gets off he never says ""i love you"" it's always 

ryan:""well i'm gonna go now""
me: ""ok, ttyl then""
ryan: ""ok, bye""
me:""....bye""

yea! id understand! some of u might be thinking ""well u didn't say ""i love you"" either"" well i believe that whoever is choosing 2 leave should say ""i love you"" 1st! cuz yea! i understand if he didn't say ""i love you"" cuz he was going 2 call me back later that day, but he wasn't! so yea! and some of u might be thinking ""well he shouldn't have 2 say ""i love you"" all the time!"" well thats not what i want! i only want him 2 say if he means it! and if thats the end 4 the night, cuz u NEVER know when somebody could die or end up in the hospital!!! so the last think u should he somebody say is  ""i love you""! cuz if they do end up dying and the last words u hear aren't ""i love you"" then u'll never know if they loved u! thats what i believe!! so yea! omg! this is soo weird! cuz i'm randomly shaking! my hands r shaking! and it's creeping my out! 

well i should go now! cuz this is a mad long entry 4 me! and idk what else 2 say at the moment!! and my hands 4 shaking (like i said b4) so yea!


~""I Love You""~

bye

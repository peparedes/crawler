"event","It's been a while since my last post and I've certainly gotten over that angry spell.  Mind you, with a couple of friends I'm still a bit upset because you know, it doesn't really take that much to call someone back, but whatever.

Anyways, in the last little while not too much has happened.  I went to Suzy's last Monday with Janna and Kira and Suzy's friends were there.  It was fun, at least I had fun, I think Janna and Kira felt left out, but I'm shy so I prefer to observe and I had a good time.  Suzy's friends are really nice but apparently Kira didn't think so.  She's so annoying.  Then, that Wednesday I went back over to Suzy's house and she cut my hair for me and put it in corn-rows.  They stayed in for about a week and then one of the elastics broke so :(

I worked quite a bit in between.  This past Saturday I went to Rebecca's house for Indian Tacos and they were SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO tasty!  Better than ever.  Suzy missed out, but she'll definitely have to come next time!  We also played Scene It and Trivial Pursuit DVD Pop-Culture Edition at Rebecca's.  Rebecca gets very competitive when she plays board games :)  We had a blast though!

This week however, got off to a really bad start.  Chris and I are on a break, my idea.  You see, he becomes a real ass when he's in a bad mood and treats everyone like it's all their fault.  Well, he kept hanging up on me when I called and acting like a child so I told him that if that's how he wants to behave then he can do so without me.  I just get so annoyed with that kind of behaviour.  Especially when it's coming from a 19 year old.  Then he called and was all ""I'm sorry.  My dad pissed me off, it wasn't your fault.  You didn't deserve that..."" but I told him that regardless I still want some time to be away from him.  So that's that.  Don't get me wrong, I was upset.  I was balling.  I called Suzy and she came over and cheered me up.  She's the best.  Then Margie brought Sydney and Myah over and that cheered me up even more.  (That was all yesterday).

Today, Suzy and me went out for dinner.  We tried to get Janna to come too but I guess she was at work or something cuz we never heard back from her.  I'm going to call Janna though and see what she's doing on Friday afternoon.  I haven't spent time with just her (without Kira) in forever!  But anyways, back to dinner.  We went to Ming Wah and it was sooooooooooooo good.  We both agreed that we ate too much but that it was well worth it.  Then we went and walked through Zellers and I was going to buy the new Alanis Morissette CD but I had left my debit card at home, so I think I will pick it up tomorrow or Saturday.  After that we went to the dollar store and I finally got a dream catcher, I've been wanting one for a while.

Then we came back to my house and poor Suzy had to sit and watch me play Tomb Raider then we went to her house and watched Shrek and now I am home.

I actually had an awesome day today!  It was nice going out for dinner with someone other than Chris for a change, you know?  Not that I don't like going with him :)

OMG!  I got some pretty good news lastnight, well at least to me.  I found out that they're making a live action version of ""The Last Unicorn""!!!!  That's like my favorite animated movie ever!  I love it!  Maybe I'll pick that up tomorrow aswell, hmmm...  But they're getting all the people who did the voices in the original animated version to play their characters in this new version!  I'm so excited.  Now I just have to find someone to go with me.  

Well that's that, now I'm off to play some more Tomb Raider!"

"event","One week till Harry Potter!  Woo hoo!!!!  Thank goodness for Meggie and Chris or I would probably be going by myself....  I've decided that the majority of my friends offically suck.  I can't remember the last time a single one of them called me to do something.  I mean sure, if they have a question or they need something they call me but not one of them, aside from Meggie, Tammi or Margie have ever called just to say ""hey how's it going?""  I'm tired of always having to call them to hang out or making plans with them only to call them on that day and be told that they're not home.  Yet they then have the audacity to tell me when I'm upset about something ""Oh you could have called me"".  Bullshit I could have called because they're never there or the subject somehow gets changed and we're talking about their problems and mine is completely forgotten.  I'm annoyed and quite frankly, pissed off with the lot of them.  So basically my point is that I'm through with worrying about how everyone else is, I'm through with calling them to say hello, I'm through with making plans with them only to be ditched when the next opportunity presents itself to them.  I'm just through with it all.  But I guess I've just come to expect it and as pathetic as it is, I've gotten used to it."

"event","Well, I have just had the perfect night.  Chris came over around 11 and we watched some Gilmore Girls and cuddled and had kisses and he was quite firm that he was going to be leaving at 1.  Well, 12:45 rolled around and he was like ""If you put another GG episode on, I'll stay till the end...""  So we put in the next disc and we watched the first one on that disc.  When it was done he got all ready to leave and we went out on the front porch and gave each other a kiss and a hug and I commented on how nice it was outside.  So he told me to go put on my shoes and a sweater that we were going to go for a walk.  I assumed we were just going to walk to his house and then he was going to drive me home - this is what he told me - so when we started walking the long way, I knew something was up.  When we got near the school he pulled me in the direction of the playground, a spot which has special significance for us because it is where we shared our very first kiss so many years ago.  So climbed up on the jungle gym and he walked me to the exact spot where he kissed me for the first time and proceeded to tell me how beautiful I am and how happy I make him and how much he loves me and then we just kissed for like 10 minutes.  It was perfect.  PERFECT!!!!"

"event","Today has been a mix of really great and really REALLY shitty.  The day started off awesome.  I went to watch Myah and was greeted (for the first time I might add) by smiles and laughing instead of colicky screams.  Then the bomb was dropped - so to speak.  When Tammi came in to drop Sydney off she told me about the baby.  There is a very good chance that her baby will have serious birth defects.  I guess she is producing too much amniotic fluid and that can cause spina biffida amongst other things.  Right now, the best case scenario is that she has gestational diabetes and will have to stay off her feet for the last couple months of her pregnancy.  Basically, we're all praying that that's all it is.  I've never seen her so upset.  She just cried and cried and the rest cried right along with her.  Stuff like that is sad in general but when it's someone that you know it's a million times worse.

On a lighter note though, today was Lion King day.  The play was great!  It was so amazing the way they did the animals.  They deviated a whole lot from the movie, but it was still really really.  I really liked the fact that the main cast was made up of all black performers.  I thought that was in keeping with the African setting.  It was just so good.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  And after the show was just perfect.  It was all cuddly and romance (I went with Chris BTW) and just plain wonderful.  Perfect end for the day I'd been having.

Anyhow, I just really want to get to bed and hopefully start fresh with a better day tomorrow.  I'm probably gonna go see Tammi and make sure she's doing ok and then Chris is coming over after work to finally teach me to play Tony Hawk Underground.

Well, let's all keep Tammi in our thoughts, shall we?"

"event","I have re-discovered the awesomeness that is Alanis Morissette.  Sure, her last couple CDs weren't that great, but the new one that's coming out this month is soooooooooooo awesome!  It's not all spiritual and blah blah blah.  I'm so happy.  I think I will actually purchase it.  Not on the day it comes out because the new Tori DVD also comes out that day and I can only afford one and well, I must prioritize!!!!

I'm feeling pretty shitty right now.  I mean I already felt really bad about not going to Suzy's Girl's Night lastnight but then tonight she called and asked if we wanted to go and watch Pat sing and I didn't go.  She sounded pissed.  I hope she didn't take it personally.  It was just that Chris and I already our night all planned out *wink, wink* (hence the mood icon) and we were going to watch my Gilmore Girls DVD and just cuddle afterwards.  I don't think either of us really felt like going out.  Had she mentioned it YESTERDAY then I probably would have went because I would have known that I had to actually DO my hair today, ya know?  I just hope she's not mad at me.

It was weird tonight though.  Chris was all like take your top off all slow and sexy like.  I couldn't do it.  I feel like a nerd.  I think I would have to have a couple drinks before that.  Speaking of drinks!  I had the yummiest chocolate mandarin martini and Moxie's the other night!  If Suzy's angry with me then I am definitely going to bring her there and buy her one!!!!  And some calamari and chicken wings and bubble tea...  boy do I hope she's not mad.

It's been raining here for like the last week.  Only at night, which I guess is good, but it's starting to bug me.  I open my windows to go to bed cuz it's hot and NOT raining and I wake up with my feet soaking wet cuz the rain came in my window.  Not cool. 

Well, I suppose I should go and get my pants out of the dryer now (all wet from the rain) as I am a teensy bit cold sitting here in my skivvys."

"event","I must start off by saying R.I.P. Manta-Ray.  My fish died lastnight :(  I'm very sad.  He was a good fish, a posh fish, but a good one.  I shall miss him.  I haven't quite decided yet whether or not I'm going to get a new fish.  I want to, but I'm still pretty upset about this one.  He was the only one that lasted longer than 2 days.  I had him for 6 months....  shit happens though.  I'll probably have a new one by the end of this week.

But on a lighter note, I got my Gilmore Girls Season 1 DVD for a super price!  We were selling it at work for like $55 and I got it for $39, what a deal!  It's really good too.  I had never seen all the shows from season 1.  I'm excited for seasons 2 and 3 now.  And Tori's new DVD comes out next week and then Lord of the Rings.  May is always such a good month.

The Friends finale was this past Thursday.  I cried.  I'm just SO glad that Ross and Rachel ended up together.  I was disappointed though that they didn't bring back Carole and Susan and all the parents for the finale.  But at least Gunther was there, I love him.  Fraiser ends this coming Thursday.  I'll be sad to see that one go aswell.

Tonight was ""Girl's Night"" at Suzy's.  I couldn't go though cuz I had a family thing.  It was nice hanging out with all my cousins.  I had a good time.  I just hope Suzy's not mad that I didn't go since Janna ditched her aswell.  I wasn't ditching though, I really couldn't go.  My mom wouldn't let me, she thought it would be good for me to see my cousins.  I'm glad I went, I couldn't have had a better night.

I'm going to go and watch some more Gilmore Girls now.  There's nothing quite like witty cracks at celebrities to make you smile :)"

"event","Suzy didn't end up coming over Friday afternoon.  I suppose it's just as well, I was a bit tired, but it would have been nice to hang out.

I hung out with Janna tonight.  We watched 10 Things I Hate About You and then Saturday Night Live.  We talked throughout most of it though, of course :)  It was nice to see her, since I hadn't in a while.

I spent lastnight at Tammi's.  Margie was there aswell so of course I got to spend some time with Myah (who I get to have ALL DAY Tuesday, I'm so excited!!!!)  I can't get over how much she is starting to look like Sydney.  And her little personality is changing every time I see her.  Margie and Keith are having problems though, which really sucks.  Everyone knows he doesn't help out with the kids or housework or anything but lastnight was just the END for all of us.  She was just outside playing basketball with Nate before he went away for the weekend and since Keith can apparently not take care of Myah when she's crying he came to the door screaming and swearing at her because he wanted to lay down and she was outside and blah blah blah.  That's why we went to Tammi's.  I feel really bad for Margie, but what can you do?  We've told her how we feel, but it's really up to her.

I can't decide whether or not I want to have cappucino.  I probably shouldn't because it's 3:30 am but I dunno.  I'm trying to stay awake to watch this Friends special on Star but I know that if I drink a cappucino I won't sleep till like 5.  I'm going to go and debate with myself..."

"event","Today at work we all found out that our hours are going to be cut ONCE AGAIN.  That's the second time this week.  First it was because Marcie was coming back to cash and now Heather is coming back.  And of course they both get full-time so that pushes us part-time people down the seniority list.  Personally I think that if they decide to switch departments they should have to start back at the bottom of whatever department they've switched to.  But that's just me.  And then, to make themselves look even dumber, they have finally decided to give Laurie and a bunch of others their orientation.  Laurie has been there for over a year.  She got hired with me.  They're so stupid at Zellers, I swear.

I saw the new Bif Naked video today.  Oh brother.  Bif has totally skanked out.  She's was all rubbing her tits and I was just so disapointed.  At least the music is still good though.  But I don't know why she's changed her image.  I think a lot of fans who really loved what she stood for (myself included) are going to be upset.  Hopefully it's just a phase.

I'm so excited I have like all of next week off.  I work Monday and then Saturday.  That gives me the whole week to get my other stuff done.  I have to pick out all my accounting courses and go and spend some time with Myah and Margie since I haven't seen them in FOREVER!!!!  I'll probably start cleaning out my closet too since me and my dad are finally going to be ripping out my organizer from like the 70s.  It's starting to fall down on its own, it's pathetic.

I feel like a pretzel and a blanket because it is frickin freezing cold down here!!!!.  I think I'm going to have one (a pretzel that is) and then watch ""Love Actually"".  Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Alan Rickman all in the same movie.  What more can you ask for?!

I hope Suzy's still coming over on Friday...."

"event","*Stretch, yawn*  Well, it's 6 pm and I'm only just waking up now.  Pretty pathetic huh?  I don't know what's up with my sleep patterns lately.  I'm tired around 2 am but as soon as I lay down, BAM I'm awake.  And then when I finally do fall asleep, I wake up every couple hours and it takes me a good hour to fall back to sleep thus resulting in my sleeping the entire day away.  Sigh.  Oh well.  Hopefully I'll be out of this pattern soon and back to sleeping normally.

I haven't been up to a whole lot of late.  Just working.  I came home sick from work on Saturday.  It was really weird.  I was fine but then all of a sudden halfway through my shift I started to feel really dizzy and nauseaus.  So I asked if I could go home cuz I could barely even stand and my supervisor was like, do you think you can stick it out until 8.  She seriously wouldn't let me leave.  I had to keep running back and forth to the bathroom cuz I felt like I was gonna puke.  Plus, we were like CRAZY busy so it just sucked all around.  It took me most of the night after that to feel batter.  I was still running to the bathroom all the time.  Chris came over and we watched Roger Rabbit and Finding Nemo.  We watched Kill Bill, Vol. 1 on Friday night.  Good movie.  Bizarre and bloody, but very, very good.  I think we're going to go and see Vol. 2 now that Chris has a new job.  I'm looking forward to that.  Dinner too, he says.  We'll see...

I'm going to see Prince in July, that's exciting - well for me anyways.  I'm going with Laurie and two of her friends.  I get to take the train and everything!  WOO HOO!  Wow, I'm boring.  It doesn't take much to excite me :)

I think I'm going to go and take a bubble bath now and then paint my toenails again.  This nailpolish chips pretty easily.  Damn Hillary Duff.

Good lord.  My work just called.  It's like 1/4 after 6 now, the last shift is 6 - 10 and they want me to come in.  I think not.  I'm off to the tub!"

I mean she looked like him when she was born but holy shit is the resemblance uncanny now.  And she's very smart.  I read these interviews that she did and it's like wow.  I just can't believe she's going to be 12.  *Sigh*  I suppose all this has come about since it was afterall the 10th anniversary of Kurt Cobain death on April 5th.  I wish I could have been in Seattle for that.  I heard it was a good time.

ANYWAYS...  I had a pretty good day today.  I worked.  I got to make a granola bar display, don't you all wish you had my job? *eye roll*  Apparently though the first time it wasn't good enough so I had to take it down and do it all over again.  It was not fun.  And it just seemed like a long night.  Liz went home early so I was stuck with Stephanie until Savo finished garbages then it was ok :)  After work I went to Chris' house and he made me this really good ham sandwich.  It really wasn't any different then when I make it except that the mustard was sweet onion instead of just plain.  But I always like food better when someone else makes it for me.  Then we snuggled and talked and then he let me drive home, YAY!  I've been driving lately.  I'd like to maybe have my G2 by the end of the summer.  I just have to get registered for driver's ed.

I started my music theory studies this week.  It's really REALLY boring.  But hey, if I want to go to school for it, then I've gotta know it, right?

Boy it's really cold down here.  I think I should have kept my sweater on because it is certainly not tank top and underwear temperature in this basement.  But I'm off to bed anyhow so I guess it doesn't matter."

"event","Mmm.  Fish Day!  Today I was fortunate enough to enjoy not one but TWO seafood dinners.  Well, the first one was more like a lunch but whatever.  I had halibut around 4:30 and Sydney enjoyed most of my french fries.  And then, the piece de resistance!  I had SO many crab legs.  They were so good.  I went with Chris to his Aunt Sally's (which was more fun than I thought) and crab legs is what was for dinner.  And then we watched Return of the King and some hockey.  Then I had bubble tea again (which reminds me I must bring Suzy to this place!).  Tonight I decided to try the mango variety.  It was alright, but chocolate banana is oh so much better.

And to top off my awesome day Chris and I had an awesome night.  We rented a movie but never ended up watching it.  It was ""Duplex"" but I think he's just going to copy it and we'll watch it later.  Instead we cuddled for like 4 hours.  It was wonderful.  Just the perfect kind of night.

Now I'm off to bed because tomorrow I get to paint kid's names on chocolate Easter eggs...  Woo hoo ;)"

"event","Today was a very good day indeed.  I actually got some decent sleep lastnight so I was able to get up and watch Ellen and Regis & Kelly.  Then I went to work which I was expecting to be dull and boring but we were actually REALLY busy so it was quite fun.  My aunt and my cousins came shopping today so I got to see them and I got a nice shiny new Hillary Duff pedicure set so I am excited to do my toe nails tomorrow.  I just hope the nail polish it came with is actually good.  Not like the Disney crap.

Anyways, I was a bit upset after work cuz I was looking forward to spending some time with Suzy and we ended up not but it actually worked out better because my friend Crystal is home for Easter and I got to hang out with her.  It was so nice to see her, she's changed so much and I hadn't seen her is soooooooooooooooooooo long.  Her, Janna and myself went out for some Bubble Tea (but they were out of bubbles, so me and Chris are going tomorrow! YAY!) and then we watched Cold Case Files (I think that's what it's called) until 2am.  It was a bit gruesome.  This mom killed her two daughters and all this crazy stuff.  It reminded me of Flowers in the Attic, which reminds me that I have to email Crystal and tell her that VC Andrews wrote Flowers in the Attic.  I'll do that when I'm done here.  Once the show was done Crystal drove us home and then I talked to Chris on the phone and he helped me fix my computer and we watched Untalkative Bunny.  And now I am writing this.  It's 4:15 am right now and it's odd because I'm not tired.  I just had some chinese soup and it was good.  The other chinese food was a bit funky though :P

Well, I'm going to go upstairs now and put on some Tori and attempt to fall asleep.  I need to be rested for Fish Day tomorrow.  Well, more like crab legs day, but it's all good :)  Until next time...."

"event","I haven't posted in a while...  I think the last time I posted I was a teensy bit angry :)  Well, that's worn off as it always does.  Things are seemingly better between Chris and me now.  SEEMINGLY is the keyword there.  I think there is still a lot of unresolved stuff but who knows?  I've decided thought that I'm not going to let all the pot smoking get to me.  If that's what he wants to do then fine so long as he keeps it separate from our relationship which he's finally begun to do quite well.  So who knows, maybe things are finally going to improve.  I do know however that we had some pretty damn good sex the other night and things have been better ever since.  That sounds bad doesn't it?  We talked things through first, so never you worry.  But all is well.  It was funny actually we went to Adult Connection and they had a big chocolate penis!  I kind of want it because I think it's hilarious, but something tells me my parents wouldn't think so.  They also had a bag of tiny chocolate penises which I though were cute.  And chocolate boobies.  Those stores are always funny.  But moving on to things that probably don't make you blush ;)

I haven't been up to too too much lately.  I got into a car accident with Suzy last Friday.  It wasn't too bad.  No one was hurt - well my back is hurt, but that's neither here nor there.  It's getting better though.  On the Saturday I could barely even stand.  Janna came over and I felt so helpless because she had to do like EVERYTHING for me.  We had fun though, we watched a movie, ""Thirteen"".  A very good movie, I would recommend it to everyone!  Oh!  I've got huge bruise on my boob too, which sucks.  I guess that's from the seat belt, that's what my mom says.  I hate car accidents.  I'm just so glad that we ended up not taking Sydney with us.  I would have been devastated if she had gotten hurt.

I saw Tammi today.  She's doing well.  Looking more and more pregnant every day.  She's beautiful though, although she doesn't feel it.  I'm anxious to see this baby.

Myah's doing wonderfully aswell.  She'll be 3 months old this month and she's absolutely adorable!  I can't wait to see how her little personality develops and teach her the ins and outs of being a girly girl ;)

What else?  OH!  I got a new CD.  Rasputina - Frustration Plantation.  I hated it at first but after carefully re-listening to it I found that I love it.  It's a lot different from their previous releases because there are new band members but it's really good.  I wish I could go and see them on April 17th but they're playing at a venue that's like 4 hours away.  Next time.  I also got a new book.  I've decided I'm going to read The Chronicles of Narnia.  That way I will know what's going on in the movie set to be released in 2005.  Very exciting!

Gilmore Girls is finally coming out on DVD aswell so I will have to get that aswell as new stuff from Tori.  A concert DVD with a CD featuring 6 previously unreleased songs.  And all us Tori fans thought we weren't going to see anything from her this year!  Hopefully 2005 will bring a new tour.

Well, now that I have rambled on about anything and everything and it's 2:30 am I think I will say goodnight.  I have to work tomorrow (not looking forward to that AT ALL!) and then Suzy is supposed to be coming over for a bit.  And then Friday is FISH DAY I always love a good excuse to eat lots and lots of seafood ;)

I'm off to watch 30 Minute Meals! Nighty night.

Wait, before I forget, I must also thank Suzy and her good friend Matt again for helping me with that ridiculous Tori lyric scramble lastnight.  Thanks guys!"

"event","So I don't know what to do about Chris anymore.  It seems that all we ever do anymore is fight.  Like tonight I tried to tell him that's he's really been acting like a jerk lately and he basically said that my feelings are stupid and don't matter.  Like, what the fuck is that about?  Of course, we ended up having sex anyways cuz that's me, but whatever.  I've been so torn lately.  I want to end things with him but I don't.  We've been together for almost 4 years but it seems like he's just willing to throw it all away and wouldn't even be upset about it.  I do still love him and he says he loves me, but like I've told Suzy, someone who tells you that they care about/love you shouldn't treat you like shit.  I've tried talking to him to try to work things out but he doesn't want to listen and he doesn't care.  I'm always upset when I'm with him and I rarely have fun anymore but I dunno.  All my friends say to just break up with him but then there's Suzy (who I tend to listen to more than the rest because she's smarter) who says I shouldn't do that because we've together for such a long time.  I just wish there was some way that I could make him see what a fucking prick he is."

"event","I had to sign up for a new journal because apparently my old one got erased or whatever, it's just not registering my login info.  So this shall be my new one!  Today was a pretty good day I guess.  As good as it can get when you're not doing anything.  I watched the two Lord of the Rings movies - my new stereo speakers make them even more exciting! - and my boyfriend came over.  That's pretty much it.  This past week was fun though.  I went to Suzy's house last Sunday since she was feeling pretty down and I brought my ""Bag of Fun"".  It just consisted of junk food and chick flicks.  We found out that one cannot pop microwave popcorn in a conventional oven (despite the fact that it gives conventional oven directions on the bag!) so we walked to the corner store and got the guy there to pop it for us :)  He was very nice.  There's always something crazy happening when I go to Suzy's house.  Be it her hammering mishaps or the popcorn.  Speaking of Sozan though, I totally found her birthday present yesterday.  I saw it and I said to myself ""Suzy must have that!"" so she will :)
Now, today I found out that my other friend Meg's mom apparently thinks that Meg is some sort of slut or something.  Clearly her mom doesn't know her own daughter very well at all!  I don't even know what to tell her.  Her mom is just mean.
I suppose now I will go back upstairs and try to figure out something to do tomorrow.  Janna is busy, Suzy and Meg are both working and Chris shall be at a wrestling event...  maybe I'll have a spa night.  Who knows?

Cheerio!"

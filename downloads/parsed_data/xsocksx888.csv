"event","oh i cant believe school's gonnA start this monday. damn i am sooo nervous. to me the summer went by quick. but maybe its best that school starts anyway. it gets really boring at my house and i dont have a job so i need something to do. im really excited about guitar class. i really want to learn how to play. but im nervous about lunch. i know im not gonna have lunch with you Cassie so that only leaves me with a few more options lol. but yeah things will be ok. well Ingrid left thi morning. i had to wake up at 5! can you believe that i was so like ""ew!"" lol. but i had fun while she was here. there was some things that happened that made me like irritated i guess. like when it was her, the twins and i hanging out at my house they would always talk about spanish music and other spanish crap. and it really botherd me.  i felt sorta left out because thats not my area of expertise. its like you might as well catogorize me as a white person lol. but i hey i like who i am. im like a coconut. im brown on the outside,(well more like tan lol) and white in the inside =) but she had fun while she was here, and i had a pretty decent time too. oh yeah i went to the library today and i saw this girl there that goes to our school snd i remember her from my science class last year. i always thought she cute...sorta. and believe or not i think i a saw her few times this summer. today i saw her in the library, yesterday i saw her at the open house-oh and we were both wearing the same skirt lol. and the first time i saw her at Khols a while back ago. i dunno why i brought her maybe it because she's knows Megan. yeah...Megan and i aren't really doing as well as i hope, actually we're not really doing anything lol. and i was all excited that she remembered me from voleyball and all, and thats all she had to say. i got all upset, but im over it. hey i got the whole school year. oh yeah i got one last thing to say. i think im in love...but its someone i actuall know i cant have. my favorite band Paramore happens to be, well my favorite band lol. i absolutely love them, especially the lead singer Haylee (um i thinks thats how you spell her name lol.) but i was watching mtv today and everytime they went to a commercial you'd see paramore. i was all happy. thats the only reason why i watch mtv. i never watch mtv im always watching fuse but i cant watch fuse because since i changed my room i never got a chance to run a wire for the satellite. uh...i dont even think that made sense. but yeah i love Paramore and i really love Haylee! hehe"

ENDED!! yeah can you believe it? it ended for good....god im so upset lol. you probably dont really care lol but yeah.....you wanna know what im doing though? im watching reruns. i got both season 1 and 2 on dvd....yup. that what did on sunday. watch the O.C.. i finished 1st season now im off to the 2nd lol. i call it JAR'S O.C. Rerun Marathon lol. you wanna know why it ended though? it ended because the ratings were low. i guess when they killed Mischa Barton off in the 3rd season, nobody cared for it anymore. i thought 4th season, which happened to be the last, was good. it was much better than 3rd,in my opinion of course. i hated 3rd season....it sucked!!! my favorite has to be 2nd season though. yeah it was good....especially when some chick named Alex showed up. god she was hot!! she was bi in the show. her and Mischa went out on the show. yeah Mischa was bi....on the show of course....or wait im not sure if their both bi in real life but yeah.....their both hot. well now Mischa is really pretty and Alex is hot lol. well you know.....actually no. Alex isnt really pretty in real life. the way they had her on the show was hot. she was kinda this punk rock chick but yeah i just that this lj isnt going anywhere lol. your probably thinking ""what the hell...nobody cares"" lol. i do that alot actually. i just talk and talk and talk about one thing. sometimes.....like this morning when my mom was taking me to school. i forgot what we were talking about lol but she said ""what the hell are you talking about....shut up."" she didnt say it like it was meant to be mean....she said it to be funny i guess. i laughed lol. well i gotta go....i have homework to do."

Hey old man in woman's shoes 
I wonder if he knows I think he's crazy 
When he was young did he have dreams of wearing woman's shoes 
And being crazy 

It makes me wonder when 
I grow to be that age 
Will I be walking down the street 
Begging for your spare change 

Or will I grow that old? 
Will I still be around? 
The way I carry on I'll end up 
Six feet underground and waste away... 

When the old man was in school 
Did the golden rule make him go crazy? 
Or did he hide away from hopes 
Behind a smile and smoking dope 
It's crazy 

It seems so frightening 
Time passes by like lightning 
Before you know you're struck down 
I always waste my time on 
My chemical emotions 
It keeps my head spinning around.





who wrote holden caulfield? 
Album: Kerplunk! 
Written by Billie Joe Armstrong 

A thought burst in my head
And I need to tell you
It's news that I for thought
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago?
I think I just forgot
Well it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad

There's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
there's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up or he's gonna end up quitting

I shuffle though my mind 
To see if I can find
The words I left behind
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago?
Oh well...
Nevermind


dont you just love those songs? they remind me of myself."

"event","i havent gotten a chance to come on and thats why i havent updated in awhile. so yeah its funny though, i had so many things to say, but i cant remember lol. i'll try though.....hmm...lets see.....oh yeah! i know what i can talk about. i wanna talk about my weekend. i went to Tampa this weekend to go see both of my baby cousins. baby Alex who was born last Thursday wasnt doing so well when we were there. he has trouble breathing so they had to stick a tube through his mouth so it can help him breath. when i went into the nursery to see him i got so damn depressed when i saw him. the way he was just lying there breathing really fast. i wanted to cry when i saw him.....it sure as hell made me sad. and to make it worse, when i was in the nursery, there was another baby in there that wouldnt stop crying. usually when i here a little kid crying i get annoyed because they cry because they didnt get what they want or something like that. but this was different.....this was a poor little baby that had something wrong with it. that made me even more upset if you wanna know the truth. baby Joey my other cousin....damn is he growing up fast. he turned 1 in december 5th. and boy is he a big boy! but damn he's becoming a pain. he's kinda a cry baby now and he never likes to take naps when he's tired. oh well...we were all like that at one point. oh yeah! i rememberd another thing. i was invited to another birthday party last weekend but like i said i was in Tampa and i had to miss it. it wasnt the first birthday that i missed. i missed Sully and Susette's birthday party on account of my stupidity.

i think im getting sick. my throat hurts and i've been caughing all day today. i thought i was gonna throw up earlier this morining especially with aerobics and all. but i was good. you wanna know something funny? im not sure whether i like 1st period every tuesday and thursday. i say that because Megan in there and her locker is right in front of mine and sometimes when she doesnt dress out she's sitting on the bench right were my locker is at. sometimes i wonder. why do i like her?


the girl who is unknown

dont know what i see in you
but i know that it is driving me mad
your the one that i blame 
for my misery
strange how things go
you're the one i've been
falling for
i dont know why because
your filled with mystery

maybe its insanity
and im just losing my mind
but every time i see your face 
my heart begins to race 
i just dont know why

everyday its the same old thing
i see you standing there
with people i dont know
cant find the courage to say hello
i dont think i know how
because when i try
nothining comes out
maybe its time to let go

everyday i stand here alone
why do i adore this girl who is unknown?

Hey there lookin' at me 
Tell me what do you see 
But you quickly turn your head away 
Try to find the words I could use 
Don't have the courage to come up to you 
My chance is looking a bit grey 

Starting across the room 
Are you leaving soon? 
I just need a little time 

What is it that drives me mad 
Girls like you that I never had 
What is it about you that I adore? 
What makes me feel so much pain 
That makes me go so insane 
What is it about you that I adore? 

Starting across the room 
Are you leaving soon? 
I just need a little time 
What time? Wow!!!! 

Why did you have to leave so soon? 
Why did you have to walk away? 
Oh well it happened again 
She walked away with her boyfriend 

Maybe we'll meet again someday 
Maybe we'll meet again someday 
Maybe we'll meet again someday 
Someday!"

"event","ok so i've haven't been in a good mood lately. i dunno why.....i really dont and it depresses the hell out of me. and speaking of depression my friend Anthony asked me whyi was always quiet and look so sad and the same thing with that fat chick on the bus.....um i dunno who she is but i know she's in my algebra class, well yeah she ask me pretty much the same question. i dunno....i never realized that i looked depressed, i always thought that i looked ugly but there's really no difference. but anyway like i was saying i haven't been in a good mood. especially on monday. i felt like dropping dead. or just fall into never ending darkness. when i got home on monday afternoon i felt like i had my own private bar....just without the smoking. i had my music blasting loud and im sitting at my little breakfast nook thingy having a few drinks. i drink when im really depressed, and boy i was really depressed no kidding! i just felt so damn lousy that day. it kinda continued on the next day but i felt a little better in 5th period but still. today wasn't half bad if you wanna know the truth. i talked to somebody that i haven't talk to in while. it was weird in a way. maybe it because i haven't talked to her in a long time. that always happens though...well to me at least. if you were to put me back up in NJ with my old friends....boy would i feel awkward as hell no kidding! when friend comes back down to cape coral this summer.....i dont think i'll be able to talk to her the way i do. im crazy....i know it too. but im just really shy. but anyway im gonna talk about the people who are begining to bug me now. lets take Ryan for example. he likes me but i dont like him like that if you wanna know the truth. in fact im starting to like him less now because he wont stop being so damn annoying! but he thinks he's a ""straight up G"" and im like whatever. its getting old now. and just because he thinks he's a ""straight uo G"" he curses after every other word he says. i mean i dont have a problem if you have a potty mouth for a day but he just goes out of contol! he'll say crap like ""fuck you jennifer!"" and im just like ok. i dont understand why he does all that crap for when he wasnt like that when i first met him. and i dunno why he likes me. i mean look at me! gross! who wants to be with somebody like me? and besides i wouldn't go out with him if asked. nope. it wouldn't even last for long. it'll be like the 2 day relationship that i had with jensen. which by the way i really regret saying yes. but that why it last 2 days lol. but yeah.....here's another thing that he does that annoys me. he wants to know why he's not my best friend. im like because i already have best friends and i dunno i just couldnt explain it to that kid. but i think i hurt him though. its kinda funny in a way if you wanna know the truth. i didnt mean to but, i was just being honest. ok ok ok! enough about him. here goes another person that annoys me. lauren. still haven't settled that little problem i have with her and ryan. she's running away from me and now i know who to  believe. i believe ryan but i really wanted to see them both talking to me together. but i guess that'll never happen. stupid pregnant bitch! she's nothing but a liar. she came up to me one morning asking me for gum and i told her i needed to talkt her and she said that she couldnt because she had to take a test. yeah right! i think that she's only making worse for herself...she just keeps on lying to me. one day i'll catch her and i'll tell her striaght up that i never wanna talk to you again....or some tough shit like that...i dunno. i'll think of that when im talking to her lol. i know....im lame. but anyways...my final person that i think is the queen of annoyances....sam. i stopped talking to her along time ago, but damn she still annoys me. i have to sit next to her 5th period....and she sits around me in 7th period. she's so damn loud in 5th. you should see her. i thinks its because i stopped talking to her and all she wants is attention. she'll look at me every so often. i think she just wants to see if i'll come around and start talking to her again. but i wont. she's too bossy. nope im not gonna deal with that again. i had to talk to her today though, because christina wanted me to tell her about the locker incident. and in 7th period me and ryan were talking about lauren. and he goes ""lauren isn't the type that would get pregnant....but you! i bet your pregnant right now"" im like oh im pregnant and sam quickly turns and looks at me but i just shook my head. you see stuff like that turns me off! ryan and his stupid comments. i mean i cant fall for you if your not there to catch me....and let me tell you he's very far from catching me. but honestly i wouldnt fall for him. besides the wore holiday, well actually its made up but yeah that damn holiday is coming and im the least bit excited. a me no likie lol! i dont...no kidding. i'll do what i always do....i'll just join the lonely hearts club that day lol!"

"event","dont know where to begin about whats been going on. maybe i should start off about what happened to me today. ok so it all started in the morning while i was sitting in the cafeteria. Lauren came up to me and did the usual, which is ask me for a piece of gum and ask me to go help her find her boyfriend...oh joy. oh yeah but i stopped walking around with her because it really got on my nerves but anyway....she had a little extra to say today. she goes to me ""i was talking to Ryan on Friday and he was asking me if you were a lesbian."" so i go well i think i might be bi. and then she told me that she told him that i was bi. but she said that she was kinda scared to tell him because she wasnt sure she should tell or some shit like that. i really dont remember the exact words. i was pissed off at Ryan, but believe me it doesnt end there. then she tells me that Ryan tells her that it was ok that i was bi because he likes me. i dont think i've mention this in a previous lj but this boy Ryan likes me. and i feel like he makes so obvious because everybody knows and that pisses me off! im sorry but i dont like him like that. i only like him as a friend. but anyways i was shocked about what Lauren was telling me. so she leaves and i wait for Ryan. and then he tells me a whole different story. his side of the story is that Lauren told him that i was bi and he never asked about it. and i told him straight up to his face that i might be bi. you should've seen him, it was like he was having a panic attack. he was like ""no! no your not! i dont believe you!"" he was so damn shock that it felt like he didnt like me anymore. but i was so confused at the moment. i really didnt know who to believe. i feel like i cant trust them. and to make it even worse my friend Christina told me another story. both Ryan and Christina are in my history and she told me that Ryan told her that i was bi. im like what the hell! so i had to confront him yet again to see whats really going on. i feel kinda bad though. because i was pretty harsh on him. as soon as he walked in the room i went off on him. he wasnt making any sense and his face was turning red, so he stopped talking. then i wrote him a note to explain things to me. and again he told me ""his"" side of the story. so im not sure who to believe and i bet this is all really confusing for you because honestly im quite confuzled as well. but all that dumb shit made my day! NOT! i was not in the mood for anything today. and to prove it, when i got on the bus today. some girl was in my seat so i chased her out. i know her kinda but not really. she thinks she know me because she and i are friends with Kathleen. but she doesnt. nobody knows me. i really dont wanna talk about that anymore. lets see im finally dressing out for aerobices and weights and it was fun. i need to get in shape so i guess i gotta do what i gotta do. i had fun in both classes. especially in weights. i needed help benching so i asked some kidfor help. he was really helpful. and so was that one girl that i thought was a bitch.but she wasnt. she was really nice. i only thought she was a bitch because she's a cheerleader but no. you should never judge a book by its cover because when you take a chance to know someone you realize its not what it seems. but anyway then some kid called me ""girly"" to get my attention. wow thats a new one. but he wanted to see if i could catch the medecine ball....um i think thats what it called. you know its that really heavy ball. it was a 10 pound ball and damn it was heavy to catch. but it was fun. then a few other people got into it and yeah...good times. haha the cute punk emo skater threw the ball at me. wow he looked at me lol! im so lame. and there another boy i like in there. i think he's cute. but he's not my type. he's like white boy gangster...haha i dunno how to describe people but yeah. i had my eyes on him today. i was kinda lurking around him today because i needed help benching. but i decided to go to the kid for help. so yeah that was day. cant wait till tomorrow. me Ryan and Lauren are gonna have a nice little talk. sorry Lauren's boyfriend dude...your gonna have to wait."

a short story about myself

lets talk about me
where should i began?
i'll start it off with
who i am hates who i've been
i dunno wht happened to the little girl who used to be so nice
she's a bitch now
so here's my advice....
stay away from me if you know whats good for you
because i'll end up breaking your heart into two
if im nice at first 
read between the lines
once we get closer into the relationship
i'll totally lose my mind
i'll let jealousy and anger get the best of me
im not that much fun to be around with as you can see
if you think we have a chance at being friends
go ahead give it a shot 
its a bad idea that will die out on the spot
if we're lucky things will be bitter sweet
but it wont last for long 
because i do everything wrong
you must understand
that you and i wont go hand in hand
because the little girl who used to be so nice
she's a bitch now
she's throwing away her life



outcast

i sit here alone
all by myself
i sit her alone
with nobody else

i think i know why 
why i act this way
i think i know why
why i have nothing to say

im and outcast
yes thats what i am
im an outcast
the one that doesn't understand
im an outcast
the one that cant tell bad from good
im an outcast
the one thats always misunderstood
im an outcast
the one that just wants to get away
im an outcast
because im not welcomed to stay
im an outcast
the one that always been too shy
im an outcast
whose final words are goodbye"

"event","my favorite band right now would have to be Paramore. my goodness i think they are the greatest! im sorry Green Day but i think you come in 2nd =(
i dont think the old Green Day will ever come back which sucks because thats when their music was great to listen to. but now their all political and shit and yeah. i like the old Green Day when their songs had to do about the band themselves. those were the songs i could relate to but i cant now. but that doesnt mean i wont buy their new album when it comes out. well...we'll see. but i'll still listen to them. but lets talk about Paramore. the reason why i like this band is because...well for one their songs are great and the lead singer is a girl who happens to be reall reallt pretty. i love it when girls are in rock bands. its different. well anyways school has been so boring. i hate aerobics! it bores the hell out of me. but whats good about it is that we've been in the gym lately ans guess who's there? megan! dude i dont know what it is about her but damn she makes my heart race and i get butterflies in my tummy. its just really strange how i dont know this chick yet i really like her. it kinda pisses me off. to be honest the first time i  have ever had any contact with her she was kinda like a bitch, but i've never thought anything of her at the time. i remember that a picture fell out of her binder so i decide to go pick it up for her. she kinda gave me a dirty look and she didnt bother to say thank you. i dunno why i like her all of a sudden. its strange. but enough about her i have a song to post! here's a Paramore song its called WHOA


WHOA

I've hoped for change, 
and it gets better everyday 
I've hoped for change, 
but still I feel the same 

There's something wrong, 
cause everybody knows 
That we can do this on our own 

And we've got everybody singing 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
We've got everybody singing 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 

We're doing fine 
And it gets better everytime 
We're doing fine 
But I'll let you decide 

There's something wrong, 
cause everybody knows 
That we can do this on our own 

And we've got everybody singing 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
We've got everybody singing 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 

And I'll confess 
That I can be a little selfish 
And I'll admit 
I don't want you to help me through this 
I don't want to start over again 

And we've got everybody singing 
And we've got everybody singing 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
And we've got everybody singing 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 

And I'll confess 
That I can be a little selfish, I can, I can 
And I'll admit 
I don't want you to help me through this 
I don't want to start over again"

Hey Jude


Hey jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.

Na na na na na ,na na na, hey jude..."

walking alone 
Album: Nimrod 
Written by Billie Joe Armstrong 

Come together like a foot in a shoe
Only this time I think I stuck my foot in my mouth
Thinking out loud and acting in vain
Knocking over anyone that stands in my way

Sometimes I need to apologize
Sometimes I need to admit that I ain't right
Sometimes I should just keep my mouth shut, or only say hello
Sometimes I still feel I'm walking alone

Walk on eggshells on my old stomping ground,
Yet there's really no one left, that's hanging around
Isn't that another familiar face?
Too drunk to figure out they're fading away 





this may be the last journal that i post. i'll still keep the name and i'll come on whenever but i dont really have anything to say. it wont matter anyway."

"event","bab's uvula who? 


I've got a knack for fucking everything up 
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up 
My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high 
I lose control and I get myself all wound up 
Tension mounts and I fly off the wall 
I self-destruct and I get myself all wound up 
Petulance and irritation sets in 
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all up 
Chip on my shoulder and a leech on my back 
Stuck in a rut and I get myself all wound up 
Killed my composure and it will never come back 
Loss of control and I get myself all wound up 
Blown out of proportion again 
My temper snaps and I get myself all wound up 
Spontaneous combustion 
Panic attack 
I slipped a gear I get myself all wound up 






words I might have ate 


Now it seems I can't keep my mind of you
My brain drifts back to better days we've been through
Like sitting on blacktop of the school grounds
The love I bitched about I finally found

But now it's gone and I take the blame
So there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?

Now I dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me... I am blind without a cause
And now I reazlied what I have lost

It was something real that I could have had
Now I play the fool whose stable soul's gone bad
Why?

Tell me the words I might have said
That's pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late?
Just tell me the words I might have ate. 


i fucked up again its all my fault! im sorry"

other than that, i guess im done....hm there is one thing....but...nah i wont say. it gets too much in my personal bi-sexual life.....uh yeah...."

paper lanterns 


Now I rest my head from
Such an endess dreary time
A time of hopes & happiness
That had you on my mind
Those days are gone & now it seems
As if I'll get some rest
But now & then I'll see you again
And if it puts my heart to the test

So when are all my troubles going to end?
I'm understanding now that 
We are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you

As the days go on I wonder
(will this ever end?)
I find it hard to keep control
When you're with your boyfriend
I do not mind if all I am is 
Just a friend to you
But all i want to know right now
Is if you think about me too.."

Everytime that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face gettin clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dust to dawn
Isnt that the way
Everybodys got their dues in life to pay

I know what nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know its everybodys sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Half my life is in books written pages
Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know its true
All the things come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, if its just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away
(x2)

Dream on, dream on
Dream yourself a dream come true
Dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on...

Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears
Sing with me, if its just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away"

Emenius Sleepus 
Album: Dookie 
Written by Mike Dirnt 

I saw my friend the other day and I don't know 
Exactly just what he became 
It goes to show 
It wasn't that long ago 
I was just like you 
And now I think I'm sick and 
I wanna go home 

How have I been, how have you been 
It's been so long 
What have you done with all your time 
And what went wrong 

I knew you back when 
And you ... you knew me 
And now I think you're sick 
I wanna go home 

Anybody ever say no? 
Ever tell you that you weren't right? 
Where did all the little kid go? 
Did you lose it in a hateful fight? 
And you know it's true"

all your twisted thoughts free flow
to everlasting memories
show soul
kiss the stars with me
and dread the wait for
stupid calls returning to us to life
we say to those who are in love
it can't be true 'cause we're too young
i know that's true because so long i was
so in love with you
so i thought

a year goes by
and i can't talk about it

on my knees
dim lighted room
thoughts free flow try to consume myself in this
i'm not faithless
just paranoid of getting lost or that i might lose
ignorance is bliss cherish it
pretty neighborhoods you learn to much to hold
believe it not
and fight the tears
with pretty smiles and lies about the times

a year goes by
and i can't talk about it
the times weren't right
and i couldn't talk about it

p.3 French II - Green
p.4 Drivers ed - Conn
p.5 Algebra 1b - Witte
p.6 Volleyball - Guttery
p.7 World History - Rowe

yeah so thats my schedule. i guess im pretty satisfied but i worried about French. i dont remember anything to tell you the truth. and whats worse,i got the same teacher. she's the worse! she's tough and she gave us too much work last year. imagine how she'll be this year. im in French II now!! wow as you can see maybe im not all that satisfied. oh well i guess i'll just have to see. oh and my bus stop is still the same. my mom gonna have to take me too school again because the bus picks me up at the same time too.oh i almost forgot! i got my haircut last week! uh...its ok...i guess. no no,to be honest,i dont really like it. i think its too short. first its was too long and now its too short! gee will i ever be satisfied!lol. well i thinks thats all for now.im not sure when i'll be back on though. but im hoping icould go on tomorrow night. but i doubt it  though."

"event","In you and I there's a new land
Angels in flight
I need more affection than you know 
A sanctuary
My sanctuary, yeah
Where fears and lies melt away
Music inside
I need more affection than you know
What's left of me
What's left of me now	   
	   
I watch you, fast asleep
All I fear means nothing	   	   
	   
In you and I there's a new land
Angels in flight

A sanctuary
My sanctuary, yeah
Where fears and lies melt away
Music inside
I need more affection than you know
What's left of me
What's left of me now

So many ups and downs
My heart's a battleground
I need two emotions
I need more affection than you know 
I need two emotions	   
	   
You show me how to see
That nothing is whole and
Nothing is broken	   	 
	   
My fears, my lies
Melt away
I need more affection than you know"

"event","Finally this is the last week of school! you dont know how happy i am. i am so glad its over. maybe if the school year didn't suck i  wouldn't want it to end,but yeah its over. i just took my English final and it was hard in the beginning and easy at the end. it was mainly about Romeo and Juliet. I'm gonna miss my teacher,she was really nice,well at least to me. you know how i said that i was gonna go to New York for 2 weeks,well i kinda dont wanna  go. you see my cousin came down a week ago or so and her my sister well they make fun of me too much. and yeahits ok once in a while because its funny sometime but it gets on my nerves. i know i shouldn't let it get to me but its annoying. oh! i told you that i was to Disney right? well we went,and it was good to have the whole family together. well we had fun,and i went on the rick n roll rollercoaster. i've never been on it before because i was scared to but know im not.wow i'm such a loser. no kidding! what can i do about it,everybody agrees. there was another time i went to disney and i found the most precious thing.it was the rose from the movie Beauty and the Beast,but it was glass.it was beautiful. i wanted to get it but i didnt know how much it was,and when i went to look at the price this little old man was hiding in the corner of where the rose was,and as i walked up to the rose, he walked away and i smelled the most horrible stench ever! the little bastard farted! i was so angry because it stunk and i never got a chance to see how much the rose was. i was mad. no kidding. Well other than disney, my mom and my grandmmom have been really upset with my uncle. they're mad at him because he's not treating his baby right. he and his girlfriend stopped feeding him milk and when they're in some place cold,they dont cover him up,and yeah they're really upset.i know one of these days there's gonna be this big arguement.oh great speaking of arguements guees who's coming back from Puerto Rico tomorrow. the bastard himself.my stepdad went to PR 2 weeks ago and its time for him to come back. im pissed.i hate him with a passion. but this ""hate"" word seems really harsh,but you know what-i dont care. hey i got a question. have you ever thought about somethin and all of a sudden you feel really anxious and frightened? thats whats been happening to me lately. i know its weird but im just wondering. after all it is me that we're talkiing about. i dunno thats just how i feel. well i gotta go."

"event","Hey! glad to be back on! uh......i wanted to come on last weekend but i had to babysit. and boy was that exausting. i had that kid...um yeah you know that kid and his little sister that came over for easter i told you about. well yeah they came over on friday and stayed the whole weekend. Damn he's anooying that little kid. not his sister cuz she's only a little baby but man little Hector,it seems like you gotta always make him happy. but i guess thats how little kids are. he's only six so yeah. i dunno. i think i was the same. if i didnt get what i want then i would scream and cry. yeah its probably a kid thing. its a good thing i didnt take that babysitting job or i'd be in big trouble. ok ok ok! enough about that. lets see school has been boring as hell! its really starting to piss me off. i know i always say that but i just cant help it. you know i wish it were last year. i really do,no kidding! then i wouldnt have to worry about anything. and i sure wouldnt have to worry about my best friend moving either! yeah my friend Ingrid is leaving. wow just thinking about it gets me upset. im gonna miss her so much. i remember last year when i was upset or mad she was one of the ones that made me laugh. and i when was happy,damn, me and her could go on forever. just talking and joking around. she was one ofthe ones that made last year so much fun. now that she's leaving, life will only get worse. my life at least. i dunno. teh day she leaves is the day you'll see Jennifer cry. i dunno why im talking in third person but yeah. i dont think i've never cried in front of my friends. i cant remeber if i cried wheni left my school in NJ. i dunno,i cant remember. but yeah thats life. omigod! i know something that can keep me on the upside. i think in two weeks my cousin and her mom are comin down. im excited as hell cuz i havent seen em in quite awhile. we're gonna go to Disney when they come. yeah call me pathetic call me what you will i dont care, i love Disney! i dunno there's something about that place that makes me have so much fun,unless somebody ruins the moment and pisses me off. but the thing about Disney that i dont like is that it can be really crowded and the damn tourist will just stand in the middle of the way and block traffic. they're trying to figure iut where the hell they're goin,so what do they do,they stand in the middle of the way trying to find out where they're goin. that really pisses me off. you know,i really would like to talk more buti gotta get off. if not my sister will band me from her computer,and i dont want that to happen cuz i would like to come on as much as i can. so yeah. goodnight."

"event","I'm not part of your elite
I'm just alright
Class structure waving colors
Bleeding from my throat
Not subserviant to you I'm just alright
Down classed by the powers that be
Give me loss of hope
Cast out... Buried in a hole
Struck down... forcing me to fall
Destroyed... giving up the fight
I know I'm not alright
What's my price and will you pay it if it's alright?
Take it from my dignity
waste it until it's dead
Throw me back into the gutter
'Cause it's alright
Find another pleasure fucker
Drag them down to hell"

"event","ok i got a green day song for you and usually when i post a song its for someone special but not this time its for kaylee. well here you go kaylee just something to say that i'm over you. and this isi exactly how i feel!



Standing on the corner of
Stuart and the Avenue
Ripping up my transfer
And a photograph of you
You're a blur of my dead past and rotting existance
As I stand laughing on the corner of insignificance
Destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it's all fucked up
Seasons change as well as minds
And I'm a two faced clown
You're mommy's little nightmare
Driving daddy's car around
I'm beat down and half brain dead
The long lost king of fools
I may be dumb
But I'm not stupid enough to stay with you 
Destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it's all fucked up
We're all fucked up
You're all fucked up"

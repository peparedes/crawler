Tears streaming down my face
I look at you but your not looking back 
Your staring off into the distance
Waiting for me to stop crying
So we can pretend this never happened
Forget it like every other problem we have
But i cant take it anymore
When will you ever be there for me
I have always been there for you
But when i ask for you to return the favor 
I get the door slammed in my face
I cant wait much longer; i wont
And ive learned to get by without you.


idk i guess i like it a bit but well im confusing myself i gotta go eat first day of my diet! yippie now im gonna look aneroxic(major sarcasm) i hate benig thin and being on a diet i love my food.*tear*

Lately ive been getting back into things with friends, like i went to the schools spirit bowl this sunday and hun out with julee jenna and well julees other friends, and saturday i walked up to the library and then to erics house. when i was finally forced to leave i went to tim hortons to get fat and i got a free coffee hehe i should be starting to work there after i turn sixteen this may and i cant wait its an excuse to get out of the house and ill have money lol. well im off ttyl.

valentines day sucked too. i didnt get to see eric and cried all night for that, but it was a good excuse for the most part he was spending it with his mom. he was gonna come n see me first time to the house in 4 months!! but well... he fell asleep and never came and well it sux to remember cuz well its makin me cry again. PLUS krissy got dumped by her boyfriend which really sucks becuz hes dumb and was a waste of her life in my oppinion. i just wish i could be with eric now he makes me feel so happy but i dont think he realises it to the full extent. 

well im gonna go now gonna cry n take a bath heh. toodlez yall"

40 - 59: You have a positive attitude... somtimes. You prefer to see the world through clear glasses, not rose colored ones.

20 - 39: You have an average attitude. You take the good and bad in life as they come. Though sometimes you could use a little more good.

0-19: You have a negative attitude. You tend to see the dark side of every situation. Free ice cream? No thanks, it will just make you fat!

in this dream its all nice n peaceful as i sit in the truck with my mom n sister waiting for someone. soi get up and walk down the street and for no apparent reason eric is right in front of me walking twoards me so we chat n giggle like everything is fine(because it is) and then i guess we get in an argument about something stupid i cant even remembber im soout of it but anyways were arguing n he asks me to meet him somewhere later n i tell him i have no idea where it is and that sets off another argument and in the end i get rreally mad and walk away when whoever is driving him around pulls up by my  car and he pops his head out of the sun roof and i can remember the dialouge perfectly
""do u still love me""(eric)
""just sit down and drive away, eric""(me)
and the look on his face was what scared me because he looked so sad that it made me sit in bed and cry for about 20 min b4 i came to write it out and i know to u people it may not seem that bad but it bugs the shit out of me cuz my dreams almost always come true its like forshadowing in my life and it scares me shitless and thats why i usuallt dont sleep days like today. well i sure as hell hope i dont loose eric and i learned not to always ask him if he loves me and to just know it. well im out to gohide away in my room til around 11:00

lately ive found myself being mmore and more depressed and not even the best of my friends can help me out with becoming normal again. i really miss spending time with eric but i understand that he has things to do to and i cant control his life. kinda like whats going on with krissy and dan yesterday krissy skiped a karate party to go and see dan but he blew her off to go hang out with jake and jill at extreme wheels and today she was supposed to see him but he ditched her again to go snowboarding with cox. so i guess tomorrow there going to spend the day together and if he tries to say he has other plans im gonna get to see her and thats only if i dont get to see eric which with my luck hell already be busy. 
(new subject nothing depressing anymore)
i met stephys boyfriend yesterday and hes a cool kid james is interested in a lot of the same music as me which is a total plus (dont worry hun hes all yours). him n steph look so cute together and they were together for a long time it was so cute to see them sittin there just cuddiling on the work out equipment (it wasnt dirty) but i guess they get along really well and i love the fast that they do i dont wnt steph to get hurt and i hope she doesnt. and another new couple has his the streets dun dun dun da shirleen n erik i think that there gonna be a hard couple to follow =) hehehe dont worry tho i wish u guys all the best just dont move to fast!!!!!!!!!!! lol im just kidding well im finally off but i guess it doesnt matter seeing as no one reads this anyways well

FUCK i just hate everything im constantly screwing up now and even if he doesnt say it i know im doing it. i love him to death and more than he knows and now it seems like were falling apart. it used to be that we would talk on the phone every night for hours and now were lucky to talk for 5 min and b4 when i used to break down he would be there to support me no he just lets me cry and ignores me that doesnt help at all it makes me cry harder and we get in fights for some of the dumbest things and its always my fault, because im insecure about myself it brings me down i say something to him he gets agitated and i end up feling worse and cry there for a while and hell just come back to me after ive stoped and am staring into space the well i take him back because he didnt do anything wrong. sry guys g2g ill finish later

"event","ive been thinking so much lately about everything about my family and friends and espically my boyfriend. i hate these long breaks because well i hate being away from him. these breaks tend to scare me a little because well i never see much of him and im so insecure of myself that i think im gonna loose him. he never calls as much as he used to and well i dont think weve had a good conversation in a long time. the holidays completely depress me and i still dont know why. i guess its just that i never feel like in worth it listenng to my dad there are so many ways i can supposedly improve but its not possible i cant just change the way i feel about things or people at that. and now ive depressed myself more than i thought possible seeing as its only the day after x-mas i just hope that even tho i didnt have a great christmas i hope everyone i love did. i dont really know how anyone is doing but i guess it doesnt matter the only people i talk to on the phone are the ones who actually love me at least thats how it seems. putting it that way makes me seem really horrible but seeing as theres only a few people i talk to i guess theres eric, kris, and steph. well i g2g dad is kicking me off talk more later

"event","have you ever hurt the one u love so badly that it breaks your heart to look at them? well just recently ive done that lately and it sux. Lately all i have been doing to eric and even tho he says im not screwing up i know i am, but some of the things he gets mad at me for he does to me and that hurts. so grrrrrrrr. well anyways we got in a tad bit of an argument (one that weve had many of times) and well when i cry i dont want anyone to hear me so i put the phone down well i did that and cried for a min or so and well when i got back i felt even worse because i made him feel so bad. he started apologizing saying everything was his fault yet i started it and i just couldnt take it and now i dont know what to think i guess were ok but i feel really bad about how i acted and i guess he heard me cry which i hate because i dont like to cry in front of people, and well i dont know i guess this isnt very interesting so im gonna leave you to do your thing. talk to yall later

"event","i seriously can not stand the way my boyfriend acts sometimes. i mean i got in a fight with him about his trust, or in other words lack of. no matter what i do there is no way that i can earn his trust. also after making up from that fight we get into aanother one because well bbeacuse im depressing and he well he got mad because i was talking to his friend about SEX of all things. i just finished talking with him for about an hour on the phone i mean its our longest phone conversation since october and it was all fighting and crying and stupid stuff like that. i swear i cried so much today that if u gave me a bucket id fill it over 10 times. i love eric and i think that after this fight were going to be a whole lot closer because well because he seemed to listen and i really listened to what he had to say i needed to hear what i was doing wrong so now i can make it right. as a matter of fact some of the things he said were so mean it made me cry. he actually called me psycho. i swear i cried for like 10 min straight while he was on the phone and while i put him on hold for like 5 min and then for about 30 min after we hung up and i swear i could not forget about how he called me psycho. thinking about this is making me cry again which is never good. erik said i could break my promise once and he would forget about it because he knows how i feel. i know what i want for christmas but nobody can get it for me. i want all of my problems to go away. i just want to get rid of all the pain that ive created for myself. well ive got to go now and continue my crying and figure out a way to be able to start speaking to him about anything and everything. i want to make this work so badly so i have to go and work on damage control for this relationship. comment if youd like u dont need to tho."

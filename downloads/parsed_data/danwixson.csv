Here's what happened: me and my friends were hangin out in the courtyard, and we were gonna go through side doors and walk around school (even though we weren't supposed to). Well, a couple girls were pushing against the doors so we couldn't get in. I tried running into it so it would open (it had one of those things you pushed to open the door). It didn't work, and my friend says he wants to try. Well, he runs and fucking DROPKICKS it and gets it open for a second. The girl was shocked, and a couple teachers came out and yelled at us, and my friend got in trouble."

If I stop being a smartass, then I probably won't make that many friends in school because i'm shy and I don't go outta my way to make friends."

1) A new T.V. My T.V. (a 28"" I believe) is messed up because most of the channels are fuzzy. I'll probably just get a flat screen 13""

2) A new stand for the new T.V. I don't need a huge stand for a small T.V.

EDIT: Fuck it, i'll just using my computer as an alarm clock from now on.

3) Some C.D.s

4) A NES controller for the computer

5) An adaptor that allows me to play SNES games on my computer

And if I have any money leftover:

6) A flat monitor. I saw a really cheap one at Wal-Mart.

Hope everyone's havin' a great summer."

Anyway we have checked a few places, we're just going to finish our lease here and move mid november, really hoping that there will be some specials at the time.  Until next time, continue rolling with the punches...until you have and opening then break his nose, the bastard. lol ^_^"

There is a moth living in my room.  His been there for about three days.  Now you may be asking yourself why.  Why?  Why is there a bug living in my room since most of you know I am the enemy of most  creepy crawlys?  The answer is simple.  It keeps flying away before I can spray the bastard with some deadly chemical.  All I can hope for is that it will die soon and leave me alone.


I saw ""Ice Age :The meltdown"" today.  It is such a great movie.  A little slower than the last one.  It needed something more.  Sure I was laughing through the entire movie, but it didn't feel complete to me.  I don't know, just watch it and I'll think of the words to say when I am fully conscience.

"event","I went on a bit of a movie spree this week and went to see ""V for Vendetta"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes.""

    Now let me just say that I did not finish ""The Hills""  I walked out after and hour and fifteen minutes.  This is due to the fact that they were raping one of the girls.  It was a disgusting scene.  The two men were laughing and raping this girl and then they started petting the infant.  It was not horror it was disgusting.  There was no reason for them to rape her.  And it's not like the scene was short.  oh no, they just kept going for few minutes all there was, was rape.  I could have dealt with them simply beating her to death and ripping her to pieces.  It was a total violation of the senses.  Not only could you see her struggle try to protect her body with blamkets but you could hear it.  Every painful noise she mad in time with the abuse.  Sorry, I had to leave.


     On a more positive note I really enjoyed ""V.""  It was like ""the phantom of the opera"" mixed with ""1984.""  Really good.  Definatly something worth seeing."

I also gave in to one of the urges of my inner child.  I bought the first season and and part of the second season of ""Gargoyles.""  What can I say, it was an awesome show and I still love it.  It was fun to watch. ^_~"

I really haven't had the chance to watch any anime since I left for New York.  It feels good to tap into one of my intrests again.  Though nothing can compare to a good book.  That reminds me ""howl's moving castle"" was a book by a british author named Diana Wynne Jones.  you should definatly read it.  Unfortunatly I left my copy in NY, *sob*.  Anyway,  go and see this movie it is awesome."

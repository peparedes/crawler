"event","this is making me crazy and i'm getting a little irritated with its inconsistency and the inablity of certain someones to be clear and well-spoken.  that's all i've got to say. that's all i've got to say.


Short note about this: Certain friends of mine don't know how to play freaking hide-and-go-seek.  (only one of them gets to see this and that is A.J. and he's a dork anyway)  sorry guys.  And Brooke BTW, i don't hate you, i'm just always mad."

"event","Yeah, I realize there is no excuse for missing classes. Too bad. that's okay and we'll all live after it happens. K. I love you all. Especially my classes. I love the whole entire flippin world. I love you. But everyone just has to accept the facts. No one will ever do what you want them to do. Nothing will ever go your way and that's the way life is. It works that way and if you dont get over it then its your own problem. just some advice: have faith in failure. it will always happen. now... im pissy and ready to kick some butt. im sick and i feel like i could die. i can't breathe and i cant eat and i cant see i cant walk. i feel like a piece of crap. and NO i wont go to the DOCTOR because they're evil. i don't care. just leave me be. don't bitch at me, don't try to bitch at me cause i'll spit in your face. just believe me when i say i love you and everything is fine. because it is and you know and i know it and we'll all be fine. no more of your petty games. just shut up and take it like a man. i love you. i really do love you ."

"event","In Sunday School, they were teaching how God created everything, including human beings. Little Johnny seemed especially interested when they told him how Eve was created out of one of Adam's ribs.

Later in the week, his mother noticed him lying down as if he were ill, and said, ""Johnny, what is the matter?""

Little Johnny responded, ""I have a pain in my side. I think I'm going to have a wife.""
  This is a Beliefnet joke. I had to put it here.


I figure maybe if I make this a happier place for me, then I wont get so pissed off when I have to write in it. Love the joke. or i'll feed you rotten macaroni salad."

"event","Okay so we're doing this thing about research.  We are looking at three example sites.  We must de ide whether each is credible or not and back up the reason.
I chose the section on HIV and AIDS.

The rifst site looks pretty credible. It appears to be formal and frequently updated. Also because it is sponsorted by the UNITed nations.

The second site isn't credible because it is a personal site. Its not credible cause the guy has bushy eyebrows. no really, but because its a personal site. dump tee dum.



                                 chicken





The third site is not credible because it is a personal site as well. it doesnt look formal o ranything like that. 

This was a repeat kind of activity from my 1550 class. My teacher then gave us a whole lecture on crediblity. for example, martinlutherking.org.  hahahahaha."

"event","I wasn't in class on Thursday. OH well. missed the part of 30 days or whatever. oh well. in regards to research? well, i guess i'll research the effects of exercise on well-being. maybe i'll research something else. Not sure. Seriously and honestly, I'm not sure. I DON'T KNOW. I get really irritated whenever I write in here. I think I hate it. 

I don't know. I don't know I don't know. I just don't. I'll figure it out sometime though.  Life isn't supposed to be so complicated. In fact, life isn't supposed to be complicated at all. Eat, poop, pee, sleep... die. But I guess I'll figure it out sometime.

Sorry. Mood went terribly sour. Terribly Sour."

"event","I think this will be an awful project because I hardly have any ideas. I'm a little irritated at the moment so that makes me hate this project.  I want to go to bed because it kind of bores me.  Now that I am actually doing something and not just sitting here like a bump I guess it is an ok idea. I have to really think, but I feel way too lazy to think about this.

What do I do now that could change?  Well I am not going to stop eating the way I eat. I refuse.  My food is my food and I like the way it makes me feel.  I will not change my belief system because if it is anything butj Christ, its not going to get me anywhere. I clean obsessively and I could stop cleaning but my urge to clean is so strong I dont know if I could do it. I think I will try though.  It is a good idea because it will not only give me time to be lazy, but it will teach my stupid family to do some work instead of letting me do it all. Good idea, Lauren!

Ok, then I'm going to stop cleaning for two whole weeks. Only now there is a problem! HOW AM I GOING TO RESEARCH THIS? IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE. Now that I am confused and lost and there is no way to research this I'm angry again. Whatever.


Whatever.

Whatever.

Whatever.

"event","<font color=""green""><font size=""5"">I don't know what to say because there weren't really any guidelines. I guess we are doing some kind of opinion thing. One paragraph. Today is Tuesday. It is the month of January.  The date is the 23rd. I am doing this for English class. The girl to my left is very nice. The kid to my right is kind of weird. Livejournal is confusing and I am confused.  I wish I knew what a USB port is. Humphrey. I just bit my cheek and it is bleeding and it hurts. *complaining*</font>

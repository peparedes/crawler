Will leave me broken, sore and stiff
But it's the genie at the bottom
Who I'm sucking at, he owes me one last wish

So here's a present to let you know I still exist
I hope the next boy that you kiss has something
Terribly contagious on his lips

To drink for forty days and forty nights
A sip for every second hand tick
And every time you fed the line ""You mean so much to me""

The American boy you used to date 
who would do anything you say

She'll find some way to disappoint me
By not burning in the wreckage
Or drowning at the bottom of the sea

Jess, I still taste you 
Thus reserve my right to hate you
And all this empty space 
That you create does nothing for my foolish sense of style

It's 8:45
The weather's getting better by the hour
I hope it rains there all the time
And if you ever say you missed me then don't say you never lied
I'm without you

so ive been much happier lately. dont know what it is but ive been having a really good thanksgiving break. wednesday night i went out to courts then picked up mel n met billy at coldstone where he proceeded to get into a fight with this like 40 yr old woman. good times i must say lol. then we went back to court and watched sumthin that was really funny but i cant remember what it was lol. o well. 
thanksgiving was good. it was the four of us and my bro and i laughed so hard like all day just like old times. my parents werent in a bad mood at all during the day and that was amazing lol. 
last nite i worked. it was iight... besides the fact that it got busy round like 5 and didnt stop til bout 8 but hey.. thats what u get for working in a restaurant. some indian lady came in a was aimlessly walking around saying she was looking for a hospital and then she like laid down on one of the tables. lol. that was kinda scary and then a huuge ass fight broke out apparently but i wasnt there to see it cuz of course the one time i go upstairs to give sumthin to a waiter. ugh. but everyone said that if i was standing where i usually am, i wouldve gotta hit with glass so yea lol... im thankful for that.  
so yea im late for work. go me... i better get going. gotta work til 12 then going to courts after.

usually its customary for people to talk about you behind your back... or at least somewhere where the person cant hear you and its not too obvious. its really not a good idea to talk about them when they're sitting right next to you at the lunch table. o yea and whispering? ... yea that makes it a little more obvious... sry guys, but you blew that one. but the best was when i turned to the two of you when you were whispering and u stopped talking until i turned away again... haha that was priceless. hope you guys enjoyed that lunch yesterday cause i sure as hell know i did. and dont think i dont know what you were talking about because I do. so thanks for keeping it from me.

When I was ready and willing, you were gone
The infamous line ""It's not you, it's me""
Well that bullshit doesn't work on me

Sometimes I think that you lie for fun
You fake the words that come outta your mouth
You say things like ""I'm sorry if I hurt you""
If that were true, none of this would have happened

I want so bad to be able to say something to you
But I'm so damn stubborn and I dont wanna be the one to break
It's your fault I'm acting like this
It's your fault I feel this way

up until the point when i got home
then it all went to shit like it always does
sometimes i think i should just keep my mouth shut about how i feel
but i thought it was the right thing to do this time

and now i dont know what to do
i cant face you... i dont want to
i cried for 3 hours straight last nite
ive never cried that much before... all for one reason
i didnt get to sleep until 330

i woke up to go to church this morning for Eric's one year anniversary of his death
i saw his Dad and i felt horrible. 
for that half an hour i just thought how much everyone means to me
and how ill never know if one day, all that could just disappear and that scared me
he looked so upset
and i thought... why am i upset?
look at the tragedy that happened to Eric's family
then look at my situation and how miniscule the goddamn problems are
i can only imagine what they've gone thru this past year

i hope i'll never have to experience that kind of pain.
i dont know what i would do if i lost someone that close

I remember when i found out a year ago that he died
i cried because id known him for so long 
and i thought of how real it was and how that could have been my brother

when i was sitting in church this morning, i was talking to Eric in my prayers
and when i closed my eyes, i saw his face
i remembered how at all the baseball games, he used to joke around with me
and for a minute, i saw that smirk on his face that he always gave me
who knew that 3 years later he wouldnt be here to joke around with and to give that smirk
you never think of that stuff until something that horrible happens

Eric, all day i thought of you and i thought of how lucky i am
I thought how lucky i am to have such great friends and family and people that care about me
I know you're looking down on us everyday and i hope you love it up there
We miss you so much.
There's not a week that goes by that I don't think of you
Keep looking down... cause that makes me feel safer to know ur up there"

We had a study hall in homeroom this morning where me stina lauren n vern talked about the village people and yea lets say mauser thought we were fucking nuts lol. but its all good. so we had shortened periods today thank god. cuz i cant stand regular pds. i slept in bro garys math class today. that was good. slept in study hall, in spanish, me and chris got in trouble lol. cuz we ""talk too much and everday is like an ongoing conversation""... okay mrs albano... w/e u say. lunch was iight. religion, umm we found out that we're not having human development classes anymore bc.. well i really dont know why. he didnt explain it that well. but all i know is that sometimes we're gunna be doin the development stuff in religion class. so it all works out iight. history. o man i just love solosky. he tells me that mikel is all smooth and shit tryin to put the moves on me lol... hes just fuckin hysterical. then i had study hall 8th pd. its kinda funny when shit happens in there and mauser gets pissed off but when its dead, its just boring. then i had physics with mauser which is always funny cuz merced is there. but mikel came in the class and i got called down to the deans office. she asked me where i was 9th pd yesterday. and i told her i was in my physics class but for sum reason she decided not to believe me and stare at me for literally 5 minutes to try n break me. n finally i was like mrs trentacoste i swear i was there. and she was like well the attendance sheet doesnt tell me that n i was like well i guess u coiuld mauser so yea thats what shes gunna do. n i went back to class and told mauser but the old bastard didnt remember anything from yesterday so that should be good times tmrw. took spanish club pics after school and then drove anthony home. its so weird how we can just talk bout absolutely anything. hes like my best guy friend i swear. and i kno he reads this so I LOVE YOU ANTHONY... and yes u have a hott car lol. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>so tomorrow my homeroom has a special mass in the millenium room. and yea thats supposed to be ""cool""? so we shall see. but my mom is contemplating whether or not i should go to school cuz my aunt n&nbsp; uncle r comin in tmrw. and she needs help round the house... and she wants me to do my college essays. so we'll see. thatd be hott if she let me stay home. chances are shes gunna be like lemme ask ur father. then its all shot to hell. so w/e i gotta work from 4-9 tmrw nite neway. we'll see how that goes. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>iight. thats all for now. im happy cuz someone new has come into my life and they're really funny/cool so yea we'll see how that works out in the next couple of days. lets ljust say i almost cried tears of joy in the hallways this afternoon cuz i was so overwhelmed. lol... anthony knows bout that haha</FONT></P>

"event","tuesday. hmm gotta love em.. or not

katina was can we say just waking up when i got to her house this morning? yea.. so she was like iight whatever, jus go without me, so i went to get chrissy and kat calls me right when im pulling up to chrissys house... ""umm ashley? are you still in the nhp vacinity?"" wtf?! lol. so i went back to get her after chrissy got in the car. got a spot in the lot thank god because i wasnt walking in the rain from the back of school this morning otherwise i wouldve killed katina. then my shoe almost fell in a sewer.. the damn loafers suck at staying on my feet.

ummm homeroom was okay. me n mike arent talking. what a surprise. i wonder when that will stop. i have a feeling its gunna last a lil longer than usual. o well. cant let it get to me. so i did my physics hw n talked to lauren. 

english- mr dugal sucks . i fall asleep everyday in that class. too bad i sit in the front which sucks. but he loves me neway since i had him for soph english. + merced sits behind me n katie is next to me.

precalc- yeaaa the most boring class of the day. bro gary is totally senile (sp?) and he wont let me make up my test from oh yea bout 3 wks ago? so ill be getting a 100 on my progress report lol score

then i had study hall where i have to listen to katherine n merced discuss their guy problems all period. yes.. welcome to third period study hall when ryan hunter walks in and winks at me? lol i kno i was confused too

then the dreaded spanish arrives 4th pd. where i had a test. but that class is a joke because i have matt chris n laura n usually ryan there but he was on retreat today so he missed the damn test. stupid bastard lol.. jk. the test overall wasnt that bad. part two sucked tho cuz even tho im really good in spanish, i cant write or speak it for my life. 

then lunch. where i got clean up afterwards cuz mr beyrouty is an asshole. and said that i shouldnt be eating my lunch on the way down to lunch thats what the cafeteria is for? who gives a shit? honestly

then christian existence/human development- we watched a beatiful mind.. part 4 i think. i love that movie soo much i cant wait to see what happens. 

umm 7th pd american history with solosky. where he picked up my binder with all the pictures on it of melissa hoolding a fuckin beer lol. i was like fuck fuck fuck... danielle turned around n i was like praying he didnt say nething. but he said they were cute? lol ooook solosky... i hate that class but i love him

8th pd health. dont even get my started on this. brendan conners starts off by saying that housewives have it made and they never have to do nethin but put the kids to sleep or in front of the tv and just do whatever they want. i mean who the hell says that when half the class is comprised of girls? come on now. n then brendan collins says that he's anti- feminist. i just wanted to throw a book at him i swear. all that was really funny in the class was ryan burgos in the back the entire time with his little girl laugh. man hes 
awesome lol

and then the worst class of the day- physics- although i suck in that class, i have merced n matt in there to keep me company and all i do is laugh the entire time... maybe thats why im failing? yeaa that might be it lol. but mauser loves me. and hes gunna give me a fuckin C on the prgress report.

which by the way, we should be gettin friday or saturday? and yea i will die by then . my mom will flip a shit when she sees my grades. o well.. ill bring em up by xmas

thats all for  now. ill update tmrw or sumthin

Waiting on my floor, litter in my shore
This is the last true burning letter
Given to a girl
Written by a boy
Living in a world created to destroy

But if I build you a city, would you let me?
Would you tear it down?

But there you go for the last time
I finally know now what I should've known then
And I could still be ruthless if you let me.
But there you go when I'm not done
You're waving goodbye
Well at least you're having fun
The rising tide will not let you forget me... forget me

And this is the ghost that kneels before me
Reasons on her tongue, a body full of oxygen
It won't be the last time she'll ignore me
The thinning of my skin will have the strength to go
The winter set it in you
To cover you in snow

But if I build you a city, would you let me?

Rivers and walk them
Oceans to drown in
You won't make a sound and....

i know ill always have my friends to talk to
ive been told that plenty of times before
i believe it too but ...

its not that i dont need them because i really really do
its just theyre not who i want
i look in here every day to see who has commented
and every day i wish that he just fuckin looked at it

its come to the point where i get my hopes up too high
and every day i come home crying
im not exaggerating at all here
EVERY FUCKING DAY
all i do when i come home
i sit in my bed for a good hour and just cry
its pathetic really
because theres days i just never wanna wake up 
Theres nights when i wish i dont wake up in the morning

i dont wanna see your face every day
some people say that they wish others were dead
well i would never wish that upon anyone.. or you
id wish it upon myself before you anyday
so all this pain would just go away

if you were gone, id have more pain
some days, i think id be better off just looking down on everyone
there hasnt been one day this whole school year where ive actually not thought about you
and you know that kills me
it kills me everyday

To get this over with today
The ribbon's been wrapped around my finger for so long
It doesn't mean a thing to me
This is a note to self: you only hurt yourself
So pick your lines up off the shelf
And put them to good use, not one more excuse
It's time I wish you'd just say sorry so I don't feel so guilty
I've put it off for oh so long
You can't tell me that I'm wrong 
For being scared and just not prepared with no lines to turn you off
And I'll be tomorrow's news as the one who's just been bruised
All on his own, I'll be so alone
But this massive weight will be off my shoulders
And now, as I put my heart on paper oh so carelessly
My blood stains the paper for the whole world to see
I'm still sympathetic, and feeling so pathetic
Can't even find the words to end it all
And again I stall just to end it all 
For now I'll keep the words in my back pocket
Someday, someday, I'll wipe the dust from them 
I can't promise this won't hurt"

<P>And it's gotten to be everyday when you just walk on by without any acknowledgement whatsoever. Yea, it starts to hurt after a while</P>
<P>And it's gotten to be every day when I just come home and cry because of what doesn't happen. I guess you don't see that it hurts more and more. Maybe you do and you just don't wanna do anything about it. </P>
<P>I just don't know what to do at all anymore. When I walk through the hallways every day, I feel like I'm estranged to everything around me. But then when you walk towards me, it's like there's absolutely nothing else going on. It's only me and you... and you can't even see me. </P>
<P>I'm beginning to hate senior year. Chris said it's just the first two months that feel like this but I have a feeling it's gunna be a lil longer than that. I talked to him for a lil bit online today. I miss him the most outta neone and he was the one that I didn't get along with. I think I've talked to him more since he's been away than when he ws actually here in NY. He's just really good to talk to about this kinda stuff cause... well, he's been through it already and he knows what he's talking about. </P>
<P>I just feel like I need someone right now. I don't know who but I know I need them. I really wish it could be him but I highly doubt that we'll ever talk again. </P>
<P>I need someone to talk to when I don't feel okay. It's hard to talk to people about what's happened cause they don't know everything. and if they did, I don't know how theyd react. I reallythink I 've changed so much since I 've met him but who knows. Nobody truly knows what happened last school year. nobody knows how i really did feel bout him or how i still do. its just really hard for me to talk to someone bout that. but i need someone to do that with.......</P>
<P>i jus need someone</P>"

"event","i hated this weekend

i just really miss you and i dont know what to do

i cant do it anymore

last nite i came home and i seriously just came online, changed my away message, went to bed and cried myself to sleep. it seems like this whole week, whenever ive come home from school, i cry. 

like the other day before lunch, leyna was waiting at my locker for me and she knew something was wrong and she asked me what was the matter and i didnt know what to tell her cuz i dont know whats the matter with me. 

i know it has sumthin to do with him but i dont know what. maybe its because i have no classes with him or because i see him like only twice a day, passing my in the hallway. i just dont think thats enough. i dont remember the last time i had a real conversation with him and thats what makes me upset. 

i dont remember. and it seems that thats all i can try to do is remember. he looks like a different person then the last time i saw him. and that scares me. 

i cant do this anymore"

"event","So I guess it'a really tomorrow that I go back to school. 

I think we all can agree that this summer has had its ups and downs. but overall, I think it was the best summer I could've asked for. I had an amazing time.
- i started a new job. and the people there are cool.
- i have a car now and thats jus fuckin great.
- me n court got really close and became rly good friends. better than we were before
- i read alot... which i have never done before
- tried new things
- i grew up

No matter what anyone says bout this summer, I 'll always remember it. All the good times and all the bad times. 
- x island hangouts
- driving to savers n other thrift shops
- harris volleyball
- playing ""power hour"" and gettin through 6 minutes lol
- sleepovers
- sneakouts
- napoleon dynamite
- the stop light dance
- summer hookups ;)
... and sooo much more

Tomorrow, I guess it's back to reality. I'm not gunna say that I've been dreading it, because I haven't. I've kinda looked forward to going back... seeing people that I haven't seen over the summer. like Seany, Mikel, Laura, Mikey, Scott, Tiffany, Kat.. and so many others... i really miss them
I'll have to see the face that I've been waiting to see for weeks now. And idk how that will end up. Probably nothing good, but who knows. It'll be weird at first, but good in a way because it'll finally be over for good and hopefully I'll realize that.

So heres to the summer and what its taught us. 

""Maybe I'm a little bit over my head
I come undone at the things he said
And he's so funny in his bright red shirt
We were all in love and we all got hurt
I sneak into his car's black leather seat
The smell of gasoline in the summer heat
Boy, we're goingway to fast 
It's all too sweet to last
It's alright
The summer's all in bloom
The summer is ending soon...""

Goodbye summer"

"event","<P><FONT size=2>There were so many things I already loved about him. The smell of his skin, always musky and sweet. His hair under my hands as I combed my fingers through it. The way he pressed his hand into the small of my back whenever I walked into any place ahead of him. He was so attentive, with one eye on me regardless of what else he was doing. Even with his back turned, he always seemed to know exactly where I was. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>He was quiet and never spoke without thinking. He drove like a maniac. The only time I saw the small simmering temper behind his cool demeanor was when someone was late or not where the said they'd be. He liked his brother and sister, tolerated his mother, and never mentioned his father at all. And whenever I pressed him for details about any of these things, he would sidestep me so gracefully that I could never find a polite way to ask again. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Still, there was something so strange and tender about those nights when I just sat with him in the car, my arms around him, wondering what had happened at home that brought him here, needing me so much. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Every time we were together, he'd drop me home, leaving the car idle for about ten mintues while we just sat there. He'd reach over, cupping my chin in his hand and kiss me. And as much as I hated to admit it, I felt that rush that always came when he touched me or kissed me, the one that made me feel unsteady and wonderful all at once. ""I love you"" were the words that always came out of his mouth before I opened the door to leave. I wanted to&nbsp; believe it every time he'd say it, but I knew i couldnt as much as I tried. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>But that was him. The person I'd always want to believe... as much as I knew it wasnt true or too good to last. </FONT></P>

Right as I turned my head to kiss him, there was a loud whooshing noise and the world suddenly lit up bright all around us. It was blinding atfirst, and frightening, like a camera flasg going off right in my face and turning the worl starry.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I pulled back from him and saw that I was sitting on a thin strip of white concrete, surrounded by&nbsp; DANGER DO NOT ENTER signs, my feet dangling over the edge into the air. He grabbed my waist as I leaned forward, still dazed and blinking, to peer over the edge and finally see the water I'd been hearing gushing past a full mile below. It was like opening your eyes and finding yourself suddenly in midair, falling. I tiwsted in his arms, terrified, all the noise and light and the world so far below us. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I tried pulling away but he pulled me back in, kissing me hard, his hands smoothing my long blonde hair, and I closed my eyes to the light, the noise, the water so far below us, and I felt it for the first time. That exhilaration, the whooshing feeling of being on the edge and holding, theworld spinning around me. And I kissed him back hard, letting loose that girl from the early summer. At that moment, suspended and free, I could feel her leaving me...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>He always found ways to surprise me and I would never tell a soul because it belonged to us and only us. Friends never knew of the things he'd do for me or tell me because they were for me. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I guess I have changed a lot this summer. I've grown up, tried new things and liked some. I've learned a lot too. I've learned that you have to make the best of these days and not waste them. I've learned responsibility and how to have fun. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Most importantly, I've learned that you can't always listen to what other people say. If I did that, I wouldn't have learned or experienced half the things I have this summer. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I think of this summer as a new beginning for me. People say I've changed... and yea, maybe I have, but I like who I've become and that's all that matters...</FONT></P>

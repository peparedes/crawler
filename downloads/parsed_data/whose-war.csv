"event","I'm going home. I'm tempted to stay home, but that's just because home seems better than it is right now. I think I've developed an allergy to the whole east coast. Maybe just to most the places I've ever been.

I have a perspective problem--either too much or not enough, or both. I can see til tonight and til next summer, but not next week, so next week is just this irritating thing keeping me from the real future. And I don't have the emotional energy to be around anyone or motivate myself. I definitely don't have the energy to deal with my lack of energy or perspective.

I do have the energy to go home, so that's what I'm doing."

Having an audience can make the self-reflection even more acute, since, as my interviewees noted, they&rsquo;re trying to describe their activities in a way that is not only accurate but also interesting to others: the status update as a literary form.</a>"

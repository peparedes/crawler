<i>take a breath to distort the fear in your eyes...</i> <b>i don't mean it to hurt.</b>

cait comes home sometime today.  whoopie.

i think i'm going to make an attempt to find cherise and get a little practicing in, before I end up falling asleep and sleeping my saturday away.

i haven't updated my journal in a while.  I haven't had the time, nor the energy to do it, i guess.  but i'll do it more often, as soon as my life get's a little more interesting.

yesterday Colin, Zach, and Rob scared the shit out of me around 8:30 in the morning, when they started tapping on my window.  That was some scarey shit.   They came inside and we chilled for a while.  I eventually had to beg to go pick up Cherise, but we went to go get her, then came back down here.

My mom's insanely mad at me for god knows what this time.  But I'm ""not allowed out of the house"" or something.  Haha.. right."

"event","I hung out with Marisa yesterday.  We slacked on the hair dying, but we went to the mall.  The mall with only ten bucks sucks.  It's too expensive to eat lunch in the mall, considering I never finish anything I get, waste of money, dammit.  Anyway.

We went shopping around for nothing special.  By the time we got done talking to Cherise,  Marisa and I were practically falling asleep while walking around the mall.  So we went into hot topic to look for some music, and stuff, but we ended up leaving there, and going to get some coffee.  The coffee was good as hell, I think I'm addicted to it.    I got black cherry inncence from spencer, too.  Then we went to say bye to Cherise, and headed back to my house.  <b>Cherise has the punk tribute to nirvana on hold for me!</b> that made me happy.  

We came back to my house, and as we're walking inside, I was pointing to the car in the driveway, telling Marisa it was my sisters.  But, I get inside, and my mom's like, ""that's your car in the driveway"" <b>MY</b> car.  I have a car.  Woo.

So, Marisa and I went driving around Brick, because we were bored out of our minds.  We went to walmart, because walmart is the shit.  We Marisa bought us MaryKate and Ashley Olsen make up.  That's funny shit.  Then we were going to go to Target, but they closed on us.  Lame.

So, we went to WaWa to get Marisa some ice cream, which is good shit.  Then we went back to my house, since there was nothing to do.  We made a bunch of plans for Skate and Surf.  

I'm happy I get to spend time with Natalie, Marisa, and my ""boyfriend"" that I share with Natalie, Keith, over skate and surf weekend.  It'll be fuckin rad as hell.  Plus, <b>Wakefield</b> is playing Sunday, which means they'll probably be in the same hotel as us, saturday night.  Which is cool as hell.  Fun times.

This entry was really lame...

"event","Yesterday was kind of chill.  I babysat my nephew until about 5.  My mom took me to the mall so I could get some.. outfit for a party.  I decided on getting a few other tank tops while I was there.  

Today I think I'm going to steal Cherise, and hang out with her, maybe?  Then go to the Stone Pony possibly, to see Dom's band, and Sean's band, I think.  Which should be fun.  I have to get some film to take some pictures of Dom's band.  

I have to write my english essay before my teacher kills me.  It's due Monday, and I haven't done much of it.  I don't have enough stuff to do it on, to begin with, so I'm going to have to bull shit my way through it.

Well,  I'm exhausted.  God knows why I'm awake at 7 in the morning, but I am.  I'm going to go do some more of my English paper.   I'll have to figure out what's going on with the show today.  I want to go, and I want to chill with Cherise, so it'll be good.

being grown up, isn't half as fun as growing up.

"event","Chilled with Cait today.  We went to the mall, in record time we shopped, and changed shoe laces in sneakers.  We came home, grabbed sweatshirts, and went to the plaza. We roamed for a while.  Got some candy, and went to B&N to read up on Shaun White.  Though there was only one magazine with my professional snowboarder in it.  Damn magazines and their lack of Shaun White.

So, we went out to diner.  Went back to Cait's, and played pool for about an hour.  I don't have any idea why I'm so tired.. but I am.

Oh, and I had to rush home and find clothes to wear tomorrow, and pictures for Cait.

"event",".... <b>No Use Looking Back</b>

I awaken every morning
To live each day like it's my last
Accept what the future holds
And not the unchangeable past
I reminisce of the mistakes
That I've made along the way
It's these simple acts of error
That shaped who I am today

When it seems your heading backward 
Or maybe just falling behind
Remember that life goes on
Because the sun will always rise

I'll never let myself get down
Wishing this happened differently
Moving on instead of turning back
At the time was best for me
There's no use having regret
There's nothing that can be done
It's the bumps along the way that made
The person that I've become



 - off to school."

Well.  My entry is kind of pointless.  But, I'm going to go steal these lyrics, (because I don't feel like typing them), much love to you, my cherise :-*, and post them in here.  Because they're so fucking true.

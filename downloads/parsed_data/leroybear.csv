<H3>

1) They don't like small spaces. Give them plenty of room, preferably their own room. Move to a bigger home if you need to.

2) They feed on Oreos, pizza and chocolate cake.

3) When entering a room where there is a Bear, acknowledge him with a greeting and, perhaps, with a pat on the head. You will likely be rewarded with a Bear hug.

4) Take your Bear on as many vacations with you as is practicable. Introduce him to all of your friends, family, business acquaintances, etc.

Muffin wanted Fred D. Bear to have some Oreos and share them with us, and my human got mixed up. He's so stupid you would think he had beans for brains. Hee hee hee!

Anyway, Muffin sent some Oreos for a picnic. My human said they and some Dr Peppers were for a picnic Muffin gave to him for Christmas, but my human is a little stupid. I am sure she meant the soda was for him and the Oreos were for Fred and the rest of us Bears. Anyway, we are enjoying them. Thank you, Muffin!"

"event","My Human put up his tree Saturday night, with Leroy's Fan Club members helping trim the tree again this year. I think they do that because all the Bears like the big tree. We Bears DO have a couple of trees of our own, of course, which we put up as well. I need to get batteries from my human to run the lights on the big one. Here is a picture of our little tree from last year:

We have Snickers and Milky Ways and Mounds and Crunch bars. My human likes the Mounds Bars because he is such a coconut anyway. Ha Ha Ha!"

To keep him from 'forgetting' us again, we will offer to help him pack for his trip and then stow away when he is not looking. Our human is so absentminded he won't notice we have disappeared!"

Next time our human buys Oreos, we will eat them all and not share with him. That will teach him. Come to think of it, we usually don't share them anyway. Tee hee.

Are all humans as stupid as ours?"

"event","here i am at the beginning again. it seems like it started all over, i hate having to go on but i know i must. listening to the songs that remind me of the first time. memories so fuzzy, my dream remains unchanged but i get nowhere. i always wait. no matter how far you feel away i know that your their, lim just ying to forget my lonliness. ive found two who ive felt something for but they werent feeling for me. their impact on my life will never be forgone and i never forget at 2:30 in the morning. i hope one day ill meet you, but sometimes i feel like im lying to make myself feel better, and those two will never comfront me and i hope they never will. but i get so scared that i will ever feel what i want and if i do it wont be right. nothing ever has been. and i sit so quiet and that all i and its sad. some nights i never feel i can be happy. this empty lonliness is all that i know and i get comfort from it. so tomarrow ill wake and probably move on, but its juyst my illusion. this pain of rejection never really goes away. i dont know if these are tears from cigarette smoke in my eyes or just self pity. i was told noone can be happy unless they are happy with themselves first, but that seems like another lie or maybe i just dont want to move on, sometimes i feel i cant. i regress into stupidity and indifference to ignore myself for a year longer. i just want to wake up feeling right but i doubt i ever will."

"event","today was one of the best days i have had in a long while. its odd because nothing outstanding occured but everything just seemed to fit perfectly. so i woke up feeling ok went to work where ben was the manager so that rocked. no bitchy customers got shit dont thier. got off work and went to hang with davis. along the way called up the other bob brian jon luke. so we had the makings of a bash. i guess timing work out so right that some people left but we went to tgi fridays to meet up with some other people. met up with about ten other people and low and behold (i hate that phrase not sure why im using it) it was my friend jeff's bday. so the whole group of people hung at fridays till they closed, so we all headed over to the DS where we met up with etienne and shawna as well. everyone was just it such a relaxed mood, there seemed to be almost no tension or drama. after a bit rachel katie dimitri and april showed up and everyone was hanging out having a good time. the mood in the air was just so nice. so as everyone began departing i was driving home and i realized i felt happy. this was one of the better days of my life."

"event","why is it whenever you have something to tell a person the situation doesnt allow for it. you know what you want to say and you know it is true you are saying. but when the clarity leaves the words are lost for the listener. i just hope things wont degenerate, i just hope we can still be friends. its just this pain in my chest the nausea in my stomach the torment in my brain. its all just too much for me. i just wish it would stop. that i could feel how i use to, that i could see it again. im just so scared of the answer, so scared of the decision that will be made. ive lived in a complete state of denial and when i see truth suicide is the only thing that seems an option. i was thinking of the my razor. i could lock the bathroom door and turn the shower on. noone would know till the morning. by that time i would be gone. i could just drive the car off the cliff and hope for the impact to kill. but im too scared. i have too much hope to do it. its the hope that makes me hurt. the hurt is just so much to bear though. i just want to lose hope. lose the constant striving to think something will happen. but today i finally realized. i saw through the denial, the fear, the lie. i realize i love you. it hurts even more just to think it. the constant stress in your life, the constant pain. and to add this to it. i feel so sorry to even think it. its just the pain is too much, the hope is too much. i know you dont feel the same towards me, but i need to say it. i need to not lie. the lie is caused by hope, but hope is false. nothing will ever come if i just hope. i dont know why i feel this, its just you are what i see. you are everything it seems. before i met you i never felt anything for anyone besides sexual attraction. their was never any sort of feelings of love. but now i feel something. it consumes me so much. i know stating this will cause more problems, i know this will destroy something. but i just need to say it.

"event","seems this whole year went by so quick. weird thing happened today my band sortof broke up. i say sortof because it seems so halfway. this how im told it broke down. drummer guy jon thought my atitude wasnt serious enougth so he said he was done but would still play with us, but we werent going to play any of his songs. kinda weird cause he left out the other people in the band even though he was the one saying that the band was a democracy but he proves it wasnt. so i guess its a twisted metaphor for life because noone really is equal in any way. theres noway of figuring a way for it to be equal. so people suck. i dont know where i got from point a to b in that but yea. people suck, cept rachel ben and davis."

the only time i didnt feel alone is when my family was whole but that became obliterated
and that was only a family love
that was the only love you needed when you were a kid
but im no longer a kid
my heart feels so empty and it hurts 
it hurts more than anything ive ever expierenced
i just want a moment
a moment in time that shows me that i can have love
something i can share with someone
someone i can love
if it is only for a moment, a second.
someday it may happen but right now all i have is my pain
it encompases me
it consumes
i want it more than anything
i want it more than life
without it i cant be truly happy
my friends try so hard they want me to be happy 
the do all the can for me which is more than i would want anyone too
sometimes they make me trip away from my pain, the make me laugh, make me happy for a second
but i cant live this way, i try not too but its just too hard
everything is a constant reminder oh how alone i am
i wish i could just blame other people, the world, groups for my pain but i know that it is only me that is causing it
it is the only thing that i have to make me feel real but sometimes i just dont want to deal with it. i wish i could just die."

"event","i almost didnt go see one of the best movies i ever seen tonight. dirty pretty things was the title of the flick and it left me with the saddest happiest feeling i have ever got from a movie. the only thing i could do after it was over was walk out of the theatre and have a cigarette...it made me feel good, like thier was hope for life...my life. this happiness was magnified by another trip to kim's with rachel, the nimeroff, and jeremy who with thier demeanors made the night almost perfect. im slowly learning what love is and i see that it is the strongest force in this universe."

"event","life has gone so slow for me the last 5 years and now things are starting to happen and its too much for me
too worried about what things might go wrong
i just dont feel right
my friends understand more than ever but its still not enough for me
not sure what really to do
im just getting lost in my head
and im afraid ill trip
and something awful happens
im just not sure what will happeni feel more alone now then i have my entire life and i have people who care about me
outside of family ive never had anyone care about me
i havent been there to not to be talk to
but ill always thank you for caring
being such a nice boy i wish it would get me somewherei just wonder sometimes how easy it would for everyone to forget about me
and how different thier life would be
and i dont think i would be any worse
a scrap book of photos that all that will be left
ill be gone but youll still be here hopefully you wont feel bad
i wish nothing caused you all pain
i just dont like what ive done with myself
if i were different i might feel right
i might feel good
close to nothing
close to emptiness
close to forgetting
but never close to love
never close to happiness
never close to being strong
move on without
the feeling of pain will move from you
you without me will never feel that bad
shrink away from my life
my only true friends try so hard to make me feel better
but its never enough i just cant be happy
i dont know if you can feel that empty void in my life
i would never ask you to
nothingness feels so close but i just cant do it
hope always fills me
a friend told me ill never stop being hurt by a girlfriend but i think the pain would never be so great
boys lie as much as girls 
the world is just full of so much pain and i cant see why everyone tolerates it
people let themselves be hurt by others
people wont let you do anything they cant 
people wont let you feel good
the feel so alienated by it that they cannot live with it
but the only thing i have to holf onto is my pain
my friends, my music
but i think sometimes its not enough
i tell others happiness comes from within but wish that wasnt true
i might be happy, i might be loved
my mind just wont shut up
i try to distract it with pointless things
i try to think of all of you
i try to think of my life being good
not thinking about me
not thinking about feeling right
not thinking about how to make things right
i just hate making others go down with my pain
i dont want anyone to feel bad like me
only a few people listen to me
only a few people love me like you
only a few people make me want to live
sunk time has always got me down
i just regret so much that i look behind and get run over
but i never let myself look all the way back
my brain takes over again and takes away my desire and then obliterates it
noone wants to listen when thier sad
noone wants to be with me
noone wants life to be great
everything get destroyed by emptiness
blood drips out of my mouth
i can taste the feeling of not
i hear the pain of others
i feel the pull of death
i waiting to become nothing but i cant
something pulls me out of it
my mind brings me too
my body wakes up
i feel like if i didnt remember last night i would feel good
i feel so disconnected i just cant stand on my own"

My first day of school was yesterday. The thing with HPU is that it is divided into 3 different section on the lower half of Oahu. The majority of my classes are in downtown Honolulu, your typical downtown area. The other class I have is in the Kaneohe side, Windward. Oh my...it is breathtaking. The school is located on top of the mountain and it's amazingly beautiful with its green, green grass, trees, vines, and flowers. The fact that it's cloudy and rains (just a little) makes it even more beautiful. The students are okay. I tried to make friends, but they were being little bastards. You know, I'd strike up a conversation and they would reply, but in short answers. Maybe in time...I like the class structure, the professors (my favorite is my anthropology teacher), and the fact I'm living on my own (gives me more time to study). I'm actually quite focused and very determined to get straight A's (though, I don't know how well I'll be doing at that). Hey, whatever can get me home quicker.
Being the insecure little bitch I am, I gave Rich a hard time a couple of days ago. Sometimes I wonder why he puts up with my shit. I got to give it to the man, he handles my attitude pretty well with a very adult-like nature. :D I ranted at him about how I think he's pulling away from me and blah blah blah. One thing I can say, the boy is trying to keep what we have alive; I just don't give him enough credit. He does little things that start to make me fidgety and makes me wonder, but I honestly have to stop analyzing every goddamn thing. I should start taking my own advice for once. I don't know when I'll see him again, but I hope to God (if there is one...if not, I hope to my god) that I will see him soon.
I'm actually home by myself until Monday. KoKo (my roomie) and her boyfriend left for Vegas earlier. I'm getting quite attached to her and her 2 boys, Kainalu and Keahi. Oh, especially Keahi (3 years old). He and I play all the time. Kainalu (7 years old) are still getting to the talking phase. KoKo is old enough to be my mother, but she is way too fucking cool to be. She's pretty antsy about meeting my boyfriend and honestly wouldn't mind him sleeping with me. Like I said, she is A-okay with anything and everything I choose to do.
I have a second interview with Starbucks. I'm really counting on my personality to get this job. I really need this job, too. I gotta eat some real food!!! In my pantry right now, I have 2 pieces of bread, granola bars, 1 1/2 boxes of crackers, instant coffee, soy milk, half pack of baby carrots, shredded mozzerella cheese, and 4 slices of ham...oh and bottles of water. See what I mean? I struggle to afford anything else. Like I said...I need this job...BAD to the bone."

"event","<p>I have finally moved into my house in Honolulu (Oahu), Hawaii. The area is known to be ""central"" meaning it is in the middle of everything on the south side of Oahu. The house itself sits on top of a hill, and has a decent view of the city in the front and mountains in the back. I tend to get more breeze up here. I'm not of walking distance to the beach, but it should only be a 5-10 minutes drive, otherwise. My room is of decent size with a huge desk, a single bed, a bookshelf, and a closet. It's quite comfortable, as well as the house. I like my roommate(s). She is 37 years old with two kids; though, the kids are only here some of the days. I enjoy having the two boys around (7 and 3 years old); they keep my mind off home, I suppose. Their pitbull, Buddha, is the cutest dog, also. I'm still trying to get used to living here, but I'm sure I'll adapt just fine.<br /><br />I miss home a lot, mainly people. It's a lot different here. People are more chill, more laid back, and rarely are assholes. It is very slow paced, but I miss the fast paced California. Nothing is too far from me. I hear to drive around the island, without stopping, only takes 2 hours. I probably would rather walk here than drive (gas is more expensive compared to San Jose).&nbsp;<br /><br />I miss my family, my friends...Rich. I came here to start a new life, but it's hard when your heart belongs to someone else. I often wonder why he is willing to try to keep a relationship with me. Not to sound pessimistic, but I'm always waiting for him to ""blow me off."" I guess&nbsp;that when you deal with so many men breaking your heart, you get used to it.&nbsp;I suppose I'm just scared of losing him with the distance between us.&nbsp;When it&nbsp;comes to me and relationships, I'm always the one willing to make things work out and actually trying&nbsp;all my hardest to make&nbsp;any relationship sustain. The problem is, the guy in the relationship never wants to try. I hope it's not&nbsp;Rich. Oh God, I hope he sticks around to be with me. I hope that he doesn't find some other girl to&nbsp;replace me. Gian told me that my move&nbsp;could be Rich's trial: to determine what type of guy he is, asshole or not an asshole. I hope he isn't the latter. I tried so hard not to fall for him, and ask Melanie (who knows&nbsp;me the best) I've tried&nbsp;very hard...but something...something about him gets a hold of me.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are a certain few who keep in touch with me still. Very few. If I were to put people in my ""top 3""&nbsp;as who contact me the most: Daniel, Mel, my parent(s). Weird. I miss my friends and everything we have done together. I'm sure I'll be&nbsp;coming back home real soon.&nbsp;</p>"

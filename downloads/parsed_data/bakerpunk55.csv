"event","show saturday at the wayne train station, odds against, the domino theory, kill you in the face, a sence of belonging, and etc, 6-11, $5. etc... is playing. everyone should come out, its the first wayne show in a while. katy wants me to go to fennarios with her, but no no no, its wayne for me, sorry katy. come to wayne hun, its going to rock.

emily asked me who i kissed at the end of the day today. i dont remember kissing anyone but travis, and she asked who the pretty girl, GIRL, was and travis is a guy, i think. maybe she thought i kissed jamals little sister zara, she walked me to my bus, well pats bus but still. i didnt kiss her though, we were just talking, shes really nice. emily said peter and dustin gave her $20 and said she could keep it if she found out who i kissed, but i never kissed anyone. weird. 

anyway, this week has been really crappy. emily and i broke up after 5 months. my longest relationship with a girl. she said she didnt want to go out over summer because we'd never see each other, she said something about not wanting to do something that might make me not like her too, it was really confusing and really, really unexpected. ive been pretty sad all week, like ill be happy and then something will remind me of her and ill get all depressed, and it sucks. she said shes going to come to my bands show saturday so we can hang out, but we have hardly talked at all since the breakup so i think its going to be awkward. oh well, at least ill get to see her. i really like her alot. everyones telling me to move on and i know thats probally what i should do, but i dont really want to, and im not doing a good job at it considering im planing on hanging out with her saturday night. i dont think i want to get over her, but maybe i should? argh this sucks. im listening to brand new, its not helping my emotions at all, its making me feel even more sad, too much slowness. thats about all i have to say for tonight.

show this friday at the trappe ymca, as pat would say ""be there or...not be there"" he says something like that i think. its 5 dollars and i think it starts at 6. it should be a pretty good show, sfs has a new song thats supposed to be really good, and my band tdt has 3 new songs so that should be neat. i dont know about the other bands, i like kill you in the face so hopefully they'll have something interesting to listen to. capitol risk is emo, they'll be selling their full length, and i dont remember the other bands sorry. bye for now, have a nice night."

"event","It's official.  I'm totally legit.  I know how to drive those rigid inflatable boats Greenpeace uses to pace whaling ships.  We trained today in the Chesapeake Bay, and it was ridiculously cold but amazing.  I'm so happy I could explode.

Tomorrow is climb training.  Yessssss...*pumping arm up and down with clenched fist*"

"event","I'm not quite sure where to begin telling you about the last week I had in the great city of Knoxville, Tennessee.  For the sake of keeping it under a novella, I'll give you the highlights...

Our goal was to get 3200 petitions signed to tell Thomas Faulk, the CEO of Kimberly-Clark (the makers of Kleenex tissues), to stop cutting down ancient endangered forests for tissue products and start using more sustainable logging practices as well as more recycled content in all of their products.  

Well, we managed to actually get 4000 petitions signed instead and had a kick-ass kick-off meeting with about 50 leaders and activists on campus that were interested in the campaign.  

I worked tirelessly from 6am to 10pm, with no breaks or naps--mind you, for five days straight. By Friday afternoon I was delirious--as in not making any sense, but I'm better now.  

All in all, I'm exhausted and excited to be doing this kind of work.  It's absolutely refreshing to know that I can make a job out of doing something for the greater good.

I'll write more next weekend when I get back to the District..."

<P>We went on a retreat to middle-o-nowhere Pennsylvania to frolic&nbsp;among the mountains and spend quality time with everyone involved in the organizing term.&nbsp; I got to sleep on an actual real matress for two evenings in a row--which reminded me that I'll never take a bed for granted ever ever again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday, Friday, and part of Saturday&nbsp;were packed with lots of teambuilding exercises, listening exercises, self-evaluations, storytelling, and other kinds of craziness one would expect to encounter when hanging out with people that are concerned about protecting the environment.&nbsp; Let's just say there was enough Bob Marley and djembe drum jam sessions to last me a while.</P>
<P>The highlights...</P>
<P>Polar-bearing.&nbsp; Yep, you heard it.&nbsp; I didn't go myself, but I did watch approximately five other GOT-ers jump into a freezing river/stream with next to nothing on.&nbsp; Look out for pictures at a later date...</P>
<P>Life maps.&nbsp; This was one of the structured bonding activities we did, which required everyone to tell their life story and the influences that got them to this program.&nbsp; I talked a lot about my mom, my grandmother, and Hurricane Katrina.&nbsp; Pretty heavy stuff, but I feel like I <EM>know</EM> everyone now.</P>
<P>Campfire.&nbsp; It's cooky, I know, but there's something quite irrisistable about a group of your newest friends standing around a fire in the middle of nowhere making up songs to sing.&nbsp; It's simple, quality entertainment--hard to beat.</P>
<P>We got back to the city on Saturday and pow-wow'd at my apartment, which included a couple of Heinekens and some light dancing. &nbsp;I didn't do anything particularly important yesterday except go to the grocery store.&nbsp; But&nbsp;chillin' at the hizzy&nbsp;is no bore...my roomates tend to tell funny jokes and wrestle when faced when nothing else to do...so lazy Sunday afternoons don't exist at 1127 Columbia Road.</P>
<P>This&nbsp;is only the beginning.&nbsp; As for the rest, I can't wait.</P>

"event","<P>It hailed on the way to the office this morning.&nbsp; The fact that the hail was so small (and looked like snow) excited me enough to stick out my tongue for the three block walk to the metro...</P>
<P>After that everything was great.&nbsp; We met with an expert on Greenpeace's campaign against international bottom trawling to discuss how campaigns are planned and executed, etc.&nbsp; She even got a chance to review our campaign proposals and give us tips.&nbsp; Then we watched a ""feel good"" movie about some of the campaign wins Greenpeace has had in the past, which included:&nbsp; making it illegal for people to skin white fur seals from the arctic, stoping the dumping of nuclear waste in the ocean, placing a moratorium on whaling, and many more I can't remember at the moment.</P>
<P>Tommorrow morning we're all going on a three-day retreat to the COO's office in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; I'm assuming we'll be doing team-building and leadership exercises with lots of ""intense bonding"" mixed in between.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to getting outside of the city for a few days--it'll be nice to see some greenery.</P>
<P>Now, for the descriptions of my other two roomates...</P>
<P>Kyle is a tall vegan from New York that wears lots of coral/dolphin t-shirts and listens to ska--and only ska.&nbsp; Beneath a tousled mound of blonde hair, his face is usually blank and expressionless--except when he wants to surprise you.&nbsp; He doesn't talk too much, but when he does it's freakin' hilarious.&nbsp; When he's not cracking me up in his subtle way, he's usually eating.&nbsp; I know what you're thinking...but, no, I mean it.&nbsp; This kid eats...and eats...and then eats more.&nbsp; I'm trying to teach him how to savor food but he doesn't trust anyone that doesn't use a gobbling technique.&nbsp; Literally, he will finnish his meal, and then eat what's left over of mine...and then probably have a snack afterwards.&nbsp; Oh and I can't let him get too hungry&nbsp;while I'm&nbsp;trying to cook something.&nbsp; For example, I made roasted potatoes this evening, which required a baking time of about 30-40 minutes.&nbsp; Kyle couldn't wait that long, so he squatted in front of the oven with the door open and ate the uncooked potatoes from the pan.&nbsp; This is a common occurence at 1127 Columbia Road.&nbsp; With all the eating you'd thing he'd be humongous, but this kid is blessed with a lean dancer's body--did I mention he used to take ballet?&nbsp; </P>
<P>And last but not least is Gabriel--a 24 year old Californian monk.&nbsp; Well, he's not really a monk, but he has taken vows and studied kung fu in China (and yes he does have swords).&nbsp; Gabriel is a prophet among my roomates.&nbsp; He's our voice of reason, our spiritual guide, and our resident freak.&nbsp; He meditates at least an hour a day, sings pirate songs in the shower, and is the most articulate and intelligent person in the entire program (by my standards, anyway).&nbsp; He's got activist eyes--when you look at him you see...<EM>him</EM>.&nbsp; He seems to have an accurate sense of who he is and his role in the world, whereas the rest of us are still searching.&nbsp; He teaches philosophy and religious studies (in addition to his own studies) at San Diego State...so you can only imagine his intensity.&nbsp; I suppose he does have one weakness, however---burritos.&nbsp; I've seen him eat about 8 or 9 in the last 3 days...that's one at every meal.&nbsp; I sincerely look forward to learning all that I can from him.</P>
<P>So that's it.&nbsp; That's the entire bunch--Ryan, Kyle, Gabriel, Mark, and Kat.&nbsp; How we got such different yet&nbsp;unique people in the same house will always be a mystery to me.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Look for picture posts of these people at a later date.</P>"

"event","<P>Today was the second day of the program and challenging indeed.&nbsp; After a very short briefing we had to spend the afternoon constructing an entire campaign to combat fisheries that use bottom trawling to maximize their product output.&nbsp; I was put into a group with Rania, Ryan, Tonya, and Kat based on a personality profile we completed yesterday--the results of which were most likely <EM>wrong </EM>based on the way we interacted.&nbsp; Perhaps compiling a group of natural leaders and control freaks is just a nasty trick the trainers are using to tame us.&nbsp; Maybe not.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;find out&nbsp;what the deal is, I'll be sure to fill you in. </P>
<P>Other than that we met with the actions team to discuss how and why Greenpeace comes up with the ideas to do the crazy shit that usually ends up on TV or in the newspaper--which was awesome.</P>
<P>Until tomorrow...</P>"

"event","<P>A day has passed and I sit again at my bay window.&nbsp; The Greenpeace Organizing Term started this morning at 9am.&nbsp; All the participants met at the office for a long day of introductions, team building, and general orientation.&nbsp; For lunch we ate Indian food&nbsp;with Greenpeace's Executive Director in Washinton D.C., who is one of two ""big giant heads"" in the nation for the organization.&nbsp; I sat next to him and we chatted about global warming and Hurricane Katrina.&nbsp; One thing I've noticed about most activists is that they all have very clear eyes--in the sense that when you look at them, you're actually seeing <EM>them.</EM>&nbsp; They're there--up front.&nbsp; I hope to have eyes like that one day...</P>
<P>We also watched an amazing video montage that put some of the past direct action campaigns to music, which was pretty awesome and exciting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything&nbsp;we did today made&nbsp;all of my uneasiness about the organization and its ""questionable""&nbsp;practices go away.&nbsp; I'm no longer concerned&nbsp;that&nbsp;Greenpeace uses the wrong tactics to&nbsp;target its ""enemies"" and I'm confident that everything I do&nbsp;in this program will back up a legitimate set of moral values.</P>
<P>And for those of you who are wondering...</P>
<P>Greenpeace does <EM>NOT </EM>support any violent action or the damaging of property.&nbsp; Any actions that may have been violent or have damaged property in the past were not sanctioned by the USA's division of Greenpeace.&nbsp; Everybody and every piece of information I encountered today shattered all the negative perceptions of this organization that I've heard since I decided to join.&nbsp; These people have good heads on their shoulders.&nbsp; They know exactly what they're doing and how their actions make an impact.&nbsp; They're not a bunch of crazy-wacked-out hippies&nbsp;and&nbsp;they <EM>do</EM> wear shoes in the office.&nbsp; I am proud and thouroughly tickled to be a part of this organization.</P>
<P>Now as for some of my other roomates...</P>
<P>Ryan is sprawled out behind me on the floor.&nbsp; He's the most ""New York"" person I've ever met.&nbsp; He's a muscle-boy from Long Island (pronounced lowng eyelund)&nbsp;that wears a gold bracelet with a matching pinky ring.&nbsp; When he's not hypothesizing how people could possibly steal from us (he's very concerned about motherfuckers with machine guns), Ryan talks about beach erosion and the extinction of marine life.&nbsp; As the only meat eater in the house, he's definitely a minority.&nbsp; Ryan was once paralyzed from the neck down for three days after a football injury, but miraculously recovered and now (gasp) still plays for his college team.&nbsp; He just moved in on Saturday so there's still much to learn about this mystery kid...</P>
<P>Now standing in our kitchen making a veggie tortillia is Kat (short for Katrina--how weird is that?).&nbsp; She sleeps with me in the purple and blue room on the second floor.&nbsp; Kat is a mature college freshman from Connecticut that wears a lot of tie-dye and listens to the Doors.&nbsp; She even has a pair of those gardening clogs that Whitney predicted.&nbsp; She's totally transplanted from the Woodstock era, but she hasn't offered me any weed yet.&nbsp; Wait--no, nevermind--she just did.</P>
<P>I'll tell you about my two other roomates tomorrow...</P>

<P>I'm now living in a three-story brownstown in the great city of Washington D.C. with some way cool people from around the country.&nbsp; Picture me sitting at a bay window on a city street, sipping on a gigantic cup o' rasperry green tea.&nbsp; If I look out the window to the right, my roomate Mark is sitting on the steps...</P>
<P>Mark is from Iowa and probably the nicest person I've ever met.&nbsp; Currently he's reading a book on meditation out on our front porch.&nbsp; He's an intensely idealistic type that wears overalls but not deodorant or shoes (most of the time).&nbsp; He's got mad skills on the djembe drum, and can put a beat to any song.&nbsp; Around the house and in conversation he's very cartoon-like.&nbsp; He exaggerates his speech and his movements most of the time...which produces something quite hilarious.&nbsp; Yesterday I helped him clear part of the backyard so we can plant peas, tomatoes, and peppers when the time is right.&nbsp;&nbsp;We've also started a compost heap that we hope to leave behind for the next batch of tenants.&nbsp; And oh yes, he's also the only person I've met that practices capoeira and is <EM>not</EM> from Brazil.</P>

"event","(Mofaz, the Depressed Persian Tow Truck Man, is driving with young girl in the passenger seat.)

Girl: You can just tow my car to the gas station. My dad's gonna meet me there.

Mofaz: No problem.

Girl: My dad was so mad on the phone, and this wasn't even my fault. The guy ran a red light. And I know he's gonna make me pay for the repairs. My dad is just like that. God, this sucks.

OPENING THEME SONG:
If you are blue, if you are sad,
if you're depressed, upset, or unbelievably mad;
you'll get a lift,
after talking with, 
The Depressed Persian Tow Truck Man!

Girl: You know, you are so lucky. You don't have to deal with parents anymore.

Mofaz: Think again, sister. My whole family live with me. Nineteen people. Only one shower. Everybody use one shower. Everyone is very hairy. Do you know what the drain looks like after nineteen people use the shower? It's very dirty and very hairy. It is like, eh, how you say, hellahellalala, Madonna's chramelalekra.

Girl: Nineteen people! Wow! I hope you have a big house.

Mofaz: It's one bedroom apartment in Glendale. The south side, not the good side. Always people everywhere. Nothing! Always! Never! If I go to pick my nose, there is already a finger there. If I go to wipe my ass, there is already somebody wiping. If I go to make love with my wife, there is already somebody there saying, ""Thumbs up! I got her first!""

Girl: Well, you know, I'm an only child; and I always wanted to be part of a really big family.

Mofaz: Then you are stupid. You are like, how you say, hellahellalala, Corky from Life Goes On. My favorite show is Dharma & Greg. All I want to do is watch Dharma & Greg and get the jokes. So I say to my family, ""Shhh! Shhh! Be quit during Dharma & Greg. Hear the jokes."" Are they quiet? No! Never! Always! I hear them fight! I hear them laugh! I hear them cry! I hear them poo! Always I hear them. They don't be quiet during Dharma. Dharma's going ot say a joke. ""Hey, Greg, I just got home and..."" [imitates farting noise]. That's what I hear. I hear that.

Girl: Well, at least your dad isn't mean.

Mofaz: Oh, don't make me laugh 'cause laughing makes my gums bleed.

Girl: Your dad is mean, too?

Mofaz: Twenty-four, seven, eleven. Always. When I was a young boy, I would go to sleep. Every night my father would creep into my bedroom and say, ""Wake up! Your mama just killed herself! Your mama just killed herself!"" And I would say, ""Why, Papa, why?"" And he would say, ""Just kidding, be smart.""

Girl: That is awful. Where was your mother during all of that?

Mofaz: I hate my mother. I hate her like N*Sync's new single. She would say... I was very fat... she would say, ""Here, piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy! Dance on your hooves for food, piggy, piggy, piggy! I'm going to slaughter you for breakfast, piggy, piggy!"" Always she say the piggy. ""Happy Birthday, I hate you, piggy, piggy! Go die!"" Always. She was bad, always.

Girl: Oh, my God, that's awful! Gosh, I hope you never wrecked your dad's car.

Mofaz: We had no car to wreck! We had nothing but an old warthog to ride around on. One day, my father come to me, he say, ""You touch the warthog, I will cut off you hellahellalala."" I was fourteen, I did not want him to cut of the hellahellalala. I play with it all the time.

Girl: But let me guess, you did. You touched the warthog, and your dad got really mad.

Mofaz: No, he was killed by our neighbor.

Girl: God, I'm sorry.

Mofaz: Don't be. Was best day of my life. I came over to just view the bod and giggle. ""Ho, ho, ho, who laughing now?!""

Girl: Well, that's a good way to look at the bright side of things, you know?

Mofaz: Where's the bright side?! All day, I pick up little girls who don't know how to drive. And then I live in Glendale, off the off-ramp by the freeway with one shower. Every day, I pull out mass of hair like Madonna's chramelalekra. I can not make love to my wife without taking a number. I cannot watch Dharma & Greg without hearing a little [imitates farting noise]. I...

Girl: You know what, there's my dad, right there! Just pull over!

Mofaz: All right.

Girl: Hey, thanks for talking to me. I feel a lot better.

CLOSING THEME SONG:
If you are blue, if you are sad, 
if you're depressed, upset, or unbelievably mad;
you'll get a lift,
when you're talking with,
The Depressed Persian Tow Truck Man!

Mofaz: I wish I was dead.

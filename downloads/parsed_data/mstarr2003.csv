"event","well...i dunno, havent updated forever. Its been quite a crazy ride, and I didn't really feel like updating in the middle of the semester, but here goes as tomorrow is the past day of classes...

1. I have three classes left between me and the end of the semester. Well, technically I also have 4 in-class exams in 72 hours, but thats just details I guess. It's been a pretty good semester for me, I've done pretty decently academically, managed to have some fun, and managed to stay sane.

2. I've been having some health issues lately. It turns out that it looks like there is nothing too serious, thankfully, but it was pretty scary for a while. Actually it still is. i'm trying not to flip out...drs apt tomorrow...Still not sure exactly what is going on, but hopefully with some more tests the doctors will have it figured out and get me back working out (not working out is driving me insane). I'll just be happy to not be dizzy and feel awful half of the day...

3. Life is overall, pretty amazing. Matt is great and I'm so happy with everything relating to that. Still, I just wish that I could have ONE SEMESTER on campus being healthy and all.

4. Being a junior isnt THAT scary, but dating a senior and having mostly senior friends sure as hell is. Also scary? taking the MCATS this spring. while taking classes. while captaining softball. lets see just how good I am at keeping my stuff together.

i think that is it for now, I feel bad that i neever put anything in here, but theres just been so much going on....

This one actually hasn't been awful in comparison to those that I've had in the past and those I will have in...say...a few weeks.

Ochem monday, Political Theory paper wednesday, Physics exam tonight.

Then lab tomorrow 1-5, then its fall break.

Not super exciting, cause I'm just staying here, trying to get a good chunk of research done on my paper for American Presidency so I don't freak out in a few weeks.

Matt is staying for break too, which should be really nice :)

I've changed my mind a million times on what to wear. You know that I think its a big deal when I'll actually put some make up on. Wow, I know huh?

The reason that I am in bed is two-fold. First, today was long and tiring, and we self for the airport at 4:15. Second reason is that I had a visitor last night. Needless to say, I'm soooo sleep deprived. But its all been so worth it.

Things are good. Hope they continue to look up.

I know its been a while, but I'm bored and am still craaaaaazy off the coffee that I had at Dunkins. Next time someone remind me that I cannot drink coffee so late at night. It gives me crazy dreams, makes my heart pound, and keeps me awake. Good thing about it? My caffine deprivation caused some extreme headaches, and those are gone right now.

So I'm leaving Monday AM for DC for the summer. I am so incredibly nervoud and excited. Its such a mixed bag of emotion, because it should be a great summer but I'm sad that I won't be around here to do everything that I usually do (softball, friends....) but the internship should be a great oppertunity for me to figure out if this is what I want to do with my life. Also, there are going to be a ton of fun people down there, so I can't wait for that too.

Tonight was SO MUCH FUN. I've actually had an amazing last two days. Friday I went to DS (always awkward, and usually makes me incredibly nervous and panic attack-y) and survived, and then went home and hung out until I headed to Mass for the night. I had a first date. And it went sooo well. I got home wicked late because it was so far away, but it was so worth it. Today was social day...I hung out with Tory, we went to Concord softball's last game and then to see Beauty and the Beast in Nashua. Came home and listened to the Sox win 17-1, then headed over to Ambers. Amber and I watched First Daughter (so cute!) and had a really good time catching up, and then joined Ryan, Isaac, Linds, Lins, and Julie at Dunkins for a 2 hour reunion. So much fun.

So I'm happy. I'm tired, actually exhausted. But I want to wait up for someone to get home so I can talk to him...but I don't think I'm gonna make it.

The past few days I've really realized how amazing my friends are. I'm so lucky to have everyone special to me in my life.

Really content right now.

I'm done my sophmore year, which is insane because it completely flew by. I know that I was only at school for one semester, but things were just amazing. I mean, socially I had a wonderful group of friends that mainly consisted of softball girls but always had some other people thrown in for good times. Softball turned pretty well but not great. I played through mono. No guys of interest during the semester, although things are starting to look up now.

Wow. looking back on what I just wrote it seems like a crappy semester. But somehow it ended up well, and things couldnt be better now. Well minus a few small complications. But I'm happy.

I will be in DC this summer, working for Senator Kerry. Not expecting it to be an intereting summer socially. Even after all my hopes with things working out with certain people, I really don't care anymore. Which is great.

I'm happy. I'm very content with my life.

Love you all,

So classes start tomorrow, and I'm in the middle of a little flip out about this summer. I'm (hopefully) spending it in DC, but the process of finding an internship is stressing me out. I'm applying to a bunch of Senator's offices (Schumer, Clinton, Obama, Levine, Kerry, Kennedy), a few Democratic organizations, and some other assorted stuff.

The problem is that everyone wants something different. So in addition to cover letters and resume, I have to whip up some writing samples that address certain issues. It's like applying to college. All over again. But more than one application, so I'm stressed. Almost everything is due by the end of February, so the next few weeks with class and applications and softball I might just be a little busy.

Classes start tomorrow: Comparitive Government, International Relations, Organic Chemistry, and French (if they let me in).

I talked to my advisor and the registrar about it today, and I have a choice. So this is my debate:

Option 1:
Move my graduation year back to '07, and graduate with my class
Spend this summer in DC working on the hill.
Use my AP credits to graduate on time.
Save $19,000

Option 2:
Stay an '08J which means I won't be able to graduate with my class.
Spend my summer in NH working for Gov. Lynch and possibly coaching softball.
Spend my senior fall in DC doing a semester's internship and taking classes.
Graduate without my class in '08.

There are clear positive and negatives to both of these options, but I really dont know what to do.

Any advice would be helpful."

You know what? If you didnt vote, you don't have a right to complain. So just shut up.

Ok, anything else? Because if ONE MORE PERSON asks me if I regret working on the campaign I will punch them. It was the best decision I have ever made on my life. I would do it again right now.

"event","So its finally friday.

This week was interesting, and the past two days in particular have been incredibly intense. With the DNC coming up next week, I've been flat out scheduling interviews for all of the delegates. It's been a trial by fire, but I still love what I'm doing. Work is great. I really feel like I'm making a difference and I'm learning so much about John Kerry and politics that it is perfect. I don't think that I'm on a fast track to switching my major to poly sci, but its interesting that I found something that I love so much that has nothing to do with my major.

In other news, softball is going well. We have a tourny down in Lowell this weekend, then Gilford, and then Penn. After that its ankle surgery time (Aug 11) and then my job becomes 24/7.

Well i've got to run, since is 9am, and I have to catch the morning radio hosts right after they get off the air.

Love, Miki"

"event","So it is nice to be home. Strange that everything has stayed the same while everything around me at college was constantly changing and evolving, but I'll get used to it, and catch up to what is happening. It's been a while since I wrote a decent entry, with the stress and insanity of my last week at Colby to the first few days back at home. So...

-Before Sunday: I don't even want to talk about exam week, but to say that I worked insanely hard, put in 70+ hours of studying, took caffine pills (bad idea) and just put everything I had into my four exams. What else can I do? No matter what I end up getting in all of my classes, I am still proud of myself. Whew. 
-Sunday: Packed up all of my stuff on Sunday afternoon and headed home with dad. Somehow I managed to accumulate a ton more things over the school year, so packing was a process, as was the reaction my allergies like to have to the dust in my room.Lots of sad goodbyes. One of the worst was Ry, who I realized I wont see for 15 months. Sad. And of course, Adam, Care, and Sarah. :-( Got home and before I even got home stopped at my HS softball field to watch a catching clinic. Saw my sister, saw some friends, then home. Collapsed. So nice to be home :-)

-Monday: Slept until 11. Hey, I deserve it. Unpacket a little, cleaned up a little. Headed to my sister's game in Thayer to watch her make me proud. It was a blast even though it ended up being 13-0. Fun, Fun. At night I headed over to Gatzke's to chill and watch movies. Ended up seeing lots of fun people there, and REUNION WITH AMBER!!! Amber and I decided we couldnt sit in a room and not talk, so we went back to her house and talked for a while, followed by a bit of footloose. 

-Tuesday: Job Search Day. Went and filled out a bunch of apps, actually had a job interview at American Eagle at 3. Hope I get that because it has great discounts, and that is pretty much the only place I buy clothes. Went to the gym, joined up again and started the summer madness. Its so great to start getting back in shape, after you get past that period of pain. Right now I am still dealing with the pain. Tuesday night I didn't do anything, just hung out here with the family, sorted summer ball uniforms. 

-Wednesday: Woke up kinda early and cleaned and unpacked, interupted by lots of tv and music breaks. Got a lot accomplished. Headed to Boston with my dad to see my ankle doctor, and he said that I needed surgery, which is not really a suprise considering that I had been told this before and had decided to play through it for the rest of my spring season. So I got scheduled for Aug. 11th. That should be a blast, considering I wont be able to drive for 3 months, that I will be on crutches for the first few months and all. I'm pumped. Welll, actually, I am happy I still get to play summer ball AND get this sucker fixed before next spring. SO then I got home, and had a phone message from the new head SB coach at my high school, OFFERING ME AN ASSISTANT COACHING POSITION FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR!!! So excited. I start tomorrow. SOOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY!

So now? I'm going to go downstairs and compulsivly flip between American Idol and the Bachelor...then watch Made. Wow, sometimes I feel like I am a waste of space. :-)

Love, Miki"

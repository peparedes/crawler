"event","My dear, what an indelible time it seems you are having. Aside from the arse wiping, I see no good reason why this place should be call-ed a resort. What kind of enticing brochures snared you? What late night infomercial? Alas, I'm sure it was the raving a dear one. Yes it must be, otherwise why bother going? There seems to be some serious bitchery going on in the convent. 

As I sit here clenching my anus in frustration for you, I realize that the only way for us to be happy forever without finding true love is to belong once and for all to each other. I daresay we should escape our doldrum life of resorting and vacationing with 'friends' to artistic ink parlors. You certainly wouldn't have to rip any openings in that unpleasant wound all women seem to have in common. Oh dear.

But seriously my lov-ed one, it has been too many days since you went to your quiet, enforced, very secure getaway. Where does life lead you upon graduating from that confounded abbey? Should I get into any of my schools and have the choice, we should voyage together, particularly New York or Chicargo. By voyage I mean find a cozy little 'partment. We must discuss this orally.

Ta,
Willy"

William I must say- if ever you are given the opportunity as I was to ""try on this jacket... come in this van... we are taking you to a resort"" then daaaaling- do check up on it. Because not only are there NO bps for me to ask to shine my shoes and  make me a sandwich ( oddly enough however, there is always someone around to wipe my ass, even when i dont request it) -- but there is also NO carriage rides or spas. What kind of resort is this? Its as if... as if... I were living the life of a commoner. Ghastly William. Truly Ghastly. alas- i must be going now. i heard a bell just ring and i do suppose its now time for tea. or another enema. who is to say?

I refused to go because when you've seen one Bob Fossey act, you've seen them all, wouldn't you say? I know I certainly don't want to be a dancing man, even while I can.
        On a more relevant note, I was pleasured to see you sent me another telegram! I began to fear your love for me had wilted like an erection revealed under a table in a science class seen by Jordan the pink Power Grainger. Kudos to you Usher Gay for putting up such a stiff fight in the grade of 8th.
         I have decided that nicknames are too confusing, and life too short, to be an effective means of carrying the vomit of word. Thus, I have decided to lay some names on the table right now. Actually, I'm going to do that in a more private letter, my scrumptious love, for fear of offending the jews or the blacks. Or any one not fortunate enough to have blonde hair and blue eyes or be named Michelle- foofoo, that means you are safe. Same to you Michelle Trachtenberg, you got to first Zion base safe. 
         My love, in a few minutes I have an examination in sightreading and playing in some fascinating little inverted chords for a jazz tune that is particularly wicked. I daresay I'm going to march up to the piano, wink at the professor, bang some notes out with my feet on the piano until the cacophony causes her to stop me and ask what the hell I'm doing, to which I will reply,""This is jazz ladies and gentleman,"" and just walk away, just walk away. I do love a good music joke.

Which, I daresay, has been quite some length of time. As I recall, certainly not this past week, especially since the warts that plague me seem to be on the full crest of an outbreak.
But on a more serious note my dear, I seem to have found myself on the other side of your affections. I haven't caught a whiff from the Atlantic sea breeze of your crustaceous being! Not a day goes by that I don't wish I were with you, and as Princess Kelly would say, 'since you've been gone' I've been rather glum and well, plumsy. Or perhaps grapefruity. Take your pick of any large spherical objects and that is me. Except for watermelon because besides being more on the oval side of things, it is filled with fiber, and I have to say I am anything but regular, wot wot.
Mary, mary, oh so...contrary, I long to know when you will be back in your estate at the Tara manor. I shall arrive in precisely one month, or as some Canadians say, four weeks, or as some Estonians say, 27 days (and so on and so forth).

        Do you believe that through some glitch in the system that I have acquired a well documented phenomena known as telepathy? Yes, it is quite remarkable. It is a means by which I can decipher even the most autistic of personalities, and decide instantly that I dislike them. This may not change anything regarding my treatment of common folk before I attained this gift from afar, but it certainly makes my decisions clear as ice. Clear ice, that is.
        But that isn't nearly as important as the discovery of a crepe making place that is within walking distance of my new house. Whenever the carriage arrives that is indefinitely carrying you to my blue manor, we shall frolick in revelry. Not only is there a crepe place, but it is located immediately next to The Boot, a most remarkable place where drunken children stumble after midnight to make merry with more drinking, dancing, and shaking hands. The likes of Thinsey Blowhan has been seen ""sniffing"" around the establishment. 
         Oh dearest Mary, what joy shall we know in arms together? When our lips lock and our fingers touch? Heavens to Betsy.

           While we are on the subject, I must broach the question of why seven gnarly little child molesters covered in grime and dark soot from the mine don't pound away on the fair flaxen secret folds of some silly little Snow White. Perhaps if she was Snow Black they would have thought she worked in the mines as well and found her fuckable.
         Oh, and Sleeping Beauty. Obviously, my dear, she has a most severe case of mono. Maleficent was simply trying to stop the confounded plague by spreading by putting those thorns around her castle. Of course, leave it to flamin' fairies to try and spread the plague. Quite successful they were in that endeavour...although a tad bit more severe than mono.
         Don't even get me started on Pocahontas. Although, perhaps she got more out of beads than we ever did with a whole continent. Who's to say. 
         Prince Charming? More like Prince Farming, rooting out any dirty little kitchen wench with a similar foot fetish as he, as if she were a radish and then taking part in her spoils.
         Jasmine mustn't get it in her head that she's a princess forever. Once those desert nomads find oil and turbans, her little power trip will be put to rest shortly. That is, six feet under along with any other intelligent sand rat that lived out there.
         And lastly in my social commentary, I shall suffice it to say that Belle single-handedly began the sexual-deviant group known as the Furries.

He and I attended the same acadamy, although I could only but catch glimpses of him dashing through the quad lest he be later than ten minutes early to class. The entire name somewhat escapes me at the moment, but I remember the remarkable resemblence he bore to our ever-conquering hero, Harry Potter. In name only, mind you. The REAL Harry Potter would think nothing of casting glittery spells on willing orifices, hole in sheet or not. As I recollect, you visited me one day at the monastery and attempted to make contact with this queer creature, but he ran away, flailing his floppy lunchbox at you and shouting yiddish this and hebrew that. The gall! As a Philistine, I should expect a bit more violence in my direction, say a rock slingshotted at me or perhaps a tornado of fire, but a soft lunchpack with naught but kosher hollah wafers? At least they started the whole trend of circumcision; I daresay the few glimpses I caught of my Euro-trash friends' 'bishops in turtlenecks'(hedwig, I confess) gave me quite the shivers- of disgust, that is. Can you imagine me having to make intimacy with a Q-Tip everynight? Ye gods, I'd rather have a narkie from someone of the classical city of Troy. Which indeed may have happened....the Q-Tips, that is.....wot?  All women should be offended by him, calling the gentler sex an unclean personage! Something about bleeding every now and then, preposterous idea indeed. I think he suffers from a most severe case of SUA, otherwise known as BUA. Broomstick Up Ass syndrome. Quite unfortunate. I wish poor Consuelo were here to grant this Hairy throwback a gift of the modern age, the hiv. 

Why can't the world be more like us, my love? More pure and free. There would be war, but in between the sheets and not between countries. I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. has alerted me to stay hidden tonight; fortunately, our dear friend mr asia vomit will be here. Here's to you dear,

"event","Why my love, as i was waxing my chest and PURUSING our love letters i seemed to come across a note from someone seeming to be suffering from SUA syndrome. or as you may find it called in latin-medical terms Stick Up Ass syndrome. it is a rather fatal disease suffered by many of those who we tend to encounter. symptoms do involve making obnoxious faces of confusion and disgust after a comment that one of us have made and they waddle away and we hope they trip. most advanced stages of the disease cause the victims to yelp...""wait... did u just say that?' while squinching up thier faces in a most repulsive mannor that causes one to punch them in thier cock-gulping throats- thus adding to the fatality of SUA. so my love...when people wonder as to why we act in the way we do- harassing the patients of SUA- we stand proud and claim- oh do fuck off- it may apear im fingering his asshole....but im simply trying to remove the stick within it.

It excited my pallate, and I think I shall join the locals in this feeding frenzy ce soir. I grow anxious for this even as I write. Shrimp which are endless?

"event","Well hullo again. It seemeth to me that there is perhaps a slight.... oh, what do they call it, a whooka whooka REmix in the house, indeed yes. When ever I would scruffle by the Huffle-Puff dormitories in my knickers the song they seemed to be singing goes a bit more like-""double double"" toil and trouble. But that was bygone times, when my magic wand seemed to froth forth every which way at the tinest flick. It was quite fascinating really, I could turn strapping young men into mewling babes huddled in fetal positions. Magical indeed. 
      Oh fots and wops; I DO hope you forgive me, I forgot to mention this strange occurrence to you via the telegram i sent you earlier. I had a yearning to meet my humpday snack so I set off towards the livestock barn. Whilst I was on my way to Bessie's stall, I noticed the stableboys doing the queerest thing. It seemed that they were engaged in a bit of leapfrog, but somehow not actually leaping. I was headed over to show them how to actually play the damned game when Ricardo, whom you will remember as one of Consuelo's bastard spawn, leapt from the shadows and startled me out of my wits. I daresay he was trying to keep me from some of the other boys' mischievous behaviours. Nevertheless I shared my sympathies over the sudden and abrupt departure of his father, letting him know that if ever he wanted to be upgraded from cottonseed sifter to pool tender to just let one of the managers know, and to not be affrighted by their whips for they are for show.

     I hope you approved of my actions dear, 'tis so hard to manage things as they should be without you. You always could run a tight ship. Although a bit splintery perhaps, wot wot."

        My colored maid Katrina has flushed me out of my house in a fit of rage; I think the dear child went mad. In any case, I packed her back to Africa, but she did manage to leave quite a number on the Oriental carpets. It might be some time before I can set foot in my squishy abode. Perhaps Miss Topheles will take it upon herself to become potty-trained in light of recent events. Oh, isn't that word naughty? Potty. Potty potty potty.

"event","Well, Angelica's birthday was in a month. That was something happy!
Septmeber 29th also yielded their one year anniversary. Yeah. It had been that long.

They'd had a few bumps, but things were really good. He really needed to think of something REALLY good to get her. Something AMAZING. Each present NEEDED to out do the next, and some of his past presents had been pretty awesome.

So he spent his afternoon around the house, moping, because he had no good ideas!

He spent his evening surfing the internet, and tossing wasted paper into the trash.

Falling asleep on his desk, GUESS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? MATTY'S DREAM TIME!!! <lj-cut text= ""Are you excited? OMG I'm so excited. What am I going to type next? It should be something really ridiculous!"">

Matty woke up, picking his head up off his desk.

""Do you normally do that?""

He instinctively smiled at the sound of her voice. ""Hey babe,"" he laughed, turning his head.
Umm.. what?

""You're going to kill your neck like that, idiot.""

He stared. Idiot? Wait. She was shorter... Blonde hair?

""What? Oh c'mon, I didn't mean it. C'mere!"" She moved in for a kiss.

""Gross! Who ARE you?"" It was either Sara... or Angelica? But more of Angelica. But those features of Sara... HE WAS SO CONFUSED!

""You've got to be kidding,"" she sounded hurt. Then all of a sudden a pop came from the left. <s>Glinda the Good Witch</s> Gwenn appeared, looking annoyed. ""What do you think you're doing?"" she shook her head, and waved her wand. Then, she disappeared. By the way, she was wearing a big poofy pink dress.

Matty turned to look at the girl again. It was normal Angelica, thankfully.

<i>""Matty? Matty!""</i> He shook awake, for real this time, to his sister. ""You've got to stop eating those bean burritos before you go to sleep,"" she snorted, walking away.

Anyway, the new <i>man</i>'s head was filled with rather new thoughts to match his new name. How could hormones send a intelligent mind spinning so hard? In fact, how could hormones cause that gross pimple that had erupted on his forehead? He had <i>actually</i> needed to look up a <i>beauty</i> related spell. If that wasn't absurd enough, he had to deal with all the people watching <i>wittle Matty</i> picking out the beauty book [and then loudly discussing how his sister was in need of it.]

But all this was besides the point. The point was, that Matt<s>y</s> was no longer Matty. He had some growing up to do. Whatever this would mean, he wasn't quite sure, but he had this feeling that he would know it when he saw it, and it was that gut instinct that he was going to base his decisions on from now on."

<lj-cut text= ""Wasn't today supposed to be Friday?""> Wasn't today supposed to be Friday? A day of great anticipation for the oh so close weekend? Alas. One obnoxious Slytherin in Matthew Sanders' year had to make all this go to shame.

As far back as he could remember, he was Matty Sanders. <i>Everyone</i> called him that. Even his girlfriend called him Matty. It was what he was known by, other than Mister Sanders in the classroom. Sanders, Matty. What was the big deal, you might ask? Well, that question might be better directed to fourth year Charles Lincoln himself. In the words of the delicate Slytherin, ""Hey, <i>Maaaa-teeee</i>. Are you four, or fourteen?""

It was only fair for the rest of his house to carry on along.

Other remarks were as follows:

""Does wittle <i>Matty</i> need some supplies?"" [Potions]
""Mummy still change your diapers, Matty Watty?"" [DADA]
And a personal favorite- ""Waaaaaah Waaaaah Matty! May I spoon feed you?"" [Great Hall]

The last, and creepiest, was what threw the boy over the edge. What didn't help? His loving sister's perfectly timed greeting to the fourth year who entered the common room promptly after his spoon had begun jamming itself at his mouth.

""MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTY! MUMMY WROTE US TODAY!"" Sara had cheered gleefully.

The teen sneered. <i>Mummy?</i>

""Whatever.""

""C'mon Maaaaaatty!"" she urged, handing him the letter. ""It's good! Mum's got some news!""

""Shut up.""

""<i>Matty</i>?"" she asked, looking at him incrediously, ""Matty what's wrong?""

""It's <i>Matt</i> now,"" he spat, the last three words Sara <i>ever</i> expected to hear out of the boy's mouth."

He hadn't expected his package to arrive during breakfast, so the shock of it nearly knocking his juice into his lap was quite unarranged.

He made off to the right, almost jogging."

""Excuse me, exactly what do you think you're doing?"" Matty towered over a younger child, crossing his arms like he was a Prefect. The younger student turned up, looking at him like he was nuts. No, Matty didn't have a badge, but upon a second look the kid decided Matty meant buisiness.

""Sorry.""

Sanders watched the younger one sulk, not putting up any more posters.

<font size= ""1"">ooc: Hokay, so you can either be the younger kid, or you can jump in as an older kid, an on looking prefect, a friend. WHATEVER! I tried to make it as open as possible. Even a teacher! :D"

Therefore, I'll be back in a few days! I'll keep you guys posted.

Take decent care of my characters! You can email me if you have anything urgent. :D I'll still be looking to procrastinate a TEENSIE bit.

"event","Misery.
In its purest form.
Matthew Sanders was used to acceling at almost everything.
He had the grades, he was pretty good with the ladies, and he could fly.
But he didn't make the team. His girlfriend dumped him. And he was pretty sure there was an assignment he was forgetting to do. In fact, he knew he wasn't going to do it anyway, so he didn't bother to ask anyone about it.

A small tear managed to escape his clenched eyes, Matty rolled his head over to cover that side of his face with his soft pillow.

Another one came, and the fourth year clenched his eyes and emotions harder, now stuffing his full face into the pillow. Exhaling, he sat for a moment, trying to think of anything, anything at all, so as to not wallow in his misery.


<font size= ""1"">ooc: This is for me to use for Matty/Sara, since there are no other fourth years. =[
Angelica can jump in when Sara mentions it! ^_^"

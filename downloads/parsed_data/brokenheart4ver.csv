"event","<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>Alright guys check this out, I went to the movies yesterday with Cecil and Meagan. So Ihad a feeling that it would suck cause cecil kept getting mad at me and all. So when I picked her up at her house Cecil looked gorgeus and she was acting strange and I felt that she was annoyed with me and all. So I go and then we watch the movie and i feel sad cause im having a day where i miss her and i want her. So then were watching it and then josh calls and megan and cecil say lets go say hi. So we go and then they werent going to see a movie and then cecil and meagan wanted to go with them. And I didnt want to go cause i wanted to be with my baby.and so i kept telling her lets go watch the movie. So she was like no im hungry and then that got me mad cause if we were going to hang out with them i wouldnt of bought my ticket. So i tell her one last time before i was going to go finish the movie and she still wanted to stay with her friends. So i left and i was watching the movie by myself. So i just called my mom to pick me up and i left. It was 9 30 when i left how pathetic. So then she calls and said i ditched her and shit and then she was like well i thought you were going to cum back since i always do. I luv her and i just tring to make things right between us. BUt ive tried my hardest and she still wants time.I think ive waited a long time already. I dont know what to do now. Its so difficult but oh well.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","<STRONG>Hey guys im updating again cause today has been very stressful for me and I feel really lonely. Today i chilled with a friend and then he left my house and shit. Well ill start off with the story before today that leads to all my stress. I got some weed from some guy that didnt want it cause he got it wet and for sum reason I took it from him. I thought by doing that shit that it will take my mind off things. So I put it in my drore to let it dry cause ut was so wet. It was there for 2 days before today happened. So when I chilled with my friend we were smoking his shit.I always think that it would get my mind off things. So we did and then I got really stoned today. So I just fell asleep to sleep it off and I did but when I woke up I had a headache. So then I went to practice and then when I got back home I went to Leahs house for a lil bit. So then my mom picked me up and then she asked me to be honest with her so I was like yeah whatsup. So then she told me about the shit she found in my drore. And I told her I was holding it for sum guy who asked me cause they were going to search him. So she was like oh and that she wasnt mad but then she was like well I told your dad and I know how he is. Hes so stupid i hate when he gets into my buissness and i hate when my mom brings him in shit cause he makes the smallest problem into the biggest problem and my mom knows that too but never learns. So she was like yeah were going to drug test you and shit and I got mad cause now im screwed. So then she was like well i only looked cause i got a instinct and we need to trust you. And i was like trust so you go snooping through my shit and i was pist. We were on our way to pick my brother up from work at MickyDs. So iwas mad and then i just left and walked home. So I talk to Cecil about it and she made me feel better. But i was mad still and she sort of got mad cause the way i was talking. So she got mad and shes the last person iwant to be mad at me. As it is everyone is. So then I feel bad and lonly and i hate when i feel like that. So then me and Cecil are mad and confused about shit and it brings more drama to my life.I dont know what to do. I hate wheb shit like this happens and I hate it more when my love is even more upset at me cause then i feel like the worst person on earth and i feel like i have nothing to live for.I just hope everything turns out alright. I dont like when im the center of attention in the bad ways.</STRONG>"

"event","<STRONG><FONT size=4>Hey people i havent updated in a while. Well today was alright.Class was boring and I fell a sleep stupid teacher has to wake up everyone. But after class Jacob the super senior took me to see my baby. I saw her for a lil bit and then I left home. I ate pizza and fell asleep. I woke up and had to got to practice. It was boring but I talked to Rebecca and some friends. Im the biggest slacker when it cums to things like track. So I came home watched the game and then worked out. Me and Cecil were kind of mad for a minute or two. So she called back and thenwe were talking for a lil. She said she has to talk for 20 minutes cause she was going to go to sleep early because she had to wake up kind of early. So I told her that I would talk to her till she fall asleep. So we were talking and she asked me to read the live journals cause she wanted to know if i had updated or not. So i got to her entry that she wrote me. So I read and then I was reading the comments. I read the one sal left and she got me mad cause of what he wrote and she was like ""oh hes smart"". And that got me mad cause to&nbsp; me that is the last thing i want to do is be friends with her. So when I got mad and I wasnt acting as sweet I was just like whatever she got mad. And then so we were arguing about the comment. So what do you know the 20 minutes was up and then she was like oh ihave to go and I was like well you can talk a lil bit. She was like no I cant. So then we hung up mad at each other. And now I feel all weird and stupid. Oh well I hope its just like this until tommorrow where everything is alright.</FONT></STRONG>"

<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>I feel stupid.Hopefully you are reading this and I've already left your house. I'm sorry for all the things that have been going on between us. I hate it just as much as you do. I never meant for things to end up the way they did and it sucks but you will always be so special to me. I remember the first time I saw you in 7th grade. I had the biggest crush on yo. Then whem we went out I would get butterflies, BIG butterflies. From time to time I still do. Then we ended up staying together for a pretty long time and you grew to be like the bigggest part in my life. I loved you sooooo much. I still love you. But you really hurt me when you would tell people we weren't going out when we were or when you would tell people that you didn't love me anymore. It's not just that you cheated on me so many times that we had to break up, it was that along with everythhing else. I was so hurt and I know I wasn't the greatest girlfriend. I messed up too.&nbsp;But I tried so hard to make you happy, I always put you before me. I'm so sorry that you are hurting right now the way I was when I wanted you and you didn't want me. It makes me sad to know that I'm the reason why you are so down. The whole thing with Ray is totally set&nbsp;aside from you. You guys are totally different from eachother and I'm sorry that I went to another guy so quickly. I didn't mean to and I shouldn't have. But you were my first love. I learned a lot of things from you. It's not a big deal between Ray and I and it's nothing serious. Don't worry and don't be sad over me. Be happy and have fun. We are too young to be dealing with stuff like this. I'm sorry I get mad about you writing all OUR buissness on the livejournal. I just don't want people to think badly about me. you know how bad I hate it when people don't like me. So that's how I feel. I'm always here for you Aaron. No matter what you need,if it's to talk or whatever. I LOVE YOU! Higher than the sky,deeper than the sea, farther than pluto, bighter than the sun. When we were together we grew to be best friends so I'm here and I care about you Aaron. In time you'll feel better and thigs will satrt to look better. If it's meant to happen we'll find our way to eachother again. K I should stop writing noe cuz I can see you on your couch getting all anxious for me to stop. Love you, always and forever!!!!!</FONT></STRONG></P>"

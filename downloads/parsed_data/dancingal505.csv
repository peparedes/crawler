Remi and my superlative picture was totally awesome. I'm excited.

I was in a weirdly good mood for most of the day...until some stuff happened...but it'll be okay, I think.

I finally recorded the clarinet piece I'm sending to college...it went well, I believe.

The North-South game was AWESOME. I love our school...we have so much spirit it is absolutely ridiculous. 47-0, fools! WHOSE SOCKS ARE THESE?!? NORTH SOCKS!

After the game was fun too...went to Friday's for my first meal in like...11 hours, haha. The company wasn't so bad either, ;-).

Busy weekend homework-wise though..unfortunately. Nice end to a bad week though."

"event","<P>You know, I keep telling myself and telling myself that I can't wait for graduation day to come. I've always felt that I couldn't wait to get out of this school and out of this town and away from the high school&nbsp;life forever and move forward. Nevertheless, it's on weeks like this one where I feel so sad thinking that I will have to leave all of this behind in nine months. Homecoming week - spirit week, the decorating, the pep rally, the football game - is one of my favorite weeks out of the year. I always just feel like our entire class comes together, especially with the decorating...and last night, that happened more than ever before. I suddenly felt so close to everyone in our class and as I was driving home last night, I realized that I don't know if I'm ready to leave just yet. Other times come up and I'm sure I will again feel as though I just want it all to be over...but right now, I just want to hold onto everything little by little. I love these people....I love the Class of 2006. We're awesome. We may not have officially won hall decorations, but we know that ours was the best anyway. It's so sad thinking that we'll never get to decorate again...I won't ever spend hours after school all week again...or get stressed beyond belief while decorating, only to have it all come together in the last half hour...we won't ever go to another pep rally and scream and cheer so loud for our class...</P>
<P>So begins our year of ""last's."" I think I'm finally beginning to comprehend what every senior has told me about their own last year of high school - that everyone becomes so close and you end up not wanting to leave right away. </P>
<P>""I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself to hold onto these moments as they pass""</P>

"event","I just found this from freshmen year in my old Xanga entries...

I just got home from graduation...it was really nice..very sad. It was sad that they're all leaving...and it also made me think about when I'm graduating. I mean, yeah, it's 3 years which is a while...but it also isn't. Middle school was 3 years...and think how fast that went by...and this year went so fast...so who's to say that next three won't either. I don't want to leave...I just want things to stay like this forever...but I know everyone has to grow up sometime. I just don't want to. 


I still can't believe we'rea ctually seniors."

"event","Well if I was in your position
Id put down all my ammunition
I'd wondered why'd it taken me so long
But Lord knows that I'm not you
And If I was I wouldn't be so cruel
Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do



.....Right. Psh.


I found this from an old entry over a year ago. I thought it was interesting and I'd repost.

In LA today we spent a long time discussing the illusion of the green light in the novel The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald...and we discussed Gatsby's belief that one can, in fact, live in the past and, in essence, make things exactly the same as they used to be as if no time has passed. I don't agree...there is no way that anyone could get anywhere in life if they refuse to accept reality and move ahead, rather than backwards. However, I do wish sometimes that it were possible to redo events of the past or relive it or whatnot...it'd make change a whole lot less unnecessary. Wishful thinking, I suppose.
I guess it's sort of a good thing that reality is really setting in...it'll help me to accept things, I guess. It's the initial BANG...that moment when all of a sudden, things seem real. It's almost like someone comes up to you and slaps in the face, waking you up from the fantasy world you were trying to hold onto. And then comes the burn...the stinging raw feeling you're left with after the inital slap...and that's when the pain comes. The pain doesn't set in until right away, you know? It takes some time. That is exactly how I feel...I knew things were changing for a while now and I was slapped a while ago...it's just...the burning sensation hasn't set in until right now. And it hurts. A lot.
""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....And one find morning -    So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" - The Great Gatsby"

"event","Now I was sitting waiting wishing
That you believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs
But Lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the Lord, no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting waiting on you?
Must I always be playing playing your fool?

I sing ya songs I dance a dance
I gave ya friends all a chance
Putting up with them wasn't worth never having you
And maybe you been through this before
But its my first time
So please ignore
The next few lines cause they're directed at you

I cant always be waiting waiting on you
I cant always be playing playing your fool
I keep playing your part
But its not my scene
Wont this plot not twist?
I've had enough mystery.
Keep building me up, then shooting me down
Well im already down
Just wait a minute
Just sitting waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting waiting

Well if I was in your position
Id put down all my ammunition
I'd wondered why'd it taken me so long
But Lord knows that I'm not you
And If I was I wouldn't be so cruel
Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do

Must I always be waiting waiting on you?
Must I always be playing playing your fool?
No I cant always be waiting waiting on you
I cant always be playing playing your fool, foool"

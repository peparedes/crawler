"event","I'm not invited to Thanksgiving and Christmas this year!  

I'm also being forced to wear a large red ""A"" on my garb at all times.  The guilt is betwixt Almighty and mine own self.

So yeah, probably contrary to what I have been informed, I am going to NYC with my mom.  And by that, I mean living there.  I mean, it's a fantastic oppurtunity and all, but I don't really want to move yet.  I'd rather save that for when I get out of high school.  However, this may be my only chance to get out, so I'm thinking that I might as well take it.  Eh?  No one'd still be left here to miss me anyways.  That's not intended to stir up pity and such, I'm being sincere.  Sadly.

The alternative route is staying here and moving in with my dad.  I don't really care much for that choice.  

I'm going down to Tuscon to see Michael Moore speak on Monday at U of A.  How fucking exciting.  Shit.  Seriously!  Shit."

I wish.

My family excommunicated me.  I feel like such a Lutheran.  
Seriously, they won't talk to me anymore.  Not that I really am eager to talk with them, but... you know...

I haven't really had much luck being able to talk to people lately.  I'm rather lonely, as a matter of fact.  But I don't suppose sitting here typing about it will make much of a difference.  Not unless the words on here will somehow mutate and align themselves into the form of a human.

....

No, it's not working.  Anyways,  no new big news on the whole situation, no one tells me anything.  

No one comes and visits me or calls me, so that's kind of depressing as well...  Not that I blame anyone, but, you know, I get kind of lonely, and the lack of human contact isn't really what I want right now.  

It's been raining a lot lately.  Off an on, and all that type of thing.  Once, it rained so hard that it blew the yard umbrella over the fence and into the neighbor's backyard.  We've never talked to them before, but I climbed up on the wall (I wasn't wearing a shirt, either, which probably should have frightened them off) and got her attention.  I asked if it was okay if I pulled the heavy yard decoration over the wall, and she nodded her head and called her husband.  Then they both stood in the doorway and watched me struggle with the umbrella in the rain.  I thanked them for their help, and they went back inside.

On Saturday I went out and walked to the Presbytarian church down the street.  I waited outside for the minister to come out when the service was over.  I shook hands with him as though I had listened to his sermon and was very impressed.  He told me ""Have a blessed day,"" and that was all I needed.

Needless to say, Saturday was blessed.  The view from my bedroom window never looked prettier.

:)

18. Kids fall down easily when you push them.
19. Its hard to explain to parents why you pushed their son down onto the floor.
20. Its hard to get the finger paint out of your pants that the kid smeared on you before you pushed him down.

Greg cut off his beard.  And then he shot at a jackrabbit and some pigeons untill O'Brien came.  At that point I drove here to the ""CORPORATE OFFICE"".  They're probably still there discussing art or world affairs or talking about which wine bar they should visit after they attend the opera.  

Its a well of sophistication here at John F. Long Properties, LLLP."

"event","I never do this.  Different experience.




Unstable, unhinged and unfed
(Who's that boy you're leaning on?)
The matron refuses to wed
(His shoulder's as cold as a goth song)

The lights go out 
(But his pale saint complexion lingers)
The film is long, bland and overdone
(Unlocked her will with fingers)

Summers go and lovers come
(And some stay for dinner)
Her shadow fades in the warm sun
(Uninvited guests are always a winner)

Evening creeps through her underrated head
(Melting in the morning sun)
Virago will publish her dreams when she's dead
(And she's not the only one)

Her shiny pink shoes won't help out here
(An uncontested slave to men)
Let it all flood into her ear
(I gave up and then read it again)"

"event","I didn't sleep well last night; when I finally did, the sun was up.  It was half determination to finish the project I was working on, half emotional deprivation... and half stupidity.  I've really got to change some things, or else my life is going to be miserable.  

At this moment, I don't need excitment or new surroundings or anything that I thought I needed before.  Its strange, but I have this odd desire to be liked by people.

"event","The past weekend has been odd.  A bad taste in my mouth that won't leave, no matter how much water I consume.  It had lovely moments, as well as profoundly depressing ones.  

I look on other people's journals (strangers) and realize that the journal is a big part of their lives; either they use it to tell friends about their day, or use it to express some buried idea in their head in hopes that someone will find it and make it better for them.  Or they use it to drop snide hints about the person they are currently infatuated with, in hopes that they will read and think ""wow... not only is this guy into emo punk music, but i think he likes me! *swoon*"" 

And its not like its any of buisness to say that about them, because i have no use for this journal. 

No one does."

Too many posts begin with ""Today...""


Quite a while after the sun made its much-expected appearance today at 5:47 Ante Meridian, I went over to see Brittney, which was lovely, as well as getting the amazingly amazing care package.  I doubt I will ever get something more wonderful than that from anyone.  That was the coolest gift I've ever received.  Thank you very very very much, Brittney.


And then my mother got home."

Because of what happened back in May, I'm not allowed to really go out anymore, so I suppose that's why I'm on here forever now.  Thanks a lot."

"event","ahh...my mom is so awesome. She let me stay home on Club Day cause it's not like any of my classes do anything. I slept in until 10:30 while the rest of the kiddos went to school I was sleeping. It feels soo good! Then out to lunch and a quick shopping spree, DMV to pick up that stupid handbook I have to read and out to dinner. I think I lost my handbook already. lol. o well. The greatest thing about the whole day is that I got to relax from school. All the teachers are piling extra work to get ready for exams. 

i. missed. you. today.

"event","I spent most of my day rewriting my research essay for I.S. cause my old one sucked. Then I gave up and went to the spa with my mom. I'm very relaxed now, but not for long because it's the busy week, the week before exams. I hate exams.

Bai you are soo funny when you're drunk. Don't worry you didn't say anything mean to me, but I was crying when I was on the phone with you cause I was laughing so hard. You crack me up. You're such an awesome bartender, I definitely want to learn from the best. It's going to be so great when the kidds you're babysitting are like, ""Why is my babysitter laughing and falling all over the place?"" lol. 

My mom is so awesome. Day off to go shopping, I need that day of relaxation from school. Lo you better be able to come with me. Even if you can't, I'm still coming to pick you up. =D

To all the people in the group, don't forget to bring your J. Rockets hat loves.

Today was my first FREE FRIDAY since football season ended! I've missed going out on friday nights. Rachel, LaUR, kyLe, and I went to the movies and Ryan came and hung out with us. ""After the Sunset"" is a weird movie. The people sitting behind us were hilarious. lol. Why did I miss so much of what happened when I went to get a drink? It was pretty eventful. JoHnnY RocKetS is gorgeous, I'll try not to empty the straws all over the table. I am a really nice person because i put the straws back in, hopefully noone will use it cause there were some ketchup smears on it. =D Laur thought the johnny rockets hat was a napkin so she used it to wipe her mouth. That ketchup stain is so hott. ilu raCh and LaUR!

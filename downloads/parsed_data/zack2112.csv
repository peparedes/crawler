I like driving with him, there are always good talks.<br /><br /><br />Tonight it was about people and how everyone should <font size=""3"">learn to live.</font>&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />He also gave me my favorite definition of insanity:<br /><br />Insanity - Repeating the same action and expecting a different outcome.<br /><br /><font size=""3"">And last but not least</font> about how people bottle up anger, make the people around them feel like they are an inch tall, only to finish them off with some small remark and an incredible explosion. All of the anger can be subsided by talking and letting people know when they have crossed the line. The worst thing a person can do is pretend nothing is wrong until the damage is done.<br />After that, there is no turning back.<br /><br /><font size=""3"">The sad truth is, The people you hurt the most, are the people you love the most.&nbsp;<br /><br /><font size=""2"">It was a good night, I really enjoy our talks.

"event","So alot has actually happened in the last week. 
Things arnt that bad,&nbsp;I cant&nbsp;complain too much 
I got my STP tickets, My amp is repaired and I have it back, 
Anita and I are going to prom, that should&nbsp;definately be a good time,&nbsp; 
Ive already got my tux and stuff, Im not usually &nbsp;one for dances but I think it will be more enjoyable going with a friend. I know I will have a good time with Anita, It wont be super awkward feeling nor will I be super worried about everything I do or say. If I were going with someone who wasnt just a friend I know I would be a mess mentally. 
Craig, Jerome, Dan and I all have been practicing and it paid off. 
We had our share of problems but it all worked out, I killed the solo on Slither. It was badass. Ive watched it like 900 times. With that being said I was hoping for a little more of a response from people, but such is life.&nbsp; 
I got to watch most of the new scrubs the other night, that was excellent. 
I also got some new fish in my aquarium, and lost a few fish in my aquarium. oh well. Win some loose some.&nbsp; 
Im registered for delta, I wish I could still go to Alma or somewhere else but since I still plan on going to Galloup when im finished there is no way I could afford it.&nbsp;I think my schedual will be nice tho, plus&nbsp;I might get to live at the cabin. 
I talked to Chrissy for a while again&nbsp;the other day, she gets out of school next week and told me as soon as she gets home shes calling me and that&nbsp;I owe it to her to hang out some night and go bowling. Its good talking to her more again, it kinda sucks at times that shes at UofM cause shes pretty rad and i never get to hang out with her anymore.&nbsp; 

I think thats about it for big stuff this week. I guess there wasnt as much as I thought there was. Back to tonight, we had Senior Oscar Night. I expected it to be kinda shitty but I ended up having a pretty good time. We rocked the shit out of the place. Enough so to get Mrs. Kinkma to leave in disgust. Great Success &lt;- (insert Borat accent) 

Like I said, I ripped the solo, I think it was most definately my best run through. I was a very happy person.&nbsp;I hope it sounded good from the crowd. I couldnt hear shit on stage and the camera that filmed us had awful audio, nevertheless, I still love the tape. 

&nbsp;After the show I went to Ashleys house. Craig, Sarah, Dylan, Noel, Kevin, and Dan were also there. Anita, Laura and Lauras friend were all planning on dropping by I think but&nbsp;I dont know if they did. &nbsp;I like hanging out and having a good time with those guys, I dont get to do it often. But they were all drinking,with the exception of Craig and I dont think Sarah was.&nbsp;I dont like to be around it when&nbsp;I dont have to, I felt kinda bad leaving them, but at the same time I didnt. It bothered me when Sarah asked if I was going so if they drank she wouldnt be the only one not drinking, it sounded like she didnt want to be ""uncool"" for not drinking. I really dont think it was meant this way, it just bugged me that she would worry about being the only one not drinking besides Craig. So basically I was there for about 5-10 minutes and went for a drive before coming home.&nbsp; 

I think&nbsp;that I might be on some unstable ground with a few of my friends, Ive been pretty edgy and easily aggravated lately. Now that the show is over I feel much more like myself and alot more laid back. I think I can smooth things over.&nbsp; 

Things are pretty good and summers on its way. Im definately ready."

Mother fucking </font><font size=""6""><font size=""7"">STP</font>. </font><font size=""3"">Their first tour in 8 years and its gonna be fucking rad.&nbsp;<br /><br /></font><font size=""2"">I was pissed at first due to several&nbsp;errors in the checkout stage&nbsp;because ticketmasters servers were overloading and <strong>tickets were going like 12093812979871235821634.237429374 X the speed of sound.<br /></strong>I went from row&nbsp;G of the lower balcony seats 1-5 center stage.... to only 3 seats in the upper balcony in row U... oh well. Im fucking going. And <font size=""4"">its gonna&nbsp;be fucking rad.<br /></font>&nbsp;<br />I am pretty lucky because<font size=""4""> after</font> <font size=""5"">20 minutes</font> <font size=""4"">they were</font> <font size=""5"">sold out</font> <font size=""3"">of even two seats next to each other</font>. By now if they are not sold out completely there may be a couple single seats left. the last time i checked for a single seat was at 10:45 and there was 1 in the upper balcony far left in row S. The only way you can get a ticket now is if you pay&nbsp;$45 to get in the fan club, plus $240 for a VIP Ticket.<br /><br />Im not mad at all right now. Because <font size=""3"">of the 2500&nbsp;tickets for the show, I have 3 of them.&nbsp;</font><br /><br /><font size=""4"">Im so fucking amped right now. I cant wait.

You can't escape the master keeper

Made your bed, rest your head

"event","Reverend reverend is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins
An image beneath me
Whats within our plans for life
It all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world
Left in my misery...

The reverend he turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes
It's nothing new for him to see
I didn't ask him why
I will remember
The love our souls had
Sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see
Now is your (face)

Well I guess
You took my youth
I gave it all away
Like the birth of a
New-found joy
This love would end in rage
And when she died
I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
Memories now unfold.

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the
Cemetery gates

Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last

Through all those
Complex years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own
And when she died
I should've cried and spared myself some pain...
Left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain

The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates"

in other news i got to pick up my guitar and it it awsome, that dude is great. sounds and plays heavenly. but now i dont get it until christmas so thats gonna be tough. 

im off to bed, gonna catch the one hour tribute to dimebag tonight at midnight on z93. thats it for now.

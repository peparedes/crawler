"event","I went to see Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. The effects was awesome and the acting was alright. The new Star Wars does not compare to the old ones. Star Wars Revenge of the Sith is good so go see it, Star Wars fans. 

Yesterday, I spent most the times somewhere and than back home to watch MLS DC United vs Wizards. The game was exciting to watch. I was a big fan of DC United and now I think I am back to being a big fan again. Final score: DC United [3] and Wizards [2]."

"event","OMG! My heart was pounding so fast.

I went downstair to grab a glass of milk. On the way to the refrigerator, I saw a centipede at the dark area of the table and freaked out. That thing scared the hell out of me. Insects like the centipede can scare the shit out of me, lol."

"event","I am so angry right now because I lost the work that I did on the computer for about an hour. Damn power had to go out when I was about half-way done with it. I think the entire city power went out for about a few minutes around early in the morning. The people that live across the street are so stupid and ignorant. Running out of the house screaming when the power went out. I was like wth! There is like this painful lump on my armpit that I noticed last night. 

People always asking me why am I always staying up so late. Why sleep when your lifespan is short. Enjoy life while it lasted even though it sucks. Also I always end up having something to do in the middle of the night, like eating and helping people. I am always hungry at night. I have to eat before I sleep or I can't sleep at all. This web hosting business is starting to wear me out. 


I gave this person the wrong answer last night. I hope she understands what I was trying to say. I think she is made at me now because of it.


""You may not look like a supermodel, but you are fine the way you are.""
I mean't to say that she is gorgeous.
I hate myself. I get soo sentimental when watching romantic movies and such."

"event","I really hate not seeing the people that I cared about. They probably don't feel that same way as I do, but damn I miss them. I am stressing myself out too much about these kind of stuff. Can't think about anything else if I kept thinking of them. I really do miss them. I wish there something I could do  that would fix everything."

"event","I just came from playing with the kids next door. I was going to go outside skateboarding but than my niece want ride her bike outside so I couldn't skate. Anywayz I did not feel like skateboarding because 1. the surface is not good to skate on and 2. I was tired from no sleep at all, so didn't have the energy to push.  I did an ollie once but than couldn't do it again, lol. My step-sister almost fell when tryin gto ride it. She didn't even place her other foot on the board, hahaa. Kicked the socerball back and forth to my niece and the neighbor son. I think he is like around 4 or 5 and really cute. My niece didn't want to kick anymore so it was just me and him kicking back and forth to each other. I think I kick the ball too hard... but i didn't think so. I still can do my special kick. :)/. First time I ever did something like this in years. Probably will be the last time. I am really so tired and feel like I am about to die. I wish my hair grow back faster. Looking at the picture below of me with long hair making me feel sad about the past.

"event","Well everyone, I will be on the quest to finding myself.

Yesterday I started a site called Rock Whores for all lovers of rock music and other genres. You can visit the site at Rock Whores at rockwhores.org but at the moment the site is under construction, so visit the forums at http://www.rockwhores.org/board. There, you can chit-chat just about anything. Start posting and help make Rock Whores grows. I will be creating an online radio station for it soon. Just come, talk and support the community. Thanks, bye."

"event","I am so hyper right now. Today was the best 3-4 hours sleep I have ever had. Ok so, I slept like around 4am and than woke up at around 8am. At the same time, I do feel sleepy but also feeling so lively and energetic. I was talking to myself downstair in the kitchen a few minutes ago. When I don't get enough sleep or don't get any sleep at all, I talk to myself. Sometimes I talk out loud but usually just silently to myself and than laugh at what I said, LOL. Anywayz, I started this community called Rock Whores, rockwhores.org, a few days ago. I was just setting it up yesterday and still working on it. Soon, I will have an online radio station for it. Also, if anyone need hosting, leave me a comment or email me at phu_n@axehosting.net and I will give you a special offer. The hosting company is called Axe Hosting, axehosting.net. Anywayz, I have nothing else to write, later."

"event","Well, I am back after a few days break from using livejournal and other online journals. Had nothing to do at the moment so I decided to check back into livejournal with a new screen name. That Jack Skellington icon looks sweet. I found it when searching on Google for Jack Skellington aim icon.

Been worried and sad for the past couple weeks. I called the CollegeBoard's to check if they received my SAT application and so as I suspected, they didn't. I mailed my application in last month and so I guess it got lost in the mail. I found out a friend of mine died of cancer when his brother told me online 2 days ago. I wish I could have seen him before he left this world. I remembered when we had classes together. HAHA, alot of loud laughters and etc, good times. Wish I could turn back times; [goodbye man, u'll always bee remembered.]

As always, I just can't wait to get out on my own. Living in this house is driving me insane. *signing off"

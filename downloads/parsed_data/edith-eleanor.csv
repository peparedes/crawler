he feels like shit. i feel like shit. i just dont understand how 
it can feel so awful to break up with someone 
youre not in love with anymore.
it should be a breeze. not. my exboyfriends are
not exboyfriends. theyre victims. and i hate that.
but i dont what i could possibly do about it.
wouldnt it be worse to stay together when you know
you dont love them back?? 
ughhhhh

i know no one reads my livejournal but i'm posting this here
so i can at least make some kind of public statement about the
break up without him seeing it. he's so heartbroken that it literally 
makes me feel like the most evil woman who ever set foot

So I don't mind if they don't understand,

Cause they don't know about us, they've never heard of love.
Why should it matter to us if they don't approve?
We should just take our chances what if we've got nothing to lose?
Baby, there's no need for living in the past,
Cause now I found good lovin', gonna' make it last.
I tell the others, ""don't bother me"",
Cause when I look at you, they don't see what I see.
And I don't listen to their wasted lines,
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs.

my teacher made a list of all the things unique about 
me to help me with my college application essays,
and at the end she put ""what it means to sacrifice
for others."" i had to ask to go to the bathroom 
because i was about to cry. that's the nicest
thing anyone has ever said about me."

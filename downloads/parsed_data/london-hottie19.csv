"event","So fall break was good.  Not long enough at all and I didn't get any work done.  I did see season one of Desperate housewives so I am totally up to date with what is happening!!  I got some cute hoodies (1 is for Christmas), cute shoes, new purse (also for Christmas) and I re-stocked what I had ran out of.  Rachel didn't come in for the weekend like she was going to and that was sad but I went out with Dan on Friday, that is a very good story, if you want to know ask ;)

We went out Sat. to Chef Paul's (YUM German food!!!) Bethany came with.  She and Louie are gone this entire week in Minnesota.  A week long trip ... Yes I am thinking the exact same thing (EEEEK!!!)  Sunday was good ... came back didn't really study for french.  I got a B on my theo midterm, when she was going over it I realized some stupid mistakes I made, meh next time.  There is more about today ... maybe for the other journal though ..."

"event","Go back...

Before the Internet or the AIM

Before semi automatics and weed

Before playstation2 or X-bOX

Before the 5 hours of homework you put off every night...


Way back...


I'm talkin' bout hide and go seek at dusk.

Red light, Green light.

Playing kickball & dodgeball until your porch light came on.

Mother May I?

Red Rover

four square

Hula Hoops

Running through the sprinkler

Happy Meals

Getting the privelage to sit in the front seat of the car



Wait...

Watchin' Saturday Morning cartoons

Like Hey Arnold and Doug

Or what about legends of the hidden temple, global guts, double dare, and who, ARE YOU AFFRAID OF THE DARK!

Who could forget Snick

Or the teenage mutant ninja turtles,and Power Rangers,


Christmas morning...

Your first day of school

Bedtime Prayers and Goodnight Kisses



Climbing trees

Getting an ice cream off the ice cream truck

A million mosquito bites and sticky fingers

Jumpin' down the steps

Jumpin' on the bed

Pillow fights

Runnin' till you were out of breath

Laughing so hard that your stomach hurt and you almost peed your pants

Being tired from playin' all day

Your first crush...

Rainy days at school meant playing ""Heads up 7-Up"" in the classroom

Remember that?



I'm not finished yet...

Kool-Aid was the drink of the summer

Giving your friends a ride on your handlebars or spokes

Wearing your new shoes on the first day of school

Class Field Trips

When nearly everyone's mom was at home when the kids got there.

When getting high was swinging on the swingset

When $5 seemed like a million, and another dollar a Miracle.

When your parents took you to McDonalds and you were so cool.

When Toys r Us overuled the ""mall""


I want to go back to the time when...

Decisions were made by going ""eeny-meeny-miney-moe""

Mistakes were corrected by simply exclaiming, ""do over!""

""Race issue"" meant arguing about who ran the fastest.

Money issues were handled by whoever was the banker in ""monopoly""

Catching fireflies could happily occupy an entire evening

It wasn't odd to have two or three ""best"" friends.

Being old, referred to anyone over 20.

The worst thing you could catch from the opposite sex was cooties.

Nobody was prettier than Mom

Nobody was cooler than Dad

Scrapes and bruises were kissed and made better

It was a big deal to finally be tall enough to ride the ""big people"" rides at the amusement park.

Getting an inch of snow was a dream come true.

Abilities were discovered because of a ""double-dog-dare""

Spinning around, getting dizzy and falling down was cause for giggles.


If you can remember most or all of these, then you have LIVED!!!



Pass this on to anyone who may need a break from their ""grown up"" life...


i double dog dare you"

SO last night ... tres interessant! Rachel and I shopped all day ... I
got AWESOME clothes and I didn't pay full price for a single
item!&nbsp; She talked me into getting this shirt http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/london_hottie19/detail?.dir=/2333&.dnm=d878.jpg&.src=ph
 ok so I was Dan Karpierz's 21st b-day so we were
going to go hang out with them (Karpierz, Kadzik, Serrittella, Duffy,
etc. etc.) and we knew that Wilk and Walker/Dee were going to be there
sometime during the night but we were not expecting all three of them
to be there and right inside the door when we walked in.&nbsp; HOLY
COW!! it was like ice when we walked in the door.&nbsp; Very
uncomfortable for Rachel.&nbsp; We ended up talking to Serrittella and
Cinert for the 30 min we were there and Cinert was complaining about
how he hated his job (works in cement) and how he wished he would never
have dropped out of HS.&nbsp; Rachel and I decided that it was really
sad that he felt like that ... *sigh* I would feel like a bia if I said
what else we said about it but I think you can assume about the rest of
it.<br>
<br>
Hmmmm that is all I got for now ... <br>

Motivated and focused, you are good at getting what you want
You rule at success, but success doesn't rule you.

I am soooo excited about that.<br>
<br>
Also we (Becky &amp; I) finally got our tv at a really good price a 20
in. for 89.99.&nbsp; I know it's sweet.&nbsp; There was a problem
though when we went to pick it up the last one was damaged, whiched
peeved us off 'cause we weren't notified and drove out there to pick it
up.&nbsp; So we had to go back out tonight to fix it and there are more
coming in on Weds. so we will hopefully be able to pick it up that
night ... and we're still getting it at the same price.<br>
<br>
HMMMM what else has happened this week ... I tripped a lot at work this week :)<br>

"event","If you laughed while reading this you must be a Lutheran.

The following list was compiled by a 20th century  Lutheran who,
observing other Lutherans, wrote down exactly what he saw or heard:
 
1. Lutherans believe in prayer but would practically die if  asked to  pray  out loud.

2. Lutherans like to sing except when confronted  with a new hymn or a hymn with more than four stanzas.

3. Lutherans  believe their pastors will visit them in the hospital even if  they don't  notify them that they are there.

4. Lutherans usually follow the official  liturgy and will feel it is their way of suffering for their sins.

5.  Lutherans believe in miracles and even expect miracles, especially
during  their stewardship visitation programs or when passing the plate.

6. Lutherans feel that applauding for their children's choirs would  make  them too proud  and conceited.

7. Lutherans think that the Bible prohibits them from crossing the aisle
while passing the peace.

8. Lutherans drink coffee as if it were the Third Sacrament.
 
9. Some Lutherans still believe that an ELCA bride and an LCMS groom
make for a mixed marriage.
 
10. Lutherans feel guilty for not staying to clean up after their own wedding reception in the  Fellowship Hall.
 
11. Lutherans are willing to pay up to a dollar for a meal  at church.

12. Lutherans think that Garrison Keeler stories are totally factual.
 
13. Lutherans still serve Jell-O in the proper liturgical color  of the season and think that peas in a tuna noodle casserole adds  too much  color.

14. Lutherans believe that it is OK to poke fun at  themselves and  never
take themselves too seriously.

 And finally, you know when you're a Lutheran when:
 
* You hear something really funny during the sermon and smile as  loudly
as  you can!

* Its 100 degrees, with 90% humidity, and you still have coffee after the  service.

* Doughnuts are a line item in the church budget, just like coffee.

* The communion cabinet is open to all, but the coffee cabinet  is locked up tight.
 
* All your relatives graduated from a school named  Concordia.

* When you watch a ""Star Wars"" movie and they say, May the  Force  be with you, you respond, and also with you.

* You actually understand those folks from Lake Wobegon, MN.

* And lastly, it takes at the VERY least ten minutes to say good-bye"

"event","Ok so one of my brilliant radio ideas(not the one I wrote about before) is to see if I can get 30 minutes a week and do like an old radio drama!  I have been looking to find them at the library, online ... everywhere.  I might actually have to write this thing and I found this book at the library ""The Offical Movie Plot Generator""  I figure some of the plots could work for the radio.  So here are some of them. 

VOTE FOR YOUR FAV!!

1) A bumbling nerd challenges the social mores of upper class society with a cunning elf, an obese ogre and a belligerent dwarf (I totally know who I would ask to play the dwarf :) )

2) A Catholic priest indulges in beer bashes, toga parties, and an assortment of ill-advised high jinks with a wise cracking robot

3) A burned out hippie travels through time with the help of the ghost of Elvis

4) A ruthless mafia kingpin raises a baby set to an all-star '80's soundtrack featuring Air Supply, Journey and Survivor

5) A group of cantankerous senior citizens become nannies for a conservative aristocratic family in a rousing adaptation of the broudway musical"

"event","This weekend has been really good.  I don't really think I did anything super exciting Friday.  It was my day off so I watched a lot of ""Sports Night"".  It was really good ... too bad it went off of the air.  I had a very odd convo with Mike.  It was kind of like playful banter ... oddness ... then his b-day came up and I said something about how it what his present was didn't matter anymore and he kept asking what it was ... it was more oddness.  Dad and I went to see the 5th Dimension at the Eyes to the Skies Fest.  It was sweeeet.  I got a cd and they all autographed it ... now I can play more of their songs.  I had to use a port-a-potty there ... EWWWW never again!!

Saturday was an AWESOME day.  Got up early for WW (not so good ... 6 am :( )  I lost .6  .... better than gaining :)  Then it was off to work ... which went really fast I think it was 'cause I did the newspapers which takes up a good 30 minutes and I actually like doing that so I think it made it a good shift.  Finally got my paycheck and I realized that my salary this summer is $9.15 per hour :)  Kinda chilled for the afternoon and dinner time.  Oh I was looking hot last night.  I am now able to wear my belt on another notch in and this is the last notch on the belt ... so now I need to get a new black belt along with new capris!! I was also wearing my gray Valpo t-shirt which makes my boobs look HUGE ... I was looking fine!

Then Rachel and I decided to take in the fireworks at Eyes to the Skies.  The fireworks were sweet ... Rachel always goes to a sport near the softball scoreboard and DAMN was it a good spot.  Sara A., Megan F. and Emily also joined us for them.  After that we decided to walk around the fest and boy did it get interesting.  The first people we see are Walker and Rachel Dee.  OH  it was toooo funny ... well for me at least ... the story revolving those three is waaaay too long for this journal entry if you really want to know i'll inform ya.  Karpierz ,aka Dan #2, was with them and as me and Rachel were trying to avoid walking by them he came up and talked to us for a bit.  It was odd ... he was nice ... very odd. 

So we started walking around again and there was a group of guys and like the boy crazy girl I am I decided I was going to check them out and who was among them but one of my very good friends from waaay back (before junior high) who moved my junior year of high school to Pennsylvania Dan Tower!!!  I was ESTATIC!!!!  I love Dan Tower.  He is going to Columbia and of course is a theater major.  It was soooooo awesome to see him!!

After talking to Dan Tower for a bit we went off.  We came across Nielson, his gf Bridget and Serrittella (soo cute).  Rachel, who was wearing a Sox shirt (bleh), and Serritella, who was wearing a Cubs shirt (point for him), got into their usual fight ... I find it quite amusing when the argue 'cause Serrittella always does his little ... I guess the only way to describe it with out doing it would be a manly bark ... it's really funny I will demonstrate with the proper amount of liquor.  So we were talking to them for a a few minutes and guess who we see coming in our direction?!? Dan Wilk aka Dan #3 ... we don't like him very much.  Rachel swore really loudly when she saw him ... very funny.  Oh and Walker and Rachel Dee we now in front of us when we had walked away from them before ... very odd.  

Wilk not acting like the dumb ass he usually is decided to be smart and avoid walking anywhere near us ... Rachel was going to punch him in the face and I was going to kick him in the groin.  Still talking to Serrittella and Nielson ... found out that Dan Kadzik aka Dan #1 *swoon* was actually in the fest (by the beer tent ... of course) sadness ... we both wanted to see him but were not willing to pay $9 each to see him.  Since we had walked around the entire carnival part ... saw the people we wanted to see('cept Kadzik), some we didn't want to see ... Rachel and I decided that Lisle was boring and headed over to downtown Naperville.

We walked out to the car with Sara, Megan & Emily.  Rachel had been playing the cd she got me and the song that came up was the Discovery Channel ... so Sara and Emily had to attack Megan in the back seat ... see the pic on the website.  Very hilarious ... Sara booty dancing on the back of her car.  We walked down the Riverwalk.  We found a pretty cool spot with some nice benches and there were lots of viney plants ... a good make out spot we decided.  I will have to remember this for me and Dan later on this summer ... Thinking about him right now I only have six more weeks to have a fling ... I better get cracking  ... the beginning of the summer was taken over by what ever the heck was going on between me and Mike so I didn't put the plan into action but I will definately do it now.

Rachel and I talked about multiple things most of which I cannot remember.  I do remember talking about when we become parents and how we were both worried that we would be the kind of parents whose kids drink and smoke all the time are 16 and have 26 yr old bf's with kids.  I want to have a relationship like my parents and raise my kids the way they did me ... I hope I am a good parent.

That is the short version of Saturday.  Today was pretty good.  Went to church they switched around the order of the service and it was a long one today so I only got to hear about 5 minutes of the sermon before I had to go to work ... oh what a good Christen I am.  Work was good did papers again so the shift went by pretty fast.  The creepy moniter seemed to be following me around again ... freaks me out.  Had frozen California Pizza Kitchen BBQ chicken pizza for dinner ... SOOOOOO good.  I recommend it ... I took off the onions though.   

OH and refering to the music I am listening to ... yes I do have this song on cd ... Thanks to Rachel for it.  I will be making my own little dance video this week to it ... for very exclusive viewing only!!  I hope Meghan and Britta like the song because I have a feeling they might be hearing it a lot this next year.  Tomorrow is going to be fun ... dying of the hair and Lou & Bethany are coming over for dinner!!!  

WHEW!!!! That was a lot of typing both in the journal and to Meghan!"

Going from Godspell practice to working is really hard, especially now that we are just running through the show over and over again ... a.k.a lots of dancing right in a row.  Tonight was crazyness ... all of the sorting shelves are packed and there were 3 checker-in-ers against 2 shelvers ... let's just say they won.  I tripped three times tonight too ... it was a looong night.

The yesterday I was shelving DVDs and I picked one up called ""Time Life's: Lost Civilizations"" and I was like this one looks cool so I took it home and I started watching it today.  When the theme music came on it was like one of those creepy deja vu moments and then the title came up and I freaked out.  This was the series that started it all.  The series that I watched in freshman year World History and I was like I want to do that I want to be an Archaeology a.k.a something with History.  I am stoked!!!! 

OH all the sports guys should be proud of me.  I checked out ""Sports Night"" and I actually think I am going to enjoy watching it *Surprised look*  So take that sports boys!!!

I was shelving hot av and I dropped a movie then I rounded the stack and I pretty much threw the book on cd.  It was highly amusing.  Oh me & Irene almost collided and me & Babette almost collided ... LOL.  OMG OMG I almost forgot about the creepiest part.  Was going by the internet computers upstairs and I saw him ... well at least I thought it was Mike.  It freaked the shit out of me.  He had on a shirt almost exactly like the one in Mike's facebook pic(except it didn't say Valpo) He was wearing a dark blue hat(like the Brewer's one) and He was the same build and hair color as Mike ... I was freaking out ... it was insane.

Oh and I was shelving 300's and I found some how to survive college ones ... maybe they'll help me survive being led on and played by a guy I really like ... who knows.

"event","SO this weekend started out really really bad with me being super upset thursday night.  I'm still very hurt by it ... there were just sooo many times where things could have been stopped but weren't.  Meghan (who was coming over before the situation happened) came out and we played frisbee golf.  It was my first time and I did pretty well ... I think Meghan hit it into the foliage more then I did :)  We had some time before she needed to leave so we went to Old Navy to see what deals Meghan could find for me(she is super good at finding them) didn't really find any super good deals BUT I got a pair of pants that are a size smaller!!! I haven't been this size since jr. high I think!!!!! That made the day super awesome!!!!!!!!!!!

Then later that night Rachel and I went out.  Sarah Anderson joined us and OMG we were PSYCHO!!! We went to Baker's Square and for some reason we started laughing and could not stop.  It was so bad ... we all started crying, Sarah spit out the water she had taken a drink of, and I couldn't breathe .... we still don't know why we started laughing.  Rachel has the Mai ai song on cd so when we got back in the car we started BLARING it ... I thought we were going to blow her cars speakers.   Then we went to downtown Naperville ... it took us 15 minutes to find a bathroom so Rachel could pee ... darn us being under 21.  We took a walk on the riverwalk and evaded the cops and walked most of the way down and back.  Some creepy guys tried to hit on us ... needless to say it did not work.  OH Rachel and I were supposed to do our scavanger hunt a.k.a  picture of me kissing Kadzik ... we were not able to get ahold of the boys all night :(

Today was a little better too ... had to wake up at 6 (meh) but lost .4 .... it is something.  I came back and slept for a few hours so that was cool.  Then I mowed the lawn .... OMG it was sooooo hot today by the time I was done I was dripping sweat, not even exagerating.  I thought I was going to passout by the time I was done.  We need to get a smaller lawn, ours is friggin huge.  I went to Pigtails grad party (one of my flag girls) it is crazy to see them and they are already in college ... where did the last two years go??  Then Spata came out.  We got Jimmy John's for dinner ... MMMMM man have I missed JJ's ... it isn't as good as when I have it with my twin :)  We saw ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith""  It was really good.  There was more comedy in it then you would expect.  I highly recommend it ... I am planning on seeing it again in the cheap theater if anyone would like to join me.  And that brings us up to now ... :)  I am off to bed cause I have to get up for church to show of my smaller pants!!!"

I know my friends are super right when they say that he treats me like crap and is an insenstive oaf.  I don't get it why I can't move on from this boy.  It is obvious that he doesn't anything to do with me ... ARGH I make myself soooo angry.  Freak an A make the feelings go away .... it's not like I'm not trying to stop I just cannot fathom why it is sooooo hard.

ARRRRRGGGHHHHH LIFE IS INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","We'll I was told by my therapists (a.k.a Becky & Meghan) that writing in my journal would be good for me as of late and I am finally getting around to doing it.  Yesterday I Was actually quite productive I made most of the food for the meeting last night.  OMG Metalhead Mike cracks me up I have missed him.  Kevin and I are crazy psycho together (yes the 14 year old ... well he's 16 now) We were cracking jokes and making fun of Mike like no other, It was great I can't wait until Nashville!! We went over to the Hickory Ridge Marriot and I dared Kevin to take one of the apples that were in a bowl on the front desk ... he wimped out.  So I get back home and Mike comes online for about 20 minutes without talking to me even though I e-mailed him twice without any reply and I im him and ask why he didn't respond to my e-mails and he said he didn't feel like it and he said he only skimmed through them and after I had said a few things he just signed off without responding to what I said or saying good-bye. I was going to give him till Saturday to talk to me or reply but I give up ... It just hurts too much to be pushed aside all the time.  I'm not fine at the moment and it will take me a while to be but I will be ok.  *SIGH* I just wish things could be different.

Today I was quite productive as well.  I cleaned out the hall closet with all of games and I got rid of some and soem are going to the Flag garage sale.  The closet is now all organized and clean (see the pictures on my website) I am the cleaning and organizing diva ... why can't I do that with my room though .... maybe I will have to try really hard to keep my room organized and clean.  I put more cds on the computer to be burned ... I am going to need a new case for one of the shows by the end of the summer :) Rachel, Karpierz, maybe Kadzik and I were supposed to go see Star Wars Episode 3 tonight but it was completely sold out for the day.  Hopefully we'll be able to go this weekend.  Rachel and I are completely psyched ... yea we are major dorks I know!! Oh and I totally realized today that Alice in Wonderland is a crazy movie!!!!"

"event","so weird. my last night in this city until august. eight months? so weird. it hasn't hit me yet at all. i'm packing up my room, wondering what the subleaser girl would want and what she wouldn't, and it still hasn't hit me. i bet it won't even on the plane, even when i have my normal ""going home"" real-life-journal and have to admit that i had an absolutely amazing semester and it will be weird going out in australia without my comfort zone. i know i'll be ok, i know, but it's weird to go and not know one single person. and the cost of everything is looking to be a lot more, so i hope it's worth it when im paying it off when im 82. :)

anyway, back in the oside tomorrow afternoon. i can't wait to see everyone. i made a close, real-life tulane, long island friend (weird that there are so many long island people here but i havent really met one that id want to hang out with  until recently) so i may have some tulane in my life still. and all my girls come to visit for new years :) so should be hot.

i'm so tired. i don't want to pack :("

Amazing.
Amazing.

Probably the best break in the history of Thanksgiving breaks.

There was just the right amount of sketchy randomness (cut to eating pot brownies with Ross Smirnoff and Stephen Morse)

Enough reunions

(Cut to a random fire house)

I got to see my amazing posse and crew. Everyone was so happy and fantastic. I got the perfect dose of GELMAN, telford, matty m, rachels, laura, gersh, etc. 

I roamed around the city with rachel and laura while eating a giant green apple.
I ate mexican food (twice).

I cannot wait till this winter break. You guys are absolutely amazing. 

Kevin, come home for Christmas-ish, please. thank you."

"event","So it's 4:30 AM and I've been studying for War on Terror (a poli-sci class) for a while. It's making me angrier at the Bush administration and angrier at Louisiana (where I'm currently registered to vote) for being so thoroughly red right now. 

Lately I've reduced everything to PR. For example:

All sexual courting (in its early stages) is charisma and delusion. (PR)

I honestly think that spin is everything and it's making me kind of sick how much  influence the media (clearly which is all spun and biased) has. (This is not an anti-media speech because I'm quasi-interested in magazine journalism, but more of a sadness about how diction influences political masses...but not about fictional diction, because that would remove a lot of meaning from my life :)) And if there weren't such a dominant media, social word of mouth would be dominated by those who could best articulate their point, not which is true and untrue. (maybe?) (Is there even true or untrue, clearly not. It's how you were raised and the influences on your life and what makes you happy to represent. But that's simplifying things too much, isn't it)

Which leads me to The Unbearable Lightness of Being. We go through this life once. There is no way to check your mistakes and correct your behavior. Even if something seems to 'not be working' for you, who's to say what the long run will produce? Which creates a lightness (or a heavy burden) to being, doesn't it? This life is either so light because of its meaningless or so heavy because of our burden to live without the possibility of correction.

This is not pessimistic, though!! A lot of trying things have happened to me, but I love where I am. Would I do anything differently? The only 'regrets' I have seem to stem from lost friendships. But some friendships run their course, they just do. And if one is longing so badly for one (which I'm not), then I really think that it's possible to gain some of that back. 

I'm a happy girl I'm just underrested. All of these opinions on the ""War on Terror"" are bleeding together. 

There are a million untraceable reasons why people do the things they do.

Whether or not they're worth trying to trace is debatable and I can't answer it. I'm too tired/caffeined/blah blah to answer it anyway.

I do, however, miss my mom like insanity and the past few weeks have been rough on that front.

I'm not sure whether I'm going home for Thanksgiving. I miss Sugarman and chai lattes when its cold (though i'm NOT wishing for it to be cold here..I'll have enough cold in new york). And all of the obvious people who don't need to be mentioned because they know. 

I'm just overwhelmed by work. Life has been crazy here. I'm going out too much, basically. See, it's a weird feeling living somewhere where it's so rarely cold. You don't often feel the need to snuggle up in your room and not go out in the cold, because there is no cold. And when you feel that desire it's strange and foreign to you and commonly mistaken for laziness or boredom (daresay).

I have a poem in my head and it's smart and unwriteable. 

This entry is long and incoherent and making up for the month lapse in time.

"event","Life has been going pretty quickly lately. The drunkeness and randomness takes away from my journal time so much that it seems like I haven't been living ever since we got back from the hurricane. It's been a mad dash to finish my study abroad application and get everything covered. 

I'm realizing how much differently I act with different people; how I take on such different roles with each of my good friends and even with complete strangers. This chick Julia who is pretty straight laced thinks that I'm completely ridiculous in the way I meet people. For example: I saw a pretty goodlooking guy leaned against the gate of my old apartment and I said ""Hey you, kid, get off my house"" and then laughed and started talking to him. Julia thought this was completely ridiculous :) But I thought it was funny, and I think Max (the leaner) did, too. And now we're friendly due to my ridiculousness. And that's how I like my life to be. 

I miss Lori but she should know that I reference her often in conversation, especially in regards to Brigitte on The Surreal Life which is quickly becoming my favorite show. My friends and I are entertaining the idea of being different characters from The Surreal Life for Halloween. I would be Charro and Lindy would be a flashing Flaaaava Flav.

The internet has brought all of my roommates together since Lindy is currently the only one with a computer and wireless card. Karen- no comp, Borah- no comp, Me-no wireless (awaiting it from my dad in 5 days) and Lindy- the works. So we all hang out in Lindy's room. 

Life has been absolutely unproductive but limitless fun. I need to get my shite together and then I realize that my classes are absolutely ridiculous.

I found my glasses!! Which is a wonderful surprise. And since I saved myself 200 dollars by finding them, I realized I didn't need to get a ridiculous 5 dollar an hour job at the government documents part of the library. so i can sleep late on my saturdays without regard for any work except for the ridiculous freshman classes i'm taking since I put off math and science till junior year like a very smart (stupid) child.

i miss writing, though i've been doing more since i got into french cinema which tends to bore and inspire; because the movies are pretty shite but the visuals are pretty rich. Nick will probably comment about how much more brilliant they are than anything Sofia or Kevin Smith coughed up. Go ahead my friend.

It seems like I've been cyber stalked into people I wouldn't expect reading my livejournal :) Which is hot, won't lie, but tends to censor me a bit. If you're reading this, you should call me."

There's a lot I'm leaving behind this time...the amazing people I've met at the consulate, my new amazing British friends who rock, the assumption that there will be dinner when I get home. So I get back to New Orleans with alcohol compensating for dinner and a general lack of intellectualism. I feel like I've done a lot of changing this summer, not to be corny. A lot of the Australian parties gave me loads of oppurtunity to just Listen to life experiences of adults. It reinforced that I want to travel and want to constantly read anything I can. BoozeClues said that everything will return back to normal. I can't wait to have my boobear and leevester back in my life. and karen :) and lindy and my latina friend, alex. 

this has been a summer of wonder. it started out with any plans. i had no job and i was afraid none of my friends would be home. but it turned out wonderfully, it really did.

"event","so I ran into my only lifetimesexgoal today. Don't bother asking who he is. If you don't already know, it's quite unlikely that I'll tell you now.

Is he as beautiful as I remember? Yes. Chunkier, a little bit. But still perfect. There was a homeless man on the subway who quieted everyone down and then said he was hungry and walked through our car asking for money. Lifetimesexgoal gave him a dollar and then hugged my shoulders when people were moving against me. 

Is he gay? Maybe. Honestly, in my head, he'll always be straight. Back in the day, I never thought of him in a sexual way. I just knew he was smart and funny and charming. This is NOT a stalking obsession. I rarely think of this boy. But I won't delude myself into thinking that my type of guy is not Directly caused by him. Charismatic Slut much? He broke the mold in that genre. (Haha, I won't blame him for my taste in men and the problems it causes...he's a beautiful example of how to be a charismatic slut and still not be an ass..tons of boys can learn from this example).

So i'll go back to my 12 year old self and think in a pure way of the big-brother type. And he can have no interest in girls at all. That's ok. He's still my paradigm of boyhood."

I'm studying abroad in Australia (in Brisbane) second semester and the program doesn't start until mid-February so I figured I would leave in January and buy an around the world pass from STA travel which is only a little bit more expensive than flying straight to Brisbane. Anddd...with this around the world pass, I'd fly to, (this is what I'm researching and working on)

Paris (and stay for 10 days), Bangkok (and moving around a bit in Thailand...for 10 days), and Sydney...before travelling to Brisbane. 

In Paris I'd stay with my friend Alex who is studying abroad there and in Bangkok I'd be on my own, chilling :) And in Sydney hopefully I'd meet up with Shelby before we travelled to Brisbane together. 

If this doesn't work out I'll be greatly disappointed. But I'm working on it, so hopefully I'll be ok.

climbed mount masada at 5am to watch the sunrise, floated in the dead sea, road a camel, stayed in a bedoin tent and watched one million stars above me, visited tel aviv, jerusalem, eilat, haifa, etc etc, ate tons of hummus, schawarma, falafel, kissed an israeli soldier who cried to me about the situation, got way too drunk every night, stayed in a kibbutz, went water rafting (weak compared to NY), overlooked jordan and syria, heard ariel sharon speak, went to the western wall (and ran into a bunch of tulane kids there), met some amazing people and made some amazing friends. drank tons of fresh squeezed orange juice, was duped into buying a $5 burnt MTV5 CD (HOW?!?), bought an awesome hookah for my new house for 20 dollars though i swear i won't turn into eric, went on 2 water hikes, visited mount hertzel (and cried my damn eyes out), watched the funniest jewish kids running around in the old jewish quarter of jerusalem (and was a bit too afraid to take their picture), visited where the jewish state was created and rabin was shot, ate salad for breakfast every day, noticed that israelis are rude, it's not just a stereotype, lost tons of shekels, figured out that Goldstar beer fucking rocks (and ended up stealing a glass....who knew? i thought it was Bulldog), slept through a live performance of Israels most popular musical act (clearly), found a girl with a peter pan fetish (!)

mmm...that's pretty much all for now.

oh. and i figured out that newton boys suck. and what Asses have to do with the Dead Sea (you know whaimean if you've been)

I think too much and analyze myself and my life too much. I want to stop. i want people to stop telling me that her death will cause my life to be rough forever. iw ant people to tell me it gets easier, and no one has. Isn't it natural to compare yourself to other people when you're really sad? 

I want to cut myself off from boys who suck but they won't let me. or my memory won't. I'll put them on ignore and ignore their phone calls and then several months later I have forgotten why I put them on ignore to begin with, so I'll take them off. I'll answer their calls. All because I'm afraid to walk away. BUT OTHER PEOPLE DONT CONTINUE RIDICULOUS RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE YEARS LONG.

"event","so this morning i woke up and couldn't find my cell phone anywhere. my friend hannah had slept over and she couldnt find hers, either. so we used this kid patrick's phone to look for ours, and we couldn't hear them.

finally, a man answered hannah's phone. he explained that he's a drug dealer and he had bought her phone for 60 dollars this morning. after explaining my phone, he said he had seen the guy selling mine, too. 

so anyway, hannah made all these plans to buy the phone off the drug dealer, so we made plans to meet him at a streetcar stop and make the exchange.

so we ran into hannah's (250 lbs) boss from work and his two black ex-prison'd friends (for drug dealing) and they drove us to pick up this phone. but the guy was being all sketchy. he wanted us to be alone, without any guys, and to leave the money in an envelope and all this shite, very movie-esque. after 20 minutes of calling back and forth the guys in the car told us that it was too sketchy and he bet that the guy was probably just trying to get more shite off me and hannah.

the guy called back one more time and hannah said ""good luck with your business"" and cancelled her service.

so to summarize: i do not have a cell phone, instead, a drug dealer from new orleans has it. and already i have voice messages (when i checked them) of guys asking for ""stuff"".

ONLY IN NEW ORLEANS. I SWEAR IT.

(It goes without saying that this motherfucker broke in while hannah and i were asleep in the general area, possibly even the room)"

        You are the bread and the knife,
        The crystal goblet and the wine...
        -Jacques Crickillon

You are the bread and the knife,
the crystal goblet and the wine.
You are the dew on the morning grass
and the burning wheel of the sun.
You are the white apron of the baker,
and the marsh birds suddenly in flight.

However, you are not the wind in the orchard,
the plums on the counter,
or the house of cards.
And you are certainly not the pine-scented air.
There is just no way that you are the pine-scented air.

It is possible that you are the fish under the bridge,
maybe even the pigeon on the general's head,
but you are not even close
to being the field of cornflowers at dusk.

And a quick look in the mirror will show
that you are neither the boots in the corner
nor the boat asleep in its boathouse.

It might interest you to know,
speaking of the plentiful imagery of the world,
that I am the sound of rain on the roof.

I also happen to be the shooting star,
the evening paper blowing down an alley
and the basket of chestnuts on the kitchen table.

I am also the moon in the trees
and the blind woman's tea cup.
But don't worry, I'm not the bread and the knife.
You are still the bread and the knife.
You will always be the bread and the knife,
not to mention the crystal goblet and--somehow--the wine."

"event","rather than writing my own entry, i figured i would cut and paste levi's stoned entry into this because i was sitting next to him at the time and he mentions my insanity quite a bit (this was on 4-20): 

""i was thinking that when youre high, you can see through to a higher level of intelligence (!) and that the gods dont want you to see it, so they mask the perception by fogging minds. and thats when when people smoke a lot, even though they get more creative, theyre not like dominating the field of innovation. cuz of the gods, man.

ahaha i was just working on the computer and i looked up realized i had absolutel y no idea what what was going on and what everyone was tlking about and thinking. haha.

now theyre talking about radke and how everyone will fit in wonderfully at the new house sarcastically and shit. damn. now theyre staring at everyone because im writing about what everyone is thinking. im a spy ahahahaha. 

the crepe place opens in another hour, we were saying a minute ago, and if they opened a little earlier, like a cuple hours for lunch/dinner , lauren now decided it should be 4 hours earlier, and we should let them know so they can change their hours.

remember last year when lauren at ethe pizza and spit a bite out and ate it again cuz she was so high, shes like that high again right now she says.

im rocking the kanye now, all falls down and its a nice tight song. good flow. i like that kanye lad. all falls down.

im writing poetry lauren said, but i said no but gosh im sure not writing about what all is going on here! and i talkeda bout the crepe place and its 4 hours eariler thing, and so they believed me that im not talking about them. which im really not actually. but if i decided to! then i could do it in secret hehe. im a spy.

whoa i remember a while ago when i was thinking about how the gods would fog the high world so you couldnt figure out shit out really and you wouldnt remember shit. and how my mind was so fogged right then cuz i was so high. and i was just looking around trying to desparately to get my mind through a simple concenpt. damn nigga.

i think like when people are on the porch, its when they want to talk to people. but when theyre inside , they dont really want people to come in and start chilling with them. it seems to work like that, on porches. "" 

i hope he doesnt mind that i stole it :) if he does ill take it down

last night i went to a formal and we went to dinner at DELMONICO! (insane. one of emeril's restaurants). filling up our water glasses every two seconds and 'mam' and new silverware after every course kind of restaurant. absolutely insane. i had steak. i had to, right? AMAZING. you barely needed a knife to cut it. i can't explain how happy it made me. though they have surprisingly small portions :) and wine and grey goose and cranberry and sorbet for desert. INSANE. i can't get over it. andthe formal was really fun and it had the prettiest courtyard. and dave was an excellent date and i'm so glad that he invited me

"event","So I just got back from my week long ""Mardi Gras Break"" and rather than type a whole entry to you, I'll just paste an e-mail that I sent to a friend who lives in Brooklyn but is originally from San Diego and LA. I went to Los Angeles for 4 days, then Mexico for 2 days, then LA for another day. It was an awesome time. I met about 6 fantastic guys with sexy accents, and I accomplished one of my lifetime goals (IM me to ask me about it...a little too dodgy for here)

OHHHH, and the weirdest thing was when I met one of my friend's sister's roommates and he asked me where I was from and I said ""Oceanside"" he said ""NO WAY! do you know jackie tohn? (spelling?!)"" then told me he was family friends with her and introduced me to her at a bar the following day. so i met an oceanside graduate on the west coast...weird.


hey hey

i just got back from la and i had a kickass time. i kept hearing that they were hard on ID's but I got into every bar I tried and so did all of my friends (i guess it helps being girls). we stayed with my friend lori's sister who has really cool, laid back, east-coastish type friends which was a nice little introduction to west coast-ness. 

we stayed in LA for 3 days, went to some bars like Cabo (margaritas and beach themed) and Barney's (very attractive guys), then drove to San Diego on the way to Rosarito where we just stopped for lunch, then went to Rosarito. In rosarito we stayed in a two bedroom two bathroom condo with huuuuuuge ass beds and a wrap around balcony that was on the ocean. it was cheap as hell for what it was and there were probably 10 tourists in the whole city because it's pretty off season right now. however, in typical lauren fashion, I happened to hang out with two groups of British guys who entertained us and made us laugh properly as we downed margaritas and tacate. Lori wanted to teach them flip cup and it was hilarious hearing ""GOOOO!!! GOOO!!!"" while racing in flip cup from 20-something year old british guys. 

so the run down of shite i accomplished in la: we went horseback riding in the Hollywood hills, saw jimmy kimmel live, did the whole walk of the stars and the chinese theatre touristy thing, ate good sushi and indian food, went to Roscoe's (it rocked, I had fried chicken and waffles and i didn't have to eat again all day), hung out in santa monica, bought cool sunglasses, and saw two c-list celebrities. pretty eventful, eh? :)

the radio in LA is much better, in my opinion. and people are more attractive.

mmm...
well, that's about it. :) my friends did the whole map of the stars houses thing but i slept in the back seat of the car because I wasn't so interested...

oh, and i came home to my roommate telling me she came home one night to a homeless man sleeping in her bed and a bunch of our stuff stolen, including every single one of my cd's. 

I WENT WITHOUT THE INTERNET FOR 7 DAYS!! WHO IS PROUD?!??!"

"event","ill update with all the requirements later. I received these questions from whosapalandrome and i dont know how to post a link to he rjournal, so ill figure that our and edit it


1. have you never had a pet? if so, why not?
ive had several pets. the most important were two cats I had when i was little, one that was left on our doorstep that they had ""heard it was a good home"" which is amusing. but its name was louie and it was a fantastic cat

2. how do you force yourself to live so passionately knowing that the probability of getting hurt is always very high?
who cares if the possibility of getting hurt is so high? whats the worst than can happen? i have so many fun adventures and so many amazing friends that ive met in so many different ways that I wouldn't give up my lifestyle for anything. Believe it or not, I don't ALWAYS take chances, though it seems like I do, but I think i'd be more miserable with ""what ifs"" than reality. And my reality is pretty beautiful.


3.. if/when i come visit you in new orleans am i absolutely going to be blown away? i don't have fun very often.
I feel like yes. it's absolutely a fantastic world and no one has ever come down here and disliked it. I think it's something that people can adapt to quickly because the food and the people are so good and the scene is so hot and fun. I definitely think you'd be blown away. Whether or not you could make it a permanent life style is a different subject :)

4. if you could be anywhere in the world, besides new orleans, right now, where would it be?
somewhere amazingly different in culture. like indonesia. or india. or south africa. I want to go somewhere and have my life be absolutely thrown about, because i've gotten so used to this lifestyle.

5. what is the one thing you would most like the change about yourself? i'd be less jealous. or less eager. i'd calm down a bit in my anxiousness to have things play out. a lot of people have to be trained in the philosophy of ""today is the day"" i have to be taught that there's a tomorrow, too. and guys can't become boyfriends in a minute or best friends in a day"

"event","i think i just haven't updated in a while because i've been so busy and so happy that i have nothing to vent about. my friends are amazing. rush sucked while it happened but im happy with the girls ive met. ive been going out nonstop, spending very little money. an unfortunate little incident happened regarding my purse, but I won't discuss it here as i discovered that my little sister reads this. i hear hooking up 4 times in a limited timespan consitutes a pattern, so i guess im in a pattern. he's fantastic and adorable. we'll see how i manage to fuck it up :) i miss a few people from oceanside.

i hope you're all doing well.

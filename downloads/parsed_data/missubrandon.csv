You are an aunt to my kids when I have them. You are hopefully going to be my room mate after high school. You are going to be my maid of honor at my wedding. That's how much you mean to me.

Thanks for always sticking beside me and I do know you are a true friend. Chris, you have always found a way to make me feel okay. You always found a way to cheer me up. When I was low, I knew I could go to you. Even when i was a bitch, you never left my side. Through it the drama and lies I got told, you were there. Through all the fights, I still had your friendship. I always found it hard to believe how much of a good friend you were because you always found a way to outstand me more. You prove how much more of a good friend you were. On homecoming night, at the game, when I started to cry (ONLY you know why), you just grabbed me and held me and told me everything was going to be okay. And it was. Thanks to you. You were there for me on Brandon's birthday which was a hard day for me. You knew how much I loved Brandon and how much he meant ot me, so you were there for me.&nbsp;You stood beside me.

Even when KB tried to end our friendship, we didn't except for once (and we discussed it). I'm so happy we made it this far and our frienship is only growing stronger. I hope you know I never wanted to try to seem like I was trying ot end your relationship woth Kyle. I just didn't want you to get hurt. I didn't want your heart to get broken. I LOVE YOU!Through everything you were there for me. You never left my me and you never betrayed me. Kyle might have put us both in tight spots in our friendship but we looked past it. I know you love Kyle and I don't want to stand between that. I don't want you to think I <em>HATE</em> him. I just <em>DISLIKE</em> him. I just want you to be happy and not hurting. I just don't want you to regret anything. You know you are one of my best friends. </font></p><p><font style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #330033"" color=""#993399"" size=""1"">Brittany Spencer-Brit, we have been friends since seventh grde and we have been in almost six fights. but we still are friends.

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART! You and I have been through so much, but yet you were always there for me. You were always true to me. You were kind and caring towards me. You were there for me when I was crying. You even said you would beat up anyone who made me cry. You even once said that I was to sweet to be upset.You don't understand how much that meant to me. I LOVE YOU! You told me things that I didn't believe, but I now do. You told me I was sweet, caring and a good friend. When you tears in my eyes, you always offered a shoulder. </font></p><p><font size=""1""><font style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #330033"" color=""#993399"">Lucas Harrison-you have been such a great friend to me in the last year. I may have met you this year, but you have become one of my best friends. You have been there for me through so much drama. You were always so caring, and very nice to me. The only reason our friendship started was because your brother Everett was one of my best friends (still is). You were there for me through all the tears and bitchy moments. You are really one of my best friends.</font><br /></font><br /></p></font>"

"event","<font color=""#ff00ff"" size=""3""><font color=""#ff00ff"" size=""1"">Well&nbsp;I turned 16 on Saturday May 12.&nbsp;I have gotten rid of everything doing with Kayce. Now&nbsp;I like this guy named Zach. He is so caring, sweet and so daring. Zach the&nbsp;Ninja. He is so HOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTT. ( this is Gina... one of Alyssa's bff's.. and yes, HE IS) (told you he is hot.) If you have a myspace....add me because&nbsp;I have a picture of him under my&nbsp;pictures. You have to check him out. Yeah he is hot. Ok well here is some more information and everything on Zach. Well he is so sweet, and caring. He is such a good friend and person. I trully do care for him and trust him. He walks with me to my classes...I never had anyone do that. He is really and trully the greatest guy ever. I do know that I'm able to trust him and I do know if something bad happens to me, he will be there for me. I know this is true. Zach is way beyond everything&nbsp;I want in a guy. Then that new guy (Jesus) talked to my friend Jessica&nbsp;M and now he is acting weird around me. She asked if he liked me and ever since then everything seems to be weird.&nbsp;I hate that. But so what...at least we are still friends. At least the Kayce thing didn't happen all over again...because that will be such suicide.&nbsp;I would hate that.&nbsp;I don't think that will be good for me right now.&nbsp;I need someone who will be there for me and someone who will care for me. Someone who will be here through thick and thin. Someone who&nbsp;I know will be there no matter what and someone&nbsp;I know will love me through all the bullshit and drama.....through everything.&nbsp;I just don't know if I'm going to find that right now, but&nbsp;I do know Zach comes damn close to that. He is my 5th best friend so&nbsp;I know he is a great guy because&nbsp;I don't trust guys easliy and&nbsp;I trust him.....so yeah.&nbsp;I trust him with my whole life. Hold&nbsp; on...maybe&nbsp;I should tell you my best friends in order.....1) Sarah Beavis, 2) Emily Bridgers a.k.a Emmie, 3) Lucas Harrison, 4) Chris Rochelle, 5) Zach Hahn a.k.a Zach the Ninja, 6) Brittany Spencer a.k.a Brit, 7) Everett Harrison, 8) Gina Abraham, 9) Christii Morey, 10) Dylan Stone a.k.a Frog, 11) Nathan Garrison.....those are my top best friends and&nbsp;I&nbsp;do love them to death. Without them&nbsp;I don't think&nbsp;I would be able to do anything.....they helped me through some bullshit and&nbsp;I do love them so much....they are all so close to my heart. But see the thing is I have known Chris&nbsp;my entire life and&nbsp;I think of him as family. He is like my younger brother (he is the one who just turned 15). Back to Zach, I know I can trust him and everything. That is hard for me......to trust a guy because I have a bad history with guys and I do trust Zach so that means alot. Also my friends do approve....so that does make it easier on me.....lol. It's just so confusing though...I don't want to lose his friendship....it means so much to me....without it I don't think I can deal with that.</font> </font>"

"event","<font color=""#ff00ff"">Wow in less than 18 days i am turning 16. i have invited almost everyone i know. yes both of those guys are invited. which sucks. since the new one hates the old one. so yeah...DRAMA!!! i wrote the new one a letter which i am going to type right now...<br /><br />well since we are friends, i think u need to know some things. when i was barely two my real dad walked out on me. i never heard from him until i went to foster care in 7th grade. i went to foster care because my step-dad abused me-physically. i would be scared when someone would even touch me-poke me, anything. i woulld explode into tears. i think that's why i'm so affectionate. but back to the point, i had to stay there for three months-thanksgiving, christmas, new years' eve and new year's day to. i was only 12 ( going on 13) years old. then in 8th grade i met this girl who kinda ruined my life. she started to start drama and ruin friendships. she started to say lies to my face-saying we were friends but saying to others ""god i ahte her."" i heard that she would call me 'ugly', 'bitchy', 'fat', and so much more. it hurt me. it would kill me inside. i thought she was my best friend. then in 9th grade, i hung out with this girl (a diiferent one) who got me into some trouble. she would push me into skipping and fighting. then in may 2006 on the 31st-almost two weeks after i turned 15-this guy i grew up with, stephen plocki, died. he was like my brother. i known him my entire life and it didn't go down well. he died at the age of&nbsp;20. if he was still here he would be 21-his birthday was april 4th. then august 16 in the same year, my best friend, brandon&nbsp;herriott, died. he was only 17. if he lived for two more months&nbsp;he would have turned 18. but two weeks before he died, i met this guy named kayce maultsby on myspace. he was the person i went to when brandon died. brandon&nbsp;was the first gut i trusted and i cared about. he was the first guy who cared about me, really cared. kayce was there when i nedded someone. also during the time, i was with this guy who wasn't the best boyfriend ever. he kinda hurt me and put me throuugh so much of our one month of dating. then around october 19th-brandon's brithday-i started to get depressed. BADLY!! then i started to fall for kayce hard. so i started to write him this note telling him how i felt. but my feelings got so much stronger i had to re-write the letter. i thought he was a good influence on me, but he got me into drinking and partying. i started to act slutty. i did somethings with him i now regret. he has been down my pants and has touched my boobs skin-on-skin. i have been down his pants. we have kissed. let's just say the list goes on. we were sexual. then in&nbsp;january of this year, i re-wrote the letter. i told him i loved him and i wanted to be with him. he broke my heart. for three weeks-whole three weeks-i was suicidal and depressed. i tried to committ suicide twice or at least four times. all because of him. but i tried to convince myself he was worth it. then he waits a while to tell me he has a fucking&nbsp;girlfriend. i thought i wasn't worth&nbsp;no one's time. i know i am-i got friends who love and support me through everything. but he kept on playing with my heart he would ask for my forgiveness, so i would always forgive. but he would just hurt me AGAIN!! it just kept going on and on for four whole months. then his girlfriend sent me a message on myspace under his profile a month ago threatening me, saying that i should stay away from him because she thought of me as competition! i was like so upset. i went to school and almost cried everytime i saw him. everytime u would see me cry was because of him. he made me feel sop totally worthless. he broke my heart four times in the last four months. i don't want to get hurt again. i don't trust guys at all. because everytime i trust a guy i get my heart broken. that's why i'm so affectionate towards my guy friends. i like to show how much i care about them and that i trust them. and since i trust them, that's unique. so i show it. i do hold hands with them, kiss them and hug them. that's why i'm afraid to open up and i don't want to be in a relationship, only to still be in love with kayce. why do you think i haven't had a boyfriend since i known you? kayce closed my heart up to love, my heart up completely, and to dating. </font>"

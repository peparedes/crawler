"event","Yesterday was the best day ever because I was out all night learning how to string glowsticks from Shelby and Kenny. It was great, smacked myself in the head a few times. That was hilarious, have a couple of bruises though other than that I did it. Then later on, when the sun was up, we called Kat and she came around noon. We sat outside more and watched Hardball. It was fun, then we watched Space Jam. I slept during it. It was cool I layed on kat and then I woke up about an hour later and the movie was still on. After we watched Space Jam we decided to go to Kat's house. Me and Kenny rode the bikes we had but Kenny had to drop the bike he was riding off. We stopped by Kenny's house and Kenny's mom told him he couldn't go back out so I headed to Kat's house. Kat and Shelby showed a few minutes later carrying a bag of stuff from 7-Eleven and we went inside. We hung out in Kat's room and I played some SC2 and was on Kat's computer. Kat's parents ordered chinese and I had that for dinner. After me and Shelby had finished eating Kat got her grandmother to give Shelby a ride home and I ended up half asleep, laying on Kat's leg in the truck. When we got back I went into Kat's room and curled up on the floor while she went to finish eating. She came up and woke me up after she finished. Then we walked to Blockbuster and I had the glowsticks with me. Kat made me look slow because she learned the same thing I learned in an hour from Shelby and Kenny in 5 minutes from watching me do it like twice. We rented Boogeyman and Princess Mononoke. We went back to her house and played some Tales of Symphonia before going outside and sitting on the swing. I left her house at about 9:50 and got home at like 10:00...... When I got home I got yelled at. Called Kat at about a 11 and talked to her for alittle bit. Went to sleep and woke back up about 15 hrs later...... And yeah...."

Life is just for<br>fun and you need to be free to live according<br>to you.

Its not that you<br>don't care, because you do, but in these<br>situations it's a waste of time. You live up in<br>the clouds and are quite a dreamer about life.<br>People often consider you beautiful, but harsh<br>and they would think twice before getting to<br>know you.

You are not often seen sad,<br>but you have your times. If someone has been<br>mean to you, you can quite easily trash-talk<br>them for betraying you.

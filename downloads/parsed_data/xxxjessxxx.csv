Blah all im doing is talking about him but im so happy, I told him tonight ive never been this happy, ive never felt this way before and I know for a fact ive been in love, theres no denying that but this is different, this is a deeper love I guess you can say.

blahblahblah, such a baddddddd week. So stressfull. I wont even find out for probably another week and a half so im gonna be all out of it and stressed and scared and emotional. I start school on monday and I should be so happy and excited but im so not even wanting to do nething but be held. I took the written test for fdny on saturday and I didnt even want to go to that. thats how you know its really bad I DIDNT WANT TO GO TAKE THE TEST FOR FDNY. Im only 17, I didnt think this shit was possible, not even a scare because im praying thats all that it is. I didnt fucking know taht birthcontrol increases your risks of breast cancer. Suposidaly I already have a high rate b/c of my family history, and then this? Fucking stupid ass  community center. I swear to god, this sounds fuckedup but GOD FORBID I do have cancer Im gonna fucking go over there, kill them, then sue them. They NEVER told me anything about breast cancer and birthcontrol. Nothing at all not even a hint, they didnt mention cancer at all, I did. I told them about everyone in my family whos had cancer even if it wasnt ovarian cervical or breast cancer just b/c. I really cant believe this is happening to me. NOW. Im just really lucky that I have my momma to help me threw this and a great boyfriend. My mom is actually worse then me right now. Im trying really hard to just like, not think about it, of course its hard its hard to think posotive but im really trying. blahblah. okay im done. but go to this website and get your edumcation on breast cancer and birth control.

The dangerous performance enhancing

steroids taken by athletes are

male steroid hormonal drugs

that build muscle.

One of their risks is liver cancer.

Similarly, female steroid hormonal drugs

build breast tissue.

They not only increase the risk

of liver cancer but breast and cervical

cancers as well.These powerful

steroid drugs are taken by millions

of teenage girls as BIRTH CONTROL PILLS."

"event","Okay so this sounds kinda gay but ive been like refelcting back on my life. I have changed so much for the good. I can honestly say im content with where I am right now. Im in school getting my GED doing something good for MYSELF, I applied for FDNY which is my dream job, Im very social not that I wasnt but im actually nice now, like no attitudes with people. Well if you deserve an attitude and me to be a bitch you get it, but other then that im good. I changed my life around drastically for the good. Im not all depressed and self  conscious about myself I can honestly say that if I want to I can look pretty at times. Im not being concieded or anything but I dont have such a low selfesteem any more, I feel good about myself. Im proud of what im doing with myself, I do want to find a different job tho because, well if you know me you know why, CREEEPPPYYY is all I can say. Ive also learned im a very BIG people person. I like helping people alot and just like you know lending a hand when its needed which is good since I want to be in FDNY thats helping people, also EMT is which is what im doing first. The only thing im not happy about right now is I want to quit smoking, I am going to very soon and I will do it because I want to and I can do anyythinggg I want to =). Obvvss. I can think that since I said I was gonna get my GED and I finally got my shit together and I am and I said I was gonna join FDNY and I applied and im going to try my hardest and accomplish my goals I set for myself years ago. For the most part I have good friends that believe in me. I said for the MOST part. hah. Anyway, the whole boyfriend thing I guess just didnt work out unforntually and thats really hard to let go of.I am still very confused and hurt about that. I just have to deal with it the best way I can. I have some good people helping me get threw all of that shit and tell me i'll be fine and eventually i'll learn how to deal with shit. Eh, whatever. Basically my point about writing all of this is to remind myself when I look back that I have changed, I have cut in a year this month yay congrats to me, that was a stupid thing to do in the first place, I havent put my fist threw a window/wall/door/truck/tile in about a year also, a little over a year. I havent been depressed about how my life is in awhile, I mean of course with Jorge I was upset and cryed more then I have ever cried in my life but I wasnt depressed to the point I wanted to take a bottle of asprin and say fuck it I want to die. I still get upset about my mom but I cope with it better now, I learn that when she doesnt feel good and has moodswings and shit that it isnt my fault its because she doesnt feel good and is in pain and if theres nothing I can do just shutup and dont fight with her, yes her to death. I just hate, hate, HATE when her and my dad get me involved in there shit with money. I hate money it makes the world go round and everyone figths and even kills over it. Pathetic. I was saying today how the majority of kids grown up in a single parent home and mostly with the mother. Im still growing up and have been in a single parent home for about 6years now. It in reality is so much better because my dad isnt here to start problems. But them having such a horrible ""marragie"" fucked with me so badly, im not trying to blame them for my problems but it really had a very big impact on my life and the way I acted for thoes couple of years. Its still bad now with them but I try and ignore it, ive faced reality that mommy and daddy will never like eachother and ill ALWAYS be in the middle of it. Its just seeing them makes me NEVER want to get married or have kids because I would never want to put them threw this, its a horrible horrible thing to do and its no ones fault its just the way of life. But trust me I would try my hardest to never let this happen to my kids if by any chance I actually do have them in the future. Whatever. I cant tell the future or what will happen but im just saying yah know? Yeahh you do because most kids now have parents livving in to seperate houses fighting over kids and money and all that jazz or there parents are int he process of a divorce. Most of you know the deal and how much it fucking sucks and fucks you up in the head with what you think could happen to you and love and all that shit. But yeah this was just my randomly long rant about my life and how im happy with where I am right now, living life day to day and planning for the future at the same time. Toodles."

I hate guys I really do. It sucks when you love someone so much it fucking hurts. And the only way you can be with them is if you go against your mother which im not about doing. I love him to death but I cant lie to my mom nor do I want to. He doesnt understand what hes putting ME threw. He brokeup with me and fucking crushed my world then just thinks he can come back and make everything okay but it isnt like that. He hurt me more then neone ever has and  probably ever will.  I just cant forgive and forget just like that.  Then he bitches that I dont see him for him to prove hes diffrent. I cant see him my mother doesnt want me too.  She wants me to focus on school which is right.  I dont need to worry about seeing him all the time when our schedules just dont work out.  I really cant deal with this shit. Im driving myself crazy and hes driving me crazy.  He doesnt relize it but hes mkaing my life a living fucking hell and making me so depressed and im at the point where im being a bitch to everyone else and I feel bad but I cant help it.  I try not to but I guess its jsut showing and coming out.  It sucks so fucking much.  There isnt nething I can do to make the stupid fucking pain stop.  Everytime I talk to him its just like another knife is being stabed into my heart and turning more and more with everyword he says to me.  He yells at me b/c I cant see him and it hurts even more when he says he doesnt know if I love him and all of that shit.  Thats just fucking ridiclious I love him more then I love neone in this fucking world and he doesnt believe me b/c I cant show him b/c I cant see him. Am I wrong for not going behind my mothers back? Or am I wrong for not seeing him just because she doesnt want me too? ughh I dont knwo what the fuck to do. I dont know anything ne more and im so hurt. I have no one to fucking talk to about it, everyones like fuck it move on but its so much harder then that b/c just a few months ago we were fine and so inlove no one could change that. Then one day he decided he wanted to change it for I dont even know why. argh. I just want the pain and crying to stop. Thats all I ask for. Make it stop, please."

Like ""I am your friend you cna always call me and im there for you"" I honestly dont believe it. I posted some shit on myspace about my so called ""friends"" and they all jumped and asked me to hangout meanwhile I didnt even mean for that to happen I was just getting my point across. Mean while none of them hungout with me like they said they would. I can honestly trust id say three people. One is jorge who is my boyfriend. Jesswater is another and i barley hang out with her but I still trust her and tell her everything. The other is my friend who is a bijillion miles away in florida and I havent seen him in almost 3years. I use to have friends. I just dont know what happened. I guess im not meant to have a bunch of people I trust and hang out with. I dont talk to most of the people I did because they all speak to my brother or hang out with him. I hate him so much its pathetic. I guess it's my fault. The worst thing I have ever done in my life is to intruduce him to MY friends. I feel betrayed for them to even speak to him knowing how I feel. I cant stop people I really cant get mad but I do, I think its fuckedup. They are supposed to be my friends and stick with me but they all speak to him and I cant trust them because they speak to him and everything that happens that he finds out about he runs to daddy. Hes such a child, I dont even do that fucking bullshit any more, we arent 8. I find it funny how most of the time I write in this shit its about my brother who I hate. He causes so much shit in my life by not even saying anything to me. Hes the most disrespectfull person I have ever met. Blah Blah Blah im getting to pissed about all of this shit. How can someone bring liquor into there parents house when they just gave up drinking after 39years? Even leave it in the fridge? Have people in and out at all hours of the night when his father is going to work at 4am and he still has people there from the night before. He grubs off of my dad and gets money from him and hes 21 years old and doesnt work. Its pathetic. Whats even more pathetic is that he can ruin my life with out saying a word to me. ughhh. Whatever.

I mean normally i have a low self esteeme yeah but its gotten worse. I dont wanna look like I use to, and for some reason i feel like ive gained like 5lbs in the past 3weeks, maybe more, Im pretty sure I did and idk why cuz i eat the same i always do which is alot but I guess I have to stop. I mean I was at the same weight for liek almost a year and now its going up? Idk I just feel really fat and ugly and it really isnt fun. There was this fat chick on tv and I asked jorge what he would do if in a month I looked like her and hes like id either leave u or get fat with you, most likey id get fat with u and we would be fat toghter and started making jokes about it like oh we would even out the car and stuff trying to get me to laugh but the sad part is a part of me was like he would leave me and a part of me said he wouldnt. I just dont want to get that fat again, not for neone else just for myself, I mean its just hard im going no where right now I cant find a job, no one wants to help me out with getting my ged and stuff, im a low life loser liek everyone said I would be. Congrats, I thought i would prove everyone wrong but I didnt. My mom isnt saying all that much stuff ne more but the other day she was like why are your jeans looking so tight and im like what? and she said I looked big in them so I took them off and put on sweatpants. Then she told me to do situps to get rid of my ""belly"". I fucking look like im prgenant cuz im fat. I hate it so much. When I watch tv it mkaes it even fuckin worse, all you see is girls who are skinny as fuck with huge tits and thats not me. Im fat with small tits. Hollywood doesnt help neither do all the fuckin commercials with chicks half naked bouncing around. I know what people are gonna say, ""go on a diet"" see yeah it sounds easy but its not, b/c I have a fuckedup schedule I wake up at like 2-3 and eat then eat at like 10 which makes it worse. I have no money for a gym, my mom isnt gonna buy ""healty"" food cuz shes gonna say I wont eat it and im not home enough for it. I eat at jorges house or fast food all the time. My life syle is what makes me fat. oh now people are gonna say ""so change how your livving"" Yeah that isnt so easy either, I already fuckedup. Like I said b4 no one wants to help with a ged program either in queens or nassau, ill mention it and they will say okay ill look in to it. WHEN?! I cant do it on my own THEY have to sign me up for it im not old enough. Oh so now you say wake up early and find a job, well I tried. I need somewhere close cuz my gpa cant pick me up late, my dad has no car. I would have no ride home so it has to be with in walking distance night and day. Thoes places wont hire me. It says ""help wanted"" but just not jess, jess isnt good enough. I also dont want to fall back into my whole ""I hate life I hate me I hate you fuck everything"" phase, that wasnt good and ive been out of that for almost  a year, ive only had like 2 breakdowns with in the past 11months which is great for me, I dont want to be that way again, I dont want to get fatter then I already am getting, I want to be skinny like all the people you see on tv anda ll the girls that guys are like ""damn shes hott"" mostly b/c shes skinny. I want people to look at me as a person not as the fat chick. ughhh no one really understands but whatever."

"event","So uhm I still hate being in my house, I never thought I would resort to having a full out 10min cry because I didnt want to go home. That did happen today unforntually. After reading stephs novel about her personality I relized I need to tell people when things are wrong and not blow up after building up all of my anger which is what ive been doing. Ive been blowing up on the wrong person tho, which sucks. I also blew up on the right person. Now that im calm I can actually write something and not be saying it all out of anger. No one really reads this so im just gonna say everything that I want to. My mother isnt who she was, no it isnt because of pills, I dont know if its a lack of pills? Wanting pills? Not being happy? Being depressed? I dont know but Im not speaking to her because she like to put me down and say hurtfull things everyday. It varies from ""your going no where in life and I never thought my daughter would turn out to be you"" to ""you have a shitty personality and your a horrible person"" Jorge said to me ""Jess your a millionaire"" and im like huh? And he asked me if I was gonna go and look for my money because he just said that to me so it must be true. He said that because I listen and think its true what my moms saying to me and I relize that now, I dont think im that much of a horrible person, of course I do have my moments but all in all im not a horrible person, I think I have a good personality because alot of people get along with me, but also alot of people dont like me. Im one of thoes you love me or you hate me type of people I guess. There isnt an inbetween. But my personality cant be all that shitty b/c I have a boyfriend who loves me and obvisouly likes my personality or he wouldnt be with me. I have friends that I question about at times but they still like me. So there goes that, I shouldnt listen to my mother when she says stuff like that, she shouldnt make me cry. When she said im going no where in life, yah know what it may look like that now but I havent had the best of life but also not the worst, I know people out there have had worse times then me but still im not satasifed(spelling?) with my life and how it is. My mother is sick and dying which I have also been hearing alot from her taht she doesnt have alot of time left. Shes made it this far shes gonna live life untill she dies just from being old. My dad is an alcholic but yes he is in recovery, its still very hard tho because hes all cranky from not drinking and im NOT gonna change my life or ""walk on egg shells"" because of that I payed 1000 for them to tell me dont change who I am or how I act towards him and im not doing that. He needs to still grow up even tho he is a grown man with six kids hes still a child himself it seems. My brother, im not even gonna go there. He has the maturity level of a 2year old and its depressing that I have now said that I personally have disowned him. I do not call him my brother to anyone other then when I just typed that. He is to much to handle and starts to many problems in my life. He for one talks WAY to much shit about me and Jorge, I think he does because hes jealous and upset im so happy and he is livving a shitty relationship like he has since Kathy. No matter what he says he isnt happy with ANY girl anymore. Hes just a miserable person in general. My grandpa is well, just old. I love him more then anything and he is always there when I need him but I mean I cant go to him with problems like my mom saying this stuff, my dad being cranky, me hating mike, stuff like that. Hes there just to be grandpa and try to shelter me from the horrible world we live in. My friends, well I talk to old friends again which is good, im happy about that, but some other friends are just dissapointing me recently. I dont know how to approach it and tell them, but I dont talk to some of them like I did in the summer and its sad. Some of my friends hang out with Mike more then me, and they know how much I hate him and they were one of the only people I thought I could trust and was really my best friend. That I think personally has changed just because they hangout with Mike and I cant trust them like I did. That really bothered me. I basically have one person I can run to with anything and thats Jorge, I really right now feel I can only trust him and my dog(s) with stuff. He doesnt judge me about anything and will always be there to listen to me when I want to bitch and complain, hes sitting there while im crying trying to figure out how to help me as hes holding me in his arms. Hes the only one who I think really does care about me and loves me other then my grandpa. Thats just really hard to accept because if I wasnt with him id fall to pieces. I pray everynight that my mom gets better and has a happy day instead of yelling at me for something or ordering me around like im her slave, I pray that my dad stays in recovery and stops being so mean towards me and snappy, I pray that my grandpa has good health and is livving a good life, I pray that Mike stops being such a miserable person and enjoys life while hes young. I pray that Jorge and his family and all of my friends are okay and healthy. I do not pray for one thing about myself yet I get called selfish? I buy my mom things, my friends, Jorge, my dad, I did Mike. I do things for everyone and yes sometimes I do get it in return and it feels good when someone does something for me, so I just keep doing it back. I sometimes feel I do to many things for other people but I think im just being ""selfish"" and continue doing things for other people. I hope people apperciate what I do for them, even if they dont, I still do it such as my mother. I just really dont unserstand why things are bad, then get better, then just get 10x worse then they were before they were good? Life is just a vicious cycle I think and you cant break it, ever. I just hope that it gets good again soon because im tired of crying, im tired of hating to come home at night and wishing I didnt have to and trying to find an excuse so I dont have to. Im tried of basically livving a lie everyday and then at the end of the day breaking down and being a bitch to Jorge. I dont want whats going on in my life to effect our relationship because with out him id be nothing at this point. I dont know if he actually knows that but its true. Im just scared, of alot of things, mostly just how life is gonna turn out for me. How are me and my family going to be in 10years from now? Am I still gonna be sitting at home at night on myspace and writing in my livejournal? Im just really scared of that, and hopefully things will start to brighten up again, I hope so. Im scared of whats gonna happen with me and Jorge because im always so insecure and scared that he will leave me, deep down inside I know he wouldnt do that to me but its still there from past expierences and he told me to not live in the past but sometimes its just a little hard, he has givven me no reason to think this way but I do and ive been trying for a couple weeks now not to be so insecure and self conscience. I need to stop judging myself and think he thinks the same way about me because I know he doesnt I just dont want to admitt that to myself. I guess I just did actually. I need to straighten my life out, and I need to do it soon. Well if anyone took the time to read all of that stuff thats bothering me jumbled up into one, thanks."

I went shopping =) I had to buy a suit case to bring my stuff home in b/c i bought wayy to much  stuff. I got to  meet adam from tbs<33 ahhh that was the most amazing thing ever in the world. You have no idea, I wasnt all like OMGOMGOMGOMGOOMGOMGOMGOMGGG b/c thats just gay lol but I got his autograph and he was like ""ohh your jessica"" b/c my dad told him about me, he signed my cds and then we played shuffle board b/c basically everyone there knew I was inlove with his band and him haha, it was funny and fun. We talked and shit he asked me what school I go to and what not   and I told him im gonna get my ged eventually and he was like hmm. Yeah me2 haha he said highschool isnt for everyone and im like exactly. I beat him liek 4 out of 7 games I think but I also think he let me win a few games. Whoever was playing with him made it a point to be like noo I dont wanna play anymore blah blah. It was nice.

It was very interesting, I think I got about 10-20 compliments about how I have a ""good head on my shoulders"" and that everyone thought I was older then I am, even adam woot woot haha. It was kinda upsetting, I cried but I wasnt the only one, everyone there cried and when I say everyone i really mean it.

One of the ladys that work there called my mom already to tell her again how   amazing I am haha and all this stuff a luff about my dad and this collage we had to do, it was hard b/c you had to do something where it was way back when befor the addiction started and my dad has been drinking for 39years and my mom doesnt know him when he was sober for a long period of time  like this and neither do I. Well I really hope my dad does good I really do, and all of the people there also they were so nice.

My dad is the only person I know that my  Grandpa doesnt like.. its b/c what he did to me my mom and brother and stuff like thatt. haha aww he just came in my room and like made my bed. I love that man, id go crazy if it wasnt for my him. So yeah my dad leaves tomorrow at like.. 12 I think and then his train leaves from pennstation at 3:05 and then in Maryland they will pick him up and stuff. ehh tomorrows gonna be hard, and bad. I'll get threw it, I have to, I have no choice. blahed blah blah blah. Okay well I was a bum today and did nothing. I quit smoking for like 6hours? I flipped. I need to get the patch or something or like cut down slowly and then just stop all together. That would be better cuz it was way to hard. Espically at a time like this. Yeah okay. whateverrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
I hate hate HATE. when people call me because they need something and havent spoken to me in ages, and hated me not to long ago. I think thats really just wrong. Find other sources to fucking to people then ask me out of no where. Its just not right. So fuck all of that shit. If you want to talk at leaste talk to me and then fucking ask dont be like. ""CAN YOU DO THIS"" ""GOODBYE"" I find that really disrespectfull and fuckedup. Blah the only reason im actually writing in this shit is cuz myspace has been madd fucked and so has xanga and I also lost my journal haha. Like lastnight, thats not good at all. I gotta find that shit. Last time mike tried to read it and i had to rip all the pages up an burn it. Fuckin cocksucker. Oh yeah that to, I mean I do love my brother I really do, and I wish so much that we had such a better brother/sister relationship but it just doesnt seem like we can EVER do that. I say now that I hate him b/c fuck that he hates me, he sure fuckin shows it. Honestly, idc how much its a problem that you have a ""little sister"" but you dont treat her like shit when all she did was always want to be friends with you and  have a normal relationship like brothers and sisters do. I know so many people that are bestfriends with there siblings and im not, its like im an only child with just some person living in my house with me. When we do talk its always fuck you fuck you you bastard i hate you your a bitch and we throw shit at eachother and slam doors and stuff. I mean were not fucking little kids anymore. I wish we were tho b/c when we were little we got along so much better. Then he got into drugs and it was okay bye jess and  I lost my brotehr and my bestfriend at the time and I was young. He moved back in and we were getting along and I loved it, it was great, I got to hangout with him occasionally and he would ask me to come and hangout with him and his friends. Then it just all went to shit. I hate that so much. Its bullshit. If i ever talk to him about shit like this I know what he will do just shurg his sholders smirk say I dont hate you and walk out of the room and act like everythings fine when we all no it isnt. Im not trying to say I want him to drop everything and be like my bestfriend and never ever fight again but I mean I want him to at leaste talk to me about shit, and know that he has a sister and dont fight as much and just be friends at leaste.

Well, I've been doing nothing with my life what so ever. I sleep all day and stay up all night doing nothing. I go out at like 3, I come home at 12, I go online, I go to sleep late and do the same thing everyday. I have an amazing boyfriend who I love and everything is going good. I dont have a job though. I dont go to g.e.d classes yet but I will get to that eventually. I'm actually waiting on a social worker lady she has supposed to be coming back since right after christmas. She says shes coming early in the morning and then says ""Oh no I'm gonna come at 8pm on a friday."" I dont think so lady. So yeah thats about it. I'll update whenever I decided to again."

I went to his house, read the letter. It basically said I'm kind of crazy. Haha. Whatever, its cool tho. I start home schooling monday at 9am which means I have to sleep in Cedarhurst on sunday. Wakeup and learn! What fun !! Not. Ah whatever. So then I went to the park and met up with some people and just chilled. We ended up in the back of the baglery and chilled there then everyone left and I walked basically to Dunkin Donuts and met up with a couple more people and went to the diner. I went to 7/11 to be a good daughter and get my mom a candy bar and I gave the guy a 10 and when he gave me back change it was way to much, he thought I gave him a 20 so I got back 19bucks instead of 9 haha what a fucking loser but I didn't say shit I got 10extra bucks in my pocket. My mom was like you took the guys money? I was like uh. yes! do you want me to give it back? No thanks it was his fault he cant fucking see its a 10 and not a 20, stupid ass people now a days haha. Well now I'm bored. So I'm writing in here, I'm going to bed soon tho. So fuck you faggots bye bye<33"

I love it and dont want it to end I think im gonna cry when it actually does which is in a couple of days but weekends better be the same as the summer. Kristina doesnt talk to me anymore and I think thats cuz im always in cedarhurst but shes ALWAYS with martin. whatever. its not like I havent lost bestfriends before I do all the time..So yeah.. so much shit happened in the past 2months its not even funny. its so crazy how drasticly ive changed, who i hangout with has change, what I do, the type of people I like, the things i was against is just out the window (age) nothing else you faggots. Idk its change but all for the good I think, I think im a better person, more self control with some stuff and more open minded. Seen a couple of people I havent seen in forever which is pretty cool, no grudge against anyone, I really like not hating anyone, and hopefully no one hates me but im sure thats not true haha. So there are so many boys so little time. Joke im not a slut but seriously. Im going threw so much shit with guys right now its so confusing as to what to do and who to pick who to tell get away who to tell hang around haha I sound like a slut but im not at all. I only like 2 people, and im pretty sure I know who im sticking with. If you talk to me daily you know who im talking about, but I dont know what im doing, im letting things happen cuz im not in a realtionship so I can still have fun. But anyway, Im actually very good friends with my bitch<33 and sarah and jessica, I loveee my cedarfag girlss always got my back homies<33 wish I was going to lawrence with you, well not really, but if I still did go there it would be 10x better having you guys there with me. hmm so my knuckle is hurting me like a bitch, its out of place/broken/something idk. Its still all blueish green and shit, its pretty bad.. im not that sick anymore thank god. I found out today like 4other people are sick always, fags got me sick haha its all good tho. Hopefully I start school soon, it might be a little bit late but I WANT to go back and get my life in order and startgen up and do good in school and shit, so I can prove so many people wrong and laugh in there face that would be amazing and guess what its gonna happen motha fuckas. Okay well I guess this shit is done cuz im rambling on about nothing and complete bullshit but no one reads this anyway. toodles fuckers. <333"

"event","<P>I <STRONG>never</STRONG><FONT face=Verdana size=2> update this thing. I never update xanga either. hm i write in this when im a bad mood usually which is sad. So my parents are driving me fucking crazy. I ask my so called dad to do ONE thing for me. To stop drinking. Does he do it? For three weeks in april after my sweet 16. Then he goes back to his normal ways. I actually got along with him even tho he was cranky from not drinking. I mean come on. I asked for ONE thing and he never does anything for me. I cant take this. He drinks. My mom goes in and out of the hospital like its going out of style and when hes drunk my mom bitches about him. When hes sober she bitches about him. When my moms sick he bitches about her. When shes not sick he bitches about her. What is this shit? Is it to much to ask that they DONT put me in the middle of it. Im sorry but I REALLY hate when I hear them talking bad about eachother. Just stop it. God. My mom cant help that shes sick but my dad CAN help his drinking. It's called aa. Has he gone? No. He says he has but he hasnt. Then he lies and says hes either not drunk or not hungover. Im not that fucking stupid that I cant relize. Im trying to do the right thing because im going back to school and everything trying to get my life back on track and I ask my dad to do one thing. Dont drink. It isnt working, it pisses me off so much he cant do one thing for me. I just wish my parents were still together but thats never gonna happen obvisouly. Im happy when I dont talk to my dad because I dont have to get pissed off about him drinking or hungover or any of that bullshit. He just HAS to call me and piss me off. Ughh. I think I might just stay in today. I dont know I said that yesterday also but I ended up going out. I think kris is getting madd that I go to cedarhurst alot. I dont want her madd at me but I just dont want to sit in meadowmere. I hate meadowmere. I know she doesnt like it cuz she doesnt like that enviroment but whatever. I dont know anything anymore. Im tired of life basically. I just want everything to go away but everyone knows that will never happen. ever. eh whatever. Blah I hate being all depressed, I think im gonna go back to bed so everything will be better tomorrow maybe? I dont know. Im gonna be an idiot and I know this. whatever. Oh and why does this fucking kid always find a way back into my life by him meaning to or not? I mean I finally get over myself and things just keep happening that make me want to KILL his girlfriend. I hear whats going on what hes getting into because of her and a bunch of other shit. Everyone sees him BUT me. I guess thats a good thing because I just might cry if I did see him espically with her. Ahh I dont know anymore. I dont know anything. I HATE when im like this ahusahdkjasdaasjdh. bye."

"event","hm.. skipping sunday. sorry guys. idk what was wrong with me. monday.. came home from my dads to come home and deal with my mother and my house flooding from the washermachine. help my grandpa fix that then did laundry and shit then around 6:30 i hooked my and my brother dinner and then watched the game and chilled all night woke up around 6:50 and got ready to go to the school. I thought it was gonna be bad. I didnt have a good feeling about it. All of the tests I took I did good.. the pyschoogist one thingy I did really good on idk how you do good on thoes thigns but whatever. and the other one i did good im on the right grade level and reading on a 12th grade level which is good I guess but Im not good in math they said I need extra time for math tests.. well I knew that cuz I hate math and suck in it. They are gonna send stuff out to diffrent schools to see which one is right for me.. make my scehdule and double up on classes to make up all my credits and hopefully ill start july 1st. that means no summer but ive had enough of a break and ill be home at like 2 something probably. thats if i get into the school which I hope I do. I dont care if I have to go 12months not 10 cuz i need to make this shit up. then she said at the end of nextyear they will see if i need to do that again but probably not, and if so like I said I dont care cuz i will be making all of my work up and graduate on time and get on with my life which would be great. So im really happy about that, finally ill get my life on track and go to school and do what im supposed to be doing. I need a job. Hopefully the bowling alley will call me soon then ill be all set. woot woot.
lately alot of people have been telling me I lost alot of weight and I look good. :-) 
makeup actually works haha im gonna wear it more often. Other then my mom and me being an idiot and having a bad temper everything is gonna go good and im happy.

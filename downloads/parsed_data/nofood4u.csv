"event","and now I'm on campus again.  Had Dr. Rhodebeck's class today and did some group work after class.  I really should attend that class every day from now on.  It's getting quite interesting.  Had a good weekend.  Thursday, I went out with Thomas and Jessie to The Pub on fourth street.  Jessie really liked Thomas and said he reminded her of JW.  Thomas is similar to him in many ways but not in others, but I can see where she gets that.  We left there and went to Howl at the Moon where I proceeded to get wasted.  Apparently, with my current medication, I can't handle alcohol so easily.  In fact, I didn't really have all that much to drink and somehow ended up puking anyway.  I remember Thomas kept leaving me to go hang out with Kirby and apparently I text messaged Thomas alot because I was feeling lonely without him.  I remember requesting songs and they kept playing replacement songs because they didn't know mine, which pissd me off.  I guess that's when I started cursing at the piano players and embarrassed myself and my friends around me.  Oh well, it was fun to me.  Then, out of nowhere, Brad comes up and I give him a hug like I haven't seen him in years even though I had just hung out with him that week.  He was with Erin, Greg's ex fiance, who has an interest in Brad.  I'm not so sure that she really likes the idea of dating Brad for the right reasons, but I'll let him figure that out.  It's wierd how he feels he can tell me how they had sex but he doesn't want to hear that I even have a boyfriend.  He quickly changes the subject when Patrick's name comes up.  

So, Thomas and I left Jessie and Ricky, which I CANNOT believe she is dating him again.  Ricky is friends with Roger, who quit calling me after my whole birthday incident.  So, I guess since she's desparate now, she needs him around again.  Either way, it's her life and I won't judge her.  So, now that I have a better recollection of what really happened, I am not so sure I like what I did.  I made an attempt to kiss Thomas a few times at Saddle Ridge that night.  That's not good because I think at the time it felt right but I was also drunk.  I know that I'm crazy about Patrick but I guess I slipped that night.  Now, I feel like I put Thomas in this whole funk again.  The sweet thing is that Thomas really took care of me that night.  He drove me home with my head on his sholder, he helped me throw up in some bank's parking lot, he didn't try to take advantage of me, he even protected me from my potential actions by taking me to Jen's as opposed to taking me to his place.  For that, I should probably be taking him out as opposed to him taking me out.  

So, the next day, I drag myself into work after having gotten two and a half hours of sleep.  I was sick at work all day, and then I went to play disc golf with Jen and JW and I took them out to eat to Rufad's, our favorite place.  Thomas and I went to see Elizabethtown (his first, my second) and he paid even though I tried to beat him to it.  While I do like it when a guy pays for me, he didn't have to do it.  I owed him a movie ticket.  Maybe he'll take me up on it...  Anyway, he got the same stuff I got from the movie, and then a little more than me with our different situations that we're currently in.  I love that movie.  I don't care what the critics say.

Saturday, I woke up with butterflies in my stomach.  I couldn't sleep past 9:30.  Mom, Jordan and I watched tv together and I got ready and packed.  I left Louisville about 3 and didn't make it to Indy until 6 or so.  I was so annoyed.  I was in a damn traffic jam around Seymor for over an hour.  It was awful waiting that long.  Then Patrick called me about 5 (our time) and said he was thirty minutes from his apartment and I explained that I was still in traffic.  I was supposed to go to Brown County that day with my family, but everyone cancelled at the last minute.  So now, we're all going to go either Nov. 5 or 12.  That gives me a reason to come and see him anyway, but it won't be for another two weeks, once again.  :(  

So, as soon as I get there we were back to normal.  It's like we left off where we were.  I hold on to that time because it's so precious to me.  To sit there in his lap is what I look forward to.  He just wraps his arms around me that's all I need.  I look forward to those moments.  I like that he can just pick me up and we just start kissing.  I think I like guys his size for that particular reason.  We watched Spanglish, which was okay, and then we were in bed by ten.  We woke up randomly at like five or six in the morning and start talking and other stuff.  I find out that he is a virgin after all, which I freaked out about.  It explains alot.  He's had girlfriends, and I'm not exactly sure what he's done with them but I'm not sure if he's waiting for marriage or what.  I didn't really care to ask.  I'll talk about it with him this week.  So after that we just hung out in his bed for a while and talked.  We got up and got ready and went to breakfast. Then we came back to watch Sin City, which I liked mainly for the cinmetography.  Then, I left.  So, he calls me after I leave and somehow we became boyfriend and girlfriend after that call.  Really funny...  He's just so random.  I'm happy that we figured that out.  He also said he plans on meeting my family soon.  I can't believe this is all falling into place.  I really think he's the one."

"event","and I'm up early trying to get my day started.  Saw Elizabethtown again last night with Thomie.  As always, we battled to the very end on who would pay.  That craphead never lets me pay.  I hate that.  Thomas liked the movie for the same reason I did.  We both like the whole idea that two people may be completely opposite of each other but yet they somehow fit.  It was very sweet, even after the second viewing, and I can't wait to buy that movie.

Got a lot to do today; tanning bed, shower, purse shopping, and so on. Better get a move on.

"event","I am in love with the idea of being in love.  I realized that tonight.  I want to be in love so bad I can't stand it.  I loved that movie.  It made me realize that good things can happen to people and love, maybe even true love, does exist.  Why is it that I know what I want and I feel so alone?  After seeing the movie tonight, I just wanted to drive. Straight to a specific destination and never come back. Never.  I'm so taken by that movie right now that I don't know what to do. I want my very own Drew Baylor from the movie. I just keep thinking about how next weekend will be here sooner than I know it.  It just bothers me that I won't see him for a whole 24 hour period.  And then, after that, unless something happens differently, I wont see him for another three weeks after that because of both of our schedules. I just hate uncertainty.  It's still uncertain because of the little time we've had, the fact that we rarely talk because I work a lot and he does too.  But every time we do talk or meet up, it's perfect.  I would rather have that than be with someone who is available all the time but doesn't fit.  That, I am certain of.  I just hate the in between time.  I also decided that I don't care if I'm head over heals about someone.  Risks are something I'm willing to take and if I get hurt, than ultimately, I'll know it wasn't meant to be.  I am confident that while it may hurt if things don't work out, it's always for a reason and that is a comforting thought.  

Either way, here I am, tired again.  I have to be at work at eight.  Guess I'll make it somehow.  In the meantime...I'm going to bed"

"event","and I'm so escatic!  God did I miss this city, my friends, my family, my bed, my tv with no v-chip, my church, everything.  The only thing I miss when I'm in Louisville is him.  This is only the third time I've gone to see him and everytime I realize how much more I like him.  I tried not to overanalyze anything about this weekend and decided that it came out pretty good.  I didn't get to spend any time at all with him but I did get to see JW's family and town.  It was great to see how close he is to his family.  I value that aspect.  It's so important for people to love and be close to their families and I just love that.    I didn't like his old church, but it's okay because he doesn't really care for it either.  Thank goodness, I found out that he likes a church similar to mine.  

Overall, I am happy with this weekend's events and am glad that I was able to see him, even if it wasn't for long.  For now, I will be casual about all this with everyone.  I don't want to make a big deal about this to anyone even though I could talk about him all the time.  I can't wait to see him in 2 weekends from now.  It always seems like an uphill climb before I get to see him again...oh well.  It'll be here soon."

Met lots of people, went to another boring church, played some disc golf, ate a bunch, and went to a low scale wedding. All in all, I had a lot of learning experiences from Patrick.  It's always interesting to get to know more about a person to see what shapes them.  Anyway, I gotta pack but I'm pretty happy about this weekend and can't wait to see him again."

Lucky for me, it was ten dollars at the Body Shop.  I know how to bargain shop.  Now, I just need to make a trip to Goodwill for a new vintage shirt.  Nothing beats the Taylorsville Lake shirt though.  That shirt has always been there for me, through thick and thin.  I also got new underwear at Victoria Secret.  Thank God for free coupons because I now own a good percentage of the pink collection.  

I gave Jen a best friend card today.  She really has been a great friend to me through the last seven or eight years. I don't know what I would do without her.  So swash to you Jen! Her joke wasn't too funny either...actually it was quite funny to the point of tears but that's why we're bff.

Tomorrow will suck, sort of. I work 8-1 and then I'm meeting JW at Irquois Park for some disc golf, and then I come back to work.  I need to tan somewhere in between that time.  Can't look white in my dress!  I am not too interesting I think because I have only talked about myself so far.  I think I'll write a poem.

"event","and I'm still up.  I can't sleep.  Just read your live journal.  I can't say much.  I can't change this.  I know I hurt you.  I don't know how to help you.  It's like I want to call you and be normal again but I know that even though you may come across as 'normal', we'll never be the same.  I can't change the way I feel.  I'm probably setting myself up for some huge disappointment.  I'll probably get what's coming to me.  I don't know.  All I know is that I can't stand seeing you hurt knowing it's me that did it to you.  

Other than ending my night in a depressing way, I had a pretty good day.  Got my hair done (finally), worked (not good) and so on.  I still have many questions in my head as to what my situation is.  I hate wondering and waiting.  I hate that I have now put myself out there and am just waiting to wake up from all this.  I wish I knew why I had such a bad feeling about this weekend.  I can't believe I bought cupcake mix and vanilla icing and red, yellow and blue icing decorations.  I hope you know that I'm making you specialized freaking cupcakes for your birthday.  I hope I don't feel stupid when I bring them to you and I hope that you like my pathetic superman design.  

This is the worst waiting period of my life.  I don't know what direction I'm going in and I don't know what to expect.  Right when I think I have him figured out, I get mixed messages.  Brad's right.  I have hung out with him a couple of times and act like I've been with him forever.  What is wrong with me?  Why do I fall so hard?  It kills me...

Every minute that goes by is a minute closer to hanging out with him.  Then time flies by when I'm with him and before I know it, I'm back where I started.  Maybe not after this weekend.  This weekend will be a great test to see what really is going on.  Either he'll be all about me or he'll disengage completely.  I'm scared that he'll disengage though.  Why do I feel this way?  I should be happy.  Everything's gone fine.  I spend too much time thinking about all of this.  I just need to get through the next few days and then I can see what lies ahead of me.  This will be the weekend he either advances or I quit seeing him altogether.  I can tell. I guess we'll see."

"event","I just saw Thomas's entry and want to cry...I just talked to him for an hour and a half and am not sure what to think.  I hate self analyzation.  I'm not sure what to think right now.  Thomas really made me think tonight and here goes...

Patrick does have the whole 'package' but it's not about that...at least it's not just about that.  I don't like that he doesn't want to hang out with me on his birthday and I don't like that we've hung out a few times and I don't know a whole lot about him still and I don't like that he's so busy we rarely get to talk.  

I do like that he is sweet, and that he can look at me and I melt and that he touches me and I get goosebumbs. I like that he's to the point and logical and doesn't do anything he doesn't want to do.  I like that he has direction and he cares about others and he loves his family and is religious.  I love that he took my hand so that I could be closer to him and I love that he cuddles.  I want to be with him because I feel something I've never felt that's unexplainable.  Maybe it's a crush and maybe I'm quick to say these things and maybe he might not feel the same way back but I feel I just know about this one and if I'm wrong then I'm wrong but I'm willing to try.  

I will take advice given to me and ask the hard questions and see what his answers are and if he gives them and see what he's all about.  All I know is that when I'm around him I feel perfect and any problem I have goes away.  He makes me feel like I'm good enough when I'm around without a word said.  When I'm around him I have no question of whether he really likes me or not because it's evident.  

I guess I'll find out this weekend what I want to find out.  Hopefully it works out but if not I can't change his mind. 

You don't know how much I treasure our friendship.  You don't know how much I hurt because I tried not to hurt you but instead I really did.  You don't know that I really did think we had something.  I'll be honest...I really think for as much as we had that somehow I had extremely bad timing that it comes down to the fact that I feel I made the best decision.  I really do.  I guess I'll find out for sure but oh well.  You really are so precious to me and I've fucked it up between us.  It flatters me that you really cared so much and notice all these details--we're similar in that respect.  I don't know though. I hope I've made the right decision."

Oddly enough, he wouldnt tell me how he met her.  Not sure why, but oh well, no bother to me.  This weekend was crazy because I met JW's cousin, whom they're trying to matchmake me with.  White water rafting was great, especially since I didn't fall out like Jen said I would.  

I'm very frustrated right now.  Only now have I realized that I am completely afraid of being close to someone.  Not sure when this will pass..hopefully soon.

So I had to post again because I'm in a real funk today.  Not necessarily a bad one but more of a different kind of one.  Jen said I am a cynical person and need to look at things how they really are instead of what they could be if the worst situations occured. So, I thought about it, and thought some more, and realized...I am cynical.  I always have been and I know why she brought that up.  I'm just being realistic about the situation though.

Of course, now that this has happened I know not to take it too seriously, considering the circumstances.  But I can't deny that Eugene Deb is one great kisser.  Being that I apparently kissed an unapologetic socialist, I may ask myself what I'm getting into, but I smile to myself remembering that at least I kissed an intelligent person.  I'd rather kiss someone like him than say....Tyler Hilton...wait...didn't I do that already?  Oh yeah!  

In all seriousness, it's only now that I can see that I've had some sort of attraction to Mr. Deb for a while but didn't realize it.  There's nothing better than someone who can make you laugh and kiss well at the same time.  This should be a fun way to start the school year."

I fell asleep in the last ten minutes or so of the show and had a scary dream.  I was in a car packed full of liberals who were mooning people in the taco bell drive thru.  Now I know I'm crazy.  Who the hell dreams about that??  So now that I officially hate dating and the awkwardness that comes with it thanks to Roger, I have decided to turn my attention to my LSAT studies.  Trying to study when youre not all here is mind blowing.  I think I got to quesition 2 and gave up for the night.  Practice tests can kiss my ass.  

After wandering aimlessly around Jen's house I just remembered that I was still online.  

I felt bad last night for leaving the guys who were buying me all of my drinks but one of them kept trying to hump my leg or something.  It's a good thing Veronica came because Katie left too early.  Katie definitely seemed different last night but I think she really was just tired.  At least she liked the trolly hop because I wasn't so sure I enjoyed paying $4 for sophia coppola's new champagne that comes in a can with a straw.  She obviously knows a lot about distributing champgane.

While looking at art was fun, my moment of zen came from this awesome kid who could be napolean dynamite's twin.  Thank God other people were being rude and taking pictures of this kid because it made me not feel so bad for doing the same thing. 

I can't wait to see these pictures.  Hope none of them have any surprises like the ones from Cancun contained."

My birthday was yesterday!!  I hope it was good seeing as how I don't remember much of it, but that's what happens when you keep taking shots that people give you.  The ipod was probably the best part of my birthday.  I've wanted one of those forever and apparently my friends caught on to that.  Speaking of which, people seem to catch onto alot of things I like without me knowing...not sure how.  Anyway, I'm going out tonight to celebrate my birthday some more.  I was thinking about doing the trolly hop but I guess it depends on the people I'm going with.  The good news is that I'm going with different people tonight, including a hot guy from work.  I'm not sure if he'll like me, seeing as how he doesn't know me but we'll see."

"event","friday i was grounded so i went out to dinner with my family.nothing special.than i got a text from adrienne telling me how her mom likes to compare me with dogs mouth.just because animals mouths are so much cleaner in general.it was pretty funny.so saturday i stopped by adriennes cause i was bored and had nothing important to do.so apparently i look like her dad so her bro calls me dad and answers the door in his boxers...why would i get confused with the dad? its just weird.but it was funny.so yea hung out there.later that night we could finally chill alone and than her neighbor asks us to baby sit at first i was mad but it was cool actually.i thought it was gonna be hell but turned out to be pretty fun.we watched them do the tarzan swing and than found a turtle and i got it to come out of its shell.we couldnt find a shoe box so we let it go.than we spent atleast 30 mins trying to figure out the wireless controller things.the batteries were loose?so thna i jsut destoried the kid in it.but i let him score acouple times than just molested him in madden.final score 62 to 22.its sad but it was fun.than after that we got them to settle down and stop playing with the guns and baseball with socks and we watched a movie..Son of the MAsk..it ruined the first ""the mask"".but the kids finally fell asleep and me and adrienne just cuddled on the really really comfortable leather chair.oh yea riding home from adriennes my chest started hurting and my arm went numb...all signs of a heart attack and my parents were just like yea youll live.and its been bothering me ever since than.ok so sunday hung out with kyle all day which i really havent done for a while weve both been busy lately.so i left kyles ate dinner than went over adriennes to study and ate another dinner.it was pretty good...steak and hamburger is a good combo.than we stood around for alil, and her bro sprayed her sister with carpet cleaner and apparently it burned and she started crying.than we went outside and actually studied..yea we really did.than after that once the house was quiet we watched like 3 different ends of movies than 50 first dates...the day was fun all and all...

so today i went to school than hung out with adrienne.it was exciting as usual than i had to leave before her dad came to pick her up on short notice.it was fun and for the record we do have the best timing"

[ mood |  crappy ] 
[ music | murphy lee- stomp to this ] 

ok school sucked it was really hot and humid, i hope we get air enxt year.the teachers are talking about it even though the budget didnt pass.

nothing happened on sunday rode with nick and chelsea.than chelsea left. than me and nick and some other kids played frisbee in friendlys parking lot.than we almost got hit by a car crossing the street.than we were in rite aid and they had a security check while we were walking around.what the fucks up with that.i hate that shit just because were wearing all black doesnt mean we bad kids...than after that i went to adriennes hung out until she had to start working on her report.it was fun.
today sucked ive been in such a weird mood, this never happens.im usually pretty happy especially lately.but i unno maybe its cause im use to going outside and i really didnt do that..i slept all day.maybe its just the heat but i unno.i want the mood to go away.hopefully it will.i dont really feel like talking to anybody right now.so its whatever.im not myself i hate it.
tomorrow me and adrienne have a bet to see if we can go one day without tickling each other..see we tickle each other like crazy and we want to see if we can go one day...the winner gets a prize choosen by the losers.its gonna be fun and interesting..
...well im gonna go watch the thunder and lighting.

psycho snap than ultimate nirvana? [Jun. 4th, 2005|12:39 am] 
[ mood |  relaxed ] 
[ music | nelly ] 

ok so i no if your taking the time to read this than your prolly wondering about the headline.its been a rough couple of days around my house. wednesday my parents faught all night,starting at dinner.my dad got pissed threw his fork and was about 3 cms away from hitting me in my face.so after that i just avioded everybody that night cause i was already stressed from that.than thrusday all they did was fight and i couldnt take it anymore the stress they put on me to be like my bro and sister was so bad for me to take anymore...i snapped on them, punch the door and dented it, put shoes on, and walked out.than when i came home i did my pinata.i was so stressed out i was going insane and my hand was twitching.so i tried to go to bed and couldnt sleep, watched starsky and hutch atleast 4xs and the ninja turtles.

butttttt when i saw adrienne the next day i got a big hug, it made me feel so much better.it was divine.school was interesting i was so tired and zoned out it was funny.i took a spanish test and guessed on every question, it was funny cause i just dont care anymore.but after school i went to adriennes it was awesome we have fun doing the stupidest things, but its the best thing in the world.so we hung out and randomly her bro came down in the hand towel cause he just got out of the shower? it was weird and he had to walk around the kitchen so his ass wasnt hanging out when he turned around.than he came down again wearing boxers.it was pretty funny cause we were talking with her mom and than her bro walks in his boxers.i tihnk that family is getting to comfortable around me.but anyway i came home from adriennes and everybody was being nice to me cause i was in a good mood for once.than i went to see the longest yard with adrienne.it was pretty funny actually.and for all of you out there that havent seen it caretaker dies, ha ruined your fucking movie.but anyway the movie was ""sold out"" but i wasnt about to argue with the lady to get tickets so we waited like an hour for the next show.oh yea i donated a dollar to some charity and i got to write my name on a star and it will hang up so i feel good inside and special.but while were waiting some little fat kid came up to adrienne and was like ""hey!""-stares at chest-.dont you just love it when little fat kids hit on your girlfriend while your right there?..it was pretty funny but the movie starts we watch and it and some old guy that looks like kyles dad sits down next to me, i was creeped out by it.he was like one of those i molest my kids when were home alone kinda guys.but the movie was funny and i had a great time and really helped me take my mind off things...

well im tired of writing soooooooooooo peace out

[ mood |  bored ] 
[ music | mcr- you no what they do to guys like us in prision ] 

im bored so i figured id write in this.well school was fun,sike.but i wore a bright blue shirt instead of the usual all black today and i never heard the end of it, especially nikki she had a unhealthy obsession with it.everyone kept saying it brought out my eyes and it was starting to piss me off, i dont no why i just dont like compliments i guess(is that a bad thing?).but yea adrienne was suppose to come over but she had a doctors appointment. so i did my pinata instead with my sister and she taught me how to say ""i do not like catilina salad dressing on my moo moo!"". yea thats my sister for ya.but now since thats done and adriennes not over im bored.i jumped on my trampoline for alil, but that didnt last long its hot as balls out and i just dont have the spirit to jump in the hot ass sun.ok so i think im gonna like rock out to some music and play alil football...write later if i get bored.

good times [Jun. 1st, 2005|09:46 pm] 
[ mood |  lazy ] 
[ music | iron maiden ] 

well i decided to make one of these things since i havent had one since last year and i miss writing in it.ok all the drama and shit is behind me,ive been the happiest ive been in a long time. possibly the happiest i have been since 8th grade. this girl adrienne, she means everything to me right now.she makes me smile when i dont even want to live.they funny part is we met when im drunk and now im completely sober thanks to her good influence.yea we meet at this girl laurens sweet 16 party as soon as i saw her my eyes were locked on her for the rest of the night.when i was drunk i had the balls to talk to her and i used the greatest pick up line ever ""so you come here often?"" luckly she didnt think i was so much of an asshole so when i got home i was looking through myspace and i got an invite to be her friend.we started talking and we hung out and its been history for there on.well thats basically all that has happened since than.so ill start on current stuff...
iight today was stressful except i hung out with kyle i havent really had the chance to do that alot lately.i lifted and ran at highland before he came up so we played tennis with denise and adrienne.denise was beastly as usual and adrienne is ok but shell get better...kyle was playing with a raquetball racket, enough said.but it was pretty fun.adrienne and denise were talking up at the net and me and kyle were goofing around..ok heres the funny part we were hitting it back and forth and kyle hits it to me and i backhand it as hard as i can and it nails adrienne in the back...i felt so bad but it was funny...me and adrienne have this thing where we seem to injury each other on accident but right now shes winning 4 to 2...but when i got home everyone was argueing which isnt exactly stress free and than i dont no drums was like whatever i was really distracted but playing jazz music is really relaxing and surprising challenging.when i got home i just grabbed some sublime and went out side to look at the stars cause its a nice night...im starting to fucking hate lights...i want to see the whole fucking sky..but it was all cool and chillaxing until my neighbors started yelling and i came in and now im writing in this thing so im done for today....

we're both wasted, but we're not going anywhere like this.

for me to walk face first into sliding glass for your pleasure.
all in the taste of salt on your neck.
(now i) choke on the urge of taking it back
(till i'm) spilling the blood that rests on my tounge.
(dreaming) of holding your head, detached from the rest.
this fuse left burning, but now we're far too close.
to let the past stitch our wounds and seal our tears.
lust sick from the guilt you spread.
lust sick in this moment. we won't believe in anything"

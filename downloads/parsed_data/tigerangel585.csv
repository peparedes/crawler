so i got in my first accident today! ..wahoo.. not cool at all. over 500 dollars in damaage..but at least i'm ok, right?!  ugh..  so yea. accident = bad omen? i hope not.  i'm leaving for colorado tomorrow with jenn. that should be cool.  what else is on my mind... i want a boyfriend. i miss having someone there. mostly i miss jeff. i miss him like hell and its so hard not having him with me.    after my accident he was the first person i called. the FIRST person, he's the only one i'll ever wana run to to tell me that its all okay. yet its not. and i can't . and he donest care. or at least he pretends to..so its tough.

""i'm missing your laugh, how did it break?

"event","hey guys~
what's going on?  so yea...leavin for colorado with jenn on friday! w ahooie..cept her and i havn't talked in weeks cuz she's overobessive with her boyfriend, andy. she has'nt talked to any of us (the girls) in so long and its really annoying. i mean i guess its a taste of my own medicine, after what i did with jeff. but still..its just craziness i guess. things are pretty good. i still really like this one guy that i was k inda with but he seems to be pulling away. of course that could just be me being all..ugh nobody loves me.but i dono.  hopefully we'll get to hang out soon before i leave. or after. i've been feeling horrible, i can't play in my friend adam's band for his graduation party which i promised him..cuz now i'm goin to colorado. and i told him today and he seemed so gross about it..but hes the kinda guy that wouldn't tell u if he was mad about somethin cuz hes so darn nice.  its frustrating. i'll just get him a really sweet grad present and try to make it up to him cuz i feel bad about it. well that's all for now..i'm gona go get out of my pj's (its 1:15!)  later."

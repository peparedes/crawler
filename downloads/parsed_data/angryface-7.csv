My parents have been out of town since friday and its been pretty cool.. last night was the best jessi came over and i made her watch slc punk and i think that movie was just a tad too heavy for being high but whatever.. but today was the strangest day of them all.. because my uncle called me and talked to me about his girlfriend from fucking highschool with me for like an hour.. it was the craziest thing in the entire world..  oh well that was my weekend... last week was terrible.. at least friday was because heres what happened.. we got to go get breakfast in newspaper and john stole alcohol from lowes food.. (wine)and then got piss ass drunk and went to mr. bakers class being a drunk retard and then he got sent to the office.. me and cory aaron and eric and jack all had to go too because we were in the car and didnt report his intoxication to the school.  isnt that fucking bullshit? and mr. smith is threatening legal action or at least 10 days suspension which would automatically fail each and everyone of us for the fucking year.. which is completely not fair.. did i fucking drink? no.. i wasnt even there while they were drinking i was sitting in the goddamn car i didnt see them drinking for all i fucking know aside from johns breathe he was bullshitting being drunk.. goddamn im not fucking reponsible for him and its not like he didnt get caught? its not like just because i didnt nark him out hes not in trouble..he fucking got caught so i think mr. smith needs to pull that fucking black power stick out of his ass.. sorry.. im done."

"event","yes after a week im finally home, since im high im going to be really deep about my trip.. i had the greatest time of my entire life, i met wonderful people that i hope ill stay in touch with.  They were all so wonderful and in case any of them end up reading this i wanna say thank you to some of them.. thanks erin for talking to me in caucas i think we had a killer time complaining hah.. and thanks gel for being the coolest girl on the trip, you made student lounge time fun as hell and i hope you enjoyed my stories as much as i enjoyed telling them, and thanks rachel for being the sweet and funny sado masicist you are.. and thank you korey for being an inspiration to me, thanks mina for being my first muslim friend and showing me what it really feels like to be an american, and renee and mike (who i doubt will read this) mike for making me feel a little less escentric and how cool a politician is, and renee for giving me more respect for the military and supporting my dreams even though i only knew you for a week.  I love you all for the week you gave me and i am the person ive always strived to be, and i dont think that could have happened had every single one of you not been there.  i know there are a million more i wanna thank but i have such a short attention span. .hah.. but yeah.  The trip as im sure you could tell was great even though it was a little too political for my taste.  the highlights: I met ralph nader (bob nader hahaha.. gel) and i heard ann comptom speak, and i got to meet the head hancho for the marine corp and i got to meet the cutest old woman, i cant remember her name right now but she was great, i got in a fight with a staff member of elizabeth doles office, i got to eat nasty food and goto the white house.. uhm.. i got to see a million homeless crazy people, and i got to harrasse my neighbors in the hotel and climb out my window.. it was fun. now im back to wake forest with my friends who (dont take this offensively) arent quite like the ones i left.. and i almost wish i was back in those dressy clothes and uncomfortable shoes so i could still be with ""my heros""."

Then when we were outside richie and his friend jeremy were outside and thats another completly crazy and terrific story thats just far too much to type but anyway and me and cory hung out at the mall until like nine and then i went to cory's to get my bookbag and jessi followed me home so she could call her mom, and now.. about two hours later here i am!!! im tired as hell.. its been a looooooong day but anyway im off to.. do something

I'm still kinda excited about my birthday and i cant believe that its tuesday.. and it sucks that its a weekday but eh oh well.  ive decided that i REALLY hate aim, and i couldnt begin to give a good reason why but i do, its just an annoyance but its sad because i hate it but i dont know if i could function normally without it, easily anyway.  I really like this song so I'm gonna share the lyrics then uhm go find something to do so i stop thinking :) later!
There is no beginning to the story. A bookshelf sinks into the sand
and a language learned and forgot, in turn, is studied once again.
It's a shocking bit of footage viewed from a shitty TV screen.
You can squint through snowy static to make out the meaning.
Just keep on stretching the antennae, hoping that it will come clear.
We need some reception, a higher message, just tell us what to fear.
Because I don't know what tomorrow brings. It is alive with such possibilities.
All I know is I feel better when I sing. Burdens are lifted from me, that is my voice rising!
So Michael, please keep the tape rolling. Boys keep strumming those guitars.
We need a record of our failures. We must document out love.
I have sat too long in my silence. I have grown too old in my pain.
To shed this skin, be born again, it starts with an ending.
So thank you friends for the time we shared. My love stays with you like sunlight and air.
Oh how I truly wish I could keep hanging around here but my joy is covering me.
Soon, I will disappear.
It's not a movie, no private screening. This method acting, well, I call that living.
It's like a fountain, a door has been opened. We have a problem with no solution
but to love and to be loved.
So, I've made peace with the falling leaves. I see their same fate in my own body.
But I won't be afraid when I am awoken from this dream and returned to that
which gave birth to me. And the story goes on and on and on and on..."

"event","i didnt like today.. and i especially didnt like waking up.. i dunno what it is but recently i have had no drive to wake up in the mornings.. and this morning i was pretty depressed when i woke up and i just wanted to go back to sleep and die and never have to go through the stupid experience of waking up again because that is my least favorite part of the day.. i wish that if i couldnt just die that i never slept because goddamnit i hate waking up.. i have all these happy dreams and they're really odd but they have this whole happy feeling and i wake up and im so confused and the happy shit from the dreams just go away and blah.. im rambling so im gonna stop.. well to reiterate my point.. today sucked.. 1st period i slacked off i just looked up pictures and looked at johnny depp and did shit for the newspaper calander.. then uhm second period was really boring and stupid we took an assload of notes and i had some make up work to get.. i got my report card and i got 4 b's and an a and my gpa came out to be a 4.0 yay! anyyyyway.. then lunch i went off with jessi and it was alright i guess i got really pissed off at this chick in front of us because she was being an uber cunt.  then third period was hell we took SO MANY FUCKING NOTES and did chemistry shit and it was boring then we had a huge ass packet for homework.. then spanish was alright we took a quiz and read our current event shite it wasnt that great.. then after school i took eric home and ran up to the mall and bought a spanish-english dictionary and i found some really interesting book on dreams.. and with the whole happy crazy dreams that i have every night i decided it was about damn time to actually try and figure them out.. im supposed to be looking up something on deism and studying for us history and chemistry.. gah which reminds me i need to stay after tomorrow and make up that goddamn quiz.. last night was fun.. even though im kinda afraid that im enjoying david's company less.. maybe its just the effect he has on me.. eeeeeeehhh but id rather not get into that because thats a long boring topic and i just dont even like thinking about it too much because it makes me nervous.  im tired.. screw studying i think i just might goto bed now.. *fingers crossed*"

"event","last night i didnt do anything really.. i drank all the wine in the house and got pretty ripped but it wasnt any fun because all i did was sit around and babysit.. i talked to chuck for awhile and it was great because i sent him a lot of pictures.. he probably has roughly a million of me.. haha.. then i watched pulp fiction and tried to figure out whats in that goddamn briefcase but i swear its fucking impossible.. me and my dad talked about it and he thinks its a soul which makes sense i guess.. i was kinda thinking since the movie is pulp fiction its just pulp or something.. but knowing terantino he didnt even know what was in the case and just thought itd be cool to put it there and piss people like me off who are dying to know whats in it.. i still dont like that vincent dies because i like him a lot.. but anyway.. today im not sure whats gonna happen me and david had plans to hang out but i called him yesterday and he gave me the weird.. ehh i dunno.. so whatever if he doesnt wanna do something i might go hang out with oliver before his mother comes back in town.. or ill go see jessi at work.. or maybe i wont do a damn thing today just like yesterday.. oh! i bought a dress yesterday for my banquet when i goto washington and its pretty and it makes me look really thin even though i know ill only wear it once.  i also called rachel and had this drunk cry fest for an unstated reason and i feel pretty stupid about it now.. my damn cell phone keeps going off and its annoying as hell.. stupid aim.. i had a really crazy dreeam last night but i think it makes a lot of sense with the perdicament ive put myself in.. richie is this cool kid from school and i had a dream that he was there and matt delerenzo was there and i was being a whore and making out with them both it was really weird.. but i understand the deeper meaning behind it.. well.. only kinda.. anyway im off to do something"

I saw david and his really cute cat and i had a terrific time even though i was really close to being lost in raleigh.. and if david ends up reading this.. im not going to say anything more about last night and not give him the satisfaction of having me be embarrassed.. mwuahah.. anyway.. then today it was snowing, im sure all of you knew that anyway.. but yeah.. so i went to school and kept thinking they'd send us home and from what the news was saying and all that jazz it seemed like they werent.. so i called my dad first period and asked him if i could come home at lunch.. then it was still snowing and me and cory decided we were gonna leave after first period.  then belcher said that he'd count us as absent for today so it didnt seem like we were skipping YAY.. so here i am.. the roads sucked.. and it was really bad driving my breaks sucked and i was slidding all over the place and i was really scared i was gonna run into something.  tonight jack fitz wants to go see big fish with me and im all for that because im really excited about big fish.. YAY!!! butttttttt anyway.. yes im home and my dads out getting me sand bags to put in the back of the truck so theres weight and less of a chance that i slide.. not that ill be driving anywhere or anything.. but yes.. im off to enjoy my snow day!!! oh! and the best part of today is that i get all the pros of having a real snow day and i dont have to come back on a teacher work day and make it up! or take my chemistry test im not prepared for! hurrah!!!!!!

I had to babysit then Jessi stopped by and dropped off the coolest present!!! more batman things.. mwuhaahaha.. then at about 2 my parents came home and i drove around aimlessly for awhile, I got some food and then on my way towards raleigh I saw cory which was cool (him and sheryll are back together which i find rather odd) then uhm.. i came home and watched the end of bruce almighty with my parents.. then i ate some more food and watched A CHRISTMAS STORY (my favorite part about christmas) and now im sitting here talking to my friend Chris (one of my p2p friends)and of course a compliment always gets me in a good mood and he said he wished he had put a move on me while we were in australia because i was hot and had a nice body!! how great is that? not sure if i believe him or not but he was one of the most attractive guys on the trip!!! well yes.. needless to say im in a terrific mood.. which is a good start for christmas.. yay!! my mother is drugging me and my brother.. well.. me because im sick and i need cough syrup and itll knock me out.. but my brother isnt sick and my mom is giving him cough medicene.. which doesnt make any sense.. but anyway.. yes.. im off to... uhm... replay the conversation with chris in my head and contemplate what might of happened while we were at lake bennet in our piece of shit rooms.. and NO im not going to masturbate!!! sickos"

"event","my throat is killing me.. im insanely sick and today didn't help at all.. i was really looking forward to break and saturday was a good start but today royalled sucked dick. Alright I woke up at 7:30 because my mom wanted to get to the dmv early, so i could get my after nine.. and i woke up and my house was freezing, i didnt really notice because my mother likes it cold.. but then i went downstairs and i had to go outside for something and it was warmer outside than in.. then my mom started bitching because our heater broke.. again.. so i got ready and then we had to wait for the heater people to come by and look at it.. then my mom had to call the WRONG COMPANY to come get it fixed.. after a huge ordeal and arguement we left.. and then we got to the dmv.. and the dmv's computers werent working.. so after waiting for like 45 minutes we left and came back home.. theni  sat around being sick.. for awhile and my mom went to the grocery store.. then Bang Bang your dead came on tv and i was REALLY excited about getting to see it.. but NO my mother made me call the dmv back then we drove back out to lousiburg waited an hour and i got my after nine (unenthusiastic yay) then i went home and our heater was fixed.. then i kinda wandered around my house for awhile then after my dad went back to work and the heater guy left i drove up to the mall to see jessi.. i walked around the shoe dept and i couldnt find her.. but i saw tonya which was cool i guess.. then i stopped by rebeccas to give her my [mothers] christmas present then i came home sat around for awhile watched a few movies and my parents came home, my dad is piss ass drunk and blah.. i talked to chuck today which was cool because i havent talked to him in a while and i have about 5 voicemail messages that he's left me.. and they're really funny. uhm.. i cant think of anything else that happened recently that was interesting.. dont shoot me if im wrong, but ive been sick and tired so its hard to form complete thoughts.. that actually make sense anyway.. tomorrows christmas eve and i dont know if ill update any because ill probably be dead.. dan and his wife and his kids are all coming over.. so they'll be here until odd hours of the morning... and its just gonna blow.. so ive decided to kill myself tomorrow before they get the satisfaction of driving me insane.. im off to take more cough medicene"

"event","Hello lovelies!!!! I've had a terrific break thus far.. last night was by far one of the most fun nights ive had in a long ass time.  Lets see.. i left at around 5 and picked up trevor then we drove out to johns and got high in his closet then cory came and we smoked some more.. then we ate alot and sat around johns room.  Then we went to go buy fear and loathing so we could watch it while we were high.. then i had to get cory to follow me home so i could go back over there.. then uhhmm... we went back over there and john had picked up chris and chris got high with us.. and let me just say that chris and john are my two favorite people to get high with, chris is really funny and so is john and they just make for a very pleasant high.. anyway.. then we found john's porn and me and chris and cory watched a lot of it.. lol it was pretty funny because he had A LOT.. then uhh.. we watched fear and loathing and ate some more and then me and cory had to leave.. then i came home and passed out.. today wasnt as great as last night but its been pretty good.. i felt sick all day so i called rebecca and told her i couldnt make it.. then uhm i cleaned my room, then i spent the rest of the day watching short films on sundance which is terrific because i love short films and i saw some really interesting ones.. oh.. random note.. oliver hasnt left for charlotte yet.. i was mistaken.  My dad found a nail in the tire.. and one of the new ones too!!! and of course i got blamed for it, even though anyone could have run over a goddamn nailand there wouldnt have been anything i coulda done about it if it was me.. jesussssss.. anyway... oliver stopped by today and i had to hide in a blanket lol.. because i look and feel like hell.  i lost my schedual so.... i dont know where any of my classes are.. ohhh well.. now im talking to oliver online trying to figure out what movies he should download.. hey thats not a bad idea.. im off to download some.. byeeee

"event","Well today went well I got a 97 on my AP english exam YAY!!! me and cory ate some bojangles then went to his house and studied.. well he studied and i mostly watched tv.  after the exam cory brought me home then i sat around with my mother for awhile.. i tried to redownload all of my invader zim episodes.. but i kept getting the episodes without video and that is just SATAN i HATE when it does that.. it makes me so angry i could eat vegemite.. gah.. anyway.. then i took a nap and my mother talked to me the entire fucking time it was so annoying.. she had a conversation with me.. so i put the pillow over my head and she kept talking.. she even started talking louder so i'd be sure to hear her.. anyway.. then i woke up and watched some weird old movie.. then looked over my spanish workbook which has led me into the conversation with brandi.. shes getting kinda frustrated because im only speaking in spanish to her.. hahaha we're insulting one another and its pretty amusing.. im not in a bad mood today.. i guess its because of the terrific grade i made on my english exam.. i only miss 6 questions out of 200 hurrah!!! patricks back in town.. and rebecca is coming in tonight.. thats it for my college people update.. i refuse to pack my movies up when im packing my room and i told my parents and they finally agreed but i dont know where the hell im gonna put them.. haha ill just stack them on the floor somewhere i guess.  I got my college essay back and ms. dove really liked it i guess because she put a smiley face on it and said WOW powerful stuff!  and it was great.. im gonna miss that woman.. shes been so great this semester.  next semester should be easier than this one because ill be in spanish.. chemistry will be the hardest class.. i wanted to go visit oliver today but it didnt happen thanks to mi madre.  oh well.. tomorrow im gonna go shopping with my dad because he got this big ass bonus.. haha im gonna make him sorry for telling me about the money.. muwhahahaha... anyway.. i uhh.. have to go pretend to study for my two hard exams.. hasta luego!"

"event","Its another hump day.. and its nothing I could call humptaculous.. i was in a pretty ill mood for the better half of it.  I've been in one of those really sad moods and I can't decide on a reason..  but first lets get into my day.. first period we didn't do anything!!!!! at all!!! I sat around with Jack, Eric, and Cory and of course i was sexually harassed again.. then I got picked up and tickled.. then second period was just review and i did'nt write a damn thing down because it was so freakin easy! we found out Tameka is Ms. Dove's neice..haha those crazy cats.. then lunch was kinda blah.. it was olivers last day at school and he went off to see the new lord of the rings so me and rachel hung out with tyler and matt and steven payte.. it was ehhhh.. i guess it was okay.. math today was shitty.. i didnt do anything we reviewed for a little while then the rest of the period was free.. and it was just blah.. then us history was shitty mr. baker gave us an insane amount of work that i havent finished yet. i need to work on some of that tonight.. gah well i came homea nd watched breaker high and just shoot me and fought with my brother and talked to brandi and i guess im not upset anymore i dunno it kinda feels like she thinks me moving is harder on her than me.. she says shes gonna miss me and i dont understand how its gonna be any different shes in korea.. i dunno.. whatever im actually kinda looking forward to moving i guess. maybe its just my crappy mood.. but the sooner i leave the better.. ive got a major case of pms.. but its all disslexic and came after the red flag was up.. i dunno blah.. im in that mood where i just wanna cry.. i cant deal with people the way i used to.. i get frustrated like all this past week or so ive just been getting really pissed off at everyone for small reasons.. i cant help it.. and its not like drugs can help because they haven't been.. then i got a call from a certain someone and it really scares me.. like im REALLY freaked out about it.. in a bad way.. and i dunno what to.. im gonna go eat.. food is good medicene for being depressed.. or having pms.. either one."

"event","Well today was alright I guess.. nothing spectacular.. aside from the fact that I was on crack for the better half of it.. hah not really.. i was just REALLY REALLY hyper.. lemme see.. first period wasn't too bad..we watched some movie while i was getting sexually harassed like always... *sigh* then second period was alright i guess.. we talked about ms. dove being on a bowling league which was interesting... then lunch was like it usually is... i had to call my mom to tell her i was staying after.. (i'll get to that part a little later) then math....was math even though i tried not to I fell asleep while we were reviewing.. im gonna shoot myself for doing that when the report cards come i nthe mail because my exam grade is gonna stink.  I've kinda noticed lately that A LOT of people annoy the hell out of me.. and its weird because im not pmsing.. i dunno what it is.. this when i REALLY want to move to get the hell away from everyone.  anyway.. after that random thought.. us history wasn't that bad besides the INSANE amount of review work he gave us.. but its not like its all that hard.. its just looking it up in the book.. i think i might actually do alright on my us history exam.  ive got a terrible headache.. but then after us history i went to ms. doves class to take a test and john wass my ride home.  I took it then waited out in the hallway and talked to Davis for awhile then John came out and we had to run to the library so he could type up his english paper that was due yesterday.. then we were leaving and we ran into Trevor (the hot one, not ashley's trevor) then me and john skipped down the hallway and ms. dove wasnt in her classroom so we didnt know what to do with his paper so i slipped it under the door and it got really funny.. then we skipped back to the door to leave and ms. dove was like where'd the paper go? and john pointed at me and was like IT WAS HER FAULT.. it was pretty damn funny.. then uhm.. john brought me home.. i watched some strange australian show.. and just shoot me.. and now im off to work on my relaxation exercises and this project ive decided to start working on (not school related).  P.S. I'm still really angry and Brandi.. and im far too busy to email her the 32904890284 page email itll take to explain why im angry.. anyway.. im off to...do some things.."

"event","Well this is somewhere around my 10th attempt at a journal.. and if I tire of this one, like i did all the others.. then I give up.  I'm sure the majority of the people who read this.. (mainly rebecca) is tired of watching my server jump every few days.. anyway.. lemme see.. exams are on the way.. we start testing on thursday.. and ill get my after nine next tuesday horray! its also getting closer to moving day.. whenever the hell that'll be.. my parents are guessing sometimes mid jan to mid feb.  So over break my mother is demanding that i pack my things and move all the shit out of my room so they can repaint it and replace the carpet.. blah.. its kinda depressing.. no matter how much i hate this town its kinda scary thinking about moving to a compeletly different place.. especially utah.. gah.. i dunno how i feel about it.. i have an assload of reasons why i should be happy about moving but then theres a handful of reasons i wanna stay and it seems like that handful of reasons means more than the assload.. im ranting so i'll stop myself and talk about today.  First period I didn't do anything.. at least I don't think I did.. honestly I don't remember but the likely hood of me doing something in newspaper is... like .000000000000001 percent.  Second period was fun because John was high and kept making funny noises and faces.. hah.. what a funny kid.. then lunch was like it normally is.. spent with Oliver and Rachel.. on that note.. that brings me to another rather depressing subject.. Rachel is gonna be homeschool after this week and I'll miss having her around at school.. and Oliver graduates after this week..so I won't have him to bother.. gah again... then third period wasnt that bad.. even though im two miliinchs (made up measurement but.. its supposed to be REALLLYYYY small) from flipping out over that exam.. id like to keep a decent grade in there.. but looking over my review and sqwuiggily marks from sleeping.. ill probably end up with a c for the year.. then us history is terrible.. our review sucks.. teacher sucks.. class sucks.. and ive got ap with the same damn teacher next semester!!!! whoo!!!!!!! im off to kill my lungs for awhile.. take a shower.. find some entertaining cartoons.. then goto bed.. yay for mondays!"

"event","Well its been a pretty good day, thanksgiving went really well and everyone had fun. I really miss Art though, but i don't know where he is, he's not home and i really want to talk to him.  This year has gone by so unbelievably fast, its weird my life is going flying by!!  Well swimming is over and now i dont know what to do with myself after school, hopefully i'll get to see Art more.  Tomorrow were supposed to go with my family to go see Shallow Hal, it looks ok to me. I cant wait until Christmas break im so ready for it."

"event","aaaaaahhhh, this is the 3rd time im sick and this is defidently the worst ever. I cant even talk, my throat it hurts so bad, it feels like its burning and someone is scraping it with a knife whenever i swallow, oh my goooosh i just want it to go away. Why does this keep happening? The doctor said i might have mono and i'll more than likely miss state this thursday!! Im so pissed off!! Oh and to top it all off, i feel like its impossible to see art anymore, i miss him so much.  I just want to spend at least one day with him, is that so much to ask? I just want the pain to go away, i cant eat, i cant drink and it sucks cause i want to eat but it hurts so bad. Art come on i told u to get online, i want to talk to you. Come on come on!!! i told you 6 and its now 6:03!! Oh well i hope he comes on soon."

"event","Well I'm here at home sick agian. I learned my lesson. Where is everybody at? I feel like im lost or something and im alive but im not. I love the days when you just sit at home in your pajamas all day and watch tv, it reminds me of the summer. I also hate it because it always depresses me somehow. Like it makes me think of how much im wasting my life just sitting around not hanging out with the people i love and never see. I miss natalie, she called me crying last night because she misses Florida. I cant imagine what it must be like for her right now. She's the most distant, kayla too, even though shes a couple miles away i feel like she lives in another world. i miss her, i think i'll email her when im done writing.  I dont even want to get in to art moving because i'll start crying. I cant take it, what am i gonna do without him with me? AAAAh my throat!! Will it never end? Art is coming over later to carve pumpkins, i love halloween."

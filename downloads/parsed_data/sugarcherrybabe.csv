"event","who's allergic to everything?  I AM!

Seriously.  I finally had my allergy testing done on Monday.  There was an initial scratch test done my back.  It was 75 pricks/scratches.  Out of that, I didn't react to 12 things.  So based on that, I had to get another 29 pricks in my arms.  And it turns out I am allergic to practically every type of tree, weed and grass pollen in this area.  And because I tested mildly allergic to 9 out of 10 common food items, I have to go for a full food panel testing on January 13, 2009.  Here, I'll list everything I am allergic to.

SEVERE:  Trees -Mountain cedar, Cottonwood, American Elm, Mesquite, Mulberry, VG Live oak, Pecan, Birch.  Grass- Bahia, Bermuda, Brome, Johnson.  Weeds -Careless weed, Cocklebur, Prarie sage.  Molds Alternaria, Aspergillus.  Fire Ants, bees, wasps, american cockroach  and pork. 

MODERATE: Cat, cat pelt, dog, dust mites. And surgical steel.  

MILD:  Corn food, chicken, egg, fish, cow milk, peanut, soybean and whole wheat.

The food one surprised me but at least it is mild and nothing major.  That's good.  I really have to laugh about all this because otherwise, I am going to drive myself insane.  I literally went around saying ""Who's allergic to everything?  I AM!"" after my testing.  It was like my personal cheer for the day.  But the good things I get to go on allergy shots.  And I got like 6 new prescriptions which are actually making a difference.  For once, I can breathe out of my nose.  I'm impressed.  It's good to finally be able to breathe ouf my nose.  Really good.

The only other fun thing I did this week was to get my two front teeth capped.  That was a fun day at the dentist office.  It was kind of cool though.  The new technology stuff.  He made the crowns in the office while I was waiting and I walked out with my new, permanent teeth that day.  No two weeks with temporary crowns and then going back ... just bam!  new teeth in less than ten minutes per tooth (well for the machine to make them - total time was about 3 hours from start to finish).  So now I have a pretty new smile.  I guess.  Everyone keeps telling me the look great and that you can't even tell they aren't my real teeth.  I am sort of talking funny cuz I'm not used to them.  It's not like I didn't have teeth there ... but these new ones are a different size and shape and stuff so it's a little odd still.  I'm sure I'll get used to them soon.

Other than that, I really don't have a lot to report on my world.  Tomorrow is my special day with Erin.  She and I are going to spend the day doing special stuff - just her and I.  I think she's been feeling a little left out in the attention department (since Freya stayed home sick with me two days this week) so I am going to try and give her a special day and lot of just us time.  She's been really excited since Thursday morning when I told her we would have a special day together with no one else.  She even told me that she would sleep over at my house  LOL  That's a big thing for Erin.  I bet she would make it through the night just fine.  At least that's what Kim says.  lol"

"event","Well, I went for my sleep study last night.  They had a last minute cancellation and called me around 8:00 p.m. and asked if I could be there no later than 10:00 p.m.  Turns out, I do have sleep apnea.  I stop breathing 22 times per hour and wake myself up.  The doctor said I have moderate-severe sleep apnea.  She wrote me a prescription for a CPAP machine.  I should be getting my machine tomorrow.  She said after they put me on the CPAP machine, I slept very peacefully and didn't wake up at all.  I have my follow up appointment in four weeks to see how I am adjusting to the CPAP machine.  I also have my follow up with my ENT on February 6th at which I will bring up some more issues.  Like, when I woke up from the CPAP, I was the most congested I have ever been since I have been put on allergy meds.  And that's also after having taken my allergy med.

I spent a little bit too much money today but that's ok.  It was mainly for the animals and the house.  And getting the old apartment completely cleaned out.  Which was a good thing.  

I am missing my hubby very very very very much.  I got to talk to him a lot this weekend and I was hoping to have an email or something from him today but alas, no.  

My heatlhy life-style is going down the tubes.  I am not going to give up though.  I will get back on track with my eating habits.  I have managed to stick with my exercise but my eating has gone down the drain because everything has been so hectic and crazy.  Ugh.  I am not going to lose faith though.  I will not lose faith.  I will accomplish my goals and get back on track!"

"event","So today was good.  My friend's mom asked me yesterday if I would mind helping out around their shop when their daughter goes back to school next week.  Today was my first day and it was fun.  I think it turned out to be more of a therapy session than anything but it was great fun.  I'm gald they asked me to help out.  It gets me out of the house and gives me something to do every day.  It will also keep me from moping around.  The other great thing is that I can take Bella with me and she can spend the day outside, running around and playing.  She also gets to meet new people.  I think she had a good time today.  Except that she's farting a lot right now and it really really really stinks.

I'm still missing my hubby but there isn't much that I can do about him being gone.  I'm looking forward to the next time I get to hear from him.  =)

I have started planning my wedding.  I need to get the invites and the save the date cards printed up and sent out pretty quickly.  Or at least the save the date cards.  I'm looking at a December wedding.  Tonight, I need to decide on the invites and save the date cards and then think about the gift thing and how we're going to do that.  

I know that a bunch of people are in for a rude shock/awakening here pretty soon but you know what, it can't be helped.  Things haven't been ok for awhile and they're not getting any better or resolved.  And I have noticed that a couple of my friends are toxic and I just need to get away from them and start doing my own thing.  I've been saying that for years now and I keep making small little starts and stops in doing it, but now ... it's time to do it.  Enough of the talking - now it's time for the walking part.

All in all, so far my day has been rather good.  And the dog is now snoring.  Great."

"event","So today I got up.  I functioned.  I drove myself to my doctor's appointment.  I am supposed to have my tonsil taken out in the next couple of months but my ENT also wanted me to have a sleep study for sleep apnea.  I met with the extremely nice doctor this morning and we had about an hour long conversation regarding my sleeping habits, snoring, etc.  She says she's pretty sure I have sleep apnea just after examing my facial profile, throat, etc.  And she was able to explain to me what may be causing my sleep apnea.  I can now draw a little diagram that explains what is going on.  lol  I am scheduled for my sleep study on February 13.  I have to report to the hospital at 7:00 p.m.  When I wake up on the 14th, they better have a little Hershey's kiss or something waiting for me!  

I've been trying to keep busy all day but mainly I took a nap.  When I got done with the doctor's office, I stopped by Wallyworld (I can't wait until the Super Target is finished) and picked up my contacts, some shampoo and soap and then ... the best thing of all ... Planters Trail Mix.  I have been looking for this particular bag since August.  And I found it.  It's the Golden Nut Crunch one.  I love it.  And I read the back for what a serving size is and I measured out a coupel of servings and put them into individual containers and then hid the rest of the bag from myself.  It's 160 calories for 3 tablespoons.  But I love this stuff.  It has almonds, peanuts, cashews, peanut butter pieces, raisins, pretzels and sesame sticks in it.  And it's good.  And I'm not going to eat the whole bag in one sitting.  *nods head*

I need to get up and do something or play some games online or something ...  I have some movies I need to watch.  I managed to get my cardio in this morning before going to my doctor's appointment.  It was too early in the morning to be exercising, in my opinion."

And I've been really tired all day since we stayed up most of last night so that we could spend as much time together as possible.  I've done pretty good today with eating.  I only indulged in three pieces of chocolate.  I walked the dog twice more than I normally do on our long walking route.  I did exercise.  And I'm trying to curb my emotional eating by stuffing myself full of popcorn, fruit and vegetables.  I'm still really sad.  I kept crying because I didn't want him to leave and I'm so scared that our marriage will fall apart while he's gone.  I have so many insecurities and self-issues and I'm afraid I'm going to self destruct our marriage or that he's going to realize all this while he's gone and decide he wants a divorce or something.

I'm also worried about my friend S.  She's been having some issues as well lately and now her hubby is on TDY.  I'm worried about her as well. 

I also started telling people today that I'm  no longer going to put up with them stressing me out and forcing me to make choices I don't really want to make.  And that I am no longer going to put up with their attitudes.  It's been hard but I have managed to do it.  And some people are getting really angry with me but oh well.  I have to do what I have to do."

"event","So I was in the ER on Wed and Fri nights last week.  Due to horrible throat pain and congestion.  They put in a consult for me with the ENT.  I went to the ENT on Monday.  The ENT gave me three new meds.  And put in for a sleep study for me (sleep apnea or something like that).  And I have a follow up appointment in two weeks (day after Christmas) to see how my lymph nodes and tonsils are doing.  The good thing is that they will do everything possible to NOT take my tonsils out unless absolutely necessary.  I'm thinking at this point that I would rather  have them out then keep dealing with this stuff.  But depending on if I keep getting sore throats or how my sleep study goes, I may have to end up getting them taken out.  Which apparently is the most horrible pain you will ever have in your entire life, short of dying a horrible death.  At least, that is how I understand it.  Ugh.

On other news, Cris is right on track with doing his stuff to deploy to Korea.  he'll be leaving on the 8th of January (day after my birthday).  At 4:50 am.  Freaking early if you ask me.  I'm going to miss him sooooo much while he's gone.

"event","So I finally had my appointment with the foot doctor yesterday.  Apparently, I fractured a small bone under my left big toe (sesamoid).  And apparently, this itty bitty bone, that is now in two pieces, has been causing me all the problems with my foot the past four months.  The very nice doctor said that I most likely broke it from standing on my feet for a prolonged period of time (can we say that job I took for like a week - the one with the steel toe shoes I had to wear)?  So now I have to wear a surgical shoe for 4 - 6 weeks.  And I have an appointment on the 21st of this month to go get special inserts made for my shoes.  I have to wear those for 4 - 6 weeks as well.  If my foot still is giving me problems and my ankle area is still very tender, I have to go back and see what other options we have for fixing my foot.  Only I would break the smallest bone possible in my foot.  Only me.  Go figure.   

Other than that, things are going well.  For now.

What was I trying to say?  Oh yeah, I've been busy.  With very little time for myself.  Or anyone else.  The only reason I see Bri and Anthony is because that's my roommate and his girlfriend. Other than that, I haven't seen anyone.  That's going to change here shortly.

I'm going to start a weekly game night (either Saturday or Friday night).  Game night will consist of everyone being invited to come over and play games (bring the whole family and stuff).  Or we'll watch movies.  Or something.  Anyways, we'll play games.  And it's going to BYOB.  And probably bring like a small dish or something.  I'll definitely cook food for everyone to munch on but maybe bringing something small (like a bag of chips) would be a nice thing.  We'll have all kinds of games.  And it will be fun.  Much fun.

*********************************************************
""Let it go for 2007..

By T. D. Jakes

There are people who can walk away from you.

And hear me when I tell you this! When people can walk away from you: let them walk.  I don't want you to try to talk another person into staying with you, loving you, calling you, caring about you, coming to see you, staying attached to you.  I mean hang up the phone.

When people can walk away from you let them walk.
Your destiny is never tied to anybody that left.

People leave you because they are not joined to you.
And if they are not joined to you, you can't make them stay.

Let them go.


And it doesn't mean that they are a bad person it just
means that their part in the story is over. And you've got
to know when people's part in your story is over so 
that you don't keep trying to raise the dead.

You've got to know when it's dead.

You've got to know when it's over. Let me tell you
something. I've got the gift of good-bye. It's the tenth spiritual gift, 
I believe in good-bye. It's not that I'm hateful, it's that I'm
faithful. And if it takes too much sweat I don't need it. Stop begging people to stay.

Let them go!!

If you are holding on 
to something that doesn't belong
to you and was never intended for your life, then you need to......

LET IT GO!!!

If you are holding on to past hurts and pains .....

LET IT GO!!!

If someone can't treat you right, love you back, and see your worth.....

LET IT GO!!!

If someone has angered you ........

LET IT GO!!!

If you are holding on to some thoughts of evil and revenge......

LET IT GO!!!

If you are involved in a wrong relationship or addiction......

LET IT GO!!!

If you are holding on to a job that no longer meets your needs or talents ...

LET IT GO!!!

If you have a bad attitude!.......

LET IT GO!!!

If you keep judging others to make yourself feel better......

LET IT GO!!!



If you are struggling with the 
healing of a broken
relationship.......

LET IT GO!!!

If you keep trying to help someone who won't even try
to help themselves......

LET IT GO!!!

If you're feeling depressed and stressed ........

LET IT GO!!!

Let the past be the past. Forget the 
former things."

So the things I learned this past year ...

I can make it through things without my mom.  Today is the one year anniversary of her passing and oh yes, it's been time for reflection.  I've learned that I can make it through more death without my mom (I lost my father, stepfather, grandfather, uncle and two friends this year as well -- one of my friends just the other night -- I think I am numb to death).  I have great, wonderful friends and I really did learn exactly who and who is not a friend, what a friend means to me, and how to be a better friend and person to those in my life.  I have never been one to place much on materialistic objects, but the point of it really isn't about materialistic objects has hit home even more.  I've learned to treasure all the little moments because I don't know when, or if, I will get to have them again (or with that person). I've learned that I can still have my heart broken, my feelings stomped on, and go through things I don't like without having the rock of my mom there to cocoon me.  I learned that I can still give everything I have to people and it's ok if they don't understand it.   

And I'm prepared for tomorrow night to happen and for the second time, my mom not being the first person to call or text me at midnight wishing me a happy new year.  Somehow, I will manage.  And I am prepared for when next Sunday rolls around and she won't be the first person to call me on my birthday (either right after midnight or an ungodly hour in the morning) and wish me a happy birthday.  

These are the things I learned in the past year."

It's something that I have been struggling with as far as decisions go and I was having a hard time trying to find the right Christmas gift for her, when she called me up to talk.  We talked about some of the things going on in her life and it just seemed like the right thing.  Needless to say, due to some medical problems, she won't be able to have children or carry them to term.  Her and husband would like nothing more than to have a child of their own, so here I come in to help.  She's always been there for me and such a great friend and I just wanted to do something for her to show her how much I have appreciated her friendship over all these years.  I'm still scared of doing this but I can't think of a better thing for me to do to help her.  I think we both ended up crying a lot on the phone this weekend.  =)  I feel right about this.  

On the other hand, I am tired of everybody's drama and stupidity.  It's getting old and annoying.  And one other thing, just because I am nice to you and your friend, doesn't mean you have to be attached to my hip.  Make your own friends and let me live my life with my friends. While, I don't mind including my friends in on my plans, there are some of my friends who seem to think that they should be included in everything I do.  And I mean everything.  I can't get a moment of peace to myself.  And if I don't respond to your text messages or phone calls right away, it's probably because I am busy or have plans.  It doesn't mean I am mad at you or that you did something wrong.  Grow up guys and girls.  My life does not revolve around anyone but me.  And my time is my time, not everyone else's.  And another thing, some of my friends keep volunteering me for stuff WITHOUT asking me beforehand.  This really needs to stop.  I am not your second date/blind date, I am not going along with you on everything you do just because, and I am not a toy!  Don't volunteer my time or make a committment for me without asking me.

speaking of kitty, she is driving me insane.  the little bugger has now decided that instead of normally sleeping beside my feet, or at the foot of the bed, she is now going to sleep on me, be it my feet or legs or back.  i liked it a lot better the other way.  she and i are going to have a talk about this new behavior of hers.

today i think i shall cook and bake.  seems like the thing to do."

"event","So as I wrote in a previous entry (lobster day), I had another allergic reaction last night.  This whole not knowing what is causing these reactions things is driving me nuts.  I am not used to this at all.  The only thing that has registered on the allergy testing so far is PORK.  So, all pork products we avoid ... unless I have taken my allergy medicine.  And last night, I didn't eat pork.  I had chicken, mashed potatoes, corn, fried squash and cornbread.  All foods I have eaten or cooked before.  And it started the same way too.  First my hands started itching, then my neck and chest and then my feet.  Then I started turning pink and then red.  And then off to the ER we went. And all they did at the ER is give me a shot and a pill and then the same ""follow up with your doctor"" speech.  I still have some allergy testing to go because my doctor wants me tested for everything since we cna't really figure out what is causing this to happen.  The only new thing about last night was that I felt like I was on fire.  I hate all this shit.  It's driving me insane.  I can't go around looking like a freaking lobster for crying out loud.  If I have another one anytime soon, I am going to just shoot myself and put myself out of my misery.  

On other fronts, things are looking up.  A little bit at a time.

I am sure I will have more to say later."

bleeding and weeping in my hands, my head hangs low

********************************************

I don't think people really understand what they do to each other.  I know that I'm not the most perfect person in the world but I try to treat others right. I realize a lot of the time, it comes out all fucked up but I do things with the best of intentions.  I know that my true friends are always there for me and get me but those people are few and far between and most of them don't live anywhere near me anymore.  I miss them bunches. Le Sigh.

I am going to visit my  bestest friend in the whole wide world at the end of this month and I can't freaking wait.  I have already started counting down the days.  It's going to be freaking awesome.  At first, I was terrified to be going for a visit but now .... heeeheee I am so excited I can hardly stay still.  Much havoc shall ensue.  I am going to come back a totally different person as I will be getting my head screwed back on straight.  I can't wait.  Somewhere along the way, I lost sight of something and I know that my bestest friend will help me gain that sight again (that's what friends are for).

All this moving and stuff has stressed me the fuck out but I think I have a handle on it now.  I had a great talk with some people at work today and things are on track for what I want to happen.  Stuff just really got to me yesterday and I was all freaked out in my own world but now, it's all good."

"event","He's gone.  He left.  He's been gone for three days now.  He had to go get his weapon at 8pm on Sept 30th (last Saturday night) and his flight left at 3:00 am on Sunday morning.  So technically, he's been gone since October 1st but to me it will be since the 30th.  I did get to spend some time with him.  We had dinner together and spent most of the afternoon and evening together, talking and stuff.  I feel like my heart has broken into two and that it's the end of the world.  I know that it isn't but it still feels that way.  I forced myself to go to work on Sunday and Monday which was good because it kept me busy and kept my mind not thinking about things.  Today is my day off but I spent it with Bri and her friend Jenny doing some shopping stuff for the FRG Halloween party.  We have spent most of the day shopping and keeping busy with appointments, again a good thing because it doesn't allow me time to think about anything too much for too long.  I am trying to hold on to the fact that he said he doesn't want things to end and he won't forget me and he will keep in touch with me and talk to me.  I broke down in front of him and I cried my eyes out and told that I can't help the way that I feel but that I just don't want things to end between us, either as friends or as boyfriend/girlfriend/relationship-what-have-you and he said he didn't want it to either and that friends like me are hard to come by and rare and he wouldn't forget me (yes, I am repeating myself) and that he was just deploying, it wasn't the end.  I told him he's always been so good to me and treated me so well and that I just can't help it.  I can't change how I feel.  I can't.  We have been together for a year now and now he's gone.  Part of the reason why I feel like it's just the end is because of all the people I have lost in the past year and a half.  And partly because we haven't really gotten to spend very much time together in the past few months.  He did apologize for that (said he was sorry that he hadn't gotten to spend more time with me and that work had kept him so busy).  I wish I had gotten to spend more time with him.  I wish I had been more forceful about him including me on things but I don't know if that would have been wise.  He said he would call me as soon as he got there and let me know he got there ok.  I will hopefully get to talk to him for a few minutes then.  I miss him already.

As for work, well this new training program is coming along.  We only spend four hours a day on the phones.  We have an hour of training in the morning and then we spend four hours on the phones and then go to lunch and come back and spend three more hours in training.  I think I finally understand what they are wanting and hopefully can prove them wrong about things.  It's been a bit of a struggle but I am sure it will all work out in the end.  

My family is driving me nuts but that is pretty normal.  They tend to do that a lot.  My aunt says she hates to see me hurting like this but she doesn't know what to say or do to help me feel better.  Everyone else keeps telling me to either cry or not to cry or something else and I appreciate all their concern and care but I can't even begin to address how I am feeling.  It just hurts.  And I miss him.  And I want to be as supportive as I can to him and still be a good friend and hopefully remain his girlfriend.  Only time will tell."

"event","Today is now known as the Lobster Day.

The day started off allright.  I woke up with a huge headache and wandered into my friends room and was talking with her husband.  We just kind of watched some movies and I wandered back off to find some Motrin.  I found some and took two to help with my headache.  I sat down on the couch and started watching some TV.  I was getting hungry so I heated up some pizza from last night on ly this was the ham and cheese pizza.  I ate my two slices and went back to watching TV.  About half an hour later, I noticed my friend was up so we started talking.  I was talking about some stuff at work that was going and my palms were really itching.  I kept making a comment on it and she was like it's just stress, calm down, it iwll go away.  And by this time, I start to breathe funny.  I was trying to listen to her and I got the stuff to clean the bathtub and thought, well I will go clean the tub and then take a bath.  I walked into the bathroom and looked into the mirror and I was BRIGHT red around my neck.  And now, I wasn't only itching on my hands, but my feet and scalp as well.  So I panicked and walked back to her room and showed her my red neck.  We were debating going to the ER and I was like well let me take a bath and see if that helps.  No, the bath didn't help.  I just sat there trying to bath and not panic as the redness started spreading and I started developing hives.  Oh yes, I was having a full blown allergic reaction to something ... only problem is, I wasn't sure what.  So I get of the bath, having a full blown panic attack and tell her I think we need to head to the ER.  And off we went.  I looked like a LOBSTER!  I was horribly red and swelling and itchy from head to toe.  And the ER people didn't make me any less panicked because after they took my vitals, they were rushing to get me into a room because I was at 100% saturation to whatever it was causing this.  The nurse and doctor were really nice though and got me calmed down pretty quickly.  They gave me some kind of steriod shot and some Benadryl to help with all the itching and redness.  And of course, they couldn't pinpoint exactly what caused my severe allergic reaction and the only thing we could come up with was ... blame it on the pizza.  So now I am supposed to avoid anything that can cause this to happen again but I don't know what the could be.  And they gave me a prescription fcr Prednisone ( I think I spelled that wrong) and then told me to buy some Benadryl and to take it easy for the next couple of days and to follow up with my PCP on Monday and get the process started for me to have a FULL allergy work up to pinpoint what could have caused this.  When they discharged me, I was only pinkish and not itching as much but still at 100% saturation.  I asm still kind of pink splotchy but I don't itch as much.  And the fever has gone down.  My arm is killing me from where they gave me the shot but that will go away.  So now I am just taking it easy.  And hoping my pink splotches will go away.  

So that is why today is now known as Lobster Day."

"event","so a bunch of folks have been wondering why i have been so quiet lately.

some of it has to do with work.  

some of it has to do with trying to not be so judgemental of other people.

some of it has to do with not letting other people influence me or affect the way i think and act.

for the most part, these are the conclusions i have come to:

when you ignore and neglect your children, unless you happen to want to give them attention, i have no sympathy for you.  when you ignore your animals and don't bother to make sure they have adequate food or water, nor do you pay attention to them, i have no sympathy for you.  when you start ignoring everyone in your life because of your lastest boyfriend/girlfriend, i have no sympathy for you.  when you lie, manipulate, steal, cheat and do other things i would consider morally wrong, i have no sympathy for you.  when even your own friends, who have none you for most of your life, say the only reason they don't talk to you about the things you are doing because it's not their place or because they know it's wrong/bad for you/harmful, etc. and still won't say anything, i have no sympathy for you.  when you treat every one in a two-faced manner (mostly just to manipulate them), i have no sympathy for you.  when you can't even tell the truth to your own self, i have no sympathy for you.  when you blow all your money on going to bars and drinking and things that you don't need but want and then can't afford to pay for anything yourself, i have no sympathy for you.

i know that i'm not perfect and i have many flaws but i try not to act or behave in such ways that i would consider wrong or be ashamed of.  and while some of the people i know are good, decent people, i have noticed that most everyone seems to be falling into some sort of trap lately.  i can only say, that for myself, i have been under considerable stress and while it would be easy to start behaving in a manner that i would consider reprehensible, i strive not to.  

on the other hand, i could see why people under stress would find it easier to behave in such manners rather than to try and better their situations.  and then it gets easier to keep blaming everything on everyone else rather than admit you made mistakes and fucked up.  but that is the stuff i am trying to stay away from and not fall in to.  

other than those things, work has been keeping me really busy.  i like the job and have lots of fun while there.  things are looking up.  my numbers are improving considerably and i think i feel more comfortable pushing the things they want me to.

everyone take care and stay safe."

So I sat with another person and first I had to wait for him to finish his chat message with a buyer.  Then he logged into the phones and I sat there waiting 30 minutes for a call.  Mainly because he was logged into the premium queue and not the super queue.  The premium queue gets less calls for some reason.  But I did make a sale and all.  Which is good.  I am getting tired of the training class because at this point all they are doing is repeating stuff over and over again.  I know that most people have to be taught like that but to me, it's getting rather boring rather quickly.  I have to keep reminding myself only three more days ... just three more days of this.  

I had dinner with Link last night.  It was a nice dinner.  It was nice to spend some time with him.  He took me out for icecream (because I wanted some =P).

I made a 100% on my mid-term assessment at my job today.  Go me.  Today was also our first day on the phones with a mentor.  Last week, we just watched.  Today we were taking calls.  It was ok.  My partner made a sale.  I almost made a sale.  My mentor felt bad because it wasn't in my control and I would have made the sale if the guy hadn't been just jerking us along.  I got through the whole call and was ready to take his payment and then he asked if he could overnight a check or money order because he had cash in his hand but hadn't made it to the bank yet.  UGH  However ... the mentor and trainers were willing to count it as a sale because I had asked him several times how he was going to pay and he said debit card and never indicated anything else until it was time to pay.  Oh well.  My mentor said I did very well on the phone today and there were only minor things to improve.  Overall, I am pleased with myself. 

I am still torn over several things in my life right now.  I am trying to make adjustments where they need to be made and trying to be more understanding in other areas.  However, I feel as if I am not doing this very well at all.

However, I am tired of my family calling me chubby, fat, pathetic, overweight, and so forth.  So ... I'm exercising.  I started three weeks ago with sit ups (50 a day, each week I have increased by increments of 10 ... so now I am 70 a day) and push-ups (started with 20 a day, increase each week by increments of 10--I have little upper body strength).  I have now added yoga every morning (30 minutes), walking two miles a day and then a dance session for 30 to 45 minutes a day (well at least five days a week on the exercise -- every day for sit ups and push-ups).  You would think I would be losing some weight ...  but alas, only two pounds so far.  I think I might have lost a couple of inches over all ... but not too sure on that.  

All because I have a hard time controlling my eating.  My eating habits are poor (not food choice wise, just amounts and times per day).  I am weak when it comes to food.  I LOVE FOOD.  And not just unhealthy junk food ... but real food (like vegetables, fruits, breads and pastas).  

So my goal for the next two weeks ... watch my food.  I have been keeping a food journal for over a year now ...  but I don't think that is helping me as much as it should.  LOL.

In other news ... I have the best sweetie in the world.  Like I don't say that enough.  And we had great sex this weekend.  And he's listened to me every day this week.  Thankfully.  And he was right.  I should learn my lessons.  He's right about a lot of things (though I don't want to tell him that too much -- he might get a big head)."

I started my day with pampering.  This entailed recieving a one hour full body massage and a 30 minute foot spa.  To be followed up by another one hour full body massage and a 80 minute facial rejuvenation massage (hehe ... 80 minute head massage ... I am so gonna be in heaven).  That's scheduled for the 25th (as the boy will be visiting his mom in Nashville for his birthday and picking up his dog).  *shakes head in amazement*  And when I go on the 25th, I am supposed to schedule a massage for March.  So I put on my super uber hot sexy red dress (more like a maroonish color) and got all prettified for him.  And went over to his place to like he told me too.  He dressed up ..... in an extremely hot and sexy charcoal gray suit.  OMG he looked hot.  He took me to dinner at Little Italy and then we went to my friend's erotic art show, the Art of Love.  =D  I got to kiss a canvas saying I had been there  =P  My lip print is now a piece of art lmao  And and  ... OMG ... while we were waiting to be seated, we were chatting about stuff and he's getting a puppy .  It's a present to himself, but as we were chatting he mentioned adopting the puppy from the shelter that we saw this past weekend and then he did the sly little ... ""Well, I'll be needing help with him of course and I was just wondering if you'd be willing to help me out with the puppy.""  *geeky happiness*  And of course, we had uber hot sex last night.  =P  I think I woke up the whole household.  Oh well ... 

I feel like a dork because all I got him was the frog and custom printed m-ms.  Not that the m-ms aren't a cute idea ... but I feel lke a huge dork.  That's ok because his birthday is March 1st and I can make it up to him then.  :D

Nick gave me some homemade chocolates that are very very yummy.  I like them.  I think I ate way too many of them at work yesterday.  LOL

I think I actually uttered the words ""Holy Shit"" when the lady was showing him to me.  I thought they remained relatively small.  However, she said the larger one would be better in his tank.  =)  Tonight I plan on wearing a hot, sexy dress for him.  Just because I can.  =P

I have more stuff to say but I will write more about that later.  I just had to say something about my wonderful boyfriend who is the best boyfriend ever (besides the fact that he gives me outstanding sex  :P)."

"event","Something wierd happened last night.  Link and I were in bed going to sleep.  Ok, he was already asleep and out cold.  I was starting to doze off and all of the sudden he starts talking.  So I asked what he said and he repeated it.  And then keeps talking, as if he is talking to someone.  Only thing is, he was flirting with someone and hitting on them and the stuff he was saying wasn't about me.  The attributes of the other person definetly were not mine.  It really freaked me out.  I got up and started putting on my clothes and everything to go home because it freaked me out so badly.  I wasn't mad at him or anything, I was just freaked out.  I didn't know how to take it or what to do.  It was just odd.  I started to calm down and I climbed back into bed and all.  I didn't want to tell him what was going on or what happened or what was said because I knew I was freaking out.  I was just like I want to go home and sleep and pretend it didn't happen when I wake up, etc.  I just want to let it go and forget about it.  Which is why I ended up crawling back in bed.  He goes out to turn up the heat and then comes back to bed but sleeps on TOP of the blankets and everything.  Which made me feel even worse.  I couldn't sleep because of it.  I had crawled back in to bed and so forth so I couldn't understand why he was so determined to sleep on top of the blankets and sheets.  I wanted to scream at him ""I'm not your ex-wife and just because I am upset doesn't mean I am mad and you have to sleep like that and distance yourself from me and I've already told you I don't want to tell you what was said, I just want to let it go!  That means I want to let it go and I'm just freaked out, nothing against you!""  Well the whole point of me saying I wanted to let it go was because I didn't want to freak out or overreact on the whole thing.  I was trying to NOT do that and I knew I had already fucked up by trying to leave ... which is why I was trying to calm down and just keep telling him I didn't want to get into it, I just wanted to let it go.  The whole sleeping on top of the sheets thing bothered me because I don't want to treat him how his ex-wife did and now I feel horrible because I obviously did so.  I finally muttered something about like Fine, I give up because I just couldn't handle it.  I told him this morning what had happened and apologized for freaking out and all.  I still don't want to tell him exactly what was said because I just want to let it go and pretend nothing happened and that I don't have anything to worry about and that it was all just sleep talk.  He apologized and said he doesn't even know or remember what he was dreaming about (He also said that last night when I kept telling him I just wanted to let it go and not talk about it).  So I'm letting it go.  I know he's not seeing anyone else.  I know he cares about me.  I am not going to worry about anything (like that he's out there trying to find someone else or that he  doesn't want to be with me anymore) ... which is why I want to let it go.  If I dwell on this, I am going to overreact and do something horrible and I don't want to do that.  So I'm letting it go.  If it happens again, then I will worry about it.  And I'm beating myself up over the whole thing because A) I don't want to treat him like his ex-wife did and obviously I am (so I need to change that NOW) and B) I have been rather mean to him lately and pushing him away .. so if he was looking for someone else, I can't really blame him and it's mainly my fault.  So since I don't want those things to happen, I must make changes.  And not later but now.  

Again to recap ... letting it go.  I will not be freaked out by this.  I will not dwell on this.  It is now over and done with and nothing more to it.  Letting it go.

I hugn out with some friends last night.  Went to dinner and went shopping.  I'm stressing over this whole shopping thing.  I can't get a gift that is too mushy or anything.  But I don't want to get just a generic, over-the-counter gift.  I want to get something that is nice but not too much at the same time.  *bangs head on  desk*  I am not expecting anything in return or anything like that ... I'm just a gift person and I love every chance I get to give stuff to people.  So holidays are totally my thing.  However, I don't want to screw it up or put too much stress on it.  I feel like I already made a mistake by mentioning that I had gotten something for him a week ago.  I feel like I shouldn't have mentioned it or gotten anything and all that jazz.  He hasn't made me feel that way ... I'm putting all this stress on myself and probably unnecessarily so.  Lol.  Par for the course for me.  But in our shopping excursion, I did find two things that would make a nice gifty type thing.  I will probably go back and get one of them tomorrow or this weekend.

I never did hear back from that guy about that job.  I am guessing he hired someone else.  Oh well.  That is life.  I am sure something else will work out for me.  Hopefully.  I have a few more places left to apply to.

I think tonight I am just going to stay at home and watch movies or something.  And try not to think to hard.  I've gotten to the point where I don't want to talk about what's going on with me to anyone because I don't want anyone telling me what I should do and how I should be feeling, etc.  As for what started bothering me yesterday ... I think I am ready to talk about it now.  I wasn't last night.  I just wanted the comfort aspect without the talking."

I hate feeling like this.  It's rather icky.  I kept apologizing to Link yesterday and the day before because I felt so bad about feeling bad and not being to do as much as I wanted to.  Which got me a smack on the hand.  lol"

"event","I can't eat.  For the past week or so, whenever I eat, my stomach gets upset and I feel like I have to go upchuck.  And it's not like I am even trying to eat a huge amount.  For example, I brought a Lean Cuisine frozen thing for lunch today.  Those don't have a huge amount of food in them.  However, I barely got through half of it before I felt like I was going to upchuck.  Of course, I ""forced"" myself to eat the rest of it because I know that eating so little isn't healthy for me.  And I am not really getting hungry either.  Well kind of.  But not like normal.  I tried to make sure I ate enough around Link this weekend.  Tried to.  But I just can't eat.  It upsets my stomach lately.  Ugh.  I hate this.  I know my stomach does wierd things like this ... but not like what it is doing now.  Maybe I should lecture it.

So I made it into work.  Of course.  I feel like crap but I am here.  I am thinking I might need to leave early.  I have an interview at 5pm.  The guy called not too long ago and said he would email me the directions, etc.  Apparently he had hired someone (I never interviewed at all) and that person didn't work out so now he is looking again.  Good to know I'm like a last choice.  However, I am glad that I am being called.  I do want to have a better job or at least a better paying job.  That would be nice.  I have to rush home and change clothes and bring a copy of the phone numbers and addresses to my previous employers.  This I can do.  lol

I am also going to pick/turn in some applications at the mall tonight.  I need to do that as well.  Go pick them up and then maybe turn them in tomorrow morning.  This will help as well.  I wasn't able to get a copy of the Sunday paper or the classifieds from it.  The workforce website and local papers daily listings is what I am going off of this week.  Hopefully something will turn up.

I am still in so much pain.  Working isn't helping.  The constant up and down, walking around, helping people and so forth is just making it worse.  I feel a long hot bath coming on tonight.

Sometimes, I think I am too nice of a person.  I think I should stop being nice.  I think maybe I should just be nice to the few that I think deserve it and then with everyone else, be noncommittal.  It's not that I don't like the people in my life, it's more that I don't want to put up with their bullshit anymore.  I can accept everyone for who they are, flaws and all (except for myself) however, that doesn't mean that I should just let them have free reign in my life.  Or allow them to have so much influence in my life.

And that is all for now.  More later.  Maybe."

"event","I haven't been feeling well.  I can barely walk still.  Walking, standing, doing pretty much anything for any extended amount of time is taking a lot out of me. I think  I have pretty much spent since Friday in bed and only gotten out of bed when I absolutely had to.  I'm still hurting today even.  All I want to do is lay down and rest however, that isn't possible.  I have to work today whether I am up to it or not.  This shall be interesting.

I am supposed to go home to Baltimore in March.  My cousin is getting married (Dad's side of the family) and my Aunt is insisting I attend and is very excited about me coming home.  I am dreading it.  The closer it gets to going home, the worse I don't want to go.  Go figure.  There is one main reason why I don't want to go and this past week it has been on my mind heavily and while I should talk about it and get it out, I don't want to nor do I feel I am ready to.  And with my Aunt constantly calling me, it makes it stick out more in my mind.  Instead of it being something I am trying to move on from, it's being forced into focus.  All I do know is that going home is going to destroy me and I probably won't make the trip back to normalcy for a long time.  It's going to be as bad as if I had gone home and spent time with my stepfather.  

Speaking of said stepfather, he did destory me the other day.  And I took it out on Link.  I was extremely nasty and mean.  I have to stop doing this.  It's not healthy for me and it's definetly not nice or healthy for Link.  I'm so lucky to have him in my life and have such a wonderful friend like him.  I've been taking a lot of my stress out on Link and I shouldn't.  I don't have any excuses for myself.  I know it's wrong and I know I need to stop.  I am not going back to the shrink because I feel he's no help in this matter.  The shrink just told me this is pretty much normal and a part of grieving and so forth.  He didn't understand, or didn't listen to me, when I kept telling him I do this all the time when I get stressed out and I need to learn some stress techniques.  Dumb shrink.  But oh well .... I guess I'll have to go it my own.

Well ... I have to head to work now.  I am sure I will write more later."

If you feel something is personally directed at you, it's not.  Unless it says your name specifically or says it is directed at someone.  If you feel this is directed at you, then please look inside yourself as to why you feel that way.  All I can say is that it isn't and I'm trying to work out stuff in my head.  Thank you and good night.  LOL.

Ahhh ... so I've been up since 6 something this morning.  I kind of slept last night.  I took two sleeping pills and it somewhat helped ... somewhat.  I still had the nightmares and all but I did sleep for more than two hours.  I slept for three and a half hours.  LOL.  I think tonight I'll try taking three sleeping pills and see if that works.  I took Aislyn over to Cathy's and then came back and tried to sleep some more but I only got two cat naps of about 3o minutes each.  So that's another hour added to my three and a half hours then.  Maybe three sleeping pills will do the charm.  Who knows.  We shall see.  And it's not like I am not tired or anything.  I'm freaking exhausted and still can't sleep.  However, I feel much better today than I have the past couple of days.  More sleep.   It's mainly the nightmares that keep me from sleeping.  Stress too because it makes it harder for me to shut down my mind and the less sleep I get, the harder it is to shut down my mind.  But the nightmares are killer.  They really keep me from going to sleep. 

I have so much on my mind.  LOL.  I am taking the loss of my moms harder than I thought I would.  On the outside, I appear to be ok with things but on the inside I am wailing and screaming and crying.  When I am overly exhausted, it all comes out in terrible ways.  Which sucks sometimes.  I keep beating myself up over every little thing.  It's not healthy, yes, I know.  The shrink isn't helping much lately either because he just keeps saying it's all part of grieving and I will get past it and what not.  Yeah buddy, I doubt it as I have been like this for a long time.  That and all the little stresses that I can normally tolerate are now just past the exploding point.  I realize now that I don't have to deal with many of these stresses but that I just have been and now I don't want to anymore.  They're not really my problems nor concerns.  I shouldn't let them be stressing me out.  I should be completely focusing on what I need to do, what I want to do and then just forget about all these extraneous stressors.  hard to do sometimes, but I am trying to get better.  

I hate taking baby steps in things.  I hate taking big steps too.  LOL.  Sometimes I feel like I don't get enough recognition for the steps and improvements I am taking, no matter how little or small and it makes me wonder why I should keep making the improvements.  Especially if I am the only one bothering to do them or notice them.  I'm not always just making these improvements or taking steps just for myself.  Sometimes I am doing them in order to improve the relationships I have with the people in my life.  I realize that these are things that will stay with me and help me in future relationships with future peoples in my life, not just the current people in my life, and that it is important to do these things.  However, I feel as if most of these people are the ones telling me about taking these steps and so forth and they can't recognize them, then maybe they are full of hot air.  Either that or it goes back to how whenever you start to improve yourself, you find out who your true friends really are because they won't try and hold you down.  They encourage you every step of the way.

I have come to notice that all of the people in my life, if not most everyone, talks around me.  It's like I am invisible.  I don't mind it all that much because lots of time I get very valuable information that way.  But at the same time, there are a few people in my life who do it and it does bother me.  It makes me feel like I'm not a part of their life or really their friend and I'm wanting to be a part of their life and their friend.  However, I also realize that the people that it is bothering me the most about right now, also are dealing with some of their own things and issues.  And all I can do is just sit on the sidelines and wait for them to work it out.  I can't help them nor am I going to force them to deal with their issues (and I know one person right now who is probably reading this and thinking it is directed at them -- no it's not, we've already discussed this and we're good).  But at the same time, I am also not always going to be there waiting for them to realize I am their friend and trying to be supportive of them.  They're going to wake up one day and realize that I am not as close to them nor am I really ""there"" for them in the sense that I used to be.  Not say I won't be there, I will, but it won't be in the same way as now. 

I'm also really getting sick of people complaining to me about their problems and not doing anything about them.  What makes me more upset is that I realized I was beginning to do this and it pisses me off.  I am now consciously reminding myself not to do this and to proactively start doing something about it.  Hence, some people have started to notice that I am being even more direct and blunt than normal.  This isn't meant to piss anyone off or be rude.  It is meant to help me.  I cannot solve everyone's problems or be there for them if I don't start taking care of myself again.  I know what my issues are right now and I am trying to get them resolved.  All I can do say I love my friends and care about them and will try to be the best friend to them that I can but I also have to start taking care of myself again.

I know that everyone keeps telling me that I am strong and can get through anything, blah blah blah.  I know this is true but for awhile there I really hated hearing it.  Now I don't mind as much because while I lost sight of my own inner strength for awhile there, I realized last night that I have an incredible inner strength and resolve and I really need rely on that more than just not wanting to deal with things.  There are two people in my life right now that have really helped that more than anyone else because no matter what, they always listen to me whenever I have something to say.  Which is the best thing anyone can do for me because I don't need advice or anything.  When I'm just talking about all the crap I'm dealing with or fustrated with or what not ... that's all I need to do.  Just talk it out.  The talking it out helps me figure out in my mind how I am going to about dealing/handling it.  May not seem like it when I am talking, but it does.  So to those two people, thank you very much.  I do appreciate it, even if I don't show it.  You don't have to worry about trying to do more for me ... it's enough that you listen.

I did manage to eat breakfast again this morning.  Even had my cup of juice with it.  LOL.  I don't see this becoming a pattern though.  *evil grin*  I did have a mid-morning snack of fat free pudding again and some croutons.  I really wanted the croutons.  I brought a diet thing to eat for lunch today but I haven't made it yet.  Probably will make it here in a little bit as my tummy is getting rumbly.  Last night I did really well.  I had a huge salad and a vegetarian wrap for dinner.  And a fat free pudding cup for dessert.  LOL.  Today is another great day of eating as well.  Well except for the croutons really.  I have managed to work out every day so far this week.  I am proud of myself.  I make myself do it, even if I don't feel like it.  Hopefully this will all pay off in the long run.  I don't want someone to get all hot looking and then leave me because I don't look hot either.  That would suck donkey balls.  Really it would.  Well that and I know they're trying to lose some weight too so I figure I can try and be supportive and try to lose some weight myself.  And eat right.  And exercise.  My thing really is the exercising and portion control.  It's not that I eat badly ... I eat too much.  And I don't like to exercise.  Except for when I feel like I should ... which isn'ta ll that often.  Then again, my losing weight just might motivate the other person too.  LOL.  Who knows.  I've only be half-heartedly trying to do this and now I really need to step up to the plate and do it.  I have to get the right mind set again.  LOL.

My stepdad and I have been talking twice a day now since this Sunday.  He calls me during lunch time and we chat for a few minutes and then I call him back in the evenings and we chat for a few more minutes.  I am trying to not push anything and just take it for what it is right now and not think too much into it.  Hard for me to do.  Heck, I'm trying to do that with someone else right now and it's not working at all.  But I'll write more about that in a second.  My aunt and I are also talking about once a day now as well.  This is helping me.  A little bit each time.  There is someone else who has been trying to keep in contact with me/get in touch with me again but I honestly don't want to have anything to do with him.  I want my apology and that's it.  Until I get the apology -- go fuck yourself.

As for trying to take things as they come with this other person ... sometimes it is hard for me.  Sometimes I get scared.  I don't like that feeling.  It's easier for me to turn that into anger and deal with it that way than to face the fact that I am scared.  Other times, I am afraid I have more feelings and care invested into this than the other person does and I hate that too.  I don't want to be too clingly or needy or more giving, caring,  what have you.  I know they care for me too and they tell me this.  But at the same time, the realist view contradicts that.  It's the contradictions that kill me.  I'm the type of person that if I do care, even if the reality of things doesn't have that great of an outlook, I will do whatever I can, or suck things up, just to have the caring there.  But that's just me.  I am will accept this person on whatever terms they want.  I do mean that.  I know it doesn't seem that way a lot of the times, but I do mean it.  I can always try to improve the realist outlook and situation of things on my own part and still find a way to make the caring part work too.  Again, that's just me.  I believe in fighting for what and who I want in my life, not just accepting the realist view because you can always change the outlook on something by taking proactive actions.  And that is what I am trying to do.  Ugh ... all that just sounded confusing.  lol.   And I should now comment that this isn't directed at one person ... I realize it started out like that but as I sit here and type it and think about it ... it's really directed at a lot of people right now.  It's not just one person, but others.  I realize that I often feel like I have more caring invested in people than they have in me.  I think that is at the core of what's bugging me about all this.  So that means I take it out on one person instead of everyone ... and that's just wrong.

And just one final thing ....

Sometimes I don't tell people what is bothering me or what is on my mind because I feel like once I say it, it puts up a huge wall between myself and that person and that no matter who says what or does what, the wall will not be coming down.  It's like by speaking my mind, I have committed some offense of some sort and there is no fixing it.  I hate that.  I always end up feeling like I messed things up and that I shouldn't have said anything in the first place and I should have just kept my damn mouth shut and my thoughts to myself.  I did this last night but honestly, I wasn't bothered by what had happened ... I was tired and I thought I was making a polite joke/poking fun at it and I wasn't.  My mean tone of voice was being used and I was yelling and didn't realize it.  I honestly didn't mean to yell and I wasn't upset by it anymore.  I did think I was poking fun at it and trying to make  a joke out of the whole thing.  The reason I wasn't upset anymore because I just finally told myself that either the person will be there or they won't.  They will either be my friend or not and there isn't I can do anything about it.  All I can say is ... yeah, I've fucked up quite a bit and I'm sorry about that.  I want you to be in my life so I will try and do something about it and not fuck up anymore.  And that goes in general to just about everyone I know right now.  Not trying to single anyone out, even though it seems that way.  I was just using last night as an example.

Ok, I think have rambled on enough for now.  I feel a bit better.  I tried to work out what was in my head and this helped.  Somewhat.  LOL.  Please don't think this is directed at anyone personally as it isn't.  I may use examples of things/situations that have happened but it's not to direct personally, it's just an example type of thing.

Later everyone."

Of which I never was a part
It was a magical day
Of which I'd never seen before

The first time I saw colossal girl
The first time I saw colossal girl

Such glowing mountains before us
Pillars of life all fade away
Of all the things I need to say girl
All of these words are in my way

The first time I saw colossal girl

Well she's running to the hills again
Can you tell me if she'll ever return
She must be mother natures child
Cause she's runnin' to the call of the wild
She's talkin' to the trees again
Tellin' me that she's one of them
Lookin' at the bird in the tree
Though she's never gonna notice me

Oh is my love a confession
Will I just put it back today
If I had love left to give you
Would you still throw it away

Can you remember the first time we met
Living together in colossal times
Some things are given with no reason why
Living together in colossal times

I'm just a gypsy with wondering eyes
I'll tell you secrets that send you to sleep
All I can give you is all of my love
These are the things I can give you to keep"

We may not get back what we had, what I threw away, but you know I would do anything, anything you say. I'd cross a thousand miles of broken glass on my hands and knees, I would crawl if for a moment we could cease hostilities.  I don't know where I am, I don't know where I went wrong, but it seemed like such a good idea at the time, such a very very good idea at the time.  Now our dream is over, but lately I have found that you only seem to come alive when I am not around. 
  
     But is it just me or am I all on my own again? You're at the Taj Mahal, I'm outside Big Ben,
it's driving me round the bend. I see your face when I close my eyes, don't want a life alone
all by myself. I wanna give you my love, my love, my love. 

     We had a good thing, it was a blast, that was a long time in the past. You went through changes & I went away, and I have regretted that to this day.  I may not always have quite so much hair but what you saw in me will hopefully always be there. I'll never hurt you again, I swear. Forgive and forget I caused you some pain, find it in your heart to start again.  Now I may not ever be your Mister Right, but I'm happy to be your mister that will do for tonight.


      Girl, I know I've got a funny way of showing it, yes, I thought our love was here to stay, and blowing it was never on my agenda. Girl I know I ripped your heart right out so why pretend that there is even a shadow of doubt that it's the end. Why the hell are we breaking our necks?

       I fell for you and you grew to like me, we rolled around, kissing on the ground. You succumbed to my charms, fell asleep in my arms, beneath the stars above we fell in love. YOU'RE a bonefide fucking genius, frolicking in the autumn fields were we. I cherished you and you tolerated me."

No sudden movements
I ease my hand real slow
Then my hands are like lightning
And the bullets start to fly
I was almost in the clear too
With just inches left to go 

And if it's the fool who likes to rush in
And if it's the angel who never does try
And if it's me who will lose or win
Then I'll make my best guess and I won't care why
C'mon and get me you twist of fate
I'm standing right here Mr. Destiny
If you want to talk well then I'll relate
If you don't so what cause you don't scare me
Time comes when I'm older
And a new kid hits the street
They'll say he's fast and he looks for me
And he says I'm going down
And though I try to avoid this man
Eventually we'll meet
He draws faster than I can see and knocks me to the ground

And the lights are getting dim
Preacher comes and tells me
Repent it's time to pray
You can lose only just once
But you never always win
I smile at him with my last words
And this is what I'll say 

Well if it's the fool who likes to rush in

I suck at photography, well I guess I'm pretty good at taking the picture and everything, but when it comes to working in the lab I suck. I never have good whites or blacks living together in harmony.  Mostly some sort of black and gray.  I get an ""A"" on all the assignments, but I don't see how with all my chemical stains.  I ruined like two rolls of film last week, that really brought me down.   On a lighter note Russ and I are finally sitting down and putting songs together."

1.) He's a cool guy (and not in a Fonzie way . . . more like Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino)

2.) He's been playing guitar for less than two years and he already smokes the rest of my students who've been playing as long.

3.) He speaks Japanese . . . okay, maybe partially, but he does take Japanese in school. ""Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.""

4.) Dillon likes REAL music. He's not some self-annointed poser like most of the guys his age that are musicians. Led Zep, Rush, Jenn Cristy . . . how can you go wrong?

So this morning I was at the gas station and I was distracted by something and I forgot to put the cap back on the tank.  I got to school saw it was missing and I was like ""Fuck"".  I decided to go back to the gas station after school and I asked the clerk if anyone had turned in a cap but he said no, it turns out it was over in some grass by a tree. I don't know what I believe but I do am sure of one thing, Karma.  I do good deeds and I'm repaid, sure like when I find money and I turn it in ppl call me stupid, I don't like having guilt. I need to get a band going,  when we are ready we'll make a demo, I'll give it to Marv, he'll give it to his manager and the record label he is on,  we will hopefully get a manager and signed, and then we will rock, and make lots of money.  The problem is finding the band members, they need to be good and reliable.  Like not getting arrested and being grounded for 2 months would be ideal.  LATER."

""New World Man""

He's a rebel and a runner
He's a signal turning green
He's a restless young romantic
Wants to run the big machine

He's got a problem with his poisons
But you know he'll find a cure
He's cleaning up his systems
To keep his nature pure

Learning to match the beat of the Old World Man
Learning to catch the heat of the Third World Man

He's got to make his own mistakes
And learn to mend the mess he makes
He's old enough to know what's right
But young enough not to choose it
He's noble enough to win the world
But weak enough to lose it
He's a New World Man...

He's a radio receiver
Tuned to factories and farms
He's a writer and arranger
And a young boy bearing arms

He's got a problem with his power
With weapons on patrol
He's got to walk a fine line
And keep his self-control

Trying to save the day for the Old World Man
Trying to pave the way for the Third World Man

He's not concerned with yesterday
He knows constant change is here today
He's noble enough to know what's right
But weak enough not to choose it
He's wise enough to win the world
But fool enough to lose it
He's a New World Man..."

Tucked in between your dirty sheets

Hangin' out just like a street sign

It slams through the gate, it'll catch you off guard 
Everyone said, ""What a perfect love match 
'Cause she is so smart, she's a hell of a catch"" 

I was drinking in love, gulping it down 
Drifting for months on a billowing cloud 
But after awhile I stopped to rebel 
I'm back in the past and I'm raising up hell 

But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life 
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life 

We'd been living together for over a year 
The harmony's perfect, it rang loud and clear 
But then very slowly, my nerves start to fray 
The little things big, that's what they say 

I acted impatient, I acted unkind 
I took her for granted, I played with her mind 
She didn't deserve it but it was too late 
I walked out the door and left her to her fate 

But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life 
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life

Now I'm down in a slump and I'm eating alone 
I ruined the day with some friends on the phone 
I never go out, I'm becoming a grouch 
I just watch the TV and I drink on the couch 

But if love comes again, I'll be really surprised 
I'll grab it real fast, keep it right in my sights

'Cause I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life 
Well I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life

Well now I'm gonna write a play that is supposed to last 10 mins.

""Rockin' In The Free World""

There's colors on the street
Red, white and blue
People shufflin' their feet
People sleepin' in their shoes
But there's a warnin' sign
on the road ahead
There's a lot of people sayin'
we'd be better off dead
Don't feel like Satan,
but I am to them
So I try to forget it,
any way I can.

Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world.

I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she puts the kid away,
and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life,
and what she's done to it
There's one more kid
that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love,
never get to be cool.

Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world.

We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler,
Machine gun hand
We got department stores
and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes
for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people,
says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn,
got roads to drive.

Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world."

Him: Dillon tuck your shirt in
Me: why
Him:Tuck it in
Me:tell me why I should
Him:Do it now
Cashier:DIllon just do it
Me:fine (I undo my belt and pants right in front of all the customers and then I tuck my shirt in)

After that a supervisor came up and told me I gave her and all the other ladies something to look at.  SO last night I found out that one of my coworkers bf was cheating on her so we went to Steak n Shake right after work and now every1 is asking us how our date was.  She told the manager I dont like (he also hits on her) that we had sex twice too. We didnt though.  But I was like yeah in your face cracker.

""Working Man""

I get up at seven, yeah
And I go to work at nine
I got no time for livin'
Yes, I'm workin' all the time

It seems to me
I could live my life
A lot better than I think I am
I guess that's why they call me
They call me the working man

They call me the working man
I guess that's what I am

I get home at five o'clock
And I take myself out a nice, cold beer
Always seem to be wonderin'
Why there's nothin' goin' down here

Well, they call me the working man
I guess that's what I am


""Rivendell""

Sunlight dances through the leaves
Soft winds stir the sighing trees
Lying in the warm grass
Feel the sun upon your face
Elven songs and endless nights
Sweet wine and soft relaxing lights
Time will never touch you
Here in this enchanted place

You feel there's something calling you
You're wanting to return
To where the misty mountains rise and friendly fires burn
A place you can escape the world
Where the dark lord cannot go
Peace of mind and sanctuary by loud water's flow

I've traveled now for many miles
It feels so good to see the smiles of
Friends who never left your mind
When you were far away
From the golden light of coming dawn
Till the twilight where the sun is gone
We treasure every season
And every passing day

We feel the coming of a new day
Darkness gives way to light a new way
Stop here for a while until the world
The world calls you away
Yet you know I've had the feeling
Standing with my senses reeling
This is the place to grow old 'til
I reach my final day.


""The Trees""

There is unrest in the forest
There is trouble with the trees
For the maples want more sunlight
And the oaks ignore their pleas

The trouble with the maples
(And they're quite convinced they're right)
They say the oaks are just too lofty
And they grab up all the light
But the oaks can't help their feelings
If they like the way they're made
And they wonder why the maples
Can't be happy in their shade

There is trouble in the forest
And the creatures all have fled
As the maples scream 'Oppression!'
And the oaks just shake their heads

So the maples formed a union
And demanded equal rights
'The oaks are just too greedy
We will make them give us light'
Now there's no more oak oppression
For they passed a noble law
And the trees are all kept equal
By hatchet, axe and saw"

""Ramble On""

Leaves are falling all around, It's time I was on my way. 
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay. 
But now it's time for me to go. The autumn moon lights my way. 
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way. 
Sometimes I grow so tired, but I know I've got one thing I got to do... 

Ramble On, And now's the time, the time is now, to sing my song. 
I'm goin' 'round the world, I got to find my girl, on my way. 
I've been this way ten years to the day, Ramble On, 
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams. 

Got no time to for spreadin' roots, The time has come to be gone. 
And to' our health we drank a thousand times, it's time to Ramble On. 

Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear. 
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air. 
T'was in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair. 
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her, her, her....yeah. 

Gonna ramble on, sing my song. Gotta keep-a-searchin' for my baby... 
Gonna work my way, round the world. I can't stop this feelin' in my heart 
Gotta keep searchin' for my baby. I can't find my bluebird!"

It's horrible I hate everything about it, stupide ppl in the classes I took to avoid them.  Like Brit Lit requires an ass load of reading and the ppl around me just complained about it. I'm sort of like ""Then why did u take the class?""  Anthropology has a bunch of stupid kids there too, most of which are stupid preps or white trash.  it sux.  3rd period is Int Chem/Phys I dont know where to begin with that one.  C lunch is really crowded, I found Cory my drummer and a kid he knew, but before that this one guy I don't know very well asked if he could sit there so I said okay but then all of his lame friends found him and took over our table. The three of us went outside. Only to be surrounded by stupid hicks.  My 4th per.

Too young to die but old is the grave

Bell bottom blues, you made me cry.
I don't want to lose this feeling.
And if I could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms.


Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away.
Give me one more day, please.
I don't want to fade away.
In your heart I want to stay.

It's all wrong, but it's all right.
The way that you treat me baby.
Once I was strong but I lost the fight.
You won't find a better loser.

Bell bottom blues, don't say goodbye.
I'm sure we're gonna meet again,
And if we do, don't you be surprised
If you find me with another lover.

I don't want to fade away.
Give me one more day please.
I don't want to fade away.
In your heart I long to stay.

And his clinging wife doesn't understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail
It's a steady job but he wants to be a paperback writer

It's a thousand pages, give or take a few
I'll be writing more in a week or two
I can make it longer if you like the style
I can change it round and I want to be a paperback writer

If you really like it you can have the rights
It could make a million for you overnight
If you must return it, you can send it here
But I need a break and I want to be a paperback writer

""The Rain Song""

This is the springtime of my loving - the second season I am to know 
You are the sunlight in my growing - so little warmth I've felt before. 
It isn't hard to feel me glowing - I watched the fire that grew so low. 

It is the summer of my smiles - flee from me Keepers of the Gloom. 
Speak to me only with your eyes. It is to you I give this tune. 
Ain't so hard to recognize - These things are clear to all from 
time to time. 

Talk Talk - I've felt the coldness of my winter 
I never thought it would ever go. I cursed the gloom that set upon us... 
But I know that I love you so 

These are the seasons of emotion and like the winds they rise and fall 
This is the wonder of devotion - I see the torch we all must hold. 
This is the mystery of the quotient - Upon us all a little rain must fall."

Hey lady--you got the love I need 
Maybe more than enough. 
Oh Darling... walk a while with me 
You've got so much... 

Many have I loved - Many times been bitten 
Many times I've gazed along the open road. 

Many times I've lied - Many times I've listened 
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know. 

Many dreams come true and some have silver linings 
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold. 

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing 
Many many men can't see the open road. 

Many is a word that only leaves you guessing 
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, ooh! 
You really ought to know...

But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go, it only goes to show 
That you will be mine, by takin' our time. 

And if you say to me tomorrow, oh what fun it all would be. 
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby. But What Is And What Should Never Be. 

So if you wake up with the sunrise, and all your dreams are still as new, 
And happiness is what you need so bad, girl, the answer lies with you. 

Oh the wind wont blow and we really shouldn't go and it only goes to show. 
Catch the wind, we're gonna see it spin, we're gonna...sail, little girl

Lonely Stranger

I must be invisible;
No one knows me.
I have crawled down dead-end streets
On my hands and knees.


I was born with a ragin' thirst,
A hunger to be free,
But I've learned through the years.
Don't encourage me.


'Cause I'm a lonely stranger here,
Well beyond my day.
And I don't know what's goin' on,
So I'll be on my way.

Don't get close to me,
'Cause it's sure to end in tears,

Some will say that I'm no good;
Maybe I agree.
Take a look then walk away.

Yeah, his guitar slung across his back.
His dusty boots is his Cadillac.
Flamin' hair just a blowin in the wind
Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin.
He left home when he was seventeen
The rest of the world he had longed to see.
But everybody knows the Boss.
A rolling stone who gathers no moss.

But you'd probably call him a tramp.
But it goes a little deeper than that 
He's a highway chile, yeah.

Now some people say he had a girl back home
Who messed around and did him pretty wrong
They tell me it kinda hurt him bad,
Kinda made him feel pretty sad.
I couldn't say what went through his mind
Anyway, he left the world behind.
But everybody knows the same old story,
In love and war you can't lose in glory.

Now you'd probably call him a tramp.
But I know it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile

Walk on brother, yeah.

I blew it
And if I knew what to do, then I'd do it
But the point that I have, I'll get to it
And forever for her is over for me
Forever, just the word that she said that means never
To be with another together
And with the weight of a feather it tore into me
Then I knew it
All the work that it took to get through it
On the wings of a feather that flew it
Fell onto my shoe it cut up into me

Well, everybody's reaction is changing you
But their love is only a fraction of what I can give to you
So let's do it, just get on a plane and just do it
Like the birds and the bees and get to it
Just get out of town and forever be free
Forever, I wonder we could stay together
It could change if you want for the better
Just turn down my shirt and lay down next to me

""The Denial Twist""

If you think that a kiss is all in the lips
C'mon, you got it all wrong, man
And if you think that our dance was all in the hips
Oh well, then do the twist
If you think holding hands is all in the fingers
Grab hold of the soul where the memory lingers and
Make sure to never do it with the fingers
Cause I'll tell everyone in the world

But he was thinking about the girl
Ya, but he's thinking about the girl, oh

A lot of people get confused and they bruise
Real easy when it comes to love
They start putting on their shoes and walking out
And singing ""boy, I think I had enough""

Just because she makes you feel wrong
She don't mean to be mean or hurt you on purpose, boy
Take a tip and do yourself a little service
Take a mountain turn it into a mole

Just by playing a different role
Ya, by playing a different role, oh

The boat ya you know she's rockin' it
And the truth well ya know there's no stoppin' it

The boat ya you know she's still rockin' it
The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it

So what, somebody left you in a rut
And wants to be the one who's in control
But the feeling that you're under can really make you wonder
How the hell she can be so cold

So now you're mad, denying the truth
And it's getting in the wisdom in the back of your tooth
Ya need ta spit it out, in a telephone booth
While ya call everyone that you know, and ask 'em

Where do you think she goes
Oh ya, where d'ya suppose she goes, oh

The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it
And the boat well ya know she's still rockin' it

The boat ya you know she's still rockin' it
And the truth ya you know there's no stoppin' it

You recognize with your back in the back?
That it's colder when she rocks the boat
But it's the cause hittin on the Cardinal Laws?
'bout the proper place to hang her coat

So to you, the truth is still hidden
And the soul plays the role of a lost little kitten but
You should know that the dark is one kitten?
She's been singing it all along

But you were hearin' a different song
Ya you were hearin' a different song
But you were hearin' a different song


""Take, Take, Take""

I was sitting there in a comfortable chair
And that was all that I needed
Then my friend offered me a drink for us to share
And that was all that I needed
Well, then I felt at ease
But then I'm not too hard to please
I guess you couldn't call me greedy
Then I was shocked to look up
And see rita hayworth there in a place so seedy
She walked into the bar with her long, red, curly hair
And that was all that I needed
And I said to my friend, ""good god, we're lucky men just to even see her""

Take, take, take
Take, take, take
Take, take, take

And I could not resist, I just had to get close to her
And that was all that I needed
I walked and loomed around her table for a while
And that was all that I needed
Then I said, ""i hate to bug you, ma'am, but can I have your autograph?""
And that was all that I needed
She pressed her lips against a white piece of paper
And that was all that I needed
Then I saw what she wrote, my heart is in my mouth
And that was all that I needed
Then she handed it to me, and I think that she could see
That that was all that I needed
I started to walk away but then I remembered 'hey, I forgot to get a picture'
So I asked her one more time, ""could I have another favor?""
That was all that I needed
She was kind and posed with me
Then I knew my friend would see my celebrity meeting

Take, take, take
Take, take, take
Take, take, take

She turned and said to me, ""I need to go to sleep,""
And it seemed so mean
It's almost as if she could not appreciate how cool I was being
She said, ""good night"" and walked away
And I didn't know what to say
I just couldn't believe it
Well, it's just not fair
I want to get a piece of hair
That was all that I needed
Or maybe a kiss on the cheek
I wouldn't wash it for a week
That would be all that I needed
But she didn't even care
That I was even there
What a horrible feeling

"event","So I was invited to go hangout with two people who graduated last year. I thought we weren't going to do anything but when I got there they told me they wanted to go swimming at the lake at midnight.  I  didn't have anything to swim in except my shorts and I really didn't want to swim in those so they said it would be alright if I went naked. I thought they were joking but no they were serious.  So we got there and I just sat on shore because I'm lame like that.  I just sat there the whole time waiting for some sort of authority figure with a badge and a flashlight to come and give us tickets so I made sure I was where I couldn't be seen.  But the only person who came was some hicks in a truck but they just turned around.  Then we went and played at the park in Sherwood Oaks until a half naked man told us to leave or else he's calling the cops.  That's how I started off my summer.

""Mighty Rearranger""
Last night as I was laying down and thinking
I was wondering 'bout the road that lies ahead
In my mind I heard the wisdom of the master
Hey, Robert, those dreams are only in your head

Last night as I was dreaming 'bout the future
Living out my time - the days and years ahead
I was moving with the mighty rearranger
I was thinking about the wisdom that he said

Mighty rearranger - mighty rearranger --

Last night as I was walking with an angel
Sweet talking and romancing in my mind
I live my life - I know it's filled with danger
She tell me: daddy, good love is hard to find

Mighty rearranger - mighty rearranger --

Last night, well, I came upon a stranger
He smiled at me and this is what he said:
If you're troubled, send your mind out on vacation
Let it wander like the wild geese in the west
Let it wander like the wild geese in the west

Round, round, moving me round
Round, round the air

She's lost in conversation with the birds of the air
She's trading information in a world without fear
She's fixing up a potion made of laughter and love
And I will follow the enchanter on the road to the sun

Round, round, moving me round
Round, round, round
Oh, that the stars will light my way
Oh, that my tides dance the ebb and sway

She's studying the planets and she's searching for signs
Her eyes promise mystery and her treasure to find
She's mixing my emotions - it's so easily done
In league with the enchanter on the road to the sun

Oh, that the stars will light my way
Oh, that my tides dance the ebb and sway
Yeah, it's so very easily done

""Way I Feel Inside""

Should I try to hide
The way I feel inside
My heart for you?
Would you say that you
Would try to love me too?
In your mind could you ever be
Really close to me?
I can tell the way you smile
If I feel that I could be certain then
I would say the things
I want to say tonight

But till I can see
That you'd really care for me
I will dream that someday you'll be
Really close to me
I can tell the way you smile
If I feel that I could be certain then
I would say the things
I want to say tonight

But till I can see
That you'd really care for me
I'll keep trying to hide
The way I feel inside

""Queen Bitch""

I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
My heart's in the basement
My weekend's
at an all time low
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard
to pull sister Flo

'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her
letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

(CHORUS)
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat
and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She's an old-time ambassador 
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it,
she don't make false claims
But she's a Queen,
and such are queens
That your laughter
is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say,
why didn't I say, no, no, no

(CHORUS)

So I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say,
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

I now have a new favorite movie, The Life Aquatic.  I love the story and the soundtrack even more. Listen to it!

Now I'm with a girl who makes me feel like Hillary felt.  I'm sorry Hillary. I shouldn't have gotten in another relationship. I don't even like Carly like that. She claims that she loves me more than I'll ever know and I beleive her and that's what bothers me.  She said something about getting married!!!!  What am I thinking? I'm so sorry I broke up with you. I dont know what I was thinking when I did. I had Carly around all the time and everyone said she was the one but I never really felt that way. I know it was stupid of me to do that because all I did was hurt myself and I'm guessing it hurt you.  I call Carly by your name all the time and I can't quit thinking about you. I try to pull whatever I can out of Annie about you just about everytime I see her in the halls.  I called last night to talk to your mom about the book she gave me and I how I finished it and really enjoyed it but all I could do was ask about you.  I've thought about starting a band with Eric just so I could be near you. I miss you, my eyes water even as I write this.  I love you.

I think about you everyday,
I learn what I can in every way,
I listen to my music,
But my heart keeps calling out your name,
I just want to be back with you,
In a new relationship  not the same,
Even if it means going back to dating, 
My heart is here waiting,
But I hope your not over me,
Because I still find you lovely,
Just let me know,

All the people that you know. 
All those people that you know. 
All those people that you know 
floatin' in the river are gone. 

Gonna take this sack of puppies. 
Gonna set it out to freeze. 
Gonna climb around on all fours 
'til all the blood falls out my knees. 

All the people that you know. 
All the people that you know. 
All those people that you know 
floatin' in the river are logs. 

Well let's take this potted plant 
to the woods and set it free. 
I'm gonna tell the owners 
just how nice that was of me. 

I could buy myself a reason. 
I could sell myself a job. 
I could hang myself on treason. 
Oh I am my own damn god.

Hey hey what can I do? I really don't know what to do now.  There are so many things happening with me right now and they need solutions but I just dont know what to do.  I'm finding things out that I wish I didn't know.

""Hypnotize""

I want to hypnotize you baby
On the telephone
So many times I called your house
Just to hear the tone
And though I knew you were't home
I didn't mind so much 'cause I'm so alone
I want to hypnotize you baby
On the telephone

I want to spin my little watch
Right before your eyes
You're the kind of girl a guy like me
Could hypnotize
And if this comes as a surprise
Just think of all those guys
Who would tell you lies
I want to spin my little watch
Right before your eyes

I want to hold your little hand
If I can be so bold
And be your right hand man
'til your hands get old
And then when all the feeling's gone
Just decide if you want to keep holding on
I want to hold your little hand
If I can be so bold
If I can be so bold
If I can be so bold"

""No Sugar Tonight""
Lonely feelin' deep inside
Find a corner where I can hide
Silent footsteps crowdin' me
Sudden darkness, but I can see

No sugar tonight in my coffee
No sugar tonight in my tea
No sugar to stand beside me
No sugar to run with me

Da-un-do-dow dow da-un-do-dow
Da-un-do-dow dow no no
Da-un-do-dow dow da-un-do-dow
Da-un-do-dow dow

In the silence of her mind
Quiet movements, well, I can find
Grabbin' for me with her eyes
Now I'm fallin' from her skies

No sugar tonight in my coffee
No sugar tonight in my tea
No sugar to stand beside me
No sugar to run with me

Da-un-do-dow dow da-un-do-dow
Da-un-do-dow dow un-dow-dow
Da-un-do-dow dow da-un-do-dow
Da-un-do-dow dow"

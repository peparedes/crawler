"event","I had gone to sleep 
One summer afternoon
Only to awake up to see a boy
Standing over the hammock.
He inquired to my actions
And wondered why I was wasting such time.
But, time is not wasted 
If it is spent dreaming."

"event","Wow...time flies when you're doing...nothing...? Well, that's pretty much it. I've been home since July 30th. Which is great. I love being home, even if I haven't done much. We went to Splish Splash with Adam, Travis, Christal, Alexa, Leigha, Caitlin, Bryanna, Nicky, Jackie, Lauren and Adam's friends. It was a blast. I <3 you guys. Then Travis and I were at the beach...and that was pretty much it. I start school on Tuesday and I hate to admit it, but I'm terrified. Completely and utterly scared sh*tless. I don't really like the idea of going in there knowing no one...but there's nothing much i can do. I feel like I'm gonna be alone for good. I feel like from now on, I'm gonna be alone throughout my entire high school experience...

I've been lolling around the house, amusing myself by trying to catch enough frogs to create my Amphibian Army to assist me in my plans for world domination, throwing sticks at the gator that lives in the lake, snoozing by the pool and juss watching Jeopardy with rapt attention. (Ken Jennings is my hero!) Other than that, nothin' else has happened. The good news is that I'll be home next Friday. Peace, Love and Respect."

I haven't been able to write for a while because we drove up to Disney for the last week, but now I'm here in Port Charlotte...until the 30th. Disney was okay. Hot, sticky, muggy and really crowded. But of course, since you're in Disney, you really don't give a rip. And Muppets 3-D always is awesome...so is Star Tours and Mission:Space. (P.S.--EVERYONE MUST GO RIDE MISSION:SPACE!! IT WAS CRAZY!!)I ran around all week in those hats with the Mickey ears on them and I hugged Baloo and Buzz Lightyear. (w00t) Oooh...lemme juss fill you in on the status of the guys down here...(Dorothy and Cassie, pay attention)...There is an abundance of blonde/brown haired, muscular, medium height, very tanned, skate/punk/preps down here. Long and short hair. So Cass, if you interested, take a vacation and get your mind offa you-know-who. ^.^ And plus, the malls are crawling with single guys...how do i know, you might ask? Well, how often do taken guys walk around malls with their guys? lol. There you go. Peace for now all."

Splash Mountain...can I call you back?"" or ""Shamu juss came out, hold on a second.."" or simply, ""AHHH!! THE MOSQUITOS HERE ARE THE SIZE OF A SMALL PLANET!! THEY'RE GONNA EAT ME!!"" But, gimme a ring anyways...I don't think i can last there a month without hearing from some people...

"event","Haven't been around in a while. Apologies to all. Things have been better lately. For example, school is over among other things. Last Thursday, I volunteered at Stagecoach's Field Day. I watched and refereed the little kiddies games and stuff. Anthony and Marco showed up about half way through so we chilled during our lunch break. Then Nick called Anthony to see if he wanted the Domino's he juss ordered. He told Nick to haul his butt down to Stagecoach with the food. Matt came too. So we all picnicked out in the front of the school with pizza, buffalo wings and cheese sticks. It was so hot that day that we grabbed the school's hose and drenched ourselves. (I got sunburned...Ouch...) Then Friday we had a science regents. Afterward, Turner, Jesse and Kevin and I walked down to Taco Bell for munchies...It was fun. I <3 you guys. ^.^ After that...It's the weekend...chillin' is great...

Tomorrow I have a spanish test...and i might chill with friends after...but that remains to be seen.
Peace all and Happy Father's Day to all the Daddies out there."

"event","Wow. This is boring. My brother is away at a sleepover camp trip with his class, so i have the house to myself. And it's BEEYOUTEEFULL!!
I LOVE being able to do what i want without consulting the almighty dictator who doesn't realize that I'm OLDER than him. This week is crammed with finals and regents reviews and it's driving me up the wall. I feel like i could have learned what i sat there for a year to learn, in five days. Does anyone else see this pointlessness? Reviews are pointless. That's your job. If you care enough. Don't make me sit there and do work. I'll choose to study and review if i CHOOSE to. That's the whole purpose of a choice. If I don't feel much like studying, then It's my fault an no one else's if i fail. There's only four days left. If I don't want to fricken study i won't!! AND NO ONE CAN MAKE ME!! But I don't want to sit there with a bunch of morons any longer than i hafta. And some people, who shall remain nameless (Taylor) ask the stupidest questions. And then yells at me for not standing for the pledge. I got a speech about how I must be unpatriotic and how I don't back this country in times of need. Well you know what? I don't stand for the pledge because I don't want to. If I wanted to I would be standing. We have the greatest government in the world. Especially when you compare it to the rest of the planet. But I don't always think what the government is doing is right. We think that because we are powerful and rich and all that jazz, that gives us the right to ""defend the peace of the world."" Ok. U.N. is a great idea, but somethings were juss meant to be left alone. Why did we interfere with Palestine and Israel? We had no business there. It was between them and them only. And you know why the Taliban have such good weapons? Because in an attempt to ""defend the peace of the world,"" we supplied them with sophisticated weapons. Duh. Live and let live. That's how it should be and should have been in the first place. 

Peace."

All the people who are important to me and a couple who mean the world to me couldn't show...Makes me feel like I'm worth a whole bunch. it was like three fifteen year olds.

THAT alone is enough to depress anyone. But, there is not much I can do about it. So I give up. HEAR THAT EVERYONE?!? I GIVE UP TRYING. I HATE DOING THINGS AND NOT GETTING ANYTHING BACK! Wow. Random huh? How does that tie in with birthdays you may ask. It doesn't. It's juss the truth. If you stop and think, moving to a small uninhabited tropical island doesn't sound bad to me at all. I could do it. Leave me stranded with a deck of playing cards, a lighter and a knife, and i could do juss fine. Oh, and I'd hafta bring my dog. No people. No distractions.

::All the computers are new flatscreens or laptops
::There is not one, not two, not three, but FOUR cafeterias
::I'm not 100% but i think Burger King gets delievered on Thursdays'
::Half the (student) parking lot is filled with BMWs and BenZes
::There's this place called ""The Commons"" which is a large grassy courtyard place where people chill during their free periods.
::They offer 68 different after school activities...(Which I won't be joining)
::They have every sport you can think of
::Can you say ""Olympic Sized Pool?""
::Open Campus to seniors
::To get in and out...they have computerized log in/log outs with an id card

Around ten, we all decided to go to the schoolyard and mess around and play Manhunt and such. Well, Bryanna, the genius (^.^) decides to open the school door. Me, being the smart one, knows that there is a silent alarm. I told Caitlin to find everyone and get the hell back to my house. (Thank god SOMEONE listens to me) I was making sure that everyone got home walking off to hop the fence home, when BOOM. A Cop shows up. This is the part where the cop asks me what the hell i was doing at a school an ten thirty and why the alarm was triggered. I said my friends and i were messing around and she opened the door. ""Why did she open the door?,"" he asks. ""Hmm...maybe cuz when most people see a door, they try to open it.""...then my info gets taken...yadda yadda. More on it tomorrow cuz im tired.

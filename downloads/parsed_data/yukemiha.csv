"event","The first five people to respond to this post and send me your mailing address will get something made by me! My choice. For you.

This offer does have some restrictions and limitations:

- I make no guarantees that you will like what I make!
- What I create will be just for you.
- It'll be done this year.
- You have no clue what it's going to be. It may be wood. Possibly metal. Perhaps a picture. Or, I may bake you something and mail it to you. Who knows? Not you, that's for sure!
- I reserve the right to do something extremely strange.

The catch? Oh, the catch is that you have to put this in your journal as well. We all can make stuff!"

"event","This entry will be quick... for I'm at work and needed a break from the pile of work that has been slowly compiling over the last few days. This last week has been crazy. Last monday was my one year anniversary.... YEA!!!... we made it a whole year. I had class so at 8:30 (when I finally was able to sneak out of class.) I made my way to the car and Chris took me to the beautiful Renaissance hotel in OKC. It's absolutely fabulous. It was late, but we had room service deliver a yummy pizza and then we split a bottle of wine. We got giggly (which usually happens when I drink)... and had some much needed us time. 
 Things have been so crazy lately.  My brother Kurt has been going through a divorce that seems to get uglier every day. Wensday was my niece Alexandra's four birthday. She's such a little spit fire!!!.. Wensday was also Kurt's court day and things worked in his favor... they will have split custody of the children. (though I really think she's going to try and take them and hide them over the summer in Panama, which is where she is from.) 
   Chris and I joined a bowling league. Teusday nights is date night bowling... so much needed once a week us time... it's nice to have. Wensday we bowl with my brother.. that is usually fairly entertaining. 
   In other news, okrf has been going fairly well... I'm seriously considering changing characters next years. I've been Katherine Lyrik for six years and I really think that it's time for a change. I'm not sure what Christopher wants to do, but we shall see. We have one more weekend of festival. It should be interesting. I'm considering going to the ceileh (hmm... don't think that's spelled right.) It should be fun. 
I'm already ready for this weekend....c'mon friday afternoon."

"event","Alright... so I have some extra time and I figured that I would update. I've spent the morning thinking of my childhood and wishing that I had it all on film so that I could cuddle up with Mr. Bear and relive it. The pictures of my childhood are not old and faded yet (fine, they are old but not faded) and I wish that they were all organized. Lately, I've been finding pictures everywhere. I ran across my graduation pictures last night. I look so young, and I know I was niave.  All this talk of pictures and of summertime has me missing my summers. They really ended after high school. I mean, sure there is a summer break in college, but unless you're some little rich kid, summer becomes a time of replacing school time with work time and other things.  As I said before the summer has been crazy busy... but that seems to be how I like things. When it's not so busy, I have to wonder what's wrong and why I'm not doing something. I have another job interview tomorrow...  whoo... let me start at the beginning. I've been working Temp jobs all summer... I still have the job at the laser tag place... you'll have to excuse me. I'm not suppose to tell you (according to my boss) anything about Laser Expedition (oh dar... I didn't say it ... you didn't hear it from me) on here. Last summer she nearly fired someone because of it.  Anyway.... soon enough people will know about that place. I have a bit of a delimma there... remind to explain another day. I have spent nearly three years of my life there. Yeah, it sucks.... anyway, this summer I started working temp jobs because I'm getting paid more and I get more hours which means I get more money... Yay for money. Now, due to circumstances outside my control (not that I'm complaining) I have a temp job at a sign shop through November. I've applied to be a receptionist at CSMA, which is a part time job. Tomorrow is the second interview. There was mention of a test too... which makes me a bit nervous. If I can get it, that will be awesome and then add school, and OKRF and that makes for a pretty busy semester. Also, my goal for this semester is good grades... I mean really good grades. I'll let you know how it goes."

"event","Ok... so I planned to write yesterday, but the computer froze and I got side tracked. This week has been a pain in my ass. I got the answer back on my portfolio and it was not good.  I now have three weeks to almost completely redo my portfolio, do several projects, and study for finals.  thanks for the comments guys..."

"event","I have a problem.. .a huge problem. For those of you who know my boyfriend, I have heard the same story from two seperate people about something that he did.  I admit that I hear a lot of rumors about him from his stalkers, but I'm very disturbed by the similarities between these two stories, especially since they came from two seperate places that (to the best of my knowledge) have not been in contact with each other. The only connection that I can see is possibly my bf's little brother, who is an absolute asshole... guys... what do you suggest I do?"

"event","Wow, dear diary, it's been so long since I've written in here. It's been more than a year, in fact! I missed out on my entire 2nd year. That's right, I'm a third year Gryffindor now at Hogwarts and I'm really excited. I'm no longer an ickle, I'm in the middle of the years (at least somewhat close) and well... it's interesting to see how things are going now. Licies and I are super duper close friends now, I'm even her next-door neighbour because my family moved to the village she lives in. It was purely coincidence, I swear! But we had an awesome summer with sleepovers, doing our homework together, playing in the ocean and all that stuff. It's too bad Liz and Stella live farther away from us or else we could have all spent our summers together.

I've grown alot taller now - 5""0 or something like that! I'm taller than all my friends, aside from Ryan, and my hair's pretty long too. Remember when it use to be down to my shoulders? The girls are also all complaining about boobs and big waist but for some reason, I haven't seen much change in my body except for sprouting up like a bean plant. Is it normal? I hope so, maybe I should ask somebody, or owl my Mom or something. It's too bad Dawn hasn't been around lately or I would ask her those stuff.

Classes have been rather boring lately, even DADA. I use to love DADA because Professor Trimble brought in all these Dark Creatures and we learned about them, but this year we have a new teacher, Professor MacLeod, and she's teaching us how to be aware of stuff... Constant Viligance or something. Divinations class is a nightmare, mainly because Trewlawney never opens her windows, lights incense and perfume constantly, and had pouffes for us to sit in so that I fall asleep. It's a horrible class, hasn't done any predicting. But at least I have Licies.

I have to go now but I'll update soon about more stuff!

"event","Guess where I am right now! At home! Yes! Home sweet home, back in the busy city of Toronto with all the smokestacks, shopping malls, cars and whatnots polluting the air. You'd think I would have been missing the busy city life but it turns out that I'm missing the quiet, non-polluted atmosphere of the Hogwarts school grounds. Everything seems just a bit more busier than usual over here now and I'm missing my friends dreadfully. Anyways, it's the last day of school, and it was quite eventful, let me tell you that.

First off, I was hanging out in the North Tower for a little quiet time after lunch and guess who joined me soon after? Ryan. It was around 4 months since the last time we really talked and so you could guess how ackward it was between us, I didn't know what to say, especially when he said that he was looking for me. I suppose I got sort of mad at him and made him feel all guilty and he said sorry. He said that he just felt guilty when I fell off the broom for not being able to do anything. Everything worked out fine between us, I think. 

After that, Lina invited us to teach us a game of shooting Bertie Bott's beans with a bit of magic at random passing students. She then gave us a target and we shot at them for only a while before it seemed like we were going to get into trouble! I don't know why I was just standing there, although I wasn't able to shoot at the targets the Slytherin had provided, but before I knew it, Ryan was dragging me away from there all the way to the Tower. Unfortunately, Mrs. Norris caught him, Lina and Mekare (she joined us for some target practise as well) while we were running away and they all got detention. I suppose I owe it to Ryan for saving me from detention although I do feel a bit guilty for being there and not getting caught as well.

Well as exciting as that may be, the end of the school year is coming to a close so with my trunk in tow, I boarded the Hogwarts Express, ready to go back home. I found myself an empty compartment and who was it to join me but Liz? Yep, the very best friend that I've been fighting with for the past week. I suppose there was nowhere else to go. Stella found us later and yeah, things were still all ackward. Then Alicia came and for some reason, jumped to conclusions that we had all made up and hugged Liz out of no where! That silly girl, but in the end, we all made up and became the lovely best friends we are today. And after lots of goodbyes, we all departed and I caught a portkey back home. I'll write more later!

"event","Well, dear diary, I am now 14 years old. I don't know if anybody knows it, I wonder if even my family knows. I haven't told anybody here at Hogwarts yet although my calender that I hung up by my bed has it all marked out in colored pens and everything. It's quite noticable, to be honest. Liz and I are still not talking, Alicia's really great and nice, I love her alot. I feel bad for dragging her and Stella into this fight because now they're not really speaking with Liz either. I wonder how she's doing too. I don't want to ask, it's so ackward in the room now and Hani doesn't really know what's going on either. She doesn't show up much in there, I don't blame her. Two of her room mates are fighting, so why should she? Eh... Doesn't matter. The school year's nearly finished and I shall be happy back home with my family and friends.

Oh, there's still a Transfiguration exam today, I just wanted to write down an entry for today since it is supposedly special and all that. I better go and study, I really do hate that course. Geez... turning chipmunks into statues? I swear, this is animal cruelty or something! Is it even allowed? Well of course it is if we're doing this in class. Oh, and I also transfigured a button into a beetle or something like that. Transfigured shouldn't be the appropriate term, I should use something like ""mutated"" a button into a beetle. It looked so horrendous! Must be the worst spell I've ever casted! Oops... Liz is starting to wake up, better get out of here!

"event","Okay, so remember that Gryffindor that I was telling you about who was quite cranky? Well, turns out she's more than cranky, she's insulting, rude, and easily able to put you down. She kept on insulting me and since I was still peeved about what had happened between Liz and I, I couldn't help but snap back at her. She's so mean, wouldn't let me sit at the same table as her despite the fact that the bar was so full. Plus, I was soaking wet and she thought I was ""dirty"" because of it. Man, I don't even want to know how she got into Gryffindor. Geez! Well after giving up on trying to just sit peacefully at a table, I finished my butterbeer and left. I didn't want to deal with anymore fights for today. I had one too many.

"event","I think I just had the worst day of my entire eleven years of life. It started out alright with a rather gloomy, light drizzle in the sky. I woke up early and seeing how I always do a rain dance whenever it rains, I dressed up in my rain dancing gear (including my lovely yellow boots) and went outside to dance off my worries of the whole Liz and Ryan thing. And then, lo and behold, my ex-best friend suddenly runs into me while I was doing twirls in the puddles. I think I still have a bruise from landing harshly onto my bottom. It's not exactly the most padded thing to land on anyway. 

I don't really remember how it all started, but I know that she was saying something and I didn't want to talk about it at the moment. After all, after seeing <i>your</i> best friend holding hands with the guy you have a crush on, wouldn't you be a bit angry? I was. Liz realized and suddenly, we were both shouting angrily at each other. Yes, me, Alyson Pacey, actually shouting at someone. It was a first but once I got started, I couldn't stop. I'm the kind of person who bottles up their emotion and Alex told me that it was unhealthy. I could see what he means now. 

Pretty soon, Stella and Alicia came in too. I suppose we must have been pretty loud because no one would have gone outside in the rain if they were sane. As we were arguing, the rain just kept going down heavier than I had ever seen. But it wasn't as bad as a hurricane storm, I think. I've never been in one anyways. Right, those two seemed to take my side as well, and as much as I appreciated them, I felt bad because there was no one supporting Liz. I hadn't expected this to happen; and all this just because she likes Ryan and never told me. I think I was holding a grudge against the fact that she lied to me about studying when she actually had plans for Hogsmeade. That hurt. I hope that never happens again.

Right now, I'm in The Three Broomstick, dripping wet and sharing a table with a rather snobby Gryffindor girl. I haven't gotten her name yet... I'll write more when I get back.

"event","Okay, so I've been noticing something very strange lately and it's been bugging me to no ends. Ryan's been ignoring me for heaven knows what reason and Liz has been sort of as well. Of course, not as extreme as Ryan but still, she's different from who she once was. You know what's the strange thing? She's talking more about Ryan lately; always constantly bringing him up in conversations and things like that. I swear, she talks more about him than I do! Although I do constantly think about him... oh, I duelled Ryan once during this week but it was hardly a real duel. He just cast two Disarming Spells at me and left. Left without saying goodbye... much less saying anything during our duel at all. To be honest, I nearly cried in frustration because of that but shhhh, don't tell anyone. 

Oh, and then there was Saturday. Liz had told me that she was going to stay and study or something like that. Very un-Liz like. I know my best friend and she studies at the last minute just like me. Besides, it wasn't like there was any exams coming up yet. We still have a few weeks to go before the big day and so there's still time to chill before that. Anyway, so after my usual run in the morning, I went around the entire Hogwarts ground searching for her and I couldn't find her! You know where she was? In Hogsmeade with Ryan. I saw them even though I don't think they saw me and they were HOLDING HANDS! Holding hands. Liz. and Ryan. Do you think that my best friend, my un-lovey-dovey sportsaholic, tomboy 'I-jealous-of-Ryan-cuz-he's-stealing-you-away' best friend would just happen to have a crush on the very same guy that I like? I would have never guess it.

I went to Honeydukes to visit Alicia instead of bothering to interrupt whatever Liz and Ryan were up to. At least Alicia would have appreciated my company anyways. She noticed something was wrong and I told her about the two of them. Oh dear... what to do now? My best friend likes my crush. Like we needed even more competition between the two of us! I hope I'm wrong about this all, but it's not likely that I am. I hope that I can actually get them to stop and look at me for a minute so I can ask them what's up. I can't stand being left out like this!

"event","Oh wow, can you believe that my nerdy brother Alex actually got me a diary/journal/scrapbook to write in and keep my ""memories of Hogwarts alive""? I got it in the mail today, I think it might have been part of my Christmas present that got lost. He's a weird one, he is. I have to say, the middle childs are always the odd ones in the family, although I am slightly odd because I'm the only girl (besides my mom) in my family. Aiden is at least sporty while being smart at the same time. He's so lucky that he gets good marks even though he slacks off all the time. Anyway... I really have no clue what to do in here; Alex got this to me so late! He should have given it to me at the beginning of the year but no matters. 

I'll glue in some stuff that I want to remember in here like letters and a couple of homework assignments...the ones that I got good on, that is. I'll also try to write about my day's activities in here as best as I can. Hopefully this will help me with my writing skills which Alex says are abbsolutely dreadful. Oh well, I'm eleven for goodness sakes! Actually, two months until my birthday, I can't wait for that day! I wonder if my family will ever get me a dog... I want one although I don't think I'm allowed to take it to school. Then what's the point of calling it my dog if I won't even see it during break? Alright then, scratch the dog idea. I'll get a hamster.

Hmm... alright, gimme a minute and I'll dig up some stuff to post in here. I think I'll be putting in a lot of History of Magic assignments and notes in here. I don't want those notes I took in class to be lost. Who knows might pick them up? I hope not Ryan... after all, Liz wrote a ton of embarrasing stuff about him and me in there... Right. Bye!

"event","Exams-done.
Semester-over.
YAYAYAYAY!

Now the next two weeks will involve Jeff, sleep, the beach and other random times dancing, writing, or generally being drunk as hell. 

Then summer session starts, which will be amazingly amazing ONLY! because I get to spend many hours deciphering common denominators with the ever lovely Diana Hurlburt :)

Things are looking up :0)

They made a statue of us
And it put it on a mountain top
Now tourists come and stare at us
Blow bubbles with their gum
Take photographs for fun, for fun

They'll name a city after us
And later say it's all our fault
Then they'll give us a talking to
Then they'll give us a talking to
Because they've got years of experience
We're living in a den of thieves
Rummaging for answers in the pages
We're living in a den of thieves
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious

We wear our scarves just like a noose
But not 'cause we want eternal sleep
And though our parts are slightly used
New ones are slave labor you can keep

We're living in a den of thieves
Rummaging for answers in the pages
We're living in a den of thieves
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious

They made a statue of us
They made a statue of us
The tourists come and stare at us
The sculptor's marble sends regards
They made a statue of us
They made a statue of us
Our noses have begun to rust
We're living in a den of thieves
Rummaging for answers in the pages
Were living in a den of thieves

And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious
And it's contagious"

"event","Is the passion all gone?
Or is it still newly wed?
If all this heats doing, is making us stick to the bed...
And there's no light, to revive.

But if the hungers still there, buried somewhere inside,
Covered up by the boredom we've been trying to hide,
We dig it up, and devour.

And it seems more like a song, and less like its math,
When you pull on my hair, and bite me like that,
It seems more like a song."

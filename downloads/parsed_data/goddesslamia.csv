"event","Today I found out that John will be able to come home for the next five weekends.  I go up either Friday or Saturday to pick him up.  It depends on if he gets the duty swap approved and the Cheif signs his chit sheet.  And because of President's Day, he doesn't have to be back until Monday.  And because he will have duty during the week for the four weeks after that he will get to come home.  Our puppies are doing okay.  We are trying to decide if we want to keep both or just one for Dade.  They are now a week old.  Dade is trying to learn to crawl.  He is doing more of lunging forward and then using his toes to scoot forward, but he has great speed.   He is also getting his first tooth in.  He likes to clamp down on his metal spoons because they make noises against his tooth.  Choir is going really well.  They were a bit mean this morning.  We now use choir robes and they are winter robes.  We went in and sang a song with four verses for the opening congregational song.  Then went down and shook hands with people, then went back up and sang another verse.  We then had to stand while the associate pastor handed out awards to a group of girls who went to a cnontest.  Then we sang our choir song which was high notes and fast paced.  Then the passtor asked us to sing it again.  We were getting ready to go take off our choir robes and the pastor asked us to stay on the platform.  We were up there through the whole service in our choir robes roasting and getting ready to pass out.  Then during the invitation Pastor asked us to sing our choir song again.  I almost passed out a couple of times.  Tony has told me over and over again in the IMs he sends me that he is still almost completely in love with me.  I'm not sure what to think about it.  He said that he was thinking the best thing for him would be for me to be out of his life.  Sometimes I wonder if he is right.  I hate saying it because he is my best friend and he is always there to help me, but I know I am hurting him because I married John.  I hate hurting people unless they deserve it and Tony doesn't.  I am going to head to bed soon."

"event","I have kept up correspondences with Tony a lot better than anyone else.  As a matter of fact, I am talking to him while I write this.  I went up to see John Saturday.  We went to Gurnee Mills again.  He bought me two stickers for my car.  One said freak and the other said goddess.  I put freak on above goddess.  John said it added a nice touch.  I just don't know what they will say at church.  I had choir practice yesterday for new music for Sundays.  It is southrn gospel.  I am actually enjoying them.  They challenge my voice.  I also found out we now have blue choir robes.  It will be weird wearing robes.  But I will get used to it.  My chow had me up at five this morning because she was having puppies.  She is a red chow with a black puppy.  So far she has only had one.  After John and I left the mall we went to a hotel for a few hours.  That was quite fun.  Hopefully he can get a duty swap and come home this weekend.  He does definitely get to come home next weekend on Saturday and go back Monday.  I can't wait to have John sleeping by side again, even for a couple nights.  I would pefer longer, but it can't be.  I just hope he can come these next two weekends.  I am going to go take care of my son.  Later!"

"event","I got a call Sunday from a friend from high school.  Bon and I talked for almost an hour and got caught up on almost everything.  It seems she has found her knight in shining armor so to speak.  I hope evrything works out for her.  I know some of the guys she has dated in the past have been assholes to say the least.  We are hoping to get together Saturday if my husband is able to come home.  He won't find out until tomorrow.  Maybe if John doesn't come home just Bon and I can go out instead the four of us.  I have to call her tonight anyway.  When we talked I told her that John has been trying to find a woman for me to sleep with.  She asked why we didn't ask her, so I offered then.  She said she would talk to her boyfriend about it.  I rather like the idea of sleeping with an ex-girlfriend of mine.  She gave me the e-mail address of another friend of mine from high school.  I e-mailed him Monday and have gotten a few back since then.  One every day.  Which is more than I am getting from my husband.  But then again I talk to John every night.  Some times more than once a day.  I am still debating whether or not I should move up there with John.  Here I have my mom, his parents, Bon, Tony soon, church and choir, and a few friends from there.  Up there I have my husband, but only when he's not on duty or watch or at school.  That basically leaves me alone except at night.  I miss John more than anything, but I hate being alone.  The only way I wouldn't be is if he could introduce me to his friends' girlfriends and they accepted me and wanted me around, especially having a baby.  I don't know if I ready to leave here.  I want to spend as much time with him as I can with everything getting worse overseas and all service members getting deployed, but I don't want to be alone.  Everyone I ask for advice have mixed feelings.  Some think I should go, some think I should stay, but most won't say.  My father criticizes John for leaving when he has a baby and me for not following my husband.  My mom thinks I should stay just in case John does get shipped out.  John's parents think I should go so that John and I don't have as much of a risk of falling out of love from seperation.  They want our marriage to last as do John and I.  John wants me to follow because he misses Dade and me.  My friends want me to stay.  People at church want me to stay and go.  I don't know what to do.  Right now I just don't watch news and keep myself busy with church choir.  We have started rehearsals for our Easter cantata.  That is April 18th, 19th, and 20th.  I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow at one.  I am going to go eat.  Later!"

"event","Let your needs be known. Your lover can't read your mind, so if there's something you'd like them to do for you, tell them. And who knows -- if you're lucky, you might just get more than you thought you would! This is my couple's horoscope for today!

Are You Meant for Each Other? 
Just-About-Perfect Pair
You two make a great match. Your relationship is healthy and strong, mostly because you work hard at making it so. You're honest with each other, communicate clearly and seem to respect and appreciate each other. These are all crucial characteristics of a good relationship. In addition, you're self-confident and you trust your man, which allows you to live your own life (and allow him to do the same), and avoid the petty jealousies and possession problems that plague other couples. Keep it up and you two will be together for a long time to come.
 
Kissing by the Stars: What does your style say about you? 
Your results are based on the four Elements of Astrology: Fire, Earth, Air and Water. Each Element has its own set of characteristics, and each of us displays some combination thereof, usually with a focus on one or two. Which Elements most strongly influence you?

 
 
Note: Scores are rounded to one decimal place and therefore may not total 100%
You scored 41.7% Earth
In kissing and romance, you lean toward qualities exhibited by Earth Signs -- you're incredibly sensual, you love beauty and luxury and you expect your lover to treat you like royalty, a favor that you will gladly return. You prize commitment and loyalty in a relationship; as long as your sweetie gives you no reason to be jealous, you're as sweet and happy as can be. You're not against short-and-sweet affairs, but you're really looking for something more long-term and durable. You may find a Taurus, a Virgo or a Capricorn lover to be the sexiest and most committed match for you. Read more about these Sun Signs to find out what else they're like!


You scored 25% Fire
In kissing and romance, you lean toward qualities exhibited by Fire Signs -- you like things fast and passionate and see no reason to wait when what you want is within your reach! You also might not see any reason to tie yourself down to one person when there are so many attractive people in the world. Commitment may not be one of your strong points, but what you lack in loyalty you more than make up in dashing panache! You'd most likely match up best with an Aries, a Leo or a Sagittarius lover. Read more about these Sun Signs to find out what else they're like!


You scored 25% Water
In kissing and romance, you lean toward qualities exhibited by Water Signs -- you may be a little shy when it comes to public displays of affection, but you're a truly passionate and intuitive lover who is as interested in giving pleasure as you are in receiving it. You're not really interested in short, meaningless affairs, either; you'd much prefer to wait till you find your perfect life partner -- and you do believe there's one person out there who is just right for you. You'd probably love to be with a Cancer, a Scorpio or a Pisces lover. Read more about these Sun Signs to find out what else they're like!


You scored 8.3% Air
In kissing and romance, you lean toward qualities exhibited by Air Signs -- someone has to match you on an intellectual level if they expect to stimulate your more carnal desires. You're not opposed to long-term relationships and commitment, but sometimes you lose interest in a relationship more quickly than you'd want to admit! You're likely to be most turned on by a Gemini, a Libra or an Aquarius lover. Read more about these Sun Signs to find out what else they're like!"

"event","I went up to Great Lakes yesterday to see John.  I went up by myself.  A ten hour round trip.  I left around 8:30a.m.  and did not get home until two this morning.  I got to the base around 12:30p.m.  John and I went to McDonald's on base, then went to Gurnee Mills Mall.  That mall is huge.  It is about three times as large as any mall I have been to.  After we looked around the mall we went to Red Carpet Inn before I had to have him back before Liberty ended.  He asked me again to move up there.  He will be there until at least September.  I told him I might in April.  We have a lot of talking to do first.  He also asked me if I preferred San Diego or Virginia.  After he finishes his A-school in September, he has to go to C-school.  There are four places he can go.  Great Lakes, San Diego, Virginia, or on a ship.  I'm not sure when I should start following him.  My mother keeps discouraging the ideas and his parents want me to follow him to avoid ruining our marriage like John's brother did.  I want to follow him, but there are a lot of things to think about.  It would help if I had someone to talk to about my questions that has gone through this before.  John wants me to come up every weekend since I cn't move up there yet, but that will cost too much.  But then I feel like a bad wife because I am coming up with an excuse not to go see my husband.  I have to go check on my son.  Later!"

I am going to go up Saturday only.  John wants me to stay all weekend, but I would feel uncomfortable.  I am already going to feel uncomfortable enough.  He has made sure to call me at teast once a day since Saturday.  He still doesn't have a roommate.  The one that was supposed to stay in his room is living off base with his wife.  When John told me that I felt even worse because I am not up there with him.  John said he understands because I need to get all of the work done, but I can't help it.  If I was up there he wouldn't be so lonely or so bored.  I wouldn't be so lonely either.  I am not bored because I have Dade to take care of.  We got more pictures of Dade taken yesterday.  They are incredably cute, just like all of the others.  I can't wait to see John again even though it has only been a few days.  I am going to try to work some while Dade naps.  Later!"

"event","It has only been a little over a day and a half since I last saw my husband, but it seems so much longer.  We left around one o' clock Saturday afternoon to take John up to Great Lakes and did not return home until three Sunday morning.  Needless to say, I was exhausted.  John called yesterday and said that I may be able to go up this weekend and visit him.  I am a bit scared to go up there.  I am not sure why, I just am.  He wants Dade and me to move up there, but I told him I couldn't do that.  There are three Navy communities up there, but there too much to do here before Dade and I follow him anywhere.  I have to go through all of mine, Dade's, and John's stuff and decide what is most important to take with us and what we can leave stored here.  I have at least six months to get this done.  It will probably take six months to do it.  I guess in a way that it is good that I have lost contact with everyone from high school.  Now I don't have worry about missing anyone.  The thing I am worried about most is that we are going to follow him and then he'll be called to war.  I don't think I could handle moving miles away from home, then him be called away from me to go fight and possibly die.  I am not sure how to feel about anything or what to think any more.  I wish I had other Navy wives to talk to.  Well, I need to check on Dade.  He's napping.  Later!"

"event","John was able to come home on the 20th of this month.  He graduated from basic and was able to come home with me.  His parents, Dade, and I went up on the 19th and stayed in a hotel about three miles from base.  It was very interesting.  It was different being on base.  But I have to get used to it.  John decided that after his six years, he may stay in and go for the officers' program.  I am not sure if I want him to or not.  I think I do but I know he will enjoy it.  He seems to be enjoying the Navy so far.  And he looks incredibly sexy in his uniform.  He has to be back at the base by midnight on the 5th.  We are taking him back on the 4th.  He was told right before the graduation that he will be one of the first ones sent after he graduates from his A-school in June.  I hope he is not sent to war.  Two months without him was hard enough.  If he is gone longer I will go crazy.  I have decided that I will follow him wherever I am able to.  I finally heard from Steph the day before we went to go get John.  She sounds like she is happy, and I am happy for her.  She called me this past week and told me that she is two months pregnant.  I am not sure if I should be happy or not.  We had always hoped that our children would grow up together, but I know they won't.  They may never get to know each other.  Sometimes I wish everything could go back to the way it was before I graduated from high school.  Except for Dade.  I definitely want him to be part of my life.  I just everything to be simple again and John to always be there.  I watched the movie ""WE WERE SOLDIERS"" the other day.  That movie is so realistic and can happen again.  I never realized what being a military wife meant.  I'm scared with no one to talk to."

I am working a lot making good pay.  I am lucky to have a good friend that I can call to talk to and to hang out with.  Without my son and that special friend, I think I would go crazy.  I never thought it would be this hard to be away from John.  Susan (my boss) is keeping me quite busy though.  She keeps sending me to Carmel and Fishers.   Or she has me work alone in Avon.  I get to go to Fishers tomorrow.   Wednesday or Thursday I recieved my first letter from John.  He said he is doing okay but really misses Dade and me.  I can't wait for him to come home.  I miss sleeping by his side every night.  I have to settle with having my dog sleep at my feet instead.  I write to John every night.  I am having Dade's pictures taken almost every week so that I can keep sending them to John so that he can see how fast Dade is growing.  Which is quite fast.  At least Dade remembers his daddy when he sees a picture.  I am going to go shower."

He left the airport at 2:15 Tuesday afternoon.  I am waiting to receive a phone call or a letter with his address.  It has only been two days, but I am so lonely.  I miss him more than I thought I would.  The only thing helping me is my son, work, and church.  If I have free time, then I start thinking about John.  Since he left I have only cried once.  Everything reminds me of him.  Movies, songs, couples in stores.  I don't know how I will handle the next two months.  My mom doesn't like me doing things with my male friends while John is gone, even though he has no problem with it.  She makes me feel like I am cheating on John even though I am just going out to have fun.  She makes me feel like I am a bad wife and mother.  I am a great mother and I am being the best wife possible.  Am I wrong in doing things with male friends while John is away?  Maybe I am."

I should find out within the next week if they are going to call me back for a second interview.  I hope so.  Recently I was ""reunited"" with a friend.  I am glad that I am able to talk to him again.  Since we have been reunited I am able to talk to him unlike before.  This gives me something else to look forward to.  It also lets me know I have someone to talk to about personnal things once my husband leaves.  Unfortunately I lost a best friend in the process.  But that is not really anybody's fault either.  This weekend I found out I had a ""secret admirer"" of a sort.  That was interesting.  It makes some great fantasies.  Now I have two guys to fantasize about.  This weekend I was able to show my son off to my husband's family.  We went to John's grandma's house for a Labor Day get together.  Then wwe went down to my grandpa's barn in Geneva.  Monday we went bowling with my mom, brother, his girlfriend, two of her friends, and John's brother.  I have learned to never bowl with Aaron.  He got a score of 200 in one of the games.  But it was fun so I don't mind too much.  This Saturday we are hoping to go to the Air Show."

"event","I really should update this more often.  I am happy to report that 1) John and I are going to have a little boy named Dade Quenton (unless I can talk John into the name Jonathan Patrick) and 2) Grandma is still alive and is proud of the fact that she is going to be the Great-grandmother to a boy.  Though she is still alive, she is giving up and knows she is going to die soon.  She no longer eats or drinks very much.  They put her on an IV drip for dehydration.  I am worried that she is putting herself through more pain than is necessary.  If she goes into the hospital, she will be dead in a week.  She has a living will and already plans on going into the hospital to die.  I am just glad that she knows that the baby is a boy.  Mom said that when Grandma dies she is going to buy a bouquet that has 8 pink roses for her kids, 13 purple roses for her grandkids, and 1 blue rose for Dade.  I go to the doctor tomorrow so they can see if I have gained any weight.  Since I have become pregnant, I have lost several pounds and am not gaining to make up for it.  They put me on Boost to see if it helps.  I don't know what they will do if I still haven't gained.  John dragged me to see Lord of the Rings twice, so I am dragging him to see Kate & Leopold.  Although I am not the only one dragging my fiance to see that movie.  Right Steph?!  Actually, Lord of the Rings really wasn't that bad.  It's time for me to shower.  Bye!"

"event","A lot has changed since the last time I wrote.  Uncle Jack has finally finished the shed so we can put the stuff from the basement of Grandma's house into it so Mom and Josh can move in.  Grandma is doing a lot worse though.  When she went to the doctor Wednesday, they said they think the cancer is growing.  They did an x-ray, but won't get the results until Wednesday.  They said if the cancer has spread, then they will stop the chemo because it won't work.  She will have to be on a permenant morphine drip to relieve the pain.  We may be having Christmas with her in the next two weeks because she won't live until Christmas.  It upsets me that she has to die now.  I know how much she was looking forward to seeing her first Great-grandchild.  She may not even get to know what sex the child is.  I am not supposed to have the next ultrasound for another three or four weeks.  That was when we were supposed to find out what sex the baby is.  Maybe we can get it done earlier.  I need to call the doctor anyway to see if they can do something about the pain next to my lower left hip bone and the pain in both hips.  The only time I seem to be completely out of pain is when I have just slept for several hours and have not moved yet.  Only five and a half more months and I can go back to heavy pain relievers, like my 800 mg of ibuprofen.  The good thing right now is that I am almost done Christmas shopping.  I would go into detail about some of the gifts, but to many people I have bought for read these.  (Steph, when you read this, call me!!  A.S.A.P.!!!  I have a question about Brett.  Plus we already got one gift for him you were considering.)  My brother thinks he has found true love with the girl he is dating.  They are already talking about marriage and kids and they are only 16&15.  I really hope it works out for him.  I would hate to see him hurt by Katherine.  I can only hope she is nothing like her brother.  I dated her brother Ken our sophomore year.  It didn't last very long.  But Josh's and Katherine's seems to be great.  He went over to her house the day after Thanksgiving to help decorate the tree.  That is what John and I are going to do her at his house as soon as he gets the tree set up.  I am hoping to put up my trees soon.  I have a six foot tree for the living room and a three foot tree for the dining room table.  Yesterday Mom bought me an ornament that has two penguins.  One is the dad and the other is a pregnant mom.  On the stomach of the mom there is an arrow pointing down to the word baby.  On the hats are mine and John's names.  I thought it was a cute ornament and very sweet of my mom to buy it for us.  My dad keeps becoming more and more of a jerk.  I wish I could just tell him to get out of our lives, but Mom won't allow it.  It is time for me to go help John decorate the tree. Bye!"

My mom and brother are packing everything up to put it in a storage shed until they can move in to my Grandma's house.  Grandma is doing much better.  The doctors said that the cancer isn't shrinking, but it isn't growing either.  They say she may still have another six months to a year.  I am so happy.  She may live long enough to hold her first great-grandchild.  I can't wait to find out what sex the baby is.  I went to the hospital Monday because the doctor thought I was having a miscarriage, but when they did the ultrasound they said the baby is fine.  I saw the baby move his arms and legs and could see the heart beating.  I should be able to hear the heartbeat really soon.  Grandma can't wait.  Today we bought a home device to listen to the heartbeat.  If Grandma dies before the baby is born, then I am going to put the ultrasound in her casket.  But it looks like she will be around a lot longer.  She has been feeling well enough to go to the zoo and malls and out to eat every day.  By the end of next week Brett and Steph should be able to start moving in.  It should be fun having my husband, baby, best friend and her husband, and me all living in the same house.  But my husband won't be there too long.  John went Monday to sign all the paperwork and Wednesday for the physical to join the Navy.  He leaves June 25 for boot camp.  I am not looking forward to that.  At least I will have Steph there to help me with the baby and housework.  Steph, Brett, and I all went trick-or-treating Wednesday.  It was quite fun.  Most the people gave us weird lloks for being three adults out for candy with no children.  But next year I will have my baby to take around.  Last night my brother, John, and I went out to dinner and then to see 13 Ghosts.  That movie is good.  Tonight John is making supper for me and then we are going to see From Hell.  My dad called today to tell us that he broke his rib yesterday at work.  He says we don't know what pain is until we have broken a rib.  I can't wait to tell him that he doesn't know what pain is until he delivers a child, but I must wait until I have the child.  But every woman he complains to will tell him that.Steph and I are hoping to do something special for our guys next weekend.  I have to get a hold of her to see if we can still work it out.  (Steph, when you see this, call me.)  I'm going to go see how John is doing with the chili.  Later."

"event","I am not thinking about Deb and Kaliya as much now.  Everyone is keeping me too busy.  My mom and Grandparents are going crazy buying and making stuff for the baby.  My Grandma is going to make a lot of clothes and things for the baby.  She knows this is the only great-grandchild she gets to spoil.  Mom took me shopping Saturday for the baby.  I think I am going to find out what sex the baby is so everyone will stop bugging me.  Grandma wants to know so she can make clothes specifically for the baby.  Everyone hopes the baby is a boy.  I told my dad yesterday about the baby.  He wasn't too happy.  He said he expected that and and the fact that John and I want to get married.  We've been talking about marriage for over a year.  I don't want anyone to think that we are getting married because I am pregnant.  I just don't think we will be able to talk John's dad into allowing a marriage before John turns 18.  Mom and Grandma and John all want to go with me to my doctor's appointment Wednesday.  Grandma can't wait to see an ultrasound of the baby.  She  fears she won't live long enough to see the baby.  I fear she is right.  John got the pictures back from the Homecoming Dance.  I look very pregnant in them.  But they still look good.  My parents will be delighted to have them.  Steph, I will give you a big and small picture. My mom wants to go out Sunday to celebrate my pregnancy.  I am going to try to convince her to allow John to go.  Tomorrow Mom is going to go and put me on the lease so I can have the apartment when she moves down to Greenwood.  Grandma's brother is supposed to be selling the house to Mom.  She said that I can have Steph and Brett move in with me if they want.  But it may not be for a month or two.  I hope it is sooner.  I am going to go so I can spend time with him.
Lamia"

"event","Lately I have been thinking a lot about Debra and Kaliya.  I wish I had not found out about Kaliya, but since I had to know, I wish it had been John that told me, not Debra.  I also wish he had not waited a month to tell me.  Since he waited so long, why couldn't he have just kept it between him and Debra.  I will probably not ever meet the girl and I am not sure John will either.  Why did I have to find this out just after finding out I am carrying John's second child.  I am probably wrong for thinking this, but I am hurt about Debra being the mother of John's first child.  I thought that since I am his fiance, that I should be the only mother of his children.  Especially his first, but Debra has that priviledge.  She got such joy froom being the one to tell me that she has a child by John.  She was waiting to see me break down or cry or something, but I refused to let her know my hurt and dissappointment.  I think her main objective was to start a fight between me and John.  And she almost succeeded, just not so she would see.  I have been spending too much time thinking about this.  This morning I was up until 5:00 thinking about Kaliya.  I even watched my favorite movie, Labyrinth, and could not shake the thoughts of Kaliya being a product of John having sex with Debra.  I fear I am being to jealous. On to a better subject.  One thing I have to remember to make sure I am not the only girl from my group at a football game.  I went with John to the game tonight against Carmel, which we won 38-3.  Five other of my male friends were there.  Everyone made sure I stayed as warm as possible in rain and wind and cold temperature.  Stick used John's umbrella as a wind block for us and several of them kept running to the bathroom to use the hand dryers as hand warmers.  All this after teasing me about being weak and getting cold.  But I did not have the extra padding to keep me as warm as most of the others have.  Iwent to see my Grandma and Great-Grandma today.  They were so happy to see me.  Grandma is hoping to live long enough to see at least an ultrasound of my baby, but she would prefer to see the baby after he is born.  Everybody is hoping that I have a boy.  I will be happy either way.  John told his dad today that I am pregnant.  He took better than we thought he would.  I don't know when John will tell his mom.  Hopefully tomorrow.  I am going to tell my dad Sunday afternoon.  It is late  so I am going to take my pills and go to bed.  John, if you read this, I am really sorry if any of it hurt you.  We need to talk.  I love you so much, my angel.

"event","WOW!  This week has been full of news and events.  To start off, Monday John had a choir concert for MIC.  We were at the school for several hours for that.  There were eight or ten different schools there to sing one song together.  What they sang was all in Latin.  I was able to sing along.  Who says Latin doesn't come in handy outside of class.  Yesterday Steph called so she and Brett could come over and hang out.  We ordered pizza and the guy got lost.  He went to his house to call to see where Josh's house is.  OK!  Today I had a doctor's appointment with an OB/GYN. They put me on two more medicines for my cold.  They said they are not sure, but I may have complications with the birth because of my scoliosis. We'll have to deal with it as it all comes.  I don't know what I would do if I lost this baby.  I finally told my mom yesterday.  She was more understanding than I thought she would be.  They told me when I went in that I am closer to seven weeks than six.  They took six vials of blood form me.  I also found out today that John and his ex-girlfriend have a child together that is a little over a year old.  He wants to be part of her life.  Debra is not sure if he can see his daughter, Kaliya. Like I said, already an eventful week.  I'll write more later.

"event","Earlier I was sitting in front of my daddy's computer thinking about how much I love my gorgeous angel.  Now I am by his side waiting for him to fall asleep. I love watching him sleep.  I realized this when we were in Pennsylvania over Labor Day.  He is the sweetest guy I have ever found.  If only I could get him to believe that.  He thinks he is a prick, yet everyone else thinks he is sweet.  That is my only complaint about him- the way he puts himself down all the time.  If he was such a prick, why would almost all of our female friends wish he was theirs or wish to fuck his brains out?  I don't know what I would do without him.  He has made my life worthwhile.  There is so much good stuff about him that he does not even realize that other people realize.  Why is that?  One thing I have to wonder about though is- is it a good idea to move in with his ex that we are both friends with?  She says she does not want him back and that she is trying to help us stay together.  Is it wise to trust her?  If I do, it gives me a place to live and some place I can feel safe with the baby when the baby comes.  If I don't, then I am still stuck with a guy I can't stand until I can save up the money to get a place of my own.  Brett, I am sure you will have some input here.  Life is very confusing right now.  I hope John and I can find a way to get parental permission for him to get married next month.  How do I convince my perfect man that he is perfect?  There is only one another that reminds me of him.  We also need to figure out a way to tell our parents.  His will be the worst to tell.  I can escape mine, he can't.  He is still underage.  ""Well, I just heard the news today.""  I really wish there was something I could do for my Grandma.  She is dying of lung cancer.  She has really missed me the past three weeks.  That's how long it has been since I have been out there.  My mom said she is getting worse.  Plus my Great-Grandma is in a nursing home now.  Thinking about them upsets me.  Another big fear and worry on my mind is that I feel this baby I am carrying is going to kill me or itself.  Sometimes I feel that my body is not strong enough to handle both of us.  I go to the prenatal doctor Wednesday.  I am scared and excited about going.  I'm going to go wake up John now.  Later."

"event","I know it hasn't been that long since the last one, but I got bored.  I got to thinking about this past week and what I am to do in the next few.  This past week I was in Ohio.  We left on Sunday afternoon and came back Wednesday night.  A usually six hour drive took nine.  The guy driving pissed off everyone in the car.  I realized over the past week how much I love my boyfriend/fiance.  I cannot wait until next month to get married.  It was fun in Ohio.  I got to meet two of my best friend's cousins.  I didn't have fun with her fosterbrother though.  He was the one that pissed everyone off all week.  It was kind of hard for me to see Steph and Brett together all week.  My boyfriend was stuck here because of school.  Steph and Brett remind me so much of John and me.  Steph finally has someone good for her whom she loves dearly who loves her the same.  I am finally just as lucky.  What bothers me is how people say that we are all too young to know what love is and that we are too young to get married.  I don't feel that way.  I feel that if you an dhte person you love can last through anything, no matter what it is, than you have true love.  Not many people are willing to stick around when things get rough.  Yet Steph and I have found guys who have.  Her uncle said he would marry us when we come back down to Ohio.  I am hoping we can do the ceremony on the beach of Lake Erie.  I have to talk it over with Steph and Brett since it is supposed to be a double wedding.  I don't know if they will like the idea.  John does though.  We talked about it today at the orchard.  I can't wait to show John the beach.  It is very beautiful during sunset.  Also with the sun setting on downtown Cleveland.  There are two different places on the beach where we could have the wedding if the others go for it.  Gotta go.  Time to eat."

"event","Ashe just got me set up on this.  About time.  Today we went with our Sunday School class to Anderson Apple Orchard in Mooresville.  It was fun.  Josh kept threatening to throw John out of the van.  It was an interesting trip with two pregnant women along.  I go Wednesday to my first prenatal appointment.  I found out on the thirteenth that I am pregnant.  I don't know if I should find out what gender it is before the birth or not.  I will decide it soon.  I can't wait to go shopping for the baby.  I hoping to soon get an apartment with some of my friends.  That will be fun. I hope.  A week ago I got my eyebrow pierced.  It still hurts a bit, especially if it is hit or pulled.  When it heals in three weeks I am going to get a new earring in it.  Does anyone know a good place to get baby stuff and maternity clothes?  Soulchaser, tell Chainsawdurden and Losergirl about this if you can.  Gotta go."

"event","So, I have friend, that some time ago had the archangel Gabriel appear to her in her bedroom. I cannot remember the specifics. But I thought that was amazing.
I always had a belief in angels, which is odd, cuz when I was young I never believed in ""God"". Christian-wise anyway.

What does this have to do with anything? Well, I will tell you.
Other than practicing the Lesser Banishing Ritual a number of times, I never really had that much to do with the Archangels...my mind was occupied with other things before now. 

A few months back, I was meditating and I came upon a grove, I was just sort of placed there...I didn't picture it intentionally. I was there walking around the trees for a while when suddenly, I spotted a cloaked figure a few feet in front of me. I could barely see the man's face, but I could distinguish that he had long brown hair. He told me, I remember it being telepathically, ""Do not be afraid, I am not here to harm you.""
I say, ""Who the hell are you?""
And the man says, in a rather calm voice, ""Raphael.""
I go on, ""Raphael? I don't know any Raphael! Who ARE you?""

I snapped out of the meditation.

Ever since then, he's been following me everywhere.
Almost every spiritual place that I have gone, he can be found, or I will think of him.
I went to this shamanic healing circle back in June, that is where I found out about the Archangel meditation circle. Later on, after the ritual, I came across some books. The first one I laid eyes on said, ""Raphael"". They were all books on the archangels and this was the first time I had ever really SEEN these books in this shop. I took it as a sign and spent the last bit of cash I had on it.
It was worth the read.
They say Raphael watches over healers and that he is the angel of healing.
I have been told many times that I am a healer, I just need to learn to focus my energies more.
They also say he is the one who brings the breeze/winds in the evening... Weird, because I always felt like the wind was telling me something around that time. It could be windy any other part of the day and I wouldn't think anything of it, but it's always at night I find that it has some meaning. A LOT of meaning. I just wish I could learn to listen so I can hear what he is telling me.

That is all."

"event","I just saw the same damn type of UFO I did in December of 2005. 
No, I saw TWO of them this time.
The only difference was this time...they were not flashing different colors. Although, one was indeed pulsating, it was about a football field off the handle of the Big Dipper. 
The other one which was off to the south, glowing red, tracing the same type of patterns as the former.
This is very exciting!
I called my father and told him about it, he looked out into the sky, but there was too much light and he could not see anything. 
So, I went to my next best option, Google. Yes, Google.... And I have found a PLETHORA on these ""UFOs disguised as stars"". Message board after message board, FILLED with the same fucking thing I have seen. Unbelievable!
The only was I can prove that I am not insane is well, telepathy. I told them with my mind ""Move your ship in a circle."", they did so. I said, ""Move in a square."" ""Make a cross."" All of which they did.
They were also tracing some sort of patterns in the sky...or maybe they were letters?? I have no idea, I just kept telling them I didn't understand. 
Oddly enough, it almost felt like ""home"". Familiar.
We have a bit of conversation - mind to mind. Fantastic. 
I just can't believe this happened AGAIN. Same thing times TWO!!
And I know it was no fucking satellite of the ISS. They move in an orbit...these were simply moving. Last I checked satellites or the ISS do not/CANNOT move in this way.

I came upon the comforting feeling they were watching me or OVER me. That had been keeping track. Their curiosity sparks so much interest in me, I hope I can sleep tonight..this is so exciting!!!

EDIT; 

I have come across an entry in my old LJ that describes what went on that night, Dec. 1, 2005. Seems like it was very rushed, but I was probably on my way to work or bed.

Encounter 1
____________________

So we packed up to go to this lake out in Marlborough to watch the sunrise.
We get there around 4am and set our stuff up on the beach out there and look at the stars. We talked about music and constellations.
I kept seeing shooting stars. I saw about 4 or 5.
I noticed this star in the sky that seemed to be very bright and twinkling. John noticed it and thought it was the north star, but I said, ""No, that shit is moving."" and he gets up almost immediately and goes, ""What the fuck is that!?""
So we're looking at this shit and it's HOVERING in the sky swaying from side to side and then looping. Meanwhile there are these multicolored lights flashing.

I should inject this bit of info: When we first got there I was looking at the sky and I said, ""I want aliens!"" Or something like that...and John asks, ""Why?"" and I said, ""Why not?""

So anyways, he was basically like...You just HAD to say something, didn't you? LOL

ALSO, before we left his apartment he said, ""If you want someone to remember you, you have to give them a night they'll never forget, so will you remember me?""

So he had to comment on that as well...""And what did I say before we left tonight? I will never forget this night, I will never forget you."" And then he hugs me for what seemed like the longest time.

And how could we? We saw a fucking UFO!!!
We were scared as fuck.
He's telling me, ""I've never believed [in aliens] until tonight.""
This was followed by the very popular subject simply known as: The End of the World.

I called Kim at like 4:30ish in the morning and woke her up and basically went all manic to her on the phone about it, poor thing lol. I let her go eventually because John was harrassing me to get off the phone cuz he wanted to call the police and get in the papers.
I was like John, no. You're crazy and stupid. They'll put you back in the hospital.
And he's like, Yeh they probably will.

So we did get a state trooper out there because we were scared to death to walk anywhere.
We gave him a report of what we saw and got back into John's car and got some breakfast in Glastonbury.

I'm going to leave this off here, because I need to get some sleep.
I'll update tomorrow about later on today. If that makes any sense.

--- What was not mentioned was this fucking state trooper asshole was basically like ""What you saw was probably a weather balloon or a radio tower"" REALLY??? Radio towers MOVE now????

I've included a link on the Google search...TONS of info..
http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread509567/pg1 
one message board pertaining this phenomena

LAST EDIT, I SWEAR;
Just went back outside for the last time. I can't see the first one anymore, it is currently behind a tree. 
The red one though, is now flashing different colors and circling, zig-zagging. Beautiful."

"event","I recently found out that the man I saw in all black wearing a wide brim hat at the foot of my bed has a name. I also found out that...I AM NOT CRAZY, he really WAS there, because all these other people saw it.
BUT..What I don't understand is, why the majority say he/it is evil or negative. I never got that once. A little creeped out, yes, because he would just stand and stare. As much as it bothered me then and as much as I tried to ignore it, his presence was very obvious. But he never once hurt me, and I don't think he ever intended to. After a while of living with and talking to this thing (with no response) I finally began to understand that maybe he was protecting me. I believe that now. It was like he was watching over me.
I remember one night I told him to please stop standing at the foot of my bed because it really bothered me.
Next thing I know, he's standing just before the head of my bed just out of my line of sight.

It's like Greg said, ""People think anything associated with the color black is evil, shadow people are basically harmless."""

"event","I think I was trying to astrally project, but we all know when I try to AP it doesn't happen and I end up going into a deep meditation.
This time it was just flat-out interrupted.

Let's back-track a little...
A couple months ago, I had meditated into this desert in Arizona. There, I had talked to this Native American cheif, this cheif was also a shaman. I talked to him and told him that I wanted to be trained as a shaman, when I move out there. He told me to come back when I had more energy [I was very tired at the time], he said, then I will train you.
Well, I never actually went back...because this thing called life came into the picture.

So now we're back at a month or so ago and I'm trying to AP and this guy just comes right into my space and holds his hand out to me and says, ""Come with me."" So I take his hand and we're back in the desert.
I can't really remember what we talked about at first.
I remember the coyotes coming up to us and him telling me to pet them.
He said, ""You're lesson in this life is Trust. If you do not have trust you live in fear. Learn to trust. Pet the coyote.""
I reached my hand out and the dog snarled and bit me. 
The man says, ""Try again.""
And I do. This process continues for what seems like ten minutes and the whole time he keeps telling me to pet it.
""HOW CAN I PET SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS TRYING TO BITE ME!?""
He says, ""What are you so scared of? You're in spirit form, he cannot hurt you. Trust him, he will not hurt you."" 
Then he continues on to say that the only reason the coyote is biting and snarling at me is because he can smell my fear. As long as I continue to fear, people will always walk all over me and as long as I continue to fear people will attack me.
<b>They only attack when they smell fear.</b>

He tells me again that this is my lesson in life. To overcome fear and to trust unconditionally. No matter how many times I've been back-stabbed.
""This is your path.""

Suddenly, it's pitch black and it's only us talking.
When I can see again, there's a campfire and a tent. I see two people sitting by the fire, roasting marshmallows and talking. I look at these people and it is John and Josh.
I ask the cheif, ""What are they doing here?""
He replied, ""These are kindred spirits put here to help you along the way.""
If this is true, then it's already happened. -__-
Ok, Sid, you're stupid. It must be true because it already happened. That's a more accurate statement.
John's music and his message have already helped me out a lot and him as a person has already helped me to understand so many things.

That's when things began to get shaky and I couldn't concentrate anymore. I told him I had to leave.
I waved to John and Josh, they waved back.

And there I was, back in my room."

"event","I took an Ambien the other night. Just for kicks. Ambien seems to open up a lot of doors in your psyche. 
So anyways, I was tripping and painting with watercolors, not really painting anything, but just splatting here and there and rubbing the brush in circles. When I was finally done, it looked like a blue alien coming out of a colorful egg. Nevermind this was in bright/happy/pastelish colors. It was so pretty, yet grim.
Even my mother said it looked like an alien. I'm not going crazy, good.

Has anyone been having problems with telepathy lately? I don't know what it is, if this is even considered telepathy.
BUT, I was spacing out while looking at my wallpaper (on my comp. desktop) and suddenly I was in a sort of trance. I couldn't snap out of it. I was sent all of these images I could not comprehend (I knew they meant something, but couldn't figure out what). Felt as if something was penetrating my fifth eye. I really don't like this feeling at all. I'm looking out my window at the house down my street as I type. I think it's coming from there. Or from that direction.
Telepathy is a bitch."

"event","This one took place at one of my favorite places to meditate, a zen garden.
<hr>

I began in the back of the garden, as usual, on top of a small mound. Monks were raking the sand garden. I picked up a rake and began raking the third box in the first row (there are six boxes of sand in two rows). I looked around and noticed that the monks were not there.
I took my friend Ryan's hand and we walked around to the back of the building (that is right in front of the sand boxes), my guide David was not there. The [plant] garden is empty. We begin to walk down the walkway, noticing the benches and the trees. Suddenly Nora Jones appeared and we could hear her music.
Steps appear and we walk down them.
The 2nd step, a scorpion appears. I pick it up and it crawls up my right arm, then it stings me. I'm in pain and Ryan tries to suck the poison out and blows this positive energy into it and it heals. The scorpion is thrown out into the field.
We come to the bottom of the steps and there is this black-hooded figure. We look at him curiously and I go to take another step and the ground falls out from under me. I'm hanging on with my right hand screaming to Ryan. He grabs my hand and pulls me up a little, then the fround falls out from under him and now he's hanging, somehow he bails us both out.
I say, ""Jesus Christ, what's going on here?""
Then Jesus appears in the field on our right.
The entity opens its mouth and this sparkly bluish black energy comes out of it.
Jesus, has a golden light coming out from his third eye.
This energy penetrates the entity and blows him apart.
I run to hima and say, ""Jesus, thank you for watching out for me!"" and I hug him
He puts his hand on my head and then puts his arm around my shoulders.
Ryan walks up to us and says, ""Hey, I thought I was Jesus.""
Jesus: ""Ha, yeh right.""
I thank him again and he says, ""No problem.""
I ask what the entity was all about....he tells me it was a demon (not a daemon) in all sense of the word. Again, NOT a daemon. A demon, in its truest blackest form.
He tells me they're after me.
I ask, ""Why?""
He tells me not to worry, none of them will get to me with him in their way.
I come out of it.
<hr>

Explanation: I am in NO way religious and I'm not even sure if Jesus Christ even existed. But if he did, he came into my meditation, either/or it was another spirit pretending to be him...spirits are good at imitating.
The thing is my dad believes in Jesus Christ very much and is very spiritual. So either his prayers reached me through Jesus or a spirit through the form of Jesus. Thanks to my dad, I have uber protection.
I really doubt it was Jesus though. But it was a being of light."

"event","This is undated, and written very basic, so bare with me.
I think I did this meditation somewhere back in December.
It was a whacky ride.
<hr>

Journey into the Abyss/Underworld/Void

Long, dark tunnels consisting of a bluish black liquid. It was kind of like a rotating tunnel, you could see the water moving, but the tunnel ground itself was not moving, so you could walk safely on it.
Went down the first tunnel, ran into a huge purple octupus, he whipped his tentacle around me and asked me where I was going and why I was there.
I told him.
Walked to the end of the tunnel and came to a burrowed tunnel made of dirt. I take a left and come to a passage of tunnels, I head for the last tunnel on the right, I'm shot to its entrance.
I go down a little ways and I reach my cloud (it's actually a huge white mass that cleanses you before you go into a meditation). I talk with it a little, walk through it. I hear a gentle humming sound. I keep walking till I come to an opening, I look down and it's a vast cavern, a huge metropolis of some sorts. Millions of lights all around the walls, most of these are homes. The homes/areas of actually carved out of the walls, so beings are actually living in the wall itself.
These jet-type thing keep zooming around, one stops in front of me. I told the driver to take me to Ereshkigal.
I'm taken from the my position at almost the highest ledge, to the very bottom in front a huge opening.

Two guards with spears guard the entrance.
They ask me what I am doing here/Why am I here/Why I wish to see her.
I explain that she had been telling me to.
They ask for my hoodie, I give it to them, I am past the first gate.
The same situation happens six more times, until I end up naked, beyond the seventh and final gate.

Ereshkigal sits on a grey throne with a massive crown of silver, mirror-like jewels. Also within it are black or red jewels.
We discuss Isis, trust issues.
I tell her how much I admire her. She tells me how much she admires me.
Beautiful smile, very powerful.
She weakened my aura quite a bit.
Or maybe out of fear I might've done something to it."

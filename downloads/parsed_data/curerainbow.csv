"event","Well, as of this past wednesday I am finished with the animation portion of 5683

Yup, every episode has been animated. some stuff for the theme song will have to be made I'm sure, but that has yet to be recorded so I don't know yet!

Also, I have a release date planned! instead of premiering in 2008 like i originally planned, 5683 will actually premier on January 10th, 2009. episodes will premier on my website (www.mattimation.piczo.com) and then move to YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/user/Mattimati0n) and DeviantArt (www.mattimationFILMS.deviantart.com) the following week. 

as for Thanks a Latte, that's been put on hold for now. it will be picked up again soon, but nothing's for sure yet."

"event","Mattimation has broadened its sights. as of today, a band to be signed to ""mattimation records"" has begun to form. the band, which currently has no name, will perform all songs in the upcoming productions of ""5683"" and ""Thanks a Latte."" currently it consists of Kristina Wilson, who's song ""Simple Girl"" was featured in ""the Miracle Project"", and Tom Quinlan, who will appear in both of Mattimation's current productions. other possible band mates are Shae Peebs, who played Gargwal in Miracle Project, and yours truely. Another girl may be added to the group, but nobody has been brought to my attention yet."

"event","<p>Yup, the possible new movie I talked about just a few days ago is now officially happening. the film, entitled Thanks a Latte, will be loosely based off of the first comic i ever wrote of the same name. it will also feature characters members of my family made up as friends for the main character. this short film will be entirely live action with minimal animation, though some special effects. The decision to make a movie based off of the comic was made this past saturday, and a script has allready been written and the movie has allready been cast. a finalizing the script is now in the works, which may mean more characters to cast, but aside from that filming will hopefully start ASAP.&nbsp;<br /><br />look for trailers or promotional art for the movie soon, as I'm very excited for this. I will also be continuing 5683 while working on Thanks a Latte, just at the same time. </p>"

"event","Hello all...yes...all three of you who are friends with me here. lol. I havn't posted anything here in a while, so I just thought I'd update you all on 5683.&nbsp;

As of thursday, episode 3 is fully animated. Episode one is also fully dubbed over, except for one character who has been cast. there are also some casting updates. Marguerite McCartney's love interest and grandmother have both now been cast. Mattimation new comers Katherine W. and Tom Q. will be lending their voices for these characters. both will appear in episode 3. Shae P, the man who played Gargwal in Miracle Project, will be voice acting again. He will play the heart attacks, which are the monsters in the series. He will also be producing the music for the series. Kristina W, Veve in 5683 and Hillary in Miracle Project, will also have her music involved as well. she's agreed to let me use songs from her CD as background music in some scenes. I'm planning on asking her to sing the theme song as well, but it's too soon to ask. Production on episode 4 will begin today

Also, I'm toying with the idea of doing another movie this summer. a live action one with little to no animation. It would be based on another one of my old ideas. Not 100% sure which one yet, but I have a good idea. also, my friends and I will be making a comedy series over the summer based off of the idea of the burn book from the movie ""Mean Girls""

anyways, that's the update for right now! Hope you enjoyed it! lol

"event","Yup, he's back and difficult as ever! He said he handled things wrong with the Miracle Project, and this is bad too. He has told me I need to cast the show now and start voice recording ASAP. mind you, there's one episode fully animated and it's not entirely rendered (which basically means saved as a video file). This will probably lead to the changing of a main characters voice sometime through the series, as one of the girls I have in mind is a senior and will probably graduate before the series can end, since Dad said I won't have this done until November.

Well, if you'd excuse me now, I have to work on episode two and cast this show"

"event","<p>Animation for my next project, a loose adaptation of a comic I started a few years ago, has officially started. I don't want to release a lot of information, but I can allready say the animation is much better than Miracle Projects'. I created new models for this mini-series (yes, mini-series), and am letting myself get creative, so the characters will be using a lot more body-language.&nbsp;<br /><br />I will say that it's an 8 episode long magical girl mini-series. Transformation sequences have been completed, and episode one has been started. screen shots will probably start surfacing as soon as February.</p>"

"event","today is the day of total relaxtion and i started that off by waking up at 8:30 taking 2 advil, drinking some water and driving to practice- which was pretty good minus the whole running thing at the end, but whatever. then to continue the day of total relaxation i put an episode of the OC on(cause i got it for christmas) and fell asleep for 2 hours and 15 minutes, it was amazing. then i showered, which i love doing. i watched some more OC and then hung out with amber. we had panos...it was really good. i can only hope to continue the night with more relaxing things! but everyone get ready for new years.

"event","my brother woke me up at 5am to tell me that we didnt have school today, because it was snowing!! i was extremly excited, that meant no basketball game though.. i got up around 10:27 and made myself some pancakes(i think i should be a chef) well whitney came and got me and we went to hannahs all decked out in snow clothing, because no one in burlington is use to snow, so everything closes and everyone puts on all the clothes they own. and we went to wendys then to kellys, where we got her and amber. got some sleds and headed over to willowbrook park, where we sledded down this hill, which was fun until we got this brillant idea to make snowballs, drive around with them, and throw them at children! haha the joys of being 16 on a snowday! we found these kids and drove past them like 30 times and nailed them with snowballs, then i raced to get shotgun after they threw this massive snowhunk at hannahs car and she screamed at them and i fell. yes me, miss graceful. all of us went to hannahs for hot chocolate, mtv, and pizza. oh yeah i forgot sam was with us! haha oops. but i just got out of the shower and ive got to get ready for all the snow parties tonight!"

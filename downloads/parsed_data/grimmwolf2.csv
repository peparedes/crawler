Im paranoid... im a little scared.... 

I'm so close to graduation... then nothing.. a lull in the storm... before I start officially teaching on my own... a class of my own... 


Duluth public schools are so interesting... some of the worst behavior problems i have ever seen... and yet in the chaos a few students come out to be some of the brightest most talented students in the entire nation... How can such opposites exist in one place.... 

If it wasnt for this potential i would probably not want to teach in the area.... 

I am tired of reflecting on my feelings... fuck the person who came up with the concept of a reflection... 

Here's to the next step..."

"event","H'ok... So I have managed to be apart of one of the most bad ass sports on the face of the planet.  Alpine Skiing. Not just skiing down the Hill but racing. I'm not complaining cause it makes for good stories and kick ass times and I must say I'm going to miss the adventures!

Why Alpine racing is so bad ass. 

1. I get up before the sun for each race.
2. I strap myself to two long boards and set it so that I'm most likely going to break my legs before I eject out of my skis
3. I hurtle myself down a hill at about 20-30mph for Slalom at hardened plastic gates and for Giant Slalom or GS if you will it is about 35-45mph
4. I strip down to a GS suit even when the temp drops below zero such as today at about -20F including wind chill and its going to get worse... Coldest I have raced in was when it was -25F without wind chill and with wind chill it was -45 F.

I just don't know what my motivation is to do this but I got it and I love racing even in the coldest of times...

Just some thoughts on what I do...."

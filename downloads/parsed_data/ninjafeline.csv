and the summer in her eyes
shines so bright so promise
flickers up inside you like a wish from faraway
farawhen

i brush the snow from my shoes
lace up and get up and
take her hand again, so silently
two figures, against the wind
two figures, against the northern sky
envelops us fully as it sings 
so full so longing
warms up inside you like a wish from faraway

deep breathe water
and me sitting atop the ocean view
the power lines freshly uncut, and
you sleeping in the wire times with
a head full of songs

we went to the libraries
and we went through the fires
and the doors to the underground opened wide
""come along now, let's go for a ride""
pretty escalators
pretty escalations
and her with the radio mind, always tuning, tuning, tuning, tuning
always changing the station
just when we thought we'd arrived, and
always channeling some new ghost
when all we had was the writing on the wall
wrote it down then, there in the bathrooms
greentile and some mellowing floodlights, I
wrote those names in purplepurple
wrote some good names
right then

so you're going to university, so you're
finally free
and those books will suit you pretty and I
will paint you some lunch
let's sit out here in the grass
let's deep breathe water..."

I am gliding. Co-inciding. I am rising up again.

There's lizardmen crawling along the ceiling and blackcats keeps swishing in and out of cornersight. Cowboyjunkiegirl says she wishes she saw cats. I guess it's a nice kind of trick.

Songs and pictures aren't creations anymore, they're a weed growing, a virus that's spreading cobwebs over my eyes and my mouth and wiring me closer to the deepsea bed of confusion...

like sitting in a cushion den livingfloor smokehouse next to a celebrity tree and three potential flatmates. talking about bbc travelling and china smiles. such a pretty house. many fishies on the ceiling.

danced with two girls. one is my ex and the other i kissed. still strange to think that you'd pull a gay man in a gay club with two lesbian friends. truth or dare has a lot to answer for.

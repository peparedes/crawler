<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">Divine Wisdom. Manifestation. Explanation. Teaching. </font></p>
<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">All things relating to education, patience, help from superiors.The Hierophant is often considered to be a Guardian Angel.</font></p>
<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Hierophant's purpose is to bring the spiritual down to Earth. Where the High Priestess between her two pillars deals with realms beyond this Earth, the Hierophant (or High Priest) deals with worldly problems. He is well suited to do this because he strives to create harmony and peace in the midst of a crisis. The Hierophant's only problem is that he can be stubborn and hidebound. At his best, he is wise and soothing, at his worst, he is an unbending traditionalist. </font></p>

"event","I'm heading out of town and coming back ~29thish-give-or-take to paint the house.  We just picked out paint and I realized I hadn't eaten anything substantial today.  So now I scrounge for food, one hour drive, paint and pack and repair and possibly hang out with Jessica, come back, clean and pack like mad (to condense boxes and stuff to make room for company), host d&d group on Friday, sort like mad, assemble resume for possible job at Sears (sales or security), July 3rd with Jen for fireworks (local park does theirs on the 3rd and some say they're better than the city fireworks), prepare computer parts and art stuff to auction off (to pay off debts and get equipment for resin/pewter casting stuff, and towards trip to Boston mid/late August), and then try to land job and prepare room/workspace for the fall semester.  I'm trying not to be stuck on it but its kind of depressing realizing *what* I have to give up for a chance to be independant and such, scraping by, in a year.  I have a lot of cool stuff that's attached to a lot of dreams...for a week."

"event","Just got back after another trip to pack/fix-up the other house.  95% moved and plenty of painting to do when I go back this weekend.  My sister (who's renting the house) picked out swatches so I have paint shopping to do (Weee!).  

My sleep schedule is fuxored now after a couple days of work/festivities, a 2-hour nap, and a 5am drive back.  I should be fine tonight but I just hope I don't get sick when I'm hanging out with Jess and her friend who's coming out from Boston.  Long story I guess.

On Monday I signed up for Fall classes at CC.  It puts me at 16-credits of art classes so I can finish the fine-arts program over the next year.  Surface anatomy (life drawing), airbrush, printmaking, screen-printing, matting & framing.  I'm not thrilled about having to wait for my Bachelor's but this is the only option right now.  If I can devote the rest of my time to building up sculpture business I might have a shot of being fully independent in a year from now.  Woot!  ..?"

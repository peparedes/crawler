"event","So since I've graduated I've found that I have a ton of free time on my hands. I'm working two part-time jobs = full time. One at an ophthalmolgists and the other doing research at the College of Medicine at USF - all this until I get into med school. Just took the MCAT's again Jan 29th and should be getting the new scores back March 2nd. I'm hoping to get into PCOM-Georgia in Atlanta. I've already interviewed there, they just wanted to see a higher score. Besides that, I really don't have much to do with my time. Ive been playing bass here and there, running, and was planning on getting back in the gym but I've been having some lower back problems. Beer has been a close friend, as have my roommates, and my pretty BA girlfriend, but everyones still in school and busy with all that. 
Not too long ago I picked up the book Mountains Beyond Mountains by a fellow named Tracy Kidder. Its a Pulitzer Prize Winning book, and an amazing story about Dr. Paul Farmer who does some incredible things for health and society in Haiti. I'm only on page 102, but an anecdote early on grabbed my attention. Its telling the story of a very sick 13 year old girl brought to the doorstep of his clinic in the middle of the night. A spinal tap needs to be done to confirm her strain of meningitis - a very painful procedure. During the procedure, Farmer translates the Hatian - ""She's crying 'It hurts, I'm hungry.' Can you believe it? Only in Haiti would a child cry out that she's hungry during a spinal tap."" That was a pretty deep moment when I read that. It makes you want to do more for people, although I could never begin to do the things this man has done. The guy's a saint.
Anyway, off to some Olympic watching now."

Part of me is looking forward to a month home and the other is wishing i could just stay off on my own. at least i have the apartment to myself for the next few days..."

"event","mazen and i had this brilliant idea to bring back lj but im not sure how successful thats going to be. Anyways...life in a nutshell, so to speak, for the last month or so of my life. 

Classes are all going pretty well, organic still tended to blow my mind but i was hanging in there. My job at moffitt as a valet was working out just fine, and I was starting to talk to this girl whom i met through my friend meghan. We went to halloween horror nights one night a while back, and ever since things have been going great. I think what attracts me to her is that shes so damn sweet and seems to take everything in life as it comes. Down to earth, gorgeous, caring, more of a smart ass than me, fun, random, smart, intriguing...i dont know if i could ask for more as of right now. Fast forward a week or so..saw Circa Survive in concert, amazing. Lifes going good...then one wednesday at work i lock a set of keys in the ignition. They call a locksmith, get it all situated w/i an hour and everythings fine. Little stressful, nothing serious. Then my glasses break randomly. Okay, no big deal. Then i find out insurance doesnt kick in until the  beginning of the year. great. thankyou superglue. Friday comes, some lady plows into a car im valeting. I get blamed. great. My anthro professor then decides to move his exam right before my organic exam. I spend ALL weekend studying. literally. probablly close to 25hrs. Take my anthro test, then organic...the hardest test of my life. i swear to you. i head back to my apt after the test just amazed at some of the questions he asked, and then my manager calls. tells me his boss called down and told him to let me go. theres my job. whos gonna hire me w/ 2wks left of classes? i have bills...but no job..and no money. then i find out i pulled a D+ on that test. all this was about a week ago. this past weeks turned up a bit though. No exams, no job, no respnsibility. Came home, nice thanksgiving dinner, Thrice concert, old friends. I think im learning to be more optimistic as life goes on. Shit happens, you deal, and you keep moving on. Weeks of hell only make you a tougher person in the end, although at the time tend to break you down and make you question your life.

Thrice was amazing, btw."

 Based on the term ""skeet"", which is defined as the act of ejaculating on a partner after sex. Skeet slapping is the act of slapping a sheet, piece of clothing, or other absorbent material down on the skin that has been skeeted upon. The semen then acts as an adhesive, holding the material to the skin and leaving even bolder evidence of one's conquest.

""Man, she said she wouldn't swallow, so I busted a nut on her forehead and skeet-slapped her with my sock."""

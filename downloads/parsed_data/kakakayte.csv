Year of the&nbsp;Dragon
&nbsp;People born in the Year of the Dragon are healthy, energetic, excitable, short-tempered, and stubborn. They are also honest, sensitive, brave, and they inspire confidence and trust. Dragon people are the most eccentric of any in the eastern zodiac. They neither borrow money nor make flowery speeches, but they tend to be soft-hearted which sometimes gives others an advantage over them. They are compatible with Rats, Snakes, Monkeys, and Roosters.




Sorry Livi but looks like you are compatible with me.....XD&nbsp;"

Anywhores that is all I really wanted to say and lets be honest its not exactly a *news flash* now is it??


What have I been up to.....

Uh there was the archery Xmas meal which basicallly was amazing, then a shit load of work, then a killer essay, then the medical centre, then shopping with one of the numerous men (i wish) in my life, then a recipt for my fuckoff essay, then more lectures, then the libery, then archery, then tea, then something else *mind wipe probably happened about this time*, then archery social where I managed to pikey the most amazing hat ever.....lol not really bt it is pikeyd so that makes upfor it, then listened to le radio show de le vinals with le guy of the other variety, then fucked about for like an hour and now i am procrastanting so i can actually settle to sleep in a bit....


Uh basicaly that was my day,,, well from the medical centre onward-the other things were all previous events in my life which seem to be all i can remember thanks to sleep deprivation.

Oh and btw Im in love with about 4 people... and i mean if they wanted me anywhere in public i wouldnt have the will power to say no or even go anywhere reasonably secluded..... O dear *knees wobble at the thought*


so basically yeah."

anyways too much sharing there&nbsp;

after a breif lunch it was time for my last ever prizegiving *sob* i do love them really even&nbsp; though they are the most mind numbing experience ever.... much amusing commentry was followed between bakes and myself

then a quick wave to some people- sorry i didnt really have time to say hello

a brief ride, then my hair dresser came and dyed my hair again- yay!!!!

the secind that was washed off my dad the sweetheart drove me all the way back to here, this was followed by much unpacking- a few hugs to celebrate my return.

then all my guys rushed off to get ready for their radio show- shameful lol

i then visited the liberay at the good forsake hour of 11:50

SHAME

came back listened to the radio show- epic fail

sorted out the numberous internet duties I had procrastinated enough to avoid working for yet another night- sucess

managed to make a prat of myself in front of fletcher..... oh well such is life

wozzers this will be be mind numbingly boring to read...

I guess i just wanted to admire the adaptivity of the human brain and how it changes from one thing to anothe and one persona to another in my case.... it really is quite an amazing thing when you think for a moment on it anywho that was a bear crazy (lol) thought there continueing on in the same vain

The occasional flash of yellow or tuquiose but apart from that I basically have afew colours which I cling to for security reasons.&nbsp;<br /><br />Going onto security I was definity beginning to step outside the ""style"" box i.e. becoming an emo freak but unfortunatly or fortunatly depending on how you view it I have lulled back into my frankie jeans and whatever I can be fucked to put on top which is normally no more than a bra of some description whilst at university for fear of standing out. Now this may or may not surprise you depending on how well you know me and my contradictory nature, but fear of being judged on what I am wearing has always been prevelant particularly at university where first impressions last forever as I have been learning more and more as time has gone on.....<br /><br />I guess that my stlye is never ""whats in"" nor is it so out there that its cool, I guess the combination of denim denim and denim wil do that coupled with a pair of ever comfy dolly shoes or ugg boots, and a basic strapy top or t. scarf is always a must have as is a spare top, a bag that hangs across your body if you will be buying anything and generally strange additions to my outfit such as hats which i have become a complete whore for.... thanks patrick.<br /><br />Bascially my style is fairly masculine and comfortable, a little off the wall but mainly just a whole load of basics, bit like my personality really."

Well now......

VILLAGE PEOPLE
went over to Cassies by order and actually managed to have a pretty RAD time with the village people after i had finally gotton over my anxitey of meeting new people at about 2 in the morning- there was much flirting with the guy who liked to burn shit but i remined a respectful distance for the sake of all that is holy in friendships- yess i do refer to those who get with brothers of friends- its NASTY DONT DO IT

BALL DRESS SHOPPING
late as usual mum told me i had to go to park and ride because i managed to spend 18 pound on parkingin the town in two days previous to this. however after suffering a massive panic attack about getting on a bus i finally managed to pull myself together enouugh to get on the bus. arrivingin town to fing livi wasnt there spurred on my next attack shortly followed by one induced by the fact i had to use a pay phone to call home as i have forgotton my useless mobile. however after eventually finding her at the FRONT of debenhams i also ound alice who looked scared shitless to be honest espech when livi produced waterproof trousers from her millets bag, but i must admit the routund earings were ACE of the ROUND varity. dress shopping= bad but alice shortly joined us again after leaving us..... found a couple of dresses which i liked (later when i showed mother duck she told me i looked fat in them which equalled mush selfhate and anguish) however at the time i was much satisfied with them, took livi tragic home and that was that really


SOPHIES MEAL
much love for you all, lol, after having a shit fit about being late for livi in the pouring rain i eventually made it (random police who i was having a polictal spaz about out pulled up next tp us and managed to check us out- much freaking out was followed byme) to her and after much rocking listing to the Bert and random directions we got there- promtly having to reverse out again and go to le place of pizza- met Hannah and Matthew there- matthew was HILARIOUS AS EVER, its nice to know a guy who is as sharp as our frinds who are evidently geni- tho sophie was a tadge of the quiet side i will forgive her as matthew is the attention whore much like Pete Wenz lmfao, sfter le pizza me and livi sang our way back to gipperswick and to TESCO to get KERRANG and MUFFINS, this resulted in chavs harasssing us which we tastfuly ignored tho livi was too obsesive about the gerard on the front of the mag to realise, we then proceeded to laugh like loons on loon tablets inthecar for about 10 minutes before driving to her hooose- i will add that on the way livi did LOB MUFFIN AT A SIGN in a crazed kinda way, drove home and spazed out because i felt like it.

D OF E SPAZ
i wont say much on this except those who spoke to me that evening know how stressed plus pissed i was at a certain person

D OF E
*dies* is there any reason that we do this... its so completely pointless and painful and as a result i do not feel the need to recount it except for the SHAME of the drop outs- cassie who caused me a LOAD of trouble before tho she had GLANGE and as a result i do forgive her and Lizzy who had a ""blister"" and doesnt know the meanig of pain particularly the pain we all felt on the end of the second day

SUNDAY
pain of driving to tescos to do big shop and other randomness including hoovering Alan who much appriated it tho i had to fight with the wind and the rain.... my sister is reading this alound as i write it and currently it REALLY PISSING ME OFF.... on another note taht wasmy exciting sunday whoich i really rather enjoyed

MONDAY- LAST DAY OF SCHOOL EVA
= panic attack this morning that i wouldnt make it tho i did with a small amount of time, book returns plus dossing was non too bad and reminded me off back in the day frees thats we all shared, on another note randm rash= spoilage of the day for me but apart from that....... leavers assembley was sad because the perve actually recked the slide show and im sorry but the streeages was much acer.... LOVE THAT HYMM SHOUT OUT TO THAT then luchoen was none too bad alothough im a little confused why the cooked salmon was cold- not even my cooking is that bad- lol, anywho i did get stuck between mrs dane and mrs westlake- one of who hasnt spoken too me since i quit her subject, the other i told i hated her- in jest i hasten to piont out still the treat was there, coffee= much hilarity as the pikeying of the mints in a very subtle kinda way...... lol, well beens as our group was the last to leave the room- hard core we are- I manaded to pikey- in a fantasiclly stylish manner- a bottle of cava, we then proceeded to run up the stairs in a gale of laugher- glad le livi tragic didnt die, after a little procrastination we decided that massacaring the board would be a great idea.... well one thing lead to another and Bert made a surprise appearence in our convo as you can well image as livi and i were commincating- a medium one is needed here as a shout out, we then decided that stickingbert as previouly arranged would be a great idea- steerage walks in with livi under desk *cough* nothing going on in here *cough*  after berting up the whol eof the room we felt out work was done- after a minor spaz about having lost my keys we then all went home and i have spent the last hour on live journal.




much love to you all, im sure ive forgotton loads but i will add it all in later if i can be arsed- also i havnt been n=bothered to check the spelling so apolgoes now for the crazyness that im sure you will find."

"event","A  man walked into the ladies department of a Macy 's and shyly walked up to 
the woman behind the counter and said, ""I'd like to buy a bra for my  wife."" 
""What type of bra?"" asked the clerk. 
""Type?"" inquires the  man, ""There's more than one type?"" 
""Look around,"" said the saleslady,  as she showed a sea of bras in every 
shape, size, color and material  imaginable. 




""Actually,  even with all of this variety, there are really only four types 
of bras to  choose from."" 
Relieved, the man asked about the types. 






The  saleslady replied: 
""There are the Catholic, the Salvation Army, the  Presbyterian, and the 
Baptist types. 






Which  one would you prefer?"" 






Now  totally befuddled, the man asked about the differences between them. 
The Saleslady responded, ""It is all really quite simple... 






The  Catholic type supports the masses. 

The  Salvation Army type lifts the fallen,
The  Presbyterian type keeps them staunch and upright, and 
The  Baptist makes mountains out of mole hills. 






Have  you ever wondered why A, B, C, D, DD, E, F, G, and H are the letters 
used  to define bra sizes? 
If you have wondered why, but couldn't figure out  what the letters stood 
for, it is about time you became informed! 






(A}  Almost Boobs... 
{B}  Barely there. 
{C}  Can't Complain! 
{D}  Dang! 
{DD}  Double dang! 
{E}  Enormous! 

{F}  Fake. 
{G}  Get a Reduction. 
{H}  Help me, I've fallen and I can't get up ! 




They  forgot the German bra.

since the last day i have been revising my socks off for physics which is really depressing because every time i try and do a paper i fail miserably, physics retakes being on fri 8th and i havent looked at those books yet..... oh well, Ill be a train driver.....

apart form this random riding on every other day has kept me sane as well as the abduction of olivia into town- a big shout out to the gnome victim here lol  xxx

 THURS   then the show of incest i.e. the Suffolk show, which i saw Pip, Alice and Sprake- a shout out to the brief encounter there, i then watched the hunter pony classes as i reckon that jolanda would make a good one if she lost weight and gained balance, saw my friend get 5th in her class tho if she hadnt cantered off (in hand) then she would have got 1st, the rest of the show consisted of eating lugging massive tubs of biotin (8kg) and salt lick (14kg) and heavyweight rugs around the show, i then went back to the yard but didnt get home till gone 10 that sucked

 FRI   my family decied to stay away so i am still all alone at home, did some english- have given up on the physic for now, went for a lesson up the yard and helped get ready for the home show that was today ended up round the yard owners house who bought my dinner of chinese which was ace as there is no food in my house, then back to the yard by which time it was dark, she left her lights on to guide us while we made a show jumping course in the nigt but her battery went flat which was at the time hilarious because we had to leave it in the centre iof the jumping field, eventually left the yard at 10 to 1 this morning and i dont exaggerate

SAT     up at 7 to  plait up jolanda- if any of yoou have seen jolandas mane and tail you will understand why this is a great acheivement, got all ready, did an in hand turn out class- got 3rd woop woop. did a dressage comp thena  show jumping comp combined and got 7th overall which is quite an achievement for both jo and i. lol, had a bbbq up the yard with everyone went up tescos for cheese and chocolate, came home tied as the family are finally coming back tomz and wrte this


i will now go and wacth harsh times with christian bale!! and Freddy Roderigez!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! in lol

Twas very happy, woke up in an unusaully good mood proceeded to be affectionate to all first thing, this was damped slightly by the Pop mister being a cunt at brake but it all turned out fine, and as a result turps and oppressive weather I decided that spending time with jolanda would be good- it was amazingly enough, i even managed to flirt convincingly with one of the younger builders- this consisted of much ""sticky eyeness"" and the old furtive glance trick- even though at the time jolanda was having a freak out for some unknown reason, would have been hilarious to anyone watching us, came home and got my daily dose of Americas next top model, applied for accomodation at the uni we do not mention and wrote this, i believe i will now go and attepmt physics to add an intellectual level of happyness and then i will have yet another purge- 3rd this week- to rid my skin of the smell of turps

Get Down With The Kids
 
It happens to us all eventually. It doesn't matter who you are, one day you'll wake up and realise you haven't a clue what music the cool kids are listening to. Of course, some people are quite happy with this. They're probably too busy washing the car or perusing the new IKEA catalogue to even notice, let alone care. 
 
For the rest of us, though, it's a sad day. 
 
Thankfully, help is now at hand. We've teamed up with Channel 4 Radio to bring you a little primer of what's going down on the street - well, the playground and university common room anyway.This page will grow to become a crucial resource for anyone not ready for their pipe and slippers just yet. So if you think emo is that annoying puppet Rod Hull had (and it bothers you), you've come to the right place.
 

Emo
 
 
What's it all about then?
Emo is a genre of indie rock with its origins in Washington DC's mid-1980s hardcore punk scene. The first wave of emo bands shared some quite specific characteristics, notably a tendency for spontaneous emotional outbursts in performance, hence the name. 
 
The sound was made more melodic by a new generation of indie-influenced bands in the mid-1990s, creating the conditions for its absorption into the mainstream. In truth, the term is now sufficiently broad to encompass a relatively wide range of music, leading to much debate as to who does and does not qualify as emo. 
 
What's the look / attitude?
Kit yourself out from head to toe in black, die your hair the same colour, and ensure to brush as much of it over your face as possible. Finish off the look by painting your nails. A reaction against jock culture, Emo types shun anything sporty or overtly masculine.
 
EMO bands
Panic! At The Disco, My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy
 
Ones to watch out for
My Sweet Nothing, Hiding With Girls, The Cape of Good Hope
 
 
Screamo
 
What's it all about then?
Screamo is a sub-genre of new emo. Songs are often slower and more melodic than in other genres, less of a ""beatdown"" and more of an opportunity for introspection. Screamo has been described as ""mixing the literate, poetic lyrics of emo punk with a harsher and more metallic brand of sonic thrash, as well as using screaming vocals"".
 
What's the look / attitude?
Not too dissimilar to EMO in the sense that simple black clothing and a hatred of the mainstream are required.
 
Screamo bands
JR Ewing, Bet On Black, Slapshock
 
Ones to watch out for
Hot Cross, A Life In Vain and Action
 
Grime

What's it all about then?
The music is typified by sparse and minimalist 2step breakbeats, generally around 130-140 beats per minute, and a fast, aggressive rapping style - often in double time. The lyrics and music combine futuristic electronic elements and dark, growling bass lines.
 
What's the look / attitude?
Individual clothing, tattoos and piercings are all popular ways for grime lovers to express their music taste. Due to the aggressive nature of the music, grime fans are outspoken and fanatical about getting their point across. Rebellious types, grimers don't like being told what to do and will stand up against the system. 
 
Grime artists
Dizzee Rascal, Garbage Gang, Element of Grime
 
Ones to watch out for
Untouchable Elite, The Chavs, Master"

Horses, jo is better but still full of snot, i manage to look daggers at the impertant buliders who try and chat me up, followed by jo who promtly goes balistic because my attention is turned to someone other than herself and as a reult builders decide it is safer to run out of field *high fives jo* that horse is a legend

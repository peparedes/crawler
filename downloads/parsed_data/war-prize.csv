"event","<i>Like so many other days, Briseis is to be found walking the edges of this lonely sea, her bare feet leaving a silent trail for a short length behind; every so often, the wavelets wash around her ankles and erase all trace of her presence. If she were to be swept up into the heavens, stolen from this desolate earth, the sea would soon destroy all evidence that she had ever lived.

Lonely and desperate is the sea gull's call, one bird hovering like a god in the hard white sky, a sound echoed by the sea's mournful crash. The ""Mansion"" is a great distance off - Briseis has stubbornly refused to sleep there since her arrival in this strange place, and has spent the warm nights and hot days on this beach, walking its lengths alone. 

Loneliness, it seems, characterizes every aspect of her silent walk.</i>"

"event","There are bones that lie still in the ruins of Troy. There are children who were made orphans, women made widows, and there are houses, half-burnt, half-wrecked, entirely empty. There is a city made cemetary by these kings of Greece.

(and one man, whom I cannot banish from my mind...)"

"event","<i>It is sunset, and the sea is molten gold with the sun's reflection. Alone, still, on this distant beach, Briseis sits. Just above the reach of the questing waves, her knees pulled up to below her chin and arms wrapped round her legs, with her rough garb and unbound hair, she is more the picture of a sullen child than a queen in her own right. 

Soon the sun will be vanished from the sky, rounding the world to wait for the morning's ascension. Briseis is remembering.</i>"

"event","<i>The setting: a beach, nothing more nor less. It has the usual elements - a sky as vastly curved as an upturned, diamond-bright bowl; a sea that stretches on into blue and white eternity; and sand, sand, always the soft yellowing sand.

A trail of footprints in that same sand, being slowly washed away by the eroding waves, is Briseis' wake. She walks with the unvarying pace of a woman who has much on her mind, her gaze lifted to the distant horizon - where sky and sand and sea meet at a far-off, gem-gripped point.</i>"

"event","Snape was Dumbledore's son, but when he was very small an attempt to kill or kidnap him resulted in the death of his babysitter.  Realizing that the son would always be a target, Dumbledore placed him anonymously in an orphanage to make sure he would be safe.

Snape after the Death Eater experience finds out about this and the rest of the story ensues.

Thanks for any help.

John becomes aware and rescues him, but then seeks an overwhelming revenge on the people of the planet or at least their ""priestly"" class.

Thanks in advance for any help.

"event","Lately, I have noticed several instances where people have objected to the use of certain plots by the writers of both SG-1 and SGA.

I wonder if these people have ever considered the question of how many plots actually exist.  According to the Christian Bible, there is nothing new under the sun, and plots are no exception.  Short of plagiarism, which an entirely different matter, the use, reuse, and recycling of plots is unavoidable.

Do not usually comment on episodes, but both of these were great.

SGA, however, was incredible.  Guess we really do not know a lot about the wraith. However, given the discussion in the extra content I have a feeling that both Kolya, Michael and our friend tonight will be back.  Neat the way they handled getting John back to basics.

Wonder why they did not resolve their obligations to Michael like this?

""http://sg-resurrection.livejournal.com"" is a futurefic which has really gotten off to very interesting start.  The prose is smooth and the concept is very engaging.  Check it out, I think this one is going to be a real winner."

"event","Although I can understand having a friends locked journal for security reasons, I can think of only a very few reasons to openly post an anonymous message.

Perhaps, if you to wish donate lj time, make an award nomination,  praise a particular fandom, or recommend someone's work, without obligating them to ""appreciate"" you, an anonymous post is justified, but otherwise, if it is worth saying, it is worth claiming. Guess it is like my dear departed mother used to say, ""if you can't say something nice (or helpful), say nothing at all.""

To intentionally denigrate someone's personality or work in an open venue without giving them a chance to respond is frankly cowardly and dishonorable.

Note:  I have never written a word of fiction, original or otherwise, and do not plan to do so in future.  However, I deeply admire anyone, regardless of their age and/or ability, with the courage to create a story and have it read by others."

Perhaps, now that Hurricane season is here, there may be more interesting things to write about soon.  However, for the present, Key West is suffering from monotonously perfect weather, the birds are twitting, the coconuts are falling, the bougainvillea and royal poinciana are unfolding and the Gulf/Atlantic and the Straits of Florida are doing their thing.  This perfection can change and has changed, in the past, in a veritable wink, but that is the price of paradise.

Note, as a native Floridian (rare bird), we do not, have not, will not evacuate, which gives FEMA and the State government the willies, but what do you suggest with nine indoor cats and the current humans only shelter policy.  Besides, Key West is on coral rock, the water comes, rolls over us and departs quickly, the wind is also brief as we are a tiny island and the hurricanes can not linger long.  Then we pick up the debris and proceed to entertain the tourists.

After Wilma last year when 70% of the island was under water on Tuesday, we were open for business and receiving guests by Friday.  MRE's and booze flowed like water and the tourists were fascinated by the Army and National Guard troops doling out food and water, while they (the tourists) sipped rum punch and sunbathed.

Living forty feet in the air in a fortress-like building, we were above it all, except for the 2 cars that turned into submarines, but we were among the lucky ones.  Wilma was our biggie, although Dennis, Katrina and Rita also struck glancing blows that made life interesting."

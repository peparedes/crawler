"event","Wow its almost Christmas and its very hard to believe, we've all been so busy. I wonder how many people stop to think about the true meaning of Christmas. I was singing at my church in the choir and this kinda important guy said he would be there. I waited for what seemed forever but he never came. My heart wanted to break. Hes just a friend but a friend that means soo much to me. I never thought that i could ever make a friend who was a guy ever again but i was wrong. If only he knew how much he ment to me... doesnt matter. Mime is just a friend and i noe that i will always love him and i will always hold him close to my heart and love him until hes ready to noe that I love him. 
Well this Christmas is not what I expected it to be. I expected no presents a small dinner and it turned out to be a holiday full of trusting for the Lord to provde. I hope that your Christmas is equally as special. Merry Christmas Mime. Merry Christmas to all and a blessed new year!"

"event","Hey everyone. I am so bored. On friday i went to the movies with Amanda, Caity, Lindsie, Ryan, Matt and Alan (A ___). It was a lot of fun. After Emily,Jon,Fallon,Travis,Isabella,Liz and Marissa (i don't know who else was with them) saw there movie we met up with them. Then they all left and Me, Amanda, Caity, Fallon, Liz, Marissa, Lindsie, Ryan, Matt and Alan went to publix and Liz, Fallon and Marissa got subs. I went to sit down in a chair cause we just took a picture and Alan moved the chair out from under neath me. It was really funny cuase i fell on my butt. But i didnt fall fast i like fell so gracfully it so it didnt hurt. Then we all left publix and i waited for my mom to pick me up and amanda, lindsie, fallon, liz, marissa waited for lindsies mom to come and the guys just left. On Saturday I waited for someone to call to do something but by the time fallon called me to ask if i wanted to go swimming with her and amanda and lindsie it was too late, these people i met when i went out of town asked me to do something so i went with them and then later that day i went with them to see harry potter. It was good. I didnt like how it ended but w/e. And also yesterday my mom started looking for a car for me i am sooo happy i cant wait only 4 more months.

"event","Omg i am sooo mad. I am sooo stressed out. I am finding out like all this stuff and it is pissing me off. Everyone always takes advantage of me. LIke if they need something i will do or if they want to borrow something i will let them. But not anymore. Never again. If some1 lets u borrow money at least offer to give it bak and if they say keep it then ok but at least offer. I just need to take time away from every1 and be alone no 1 around. I think i am gonna go on vacation by myself. I cant take it anymore. One thing that really pisses me off is that i dont talk about any1 be hind their bak well just one person i do. And the rest of my friends all sit there and talk about me. If u dont like me that much why hang out with me if u hate me that much. And i am sooo tired of people making in fun of me. And u know something ok alot of ppl make in fun of muh last name especially and i mean ur muh friend ur not suppose to ur suppose to not laugh if some1 else who isnt a firend does it. I mean r u that immature to do that. it makes me fell so bad about my self and i mean i cant help it. No 1 knows wut i went through so every1 juss needs to stop w/ it. its pissing me off. w/e im gonna write again later bye.........."

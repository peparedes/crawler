"event","Well ive been pretty busy lately...graduating from highschool on tuesday and it doesnt feel like it at all. You think your gonna see the same people u have seen for the last 4 years of your life and your not. After all of this everything will change and everyone will go their seperate ways out into the real world. Social statuses mean nothing anymore...its so weird how this all works out. You work throughout all of highschool to try to be popular and be in the ""IN"" crowd and everything only for it to go away when u graduate then you have to do it all again at college if you go or if u dont it doesnt matter anymore...at all. I guess thats why its kinda weird when u think about how everyone bases their life on popularity and clothes and stuff...i dont but i look at all these kids at our school and i think that. Well anyways im excited. My parents gave me $1500 towards my new car for grad...ill be getting the car on Wednesday i believe becuz some retard burned his eyes using a welder without a mask haha..but its good hes ok. Anyways this summer should be fun...going to the beach a lot def and hanging out a lot of cool people should be daily rituals haha. Working will suck as usual but hey its life u know u gotta grow up and get used to it sometime haha."

The week started with my parents getting wicked pissed off at me which isnt good at all considering they are making me take the bus in the morning now and they pretty much hate me i guess. I probably would be like really pissed off if i didnt have to look forward to prom or graduation or anything so its a good thing i can look forward to those things. As for the rest of this week...umm work tomorrow..work friday...saturday supposed to be hanging out with some loser...and sunday i dont even know yet  . So after next week i have 1 week left of high school!!! sux tho becuz then i have to deal with my parents all summer, who im not on really good terms with at the moment lol...oh well at least i can look forward to the beach haha ;)"

Then me and Corinne were supposed to hang out and stuff and we had it all planned out that we were goin to the movies and stuff. Sooo it gets to be the time and she is like ""well im not gonna make it down there in time and plus Amelia is telling me about this show and she says we should go to it"" im like hmm  alright just find out where it is and stuff and what time and ill be there. So she tells me its at this pizza place in Rochester im like uhh ok....first off i dont know Rochester at all and i barely know how to get there really haha..and neither of them could give me directions. So i was like ok w/e we will hang out some other time even tho we like never get to hang out or whenever we do hang out your with your other friends!! But ya its cool so she left and stuff and now i had to find something to do with the car from 8-12 cuz i told my parents i was going bowling again so i could get the car (i wonder when they will realize im lying haha)...Sooo i took the car and drove off and i start thinking hmm i should try and find this place in rochester i got 4hrs. So ya i drive to Rochester and im like ""fuck where do i go now"" then all of a sudden i am downtown and i start driving up the street and BAM i see the pizza place she was talking about. Well Corinne u could have done a better job ditching me by finding a place in rochester that ISNT on Main Street really. haha it was funny tho corinne was like how did u get here and how did u find it and stuff and she wouldnt believe me that i just found it on my own haha loser..anyways about the band that was playing...lets just say i wasnt a big fan but the people there seemed to enjoy it..i dont think corinne liked em too much either but it was fun i guess just because i got to see Corinne even tho i didnt think i was gonna and i <33 her :) But ya after that i didnt have anything to do at all i went to BK drove around saw  Devin and Ashley and Jodi at the shell talked for a minute drove around some more...went to Lee, Portsmouth, and Durham for the hell of it..put fucking 100 miles on the car haha..but ya tomorrow should be boring tho hopefully someone will wanna do something!

OH WHAT A GAME!!! Soooo much fun!!! Dover stomped Spaulding bad haha (Corinne>>>owned..but i still <3 you anyways haha). There were so many people at that game it was hard to move around lol. Its good to know we have such a big fanbase at our school compared to Spauldings which is umm..pathetic?*cough*. After the game me Shamra Diane and Toby went to McDonalds and i got 10pc Chicken Nuggets and remembered that McDonalds BBQ sauce tastes like shit which reminds me why i dont eat there anymore (Wendys JBCBS fo life hahaha). Got home at like 11 went to bed cuz i was super tired...woke up today and sat on my ass all day just eating food cuz idk ive been wicked hungry. Right now im watching the superbowl and i could really care less who wins because i know tomorrow everyone will be talking about it and that equals less teaching in classes woohoo!! and i also look forward to getting my matchmaker test back this week with Valentines day coming up i still lack someone so if this doesnt work out i might as well just kill myself!!! haha....and im spent...."

"event","Ya so today i got to sleep in till like 12 which was really nice...woke up took and a shower and stuff talked to some people online cuz i know most people had to wake up to take midterms this morning haha sucks for them..but anyways i got to write a note to someone special in the meantime to get it out of my head, it didnt take me long to write tho even tho its like 2 pages haha. Anyways after i did all that cool stuff i called my best friend Abe up so we could chill. He picked me up we went to his house and were running his Gas Powered RC Car around..you must be thinking this is some normal toy care well you are MISTAKEN. This thing will go so fast it will break someones leg..i think it can go up to 45 or something its pretty nice we had a lot of fun taking it off some snowjumps haha. Ya after a day of wasting our time playing around with toys we decided to hit up Cartelli's to seeee my bestest friend Shamra. It was really good.... and expensive i might add i think i might have just wanted to go to Wendys to save about 20 dollars..on myself haha. But ya after that me and Abe went to drive around for a bit kill some time then he brought me home and im just chillin waiting for school tomorrow..even tho i kinda dont wanna go bcuz of new schedules and other things im anxious to get back hehe.

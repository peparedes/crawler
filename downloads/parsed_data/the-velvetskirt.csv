"event","It's 1:40 in the morning and my roomate and I are sitting in our room wearing nothing but bathtowels and our underware with the door open....why you may ask? we have just gotten back from partaking in the age-old aggie tradtion of Pond hoppin'!! that is where a group of people run around campus late at night jumping into all the fountains, at least on one side of the tracks. we hit all 5 tonight!! First was Cain which has a huge Styrofoam Eagle on top of it which we skipped/ some guys putted tennis balls to and we played and swam in it.  then we leaped to the MSC where we  stood on the waterfall part.  next we sang songs all the way to H2O where we all got into the top tier and sang Kum-by-ya. then to Rudder where we swing danced (one of the SA's is a HUGE swing-dancer and he threw me in the air for a while, it was AWESOME!!!) then on to the hallowed Fish Pond (where they throw the yell leaders after we win a game) where we were caught by the cops but they let us go if we were gone by the time they got there, luckly our hall is right next to fish pond so we ran in and froze our asses off, but it was totally worth it.  In all an AWESOME evening...I'll take ya'll if you come down here...my roomate and I don't mind visitors in the least...we are gettin' along great!!
    This week my hall has had loads of stuff for us to do...yesterday we went to the Rec where we had open access to everything...i even took a turn off one of the diving platforms. i am definatly going to go to some of the swimming&diving events there.  on wednesday evening we had a pancake pajama party were the SA's made pancakes for all of us and then we had Karaoke (i was in a group that performed a garth brooks song).  last night everyone went to ""the hall"" (a country western dance hall)  but I coundnt go b/c i'm not 18...1 more week...so i watched the Mask of Zorro upstairs. you could tell we were in the Nerd's dorm b/c we were analyzing all the action parts (like how a bullet can't make someone fall backwards and how we could make a flaming sword) which was hilarious! anyways...I absolutly LOVE this dorm...and the people's in it!!!"

"event","soo...i got back from fish camp (""brainwashing"" though not really) last night and moved into my dorm.  I was the only one there, so i watched trouble with angels and unpacked then went to sleep.  i set my alarm for early this morning so my roomate wouldnt walk in and see me asleep, which would have happened because her dad walked in at about 8 and thought i was her (yeah we look alike).  I helped her unpack, and we talked...we get along real well.  her parents left b/c they have to drive back to brownsville today, so we went to mass together and i came here b/c my computer aint in, which is sad...anywhoo that's what's up."

"event","i'm learning how to use my calculator...its AWESOME i love how it does most everything for me.  i'm here at STEP learning how to survive engineering first year and the first 2 wks or preface of the classes.  the physics prof is cool, math is simple, and engr 111 is evilly scary.  the past 2 days i overslept and skipped class, which is bad...but nothing compared to the drinking going on last wk, they got really pissed, but that's understandable.  1 night we escaped to the abandoned 4th floor because the lower you go the more drinking you get into.  we were up till 4, four of us just talking.  the next night i was up till 4 watching the notebook across the hall.  i'm sick of sandwhiches and fried food, which is all they are serving us.  anyways, class is now dismissed, i'll update more later.

this from mo:

1. Reply with your name and I'll respond with something random about you.

5. I'll tell you my first/clearest memory of you.
6. I'll tell you what animal you remind me of.

"event","soo...im in this old hotel in the small mountain old west town of Fort Davis, TX.  It is so cool (plus it has wireless internet, which is great.  the atmosphere of the hotel makes me feel like i have stepped into a time machine, the entry way looks like one of those old west hotels.  its a cool place, i want to come back here sometime and stay for longer, seems like a good place to take pictures and write. there is a balcony right outside our room that overlooks the town square and surrounding mountains.  im here to visit my sister who is doing field work about 70 miles from here, but this is one of the closer towns, there are no chains here, the resturant at the hotel was so good, i want another one of their dinner salads, it was awesome! and their pie, french silk, yummy! my brother is saying that i write so improperly, but that's his problemo.  tomorrow we head up to santa fe where i'll be for 2 weeks about, should be fun."

"event","Sooo...
-Euro final:All nighter doing it, but i got it done at 9:00 (it was due by 9:50 and its a 45 minute drive), got a 88 on it, i think he graded this one harder than last one. after that, leslie, john, one of leslie's friends from jesuit, andrew and i hung around school for a while (leslie and john marked up the junior's cars with 05 with shoe polish, i was lookout) then leslie kidnapped andrew and i, we went on a high speed race all over dallas against john and rodrigo, which was scary, but i lived...we went to walgreens to copy some pictures, and that's it for that...
-senior dinner: HILARIOUS!!!teachers making fools of themselves before we graduate, dancing and singing to old songs dressed up...very good, the senior video was great too (corboy as sister cecilia with a parot on his back)
-graduation junk:lived through it, took forever...played poker after baccalaurte over at bednarz's which was fun, i lost all my money
-a&m:signed up for my classes, don't start until 9 on everyday except friday when i start at 11 and end at 2, on mondays i have a lab from 7:30-9, which sucks, but that's ok...im taking: fundamentals of engineering, honors university (calc based) physics, math 152 (bc topics, i figured it would be better to be bored than suicidal), state and local government, then intro to nuclear engineering, which should be fun...there are 60 incoming freshmen in the department, of that 9 of us are female, which is fine...before the new student conference, i was therese's slave...scraping wallpaper, priming her room, eating what she wanted me to eat...what a blast

that's about it, i leave for alaska for an hour...so that'll be funness."

"event","not really, i have to do my euro final because i failed the project cause i didnt care any more, but that's ok, just as long as i was exempt from calculus and government, im happy!! I dont think it has hit that i am totally done with high school, but that's ok.  The past two days, the seniors have totally thrown out the rules, i walked around in flip flops yesterday and delivered a note to ms mehen's room on the other side of the school in a rolling chair, which was awesome!! we didnt do a senior prank, our class is not organized enough to pull it off, but that's ok.  i brought in cakes on thursday for calculus and euro classes, shano decorated the one for euro, it was very good, she has so many talents...i wasnt feeling too well yesterday, so i had to cancel dinner with Andrew, which was sad and i felt horrible doing it, but the thought of food made me want to throw up, so we are going to the choir concert tonight, which will be fun.  today its just so hot outside...
Signing uniform shirts was so fun!! mine is almost all full of pictures and notes in all colors thank God for multi-colored sharpies!!"

i have had my hair and make-up done because i cant do either and its my senior prom.  didnt get a date, but that is totally cool, it means i am not tied down by anything.  yesterday was fun, eddie had to be at school at 7:20, but i didnt have to be there unitl 9:20 because seniors got to skip junior ring ceremony.  i didnt want to stay at school that long, so i left for IHOP when the others started school, planning on doing my chemistry homework.  i got there and saw john and shannon eating, so i joined them...very fun.  we then went to 7-11 and got slurpees.  when i got back to school, there was no parking cause all the junior parents were there, so i had to park far far away and move later.   after school, shopping for prom stuff, which was fun.  then sleep. 
today, getting ready for prom!!

"event","TAPPS Trip: left school about 8:30 for Austin, sat next to tina, she did chem i studied bio for the science competition.  we stopped in waco for lunch, taco bell, and then loaded up the bus again.  her mom texted her saying that the pope had died, but then we heard he didn't, so it was confusing.  chris was happy and praying for him to die, which is just horrible.  we played MAO which is an awesome card game if you have never played it.  the only thing you know at the start of it is that it is like uno, other than that, you have to learn the rules as you go and new rules are made up by the winner, for example, when you lay down a nine you have to hit greg.  it is a fun game and you can't talk during it, which was nice because we were sick of pope talk by that time.  Eventually we got down to Austin, where we had to stay at Concordia until 3 when Motel 6 let us check in.  We played MAO somemore and watched some college students play role-playing games where they were fighting with foam swords, it was crazy.  We then went back to the hotel where we just hung out in our room for a while watching TV and talking.  We went to dinner at Applebee's where we got a brownie to play a joke on sister with (we put it in her room and wrote ""brownie check"" on it...two years ago some kids brought pot brownies on this trip, so she does a brownie check on the bus) it was great.  I had prelimes that night, and it went okay, but i didnt advance which was fine by me, more free time on saturday.  once i got back, we studied science until about 11.  got up the next morning, headed to Concordia to take the science competition, they stuck all of us in one room with 5A, so there were over 30 of us jammed into this tiny classroom.  I sat next to someone who will be in the Nuc department next year with me at A&M, which was cool.  The test wasnt bad, i placed 6th, tina placed 3rd and greg placed 2nd.  Advanced math was next, and it went fine, i didnt place, but i beat greg in score which is good.  the rest of the day was boring because Concordia is a tiny campus with noting around it.  i was in charge of tabulating the scores as they came in to get our place, we were close with Houston Duschene, but we pulled ahead with wins in Block IV, so we are state champs!!! we left late, about 7, it was dark and they didnt turn on the bus lights, so there was nothing to do but talk, sleep, and play on the labtop.  we stopped in waco again for a snack and got home at about 11:30.

Rest of Weekend: sleep

Yesterday: nothing

Today: actually got calc done, made up euro test, math competition after school, talked to inman (who responed to the survey suprisingly)who is taking The Count of Monte Cristo off the sophmore reading list which sucks for them because that was a great book, much better than the movie, the Count is so much more evil and cunning.  He is putting in Sophie's World, which is about philosophy, boring.

Plans: calculus party on friday, gotta learn how to play hold 'em by then for the poker after, shopping on saturday, sleep whenever"

Spring break summary: sleeping and cleaning...my room is most of the way done.  That's about it.  Served on Good Friday, we had 10 of us.  Served mass yesterday, which was totally awesome, Easter Vigil is the best mass ever, LOTS of fire.  We had the big Pascal bonfire thing out front of the church, this year we remembered to bring marshmallows and hot dogs, which we roasted over the fire because it wasn't blessed yet.  We made s'mores for people, the first one went to Father Tim, who requested his marshmallow to be golden brown and then we exposed Father Antony to s'mores for the first time (he's our imported priest from India) he first asked us, ""will it kill me?"" he asked that about five times before he ate it.  he like them.  We have started a new tradition, i bet that we are the only church to roast marshmallows and hot dogs on the Pascal fire.  That's my excitement for Spring break.  Two more days until back to school, but only for two days because im going to TAPPS Academic competition down in Austin for Science, Advanced Math, and Original Oratory. That's about all here, very boring week."

"event","wow, spring break is finally here! whoop for that! except all my friends are in europe, but that's ok, that makes me free to clean my room and possibily move the very old, beat up, but comfortable couch from downstairs to my room, which would be awesome, so friends can stay up there with me.  i may be able to get down to college station, which would be fun and possibily another calculus party, which are always fun, especially when brownies are involved.  that's my plans for the ten days i have off, i may get to my euro timeline, which would be awesome.
musical has been done for almost a week, its kindof sad, the last night was tear-jerking, ms may and ms sawyer talked to us seniors and went around and hugged us and told us thanks for everything.  during the show, my allergies were nuts which sucked, but the night before was a great show with carla and i dancing up there and everything.  cast party was fun, i still cant believe i supplied most of the music: someone wanted disco, and i had bee gees and then i also brought thriller and devil went down to georgia, everyone was dancing, frank and addison did a rendition of the devil went down to georgia, and we even got ms may to dance.  slept over at anna's because i didnt want to drive home late.  after the show on sunday, we had strike, i had to drive trash to the dumster and then i sorted screws and bolts with john, shannon, and kelly.  then we had a small party after and heard jason cavanar sing a song for the seniors, ""this is the seniors' last show...anything goes..."" it really was very good.  then it was over.
i miss musical, people no longer have to stay during early dismissal or go nuts, though i still see mia during school, its not the same.  oh well.  just about thirty five days left of school i think.  we gave our presentation on wednesday, the first to go, it went well, we showed our pictures with us in jumpsuites and my name: Margarita Sanchez de la cruz de la muerto la tres ""la enchilada sangre""- i was in jail because someone called me taco and i got a ""little"" upset.  Shannon was Jenny Lou McCormick-""the shameful shamrock"" and Marie was ""Georgia Anne"".  Good times. had a calculus party at andrew's on wednesday night, started late and ended about 11:30.  Mrs. Bednarz made brownies for us, which was very nice and she let me keep some of them because she is nice.  that's about all going on here, tomorrow is regional science fair, so i wish thomas good luck with that, he and my parents are working on the board right now, im in charge of the coke dog.  therese should be up here tonight sometime.
i cant believe it, i am actually reading a steinbeck book for fun!! i used to hate his books, but after i read of mice and men again, it was pretty good, so i am now reading Tortilla Flat, which does not seem depressing and sounds like the milagro beanfield war a little.  so far its good, the characters are always getting wine by the gallon for a dollar a piece.
so that's how everything stands, ill probably be updating more because i dont have school this week. so yeah."

"event","Tech week. it is almost done, very sad.  It has been fun, and i have been doing good with homework, so i can just go home and go to bed.  Last week was the crazy week where i was at school from about 7:30 am to 11:00 pm.  I was worried if we would be ready, but we are doing great.  I got Flydeck with Carla, it was only okay at first, but now we are having fun up there dancing to ""Blow Gabriel,"" the ""Heaven Hop"" and ""Bon Voyage"" that is the hazard of musical, you get all the songs and dances into your mind and can't get it out.  my important part is where i raise the blackout curtain during ""All through the Night"" to reveal Hope and the sailors.  it is exciting.  headsets have gotten more fun, last night we talked about cheesecake on them.  good times.  that is the technical side of things, now the fun parts:

-dinner: has been pretty good, fun eating with all the other peoples.  good food.
-blackfriar traditions: always fun, singing songs from ""Once Upon a Mattress"" from last year is great.  meeting in the choir room before showtime it is like we are a family, we all sing together and then pray.  Then everyone goes onstage
-Mia and Me being crazy: welcoming the cast to the stage out of the choir room game style (high fives, pep talk) very very fun.  we originally got stares, but now the cast and crew play along and get excited.  we get hugs from people too so we get our traditional three hugs.  Also, we have a theme thing for each hall in the theatre: ballet arms, one that changes every night (beauty queen, flower girl, spy, bowing, Mia stanging straight, me crouching down and going back and forth rotating between the two positions), and random jumping.  Gary the orchastra guy looks at us and says, COD- crew on drugs.  the parents think we are crazy one calls us sisters even though we look absolutly nothing alike.  we talk to the xylophone man about the nodes and antinodes of the xylophone.  during intermission we go out to the atrium and get cookies and food, then talk to the cast about random things, like ""The Circle"" to scare them.  its fun.  we move el brigo out and other things.  the sophomore crew idiots are still annoying and call us psyco, Sandore says that they are backwards and should not be talking.
-Costume crew: rocks as usual.  Anna, Amanda, Lauren, Debbie, Colette- great group of people.  good sanctuary and i get to put my junk back there.  They even curled my hair today! yay!
-After the show: meeting people, getting flowers from Tina
-IHOP- after show traditional IHOP trip, my last one happened today :(.  i went last week, small group.  today it was a large group and we were all going nuts.  We had to share the room with a different group and i think we scared them by crowding around the window to watch John and Rachel's ""light-saber duel"" going on in the parking lot and then applauding the winner when Rachel came back in and singing random musical and drinking songs.  good times had by all.  Tomorrow is the cast/crew party at Kelly's house and then strike on Sunday night where we dismantle everything.

School side of my life:
-English: Invisible Man, by Ralph Ellison, is the WORST book ever written.  you know it is bad when out of the entire AP English class not one person actually read the book, it is that bad.  the main character is whiny, there is no flow or structure, Harlem Renaissance just sucks anyway.  We did get to watch ""Family Guy"" for it in order to see how one culture can want to become another.  I dont know what we are doing now, we are going to do our project tomorrow.
-Government: Still hate it.  Field Trip to the courthouse was cool, saw a murder trial where a father shot and killed his son and we got to see the mother who witnessed the entire thing testify.  It was very interesting.  Amanda, Chris, Brianna, Sean, Catie and i stuck together during the day, we ate at the Corner Bakery downtown because it was quiet and none of the other kids were going there.  We then walked around the West End through the mall and candy stores.  We had to go back to school though eventually.
-Econ: absolutly nothing
-Euro: still fun class, Dr. Morris is a great teacher.  we had a fire drill today and did not want to come inside, but evenatually some of the class gave in to the rules and went back in.  I passed my test with an 84 without studying except in calculus.
-Chem: I got a 94 on my test, missing all 6 points on a relatively easy set of questions on conjugate acids and bases.  Scored well at the National Chemistry Olympiad, tied with Ashton but he got more of the last 10 right, so he got to go.
-Calculus: Finially caught up in that evil crime against humanity.  I was two or three weeks behind in homework.  John, Greg, Andrew and I had a series of calculus parties to get caught up because our half of the room was all very behind.  i had two at my house until about 11:30.  I have actually done my homework for next week, we are finially out of converging and diverging series and on to the fun subject of vectors.
-Office Aide: just running stuff all over the school.  Mrs. Boase is so funny, rushing out to her van at 12:20 to watch her soap opera.  Mrs. Puskarich is the sweetest lady at BL.
-Early Dismissal: thank God i have it. that is all i can say.  i wrote my gov paper during it, and during tech week John and i would get at least some calculus done during it in the library.  one day i challenged someone to a game of chess because he did not believe i knew how to play, he beat me in two minutes the first time, but the second time, i was putting up a fight.  Yesterday, i had to run to Minyards to get food for concessions and then i went to 7-11 for a slurpee.  when i got back, John and Samantha asked me if i wanted to go to the bank with them, and since i had nothing else to do i went.  i survived Sam's driving.  then we went to Casa Linda bakery, good ginger bread men for only a dollar for a good sized cookie.

That is my life right now.  School and Musical, last show is Sunday, then i dont know what i will do with my time.  About 40 days till graduation and a week until spring break! yeah! Now that i know i am going to A&M and will be in Lechner, if i got my thing in quick enough, i am ready to go!"

"event","from thrusday...plus a rant on college and future stuff:

i felt too sick with cold/allergies/cough/sore throat/headache/sleepiness to judge st. thomas's science fair, even though i really needed those points after failing the last chem test :( but hopefully ill do well at tapps state so sister will be really happy and give me lots of extra credit.  but i really needed to sleep, which is what i did that night.  yesterday, i slept somemore, did some homework, then headed off to amanda's suprise birthday party.  that was an experience.  i was actually the first one there for once, went into the place which is a lot like hooters, i walk in by myself, the only female there not wearing spandex shorts and low-cut shirt and under 21, among many forty-something ex-biker people so i called anna and fleed back to my truck to wait for her.  no one was answering their phones, so we waited in her car for a while once she go there.  cecilia and her boyfriend showed up and went inside to be scared just as i was and so the four of us walked over to razoo's for some nice cajun cooking.  we were waiting there when amanda and her boyfriend walk in and we kind-of suprise them in a weird way.  anna called amanda's dad and found out that the party was actually supposed to be tonight, but oh well.  it was a good thing and made amanda happy, so that's good.  anna and i talked most the time by ourselves 'cause the couples were all over eachother, which was weird.  so we talked about how she is gonna profess her love for someone with the ""fire of 10000 suns"" over a video to ask him to prom and how i would say yes to nearly anyone who would ask me.  any way, the six of us shared one sundae and then anna and i went to the mall because all the couples wanted to be alone, so we drove over to valley view (i survived anna on the road once again!!) and walked around a little tried on some dresses and then went and got a shake and i went home and went to bed because musical was at 8 this morning.

at musical i drove to home depot with sandore to get wood, not so bad, and then to the carpet place.  i worked with mia most of the time, we talked a lot about er of course and other stuff like that.  helped build the handrails and *hopefully* ill be assigned to the flydeck tomorrow. i really want flydeck again.  the set is just about done, we'll finish tomorrow.  tech week is next week!!! i am so freaked! last year it was crazy (I GOT A 50! YEAH, WHOOP! hey anna, that's your 50!, later i got a 20 so it evened out!)  but still very fun cause we're all crazy.  hopefully this year baseball won't flood the gym by hitting a sprinkler and cause the firealarm and fire doors to go off in the rain again like last year, horrible freaking out cause everyone was in costume.  good times, good times.

when i got home, i found out that thomas and i may be by ourselves for a few days, which is not bad at all until i found out that it was at the beginning of tech week when i wont be home until after 11 every night, so there are still issues to work out.  My mom has to go out to california for a funeral and my dad has to go there for meetings.  it'll work itself out hopefully.  i need to get homework done sometime for next week.  i think ill be at the library most of this week getting calculus done and doing my euro project and trying to get some of the reading done in advanced so i wont have to do that next week, just take the quiz with the notes i take this week.  anyway, college.

Here is where i stand on college:
im in at UMR, but i wont go there
im in at A&M, but waiting on scholarships from the office of scholarships and honor's college stuff
still waiting on Notre Dame until March/April
i dont know where ill go, A&M has a good nuc department where i can do policy work through the Bush school of government right there on campus.  i like the atmosphere and the people there.  Therese is there for better or for worse.  i know of two people going there, Greg and Alicia.  Alicia will probably live in Lechner, where i hope to be, which could be good, and i may have engineering classes with Greg which would be interesting to say the least, and Patrick may go there too which would be weird because if the three of us go there we would have had the same math/science curriculum and teachers for eight consecutive years because we were all at st. mark's and bishop lynch's honors classes.  The thing is, most of the people there are from texas, and i want to expand my view of the nation as a whole, i want to be able to visit people from New England, the Northwest, Florida, Mississippi, Arizona, all over, not just Texas, which is what Notre Dame can offer me, in addition to a family dorm environment, which i love and would provide me with life long really close friends, and many community service opportunities and also theology as a class, which i liked having in high school as a place to debate morality and most anything.  it is really pretty and definatly not texas.  i like having a lake on campus and having a small seminar style class freshman year for the core curriculum.  i would probably major in geological studies so i could do hazard risk assessment and mitigation or i am kind of thinking of maybe going into education, but most likely not.  

being a teacher is a way to leave a definate direct impact on people, one of the ten things i want to do before i die.  i think of how my teachers have affected me and inspired me to think outside the classroom and how learning is not a chore.  i think of how i can go in to inman's room and just talk to him about whatever we're doing in english in kantor's class or how therese is an anti-social hermit with her birdies.  how he would lend me money if i ever needed it, like when i had absolutly no money or gas to get home, but i had already gotten some off amanda earlier.  i think of how sister cecilia would stay until after 6:00 working on physics problems with me the night before a test or that time we watched jeopardy in her classroom, of course she got all the answers right being she is a freaking genius!! why she is teaching high schoolers i do not know, but i am glad she is, i mean, she has a docterate, studied at harvard, knows 5 languages, including cherokee, and is a nun, which is kindof odd.  we can ask her anything and she would know somehting about it ranging from russian literature to subatomic theory to where st catherine's heart is (she told us that her body part's were split up across italy once).  i think about storey's class where we would eat everyday and have a huck-finn southern party or a joy-luck club party.  same thing in kantor's class where we watched ""Young Frankenstein"" because he wanted to and where he has his medieval weapons in the closet and stocks at the front of the class or freaking out because someone put a cross on his board (he's jewish) and then talking about his ""jewish gang"" in garland where they all where ""yamahawks"" as he calls them and speak yiddish.  because most of my really good teachers have been english teachers, i feel like that would be a fun and influential occupation, except for one key challenge: i dont know grammer.  anyway, ill just go into nuclear policy and get to inspect places and recieve nice bribes from people.  maybe eventually after i retire or whatever ill become a pernament substitute and get to teach many different classes without having to grade anything.  that could be fun.

okay, so there goes my very long rant on last night, musical, college, and teachers.  more will probably follow at some other time on one or more of these topics."

"event","ok events in the past two weeks:
     -went down to A&M: Met Therese at Lechner and hung out with her friends eating pizza and playing Mario Kart.  Next went to her house and then went to my conference the next day. I was the only one there without a parent, i was dropped off by Therese who went in for some free food and then we thought that she should go get some Wildlife and Fish people to come to and be my ""parents"" from our anti-government compound so that they could get free food.  but she had class.  we ate at the Faculty club...GOOD food, especially the cake.  Then i went to the Nuclear Engineering department, where i went in and they gave me a nice scholarship that i didnt even think i applied for and was about to hand in my application for it to them.  Successful and entertaining trip.
     -the next weekend, i competed at TAPPS (texas association of private and parochial schools) academic fair.  I won third place in science (the BL team averaged about 200 points, Bishop Dunne had about 60 with their illegal calculators, so Tina Greg and I kicked their butts!!) second in advanced math, and second in original oratory. SO I'M GOING TO STATE!!! WHOOP!! that's in April down in Austin, it should be a blast!
     -i dropped tech theatre because it was way too much work for no credit, no fun, teacher hated me, and no relaxation, so i now have an early dismissal to work on homework.  the teacher challenged it, but i was able to get it passed because mrs. olson saw my point when she looked at my schedule and its 6 AP's.
     -mr inman gave me his blessing to go into a science field, but said that i should consider a minor in english, ill think about it...i may still need to convince him at A&M is the best place for one of my prospective majors.  i wont hear from notre dame until march-april, but i got my A&M acceptance this week.
     -im not going to umr because i feel like they are treating minorities like we're stupid because they are making us go to a seven-week ""chemistry enrichment"" in order to receive their scholarship...i dont need chemistry enrichment and dont see why they would be forcing it upon me.  even so, A&M could give me a much better program to prepare me for policy and inspection work and the dorms and food are better.
     -musical is going good, about two weeks till showtime!

that's about it that i can think of.  im sick of school and glad that i have an early dismissal now."

"event","yesterday eddie and i went out to breakfast at mimi's (i had promised him we would breakfast last sunday).  that was good.  then i went down to dallas to pick up anna to go downtown.  road the dart there, got off at mockingbird station to get me a pass (i forgot), ran into my 5th grade teacher on break from the conference my mom and all my teachers were at, so we found that all them carry blue bags so we kept an eye out for our teachers.  after we got my pass, some freak about my age came up to me and said he wanted my number so he could get to know me better, i said no, he asked if it was because he was black, i said no, i live far away (i should have pretended that i was taken, but i wasnt thinking) so anna and i ran off after that and prayed for the train to come quick.  we road downtown, saw some more blue bags, we were stopped at one of the stations and we saw sister! we ran off the train to go talk to her.  i had to direct her to the hotel.  anna and i went to eat at the pizza place near the station, then went to the west end.  that wasnt too exiciting, we got back on to the dart and up to mockingbird again, went shopping there for a little while, got back on the dart and saw blue bags from Prince of Peace, they were boring and i wanted to find mrs. good, who teaches there, so we went into the next car, but she wasn't there, BUT i saw the evil, vile, mean, Ms. Harris from pre-cal last year.  anna and i decided to go around to the front of the car to see if she noticed us.  we talked to someone from St. Rita, and i saw Ms. Harris talking to Ms. Shivers and pointing at us, so i had anna say hi, she was nice to anna, but not to me of course.  we told her what we had done, and then we had to get off because it was our stop.   we went to valley view mall, just tried on some prom dresses when i already got mine over the summer for cheap.  i found one that actually fits me, normally i have to have it shortened.  this dress is supposed to be mid shin, but on me, its floor length.  eventually found my way home and took thomas (eddie) to corner bakery for dinner and then to barnes&noble.  i read/looked at texas 24/7, saw the marathon motel, in therese's home (very small town).  then it was infiltrated by crazy teenagers who cant drive, so once the mall closes, they go to starbucks in barnes & noble.  very annoying little children, especially the ones from st. marks.  barnes and noble is for reading, not for annoying people and running around.  we left, came home, and played on the computer.
today i had musical practice this morning. left at 7:30, got there at 8, i love weekends.  worked on getting stuff out of storage, then i helped costumes hem some pants.  that was fun.  went to taco bell for lunch and then went back to school for an ap english study session, but only 5 showed up, so we called it off and went home.  now homework time."

"event","survived last week.  barely.  econ finally clicked in my head, so now im good with that.  government is not as bad, though i still like doing calculus better than writing for government, which is very terrifying.  tech theater is turning out to be more work than i thought it would be, but that's ok, ill survive.  literally slept most of the day on friday, except in chem because i had to take a test, which wasn't that bad actually.  its nice reading the lovely bones in english because in english class we mostly read books from over 100 years ago and this one was written about 3 years ago.  i found out that i got a 29 on the mu alpha theta math competition, beating john by 11 points and corboy by 24, and that's the best in the school, so im happy about that.  On friday tommy and i were locked out of the house because we dont have a key, so we randomly decided to drive through the country to Southfork ranch (where they shot the old show Dallas), so that was fun.  we went out to dinner at two-rows, pizza was good, but missing tomatoes, so i added some and it tasted good.  didnt do anything this weekend, couldnt get motivated to do my homework and projects like i wanted to get done before crew starts next week if my parents let me do it this year.  i hope they do, being last year was awesome! This week should be short because we have today off and friday off because all the diocese teachers have to go to some hotel to talk about theology, my teachers are all so thrilled (post said that he may ""come down with a stomach virus"" around noon).  Now on to calculus."

"event","whew, been a while since i updated, so what's happened: went back to school tuesday, didnt have any new classes, except for chem 4A instead of 1B, my new class is almost all junior guys expect for a few seniors and shannon, paige, and i are the only girls.  i miss my old class, this class is silent and it really bothers me. there arent any comments or anything, its so weird.  anyway on wednesday i had a nhs meeting, and an animal rescue meeting, plus i had to be there at 7:30 because ed had a student council meeting, i may run for council, because of open spots and ill be there anyway cause of eddie, but im not sure yet.  i had three new classes on wednesday: government, econ, and tech theater.  government was weird, three of the four biggest liberals of the class are in there, plus the teacher is liberal, so the class will be very slanted.  econ, i couldnt tell it was an ap class because i saw some people in there that defiantly should not have been there, i had to as kasey to make sure i was in the right class.  i didnt get most of what they were saying, but it'll get easier i hope.  in english we were given pictures and had to name the person, give them an occupation, hometown, likes/dislikes, dreams, etc.  after we had done all that and made fun of the people, we asked kantor where he got them and he said, ""i went on google and typed in obituaries"", so that made us all feel bad.  i looked my dude up and i actually got the first name right, it was weird.  in tech theater, we just took a tour of the theater, which was nice, it was great being able to go back up on my flydeck again.  not much happened on thursday or friday, stayed home friday because i have felt sick all week, have gotten no sleep, and still had loads of homework to do (a two page paper on ""what is heaven like?"" and a bunch of questions from one of Rousseau's essays, which im not even sure Rousseau understood what he was writing, plus a scale drawing of my room) so i just had a very tiring week, and it all caught up on me.  Today (actually yesterday) i cleaned. yeah. and then we went to half-priced books for about an hour.  i started ""The Lovely Bones"" at about 10 and finished it about twenty minutes ago.  the first part was really sad, i could not stop crying through it, but then it got sad, and then at towards the end it was just plain weird.  Now i better be off to bed because i have to go to church at 8 in the morning."

On our last day in ca we went to the harbor house where there was a group sitting next to us with their heads all shaved and wearing their sweatshirts inside out, which was weird.  after that we had to go to the University of California-Irvine science library for eddie's science project.  it was boring but i read about toxins, the spread of different cancers in different countries.  then we left the next day.  today i just worked on my A&M essay on a proposal for a mission somewhere abroad.  We went out to lunch at a pizza place and then went to the bookstore and worked on my essay some more.  that's about all.  we go back to texas on saturday or sunday, just as long as i get to light off fireworks on new year's eve and watch the rose parade on HGTV im fine. hopefully its not rained out, ca got lots of rain.  there were 800 accidents in LA county yesterday morning.  that was impressive.  gotta get back to my essays. fun."

"event","yesterday was just another day in california.  i had to be dragged out of bed because i wanted to sleep.  we ate eggs and sausage for breakfast, and then opened presents.  i got a watch, earrings, a book by Virginia Woolfe, the art of belly-dancing (hey,i need a hobby), pens, pencils, a napster card,a scarf and A League of their Own DVD.  We just did nothing around the house and then watched the Sound of Music and Its a Wonderful life, but mainly the Sound of Music.  Today we went to 6:45 mass and were out by 7:30, so we went to breakfast at the Original House of Pancakes.  Very yummy.  My mom and i went out for nail polish after because i got sick of the bright pink i put on while i was in the bathroom afraid to come out a few days ago because that was the only color there and i had nothing else to do while my brother and sister were outside with a banana and they had allready stuffed a gross one up my shirt (i am terrified of bananas).  We did not go to the store, my mom decided to kidnap me and take me to the mall.  I got a few things, long-underwear for cheap and then a funky skirt.  The family came over here, my aunt and her two kids (6 and 10) and my uncle and his daughter, my dear cousin Victoria, who is 16.  I worked on some euro while they were here, but mostly just talked about school.  One more week of freedom.  Tomorrow i want to just drive around orange county, but i doubt that will happen because my brother wants to go to a library and my mom is going to go see one of my other aunts, so i have to choose between those two options. we go back to new mexico on tuesday and then leave there on sunday."

"event","did all my christmas shopping within one store- Barnes and Noble's.  Me, Therese and Tommy did our little two of us go off and get presents for one while the other just reads somewhere nearby.  It works, we basically know what we got by the end of it, but its better than getting something that we wouldn't use or anything like that.  Went to church at St. Boniface.  That church is very large and doesnt feel like a community at all.  It was weird, when i went up for communion the Eucharistic minister spoke to me and my siblings in spanish, but to my mom in english.  That was a bit odd.  It was funny because Tommy did not know what he said, so i had to translate for him even though there is a mountain range near my grandparent's house in new mexico by the name of the Sangre de Cristo (blood of christ) which is what the EM said to him.  Therese and i made fun of him endlessly for  that.  We ate at Wahoo's fish taco for lunch, which was good and then had fish for dinner.  Tomorrow i have no idea what we are doing because we dont have to go to church, the rest of the family isnt coming over until sunday, and there is really not much to do around the house.  I hope we can go for a drive around Orange County because the traffic wont be bad and it'll be fun to see what it's like around here now.  About time for me to go to bed, i want Santa to come and leave me lots of fun stuff.  its about midnight my time, so nighty night."

Made three stops total, Flagstaff for food, Barstow for gas, and Victorville for food.  When we left Santa Fe it was 8 degrees outside, out here in Anaheim it is currently 58.6 degrees.  The trip was long and boring, we played the ""Spell whatever you see with chemical elements game"" where say you saw Car Wash, you would yell carbon, argon, tungsten, arsenic, hydrogen to spell C-Ar W-As-H.

It was nice.  i loved the contemporary art section with the weird coal dust on a canvas thing and the one canvas with many random drawings.  i also liked the big guy made out of styrofoam and the little figure looking up at it.  good times. i saw lots from the french revolution which is what we were doing in euro, so that was cool.  They had a big area with elements of design, beds, tables, toast rack, silver serving things.  it reminded me of the book, ""From the Mixed up Files of Ms. Basil E. Frankwiler"" where two kids live in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and sleep in the fancy exhibit beds and bathe in the fountain.  its a fun book.  we road the DART down there so i wouldnt have to park downtown, so that was fun.  today i just went to church and went christmas shopping for friends.  now im going to go bake some cookies and make some tortillas.  hopefully i dont burn the house down.  only have english final left, but that shouldnt be too bad, its scantron and only on frankenstein and whose afraid of virginia woolfe.  easy, but messed up books, especially the virginia woolfe one."

Spent the afternoon, night, and early morning writing history papers.  Im basically done with school unitl january cause my AP english final is a blowoff.  In english on wednesday we watched Office Space and ate brownies, quite enjoyable.

I cant wait to be on the road to New Mexico and California for christmas.  Its so relaxing just to sleep and then hang out with family and eat good posole and fudge.  Im scared that eddie (thomas) will not turn in my history final for me, so i wrote him about 20 notes and placed them all around the house, going down the stairs, on his uniform, on the sinks, doors, etc.  it was fun and if he forgets it, im gonna cover everything close to him (yes his pocket protector too) in yellow smiley face stickers, and then stand over him one night in my thriller dead hooker costume with full makeup, so he better not forget. just have to wait and see"

"event","been a couple of crazy days, but hey finals are approaching.  The drive to school on thursday was more exciting than usual because of a fight going on in the far left lane on Garland Road and Northwest Highway.  There were three guys attacking another guy in a SBC truck.  The guy in the truck was hitting them with the seatbelt and pummeling them with his fists as well.  This went on for a couple of minutes until one of the three guys pulled the other two away.  Their faces were all bloody.  It was weird.  Eddie and I both thought it would be a waste to call the police because the fight would probably end by the time they got there, so we didnt call them, but we saw a police car pass in the other lane.  Crazy, but that's the Dallas Police Department.
     That was the excitement on thursday, i finally finished my teapot, just had to do my Noguchi lamp this weekend and tomorrow ill put the paper on it.  I need to finish wrapping my chair in yarn for my final project due wednesday.  Finished my ""sketchbook""-i also did collages, scratchings, and watercolor in it.  OH YEAH! CONGRATULATIONS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE BISHOP LYNCH CLASS OF 2008: MR.THOMAS A. CATANACH!!!  He beat a football player, so the nerds have conqured the school! WHOOP! Im so proud of you my little (big) Vulcan brother!  Peace and tranquility in landrew (bows head). That was announced on Friday, but i was outside doing my theology work, so i did not hear it immediately.  I wrote my entire theology paper during third period on Friday and it was remotely good.  I did not make it to the dance recital Friday night because i had to do homework and bond with my brother and sister over pizza and pomegranate juice.  I went to the choir concert last night and they kick butt!  They certainly deserve to go to rome.  Amanda did an awesome job on her solo and the Percy the Puny Pointsetta song was very entertaining.  I had to sit on the floor next to bertie, but it's a choir concert so that did not really matter, except for the harmony piece in which we both laughed at anna.That's about it.  Gotta go to bed so i dont fall asleep in sister's class, never a good thing, she may decide to wake me up with hydrochloric or something like that."

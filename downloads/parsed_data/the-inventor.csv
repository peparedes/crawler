myspace.com/theebibleofdreams
There is a song up, recorded live in my living room this afternoon, yada yada yada.
<p>
In other news: I have zero New Years plans...except that I work for 8 hours that day. I thought 2007 was gonna be my year, but i'm thinking it might be 2008. 
2006 hasn't been the most respectable year for me. I went on tour over the summertime and that's pretty much all I have to say for myself."

Also, my new band is taking longer to get off the ground then anyone could have ever expected it to take. 
In the meantime, I have been making some music on my own. It's my solo voice, accompanied by occasional woodwinds or chimes or whatever other instruments that I can't play (and hopefully some songs accompanied by my friends as soon as I get the chance to jam with them). I'm going to be making cassettes and if anyone is interested in having one, let me know. I plan on making each one personal, and I think I'll be able to handle it since there will probably only be a few people interested. That's what I prefer anyway. Maybe if I ever do something that I actually think is good, I'll promote it.

This Christmas was nice! Pictured above are all the new generation family members, most of whom I hadn't ever met until the family get-together on Christmas Eve.
I was planning on hanging out with Tony tonight but now he's spending the night at his girlfriends house... All my friends are loving their girl/boyfriends today and I'm at home watching Season 4 Seinfeld dvd's. Kind of depressing but I'm coping, and it's cozy here at home.

""Q: What do you worry about?
A: I was standing on the corner waiting for the light to change when I noticed, across the street among the people there waiting for the light to change, an extraordinarily handsome girl who was looking at me. Our eyes met, I looked away, then I looked again, she was looking away, the light changed. I moved into the street as did she. First I looked at her again to see if she was still looking at me, she wasn't but I was aware that she was aware of me. I decided to smile. I smiled but in a curious way--the smile was supposed to convey that I was interested in her but also that I was aware that the situation was funny. But I bungled it. I smirked. I dislike even the word ""smirk"". There was, you know, the moment when we passed each other. I had resolved to look at her directly in that moment. I tried but she was looking a bit to the left of me, she was looking fourteen inches to the left of my eyes.
Q: This is the sort of thing that--

But then I get real ultimate hungry and always end up making big meals for myself, made up of all kinds of assorted mismatched food prodie. They are the most bizarre late-night snacks. Tonight was: tomato soup, hot chocolate, and a bowl of pineapple cubes.

I realized that I have been habitually sleeping on the couch in my living room for over 2 YEARS now.
17 year old Brandon -- I had just met Brittney, and we were hanging out just the two of us for the very first time. At my house, sitting on the couch. We listened to some records and I ended up kissing her and after she left I decided to stay right there on that couch.
I have been experimenting though. The other night I slept under the kitchen table. The next night I slept on Tony's couch. Tonight, who knows."

"event","Last night me and Tony decided to go camping and we got together a tent, some sleeping bags, some food, and drove out to Coloma.
We parked on the side of the road, hiked out into the woods, make a little rock firepit and gathered wood, eventually had a blazing fire going. It was freezing out there and a little scary at first but once we had that fire going and we layed out a tarp across some dirt we cleared off and were sitting back cooking s'mores...everything was fine.
It was really the most amazing night.
I'm telling you, the things like that little spontaneous rogue camping trip are the memories I will remember for the rest of my life and cherish.
I felt so good. My mind is completely clear up there.
We realized we forgot to bring the tent poles once we were up there, so we just layed out the tent flat and slept on top of it. Watched shooting stars. we got there around 10:00, and after the fire burned down to coals, we layed there and talked through the night.
I finally got to explain a lot of shit Tony, tell him what my life has been lately, tell him a lot of stories of recent life that he had never heard. It felt good to talk and it made me realize what a joke i've made.
we slept and woke up around 10am to birds sqawking. It was starting to drizzle, so we packed up and hiked back to the car.

We talked alot about things we want to do in the future. We worked up this big dream about hitchhiking across america with backpacks and finding places to camp out at night, or houses to crash. Or better yet, we were saying we'd just do it to Seattle and back, and that wouldn't take too long. The most beautiful places, northern california and oregon!!We would bring cameras and document our adventures  !"

I have decided to try to stop being so completely dishonest on here. Anyone who reads my journals, note the changes in my voice. I'm writing this for <i>me</i> now.

When I got home, I woke my mom, by accident. She is mean when she is half-asleep, and it's scary. She came out and start yelling at me for slamming all the doors. But I never slammed any doors. Then she went back in her room and slammed her door.

so what can I say? I think i'm finished with the lot of sillyness and miserable imagination that has been distracting my life lately. so fuck it.
Me and Patrick were listening to his homemade tapes in his house and talking about My Bloody Valentine and how we wish we could write songs and how we wish we were My Bloody Valentine. The night started out depressing cause we aren't My Bloody Valentine but slowly evolved into what was one of thee best nights. I guess we realized that we are still pretty good guys.

On my bizarre drive home I was wading through the thickest of fogs, passing other cars, and all I could see out of my windows was the little glow of their dashboards on their faces and the little glow in my own personal space/face. Just those two things in the fog. It was just the greatest little connection.
anyway, it was a very intimate evening."

I am going to go backpacking. I want to hike to the top of Half Dome. I did it with my dad when I was really young, and that's one of the best memories of my life. He cooked a can of ravioli's for me over the fire.
This is what half dome looks like:
<img src=""http://www.westford.com/fingerhut/Yosemite/Half-Dome-3.jpg"" width=400><br>
It is part of Yosemite National Park, in California.

It would be a 2 or 3 day trip. You have to stop and camp for a night once on the way up, and once on the way down. I really want to do it soon, but it'd be pretty miserable to do in the winter, so I plan to go in spring. I'm totally going to bring an indian flute and sit by the campfire and play it, but I need to get one and learn how to play it first. I will look at the stars and listen to the animal sounds and make jiffy pop over the fire and play my indian flute. I can also bring a grill to put over the fire, and I can cook up some garden burgers and of course some raviolis to carry on the tradition.
Going alone seems like it would be a peaceful meditative journey, but maybe it'd be more fun with a partner or two. That's always good cause you can tell stories around the fire. Yes, I will definately bring someone along. I will bring Patrick or something.

I really want to go back to Ghost Mountain too. Ghost Mountain is an area hidden up in the hills down highway 50 where a ghost town resides, and it has some really nice scenery. Only about a half hour drive from my house. Me and Brittney were driving around and exploring one time and found it. I took some pictures that day.
This is what Ghost Mountain looks like:

"event","work is fine. don't go back till friday. i've been sleeping more lately. i've never been much a nap-man, i usually reserve sleep for nights (and generally deprive myself of that as well). but lately i fall asleep in the afternoons while reading and i swear i hear conversations. 2 other people, separate from me, having conversations in my dreams. arguing, alot of the time. And i think that's where a lot of the meaningless sentances come from. i don't dream normally when i sleep in the day, and that's why i never liked it.

Tomorrow I get to see Inca Ore for the 3rd time in a month! It makes me even happier that she is collaborating with Axolotl for this night. That should be really good.
Thursday means first band practice with all 5 guys. We will try to write some songs. But i expect it will fall through, then i'll write a livejournal on friday complaining about it.

I hate my name. Brandon Kalarney. It's so bubbly and bouncy and goofy. It makes your sinuses close as you say it. It gives off bad vibes. if that name were a band, vibe-wise, i think it'd be something like The Dropkick Murphy's. Or Bowling for Soup.
I wish I had Vinny's name. I wish my name was Vincent Vargas. ...Vinny Vargas. V.V. Now that's a name. But Vincent Vargas would never fit me. I'm more of a goofball Brandon Eric Kalarney."

""I am not a dog hater. I do hate what man has made of his best friend. The snarl of a panther is certainly more dangerous than the snarl of a dog, but it isn't ugly. A cat's rage is beautiful, burning with a pure cat flame, all it's hair standing up and crackling blue sparks, eyes blazing and sputtering. But a dog's snarl is <i>ugly</i>, a redneck lynch-mob Paki-basher snarl...snarl of someone got a ""Kill a Queer for Christ"" sticker on his heap, a self-righteous occupied snarl. When you see that snarl you are looking at something that has no face of its own. A dog's rage is not his. It is dictated by his trainer. And lynch-mob rage is dictated by conditioning.""

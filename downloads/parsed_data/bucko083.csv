"event","Things are finally starting to fall into place it seems. I'm back to just the one job and I'm already way happier. I seem to have a plan for my future that doesn't involve me leaving which is always good. I just wish I could start my school so I can really begin the rest of my life. It's really weird because it seems more and more everyday that I'm getting older. Not in a bad way but just moving on with life and letting things fall where they're gonna fall. I can't remember ever being this relaxed and happy with the way things are so I can't even imagine how things are gonna be once I get out of school and my plans really start to unfold. I can't wait to be out on my own without my mom breathing down my neck everyday either. Just a few more months and that will be all over :)"

"event","things have been super amazingly crazy the past few weeks. it almost seems like i've lost my mind lol. i've been workin a shit load like 65hours a week and crap but i've been making so many new friends and going out and enjoying my youth lol. my best friends are about to have a baby, my sister is gonna have a baby, i have a new girl, things just keep coming on and on and on but it hasn't gotten to me at all. my outlook has changed and i've been so crazy happy about it i could explode. i've gotten to the point where almost nothin can just ruin my day because after all i make the choice weather or not to be happy, sad or otherwise. i'm finally just lettin life take it's path and going with the flow and it is so relaxing to not get all stressed over nothin. i pretty wake up in an awesome frame of mind everyday and i feel like such a nerd but i don't really care. it doesn't hurt that i wake up next to an amazing girl every once in awhile :) i just hope and things continue on the path they are for awhile cuz i kinda like how life is at the moment"

"event","Things have seemed a little strange the last few days. Old feelings coming around. New interests from out of the blue have been confusing my mind. I really just want to get away from a day or two just to kinda clear my head out. Can't seem to choose weather to go alone or not. I want to see the ocean and the rocks. It's been so long since I've seen or smelt or heard real ocean. It would be nice to have company but at the same time I'm not sure I want it. Maybe this one will be just me and chance. It's hard fighting back the urge to chase a flame. I'm not sure I'm ment for this right now. Being a good man sometimes just isn't any good at all. Well in terms of what I think I want. I want more friends to go out with, and for things like an ocean trip. I really don't want to work anymore. Life seems to trap me and hold me down. I know it's because I let my fears take control of my actions. My fears are more like a reaction to life's path. I want so badly to change and feel like sometimes I'm stepping forward and out but just not in strides. Baby steps are all I can seem to muster no matter how hard I try. I need to find a free spirit to try and help push me the rest of the way out the door and into the world. The world is bigger than tacoma and I think that's what scares me."

"event","well things didn't really go the way i thought they would. it was just one of those days i guesss. getting ready to work another double tommorrow. i'm trying hard not to think about it. i can't wait till i get the chance to go out again. it just sux haveing to work doubles sometimes cuz i can't enjoy the night life sometimes. i'm really glad i have the friends i do, even if when they try and set me up it doesn't exactly work out lol. tommorrow should make for an interesting evening. the plan is to hang out with an old ""friend"" so we'll see how that transpires. this weekend is hopefully gonna be full of some fun and new adventures. work saturday morning but i'll make the best of it. never know maybe i'll meet someone else new and things will go a new way. only time and life will tell."

"event","Here i am working two jobs like i never thought i would. one for lexus and one at petsmart as an early morning stocker. it's tough but it's life. gotta do what ya gotta do to get by. things otherwise are going ok. a little strange here and there but ok. it must be true that opposited attrack, or at least there is some truth to the statment. i've seen some people from back in the day and met some new ones and things are changing and life is going on pretty well much to my suprise. i've decided i'm done with the relationship aspect of my life for a little while. they make things complicated and i would like things to stay simple for awhile. i want to date i just don't want to be comitted at the moment. i've been out a few times and talked to a few girls and i'll just have to see how things progress as i get back into the swing of the ""game"". i can't wait to take the next turn in my life cuz i have no clue witch way i'm going or where i'm heading next. for once i'm kind of excited to find out the unknown. life is outside, not in a box, or at a cae wash, or a pet store, or in the same old town."

"event","holy crap i can't believe i still have a livejournal! i lost my password it's been so long. so much has happend there is no way to put it all in. so i won't i'll go with the recent. my birthday has came and past and it was fairly lame i was in bed by 1130. but can't really blame anyone but me in that case. things have been a little crazy lately. i work two jobs now and plan to join the navy. i'm stay with my mom again and that's no fun. i'm single again(boooo). i'm dying to hang out and go out all the time but rarely do simply because i have no people to really go with. the people i most like to hang out with are married or dating and can't go out with me without their boyfriend or they are to messed up and broke all the time they can't and don't want to go out. i guess i should start living a little more rather than staying in a shell being scared of losing money. if i weren't so damn cheap i might have a good time. but that's only gonna change with time i guess. it's time for me to really look at my life and get my shit straight. i need to take away my fears and get new ones, if that makes sense. 
current list:
being broke and not being able to pay bills
turning into the sad little boy i was in high school
not being able to make friends
not being able to keep old friends
becoming a super fatty lol
not being able to join the navy
not being able to lose the weight
CHANGE!!!

new list:
...


i guess i just need to see where life takes me. but the real thing is i need to let life take me where i'm ment to go. stop trying trying to force things to be what i'm used to and what is safe to me. embrace change don't fear it. i'm scared to death right now about what's gonna happen but i need to take off the training wheels and start new. i need to be ready for life. now lets see where this goes..."

"event","work is extremely lame. i really think i have a depression problem which is very sad to me. then again i could just be a head case that loves attention. ""look at me! look at me!"" my only true problems are my own inabilities. perhaps someday i'll fix it but i always say i will and never do so i'll say it again maybe some day.

no one knows what i've done
i know all the words to the perfect tragedy
trust in the words i say to you.
it's killing you to see me desperate
it seemed to stop my breath.
every second i'm without you i'm a mess
in your eyes you see my smile
i'm a fake!
you can tell by my vague perception
you read my slightest false tellings
but can you see past the blinder set here?
perhaps i've lost my head
if i cut out the bad
what would i have left?
my continuous speech seems to be as simple as E=Mc2
but the answer to happiness is quite simple in fact
your all that is left in the equation
life-bad=you
to cut out all the bad would lead to simple perfection
i will always have something left as long as i have you.
i'll remember every glance you pass my way.
every night with your head on my chest,
all the cliche lines could never replace the one simple fact
i love you. 

19years alive - 15years wasted = 4 years i've lived knowing you
being alive and living are polar opposites
to be alive is simply to breath,
to live is...

the forever unknown ""in love"""

"event","this seem strange but right. i feel i'm in a very weird state of mind. i want so bad to write and write well. but whenever i try and create something or do come up with something it is sad or depressing. even if that's not the way i feel. like now, i'm perfectly happy other than i can't sleep and i feel like puking everywhere. but if i were to write something it would entail heartache and love loss. i don't really know what that means. maybe that's just how i am. who knows what the mind is really like anyway.

there is no correlation
between mind and soul.
simplicity is a mindset 
lost in space.
perfection is a self imposed pain.
the heart is a perfectionist.
there is more to living
than being alive.
independence is a shield to the world.
love is independent to us.
bravery provides exclusion from fear.
the brave die alone.
the lie is
the good die young.
strength requires heart.
the heartless survive.

i live complete,
mind and soul.
i claim a mindset,
simple.
i possess one prayer,
perfection.
i can survive in the world,
indpendent.
i brave life,
alone.
i strive to be strong,
heartless.


when most get done reading this they'll be silent. it will be misunderstood a million times over. but silence screams to me. it apears jumbled and senseless, but isn't that all life is? one jumbled, senseless pursuit of the unknown? i know i'm really crazy, depressing and sad a lot of the time but i'm tired of the unknown. i'm done looking. i want to be done trying. my pursuit ends here. i don't really know what that means. i don't really care either. if i could explain it. it wouldn't make sense anymore.

Come to find out the next period he was killed by a train the night before. I didn't know the guy he was with but I've heard a lot of good things about him. I don't know anyone else more deserving of life than that kid. He was nothing but nice to everyone around him. And he was funny as hell too. I remember like the first week of school this year we were cheating off each others English homework. I want to do something for him...I can't think of anything good enough or big enough to explain how much me and tons of other people are gonna miss him. Me and him weren't the closest of friends but that doesn't effect the way I feel right now. Anyone who reads this and knew Andrew;or Dan cuz he deserves the same, we need to get together and figure out something to do for him, a memorial is the simple answer and yes we need to make one for them but I would like to do something else in their memory...something huge that will make everyone remember them, even the people that didn't know them. I just want everyone to see how awesome these kids were to all of their friends. I know there is a lot of people out there right now thinking about them so lets get together and try and figure something for them. Get back to me about this post and go from there


RIP-Andrew Cao and Dan Mattlab

i was writing random ass fun poetry on some of my gangstas walls today. i realized after writing and during, how much i love my friends. each and every individual one of them add to my world of happiness. their all quirky and sarcastic in some way that keeps me on my toes. thats what i need, to be kept thinking and pondering the most random and the most odd. i think i need that in a guy too. i like when im kept guessing. not that brain game shit, i dont like messing with emotions, but u know a quick tongue. however i may just need that in my friends period, not my boyfriend. i dont know. i feel like i have wells inside of me that get empty sometimes. but with my friends their always busting and alive. right now my stephanie well is empty. shes at school and i love this chic with all my heart. what i love especially about my friends is that just one of them can fulfill like 20 wells. weird huh? im talking about empty wells and such hahaha, but right now i miss colorado, i have empty wells. 

i want my friends. all of them. i want to sleep better than i am...

"event","2 more weeks until i go back to school. happy and sad about it i guess. i miss people endlessly yet being home is amazing. driving to the city, hanging out at maeves and coz's like its my own home again, eating good food, being in the place i know and love. i guess it'll be easier if the weather is as shitty as it is now when i leave, overcast and wet. but this be chicago. my favorite weather here is when its sunny with loads of white clouds, in the morning of the same day u can see from my window the sun coming up over the high way and trees, the sky is magenta. though its not the mountain scene i can sit on my roof and watch it come up. the best feeling when you see something so pretty and beautiful is that its all u think about, no bullshit creeping up in your brain. 

im sick as shit. i've been working doubles and cant sleep at night for some reason. so it caught up to me, my tonsils are swollen as shit and my nose itches so much my ears hurt. beer really doesnt help at all either, but of course my friends and i consider it a cure all :P 

new years was fabulous! except some sketch parts that arent totally clear in my head... oi. good times are  quick to come but bad decisions linger in my brain. whatever. whats done is done right? i shouldnt drink so much so quick. baaaaad news bears. 

i reccently listened to this song, the luckiest by ben folds. my bud told me about it and how pretty of a song it was. so i listened and it is really sad but at the same time is the sweetest shit. that and the trapeze swinger right now are my lullabies. others artists include, the band, 311, broken social scene, allman brothers, dmb, and pink floyd. shit son i've been listening to music 20 hours of the day. only way to be. 

my bud daniel may visit. hazahhh! i love that kid. and he gave me brighteyes... then we spoke of ass hairs.






i like...... amazing action/drama/historical films aka braveheart and gladiator

I don't get many things right the first time
In fact, I am told that a lot
Now I know all the wrong turns, the stumbles and falls
Brought me here......

Next door there's an old man who lived to his nineties
And one day passed away in his sleep
And his wife; she stayed for a couple of days
And passed away

I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way to tell you that I know we belong
That I know

That I am
I am
I am
The luckiest"

U. C. K. it. i have aced all my other finals and biology can suck my nuts. i swear next semester no screwin around. i need to hardcore buckle down. HARDCORE. hehe.... i cant wait to see my brohans and friends when i go home this saturday, shit man, an effing month with no regis buddies, no close quarters to psycho bitches whom i love, no getting ass.aaaaahhhhhhhhhh lol i kidd i kidd. 

i feel like i need to get out. i want to go have dinner. i want a night in the denver town. i just need to breathe. 

i didnt sleep last night, AT ALL. i was laying next to this kid listening to him snore. but i was comfortable. then the kid just flipped on over and was like 'im going to clean my room'. quite an ephiany eh? and yes it is somewhat clean. somewhat. for me it is clean. i can see floor. im going to pass out right after my exam that is in an hour and a half.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

whoa so like that was awhile ago when i wrote that but i didnt finish it. tonights my last night here, it was real nice. just hung out and chillaxed, ate amazing beau joes pizza and watche lock stock, score. however this boy is now passed out at 12.43 am, since about 11 pm. pizza, benedryl, and beer. dont mix, no one can withstand the benedryl... sad day for this wang, but days will get better. 

so this pizza, once agian amazing.

cheeksies left me today, and tex left me the day before. ((sigh)) i miss them already. its weird u know, almost surreal going home for an entire month. i want to see everyone so bad but at the same time, will it be like the memories? better or worse? i guess im almost worried that everyone, including myself, has changed. change isnt bad at all... but some change can be... suprising? i know i've talked to some pple who sounds like have alter egos, and if change is for the worse it just ruins the memories of the good times u know? but then again change can be for the better, we grow mature and become well rounded pple. so yeah maybe im not so scared?

home. flights on saturday. hm. am i ready to go home yet? i dont think i am. i want to stay in denver for a bit longer before goin home again. i was home for thanksgiving. im comfortable in denver right now... then after a month in chicago i'll be comfortable there then i have to come right back. ((sigh)) i just want to chill. be lathargic. but no. xmas break will be filled with lacrosse training, shopping, family nagging, and lonliness without my regis roomies :(

ENOUGH BITCHING!

I heart my friends here and at home. right now i havent seen many of them cuz of the bitch ass studying i've been attemting to do. and tex never messages me back. the skank. heehee.... 

on the boy front. whatever. im having a jolly ol; good time. i dont want to stress over stupid stuff and little things that u know what i dont really care about. its what other pple see that i cared about and im trying to fix that. i heart my girlies and know this, if a boy ever makes u feel like crap im going to kick the living shit out of them. promise.

"event","so im listening to this guster song and it fits my mood perfectly. lyrics to what im feeling is so-so but the beat is just mellow and ahhhh perfect. but then again what mood is guster not perfect for? i havent updated in a while.... idk why. i've had time, i guess im just a lazy ass. i also never keep up with this type of shit... facebook is an exception. 

im lost. i woke up in the middle of the night and i was just hurting for some reason. i was really upset, was it a dream i had? or is it present stress that my body physically cant seem to handle? whatever... as colley says 'its the single month curse' or something like that. its so up in the air, my feelings, i dont know where there going to land. it isnt a 50-50 either. its like a 70-30? i must not make any sense to anyone thats reading this but i do so its cool.

talked to my homeboy today... how i miss him. how genuine and authentic he is. we spent hours just making each other giggle and laugh till we had to run the bathroom to refrain from pissing our pants. 

for some reason i find it 10x easier to talk to another midwesterner, a santa fe-ian, a texan, and certain  colorado cats. cali or east coast are over my head. especially with midwestern dudes. the first boys i fell head over heels for were all from the midwest. personalities were generally different but the same.... aura? persona? idk what it was but it clicks u know? east coast pride meets west coast burnouts creating..... midwestern awesomeness. oh did i mention the bears raped the packers? fucking a doggie. maybe its not a midwest thing but a personality trait that i fall for? but i'll tell u this, i havent been attacted to any californianites, ir east coasters. i mean of course there are jackasses and bitches from the midwest that i want to slap, but i feel like im drawn to certain pple from the flat lands. 

talked to one of my bestest boys today.... over some nice hot choco... how i love this kid. no bullshit with him. not over analytical like girls, but straight up and direct. sometimes i need that, minus the maliciousness and bitchiness. just honesty. its so true that boys have different perspectives on a lot of thngs. i think their a lot more patient too. well the good ones atleast. 

i dont like being walked over. im not a damn door mat. i do however try to be as nice as possible, why be mean? but then again.... i cheat myself. i need to give back to myself. i think i wrote about this before. its not always about the person im trying to please but about myself. i have to be honest in what i want... my needs. no matter the risk i take right? fuck it. right now let me just dwell in whatever the hell im feeling. thinking to much about junk makes my brain into mush. im just to aggressive and always need to get shit done....

We keep embellishin upon a new uncharted path
Expressin what we see and how we comprehend the math
So there's enough for everyone we gotta make it last
We gotta make it last..
As I embark on life's journey from the point where I'm at
Peace to everyone I know or who I go way back wit
Every pimp every mack, every gangsta to jack
Every hustler feedin babies, anybody pro-black
Every sister raisin kids without the help of a dad
Wantin for they children all the things that they never had
All the brothers handlin business even though shit's hard
Wakin up at five A.M., holdin down three jobs
All my rasta brethern gettin insight from trees
To my brothers up in college gettin Ph.D's
Or any other degree, even if you just read
For mental health, see you're concious that your mind is free
All my people locked down, for your past mistakes
Mentally and spiritually, dwellin past the gates
You could change your ways, elevate today
To all recovered alcoholics chillin up in AA
Every black-owned business, keep doin for self
Helpin out the community and spreadin the wealth
Understand that help ain't gonna come from nowhere else
Revolutionaries makin the unjust get dealth wit
Head on black people got to meet the task
Educate, keep learnin, gotta question, ask!
And let your light keep shinin and remember the past
By any means necessary, we'll be free at last

"event","So its around 2 am here, and im wide awake. im thinking a lot, and i had an awesome convo with my Pooch. no not that little fat gathering on the stomach. u know we go through life trying to satisfy so many people in this world besides ourselves. isnt that jacked up? i mean self gratification 24/7 shouldnt be done always, thats just plain selfish. but honestly, to be a healthy, happy, content person you must do things that are good for you, and only you not bystanders of YOUR life! i have to tell myself or really ask myself everyday... is this decison good for me? somtimes i find myself maybe to passive and its the confrontation that scarfes me, but maybe its good for me. for my well being. 

christ. help me. past memories have suddenly found a breath of fresh air. not good memories neither. the ones you hope to forget in due time, but for some reason have a constant place in your brain that turns up every so often to remind you, to haunt you. i hate it. i wish i could sdo the eternal sunshine mind erase thing... although the moral of the story was about memories and experience throughout life. well when im in a funk then thats when i have super friends to come save me from myself. without them i would've probable swallowed myself alive.

why do people say girls are confusing? i dont think we're that confusing... okay we are over analytical, sensitive, judgemental biatches.... sometimes. but hey thats the fun right? trying to find the comlex puzzle pieces of our minds... although no boy has ever seemed to succeed. but then there are those guys who may girls over analyze and stress.... thats because we want to figure them out (boys). i know for myself... i hate being weak. i hate showing weakness (thus i hate crying). all my life i have been 'the man' in the relationship... or what i can call a relationship. and it was always fun and what not, but thats cuz i never felt so damn vulnerable. its an uneasy feeling for me. to catch myself thinking of someone more than twice a day is a defeat for me... god. im pathetic. 

i really liked this dixie chicks song... idk where it came from but its on my itunes.

I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly

I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars

Oh it sounds good to me I said

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you closer to you

I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall

I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile

Oh it sounds good to me
Yes it sounds so good to me

it was hysterical, my brother and my sisters bf josh stuffed a whole tangerine in their mouths and just ate it. i lost 2 dollars.... dang. 

i took some grrreat pics last night at the hookah, lisha called me all drunk too hahha

(fuck yes) and i had an amazng breafest. then i did all my shit and ate more good korean food then went to clarkes with some good ass company and ate the most amazing nachos, chicken wings, and mozz sticks. oi. by the time i go back to denver im going to be a giant buttball filled with clogged arteries and chicagoan food... oh the life!

besides food, seeing my friends has been so damn good. everyone looks different in that time span of 3 months, is it maturity? all i've been getting is that im extra tan, which isnt so bad i guess, i mean its better than ""ur obese"" or some shit. 

Payton is here. eddie and danny are camping so he's chillen in our home. the dog is a fucking pain. u look at him and he is prolly the most adorable and good looking dog ever, but hes a demon. rips apart everything, pees everywhere, and is so hypreactive u'd think he had doggie ADHD to the max. reminds me of me when i get no sleep.

plans for tomorrow! watching a movie getting some sweet ass lou malnatis for lunch and getting crunk at my boys hizhouse. that was suprisingly ghetto if i say so myself. i cant wait till thanksgiving, my sister was baking her pies and cakes today and i thought i was going to shit myself they looked so damn good. 

i however do miss colorado. just looking at the sky wanting so badly to see mountains. but to pffft.... flat. i miss little aspects of colorado too u know? like for some reason i think the air smells differnet and the sun is wayyyyy brighter in denver.....

short yet meaningful conversation i had today... masks. well psychological masks. people have a front that they put up all the time you know? whether it be the 24/7 happy perky person, the hardass, the bitch, the peaceful mediator... everyone has a point break and is two-sided. i dont think many people understand that these days. people have different emotions depending on day, week, hour. however to be so negative for a long time does damage the aura and good karma of the person, so dont be such a pessimistic biatch! whoa talk about switching topics... just saying, people are a lot deeper than u think, and what u may think doesnt harm them or hurt them may be doing just that.

i was watching ice age today, then i remembered how amazing kids movies are. with all the inuendos for the adults and then the gangstah hilarious humor for the kids too. i miss being a kid sometimes. it is an innocent age. innocent in way where nothing really matters but playing with the toys ur momma just gave you, eating the foods u want to eat without second guessing yourself, not taking showers for weeks at a time (although my friends do do it here...), and finally no drama among friends besides 'hey u took my lincoln log'. to be a kid again.... would be amazing.

...cheeks is sleeping now, stevo and dryte aka teabags are watching officed space and at 218 am i need to write 2 3 paragraph essays... maybe i'll get up in the later morning and do it. not to sound creepy or nething, but seeing someone sleep is very relaxing. no im not staring at them or nehting, but it puts u in a calm mood because the expression on their face is just so at ease and all their stress is wiped away. i was watching someone sleep the other night... i wish i couldve taken a picture. the look was really pure joy and peaceful. for someone that has lots of shit on their mind to finally rest their eyes and face is relieving to me as well. haha the 'oh' face scene just came on, oh that silly boy.

do u ever wonder what life would be like if u were seriously in someone elses shoes? like i always wonder how my life would be if i grew up hispanic or italian or someone with a load of money or someone with none. its a weird feeling when u think about it actually.... makes me feel grateful for what i do got, but really curious in what i couldve been and shit like that...hahha so philosophical...

oooo kc told me bout this site... and said it was a stress reliever so guess what...i'll doooo it. hmmm... i just came back from the avalanche game, it was quite fun although they did lose.... but now i get a free meal at chipotle cuz i won the bet! which i felt bad about in the end :P i dont know why but i feel so down. i had a horrible course of dreams during mynap today...prehaps thats the reason.... idk but right now everything is going great and yet i feel like just going to bed and not waking up till midday and eating a buttload of orange sherbert. i guess i miss home. i miss my friends mostly. i talk to them and all a lot but its not the same thinking that their like hundreds of miles away. and since they were with me through that awkward high school stage i feel like they'd understand how im feeling now than my close firends do here.... i love them so much, all of them

arghhh angry rant: i dont understand not nice pple. w t f mate? w t f? pple that take advantage of other nice pple just to make themselves feel bigger or stronger or whatever they want to be called are the biggest wuss's of all. nice guys dont finish last cuz there is such a thing as karma and it'll bite them in the ass one day, but it sucks to know that it'll take that long and maybe they wont beleive its karma and go on doing all that evil malicious shit that they do. JUST BE KIND! it'll only result in a happier world...darnit pple! wooo sahhhh.....

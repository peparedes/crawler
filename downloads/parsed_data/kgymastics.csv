"event","Hello anyone who is litening.  I have not written anything sense Feb.  Wow it seems like a long time and so many things have happened to me.  School is almost out and almost another school year has passed.  Its hard to believe that there are only 2 more years of highschool left for me.  I am scared.  Yeah I want to grow up but im scared of failing.  I feel like I should know what I want to be when I get older and there are so many things I MIGHT want to be but I am not positive and what if i FAIL??? Life is so hard sometimes I feel like there should be more hours in each day so I can accomplish everything that I need to and still eat and sleep.  Life is so overwhelming at times and somethings are so confusing.  I read other peoples journal entries and I am scared.  I learned something about an ex boyfriend of mine and how he can be such a great guy but make really bad choices.  I didnt want to be with someone like that anymore.  I want someone to care about and talk to.  I want someone who I can tell anything and know that they care and will always be there.  I need someone to enrich my life and give me flavor.  Whats up with everyone else?  I am almost 16 years old and am scared to death of the future.  I have this great picture in my head of what it will look like.  I am scared to love.  I dont feel like I know what love is.  Help me show me open my eyes.  Kattie"

"event","Hello All I have not written in such a long long time.  It seems like forever.  So anyway.... I had the most greatest night ever on Saturday.  I went to my schools ""Winter Formal""  its like prom.  I just went with a few friends I didnt really want a date or anything just a night with my friends and it was great.  The dance was pretty and everyone looked really beautiful.  I found one of my good friends and she tried to get me to dance.  I didnt in the beggining but after the dance started getting better I was dancing like CRAZY.  I have nevr danced so much in my life.  Everything was perfect.  She really is a great person and I am happy to have met someone as nice as her.  She brings out self confidence in me that no one else brings out.  I have been waiting for a friend like this and now I finally have one.  Well she is wonderful and everything is going great in my life.  Track season is about to start and I cannot wait to get back into shape.  I think I might start eating better and try and drop a few pounds.  Ok well everything should start going really great.  I gotta go for now.  I will try and write again soon.  Love Always Kattie P.S I am so happy things are changing for the good in my life.  Everything is starting to make sense and I am loving it.  Gotta Split.  Bye!!"

"event","Today nothing really great happened.  I had play practice afterschool till 6pm.  Its a funny play its a musical called ""Bells are ringing"" I dance and sing in it.  I think its going to be a lot of fun.  The new semester just started and I am going to try and do really well.  I cannot wait till next year because it will be a lot more easy that this year.  Winter Formal is coming up.  Its a lot like prom.  I am not sure if I am going with a date maybe just some friends.  So yeah I am single and have been for almost 3 weeks.  I want a boyfriend but someone I can really talk to but have a lot of fun with. But yeah does anyone want to talk?  Anyone else feel overwelmed with life?  Someone want to be friends? Write back.  Always Kattie"

"event","last night i drove to elk grove at 3am and picked up 2 white motorolas(mdma)and ate one of them. by far the best drug experience ive had in a long fucking time. me and buddy journeyed around the track for an hour or so. i still have one pill left but im going to keep it in reserve! jay got his GED, im fucking proud of him hes really turned things around, im supposed to meet up with him later tonight. me and dave went to ocb yesterday and ate until we couldnt eat no more. o and in other news me and nikki are gonna be friends for now and if something more happens it will happen. im really happy with where our relationship is now. we fgucked around for a while and had fun but she is seriously an awesome friend and i dont want to screw that up. anyways im done for now!"

"event","it was weird being outside and actually watching the rain turn to snow. tensions were high today at work, andria said she was about to cry because things were getting so hectic and crazy.i got out a half an hour late and then met up with jp. we played guitar and keyboard at his apartment for an hour or so. so i asked nikki out on a date last night. thats right A DATE, usually id just say do you wanna hang out but i threw in the word just to see what she would say. she was extremely happy which is weird considering we hang out all the time. i guess she is just happy im trying to go to the next level with her. or something like that. my older bro brought home hot wings from hooters. FUCK THAT. i ate two and now my mouth is hotter than the inside of john goodmans ass!!.......uh, yeah ill close with that. -peace"

"event","i etched your name on all four of my walls the least you can do is follow me
follow me along a ring surounded idea and i shall meet you at the beginning,
a beginning that is so vital to us,
one that could base an entire new language on itself alone,
so what if its the wrong thing to do
look where the right thing has gotten you"

"event","Once again i am going to attempt to create and mantain a livejournal. i doubt it will last long but we'll see. i saw the band band called isis at the metro last night. My friend didnt want to go alone and it was free so i went.it turned out to be awesome. Thanksgiving was decent.  it sucks though because im kind of caught in an age gap. theres really little cousins and then adult ones and im in the middle. so i just went back and forth between serious conversations and super mario smash brothers all night.i have that crappy feeling where i think everyones doing things better than me. but most likely theres not much going on tonight. i dont know what im basing that on but it makes me feel better inside! i could have gone downtown tonight with some friends but i just dont have the energy tonight. allright im heading off to bad. goodnight!"

"event","I dont know how im supposed to feel right now.  I'm surprised, crushed, numb.  But for what reason? not even a big one.  Sally made out with my old friend Billy at a bluc on Thursday.  No big deal just making out, but..its I dont even know.  I just thought Sally and I were gonna hit it off. Steph was going on about how much Sally liked me, now this?  what the hell! im gonna be stuck listening to it for the next while.  2 classes with her, and this is what im gonna have to sit through.  Its Billy, ive known that guy since gr 4.  Nice guy, but just...not right for her.  Ya, a bit of a biased opinion coming from a guy who's head over heels inlove with her.  It just...I dont know fuckin know anymore.  Ive said that several times now.  Its not like her and I were dating.  I just have the same feeling I had when Erin dumped me last February.  That sense of extreme loss and betrayal.  Like life almost seems impossible from here on in.  Suicide over this? fuck no! Depression is just that emotion that always finds its way back to me.  Its all too familiar.  I fuckin hate human emotion.  Why'd God create such a thing, to torture every human being.  Tease them and say HA! IN YOUR FACE!  Fpr christ sake its 2 am and im still down about this.  I dont know what the hell to do or feel right now.

Oh god I wish For The Mathematics would choose me as their new drummer.  Moving to Toronto in the fall.  Thats my dream right now.  Leave this city behind and get the fuck out.  Im sick of everyone here.  The 2 other bands aren't doing as well as I thought they would.  I need that escape to happen!! so badly

I love that line. Ah man, I thought this year was getting off to such a good start.  It's always this time of year I hit this pothole of shit.  I fall into and get stuck for a few months.  I FUCKIN HATE IT.  Sally and I were getting so close again.  I dont know whats gonna happen to that now.  Alcohol, I hate it.  Everyone drinks it but me.  For crying outloud, Jade confessed her love to me tonite.  I had no idea what to say...she's like the greatest thing I have right now.  I dont want to lose that in ANY SORT OF WAY!!

Im done whining for tonite.  I fuckin hope stuff starts shaping up or else there will be hell to pay

"event","so ive been in a pissed off mood for the past little while.  There's no I can talk to, no one to help me and no one that understands.  YAY FOR BEING A TYPICAL TEENAGER.  If I had my choice id move away, and never look back.  I hate my life here.  My supportive friends, or lack there of, always there for me.  THANKS GUYS!!!  Who says I wont be famous?  mmmm my dad, Jamie, guidance.  Yup so much for having a dream when your parents dont believe in you!! I might have the chance to play on a tour across Canada, and what happens when I tell Jamie, he says ""dont count on it"" only cuz he's one of my best friends, or was and always likes to say things to show he's happy for me.  He always has to upstage me at everything.  My band Blind Ambition is playing a show this FRiday in Belleville, and everytime ive said ive had a show in Belleville, he's always had to say he's playing a show somewhere better like Montreal.  Yup thanks man, love you too, great support you show NOT COMING TO !!ANY!! OF MY SHOWS!!  yup you're an awesome friend telling me Music Night wasn't good and that we could've done even better when I thought it had been our best performance yet.  Then again, how good is your concert band? best in Canada? DIDN'T FUCKIN THINK SO!!

My dad, frustrated with me cuz he thinks im throwing my life away by wanting to be a rockstar.  So I humour him by saying ill go to University and get a post secondary education.  SO I bring my report card home 2 days ago and he flip[s because my marks are as follows... Music Theory - 72%, Ancient Civilizations - 78, Music Performance - 78% and English 75%.  Average report card, and yes I was disappointed in myself, but that just doesn't seem to be good enough for him.  I dont HAVE TO go to University.  Id rather tour now and get known, but noooooooo cant do that, ill get kicked out of my house and not be allowed to graduate!!  Yup my dad and I aren't talking anymore.  He doesn't believe in what I love, so fine!  Nothing I do is ever good enough for his standards so I might as well just give up now. 

My friends at school.  Yup, dfont hang out with them anymore, why?  Im never invited to anything, then again I dont take great pleasure in getting drunk and high all the time.  Ya  but then again I guess im fucked for life cuz everyone does that these days.  Yup, its there life and they can do what they want.  But they can do it without me.  I dont know one friend who does anything besides that, not even my bands!! Sure I smoke up, but not all the time!!! All my friends talk about are their 20 year old guys they drool over 24/7 but will never have a chance with,  I guess thats what I get for going to a school with a female population majority.  Maybe that was a wrong choice in my life.  

I dont know what im going to do anymore.  My life has somewhat come to a dead end.  Being a rockstar is not being practical, especially without the support of my FRIENDS AND FAMILY!! Everyone gets high and drinks fuckin 24/7 so looks like Ill have no one to hang out with later on in life cuz no one has matured yet and realized that having fun all the time and being immature isn't what life is about.  I dont plan on talking to any of my friends anymore.  I dont feel respected or wanted so thats how its going to be.  I might just do what Terry did and just not show up for school and get expelled for missing class.  Cuz as I see it, my lfie is fucked up enough anyways, too much hmk, too much pressure, too much drama, nothing ever gets resolved even though everyone says it will but it doesn't!!  Why strive for stuff ill never have?!"

"event","Ugh, its been awhile since ive updated this thing.  Maybe its cuz im too busy or just didn't feel like it. Who knows.  So much has been going on.  I'm inlove with a girl I can never have, music night is tomorrow and Friday, im not in Jacquie's band anymore/never was really and im so fuckin tired.  Sally and I are slipping apart.  My other friend Laura and I have been getting really close.  Sally has been acting really weird for the past month and a bit, and I dont really know what to do.  Somedays, like today, we're cool and talk, and other days we just dont talk at all or even ackknowledge each other.  Man Ive totally fucked that situation up.  And to add to the problem, ive completely ruined every chance I could ever had with Becca.  That drives me crazy!! I know everyone says that if shit hadn't worked with Becca id want to be with Sally, and this whole situation would be switched around.  But I dont know, I mean feelings are feelings.  Jade tells me I should go with neither, but what about following your heart.  Then again I dont have a heart since its been fuckin broken many times, I doubt it even works anymore.  My Cd's skipping, hold on......and it has now been switched to Funeral For a Friend.  What a great band, I really wanted to see them With Taking Back Sunday and ATREYU!! omg I love Atreyu so much and im so frustrated I couldn't go to that show in Montreal, would've been amazing. Oh well, im sure they'll be around again.  Im going to ALEXISONFIRE at Capitol, thats exciting.  Ive been dying to see them.  Well at least I hope im going *knocks on wood* Matt was supposed to get me a ticket, so I dont know whats going on there....ANYWAYS

I dont know what else is new......Mel's coming back to Ottawa for music night on Friday, thats exciting, except I think she's bringin her boyfriend Brian.  Oh well, im sure he's a great guy and hopefully he treats hr with lots of respect.  I know I would've.  Geez love is a bitch...my stomach hurts since I haven't eaten all day.  I was on Canada AM on CBC Radio 1 this morning with the Canterbury Brass Quintet for Grey Cup promo. And I quote ""now we have the Canterbury Brass Quintet, FEATURING Jon Busby on Snare Drum"".   FEATURING?!?!?! I was only accompanying them, oh well, credit is awesome.  Rumor has it we might play the Grey Cup fanfare we played on air at the actual game.  Thats nerveracking.  Playing a short 1:30 song infront of like 50,000 people or whatever many are there.  Anyways, if I think of anything else ill write it later"

"event","SO I just had band practice.  Im probably gonna get mono now cuz Brad our vocalist has it and was just here, but he said he wasn't contagious.  Either way, im sure ill get it, just my luck and all having a bunch of shows coming up.  It went pretty well, this was sort of like his tryout for the band.  He's qutie a good singer and screamer.  I look forward to the show tonite.  So there's this party at some dude's house near Hurdman tonite and everyone is going, including Sally, Becca and a bunch of other people.  I want to go, but dont want to go at the same time.  For all I know they could both be doing stuff with other people, so whatever.  I really don't care.  I have the show tomorrow night, which neither of them are going to.  Yay.

As well today, I kinda got payback on Sally.  We were setting up for our spirit event in the cafe during second period, and my friend Mishele came over and started sorta flirting with me.  She was all wrapped up in my vampire cape I was wearing and leaning against my chest and stuff, then Sally turned around.  I was like ""HAH! IN YOUR FACE!"" but at the same time ""damn..."" or ""does she even care anymore?""  According to my friend Laura, she said Sally might, but you know what, she's always been talking about Ben, so whatever.  She has no right to get mad.  She dumped me!"

"event","So today was an alright day.  I'm still sick but yet again, had to go to school.  Ancient Civs was the same as always and English totally blowed because of the fuckin debate I had due.  Dr Frogley is so biased and it totally fucked my team over, what a jerk he can be sometimes.  Im still in my Silverchair obsession.  They're like my favourite band ever, so incredibly good.  I had practice with one of my bands which sounds quite similar to them.  Practice went well.  Mark and Alex are great guys and I feel great pleausre for being in a band with the two of them.  Tomorrow my practice with Jacquie got cancelled, but its a half day so im looking forward to that.  Life is somewaht getting better, but it still not the best it could be.  I really hope it will look up even more in the future."

"event","So this past summer was probably one of the most hardest experiences I've ever incountered.  SO ive got my two best friends Becca and Sally right?  I met Becca in gr 9 and the two of us were good friends and then decided to try and date and see what happened, but at that time Becca didn't want a long term relationship and thats what im all about.  none of this one night stand stuff.  Im all about ACTUALLY liking a girl and trying to make something of it.  SO that didn't work out back in April.  Sally is kinda like my sister you could say.  Her and have the same taste in music and alot of people say we act like a married couple.  I've known her since gr 10 and met her through Becca.  Anyways ever since the two of us became close, we've always had this small crush on each other.  ANYWAYS, so this past summer, Becca starts liking me again and since im such a frigin push over, I start getting feelings for her back as well.  Now at this present time Sally is dating my guitarist of my band, Matt.  The two of them have been dating for like 8 months and broke up once in the middle.  Now I invited Becca and Sally to my cottage for a week.  BIG MISTAKE.  Becca then told me that Sally really liked me and I was stuck in the situation of, ""who am I going to choose?!?!?!""  Now it was weird because I liked Sally and Becca liked me, and once Becca found out that I had feelings for Sally as well, she started kicking herself ALOT for not trying it back in April.  SO I like Sally and Becca likes me and the funny thing is, is that Sally told me she would be fine with me going out with Becca because her feelings for me she said would probably last for a long time since she's already had them for 2 years.  Becca on the other hand said she probably wouldn't be able to be my best friend if Sally and I hooked up.  Bad thing is, I liked Sally, not Becca.  So, end of August comes around and the girls are pressuring me into deciding which one and honestly I dont know who to choose.  I liked both of them, they're best friends and all 3 of us are best friends.  Now being a smart guy you'd think that I would've just be like ""I dont choose either of you because our friendships are too special and strong.""  but you see, that would be hurting me.  going out with Becca would hurt Sally.  And going out with Sally would REALLY hurt Becca.  After lots of thought and consideration I was finnaly like ""alright I choose Sally because her and I have more in common and I could see myself with her more in the future."" As well, prior to this big fiasco, her and both agreed we were soulomates and could see each other getting married to one another in the future.  SO Sally and I hooked up......


Now, to the present....

So school starts.  Becca and Sally aren't talking and Becca is giving me the cold shoulder for reasons you read above.  Now you'd think things with Sally would be going good right? WRONG! Sally and I had some problems showing each other how we felt about each other meaning we didn't always hold hands in public, stuff like that.  So just to my fuckin luck, he mind starts to wonder.  She ends up getting this crush on this dude Ben.  Let me tell you about Ben.  He's in his 20's has a girlfriend and Sally knows, FOR A FACT nothing will happen with him, but she dumps me?  Wanna know why? cuz she doesn't think its fair to me to like both of us at the same time.  She says she still does like me, but yadda yadda yadda. She doesn't want to settle down know although she told me I was the perfect guy for her blah blah blah.  But she still DUMPS ME! Why?! why would you do that?! sorry her words were ""PERFECT GUY""..umm when a gf tells her bf that he's the PERFECT GUY that usually doesn't cue the dumping angel to fuckin arrow me in the heart!  

So now Sally and I are broken up.  She's getting mad at me cuz I dont talk to her anymore or act weird and quiet but you know why?! CUZ ALL SHE DOES IS TALK ABOUT BEN! Im sorry, would you be happy if I just totally smahed your heart into pieces and then started talking about my future crushes?? NO, DIDN'T THINK SO! And then she has the nerve to get OFFENDED when I asked for my sweater, book and CD's she borrowed from me back.  She also got defensive when I said I had a celebrity crush on Linsay Lohan.  Uh come on now people hey, she just dumped me!  Now being the nice guy I am, I dont blow up at her about this, I grin and bear it.  And the one thing that is always crossing my mind these days is, ""would it have worked better with Becca"".  She was inlove with me, and I chose Sally over her...but then again, I bet if I had chosen Becca and this situation had happened, Id be saying the same thing, just about Sally.  But atleast I might have had Sally to run back to.  Becca on the other hand no longer feels the same for me anymore.  Now im stuck in a big fuckin hole.  No best friends, no girlfriend, almost no friends.  Could life smack me in the face anymore?  Its just my frigin luck."

""Blue""

Looking through black and white albums, lives the brightest tint of blue i've seen

Amongst the pigments of the others,
Is the only blue I see
No black or white has saved me
It's the blue that carries me
I know i'll fade without blue,
But I must let the color free
Still, this prism is a jail cell
Why wont the rainbow let us be?

And in these black and white albums, lives the brightest tint of blue i've seen.

Now, one day just wont count
When there's others to come
If I cut out the heartache
Then this body'd go numb

When these curtains go up
Will the viewers just shun?
Or will they throw in their kercheif
For this thoughtless act one?

The Drummer Starts,
The singer dies
The audience awakes
Opens up its white eyes
Authorities enter
Letting out hollow sighs
They take him out
Fill his void up with lies

Then they'll break him apart
While he's dressed all in pink
Should he be ambivilant
To what the rest of them think?

The Drummer Starts,

Is he through
Is he done
Are the satisfied yet, with this

""The Need For a Visible Loss""

I thought all these feelings were fone
I thought I was done
I thought I was past this
I thought I had won

But here I am crying 
I'm watching myself fail
Too depressed to work
I feel i'm on the same trail

I hate being a burdon
But I really hate dying
I'm losing to addiction
Am I even trying?

I hate lying to you
You're so honest to me
I don't deserve your insight
When i'm to scared to even see

Confusion is breaking me
It's not that it's pushing me back,
But rather holding me still
'Till I hear every bone crack

And I can't start again
'Till I watch myself lose
Can't get back on track
'Till i've felt each empty bruise"

""Don't""

Don't push me 
Or i'll take you down too
Don't tell me 
It's just between me and you

Don't tell me
What to believe
Don't force me
I have the world to perceive

Don't hold me
I'll escape your embrace
Don't lie to me
You think i'm a disgrace

Don't cling to me
Because I know you'll push me away
Don't love me
It contradicts what you say

Don't nurture me
You've done a terrible job
Don't compliment me
You think i'm an unfaithful slob

Don't touch me
Your hands are filled with hate
Don't comfort me
It's your fault i'm in this state

Dont try to fix it
Just let go, let me fly
Don't hold me in
It's time we said goodbye"

Dwell not in the puddle-<br>

Stand upon a solid ground<br>
Though winds be ever strong<br>
Just clutch the dirt beneath you<br>
Then bellow out your song<br>

When night has tempt'd your courage<br>
Fly without a fear<br>
When sandstorms steal your sight<br>
Fight back- Awake your ear<br>

""Help me Think of a Title or I'll Die...""

Living this life beneath the stars
Alive to what one knows
Fleeting to a cognitive world
To reality, nothing shows.

To feel this true inner emotion
To learn what lives inside
Escape society's binding arms
Rules shall not abide

Speaking with one's own heart
No impulse to arrest
No one to second guess your faith
To have hope without a test

THe freedom to love the loveable
To feel whatever comes
TO learn what you truly love and hate
And release the pain that numbs

To live without the weight of life
Ease the throbbing pain
Disreguard the faults of the earth
Live life not in vain-

Beleiving what you feel is fit
No one to tell you you're wrong
Not having to give up things
Just to simply belong

The chance to find yourself
Admittance of what you lack
A place to never dwell on the past
And never have to look back

Another day under the sun
Baked from years of heat
Thrown upon the ground
Can't move from being beat

Another night out in the cold
With no light to guide the way
Horizons, hopes, and faith
All been ripped away

Another noon without a lunch
Nothing to consume
No one offers a hand
For they know not what to say

Another monelouge to be done
This scripted life's a play
With characters done poorly
For they know not what to say

Another morning in the mist
The fog that never ends
Hopelessness and fear
Are all this breakfast lends

Another blackened wound
Amongst the morning scars
The nothingness the heal
Scattered beneath the stars

Another bleeding sigh
Coughing up despair
A need to finally breathe
A need to find the air

Another fight to lose
Never gain a win
Never recieve forgiveness
Even though there is no sin

Another set of eyes
Unforgiving as they be
Covered over with shame
To they point they cannot see

Another sleepless night
Followed by exhausted day
With a past that keeps on haunting
We'll never get away

Another pen and paper
To speak from out my heart
To finish up my ending
And return back to the start"

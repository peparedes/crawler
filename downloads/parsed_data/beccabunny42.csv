"event","Yesterday, I saw a bird fall to the ground. (I only saw the last foot or so of its fall so I don't know if it fell out of a tree or what). It didn't look injured, but it was just sitting there and didn't really move when I prodded it. So I took it to the local wildlife rescue (so the cats that sometimes hang out near the geology building wouldn't get it), and they told me that it was a <a href=""http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Cedar_Waxwing/id"">cedar waxwing</a> that had probably eaten some fermented berries and got too tipsy to fly, and that it should be fine in a couple days."

"event","Today, when I left my hotel to go to dinner, the first thing I noticed was that there were police directing traffic at the bridge into town. The next thing I noticed was that the streets were closed to vehicles and full of people. I heard religious music and words coming from loudspeakers placed throughout the town. When I came to the first street corner, I saw a huge (maybe 10 x 15 feet) image of Jesus made of flowers, seeds, stones, and the like. There were several of these [<a href=""http://www.jujuyenletras.com.ar/jujuy-html/costum/semana-santa/semana-santa.htm#ermitas""><em>ermitas</em></a>] throughout town. As I walked toward my favorite restaurant (which happens to be half a block from the church), the crowd grew thicker and there were marching bands [<a href=""http://www.jujuyenletras.com.ar/jujuy-html/costum/semana-santa/sikuris.htm""><em>sikuris</em></a>] of children and young people with drums and pan pipes preparing. I&rsquo;ve been hearing this same type of band around town the past week. Soon, the procession began. First came the bands and their wonderful cacophony. Next, a wooden cross wrapped in white cloth, then a statue of a saint [San Juan], then the body of Jesus lying down in a glass case [Cristo Yacente], and finally the Virgin Mary [La Dolorosa]. No, finally, hundreds (maybe more than a thousand) of people walking slowly behind.<br /><br />When I returned to my hotel room, I read about Semana Santa in Tilcara online to better understand what was going on tonight and what I might expect in the next couple days. <br />Here's a link (in Spanish, but there's always Google translate if you don' speak Spanish) if you're interested in reading about Semana Santa in Tilcara: <a href=""http://www.jujuyenletras.com.ar/jujuy-html/costum/semana-santa/semana-santa.htm"">http://www.jujuyenletras.com.ar/jujuy-html/costum/semana-santa/semana-santa.htm</a>"

"event","Yesterday we left Salta and drove north to Tilcara along Route 9, which is very pretty. Tilcara is less than 150 km (as the crow flies) from Salta, but the change in climate is dramatic because it is 1300 m higher (at 2500 m) and in the rain shadow of the mountains to the east. As we came up the Humahuaca Valley, the trees disappeared from the hillsides and were replaced with small bushes, grasses, cacti, and bare rock in various shades of red, orange, green, gray, and purple. The weather went from 28&ordm;C, cloudy, and humid to 22&ordm;C sunny and breezy.<br /><br />On the way to Tilcara we stopped at Purnamarca, where there are beautiful red and orange hills (Cambrian and Cretaceous rocks overthrust by gray-green Pre-Cambrian rocks). We then continued up the road from Purnamarca that heads up towards the plateau. We drove up to 4170 m, where we had great views of the salar in distance to the west, snow-capped peaks to the southwest, pretty folded rocks outcropping on the hillsides, and big puffy white clouds building over the mountains east of the valley. We stopped along the road to look at the<strike> Cambrian quartzites, sandstones, and shales, Ordivician sandstones, siltsones, and limestones, and the Pre-Cambrian shales </strike>rocks in more detail, since I will need to be able to identify them in the field. There is also extensive fill that forms smooth horizontal surfaces near the sides of the valley. It&rsquo;s quite impressive. We also looked at some lake sediments within the fill that had fossil leaf imprints.<br /><br />In Tilcara, we checked into the hotel I will be staying at for the next month, walked around town and bought food for today, took advantage of the wireless internet in our room, and went out for dinner. It turned out that the restaurant we chose has live music every night starting at 9:30 pm. They played traditional music of the region, and were excellent in my opinion. There was a mandolin (or something similar) player with a big floppy hat that covered most of his face and long blonde dreadlocks whose hands moved so fast you couldn&rsquo;t see them, a guitarist/singer with a big voice, and a guy who played a type of flute, pan pipes, something like an alpine horn, and drum.<br /><br />I should be in the field right now except both my adviser and I are sick today. So instead I am reading the report (in Spanish) that goes with the geologic map of the area and writing my journal entries. Doug&rsquo;s been sleeping off a fever all morning and I&rsquo;ve been going to the toilet every 20 minutes. I&rsquo;m going to be more careful about what I eat from now on (i.e. no more mixed salads for a while)."

"event","Last weekend was really fun. Friday evening I went out for beer and pizza with my labmates, then I stopped by a party for an hour or so, before driving to Franklin's for the weekend. 

Saturday morning we had a nice sleep-in, then we hiked the Towsley Canyon View Loop Trail (http://www.localhikes.com/Hikes/TowsleyCanyon_4472.asp) in the afternoon. The trail started out fairly flat and as we strolled along, we saw a lots of pretty birds and a little gopher poking its head out of a hole. Next the trail entered a fairly narrow canyon, where the creek was running high from the recent rain, and we had to pick our way across it hopping from stone to stone using a big stick for balance. After that, the trail rose up a series of switchbacks. Along this part of the trail there where tar seeps. I enjoyed watching the tar flow slowly out of the hillside along with a trickle of water making pretty patterns; I also enjoyed poking the tar with a stick. At another point along the switchback, there must have been some hydrothermal activity because we saw and smelled sulfur. At the top of the switchbacks there were some nice views. We got back to our car a little after dark and got a ticket for being in the park after sunset.

We got back to Franklin's just in time to change and eat a quick dinner before heading out for the evening's entertainment, a musical play called ""Wisdom 2116"" by Ray Bradbury. It was at tiny little theater in South Pasadena, and Ray Bradbury was actually there! Before the show, he gave a little introduction that concluded by him showing us a medal he had around his neck and reminding us that a couple years ago he was made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters by France, and as commander, he commanded us to enjoy the play. The play itself was really weird, but definitely enjoyable. 

As if that weren't enough excitement for one weekend, the next day we went skiing! We drove to Mount Baldy, where we had bought season passes for $50 each (less than a full day lift pass). Unfortunately, a lot of people wanted to take advantage of all the fresh snow that last week's storms dumped in the mountains. It took us about 2 hours to go the 13 miles from the freeway up the mountain, so we only had a couple hours of skiing, but it was a good couple hours!"

"event","In my last lj post, I mentioned my lack of sleep and the ""fun I have planned for this weekend."" Well, the weekend didn't go exactly as planned (though it was still more good than bad)... <lj-cut>

Here's what was supposed to happen Friday-Sunday:
Friday morning I had a field trip to Point Mugu for my advanced structure field trip. I was supposed to meet with Bodo (a prof here) to get help with some modeling for my comps project when I got back from the field trip at 1pm. Then I was going to leave by 5pm to drive down to Pasadena, and Franklin and I were going to go to a birthday party from 8pm-10pm before driving to San Diego (arriving around midnight at the house of Franklin's friends Jim and Ami). Saturday we were going to spend the day at Sea World with Jim and Ami and their two kids Micah (4 yrs old) and Lucy (1 yr old). In the evening, Franklin and I were going to go see David Bazan in concert. The next morning we were going to go to Mass with Jim and Ami (they're very Catholic) before heading back to Pasadena that afternoon.

Here's what happened:
Friday morning I went to Point Mugu. We were supposed to meet back at the vans at 11:45 so we could back to UCSB by 1pm. At 11:40am I decided to go to the far side of the outcrop to quickly get some attitudes on the faults over there. When I was done with that I looked at my watch (which I keep 2 minutes fast) and saw that it was 11:47am. I ran to the parking lot only to see the vans pulling out onto the highway. They left without me! I immediately tried calling the cell phones of everyone in the class whose number I had, but no one had their cell phones on. I called one of my officemates and had him look up more phone numbers for me. It took over half an hour before I managed to reach anyone, and by that point they were almost back to UCSB. Long story short, I had to wait until 3:20pm until someone arrived to pick me up. So I didn't get back to SB until 4:30pm. This meant I was late leaving for Pasadena. So we weren't ready to leave for the party until almost 9pm, ans when we went to leave my car wouldn't start. We called AAA but since it wasn't the battery or out of gas they couldn't do anything except offer to tow it. (We did deduce that the car wouldn't even try to start was that it was somehow stuck in ""reverse"" even when we put it in ""park."") So we decided to leave my car at Franklin's and take his (fairly unreliable) car to the party and San Diego, but at this point it was after 10pm. We only stayed at the party long enough for Franklin to say hi to his friends and then drove to SD, arriving around 2AM, and getting to bed around 3AM.

Saturday morning we were woken up at 6AM by Micah trying to have a conversation with us (well, with Franklin; I pretended to be asleep in hopes that I might actually fall back to sleep). As cute as the conversation was, I could have used a couple more hours of sleep. We spent all day at Sea World and that was fun. We saw several shows (Shamu, pets, sea lions), looked at cool animals like beluga whales, polar bears, walruses, penguins, sharks, pet/feed bat rays, went on a couple rides, etc. 

By the end of the day I was pretty tired. I fell asleep on the short drive from Sea World to the concert. We had to wait 1.5 hours from when the doors opened to when the first band came on. Franklin sat down on the floor while we waited and started a trend. I laid down with my head in Franklin's lap and napped before the show started. By the time David Bazan came on I wasn't able to stay awake at all, even though we were standing up now. I would start to fall asleep on my feet and have to lean on Franklin to stop from falling down. At one point I had to sit down on the floor because my legs were just dead tired. As I drifted in and out of consciousness I enjoyed the music when I could listen to it, but I just wasn't there. We decided that we should go back to Pasadena that night, so I could get a full night's sleep (rather than being woken up by a four year old at 6AM again). I woke up a little bit when we left the concert, but I started to fall asleep again as soon as we were back in the car. I felt so tired and felt so bad about ruining the evening with my tiredness that I was struggling not to cry in the car. As I was sitting there trying not to cry, Franklin decided to poke my nose to try to wake me up so I could help him with directions since his GPS wasn't working. This upset my delicate balance and I burst into tears, sobbing about how tired I was and how I was sorry for ruining the evening. This reaction was so ridiculous that after a minute of crying, I laughed uncontrollably for another minute before falling asleep again. I slept the whole way back to Pasadena and then slept another 11 hours or so.

Sunday afternoon we called AAA to tow my car to a nearby mechanic, and I was going to take the train back to SB. When the tow truck arrived we put the car in neutral and Franklin and the tow guy pushed the car while I steered. I wanted to open the window to ask them a question, so I turned the key and the engine started! So even though we couldn't put the park in park, we could start it in neutral. I wish we had figured that out Friday night. So we decided not to tow the car and I drove back to Santa Barbara that evening (after watching the latest episode of Glee on Hulu)."

I was already eating chocolate chips at 10am this morning, though I managed to stop myself before I made myself feel physically sick to match the sick feeling of dread of impending deadlines.

"event","It was awesome. <lj-cut text=""Click here to read (a lot) more about it...""><br /><br />I arrived back in California about a week and a half ago after another wonderful summer with <a href=""http://www.lpcamps.org/general.htm"">Luethi-Peterson Camps</a> (LPC). LPC has about 5 different campsites in various countries each summer. This summer I was at the same site as last year: Birch Point in Harrington, Maine. It&rsquo;s a great site. It&rsquo;s a relatively small wooden <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4133"">house</a> with no electricity or running water &ndash; but it does have a pizza oven and a sauna &ndash; located on a tidal river. The view across the river is to the west, so we had many <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4212"">beautiful sunsets</a>. The best part about the site is Tim and Gail, the LPCers who own the house and live down the road. They are really cool and very nice. They helped us with any questions we have; they had the counselors over for dinner during PCTC; they invited the whole camp for lunch, swimming, and kayaking at Crawford Lake (where they have a small cabin); Tim led several small work projects around the house; they provided us with fresh veggies from their garden; Tim played guitar for us; and we got to help with the chores on their farm, where they have many adorable <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4117"">alpacas</a> &ndash; the kids doing chores were even the first people to discover the <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4116"">newborn alpaca</a>.<br /><br />Of course the best part of camp is the <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4661"">people</a>. We had 16 campers and 7 counselors from the U.S., France, Switzerland, Italy, Israel, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Lithuania, and Holland. The campers were pretty go-with-flow and a lot of fun, and there were no troublemakers. The staff group was even more fun! We had a lot of good laughs and everyone got along really well. We also had pretty efficient conferences and didn&rsquo;t stay up too late partying after conference &ndash; though I must admit to folkdancing at 1AM :) &ndash; so we were all well rested and had lots of energy for the kids. The camp was organized into three families. <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4131"">My family</a> consisted of me, Anya from Israel, Erik from Sweden, Jacob from the New York, Aleks from Poland, Vera from Holland, and Guillemette from France.  <br /><br />So what did I actually <i>do</i> while hanging out with these amazing people in this beautiful rustic place? Our daily schedule began with wake-up at 8AM, followed by Morgensport (a few minutes of some game or exercises), and breakfast at 8:45. We eat meals in families, sing before we sit down to the meal, and have &ldquo;anzagen, annunci, annou-ouncemnts&rdquo; after the meal. After breakfast we had an hour of Putz Pause (cleaning the house) and then half an hour of singing. At 11AM we had snack and the counselors would conference for half an hour while the kids had free time. After that was 1st course. Courses are led by counselors and campers alike, and can be just about anything: preparing lunch, sports, crafts, discussion, theater, games, music, making bread, dancing, writing, etc. Lunch was at 1pm and then we had dishes (&ldquo;we need four volunteers!&rdquo;) and siesta until 3:15 PM.  After siesta was either Together Time (usually a game outside, though really it could be anything with the whole camp together) or <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4646"">folkdancing</a>. At 4 PM we had showers for either boys or girls (alternating days), using solar shower bags filled with water from the pump. At 4:30 PM we had second vesper (snack) and either Planning Conference or Campgemeinde. In Planning Conference we plan the next two days (i.e. who is going to lead which activities). Campgemeinde (which has different names &ndash; conseil, Issues and Tissues, etc. &mdash; in different camps) is where people can bring up any issues they want to discuss with the whole camp (e.g. we want to change the policy on listening to ipods, we want a party, the daily schedule needs tweaking, any problems, etc.). At 5:30 PM we had second course, followed by dinner at 7 PM, and Evening Program (usually a game) at 8:30 PM. After EP the kids had half an hour to get ready for bed before Good Night Circle at 10. For Good Night Circle, every stands in a circle with their arms around each other, someone says a few words of reflection on the day, we sing &ldquo;Good night to you all,&rdquo; and then everyone gives good night hugs (if they want to). Then the counselors start evening conference and the kids had a half hour of quiet hang out time before lights out at 10:30PM. Conference usually finished by midnight and we would hang out for maybe another hour before going to bed.<br /><br />According to LPC tradition, Sundays are special days with a more relaxed schedule including a rolling breakfast and &ldquo;Sunday EP,&rdquo; where everyone gathers in the cozy room in their PJs and people share performances of songs, reading, music, etc. Our Sundays were on Wednesday and we called them &ldquo;Saunadays&rdquo; to avoid confusion. The day started with a &ldquo;rolling breakfast&rdquo; (of coffee cake or pancakes or something like that and hot cocoa) served between 8:30 and 10:30. The staff always ate breakfast together in the gazebo at 10AM, which was really nice. After breakfast we had Putz, then optional 1st courses before lunch. At 3pm the first group (girls or boys) went to the sauna. At 4 PM the second group went to the sauna, while the first group showered. After optional 2nd courses, we had pizza for dinner, eaten outside around a campfire if the weather was good. At 9 PM we had Sunday EP (or Saunaday EP in this case). Sunday EP is always one of my favorite parts of camp: it&rsquo;s so nice to see everyone share something of themselves, hear some nice music, hear things read in various languages, and just enjoy the cozy atmosphere.<br /><br />In addition to such normal days, we had a lot of special events throughout camp. Only a few days after the kids arrived, we went on our first overnight hike to the sandbar, which is a few hours walk from the house. I volunteered to drive the van with water, tents, tarps, etc. to the sandbar because I had strained a muscle in my foot slightly a few days earlier. We camped on the vegetated (with grasses and wild peas) part of the sandbar and had our campfire on the sand where the high tide could put it out for us when we were done with it. We had an absolutely <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4360"">gorgeous sunset</a> that night. We had another overnight hike towards the end of camp, where we split up into three groups that each did a different hike. Two of the hike groups spent one day doing work projects at the house and the other day hiking. My hike group spent both days hiking. We went to a lake surrounded by small mountains. The first day we started from Schoodic Beach hiked up and back down Black Mountain and then over to Redman Beach. The next morning, we hiked back up Black Mountain, over to the <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4560"">east peak</a> of Black Mountain (which had great views of lakes and hills out to the ocean), around Wizard Pond, and back to Schoodic Beach.<br /><br />One big highlight of camp was International Week. Instead of having a daily language course (as is common in LPC), we had a week where each person was in one of three language groups (<a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4406"">Basque</a>, <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4395"">Hebrew</a>, or <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4383"">Japanese</a>) and second course was dedicated to these language courses. Each group prepared a skit to perform at the end of the week and cooked a meal from the country where that language is spoken one night. It was a lot of fun and the skits were really good (so were the meals). <br /><br />Another huge highlight was going to visit <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4421"">Freedom</a> (another LPC site, for younger kids) on camp birthday (August 1). We drove down to New Hampshire Friday afternoon and that evening we performed our International Week skits for Freedom. The next morning we watched the Old Home Week parade and cheered on the Freedom Camp. That evening we had a party with the theme &ldquo;When old meets young,&rdquo; and we had the Birch Point (older kids) dress up like <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4435"">babies</a> and the Freedom people (younger kids) dress up as <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4442"">old people</a>. It was really cool to see another camp and to get to hang out with the Freedom counselors. On the drive back we stopped at a park where we had a picnic, swam in the lake, and hung out.<br /><br />Other special activities we had included family picnics, Open Day, Self Government Day, going to the movies, and going out for breakfast. When we took the kids to the movies, we told them that Tim and Gail had gotten a really good deal on a bunch of manure for the farm and we were going to go help shovel it into the truck for them. So we had the kids put on their worst clothes, bandanas, rain pants, etc., parked across the street from the tiny movie theater in Milbridge, and told them that we had to walk 10-15 minutes from there to get to the place where the manure was. Boy were they <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4271"">surprised </a>when we walked across the street and stopped at the movie theater! Open Day is when we invite people to come see the camp. We only had three visitors, but it was okay because we had planned it to be mostly like a normal day (except with singing and folkdancing in the afternoon when the visitors were there). As you can see from the <a href=""http://beccabunny.shutterfly.com/lpc/4706"">photo</a>, the kids went crazy on Self-Government Day. Just kidding! That was just a game they were playing for Together Time. The kids actually did a very good job of running the camp for the day. Another activity that was a highlight for me was making a treasure hunt for the last Together Time. I made an accurate map of the campsite with a couple kids. Then we (meaning me, another counselor and 5 campers) created a treasure hunt that used the map and various kinds of clues (puzzles, songs, games, directions, etc.) to lead people from one place to another. At each site they collected a piece of the final clue which led them to the treasure. We also had some birthdays in camp, which were nice. For Erik&rsquo;s birthday, my family made a really chocolaty cake which we ate all by ourselves after dinner. The resulting sugar high was totally worth feeling a bit sick: our family took over doing the dishes and had a lot of fun singing and laughing, and then I did cartwheels all around the house.<br /><br />I really could go on and on about everything that happened during camp, all the funny things people said, the good food we ate, all the beautiful sunsets, the songs we sang, the nice moments shared, etc&hellip;but I&rsquo;ll stop myself. Just the last thing I&rsquo;ll mention is the director training. During the summer, Terence and I were trained to be directors. The training went very well and we were both approved to be able to direct. Unlike last year (when I was trained, but wasn&rsquo;t ready to direct at the end of the training), it wasn&rsquo;t at all stressful. I think this was partly because I was more ready for it this year, partly because it was just two of being trained and not the whole staff, and partly because Tommaso (the director) made it not stressful. I&rsquo;m really excited to go to Christmas Conference (where the camps for the next summer are decided and important LPC decisions are made) and to co-direct a camp next summer!</lj-cut>"

"event","Today I hiked up (and back down) a steep slope covered with uneven clumps of grass most of the way up and scree at the top from 3850m to 4850 m. Then I hiked another  two and a half hours to Meta, though that felt pretty easy after the difficult descent. I am quite tired, but I feel really good about the transect. After Doug anf I collected the top two samples, we had lunch at about 4700 m, with an awesome (albeit fairly hazy) view of Annapurna II, Annapurna IV, Pisang Peak, Annapurna III, Annapurna I, Gangapurna, and Dhaligiri."

"event","This morning, we walked about3 hours from Metato Upper Chyako. Along the way we had great views of the rock wall full of dikes across the valley, a glacier, and several mountains. We also collected CRN and OSL samples from some lakebeds. After lunch at Upper Chyako, we collected the three lowest samples for the He relief transect we are doing here, hiking 100m down a little gulley then 400m up the hill to ~4150m. I felt quite energetic and happy all day. As we were coming back into camp around 6PM there was a strange pink haze, which had an interesting effect on the appearance of the snowy mountains. Tomorrow we will continue the transect as high as we can above Upper Chyako, then hike back to Meta."

"event","Collecting samples for the He vertical relief transect went very well today. We collected 8 samples from ~3500m up to ~4800m elevation over a horizontal distance of about 2 km. Bhim and I started at the trail (3600 m) and hiked up to 4000m, looking for good rocks to sample at 200 m intervals. It turned out that good rocks were easy to find as the hillside was mostly granite (good for getting apatites and zircons). At 400m, we had a nice view of Annapurna II, Lamjung, and just the very tip of Manaslu. On the way down, I saw a pretty flower that resembled an iris and the national bird of Nepal, the Himalayan pheasant (a brown female, not a colorful male). We then took the trail as low as we could, to a bridge at 3490 m and found a sill to collect our lowest sample. While we were there we saw two yaks cross the wooden bridge. We got back to camp at almost the exact same time as Doug and Vincent, who had collected 4 samples between 4000 m and 4800 m.

Addendum: After dinner there was a red crescent moon just above the mountains."

"event","Another beautiful day! In the morning, we climbed up and had a look around on the neo-glacial moraines above Lower Pisang, went down to the river to collect a CRN sample, then started hiking towards Koto, with great views of the Pisang Bowl along the way. After lunch, we spent some time collecting samples from a roadcut, then continued on to Chame, where I spent half an hour on the slowest internet I have ever used to write a few lines of a livejournal post and emails. About a hundred meters down the road, there were some people playing sand volleyball; I think it would have been a better use of my time to see if I could join the game. Leaving Chame, we had an awesome view of Manaslu with snow blowing off its 8162 m peak, which was glowing slightly pink in the late afternoon light."

"event","In the last week, I hiked from Bhulbhule to Manang, along part of the Annapurna Circuit, and back part way to Chame. Along the way we have been collecting sand (both from fluvial deposits in roadcuts and terraces and from modern streams) and looking at other interesting geology things, such as evidence for glaciers in the form of moraines, tills, and glacial striations on rocks. I'm learning a lot, getting in good shape, and enjoying some fantastic hiking. The first couple days of hiking were really hot and tiring, but the last few days we have been at higher elevation (up to 3600m so far) and the weather has been sunny and breezy and beautiful. I have also had absolutely spectacular views of Himalayan peaks. In typical Becky fashion, I spend all day just thinking how wonderful the world is as I hike through this amazing landscape, above the river, through forests, past snowy peaks, walls of prayer wheels and stones, etc. Tomorrow we head up the Naar-Phu Valley where we will collect rock samples for U-Th/He analysis and get up to around 5000m elevation. I will post my day-by-day journal entries when I have fast free internet."

"event","What am I doing in Nepal anyway? To help answer this question I have uploaded a pdf my comps proposal, which outlines the research I will be doing for the next 6 months or so, to Google docs. Email me if you would like to access it. As for the field work in Nepal, for the first half of the trip (until I got poison ivy) I was tagging along with Vincent, who was collecting sand from active rivers and from fluvial terraces to compare erosion rates ~30kyrs ago with modern erosion rates. The second half of the trip, we will be hiking in the high Himalayas to collect a couple vertical relief transects for thermochronology (my research)."

"event","The morning is a live with chirping, cooing, and crowing; it has been for at least an hour. It is now 5:30 AM here.  It is 4:45 PM in California, one day earlier. (I heard Nepal is 15 minutes off from the rest of the world because they wanted to differentiate themselves from India.)

We arrived in Kathmandu yesterday afternoon. My first impression of Nepal was haze and steep hillsides chopped into hundreds of small terraces. As soon as we stepped outside the airport, a swarm of guys were asking us which hotel, while we looked for Bhim (our contact in Nepal who is organizing the logistics and accompanying us). These same helpful young men carried our bags 50 feet to the car and then asked us for $20 for the service. As we left the airport, I definitely felt I was in a foreign country. Traffic is a confusion of cars, buses, bicycles, pedestrians, dogs, and cows, made more confusing by the fact that they drive on the left hand side of the road (when they are driving in any lane at all). Trash lines the street; beyond that, some laundry is drying on a barbed wire fence. Women walk by in brightly colored saris or those 3-piece combos: long shirt (to the knees), pants, scarf. The men are dressed mostly in Western styles, though several wear topis, traditional Nepali caps. The buildings are mostly brick and about four stories tall. The brightly painted storefronts advertise Pepsi and Castrol. We pass a packed bus with people spilling out the doors and sitting on the roof; a man squatting by the side of the road, reading a newspaper; four children standing around a square table playing a game that involves sliding pieces across its chalked surface; a sawn-in-half boar, somewhat horrifying with its bright red skin, black bristles, open mouth; barefoot women entering a flower-strewn Hindu shrine; a dirt soccer field. It smells like someone is burning something that should not be burned. We enter the tourist district, where a handful of shops repeat themselves endlessly. They mountaineering gear, skirts, bags, t-shirts, prayer flags, masks, thangkas, prayer wheels, maps, tea, etc. There are money exchanges, bars, hotels, trekking companies. The street is narrow and crowded with people: a man selling wooden flutes, beggar children in North Face jackets, trekkers, hippies, and everyone in between. Thankfully, our hotel is on a quiet side street.

After we got settled in the hotel, Vincent and I went out to buy pug adapters and an alarm clock, which was surprisingly hard to find. We had dinner at the Tibetan counter at a food court, which was unlike an American food court in that it took them a while to prepare our food. I had a noodle soup and Tibetan tea, which is made with yak butter, and tastes like drinking melted butter (but in a good way). When I got back to my room (around 7 PM), I was so exhausted that I flopped face down on top of my bed and promptly fell asleep."

"event","Franklin and I were finally going to go skiing again yesterday. We had put it off 3 times for various reasons and now it was our last chance this season, and I was determined nothing was going to stop me from skiing this time. So, Wednesday night around 8:45 pm I got into my car to drive down to Pasadena, but I couldn't get it out of park! For some reason the shift lock override wasn't working. I had actually had the same problem that morning when I was leaving Franklin's place to come back to Santa Barbara for the day to take care of some stuff, but Franklin was able to get it out of park then. So I spent over half an hour trying to get my car out of park, draining the battery even more (I think part of the reason that the shift lock needed to be overridden in the first place was because the battery was low), and getting quite upset. The fact that I was upset made me want to see Franklin even more, which added to my frustration because the thing upsetting me was also preventing me from being able to see him. However, Franklin, being the great guy that he is, drove straight from LA to Santa Barbara to try to rescue me as soon as he got out of class at 10pm. He failed, but I appreciated the gesture and at least I had him there. The next morning we got the car towed to a repair shop, where the car came out of park no problem - I figure something on the shift lock override was jammed and got jiggled loose when the car was towed - and they fixed some electrical thing that was probably causing the battery to drain, preventing the shift from unlocking when you step on the brake. The whole thing ended up costing me about $200.

It was kind of a bummer, but overall it turned out to be a positive experience because it made me appreciate how lucky I really am. When I was sitting in the car trying and trying to get it out of park, that was the most upset I've been in a long time. I think part of the reason I got so upset is that I was already feeling slightly stressed with trying to take care of everything I need to do before leaving for Nepal. Really, if not being able to go skiing one day is the worst thing I have to be upset about it, life is pretty good.  I'm pretty lucky to have the opportunity to go skiing in the first place; I'm pretty lucky to have a car that can break down. I'm lucky to be able to pay $200 and not have it cause economic hardship; I am lucky to be in grad school, where I don't have to worry about the economy so much, I get to learn, I get to live in a beautiful place with beaches and mountains, and I get to go to Nepal for free. I'm lucky to have a wonderful boyfriend who will drive 1.5 hours in the middle of the night (without even going home to change out of his business clothes) just to try to help me out. I even started thinking about all the other things, not directly related to this situation, that I'm lucky to have: family, friends, health, material comforts, freedom...I'll stop before this turns into me saying things like ""Isn't it wonderful to be human?"" ""Isn't music amazing?"" ""Isn't it nice that someone invented socks?"" ""Aren't you glad that flowers exist?"""

"event","Now that I've broken my hiatus in livejournal entries, I guess I'll try to bring my readers a little more up-to-date on my ever so exciting life.  I had geology field trips the last two weekends; I'll write about those in a separate post. 

The more exciting news at the moment is that I'm going to Nepal to do geology field work for 5 weeks in April! (I know there aren't 5 weeks in April...the actual dates are April 1 - May 7.) I just got my flights booked today, so I'm finally convinced that it's for real.  I will be accompanying a post doc (Vincent) mostly doing sampling for CRN (to determine erosion rates on ~10^4 year time scales) in the Lesser Himalaya of Central Nepal. I may also collect some more samples along the Marsyandi drainage for U-Th/He for my comps project. Doug (my advisor) will come for the last 2.5 week.  We're going to head north into the Nar-Phu Valley to collect some vertical relief transects that I could use for my comps project.  This will involve long strenuous days of hiking and one night camping at up to 5000m."

"event","I just got back from seeing Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater at the Arlington Theater in downtown Santa Barbara, and it was incredible!  They are celebrating 50 years, so the program consisted of a short video about the history of Alvin Ailey followed by three pieces: Blues Suite (1958), Suite Otis (1971), and Revelations (1960).  It was all amazing, though Revelations was my favorite.  I was completely overcome by the strength, grace, and beauty of the dancers, by the creative expression that humans are capable of producing, and by the range of emotion and experience encompassed in those movements and the accompanying music.  It brought tears to my eyes.  During Revelations, I found myself feeling connected to the hundreds of people in the audience who must have been similarly moved, to the dancers who must have worked incredibly hard to be able to create something so beautiful, and to all of human history leading to the creation of that piece and its performance tonight."

"event","I had a very nice Valentine's Day/ Presidents' Day long weekend.  Franklin came up to Santa Barbara Friday night and brought me <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30275948&amp;l=3df9c&amp;id=3501347"">pretty flowers</a> and delicious chocolates.  My present to Franklin was a small sample of the mineral Franklinite that I bought on ebay, a silly song I made up for him, and yummy food.  Saturday morning, I made gallo pinto for breakfast.  In the afternoon we took advantage of the gorgeous weather and I rode my bike and Franklin rollerbladed around campus.  After a nice dinner of caprese salad, gnocchi, and apple pie a la mode, we watched &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, which was a very good movie.&nbsp;We went out Sunday night rather than Saturday night because we're smart :).  We saw &quot;Coraline&quot; in 3D at the Arlington Theatre.&nbsp; This was my first time seeing a movie in real 3D, and I was very impressed. &nbsp; The theatre itself was also very cool because it is a real theater that happens to show movies, and the interior looks like a Spanish colonial plaza, with realistic stars on the ceiling and everything.&nbsp; After&nbsp; the show, we went to Chef Karim's Morroccan Restaurant.&nbsp; The service was great: they agreed to seat us even though they were supposedly closed and the chef came out and talked to us after our meal.&nbsp; The food was also excellent and plentiful; the ceremonial feast included lentil soup, salad, bread, b'stilla (a delicious filo pastry), the main course (vegetable tajine for me, lamb kebab for Franklin), and mint tea, fruits and nuts, and cookies for dessert.&nbsp; It was also fun sitting around a low pretty table and eating with our fingers.&nbsp; Monday, we slept in late, ate a big breakfast/lunch and then napped the rest of the afternoon.&nbsp; It was a little ridiculous, but nice.<br /><br />So that was a nice weekend, but really, every weekend is a nice weekend.&nbsp; Last weekend, we went skiing at Big Bear.&nbsp; They had gotten 8'' of fresh snow in the 24 hours before we got there (though we didn't get there until mid afternoon, so the powder was a bit skied up).&nbsp; Franklin hadn't skied in many years, so he signed up for two 2-hour lessons on Sunday. Saturday afternoon, I skied while Franklin did work in the hotel room.&nbsp; Then in the evening Franklin picked up his rental skis for the next day and we did night skiing on the bunny hill.&nbsp; It was fun to laugh at him not being able to get up when he fell down and trying to stop like he was rollerblading, but he improved a lot even in an hour or so.&nbsp; That night we had dinner at the worst Denny's ever. (We made up for it with yummy Indian food the next night...mmm, mango lassi).&nbsp; On Sunday, I skied by myself while Franklin had his lessons and we just met up for lunch.&nbsp; The bad part was that my bum got completely soaked because the chair lifts were wet with the melting fresh snow. The good part was that after his second lesson, Franklin was really excited to go skiing again.&nbsp; <br /><br />If conditions are good, we might go skiing this coming weekend just for a day - we're already going to a concert Saturday night. Then I have geology field trips the next two weekends.<br /><br />Fun, fun, fun.<br /><br /><br />"

"event","In my dream last night, I was driving while the person next to me was trying to read the map of Santa Barbara that I keep in my car.  Except the map wasn't of Santa Barbara, it was of the whole US or something.  So I said to the other person something along the lines of ""Don't worry.  In real life that map is of Santa Barbara, so this must be a dream.  Just keep checking and it will probably change into the right thing."" (which it did)

(Actually, my whole dream was about transportation... it involved going to Switzerland (and getting a parking ticket there) with a bunch of LPC counselors, but flying there via Australia.  I think it also involved an elevator, buses, trains, and a parking garage.)

Also, (unless it was later than I thought when I went to bed) I slept 10.5 hours last night."

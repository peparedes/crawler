There are only three bills to pay then it's off to Wal*Mart again. We should just move in there lol Hey did you know they had a bomb threat last week?! No one was allowed in for quite a few hours. Anyway, back to our plans. At Wal*Mart we need to pay on the layaway, buy a new bed sheet, a universal remote for the TV and who knows what else. Maybe a new game again? Or another 2/11 DVD deal? We will see.....</font>"

I didn't get to watch a whole lot of it because I was chasing a small bunch of rug rats around while the older kids watched it. Everyone seemed to have tons of fun and the parents loved how original the idea of having it at the theatre was. The kids loved the Bratz cake and the fact that they got to pick between 5 different sodas! lol <br />She got some really neat gifts. I have to make the Thank You cards now for the kids in her class that came. She also exchanged phone numbers and now has little friends calling after school! lolol <br />Thanks to Rhiannoninininin for helping me do the cake and soda! Much appreciated sweetie. Everyone had a good time so I would definately call that a success. Yay! <br />All in all it was a good experience. Renee...I almost walked over to invite you cause it was then that I realized I never asked you to come! I'm so sorry! You can come kick me in the tush for that. I also forgot to invite my cousin and her daughter so your not the only one but I'm still sorry. Didn't do that intentionally. <br />And, last but not least, Rhiannon came over afterwards and kicked my a$$ in both Phase 10 (which she never played before) and UNO. I want a rematch! lol She beat me bad...was fun. 2 a.m. came before we realized it and then the thing that went bump on the porch nearly made her stay the night. lol <br /><br />Great times this weekend. Hope everyone enjoyed theirs as well!</font>"

I heard her mom in the background say ""Is that Destyni's mommy?"" She said yes and her mom (who I know in a round about way) told her to ask me if she could still come to the party because she forgot to call. I said yes. <br /><br />Then I told her that she could talk to her but not long because DJ was in trouble. After 5 minutes of giggling and not really talking, I asked DJ to tell her that she couldn't talk anymore tonight and ask if I could talk to her mommy. Then I told her mom that Ashley (who is a girl DJ talks about ALL the time) can call anytime she wants to talk to her....after her birthday party, because she is kind of grounded till then. After that though no problem. Then we discussed the party. I'm glad that at least one of the girls she talks about all the time will be coming. <br /><br />I also made the name tags today for the bags of popcorn, however, now I have to make another one for Ashley lol I don't really like the way I did the ones I made already anyway so I think I'm gonna remake them. Then again maybe not. All I did was cut rectangles out of colored paper, punched a hole in the end and wrote their names. I can do better than that. And it isn't because I want them to look super for everyone else, I just know personally that I can do better. Sort of like a personal challenge I guess. <br /><br />Yes well. I guess I'll have go start plotting how I'm going to go spice up the name tags. G'nite. <br /></font>"

<p><font color=""#339966"">Afterwards we went to Pop Video to rend some movies but only ended up renting one...however, we bought two which brings our DVD count up to 101.&nbsp; We have DVD issues. lol&nbsp; Most of our movies however were out of the 2 for 11 bin at Wal*Mart so it isn't like we spend all our money on them and we've been slowly adding for 4 years now.&nbsp; I don't think that's too bad.&nbsp; If we had gotten that many at top price in the past year or something then I'd sit and wonder a little. </font></p>

Loyalty:

You value loyalty a fair amount.
You're loyal to your friends... to a point.
But if they cross you, you will reconsider your loyalties.
Staying true to others is important to you, but you also stay true to yourself.

Honesty:

You value honesty a fair amount.
You're honest when you can be, but you aren't a stickler for it.
If a little white lie will make a situation more comfortable, you'll go for it.
In the end, you mostly care about ""situational integrity.""

Generosity:

You value generosity a fair amount.
You are all about giving, as long as there's some give and take.
Supportive and kind, you don't mind helping out a friend in need.
But you know when you've given too much. You have no problem saying ""no""!

Humility:

You value humility highly.
You have the self-confidence to be happy with who you are.
And you don't need to seek praise to make yourself feel better.
You're very modest, and you're keep the drama factor low.

Tolerance: 

You value tolerance highly.
Not only do you enjoy the company of those very different from you...
You do all that you can to seek it out interesting and unique friends.
You think there are many truths in life, and you're open to many of them.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/thefivefactorvaluestest/"">The Five Factor Values Test</a></div>"

It makes me wonder if maybe they weren't handed out when I sent them because one time I got an invitation about 3 days before the party. Luckily the date to call by was the day before the party. Anyway, I hope there are a few more and that would make me happy. If not, oh well. She'll have fun anyway and it will be neat to have the whole theatre to ourselves! We'll feel all kinds of special. lol It's horrible to say but I wish I had someone to watch Billy because he isn't going to sit for a movie.....I know no one will though. It's ok, not like I'm not used to having my kids all the time! lolol One good thing, I never push my kids off on anyone. Oh, and if no others call or show (since I know some will show that didn't call which I hate) then I won't have to buy alot of cake, soda and popcorn. yay for us! lol <br /><br />Also, got a pretty good start on the kitchen. I'd say I cleaned it but I'm doing a thorough job so it takes like 10 times longer and won't be noticed anyway. I found that out today. Yeah well. After the kitchen, the living room. Kinda scared of that one. lol I make it sound bad but it's not so much dirty as it is cluttered and someone wanted to get on a high and mighty horse again the other day so now I'm doing it to the T so that once I'm done I can prove how and when he screws it up. Ass monkey. lol Eventually after the living room, it will be the bathroom then DUN DUN DUN the bedroom. *twitch* lol <br /><br />I'm going to jam a bit while surfing the net then off to bed. I get to call my sweetie(no not a boyfriend...old friend) tonight if I stay awake long enough...then again in the morning. Hope I can stay awake but I told him not to hold his breath because of my cold and the kids, I've been really tired the past two days. 10 a.m. won't come quick enough though lol <br /><br />Ok, if anyone wants to volunteer to babysit, or knows of someone coming to the party that forgot to call, let me know. There is a total of 5 kids so far...6 including her....a possible 7th if the weather permits their travel. If you feel spiffy, check out her gift registry at Wal*Mart.com. <br /><br />Later! <br /><br /><br /></font>"

for Triaminic and they informed me that they are voluntarily
recalling the following medicines because of a certain
ingredient that is causing strokes and seizures in children:

Orange 3D Cold & Allergy Cherry (Pink)
3D Cold & Cough Berry

They are asking you to call them at 800-548-3708 with
the lot number on the box so they can send you postage fo r you
to send it back to them, and they will also issue you a
refund. If you know of anyone else with small children,
PLEASE PASS THIS ON. THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF!

DO PASS ALONG TO ALL ON YOUR MAILING LIST so people are
informed. They can then pass it along to their families.

I'm going to go take some aleve and begin my recovery process, then start plotting DJ's party."

"event","In the morning Bu is supposed to be taking Billy with him to go get some dried fruit at the auction, batteries for Billy's toy and something else I can't remember lol.  We got the pictures.  They are so cute even though the camera was a bit off center.  I guess for $8 I can't complain too much.  Still wish I could have had them on disc.  

Cake is baked, just have to decorate it tomorrow (which is where Bu and Billy's morning out comes in handy) I'll just be using yellow icing and sprinkles.  Take a bath and vaccume, get dressed up for the hordes of people coming....NOT.  But hey, sometimes it just feels good to dress up, especially when you know your man likes it.  I'll even do the makeup thing.

When I was putting Billy's picture in the frame I took out the ones from 2 months and 6 months and laid all three of them side by side.  I can't even begin to let you know how funny it looked.  I thought (and many other's have said the same) that his looks didn't ever change....wow was I wrong.  lol  It was too funny.  

Yes well, time to sleep so I'm not to groggy tomorrow for those coming to see him and whatever."

Going to cancel the cake we ordered for Billy probably and instead of spending the $13 we were going to spend on that and spend $3 on toys from the party favor isle for on top of it and I'll bake the confetti cake I have in the cabnet. He doesn't know the difference and besides, I think 2 or 3 people at most are coming. We have to get batteries for the gift we got him, his pictures which are ready (so whoever comes on Saturday and wants one, they will definately be here) and one or two other things we need. One of them being a gallon of tea. lol </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>As it sits right now, George still didn't get back to me on when he wants to pick up DJ so I have no clue if she will be there Saturday or not, to those who want to come. Also, I pretty much refined the invite from whenever to whenever back to around 1 p.m. till 4 p.m. I think that is a good time span. That way I'm not trying to make dinner while we have company. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>Well, gonna go jam some more and ponder what spongebob things to get for on top of his cake. Also have to figure out how to get the extra pictures they always give you the option of buying at walmart when you pick yours up, for cheaper since when they were taken, I couldn't buy the disc like I wanted and now I can't get it cause they're computer was messed up at the time. Plus I'm not paying for extra pics at full price when there weren't even 6 poses taken like they are supposed to. </FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#33cc00>So, today the superindentant at the school called me back.&nbsp; He said he found out the reason the nurse was with the Truant Officer when he came to my house.&nbsp; At first I thought here come the excuses but he surprised me.&nbsp; He said the officer has had bad problems with some parents and now refuses to go alone.&nbsp; First off that just gave me reason to make fun of him for being a puss since they are supposed to be able to handle hostility, hell it's the job.&nbsp; Second and this idea I voiced, why did it have to be her that went with him when it could have been anyone else given the circumstances.&nbsp; He said he agreed and that she has not only been told never to come to my house again but she is not permitted to go with the officer or anyone else for that matter to anyones home.&nbsp; That made me a bit happier.&nbsp; Ok, it made me very happy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>He also said that if she were to ever return to my house for any reason or with anyone no matter who it may be, I am to call him immediately.&nbsp; That to me says right there that she was way over her boundaries.&nbsp; He also added that Ms. Bowen felt really bad about how upset I was over it and apologized.&nbsp; I didn't say ok, but I informed him that if the nurse causes any more problems, there will be more trouble from me, even if it means doing what I have to, to terminate her job.&nbsp; After I got off the phone I thought....if Ms. Bowen, the principal of the elementary school, felt that bad that I got so upset, why didn't she apologize to me instead of having the superintendant do it?&nbsp; She isn't sorry, she was just covering her own ass on the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>That's ok, I'm still waiting to hear back from the lawyer to see what he says about the whole thing before I let it alone.&nbsp; If there is something that can be done, it will be done because I'm still furious at the nurse for having the nerve when she knew she was the cause of the officer being there.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>Also, if I get a fine for her absences, I'm fighting it because Ms. Bowen assured me to my face that when the nurse sends a student home it is considered a medically excused absence and I didn't have to worry about getting one.&nbsp; Now they are saying they are unexcused and want doctors notes.&nbsp; </FONT></P>

"event","Anyone who knows me, knows how the nurse at DJ's school has been being a huge pain in the ass.  Well DJ has missed quite a few days of school so they sent the Truancy Officer to the door today to inform me that if it continues, we could get fined.  This didn't bother me because I knew that, and I know he personally isn't the one causing any problems.....HOWEVER, when he introduced himself he said he was here with the school nurse.  I poked my head out the door and nearly fell over.  That's right.  The bitch was sitting right there in the car!  Needless to say, I made if very clear that she was not welcome in my house and she can stay right where she is.  

Then I proceeded to explain everything to the truance officer.  After he left, I then called the superintendent of the school.  I told him I know he probably has no clue about anything that has been going on but I know she had NO right to step foot on my property and something had better be done about it.  I of course had to explain everything to him to bring him up to speed and then I repeated myself.  She overstepped her boundaries with me and had no right what so ever to come to my house!  He will be talking to her and calling me back by wednesday to let me know what happened.  

I also called a lawyer and will be hearing from them tomorrow to schedule and appointment to do something cause she is harrassing my daughter and it's gonna stop.  Nothing would have come of this had it not been for the fact that she had the nerve to come to my house.  Wench.  She has no right....she is a mere school nurse, a nobody, no authority to do that!  That's rediculous and it WILL NOT happen again.

Who agrees with me?  How would that make you feel?!  Am I over reacting?  I seriously don't think I am and those who know me know that it takes a lot to get me this fired up.  I was so mad all day I was shaking and my nerves were making my stomach tickle from the anxiety!

"event","The National Transportation Safety Board recently divulged they had covertly funded a project with the U.S. auto makers for the past 5 years, whereby the auto makers were installing black box voice\data recorders in four-wheel drive pickup trucks and SUV's in an effort to determine, in fatal accidents, the circumstances in the last 15 seconds before the crash.
 
They were surprised to find that in 44 states, the recorded last words of drivers in 61.2 percent of fatal crashes were, ""Oh Sh!t!""
 
In the remaining states - Oklahoma, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, Alabama and Texas - 89.3 percent of the final words were: ""Hold my beer, I'm gonna try something.""

The Kitchen Bitch
A mother was working in the kitchen listening to her 5-year-old son
playing with his new electric train in the living room.  She heard the
train stop and her son saying, ""All of you sons of  bitches who want off,
get the hell off now... cause this is the last stop! And all of you sons
of bitches who are getting on, get your asses on the train...cause we're
going down the tracks.""
The horrified mother went in and told her son, ""We don't use that  kind of
language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to
stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with  your
train...but I want you to use nice language.""
Two hours later, the boy came out of the bedroom and resumed playing with
his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son  say...
""All passengers, please remember your things, thank you and hope your trip
was a pleasant one. We
hope you will ride with us again soon."" She heard her little darling
continue...""For those of you just boarding, remember there is no smoking
in the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with
us today.""
As the mother began to smile,
The child added, ""For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR
delay, please see the bitch in the kitchen.""

That sounds like something I should be expecting to hear from Billy in 3 years.......if it takes him that long!  After all, look at his father.  Why should I expect anything different?  oy"

The nurse told me to put on a new one every six hours and now I'm running out of places to put it!"" I had him quickly undress and discovered what I hoped I wouldn't see Yes, the man had over fifty patches on his body! Now, the instructions include removal of the 
old patch before applying a new one.

While acquainting myself with a new elderly patient, I asked, ""How long have you been bedridden?"" After a look of complete confusion she answered... ""Why, not for about twenty years -when my husband was
alive.""

I was caring for a woman and asked, ""So how's your breakfast this morning?"" ""It's very good, except for the Kentucky Jelly. I can't seem to get used to the taste"" the patient replied. I then asked to see the jelly and the woman produced a foil packet labeled ""KY Jelly.""

A nurse was on duty in the Emergency Room, when a young woman with purple hair styled 
into a punk rocker Mohawk, sporting a variety of tattoos, and wearing strange clothing, entered. It was quickly determined that the patient had acute appendicitis, so she was scheduled for immediate surgery. When she 
was completely disrobed on the operating 
table, the staff noticed that her pubic hair 
had been dyed green, and above it there was 
a tattoo that read, ""Keep off the grass."" Once the surgery was completed, the surgeon wrote 
a short note on the patient's dressing, which said, ""Sorry, had to mow the lawn.""


********************
and finally...
A new, young MD doing his residency in OB 
was quite embarrassed performing female 
pelvic exams. To cover his embarrassment 
he had unconsciously formed a habit of whistling softly. The middle-aged lady upon whom he was performing this exam suddenly burst out laughing and further embarrassed 
him. He looked up from his work and sheepishly said, ""I'm sorry. Was I tickling you?"" She replied, ""No doctor, but the song you were whistling was, ""I wish I was an Oscar Meyer Wiener"".

Dr. wouldn't admit his name

Since I have yet to master the cut, I will be posted a few more times so they aren't all in one big block."

"event","OH man it totally sucks when im thankful to get more than 4 hours of sleep.  I think i'm starting to reconsider my whole ""sleep's a waste of time"" belief. now the six hours i had last night were totally sweet

so 1 month later, lets see what amazing events have arisen!
....alright so the last month hasnt been very exciting, but it was to me!  I saw Sin City with brother and many others graduates i havent seen in quite a few weeks/months.  Jon came home from Iraq and its kind of amazing and depressing how unaffected he is by killing multiple civilians and non-civilians.  Guess you kind of have to lose that compassion thing if that's your job.  Hearing about how he pee'd in the Euphrates river while under fire was a good laugh
     Sega Genesis is the shit by the way.  If i'm not playing serious sam, i'ts all about Vectorman, Road Rash 2, NBA Jam, or Mutant League Football.  now those are the days when video games were simple, yet creative, such as having a team made of mutants called the Sixty-Whiners and your wide receiver is named cupcake. oh man thats good stuff right there.
     I've also recently developed a love for old school rap. I'm talking about Grandmaster Flash, Run-D.M.C, BDP, among others, thanks to the A-bomb Lang.  Lines like ""Jack be Nimble. Jack be Quick. Jack jumped over the lamp and burnt his dick"", can't just be thought up anymore.  Hell yea Simplicity.  
So this was the broad scope of my life for the last month. doesn't it suck that you don't get know the full details of my life when i take this fuckin long to update?  I know i'd be pissed if I wasnt me...
Now I'm gna go to a BBQ at the donnely's house to wish Jon a good luck don't die kind of thing."

"event","So I kinda learned how to snowboard monday and it was quite the exciting time!  as you can tell from my mood thingy up there, im still aching from 2 days ago so that emphasizes how sweet it was!  I mean, i crashed into some rocks, I fell a few times, my foot popped out of the binding, and all in all, I kinda F'ed up Katie's snowboard a bit (sorry!). But she didnt mind.  rest of the day was spent on me ski-boards and that was some painless fun.  I think i'm gna have another go at it on friday too =)
I really don't know how much longer i'm gna keep up with this livejournal thingy.  This crappy server goes down more than half the times i try to get on it, in addition to the fact that i lose interest pretty quickly.  Oh, and I dont really like writing.  sooo...we'll just have to see what happens then"

"event","So a 3 day school week in which the first 4 periods consisted of our lovely HSPA testing.  With my lack of 11th grade english this year, I had no freakin clue our pursuasive essays had to be in some letter format thing.  If I get SRA'd for doing a half-assed job on those, well i think ill cry...  On the plus side, missed my Spanish and World Cultures test's for a whole week =) Failing sophie's world too.  I had no clue until i realized i failed both of my tests.  Class is still awesome and like K Black said, ""better get my ass kicked now than at the end of the marking period.""  Kind of surprised to hear that Terrence started that whole K Black thing.

After school activities still pretty much the same. play, work, jazz band, repeat.  Last night was a break from the ordinary with some good ol' system link halo2 at my house. ""The triumverate"": Me, alex, and pete vs McShane, Toth, Carr, and Bubba. We won 3, they won 2, lots of sticky grenades going around, so a good time for everybody.  Everyone was cool and I hope we do that again soon.
NO work today!! Laziness ensues...."

"event","It's funny how during school there's like a blizzard outside and they dont let us out early, but when they're threatening for 9-12 inches or whatever, they close school without it even starting.  so when it starts in the late afternoon and goes on all night, no school tommorrow ^_^
Now I's gna hang out with meagan so maybe ill update later

"event","Greek Peak was awesome.  Mortal Kombat is awesome. Rocky Horror Picture show is really fucked up.  Play is pissing me off less, probly because i dont exert half as much effort into it. Ignoring the people i hate and making new friends.  So life is good :-) Now for elaboration...

Greek Peak wasn't nearly the size i thought it was.  I was thinking Gore height, but it's only a little higher than Camelback.  But it's by far the hardest mountain i've ever been on, without it being icy as hell.  When brother gets his site updated, you should be able to see what im talking about.  So bob's family (my G-mom's boyfriend), his son, daughter, grandkids, etc. were pretty cool.  There was a combined total of 15 of us, only 3 other kids, but everyone was cool and a little party hardy.  And glades are fucking sweet to ski through."

"event","^^^That song is so accurate you have no idea

Going to Greek Peak this weekend!!  4 day weekend of skiing on some mountain that's probly a little bigger than Gore with the siblings, Grandmom, her boyfriend Bob(who's really cool by the way), one of his sons and his wife, and 2 of his grandkids.  Should be an awesome time, and if i'm breaking anything this winter, this is where it's going down =)

So I tried quitting the play since...well i hate it, generally speaking.  So Cohea started bitching at me, being spiteful, etc. so that made me not care even more.  But then Despina and Tara and others started getting involved and dragged me back in >:O  But then cohea started giving me more parts so it's even harder to quit now, not because i like it more, but i'll screw them over more now if i quit.  So yep, i'm whipped now...crap.  But hey, if i break something like i mentioned above, boyakasha im free!

High school drama bull crap continues as well.  It's not so much that boyfriend/girlfriend business,  but as i also mentioned before,  people are goddamn pricks sometimes when they're around other people.  Sometimes it's at a point where you'll make of your own friends for the sake of being ""cool"".  If you quit trying to impress people, you'll be better off i swear.  Is it only me that notices this because i'm the last one people want to impress, therefore people give me shit because i'll get over it?  Am i not as ""cool"" as some other retard or is it because you realize i dont give a crap how you act around me as long as you're yourself?  People and your wanting to be ""popular"" can suck it.(Not to mention it's laughable/embarrasing to see also)  Not sure if this makes sense to any of you, but in short, if you know who you are, quit acting like a goddamn robot.  

think i should write smaller entries?  Just have to get it out of my system"

"event","The comments section in this journal are supposed to be entertaining to liven up this journal a little bit more.  Anonymous people pretending to be the shit, (who are probly jus depressed emo faggots with lesbian haircuts that get off to sending hate comments......) do not fly well in this info.  I mean, at least put your name before i delete it, or else how fucking special you can act?  it's like that episode of mr. show with the night janitor that played all the pranks when he was the only one in the building. hehehe.  NO CARTOON PORN EITHER JOE!! :P  but seriously...no cartoon porn.  now that that's settled, i'm going to watch the most brilliant comedy ever: The Office.

oh, and any futher bs comments that go in here will be deleted right away.  as funny as sending a link to a cartoon porn site is, im gna have to delete it joe. sorry"

"event","This weekend rocked pretty hard.  The pipe plan did fall through as expected, but more  because i suddenly got this side-splitting pain that if i even moved it hurt like a biznatch.  eh....
Strangely enough, i cant remember a damn thing that happened saturday except for work...
And the 3rd annual ice bowl was a great success! Tackle football on a frozen pond is one of the greatest ideas ever conceived.  Only really brutal injury was when matt's face skid across the ice for like 2 feet and blood started just pouring out of his chin.  buts he's ok, it's all good.  OH! i also made one of our teams very awesome touchdowns =)  
End score: 24-34
Superbowl was pretty cool too, but not going into detail because the pats can suck it.  Paul McCartney's half-time show was pretty hot though.
And lastly, i missed skiing today due to multiple bastards being sick in school, so now i gots something too :/"

"event","So Montel Williams has an ego as big as the most egotistical kids in my school put together.  Hell, he's a got a mural on one side of the stage of just pictures of him.  But the trip was still fun, complete with free pizza, 3 copied autographs of him, and i got to hear about bullshit stories of people who tried to play heroes and got really lucky that they werent killed. I also heard additional less than likely stories about people that were kidnapped, and 1 of which was enslaved and raped....what a weird-ass show.  all in all, adventure at the ex-navy seal's talk show was pretty sweet
     Friday is the only salvation left in the week in which i dont get my ass kicked in the play...so now today i hit up the xbox live after school and got some pizza and it's all good.  After the homies(:P) left, I hung out with meagan and finally convinced her that star wars fuckin rules =)  Now i go to discover if we can pull off making a peace pipe wit some other fellas (Not with weed though, cause as all of you know already, that's some dumb shit) But more than likely, that plan will fall through, and we'll jus watch pulp fiction. I've wanted to see this movie since it came out (i was about 6 or 7 i think :P)  and play some warfuckinzone!"

"event","Sometimes I imagine humanity as one giant being made up of smaller individual beings, like Voltron. And when the Forces of Evil start acting up, we all band together to form the Mighty People-Tron! Europe would be the torso. Africa would be the pelvis. The Middle East the heart. Asia would supply the gadgets and knickknacks. Russia can be the hat. And America will form the ego! Yes. Impressive figure, this Humanity-Bot. A shining gleaming champion of justice and liberty. Until, of course, you realize there are no forces of evil besides our own damn selves. So this majestic Humani-Tor is always at odds with himself, in-fighting, bickering, hating on himself. A big ol' Robo-Hamlet, holding up a skull, going, ""What is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me."" He's been to the moon. He split the atom. He's made cool stuff. And he's also done some pretty crappy things too. The bad boy of Mother Nature, the one with Holy Father issues. Maybe he'll learn to love himself someday. Maybe he'll tear down all the walls and weapons he's built and get his groove back, you know?

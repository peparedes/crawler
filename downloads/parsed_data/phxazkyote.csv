"event","<p>Steadily I am getting sicker. (Is that even a word?) Oh well. Sore toncils and the coughing is kicking in. Too much yelling this weekend. lol.<br /><br />Now on to the anger moment. Yesterday early morning someone broke into my office at the apartment community&nbsp; that I work at. It was a clean sweep operation. My computer, printer, the raw cookies, my gym bag, and then the maintanence office was ransacked. Bastards! Why didnt you dump out the clothing in the gym bag?! That angers me the most.&nbsp;<br /><br />I did find one of my VS bras ws left behind, however the nike shoxs, bakers high heels, and my favorite ASU hoodie will need replacing. Soooooo 250 dollars later I have a new pair of running shoes, high heels,&nbsp; and running shorts. Currently I'll just use my FMA hoodie to run in until I find another ASU hoodie that I like.&nbsp;<br /><br />Meh... Stupid people.......<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />3:20 pm<br /><br />Well now that PCC is out of the way its time to get back on the full workout schedule. This means lots of cardio and running. Yeah I know running is the most evil thing on the face of the earth. Especially when you are dealing with so many injuries that make it hard to do.<br /><br />Sakura con is next. I got all the pics back from PCC and all I could think of was Blue oompa loompa. Thats a VERY bad thing. So at lunch time I went and pounded the pavement. I damn near gave myself cardiac arrest. So again. Running while sick is a no no.&nbsp;<br /><br />Starting tomorrow however I will be mostly on the elipticycle, stair master, pilates (Shudders), and of course pounding the pavement. Plus stretching, situps, and the ever basic pushups.<br /><br />What about weights shannon????? lol Weights will come later. The rule of thumb is when you can move your own body weight without dieing then you are good to move on. </p>"

Sadly I was told I couldnt wear the skirt to the airport (I promised greg that if I greet him again at another con that I will wear the skirt to the air port for him)</p><p>It was still a VERY hectic day I was there from 1230pm -11pm. It made for an exhausting day. I did see lou Furrigno in the airport and thanked him for the phone call that he game me earlier that day telling me that he had a friend picking him up and would arrive around 530 pm. <br /></p><p>The koenigs looked very tired. Poor Walter he looked like he was going to fall asleep standing up it was priceless.</p><p>I got to spend an hour with Wil in the airport while we attempted to locate his luggage. Exchanged pleasentries, talked about the insane weather that cali was having, and told him that yes we had guitar hero and rock band in the hospitality suite. lol He says he is still a complete geek and these conventions allow him to be that geek.</p><p>Saturday. Arrive at 945 am. Just in time to get to Mark Waid at the airport. Jeannie from Cosplay Zone finished up the Uni so I went&nbsp; in uni to the aiport. TONS of feedback and questions from a lot of people. I even got to talk to news channel 15. mark was glad he could easily tell who he was supposed to find. And in a sexy skirt to boot!</p><p>Got to usher Greg ayers, Luci christian, and Michelle ruff&nbsp;to their panel. Lots of questions. Standing room. Now after this I was just supposed to be left to my own devices but Michelle ruff asked me to escort her to her signing table. Sooooo Off we go to find the table.......30 minutes, lots of 4 letter words, and 5 water bottles later. I have Michelle at the Table and a HUGE line. I even got to meet her Fiance Eddie and her step sons. They were awesome. Eddie does music for television shows. I thought that was pretty gosh darn neet.</p><p>4pm rolled around and here come Greg and Luci. Luci is the cutest little thing ever. When I saw her at the air port she asked me why we had all this desert and sone random green patches.. lol I told her it was either the golf courses, a football field, cotton field, rose fields, or something else. But yeah they are pretty random.</p><p>The lines for all 3 guests were simply INSANE. I ended up being crowd control from 2pm umtil 5pm. Greg was awesome enough to sign my skirt and my sesshomaru Bag then on sunday he grafitti styled my Coin box plushie. Luci gave me a ""Mature"" video from her collection that she was giving away as bribery to get people to her panels. haa haa. She also Signed sesshomaru. Sadly i didnt have anything bleach but michelle did sign the sesshomaru bag.</p><p>Lots of people asked to take pics of the uni. It had a lot of great feedback. everyone thought it was sharp wtih a hint of sexyness. Awe fuck it. The damn thing was hot. Even hotter with gregs signature. lol. Now I need to get travis sig and I will be set. haa haa haaa.</p><p>Ramen warriors eating contest... dood.. Shannon was tired AND cranky. Bad combo. Add in 300 people to the mix and well I was one unhappy camper. Especially since they wouldnt shutup so I could explain the rules. After all their bitching and whining the show was on the road. 5 rounds were held. only 1 round was won by a guy. W00t!.</p><p>The final round was for a really awesome KISS figuring. Sadly someone Jacked to cups of ramen so I couldnt have 5 people in the last round. So I made the last the rules simple. You get 4 cups of noodles. Whoever eats them all first. gets the KISS figurine. YEAH SARAH!!! Woot!</p><p>MSA Panel.........yeah... um... ouch,,, My laptop couldnt find the projector.... eep. And there were only 12 peoples... I was sad. Cosplayzone DID record it so I will still put it up but dood. I was sad.</p><p>Stephanie and I had a bottle ob Knob Burbon, cherry cola, and Merischino cherries waiting as a special thing for greg. So we had a few drinks. We all had a great time. I learned a lot about greg that I really had no friggen clue about. Infact it was Kami that said. ""You fucking Bitch Im so jealous!"" So I figured if She liked him then he must be good. haa haaa haa. Very down to earth, Very real. No worries. On Sunday Kami got to talk to Greg.<br /><br />made&nbsp; some errands for guests and a special Dr pepper ;) hospitality is number 1<br /><br />Lots of awesome memories. I would also suggest picking up Wil Wheatons new book ""The happiest days of our lives"" its really good. lots of halarious moments from his life in general.<br /><br />The days were long but hey this is what cons are for! no sleep for the weak!&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v319/phxazkyote3507/Phoenix%20Comicon%2008/"">http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v319/phxazkyote3507/Phoenix%20Comicon%2008/</a><br />PICS!<br /></p>&nbsp;"

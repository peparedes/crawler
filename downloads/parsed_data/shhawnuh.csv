HELP ME. i need to decide by friday. i know y'all are thinking, ""WHY THE HELL WOULDNT YOU WANNA GO ASSHOLE"". well 1st off, im not an asshole. and second i dont like eddie. HEHE. &lt;3 <br /><br />yesterday was.. interesting. hah. me michelle nick and teresa went out to fridays.. but michelles sister and 3 friends came too, then we walked to borders. but on the way this car was <strong>kinda of</strong> folowing us and michelle flipped out. me and teresa ran and michelle was strutting her stuff in front of the vehicle.lets just say silly! and mich, if your reading this. i love you girl. &lt;3 ANYWHO. michelle got mad at us, but she got over it. THENTHENTHEN. michelles-sisters-friend drove us home. but first we met some child on a street quarner. then off to someone elses house. idk. i guess thats what michelles-sisters-friend does for fun? heh. yeah the story can last a lifetime. in retrospect, we ate, drove, and went home. ;].<br /><br />today i worked, it seemed forever.

The outside world is exciting, but it's full of a frenzy of activity that may intimidate you or upset your delicate equilibrium. Enjoy busy streets and packed beaches from afar, but limit your time being jostled in big crowds.  
 
hm okay."

Songs with gorgeous lyrics sweep you into your own reveries today. Let your hand act as a dream catcher and channel everything you imagine into prose or verse. The words that result will be impossibly evocative. 

whats a<b> reverie</b>
what <b>evocative</b>
whats a <b>prose</b>

ok im going to go write some verses and proses, peace."

Okay so last night i had almost the best dream ever. i won a contest with my mom and it was to meet rachael ray! so we got to the place where we were supposed to meet her and she wasnt there yet. i met the other winners of the contest (one being fran).so we were waiting in some cave kind of thing and i lookes outside and there were hundreds of people and cameras and there was a helecopter landing pad thing. as i look into the sky i see a helecopter with rachels face on it landing. all the winners of the contest (including me) ran outside to greet the little bitch. she comes out and i was the last one to hug her. but she wouldnt hug me for some reason. then i found out it wasnt even rachael, it was her close friend who was posing to be her so she didnt have to do it. i was sooo fucking pissed but the other winners we'rent. so after that i called up meredith and we went to some secluding island where we met up with the ESM marching band (?), it was so strange. after that me and meredith went back to my house and it was snowing really hard. when me and meredith were walking home there was a tracker folowing us and it looked like rachael ray wanon it.. so me and meredith thought she was going to say sorry and make it up to us. she got off the tracker and <b>it wasnt her</b>! me and meredith started crying, i woke up.

It was really horrible

its hard to let go of something you thought you had for so long. it feels like your over it but you  know your not. theres noone to blame but youself. anywho Today me and meredith hung out all day. we ate alot, and went on webcam alot also. it was alot of fun for a change. i'm tired right now and its only 8.25, but its normal. i'm always tired. blah. in 2 weeks from today im going to lyon for 3 weeks. im really really nervous becuase i already lived with eddie and i dont think he likes me. too bad i dont drink/smoke/and party every second becuase that would be the only way to entertain him. by the end of the 3 weeks he was here we barely talked. but i cant blame that on myslef, becuase he didnt try to hard to be my friend. or even talk to me. when i go to france i will try to be more outgoing unlike him. but i suck at that. Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. bye for now."

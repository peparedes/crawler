"event","I'm in Paris.  This is very exciting!!!

I'm updating, and the Livejournal page is all in French.  This is mildly disorientating.  

Paris is unbelievable, the whole place is like one giant picture postcard.  Trying to take it all in at once is impossible.  I've resorted to looking at little pieces and I'll try and slot them all together later. ::g::

I keep seeing cool things that  I know people would love.  E.G. BHV, a huge department store had masses and masses of little drawer pulls.  Some of them were dice, and they even had some that were 12 sided dice.  Very dork-tastic.  If I ever plan a role playing inspired decor, I know where to go :)

Also, our hotel has an Art Deco jazz bar, with live music.  So, so cool!  There are these incredible parquetry wall panels of famous jazz singers.  We had cocktails and bar snacks there last night.  

I'm off to dinner!  I'll try to write again soon."

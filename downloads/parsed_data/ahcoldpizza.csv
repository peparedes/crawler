Technology is taking over every aspect of our lives and I'm not sure I'm fond of it.




A number of months ago, singer-songwriter Hawksley Workman cut himself off from electronic technology for 6 months on a bet with a friend. No phones, no computers, no television. The friend didn't think he could do it, but he did.






I won't be going that far, though I once went 2 years without watching television... but I am cutting down on technology.

That in mind, I deleted my accounts from several websites now that I've decided aren't worth the time anymore. I'm down to 2 email accounts, msn messenger, facebook and livejournal.


I'll probably be getting rid of one of the email accounts and I'm thinking about getting rid of livejournal. As much as I enjoy reading/identifying with what you guys post, I know I don't post here anymore... and with the blogging function on facebook, livejournal is a bit of a redundancy anyways. Baggage, if you will.



So if any of you only know me through livejournal, and you wish to continue talking to me, my email account of facebook is bsaunders at ualberta dot ca.

My msn messenger account is thechameleon_kid at hotmail dot com



Otherwise, have a good life. 
Maybe even join me on my quest and do some simplifying yourself.

Cheers, and all the best,

Sincerely,

Bryan"

"event","I just moved into my brother's old room. Well... I'm not done. I'm still moving all my stuff and whatnot, but the process has begun. And it's nice to build my room again from scratch based on the way I <i>want</i> it to be.

And in a way, everything in my life is like that right now. 

I went to the bakery the other day for the first time in about a month. I told them that I was ready to come back to work soon. And I sat down and talked with my boss about how much I could do, and how I was feeling, and when I wanted to work and it was good. She's really good people. :) And everybody there swarmed me too, and made me promise to go out with them for coffee or for lunch or whatever... and they made me take home all this food. Heh. :)

And then my school year has been absolutely massacred because of the whole head thing... and the whole med school plan is gonna take longer than it was gonna now. Or maybe I should re-evalute things. Well... I <i>have</i> re-evaluated things. I dunno how I'm gonna recover yet, but I'm thinking about it. But the GPA is in the gutter and I'm the one person at that university who couldn't give a damn about it. But that's fine. I guess it had to come sometime. I can't finish first in my class every year of my life now, can I? Heh.

I truly believe that a little failure here and again is good though. It's humbling, and gets you to remember that you're only human. And that everyone else is only human.

I gained a lot of compassion in my depression and not knowing what was real anymore. In the mental hospital too. Finally being able to understand the hurt of some people. Hurt that I'd never really empathized with or understood before. And then there's seeing people hurting much worse than you are? That'll bring you back down to Earth, alright.

But I have such a deeper understanding of pain now. And that's something not a lot of people can honestly say. At least, I couldn't before.

The thing is, I came down from this high over the past year: Before I was this 18 year-old male. Healthy and fit. Accomplished artist and actor. Hella intelligent, -according to some. Had a roof over my head, a bed to sleep in, and food in my belly. First world country, with a free health care system. Friends with some of the kindest people this side of heaven, and knowing for three years the most fucking amazing girl ever. I was starting a university education, and I had money in my pockets from a job I loved.


And I didn't appreciate it at all. Sure, I thought I did, -I always made sure to give to the homeless and raise money for charity. But I didn't actually appreciate it. You can't when you've never known anything else.


I went from that high of all those things, and realized a new low. Lost my passion for art and theater. Lost my focus, my memory and my intelligence. Watched my university career crash and burn before my eyes. And I didn't care. Watched my body slowly being taken over by something unknown to me. Couldn't eat. Couldn't sleep. Back spasm, hallucinations, panic attacks like heart attacks every minute and the blackouts too. I feel like an old lady. And then there were the emotions that weren't mine. The painful suicidal urges and wildly changing emotions with no basis. And I became a recluse. I quit my job. And I checked into a mental hospital.

I was useless to society. Useless to myself. A drain on the health care system. A nobody. 

I was worthless.

If crashing down to a low like that doesn't make you appreciate what you have, then nothing will.

So... all the whining... is done. All the negative thoughts I've been pouring into this journal and into my life for the past years stop here. The negative people in my life are also done with. And for godsake... stop whining about the weather, people!

Yeah, it snowed last night. Like half a foot. But it was frikken sparkly and wondrous and white. Stop making out like snow is the anti-christ and aborts babies and causes cancer!

And it wasn't even cold out today, either. I was wearing a t-shirt all day. So just appreciate it, people. Appreciate what you got. And truly listen to what I'm saying here, because I don't want you to have to go through what I had to go through just so you can learn that what I'm saying is right. 

So just appreciate it.


Y'all have a good day. I know I'm gonna."

"event","So I just spent 8 days in the psychiatric ward at my neighborhood hospital. Never thought I'd say that.

But yeah... basically it got really bad for me last Thursday afternoon. Hallucinations one after another after another, dizzy, light-headed, feeling like crap, and just constant aggression and very creative self-destructive suicidal thoughts. And they weren't my thoughts. It was like being possessed. Losing control of your body and your mind and emotions and being forced to watch it all.

It was BAD.



So, off to the emergency psych ward at the U of A hospital. Bet you didn't know they had one of those, eh? 

Imagine a bare room with a skeletal hospital bed in the center. A camera imbedded in the wall and directed at the bed. Walls, a calming pink. No doorknob on my side of the door. 

It was like a jail-cell, really. But it was safe, and it was exactly what I needed, if that makes any sense.

Had a mental breakdown right then and there for a good 10 hours probably. Facedown on the bed, violently shaking under a warm blanket. Letting all the crap run its course. It was like the floodgates of my mental dam had just come open.

After that, since there were no full-time beds at the U of A, they transferred me to the Royal Alex friday morning. And for those seven days, I've been picking up the pieces from that breakdown.

I finished piecing it back together a few days ago, and they just discharged me today after waiting and making sure I didn't relapse. 

And I've never felt this good for a long long time. I'm still a little broken, but shattering into pieces like that has made me stronger too. 

That's all I got for now,

Peace..."

"event","So I'm listening to some CDs right now to review for the newspaper.

<b>Brassmunk - Fewturistic...</b> this one is pretty awesome. Especially since I don't typically listen to a lot of hip-hop/rap/r&b. Lots of canadian content and it's not strictly gangsta rap, though there's some of that. But yeah, nice variety, and I could see a lot of this CD being played on the radio and at the clubs because it's good.

<b>Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid - Tongues</b>... I believe these guys are out of London, England. It's just a bunch of video-game/robot techno basically is what I'm getting. Nice ambient music. They mix up the songs, so there's a nice variety again... and they seem to know a fair bit about music theory, so it's not mindless or anything. Good times, though the robot thing gets kinda annoying with its sharpness/abruptness sometimes.

<b>Carla Bruni - No promises.</b> I dunno, it's upstairs right now. But basically, I know Carla for her french and italian singing and songwriting, her acoustic guitar playing and her composing... This CD is entirely in english and all the songs are adaptations of famous poems by people like Yates and Dickenson and whatnot. It's pretty frikken good actually. I'm biased though, because I've had a total crush on Miss Bruni since years ago. 

Other than that... things have been pretty rough for me lately. Sleep hasn't been good. The new medication isn't really doing much... the blackouts suck and I still feel really really weak all the time. If anything, all the medication does is make my mouth dry all the time and is possibly the cause of my humourlessness/apathy lately. Its probably me though, and not the medication behind the apathy thing...

Because of that, I haven't really been able/willing to go to work... Didn't really feel that I could survive a shift without ending up in a coma on the floor, as much as I love that job. And I really love that job. So I quit/took a leave of absence as of today.

I don't know if I'll go back or if they'll want me back... but I need a good while off, for sure.

Went on a date on friday. Which did me some good... 

There was a little emergency back at her house... her babysitters phoned (she has a little 3 year-old girl?) ... and so we went back to her house. The babysitters were this pair of young teenaged girls... like grade 7 or 8 i guess. Anyways, they heard some drunk guy stumbling around their backyard/shed, cause its a bit of a shady area... and so they were obviously scared. So I check out the backyard, the guy is gone. Lock the shed up and all that...

But yeah, it did me some good to leave the house, as I've been avoiding leaving the house lately. Heh.

Other then that, the weekend was spent moping in bed/on the couch and feeling sorry for myself. Stayed in bed a good 30 hours in a row. Yay...

Did my taxes finally, which means that I'll at least have some sort of income in the next month what with me having no job anymore. So I won't die. 

Ehn... I'm gonna go. Check out brassmunk and carla bruni."

Haven't been to school since the end of February.



Ummm pills seems to be working okay for a week and then I had another 3 day episode.

Tried staying on them a bit longer to see if they would kick in. Was having panic attacks every hour.

Medication was taking too long to kick in, so new stronger medication now. Panic attacks are basically gone. Had a mild one a few minutes ago, but it was nothing like the painful heart-attack, can't move, can't breath, crippling ones I was having before. Fuck those sucked.

Still can't sleep. Super sensitive to light now. Back soooo sore. Can't see anything. Always light-headed. Always faint and in a haze. Blacked out a few times. Right body paralysis a few days ago, that went away. Then full body weakness that still hasn't gone away completely. 

Suicidal thoughts are coming and going... nothing like the three day at a time stints that happened a few times earlier this month though. Last night, I thought about what different blood spatter patterns would look like depending on how I shot myself. I don't own a gun. 

Officially had my driving priviliges suspended by a neurologist this morning. He thinks I might have a neurological condition AND a heart condition. On top of those two things, I caught a cold from my baby brother yesterday. I want to fucking die.

He wants to put me on anti-seizure medication on top of what I'm already on to stop the panic attacks and the depression.... he wants to stop the black-outs too but first he's sending me for tests before putting me on any more drugs.

Going for EEG next tuesday. On the waiting list for MRI and ECG, will find out about that soon, hopefully.

I've had 4 hours of sleep in the last 5 days. 3 of those hours were today. It's not that I don't try, it's that I can't.

And ummm yeah. No caffeine, no alcohol, no nicotine. The caffeine thing is killing me the most. Herbal teas just aren't the same. I want BLACK VANILLA TEA DAMNIT!! And coffee. And iced tea. Frick.

Gonna try to sleep again.

Elaborate?

Well, I was making some oatmeal cookies today. And I bend over to grab the bowl of dough, and all of a sudden I smell/taste cigarettes. 

1.) There are no cigarettes.
2.) I haven't smoked a cigarette, ever.
3.) Cigars, and cigarillos, which I did smoke, I haven't smoked in well over three months.
4.) It's indoors, in a bakery.
5.) There wasn't anyone around me for me to be smelling cigarettes off of.

So, yeah, weird... But I shake it off. Maybe it was just a fluke.

No...

I go up to the loading dock... I'm bending down again and all of a sudden I smell cinnamon, and nutmeg, and cloves. So basically, pie spices.

1.) I didn't make any pies today.
2.) Nobody made any pies today.
3.) There sure as hell weren't any pies on the abandoned loading dock at 9:30 at night.

Then, had the best interview of my journalistic career Sunday evening. He was the most eloquent speaker, and his thoughts were clear, and he didn't use any filler words, and he talked at a reasonable pace... Barry Westerlund, you make my life.

I have an interview with Serena Ryder on Thursday.



Missed most of my math/stat/physics lectures on monday. Needed sleep. So worth it.

Needed sleep because I spent all night writing an article... worrying about this girl... and planning an event for the pre-medical students association on Valentine's day.

Went to work monday night, which I thoroughly enjoyed.



So, got up at 11 today (tuesday). Yum. Mmm sleep. Got to school at 12:40... 10 minutes late for my hour and a half Bio 107 lecture. Didn't miss anything.

Talked about something, that for the first time in these last 6 months, out of all my classes... this is the first time we've talked about SOMETHING relating directly to neuroscience. ie. Membrane potentials.

So yay.

Had a nice talk with May (who I haven't talked to for a long time) for a good hour. She let me vent some stuff and then we both talked about baking and chocolate stuff... which is really nice to talk to someone who shares that passion and knows what you're talking about.

Did my 50 question, 7 or 8 page STAT assignment for the next three hours. Got it all done, and super confident that I got it all right.

Didn't want to do it, and normally WOULDN'T want to do it because it's 3 hours of work for 2.5% of my final mark (See the 25% missing off of my PHYS 124 mark for an example of what not doing 10 2.5% assignments will do to your mark). 

But I somehow found the motivation. Which I've been lacking for months now.

So yay. Good sign?

I'm noticing that I can always get stuff done if I sit in this one part of HUB: it's upstairs (and I thrive off being high up in a tree or on rooftops or in my loft bed) 

And really close to the glass ceiling, so lots of natural light and none of that seasonal affected depression bullshit happening...

And it's got big tables, and it's private enough...

So I'm gonna keep on trying to work there.

Went to my English class. We got into the whole feminism debate, and, oh boy, was that a can of worms. I noticed that the older people were the more they thought feminism was a good idea, whereas most the men AND women my age thought it was kinda hypocritical in most senses. 

But unlike last class (debate of that class had to do with Claire Dane's comments on the Philipines when she was filming Brokedown Palace there), the debate didn't go completely out of control, and we all just exchanged ideas and responded to each other's comments in a nice polite fashion. 

Talked about other stuff... talked to Claire a bit... did a Soduko puzzle and read the comics... english class now over....



Walked Claire to her truck. She'd parked in this weird place today, so we basically almost got lost trying to find her parking spot again. But that was cool, because I got to talk to her for longer... 

and plus, it was actually good that I was walking with her that night, because it was down all these dark alleys and abandoned stairwells and stuff.

Talked in her truck for a bit. Asked her out. She said sure. Talked some more. Got out of the truck. Watched her drive away. Swung/danced around some streetlights. Went home.

Still awake. Eeeee."

One more lab exam on monday evening (so pissed that they made it outside of actual lab time, and in the evening nonetheless.) So I miss work that day, which I'm pretty sad about... literally. But yeah, that's my organic chemistry lab, and then it's over really. Unless I show up to any of my lectures or things, I don't have to go back to the university until finals.

Wrote my general chemistry lab exam today. It was weird and asked really really specific details about experiments I did four months ago. Like what colour things turned when you reacted them with other stuff. Bullllllllshit.

But everybody else in that lab (we're a really chummy lab section) felt the same way as I did about that, so it was cool.

Paid my fees for breaking stuff in labs. 11$. Damn vacuum flask. I asked them what was the most somebody had to pay so far. 70$. That would suuuuck.

Went CD shopping, the cd listening station at the HMV was broken though, so since I couldn't listen to certain CDs before hand, I only ended up buying about 4. Sam Roberts, new Jamiroquai, Live (for my brother), annnnnd Thievery Corporation.

Still need to buy: 

K'naan - dusty foot philosopher
Regina Spektor - Songs  (which HMV doesn't even have in their catalogue apparently)
Family Force 5 - whatever their CD is called. I think they only have one
Starsailor - the new one
Scissor Sisters - the new one
Feist - the CD with ""Secret Heart"" on it
The Kooks - Naive

ALSO: buy rufus wainwright for mommy

and some old Arab Strap CDs, because I only have the new one."

"event","Just checked the medical admission website for my university.

They changed certain requirements and weightings for admission since I was last there.

In a way that makes me very happy. MUAHAHAHA.

Booyah.

Things are looking a bit better in terms of that now.

Only 3 more years!!! Haha. EEEeeee.



Oh... BY THE WAY... the U of A is full of over-achievers. Frick, apparently our average undergraduate admission grade was like 89% or something. And like 99% of people had an entrance average of over 75%.

Like... what the DEUCE?! 

SINCE WHEN?!?!? No wonder I've felt stupider lately. Bastards."

"event","It's been a rough week, on top of a rough two months. 

So like... a really rough week. I'll admit it, I couldn't take it on at least two occassions this week, and I had to call in sick to work and to school. 

It's almost over.




I'm getting really excited for some psychology/pharmachology/physiology courses I get to take next year. Ifffff I don't get kicked out of Uni for being a failure that is.

But yeah... looking forward to second year uni already. AKA I need something to convince me that finishing first year is worth it.



Lab exams all next week. Wish me luck. And then finals. Wish me lots of luck.

Or if you don't believe in wishing me luck, if you could just wish that the rest of my class of 500 does poorly so that I'm higher up on the curve, that would be awesome as well. People are really overestimating me lately. Flattering, but bad. Very bad.





After exams, I can volunteer for the Youth Emergency Shelter like I always do. Looking forward to that. Stop by and visit me, have some hot chocolate and I'll wrap your presents for you, and you can make donations to the Shelter... and it'll all be awesome.

Other than that, I'm not looking forward to Christmas because I'm gonna be short of time and money, but hey, what can you do?




I interview City Vox tomorrow morning. And then an article on celebrity sex tapes and an article on abortion later on. Make sure you read them, mmkay guys?


Annnnd lots of stuff is being planned. I have a ski trip with the pre-medical students association planned for reading week. And I might be working in a lab studying brain disorders caused by neurotransmitter imbalances this summer. 

On top of taking chem 102 in the spring/summer session because it doesn't fit anywhere else in my schedule... gah.

And also, I might be taking some pastry, chocolate, and desert courses this summer. I'm hoping that Cookies by George will pay for them. We shall see. 

They're about 250$ dollar courses, and they're each a week long, and there's 6 of them. So 1500$ and 6 weeks. Or even if they pay for a bit of it that'd be great, because I'm sure I can get some sort of tax exemption for it too, since it's a business/education expense.

I really want to take the courses, because I think it would be fun. It would be some nice certification to have. Plus, it'd make me better at my job and I would learn all sorts of new recipes for my personal use as well. 

I'll start to get a better idea of what's happening and what's not happening this spring/summer in about february."

"event","Ummm the concert was wicked. I got there a bit early, and I asked if I could go in, and then they asked if I was with the band... soooooo... what else can you say to that really? So went in, and mingled for a bit.

Haha. And then Reel Big Fish's agent asked me if I would be interested in covering the Taste of Chaos tour in mid-February. Apparently the Used are headlining it, and 30 seconds to mars, and senses fail will be tagging along as well... I said I'd let him know in January.

So had a whole shitload of espresso downstairs, and then went up and had about 5 shots of jack's. Got a wicked RBF hoodie. And then waited for the show to start.

The pit got so ridiculous that the barricade got broken down. TWICE.

That was the moshing pit, and then the skanking pit was basically all around the moshing pit... I started in the mosh pit (for like the opening bands) but then I dissapeared into the skanking pits as the night drew on. Some people were jsut being retarded and actually hitting little girls and stuff and like me and this other guy had to physically restrain this other guy because he was just being absolutely retarded.

The first three bands were pretty sweet: Streetlight Manifesto, Westbound Train and Suburban Legends. Especially Streetlight Manifesto and Suburban Legends. The one was insanely musically talented and the other put on such an obviously choreographed show, but a good one that... yeah... wow.

Sonia and Animal and Peaches were there. They were crowd surfing at one point. Everybody was crowd surfing at one point. This one girl got up onto the speakers to jump down unto the crowd... and well the speakers were about 15 feet up... and behind the barricade so the crowd was a far bit away. She was fairly intoxicated. So Reel Big eventually coaxed her down,

""Please pretty lady! Don't do it! Life is still worth living!""

So she got down, safe and sound, and they then played ""Everything Sucks"". Ahhhh the irony.

So they played their set. They actually played Suburban Rhythm about 6 times, but in a different style each time? So it was like... ska, punk, reggae, rock ballad, death metal and an Axle Rose rendition of it, I think it was. Hillarious.

Did their whole set, and then left. So I started screaming ""Sell out"", because they had left without playing it. And then some other people joined me, and then some other people starting yelling reel big fish... so it turned into ""SELL OUT!"" 

""REEL. BIG. FISH.""

""SELL OUT!""

""REEL. BIG. FISH.""

for about 3 minutes. They came back out, played for about another 30 minutes. And the last song they played? Oh, that's right... you guessed it... ""sell out"".

MUAHAHA.

And then, split a cab home with some people I met at the concert. Heh."

Staying up late
Cause I'm a fucking fool
And I'm avoiding school

And all of the school-work.
I must be beserk.
I'm just so sick of it
And all of the shit

Pre-labs, post-labs and lab reports
Midterms and essays, eat my shorts
If it weren't for the pretty girls, I wouldn't even go
I'd rather go to work, and make lots of dough

I'd rather be writing articles for the Gateway full-time
I'm sick of uni and speaking about it in rhyme
Two more midterms and four more labs I hate
And then, finally, the cherished fall break.

Gawwwwd fall break is jsut one week too late... i need a break now!!! GAHGAHGAHAGAHAGAH

Yeah, interview went cool. I just googled my last interview and the guy liked it so much, he put it up on his page, with only about 6 other articles he's ever put up in the last 6 years. So that's cool.

*groan* Kay... I'll do the damn lab report now. Man, that was cool... I wrote that whole rhyming spiel in like 30 seconds.... I must be really pissed for it to come out so naturally like that."

"event","Just got a call from Reel Big Fish. Good times. The interview was supposed to be today, but their publicist didn't get back to me quickly enough, so they went out of their way to phone me themselves to let me know and the interview is happening tomorrow evening... and I think it's gonna be with all of them. =O

It's gonna suck writing that article mere hours before the deadline... but yeah... what nice guys. :)


Do you guys have any questions you want me to ask them, or any ideas for angles? I don't have a particularily creative angle at the moment. *sigh*



Putting off doing my 4 lab reports and my essay right now. I NEED TO LEARN organic and inorganic CHEM FOR MY MIDTERMS. FUCK BRYAN!!! You shithead.

Oh.... happy birthday danielle.



Aleda, what day/time is your flight out? I just found out that one of my other friends is leaving for the UK right away, it'd be cool if you guys were on the same flight.



And yeah, I made cookies today. My job is awesome. And I'm also awesome at my job. But that's just the way I roll. I love how they always end up buying me lunch! GAWD! Soooo yummy. And sooo nice! I love being a clean freak at work too and being obsessed with precision and getting the job done. That's fun. Good to get it all out of my system somewhere, otherwise it might come out elsewhere.

Like I might actually do my homework right away, and with precision too... and not just a half-assed job on the bus ride to school, minutes before my class.

I get to sit in the cookie factory and make Christmas decorations for the stores tomorrow morning. Arts and Crafts baby. And I'm getting paid for it. And then I get to bake some muffins and some cinnamon buns.


New goal: To one day interview Hawksley Workman. And probably some other cool cats.

New goal: To beat the world record of most pushups done in a year (over 1.5 million --> over 4000 a day --> about two hours of pushups a day. It's do-able.)



Bryan's treat to himself after this upcoming week of midterms, doctor appointments, labs, work and hell: 
-Going to the RBF show. Bonus points if a press pass is set up and I get in for free.
-Going to Cargo and James open mic and relaxxxxing.


OH! I got my braces out. It's cool and awesome and stuff. I'm gonna go suffer through my homework now. Maybe... probably rat around the internet for another hour..."

Good times. They've already won anyways.


The second round of midterms is next week apparently. My friends just reminded me today... aka mentioned that they were next week... to which I replied... ""Oh. You sure? ""

School's not going as badly as I thought. I calculated some of my grades today and I got a 100% (English), and a 94% (Chem 101) and the other 3 are all low 80s which makes me sad, because that's basically the lowest mark I've ever gotten. Hopefully those hold, or go up even. I need a 3.3 on 4.0 (83%ish) average to stay in the honours neuroscience program.

Speaking of which, neuroscience is having a party at Earl's and apparently I won free supper. buahahahah. I love winning stuff. Probably because it goes against the whoel concept of having to work hard to get something.

Haha. Work is sweet. Keeping fit scooping cookie dough. Challenge me to an arm wrestle... I dare you. 

My brother might work a few shifts for them over Chirstmas... so that will be cool if I get to work with my brother. We'd make a sweet team, let's face it. I want to help him find a spa job soon though, because he's got this massage training, and degree and license but he doesn't have a job yet. There's a bunch of clinic jobs but he wants to work in a spa setting, not a clinic.

Interview with Reel Big Fish this weekend. Hoo-rah. They have a show here next friday. I want to go.

Tons of homework for monday (lab report, essay, pre-lab, another report), and lots of organic and inorganic chem to learn for the midterms next week. Working all weekend at the cookie factory, hopefully that doesn't tire me out too much. Huge paycheck tomorrow. Which is awesome. And umm a sewing party and a learn chemistry party at Ashanti's house on Sunday.

It's gonna be an exhausting weekend. Wish me luck.

Fall break is only 10 more days away. CAN ALMOST REST."

"event","So I'm putting off writing a cd review at the moment. it's not that it's bad... it's actually that i enjoy the cd very much. which means i have a problem. because when a cd is bad you can go on and on about how bad it is...  (eg. ""it was like my ears were bleeding, it was like if elton john and paris hilton had a duet cd out and then a cover of one of the songs was redone by someone even less talented than paris. it's sounded like a cross between william hung and elmer fudd.""

but 250 words about how awesome a cd is? ...tough.

and sometime soon, i have an interview with reel big fish, which is sweet, because those guys are amazing. plus they have a concert coming up, which i am excited for.


and umm yeah... HUGE paycheck from work coming up. i've been picking up a few extra shifts here and there, so i ended up averaging about 26 hours a week. MONEY! YAY!

AAAAND my scholarship check came in the mail the other day. finally. AWESOME. AND I got a tax receipt for some donation i made a long time ago that i forgot about. yay for 200$ tax receipts. heyo!


so there's that... schools looking better now that midterms are over, my chem 101 class is actually looking pretty good in terms of the grade i'm gonna walk out with. and my engl 111 class looks like a guaranteed 4.0 as well. other classes? i dunno... physics, i was over the average, but not by much, same with chem 161 and bio....

OMG!!!! HAHAHAHA i still haven't picked up my bio midterm!!! geeez... i've ""missed"" two classes in a row... no... three. hahahhaha. i wonder if he'll even still put it out for me to pick up next lecture.

still loving my job... it was so nice today, i went in this evening jsut to do some cleaning for them because we're scooping lots and lots of dough onto cookei sheets tomorrow. so i washed like 200 cookie sheets and 50-ish muffin tins by hand... music blasting in the background... singing and working all by myself.... that's the way to go... oh man. love that place.


other big news? hot air balloon ride finally rebooked (thanks steph!), my braces are coming off real soon, annnnnd i'm part of a group of people organizing a ""lose-a-limb"" day at the university.

basically, a few people and i are going to give up the use of one of our limbs on nov 16th, to raise money for the stollery childrens hospital.

here's the deal. if i get 0-39.99$ raised, i'll give up my left arm, 
40-79.99$ i'll give up one of my legs, 
80-119.99 and i'll give up my right arm, 
120-500$ i'll give up <b>both</b> my legs, (WHEELCHAIR!!!)
and 500$+ I will be quadraplegic for a day."

Everyone in my house and in my classes is sick but me, even though I'm probably the one who gets the least sleep and goes outside with wet hair.

I just wrote a 9 page report for bio, I have an essay to write for english, an oral presentation for english, and a lack of motivation.


I want my scholarship money NOW. I've been broke for 2 months. Commmme soooooon.


My interview with Magnolia Electric Co went sweet, my editor wants me to take more big assignments like that.

On MY hours... aka I tell them when I can come in about a week ahead and they book me. 

And then I'll just making cookie dough and chopping chocolate and scooping dough and lots of fun lifting of like 50kg bags of sugar and coconut and stuff. 

I'm gonna start shutting up about how much I love my job gradually, but just because I don't mention it in entries months from now, does not mean I do not still enjoy it.


<b>Wrote my first midterm. </b>

No stress... unlike the other people who were CRYING during the midterm. DUDE. WTF? Why are you crying? It's a frikken test, its not like your mom just died or your girlfriend jsut broke up with you. Kay, it's harsh and yeah pressure and all but there was like SIX people crying! That's retarded. Just relax buddy... or study next time even... Jeez.

Anywho. I'm guessing a 93 or higher. 4 more to go. I have three more over two days sometime soon. And then another one nice and far off in the future.

<b>My hot air balloon ride got pushed back. </b> It was too cloudy, and the cloud ceiling was too low and they were worried about getting hit by planes. 

Though, I think going through clouds would have been fun, though chilly. Anyways, so I have to rebook that sometime. 

In the end, it was for the better, because when I got the call from them  that it was cancelled I went back to bed, and then I just didn't go to my bio class that day and it ended up being a really nice day.

Cause of thanksgiving, I don't have my dreaded physics lab this week (which I'm beginning to like a bit even...). That's a bonus. 

Plus on monday, I have my first big article that's not a CD or film review. <b>I have an interview with Magnolia Electric Co...</b> If you've never heard of them, they're from the States and they're kinda like Wilco or Neil Young. Somewhere in between those two. 

They're like a darker more somber Wilco or an adolescent Neil Young. 

Make sure you're in the mood for something like that though, cause the first time I heard them I was uber happy and cheery and hyper and it clashed and i didnt like it. But later i listened to them again in a more relaxed mood and i really liked them.

Annnnd I was supposed to film a movie this weekend with the filmaking society, but the script got changed and the part I would have played is now gone. In the words of the producer ""Yeah, as funny as it would have been to have an older boy fighting with his teddy bear we though it would be too distracting.""

:(

Maybe next time. Take care of yourselves guys!"

I made enough cookie dough today to fill a truck. Mmmmhmmmm. Did you know you can buy m & m's in 10 kg cases? Anyways, so if you go to cookie's by george in the next week or so and buy a milk chocolate or m & m cookie, I probably made the dough for those.

(And I only goofed on one batch of dough ALL day, and not badly either, it just needed a bit more stirring.)

Yeah that's all I got.... I like that job. Like... with a passion. All their ingredients they use are ridiculously quality and high caliber. YUMS.




And I'm still being all motivated when it comes to school and stuff and doing all my homework and shit. So, yeah? Good? Plus my assessments of all my classes are slowly turning out to be more and more right. 

(Assume half the people in your class know nothing on the subject and have been confused all semester... half of the people who do understand don't do any of their coursework or labs... this automatically places you in the top quarter of your class and maybe higher if you're lucky, as long as you keep on doing your homework.)



Oh and be jealous cause I'm writing articles for the arts and entertainment section of the university newspaper, meaning I've seen movies that haven't come out yet, I have interviews lined up with all sorts of bands, and thousands of people are forced to read my drivel. MUAHAHAHA!! Unlike you guys... This journal is for nobody but myself lately, I swear. Still loving my english class, btw... I don't think I ever realized how much I love writing. Plus everyone in my english class is sweet and it's basically a party every tuesday.

And I had my first general chem lab on friday, and made lots of friends. Its good times. 

And I've even managed to squeeze some acting into my schedule. 1.) As part of the filmakers club 
2.) As a patient actor for medical students. I get to pretend to be sick or hallucinating or like I jsut got shot and stuff and they have to figure out what I got based on my symptoms and stuff. Good times.


Yeah... I'm liking my life right now. I go for a hot air balloon ride this wednesday, so if you see a balloon in the morning, that would be me.

annnnd time for some funnies. All of these are true and actually happened. Ganked from a particularily funny edition of the Bonehead Awards:




<b>Miss Great Britain Has A Historyrectumy</b>

Today we bestow a ""Stupidest Utterance In The World,"" Bonehead Award 
to the reigning Miss Britain, Danielle Lloyd.

The Los Angeles times reports that when Miss Lloyd was asked who 
Winston Churchill was, she replied, ""Wasn't he the first black 
president of America? There's a statue of him near me that's black.""

Paris Hilton was unavailable for comment.



<b>Oooh Eeee Oooh Ow Ow.  And then the witch doctor He told me what to 
do...</b>


Some years ago the first Bonehead award bestowed upon an animal was to 
a dog for trying to have sex with a hedgehog with expected painful 
results, the poor dog.

Today's award goes to Zoran Nikolovic, a Serbian man who, having gone 
to a witchdoctor complaining of premature e*jaculation, followed the 
witchdoctor's advice and tried having s*ex with a hedgehog.

Always, always! Get a second opinion!

He was rushed to the hospital with severe lacerations you know where. 
Where's premature e*jaculation when you really need it?

The hedgehog was unhurt and Moron Nikolovic will fully recover.

""This demonstrates the dangers in consulting unlicensed witchdoctors,"" 
said a spokesman from the International Association of Witchdoctors.



<b>It's A Scapegoat, Of Course</b>


A ""Stupidest Excuse In The World,"" Bonehead Award is bestowed to A 
Nigerian man, arrested for murdering his brother, who is claiming that 
he did not kill his brother. That he killed a goat which through an 
evil magic turned into his dead brother.

He says if you believe his story than he'd like you to help him 
transfer $48 million dollars out of the country.




<b>Woman Receives A Special Package From Her Uncle Sammy</b>


In rejecting a California woman's trademark application for the phrase 
""You cum like a girl,"" the US Patent and Trademark Office, to prove 
that the word ""cum"" was ""directly associated with degrading sexual 
acts"" and therefore ""scandalous"", and not eligible for registration, 
returned the rejected application to Cathy Carlson along with 10 MBs 
of hard core pornographic images downloaded from the Internet as well 
as output from Google searches meant to prove their point.

You can't make this stuff up.

"event","I just thought i'd throw this out there: september 19th is official talk like a pirate day.

don't you guys be forgetting now. (didja remember jessie? huh? didjadidjadidja?)

I doubt even jessie gets that reference. heh. :)


Also ummm I'm declaring september 20th as official ""GIVE A HUG."" I don't believe it exists yet... if it does it's got two days it happens on now... and theres nothing wrong with that.

But the goal is to propagate love through the universe, to make people's day, and to maybe make some new friends.

Don't be afraid to make the hugging co-ed! Or hugging people that you don't know strangers! (this just makes the hugging funner!!)



Anyways, this isn't a totally random idea on my part... look, I'm sure you guys all heard what happened in montreal. The shooting at the university... And it's happening a hell of a lot these days. And a lot of shit like that is happening in this world. 

Wouldn't it be nice if the world had a bit more love in it? So here's the scoop... I'm sure you guys have all heard of the 6 degrees of seperation theory. That is... some guy in mongolia and myself... we know each other through six people max. Lets say I have a chinese friend, who has a chinese cousin in china, who has a classmate, who has a mongolian mother, and this man in mongolia is her brother.

Six degrees. The theory is that we're connected to everyone in the world that way. So here's the deal... you guys pass this along... and your friends pass it along... and their friends pass it along, and pretty soon, everybody's hugging strangers on the 20th!!

If you want to help me spread the love, there's a little blurb you can post in your journals behind the text.

<lj-cut text=""BEHIND THE CUT"">
<b>MARK YOUR CALENDERS!! September 20th is the official ""GIVE A HUG"" day. Hug a stranger! Hug your mailman! Or hug anyone for that matter.</b>

See someone who looks sad? MAKE THEIR DAY! Haven't hugged your friends in a while? REMIND THEM THAT THEY MEAN THE WORLD TO YOU! See a cute girl on the bus? INTRODUCE YOURSELF WITH A HUG!! (ask first maybe... ""Excuse me, I dunno if you know this or not but it's official hug a stranger day today, and you're incredibly cute... can I hug you?"")

How many hugs can you give in one day? How big of a group hug can you get going? FIND OUT! Set the record to beat for next year.

Or world is getting more and more hostile every day... sad, dejected people are lashing out and shooting people... 

Cultural groups are fighting for no other reason but that they historically hate each other...

The world is being overcome with hate, and on September 20th, you have a chance to change that. Hug a stranger, tell them about the day and maybe they'll hug a stranger too! Help propogate love through the universe!!!

And don't be afraid to continue this on other days. If you missed it, there's nothing stopping you from doing it today or tomorrow! Share the happiness of a hug everyday!

PASS THIS MESSAGE ALONG, SPREAD THE WORD, AND MAKE GIVE A HUG DAY A SUCCESS!!!

They moved my time to 2 o'clock to anyone that was planning on coming to watch... hopefully this gives you enough notice, but I doubt it.



University's alright, the classes are really easy, and the profs were really stressing reading your lecture notes the day before the class, but so far there really hasn't been any need (ie. I didn't and I understood everything they were saying.)

I hate my physics lab, but that's to be expected. Everything else seems enjoyable so far.



Oh, and I broke my bike again this year (ie. Euan broke my bike... I think... but whatevs.. not really a big deal) 

And once again (just like last year around this time) somebody stole it while it was broken. That's twice they've saved me the trouble of disposing of it/getting it fixed.


Moneywise... I'm screwed right now. I need a job ASAP. My scholarships don't come through until just before the tuition dealine or a month after, so I'm paying for uni out of my own pocket right now. 5100$... Plus about 700$ worth of books. And I got those babies at a discount too. The other 200$ are paying my phonebill, and my groceries for the next month.

So the 6000$-ish dollars I had saved up in my account are fooosh gone until the end of september/the end of october. And then I get about 5000$-ish of it back. And then I'm spending a good chunk of that, seeing my family in mexico this winter. Hopefully that happens.

Jobwise though, I have a job at the Powerplant (its a restaurant inside a former powerplant, not a nuclear type scary place)... I think. Thing is... they're so busy right now that they havent had the time to interview new employees and train and stuff. If nothing else, they asked me to paint the inside of the cafe there.

So in the meantime, I went job hunting at the hospital, and hopefully I'll hear back from them soon. The job posting for that closes on the 13th and the 15th. Pays better than the powerplant too, and i can get more hours. Finger crossed please people. I NEEEEEEED a job.





Anyways, so check out what I'm doing today:

1.) Go to Town Center, and pick up the Gorilla suit (hopefully, euan doesn't forget it)
2.) Go to J H P and pick up an envelope that is hopefully full of money.
3.) Go to the University, attend some classes.
4.) Skip my help session for chem 101, and head downtown on the lrt instead.
5.) Rappel down the side of a building.
6.) Take the lrt back to the university, attend a class
7.) Take the lrt back downtown, attend a reception (mmm freeeee food)
8.) LRT it back to the university, revel in my 3 hour evening english class. (No joke here, I truly look forward to it)
9.) Go the fuck home and sleeeeeeeeeep until noon the next morning as I don't have classes tilll afternoon. (And maybe snack a bit before I sleep.)


p.s. Does anyone want to join a spanish club with me? You don't have to be spanish, you jsut hang out with spanish people, and people who speak spanish, and people who want to speak spanish, and go to latino dances, and celebrate a lot of spanish holidays anddddd ummmm theres lots of tequila parties too."

mmm this day's turning out bad.

I'm gonna go roll over and die now.

No wait... possibly one of my last attempts. Umm I'm stepping off the ledge of a 29 story building sometime next week. And I'm gonna basically try not to kill myself in the process. Though that attitude may change. Feh.

Nah... september 12th, at 3 in the afternoon, i'm rapelling off this hotel to raise money for the easter seals, which is a charity that provides last resort help for families with handicapped children. Families that are having a hard time emotionally, or financially because of this. The Easter Seals provide them with like wheelchair lifts, and communication devices, and wheelchairs and finds them other families dealing with the same thing to talk to....

And they've been around for like two decades, so they're very reputable. So if you'd like to throw in some money that'd be great. I mean if you don't know what to do with all that money you have lying around in your money swimming pool. Or put this in your journal or something to spread the word... As I'm having a really hard time raising any kind of money. It's all tax deductible and all that.... so yeah, here's the link.

On the bright side, this frees up my evenings and weekends to find some sponsors for the rapelling thing. And I REALLY gotta find a bunch of them. I'm nowhere near the goal, and it's just looking pretty pathetic at this point. I won't be allowed to do it if I don't reach the goal, and I REALLY want to do this cause it's gonna be awesome.

I figure I'm gonna stop by the old school on Wednesday morning and pass the hat and hopefully maybe get a few hundred dollars that way. So tell everybody to bring money mmkay guys? =D 

I talked to a bunch of businesses and none of them wanted to toss anything in so far.

There's some links if you guys find any money you don't know what to do with.

Yeah, I'm gonna be plugging that up until the 12th basically.



So, University Orientation is on Labour Day monday and tuesday? Dude, that monday was supposed to be a holiday... wtf? Then the first day is wednesday, but luckily I only have one class on wednesdays! HAHAHAHA. It'll be good for easing me back into it.

I've been drawing super lots, and writing lots of stuff and sketching a lot of graffiti...

I'm not doing letters so much anymore... Lots of pictures and stuff now that I have my drawing ability back. I'm doing a lot more street art now. I made a really sweet stencil the other day... I'm gonna blow it up lifesized and put it somewhere as soon as I can (AKA before my town freezes over into it's 8 month winter.) It's basically the best thing I've ever made. I'm making a messenger bag out of an old army coat... it was just one shade of green, and had a whole bunch of pockets all over it. So the outside of the bag is just gonna have insane amounts of pockets everywhere in random places. And then I have some old records to transform into other objects, a women's blazer with a sweet polkadot pattern, and I dunno what else. But I'm catching up on my work and that's the important bit."

"event","So I applied for two jobs. One at the call center, the other at Moxie's... this restaurant.

I got them both. Call center paid 11.15 and hour to start, plus health and dental benefits and stuff like that.

Moxie's pays like 14$ an hour, plus tips, and that's just for the easy kitchen job of washing dishes.

So I'm super happy about that. So, I'm taking the one at Moxie's cause I don't need the benefits right now, I'm still covered under my parents plan for a bit longer... like a year or so. Plus the call center job seemed absolutely too slow and boring for me. I would have gone mad within days.

The thing I'm doing right now at the fringe, is exhausting, but good cause it's getting me off my fat ass and out there. Making money, seeing the fringe at the same time. If all goes well, I should be all set for paying for and attending University and all that by the end of this summer.

And I've got rapelling training this saturday afternoon. What for you ask? For rapelling down the outside of a 29 story hotel folks!!! And why am I rappeling down a 29 story hotel, on september 12 in the heat and insanity of the afternoon? To raise money for the Easter Seals folks!!! They provide support and provide expensive equipement to families with mentally or physically handicapped children who just can't do it on their own anymore. And I gotta raise 1,500$ for them very very soon now! So help me out, and you can make an online donation here, or talk to me in person. All tax deductible people. Completely secure, as you can see by the https hyperlink and the fact that it is hoster on a secure server.

Alright, so here's the scoop:

On September 12th, 2006 at 3 in the afternoon (possibly the hottest time of day in my city)...

At the Sutton Place Hotel (there's a picture of it if you click the link)...

I will be descending 29 stories. From the top of the hotel, to the very bottom...

However! I will not be using the elevator... 

Nor will I be using the stairs. 

In fact, I won't even be on the inside of the building (!!!)




<center>I will be rappelling down the OUTSIDE of this building... 

What does this mean you ask? It means I jump down the bulding, a few feet at a time, with the help of but one little rope. I will face the strong winds found at such heights. I will also be doing this under the afternoon sun. </center>




The help I require from you fine people is not of the psychiatric sort, though I'm sure many of you might think it is.


Here's the scoop. The reason I'm doing this insane act is to raise money for the Easter Seals Foundation. It's a very reputable foudation that has been around for as long as I've been alive. This foundation provides last resort help for families. 

They help pay for expensive medical equipment that a mentally handicapped child needs, that his or her family may not be able to pay for. Things like wheelchairs, or wheelchair lifts for a family van. 

Or any sort of family in any sort of extreme medically related financial strain.

They helped one of my former teachers when his baby girl was diagnosed with down's syndrome.

So please, if you can, donate. If you can't, and that's totally understandable, then please spread the word, and post this link in your journals. My goal is to raise $2,000 dollars. It's a big goal, but if you guys help me spread the word I think I can do it.

"event","So... I've been away at the folk fest. Which, if you don't know is this huge outdoor music festival... 8 stages and like 50 000 people. Everybody lines up at the doors really early so they can stake a area close to the stage and lay their tarp down there. 

But since I've gone alone everyday, I've managed to come like 2 hours after the gates open and get a spot real close by the stage just by looking for a little space in between tarps and putting my chair there. Which is awesome. And I met all sorts of new people by doing that.

It's been rainy and cold everyday so far, but that kinda just adds to the fun. On Thursday, I saw Bedouin Soundclash, and all the ska kids were there for that day so there was lots of fun dancing with them in the pitttt. K'Naan was there on thursday too, and I'd never heard them before and they were effing amazing and funny and poetic and lyrical and just good stuff. More fun dancing in the pit there. Saw a bunch of people I knew, and then kinda met this group of like 6 girls who are just good times.

Went to the beer gardens, and I got hit on by these two like 30 year olds for about half an hour until their husbands saved me. It was a terrifying but hillarious experience. Bumped into a couple of people I knew a bit later, and one of them had one of those fake ""James Dean"" driver's licenses, so I went back to the beer gardens and tried to get in with that. And it totally almost worked, but then the security guy being the security guy checking this ID called me on it and I had to show him my real ID to get in.







Today, I saw K'Naan again, and they were bananas once again. Saw some awesome blues groups all collaborating with each other, some jazz and like crazy celtic music. BUMPED INTO KATE FINALLY! Yeah... ummm... that could have gone better, kinda awkward, but what can you do? Maybe next time. Kinda really bummed about my awkwardness and all that... ummm... yeah... just a crush justacrush whatever..... gah fuck.... NEW SUBJECT!

Saw those girls (Bevin... Talia... oh god what were the names of the other ones? Kegan... ummm I dunno... whatever, those three were the really cute and gorgeous ones anyways) again in the dance pit like allll night, got my own little audience too while the Neville Brother's were playing all these awesome beats and I was dancing to it. I literally had like 3 spontaneous dance-offs with these girls and they were effing insane. Plus this guy handed me like 4 glowsticks, so yeah I got free glowsticks and I LOVVVVVVVE dancing with glowsticks. I danced hardcore for like 2 hours straight. My body still burns with joy. mmmmhmmm. 

I managed to get some free food from one of the vendors... bison stew... and bannock... hells yes... so filling. And I got some comp tickets for tomorrow from this guy... which is awesome, cause I totally didn't have tickets for saturday and I totally wanted them.

And then ummmm HAWKSLEY FUCKING WORKMAN CLOSED THE MAIN STAGE TONIGHT!!!!! Oh my god he was soooooooooooo good. And he was totally just improvising at some points and it was just amazing. And he kept on making jokes in his songs or just randomly between songs. He slipped a tragically hip song into the middle of one of his own songs. Yeah, so he umm totally met and exceeded my expectations and he better be playing again at one of the other stages tomorrow.  Oh, I wolf howled at him a couple of times from the pit, and then later, he got EVERYONE in the audience to howl with him at the moon. Which is just sweeeeet. I'm not gay, but I was (am) totally attracted to that man. He's just soooo talented and amazing, and charming and hillarious and totally just echoes my feelings with some of his songs. To quote a movie, ""I think he was responsible for my first musical orgasm.""

And that's it! Saturday's supposed to be sunny and warm so we'll see how that day of the folk fest goes. =D =D =D"

And then I found the broth, and it's rekindled my desire to create, so I vow from this moment forward until the end of the month:

I will write at least one poem or song everyday.
I will draw or paint or spray paint something everyday.
And I will sew/create at least one thing a week.

Your role is to nag me about this, and ask me to write stuff for you, or to draw stuff for you, or to give me ideas on what to create (a shirt with a beautiful original stencil? SURE! A purse made entirely out of cd cases? SURE! A clear tuxedo jacket made entirely out of packing tape? We'll see about that one.. sounds like a two weeker but...

<b>So I gave my transcripts for university in like weeks ago and they still haven't been processed</b>, and yesterday was the cutoff, so hopefully they're just running behind and it didn't get lost. Basically, I'm gonna be really pissed off if this screws anything up for me, because I sent my transcript in the day my final marks came out. I'm actually really nervous that they've lost them though because everybody else's transcripts have already been processed, that I know of anyways.

Spending all my free time on the broth still. Except the art in the gallery is getting incredibly high quality now, here's some my stuff, some of it crappy because it was done with other people or its not finished: http://www.thebroth.com/snapshots309376.html  But check out the gallery, it's getting really good. If you guys have any ideas of what I should make next or wanna work on one with me, let me know.


<b>Gave my notice of resignation for my job on friday. My entire letter was basically a page long joke. </b> I wrote random stuff in arabic at one point, wrote about completely unrelated subjects and impossible situations and put random things in quotation marks and all sorts of fun. I'll post it sometime. My last day is Monday the 13th because I'm nice and said I would stay two extra days.

Right now it's me, my supervisor, and one of the night-shifters working evenings right now. A couple of part-timers but... meh. It's been just the three of us for the past 3 days, running the entire store. Which should be impossible, but we're sweet and amazing. 

Eventually the night-shifter is going to have to go back to nights though, because I've started a trend and someone on nights quit the day after I did. A couple of other people too. And now the night-shifter is thinking about quitting, as is my supervisor. Even if they don't, unless they find someone within the next week they're gonna have to shut down the store a couple of hours a week without me. But that's what they get for pissing off their employees.

I don't have another permanent job lined up yet, buuuut I'll be working at the Fringe (an eleven day theater festival, second biggest in the world) as a door-person/security. 45$ cash at the end of each 4 hour shift. Not bad. So I'll get to see a lot of the fringe too. I'm thinking I won't try to find a new job until the last week of august (as the fringe is wrapping up, and just relax until then).

If you're wondering how I can be so relaxed and confident that I'll get another job wherever I want just like that, you obviously don't understand the job market here right now. Some restaurant was in the newspaper the other day for bringin over people from Mexico and giving them apartments and cars and stuff just so that they could work here as dishwashers. There's about 70 000 job openings in my city right now and about 40 000 people without jobs max. And half of them don't want jobs.

I'm looking at a call-center job maybe, it pays 10-14$ an hour depending, plus benefits. If not that, some university job like at the hospital, or an apprentice job with some sort of trades company... carpentry or something maybe, or as a chef in a restaurant or something. We shall see.

Other than that, sweet outdoor music festival in my city next weekend. Got tickets for that. And a really huge rave down at the polish hall on september second that basically every raver in the city is looking forward to. Its gonna be effing bananas."

"event","Buahahha... I'm top 17 out of 507 on the broth. And this isn't even a good one (there's another I'm working on that I haven't touched in a while). It's just something me and some random guy slapped together. I made this yesterday and started out as 150 out of 503

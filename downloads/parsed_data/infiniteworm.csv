<br>
<br>
summer is amazing.
<br>
it's out of control.
<br>
i never want it to end.... this school year will probably be the
continuation of summer except with colder weather and occasional
homework. <br>
I have a few pictures from the crap I've experienced since leaving colorado...
<br>

parties, friends, camping, swimming, and a lot of fun later:<br>

The ones who showed up at your house just to talk, you went out with after school until late that night, were happy just hanging out even if you were doing the most unproductive things, being called out of school to go to stupid places with a group of those friends who were entertaining and actually cared about you....or the best friend's house you basically lived at, their parents who had dinner ready for you whenever you decided to show up...doing homework with each other, but not actually caring about school...

Those type of people don't exist here...I guess because they've never been able to make real friends in this place because no one is, and you don't really have the same opportunities. I'm missing out on the best times of my life. Here.

<P><FONT color=#3366ff>I don't understand what's wrong with me, but I haven't been very social or happy with anything going on...I never am. Never, since my 8th grade year, have I been satisified with any of my situations. The disturbing part is that I can't quit - I talk my way into what I want and where I want to be....when I'm there I hate it and the cycle begins again. I guess due to everything piling up since 8th grade, things are just getting worse for me (mentally/emotionally/whatever) and I'm afraid I'll never be able to commit.....however, when I was home for break I can say, for just about the first time that I can think of, I was actually pretty damn happy. My relationship is almost completely mended with my father, which has had the most impact on me in the past few years. My mother is still out of control, but when she upsets me now I can at least go to my father. Everything back at home seems to be calming down and forming into something I don't think I want to miss - I saw my brother for the first time in a year, my sister is thinking about getting married, my mom is getting married, and my dad finally moved to a new house. I feel like I'm seperating myself by being here, and for once I don't want to be...I want to be involved with their lives. For now, I would like to find a cure for my continuous nostalgia. Please. </FONT></P>

I'm listening to music from Moulin Rouge. 
Has this break really happened so far? What am I doing....I think it's going to be okay...
I had a riding lesson today with Annie...i loved it.
I get on the horse and she was all sorts of bitchy to me 
""Put your head up, heels down, shoulders back, elbows in, and make your horse bend.""
Aaahh, the things a trainer is supposed to say. 
It's great to be back in Kansas sometimes...
We went to the Kansas City symphony on Saturday; it was beautiful with the Choir...
I went to church last night with my grandma...it was cute.
I have so far spent the day with my mother; I hope we go to the horse auction tonight with Cliffton, I miss that cowboy.
Paul is going to dinner with us to this greet place - is that weird or is it just me? Inviting your favorite bartender to go out to dinner? He went back to school I guess - He's majoring in Psychology at KU...too bad I think he's probably almost 30. 
I get to see my brother tomorrow for the first time in a year...It's possible that I will start crying at the airport...and look insane hugging him. Go me. 
My sya application came in the mail - it's not going to be easy.

Boys boys boys....boys are everywhere and causing so much pain, confusion, and pleasure! 
I'm finishing my Ap Environmental project - I think I just printed out about 11 different graphs comparing different aspects of Thailand's population with the United States...I have NEVER put thsi much effort into a project before, but I desperately need all 75 points of this thing. 

OHHHHHHH LOOORRDDDD 
My stoamch is crazy lately but it's all okay because i have my cherry flavored PEPTO. ugh.

<P><FONT size=2>okay so I'm not feeling so great about jeramy writing so much about 'us' on xanga because people&nbsp;who shouldn't, do read it. I'm kind of scared of a lot of drama happening back at home because of it, and I've put myself in a weird situation because I don't know what to do. I was wondering if I should be a little suspicious of the whole ordeal because it has happened really fast...but at the same time I don't want to be and I want to let things happen&nbsp;since that's usually the way to go. I go home in 11 days...I'm counting like a freak. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I also can't decide with the&nbsp; whole school thing either - do I stay or do I go back to public? My friend Heather left me&nbsp;a comment on xanga and told me to go back...it's stuff like that which makes it difficult. I think I should. Kyle and Tyler were sending me messages on my phone last night - it was pretty cute and made me miss home again. Tyler wanted to know which alcohol I wanted for when I come home, aw..and Kyle told me to basically buy a bunch of xbox games and dvds to watch on his 100 inch projector screen tv thing...he's such a freak sometimes. How does any 19 year old afford to live in a three bedroom apartment, have all new furniture, a dog, and now this tv....? The respectable aspect is that he pays for everything on his own and works for it...sort of. His job is ridiculously easy sometimes I think, but he gets paid really well. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Aside from that rant...I want to be home, eating then walking around the plaza at night with a pretty boy, watching the horse carriages,&nbsp; waiting for the lights to turn on thanksgiving night, then go back to his&nbsp;own place&nbsp;and sleep, nothing else, until late into the next day when it can start all over again. I get this sappy syndrom all the time...but it will happen this time. I found a ton of pictures of the plaza so here we go, my favorite place to be:</FONT></P>

<P>Basically, I want to go home because of how socially fucked up this entire school. I never really though I would want to go home because of the people - I figured it be because I'm away from home or the work would be too stressful. How can some of these people stand themselves? I don't get it. Unfortunately, society is really just as stupid and stresses you out about being successful. Would it be that bad if I didn't come back? I'm afraid I'd hate myself so much...but at the same time I don't know. What would I miss out on? I'm never going to like anything I do anymore, I'm never satisfied with where I am. I have one year left of high school and I don't even know where I want to go to school for that one last year, let alone college.

<P><FONT size=2>I wish I could sleep more, and I'm about to buy some sort of medication that makes you drowsy so I can sort of just...sleep on command.

The thought of it when I wake up sucks, but when I'm down there by myself just with the horses...I don't know, this is probably sounding really strange. All I mean is that there is something about it, like getting away from this insane mini-community, just for that short amount of time. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I called my mom on the way back to my dorm, but her boyfriend/fiance thing answered the phone. It was actually very scary, but he assured me it was because she left her phone in his truck and they were both driving seperate cars to go see their horses. He said he might be out here, to campus, the end of this week or next to meet with Mr. Lewis about the indoor riding arena. I'm not very close with the guy, I mean, I've never really spent much time alone with him...but I think I would like to see him, especially if he would take me out to dinner while he's here. He has this weird infatuation with eating at the nicest of nice places, and making sure you feel like royalty while being there...he just loves making you feel like you're someone special.

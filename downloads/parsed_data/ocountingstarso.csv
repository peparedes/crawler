"event","TODAY..oh TODAY..work from 9 to 6:45...it was a 9 to 2 shift but they asked me if i wanted to stay till 5  and i thought to myself why not your feet are already in so much pain they might fall off but your already here...so again why not...well...5 came along and i said to myself...why not finish what your doing..get more hours...and more money..lose a toe or two...and keep going...so 6 came along...you only have 2 more boxes to go erin...only 50 more pairs of pants to ink tag hang and steam....just keep going...WHY NOT...so 630 comes along..almost done..just clean up your area and break down the boxes..you only have 8 toes left so why not make it a nice even 6??

so i finally finished to where i was satisfied....5 toes...no boxes...and nice steamed/pressed pants....5 t-stands worth...not to mention the t-stands are two-sided...so..

get to my car after painfully, agonizingly (word??) walking from express downstairs to whatever store that is...and getting to my car..then filling up my car with gas...and driving almost to red bug...when little precious kate calls...""hey erin..is that sale still going on right now?""..me-""well as a matter of fact yes..yes it is..."" kate-""is it any trouble if we can go together...i mean you get 30% discount and if its already 40% off then why not?""... me-""sure why not?""...

drive over to kates...we go to the mall..shes looking for an outfit to wear to a wedding this saturday....she tries on a BUNCH of stuff...and doesnt like anything because she feels fat in it...me and my new best buddy atwood...who yes is gay...thinks she is ridiculous...then he tells me how almost everyday girls will get all these clothes try them on...and wont admit they gained 10 pounds and refuses to buy a size bigger because they are still a size 6 in their pruny little brains...

well...she doesnt even get the cashmier blue sweater..DAMNIT..i wanted to wear that to work next!!!!

but at least she bought me dinner...so i was happy considering all i ate today was...oh wait...let me rephrase all i had today was 3 cups of WHITE CHRISTMAS coffee..this is the ONLY time of year i go to barnies...ummm Hello...white christmas=BEST EVER.

okay..well i am done complaining...in all..today was a very long day..ps-no..my pinkie toe did NOT make it through today.

never again will i wear those shoes...so what if i got a lot of compliments on my outfit today...NEVER AGAIN..and yes i will have to admit i looked professional.

hey guess what?? i might keep this job..

oh and guess what again?? i think im back to my old rambling on...no complete sentences entries i use to do...did you miss them??? ohh i thought so.

oh and i do agree with kathleen thinking that the 2000 election votes were rigged...i mean how convenient that little jebbie is your brother AND he's the governor of florida?? mmm?? i think the hanging chads were just a conspiracy...BUT..i still love my george."

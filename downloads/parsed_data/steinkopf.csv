"event","I don't even remember the last time I wrote in here. Usually, I look at my journal first to see when the last time I wrote, but I didn't this time.

Things still suck a lot. Things always have sucked and they always will.
Here is a list of the things I hate (not neccessarily in order or a full list.)

- Me (Just me in general. I hate how I'm not skinny. I hate how I'm FAT. People that ""care"" about me say I'm not, but their just stupid and can't see it. Ask anyone else if they think Jessica Hoff is fat, and more likely than not, they will.)

- My life (I hate how my family is more or less poor. It doesn't mean anything that my dad makes about 1,500 every two weeks or whatnot. More than half of it goes to the bills that are Way overdue, leaving us with no money. Not to mention that my dad spends TONS of it on crap that we/he doesn't need. Like lottery tickets. Has anyone noticed that I have to wear the same pair of pants EVERYDAY? Normal girls my age have like, 10 pairs of jeans. I have one.)

- Skinny Girls (I hate them because they dress likes sluts. I know that I want to be skinny (and that is why I'm swearing off food again) but I'm not going to be a whore when I am skinny. They make me sick.)

- Mr. Mac (He's such an asshole. Earlier this year he asked me if I was going to try and pass class at all. Needless to say, I didn't pass first semester. I hate him and he's a bad teacher. Not to mention he has the most annoying sounding voice. Half yuppy upper-class seeming ""I went to Yale, so I'm smarter than you"" and half mick.)

- School (What can I say? Everyone knows it sucks major ass. Everyone knows that Maine West is a shitty school. There's also that fact that I can't pay attention in classes half the time and all I want to do is read (I think I may have ADD or something.)

- Practically everyone at school
  - Paraprofessionals (THEY FEEL THE NEED TO PATROL THE LIBRARY AND THE BATHROOMS. No more needs be said about them. Just that they invade your quiet space at the library.)
  - Deans (Just because they're all assholes, even if I've only met like, two.)
  - Teachers (except Ms. Weisgerber and Ms. Kamai and sometimes Mr. McClure.)
  - Almost everyone else. (Just because everyone annoys me. Or stands in the middle of the hallways during passing period and then give you dirty looks when they get shoved because you're trying to get to class.)

- My Family
  - Dad (because he's such an asshole and so annoying. Like today, I came home from school and ended up going to sleep because I had nothing else to do (which is my fault, because I didn't want to go downtown with the guys.) and I woke up to the TV blaring some stupid war movie or something. It was insanely loud and I could hear it perfectly thru the door and wall. Naturally I couldn't go back to sleep. Also, I hate how he spends money THAT WE DON'T EVEN HAVE.)
  - Mom (She's just so unreliable and I don't know... I hate how she can't ever keep track of money. I can't wait until she get's her teeth fixed because maybe she'll be able to get a real job and we can have some more money. And I hate how all she ever does is sleeps. I'm glad I have Wynslow to drive me to school in the mornings or else I'd have to deal with a crabby bitch every morning which would just make me pissed off at school all the time (not to say that I'm not always pissed off at school).)
  - Pat (He's an ASSHOLE but he's gotten somewhat better I suppose. Sometimes he's nice to me and sometimes he's not. I would prefer it if he just left me alone and didn't think about me. And it annoys me how he doesn't do anything. I don't even think he has a job. And he's not going to school this semester so he just sits at home eating the minimal amount of food we have left that doesn't involve the use of other ingrediants (sp?).)
  - Sam (I HATE little kids. She is the most annoying, bratty little cunt I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. That is pretty harsh to say about a little kid, especially since I have met Amanda and I hate her with every molecule in my fat little body. And I hope that her extrememly fat body hates me too. But anyway, Sam is just an annoying brat. She never shuts up and she does things to purposely make me mad.)

- Rich People (And by rich people, I mean anyone who is rich. (Except for Wyn's mom. She is too nice to us and gives up so much money and although she has a pretty big apartment/condo or whatever you want to call it, she doesn't have tons of nice things. She's got one nice TV with a DVD player and a VCR, but she didn't even buy it.) But just everyone else. Unless, I guess, they're like Wyn's mom and give away a lot of money for good causes and shit. But like Lauren Jozefat who flaunts it (even if she doesn't mean to) by telling everyone where she is going for Spring Break or where she went over Christmas Break and shit. It's like, WHO THE FUCK CARES? Just because your family can afford a cruise to the Caribbean or wherever the fuck else, doesn't mean that everyone wants to know. I sure as hell don't. And then celebrities that spend 6000 dollars on a purse or something and then Vogue or TeenVogue praises them like they've just spent that money to do something good in the world when all they did was buy a fucking purse.)

Right now, I do not feel like continuing my list.
It's making me feel like shit and I'm resolving myself to stop eating so I get skinny and to get a job so that I can have more than one pair of jeans and such things like that. Like shirts. I have about 5. I have to wear the same ones each week. It makes me want to kill myself. 

But that's besides the point....

Actually, there isn't a point. I just had to do all that because I hate myself so much. And I'm admitting to it. I'm a dumb fuck, and seriously depressed, but what does it matter? Ha. 

Soon I'll be dead. And that will be the end.

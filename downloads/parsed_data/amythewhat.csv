"event","i want to do computer animation and artsy stuff.  pff. science.  i'll just finish this degree then go off and do my own thing after then.  screw grad school.  that's how i feel right now anyway.  as neat as fish are, i'd much rather mess around with animation and design.  it doesn't matter what field i go into, if it's something i enjoyed before it was a job, it'll become a chore once i do it.  same thing with fisheries, as much as i enjoy learing about them now, it'll become a chore if i get a job in it.  might as well be something i enjoy moreee during my free time.  i stopped researching on my spare time because i hate school so much and i draw now.  what's the difference if i switched the two.  i hate college.  it makes me not want to learn anything.  and if i got a job in design, i might hate drawing and instead learn things on my spare time.  i don't know.  but i do know that whatever i'm doing now isn't going to work.  so i'll finish this degree since i'm half way through and then see if i can do something in the artsy field.  won't make much but atleast i'll be happy.  if anything, just as happy as i would be a researcher except i'd save 4 years of my life and i wouldn't make as much money.  but that's ok.  all i need is food, home, computer, and internet.  and i really mean that.  i've been that way since i got my first computer."

"event","many thanks, not just one, that's not good enough.  many more than one.  like, 5.  but that's not many.  i guess 'many' is a subjective term.  so to me, 5 could be a lot.  but if i admit that's a lot, maybe i'm self-absorbed and ungreatful.  if 5 is too much, then i am a needy, overly, freakishly thankful person.  there's a word for those...  like..  i don't know.  but there is one.  but then again, it depends on who i'm thanking.  if i'm thanking someone who saved my life when i clearly didn't want to die, like if i was trying to fight off an enraged bear and someone shot it in the head, i'd be dumping thanks by the, um, not dozens, that's not enough, more like dozer-fulls.  if someone picked up my pencil when i dropped it and invaded my space to pick it up for me, i'd be half a thanking.  the point is...  i'm not making a point.  my point is, i just wrote a paper and it turned out pretty well."

"event","I am so tired.  My dreams are becoming more and more realistic, and last night, I had one that I couldn't get out of, meaning I would have lost, so I woke up.  I can't lose in my own dream.  I'd say it is a good thing my dreams are more realistic because they reflect my thoughts, which are now more grounded in reality and not in some fanciful, imaginative world that doesn't exist.  Chemistry exam taken today at 8:30am and it was no fun.  Talked to my english instructor about a final paper that is coming up.  I suck at writing.  He said I am over academizing my essays for how much space we are given to write.  I have to, I can't stand writing something that could so easily be misinterpreted, even if it means confusing the hell out of the reader.  Uuuuuughhhhhh.  Well, he is supportive and helping me out so my situation is the better of what could have been and what could be.  Now I just need to decide whether it's worth it to sacrifice what IIIII think about these papers we read and critique to be better graded and get a good gpa, or (at the expense of a couple gpa points) find a happy medium where I can express what I think about the papers.  College isn't about learning.  It's about the GPA.  GPA GPA.  I am starting to see college as a test that I pay to take rather than an opportunity for higher education.  If I do well, I get a degree.  If I don't, no matter how much I learn and how applicable it is to the real world, I just wasted thousands of monies.  Either that or I just learn a lot slower than everyone else.  Probably a little of both.  I do learn slow.  Well, I learn at my own pace.  Which is kind of a lazy pace.  Continuation of broken sentence.

My thoughts are like a ball of string and I can't seem to straighten them out.  My english instructor is so good at pulling the ends and it all comes straight.  Everything he says is ordered in a logical succession, I'm assuming, carefully thought out so I can understand.  What I say is pulling a ball out of a hat on impulse.  It's really hard to have a thought and then try to explain it.  I wonder how and why our thought processes are so different and how I can learn how to think like he does when I need to."

i didn't see sonata arctica tonight.  it really really really bummed me out, but i'm glad things happened the way they did.  i wouldn't have had it any other way.  if i did go to the show, i would have never brought things up the way i did.  but then again, who knows what would have happened.  i just appreciate things the way they happened and the way they are right now.  like the peanutbutter and jelly sandwich i just ate.

"event","i've found something that i don't do for a reason.  that is analyze what is going on behind the scenes of.... everything.  commercials, social transactions, movies, etc.  and i realized why i don't.  it's because it's all very uncomfortable.  i am going through this book for an essay i need to write about diversity and discrimination, and here is a quote.  ""I nevertheless found it ironic that we were the three ""others,"" consuming presumably for pleasure a glorification of oppressive values [in the form of a musical], some of the very values that contributed in complex ways to our oppression"" (109, Stepping Across, Julia Eklund Koza).  This comes from a middle aged, white, middle-class female.  it's so much easier to just see this as simple actions and words instead of looking deeper into intentions and subconsious motivations.  especially living in enumclaw and bonney lake (back when there were virtually no minorities) i have learned it is much easier to shrug off any possible racist comments, not just racist, but sexist too.  that's probably why i don't really associate much with asians anymore.  and i don't like flowers.  or other really girly things.  and it probably plays a part in encouraging my video game play, guitar, metal, and other not-very-girly qualities.  but it is who i am.  and if it does affect me, it is making me more into that direction.  i have noticed some things with my skill level in video games and guitar playing.  often times when i beat a guy at a videogame, i sense a little tension and discomfort.  when i play my guitar better than a guy, i sense the same thing, but even more.  and it doesn't feel good, i am not aggressive in that way (and i don't really know if those feelings are just from losing or also from losing to a girl, which i often hear when i am playing with two or more guys).  when i am better than a girl, they ask me to play more.  and with games, well, i don't feel that, but not many girls play games.  i'm also aware of the way some guys treat me, how they feel that they can invade my personal space to hit on me or impress or whatever.  and what i am really thinking is what the fuck get the fuck out of my face i am doing something.  if it were legal to kill people, i would be stabbing alot of people's eyes out aggressively.  don't fucking stare at me, atleast have the courtesy to look when i am not looking at you, i'm not here for your enjoyment, in fact, i'd be happy to be here to make life a little less enjoyable for you.  unfortunately if i were to say that, i feel that i'd be asking for a quarrel, in that case, so i keep my mouth shut.  the problem with feelings like this is to start associating them with cases in which they are not appropriate.  like assuming everyone is treating me like crap or racism or sexism or stupidism or whateverism."

Looked back at old entries, and jeeeez I've really straightened up.  I was pretty fucked up.  I say the same things but I have a different understanding now.  And my randomness was kind of disturbing.  When I read what I wrote, I remember why and what I was thinking, and it is so screwed up I think that I should delete everything I wrote back then.  But same thing with old drawings.  I actually spent a lot of time arguing with myself.  I don't do that anymore, but I remember doing it, and it was involuntary.  I knew a lot back then but understood very little.  I understand now what is important to understand.  The rest of my life will be like floating down a slow river."

"event","can't sleep once again.
i was just thinking about how boring it was trying to sleep and not being able to.

i picked up my guitar and played it, i feel more comfortable with it as if we got in an argument and made up.

yep.

world of warcraft still owns my soul.

aaand...  sean and i broke up.  thats actually what this post was supposed to be about from the beginning.  i feel it will be better for us and that we will learn alot about ourselves through this.  i'm glad we're both cool with it, it was a mutual thing, we are going to stay friends and cherish our memories because again, i don't regret anything.  i really need to learn about myself on my own as it seems.  how would i have known i am my biggest obstacle?  but i like it that way.  it'd suck if, say, this bag of cough drops was my biggest obstacle.  i mean, how would i over come that?  well, burn it.  ok, well, what about the empire state building?  well, burn that too.  OK, how about anything green or brown, that would be pretty tough, so yeah, uh huh, my point exactly.


bitch...

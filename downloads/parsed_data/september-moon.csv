"event","I probably won the silliest person at Christ church award (if they were giving it out).  Me and Megan did some dances with the kids...it was so funny.  Then my boss said that one night we (the staff) should get drunk and watch ""sweatin to the oldies""..then i added that we should videotape it.  

Got a new phone...I'm thinking of downloading some ring tones...Rock the Casbah (in honor of ashley) maybe?  oh well.  Nothing is going on this weekend.  But tomorrow night i'm going out to dinner for my mom's b-day..crap i still have to wrap her gift. 

Yesterday I took Matt to a baseball game.  It was really cute how he was teaching me all the positions for baseball... I must have sounded like a complete idiot...oh well..you know what else sucks? everytime Matt sees me i have crappy, and i mean CRAPPY hair days...it looked totally awesome today, but did i see matt? no of course not.  I look hot on the days i don't try and when i do try..let's not even go there.

I'm a loser home on a friday night because Megan and Kate are both babysitting. UGH. Now I'm just reading over my notes from class this week.

Lindsay came home from NJ (i'm surprised)...ugh..i think i have to see her tomorrow...NOOOOOOOO

that's enough for now..shower time

"event","What I did this summer:

1.  Went to Paris and London
2.  Worked at christ episcopal church summer camp
3.  Went to New York
4.  went to a few parties with Megan, Kate and Ashley
5.  went out with Aaron and Jeff (not at the sametime..i'm no slut)
6.  discovered my new found love in the olympic men's swimming competitions
7.  bought a lot of CDs
8.  Met Modest Mouse while shopping at H&M in New York
9.  Went to summer school
10. saw garden state and saved! (AWESOME MOVIES)

...basically not a lot.  
ugh so now school as started again and lucky me i have class with ""wanna shoot some snakes"" boy and his best friend.  When they walked into the class they had the biggest grin on their face when they saw me, i wanted to crawl into a hole and hide.  THen the girl next to me said that one of the guys was staring at me the whole class time! ahhhhhhhhhh.  But my reward for starting school was going out that night and seeing garden state with Matt.  Then i got a flat tire....yeah..I'll remember this first date.

I miss ashley soooo much.  I think we call eachother like 10 times a day but keeping missing each other.  Hopefully I will go down to UF to visit her soon.

Talked to Will tonight, he's sooooooo freakin' negative - it's unreal.

We are celebrating my mom's b-day this weekend...which reminds me, i need to get her a gift CRAP!!!

well i need to take a shower and get ready for bed

peace out

Cuz things - they never work out right.
The wrong way.
THe lonely way.

You told me that the daylight burned you
And that the sunrise was enough to kill you.

You said 'It's quite possible I feel truly dead inside'

"event","yeah it sucked. i got into one of those moods. the kind where you punish yourself in listening to a song that floods you with sooo many emotions and you don't know what else to do but cry.  yeah that was me last nite.  i thought about will--the good, the bad and the ugly parts of him.  Damn him for being so fuckin hot.  i stole his driver's license..thinking then it was his motorcycle license.but now that i look at it..its his driver's license! ops. oh well. so yeah i cried a lot last nite. i kept saying i'm sorry to his picture.  i came to terms last nite that i still love that asshole.  i mean seriously there an hour doesn't go by that i dont think of him.  and sadly he doesn't know that.  i couldn't explain our relationship.  i mean this guy thought the world of me. i could come home looking like shit and this guy would tell me I was the most beautiful woman in the world and actually mean it.  god i miss the way he looked at me...i felt amazing just by him looking at me. I'll try to scan a photo of him later. i want to talk to him and explain why i left and how i compare every guy i meet to him.  i understand that will and i had this different kind of love for eachother..but it was still love..and i shouldn't compare sex with eric to making love with will..'cause there is a difference between making love and just having sex.

speaking of eric he wrote me an email today..i don't know what to make of it..they do say absence makes the heart grow fonder..but still..i think its a little much i've only known the guy for like a month(i'm talking about the last paragraph)


<lj-cut text=""eric's email""> So whats going on? How has your day been going? I wish you I can see you.
There is not much going on here just working. It gets pretty boring just
walking around looking for trouble. But its all good. So its Friday night
whats your plans? Mine are lift study and watch TV and sleep. Very exciting
isnt it. So tell me what guys are going to be going out with since im not
there?jk. I think us being together is going to be good for are
relationship. Do you agree? Especially if you get to come home with me! 

To me I think you are one of the sweetest, kindest, and caring girls Iv ever
dated. Everyday goes bye and the feelings I get for you get stronger and
more meaningful. I hope they are the same for you. I really care about
you!!!!!!!!! Well I got to go. I miss you!!!!! Ill Write more later. XOXO
MUWA  </lj-cut>


sometimes i don't really understand some of his sentences..oh well.  but he's been pretty good with writing to me everyday..i just don't think i'm ready to go meet his parents..i don't want to rush things.

yeah i'm gonna go and listen to some death cab..i'll write more later

still can't eat. i don't know..i've just been in some sort of depression..not a major one..but i'm just not myself. and its not because eric left. i could care less i don't even miss him to be honest.

i see all these people at school who all know eachother and talk about memories and stuff and there i am just watching, sooo bad wanting to have someone i can relate to and talk about stuff that happened in high school or anything really.

i'm at this point right now where i feel like i can't relate to anyone..even eric. i know he likes me WAY more than i like him and i just can't relate to him. i've moved around a lot, experienced way more than many people my age have. and have done things i'm not proud of.

i know i won't find someone in the jax area..its just known..don't be friends with people born and raised here...they are a little..how do you say it.....HICKS!!!!

i guess i'll write later...i really don't want to type anymore

the second one he is going ot have to open on his birthday (1/31)..which contains: party favors,his favorite candies,  plates, napkins, a toy gun, handcuffs, cups and noise makers..haha too cute. he's gonna kill me. and then lindsay is going to write him this long letter explaining the whole birthday care package.

lol i totally raided publix when my mom gave me the idea to make him cookies...this is gross..i'm being cute and almost wanna throw up..oh well. i don't have to see him for a month. it will be cake.

anyways..before i left for NJ, i hung out with ryan again...ugh i think he likes me..wait i know he does...so why do i hangout with him? 'cause i have nothing better to do.  I don't want to hang out with lindsay and her new boyfriend,..he's a cool guy and all..but i don't need to watch them suck face.gross.

ohhh my ggggoooooodddddd..best part of my trip so far..meeting eric in the airport.  So let me set up the whole scene for you....Dad and i are sitting in our little terminal, waiting an extra 2 hours because our flight to Newark was delayed for unknown reasons.  So sitting across from me is this cute guy and some his friends they are all decked out in Navy gear..HOT.  his friends suddenly leave because they just realized that their flight has been moved to another terminal...so that just leaves him.  I keep catching him looking at me..and i start blushing..i told my dad that i'm gonna go to the bathroom (to fix my hair DUH!) so i come back and my dad and this cute guy (eric) are talking! score!!! my dad rocks.  anyways the three of us start talking about the Navy, school and how there really isn't anything to do in Jacksonville.  Then he (eric) suddenly just starts to ask me questions about what i like to do for fun and stuff and if i've been to the bar 8 seconds.  I give him the excuse that i can't hear him and move to sit next to him. smooth.  we start talking and giggling.  best line ever...

""you know about the Navy guys reputation right?""
""yeah i've heard to stay away from guys like you""
""yeah guys in the navy are dicks, that's why i don't hang out with them""
""oh i see""
""yeah i'm a good navy guy. we should get together when we both get back from our trips""
""sounds great""

exchange numbers..i'm the biggest dork 'cause i whip out my cell phone to store his number and i'm shaking (one because i'm cold, and two because i'm nervous because i can't believe this awesome guy wants to hang out with me) so i just said ""umm..why  don't i just write down your number"" haha i'm a dork. 
so we exchange numbers and its all good..we are like the last ones to get on the plane..my dad gets on early 'cause he can see i'm working my ""magic"" hahahahha.

Eric: ""call me when you get back into town""
Me: ""well i get back in monday, before you""
Eric: ""so you can't call me? I'll still have my phone in Ohio"" (*that's where he's from)
Me: ""true..but i don't want to bother you""
Eric: ""you mean i have to call you first? ugh..fine"" (he says that with a smile on his face)

then finally we all got off the plane and my dad goes to help this lady with a baby so i'm waiting for him in the new terminal and eric walks up to me and keeps me company..how awesome...and PS..he said he's not working new years! yes!!!! i know who i'm kissing at new years! a hot navy boy from ohio! score!!!!

okay now onto my hilarious family..okay first of all my aunt moi got a new rack and was showing it to everyone.  there is no one like moi..i think she flashed me about 200 times last nite..it was great.  I spent sometime with my grandpa it was nice.  Aunt biddy had a party for all of us and i sat next to grandpa and he started hitting on me!  ( i don't think he realized i was his grand daughter,..he's 91 for pete's sake) here are some of his lines :

""you're a very pretty girl"" (he said that about every 5 minutes..like clock work)
""your eyes, they hypnotize me""
""where have you been all my life?""

too cute. then grandpa kept looking at me and then i would look back at him and he would start to giggle and i said ""why are you laughing?"" and he goes ""that's my way of flirting!"" ahahahahahahaha too funny.

well i'm looking forward to leaving Jersey tomorrow..wow i don't miss living here..too damn cold. i hate snow..i'm over it. well i'd better get some sleep

peace

Ps.- not looking forward to coming home to a house of 2 new house guests..what's so great is that even with 7 people and a dog now living in the house..it still isn't crowded...i'm going to probably end up being a chain smoker and alcoholic by the end of the next semester..good times"

"event","Hi there. My name is Cassie, and this is my sale / trade journal. I will be selling a lot of different items here. I have shirts, pants, skirts, purses, CDs, etc. Mostly I'm selling it all because I have a lot of things that I don't wear or use, and I am leaving for college next Fall. I need to clear out the space so that I don't have to deal with the sorting when the time comes for me to leave.

I have done many sales and trades online, and I am very reliable; I wouldn't have this journal if I didn't really want to sell you my stuff. 

Here are the things you need to know: I accept Paypal, postal money orders, and cash (at your own risk). I do trades occasionally. I will ship internationally, but you have to pay the extra costs. I normally ship on Mondays or Saturdays. 
Anything else you need to know is in the userinfo.

<b>(11.20.2004)</b> <b>NEW STUFF ADDED!</b> I added a new purse to the purses section, and I added a bunch of stuff to the ""random items"" section, including some picture frames, some fun games, and other junk! Everything still has super-cheap prices, and I'm still offering <b>free shipping to anyone who pays with Paypal</b>! Also, I added accessories and bracelets to the ""random items"" entry. CHECK IT OUT! And buy! :)"

&gt;&gt; Size medium (but fits like a small) black and white flowery shirt. It doesn't show in the photo, but this shirt actually has a V-neck. Really good for dressing up, 'cause it's made of a flowy, silky material. I bought it from target for $18. It's got a zipper on the side, and it's a lot cuter on you than it looks in the photo.

<b>Beautiful dress for sale!</b>
It is a size medium from the brand City Triangles. I bought it at Foley's for $70 to wear for the Homecoming parade and I haven't touched it since. It's in perfect condition, no signs of wear whatsoever. I would looove to keep it, but I honestly have nothing to wear it with. It's pretty much all black with the long pink strands that go around the back and tie in the front. It's a very pixie-esque dress. There's a low neck with the straps, and then there is a small slit in the front. There is also padding on the inside of the chest part. Measurements are as follows (these were hard to do because the bottom is many different lengths, but I did my best) --
<u>Bust</u>: 15"" across, so 30"" all the way around.
<u>Length of pink strands (measured from waist)</u>: 41""
<u>Straps</u>: 17""
<u>Length from center-top to center-bottom</u>: 29""
<u>Length from waist to center-bottom</u>: 19""
<u>Length of side, all the way from the top (below strap)</u>: 34""
<u>Length of side from waist</u>: 22""
<U>Length of back, from center-top to center-bottom</u>: 32""
<u>Another note on the fit</u>: I am 5'8"", with a 34B bust (36""), and it fits me beautifully. I have 38"" hips and a 32"" waist. 

Those are all the possible measurements I can think of, and I can't think of anything else to tell you. It's a soft, silky material on the upper part, and the bottom part is two layers -- one soft, silky black and the other is sheer. It is made up of 100% polyester.
I am going to sell this dress for <b>$30 with shipping and handling</b>, which is less than half of what I paid for it. I will even ship internationally if you are willing to pay $30 for it.
If you want some more pictures, comment and let me know. My camera batteries died before I could take anymore.
If you have any other questions, comments, or whatever, email me at <u>kamikaze_romance@yahoo.com</u>.

&gt;&gt; Size 9 Unionbay cargo skirt with six pockets. I have only worn this twice, and I don't really like it. The length is about 22"", and the waist is about 30"". It's an olive color, and it's a really nice skirt with a fray in the front to make it look like it's cut, but it's really not.

&gt;&gt; Size large black corduroy skirt. I like this skirt because it's really cute, and has a little pleat in the front. The waist is about 31"" and the length is about 20"". The second picture shows you the pleat. There is one small defect with it, though: the back zipper won't stay up, and I'm not sure why. I use a safety pin, though, to pin it to together at the top, and it holds it together, so it's nothing that can't be fixed.

&gt;&gt; Size 9 Dickies red capris, with a 30"" waist and a 24"" inseam (measurements from the dickiesgirl website). These are great pants, with a nice vibrant red color.

They are 30"" in the waist and 30"" long. These pants are literally <span style=""font-weight: bold"">brand new without tags</span>, and I think I would die if I let them go for anything cheaper than what they are. I paid $40 for them, and have only tried them on because they are too short. (I accidently got a 9 regular instead of 9 long).

These are the only shorts I have. The baby blue ones are by Unionbay, and they are a <b>size 9</b>. They are blue with red stitching, and they are a soft, non-denim material. I don't know how to explain them. They're kind've like cargo shorts. They aren't very worn, and they are in super condition. On an average, I think I've only worn them like twice? 

Then there are the dark denim SO shorts, <b>size 9</b>, with red stitching and a slight fade. They are really cute shorts, but I never wear them. 

The white shorts are a <b>size 9</b> by SO, also. They have hardly been worn. They are white with baby blue stitching.

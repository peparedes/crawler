Hours it Took You to Finish DH: Maybe 10...I read it in bits, so I wasn't really paying attention.

<b>BEFORE</b>

Former Favorite HP Book: Prisoner of Azkaban

Canon (or Not Disproved) Ships You Supported: R/Hr

Number of DH Theories You Had: A lot, I guess. 

Describe Your Best/Favorite Theory: That the Deathly Hallows was this place, between the living and the dead. It sort of made me think of the veil Sirius fell through, like the Deathly Hallows are in there, Harry and Luna heard voices. I thought that would be significant, but I guess not. I though Harry would have to go there, for some reason to do with horcruxes or whatever, and he'd meet everyone who died. I guess this sort of happened and it was really cool, but what the Deathly Hallows really were was pretty lame.  

What Time Did You Get it at?: 4:00 AM Sunday morning. 


<b>DURING</b>

What you did/thought about...

The Seven Potters: Totally came out of nowhere, and when I saw the title and picture I assumed Harry would be hallucinating, a la PotC: At World's End Jack Sparrow style. I think the funniest part was Fleur agreed to do it. 

Regulus: Ehh. The sign on his door was funny?

Ron Leaving: I understand why he left, and I was not mad he did, like some people were. He had family he left behind, he was torn. And that locket probably effected him the most because it knew how to target him. The book was awfully boring while he was gone, though. And I wish he could have gone to Godric's Hollow with them. But I loved it when he came back. Ron has grown so much. 

Godric's Hollow: Just how I imagined it to be. It was perfect with the snow. I was afraid Harry would go there alone, and I would have loved Ron there, but I was glad Hermione was there. She has always been so supportive, and I truly liked her in this chapter. The snake part was really weird and I was really confused on what was happening at first. And that statue that turned into a memorial of the Potters was really weird. o_O

The Deathly Hallows: So confused, so disapointed. I feel like it really had nothing to do with defeating Voldemort, I feel like Harry could have done it without that wand. The only part I truly hated about this book. I hate that something completely new was brought halfway through the last book and it didn't do anything. Wtf. 

Breaking into Gringotts: It was a little drawn out. And I wish that dragon was Norbert!! 

Aberforth and Ariana: Aberforth was hilarious, and a good counterpart to Dumbledore without being evil. I could tell they're related. Dumbledore's backstory bored me and I'm still not sure what happened with all of it. 

Snape Being Good: I knew him killing Dumbledore was part of the plan, I always knew. I don't know why people ever thought it wasn't, especially the things Snape told Harry as Harry persued him. Like close your mind and stuff. But I don't think he's entirely good, still. He still did a bunch of shit and if it wasn't for Harry's Mom, he wouldn't have cared. I agree with JKR, I think he's brave, but he's no hero. 

Harry Being a Horcrux: I knew this was coming and ehh whatever. I mean, there had to be significance to Harry and Voldemort being connected. 

King's Cross: I basically wanted to skip over this chapter, cause it completely cut into the middle of the action climax of the entire novel. But I'm glad I read it, because even though Dumbledore really annoyed me this entire book and in this chapter, there were some great quotes in this chapter. 

The Epilogue: Ehh, it was okay. It's just the name thing that got me. And it was weird to see them all have kids now. I didn't really like it, but I guess I'm kind of glad it's there. I like it more now after the things JKR devulged about the other characters and what their jobs are. 


AFTER

New Favorite HP Book: Ehh. I'm not sure. Maybe Deathly Hallows, just because it's the finish. And I felt it contained many elements from all of the novels. 

Canon Ships You Now Support: R/Hr. Still. Always. 

Number of Your Theories That Came True (or Sort of Did): Eh, a lot of things surprised me in this book. I guess one that really comes to mind is just the whole Snape thing and how the whole killing of Dumbledore was planned between them. 

Overall Impression of DH: It was...interesting. Not exactly what I expected, but when I finished, I was satisfied. It may have been corny, just throwing in all these things that appeared in other novels for one last time, but I loved that. It was like, little reminders of the entire series in which I followed and was now ending. The battle scene was....epic. My favorite by far. 

Favorite Part: The entire battle scene. omg. I knew what was going to happen, but my heart was pounding. A book has never done that to me. And I really loved the part where Harry was walking to his death. I cried so much and was glad Harry didn't just bring back his parents. Afterall, I do feel like Sirius and Lupin are to James as Ron and Hermione are to Harry and are just as important as influences in his life. 

Least Favorite Part: The entire thing about the Deathly Hallows and all about Dumbledore's past. I didn't even read those articles Rita Skeeter wrote about Dumbledore.  

Saddest Part: Harry walking into the forest and Dobby's funeral. And I feel really gloomy now about Fred being dead ;_;

Coolest Part: The battle scene. The last like 100-200 pages. Perfection. 

Best Completely Unexpected Part: All of those people coming back to fight. Like Oliver Wood and Cho Chang, lol wtf? It was cool though. And I guess the Malfoys sort of being redeemed. Not really though, they still did bad things, but you know. I loved that Narcissa saved Harry. Love.  

Best New Character: Were there really new characters? I guess Luna's dad, but I didn't like him...so I dunno. 

Saddest Character Death: At the time, Dobby. But now I'm really depressed about Fred. Like, really JKR, wtf? Apparently she had this planned all along?? How random is that! 

Best Magic/Magical Item: Hermione's purse was fucking awesome. It makes me think of Mary Poppin's carpet bag. FTW.

I sat down to write this and realized that I first picked up the Sorcerer's Stone after it lying under my bed for a few months, a little daunting due to it's size (which is like a picture book now compared to the last few books) when my mom randomly bought it for me saying it was supposed to be really good and i was like who the hell is Harry Potter?, when I was in fifth grade and eleven. It was the summer and Goblet of Fire was about to be released and I think I quickly read the next two rapidly in the hallway at the local Y on an old leather couch as my sister had swim lessons. I remember going to the bookstore the day, or a few days after, GoF was released and picking it up, all excited. I did a book report on it for school the following year. Years after, I got books 5 and 6. And now finally 7, in which I attended the midnight party, but didn't actually recieve the book until later that day because really, who was going to wait in a 500+ line? And I read that book at the age of 18. I basically followed Harry at exactly the same ages.....I guess I really am part of that Potter generation the paper talked about. 

Okay, well. That above paragraph was a lot longer than I intended it to be. I was really just planning on saying ""I started reading the series at 11 and ended at 18."" Fin. 

Where to begin really? I know, I'm ashamed, I tried really hard, but I read spoilers. But really, all that I looked at was the stuff about the Epilogue and lol'd, cause really, <i>Albus Severus</i>? wtf? I read the book, knowing basic outline, all who died. But for some reason, I still felt the entire time, especially around pg 400 and on, that I was reading it without knowing what was to happen. I still turned every page, fearing Harry, Ron, or Hermione would die, even though I really knew they wouldn't. During the battle scene, I literally felt my heart pounding, not wanting Voldemort to win, even though I knew he didn't. I was pleasently surprised reading spoilers didn't really effect my reading experience at all. If anything at all, I was a little more prepared for the deaths that did happen and little more understanding of all the Horcuxes/Hallows mess going on. 

I was really surprised at all the deaths in the novel. Uh, exactly where were the two major characters that died? Because in all truth, only really are the trio main characters, but I always knew there was no way two of them were going to end up dying, but still. I'm thinking either of these ""major"" characters were Lupin, Tonks, or Snape. Snape and Lupin probably. But I dunno. I wasn't really effected by any of the deaths, except Hedwig made me feel like I got a blow to the gut, Dobby was the one that made me sob the most, and Fred was totally unnecessary. I know Hedwig was significant, but I never ever once stopped to think JKR would kill off one of their pets (which makes me think...where the hell was Pig and Crookshanks during the entire book? At the Burrow??). I never really liked Dobby all that much, I mean he was okay and helpful, but I never had a love for him or anything, but wow. His whole burial was just powerful. It was the first time in several chapters we got a little break from all the action and danger and all was ""calm"" for a bit, but it was just to bury Dobby. And really, Fred, wtf? It's not even that I don't think he shouldn't have died because I love him to pieces, but ever since that Mrs. Weasley boggart scene in OotP, when she feared for every member of her family's life (and believe me...chances with such a large family, at least someone was going to bite it), I really hoped that JKR would repieve all of them. If there would be at least one family that were to survive, it would be the Weasleys. It just sort of pisses me off. I would have liked to see it end nicely for all of them after all they've done. And really, out of all them, why Fred? George without a Fred is like...not right. And why did she pick Fred over George? I know really, in the books, there's no difference distinguished at all between them, but is like George > Fred in JKR's mind? I'd like to hear her jusification for randomly killing Fred, I really would. Snape really had it coming, I feel like that charcter has had his story finished. Lupin too, which kind of pissed me off how he was handled in this book, THE FINAL BOOK, but I guess now that I think about it, it's justifiable. He's lost all of his friends, he rushed into a marriage with Tonks and is about to come a father to a werebaby, and there's this whole war going on. Remus Lupin remains one of my favorite characters, and that's saying a lot as there are many that really just don't do it for me. I knew ever since Sirius died, he was a poor soul and belonged with his friends. I knew he was going to die. I feel content in that he did. It was still sad, but I finally feel he is at peace and the Maurder's story is finished. As for Tonks, I'm begining to think that she was only ever created to be some sort of romantic interest for Lupin. In OotP, she didn't do much, changed her appearance a lot and stuff. HBP she was all moody and down about Lupin. She was hardly in DH, being Lupin's baby momma and locked up. I know they had just had a baby, but when the battle was about to happen and Lupin showed up, I was totally like WTF IS TONKS? I knew she wouldn't just miss this battle to stay home with a baby. I feel bad for their kid being all alone, but after this book and the whole Lupin/Tonks thing, I don't really care for her at all. I didn't expect Mad-Eye to die so soon, but I definitely thought his death was fitting, just as he would like it. And all that left was his eye. And Wormtail? I knew that the fact that in PoA, Harry saved his life would come into significance, but not exactly like that. It was sort of weird and I don't understand what happened with his hand, but at least he died and Harry lived. Aw, and Colin Creevy. That was random. I was surprised how many students didn't die. 

I really love how this novel really focused on the dynamics of the trio. I know this series is called ""Harry Potter"", but I truly feel like it is equally about all three of them. I mean, what are the chances that on that first day on the train, Harry would meet these two kids that would stick by him through anything? I'm pretty sure they didn't even have any idea what they were getting into, Voldemort wasn't back yet. I know a lot of people kind of hate Ron for leaving, but I mean, with everything happening, and that damn locket around his neck half of the time, I understood why he left. And he came back! And I felt it useful for one of them to go back into the world for a bit to catch the others back up on everything because the entire time they were running around, I was like ""wtf is going on everywhere else?"" because the last thing we saw was chaos at that wedding. And when he left, I was kind of like ""great, the H/Hr shippers are going to go CRAZY"" at all this Harry/Hermione alone time, but I actually ended up LOVING them together. I never really saw their friendship, just the two of them, together and appriciated it. Maybe because I felt like Ron and Hermione had been going out since the end of book 6 and kind of knew nothing was actually going to happen between them. Very rarely anymore in literature or tv or movies or whatever is there a guy friend and his girl friend that have a strictly platonic relationship. It was refreshing. I loved Hermione's support, especially at Godric's Hollow, even though I would have liked Ron to be there too, I mean, that entire visit meant so much to Harry and Ron wasn't even there, but whatever. 

I loved that they were cut off from the world as they moved from place to place. How Hermione thought of everything. I knew they were going to do this, once they decided they would go look for the Horcruxes together, and I was like ""lol, watch them camp out in a tent!"" but I never expected them to! I dunno what I thought them to stay in. I was surprised by how easily hidden they were by just putting all those charms up. I thought they would be more easily found. Good girl, Hermione. She totally impressed me in this book. I actually like her now. Well, like, a lot. I also sort of wish that dragon in Gringotts was Norbert. That would have been ten kinds of awesome. 

Which I guess I should lead on to Ron...and Hermione, because like, AJFKJSDKFJSDLFK:SLKGSLDGSJGKFDJGKLDFJGKDJFGDF. ABOUT TIME REALLY. I think besides July being Harry Potter month, it was also R/Hr month cause like, the fifth movie totally shipped them and they were always interacting (my mom even asked me when they started going out and I was like ""lol they haven't yet!"") and I felt like they definitely were going out in this entire book. Or something. Even Harry admitted it at the wedding to Krum. ""Ah, are they together now?"" ""Er-sort of."" HEE. I love that they fell asleep holding hands, and when Hermione was being tortured, it was just HEARTBREAKING. But I was a little wtf at how sort of, <i>calm</i> Harry seemed during the whole thing. Because really...wtf? And she cried every night over him. That scene with Harry, Ron and locket was weird but I loved it. I don't get why Ron would still think Harry and Hermione were still something. I loved how Harry understood. I loved their hug. And finally the kiss! I definitely think was their first one, even though I think they both knew they loved each other before it. Harry was hilarious. I definitely think he really meant to say ""OI IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH SEVEN YEARS REALLY!"" There was just a lot going on, yeah? And duh, they got married. 

The whole Hallows thing confused me. What really was the point of it? Why being something totally random into the middle of the last novel? I really didn't like it. At first I thought it would help them finally defeat Voldie, along with the horcruxes. But...it didn't? Dumbledore only wanted them for personal gain? Like really, wtf. I feel like they were only brought in to explain the Invisibilty Cloak, but did it really need an explanation? It was a cloak...that made you invisible...that had been in Harry's family for years and Dumbledore happened to have it the night the Potters died. Case closed. No need to bring the Hallows stuff in, let alone name the novel after them. I sort of just found myself skimming over pages and pages that just talked about the Hallows. Except when Hermione told the story of them, because it was interesting to get insight into stuff about wizards pre-Hogwarts years, like what they learned about and did. They learned fairytales from their mothers, that's what. 

Speaking of parts I found myself just skimming over, all those Rita Skeeter articles, wtf! I really didn't care about Dumbledore's past, I really didn't. I don't understand what happened to his sister, I really don't. Dumbledore is dead, remember? 

I love Neville. I love Luna. I love these kids. Neville has become a leader at Hogwarts! I loved that as Harry was walking to his death, he was like the last person he talked to. Afterall, Neville was almost him. He almost would have been walking to his death, like Harry was. It was sweet. It's hard to believe everything Neville has become since book one, but I feel like these changes have been sort of gradual and justifiable, he's fighting for his parents. He didn't randomly just do a weird 180 in this book like Dudley or Kreacher. I probably loved his character development the most out of all the characters. I loveee Neville. Herbology professor! Heee! I knew ever since the first book, when he won those last 5 pts for Gryffindor for standing up to his friends, Neville would be a hero. I knew it. I know people complain that he didn't get to kill Bellatrix, but I really wouldn't have liked to see Neville kill anyone. I know he killed a snake, but it was just a horcrux, so whatever. Luna surprised me in DH. Every time we saw her, she seemed actually sort of normal, dare I say it, but still totally her same ""sane"" self at the same time. If that makes any sense. Her dad kind of pissed me off, but I see why he did it, and he seemed geninuinly guilty for doing it. But, oh Luna. I think I know fully appriciate her character. I wish she was in more books or at least mentioned her and there as a random student in the others. Her bedroom broke my heart. At first, I was like ""uhh awkward. giant faces of them!"" but the little detail of the word friends repeated over and over, linking them all together....GUH. I loved her when she was cutting the boys free in the Malfoy's basement/dungeon thing whatever. She gets things done, that girl. And LOL DEAN THOMAS? That whole thing was so random. He actually became a pretty big character. And I really liked him. When they found him tied up, I was like, great, he'll probably just try to help himself. But in the Malfoy's, he and Luna both didn't want to leave without them. And he got Dobby a little hat! So random how he's been brough up so much in the books. Any significance? I mean, he was randomly Ginny's boyfriend in HBP and in DH he was randomly...everywhere! And Ginny...I dunno. I kind of liked how she was pushed aside in this book and never really complained. I would have hated it if she tried to tag along. But she didn't. I never really disliked Harry/Ginny, but I never loved it either. But when I think about it, who else would I ever really see Harry with? Not anyone random or anything. I'm satisfied with that pairing. Draco I kind of hoped would have had more development, I felt like he actually did stuff at the end of HBP.....but he really didn't do anything. I was sort of confused as to the scene at his house when he was supposed to identify Harry. I'm pretty sure he knew it was him, and he DEFINITELY knew it was Ron and Hermione, but he wouldn't say he was sure. Was this out of fear? Or remorse for whatever reason and trying to not sell them out? I'm pretty sure it was just out of fear of misidentifying them, but I mean, look at his mom in the book. Just caring about her family. I feel like the Malfoys, or at least Narcissa and Draco. I feel like they're not really evil anymore, maybe mean and stuff, but not evil. I felt satisfied with his character sort of in the epilogue when he nodded to Harry. Afterall, Harry saved his life on many occassions. I think they still loathe each other, but they're not going to kill each other or anything. 

Randomly, I really liked Bill and Fleur's little house. The Shell Cottage. It was a nice hidaway. But I don't understand how several times during his stay, Harry noted several times he hated the sound of the ocean for whatever reason...but then the last sentence he said he'd miss it. wtf? Maybe he didn't want to leave the safety/calmness, I guess. I dunno. 

Haha, also, Potterwatch. That was so good. When I heard it was Lee Jordan hosting, I totally expected the first other two to be Fred and George but was surprised to hear it was Kingsley and Lupin! I love Potterwatch and wish we got to hear more of it! I also liked how whenever someone said Voldemort's name, the Death Eaters could like find you. I think that's why everyone was so afraid to say his name...they did the same thing the first time around. It makes sense, and I was pleasantly surprised to find an explanation for that, even though I didn't ever really think it needed to be explained, as I thought people were just dumb.

Also, something I've always thought about since book three, is how much I though history was repeating itself. Character wise, that is. I mean, the Mauraders and Lily...can be seen in Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. Harry is James in a sense, but definitely different, Sirius is Ron, Lupin is Hermione, and Lily is Ginny. I know they all have different personalities, but I mean, come on! Harry and Ginny obviously look exactly the same as James and Lily. and Ron is Harry's righthand man, they always have the laughs together, like James and Sirius. And Lupin obviously had the sense and brains like Hermione. And you know how Ron like left? And I'm sure some felt like he betrayed them, but he really hadn't when he came back? It's sort of like how Sirius was in Azkaban and Harry thought it was he who was responsible, who betrayed his parents, but he really hadn't. Yeah? And well, Ron/Hermione, and obvs, Sirius and Lupin were secret lovers, duhhh. 

I think I really lost it at the point where the Mauraders + Lily come to walk with Harry. Glorified in their younger selves. They are finally all together, so I was okay with Lupin dying. I really do see the trio in them, and just imagine, if like Harry and Ron had died, wouldn't it be right that Hermione did too? Could you ever see them apart? And wtf at the whole Snape/Lily thing. I mean, I saw it coming, since that Marauder's flashback, but really? I don't understand them and James. Did she ever really love James? Never a moment did we ever see him nice to her except when like, well, Voldie was coming in and James tried to protect her and Harry. Never once was it mentioned as to why Lily loved James. I'm also glad that she knew Snape was doing some dark stuff and didn't like that. I wouldn't have liked them to end up either. 

I knew Snape and Dumbledore planned it. Because really....I just don't even...How could he have just murdered him and then said all that stuff to Harry like ""close your mind!"" and have it all be because he was just evil? That's all I really have to say about that, it's so straightforward. 

The battle scene was just so much more than I imagined it to be. I know it would happen and everyone would fight, but just GUH. It was epic. I cannot wait to see it on film. For some reason, I always imagined it being in some field somewhere and not at Hogwarts, but now I don't really know why I never thought that. I feel like it tied every book in. The entire book did, with mentions to the Mirror of Erised and Dumbledore seeing socks in it, to the Support Diggory button!, to that flying motorcycle, it was nice. I feel like everything was important now. I loved everyone coming together to fight, it was better than I imagined. JKR just threw out names, left and right, but I loved it. I loved it when Harry looked around the RoR and realized the DA, the Order, and his old Quidditch team were all there to help him fight. LOL how random was Oliver Wood?! I hope Sean Biggerstaff comes back! And they find a way to throw in RPattz, because they did for OotP xD I loved McGonagall, I don't understand why some people thought she was evil. I think, out of all the characters, the movies have made me love her even more. And Trewlaney throwing the crystal balls! LOL And the centaurs and spiders! And the ghosts! (where was Myrtle!!?!) I loved Peeves fighting! And randomly Buckbeak was there! And the houselves! I just wish the Ford Anglia flew in and helped them! That would have been amazing. The houses united! PERCY! I knew he would come around! The Weasley deserve it...but they definitely didn't deserve loosing Fred. *grudge* They were all there for Harry. I don't know why Harry thought that he was all alone in this fight. This fight started before he was even born. At the end, when parents were there, families united, GUH. Hagrid I love. I'm glad he didn't die. I don't really know why he was randomly tied up in the forest, but I like how he was the one to carry dead!Harry back, like he carried Dumbledore at his funeral. I just loved the entire battle scene, I was an emotional mess though during it. I thought my lungs were going to pop out or my eyes from crying or something. It was great. There was always a small sense of impending doom, with deaths happening left and right, but like, I always felt hope, with everyone and everything. 

I love that the actual book ended with the trio. And the applause. It was great. The Epilogue.....I guess I didn't really care for, but I'm still glad it's there. I guess the part that just really bothered me was the ridiculous kids names and it was sort of weird seeing them all as parents, I mean 19 years was a huge leap. Harry seemed...different I dunno. I guess we haven't seen him when his life wasn't in danger or something. I know a lot of people just hate it because all it does is end shipping wars, but I feel like it was written because JKR felt that all she could give Harry in the end was a family. It was all he needed. I appreciate the epilogue in that sense. I would have liked to hear what happened to everyone else, but I guess it would have gotten too complicated, afterall there are like a billion characters. LOL and that random mention of Percy...is he like a station worker now? I dunno. I really would have liked to hear of Luna though...it was odd that 5 our of the 6 were mentioned, but not her. People think she married Draco, but really, wtf? Would Harry have just said ""Oh, look it's Draco and his wife"" and not mention it happened to be Luna? I really don't think it is. The epilogue was pretty wtf, but now that I've been done for several hours and have thought this book/series over and over, I'm glad it's there. I would have liked another chapter though, after the last...know more of everyone's reaction of this war being over. I feel like Voldie died and them, bam it was over. I feel like Harry Potter is over, but for some reason, that everything they all went through, with Voldie and the war, is not over yet because we weren't given time for it to sink in, it just jumped nineteen years and I was like whaaaat. I also thought I remembered reading a while back that JKR said the Epilogue would be written in the style of a Rita Skeeter article, like ""Where Are They Now?"" lol, what happened to that? I don't think I would have liked it, but I didn't like the Epilogue all that much anyway, so *shrug*

And so the series is done. Finished. There are still two more movies, which I can't wait to see, but it's still done. I guess it really hasn't hit me. Maybe just cause I know they're all okay and that they continue to live on. I really hope now, though, that JKR will give more interviews and actually answer stuff that wasn't resolved instead of giving mysterious looks or like maybe's. Like, oh, I dunno...why Fred?!

Reading the book was draining. Emotionally and physically. I'm glad I read it late at night, so I could go to bed right after and sleep it off. I was surprised that for about the second half of the book, probably starting with the burial of Dobby, I just sobbed. Like I've never cried like that before. My face hurt. I had to stop every chapter just to stand up and pace the room, trying to calm down a bit. But I couldn't get enough of it. It wasn't even that it was sad, because of deaths or whatever, it was just that I knew this was the end. This was the last time I'd be reading a Harry Potter book for the last time. Last time I was with these characters, at least with JK Rowling. I know I can always read the books over again, and I will, many times, but still. This is where their journey ends. Afterall, I grew up with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. And now I'm done growing up and, like them, ready to move on. To college in less than a month. It's strange. Like I once read:

<blockquote>I realized something about Harry Potter: I am Harry Potter. We all are. We all are Harry, and Hermione, and Ron, we'll always be running away from Snapes and Filches in our lives; we'll always be going to the Dumbledores for advice and protection; we'll always be fighting with the Crabbes, Goyles, and Malfoys; and ultimately, we'll all have to face our own Voldemorts. But, above all else, above the laughter, fear, anticipation, friendship, love, and happiness that Harry Potter has given me, he has given me one more lasting sentiment: What come will come. And when it does, we will face it. But until then, we can enjoy everything there is to enjoy about life, for as far away from Hogwarts as we may seem to be, we are closer than we can ever imagine.</blockquote>

And this is nothing but true.

I'm said the series is over, but I'm also imensley relieved it is done and resolved. Voldemort is dead, the trio is alive, all is at peace. I really thought it would be a lot worse. Thanks JKR. *holds up glass* To the Boy Who Lived!

And I think I just rewrote half of the book.....oh well. 

<b>EDIT:</b> Oh, and here are some quotes I liked that I jotted down as I read: 

<blockquote>""Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,"" said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron's raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, ""Oh, you know what I mean-Goyle's potion look like bogies.""

<blockquote>He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood near, his heart still beating, alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping under the snow with them.

"event","So. I'm pretty much a spoilers kind of gal, but I was trying really hard not to read anything for DH. Well.....eff that. I feel horrible now, but I don't even know if they're true. I read some for HBP before it came out and they totally weren't true, but everyone shouting SNAPE KILLED DUMBLEDORE was the only actual spoiler I got. 

I'm kind of hoping it's not all real, because I wasn't too impressed. It was fanficy. Ugh. After reading the brief overview of the novel, I was left with a feeling of complete ""wtf did that all just really happen?"" but in a bad way, as I was after OotP. Now, I kind of like that book, but I think Umbridge just threw me for a loop. And it was the first book that things that happened in that novel, were important/continuous in the rest. Not that I'm saying the other four before weren't...they just had their own stories that sort of ended. The Order continued. If that makes any sense....lol.

Ugh ugh ugh. I was so excited for this book, wanting closure and all after so many years...but now I'm like not wanting it to end. Maybe I'll actually need one to call one of those helplines :\

I can't believe a book has taken over my life so much that I wrote more about it than like a bs'd critical paper."

"event","It is July 3, which means a little less than two months before I head off to college. I was planning on somehow documenting my college adventures, posting pictures and such, a way to keep all my old friends in touch with my ""new"" life, and I was planning on making a blog for that. But, I couldn't think of a good username (that wasn't taken, I should say), and my love for icons is too great, so I decided to just use this journal for said documentation. 

Usually, this has been private or friends only, but I've decided to just make it public, and not post as many icons or whatever. So from now on, as often as I can/feel like updating, this will be filled with crazy adventures, pretty pretty pictures, and cracktastic fandom/internet lulz. Because I'm random like that.

And I always love a good laugh."

<i>List your six favorite TV shows:</i> 

1. Lost
2. Supernatural
3. One Tree Hill
4. Smallville
5. Dawson's Creek
6. Full House

<lj-cut text=""i am a tv whore"">
1. Who is your favorite character from #2? 
Dean = my one true lover. <3 

2. Who is your least favorite character from #4? 
Eckkk. Lana. That whore.

3. What would a crossover between #1 and #5 include? 
ahhhahahahah. ROTFL. XD BOONE/DAWSON. cause...they made out once. NOT KIDDING.

4. Who is your favorite ship from #6? 
ROTFL FULL HOUSE SHIPS? WTH? 

5. If you were to set one person from #3 and one person from #6 on a blind date, who would they be? 
!!!!!!!!! EW? I DK. Tim/Joey? Eww. WHY DID I JUST SAY THAT? i dk. 

6. If you could meet one person from #4 and spend the day with them, who would it be, and what would you do? 
Lex effing Luthor cause Michael effing Rosenbaum = teh sex. We would shag, drink brandy, and figure out ways to blackmail people even though he is like, the richest person in the world. bwhahahaha.

7. If you could change one thing about #2's plotline, what would you change? 
Uhh. Make Wincest a real thing. 

8. Explain a relationship between two people (not necessarily romantic) from show #5, and why you like the relationship between them. 
Jack/Jen. Oh my. I love them. They are probably the best relationship on any show I've ever watched. Their relationship in the last episode kills me dead. They are just the truest of best friends and makes the term ""soul mate"" something really concrete and possible. Joey/Dawson. pfft. wtf. Jen/Jack = bffs 4 lyfe.

9. If the lead title characters (first name in the credits) from #1 and #3 were both drowning, and you could only save one, who would it be? 
Hah. Probably Lucas. SORRY JACK. 

10. If you could change the title characters' order in the credits for #4, what order would you choose? 
Um...well, if I REALLY could change it...Lex, Chloe, Mr. Kent (even though he is dead ;_;), Mrs. Kent, Lois, Clark, Lana. HAHA SUCKS 4 YOU LANA. bwahahahaha.

11. If you were able to add a new character, any kind of character you wanted, to the storyline for #6, what would the character be like and what would their role be? 
Uh...well. The show sort of ended...like 10 yrs ago...

12. What happens in your favorite episode of show #2? 
Hmm. Well. Dean takes off his shirt a lot, fools around with this sucky girl (but fools around none the less), a big racist truck comes and kills black men, Sammy teases his big bro about his wild hormones, Dean takes off his shirt....

13. If you could kill off one of the characters of #1, who would it be and how would you do it?
KATE. Heck. Since she's such a big character, if she goes, can we have both Boone & Shannon back then, please? Wait, ANA L should die too. 

14. If you got the chance to visit the set for either show #3 or show #5, which would you choose?
Well, DC is over...so OTH. 

15. If you could date anyone from any of these shows, which show and which person?
Supernatural; Dean Winchester.

"event","Hokay. So I decided to upload some of my numerous icons, as I already had like half the set uploaded. 

3 Random from SS (because this movie was hella funny as they were all on helium)
4 Hermione from SS (because Hermione actually looked like Hermione in this movie :O)
14 R/Hr from SS (because even 11 year olds can have innuendo)
1 R/Hr from PoA (because they actually started bickering in this movie)
2 R/Hr from GoF (because........i dunno?)
3 Emma Watson/Rupert Grint at the UK GoF premiere (because Rupert is so hot and I tolerated Emma a bit, as I erased that fugly band around her head. Oh, the power of PSP)

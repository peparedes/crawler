"event","blast from the past.  wow.  i forgot i had this thing on the web.  how do 5 years pass by like that?  It's kindof fun having your history at your fingertips - yes, a different experience than dusting off cobwebs from journals past.  which i don't even feel inspired to write in very often anymore either.  hmmm.  Of course, all that private information floating around.  different feelings about it now.  maybe best to use code to code to code names for real people, places, and things, but then, do I even remember what they stand for?  and did i remember saying i didn't care originally or wanted to explore how much i do care or it does change how i write?  oh, i do care if it hurts someone or comes back to haunt me now.  but if no one knows... but also, what's the point then?  i do like the carefree poetic style i was swimming in.  i miss that outlet.  these days it's more regimented screenwriting.  gross.

so much so much so much has happened since then and still the time flew.  so preoccupied and plate so full with boys.  now i'm older and the boys aren't falling into my palm so listlessly and effortlessly easily.  and that's kinda strange, though less actively destracting.  a long and intense and drawn out 3 year relationship that changed the direction of my life in so many ways for a while, shifting off course, or can you ever really go off course?  not really of course.  

and after all the agonizing and experimenting, i just chose something, vocation wise that is.  eventually you just have to chose something, right or wrong, there's no perfect answer and decision, libras.  you get to the point where you're bored with the options or something like that.  and decide to go for it, the nuances of the it being less crucial.  

yep, animation.  and when the doubts come up, and they do, i'm so bored with having experimented and changed my mind so much before coming to that decision that i won't even entertain it.  because anyway, choosing a road leads to a whole new set of decisions and choices to make anyway, unfolding into other infinite choices, which really only appear to be infinite.  it's more like just make 2 or 3 small choices at any given time and making them soon enough until they snowballs into having to multi-task different choices on different issues simultaneously which can feel overwhelming.  

choice.

limitations.

choices.

which reminds me, i made choices for what i wanted to accomplish today and i've already strayed from them so signing off.  who would have thought today would have led me back here to 5 years ago.  WOW!

and it makes sense.  making a new blog, this time not about personal stuff at all, but a portfolio art archive.

"event","mad work mode is nearing its end.  This is a good thing and this is a tricky thing.  Tricky in that once you're out of film and haven't made good use of your contacts surrounding you every day, it's harder to get back into and if I really knew that here is where I'd want to be, I think I would have found a job to follow this one up with.  But I've been hesitating with purposeful intent, because I do totally and completely crave freetime to do my own shit for a while.  To set up a studio room and just let out some of the pentup images and ideas in my head that have been bubbling up without release or medium.  Feeling very stifled.  So many things I'm looking forward to with a little space and time - excercize, hanging with friends more often and feeling less pressured about it, having time to go outside and enjoy the summer a little bit, some purposeful undirected laziness.  Of course, I want to enforce some personal discipline also.  

I heard some directors I used to work with in New York talking about their newest release which I worked a little on - a smart docubiography ""The Kid Stays in The Picture"" about Robert Evans.  So funny to hear their voices because it felt like they were right next to me.  With each successful, famous, whatever, person behind a mega-personality and image that you meet, they're really just normal everyday people and it breaks through the veil and stigma that separates you from that.  Not that I want to be on that side, exactly, but I don't know.  I do want to become successful at something, to be known, if in select circles, for having really gone with something.  Still pretty formless.  Am still searching for my medium.  I hear Nanette and Brett on the radio talking and I remember, they're not more than 7 or 8 years older than me, but what is different about us?  They're cocky, self-assured, and ridiculously driven smart sassy people, not so incredibly nice either, grew up on the West and East Coasts.  All of teh values that aren't taught in the midwest.  that aside, people who command a room like that are the director types and mine is more of a quiet behind the scenes way.

Boys Part 3 million
More appeared somehow, thank god to take my mind off of the question about that last fucker, Why didn't he call?  God, what a waste of time.  I hate that.  I still don't get it at all and it annoys me when I remember it.  But anyway, there are 2 more suitors I'm not really into but who are great to hang out with which is my same old usual song but am working on being more upfront with things which feels good.  And I thought Chris and I weren't going to get physical again but Saturday night we did and it was actually the nicest it's been.  Of course, I was pretty drunk.  And the morning was a lot less interesting.  But then, I walked into his kitchen and instantly felt zapped by the brother of his roomate who is staying with them for the summer.  What a soft easy going sweetheart with dreamy big blue eyes and a nice little smile; just being around him, he made my heart warm.  sigh.  'course, found out Monday nite when out with a boy (not Chris) and ran into all of them and Chris (akward) that he's a youngin' and still in college.  yuck.  Don't even want to know how young he is, and won't be around for more than a month.  What's up with these ones on their way out of town?  Oh well.  Thing is, when I sit here and daydream with the setting sun light shining in on my arm, who would I want most to be by my side, to look forward to hanging out with tonight - it's definitely that boy.  Oh well.

Time to go home.  So early, what a shock."

"event","ACT I
When boys suck
Did I mention the one I unfortunately completely fell for who took me for a two day ride, whisked himself off to Alaska and called me from cold Anchorage, probably full with whisky, reminding me that he'd be back around July 3rd, and then reminding me how boys suck by never calling me when he got back, if he got back, assuming he got back.  Regardlessly, it's easy to call and say, hey listen, something's changed and sorry.  A little respect, what the hell.  

And it's easy to find casual sex with boys if you're looking for it, and it's not that me and this one even got that far, that's not the point.  The point is that it's rare to feel that electric connection that drools over into the next day for whatever reasons, spark in step, sticky sweet passion feeling in the heart melting into a new perspective in your days.  Hummingbird hummingbird.  Some sortof something fling to look forward to with a happy jump and quiver inside, and then bam, no delivery whatsoever.  No expectation until he created one (oh I'll let you know when I'll be back.  Let's go on a roadtrip.  Can't wait to see you again) bullsheeeeit.  What's up with that?  All of that extraneous fat around the edges, empty embellishment, dishonest act in retrospect, argh.  Don't get it.

Called it friends with friendboy from a previous entry I'm sure.  Is better that way and mutual.  Am sick of this boy dating stuff for a while.  And no more younger ones either, not that age accounts for maturity, but still.

ACT II
Closer heart to choosing the direction of my life

Dear Universe, which is it?
a)Film Editing
b)Production Design/Art Department for film
c)Industrial Design
d)Fine Art/Sculpture

Which is it already?

Lots of visualization and dreaming and writing and meditating and August 15th as a deadline for knowing more clearly and focusing and looking for omens and auspiscious signs - the constant searching and seeking and asking at the forefront right behind my skin or right in front of my eyes, whereever it exists, asking and wondering an' prayin'

And anyway, a little voice in my soul says, art art art, first, and the rest will follow but it needs to support that as the greater aim and focus, as the purest emphasis, and let the rest fall into place as oppossed to the opposite which is trying to secure a profitable livable living instead of living it first and then letting happen and figuring out.  Trying to set the practice first as creative seeking, creative making.  And then the practical support system, which may or may not include the applied arts.  Life is short.  HOw many more years walk on this earth do I have?  50?  60? less.  I don't fuckin' know.  And how do I want to spend that short little speck.  Given what I have been given, now what?  How can I live according to my highest personal standards of integrity, knowing that I've really given it the best and followed my heart.  Making a choice, narrowing things down, somehow feels like it opens them up to.  Now that I have chosen d), I feel free to choose the others in addition.  In a way it feels like choosing who you are, how you define your value system.  And that is so important to me.  a) b) and c), in and of themselves alone, feel like a sell out, a cheap way out, a cop out, but combined with d) as a pure heart stemming outward, they feel like a natural expression and means of substence.

I mean, really.  It's almost 11pm and I'm STILL at work, heading towards a 15, 16 hour day.  BUllshit - nothing is worth that unless it's your own dream.  When you have alternatives, take them."

Dear friend I'm sleeping with and not incredibly into but enjoy his company, just very neutral chemistry, we discussed and are on the same page, or so he says.

Frankness is good.  But it can't last too long before getting messing.  And we both know this, too.  Until one of us crossing over to the darkside of caring.

"event","At least as land.  It's overcast, white purple blue and thick sky, cool refreshing but still hanging air, and I like it, before the sky opens up and pounds down heat through my pores, when driving, driving, driving all day long through Los Angeles - no airconditioning, a sauna mobile, pounding, but at least lots of music and freedom from the office.  And I already know this city pretty damn well.  Maybe everyone should P.A. as an introduction to a new city.

Uhhh, or not.

Alright, I keep getting distracted by various glorious office errands and a beautiful sounding telephone.

A lightbulb did go off earlier this week.  Why the HELL don't you bring your damn little powerbook to the office, so that instead of reading trashy magazines and drawing (well, drawing is good) in downtime, you can look busier by being on-line, and it's fast.  What glory.  

A while later.  2nd cup of 1/2 drunken coldish coffee.  Blech.

Am praying a lot, doing this new dot visualization technicque via my new Ayurvedic health/lifestyle plan, and good old fashioned praying and I want to know in a more committed way what work path plan I am going to follow.  Interviewed for a tv show to do graphics yesterday, Alias.  Cheesy ass show, I don't know.  It's hard to sign on the line for 10 months.  Doesn't feel quite right, but then what does?  It's hard to know when to hold out and when to take it up - I guess that applies to everything.  A gamble.  Decision making has always been stressful for me - blame it on the rain (Milli Vanilli of course) or blame it on the moon in Libra.  I'll take Libra.  God, that makes me such a mellow easy-going Scorpio though, now don't it?

The various brances feel like blindly following this film thing and playing between editorial and art department until one feels more right, taking jobs and learning in the world, just full force towards an editor or Production designer.  Both of which I'd be good at, is not incredibly hard - you just need to work your ass off, but is an ongoing bullshit grind of working your life away.  Of course, every a) b) or c) for me possibility is a grind.  Oye.  When really I'd be a happy girl to work less.  I'm not sold on selling your soul and sanity completely.  What's really worth that?  Come on.

Then there's this new industrial design wing.  ID gives me that same pinching inside - it's kinda cool and something I could definitely do, a nice work environment, challenging and a creative problem solving process, buttttt... and there's always one, is it really worth giving your life away to design more shit for people to buy?  I mean, yeah, maybe it'll be better, easier to use, sexier stuff, but when it comes down to it, don't we have enough already?  Not that it's a bad job - I don't know.  Maybe it's thinking too much about it in a philosophical way.  That always leads me to, what if I had stayed at the zen monastery?  Is all this bullshit really worth being more of a fuck up for?  I left because I wanted to follow a creative art path.  But was the compromise to be crazier, more stressed out, less realized, in the grind, etc. really worth it?  I guess I have had to know.  I wouldn't be satisfied not knowing.  And it's all much more ""interesting"" to be in the world - it's just that all of the shit I get caught up in, at the same time, because I intuitively know it's not real, I don't exactly believe it, and yet I still have to play it, and by process of being immersed in the grind, do end up living my life as if it is real.  Deep down, I know I sell myself for trivial things and most of my thoughts are preoccupied by things which have absolutely nothing to do with my true inner nature - wanting to look better, be better, work harder, be somebody, accomplish something cool, be respected, be entertained, completely completely future oriented.  sigh.  All of these preoccupations 99% of the day.  It always comes back to, is the tradeoff worth it?  Is it truly for some greater good?  It can be stressful to keep a moral perspective most of the time, this ongoing dilemma.  But I don't know.  Am always keeping ""right livlihood"" in the back of my thinking.  Which is a broad topic.  Can mean so much.  On the one hand, ""right Livlihood"" happens, is right, no matter what you're doing, if you are living/being ""rightly"" whatever that means for you.  The activity comes secondarily.  You could be ""doing good"" in a really bad way, and that would mean nothing.  At the same time, certain activities definitely work more towards the greater good than others.

So, there's the film thing, which on the one hand, is kindof interesting.  I am often very moved by films, love the story.  But what do you do when it takes a long time and is no guarantee that you'll work on something interesting.

blah blah blah.

blah blah blah 

blah

Oh and of course there is the overall greater umbrella that all of these experiences are leading up to a greater good of fine art, moving towards a better craft in sculpture, incorporating what I've learned about installation from production work, or about desinging from ID, all of it moving towards a better education and foundation for my own work and possibly teaching for money.  That feels good in my heart.  In which case just going with all these things is good.  Oh I don't know."

"event","Woke Up this morning to Los Angeles rain, smothered in a warm RIT dye comfortor and pink flannel sheets.  Lush.  Rain so tiny, invisible fresh in Green Ivy hill behind dark purple lace curtain, revealed through green leaf convulsing dance and pulsing rooftop tap, for once blinding out the morning ritual upstairs, footsteps like wooden clogs, a coffeebean grinder, squeaky shower faucet.  

A soft horn from roomate's jazz CD in this blank dark living room, now, save blinding snow screen.  The phasemaster, Little brother there, turned me on to live journal.  Well okay, second one to mention it, first to remind me again.  There's always so many things I should be doing.  Preparing for some car design presentation tomorrow.  Ha!  Can't even say car design.  Presentation of myself.  The teacher asks, ""When you die, what do you want your legacy to be?"" and my roomate laughed.  ""You just tell 'zem - when I die, I want to be known as a great latin lover"" and then you tell them exactly why, and how it is that you came to car design through cumming, and how the engine turns you just so on.  And after you've worked the whole class around, you say simplely and humbly.  ""And that is why ... I want to draw cars"".  

Oh right, don't take myself too seriously.  But comeon people, we're talking about cars here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Right, where was I?  

Medicine cards provided for an energetic release and transformation today.  Amazing what the occult can do as far as directing fresh newness into your experience.  At first, I asked about this guy I recently met who is a very smart, funny musician boy I brought to my lair almost a week ago and haven't hung out with since (he went out of town) and I am unsure about him, that he's quite 'right', that I should consider putting the effort into that, that a female Scorpio such as myself should consider a Leo.  Any possible doubt, I've considered it.  But mostly, I didn't feel particularly turned on by him, and my pattern is to generally date guys I'd just as easily be only friends with.  I keep vowing not to do that and still it continues.  Sure, you can grow into liking someone more, trying to cultivate more passion, but can you really cultivate chemistry???  And is it worth trying?  Not that he's UNattractive.  Just that I felt ambivalent.  Not particularly encouraging.

Wow, what the fuck was I starting to say?  Anyway, I asked the I Ching about him and got nothing but negativity.  #23 Detoriation/Splitting Apart TWICE and #44 Temptation with a pretty negative changing line.  The Medicine cards were not having it (think ghetto fab, ""I'm not haaaavvvin' it"" fingertip shake), meaning, if they were going to give me guidance, it wasn't going to be about the usual boycrazy 'blah blah blah blah blah blah blah'.  The advice for the day was HUMMINGBIRD which is absolutely gorgeous.  Instantly I felt an infusion of love and appreciation.  Cards are not some kindof fix in general, but today I realized absolutely that that genuine love and joy and sense of abundant open heart were completely missing in this grey vacant driedup swamp land field I had created.  I've felt chained to my little cage apartment, like I'm not allowed to leave until I either keep doing productive shit (drawing, writing, meditation, making job lead calls, sending resumes, reading, or writing endlessly in my journal blah blah blah like I'm going to find the answer of what I should be doing with my life).  And this gorgeous stormy blueeyed fluffy clouded day was just screaming to be eaten.  My career could wait for a day well spent in play.  (Okay it's still waiting).  So to Griffith Park for a hike, met up with this older lady on a trail, Genevieve (fuckin' gorgeous name, reminds me of that DEATHCAB FOR CUTIE Photoalbum song) with a tabby cat named Mandy.  And then to a yoga class, this great teacher nearby.  Word.  

Body and heart buzz.  ahhhhhhh.

And still, what can I do that's productive.  I still think about it in varying degrees of obsession.  Where's my mark and what is it and how is it and who is it?  Oh, right, and of course, why is it?  Sculpture, Industrial Design (fuck, more school?? Don't know if I can do it), film editing, film art department.  Why are there a million things and for a million different reasons?  Have done so many things have not really gone deep into anyof them.  Which is right?  BLAHHHHHHHHH.

I guess I""m getting used to writing up here LJ style though I can't imagine this ever replacing ye old faithful Mead black marble composition journal in edition of 50 or however many are lying around.  On another note, these journals finally feel like they have an ounce of usefullness.

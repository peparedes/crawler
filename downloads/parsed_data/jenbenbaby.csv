<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Im a bit lost at the moment, first my dog dying now this, its like a big part of me is missing.&nbsp; Was considering using my inheritance to get away for a few days and clear my head, maybe next month.&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Its strange, i didnt realise i mothered my doggie so much, now im feeling all maternal, might go and get a bunny rabbit, ive always wanted one but i dont know if i should get a pet so soon after suzi.&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>

<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>The life of Jen is slowly getting back to normal.&nbsp; Thats me been back at work for a week and settling in well.&nbsp; Topher and my parents are back from their holidays, which is great cos i have some company at home etc.&nbsp; Also quite skint, which is normal for me.&nbsp; Still upset about Suzi but im keeping my chin up.&nbsp; My mum said my Granda wasnt well at all yesterday so he's getting the doctor out today, fingers-crossed its nothing serious!</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Had a nice weekend.&nbsp; Saturday Topher and i went to Kilmarnock for lunch, then went a walk in the park.&nbsp; Afterwards we went to visit his parents and to see the sheep (its almost lambing season).&nbsp; Then we got a take-away, got ready and went bowling with my friends Alana and Tony in Salcoats.&nbsp; Was a bit tipsy.&nbsp; Yesterday didnt get up til 12ish, sat around in our PJ's watching movies and eating sweets etc.&nbsp; So i seen bambi for the first time, thumpers so cute!&nbsp; And the baby thumpers!&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>

<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4><EM>On Wednesday i was woken up by my wee dog howling in pain, ran down the stairs and she had tried to walk but collapsed.&nbsp; She still wouldnt eat or drink and was getting alot worse so we had no choice but to take her to the vet.&nbsp; Topher took my brother and i to the vet and i was in pieces, cuddling my suzi in her wee blanket, was inconsolable.&nbsp; The vet said that he could operate to try and un-block her bowel and that may help her but if all didnt go well he would have to put her down.&nbsp; We were willing to try anything.&nbsp; Said goodbye and left.&nbsp; We were to phone at 4.30...2 1/2 hours later.&nbsp; So i went to Irvine with Topher and Alan went home.&nbsp; I was worried sick the whole time but Topher managed to cheer me up a bit.&nbsp; Then i phoned the vet and he told me he had found a tumour blocking her bowels and that he had to put her down.&nbsp; So she had cancer and according to the vet she had ahd it for a long time.&nbsp; I was to go and pay the vet and get her blanket when i got home.&nbsp; Went and seen my brother, he was a wreck, mum and dad had phoned and he told them.&nbsp; I went up to pay the vet and i got her blanket back...thats when it really sunk in.&nbsp; I cried my heart out all the way home and even Topher was crying.&nbsp; I know it was the best for her and im glad she isnt in pain anymore.&nbsp; I just feel like ive lost a limb, she was family, not just a dog to me and i will miss her so much.&nbsp; Some people dont realise just home much a pet can mean to you.&nbsp; She was 14 so i had had her since i was 7 years old, my brother cant remember not having her.&nbsp; </EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4><EM>Topher went to Prague on Thursday morning at 3am, comes home today.&nbsp; Ive really missed him and im so happy he is home.&nbsp; Mum and dad come back tomorrow from Las Vegas so im gonna be at home when they get in to give them their anniversary gifts and mothers day present for my mum.</EM></FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#663366 size=4><EM>I awoke to a text message from my brother to say that my doggie was really unwell and asked if id go home asap.&nbsp; Mum and Dad went to Las Vegas today, and alan had to go to work so she was home alone.&nbsp; I quickly got ready and came straight home, thinking the worst.&nbsp; I got in and she was staggering around, so i picked her up, sat down and cried my heart out.&nbsp; Took her outside and she staggered around a bit, was struggling to do the toilet.&nbsp; Brought her in and she went to her bed.&nbsp; After that she deteriorated.&nbsp; Her back legs were weak, then she couldnt move them, or herself, wouldnt eat anything even her favourite dairy milk chocolate.&nbsp; Alan came home from work and we took her to the vets, had resigned ourselves to the fact that she might not see the end of the day, which was very hard for us.&nbsp; The vet said that she has a very bad bowel infection and was dehydrated along with having bronchitus due to her old age.&nbsp; So she got a few jags, some pills and soluable stuff for her water to hydrate her.&nbsp; If she doesnt improve by wednesday or thursday we have to take her back to be put down.&nbsp; Im so gutted, never loved anything as much as i love her and i dont want to loose her.&nbsp; She is making some progress, has had a wee wander around with assistance so fingers crossed she will pull through.&nbsp; Mum and Dad know she was ill but dont know she is&nbsp;still alive&nbsp;cos they havent phoned me yet.&nbsp; </EM></FONT></P>

<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Its almost Christmas, got a feeling that this Christmas is going to be the best i have had for a long time!&nbsp; Spent a small fortune on presents, but im happy about it.&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Im loaded with the cold, have been all weekend, its snot fair!&nbsp; hehe.&nbsp; Backs been quite sore and ice is starting to freak me out but apart from that im fine!&nbsp; Went and met Jade on Friday for lunch, nobody else could make it, shes a wee gem!&nbsp; Then went shopping and got some clothes.&nbsp; Survived James' 30th birthday dinner at my boyfriends parents house that night, was quite good, didnt talk or look at Fraser really, was quite hard but i think i'll get used to it!&nbsp; Had a nice weekend, went to Ayr shopping, got a few things, went for a chinese take-away and had a night in with Topher, although, he wasnt feeling too well after the take-away, feel bad cos i went on and on about this chinese being amazing etc.&nbsp; Then yesterday my sister and her boyfriend came to visit us from essex, was great to see them!&nbsp; Will see them in less than two weeks when me and Topher go down&nbsp;but i hadn't seen dan for a year and a half and hadnt seen Joanna since my 21st in June so it was nice.&nbsp; Then Topher and i went to see A Series Of Unfortunate Events, was amazing!&nbsp; Back started getting sore towards the end tho.&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Im quite happy, realised a few things this weekend.&nbsp; Im really happy with my relationship with Topher, we get along so well and ive never met anyone like him, im still holding back slightly, for good reason though, dont want to scare him off amongst other things.&nbsp; Almost 6 months now, time flys by when you are having fun!&nbsp; I dont know if he thinks things are moving too fast or too slow or what, but i think that conversation should not be had at this moment, could ruin things.&nbsp; Im also happy with life at home at the moment, maybe people are being nice cos Christmas is coming up, but im liking it.&nbsp; And ive decided theres no point in worrying about friends too, as long as im sure im making the effort and being a good friend how they feel is up to them.&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Going to see the Borrowers play on the 30th of December with Topher and his neice and nephew, should be good fun!&nbsp; I cant wait, love pantomimes!&nbsp; I know they may not know what the borrowers are but i loved the programme when i was younger, think Topher liked it too.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Take care, will try to update before christmas.</FONT></EM></P>

"event","Well folks,  I had a fabulous action packed weekend as predicted!  I went to see Bridget Jones on Friday night with Kez and Fraz, was awesome!  On saturday my lovely boyfriend (topher) and i went to the transport police station to look at pictures of possible attackers (long story), spent the day together then he had a party at his house that night which was quite fun, including one of his cousins mates going on about how he pisses in corners of rooms and on unusual objects such as TV's when hes drunk, was hilarious. On sunday we went to his parents farm where i had my first tractor experience, was good fun!  Then had a quiet night in.  

Lets see, im still a happy bunny, ok so im at work and its Monday but i remain happy.  Moving my bedroom around tonight, should be delightful!  I'll probably regret it soon after starting it!  

Bye for now xxx"

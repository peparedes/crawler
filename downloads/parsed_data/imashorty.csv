ITS MY BATTLE WOUND LOL, I BATTLED THE SNOW. YAY! god i love the snow, i love skiing, the mountains were so beautiful, there was only one thing that could have made my trip better....anyways it was fun...i gots sunburnt, its really not that bad, except the very tip of my nose, not my whole nose, just the tip is burnt, i look like rudolf. but yea im so tired, and i have the biggest crick in my neck EVER. lol i think its from sleeping on the bus, in a weird position. but yea, im watching some gay movie with my dad lol some british people on heroin lol. its weird lol, but yea, umm i guess ill go, i dont really have anything else to talk about, so yea, adios


i look at myself,
and tried to find,
what im missing,
whats inside.

i look at myself,
and try to see,
what isnt there,
inside of me.

i look at myself,
and i finally see,
whats missing,
whats missing is you and me.

i look at myself,
and i want to cry,
for what i did,
to make you die.
like a tree,
whos bark is brown,
but once you cut the surface,
its black, 
sad, like a frown.

i look at myself,
and i dont want to see,
the inside of me,
because it hurts you,
it hurts me,
and i know that nothing can be the way it use to be.
because you dont love me.

i look at myself,
for the last time,
i dont want to see someone have,
what use to be mine.
its not that im jealouse,
im just mad at myself,
for giving up love itself.
because finally hes over me,
and loves someone else."

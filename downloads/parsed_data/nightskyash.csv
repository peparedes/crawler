We watched THX 1138. It was not even close to...anything... i have ever seen.... except maybe Pi. It was CREEPY. As much as I hate to admit to being optimistic, I do not believe that humanity will ever become as cold and detached as portrayed in the film. Mr. Lucas is a genius, but I think he took tooooo much acid in the 70's... in fact, he may have written that entire film while tripping. It is THAT out there. 

Mmmm hmmm.

So, if you have a lot of time to kill, rent it. If you want to know what I felt like that infamous wednesday evening, rent it. If you want to spend the next two hours trying to erase the film from your memory because it is just that weird, rent it.

<h2>OH MAN!!! THE COLORS!!! THE COLORS!!!!</h2>

Lemme just say, Tony, you were 110% right... Star Wars does in fact kick ass.

THX1138 looks frighteningly good. Can't wait to watch that tomorrow night.

And it was a nice surprise to see a bunch of people i knew at the incubus concert.... and then of course everyone went nuts when they came on stage. those incubus fans are CRACK HEADS. Not even in the deftones/godsmack concert were there that many retards being... retards. Some dumb bitch jabbed me in the chest with her elbow when i was trying to get desi out of the crowd and i started having an asthma attack... i had like 4 people trying to help me get over the railing while this one dumb bitch was pulling on my left arm. she swore everyone was trying to get in front her so he kept pushing everyone away when they were trying to get this poor chic that passed out over the railing. i swear if i ever meet that girl again i am going to punch her face in..etc... HEAR THAT, YOU UGLY BITCH? YOUR DEAD.

I just realized I have no idea when midterms are. I'm going to go figure that out and put it into my old fashioned paper-and-pen organizer.... heh... makes me think of the organizer Frylock gave to Master Shake when he claimed to have lost his PDA.

And that last sentence makes me look like a crack head because I forget that not everyone is obsest with ATHF like meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

We can send a robot to Mars, but we can't stop a damn hurricane from hitting us. It is a huge lack of substance. It is a ball of fricken wind and rain. WHAT THE FUCK?!?!, WEATHER PEOPLE.

Yeah. I'm pissed. They cancelled Ozzfest because of lovely Frances.

And now they are shoving everyone from Monroe County into our school somewhere. Get this: WE have classes still. THEY are scared shitless about their homes and lives and stuff, while WE are dividing polynomials, which we will most definitly use in real life.

If you are going to vote for Bush, you are ""one of those idiots"" that everyone keeps referring to. So next time you overhear people talking about the idiots in our country, feel special... youre one of them. This guys big campaign is to do all this stuff he is promissing this time 'round like ""Hey guys, i think i gittin' the hang of this here thingamabobberdoodle...STRATEGERY!""

"event","I knew that if I waited things out long enought that this would happen. I also waited it out because I am afraid of where it will lead. Though an intelligent person would not let anything like this scare them, I am taking the news from a whole different, non-wordly, jaded view. I am the child of two open-mided individuals who stood their ground in an era where today's businesses were kicking and screaming to be born and war was as mad and unorganized as it is today. We are the new generation of youth fighting against war, dirty polotics, and ""the man"" taking over. We have unbridled hatred towards anything any anyone who is trying to suck us into their 'system'... I'll be damned if I ever become a  working drone in this sucubus of a beehive they call 'the real world'! With all that said: 

Last year I got to help out with a big client at the accounting office I work at. Basically its a gathering in Tallahassee called Miami Dade Days, and the client of ours handles all the organization of the event. Last year, they moved their office into our back office (initially the confrence room for clients and my work area).

This year, Phyllis, our secretary (almost a mother to me... i love her), threw in my name and mentioned how I handled everything well last year and since the girl I did it with last year is going back to school to be a teacher, the position is still open. Bingo. Time, Effort, Dedication..all to Gomes&Co... FINALLY... they have been proven to really pay off. But is this what I wanted?

Yes, that would indeed make me an EVENT PLANNER. Yes that would indeed make me mucho MONEY. And yes that would be a VERY good thing to have on my application. Not to mention all the hands on time I get with MS Access and Database configuration (still a computer nerd at heart...).

And best of all, yes, that means <u>connections</u> up the wazoo once I get to actually go to the whole meeting up in Tallahassee. Politicians, Lawyers, CPAs, Doctors, Real Estate Gurus.... man... 

If this really goes the way I have it set in my head (which is actually about 90% likely to happen), then I will be able to get a big step ahead into this big world of madness they call, the REAL WORLD.... eek.

Yes, this means more meditation more often for ashligh, because it is going to take days upon days to get used to being part of the crazy system instead of a girl trying to keep from being sucked into the system. I will be surrounded by business-types all the time if I get this client's account. It is the very essence of what I stand against, but have accepted to be a (hopefully) livable environment until I can make things better for myself.

Damn. I cannot believe I'm growing up. I just had a job offer that most people i have classes with would DIE for and lick anybodies boots to get. I am so fortunate to have connections already through family and friends, that I really don't deserve this, but I know everyone that reads that or hears me day it will slap me because I have owrked in that office for two years and have been given so many good things along the way. Now, I have an employee number (a bigger thing than it seems, you know what I mean if your in just about any business... its called job security), and I am on a first name basis with some clients and even though I have been recently working one or two days a week filing and working on projects that require more attention than the other have time for (i.e. - dirty work), it is paying off really well. I am happy.


I received this surprise news after having a great dream about doing interior design and how Henri and I are moving to the west kendall area in like a year (that part is real). Ever since we agreed on that, I have been all giddy. I finally get to decorate our own 'place'... AND IT ISN'T IN OL' BFE. If you are female you know what this means. If you are male you also know what this means (heh heh... Tony<3). It will be a fricken cool as hell to decorate a new apartment from scratch. Unlike other girls I happen to know, I will not be placing any plastic food in a pretty bowl on ANY surface in the house. Rules are as folows for decorating like a REAL person.... 

(1)Plastic fruit, meat, people... NONE of that. 
(2) NO FLOWERS ALLOWED... ANYWHERE! NO FLOWER PRINTS... ANYWHERE!!
(3) Nothing pink, unless it needs to be for some strange purpose. In all incidents it is IMPORTANT to at least TRY and replace it with blue or purple. 
(4) No TRINKETS or dolls or bears or filly lace things with pastel colors are to touch anything in the house... Only LEGOS toys we have made, and Vipers, GTO's, and other neato model cars Henri built will be up.
(5)Posters - No limitations there.... Musical taste must be reflected all around.
(6)Colors - NOTHING CLOSE TO WHITE. Anything else is fine. EXCEPT PINK. Whew... almost left a big loophole in there....
(7)Towels, dishes, stuff like that, etc. - nothing pink... if at all possible, black, blues or deep reds.
(8)Some other rules will be added as visit various peoples apartments and witnedd the pastel mayhem and evil fluffy destruction that takes place when a girl moves in... heh... man, I'm a real bitch....

***And the most important rule of all: I have witnessed this happening over and over to all my male friends... its so sad...  Just because you love a man does not mean you need to smear roses and pink pastel fuzzy things all over their living space. It is DISGUSTING, and even worse, it lacks mutual input into your environment... as small as this is, it causes a rippling effect... I know only from talking about it to guy friends (which is all I have except for desi, really) and hearing their ideas on how the place would look...and then hearing how they kinda wish they had more say in those oh-so-lovely pink and white shell soaps in the bathroom, and the pink towels, and the fuzzy pink toilet seat cover....So so sad. You can really put a damper on (most importantly) sex, communication (yeah, important), love, energy, and mood when you dont take into account how much times you spend in a space together like that. When your environment sucks, you start to feel it. Ugh. Hence... a warning to the female pursuasion: Please THINK before you ever put anything up that resembles what your/his mother has up in her house. Men wouldn't move out from their mother's houses if they liked the way things ran there. Just THINK about it for a sec before picking the paradise flower shower curtains.

<small>Future Plans from this little rant: Write a book on how to please your guy with little things like decor and position. There are a billion books for guys out there on how to make their women happy. My man makes me happy every moment he's alive, and I think that there must be a few others out there like me who want some simple ideas to brighten up their man's smile and hear them happily say ""Oh Wow. Thank You, I love You."" and actually mean it.</small>

That is all, back to my cat napping.

I'm happy (more than evAr). I'm adjusted (and comfortable in my won skin, early perhaps). I'm growing up fast (after the new year, I wont be considered a ""teen"" anymore... I'll be twenty...(o.-).

Yay for ash... I think.


<small> i still cant help myself when I think about all that... I cant help but cry, because I know in moving forward into these things means i am losing part of me that has to be left behind, or at best, hidden. Any advice for mid-mid-life crisis would be appreciated. I need to hear that it is possible to keep your inner child and imaginiation alive in a harsh, unnerving place like the business world. Its new and bright and harsh and I feel... so small.</small>"

I just got back from NC last night at 11pm. What a flight. NO ONE EVER FLY AIRTRAN AIRWAYS UNLESS YOU WANT TO DIEEEEEE! The people flying the plane land like they are flying a paper airplane and the  flight attendants are bitchy and rude.

But yeah.


I learned how to meditate while 2 miles in the air on the peak of ""Tater Hill"" (i know... tater hill... heh), the mtn that my godfather lives on. Its cool cuz everyone that lives along the moutain side is either from florida or they lived here for a while so they aren't like hill billying around and they aren't dull. This one guy kurt is a veteran psychonaut.... his stories are funny as fuck.

I am pretty sure that in August/November we will be doing a road trip up there. WE meaning devo, dez, henri and myself. I am so sure that devo will appreciate the scenery if nothing else. And my bf, well, I dunno about him LOVING the idea, but he wants to go.

Anywho. I have to go to the Fed Ex office on NW 107 ave and NW 25 street to pick up some presents.... 

maybe i'll update some more later while I'm at devo's.

peace and dill pickles to all.


P.S. - I have chappelle-itis... I can't stop quoting like every ep of his show.

This is a home-written story.<br>
<br>
<lj-cut text=""Mykell almost gets saved""><br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/dce89932.jpg""><br>
There once was boy name Mykell Anusny Giglioso. He became lost in the
woods without anything, not even a watch. He knew he was late for
dinner though, very late.<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/25d04561.jpg""><br>
""Help me! Help me!"" he yelled. Eventually he became so bored, he amused
himself by waving his hand around. It was fun for a couple minutes,
then he remembered how lost he was.<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/a37ada8a.jpg""><br>
All of a sudden, a girl appeared! ""I'm going to kill you,"" she said casually.<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/35c58281.jpg""><br>
""What!"" he exclaimed, ""please don't.""<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/f4520ae3.jpg""><br>
Just in time, Capton Cannibis flew down from the trees to help Mykell.<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/e29fc509.jpg""><br>
He leaped down and tryed to help Mykell, but the girl beat him. <br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/4dd87dc0.jpg""><br>
The girl brought Capton Cannibis to her friend's house to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">take care of him</span>.<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/2be53bd7.jpg""><br>
They raped him...<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/f6ae7537.jpg""><br>
And then hung him.<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/cadcf529.jpg""><br>
Mykell was forced to watch the superhero die in a breathing struggle. It saddened him ever so.<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/410e5a76.jpg""><br>
Capton Cannibis was near his death, when he lept off into thin air in escape.<br>
<br>
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/hethre/4660537c.jpg""><br>
He flew off into the sky and lived. The girls tryed to find him, but never did.<br>
<br>
THE END<br>

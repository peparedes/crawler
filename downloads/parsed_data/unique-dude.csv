"event","so, im back after my 2-month lapse. I have no idea why.

It seems as if my life travels in cycles. the continuous wheel, rolling uncontrollobly (my spelling sux). but i think i can break the wheel in half or somthing to make it stop rolling and just experience the better part of it. 

eventually ill look back on these entrys and learn something i hadnt known before

but, alas much has happened since i posted last. was a long time ago (-in retrospect- its funny that i guage the passage of time by my stages of mral thinking and music listning lol)

-met 2 dudes that listen to metal, rowen with a guitar and DJ with a bass, after jammin with this dude joey (who also plays bass) for a while but wasnt any good we kinda left him. We are now VULCAN SUNRISE and we dont have a drummer yet =D

-started listining to their scandinavian metal music. This band called opeth is now my favorite band. This is the first time I ever found music i could REALLY get along with. They are accually popular right now (thats right, current music is accually good) They're extremely prgressive and thats what i like.

-started listing to metal again en mass. metal and vinly. King Crimson is also extremly good. its a progressive 60's 70's band that was very influential to metal and modern rock. got 3 of their records. also got another Donovan Leich record. I prefer him over all 60's pop. notice POP. doors didnt make the cut.

-same time ive been thinking very much like a cynic. At fst I thought for a long time that possibly the baby is the happiest thing because it has nothing to make it sad. Then i reasoned that it didnt have anything to make it happy either and brainscans show that they are never to happy or sad because they dont have enough organized brain cells to have the emotion. 

-Then i  started thinking that maybe just simplicity is bliss. f you dont have conplicated things to worry about you can have more free-time, peace of mind, and freedom to do whatever you want.

-I determined that that was right and white man was faulted and the American indians had it right (the peaceful ones of course)
Newton and the scientists were the ones to blame as they made the science and that greedy or ""industrious"" ones took advantage of it, making things complicated.

-but then i thought that to me, the greatest asset would be free-time. an indian's work took up most of the day, hence needing machines in the first place. 

- then i was confused, torn between simplicity and free-time

- i then reasoned that machines and science and those things are good but only as long as they are used to minimize the amount of work done, not increase the profit. (that profit makes america) I was then satisfied and accepted america as faulted at its core value, using technology to gain more money instead of more time. time is worth more than money to me.

-i then ventured on reading WALDEN by Thoreau. I saw real individualism and torn from what i thought was right and my sense of logic, i questioned my ways of expressing myself, my clothes in general.

-now im going though the phase of doing and saying whatever i feel like on a regular basis.

-i read brave new world and now im questioning being ""enlightened"", trying to figure out if that really entais happiness. READ BRAVE NEW WORLD 

life

-if you got it this far, thanks for the attention and sorry for the grammatica spelling and sentance structure mistakes i must have made (even in this sentance!)."

"event","so, uh, at my dads place this week. I already wrote all of taday's news about my car and i dont feel like going back into it. 
Saw ""Fun with Dick and Jane"", it was really funny, i thought. i like it alot, ut my sister and dad dint car for it too much. thats right, i went with my sister and dad. im so cool, im not cool. take that hipsters. 
yea, so uh, got this stevie ray vaughan cd. i got it and led zeppelin II at the same time. man stievie is good at guitar, im definatly going to have to learn one of his solos. for those of you who havent heard of the kid, he was an 80's blues man. real good at guitar. listen to anything off his ""Texas flood"" album. great stuff there. i just hope my radio magically fixes itself and i can listen to it on the way home from suburbia. 
cmon, magic powers, majic powers, im concentrating.....fix dammit......it better fix itself. i think it will be fixed. yknow, they dont sell the things on ebay. if i break it again i may have to go to a salvage yard to find another one. i went to one in dallas with my uncle. it was fune, piles of cars and BIG spiders. hoo hoo hoo, if it hadent of been so hot and if the spiders wouldnt have been so damn ferocious i could have spent many a day there. (supposing i had food and water). <----some one tell me if im using the right sentace syntax here, ive been real confused over it. does the pharagraph go before the period in the origional sentace, or in its own sentace, if so, does it have a period in that case? maybe i should just write P.S., but then again this isnt mail. in that case shouldnt i write B.S. (blog script), not, some bozo would think im saying bull shit...

well, thats enough for being over-anylitical, i gotta practice playing purple haze by the legendary Jimi Hendrix."

its kind of nifty that a whole chunk of the people on the eartg can elebrate the same thing at the same time, you know? i mean seriously, that would take alot of planning, i guess it did. must hae been pretty hard.
but people will do almost anything for money, as bad and ironic as it seems, cristmas time makes people rich, look at that movie ""the santa clause"" prolly made tim allen a few million er so. its not like thats a problem. its probobly a good thing. as long as the innocent get what they deserve im happy. 
I gave to the salvation army on 2 occasions this ""holiday"" season. the dude in the suit looked real happy, it made me feel good about me too. i was with madison at one of these events and she said my parents ""brought me up the right way"". i guess so, but i prolly gave more money then both of them combined. 
its a funny world out there. i wonder if its real? are you real? im pretty sure i am. or else i wouldnt be writing this, or would i? maybe writing this makes me more real. you tell me.
i guess it doesnt really matter if im real or not. im happy and thats all that matters to me. yea that covers it. i wonder if im supposed to be more happy tha i am now? is happiness a a point or just a range of increasing intensity? like the electromagnetic spectrum. got to go now bye"

i -really- like physics, i have no idea why, i like it more than pre-cal. its just challenging enough and i get it just well  enough, it's based on logic and it can be applied to the world. its GREAT. ive been getting scientific american lately in the mail and i was takin notes on it in some spare time in class. this girl was like ""what class is that for?"" i was like ""me"" and she didnt get it the first time but later she go it. i dont want the sound like the typical teenager although i am, but i really dont know anyone that matches my personality at all, or at least gets near. im sure they aare out there, i need to meet them.i wonder if we would get along?  i get along well w/ people who arnt like me but are still wierd, like artists or alternative dudes or patrick (?) or stoners (=\) its true."

"event","i love having this little journal here, i can write whater i want, and i know it somehow, because you are reading it, yet it doesnt have much o an impact on me because again, only you are reading it, and im sure your open-minded. 

anyway, recent ideas-----

found a great example for why democracy doesnt maeke sense, philosophy is based on examples used as proofs, this is a solid one- Democracy does not make sense because take a classroom of students with the teacher, the teacher (being the government (assumed a good teacher)) wants only to help the children (the people-- a good government is only in place to protect and help its people), now, would it make sense for the children to tell the teacher how to teach them, or would it make sense for the teacher who has already gotten a degree and has been accepted for the job to come up with teaching methods? I say the latter makes more sense, she friken went to school for it and has been trained for the position. 

It should be the same for politicions, there should be sepate schools for them that are paid for by the government that accept the same way colleges do and have hard requierments (like IQ level for example) these people then apply for jobs in the government. 

the people have a very important role, they have to report corruption. They have sepearte representatives that they correspond to to tell the politicans they are wrong and corrupted and have them removed. thats all I have so far. But I know the main institution of the State would be education, not commerce or forign wars. we would never have an offensive war (Mexican for for example) and we would never collect more from countries we have overthrown that tried to take us over. we would never try to get bigger. we would not be america. land of the free home of the free, where theres never a boast or brag.


my other idea is to join peace corps sometime before i settle down (which i cant imagine doing now but i know ill want to later) maybe right after college?i had more ideas but i forgot them. thats all for now"

well, i got a car. thats differant. its missing a few parts from the body, or else it waould be fine, from the outside. the interior and engine are great. the tape player doent work too hot though. i figured that it wouldnt have a cd player and i could get one of those tape player adapters for the tape player, but it doesnt work too hot as i sed before. i cant hear any of the voice, just the screaming guitar. hm, accually that could be usefull.....

well i have a rought draft of a 4-page reaserch paper due friday. i havent done anything and weve had weeks. so im trying to get started on it today so i have time to do other things tomorrow.(thats working isnt it)

im going to do rugby, i think. its my plan as of now. i need something physical to do. mainly so i can eat junk food and not feel guilty. 
jk
no, i havent been doing anything physical and i miss it, it makes you happier and stuff too! plus i can meet more people. sean wanted me to join last year but i couldnt. i can use my wrestlin' skills and my ""crazy monkey"" connotation from wrestling. (heh ""connotation"") 

yes,yes. these are on my mind.rugby is just football for real dudes, no pads and crap, no stopping and starting with all those plays, and steel spiked cleats. plus, i havent been seriously injured yet. i need to get that off my list. 

well thats enough for now. ENGLISH PAPER AHOY!"

lol yea i dont have much time lately, i need to chill. I can always tell my subconcious needs to chill because i start to stutter a bit again. aw well, it always goes away. 
Well thanks to the jewish kids at bellaire we have thursday and friday off. those kids rock, im telling ya. but im glad i get some time to catch up at school and possibly socially. last week i had to work 4 days, turs.and fri. then mon. and tues. so that was not cool. but this week its just sun. and tues.

yea, so i havent started any of my work, ive just been chilling, playing guitar, and cleaning/organizing (wtf?)
(
   yea so there are these shelves in the tv room over the built-in desk, my mom used to have it all nice and decorated but she decided we should put all our school crap there. so it started looking horrible and very bad in general so i cleared it out.
                )
i found stuff from 8th grade in the pile. It was those ""RR"" essays that ms.overlease had us do. its kinda funny: i really was a dork in middle school and i just re-noticed it now. i mean people ACCUALLY made fun of me. can you belive that!? thats crazy, i wouldnt belive it if i didnt have the vivid past experience. NO ONE messes with me now. (hehe)

but it was fun looking at my values back then. i wanted a high-paying job and i wanted to live close to my parents my whole life so that i could visit on thanksgiving. 

i read this one where i was talking about skateboarding. i was so into that back then. then i was like, maybe i could also learn to play guitar (maybe) and be a lead guitarest.

i just got like 7 cds. this product of the seventies dude who is the father figure in a friend of the family family was really into music back in the day. they just now adopted a kid, hes pretty young. he said that he didnt listen to that stuff anymore and i could have pretty much whatever i wanted because he was going to sell them. pretty sweet.
yea, so now I have YES, Electric Light Orchrestra, Eagles, Kansas, Genisis, and some others. good listning.

this had a been a unique (do you say an unique or a unique? unique starts with a vouwl...hmmm) (lol dont matter) 6 days. with hurrican rita and all. we ended up evacuating. my mom freaked out like she always does about everything. shes so funny. while we were getting ready to leave i was like, ""well mom you know your goning to have to water the plants because were not going to be here for so long"". she was like ""Daniel, we have priority! we dont have time to water the lawn, we still need to pack and fiz the house up...etc..etc"" and i was like ""mom! it was a joke"" and she was like ""ohhh, im sorry daniel, im so preoccupied"" or something like that. lol she even taped out mailbox shut...... 

we visited some freinds of the family in austin. they were nice and i ended up going to austin city limits. they live so close that you can hear it at thier house. their rolling around in the dough. that dude retired from being an executive of Shell. Austin city Limits was pretty sweet. i went saturday and sunday. i finally saw franz ferdinand live and i discovered a few bands. i guess it was part of my branching-out. there was only like one band with distortion and their not even hard rock. Jet. youve probobly heard of them. it was funny, they acted exactly like british rock stars from the late seventies. dropping guitars and pushing over the drumset. lol  

in relation to my last entry, the husband we were staying with is the epitome of what im trying to avoid. there is this airway company that gives its customers these ceramic house things every time they cross the atlantic or the pacific with their company. he (literally) had 50 to 60 of them. accually he may have had more than a hundred. im not sure but can you imagine how many hours on a plane that is? he looked like dick cheney too. and thats not all. it was a whole differant culture with him. its like his only pourpose in conversation was to make himself look good or to make you look confused or unwise or something like that. he wasnt mean but i guess most people would call him an asshole. i dont know. im just explaining what i dont want to be through a practical example. he just was so much above everyone economically and he knew it. he had a ""guestbook"" had had everyone sign who visited them. it must have had 600 differant names in it. im not saying he was a bad person, he seemed like a good fater, his sons are doing well, and he had had more than 20 exchange students living at their house. i dont know. i was repelled. maybe he didnt like my hair. 

enough of that. i have so much homework to do today. heh ive been wastin talking to patrick on the phone. i have the best conversations with that kid. we always end up talking about political philosophy and we almost never agree on the core topic were talking about. for example, he things government should be an expression of the people and i think it should be there to protect the rights of the people and service ONLY the people. with very few relations to other countries. he wants to go into politics. he could do it too. id like to but i dont think im good enough at english class or im not exactly an expert socially. nevertheless i need to finish home work by 6, i have to work.....man i dont have as much freetime these days. 
but im BASICALLY happy"

anyways thats still cool. dont have much to write, no real complaints on life or anything except that i never have extra time on weekdays or anything, (unless you count extra time as guitar time) thats pretty much all i do these days, i thiunkj ive mentioned that before though.

got this sublime cd and this grateful dead cd. they are both excellent althought i like the grateful dead more. I started playing it in the living room when my mom and sister were argueing over what to listen too while doing stuff. they both liked it and my mom like recognised two songs from the radio during her childhood. crazy stuff. its always funny when i ask my mom if she knows a band then say, o wait, maybe that was before your time. heh.

ah well i need to get two more current physics articles. i found this one in my scientific american magazine. this ""intellegent"" dude said you could travel through time if you went in the middle of a doughnut shaped gateway with gravity in the tube of the doughnut only, probobly whirling something heavy around to.

i feel a bit more enlightened these days. Its feeling pretty good.

i started reading on ethics again. for some reason I can comprehend it much easier now. I have no idea why. Ethics is one of those things, it cant really be proven to work other than by opinion. therefore people really dont follow it unless they take a chance. 
Philosophers classify things as being good for their product and good for themselves and not necceserilly their product. So far, of the ethical philosophers Ive read, (plato, socrates, mill, and kant) ethics is supposed to be good for itself. it doest really make sense, I do ethical stuff for the product. 
I dont know.

I feel like building something, electrical or mechanical. 
i took apart an old web-tv box someone gave me, and today I took apart an old dsl modem and reserched the chips for usefulness. maybe sometime Ill take input parts from these and make something useful.
my freind nick at kinkiad made an amplifier for his speakers. its cool, its all in an altoids box. I want to do something like that. 

heh I feel a bit like a geek

theres so much I want to do, so many roads in life that look good. its chilling to think that I will not be able to go down all of them.

The final I had was the guitar final, which consisted of three live DVDs a Led Zepplin, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and Jimmi Hendrix. To top it off, mr. Moore (teacher) bought doughnuts also. such a nice guy.

yea, so i rode my bike home and ive been jammin ever since. 

mand tommorow is the last day of school. all my senior friends are leaving. I was taking to one in my philosophy final and he was like, ""yea high school was good"". just seems weird having your peer being able to say that. I'm at the halfway point of high school but the second half always of anything goes faster.

I took my history and chem finals monday, phil. and algebra finals yesterday and tommorow is english. 
in hisotry I got a 97, phil. i got a 90, chem i got an 80, and the algebra teacher hasnt posted her grades yet. i was so scared of that chemistry final. its was a really hard test. all my freinds in that class were overjoyed that they passed. he must of curved the grades or something. there are 6 tree kids in master P's class (chem teacher) we gave him a present after the final. It's yellow and has a ten year old flexing his arm with ""CHICK MAGNET"" its funny cause he's gay. i saw him on a date once.

man, 4/20 was wednesday i think alot of people i hang out with do drugs now. one girl i never expected tries 4 new kinds -.- they think theyre happy. they have no idea.

i like this gut, he said ""better to be socrates and dissatisfied than a pig and satified"". And thinking about it he's right. although its not clear. i mean if your socrates, your intellegence would bring you down but every once in a while youd get happy for some reason. Love, Reason, Accomplishment, whatever. but the pig is just satisfied. he had physical pleasures all the time, but nothing to add up to socrates' stuff.

another quote you may be familiar with, ""better to have loved and lost than to have never loved."" same thing pretty much. if you never loved than you just satisfied where you are. you dont know what your missing. when you have loved, although your terrible currently, you'll love again. 
eventually

wow ive written alot. time to stop.

"event","im feeling pretty good in a weird way today. This has been a very opening evening. Ive been on the internet for a long time, like 2 or 3 hours. but ive been listning to electronica, which i normally dont listen to (im trying to decide weather i should go to a ""The Crystal Method"" concet thats coming. Sounds pretty good, I might go.

Also been listning to the cure, not sure why. all i knew about before today was that my history teacher had a shirt of them. There pretty good. But kinda reminded me that I dont have a g/f and such. Maybe my teacher will wear that shirt again and i can say its a good band. 

A bit annoyed with today's ""Death Metal"" - not at all what it used to be with keyboards and singing in the chorus (sumtimes 3-part harmonies) yea, ill stick to thrash 

I want to listen to more electronica though, this is good.

Been doin ebaying too, looking for a bigger cd case and some of those big stereo headphones, found some, I just hope noone outbids me. unlikely.

I feel there should be some big philisophical thing next, but i just dont feel like it now"

"event","Im starting to like posting here. 

Today was the homework day for me. Im trying to type without looking at my hands and its taking awile but i gave up already. 

I found Out I'm no good at lyrics. I composed a song for guitar class, we have to have a progression and a melody and words (if possible). but when it came down to words I went blank, I guess im just better at composing, which is fine with me fully. i prefer the music to the words in music anyway, especially in my music X.x

I was sitting outside writing down my progression in musical staff notes. and i saw a bee walking on the sidewalk. Why you would walk if you had those nift wings i dont know. with i had an empty bottle of water and i got him to come inside. 

Maybe thats not real nice, but i never got a chance to see a bee up close before, strange thing was that he never stopped walking. That was this after noon. i let him out after about 10 minutes of examination. 
I wonder what hes up to now? sleeping? hairy fella"

"event","my first freinds ever were mariah and jason, mariah is 1 year older than me and jason in 2 years older than her. i met mariah when i was 2 and she was 3. weve been freinds ever since. we see them every 4th of july and every christmas. but we saw them today. it was nice. jason is in college now. hes going to texas A&M i think id like to go there they have a nice engineering program and sean's planning on going there, if sean doesnt go then i dont think i will, but he's planning to. seans dad owns a house there. so i can pay rent but i dont know i want the whole college experiance in a dorm. i thin the frst year ill have a dorm then afterward ill live in seans place. itll be nice, i can have my cats there. Thats whats on my mind.

also ive been thinking about the meaning of life (for humans):

when it comes to life in general, the meaning of life is clear. that meaning is for you to reproduce then to make your species stay alive. Because if it wasnt, we would not be here
ex. the first life ever, being a single celled eukaryote didnt have reproduction as its meaning of life, it would soon die from old age and having not reproduced, life would vanish from earth. How many times did that happen?

Humans are differant, we had that meaning for awile before we became civilized and finely populated. but according to erickson once the basic needs are met, a being starts to look at other things. like the rennisance, when people stoped being hungry, they put down their pichfork and decided they were bored and started painting er whatevever.
So, now, after we can stop wondering about where our next meal is going to come from, and we know that the human race will surely stay alive with 6.4 billion, we think to ourselves, about doing something to do. But what are we looking for? money? entertainment? physical pleasure? all of these have something in common, upon reciveing the thing, you become happy. so the meaning of life must be happiness, because everything you do, you do because you want to be happy sometime or another. 

Okay, so I'm happy, then what? thats something ive never really thought about before yesterday. Then after one is happy, their meaning coverges with the animals meaning, it is to make your species happy. because like you, after you knew you could reproduce you had too make sure your species would survive. 
ex. reproduction:having you species survive::happiness:all-human happiness

long story short, you need to have a good government to make everyone happy as long as possibe.

your probobly tired of reading and im tired of typing. ill start where i left off next time er sumtime.

anyone who is reading this can definatly comment if you want. a big part of philosophy is philisophical argument."

"event","I didnt get to updat again that last day, sorry about that. Funny how when your not busy your busy doing nothing. but uh im just sitting here now, the cat is on my lap cause she never can get enough of me. 

I should say something about why i had to go that last time, yea, my cousins from my dad's side that live in california are over. and they, like my cat, cannot get enough of me something about a family member with long hair just shakes their little minds i  guess, or stirres there 1st grade rebellion. There muslim, pretty strongly too, the dads like a fundamentalist pretty much.  Even though we live in the same culture its like they live in their own little world. they cant listen to the readio, thats what got me, i asked why, and the kid thought fer a bit and said that his dad said it was ""dirty"". i was like ""why?"", and he said ""guitare"".

like half of me is guitar-related so that gave me a shock. Im always thinking about music or humming music or singing music or playing music. its a big deal fer me. 

In guitar class we have to write a song, we have to have a chord progression and a melody, both have to be writtten out (musically not tabbed). I have a pretty sweet progression I came up with. Took me a while though, but I started to look for lyrics and I found out I suck a lyrics. Its hard to write an intro to a song too, also i really dont have too much on my mind anyway that can be a good topic for a song. I came up with a few lines of a verse. worst comes to worst ill just have somebody else accompany me and play the melody, I really dont know if many people will sing at all. Teenages are so afraid of attention. any attension could be negative attention."

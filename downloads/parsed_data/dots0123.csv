"event","I definitely have a one track mind... I got so much done for Spirit Day yesterday I couldn't even sleep I was so excited! Everyone really likes the idea and lots os peeps are involved. Now all I have to do is come up with a top ten list. Conquered that task... As for prom I think I finally have a date. Word on the street is someone wants to ask me and I would be very happy to go with him. I hope that works out. The doctor at work today told me she wanted me to start learning some ""real"" assistant stuff. I am nervous but feel good she asked me to do it. So far I haven't had any problems with her personally so hopefully that doesn't change! Tess even stopped in to get her evaluation for co-op so i got to talk to her. It looks as though I will be hangin out with Lizz, Dustan, and Brent (not bret) soon, so that should be fun. I like that Tess and know some of the same people. It keeps things interesting. There is only one more thing to tackle on my list and I plan to take care of it soon. It just requires a lot of me so I have been kinda putting it off. hmmm what else. Oh yea snow what? Today was totally gorgeous! I love nice weather! I jammed with my windows down and it was very fun. Well i am off to study for a couple tests..."

"event","So I woke up today to snow! What the I was wearing sandals all weekend that sucked, but yea I changed the Spirit Day theme!Whoo, I was getting sick of all the complaints and finally realized that I am kind in charge of making everyone happy, so why not a compromise?I think everyone is as satisfied as they'll get, I just need help getting this together. The Juniors are having a frickin bottle drive! What is this? Amy quit at my work:( She was the one who watched out for me! I'll miss her lots. Apparently she got sick of being yelled at by the Dr. I think I'll send her a card or something. I am very anxious to see how all my situations unfold. My mom said all bad things come in three's and my last one was last night, so hopefully I am in the clear. we'll see..."

"event","Ok i was all ready to talk about my cute weekend until I just found out that Jason cant come to prom. He has stupid exams! I mean you could skip a class but not an exam. this sux so much. I've been picturing us going together for so long. Now what am I supposed to do? I have one week to figure out a date. What if I can't get one? Who should I ask? I knew this was too perfect to be true. Rach is going to die. We always thought how cute it was that Greg and Jason are kind of the same. Come to think of it Greg seems to be like alot of ""our boys"", Bill lol. 
Ok so whatever I am really happy that Elizabeth Hassenrik got into U of M. She wanted to go really bad and I love her so it will be fun to go to the same school if she decides to come. 
I also had fun getting Dave tickets yesterday morning. Marshal Fields was supposed to have a lottery but decided to change their mind and do first come first serve. I am glad I got there and hour early still beacause I was already 15th in line. We probably would not have got tickets because I already am right behind the stage all the way at the top! I love Dave though so it'll be fun no matter what. Too bad Joel likes to make fun of me for spending 60 dollars to be behind the stage! I love that kid though. He seriously makes me happy. 
Last night I went to see Dustin Timberlake, Lizz's new interest  who is reallyy cute with her! He plays base for a Berkley band. It was fun because Tess was there, my friend from work. Then I ate a Hani ( long ""a"") and we went to the ghetto dollar show. It should be called the two dollar show...but anyway. I got to see part of 8 mile so I was happy. Well I am going to go stress out about prom dates and crap..."

"event","Ok so here goes a real entry, I hate that it is going to be a bunch of bitchin and moanin but... so there are a million thing going on right now, one being Spirit Day! egh what the heck am I supposed to do for this thing. I have been stressing for this one since frosh year because there is so much pressure for it to be good since we are seniors. whatever. We strayed away from the original theme ""One Senior Morning"" to ""Shrek"" don't ask me how this happened I am just as confused as anyone else. i guess it will be fine though because U have some ideas fro it and such. We couldnt agree how to tie in the whole cartoon thing together, but this kinda works. Did I mention we only have a week and a half to do this? um yea. So my weekend will consist of watchin ""Shrek"" by myself to try an figure what the hell I am going to write for a script. Its one of those things where I have a begining and end but dont knwo what to do with the middle. Also there is that ever so wonderful thing coming up called prom. I really want to be excited about it but I don't even know if my prospective date is coming! I called Jason ( up north) last weekend but I have yet to here from him. As soon as I know for sure I will be able to get very excited, that is if he decides he is coming. Aww I have been thinking about this since I've known him. This whole senior thing is really getting to me...I mean I am realizing that I have less than 25 classes with Espanol cuatro and Senora Peterson, let alone the whole school. it is kinda mind blowing because I ahve invested so much in that school. On the other hand I can't wait to just move out and move on. Ok well a very weird situation is about to occur so I have to go answer the door..."

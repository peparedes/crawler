Well, I heard from Chris.  Yeh I guess I can use his name in the open now because since Ali knew before I knew she knew (say that ten times fast) then yeah... don't have to hide it.  They must be best friends, ya think?  ""Ali can never know,"" is what I was told, and then 24 hours later she knows and not from me.  LOL.  Yep... best friends.  Anyway... heard from Chris, which I was told would probably not happen.  So ""yay"" for that.  He replied to my LJ and then deleted it.  Kinda weird there... guessing he didn't want everyone to see it, so fine.  I can respect that.

*sighs*  And... I guess he didn't like me <i>that</i> much.  That was kinda the jist of it all.  Attraction has static degrees, this I didn't know.  Apparently it goes ""Like"" and <i>then</i> ""Crush""... ahhh see, heres my problem.  Like an idiot, I thought that was the same thing.  Ugh, I hate semantics.  I'm such an anti-semantic bastard (thank you, House).  I guess.  So!  I had a ""crush"" on Chris, and he just liked me.  I've learned something new.  Go me.

Eh, any chance of anything was pretty dead from the start.  Too many parties working against it.  Too much baggage.  I learned something boys and girls.  Naivete is as much a form of baggage as a person liking multiple people, or a person determined to not allow a relationship to grow because *they* think its wrong.  From the start this whole thing was a friggin mess with so many sides to it a politician would be proud.  Whats the word Im looking for... Byzantine?  Anyway, sabotage, duplicity, miscommunication and good intentions all rolled into one package.  In short, everything you'd expect from a really great soap opera.  If really great soap operas exist that is.  I've only seen really crappy ones.

Sooo... bottom line I guess for me is that I'm not mad anymore.  I feel really stupid and my confidence is a little shaken.  I really did think of this as my first step out of the gate for being a true gay male.  First crush acted on, even though it wasn't as reciprocal as I thought.  Even if the distance was large, I still felt it.  And my gut reaction right now is to retreat for awhile... anybody who likes me can tell me and act on it before I say a damm word.

Chris... you're still my friend, if you want.  Its up to you, though.  You are right... it <i>is</i> smarter... it just wasn't <i>preferred</i>.

Anyway I need breakfast.  Yum.  Food.  Im making a Mickey-D's run, anybody want a hash brown?

"event","Wow two posts in one day... who'd have imagined I was capable?  

Well I laid on the lawn for awhile in my coat and just more or less enjoyed the rain on my face and the feel of the cool going through me.  Thought it was ironic that the cold was making my fingers and hands and ears go all numb so I was focused more on those feelings than anything else.  I guess that was a numbness too.  

I came back totally soaking wet.  Thank God Jesse wasn't around or he'd have slipped his shit at me for dripping water on.. i dunno... his half of the tile or something.  LOL  Whatever.  Its been a few hours and Im still kind of damp.  Funny.  I think I'll go take a looooong ass shower when Brig and I are done posting for the afternoon.  We're working on a MaM pre-post and I think its going really great.  

When I was outside I had an older lady... guessing she was a prof... come up and ask if I was alright.  I said I was good so then she just looked at me like I was crazy.  Nope.  Just love the cold and the rain and the fog.  Its so romantic and mysterious.  I do little things like that.  Stand in the rain.  Catch snow on my tongue.  

I've had time to think about how I feel.  And what I come up with is feeling betrayed.  I really liked this boy and despite distance and stuff, I would've loved to see what could have grown out of it.  Even if it was just a close friendship that sometimes crossed that intimacy line.  Maybe I'm kicking myself a lot ... punishing myself because I dared to think of him and me sexually.  Even though we agreed being friends would probably be smarter and make more sense.  But to find out all of this from an LJ not even meant for me directly... to have praise deleted... to have things ignored is just hurtful.  And I guess... well... mean.  I never thought of him as mean.  I don't want to think of him as mean even still.

Ah well.  Life goes on.  Got a post to make.

"event","Its finally raining and all nice and cloudy and foggy.  I love this weather.  So I'm just chilling in bed when I should be going to school.  But no.  I just want one day.  One day that I can go sit in the rain and the clouds and love the weather.  Gonna go put on a sweatshirt and some pants and yep... camp out on my back in the nearest field just so I can feel the rain come down.  Try not to think about a few things, but thats beside the point.  I slept so good last night too.  I mean I think my head hit my pillow and I didn't wake up until my suitemate closed the door to the bathroom at like 7:30 kinda hard.  Since Im an insomniac, any day that starts like that, plus my kind of weather... oh fuck yea.  I feel kind of bad because I originally was going to get up earlier to see some people... but I didn't.  Its gonna be a good day.

Well, sort of good day.  I'll admit its not all good.  I feel a little used and I shouldn't.  I know I shouldn't.  But I do and it hurts a bit.  Ugh I shouldn't talk about it... but then who the hell even reads this thing anymore?  I mean seriously, its not like I had a ton of emotion invested... months of time spent together.  All that.  Just a feeling.  And anyway, this is my fucking journal isn't it?  Can't I say what I want, especially since I feel betrayed by the one I was guarding?  

No I shouldn't go there.  I mean do I want to remember things that way?  Things... that implies something actually happened.  And it didn't.  Just one nice moment where I thought I was liked and... yeah.  So for posterity's sake... nothing happened.  So why am I caring?  I guess cuz I liked him too.  Maybe thats all I should try to remember.  Ah hell, what do I know... maybe someone'll like me and want to be with me someday.  Just gotta be patient.  

And I guess another thing seperate... what does it mean to other people when someone deletes a comment in their LJ you made?  Who am I asking anyway... myself?  Well it hurts a lot.  Because I was just showing I liked what they wrote and they DELETED me?!  Thats cold...

Okay so today isn't starting out as great as I was hoping... but I need to try and turn it into a good day.  I just hope Jesse doesn't cross me today or *WHAM!*  Wow... like I could really do that.  Or maybe I could.  As Ive written all this, Ive gone from mildly hurt to really hurt and mildly pissed off.  I mean, damn.  I promised to protect them and then I get a knife in the back...

OKay the finding of someone else is all good... we agreed nothing could happen right now.  Or maybe he meant ever.  I could've standed that too.  Friends is Friends is Friends, no matter how much you might want in their pants.  Ended on a good note either way.  I emailed him sorta... I dunno... reaffirming what we said and said Id stand by him because.... well... yeah.  Also posted what I guess I thought was praise to his LJ.

And I wake up this morning and I feel fucking great... get on the computer.  No email back.  Ah well!  Maybe he just didn't get it.  Maybe he didn't have the time.  Eh okay no biggie.  Not on AIM... ah hell.. no biggie.  Has to go to school anyway.  Get on my LJ... I always look to see what my friends've written while Ive been gone.  Sooo Im going through all my friends' and I see in the one I commented on, the comments gone.  Ah well.. my computers so fucked up, it'd tell me anyway it felt like at that moment.  So I went in and it was gone... *sting*  That kinda hurt.  Maybe he just doesn't like comments to his work.  Okay I can respect that...

Get on and read his newest post... hmm... and everything suddenly comes together.  New gilfriend.  Well goddamm shweet for him, I am happy for him.  I really am.  Except I get this really sharp feeling that I am definitely not worth telling.  No email.  Deleted LJ.  No comment to my own LJ... that just adds up to one big fuck you, you actually mean shit to me.  You'd at least think he'd have told me in an email... no email, lots of boasting on his LJ.  So much for no time... 12 hours after a, ""I like you, take that as you will,"" and he's panting over someone else.  

And I know Im saying all this over something that everybody thinks is so trivial.  But its not trivial to me.  This was the first time a guy has ever told me he liked me without just wanting to get a piece of ass.  And now, its shit.  I am THAT easy to just discard and forget.  That or I really am stupid and naive and he was just telling me what i wanted to hear.  Not even a note telling me what happened... 

Well fine.

Okay I got it all out.  I don't feel any better but I did.  I know I will get over this.  Like I said... its probably more trivial than it feels right now.  Maybe I'll realize that in a few days.  It just means my start out of the gate consisted of me stepping in horse shit.  Oh well.  Time for rain.

I can't stand this anymore... and I don't know why Im just sitting at a computer venting about it instead of actually doing something about it.  And maybe I should as soon as I vent because this just isn't okay with me anymore.

Jesse locked me out of my own dorm again tonight, which makes twice in five weeks.  He locked me out so he can FUCK SOME RANDOM GIRL... <b>again</b>!  I'm so tired of his sex life dominating who is in the dorm.  I'm done... I really am.  Can't he keep it in his pants for five seconds?!  I can believe that I might be a little jealous of him and how successful he is with who he wants... fine.  That might be true.  God knows I haven't gotten any and maybe that my fault for trying to be all stupid and old-fashioned.  maybe I should go out and just get fucked... maybe then things won't seem like such a big deal to me. 

Anyway, I'm gonna go get my RA and have him open the dorm up for me, which I should've done the first time but I'm a shy, spineless worm.  Whatever I may feel about his success, envy or not, I wouldn't lock him out of his own dorm even though I hate him!  

Okay.  I'm going.  I just needed to vent.  I am not going to bother Dani AGAIN because of this guy!

"event","Hey Log,

My first post of October... and it doesn't feel like October outside so I feel slightly guilty for not being outside.  Eh, who cares.  Its not even light out now- its 8:30 at night.  I think I missed the window.  I still didn't go outside that much today.  I was going to come back here early and do homework hoping that Jesse would be gone.  But i ended up lounging around the house all day while my parents were out shopping for the house.  Chatted with a few ppl on-line though and thats fun.

I wonder who even reads this stuff anymore, so I kind of wonder if I should write these.  I mean, my log is my head.  Same with my alarm clock.  I've neevr used an alrm clock in my life.  I just wake up around when I have to be up.  I'm almost never late... like... twice in my life MAYBE.  Anyway I just wonder.  Now that Ive added groups and people to my friends, it all comes as a huge jumble and... yeah... i wonder who really ever bothers to make sense of the friends jumble.  Maybe just the really important people.

Well Im back at the dorm now... Jesse's in his bunk with a girl.  Ew.  Like, hello!  I'm here!  I don't want to listen to them make out all night.  That and the extra weight is so making his mattress sag.  The last thing I need is to wake up with a smooshed nose.  Heh.  My nose looks funny enough!!  Oh well.  He probably hates that im siting here in my underwear.  Nyahaha.  Suck me, Jesse.  Okay don't.  You're not my type.  Ever.  Not even if the world was about to end.  If the human race's survival was dependent on me sucking Jesse's dick or him sucking mine... well... assume crash positions peeps, cuz we're all gonna die.  

I found a Ron x Harry slash site on LJ today.  Its such the secks.  I could've spent all day with my hand on my dick reading like a fangirlboy... except I wasn't sure when people'd get home.  But its wicked-good.  

Is anyone else in the world getting their butts kicked by allergies right now?  God, I think I'm gonna die... which is probably why I didn't really go outside.  Millions of cruel little allergens wanting to penetrate my body and make me even scarier than I already am.  Drippy eyed, drippy nosed semi-femboy.  Its got to be scary.  I want cold weather.  Vastly, bone-chillingly freezingly cold.  The kind that you wake up and roll right back over to sleep because youre warm but can see your own breath in your room.  I.  WANT.  And not only because its cold... but because it kills allergens!

Ewwwwwwww!!!!  I saw breasts!  I saw breasts!  GAAHHHHH!  Okay Im being over-dramatic, breasts can be... nice... and... pillow-like things that gayboys can rest their heads on without fear of... but GGGAAAAAH!  I dont know these breasts!  They're casual sex breasts!  Diediediediediedie, Jesse!  

Oh fun... 

Ten minutes later... I was just asked if i wanted to be in a threesome by the casual breasts!  So now Im hiding in fear.. erm.. in front of the keyboard, again.  With every intention of hiding under my covers after.  Jesse flipped out.  A least that part was fun.  First thing he says was, ""He's not fucking me!""  Well duh Im not!  Im not going anywhere NEAR his skanky ass!  I don't even like seeing his ass in a pair of pants covered by a shirt!  BUT GOD!  Casual Breasts was friggin annoying about it!  Pulled the whole... 'oh come on, you aren't prude are you?'  Pshhh yyyyeah Im prude when it comes to umm... well... casual sex and girls.  Like Im offering up my virginity to some girl I dont even know!!  Jesse finally shouted, ""He's a fag, can we go now?""  Well... thanks for making the point... and thanks for shouting it the rest of the whole fucking DORM!!!  Maybe no one heard?

Anyway they're gone now thank Merlin.  Im going to bed now... now that I got all that out.  

Later,
Will"

Well I talked to my RD and RA today.... just really have had enough of my roommate's shit lately.  And they said while I could move out of the dorm I'm in now, I'm screwed unless I know someone who also wants to move out of their dorm and shack it up with me.  Theres not really any ""open"" dorms for me to just move in to and start over with.  

So thats crappy.  I don't really know anyone else that would want to move in with me that lives on campus... thats my sex!  Damm being shy sucks!  

So basically I am stuck with Jesse unless HE decides hes had enough of ME, and goes for his own roommate in his own dorm.  And of course my first instinct was to find the nearest gay guy I could find, bring him back and get banged harder than a drum right around the time that he'd be coming back from class.  But then I think... no.  Thats not right... thats stooping to his level.  And I guess I have a serious problem with using sex and my sexuality as a weapon against someone I hate... even though I really hate him.  Some stupid part of me would rather prove him WRONG about gays and end his phobicness, rather than just gross him out and encourage his phobia.  

Does that make any sense?

Soooo basically unless something changes, I think Im consigned to Jesse-land for the rest of the term... at least until winter and then maybe I'll have a better shot.  Oh well.

Lets see....

Positive note... I've been working hard on A Hogwarts Tale... I don't think I'll launch it until after Brig's Murder at Midnight is over with in January though.  I guess I prefer not to step on toes and... yeah.  Plus I need to learn how to run a game anyway.  I need to find some Mods who would be able to help.  And then theres player recruitment... I have NO idea how to do that.  I guess in my dark moments I am betting that this will be a massive flop.  Okay that was more negative than I meant it to be.  It was supposed to be mostly good!

Wow I just zoned for like five minutes, staring at a stick of deodorant and figuring out where I can buy some more.  Isn't that sad?  

Okay no!  OMG OMG!  *claps*  Good news!  The Chilis in Louisville is hosted by quite possibly the sexiest God I have ever ever ever seen!  I walked in (alone, of course... I wanted to go to Kohls) and I heard this voice next to my ear and I looked up and the guy was like a foot from my face holding the door open.  Blonde hair.  Blue eyes.  Thin... taller than me by a few.  Oh my God!  I just locked and it was like I was in this funny tingly tunnel.  I saw his mouth moving and I think I was dumb enough to actually squint at him... like a retard.  Ugh.  Finally realized he was asking me how many were in my group.  

Anyway before I kill the whole fantasy.... he was so yummy.  Like... dressed so nice and loved his hair and oh my god his voice!  I mean I know he was just doing what hosts do... being hostly.  Most friendly host Ive ever seen but simple observation told me he did it with everyone.  He was.... hmm.... funny and quippy and witty and... God am I really just that desperate and horny?  Probably.  I should try to forget about him.  Im sure he's straight... not that Ive ever had a working gaydar in my life but I should forget it.  Still it was kind of hard to find excuses to stare at his ass or face when he walked by.  The people next to me probably thought I was staring at their daughter like I was some sicko ped.  Mmm just my luck... ew.  

Anyway Im off to ignore my roommate and watch a movie,

I just spent four very freaking long days in Roswell, and talk about being drained in every respect imaginable.  I don't think I have ever needed a vacation (or a blowjob) more than I do right now.  My granddad was in the hospital for his diverticulitis a few weeks ago... I mentioned it on here.  Well on Thursday, things went to total shit.  He called in the nurses complaining that he couldn't breathe?  So they thought he might have a pulmonary embolism, but then they seemed to have sidetracked that because they found this abcess under his lung that was pushing on it.  So they had to drain that.

At the same time, the doctors couldn't get his stomach and stuff to ""wake up"" after the surgery.  I learned something here... that the body doesn't all wake up from anethesia at once.  Weird.  Anyway, he was starting to turn yellow in his skin and eyes too, so he was experiencing liver failure.  And then BOOM.  4 o'clock, my dad gets the call that my granddad had had a heart attack.  There <b>was</b> a pulmonary embolism and it did exactly what you don't want a pulmonary embolism to do- move into the heart.  

So my Uncle was pretty dire and so were the nurses... and so we all got in the car and left on a long ass ten to twelve hour drive (I don't know how long it was, I lost my watch in Raton).  It had all felt like this huge series of nasty things and total boobery on the part of these hospitally types (I know, I'm just lashing out cuz Im tired).   

So we get down to Roswell and for awhile it looks pretty shitty.  So thats emotionally draining... and then my cousin, who is probably the most spoiled kid on the PLANET demanded I play with him pretty much nonstop.  Only problem with that is he's super active, but when he hurts himself, its all your fault.  So needless to say its kind of hard to be assigned babysitter for four days nonstop.  Anyway.  It was also like 95 degrees down there and my bodys started to get used to the cool weather back at home, so I was just running buckets of sweat.  And I really hate being hot... I'm a cool weather person.

So finally, my Granddad starts making a serious improvement.  They get his liver and all working and he stops turning all yellow.  And he's got his sense of humor back and stuff.  He still has to stay in the hospital for a few more weeks which sucks.  I guess in a finally kind of macabre act, he wanted us all to go around the house and decide what we wanted after he was gone.  I sorta felt like i was walking over someone's grave.  Anyway we finally got back a few minutes ago and I went to school.  I so don't want to be here right now.  I got less than 4 hours of sleep every night just because I was in a strange place and it was really hot and all.  I just want to go home and sleep... except Im sure my asshole roommate is there.  Im afraid that in this state I'll tell him what I really think of him.

*sigh*  I guess iIm going to school for awhile.

Well I woke up with my own head about eighty billion miles above my own body.  The astronauts on Atlantis say howdy and liked my underwear.

Or so NyQuil and a 101 degree temperature would tell me.  I hate that floaty feeling I get when Im sick.  

It must be my first month at school because I have always gotten sick by then since I was like five.  So I stayed home (home... when did this cell of a dorm become home to me?) all day and watched movies.  I napped in between shows, so I had some twisted views of what was on TV today.  But in between naps and zone outs I actually got on the computer and started working on this Harry Potter idea.  I think I made some okay headway on it too.  

Okay I've said my piece.  By the way, I loved House today.  Chimaeraism, inventive.  Got a little queasy watching the brain surgery part, though.    Okay now Ive really said my piece so I should go lay down again.

have you ever had a moment of clarity when you thought something made a lot of sense and when you actually start doing it, you feel in over your head?  Thats me and this game idea I ahve going.  I'm trying to come up with a Firefly-based game set in a colony, but as I stare... well... to be honest... at Dan radcliffe's naked chest in my last pic... I wonder if I should do something I know and make myself a Harry Potter game.  I know HP better and its established.  Where I'm going with this Baskerville is sort of scary because I will have to make up literally everything!  Since this is my very first game I wonder if I have made a big mistake and bitten off more than I can chew.  

I guess the major reason Ive done as much as I have on the page itself is I can't figure out how to delete communities from my list.  So its just sitting there on my board, griping at me!

Okay, seeing as I'm really bored, its really cold outside and I'm me, I've decided to compile the list of people that I really want in the pants of!  

<center><img src=""http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/entweiss/creamydoctorwho.jpg"">

Aww Doctor!  You're so mean!  Its MY livejournal!  Mine!  Can't I write what I want?  Fine, Tardis Slap me.</center> 
<table width=100%><tr><td><img src=""http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m84/entweiss/harrydan.jpg""></td><td valign=top>Okay!  My list of G.I.L.F. - Guys I'd Love to Fuck!  Uhh... in no particular order because that would require effort and I think theres a commandment that I can't do that on a Sunday or something.  

1) Daniel Radcliffe

2) Aaron Carter (I know he can't sing, I care?)

3) Jensen Ackles (Hey, watch Supernatural sometime... its cool!)

4) Shaun White

5) Randy Harrison (Justin from QAF)

6) Tom Felton (Malfoy.  <b>Draco</b> Malfoy.)

And now I'm realizing I should have put more thought into this instead of playing with pictures.  Or maybe theres just six guys in the whole wide world I want to do.  Okay that can't be true.  My brain is just still totally frozen is all.  Yeah thats got to be it.  Anyway I'm signing off because I smell breakfast downstairs.

I am so going home this weekend.  My roommate is driving me INSANE!!!  He brought home some random girl last night and LOCKED ME OUT OF MY OWN DORM!  Thats right.  I'm never leaving my dorm without my keys again!  I just got up from my desk to go see the RA about the sink and when I came back... gee... suddenly the door was locked.  I spent the night with my friend Dani, had to sleep in her bed or on one cold, hard-ass floor.  I chose the bed.  Maybe the WRONG choice.  No offense to her, but she's a grabber (thank God she doesn't have an LJ)!  I woke up at like 2am and she was spooning me.  Which was a little weird.  I couldn't really undo myself from her so I was awake until like 3 when she rolled over.  FINALLY.  Finally went to sleep and woke up again at 5 or so because she had taken all the covers and I was freezing my balls off. 

Anyway, the asshole (roommate, not Dani) didn't even let me get some fresh clothes, so I'm going to class in the same clothes as yesterday.  No deodorant.  No toothbrush.  No hairbrush... although Dani let me borrow hers.  No BOOKS TO STUDY!  Eh screw school today.  I needed to go talk to a couple teachers and I had a study thing for Maths but just... screw it. I'm going home... or maybe the mall.  LOL.  I need to shop.  Good thing I usually have my wallet on me.  I hope its in my pants.  I remember sitting on it on the bus.  One sec.  Everyone's probably going to think I'm groping myself now.

Yep got my wallet.  DUH!  I got on the bus didn't I?  Time to go blow a wad.  Ugh... okay I didn't mean that kind of wad and then my sick-ass brain just went there.  Ew.  Eh I'll get self-conscious and delete it later anyway.  For now it stays.  See this is what happens when I get no sleep.  I stop caring about what I say.  Very bad.   

Crrrap... its only 8:15.  Mall doesn't open for forever.  :(  I think I'm going to cry.

Will

PS (Since I seem to have the time)- Why is my wallet so wussy?  I actually had someone comment on my wallet size a couple weeks ago.  I took it out to pay and they were like, ""damn, don't you ever use your wallet?""  For what?!  I don't carry cash so lets see... I have a grand total of three things in it.  Driver's license.  Debit card.  School ID.  Am I weird that I don't have a thick, lumpy wallet?  Is this the next thing a guy is measured on?  Forget measuring your cock.. oo... come on baby, measure it for me.  How thick is your <i>wallet</i>?  Forget that bulge in front, lets see that bulge in back!  Is THAT what they mean when they say its good to have a bubble butt?  Eh, guess I'm screwed twice now. 

Okay I know I'm being silly.  But for everyone who just MUST know... my wallet's HUGE.  GINORMOUS.  When its filled out right my pants get uncomfortable.  :p  Another thing for gusy to lie about I guess.  I'm taking myself and my puny wallet to breakfast now.  If theres any cute guys at Dennys, please come fuck me up the ass.  :p"

School starts in a few minutes.  But I've been avoiding writing anything... mostly because squat has happened.  Get up.  Eat breakfast.  Go to school.  Eat lunch.  Come home.  Study.  Pump for mayo.  Study.  Watch TV.  Study.  Go insane.  Go to bed.  Okay so its not as simplistic as ""lather rinse and repeat"" but it works.  Come to think of it, I should put that in there too.  I seriously need a routine break right now.  For some random cute guy to come and grab my ass out of nowhere and just shock me the hell out of my mundaneness.  

Okay I didn't write this thing to bitch about my lack of getting laid.  Its not like I can... my roommate in all his infinite prickness declared that I shouldn't do anything gay in front of him while he's home.  It just makes me want to grab the nearest semi-cute guy, drag him into my dorm, make sure he's watching and then I don't know... stick my tongue in his ear or something stupid like that.  It'd be funny to have him come back and the first thing he sees as he opens the door is me bent over the couch with some guy's face in my ass.  Okay so maybe that was too far.  I'm still not deleting it.  :p  He'd probably go running to the RA or something.  

Anyway thats all thats pissing me off right now.  Time for school.  I'm late.

I've been pretty broken up the last couple days and haven't had much of a chance to talk about it.  I've had to act ""strong""... I don't know why I did or why I should.  But I did.  So Saturday morning after I wrote about Delirium around lunch, my Dad comes jumping back from his thing in the park and says that his dad, my granddad was in the hospital.  So my Mom and Dad went to go see him and I stayed at home in my old room and everything.

Yesterday he had surgery but the night before my sister went all hysterical and crazy because she was worried.  So I was all alone and had to try and comfort her while dealing with my own stuff.  It wasn't fun.  But it turns out his surgery went good and I guess he'll make a full recovery.  Not bad for an 84 year old guy.

I'm starting to work on my very first game idea for a Firefly game to keep my mind off of it.  I never knew it was so hard to make a game.

Later

"event","Hey Log,

Last night I went to Delirium with my family.  We got to the Pepsi Center in I swear record time even with traffic.  Parking was a breeze except for the general attitude of Denverites to take a pedestrian's life at a whim.  *smirks*  Some nice Suburban decided I should be road pizza until the very last minute.  Okay I am exaggerating.  But it was still wicked bad to have a car coming at you and really getting the idea it wasn't going to stop.  

We got to the Pepsi Center anyway... its a nice building, I've never been in it.  We were at first in these total nosebleed seats off to the side.... and I'm afraid of heights.  Our seats were on this weird ledge with a wall and a rail.  Just one row.  Oh God I was in hell.  But I shut up and took it until my brother and sister both piped up that we were really uncomfortable.  My Dad was like, ""Okay I thought it was just me, be right back.""  Lesson of the story?  Never buy tickets from ticketmaster.  We got so much better seats a level down and straight forward.

So about the show.  Its pretty cool but I don't know if it lived up to the hype of what I've always heard.  Its a combo of techno and new age and tribal percussion chants with acrobatics and dance.  And they use these huge sheets to simulate different environments but you can still see mostly through them.  It was pretty cool.  These people bend themselves into ways I didn't think was possible.  There was one guy who bent himself into a backwards L while balancing on a pole twenty feet in the air.  There were these other guys that were throwing each other around like they were paper!  You get a look at these people and they're not tall huge, but they are just ripped!  They ripple when they walk I swear.  

One thing I didn't pick up on (apparently) until almost halfway through is how homoerotic it is.  I guess I'm just to the point that seeing two guys with their hands on each other's hips and dancing is just normal to me.  I didn't even realize it until this number with three couples around a singer.  I looked and it was two women, so I was all like, ""Oh hey thats cool, but its probably just who they got paired with.""  Then I look over... theres the straight couple.  And then I realize the two I've been watching before all this were two guys.  So it kind of dawned on me.  And the whole rest of the show, I was watching for the ""gay"" couples which came on several times.

I kind of wanted to punch the guy in the nose behind me as we were leaving when his girlfriend asked if he liked it and he said, ""You could have warned me that it was going to be gay.""

Anyway I really liked it but it didn't quite reach the hype I kept getting.  I don't really know why.  I've seen it, I don't really need to see it again.

Later,
Will"

"event","I guess this is my opening post to this thing.  I've never ever kept a log and I don't know how many people will ever actually read it.  I don't know whats normal either.  Do I just put ""dear log"" or ""dear  diary""?  I guess its my log so I can do whatever I want.  So here goes...

Hey Log,

Well I went on a date with this guy from CU last night.  Or he said he went to CU but after last night I don't really know if I believe him.  We met on a chatsite and talked and he seemed kind of nice.  I was dumb enough to go out with him.  I guess its a bad sign when the guy you're going to meet is about five years older and 20lbs heavier than his pic huh?  

Anyway it wasn't a great date.  We went to Flatiron Crossing and just sat there not saying much.  We didn't have much in common.  I know its half my fault because I'm shy.  We ended up going to the Cold Stone and I paid.  I finally took him home and he was all trying to get me to go in and by then I just didn't really want to.

So that was the date.  

I didn't really do anything today.  I sat and watched TV and opened every single window I could find because I love cold weather.  Its so nice and cloudy here.  I don't like the wind but the rest is so nice.  But yea I didn't do anything much.  Slept in.  Got some food and walked around campus a little bit.  Tonight I'm going to Delirium with my parents and family.  I hope it'll be good, everybody says it is.  

Later,
Will"

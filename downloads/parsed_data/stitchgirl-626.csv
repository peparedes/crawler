"event","The Incredibly Short says:
Okay, I got your note.
The Incredibly Short says:
And it confused me greatly. I think I need to explain some things to you that I haven't yet.. ^^;
The Incredibly Short says:
Okay, first off. I am so incredibly sorry if it seems like I haven't been being that great of a friend to you and that I've been totally disregarding your existence for Destiny's.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Nonono.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
You're fine. I'm happy that you've made more friends.
The Incredibly Short says:
Sarah, the only reason I never decided to talk to you about my more personal problems was because I was under the impression that you didn't want to hear them and didn't like dealing with everybody's drama. oo;
The Incredibly Short says:
I didn't know you actually wanted to help me.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Of course I do.
The Incredibly Short says:
Well, I mean, I knew you would help me if I asked, but..
Ninja Band Klutz says:
I want to help my friends.
The Incredibly Short says:
I thought it best not to bother you. I must've been wrong.
The Incredibly Short says:
And, about everybody being pissed off at you during lunch? You lost me there. ^^;
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Never mind that.
The Incredibly Short says:
I mean, besides the fact that you were pretty upset with me when I left you, I never said anything about that.. That wasn't even the reason I was crying outside.
The Incredibly Short says:
Oh. And there's a big part of it you missed.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Hm?
The Incredibly Short says:
Okay, so, I told Destiny just to tell him to completely forgot I ever did anything, right..? Went over, talked to you, you got upset, I felt bad, five minutes later, Destiny's done and walks up to me..
The Incredibly Short says:
I forgot exactly what she said, but she just told me what Brian told her. He wants somebody that would 'fight for him'. I was about to fall over onto the ground. But then, then.. you know what she says?
The Incredibly Short says:
""Olivia, I don't know why you're crying, because you should be feeling like the luckiest girl in the world right now."" - At first, I didn't understand what the hell she was talking about. Today sucked, everything seemed to be going wrong, but she explained to me..
The Incredibly Short says:
""He told me he likes somebody that everybody in the group knows, has for a while, and he's liked her for longer than he has Sheila."" I forgot some things after that, but then she told me.. ""And it's upsetting him because she's always So. Damn. Depressed.""
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Alright.. Olivia? There's something... I think I should tell you now.
The Incredibly Short says:
...More bad news?
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Yes.
The Incredibly Short says:
Fuck.
The Incredibly Short says:
Wait.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Yeah, be right back.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Soon.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Let me know when you're ready for it.,
Ninja Band Klutz says:
I'll read the letter to you that I wrote in Math.. but I wasn't going to give it to you until after you talked to him.
The Incredibly Short says:
You know.. just when you think you've figured everything out.. Sigh. Do I even want to know what you're going to tell me? Or do I already know?
Ninja Band Klutz says:
I don't think you know.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
And I don't know if you want to know. It will probably upset you. But... if you really want to know the truth, maybe.
The Incredibly Short says:
Do you have to tell me today?
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Not if you don't want me to.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
I've already typed it up, but it isn't up to me anymore if you want to read it.
The Incredibly Short says:
..I don't want you to tell me.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
I was just.. hoping that I wouldn't be the one to tell you. And that you would be the one to figure it out yourself.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Okay.
The Incredibly Short says:
No. Just.. just tell me it isn't worth it anymore. And I'll move on. Okay?
Ninja Band Klutz says:
You know I wouldn't be able to tell you something like that.
The Incredibly Short says:
Why?
The Incredibly Short says:
When that's the truth?
Ninja Band Klutz says:
But my opinion on this whole thing? Even if you really did love him, I don't understand why someone would want to constantly be around another for the rest of their lives... for what? For whatever you call ""love""?
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Be your own person.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
You shouldn't need someone else to just be.. you. Olivia.
The Incredibly Short says:
But I am my own person.. Rather, I thought I was..
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Exactly.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Most people.. they think that they NEED a relationship to be complete.
The Incredibly Short says:
Man.. this is upsetting me already and I don't even know what it is you were going to tell me. I never want to know. Not after all of this. Maybe in a few years, when I could actually handle it without having to cry in a corner for the next 30 minutes. They do say ignorance is bliss, right? I don't want this hurt anymore. It isn't worth it.
The Incredibly Short says:
And to think.. I wasted an entire journal on this. That just amazes me.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
But think about it, we've got all of our lives to live. We've got the rest of our lives to really find someone.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Why NOW? I don't know about you, but all I really want to do is make it out of school alive.
The Incredibly Short says:
That makes sense.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Friends are also important.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
But... until he comes, then why bother?
Ninja Band Klutz says:
I'm perfectly fine living my life without a relationship.
The Incredibly Short says:
Eh.. it was foolish of me to think otherwise... That I could actually find somebody smart in this god forsaken school. At age 14. Somebody who might've cared or understood it all. That's unrealistic. More unrealistic than the kids I see in relationships right now, I think..
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Yeah. When people actually come out of their holes... the holes that they THOUGHT was the real world. Then, just maybe.
The Incredibly Short says:
So, what should we do? Go back to the library? Just not be around the group anymore? Leave it? This isn't good for us if we just stick around and have to deal with the rest of this crap. I don't care if we only have 4 weeks left.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Hm. Does it really matter?
The Incredibly Short says:
...Hell, we aren't even a group anymore. I don't know what happened with that.
The Incredibly Short says:
Does it? I don't know, either.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Hell, we can start our own mad skillz group.
The Incredibly Short says:
Yes. I would love that.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
brb. Yelling at Malia.
The Incredibly Short says:
My mom keeps telling me I look worn out. Doesn't suprise me. -_-
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Yeah.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
You know. We should really go to the mall Thursday to get this crap off our minds.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
And then go see that play again.
The Incredibly Short says:
That sounds like a good idea.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Okay. Katie says she'll go to the play.
The Incredibly Short says:
Yay..
Ninja Band Klutz says:
So are Ariel and Chelsea.
The Incredibly Short says:
Yay. ^^
Ninja Band Klutz says:
..oh, and would you mind typing another journal entry so I can have something to read? XD
The Incredibly Short says:
But I was going to use our conversations. >>
Ninja Band Klutz says:
That's fine too.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Hi other people who read Olivia's journal!
The Incredibly Short says:
XD
Ninja Band Klutz says:
My name is Sarah.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
And I have come here today to explain why people are stupid.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
That is because.. .everyone has their own reason, so there isn't really an answer to that.
The Incredibly Short says:
Indeed.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Okay. Olivia can post this now because I'm going to die from the heat of my garage if I don't get something to drink soon.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Have a nice day!
The Incredibly Short says:
..Oh.
The Incredibly Short says:
And when I accidently got kicked off MSN, I lost the majority of our conversation. I need the entire window from you, if you hadn't closed it yet.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
I haven't.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
One more thing.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
If you're trying to break the ice from a frozen water bottle.. don't throw it across the room. It will only break something.
Ninja Band Klutz says:
Okay, now I'm done."

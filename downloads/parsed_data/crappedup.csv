"event","<p>It's ridiculous how I have continued this flirtation with basketball for over a decade now. From the day we first met, I'd known, it wasn't going to last. There was no happily ever after in this story. </p><p>There were moments where I was filled with hope, that maybe, just maybe, we could work it out, we could last forever. I had allowed myself such wishful thinking. But there were also times where I only felt despair, the unwavering certainty that this was not meant to be. Yet I kept returning. Again and again.

That's just me. And so I accept that we have to part ways, but you know, you will always be my first love.</p>"

"event","My brain is like a fat juicy leaf. The stomata all over it opens and closes absorbing information from the environment. Inside the leaf itself, mitochondria work hard to produce energy for the absorption process, and I store everything in the neat little vacuoles. It is always a flurry of activity inside, a constant synthesizing and processing of information. Lately, however, it seems I have met a ravenous caterpillar. My brain feels like it is full of holes. I would desire to express a particular thought, but mid-sentence I would hit a solid wall. Except the wall feels less like a dependable brick wall, but more like the edge of a cliff with a sheer drop. As if my next word will find me falling into an abyss where that particular thought will be irretrievably lost. In an attempt to battle against the caterpillar (We WON&#39;T go down without a fight!), I sit quietly and empty my heart and reach my hand out over the cliff. After about five minutes of searching in the darkness, the thought grasps my hand quietly and I pull it back up. We look at each other with a quiet understanding that this time we managed to patch the hole, but we knew that a patched leaf is never the same again.

At the very least we can hope that the caterpillar might turn into a butterfly.&nbsp;"

Even so, who's to say what's ordinary and what's extraordinary. I'm just lying on the spectrum and I suppose so are you. Giving up, on the other hand, is not so much a spectrum but a distinct choice like a fork in the road. Perhaps when you or I fall so far off the spectrum, one of us would choose to give up.</p>"

"event","Some times I wonder exactly how much gets lost in translation.&nbsp;Increasingly I find myself thinking in Chinese. It comes more naturally than before, but still!&nbsp;I am bilingual only to a certain extent and I can never be as articulate as I can be in English. Around a native speaker, I feel like my Chinese is so primitive, so raw and unpolished.

In face to face interactions, it is possible to read body language and facial expressions to assess whether the other party had understood what I had meant to convey. It is a good deal more difficult now that we don&#39;t have the luxury of that. Well, just another problem to write down, fold up and toss into the ever growing jar of problems.

What should have been a short remark escalated into a furious blitzkrieg of stunted phrases that must have made no sense. Does it really matter though? At the end of the day, words are just words, it is the intentions that count. After all, no words can hurt me if the content is true. No words can charm me if they are hollow. And no words can explain this insurmountable attraction between two blazing suns."

"event","I have been trying to start on this retrospection of 2012 for the longest time. I figured I would force it out somehow before it&#39;s time for 2013&#39;s. I keep thinking I haven&#39;t thought about this enough, but the truth is there would never be time enough to figure out 2012. But through snippets of conversation, I think I have managed to gain some perspective.

Well, what a year. Words do not seem to do justice to what I feel and so I have been writing and rewriting this over and over again.

Spirals. I keep wondering if I am going round and round in some intergalactic space-time continuum. The whole thing feels like one giant Narnia-esque trip. It&#39;s like adventures and pirate ships and then BAM! I&#39;m back in the drone of things. Basketball, school, hall shit. It was IVP when I left, it was IVP when I came back. Nothing has changed. (Other than the fact that I&#39;m now fat.) And that really unsettles me. Because I am a different person from when I left.

Organization. At the end of every major project, I will clear my desktop and put files in folders where they belong. Life kind of feels a little like that now. My stories have become just that, stories. I see things in lines and boxes now. No more fuzzy squiggles and strange floating animals. Oh the animals come back some times. Loose ends that haven&#39;t been tied. But it feels good to be able to herd them into boxes. I guess I achieved what I set out to do when I said I&#39;ll be going away. I really needed that extended period of time alone to figure myself out.&nbsp;

I will miss 2012. It wouldn&#39;t be because of all the friends, fun, love, joy, food, drunk nights, parties. There will be so much more of those to come. It wouldn&#39;t be all the heartbreak, tears, pain, anger, self-deprecation, self-pity. They shape my life, but I don&#39;t want to ever be that hurt again. What I would miss about 2012 are the long and lonely walks I took every so often, the days where I sat at bars alone, the fancy meals I had with myself, the endless conversation with no one in particular, the solo trips to strange new places and meeting strange new faces. The feeling of being all alone in a foreign country, so vulnerable, so exposed. I will miss that. Because those were the best nights, the nights where I felt most alive."

"event","When faced with adversity, my first instinct is to run in the opposite direction. Is it wiser to stay and fight? 

Fight or flight (or freeze)? How is it like in nature? I guess the typical alpha male would respond with aggression. And a typical female's natural response would be to flee. Unless she's protecting her young. Of course there are many other ways to respond when provoked, but if we were to reduce it to fight or flight, I suppose I could put it this way, to survive fleeing is sufficient. As long as you can outrun your predator. But to thrive you really need to fight. To input this mechanism into a non-alpha male like myself, the best way is to find some thing you treasure dearly and hold onto that one thing really tightly.

Now, to find my one special baby."

Today there was such a moment. In that one moment, I was lucid. Looked a bit like a full stop, could have been a semi-colon. But without a doubt, it was more definitive punctuation than ""...""

The closure (or at least semi-closure) to one thing brings about freedom to many others. Perhaps this Sunday would be the start of something new? About time I stepped out."

"event","Sitting at the lobby of one of the nice MBA buildings in Fudan. There's good wifi here and I'm attempting to finish the slides for my presentation in class tomorrow. An utter waste of time, but it must be done. Class was uneventful as usual, except there was a case discussion and despite not having read the case or even know there was a discussion beforehand, I managed to participate very actively. As it turns out, I had already read the case before and I had even prepared a very comprehensive set of powerpoint slides on it. See, this is a waste of my time. What is an even bigger waste of time, is me writing on how much of a waste of time it is.

But sometimes you just need to vent, and then after that you can get on with life. 

Went to Suzhou with a colleague over the weekend, a local colleague. It was honestly a good experience for me. It is just nice to hear fresh perspectives of life. He has taken a 71 hour train ride, standing all the way, with next to no space to move. That deserves some respect man.

As we walked and walked under the hot sun (and we walked A LOT), I thought about my attitudes and feelings towards Chinese nationals before coming here. Some of it remains, but a lot has changed. People are just people in the end, regardless of nationality, race, language, religion, sexuality, education, what have you. And I guess it's good that I sort of just landed in China, that one country I said I would NEVER go voluntarily, because now, nothing's gonna stop me. 

I started this post wanting to talk about how I feel that I don't belong anywhere. Here in Shanghai, I feel mildly alienated from every ""group"" that I come into contact with. But really, after thinking through this rationally, I realized that this feeling isn't limited to Shanghai. Maybe I'm just an individual. Or maybe I just haven't found where I belong yet. Whatever it is, what is more important is that I have come to feel comfortable in my own skin. A recent occurrence. Occasionally, I might crave to belong somewhere, but it is never enough to push me over the edge such that I compromise my own beliefs. 

So tonight, I will just do what is me. And not because I need to belong somewhere."

"event","Today, I had the most honest moment I have had with myself in a long long time. Someone asked me today, ""So, wait... are you...?"" Awkward question meets awkward answer. And that awkward answer is as close to the truth as it can get. ""I don't know, I really don't."" It's funny how life makes you go right out of your comfort zone, cross 2361 miles and spend four years of your time just to tell you that you really don't know anything. 

The past week saw me close many chapters of my own book, culminating today, where finally all chapters are done and dusted. Somewhere inside of me it must be hurting because tears flow freely, but I can't help but smile at the irony of it all. Somewhere out there, someone is putting pen to paper and writing this story that I'm in, laughing at how clever they are for using all these literary devices. Joke's on me. 

So here I am shivering in the cold, and thinking fuck it, I'm gonna stab them in the eye with their own pen and I will write my own literary masterpiece. Here's to starting over and maybe I will finally know something."

I love being close to the local sights and sounds. Can't wait to stay there and explore the area.

"event","It never really hit me why Lady Gaga would call Born This Way her best song ever. I mean I know all the reasons and arguments behind it, but it is one thing to know, and another thing to feel it. When she started playing the organ, and belting out that one very significant verse of Born This Way, I had goosebumps all over. At that moment it just really hit home. How significant this must be for her!. Bringing such a message into popular culture, making it mainstream, making it the main act. That is the triumph. It is everything she stands for. I love how the whole thing is so poetic, and how she is all her art. I think that's why I can't get enough."

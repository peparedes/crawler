"event","hmm.... i'm thinking about growing my hair out a little.... I mean... i love my fucking mohawk; i think it's hot. but i'm getting bored with my hair. I need to do something else with it. it annoys me when it stays the same too long.. but yeah. 
     Hmm.... there's not much that i can actually update about.. so i'll come back later. k?

"event","Ha.. I'm actually sitting in class right now. I normally don't get the chance to use the computers in school.. but since my teacher has us on the laptops and we're supposed to be doing reports for black history month.... i figured ""why not be a little irresponsible and update the damn live journal that i never get to update?""
     So.. here I am. Alive and..well... i guess i'm doing alright. got in touch with someone that i havent talked to in about a year.. got in touch with a friend from kindergarten..yeah.. i know strange.. got my tongue pierced.. got girls after me... what more could i be asking for? actually... i'd like to take some time to get to know some of these girls... not the really young ones.. heh.. but the ones that are actually around my age. 
     I'm going to meet the <i><b>GORGEOUS</b></i> &hearts; Frankie Davis next Saturday in NYC. I'm really excited about that. she's fucking gorgeous.. she's been through a lot of shit.. i think i can officially say that she's one of my favorite SuicideGirls... i hope that her set gets approved soon so that i can see it :D. I'm going to start talking to a few more of them and get to know them. They're amazing girls and I've known about them for fucking YEARS... I'm enthralled by them. 
     My mohawk is fading and my roots are growing in like... super-fast.. i need to re dye it blue and i think i'm going to but some... tigerlily and virgin snow manic panic.. i'm getting bored having the one color all the time. Tongue still hurts.. lots of advil.. plans getting thwarted a LOT in the past few weeks.. can't seem to hold onto plans and i forget when i make plans and always seem to have like 3 things planned all for the same time for my weekends. I'm learning how to skate... still can't ollie.. though i'm trying really hard.. and trying not to break my neck at the same time. ha.

Well... i think i should try to actually get some work done.. i'm going to try to get onto this Godforsaken site more often to update... though.. the last journal that i remember getting to all the time was when i had my deadjournal... ehe..

CHAAAAA!!!!

"event","i'm fuckin updating! oh my shit!

I've been thinking a lot about the past and it makes me kind of sad. Friendships lost due to stupid shit.. people using me.. being walked on.. all those memories starting about 3 years ago. All down the fucking tubes. What i wouldnt do to go back to those days when everything was fucking awesome. Not that things arent cool now, i mean, i'm living with my grandparents... just broke up with my new girlfriend though... more,<b>she</b> broke up with <b>me</b>

Cutting my hair soon, if Sarah decides to come over and help me.. otherwise i'll go buy a buzzer and do it myself! ha!  Getting my tongue pierced in a couple weeks i'm hoping and i'm gonna get my nipples done next year for my 18th..YES!   then i think i'm going to take a set and send in an application for the one and only <b><i>SUICIDEGIRLS</i></b>    yummy... can't wait. Sweet christ on toast!

i bid thee adieu... this shan't be my last update.. i promise ~^

Just writing to say that the Seven Years' War is really f-ing cool. I'm writing two papers about it, and it's really got me hooked. First worldwide war, as it happens. We (the USA) probably wouldn't be around if it hadn't happened...well, okay we probably would have, but we might be more like Canadians, and who the hell wants that??&nbsp;

Anyways, one of the papers is about how the War of Austrian Succession really led to the Seven Years' War...which is a little redundant since most wars usually lead to other wars in some way. The second one is pretty cool, I'm researching the two seiges of Louisbourg up in Nova Scotia, one in 1745 conducted by New England militia and the other in 1758 by British Regulars. The militiamen actually had their shit together, seriously. In two months they mustered 4,000 guys, packed them onto 90 ships, sailed up and performed a combined arms seige of a fortified town and were successful in six weeks. Not bad for militia..."

"event","<p>So...Wednesday night's ride home from Shippensburg has to rate as one of, if not THE, most bizarre car rides of my life.<br /><br />Everything was normal 'til I made it to this bend in the road on Route 696 out near where it intersects with Route 81. I was going about 60, which is fast for that road since it's windy and not well lit, but I do that all the time, so I was figuring 'what the hell.' As I come around this curve, there's also a little depression in the road, so you can't see what's immediately beyond it. Anyways, I hit this curve, crest the little depression, and there's a goddamn cat right in front of me. I screech the brakes as hard as I can (good thing no one was behind me!), but I know I am hitting this cat one way or the other. Fortunately, the cat had just enough time to react and went under the middle of the car instead of being hit by the wheels. Even so, I heard that sick thumping noise under the car, and I figured it was dead. So I went up a ways further and I doubled back, because I felt bad and wanted to see if it was dead. Well, it wasn't where I hit it, so I at least didn't kill it instantly or wound it so severely that it couldn't leave the road. Thinking this would be the freakish occurrence of my trip home, I set off again for Gettysburg.<br /><br />Well, I was wrong. About a 20 minutes later, as I'm driving across that two or three mile long plain after you exit Cashtown on Rt. 30 heading towards Gettysburg, something else happened, and this one almost ended in me dying as well as an animal (or in this case, two animals). Out of nowhere, two motherfucking deer decide to bound into the road just as my car is driving towards them. Smart fucking animals...I was going about 65 here, so hitting a deer at that speed could easily have been lights out forever. One of the deer makes it past my car into the other lane of the road, missing by inches. The other deer hesitates and stops just short of my car on the other side. There was probably all of six feet between the two deer, and my car went right through that space. So...yeah...needless to say, I am a little pissed off at the wildlife in Pennsylvania right now, although I still hope the cat is okay.</p>"

"event","Yesterday made me fully appreciate how much I loathe this town. 

On top of having a headache and the beginnings of a cold, I think yesterday had to be the worst day of work since I was at Regimental Quartermaster. Ignorant tourists, screaming children who can't keep their goddamn paws off of anything, and parents too weak-willed to discipline said children. 

But by far the worst was of all people a German biker, which reaffirms that of all the people that visit this town, bikers are by far my most hated. Anyways, this German biker comes in and starts looking at the fake Luger we have sitting in the case. He asks me to take it out of the case so he can see it. I can barely understand a word he's saying what with the thick German accent and some sort of speech impediment along with it. So I get him the Luger (doesn't fire for real), and he wants to buy it. So I go and look for one in the stock, which we don't have. I tell him the display piece is the last one, and this sets off a five or ten minute argument over what he is going to pay for the damned thing. Apparently, he thinks the USA is just like Europe, where people haggle for prices before they buy things. I told him I am not authorrized to do that, and if I do my manager can see it on the register tape and I will get in trouble. Well, of course this guy didn't care about me getting in trouble, and he would not drop the issue when I said no. He was so persistent I had to raise my voice at him, which I have never had to do in all the years I've worked in retail here. For five minutes at least I was telling him I couldn't sell it for less than the marked price, and he just would not accept that. In addition, between his individual arguments that he should get a deal on the thing, he was mocking my stubbornness and accusing me of being a poor salesman. I was two seconds from telling him to go to hell and get the fuck out of my store, but finally he relented and said to just sell it to him without charging him tax. I figured I'd just sell it to him for full price and tax included, but just tell him I took the tax off. And he was dumb enough to buy it, so that finally got him out of the store. 

For about 20 minutes. He comes back in after 20 minutes and says that its broken. I am very short with him at this point. I take the thing out of the box, and check all the working parts. It's a little sluggish, but they still work fine. Then I give it back to him and he tries, and he's manhandling the fucking thing. I was thinking, well no wonder its not working right when you're manhandling the fucking thing, it's not made like a real gun. It will break much easier. I told him we don't do refunds, and he turned about and walked away.&nbsp; 

So, chalk up Reason #1344 for why I hate this town."

"event","First and foremost, I just want to say that my disdain for the South has grown leaps and bounds since starting to work for the New Place. Just today, there were several Southern people in, and when one of them came to the counter to pay for her items, she expressed interest in a weird pseudo-painting of America/freedomville Patriot crap, which had a silhouette of Lincoln on it. Well, she noticed Lincoln, and that was the end of THAT. I know Old Abe has never been too popular in the South, but why is everyone hating on him all the sudden?? If anything, he was one of the most fair and reasonable men that have ever had the honor to be President. But hey, cling to an old, racist dream that never had any chance of going anywhere to begin with, and while you're at it, scapegoat the one man with any degree of power who wanted to take it easy on the South when it became clear the North would win the war.

As George Carlin said of the South, ""I have trouble understanding Southerners. Some of them sound like they're chewing on a dick. And I really have nothing against them individually; one by one they can be quite charming. But when you take them as a whole, there's some really dangerous genetic material floating around down there.""

Yeah, but today was interesting. The top marks go to the couple who came in, picked up the set of old timey handcuffs we had, and asked if they worked. When shown that they would, they promptly bought not one, but TWO pairs of handcuffs. I fear I just sold perfectly good old timey handcuffs to a freakish bondage couple who will use them in their crazy, scary, and down-right disturbing fetish parties.

Work is okay. There's a guy there who is a real pain to work with, but other than that I don't have anything too serious to complain about. They have some really archaic ways of doing things, but you get used to them. They used similar methods at Regt. Quartermaster, if I remember correctly. The crazy guy comes to work in his Confederate uniform everday, and what he says to customers kind of frightens me. Not like fear for my life frightened, but really hoping that the tourists won't buy into the bullshit he's spouting frightened. Just to give you a glimpse into the crap he shoots, listen to this little gem: He thinks that Abraham Lincoln was a despot in the mold of Adolph Hitler (exact words), and he wishes the South had won, because if they had, it would be a place of morals, where no one would have to lock their doors or look over their shoulders, and no one would be allowed to have abortions, and gun control wouldn't even be an issue, because everyone would own a gun and there would be no crime. Yeah. And from what I can tell, he's actually serious.

Other than that, the money situation is not good. These last two months without a job really hurt. On the plus side, my hockey team seems sure of making the playoffs, and those are always fun to watch. School should be starting back up in May, if I get into the summer course at Ship. If all works out, I'll be more than halfway done by Christmas. w00t!"

I worked in the Stoneham's Armory place, which actually has quite a few guns and swords and stuff that I found interesting, if not exactly accurate. Mostly I worked with the Rhodesian dude, and he was cool. It didn't take much teaching to get me to understand stuff, seeing as Greystone's operated almost exactly the same.

Surprisingly, though, he left me to hold down the fort on my own, on my first day. No problems arose, I was just surprised. Plus, I got incredibly bored. If every day is like that, I'd almost be willing to take a pay cut so they could afford to hire someone just to keep their current employees company. Who wants 25 cents an hour to alleviate my boredom? 

So, most of the day I either stared off into space or tinkered with the guns and swords and stuff. I think I'll try to sneak a book in with me next time."

"event","I feel like a whore. I just went to Ye Olde Greystone's Place and applied for a job. Then, I looked around the new store. I immediately regretted applying, but need money drastically.

The first thing that spooked me was the old lady who was working the counter in the Habitat place where I actually applied. She seemed like the kind of woman who is filled with spite, but covers it up with a fake happy countenance. One particular gem was when I mentioned that I used to work in the bookstore, and it brought on all sorts of horror stories about ""how dirty that place was when we took over."" ""I swear, did anyone over there know what a broom or mop was?"" (Loretta, Becky, and Betty would love that one, after sweeping that place for three days straight). So, I just laughed nervously while the creepy fairies and gnomes looked at Val and I as I filled out the application.

Then I decided, why the hell not go over and see what the new place looks like. Bad idea. But good that I applied before I went in there, seeing as I never would have applied having seen the inside of that store. The first thing to tip me off should have been the ghost tour sign, but I was thinking ""Meh, I've worked with them before at Regimental."" Well, the inside of that place looks really creepy and empty. They painted it pinkish something, which makes me think ""Red rum, red rum"", but with old timey telescopes and flags. The one item they had that weirded us out the most was the SOUP in old timey labels and cans. WTF are they selling soup for? 

Overall, it looked like they bought a store clearly designed to be a book store, but they don't want to use it for that purpose, and now they're thinking ""What the hell do we do with this place??""

Thinking it was fine when I left, I started to get worried, because I did leave the baseboard heaters in my room on and that its relatively (but not dangerously) close to the trash can in my room. I started to freak out in my head because I thought I might have set my apartment on fire!

The hockey game was cool, it was the NY Islanders vs. the Devils. Islanders won. It was a good game to an impartial viewer such as myself, with no allegiance to either team.

Then, in another weird incident, as we were driving home through the snowstorm, on Rt. 81 we were going through Hershey when all the sudden I spotted this huge orange glow on the left side of the highway.

"event","Well, this was a fun weekend, and busier than pretty much any since work ended. Spent most of it at Speedy and Kara's, since it was Hardtack Meeting weekend. Probably the highlight of that was BLOWING STUFF UP! Lol, as much as I deride hillbilly rednecks, I do share quite a few pastimes with them...too many for comfort. But honestly, who can resist watching stuff explode?? Wish I'd gotten to shoot, but alas it was too rainy.

The neeting was ok, if a little long, but I'm actually looking forward to a lot of events this year, which hasn't happened in as long as I can remember. As of right now, I'm probably looking forward to Neshaminy the most, and that's because some of us are going as dismounted cavalry. WEEWAHOOEY! I get to take my pistol to an event for the first (and probably only) time ever. That event should definitely cure me of my powder-burning withdrawal. Haha, and there are those hillbilly activities again...

On a separate note, heating costs are absolutely fucked up. I spent 141 dollars on electric last month, and I turned off all my baseboard heaters except for the one in my room, and this month's bill was still $100...WTF?? So basically, I'm living in a freezing apt. that I can't afford to heat. Fun. At least there's a few more jobs to apply to this week.

Ok, I'm out."

Most of it comes from thatvideosite.com, they've got some funny stuff on there, if you aren't too offended by the billions of porn ads that are there (not pop-ups, just ads, so don't worry about being spammed by pop-ups).

Ok, these first few are all Conan O'Brien clips about Walker Texas Ranger. If you've never seen these, you should, they're hysterical. :D

<P>If you can see Robert E. Lee, he can see you. If you can't see Robert E. Lee, you may be just seconds away from death.</P>

Even if you don't like hockey or sports, that is just an amazing display of skill, and by a rookie. I would not be at all surprised if this is the most amazing goal all season. The 'Sidney who?' at the end refers to the other top rookie this year, Sidney Crosby. Crosby plays for Pittsburgh, and he's a whiny, retaliatory diving bitch."

I got back to town the other day and noticed that the florist shop that has the four kitties that sit in the window all the time was being remodeled or renovated or something, 'cause there was a big wooden board over some of their windows. I was afraid the poor kitties had gone away.

But earlier today I drove by and saw Orange sitting in the window, so clearly the kitties are still there. Score!

"event","<P>Back in Gettysburg!</P>
<P>Today I will be presenting my thoughts on what could possibly be the best historical fiction novel of the Civil War. It's called Northern Lights, and it's about five young men in a boy band who get teleported back to 1862 during a concert when a bolt of lightning hits their stage equipment. They then go on to become prisoners of the Union Army, eventually meet President Lincoln, and perform for the Union Army. The climax occurs when they go to Fredericksburg just in time to witness the battle, and...you guessed it, the northern lights.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""What I loved about Northern Lights""> </P>
<P>1.) The name of their boy band: LightStar. Note that it's one word, and gay as anything they could possibly have thought up. I literally laughed for 15 minutes when I read the name of the band.</P>
<P>2.) The fact that young men aged 26, 24, 23, 20, and 18 do not swear, laugh at the cheesiest jokes imagineable, and are treated by every other character in the book as though they are half their age. </P>
<P>3.) The cheesiest ""time travel"" scene I've ever seen, read, heard about in my life. Apparently, the author thought that lightning could create a door that leads to 1862. Oh, wait, that lightning has to be combined with electrical equipment, my bad.</P>
<P>4.) One of the first ideas they have to explain their predicament is that they have time traveled. You know, it's all the rage with the boy bands these days...lol.</P>
<P>5.) Apparently, Union cavalry patrols keep shackles on them at all times, in case they come upon some time traveling singers and have to arrest them without cause or provocation, which also appears to be standard operating procedure amongst Union cavalry.</P>
<P>6.) Briggs, the twelve year old Union soldier who takes a liking to the LightStar guys. Apparently the fact that he's twelve doesn't bother anyone in his unit, or President Lincoln for that matter. Lincoln seems to have a penchant for using young boys as his courier to and from the LightStar fellows.</P>
<P>7.) The fact that, as the book progresses, we see that literally everyone on the North American continent knows who Major Thomas is. As far as I can tell, he was a one-dimensional secondary character, and yet without being told who he is, men all over the country, from Fredericksburg to Elmira, NY seem to know who he is. Even President Lincoln knows who he is. The sad part is, that after reading the book, I don't know who he is...</P>
<P>8.) The girl that the Southern LightStar members shack up with, who's parents were killed by Union troops because they dared to resist the efforts of the soldiers to take some food. Boy, if I had a dollar for every time THAT happened in the Civil War, man...I'd have about 20 dollars, tops. ;)</P>
<P>9.) The amusing way the Federals set up camp at Fredericksburg. According to the book, there was a sniper's lair lodged right square between the Federal camp and Burnside's Headquarters. Observe this image to see what I mean. Poor little Briggs (the 12 yr. old) was shot off his horse in there, and only the Superman pendant that one of the LightStar guys gave to him saved his life. It was a gutwrenching scene. </P>
<P><U><FONT color=#0000ff><A href=""http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/2263/nlreviewpic9hv.png"">http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/2263/nlreviewpic9hv.png</A></FONT></U><A href=""http://img517.imageshack.us/my.php?image=nlreviewpic9hv.png""></A></P>
<P>10.) The ending. It leaves this story open to so many options. We already know that a sequel is on its way, and I for one cannot wait. I urge you to find one of the six or so known copies of this book and read it. It will change your life.&nbsp; ;)</P>"

He's way better than Chris Rock, who I can't stand 'cause he never lets go of the race card. So that's a bonus. Plus I am going to see the New Jersey Devils take on the Philadeplhia Flyers with Val on Monday, when I go to NJ, so that should be super dooper.</P>
<P>On the negative side of things, I am no longer going to CT for Terri's shindig tomorrow. It has been cancelled as her grandmother has gotten sick. So best wishes to her and her grandmother, but now I have a free weekend to fill up with...something.</P>
<P>Maybe I'll work on Sunday, if that's still happening. Otherwise tomorrow would be my last day. It might not have been the best job I've ever had, but I'll admit I'll miss it. It was easy as hell (and reflected it by the pay...) but I enjoyed everyone I got to work with, 'cept for Dave. That guy was a creep. So buena suerte to those of us still looking for jobs...which I think is essentially just Loretta and myself since Becky and Nate have new jobs, and Jim is being set up with something, and Betty is well...just old. Maybe she'll retire. </P>"

"event","<P>I have read about World War I before, but I never really noticed the huge amount of poetry, good poetry, that came out of that war. Not propagandized, idealistic poetry, but stuff from the guys in teh trenches. I find it reallt striking and haunting that it captures the essence of that war so well. I can't think of any other war that a) produced so much poetry by combatants involved, and b) relates the futility and pointlessness, or any other aspect, of the war it's about. Here's a few examples:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Great War Poetry""> </P>
<P><STRONG>Rupert Brook:</STRONG></P>
<P>excerpt from ""The Soldier""</P>
<P><EM>If I should die, think only this of me:</EM></P>
<P><EM>That there's some corner of a foreign field</EM></P>
<P><EM>That is forever England.</EM></P>
<P>Brook wrote this in 1914, when war fever was running high. By the end of 1914, he was dead.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Seigried Sassoon:</STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>""Good morning, good morning!"" the General said</EM></P>
<P><EM>When we met him last week on our way to the line.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Now the soldiers he smiled at are most of 'em dead,</EM></P>
<P><EM>And we're cursing his staff for incompetent swine.</EM></P>
<P><EM>""He's a cheery old card,"" grunted Harry to Jack</EM></P>
<P><EM>As they slogged up to Arras with rifle and pack.</EM></P>
<P><EM></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Wilfred Owen:</STRONG></P>
<P><EM>Gas! Gas! Quick, boys! -- an ecstasy of fumbling,</EM></P>
<P><EM>Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;</EM></P>
<P><EM>But someone was still yelling out and stumbling,</EM></P>
<P><EM>And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime...</EM></P>
<P><EM>Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,</EM></P>
<P><EM>As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.</EM></P>
<P><EM>In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,</EM></P>
<P><EM>He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.</EM></P>
<P><EM>If in some smothering dreams you too could pace</EM></P>
<P><EM>Behind the wagon that we flung him in,</EM></P>
<P><EM>And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,</EM></P>
<P><EM>His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;</EM></P>
<P><EM>If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood</EM></P>
<P><EM>Come gargling from froth-corrupted lungs</EM></P>
<P><EM>Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud</EM></P>
<P><EM>Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, --</EM></P>
<P><EM>My friend, you would not tell with such high zest</EM></P>
<P><EM>To children ardent for some desperate glory,</EM></P>
<P><EM>The old lie: Dulce et decorum est</EM></P>
<P><EM>Pro patria mori.</EM></P>
<P>'Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori' translated from Latin means 'It is a sweet and seemly thing to die for one's country.' Wilfred Owen would die leading his men in a charge one week before Armistice Day, 1918.</P>"

"event","Ok, so I am sitting in work today, and in the first half hour I had to deal with two customers who upon learning that the store was closing next week were wailing and lamenting a little too much given the fact that it's just a small bookstore in south-central PA. One guy even slammed his fist on the counter. I think that given the other problems in the world, a loss of one bookstore is a relatively small problem...I'm sure these same people moaning about the store closing will just go on to Amazon to get their books from now on. Oh well, at least they aren't as bad as the woman who takes literally an hour to decide if she wants something or not."

To back it up, O'Rielly shows a clip of Samantha Bee saying something about Christmas in a sarcastic tone.

I think you'd have to see the video to get the complete hilarity of all of it. Go to www.comedycentral.com and scroll down to the Videos, and click on ""Secular Central.""

God, I hate Bill O'Rielly.

"event","Sorry to take up more friends pages...but I have to express frustration at this:


Vin Deisel has announced that he will make a movie about Hannibal (not Lecter, the Carthaginian military genius of the 2nd Punic War who nearly brought the Roman Republic to it's knees.) All I have to say is:

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo......

I can picure it now, Vin (who wants to direct it, and act in it as Hannibal) will want the elephants CGIed to be like 80 feet tall. When the Romans get attacked by them they'll literally explode (with fire too, because as we all know napalm elephants were the crux of the Carthaginian armies). It'll be XXX ancient style with the guise of historical accuracy! It'll be...a sham!"

"event","Well, I've been doing some imDB-ing in my spare time today, and the cast for Flags of Our Fathers is both interesting and worrisome. I'm sure the girls will love this, simply because it has almost every teen heart throb you can imagine in it...which is what has me a little worried. Usually those guys don't act very well, they just look pretty to the ladies.

Anyways, the main six are these guys:

Doc Bradley (the main character I would guess): Ryan Philippe (meh)
Ira Hayes: Adam Beach (remember the Navajo dude Nic Cage had to babysit in Windtalkers? Yeah, thats him...and I thought he sucked in Windtalkers.)
Mike Strank: Barry Pepper (haha, he's in every war movie ever. Think the sniper from Saving Private Ryan.)
Franklin Sousley: Joseph Cross (he actually looks like Sousley, and he's only 19. Bonus considering most of these guys are in their late 20s.)
Rene Gagnon: Jesse Bradford (the dude from Swimfan.)
GAH! No Harlon Block to be found. That's not good, I don't see how they could cut him...

Other notable characters/actors:

Haha! Guess who's back. Neal McDonough is Capt. Dave Severance. He was Buck Compton in BoB.
Robert Patrick (T-1000 from Terminator 2) is Lt. Col. Chandler Johnson.
Paul Walker (Fast and the Furious...the white guy) is Hank Hansen.

That's a lot of prettyboys for a movie about Marines on Iwo Jima, but I bet Clint Eastwood (the director) can whip them into shape. I bet that'll ""make his day.""

Yeah, that was retarded, but I went there ;)"

"event","Well, this is one of those events in life that I deem ""journal-worthy,"" and FYI those events are few and far between. Hence, how infrequently this journal is updated. Anyways, to the journal-worthy news.

As of January 1, 2006, Greystone's American History Store will be closed for business, and yours truly will be out on the street as they say. Apparently, the California fatcats have decided that we're not making them rich enough, so they're cutting their losses and sending us all bye bye. To make matters worse, the Camelot asshats next door are buying the place, ostensibly so they can peddle even more of their worthless brick-a-brack and chotchkes. Oh, and probably they'll end up running a ghost tour out of it. Or better yet, OF it! I mean, since it's haunted by about 14 ghosts. 'Cough' BULLSHIT! 'cough cough.' 

On the plus side, Jim has managed to get us all raises until it closes, and I guess we'll get some sort of severance ""package."" Plus, we can get books for dirt cheap, like 90% off, no shit. And, I guess since we're getting axed, we all can apply for unemployment pay, but I have no idea how that works, so I'll have to do some research. 

Eh, it's just a crying shame. The place has been there for 20 years (as a book store), and it's going the way of the Dodo while businesses like the touristy crap places that sell soulless merchandise to mindless customers and occasionally run a ghost tour or two on the side make a friggin killing. 

Welcome to corporate America, I guess."

"event","Ok, so here I am updating my LJ after about 2 months absence, at least. And the only reason I am is because I'm pissed!!

Can I just say...I hate working anywhere near tourists. They have to be the worst possible customers, and the reason is simple. They turn their brains off as soon as the words ""Hey honey, let's pack up the car"" are uttered. No exaggeration. If I had a dollar for every time one of those buffoons asked me ""How do you get to the miniature soldiers?"" I would have more green than Bill Gates. How can you account for this? There are signs indicating which way to them, the door to the back rooms of the store is clearly visible as soon as you step into the main room, and yet, still, they walk in...look around...don't manage to figure it out. Brains are in the off position. Just tonight, one reason why I'm pissed, by the way, a couple was in browsing, for 45 minutes...and the best part is, that 15 minutes of that was past closing, and to top it all off, they didn't even buy anything. So, I gave them a hearty ""Fuck you"" as soon as they left the store.

And another reason I'm pissed right now is because people really need to knock off this French bashing thing that is suddenly the ""in"" thing to do. Heck, even a lot of liberals hate the French, and I just want to know why? If they've done something wrong to you personally, then fine you've got a legitimate beef, but most people don't even know shit about them or their history and bash them anyways! ""The French are assholes."" Yes, so are we, in many cases. So are the North Koreans, the Iranians, just about any Arab would be an ass to any American (they're the people trying to kill us, by the way). Yet the outrage is more visible over the French. Why? Cause they didn't hop in on our little war? Neither did 2/3 of the rest of the world, why not be pissed at them? And if you don't like the war, why bitch about the French not liking it?? We saved their ass in WWII, and now they owe us for the rest of eternity? ""The French are pussies."" Ok, this is easily refuted by looking at the facts. Ever since France became the nation we know it as today, it pretty much has beat ass. Charlemagne was French. He ruled almost all of Western Europe. The French stopped the Islamic advance into Europe at the Battle of Tours. They don't do that, you might be praying to Allah today and not Jesus (or whoever). They made up a bulk of the Crusaders. They invaded and conquered England (yes, Normans are French). They fought a 100+ year war with England, and won. They saved OUR asses in the Revolutionary War. They took over all of mainland Europe under Napoleon. They fought countless colonial wars in Africa and Asia. They fought for five years in WWI, losing nearly a million men. They wussed out in WWII, so I guess because they wuss out once, they'll be pussies for all eternity. 

In short, Bill O'Rielly and his anti-French campaign can go fuck themselves. Yes, but more French champagne and then pour it in the gutters you idiots. I wish this thing had emoticons, I feel hamstrung because I can't put my mood into a little tiny yellow guy expressing some sort of emotion in the text. If I could, I would put emoticons into my research papers :)

/rant over/

Anyways, I hope everyone had a better day than I did."

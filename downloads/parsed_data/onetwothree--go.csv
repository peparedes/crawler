"event","New Orleans is about to become the lost city of Atlantis. 
It makes me sad because Anne Rice's books made me really want to go there, but Im afraid that there isnt going to be anything left after little miss category-5-160mph winds Katrina. 

Im actually really afraid for the people that live in the city and around there. God only knows what a 25 foot storm surge would do to us, but imagine being 6 ft below sea level in the first place. Jesus."

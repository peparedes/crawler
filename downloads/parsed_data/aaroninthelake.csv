But yeah... Not much new that's been going on lately. Just been doing some cleaning and job hunting... No luck so far, but I plan on having a new job soon... Hopefully something that pays something unlike my last job where I was working 50+ hours a week and only bringing in about $200... Michigan sucks for high paying jobs, but being with my Katina makes up for all of it... Anyways, if any of you know of a descent ISP out here in Michigan, let me know... I don't want to have to come to the library all the time...

Have a good one y'all!

"event","I've just been thinking a lot lately.......
I'm usually not the type to really care what others think of me, but for some reason I do....
I always try to be what everyone else wants me to be and I don't know who I am......
I try my best to get everything done to the best of my ability in a timely manner, but it doesn't feel like I do it right or fast enough...... I find myself questioning why I am here and what am I trying to do with my life..... I still don't know what I want to do with my life..... I'm only 19 and feel so confused about things..... There are only a few things that I am sure of right now.......
I know I want to finish college..... I know I want to be in Michigan with Katina........ I know I love Katina with all my heart...... I know I need to work really hard and pay off everything......
I'm just not really sure after that other than my basic needs..... (ie: food, air, water, cloths, etc.)....... 

Now, after reading all that..... If you are my friend, or somewhat know me, I want you to leave me a comment to tell me what you think about me. 

What kind of person do you feel I am?
Do you like me?
What is it about me that you bother?
Am I a burden to you sometimes?
Do I make you mad often?
How would you rate me on a scale of 1-10? (character wise)
How long have you known me?
How close do you feel we are?
Do you think i'm fat?
What do you think I can do to better myself? 
Do you think I'm depressed? If so, why?
What would you do if I were there with you right now?
How did we meet?
Do you remember our first conversation?
Do I make you happy?
How often do we talk?
Am I annoying?
Should I keep shaved, tamed, or scruffy? (my face)
How do you like my hair?
What is one thing you would change on me? (you can list more than one if you'ld like)
Where do you feel my life is going?
Do you think i'm doing the right things?
Are you tired of my questions?

I'll stop there........ I'm sure I could come up with more things to ask, but I need to get back to studying for my test.......

I love you Katina and I'm sorry about this morning....... I wish we could talk about things though instead of you hanging up on me..... I'm not saying that to pick on you or be mean, but I really prefer talking out things instead of avoiding them........ *kiss* I love you with all my heart.... Please don't forget that......

And thank you to the rest of you who fill out my questions... It means a lot to me......

"event","O how I despise the beginning of the week....... Life has been just really ruff lately....... With work and school, it's all a big headache...... I hate my job, and my school's a joke........ I don't have a car, so I can't get a better job, so I'm screwed......
ME + My job - a car + a bus + school + bills - friends = HELL!!!
*sigh*..... Why do things always have to be so hard for me? I try my best, but that doesn't seem to get me anywhere....... I need help in a bad way to get out of this rut, the only question is how......... I don't know......... I want this job to work because I know the paycheck possibilitys........... I want school to work because of all th time I have allready invested into it, but why does it have to be so hard......... Now, I understand life wasn't meant to be easy, but can't it cut me some slack? My schedule is herendous and I don't have much time for anything........ I feel bad too about last night....... Yesterday started off just like any other day....... I got up..... talked to Katina....... took a shower........ went to school........ went home......... went to work......... and yeah, but my phone was dying towards the end of the morning so I took my phone charger to work...... Now, I usually don't do this, but I really wanted to talk to Katina and I need my phone to be charged in order to talk to her........ So I take my charger and charger my phone while I'm at work...... I usually have a desk I sit at all day, but now that I'm a closer, I have to get up like every 10 minutes to take phone calls and stuff..... So I leave my charger at my desk forgetting it at the end of the night....... Long story short, my phones just about dead right now and I have no way to charge it...... I was up a good almost 2 hours trying to fix one of my chargers I had from before that broke on me........ 2 HOURS!!!........ It's not fun to play with a sautiring screw driver either..... I had to get burnt a good 50 times trying to fix the damn thing........ Not only that, but I didn't get to really talk to Katina too long last night........ I feel like a horrible boyfriend for how I acted last night.......... We could have probably talked for awhile before D's phone died on us, but we spent the time kinda arguing about pretty much a lost cause...... I couldn't do anything about my phone being dead, but that's all we seemed to talk about........ Not being to call Katina from my phone this morning killed me too...... Katina had to call me on D's phone........ *tear*.... I'm really sorry Katina....... I am........ I'm sorry about arguing last night....... I'm sorry for not calling you this morning......... I'm sorry for not being a good boyfriend....... Atleast I don't feel like i'm a good boyfriend...... I love you with all my heart though Katina........ I know you know that, but please never forget that....... You mean everything to me....... I wasn't trying to snap at you last night either..... It's just that you kept reminding me that we wouldn't be able to talk until I got to work today and it kept making me sad to hear that...... I tried to tell you how I felt and how you were making me feel when you said it, but you hung up...... I would have called back, but you told me your dad was sleeping and I didn't want to wake him up.... That's the last thing I want...... I love you Katina....... I'm sorry....... Could you ever forgive me?........
*gets on knees and begs*.........*tear*......please........
I love you.................

"event","^_^...... Just bored..... Saw some interesting facts I thought I should share on here..... Got it from myspace/my girl friend....... =p.....
I love you Katina...... ^_^

And here are the facts about sex......

1) 94% of men lie about their dick size.
According to condom manufacturers, only 6% of
men need to use extra large condoms.

2) The average man is 5 inches long when erect
(no matter what you have heard ladies, that's the
truth). (incidentally the average vaginal capactity is
only 6 inches, for you women who think you can handle
king dong)

3) 80% of American men are circumsized. Even
though Pediatrics say it is not necessary.

4) No matter what all the ads say, nothing can
make your penis grow but time (most men reach
the end of their growth by the early 20's)

5) There is no correlation between penis size and
shoe size, hand size, or nose size.

6) Blue balls does exist! It's technically
called ""prostatic congestion.""

7) Only 16% of men shave their privates.

+Some stuff on the ladies+
------------------------------

1) Only 9% of women around the globe consider
themselves ""attractive"" (20% of British women
do). 43% of women use the term ""natural"", 24% say
they have ""average"" looks, 8% prefer the
term ""feminine"", 7% say they are ""good looking"",
and 7% say they are ""cute"", and finally only 2% of
women say they are ""sexy"".

2) An estimated 85% of women wear the wrong
size bra.

3) 60% of women have had breast implants.

4) 75% of women like giving/getting oral sex.

5) 95% of women shave their privates.

+Both+
--------------------------------
1) Masturbation is healthy for both men and
women.

2) 70% of highschoolers have had sex before
they have graduated. 27% loose their virginity senior
prom night. Only 3% wait until marriage.

3) 95% of men would have sex with a girl after 1
month of dating. Only 10% of women feel this way.

+5 Reasons Why Sex is Good+
---------------------------------------------
1) It is a good workout. Sex burns about 150
calories every half an hour of it. It will lower your
cholesterol and improve breathing circulation.

2) You won't get sick. According to research if
you have sex 1-2 times a week you are less likely to
get sick.

3) You'll feel happier. You will feel a greater sense
of well-being. Women who have more sex were
clinically proven to be less depressed than women
who dont have sex.

4) Makes you look better - [ problem is, ugly people
don`t get any ]. Sex releases hormones in your which make your skin and hair softer and shinier and tone your physique.

5) (The best reason) You will live longer. Studies
prove that sex makes you live longer. Men who
had sex 1-2 times a week had half the death rate
as those who did not indulge themselves at least
once a month. It also makes you look younger. If
you have sex 3 times a week you may look up to
10 years younger than you really are.

Did You Know?
----------------------------------------
1) Having sex 3 times a week for 1 year adds up
to running 75 miles!!!!

I would had been longer, but a certain person was scared.... *puts head down*
But it has been a wonderful 6 months and I can't wait to see my wonderful girlfriend this May.
I love you Katina. With all my heart. You mean the world to me and I want everyone to know that.
Katina, I know you don't want to think too much about the future, I understand completely, but there's nothing in this world that I wouldn't do for you. No mountain to high to climb for you. No river to wide I wouldn't cross for you. No canyon to deep I wouldn't scale fo you. I want to be with you forever and there is no doubt in my mind about that. We may have our ups and downs, but there's nothing I wouldn't do to make you happy..... I would like to marry you one day if you would give me the chance..... I'ld hope to make a suitable husband for you and take care of you..... I want to start a family with you and have kids and a nice little house where ever you wanted..... We could get that Chevy Cavalier you always wanted and just go for drives together..... Take long walks together..... Stay up all night talking and being open to eachother..... I want all this so bad.... so so bad.... I know I'm not the smartest guy, or the sexiest guy, but I will love you with all my heart. I will always care about you. I will always be there for you. I just thought I should let you know that..... That is if you didn't allready know..... *kiss* I love you.....

"event","Not much to say so far about today......... Just sitting here in class bored out of my mind.......... We're supposed to have class room inspections today from the new owner of the school...... They want to make sure we're not going against the policies set by the school........ i.e. No hats, no cell phones, clean classes, doing our work, proper dress atire, and a hole bunch of other crap........ Honestly I don't care......... I'm still going to be surfing the net and seeing what's going on out there on the net......... I have 10 different pages open right now as I type and am checking all my mail, bloggers, journals, comments, everything I do online...... Even playing some games online too.......... I really should be working on the cover page of my paper, but I don't feel like it...... It's only a title page that shouldn't take me no more than 2 minutes to do......... I feel a little ill right now too.......... I've been feeling like this for awhile and apparently some stomach flu has been going around at work....... It sucks........ If one person gets sick in that little ass office, everyone gets sick......... And instead of staying home or going home when there sick, they stay there and still work and get everyone else sick.......... It's freaken ridiculous........ Also, I was sending texts to my roomate to see what's going on this weekend....... I really need to find an apartment now or else i'm stuck in this stupid college housing program, not only that, because everyone in my apartment is pretty much moving, if I stayed, I would have to move all my stuff anyways...... It's a pain....... So I'm trying to see if my roomate will be able to give me a ride on Saturday to this apartment place and I get a ""maybe""..... I can't do a maybe... I need a yes or a no......... I'll most likely just end up taking the bus because I don't like flakes like him....... It's not nice to promise something and go back on your promise....... I know I'm not being too nice about the situation, but i'm really tired of being lied too...... It's bad enough most people walk all over me because I'm too kind to them........ Does everyone really want me to be an asshole to them? Just wondering........ I don't even think I could do that if I tried, but I feel bad....... I know I'm going to snap at one of my friends one day for something little and am going to feel horrible about it....... It's not good to hold all this emotion in........ But I have no choice..... I'm just not the type of person to complain to you for not caring....... It's just how I am....... I do talk to my girlfriend about most of this stuff, but I really don't like to think about it....... It just makes me all depressed.......... It's funny how people don't appreciate the things you do for them no matter how much you do for them.......... Katina knows what i'm talking about.......... I have a friend who lives with me right now......... I'm the one who got him and interview with a college recruiter and told him what to say at the interview to get accepted..... I'm the one who convinced my mom to give him a ride up here with all his stuff so he didn't have to pay any extra money out of his pocket when it came time to move out here for college....... I'm the one that helped him find his first job and showed him the ropes there so he knew how to make money....... I'm the one that helped him with food and a place to stay FOR FREE! since he's been out here........... I'm the one who made sure that when I had to move from my old apartment to my new one that he had somewhere to stay....... I'm the one that helped him move his stuff from my apartment to mine and a friends apartment so his stuff wasn't stolen......... I'm the one who asked my friend if she would let me use her closet to store his crap while I was finding him a place to live........ I'm the one who moved into a shitty ass apartment to make sure he had somewhere to stay......... I'm the one who still let's him live there rent free......... I still buy grocerys for everyone.......... I still keep up with maintanence on the apartment so everything works and the utilities don't get to high......... I'm the one making sure the place is clean for inspections week.......... I'm the one who has to worry about everything because he doesn't give a damn......... I do all this........ He used all my stuff........ I helped him so much......... And I did not receive not even one freakin thank you......... I can't even really use his cell phone without him crying about it......... He complains about everything and does nothing himself to make things better......... And this is someone I am to call friend? *sigh*.......... This is just one of many people who just walk all over my kindness........ If it weren't for me he would be back in California doing nothing with his life......... I made sure he went to college and got a job........ I made sure that he's not livign out on the streets.......... but I get no recognistion for any of it....... I have my own problems and yet still find time to help everyone else........ That's who I am........... That's who I'll always be......... If it's a good thing or not I don't know, but that's me.......... I really don't know what to do right now.......... I have tons of class work, I have to talk to collegiate housing about some money I owe, I need to worry about work, I have to worry about taxes, I have to worry about my cell phone, I have to worry about my family, I have to worry about money, I have to worry about EVERYTHING!........ *sigh*......... It's so exausting trying to handle all this at once........ And the only one there for me is Katina...... The one person who I do the least for, yet care about the most.......... She's not even here with me and she does more for me than everyone I know combined.......... I love you Katina..... With all my heart........ Please don't ever forget that........

Hope everyones having a good day........... Laters

"event","Where to start...... This weekend was just one disappointment after another.......... The only good thing about this weekend was being able to talk to Katina, but other than that it was hell....... I found out how a 1099 job works....... Lets just say I need to get a new job....... I got laughed at when I went to do my taxes......... The lady saw what I made for the 3 months I was working my old job and just looked at me like,""Were you living on the streets or something?"". I hate when people think there better than other people, but this was an elderly lady and I held my tongue...... Not only that, my phones been acting up...... This is my second V3Razor phone I've had...... It's giving me the same problems my first one gave me, but worst.......... Not only that, I've had this phone for a few months now and still haven't recieved all my ring tones back from when I had purchased them on my old phone......... I spent most of Saturday in bed because a certain roomate promised to take me to one of my prospect June apartments and blew me off for a bike show........ Granted, we were supposed to leave in the morning to handle the apartment issue and he didn't leave for the damn bike show until late afternoon........ He can go F*** himself if he thinks he will be my roomate in the future........ I'm tired of being lied too and haven't promises broken....... My mother used to do that to me all the time and it still hurts.......... That's probably why I stayed in bed most of Saturday all depressed because half my day had went down the drain....... Not to mention by the time I got up, I was supposed to go to the post office....... So me thinking the post office doesn't close until 5pm, leave my house around 3:45pm to go to the post office...... Luckily I didn't have as much stuff as I usually have when going to the post office because when I got there (4:03pm) the post office had just closed....... *sigh* I had walked way the hell there only to find out that I was 3 minutes too late........ It seems like I've been just having the worst of luck lately....... But luckly I have a loving caring girlfriend there to cheer me up when I'm down..... I love you Katina........ Honestly, you are the only reason I'm still out here trying to finish this shit hole of a school...... When I had the money, I would had moved out there for get to get away from all this stuff, but now I'm broke and don't know what to do...... Seems like my mom is only giving me hell about the situation too.......... She acts like it's my fault that I'm out here...... She's the one that made me come out here...... But then again it's my fault for not knowing what I wanted to do after high school...... I think if I would had stayed in California though that I wouldn't had had the chance to meet my loving Katina, so it was all worth it.......... I love you......... Please don't forget that..... No matter how bad things get for me, you always put a smile on my face at the end of the day.....(not in a dirty way either)....... I hope you know that....... You mean the world to me........ I just wish I could show it more....... I'm going to make something of myself for you....... I don't want you to be with a loser...... I only want the best for you........ So I'm going to do my best to become that ""prince charming""......... I will become something....... I will survive........... I will never give up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...................

I only want to be what you want me to be...... No matter what that may be, I'll still always be me aswell....... I just want to be a good provider so if you ever did want to marry me...... I want to show your parents and my parents that I am mature enough to start my own family....... That I will take care of everything...... That I do know what I'm doing....... I just want to be ""the right guy""......

I hope you understand that...... I love you and there isn't anything I wouldn't do for you........

As for everyone out there in LJ land and the world...... Have a nice day.......... Keep your chin up......... And things will get better in time........ In the great words of Dory......""Just keep swimming...."" ^_^"

"event","I wish I didn't have to be here..... It's barely going to be the end of March......... I wish May would just hurry up and come..... *sigh*..... I need to check my computer when I get home tonight and see if I still have my senior project research paper........ I really don't feel like writting another 5 page paper with intext citation and a sources sited page....... I don't really mind re-doing the title page, but the rest is out of the question........ I really don't have the time for it....... As for this Saturday, I have to look at some apartments and go to H&R Block to do my taxes........ Hopefully I'll get something back in my taxes seeing as I lost my position at my job...... My pay pretty much got cut in half and I was struggling with it how it was....... *sigh*..... Well see what happens......... I'm sure I'll figure something out, but it may take a while to get adjusted.......... As for the month of April, I'll be doing the photography of a wedding...... It's for a closer that I work with at work....... He wants me to come up with a price, but I have no clue as-to what to charge him........ Does anyone have any clues on a good price to charge for wedding pictures? I'll have to charge him for the prints, but what should I charge to put in my pocket? *sigh*. I'ld do it for free, but something tells me not to...... I don't like being to kind to people because I end up being taken advantage of later on...... The only one allowed to take advantage of me is Katina......... That's it........... I'm tired of everyone else trying to walk on me........ If your gonna do it, atleast get some permission....... Anyways, I got my bus pass today......... I managed to get it for just $17...... It was a new girl working in the store and I made it seem like I left my wallet at home just in case she tried to card me........ ^_^......... I know it sounds bad, but I'ld rather pay $17 compared to $36 because I'm no longer 18............ I think it should always be the same for students, but nobody at school feels that way......... O'well........ Hopefully I can get away with that for a while seeing as I'm not going to have any money for a long time........ I should really start my Michigan fund back up....... I spent it all allready on a plane ticket for Katina to come in May........ I need to save up so when I move out there in November...... Life will be so great knowing i'll only be a hop, skip, and a jump away from Katina......... I love you honey with all my heart and want to spend the rest of my life with you.......... You make me so happy....... You are my everything and the only reason I'm still pushing to go on.......... I honestly would have gave up a long time ago....... It's just knowing I had you to look forward to that makes all this worth it..... I don't want you to be with a loser so I'm going to make something of myself..... I want to be able to take care of you and our family........ Yes, I said family....... I love you and will always be here for you...... You know I want to marry you..... I know we're both only 19, but I know...... I know I want to be with you forever...... There's not a doubt in my heart, mind, or my soul...... *kiss*..........
I'm going to stop there....... If I don't, I'll end up writting forever about how much I love you honey....... As for everyone else, I love y'all too, but just not the same way....=p.........
Hope everyone is having a nice day.........

"event","OMG!!!! I found out who my new teacher is........ I don't know if I told anyone on here, but there were these two teachers that used to always get on our case about sitting in the hallways at break....... I have one of those teachers as my teacher........ -dies-...........
Now I'm stuck with this lady who is a complete nut....... She reminds me of the wicked witch of the west from the Wizard of OZ...... *sigh* I don't know what I'm going to do for the next few weeks....... As for other news, I think I may have found an apartment to move into when I'm out of this crap collegiate housing program........ ^_^......... It's perfect, but really far from the school......
I'll be looking at a 1 hour bus ride to school........ and I'm not sure yet as for how I'll get home........ I can usually catch a ride from someone at work, but I might have to start taking the bus....... But I'm sure I'll figure something out, I always do...........
I also purchased my plane ticket for June.......... So I'll be in Michigan in June to meet my loving girlfriends family and friends...... I know I'm going to have a great time, and while I'm up there I'll be looking for apartments so I have a place in November when school is up.......... but only time will tell what will happen....... There are so many determining factors that take over my life nowadays, that it's not funny......... But there's nothing I can do about it, it's life......... Well, I'm going to cut it short for now...... I have to read a chapter before break so we can talk about it in class.......... *sigh* -ded-
Hope everyone is having a nice day......... I love you Katina! *kiss* I can't wait to see you in May......... You are the only reason I'm stilling pushing to succed....... <-------(bad speller) ^_^........ I hope you know I love you honey and there's nothing I wouldn't do for you................"

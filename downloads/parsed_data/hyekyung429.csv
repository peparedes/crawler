"event","So now I'm back at beloved JMU. It's been great seeing everyone and my room is nice. We have a suite where two rooms share one bathroom. The bathroom is really nice. And our room is very comfortable and cozy. The first week of school went okay except for the ridiculous amount of rain we got. Our whole school just turned into a lake. It was sooo bad. This weekend was good though and had a lot of sunshine and no rain. Hopefully it will stay like that for the rest of the week. 

Sooo the weight has been lifted. I got into the nursing program. :) I'm starting a semester late though, in spring 2008 but it's all good I'm just so glad that I know now. And I don't need to stress so much over my grades but I still want to do really well. My GPA got a bit lower bc of last semester and I want to boost it up again. My friend Alex who I got really close with the past year got into the spring semester too and I'm really glad that we're in the same boat. I guess we're just meant to be hahaha. So now the question is...what to do for that extra semester? I'm thinking about working in Harrisonburg because by then I'll be living in a house/apartment off campus... and for the house/apartment that we want, I don't know if they do semester leases. Or someone who will just be here for the first semester could take my spot. I dunno. It's really complicated. I should talk to my adviser soon.

And I just realized while I was typing this entry... that I don't really have any guy friends here :( Like I know guys but I'm not that close with them, I don't meet up with them for like lunch/dinner, I don't call them up... I guess they're just like acquiantances. How am I gonna get a bf at this rate??! -___-;; Oh well I guess it will just happen when it happens. Arghhhhh"

"event","Sooo summer has finally started after a fun, challenging, and rewarding first year of college.  It's definitely been an experience and I've met so many amazing people who are just so inspiring to me.  It's hard for me to totally reflect on college now at this point in my life because I've just been so adapted to being at home now...  But yeah, college is fun and JMU is great. :D Being a Nursing major can be stressful, but I'm gonna try to not worry about it too much, try the best that I can, and hope and pray for the best!  But most of all I need to not worry about it too much because my life is in someone else's hands. :)

So yeah since I've been home, I've been doing a lot of seeing old high school friends and its been so much fun!  It's great to be able to get a spontaneous call and be out the door in 10 minutes, doing some spontaneous activity with some spontaneous friends haha.  I'm just so grateful that I have great friends back at home to fall back to and who I know will support me with whatever I do.  :)  Am I sounding mushy yet? LOL But yeah it's been great being at home, I just hope that it doesn't go by too fast. The month of June is already here! 

As far as jobs go, I'm doing RecPAC again... Another summer filled with disgusting little buggers. The pay is good this year so getting my paycheck will be exciting. I looked into having another job along with RecPAC but that hasn't been going so good for me. Most places don't hire seasonals so I'm at a disadvantage. I just found out today that PETCO doesn't want to hire me for that same reason. Poo, I was disappointed. Grooming Assistant sounded like a lot of fun. Sarah wants me to apply to Ross with her but I don't know if I want to work there. I'm starting to think that maybe I just shouldn't have another job... Plus Hyemi's hours for Ross are soooo long... Mon-Sat 11am-7pm! Crazy. I don't think I could stand it. And on some Saturdays I help my mom at the cleaners and I get paid for that so that provides me with some pocket money that quickly disappears haha... 

This Saturday I'm going to the beach! Actually it's Sandy Point which isn't a real beach but it's good enough! Going with about 9 other people and there's gonna be a bbq and mmmmm...should be fun. :D I tried on my bikini today and it still fits haha. I don't know if I'm gonna swim though but I'll still wear it anyway. I definitely want a nice even tan though so hopefully I'll be able to tan! 

I need a new digicam!!! I'm thinking about convincing my mom to buy me one tomorrow so I can have it for the beach :) 

ahhh hungry...maybe I'll go look for a snack. ok bye bye for now!"

"event","Okay so Spring Break 2006 is almost coming to an end... Boo hoo :( This week actually went by a bit slowly for me though which I guess is good.  I really didn't do much except enjoy the comforts of my home and after about 8 weeks of college life, I think that's what I needed.  Hmm I guess I kind of did a lot of shopping...3 times this week O_O  Sooner or later the money from my account is gonna disappear.  

I received my mid-semester grades and ehhh I could really be doing better right now but what I usually do is slump in the beginning then redeem near the end and try to boost my grade up.  That certainly happened last semester.  But what I want to do is just be on top of things and have good grades throughout the semester but it's hard -_-  I envy those people who have the nerve to study consistently, like everyday.  I really can't do that...I just need a TV break or a computer break or a nap.  I really thought that I would change this semester but it just kinda seems the same.  Now I just want this all to be over and it soon will! May 5th!!!!! Can't wait for the warm weather, summer drives, busting out in short sleeves and shorts, wearing sunglasses, drinking frappuccinos/bubble tea/smoothies, wearing flip flops, having the wind breeze through your hair.....hahaha cheesy.  

I want to cut my bangs but I'm so darn lazy to go over to my hair cutter person and I'm definitely not doing it myself because I know that I'll mess it up.  Ehh I need a chauffer and someone to pick me up from bed and place me in my bathroom :P  I'm sucha lazy bum these days...  

Another thing to do on my list is to buy a journal.  I've kept one ever since around 2nd grade and I really do miss it.  I do have one currently but I barely write in that.  That one I've written in throughout my high school years and there's some EMBARRASSING stuff in there that happened that I really just want to forget about hahaha.  I was such a stupid girl back then with all of those stupid crushes.  Why did I like such schmucky guys?  I have no clue.  I was so dumb... 

Anyway that's my entry, I think I'm just gonna end it here.  Bye!

and thank YOU for helping me with the spelling! :D"

"event","Some things aren't really true I think but a lot of it is dead on o_o

<b>Your view on yourself:</b>
Other people find you very interesting, but you are really hiding your true self. Your friends love you because you are a good listener. They'll probably still love you if you learn to be yourself with them.

<b>The type of girlfriend/boyfriend you are looking for:</b>
You like serious, smart and determined people. You don't judge a book by its cover, so good-looking people aren't necessarily your style. This makes you an attractive person in many people's eyes.

<b>Your readiness to commit to a relationship:</b>
You are ready to commit as soon as you meet the right person. And you believe you will pretty much know as soon as you might that person.

<b>The seriousness of your love:</b>
Your have very sensible tactics when approaching the opposite sex. In many ways people find your straightforwardness attractive, so you will find yourself with plenty of dates.

<b>Your views on education</b>
Education is less important than the real world out there, away from the classroom. Deep inside you want to start working, earning money and living on your own.

<b>The right job for you:</b>
You're a practical person and will choose a secure job with a steady income. Knowing what you like to do is important. Find a regular job doing just that and you'll be set for life.

<b>How do you view success:</b>
You are afraid of failure and scared to have a go at the career you would like to have in case you don't succeed. Don't give up when you haven't yet even started! Be courageous.

<b>What are you most afraid of:</b>
You are concerned about your image and the way others see you. This means that you try very hard to be accepted by other people. It's time for you to believe in who you are, not what you wear.

<b>Who is your true self:</b>
You are mature, reasonable, honest and give good advice. People ask for your comments on all sorts of different issues. Sometimes you might find yourself in a dilemma when trapped with a problem, which your heart rather than your head needs to solve.

"event","Ahhhhh, feels so great to be home! :) 

My junior friend Jina drove me, Laura, Sunah, and Noelle. We had trouble at first fitting everything in the car because Noelle brought a GINORMOUS suitcase being the high-maintenance Chinese girl she is... Anyhoo the car ride was really fun. Sunah makes fun of me a lot and I do too. The car ride went by really fast because we were all just talking. So I left at around 1:30ish and got home at 3:40 :D Yay for Jina's speeding!

Oh yeah, this past weekend I went to the Servants Ministry Retreat with ACF. I saw Hyemi and Hannah there :) It was a really good experience...got me on a spiritual high just like how retreats always do. But I really do need to stay committed and strong on my spiritual walk. Even though it's hard, I still need to try. I'm trying to trust my life in God's hands because I'm starting to get confused with what I want to do for my future because I don't know if I'll get into the Nursing program. I'm actually starting to think that I won't -_- My classes are just really kicking my rear end. So if I don't get in, I think I might change my major...but who knows it's all in God's hands. Mmm yeah...I think I wanna buy a new Bible too. I need to read the Bible more. I also think I might get some Christmas CDs. I'm sooo in the Christmas music mode. :) 

I've realized that I've met so many great people at JMU, especially the ones at ACF. They're such strong Christians and they're so strong in their faith, it's just so admirable. Plus they're a fun bunch to be around. 

Soooo...yeah. I'm just living my life as it comes at the moment.

And...God has to put me through another trial. The stupid alarm in my stupid car went off!!!! The stupid thing went off like 5 times and I'm sure my neighbors wanted to kill me. And those technician guys said that they deactivated it UGH. So it's getting towed and the people are taking that alarm out. Good grief.

It's so good to see my cat again. An animal as your companion is one of life's best things!! Even though she's a grumpy one, I still love her and give her all my affection. Right now she's sleeping on my bed next to me. Such a cutie. She's been nagging me like crazy to feed her though...I think my mom doesn't give her enough food. My mom doesn't want her to get fat I think but I think she's been getting skinnier! Argh. Oh yeah I think I should mention that I'm considering pre-vet as a backup major. But I have a feeling that's gonna be hard to transition into from nursing. Poop."

"event","So I just got back from my GMAD class which is my media literacy class.  My friend Joon who I really envy sometimes because he can get A's on tests without even studying, he just has this strategy where the answer just pops out to him and he has tried teaching it to me but I just sit there clueless...anyway, so Joon tells me about how he went up to his professor and complained about the grade he got on his essay which was a B- (which really isn't bad but he was so furious and depressed about it) and his prof ended up raising his grade to a B+. I got a grade that I wasn't satisfied with either, although it wasn't bad. I still felt that I deserved better because of my analysis, it was just my grammar that he didn't like. So today after class, I go up to him and tell him that I had a problem with my essay grade and he starts going over it and stuff. He tells me that my analysis is really good, but I just needed to express it more clearer and not use passive voice and whatever. He explained how having good grammar was a huge part of having a good essay for this class and he just talked on and on and on like how he usually does. Then I started feeling really bad for complaining to him because he is such a nice guy and I'll admit my grammar was pretty crummy in some parts. Although he is really really really picky about grammar, I knew that I should have looked over it more. So yeah I felt soooo bad and STUPID and then when I was leaving, he told me that I could bring over a draft to him before I turn in my final which I thought was really great! I should have done that earlier but I didn't know if profs like that or not...I guess they do? Anyhoo I felt like I got a bit closer with him and I think he'll be my favorite professor this semester! Even though I knew that in the beginning he only knew my name because I'm the only Asian in the class and he loves Korean food, hopefully now I won't just be that Asian sitting there quietly staring off into space... ehh ok so that's it! This was a really spur of the moment entry thing, I know that when I look back on this I'm gonna think how weird I was hahahaha."

Oh yeah, Suchin Pak came here to speak! I didn't go see her but she was probably good. She's Korean :) 

Halloween was a nice experience. I went to a dance party and shook my booty all night. Some of the music was really bad but it was still good to let all that stress out! Anyway I'm really loving it here!!!! My roommate is great and my hallmates are great and ACF ppl are great! I can't wait till Thanksgiving break though so I can get away from all this work!

I just got tutoring for stat at this place where you can get help for Math and Science and the girl who helped me was really good! And she was really pretty too and I hope I didn't annoy her because the whole time I sounded so dumb like I never went to class but I actually do but she was still cool about it.

Anyway I've been doing a lot of Agape stuff. I'm getting closer with some people which I guess is a good thing. I just feel like I should branch out to other organizations and people like I keep on saying in my other entries... Yesterday we went to Reddish Knob, this mountain and the peak of it is like the highest point in all of Harrisonburg apparently and you can see all the changing foilage except there wasn't any!! The leaves didn't really change color poo I was disappointed. The car that I was riding in got totally lost so it took us like 2 hrs to get there when it usually takes 45 min. And it was SO COLD up there!! Like 40 degrees! We were all so shivering but it was a lot of fun because we were all taking pictures and just having a good time. Sighhhh...I'm bored. I need to study.

My roommate Jesika and hallmate Cammi went home, lots of parents are over, Sarah is gonna be gone for most of Saturday and Laura's parents are coming too. :( Well I guess this gives me time to work on stuff? Like my essay and just catching up on my classes. I've done not so good on two of my tests so I really need to keep up my grades and WORK MY BUTT OFF. I would really like a good GPA this semester... And I need to apply early to the nursing program -_- Oh well I guess this weekend I can work on getting my mind straight on studies and priorities and whatnot...

I'm coming home in two weeks though! October 21-23. Yayyyyyyy fall break! Can't wait till Winter Break so this stupid semester can be over. I wanna go to Tysons once I get home!

We had a girls night out last night which was fun. Oh and the night before that me and my Bell girls (Laura, Sarah, Paulina) slept over at Jina's house! She's our small group leader and she's soooo pretty and nice and she looks like Annie and Connie Chang. :) And today we went grape picking!!!! It was a cool experience. The grapes look really good. There were a lot of flies and bees buzzing around though which was kinda disgusting.

Last night was fun. My roommate and I had these random and funny conversations and we were cracking up together. :) It's like having a slumber party every day hahaha... I hope we get really close by the end of the year :)

Yeah so I'm listening to country music, Faith Hill. I also downloaded Keith Urban. I don't think I really feel the really really country type music I like more of the ballads they have. They're pretty and emotional. I NEED AN IPOD!!!!!!!! GAHH! They're so pretty....

The current time: <b>4:29 PM</b> It happens alot, I look at the time and it's my birthday. Makes me feel special :) It's still 4:29!!!! Wow this is a long minute...still not changing...okay now it did. hahahaha 

Okay well college is awesome besides the fact I have to write this stupid essay. My writing prof dresses well and looks young like 26? I can't tell if he's gay or metrosexual. He likes football so maybe he's metro. He reminds me of one of those fab five guys... LOL anyhoo I'm going to go live my college life now. Later taters!"

She talked it out with her mom and she said it would be fine too since it's in state and all. YAYYYYYYYYYYYYY! ahhh I'm excited. :)

I just worked out at the gym and I know I'm gonna be sore tomorrow. -_- I did the stairmaster thing for 10 min and a mile on the treadmill. I thought I would be really tired on that thing but I was actually ok! I think it was because I was going at a kinda slow rate because it took me like 15 min for one mile -_- But a mile is still a mile! Then Laura and I played Raquetball AHH IT'S SOOOOOOOOO FUN! I'm gonna play it everytime we go hahaha.

I really want an iPod! I have my eyes feasted on the 20 GB color one. Soooo preeetty :D Man at the gym today practically every girl there had a pink mini ipod -_-

Roommate is sleeping now and I should too...I'm getting quite sleepy. JMU is just peachy. It's starting to become my second home. :) Later dudes!

"event","Second week starting already! I still haven't done some of my reading. Hmm everything has been good here. Just hanging out with people. I still wanna meet some more people because I've been with the same people everyday hahaha not that I'm getting tired of them but I guess I want a change? But I suppose it'll just come to me because I thought the same way during my freshmen year of high school. And I found a perfectly nice group of friends :D

Today I went to mass and they actually have it in the movie theater LOL. I guess that's good cuz it's on campus so I don't have to try to find a ride and it's 5 minutes away from my dorm. I went with Laura...it seems like we're the only people in our dorm building that's Catholic because I didn't see anyone I recognized there. People here are mostly Christian. So after that we ate at dhall...it was yummy. Food here is pretty good. I'm getting used to it. But I'll probably get tired of it soon. 

DHT is goooooooood... :D If you want their album I can send it to you.

Oh yeah I experienced some of the party scene last night. It was Sunah, Anna, and me. We rode the drunk bus/party bus thing and it was just full of people going to parties. Seriously the only purpose of that bus is for parties. It was interesting... We were following this guy Jeremy who was already at a party when we called him and right when we get to the neighborhood where he was at, he said he was getting on a bus to go somewhere else because there was nothing there. -____-;; So we get on a bus but the bus driver says that it doesn't take us to Ashby and to get off at the top of the hill which is where Jeremy was at. So we get off and go to another bus stop and we ask these girls where Ashby is and they say to just walk. Well...we walked up the hill, up to the top. If only we just stayed on the bus and got off at the top of the hill, we wouldn't have had to walk that stupid hill. >:O So we get to Ashby and I call him and he says he's waiting for ANOTHER bus to go somewhere else AGAIN! I just wanted to choke him. So we were just like forget it and we saw this gas station that had this express food place and we indulged ourselves in greasy fries and onion rings. :D But yeah there was people EVERYWHERE milling in and out of townhouses and apartments... Of course I wouldn't drink but I just wanted to go to meet people. But it seemed like they were all upperclassmen. 

Oh yeah before this, me and some hallmates went to this dance party sponsored by Campus Crusaders, this Christian group here. It was at this house and it was crazy. Packed with crazy dancing people and it was so hot there. They were all crammed into this small room I think it was like the living room and it was hard to breathe in there. -_- So we left after like 30 minutes. It was kinda fun dancing. But the atmosphere was just kinda ehh. There were some really cute guys though :D

Anyway I have some more reading to do... So later taters!"

"event","gahhh! I'm finally here. :D

It's been an interesting transition. First day was kinda rough, I forgot my cell phone and I was just feeling a bit homesick. But the people in my dorm are just so friendly that it made me forget about a lot of that stuff. And now I'm just starting to get used to this place. Actually I think I am adjusted here. It's fun. :D My days go by REALLY fast yet it feels like I've been here forever. And it's only been a week. o_O

Anyway, I've met some new people who are all nice. I just went to this Agape ice cream social which was alright. Since Sarah and I have a night class, we went there a bit late. We just got ice cream, talked to people, met new people blah blah... Then left. :D The people there were all really nice though. And this guy was filming me talking to him I think. Watch it come up on a video that they show to the whole club or something. Ohhhh boy. Anyhoo it was alright. 

My classes are okay too. I have a feeling my hardest one is gonna be statistics. My professor is a Mennonite (branch of Amish) but that doesn't have to do with the class being hard, I just thought I'd throw that out. :D I dunno, I don't feel like I've learned anything new. He doesn't teach from the book and I'm sure that when I receive my first test, I will be clueless as a nut. AHHHHHHHHH. Plus he was saying if we want to get an A, we need to study 5 hours a week. If that's what it has to come down to, I will do that. I just feel a bit clueless right now because I've only been to two classes which were...weird. But I know 3 people in the class so I guess we can just suffer together. :) My GMAD class (Mediated Communication) is pretty interesting I think. My professor is really cool, he says damn a lot and when we were all introducing each other, he got into a conversation with us and he was really trying to get to know us. I like him a lot :D Also he was making this speech about being very CLEAR when we write our essay and leaving out excessive words and such, just to get to the point. And I totally felt him! Because I remembered that Mrs. Nelson in AP Lang was all about that too and I was like whoaaaa....I understand. I think they both said that because they're both journalists and I guess they think alike. My music teacher is reallyy cool. I like the class a lot. He teaches really well, in a way so that EVERYONE can understand because not everyone has experience in music. He also looks like Tom Green hehehe. :D My psych teacher is so hilarious. He's like at least 70 years old and he's been ballroom dancing for like 30 years. He showed us this picture of him dancing with his wife, who is his dancing partner and he was like ""look at how our legs are parallel and how she's putting all her weight on her leg"" blah blah blah it was so hilarious. He's so cute because he's got the old man voice. ^_____^ My GWRIT teacher seems alright, he looks really young, I don't think he's reached 30 yet. And we have conferences with him for our essays to work on our writing and stuff. But I hear on ratemyprofessor.com that the class is easy. So yay.

I'm starting to like this place. :) Oh yeah I saw this hypnotist show on Friday night and it was so hilarious. Must go to more hypnotist shows from now. heheheheheh :D until next time folks!"

"event","I'm leaving so soon! :( I'm excited but I'm gonna be more sad. I always get so homesick when I'm away from home like during retreats. Being at college is gonna feel like one really long retreats with little breaks for home now and then. lol. 

Anyhoo lately I've been doing a lot of meeting up with friends since we won't be seeing much of each other soon. =/ I'm definitely gonna miss driving to a friend's house who lives like 3 minutes away and hanging out and everything... I'm gonna miss my cat, my mom, my house, my bed, my tv, the summer... 

Oh yeah I saw 40 Year Old Virgin last night with Jen, Anna, and Naiem. FREAKING HILARIOUS!!!! And such a sweet ending. :D I definitely recommend it!

Today I started packing. I never realized that I have so much clothes. And I'm bringing like 90% of it. I better be wearing everything. And I'll be bringing more warmer clothes for winter like later on...maybe during the Columbus day weekend thing? So 95% of my clothes are all done I just need to put in the PJs I'm wearing right now and these jeans that my mom's friend is hemming. So tomorrow I'll be packing more stuff and hopefully I'll be alllll done. =) I'm gonna have so much stuff. Gee whiz.

Oh and I called my roommate today. She sounds like Jasmine!! Ahh! But she was like about to get on a ride at Kings Dominion so we couldn't talk for very long. She sounded really nice though and familiar since she sounds like Jasmine LOL. Excited to meet her. =) Oh and I just found out that Sarah Park isn't in the same dorm building as me. Quite sad. So mostly everyone will be new except for Laura.

I really wonder how I'm gonna pack everything. o_O I just want to get to my dorm already. But I kinda don't. =/

Oh yeah still need to disconnect my Internet. hahahhaaha. Will do tomorrow. I don't think I need anything for now. I was supposed to disconnect it today but I guess I forgot. :D

BYE FOR NOW!!!!! :D Next time I write on here I'll be in my dorm number 300 Bell Hall at JMU in harrisonburg va! gyahhhhhhh!! o_o"

"event","So I went to SF Mall with my mom to buy some stuff for college that I didn't buy yesterday. I wanted to go to Gap for a sec and my mom ended up buying for me this blue jacket thingie which I really liked bc it's casual and comfy, just my style. Then after Gap we saw this new bubble tea place and my mom said I could get one and I wanted to buy one with my own money bc my mom already spent so much on me. I get out my money and I pay with the rest of my coins I had soooo many. Then we leave for Target where I got a backpack. After Target was Best Buy where I got a laptop case. Then I drive out of Best Buy and I'm thinking...where's my Gap bag?!?! It's not in my car. So we have to go back to the mall and it was after 6 so that meant all the mall stores were closed except for the big ones like Target and JC Penneys. I go to both stores and couldn't find the bag. I realize that I must have left it at the bubble tea place because I probably set down my bag on the floor to count my change. I can't believe I forgot to pick it up...-___- So we go back to the bubble tea place but the lady already left. Oh yeah and when I left the bubble tea place after getting my drink, these black hoodlums passed by which makes me even more mad because there's the chance that someone could have taken it. GAH I got so mad at myself bc my mom paid for it and everything. It just made both me and my mom very bitter at each other and at ourselves. I think it's a sign that I shouldn't leech off my mom all the time and expect her to buy me everything. I just hate it when stuff like this happens to me. So tomorrow morning I'm gonna go to the mall and see if maybe the lady saw it and kept it. But with my luck, it probably won't happen. Arrrrrgh!

I just got this book from the library, Prep, which I've been wanting to read for awhile. So I'll just bury my sorrows in that. >:(

<b>edit:</b> 8/15/05 - I went back to the mall this morning, ran to the bubble tea place, and saw the lady rummaging through my bag. I quickly claimed it and she was saying how it was on the counter. I was so happy/glad/relieved. Phew! ahhhhhh :D"

"event","Ah I can't believe how close it is until I have to leave my dear dear home. :( I always get homesick even when I'm gone for only a couple of days. Actually when I even go out for the whole day, I get homesick. Ahhhh! I don't wanna leave. But I must. Anyway today was a fun day! I did many things. I think I had a pretty productive and nice weekend. Let's see, yesterday I met up with Annie, Sarah, and Esther at Chesapeake Bagel Bakery for lunch. Man I ate a lot. I've spent SO much money this past week! eeeek. Hm typing on this keyboard makes me realize that I need to cut my nails. They're too long for this. Ohh this is my new laptop keyboard! It's really nice. And quiet! It doesn't even seem like a computer is running. I'm gonna take very good care of this computer and get lots of help on it so I can make it last. Anyway uhhhh...oh yeah so after lunch, we all went to Annie's house to watch some Sex And The City (I thought it was Sex IN the City but it's AND! Gahh stupid me) But we kinda started to stopped paying attention to it because we were looking at Annie's pix on her comp. Then we got hungry so we went upstairs to get some food. Oh yeah Annie's dog Fluffy is the cutest and nicest dog ever! So much better than Gemi. Then we watched TV for awhile. We watched The Real World: Austin. It got so dramatic because one of the guys' mom suddenly died! It was kinda creepy and sad. I felt so bad for him but it was weird how I could really understand how he was feeling. Then after that they showed Laguna Beach! It was the first episode of the second season. It seemed really interesting. Thennn we went home. I went to Saturday mass with my mom and John since we were going to the National Aquarium the next day.

So today we went to the National Aquarium. The drive really wasn't that long, it only took us about an hour. Anyway, it was really interesting and cool to see all the fish but Jen, Richard, and I didn't seem as interested in it as John. Plus we were all really tired. John kept on reading all the little descriptions because he wanted to ""learn."" hahahaha We had lunch at this little Chinese food place which we thought would be good from reading the menu but it was actually kinda nasty. It was called Blu Bambu don't go there when you're in Baltimore!! Then we looked around for a bit in this mall. We should have gone to the Marine Mammal exhibit! That's where they have all the Sea Lions and such. But ohh well. Maybe we'll go again next year. I really wanna go to a sports game. Baseball would be good for this time of year. I wanna get some Nationals memorabilia. :D Anyway, after Jen dropped us of at home, I had to go to Grace's house to pick up Grace and Jenny so we could volunteer at Christ House, this soup kitchen in Alexandria. It's really close to Old Town. When we got there, all the volunteers from our church were these fob ppl and they were looking at us weird. The fob ppl at my church are like pricks. I only like a very few. also when we got to working, these two girls and this guy just did NOTHING. All they did was talk and laugh really loudly. Sure we came late and they were all working before, but that didn't mean they had to stop. Stupid lazy bums. Also there was this man there who I learned later was drunk. He came up to me complaining for his burnt chicken and we had to give him another plate. And he showed me like his old work ID saying that he used to be in charge of this soup kitchen well he called it ""this shit"" so I dunno if he meant just this soup kitchen or like a whole organization thing. He also kept on picking fights with other people, it was quite scary. But there was this black man who was very friendly to me and had a swollen eye so one eye was open and the other wasn't. It looked like he got punched in the face. He was telling me not to worry and to just ignore him and he also mentioned how he knows that our church comes every first Sunday of every month and he calls it the best meal of the month! LOL It was so nice of him and he said it again as he left. He was a really nice guy. Also today I had on my Abercrombie shirt and it has the date ""1954"" on it and this one man pointed out how that is his birthdate. hahahhaha. So random. After that, we went into Old Town and ate at Cosi's. I really wanna eat the smores there!! We tried to go to Banana Republic and Gap after that but they were both closed. Then I had to drop them alllll off and it took so freaking long. Like one hour. 

Man I really want to have all my music on this comp but I've realized that my comp has so much spyware so wouldn't this comp get infected too? gahhh those darn things. I've been ripping a couple of my CDs though. well I've talked long enough so I'm gonnna goooo... dangit work tomorrow -_- BYE!"

"event","Whoa I just found out my roommate yesterday. I just saw her name and her address blah blah but today I received an email from her. She sounded really nice and she was shooting at me with all these questions left and right hahaha. But I emailed her back with like a 7 page essay LOL I really wrote too much... Then I saw her picture on facebook and she is SOOOO PREEETTYY... Man she's gonna get all the guys hahaha. She seems like a nice girl who's religious so that's a good thing. Gosh gosh goshhhh I really wonder how our friendship is gonna be. Like just one of those people who you just know as a friend like not too close or are we gonna get like really really close? I'm excited but I'm more nervous. I'm sucha worrywart. Just watch my first couple of weeks I'm gonna be suffering from social awkwardness. Then hopefully soon enough I'll find my niche... Annie Chang was telling me about Agape, the Christian group at JMU which mostly consists of Korean ppl. I wonder if I'm gonna join that group. Then all my friends are gonna be Korean/Asian haha. I don't wanna belong to a racial clique kinda thing. I really wanna have a wide variety of friends this time. During high school I had way too many Asian friends. Time to step out of my comfort zone and explore some new things!!

Anyway I called Sarah Park's house awhile ago to find out about her roommate but her mom told me that she's in China!! Craziness...she didn't tell me she's going there! And she's coming back on the 19th. Hope she has fun. I can't wait to see all my JMU friends! Like Sarah, Allie, Alex, Tenaya, Karla, Laura, Sam, Chelsea, lol this guy I met for a second yesterday at Old Town named Alex who graduated with Annie and Esther, um um um um ohh Jason Flory anddd...I think that's it haha. Oh yeah Jessica Benjamin. And these 3 random people who I don't know who just added me on facebook hahahaha. I should go up to those 3 people when I see them on campus and say how they added me on facebook and make them feel awkward hahahahahaha. I really am gonna do that.

Oh yeah today I was watching our senior dvd thing. It mostly featured the prep crowd and the sport jock people but it still made me feel nostalgic and miss WSHS. Siiiiiiggghhh... Like seeing us all walking around the halls...man I'm never gonna be sandwiched between big fat people ever again. I'll be walking on a college campus to get to class! I'm so scared gahhhh I need someone to hold my hand. I hope my roomie will be of good assurance to me. 

I really want my sony laptop to come. Gahhhhhh!

Later today Esther and I are gonna watch Sex In The City! Hopefully. She's at a bbq thing right now. I hope she doesn't drink a lot and get drunk -_-;;"

"event","Wow...this week went by pretty fast. Mostly I've just been working then napping at home afterwards. LOL man those kids wear me out. For the past 2 weeks I've been with first and second graders. Ugh. Awful. There's some that are so SO annoying and that I want to strangle but there's some that are just soooo sooooo nice and they always always listen to me and they always help me clean up. :D Whenever I'm too lazy to clean something up, I ask them to do it and they do it for me. HAHHHAHAHA. And when we play this game called Torpedo where the kids run from one side of the gym to another while the counselors try to hit them with balls, I lash out all my stress and anger by trying to hit some kids. :D haha it's funnnnn... I'm evil. Anyhoo I was really worried about my supervisor firing me because we haven't been looking after the kids enough but I guess I was just overreacting. I think I do have the kids under control and I'm one of the few people at my work who actually care about this job. My director is like the laziest bum ever. -_-;; But I got to interact with my supervisor more and I think she likes me. I think I'm gonna be moved to another school though because there's some counselors who are doing a really crummy job at their schools. Anyway sighhh I'm sad this weekend is over. We're going to the zoo on Thursday! Should be interesting...and I'll be stuck with 3-4 graders.

Speaking of 3-4 graders...there's this girl in the 3-4 grader group named Yesenia. She's this cute little black girl with 2 humungo moles on her face and has an ADHD brother in the 1-2 grader group. She drew this drawing of all the counselors and guess what she wrote next to my name: ""Chinese girl teacher."" It was really cute in a I hate it when people think I'm Chinese sort of way. :D 

Yesterday (Saturday) I went to Georgetown with Jenny, John, and Grace. My little group from church =) It was a lot of fun except for the fact that it was MUCHO hot and humid. I didn't get a lot of stuff. Just a skirt for 7 bucks from Gap and a tank top from Urban Outfitters. That store...me like. :D Oh yeah, and when we got off of the Metro at Foggy Bottom, the GWU Hospital was right next to it, and we saw all these people crowding around and looking at the hospital and there was even a camera crew. I was really wondering what all the hub bub was about so I asked this man who was standing by himself if something important was happening. And he said that the Vice President was about to come out! We were like WHOAAAAAAAA... The man turned out to be a journalist for NBC! He said the VP was in for a routine check up of his colon. So he basically was getting a tube with a camera in it stuck up his butt. Hehe!! So we waited for like 15 minutes but got too impatient and hungry so we just left. So I didn't get to see Mr. Dick in person. I had my camera ready and everything. But oh well when my stomach calls, I must answer it :D Anyway it was a lot of fun hanging out with them. We're gonna go again in August. 

Today I just went to church and afterwards I ate pho with my church group again. We ate at PHO BISTRO. Mannnn I think it's my favorite pho place now. They give you a HUUUUUGE bowl with TONSSSSS of noodles and beef. I couldn't even finish it all which is rare for me, I usually finish the whole bowl. And it was soooo delicious. I think it's owned by Korean people because the menu was in Korean and I saw a commercial for it on the Korean channel. Besides the fact that it's a bit pricey ($6.50) it's the beeesssstttt pho place in my opinion. 

Oh yeah and I got new sandals! I wanted to get the Rainbow ones but they didn't have my size so I got these leather ones by Reef. I think they're the ones that Jen said she wanted to get. You can still get them though! They're really comfy. So yeah...no more bidding on eBay for them b/c I think the price would be just the same if I got them in a store. 

Anyhoo...I feel like going on a shopping spree at Kohl's. hehehe. Maybe I'll go tomorrow after work. Toodle looooooooooooooooooo!"

"event","Wow much much things have happened in the past weeks...finals, PROM, graduation, ANGP, going to 3 other graduations (Centreville, Robinson, Oakton), hanging with friends, and getting paperwork done for my RecPAC job. Did I mention about that on here? Well I got a job as a RecPAC leader and RecPAC is this summer day camp thing for elementary kids and it's held by the county. I get $8.50 an hour, 8 hours a day, Monday - Friday. I think it's gonna really tire me out. Especially if I have annoying kids -_- I'm gonna be in charge of 20 kids. I really hope I don't! Or else I'm gonna turn into a Nazi like leader. >=O Oh well Rochelle got the job with me and HOPEFULLY we will both be assigned the same school and I will be able to work with her this summer. Plus I think a counselor in training person will be with me so I guess they can help me if my kids turn out to be total boogers.

Anyway this week is gonna be especially tiring. Tomorrow and Wednesday I have the RecPAC orientation from 8 am - 5 pm. Then Thursday we set up at our assigned schools. I WANT CARDINAL FOREST! It's the closest to my house. I think we'll find out tomorrow what our school is. The orientation is at McLean High School where I've never been so Rochelle and I will be referring to our Mapquest directions. I hope traffic isn't too bad on 495 at around 7 am. =/ GAHHHHHH I really do not want to wake up so early but this whole week I'm gonna have to. And then Friday is my JMU orientation! Sarah Park went today and she seemed to really like it. I hope I have a loooot of fun. =) Then Saturday 8am-5pm AGAIN I have to get my CPR/First Aid Certification for RecPAC. SIIIIIIGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH. Then July 4 weekend consists of Potomac Mills and possibly DC for a bbq and fireworks. :D Yayyyyyy. I wish I had a guy friend who I was sorta into so I can invite him to the fireworks and we can marvel and oogle at them and we'll share a magical moment. :D Hahahaaaa I'm so corny and weird. After July 4, I will be starting my job. I think there's gonna be a bunch of field trips so that should be fun. Ahh ok I'll stop talking about my job.

Anyway lots of people are at Beach Week now. For awhile I was wondering why Jen wasn't calling me to hang out or like go to the pool with her then I realized she left for the beach hahaha. 

Oh man I'm so happy. My neck has been aching since yesterday because I slept in a weird position 2 nights ago. It hurt A LOT it was like torture and I wanted one of those neck brace thingies. But while I was shopping for food at Shoppers today, the pain gradually went away. I felt so glad and liberated! Maybe it was because of the Advil I took but the pain is still gone and hopefully it will stay that way. Oh yeah Jai Park works as a cashier at Shoppers. Tooooo weird. And funny. There's so many Asians there. 

Yesterday I saw Batman Begins. I haven't seen a movie in theaters for sooooo long. It was quite cool. I liked it. Katie Holmes was kinda bad. I think she should stop doing feature films now. And she never wore a bra throughout the whole movie. But wow Christian Bale or whatever his name is = hottie! Next I want to see Bewitched!! I reaaaaaaalllllyyyyy wanna see it Will Ferrell is my hero =) You know he kinda has a really ugly face that looks like it's constipated but it's okay his humor makes up for it. :D 

Piano songs are the best. :D A really good song: Rascall Flatts - God Blessed the Broken Road. I heard it on 98.7 WMZQ yes that country station but I wanted to hear some pretty country ballads and they played that song on there!!!! I think that song is getting really popular because Carrie Underwood sang it. Anyhoo go download that.

Toooo much writing for me today. Adios!!!"

"event","This weekend went by way too fast. I guess it was productive though. Saturday was the Tri-Hi-Y Car Wash/Garage Sale at our school. It was fun but a bit tiring. My shoulders got pretty burnt. My left one is more burned than my right one though and it hurts >:[ I think we made about $260 but I dunno how much that is for profit. Then afterwards, I took Ayako home but then I decided to invite her to the pool when I was at her host family's house. They're such nice people! The little kids were so cute. They go to Rolling Valley my old elementary school. They also had this dog which was 6 months old but looked like an adult dog and he was really cute and nice too. So we went to the pool where I met up with Jen, Paul, and Richard and it was fun jumping into the pool after a very very long day. Ayako couldn't swim because she was on her menstrual cycle :D She taught me ""You have a big butt"" in Japanese and now I totally forgot it. I gotta remember to tell her to say it again for me. Then I took Ayako home and the rest of us went to Jen's house where she fed us chicken. I dropped off the guys and when I came home my mom wanted to go to Lotte so I went. I found out they have a lil thingamajigs there and I bought this car air freshner thingie. It smells like apple. Then I slept really early like around 10 but fell asleep at around 11 I think.

Today I had church and I went to my last CYO class EVER. It wasn't anything special, just a regular old class and I guess I'm glad I ended it that way. Now I guess I'm part of Chung Nyun Heh! That's the youth group for college students. Oh yeah our old priest left for Rome last week and we had our new priest come today. He's younger by one year than our old priest and he was like 33-ish. He seems very nice and cool. I hope I get to know him better soon. Also there was this special event going on for all the elderly people in my church....I'm not sure why they did it but they had a talent show portion thing and some CYO kids performed and it was funny.. Okay so after that John, Jenny, and I went to go eat pho and thennnn we all went home. I had a project to work on for Spanish so I went to Allie's house for that. We have to make this video with these different segments on it. Oh man it was really really REALLY funny I was like crying while I was laughing. Her brother is so funny and clueless. I wish I could have watched the whole video when we were done but I don't think they had time. It would be really bad if no one laughs at it except for us while we're showing it to the class. LOL I have a feeling that's gonna happen. Then I went home and waited for my mom to come back from her dinner and during that Jen came over for a sec to get her curling iron back. I also watched part of ""She's All That"" which I really liked but the ending was kinda blah. 

Now I gotta study for my Bio final which is only identifying the parts of the pigs we dissected. Whoo!

Your birthday on the 29th adds a tone of idealism to your nature. 

You are imaginative and creative, but rather uncomfortable in the business world. 

You are very aware and sensitive, with outstanding intuitive skills and analytical abilities. 



The 29 reduces to 11, one of the master numbers which often produces much nervous tension. 

This is the birthday of the dreamer rather than the doer. 

You do, however, work very well with people.</td>

"event","This weekend has been pretty relaxing and...wasteful :D 

Thursday: After school I went to eat pho with Sarah Tak then I went home and took a 2 hour long nap. I then went to the library to get some AP review books and checked out this one book to read. I also saw my buddy from church Grace there! Small world. Because of her, I left the place like 45 min later when I only meant to make a quick stop. Plus, I let my cat out to play outside and eat some grass like how she always does. So my mom called me on my cell wondering how and why the heck she got out there. Then I slept veryyyy late.

Friday: I went to tutor Janice then came home and was a huuuge lazy arse. I went over to Anna's to give her my notes from English and Government since she wasn't in school. We just lounged around, did homework, and I played with her four VERY FAT cats. It's amazing how fat they are. And their tails are so short! I bought some Five Guys for dinner for my mom and I. It was burger heaven in my mouth. Their fries are yummilicious too. I started reading the book I checked out from the library that night and finished it at like 1 AM. I read it on and off and it was only 154 pages. It was...interesting? It definitely covered some deep and sophisticated topics that if I didn't have my mind in the clouds half the time I was reading it, I would probably understand them. I hate deep books and being analytical. That's a bad thing isn't it? My brain is gonna get all mushy and I'll have the IQ of a squirrel when I'm older. =(

Saturday (today): I woke up at around 11-ish and got ready to go help out at the car wash for NHS. It was pretty fun scrubbing cars and drying them and whatnot. We all got very wet and my feet were dirty. I made the stupid mistake of wearing my white flip flops so I have to wash them AGAIN! -_- After that, the SAMCHONGSA (trio) of Sarah Tak, Hyemi Lim, and Lisa Son decided to go to Chipotle for some lunch. MMMMMM CHIPOTLE. That stuff is BEASTTTT. Soooo soooo soooooooo good! Pho and Chipotle...I could never get tired of. Then I dropped those two off and I started on some homework at home. While doing my Spanish, I fell asleep and I had this weird dream and the only part I remember of it is that I had this splinter in my foot and I was trying to get it out...then I woke up. My mom came home and we went to Old Country Buffet to eat. I saw this man there who looked Asian, maybe Korean? But then I looked close and thought maybe he was half white half Asian. I think he was, he sorta had that look. My mom thought he was a military man because of his sorta shaven head and tall figure with his broad shoulders.Anyway I liked how he looked. :D He was quite handsome. Then I look over to where he's sitting and lo and behold...wife and kids. >=O His wife was very cute though and I couldn't figure out what nationality she was (I'm usually pretty good at this) maybe she was like mixed or something. Their kids were really cute but they seemed loud and I could tell they were getting kinda annoyed but still very patient. That's really good. I hope I'm like that if my kids turn out to be very annoying brats. Ahhhhh...I love people watching. =) Oh yeah and there was this sorta fat guy who looked around my age and he kept on looking at me while munching on his ribs. It was quite disturbing... Also there was this Korean couple at the table next to mine, and when my mom and I went to Lotte afterwards, I saw them there again!!! It was weird. Then, I was beginning tell my mom that those people were here and then AHH! I see the man of the Korean couple staring right at me! I think he heard me but I dunno. OMG I was so embarassed...I tried to play it off coolly but I don't think it worked. -_- After that we went to Shoppers. When I got home I started to write this story/fanfic kinda thing but I got huuuge writers block like 30 min into it. I don't think my plot is very well shaped yet. It was just a spur of the moment kinda thing. But who knows maybe I'll get back into it when I have the time and the creative juices.

Oh yeah and multiple times during those days I was receiving text messages from Jen who's now in California! That lucky duck. She's been updating me on my Mormon luva. Wish I was there. Hehehe. 

Well that's it for my weekend thus far! I'm gonna go watch my favorite current reality TV show, Showdog Moms and Dads!! It's on Bravo and it's sooo interesting. :D Bye!"

<b>Pope (Saint?) John Paul II (1920-2005)</b> A man full of sacrifice and unconditional love... I never knew how much of an amazing person he was until I watched a special on him last night. It got me very emotional. But then again I might have just been letting out my disappointment from my UVA rejection. =/ It's alllll good...think I might transfer there after 2 years.

Then this morning My Dog Skip was on TV and I think I cried throughout the whole thing. I'm ALWAYS like this during pet movies... I have too much of a soft spot for animals. I can't wait to have a bunch of pets :D

Today is Palm Sunday so we had a Palm Sunday celebration at church. It was nice. We all got palms and I folded mine up into a cross but it looks kinda funky. Afterwards Jenny, John, and I went to go eat pho where we discussed things. Actually, it was mostly John and I talking about stuff Jenny just sat there looking clueless hahaha. Today I was pretty good with John when usually I'm annoyed and peeved at him haha. But today was allright. When I got home my mom and I went to David's Bridal to look at prom dresses... There's one very cute one I saw but it was $150 and a little too big. But I definitely would have bought it if it was a bit cheaper and fit me! It was so pretty =D So we decide to go again to Springfield Mall and that's where I bought my dress. It's the one I tried on before last week and it cost me $80. It's allright it's pretty =D But I think I still would have wanted something cheaper but oh well it's ok... Then after we go to Walmart to get some cat food and when we arrive, it starts hailing! It was so weird. Then it stopped like after 10 minutes. I don't like how I write in LJ or xanga or whatever online blogging thing cuz I always switch my tenses around. I wish I could naturally keep on talking in a consistent tense but I don't. Oh well...I hope I'm not the only one :D

Monday - VCU w/ Jen and Mei
Tuesday - Shopping w/ Sarah Tak and PARTAY at Mrs. Jones's house =)
Wednesday - Chill with Sarah Park (?)
Thursday - Leesburg with Jenny and her mom and Grace (?)
Friday - donno
Saturday - donno
Sunday - EASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So on my 1.5 minute drive home from school to home I was shitting my pants =( And when I got home, Michelle, Seyoung, and Hyeyoung unni were standing around on my street because Michelle's car was sliding out of control and stuff and they can't drive it. Boy, that's like my worst nightmare right there o_o 

I remember two years ago on the first snowfall of the year when I was walking with ****** and he told me that I was the first girl he shared the first snowfall with. I was so stupid to over analyze his words and take everything so seriously... I was a stupid little girl. =D Boys just always disappoint me more and more yet I always have these random crushes...which eventually fade like after 3 months. I hate how they can be so manipulative. -___-;; And I hate it when they're smarter and more talented than me like *someone*. It makes me a bit jealous and that they care more for being successful than liking someone. And actually I guess one's success IS a bit more important. =/ Ahhhhhh who cares boys are stupid >=O

I would just feel so out of place if all of my smart friends get in there gahhhhhhh. o_o gotta stop worrying. 

My cat just slept on the floor for a long time and she woke up and I can see her legs imprinted in the carpet. Haha. Cool huh. :D

I cut my hair! It's a bit short and layered. It's kinda annoying though because my hair can never be straight and it just flops in random directions. Doesn't make me look good .___.

"event","Wow it's been awhile since I wrote in this. Yay the 4 day weekend has finally come! It feels good to finally relax and have some me time (which mostly consisted of eating and sleeping.) 

Let's see.. Wednesday was a half day and after school I went with some Tri-Hi-Y girls to our adopted family to give them some food and toys for the 4 little girls. Oh yeah this week on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday I had tests on each day and that was quite pleasant -_- Anyway going to the adopted family was really great and the mother ended up crying like last time (I think she did) and I tried hard not to get teary. *sigh* It's such a great feeling to know that you helped make an impact on someone's life =) After that, we all went to Mrs. Jones's house and her dog Samantha farted! It was soooo hilarious but the dog got so embarrassed because I was laughing at her =( Anyway then I had to drive some girls home and after I dropped off this one girl I was backing out and I hit the parked car behind me!! =O I frantically get out of the car and check the car and surprisingly I find no dents or anything. Then I look over at my bumper and see how it's low and it reached the tire of the parked car which was a big SUV. So relieved, I assumed that I hit the tire. I hope I did. Later on I looked at my car and saw so dents or anything. PHEW! You have NO idea how scared I was. I'm gonna be EXTRA EXTRA careful from now on.

Thursday I slept in till like 10:30ish and helped my mom cook some things. We spent like half of the day cooking. Then Esther and her sister came and then their mom. Their dad couldn't come because he had to work at the store. It was still fun with all of us. It's been a long time since my mom and I served dinner for people so it was interesting. They really liked the food and it was really good. After we ate Esther and I went to Blockbuster because I really wanted to rent Elf. We watched it and it was SO GREAT! It was so freaking hilarious! I love Will Ferrell :D I watched it like 3 times already and maybe I'll watch it again tonight if nothing good is on TV. 

Today I woke up, watched TV, fell asleep again -_- took a shower, ate, and John came over to use my computer. I studied for the SAT II Writing test for a little bit and it wasn't brainless learning, I actually learned things. It's fun learning grammar :D I like that better than writing. 

Now here's a really stupid and sad story. After John left, I went to Walmart to buy one of those universal remotes because my remote didn't work even when I put in batteries. I bought that and a pack of AAA batteries to put in it. I also saw Hyemi there too! That was a pleasant surprise. I see this blur pass by me and the blur shouts out ""Lisa!"" and the blur turned into Hyemi! Isn't that weird how you think you don't know the person who passes by you but it's actually someone you know really well. Hehe it's a cool feeling. Anyway I wait in line to buy my stuff and the total comes out to be $13.05 Isn't it weird how I remember that? My brain is cool :D So I pay with the money I got from work and I don't really like taking this money because it's good to save up and it's hard to do that when you keep on taking it as your spending money -_- Then I go on home, listening to my Christmas carol CD that is sung by Korean singers who cannot speak English at all so they have these ugly English accents. So ugly it makes me cringe. But it still got me in the Christmas mood. I get home and open my new remote and put the batteries in and I realize that it needed TWO batteries. I remembered that I thought my old remote required one so I changed one. I open the old remote and sure enough a second battery slid down. I put new batteries in the old one and it worked. -___-;; I felt soooooo dumb... I wasted 7 dollars and something cents. But I told my mom and she said I could still return it so I'm gonna try to go tomorrow and see.

Now my fingers kinda hurt and I'm tired. I'm sucha lazy bum. I don't want this break to end :D"

First quarter is done and I have no idea what my grades are. I took some tests that could either bring my grade up or down. I don't know why, but I don't really care much about my grades that much. Maybe it's because college is right around the corner for me and most of my work in high school is done. I just want to start on a new leaf, a new chapter of my life. I dunno if change will be a good thing or bad thing for me. Hopefully good =/

Anyway Saturday I didn't do anything. I napped a lot. I would be a really good cat :D Sunday was church and hung out with Jen, Anna, and Melanie for Halloween. We rented Secret Window which wasn't all that scary just a bit disturbing but pretty good overall. Not many trick or treaters were out there o_O And today I didn't do much, I just went to Anna's house and we did some homework and bought this wonderful Mexican dip to eat with chips at her house. It's funny cuz we bought that dip together on Friday too lol. It's just too good! Go to Whole Foods and look for the Mexican dip I think it's with the cheeses. Then at around 7 I went to Pohick to help Sarah with her SATs. We're meeting tomorrow morning too.. Then I dunno what else I'm doing. I should just finish up some homework. Oh yeah I almost forgot on Saturday night at like 11 PM I applied to JMU. O_O! I wrote my essay in like two hours with A LOT of breaks in between so it wasn't really two hours and the whole online app process was pretty quick. I'd say I was done in 45 minutes. But I didn't check back on the pages to see if I put in anything incorrectly but oh well I'm hoping I did. It would be nice to see if I got in a college earlier but knowing if I didn't get in...=(

Guess what! I got a message from Bill Clinton :D :D :D :D Well it was just an automated message and he was telling me to vote. He's cool. 

Boys are weird throw rocks at them. I dunno why I like the weirdest WEIRDEST ones.

Isn't it weird how there's someone who you always talk to but then that person just suddenly shuts themself from you and you don't talk to each other at all... You feel like there's something missing and you wonder what it could be and that's what it is. I didn't think I would but I really miss that person. I hope you're reading this and I hope we can talk soon."

"event","Well school started awhile ago and we just started our third week. I think everything is going okay so far but AP Bio is starting off on a rocky start. I got a 64 on the multiple choice part of our first test yay! -_-;; I dunno why when it comes to science I'm just dumb. Although Physics was okay. Oh well I guess once we get more into the other stuff I'll do okay I hope. Now I'm thinking that I should drop out of the class because it is kinda hard. We did a lab and I'd say I was lost 45% of the time. That's bad. I should be lost 0% of the time. Also today I took 2 quizzes which I could have done better on both. =/ Ohhhh wellll it's only the third week. It's only HIGH SCHOOL. =)

I like procrastinating. :D It gets me kinda relaxed. Well today it did. I'm supposed to write a college essay draft for English and I decided to do the one for UVA. For some inspiration, I decided to look through my old childhood diaries because that's where I wrote down EVERYTHING that happened in my life and I had the most fun during my childhood. There was some interesting stuff but not interesting enough for UVA to hear. One strange thing is that I chatted online too much back then. o_O Not with friends, but with STRANGERS. And I don't remember a lot of them. I was such a weird kid. It was hard for me back then to believe that most likely they're just ugly 40 year old men trying to get their rape on. It's cool how your outlook on everything changes from when you're a stupid 12 year old girl.

Once I heard that I felt so elated. =) Those girls can be kind of a handful and I really need to spend time on Bio so getting next week off is a relief. Today their two friends stayed at their house for a week so it was 4 LOUD LOUD LOUD girls. But one of them named Michelle was the oldest out of all of them and she helped me a lot with the cleaning and such. It felt good to have a little more mature, and less Hilary Duff/Lindsay Lohan infested mind at the house. Seriously, Hilary Duff is a worshipped GOD of preteenage girls these days.

Besides doing my summer stuff, I have two things on my to-do list:

-turn in my parking permit form (yayyyyyyyyy my own parking space!)

-BUY A PHONE.

Our main phone is like slowly dying. I dunno how long we've had it but I remember when we first got it I thought it was so high tech and cool and now then I look at it it just looks like a big ole ugly thing and it resembles like those cordless phones they use in the army, those green ones. Besides with its looks, the problem with the phone is that sometimes when I pick it up, I can't hear anything on the other line even though there's someone else talking. It's like its muted without the mute button being on. Today, Sarah was talking then her voice just got cut off, so I had to sprint upstairs and pick up the phone in my mom's room to catch what she was saying. Turns out I only missed 3 words that she said: ""Just call me."" -_- It's annoying and I want a nice purtie phone. SOON.

I'm a bit tired. I woke up at around 8ish today for a student council thing and it was straight to babysitting after that. 

Oh yeah, I am a huge Olympics junkie. That's all I watch on TV. It's the only interesting thing on anyway. I never knew gymnastics could be so DRAMATIC. I mean it's better than any movie I ever saw. Wowww I am so proud of USA gymnastics :D"

-do my summer assignments
-I dunno what else I must do :D

Wellllll summer is okay for me. I've stopped work at the hardware store although I told him if there's a day when he desperately needs me, I'll be there. Other than that, I'm looking over two little girls named Janice and Allison who are very...interesting. :D My Princeton Review class is almost over! I feel kinda sad about it because it was pretty fun. My teacher was cool. I learned a lot too. My score went up 80 points so far. I wish it was more but ehh it's okay. I guess I'll improve soon.

My day was cool =) This morning Jen and I went out to get some old fart's birthday present. The cards are SO HILARIOUS. :D Haha, only Spencers. =) I chilled at Jen's house for a little bit then I went over to Sarah's house to pick her up. She wanted to go to Burke so that she could look for some jobs. We passed by her crush's neighborhood and she was so excited that she was near him. Hmm I think I can relate. :D I pass by HIS house to and from work and sometimes I get excited thinking WOW HIS HOUSE IS RIGHT THERE. It's a stalker thing that only stalkers would understand. =) Anyway the job hunting didn't go too well but I hope she'll find one eventually.

Then came SAT prep and I got to see the cute teacher guy named GREG. He was our test proctor. Ohh man, HE TOUCHED ME! Well he patted my back. But that's still touching!! TEHEHEHE. He did it twice. Well the second time was kinda subtle. I dunno why he kept on patting me, probably because I was sitting near him. I hope he's not that molester type. He walks around with his shoes off. I wouldn't want to smell his feet. But he's still soooo cute :D He's got a lot of facial hair but he pulls it off. :D

After the test Sarah and I went to Dairy Queen to get some Brownie Blizzards. It was so yummy at first but then I got kinda sick of it. That's what happens to me and chocolate ice cream. Then I dropped her off and went home.

At home I ate and watched this Korean drama. I like it because it has one of my favorite Korean actors. He is cuuuuute and kinda looks like HIM. I haven't watched a full drama tape in a LONG time. It made me feel relaxed. =)

Anyway I hope to get my priorities straight this week and do some of my summer assignments. I just don't want all of the work to pile up on me later and make me have a nervous breakdown. This past week or MONTH rather has gone by sooo fast and there's 4 more full weeks of summer left! I think."

"event","How I wish my summer is like that previous post. But it's notttttttt =((( I'm busy with my job and the SAT prep class that all I wanna do is eat and watch TV when I get home. I totally forget the pile of books that I've checked out that are just waiting to be read... I just realized they were there yesterday. And starting tomorrow, I start babysitting two little girls right after my job at the hardware store, which I'm gonna stop at the first week of August. I dunno...the thought of being cooped up in someone else's house in the morning till 9 at night for most of the days of the week kinda irks me. I hope they have cable television, that might cheer me up a little bit lol But I really wanna actually DO STUFF like hang out and chill with my homies. =( Maybe I ask for too much once a bunch of UNWANTED priorities gets thrown into my life. Maybe I just want my space. Maybe I just wanna be a lazy bum and stay at home -__-

Plus I need to raise my SAT score up 100 points. If not, TPR will offer me free classes but who wants that I wanna be DONE with that class! Sorry I'm so whiny .__. Just wanted to vent. siggghhhhhhhhhhh...

Yesterday was kinda fun though. After the Tri-Hi-Y dinner at Milano's, Sarah and I went to Ali's house to deliver her bday present then we stopped by Cammy's and Sarah Park's house since they were right there but they both weren't home. We realized it WAS a Saturday night and people were out living their lives, while we were terrorizing other people's homes :D Then we went to Starbucks and talked...

<b>Yiruma - Kiss The Rain</b> Such a beautiful song! If my life had a soundtrack, I'd definitely include this song in there. :D It will be playing in the scene of when I find that special person *gushy grin*"

"event","My summer hasn't been too bad to me lately. =) I'm enjoying it! But I always get scared that if I'm too carefree then I'm gonna get punished later for it. Like I should be studying for SATs or something. My mom is really good at always reminding me of that.

Lately I've been hanging out with friends, watching movies, eating, napping, driving with my own Corolla :), reading, ""studying"", and my latest committment, running every morning at the school track. O_O I'm starting out slow since I haven't ran on a regular basis ever since PE ended. I just started yesterday and I happened to meet Melanie there too and I ran with her but it was just only one lap for me heh. Hyemi and I had arranged before to play some tennis at the courts so Mel joined with us too. Eh, no improvement in my game. But what do you expect after not playing since October? It was fun though. I pretended I was a pro player in the Wimbledon championships :D I'm starting to think that I shouldn't try out for the school team and it's because I don't want to. I don't like being pressured by a 70 year old coach who seems like he has Tourettes syndrome and always foams at the mouth when he talks or being scolded by a pissy Asian coach. It can get really stressful and I don't like playing just for the competition. I just want to play for the recreation. *sigh* I'll have several months to think about this some other time since it's a spring sport now.

I'm gonna be starting SAT prep soon which I really hope will help in my score and I hope there's not much homework involved like my other one. I'm also considering about getting a job, maybe at the library, just because 8 bucks an hour seems like a good idea to me no matter how boring the job is. Oh yeah and I'm going to a 3 Doors Down concert with Anna. I hope we'll be able to actually SEE them considering we got lawn seats. 

My summer isn't gonna be THAT exciting... From watching ""The Notebook"" and from reading 130 pages of this really good novel, I think it would be nice to have a summer romance. :D :D Eh eh? Cuz then you'd have a loooot of time to spend with them and you could do a loooot of fun fun things together! But nothing like that happens here. And there are no decent guys around here to have a decent summer romance. They're all schmucks. Anyhoo I think it's more of the little things that make a summer memorable/fun/exciting/cool/hip/enjoyable rather than the big things. =)"

I hung out with Anna for most of today. We saw Shrek 2, I LOVED Puss! He reminded me of my cat, especially when he lifted up his hind leg to lick himself HAHAHA. I laughed really loud at that part and realized I was the only one laughing .__. I met up with Pooja and some of her friends and she finally got to meet Anna! It's cool cuz they're both Indian.

ONE MORE FULL WEEK OF SCHOOL!!! I'm excited but it doesn't feel like the year is over. It went by SOOOOOO fast. But I'm glad summer is almost here :D

Thursday I had a conference with my counselor and my mom was there too. It was mostly my counselor talking and me listening and asking some questions here and there and my mom just sat there and I think she was either half asleep or really bored. I didn't really look at her during the thing but I know she understood like 30% of the whole thing. But I'm glad I did it. Mrs. Hiemstra seemed pretty willing and possibly even motivated to get me some scholarships and stuff for college cuz I am gonna need it. I hope it will be just a little bit easier for me since I'm going into nursing. It made me kinda excited for my future. =) I wonder what it holds. Then she told me about this college in FLORIDA called Nova Southeastern Univeristy in Ft Lauderdale which can possibly offer me A LOT of money. She said it's very very good too and the program is new. That suggestion seems cool. Florida...nice weather, beaches, palm trees, hot tan skinned men. When I think about Florida it makes me think about how crappy Virginia is. But Florida is like 8 hours away. I think it was 8 when I went there. It's too far. I'm gonna get homesick and cry myself to sleep every night. So I better be safe and stick with somewhere in state. There's tons of good opportunities here too. 

YES and I made an accomplishment! Mrs. Rexford knows my name now!!! I've been trying to form some kind of relationship with her because she can REALLY help me with college, scholarships, and everything and I had a talk with her during 1st period and she confirmed that she knows who I am and what my name is. =) I'm really good and going up to people whom I don't know very well and having a conversation with them :D She and my counselor were apparently having a little talk about me and were looking at my schedule for next year and stuff... They said its a hard one but hopefully I can do it! 

Tomorrow it's time to tackle my SAT II's. I'm not gonna be too hung up on this one because I doubt I'll get into UVA anyhow. But I'll still try hard. ADIOS AMIGOS!

Wow, I never knew I could be motivated that way! :D Plus I wanna relax and have fun tomorrow too. 

Anyway, I had a really COOOOOOL dream this morning. I hoped that I would dream of him and I did. And by golly it was perfect. NO it wasn't dirty you pervs it was...sweet :D Okay so we're in school and somehow his locker is a few lockers from mine and I see him at his locker. Then I think I took something from his hand like a chip or a Cheez-It and I eat it and then we start talking. Man if only I could remember how it started... But anyway he was very nice to me and we were laughing and talking and it seemed like he was expecting me to talk to me. I dunno, I just felt so comfortable. :) Watch him turn out to be a butt in real life. >:O Oh yeah and did I mention how CUTE he was in my dream??? HEHEHEHEHEH :D

Her naming guys for dates for prom was absolutely EXCRUCIATING. *cringe cringe cringe cringe* She wants me to hurry and ask a guy now, a year before prom, before all the good ones are gone. Oh yeah, I sure am running out of time. I guess it'll all work out a year from now... I do want a good prom but I won't think too hard about it now. And SHUT UP Fang! >:["

I wonder if we'll ever exchange words with each other.  .____.

There was a time when we ALMOST did. His tennis ball landed at my feet and I said ""Here you go..."" but it was almost like I said it to myself which was really gay of me but I couldn't dare look at him! I was just too shy =( I wonder if he was looking at me. Anyway I could have said ""Hey do you play tennis cuz I do but I suck really bad."" He could have said ""No..."" and give me a weird look and OMGGG THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT WE ACTUALLY TALKED! But no I was just stupid. I just don't wanna come across as being a stupid girl trying to strike up a conversation with his gallant self. There's just one flaw about him that I really hate...REALLY REALLY HATE... But he's still cute :D Man why does THAT have to ruin everything. I was turned off by it for a day but then when I saw him at school again, I forgot about that flaw and cha-ching I was turned back on ;) ;) ;) Heh heh haw haw. 

I loooooovvvvvveeeeeee guys with nice ATHLETIC LOOKING LEGS THAT ARE <B>TAN</B> and boyyyyyyyyy are his legggggsssssss taaaaaannnnn.

I was so shocked but it wasn't even open yet so it's not like I'd be waiting for too long. Since I came at around 9:30 and the place opened at like 9:50, the whole time I waited was for about an hour until they called up my number. I showed the window lady person my letter and it took her so long to read it and she looked so confused when she read it. o_O It took awhile to work everything out I guess because it's rare when the DMV loses someone's picture and it just HAD to happen to me. Anyway soon I get my new temporary driver's license and I think my picture turned out a lot better than my old one. My old one was...disgusting. And they have my address on there too. After that, I go to Victoria's Secret to get Esther's present which is some delicious cotton panties. :D I got her one bikini type one, one string panty, and one THONG! Hehehehehehe... I also got two for myself. Then I went in Forever 21 cuz their clothes looked kinda cute and I tried one a couple of things which I liked but I decided not to get cuz if my mom finds out then she'll get really peeved at me. I browsed around AE too. I left the mall to go to Best Buy and use my $15 Gift Card that I got from Eddie's Club. DC101 was in there but I dunno what they were doing. It took me like a zillion years to decide which CD but I got the Phantom Planet CD. It has 2 CDs, their old album and their new one. It's not too bad. Their old one is better than the new one though. 

Anna called me to chill today and I wanted to but then I thought about how pissed my mom would be if she found out so I had to call Anna again and tell her that I can't go. -_-;; WHY CAN'T SUMMER BE HERE?!?!?!?!?!! Then I return a book to the library, get a strawberry & creme frap from Starbucks which is REALLY yum. And then I did something SO SAD that you wouldn't believe it.

"event","Hm Saturday was a nice day. =) I picked up Sarah and off we went to volunteer for the American Red Cross for a bit. I was supposed to go on I-95 south but I went the other way instead. Those signs are so misleading! If Sarah hadn't lived in Alexandria for like 5 years then we would have never gone out of that mess. Anyway so we come to this fair type of thing held in a parking lot and we found the Red Cross booth. The step team from West Pot was also performing there and they are SO much better than our school's. The lady in charge of the booth had to go to a different event so me and Sarah were in charge of it. After like an hour and a half of being BORED out of our minds, no one came. No one. Nada. No one barely even looked at it. But that was probably because of the way the table was placed. It was like inside a tent so no one could really see it. So when that lady came back we moved it up out in the open and more people started to look at it and pass by. Plus we offered Tootsie Roll Pops to little kids which they liked. They had a lot of performances there. There was hula dancing o_O and singers and choruses and karate demonstrations which consisted of little kids who were like 2 feet tall and could totally kill me. So we decided to leave at 2 pm and I had to buy a present for my mom. 

First we went to Bed Bath & Beyond to buy my mom a comfy pillow. Those comfy pillows are freaking expensive! So I lost hope on that until I found this section where they had really nice picture frames and I found a really pretty flowery one and bought it. I planned on looking through my childhood photo album to find a picture to put inside it. At the check out desk, I saw something so EXTRAORDINARY! Breath freshners for CATS! I immediately grabbed one and gave it to the cashier lady cuz I've unfortunately smelled the inside of my cat's mouth and it's just stinkayyyy. After that, we went to DSW and entered shoe heaven. Too bad a lot of the shoes are kinda pricey but they were really nice to look at. Then I had to go to the mall to get Esther a present and I wanted to buy some underwear for her because I know she'll definitely use it. We went to Express and there was this REALLY cute shirt for $10 and Sarah wanted to buy it and she told me to buy it so that we can be ""twins"" so what the heck. I bought it. I don't think I had enough to buy Esther the 5 panties for $20 at Victoria's Secret so we left the mall, went to the library so that Sarah can get her book, then I dropped her off at home. PHEW! 

I come home and take an hour long nap. I wake up from that nap to pick up my mom. Every time I come to pick her up, she always makes me do some type of work. Also customers kept on coming in so that took a lot of time. There was this one Korean lady who really kept the place open. She just would not stop talking. Right when she's about to leave, we say happy mother's day to her and then she's like oh yeah it's mother's day isn't it?! Then she comes back to us and starts complaining how her sons don't even know that it's mother's day and yada yada yada. So yeah I got to Rochelle's party at around 6:45 when I was supposed to be there by 6. Okay, I SUCK AT PARALLEL PARKING. IT'S MY DISABILITY. When I got there, I decided to parallel park around the curb but there was this huuuuuge gap and I kept on parking then getting out of the car, parking, getting out, and I was totally unaware of the fact that all of the people in Rochelle's house were watching me from the window and laughing at me. Then Rochelle gets out of her house and tells me to park in her driveway behind Andrew's car and I'm like oh. Why didn't I think of that?! She opens her presents and gets a very interesting magazine from Naiem o_O and she cried at Hyemi's present! Aww it was so sweet =) We went downstairs to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre which spooked a lot of people out. But the scariest part was when we see a face in the window of the room and it scared the bejesus out of everyone!! It ends up being Andrew Sukhu. I just about peed in my pants then. :D We got to like half of the movie when we decided to just go to ice skating cuz it was starting to get late. Yeah, ice skating was funnnnn :D Seeing everyone fall was the highlight of my night. The strangest thing is that Sukhu was falling like crazy when he first got on there but then he ended up being the best skater out of all of us. o_O It was his first time too. Ice skating is always fun =) We left when it ended at 10:45 and went back to Rochelle's place where we chilled and ate for awhile. Some people left and there was like 5 or 6 of us left and we finished up the movie. I'm not that scared anymore and I guess it's because it was my second time watching it. Justin got a call from his mom telling him to come home so that's when we all decided to go home. I gave him a ride home and during that I learned lots of stuff about him. =) I'm gonna rape him one day MWAHAAHHA! (""Lisa, I am strictly your stand partner!!!!"") Hehe ^__^

Eh sorry if that was tooo much to read. Tomorrow is...school. But it's coming to a close almost, almost. Have a happy Monday!"

Man I actually had the chance to chill with some friends again. Well today was a HALF DAYYYYYY and it seemed like the slowest half day ever. But it finally ended and it took a LONG time for everyone to figure out how we're all gonna get to the mall or who's going to the mall or what. So Hyemi ended up taking Sarah and Mei home and Frangca and I walked home to get our stuff then Hyemi would come to Frangca's house along with Jennifer. So we get to the mall and see the others at the Food Court and we decide to eat some lunch cuz we're starving and I dunno who brought up the idea to eat at Arby's but we did. Their food is really interesting cuz when I got home I started farting like no other and the smell of it was really different...like it smelled like food. o_O Anyhoo, so the girls are shopping for Rochelle's present and Mother's Day presents and the others, who were mostly orch dork people, were gonna watch Mean Girls at 1:30. I realllyyyyyyy wanted to see it and I knew I can't watch it tomorrow so I decided to go watch it with them since Frangca, Jennifer, and Hyemi had to be home by like 3. So I went to the theatre and met up with them and watched it. OMG...hilarious movie! Some parts really reminded me of SNL cuz a lot of it was satire I guess. I sat next to Kim who laughs REALLY LOUD and I could hear Naiem laughing like an idiot who was sitting at the opposite side of the row. After the movie, half of us kinda go our seperate ways and I end up being with Rochelle, Justin, Kim, and Kim's mom who is TOTALLY a stereotypical Korean parent. I never knew there's moms out there like her. We go to Fancy World so that Justin can buy a gift for his mom which was a soap flower and it was really funny seeing him hold that Fancy World bag around the mall. Then Kim and her mom leave.

So it's just Rochelle, Justin, and me. We were two insane and pervy Korean girls holding a terrified white sophomore in captive with us in the mall. AHAHAHAHAHAHA! It was great :D He got to the point where he was almost, almost pleading at Rochelle to take him home LOL I love him he's so cute bwahahahahaa! Then we drop off little Justin at his house and Rochelle needs some supplies for her campaign for class SGA rep. So we go to Total Crafts and get some stuff. We get a call from Andrew saying that his car overheated so he needs a ride home so Rochelle tells him that we'll just be in the store for like 5 minutes and we end up spending like 15 or 20 minutes there. Rochelle takes me home and I come home and feed my cat, watch the abcfamily channel and eat a steak and cheese sandwich :D

Tomorrow's gonna be an interesting day with A LOT of driving on my part. Oh boyyy...

"event","I really hate the feeling of being sick but it's struck me now with very unwelcoming arms >:[[ Lately life's been going by in a blur. It seems like I just took my Lang exam a week ago but it was just on Monday. Eh...that exam isn't worth worrying about anymore I think. I'm just relying SO MUCH on my essays and hopefully they were exceptionally good...=/ Then next Tuesday I need to conquer my chemistry exam...I have a feeling that I'll pass that one cuz you'd have to do pretty BAD to fail it and I think I have some hope of getting at least a 3. A 4 would be a miracle but a 3 is a large possibility.

It really seems like something is missing right now...ever get that feeling? But I just don't know what.

I had a really interesting conversation with Hyemi today when we stayed after school and it made me realize how much we understand each other. We talked about how after high school we should just try to do what we WANT instead of stressing about whether or not we're gonna get accepted into UVA. It really doesn't matter what college you get into, it just matters what you get out of it. You can perform your best and be the best you can be at any school you want, all you need is the faith, dedication, and committment to achieve it. Even if you earn a high reputation by going to a prestigious school, is that what you really want? Could you be somewhere else and feel a little more like you're in your place and that this could be where you want to spend the next 4 years in? Yeah, you could. I know I definitely can. I know several individuals who are just depending their life to get into a good school like UVA. I guess those kind of people just need to widen their options and see what the state of Virginia or what the country of America has to offer. I'm not bashing against UVA, it's a great school and everything but I'm starting to doubt whether it is what I would like. I suppose I'll figure everything out a year from now. =) 

It's when you have conversations like these when so much can be revealed about a person. We were just standing at the corner of Senior Hall, near the Japanese room where the fire extinguisher is. I kept on opening and closing it hehe. Anyway, I learned that her ultimate dream is to become a housewife. She's not even interested in earning money of her own. She wants to care for her family and be the best mom/wifey she can be. =) I thought that was really cool because so much of our friends are pursuing after the medical field so it started getting really repetitive. She also has aspirations to become a missionary to spread the word of God to those who are unaware. That also is majorly cool. I think I would really enjoy doing that as well especially if I go to a foreign country, preferably a Spanish one so that I can practice my ""skills."" :D 

I used to be unsure about whether or not to be a nurse. Around last summer I think I started to doubt that career choice because I thought it would be too hard for me. I think that was the reason why, I can't really remember. So I thought about being a teacher too. Then my mom asked me about the possibility of becoming a doctor. I pretty much refused to do that because it's too much school and I guess too hard? Eh I dunno I just wasn't interested. So my mom said she wanted me to become a doctor because they raise a lot more money than nurses. So if I become one, I'll be able to support not only myself but my mom by a lot. Earning more money seemed like a good idea. One of the reasons why I liked the option of becoming a nurse was that they earn pretty good salaries. I'm not sure why else I wanted it.

But now I know. When my dad was sick, I really liked the nurses that helped him. I formed a friendship with them and I knew all their names. I knew their personalities and I knew that they were there to care for him the best way they can. I could tell my dad liked them a lot too. I appreciated all of the work they did on my dad and I knew he did too. Another thing, I saw the nurses a heck of a lot more than I saw the doctors. This way nurses can have an even more closer and tighter relationship with their patients. I just want to care for others. To be there for them and help them through their struggle with life. I just want to make an impact somehow so that I could grow more as a person as well. I want to make a difference. That's all I want to do in life. If being a nurse is how I'm gonna get that then so be it. Now the idea of earning a good salary from this job is becoming more irrelevant. Money does NOT buy happiness! Hopefully this is the path that God wants me to follow because it sure is becoming hard to turn back now."

"event","My first SAT done today. I dunno whether to feel hopeful and optimistic or not to expect anything good at all. But I would like to get an exceptionally high score to satisfy myself and my mom too. She's counting on me to do good. =/ Maybe I'm worrying too much. 

Well I'm sorta interested in going to Boston College. It's private, Catholic, near Boston, and they have a nursing school. So far it sounds good to me because I've never really experienced the city life before and I've always had a small yearning to go and live it. I think Boston will be a pretty neat place to go to for college. That place is infested with colleges anyway. Also this sounds stupid but on Dawsons Creek most of the Creekers went to Worthington College which is a real school and that's in Boston. Maybe the show made Boston seem really attractive. Maybe I just want to find romance like Joey in Boston =P Hahahahaha.. Well who knows. I don't know enough about the school and I might not like it after awhile. I'm so confused!

I had a pretty busy day today and I haven't really had the chance to relax that much. After SATs I had to pick up Sarah from LB then we went to eat at Quiznos (SO GOOD) and went to Huntsman Lake to pick up trash for NHS. It got really tiring. I think I picked up like 50 beer cans. Sarah was real reluctant about picking up trash because apparently she's ""scared of all bugs"" -_-;; We gave up after only an hour and went to Pohick to study for the AP Lang exam. That didn't work out that well. We just ended up sitting there and reading books instead. Then I dropped her off at home and I went home for awhile. Then I had to leave again to pick up my mom. I dropped her off at the salon to get her hair cut and stuff and I went to the mall to get a birthday present for Rochelle and Esther. I am so indecisive...I kept on going inside stores then coming back out with nothing. It took me practically an hour to get Rochelle's and it's just a shirt. But it's a funny shirt and I think she'll like it =) I couldn't even get Esther a present cuz I had no freaking clue what to get so I guess I'm gonna have to save hers for later. Then I go home and I am insanely pooped and I still am. But I wanna stay up and watch SNL cuz it has Lindsay Lohan. =) I kinda like her.

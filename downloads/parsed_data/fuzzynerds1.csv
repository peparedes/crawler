"event","<center><u>An Ode To My NaNo Novel</u> 

So loves, we have a novelist, 
Who through dangers, toils and snares 
(such as sore throats and cramps and scares) 
Has achieved a feat 
Though stuffing a face with chocolate 
And surviving through cold winter feet 
Those Fifty Thousand Words 
Have gone down 
Just as she said they would 
And the characters are happy 
Or maybe they're sad 
I haven't quite figured out 
Exactly what's in Dathan's head 
But the ending 
(ah the ending) 
Is fantastic, so Ethan says 
An epic battle 
A teary admission 
All ending 
In a final condition 
A romantic position 

A wonderful mission 
A grand adventure 
Finally through 
Something Wicked 
It's so amatory 
It's got pirates and not the Jack Sparrow kind 
That filthy ragged swine 
But more of the Captain Black 
That dashing man of romance 
But his is another story 
To that I can attest 
Ms. Annie and her lover 
Running for cover 
Away from the soldiers 
Oh, no! What's that noise? 
Bleeding to death 
Crimson covering his chest 
Will he live? Or will he die? 
Oh, who and where and why? 
Back to the confession 
A final word a kiss 
Sweet and tender 
And complete, utter bliss 
But it's all for the better 
Dear Dathan and Annie 
Happily Ever After. 

The End.</center>

Rawr. I got to 50k at the write-in today. XD Tomorrow a private entry shall be posted outlining my entire plot. XD"

"event","Okay, so... yeah. I don't have much to say about today. It was mostly Annie's musings on the almost-but-not-really kiss between her and Dathan. Why did he pull back? Why did she want to kiss him? She doesn't even *like* him! Or does she? Is she just in denial?

So yeah. He's hot and he's awesome. But to have a little romance whilst they are in the middle of the woods running for their life is a bad idea. Dathan realizes that. Smart person. Which is all the more reason why she should totally fall in love with him. Right? Totally.

Oh, Dathan went back and searched the dead guy. Found some clothes for himself. Plus a really nifty sword and some jewelry with a weird symbol on it, and some currency he didn't recognize. So where is this mystery person from? Was he somebody important? Why the heck was he in the dark forest all by his onsie?

Yeah. Questions that will most likely NOT be answered in this book. That's right. But it may come in another book. Muah. You just have to read them all. Muahahaha. Isn't it a brilliant idea? Even if people don't LIKE my books, if they're mystery buffs they have to read the rest just to get all the subplots!!! HA!

"event","AAH! So, Dathan and Annie's theme song is ""Echo"" by Trapt. XD It's so pretty and so PERFECT!!! AAH! Go look up the lyrics, and you'll see a perfect description of the Dathan/Annie shipper. hehehhe. I expect SONGFICS when this thing is published. Muah.

Anyway. Who knew Dathan was such a charmer???? Seriously?? Totally hot AND suave? He totally takes after his dad. His dad was quite the charmer too. But we'll get to that near the end. XD Right now, we don't know who his dad is. Heck, HE doesn't even know who his dad is. Not his real one anyway.
But I'm getting ahead of myself. Anyway, I finally wrote that steamy scene in the waterfall. Too bad the sweet, fluffy, romantic part was cut off by a dead guy. Yeah. Sad.

"event","Yet another write-in today. I had a fun (as always) and managed to get over 6,000 words written. :-D that makes me happy. The first 3,000 words I wrote were boring fillers. The next 3,000, however, were a little more interesting. There was a humorous bit with a spider (Mandy's idea), a tiny bit of flirting (who can help it? Dathan is hot) and a perilous trek down a cliff. You see, they were heading for the river first. They got there and followed the river to a waterfall. What Dathan didn't tell Annie, however, was that they would come to the *top* of the waterfall, and they had to climb down. Yeah, that's not fun, because it's really high and the rocks are slippery. So, they almost died (which was fun) and Annie screamed a lot and fell on top of Dathan. That was fun too. I'm creating such a HUGE amount of sexual tension between the two of them. It's so much fun. Dathan is loosening up and relaxing a lot more now that they're a comfortable distance from the prison and there's still no evidence of anyone following them. So, he's a lot happier, and like I said, relaxed. He's also becoming more comfortable around Annie, and starting to be more interested in her as a girl rather than as a fellow escapee... Just wait until tomorrow. XD There's a pool of water that the waterfall flows into, where it then trickles down into a smaller river/creek thing. It's really pretty the way I picture it, and they spend a day or two there.
Anyway. Tomorrow will be *amazing*. Seriously. I have such awesome ideas. It begins with skinny dipping and ends with a dead body eaten by some unknown monster and covered in gold coins. Totally awesome, right? Yeah.

"event","Aah, another boring day of writing. That's right. Boring. I thought it would be amazing when they escaped, but so far it's not.

Well, except that I went back (whenever I get writer's block I go back over the story and try to add things) and added a mysterious woman to one of the first chapters. :-X That's right. She comes to visit Dathan. She takes him into another room to talk, so Annie has no idea what she said or what's going on, and he won't talk to her about it. XD The woman won't be in the rest of the novel (I don't think), but whatever she said to Dathan in that room will have an enormous impact on... um... something. I don't know what yet. X_X

So yes. Other than that, there is nothing really to say.

So anyway. Today's grandios adventure................... nothing.

That's right. Nothing. Annie about passed out from running so long, and once she caught her breath, looked around and discovered that they are in *dun dun dun* IATAC FOREST!!!! *gasp* otherwise known as the Dark Forest. Or the Forboding Forest. Or whatever evil name you want to give it. So, Dathan explains to her that it's perfectly okay, and that he's been playing in the forest since he was a little kid (a hint of his inner evil, I suppose? The evil forest does not harm him because he himself is evil? Or is it that Evil cannot be anywhere near such pure, angelic goodness?????)

So anyway. I used a quote from Macbeth today. ""By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes."" I love that quote. Seriously. I liked Macbeth. Well, I like Shakespeare in general. So y'know.

"event","<p align=""left"">Whoops. No update yesterday. X_X Not much writing yesterday either. I'm such a horrible procrastinator.
<br>BUT! I have big news for today! I made it past the 15k mark. *applause* And now our hero and his heroine are both running off into the woods! yaaay! Well, not really, because Annie is still barefoot, and Dathan is kind of lost. Well, he won't admit it, but he seriously is. He has a vague idea of where they're going, but not really. But he won't tell Annie that. So Annie's clueless. She's trusting blindly in him. Which can be good or bad. You decide. X_X

<P>So, they escaped. Can you pretend to hang yourself? Well, I suppose it doesn't matter if you can or can't, Dathan did. :-P Annie woke up, saw him hanging there, freaked out, the Filch-clone came around, saw Dathan there, cursed and mumbled to himself, then went in to remove his body. The guy took him down and BAM! *unconsciousness*. Who knew Dathan was that strong? Maybe eating the bug really did give him good luck. *cough*. You can thank Jimmu for that idea. Haha. It actually turned out to be a very, erm, interesting few paragraphs.

<P>In other news, I found the PERFECT theme quote for the novel! It's all Shakespeare stuff, and this one is from </p>

<P><center> ""And thus I clothe my naked villainy. With odd old  
ends stol'n out of holy writ, and seem a saint, when
most I play the devil.""</center>

"event","<p>I'm making Dathan quote Shakespeare. Of course, unless you actually know Shakespeare very thoroughly, you probably won't recognize some of them. Annie sure doesn't recognize them. Have you ever just looked at some of Shakespeare's one-liners? Seriously! Unless you know exactly what he's talking about, most of them are like ""... wtf?"" Go Google them. Or Ask Jeeves. Or whatever. Seriously.<br /><br />So, the evil General whats-his-name (yes, he has a name in the story... I just prefer calling him evil General whats-his name XD) slapped Annie for insulting him with a lot of big words. (Who else loves doing that? Insulting with big words? So much fun. XD Confuses people with lesser vocabularies). So, Dathan sees the red mark on her cheek and is all like, ""OMG! How dare the bastard! The Plan must now come into action! We strike tomorrow at dawn!"" Well, not literally like that, but whatever.&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't know if they'll actually get out tomorrow or not. Maybe. Ha. I still don't know exactly how they're going to escape. *Come on, Great And Fantastic Muse Ethan, think of something!* I do know, though, that it's going to be amazing. The turning point in the story. The most totally awesome beginning ever. Even though it's not really the beginning because it's like five chapters in, it's still the beginning of the journey home. Think LOTR and when Bilbo is pushed out the door by Gandalf. That's when the real story starts. So, Dathan going all McGyver with a rope, a stick and a dead&nbsp;rat or something is the beginning of this story.<br /><br />*loves* and *hugs*<br />-Rachy<br /><br />Word Count Today: 1267<br />Word Count Total: 11,041<br />Word Count Required: 8,335<br />Sanity: 92%</p><p>My favorite Word of the Day:<br />mendacious</p>"

"event","<p>So there was a write-in at the Tallahassee Library today. I was extremely happy. I had a lot of fun meeting everybody and talking about the randomness of our novels (almost all of us have pirates in our novels somewhere), and I got a lot done. 4k in three hours! woot! And a week has already passed in my story. Ha. So, the execution of 'the plan' is coming nearer and nearer. Dathan and Annie found a way to look out the window (Annie standing on Dathan's shoulders... a risky business considering she hates heights and he's skinny) and now have somewhat of an idea of their surroundings. Well, Dathan does at least. I think. Maybe.<br />Eight days have passed, and since Annie refuses to answer evil General whats-his-name's questions about her father's plans in the war, he has taken away all of her meals. But Dathan, being as nice and totally awesome as he is, has decided to give her his supper every night (but he keeps his breakfast). Not the best, but hey. It's better than nothing at all, right? At least, that's what she figures.<br />So, the first person thing is working out pretty well, because Annie has a LOT to say. I think I said that before, but it's becoming so much more apparent in later chapters. She's kind of ditzy, too. I didn't mean to do that. But she tries her best, and for that she gets kudos. She talks so much though. It's great for word count, but for the actual plot? That remains to be seen.<br /><br />That's it for this issue. *loves*<br />-Rachy<br /><br />Word Count Today: 4,106<br />Word Count Total: 9,774<br />Word Count Required: 6,668<br />Sanity: 97%</p><p>My favorite Word of the Day:<br />repudiate</p>"

"event","Today's writing was rather... um... interesting. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Dathan is getting weirder and weirder. He's not normal. Though, of course, we have to consider the fact that he has been in prison for the past year and a half, and therefore has no social skills at all. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. *cough*. I think. X_X 

I found out today that Annie has this really crazy paranoia of being considered a child. Maybe because she's the youngest. ooooh. So yes, we're getting deeper into her psyche, and past her ramblings. The whole thing is in first person, from her perspective, and let me say... she talks a lot. She has a comment on EVERYTHING. It's ridiculous. Completely. So yes. 

That was today. XD I apologize for the boring entry. But it's interesting to me. Annie is suddenly a lot more appealing to me today than she was yesterday or the day before. It's always a good thing to actually *like* your MC's.

"event","I have hit an astounding revelation.

Dathan is a long-lost ancestor of Ethan. XD

So today I began describing him, and he looks nothing like any of my other characters (though his hair has a vague resemblance to Aron's, only longer), except his eyes. He has Ethan's eyes. And I totally did NOT mean to do that. It just kind of... happened.

And then, he and Annie began having their first conversation. She asks how long he's been in prison. He answers, ""About a year and a half. I've only been in this one a couple months though. The other one kind of burned down.""

O_O

Okay, for those of you who don't know, Ethan's parents were killed because HIS HOUSE BURNED DOWN. Um, yeah. So... is Dathan an ancestor of Ethan Lucas? Possibly descended from the great dread pirate Marcus Black? Am I stretching for Ethan connections? You bet I am.

Still, isn't it a funny coincidence? That I seriously didn't mean to do? Or maybe Ethan did. Ethan, you snarky little muse, you.

"event","The insanity has begun, darlings. The first bit of writing in my novel now marks the first official entry into my writing journal.

So far, I've got this ridiculous monalogue about nothing (that takes up about 500 words), and a first chapter that gives a lot of background information and personality stuff that the story doesn't really need. I actually like the prologue. It's really mysterious and junk, if a bit weird. It goes on about a river, and secrets. It describes the land that our dear heroine Anastasia, and her brooding lover Dathan will have to cross. Well, okay, he's not her lover now, but he will be. Maybe. If things go the way I think they will (which they probably won't). My characters have a crazy habit of not listening to me when I tell them to do something. Example: Anastasia was supposed to be intelligent, brave, etc. and she's turning out to be more naive and little-girly.
2000 words in, and Dathan hasn't even come into the story yet. Tomorrow. Maybe. I can't wait to describe him. I'll post that little blurb here. He's pretty hot, in my humble opinion. Of course... that's just me. And I created him. Muaha.

Um, yeah, that was a super lame entry, but I don't care. It'll get more interesting as the plot develops.

Stay tuned for ""NaNoWriMo: Day Two"", coming tomorrow."

"event","I hate first posts, but I figured I'd better make one anyway. Unless I decide to brainstorm, the next one won't be until November 1st, when I begin writing for my NaNoWriMo novel. XD Some of those posts will be private, some will be friends only, and some yet will be public. It'll depend on my mood and what I post. So yes. It'll be fabulous. This is where I'll get all my musings down. I'll write religiously every day, I promise, even if it's just my Word Count.

So. My Novel. I told my dear friend Jimmu that I had four plots to choose from, and that I was putting a poll on my website and my myspace, he said, <B>""Oh, so in true Rachy fashion, you're going to choose the one that gets the least votes, right?""</B>

I told him no, but that ended up being exactly what I did. XD

Title: 
Untitled so far 
Plotline: 
A fantasy novel based on a brainstorm for a 2002 novel set in a faraway, forgotten land in which two lands are at war. The princess of one is kidnapped, and put in prison with a young man, a so-called fugitive and traitor. With his help, she escapes, and in exchange for saving her life and guiding her back to her home he will be rewarded and allowed to reside in her country. Yay for him. BUT! Yes, there's a but! What was this man in prison for? Was he simply a prisoner of war? Or did he actually do something? He's proved kind and wonderful and too good to be true thus far. Can she really trust him? Is he really as perfect as he seems? 
Main Character(s): 
Dathan and Anastasia"

Agenda for the next few days:

1. Play and complete Resident Evil 4 a few times
2. Shop
3. Work
4. Revise for exams

Might not get beyond the first item on the list though. :p Except obviously item 3. Speaking of which, I heard another rumour today that I might be back in Cardiff permanently. That is until I'm needed in Swansea again, which I fear will be sooner than I think. I'm seriously considering leaving anyway. Let's see what this new store opening brings...

Miss my Ju. :( The washing up is mounting up."

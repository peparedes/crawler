We got picked up around 11 somethin and i got home around 11:20ish maybe? idk and idk when i went to bed either
Friday-wtf happened friday? um i dont think i did anything til football pracitce at 3. That went 3-8. After that i came home and just chilled i think, i cant even remember im so tired.
Saturday-Woke up around 10:00 and helped my dad get ready for his trip. Loaded some songs onto his and my moms ipod and shit like that. He left for romania around 11:30. After he left i think i just hung out til i had to be at school @ 4 for the red and white game. That was pretty dumb, idk i guess it was ok. It sucked though cuz first play of the game schoeck (or however the f you spell his name) went down and like broke or tore somethin in his ankle. other wise it was pretty good. After i got home around 9:30, the night gets interesting. I went over to jeffs and watched 40 days and 40 nights with jeff and mike. after that mike went home and at 11:30 (when i was supposed to be home) me and jeff went to my house cuz i was gonna show him our new computer quick. SO i go to the front door:locked. I go and open the garage and try to go in that door:locked. I got to our side door by our patio:locked. I got to the sliding doors by our patio:locked. So i was locked out. Me and jeff spent a good 40 minutes throwing rocks at my brothers window and my sisters window but got nothin. So we went and broke into pongs house for no reason. Then we went back to jeffs and played nfl blitz and watched boy meets world. BY now it was like 1:15 and so we went upstairs and wrote notes and posted them on my windows so when my mom woke up she would know where i was. so we did that and went to bed. Then at 4 in the morning my mom calls me on my cell phone and was like hey where are u? and i was like im at jeffs cuz i got locked out. And she was like o ok come home in the morning for church and then she hung up. I went back to sleep
Today-Got up at 8 and went home. Then went to church @ 9:30, that was boring as ever. afterwards we went to brookfield square and i got a few new shirts and AE and stuff. Then we went home and i mowed the front lawn. Then we went to jeffs and played mario party. At like 6:00 we broke into pongs and played pingpong. I won a dollar from jeff. I went home after that and went to my grandmas. Didnt get home til late. I got ready for bed and here i am. Got football bright and early tomorrow morning though so fuck it i better go to bed.

Monday/Tuesday-all i remember is i had football camp and drums and probably played tennis
Wednesday-Football, then went to elizabeths pool party with some folks from my eighth grade class last year, then my mom picked me and jake up and we went mini golfing with elise and her friend sam from oostburg. That was fun but it was like 7 bucks but we kept are balls cuz we figured we payed for them in the cost anyways. Whatever, i do what i waont!
Thursday-football again, but it got rained out by about 12:30 so i went back to pauls and hung out til about 3. Then i walked home and did some work. Mark picked me up about 6:30 to go to brittanys. That was fun, except for some stuff...but it was still pretty fun. Idk my dad picked a bunch of us up at like 10:45ish and then i came home. I dont remember schwat the haik haipened aifter thait but schwat eiver.
Friday-Slept in, did some chores and stuff. i was gonna go up to jakes lake cottage but my mom said no cuz there was a going away party for these people we knew and she wanted me to go. but i begged and she was like well if you can figure out how to get a hold of them and see them before you leave you can go. i tried like 4 numbers and didnt get through on any of them so i gave up. but then my mom found this place where this woman used to work and called there and got a number. She got through and arranged a meeting. So i met them at this church for like 5 minutes tops and went back home, and about 5 minutes later jake picked me up. It was tight we listened to blink the whole way up. Once we got up there (around 6:30) we played nintendo 64. AFter that we ate steak and otherstuff and then played more nintendo 64. Elizabeth got up there at like 10:45 and came over and we started watching 50 first dates around 11. She had to go at like 12 though so me and jake finished the movie and watched elimidate and went to bed. The next day consisted of nintendo, breakfast, nintendo, swimming with elizabeth, nintendo, eating stuff, nintendo, nintendo, nintendo, going over to elizabeths and messing around, playing a card game @ elizabeths which i totally dominated, and drinking like at least 8 sodas a piece through out the day. WE left around 9:45ish i believe. Listened to the mark tom and travis show the whole way back. I got home and went to bed around 11. I WOuld update more but i gotta go to jeffs now so ill update today tomorrow. peace kids"

So i left the party, and me and evan went and played tennis from about 8:45 til it got to dark to see. We came home and bounced on the trampoline. Then we went in my basement and hung, his dad picked him up about 10ish maybe. After he left i went back to mikes and hung out some more. I cant remember what time i came home. Actually afterwords now that i think about it jeff and mike came back to my place and we just hung out for like 2 hours. I went to bed i think around 4:00.

Idk it was like me brittany josh maxx zack (for about an hour only though cuz he had acting school?) mark kristina leah sam evan michelle stephanie for part of it greg for part of it and i think that thats it.

Hung there for a while, then biked to sams and josh biked home. Then we biked back to evans. Then we biked to east and played tennis for two hours. And then we didnt have a watch and we had basketball at 8:40 (well me and sam did anyways) so i asked some guy and he was like its 7:34. So i was like o shit i gotta get home so we packed up and sam went home and i helped evan carry stuff back to his house. I made it back to my house in a record time of 10 minutes! i was cruisin. Then i went and played basketball, we shoulda won but we lost by like 3 so it was pretty gay. After that i came home and money mike came over. He messed with a bunch of people on my buddy list but w/e its all good. My dad was like go to bed at like 12 and he stayed til like 1:30 haha we've pretty much done that every night for a while except usually jeffs over too. I went to bed around 2:30. This morning i got up and felt like shit. Idk why but i did. But i went to strength anyways and felt better after a little while. Kristina gave me a massage that felt pretty good haha. I got home arouned 10:30 i think. Called up ping pong to play tennis. We were on our way up to the park when J started comin down the road. He stopped and then said hed meet us at the park.

"event","Alright so my weekend was like super busy! Friday was my birthday and fun day. Went to school and senior awards, that was pretty effing boring and it hurt my butt sitting on it for so long. Then i went to all my classes for like 13 minutes each and in every class all we did was nothing at all so it was tight. Then we had fun day. The first band sucked. They played music OK but sucked at singing and sucked at imitating green day. The second band that played was cool. We played some volley ball against the teachers. And we ate and stuff too. After that we went in the gym and watched teachers do gross stuff. Then they had a raffle. I won swat on dvd so that was good. We also got are year books. Then i went to baseball which was gay. Im so effing sick of baseball, ESPECIALLY EFFING COACH MOWLES! NEXT TIME HE TELLS ME TO DO SOMETHING IM GOING TO TELL HIM TO DO IT INSTEAD! and then tell him to shut up. Anyways then we took maxx and zack back to my house. We ate dinner, then jake and mark came over. We jumped on the trampoline and played drums and guitar and watched dumbcrap videos. haha it was pretty cool. They all went home around 11. Then i stayed up late on the computer and looking at the yearbook. I went to bed around 1. Saturday I woke up probably about 7:45. Took a shower and then headed over to baseball. We had a double header and lost both or games. But then again what else is new? afterwards i went home and took another shower. Then my parents picked up maxx and we went to the imax. We saw both the imax shows for the extra credit in biology. That was pretty boring. When those were done we took maxx home and stuff. Then i mowed the front lawn and ate dinner. Then i hung out for a while. Around 10:15 Kristina and Brittany called for no reason. I talked to them for about 1/2 hours - 45 minutes while i was waiting for my neighbors to get home from their gf's houses. Then around 11 they came home. I went over to jeffs and we chilled and played ps2. Later i came home and went to bed. Sunday i woke up and went to church. Then i went to the zoo for biology. I saw erik, josh, zack, maxx, brittany, kristina, matt, david, ellie, mike, and i think thats it but there were probably more. We walked aorund doing the sheet. Then me and zack and maxx went off by ourselves and ate. I ate a pizza, a hot dog, a mountain dew, and a tripple scoop of blue moon. After the zoo brynn picked up me zack kristina and brittany and we headed over to the on the edge party. That was pretty fun. I got my face covered in cake frosting. We kept trying to play tackle football but kept getting interrupted which sucked i was pissed. After that i came home and probably finished my homework or something, i dont really remember. Anyways now its tuesday and im effing tired. Today i went in to student help around 10:10. All i had to do was hand in my biology book and hand in my LOF worksheet for welter cuz shes a fag. Then i hung out with paul for a while. My grandparents picked me up around 10:55. I went over there and helped them with their computer. Then my grandpa made me a huge breakfast. I had a ton of hashbrowns, 3 eggs, 6 strips of bacon, and two pieces of toast. They took me back to school about 11:30. I get to school only to find out i have summer P.E. at 12 not 1. So i go out to baseball and do some soft toss and then i came back in. Then we did our weight and fat testing stuff. After that we had to do all our physical fitness testing which sucked cuz i just ate that huge breakfast. I got 8.17 on the shuttle run which is 5th best in the school right now. Otherwise i didnt do to well in much else. My stomach hurt so bad throughout the whole mile! After that i went to baseball for like 15 minutes. After that i played soccer with kristina, brittany, and andrea. Haha that was pretty cool. Then i came home and later went to maxx's. We worked on biology and tehn we hadda go to his grandmas house cuz she was gone and she needed people to be there cuz people were coming to pick up stuff from her house so yeah idk? anyways we studied more there and his mom got us mcdonalds. Around 7 we went back to maxx's and watched american idol. GO BO! then we studied biology more and hung out. Then we had a hillarious conversation which is to hard to explain but watchout its going to appear in a movie in like 15 more years or so! You will be laughing your ass off. Mr. Lebieki took me home around 9:15ish i think. That car ride was oc. We were laughing the whole time at the stuff we came up with. When i got home i went on the computer and then studied some more for woods. Right now its about 11 o' clock and im really tired so ima prolly head to bed, goodnight.

"event","Alright I'll start with the weekend again...

Friday-school, baseball was cancelled which basically gave me a huge boner and i probably orgasmed twice. Came home and chilled, then went to cori's house. The party was pretty sweet. Had a lot of guy talks with the guys, and greg got thrown into the pool, how cool is that?

Saturday-Saturday i woke up probably around 10:30 and i had to help clean the garage right away. That sucked. Then after that i went to kohls and got like 50 new polo shirts. Well not 50, mor like 10. And then  i went to the fine arts concert. It was pretty good. Men's Chorus (my choir) didnt do to good, but o well. Band we did alright i guess. Aladdin was tight and stuff though. I came home and watched the movie, then i watched it again on sunday cuz its amazing. It was also fun just hanging out with people at the concert. I came home watched saturday night live and aladdin as i said. O yeah my sister got in a car accident too. No one was hurt, but the accord is most likely totalled. Which kinda sucks cuz i liked that car but its also cool cuz we'll probably be getting a new car now. 

Sunday-Went to church, Did 8 algebra assignments, played xbox, watched aladdin, watched the simpsons, watched family guy, other wise my day was quite uneventful.

Today (monday)- Today was a good day. Went to school til 4th hour, then i got to caddy. It was a lot of walking and my feet hurt pretty bad, but the guys i caddied for were really cool and i made 60 bucks off of them. It was pretty tight, whenever they'd mess up they be like FUCK! or SHIT! and they called eachother dipshits which i though was cool because adam sandler calls his caddy dipshit in happy gilmore. So after that i went to my drum lesson and then came home, and hung out and showered and ate and stuff. Now i should do homework. Peace."

"event","Wow i have not written in the forsaken journal in effing forever. Time for a change. Alright well since i dont remember anything from liek 2 weeks ago ill just start with this past week...

Monday-School, baseball, drum lesson, you know the drill

Tuesday-same thing except for the fact that i had a baseball game which we lost as normal, and i didnt have a drum lesson, so basically it wasnt the same at all? yeah 

Wednesday-Same as monday, besides no drum lesson

Thursday-Same as tuesday excecpt in our game i had a tripple which was sweet, and otherwise nothing else happened i can think of, except biology class was tight with brittany and josh and erik, thats goes for everyday too, cuz everyday we make fun of paris (the black girl who sits in front of us who thinks she knows everything, wears the same coat everyday, and wears her bra outside here shirt(i mean seriously come on now who does that?). what a fag), and the guy on the video.

Friday-So it was tight because we didnt have baseball practice, cuz our field was sopping, and then i went home, moWED THE WHOLE LAWN, then i was going to go to marks, but he decided saturday would be better, so then i was going to go to the movie, and then i didnt because everybody was a fagball and didnt want to go. Then i couldnt do nething with maxx because he was doing stuff with stephanie. Then i was going to do something with my neighbor but he was down in illinois.So guess what i did friday night? Sat around at home watching Oceans Twelve and playing the new star wars game, which is pretty tight. I went to bed around 1:30. 

Saturday-Then saturday i got up about noon. I ate breakfast and then i went outside and weeded our rasberry bushes for like 2 and 1/2 hours. That sucked. Then i jumped on the trampoline and got soaked cuz it was raining hard and we were pouring water on ourselves? yeah idk what we were thinking i think i contracted hypothermia, but me and my brother are tight like that. So then i went inside and took a shower. mmmm hot steamy shower completely naked...ok im done now. After that i cleaned my room. Then i loaded up my drums and headed over to marks house. Me mark and jake rocked out for a while, then paul came over. Then we rocked some more. Then we burned a rap cd, like literally set it on fire. Then we played basketball. After we were sick of that (like 5 minutes haha) we filmed a whole buncha shit about satan. It started me and mark. Basically you have to see it if your a somebody. It's rated R for intense moment, partial nudity, and language. I hope your 17. Haha most scenes is me screaming satan, mark is satan, and then he beats me up. And its the funniest shit you'll ever see. At least its funny to us lol. So after that we made kinda a music video. and also we did other stuff. Marks little brother is scared for life lol. Then on the way home we hung these sweet light up fans out the windows and the driver in back of got super pissed. Dude turned on his brights and then passed us up after he got real sick of us. Well yeah friday is pretty much the story of my life. Im heading out tomorrows mothersday goodnight!

Monday-school, baseball, chilled.

Tuesday-School, baseball game, chilled.

Wednesday-School, baseball, chilled.

Thursday-School, baseball game which was complete bullshit. First of all, Coach didnt play me at all except for a little bit. Second of all we lost. Third of all coach had no reason not to play me. That pissed me off., chilled

Friday-Woke up around 9:30 or so, brushed me teeth and stuff, then i ate breakfast for once. After that i went on the computer cuz i was trying to figure out when to meet brittany at student help. She was away so i just figured id go around 11. So i showered and went to student help eventually. Me and brit did our bio lab. Then me and c tank went to religion to put a string on my religion project. Then we went to show mrs lamping my flash cards. Then we just chilled. I saw paul and some ohter people too. About 12:10 i left school. I went to the library to get some movies, then went to blockbuster to get more movies, and after that i went to subway for lunch. Once i got home i did work around my house cuz my sister was having a bunch of friends over. When i was done cleaning i hung out and then around 8ish i headed over to pauls house. That was fun. Me and paul played basketball while andrew and maxx went to stephanies. We were going to go, but someone had to stay home and let pauls mom know what was going on so i stayed with paul and played basketball. Then pauls mom came out and asked where maxx and andrew were and paul said they went to stephanies house. She got a little bit mad i think, but not to mad. When they came back they said they went to sentrys and it all worked out. Then we did some other stuff 0:). We went to bed around 1ish i think. 

Saturday-Woke up around 10 and ate breakfast. Then we had to clean up outside because someone egged the halsteads house. It was nasty folks. When we were done with that we went over to immanuel and shot hoops. Me and paul domintaed maxx and drew. It was pretty fun. Then we went back to pauls and my parents picked me up around 12:30 i think. I went home and bid on a phone. Then we cleaned the area of my basement that isnt done. That sucked. Then my parents and brother went to church because my dad is leaving for china tomorrow. His limmo picks him up at like 7:45 AM sunday morning. So i went over to my neighbor jeffs house because all his relatives were over and we were going to hoop it up. He got his liscense today and a car for his bday so thats tight. We can cruise now right jeff? haha then we played basketball. I had to go about 6ish cuz my parents and brother were meeting my sister and me at olive garden. We got there and had to wait for like an hour to be seated. The food was good though as usual. Then my sister drove my brother and me home while my parents and little sister waited for the bill and stuff. The rest of the night i kinda just chilled. Now im up in my room writing this but im pretty tired so ima hit the sack. Goodnight."

"event","alright so where did i leave off?

Monday-Typical day, school and baseball and drum lessons, it was also my sisters birthday
Tueaday-School, then we got killed in our game against hartford, then i went home and celebrated my sisters bday with relatives. My grandma made the food and cake so it was really good. Then later that night my stomach started to hurt. I went to bed early.
Wednesday-then at about three in the morning i puked. Then i puked again at 6 in the morning. Then i stayed home from school and slept til like 12:30, then just hung out and did homework. I worked on my religion project from like 7PM-1:30AM. After that i went to bed.
Thursday-I went to school, then we had a baseball game against hartford again at hartford. The place smelled like shit literally. And we lost. Then i went home and i dont even remember what i did. Im sure eventually i went to bed though...
Friday-Overall friday was a lotta fun. School was a drag and took forever as usual. Then baseball happened and that sucked pretty much too. Then my dad picked me up late cuz he forgot he was supposed to pick me up. Then we picked up my little sister at my grnadparents house and spent like 45 minutes settting up their email on their new computer. Then i went home and showered and changed. I ate dinner and headed over to jakes house. Finally i got to see coner! it had been forever. Its hillarious he went through puberty haha his voice is actually dead. It was me, jake, mark, zack, evan, sam, coner, anna, liz, april, gemma, and brittany steffes. That night was pretty oc in general. Me and zack ran away once, that was pretty fun. Then we played mario party and chilled. Then the rest of the night basically just talked with people and stroked anna's hair lol. That was pretty cool, it smelled good. Got home around 11:30. I hung out and went online. Then i ate food and played gameboy color for the first time in like 3 years. It was pretty sweet. Then i went to bed around 1.

Saturday- I slept til about 9:45. I got up and ate breakfast for once cuz my dad made a big breakfast cuz my brother had like 4 of his friends sleep over friday night. Then i helped take 50 some huge garbage bags of dead grass that we got from thatching our lawn. it took 2 trips even with taking the seats out in the suburban. Then i helped deep clean our suburban. Its so nice now, we washed the carpets and everything else. Then i left for my baseball game at like 2:45. Coach mowles threw some batting practice. Then we went over to madison park. Our game started @ 4:15. It was the longest game ever. They had really slow pitchers which was cool, i got home on a grounder i hit lol. its technically not a home run because they made erorrs but w/e. It went til like 7:15. It took up 3 fricken hours of my night i was pissed. Maxx took me home. Then i hung out the rest of the night and talked to people and played xbox and made cookies and jello. Then i had a spicy conversation with anna on the internet which was pretty interesting lol. Me and tank had a kick ass conversation too. I dont remember what i did the rest of the night...probably nothing. I think i went to bed around 1 again.

Today (Sunday)-Woke up around 8:50 and took a shower. Then i went to church. We were late as usual. After church we went to the us cellular store to get me a new phone...but they were closed for a meeting? i was like what? so then we went to allen edmonds cuz my dad wanted to get himself some new shoes. After that we went to mens wearhouse to get my dad some shirts. We saw alex halstead, his girlfriend, and his mom shopping for a tux for prom. After we didnt find what we were looking for we left and went to the mall. Here comes the bad part of my day. I went to get a haircut cuz my hair was getting really long. Ok so then the ladys like what do you want done and i was like i need a trim. She was like ok...and it was all downhill from there! She chopped off a ton of my hair, way more than i ever wanted. It took over 30 minutes. And now its really short and i hate it. Jeeze the nerve of hair dressers these days...yuck. Then we went and got something to eat. After that we looked at cars for fun. Then we went to the us cellular kiosk to get me a new phone there. But they didnt have what i was looking for so i didnt get one :(. Then we came home and i cleaned my room for like 2 hours. It looks a lot better now. Then i made my little sister dinner and biked over to maxx's house. We played guitar and drums for a while and then biked random places. We thought of a whole bunch shit to do in summer ill prolly end up getting arrested like 6 times. O well, its all in good fun right? After that i biked home and here i am now. I CANT WAIT FOR FLIPPIN' SUMMER!"

"event","Alright so friday i woke up at about noon. I got ready to go and ate breakfast. Then i biked over to maxx's house where i fixed his sister's guitar string. Then we got ready for baseball and went to our baseball game. Coach threw some batting practice and then we walked to madison park where we had our game. We won like 9-3 or something. The other team really sucked. Then after that i went home and showered. Then I got my stuff together and went to the lock in. I got there at about 8 instead of 7:30 cuz our baseball went later than expected and idk it just took me a while to shower and get my stuff together. So when i got there and talked to taylor and people and then just chilled with people. Then this basketball performer guy spoke and did tricks with basketballs. After that we had a dodgeball tournament. Lets see on my team i had andrew e., joey, liz, and some other chicks. We dominated and won the whole tournament. It was tight. Then after that played basketball, freshman boys vs freshman girls(mostly MLHS people), and the boys killed it was pretty fun. Then at about 2 the girls had to leave. So me collin and maxx went over to where the girls were and started playing drums with some of the seniors who were playing guitar and piano. Then we had to leave. So we went back to the school and played some more dodgeball. Then we were played baseball kinda with like a big cardboard batlike thing and the balls we used for dodgeball. After that we had a full court game of basketball and played for at least and hour and a half. It was me, maxx, jake, collin, collin, mitch, joey, paul, and dan. I think that was it. But that was a lot of fun. After that all the seniors went upstairs and hung out and all the freshmen except for like me, collin, maxx, zack, and jake went to bed. We hung out and talked and stuff. Liz and emily (i think that was her name) snuck over and we tlaked for like 1 minute before we though someone is coming and then they went back. Later on they came back and tlkaed to us in the back of the gym. Then i faked like i was a leader talking and they thought it really was a leader and they took off. It was funny. Then me (larry bird) and collin (steve nash), played jake and maxx in basketball. Haha that was pretty tight. Then me and collin snuck over to the church to talk with the girls again. Jake and maxx didnt wanna take a chance at getting caught so they stayed behind. We talked to them again for a little longer this time. Then we went back and chilled some more. we kept buzzing the scoreboard horn throughout the night haha. Then at like 5 or so brought in a bongo drum into the multipurpose room where all the freshmen and two of the leaders were sleeping. Then me and collin hit it as hard as we could for like 5 seconds. It was so funny. Maxx got framed for it lol. Then we took it into the hallway and collin beat on it again and mr bremer got pretty pissed. Jake and maxx made it safely into the multipurpose room without getting caught and me and collin tried to like hide behind tables lol. Then we were like screw it and i just lied down and he just sat there lol. O well it wasnt that big of a deal he was like stop beating that drum thats enough. Then maxx and jake went to bed. Me and collin couldnt sleep so we went for a jog on burleigh to where the big drive in thing for brook east is. Then we called the girls and told them to meet us but some of them were sleeping and they didnt want to get caught or something? idk so me and collin talked and then went inside. Then we lied down by the door lol cuz it was colder in there. Then mr. smith went over to the church with the bongo drum. we ran after him cuz we wanted to wake up all the girls but he wouldnt let us. Then we layed down on the church steps haha. We stayed there for a little while. Then we heard a m otorcycle and went to check it out. idk  it was weird. But then we went back over to the school and layed by the doors and talked some more. Then the girls came over about 7ish prolly. then they went to get anna and came back. we chilled for prolly about  half hour at least, prolly longer. Then mrs smith brough donuts and we ate breakfast. EP got orange juic in my eye when she threw a cup the still had a little bit of orange juice in it at me. haha that stung. Then i got my stuff together and got picked up at about 9:15. Then i went home and took a shower. I kinda fell asleep when i was waiting for the water to heat up. Then i took a shower and went to bed around 10ish. I slept til around 12:15. After i woke up i got my stuff together and ate a little bit but just some chips. Then i went to baseball. We did warmups and stuff then we had our game at three. I brough nacho cheese buegels for myself cuz i was hungry and maxx and matt stole like half of them wen i wasnt looking. Ha that kinda sucked cuz i was hungry. We won our game by the slaughter rule after the 6th inning cuz we were up by 10. Final score was us 13 riverside JV 3. So yeah i had 2 base hits. One was a bunt that i prolly should have made it to first on but as the ball was coming in i got in the way and it hit me so i made it. The second hit was just a nice grounder. After that game i came home. Then i had to help my dad thatch the lawn for 3 fucking hours! it took so long, and that was just the front lawn. We worked til after dark. I better get payed a lot for that. Afterwards i came inside and at like 8:30 i ate dinner. Later at about 10 something i went to bed. This morning i had trouble getting up cuz i was still tired. Then i had church at like 9:30. Then after that my sister took me and herself home and my parents and brother stayed for another service cuz they always teach the 2 and 3 yr olds for 3rd service. Now im finally finishing this entry, its taken a while to write this cuz i keep  remembering things that happened and its pretty long. Alright now i gotta help with the back yard and go to my sister and grandmas birthday party at my aunts house."

"event","Alrighty then so tuesday...i think...i dont remember and im to lazy to look but anyways i think i didnt do much. main things i did was just  go to school, play xbox, go to the library, had baseball practice. Same with wednesday. Today i didnt wake up until like 12 or something around there. Then i rode up to walgreens and bought some mac n cheese for like 99 cents cuz no one was home and there was nothing to eat. Then i went over to karl's country market to buy a soda cuz they dont have black bear soda at walgreens. When i was checking out i almost called the casheir a nigger. Cuz he was being a bitch about stuff. but i wont get into that. Then i went home and made my lunch. Came online and talked to people. Then i had baseball at 3-5. That was ok but not really cuz  i dont really like baseball hardly at all. So yeah first game tomorrow, or rather today now since its like 1. After that i was going to go to maxx's house but then his parents wouldnt let him have neone over so he came over here. Then we played guitar and drums and jumped on my trampoline and rode up to carls again. Haha friday night is going to be so tight with the jolt. Me and maxx come up with the tightest and funniest stuff ever haha. Then we came back over here and played xbox. He went home around 9:30. Then my mom told me i had to watch a sex talk video thing. It was so boring. All the stuff i normally hear. But i think it was because they found eurotrip. i forgot to take it outa the dvd player after i watched it. I can be so dumb sometimes haha. But after telling me what a bad descision i made and everything they gave it back? my mom was like i dont want this in our house and then gave it back i was like ok thanks for giving it back. haha well after the video i played xbox with my brother. then i came online and talked to people. then i just watched tv and tried to sleep but couldnt. Right now im talking to ashley, brittany, kristina, and sarah cuz theyre all at britts house, and im talking to cori, and zack cuz he cant sleep either. But im hoping the rest of the weekend will be tight. Otherwise nothing else is new..."

"event","Ok so friday i woke up and went to school, which kinda sucked. Then had baseball practice. After that zack came back to my house and me zack and my dad went to karls country market to get some tenderloin and other stuff to grill and make for dinner. Then my dad made dinner and me and zack walked up to walgreens. Then came back and ate dinner. After that we went and played xbox for a little longer. A little later we went to blockbuster to get urban ledgends...but it was gone which sucked. So we were going to rent man on fire cause zack had never seen it before but my dad was like well we should just buy it. So we ended up buying man on fire, cellular, and spider man 2 cuz there was a buy two movies get one free movie. So yeah we went home and watched man on fire. Then we went on the computer and after that we watched euro trip...POPE 8, HETHANS 0! haha gotta love that movie! Then we went to bed and on saturday we just hung out and set up my trampoline. Then we had baseball @ 3. That was ok i guess. After that i came home and ate dinner and vacuumed the kitchen. Then i went over to pauls house to watch the basketball game. It was me, paul, maxx, mark, jake and zack. We didnt end up watching the basketball game anyways. Instead we went to brittany steffes house and rang her doorbell. And she came out and said she was grounded. Then her mom came out and was like ""You get your ass back in the house before i kick it!"" haha it was pretty funny. Then we went all the way over to jamies house and she pretty much got raped, not really but you know. Then we went back to pauls house and just hung out. It was fun. Then after that maxx took me back to my house to get clothes and stuff. Then we went and picked up korri cuz she was at a birthday party. After that we went back to maxx's house and chilled. Ellie came over cuz she was having a sleepover with korri. Me and maxx took ps2 up to his room to watch euro trip. It didnt work cuz it was burned by some chinese fag named wang. Yeah cuz my neighbor got it while he was over it china. Alright so then we gave the ps2 to the girls so theyd give us some cookies. Then maxx tried to get the dvd player outa his moms room and failed. She woke up and was yelling at him, it was pretty funny. So then we just talked and chilled til like 2 cuz we were waiting for his dad to fall asleep on the couch downstairs so we could come down and watch eurotrip on his computer. So we go downstairs and his dad is snoring. We watched the whole movie and his dad didnt even wake up. By the end of the movie it was like 4 something or other so we went upstairs and went to bed. Then sunday we went to 11 o'clock church at grace. I saw andrew polahar and chip, i was hoping to see brittany too but she went to saturday church. O well. Then we stopped at Karls country market on the way home from church and picked up some ham and stuff for sandwhiches. Then we went home and took showers and ate. After that maxx rode his bike over to my house and i jogged. I got my bike and then we rode to mcdonalds and around the falls and stopped at chelsea's house. It was fun but we could only stay for like 1/2 hour cuz i had to go home and clean my room and be home by 3:30. So we left her house at like 3:20 and jetted back to my house real fast and made it back by about 3:32 so we made good time. Then i did yard work and cleaned the kitchen and the bathroom. after i was done with that i watched cellular which was ok i guess. I never really cleaned my room though lol. Later i went on the computer and played xbox and just hung out. I went to bed around 11:30. Then on monday woke up and went to school. School is getting really gay. I just want it to end and want it to be summer. But i cant move time so i guess im screwed. Biology with brittany josh and erik was fun. Lol me and erik made fun of mrs mueller the sub half the time so it was sweet. and i got to talk with josh and brittany too. After school was baseball which kinda sucked. I hate molestalots dad he sucks. And he ran our practice today cuz saugstead was at a funeral in michigan. Anyhow after that i came home and went to drum lessons. After that i came home and ate a ton! Ive been so hungry lately i think im going to hit a growth spirt or else somethings wrong with me and im going to get fat. After that i took out my dirt bike finally! I was so sick of just looking at it sit there. It took about 10 minutes to start it up cuz its a kick start and it hasnt been started since last summer. But yeah  i rode it around for a while and then it got dark so i put it away. I came in a played tony hawk 2? yeah idk whats up with the but ive been playing that game a whole lot lately. After that i came on the computer for a while and then watched the rest of the game. ILLINOIS LOST! that sucks balls i wanted them to win really bad. Plus I hate sean may. NC in general sucks. Well im getting yelled at to get off the computer and go to bed so thats all. Goodnight."

Then me and mike and jeff went over to a different mikes house to play poker, which didnt work out cuz there was a kid who didnt know how to play. So then we shot hoops for a while. Then i came home and went to bed around 11:30. Tuesday i went to school, which kinda sucked i guess but i got to see everyone i didnt see over spring break so that was good. Then i went home for a little while and then had baseball again til five. After that i came home and ate dinner and cake cuz it was my lil sisters birthday, she turned 3. Then i just hung out the rest of the night and did homework. Wednesday i had school, then i had baseball right afterwards. Then i came home and ate. I didnt have any homework so I called pong and he came over and we played xbox with my cousin franz (aka alfonso) and my brother for like 3 hours. Then we went outside and played basketball on my sisters little hoop. Until we broke the rim. Then we played four square (yeah idk what was up with that?) til like 11. Then i went to bed. Then thursday i went to school and after that i had baseball. Then my mom picked me up and we went to my granparents and i helped them with there new computer. Then we went out to eat at unos with my mom and dad, brother, and little sister. My older sister was gone somewhere. It was good, i had a steak and bbq wings and stuff like that.

"event","Yeah ok so lets see where did i leave off...staturday night? ok so sunday was interesting. It was easter which was good. I woke up about 8:30 and took a shower. Then left for church at about 9. Church was good, we have the guy at elmbrook who is such an amazing singer hes better than nebody ive ever heard! But yeah after the service i had to help my parents teach 2 and 3 yr olds for about an hour. That was cool i guess. After that i went to my aunt Chris's house on my mom's side of the family and ate lunch and watched the badger game. They lost which sucked but o well, good season. After that i went to my grandmas house on my dad's side. I got there and there was more food so i ate some more and then me and my brother and cousin went to the park and played basketball. That was fun. Then i went back to my grandmas house and played cards with some of my other cousins and then went on the computer. Then my mom left with my baby sister and older sister and i stayed and helped clean up. Then we were ready to leave and we figured out my sister had one set of keys and my mom had the other, so we had to wait for my mom to bring them back out to us in pewaukee. I got home around 9:30ish. Then i played xbox with my brother for probably 2 hours. After that i came on the internet and talked to people for a while. Then i was talking to my neighbor around 12:15 and we decided to sneak out and bomb cars with snow on pilgram. That didnt work as well as expected. First of all a lot of the snow was gone. But the main problem was that there wasnt a whole lotta places to hide. But it was cool newayz. After that i came home and snuck in about 1ish. It was real close cuz just after i took my shoes off and hung up the keys my mom and sister walked up from the basement. I was like phew i was a few seconds later or they were a few seconds earlier i woulda been toast. But it all worked out. Then i went to bed. Today was for the most part pretty boring and a waste of time. I went to baseball @ 9:30 and basically we listed to heinkel talk for about 45 minutes before we actually did anything. And then after that we just did real boring stuff. I got picked up at twelve and my dad was taking me home and this guy ran a red light and almost nailed us, we left skid marks on the road it was pretty sweet. But then we got gas and the suburban washed. Then i went home, came on the computer for a real short time, and then i had to go to the zoo with my whole family for my lil sisters birthday. That was really boring but o well. Then i got home around 4 and now im pissed cuz people are going to a movie at 6:15 and i have drum lessons i cant get out of at 6:30 so i cant go to the movie. O well, cant really do nething about it now. My drum instructer probably wont even be there. He always forgets lesson times and stuff like that. Ive also been pretty horny this whole weekend for no reason at all haha. Well i think thats it. Ill write more later if anything interesting happens...this might be my longest entry yet!"

Got up and played xbox. Pretty much the story of my life lately is xbox but yeah. Then i cleaned for a while. Then i ate dinner and zack picked me up and we went over to ashleys about 6:30. We just chilled over there, watched ace ventura, or part of it, then we watched the end of the illinois game. that got me pissed i wanted arizona to win so bad. But newayz then we went in ashleys hot tub for a while. We had like 8 people in it it was pretty tight. After that we went down in her basement and watched the rest of the bucks game and just chilled. Then my dad picked me and zack up around 10:15ish and we took zack home. Then i came home and now im here. But its about 11:30 and i should prolly go to bed cuz im dead tired and i have a long day tomorrow. Thats it for now."

"event","Yeah ok so interesting spring break so far...started out friday going over to zacks house and hanging with a buncha people. Then saturday went to the ring 2...that movie was horrible. Sunday went to church and then later that night went to small group. Then on monday had baseball and just sorda hung out. Tuesday had baseball again and then after baseball zack came over and we went over to brittanys house with kristina and of course brittany. That night was just fucked in general i guess, it was so weird. After that i came home and then kristina broke up with me which was a bummer, but then again i guess i felt kinda the same way she did so yeah. But then again not really but o well i decided to get over it and move on so w/e. Wednesday was sweet. Had baseball and then came home for a bit. Then went to church. After that i headed over to jakes house with zack and we chilled doing shit that us three normally do. we watched happy gilmore and then played mario party and after that filmed some crazy dumbcrap shit. haha mayo and jerry springer...tightest shit ever! But yeah then we watched euro trip and went to bed about 5AM. Then me and zack had to get up at like 9:30 and take showers. Then my mom picked me and zack up and we went to pick up my glasses. i only need to wear them in the classroom but i can wear them if i want to whenever...but yeah thats not gonnna happen. after that my mom dropped me and zack off at baseball. Zacks dad picked us up early @ 2 and we went back to zacks house to shower. Then we went to the Wisconsin Club where we met a whole  buncha other people like my dad and idk other people somehow connected to mr horne or the w.c. Then we took a coach bus down to chicago to watch the UWM game. it was pretty sweet, even though they lost. After that we watched the arizona vs oklahoma game which was down to the wire. but arizona won by one in the end. by then i dont even know what time it was but we had to take the bus back to milwaukee and by the time i got back to my house it was already 1:45AM. So yeah here i am @ 2:11 typing this out and talking to brittany. Well i think thats all for now lets see if i can actually keep up with this thing...yeah right."

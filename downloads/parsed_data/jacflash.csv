Some things still need work.

(Still can&#39;t quite see my abs. I am redoubling my efforts.)

Onward."

"event","Here&#39;s what I learned -- really learned, on a gut level -- this year: If you want to do something big, showing up is<i> usually the most important part.</i><br /><br />Get/buy/steal/assemble a program, a plan, for whatever you want to do. Then <i>show up</i>. Do the work. Even when you don&#39;t feel like it. Even when you&#39;re too tired/out of it/distracted to perform at your peak. Show up and do what you can do that day. It&#39;s okay to just do the minimum sometimes. But do it. Show up.<br /><br />Show up, and you will eventually succeed.<br /><br />Whether you have an okay plan or a good plan or an excellent plan doesn&#39;t really matter all that much. But have a realistic plan, a sustainable plan, because the plan that you will show up for is one that will succeed. (And there&#39;s nothing wrong with refining your plan after you&#39;ve been showing up for awhile and have a feel for what might work better.)<br /><br />Any time I need a reminder of this, I will put my hand on my bicep -- which grew from nothing to something over the last year, for the first time in my life, because I showed up at the gym and did the work 2-5 times a week.<br /><br />My 2012 is probably going to be about applying this lesson to a whole bunch of other projects. I need to make some plans, asap.<br /><br />What was your big lesson this year?"

"event","This is a bottle of 100-proof Stolichnaya. Note that the label is blue, rather than the red of &quot;regular&quot; 80-proof Stoli.<br /><br />I&nbsp;need a bottle or two of this for some cocktail geekery. Although it appears to be generally available, and it's offered by a variety of online stores that won't ship to MA because our legislators are dorks, none of my local liquor stores (including the huge cocktail-geek store in&nbsp;Westborough that usually has everything) carry it, and the guys in Westborough say they can't get it via their usual channels.<br /><br />This is weird because I thought everybody carried it -- until I&nbsp;actually needed some.<br /><br />Do me a favor and keep an eye out for it?&nbsp;If you find some, I'll be delighted to concoct a suitable reward for you.<br /><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.mugspartystore.com/Images/Liquor/Products/Stoli100.png"" alt="""" />"

Apparently there's a <a href=""http://www.cartoonbrew.com/cgi/looney-tunes-exclusive-clip-coyote-falls.html"">new TV show</a> in the works for Cartoon Network. Might be worth a peek."

"event","Ok, after the hospital visit which turned up no heart issues, I went back to doc.  Got Advair, turns out the chest xray showed COPD, early stages. 
So, go BACK after another week of painfilled sleepless nights.
Doc gave me Prevacid and scheduled me for a HIDA scan, they inject dye, and track it thru the gall bladder and all the bile ducts.  On a very happy note, the back pain has been manageable and liveable since the prevacid.  At times it's nonexistent.  I start getting sore again about 10 hours before the next pill (one a day).  I do have a call in, to ask if I can take 2 a day cuz they don't keep me pain free for 24 hours.
The pain that I get, though, is NOTHING compared to what it was.  So, if doc says no, to twice a day, I'm ok with it.
So, I'll letcha know what happens tomorrow."

"event","Went to my clinic Monday.  Told the doc there that I hadn't ben given ANY test results, just told that my heart and gall bladder were fine, given a scrip for Darvocet and Famotodine (expensive Pepcid), and sent home.
She had a fit.  It's a good thing I asked about test results too, because they found COPD on my chest xrays.  We discussed family, and my, med history and came to the conclusion that it is emphysema.  I've never had any asthma issues, my bronchitis is not chronic (only flares up when I get a cold), and emphysema is what killed my dad.  She, the doc, told me that this is why when I get a cold the cough will hang on for weeks and will be as severe as it is.  
So, now I'm on Advair.  Still waking up in the morning with the chest/back pain that sent me to the hospital in the first place.  But I know that it's not heart related.  I think my gall bladder is messed up, there's one more test that they're gonna do if I keep having pain, but they don't do it as a standard test because it involves injecting a dye into the hollow organs.  But, I think it's the only thing that's gonna show what's going on.  I've also had some other symptoms that I won't go into here.  
Got a call in to my doc... We'll see what she has to say today."

Came back negative.  Just one helluva a pulled muscle I guess.  I have NO problem admitting that the chest pain Friday morning scared the fuck out of me AND hubby.  Finally got home last nite about 9 pm.  
I'm going for follow up tomorrow.  Don't know what we're gonna do now.  I'll keep you posted."

****************************************************************

Women over 50 don't have babies because they would put them down and forget where they left them.

One of life's mysteries is how a 2 pound box of candy can make a woman gain 5 lbs.

My mind not only wanders, it sometime leaves completely.

The best way to forget all your troubles is to wear tight shoes.

The nice part about living in a small town is that when you don't know what you're doing, someone else does.

The older you get, the tougher it is to lose weight because by then, your body and your fat are really good friends.

Just when I was getting used to yesterday, along came today.

Sometimes I think I understand everything, then I regain consciousness.

I gave up jogging for my health when my thighs kept rubbing together and setting my pantyhose on fire.

Amazing! You hang something in your closet for awhile and it shrinks two sizes!

Skinny people irritate me! Especially when they say things like, ""You know,sometimes I just forget to eat."" 
Now I've forgotten my address, my mother's maiden name, and my keys. 
But I've never forgotten to eat. You have to be a special kind of stupid to forget to eat.

A friend of mine confused her valium with her birth control pills. She had 14 kids, but she doesn't really care.

The trouble with some women is that they get all excited about nothing and then they marry him.

I read this article that said the typical symptoms of stress are: 
eating too much, impulse buying, and driving too fast. Are they kidding? That is my idea of a perfect day.

I know what Victoria's Secret is. The secret is that nobody older than 30 can fit into their stuff.

"event","Or at least I've tried.  One of my neighbors was jumping around and spinning around swinging his 14 day old baby around in Penneys and he tripped over a stool.  Sprained his knee in the fall.  Baby was unhurt.  Anyway....
He wore a full brace (you know, the soft cast type) for TWO days, never limped and NEVER used the crutches, around here.  Then he starts bragging to my hubby about how he's ""gonna get a buncha money off Penney's and buy two acres of land, trade homes and live easy for awhile"".  THAT was just more than I could stand.
I called Penneys, ended up talking to their insurance carrier about how he's the most active ""wounded"" person I've ever seen.
They WERE gonna just settle, now they're gonna send an investigator out.  Seems this s.o.b. was going to sue for lost wages, loss of affection, pain and suffering and the fear that his child suffered.  I told the claims adjuster, ""You have to have a job to have lost wages, don't you?""  LOL  This fucker quit work 7 months ago, been living at home on welfare, not lifting a finger to do anything but put the beer can to his mouth.  
Re. loss of affection-- His wife told me he's been impotent for about 5 months now, at least he's not having sex with her.  Don't you have to actually have HAD a sex life in order to lose it?  
Re. the child's fear-- He was 14 days old.....  How scared could he get?  
Re. pain and suffering-- Now I'm not an attorney...  Can you collect for 5 minutes pain?  
For two days he used the soft cast, for 2 days he used another, smaller brace....  Today he jogged....  Exactly how much pain could he be in????  
The adjuster said he'll keep my name, and the name of another neighbor who's called out of the situation as completely as possible.  To do this he's having a local adjuster come out to investigate/watch, and question neighbors.  Then they're going to sit down with him and his attorney and let him know WHAT they've been told but not by whom.  Things should get very interesting.  LOL
Insurance fraud costs all of us a fortune and I won't sit idly by and watch it happen if I can stop it."

    The mayor of the French resort La Grand-Mottehas has instituted a new law against smelly tourists.
    The law allows police officers to stop people leaving the beach in swimwear for an odor check. Anyone found to be too smelly will be ordered to cover up or get a fine, the Web site Ananova reports.
    Mayor Henri Dunoyer says tourists stinking of sweat and suntan lotion put him off his food and wine as they pass the terrace of his favorite restaurant.
    Dunoyer says Britons are among the worst offenders, although it's been reported that the French use less soap than anyone in Europe, Ananova reports.
    ""I sit on the terrace of one of my favorite restaurants trying to enjoy good food and wine, and then a smelly tourist comes in and ruins everything,"" he says.
    As a ""goodwill gesture"" the mayor has arranged for special T-shirts to be handed out, but some local hoteliers are horrified by the whole thing, fearing it will frighten off paying guests.


(Ok.  Now, my hubby went to French Commando school in France.  He says the FRENCH are smellier than ANY tourists they have!  LOL  Maybe it's the smell of CLEAN bodies that is alien to his nose, and it scares him.)"

Thu Jun 27,12:40 PM ET 
By James Vicini 

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bitterly divided U.S. Supreme Court  ruled on Thursday that poor students can use public money to attend religious schools, a victory for President Bush  and other tuition voucher advocates. 
  
On the last day of its term, the high court ruled by a 5-4 vote that a private school voucher program in Cleveland that pays up to $2,250 per year to qualified students does not violate constitutional church-state separation. 

In one of the most important church-state cases in decades on an issue that could reshape American education, the high court's opinion by Chief Justice William Rehnquist said the program passed constitutional muster because it was ""neutral"" and did not advance religion. 

The dissenters, the court's four most liberal members, denounced the decision as a dramatic departure from past rulings and warned public funds will pay for religious indoctrination of thousands of elementary school children. 

They said the ruling created the risk of religious-based strife harmful to the nation's social fabric and removed another brick from the wall of separation between church and state. 

The decision added to a string of rulings by the court's conservative majority in recent years that have lowered the wall of separation between church and state by allowing some state involvement with religious schools. 

In the term that begins in October, the justices may confront another important school church-state case -- a ruling on Wednesday by a U.S. appeals court in California that the ""Pledge of Allegiance"" was unconstitutional because of the phrase one nation ""under God."" 

RULING BOOSTS SCHOOL VOUCHER MOVEMENT 

The voucher ruling, with sweeping national consequences for education policy, cleared the way for other cities and states to adopt similar programs. There now are publicly funded school voucher programs only in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Florida. 

Voucher opponents blasted the ruling. 

""The Supreme Court has taken a wrecking ball to the wall of separation between church and state,"" the Rev. Barry Lynn of the group Americans United for Separation of Church and State said. He called it the worst decision in 50 years. 

Rehnquist said the Ohio program was adopted for the valid secular purpose of providing educational assistance to poor children in a failing public school system. 

""It provides benefits directly to a wide spectrum of individuals, defined only by financial need and residence in a particular school district,"" he said. 

""It permits such individuals to exercise genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious. The program is therefore a program of true private choice,"" Rehnquist said in the 21-page ruling. 

He said Cleveland school children have a range of options. 

""They may remain in public school as before, remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose a religious school, obtain a scholarship and choose a nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school or enroll in a magnet school,"" he said. 

Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's only black member, wrote a separate concurring opinion, saying, ""Today, many of our inner-city schools deny emancipation to urban minority children."" 

He praised publicly funded private school choice programs as a way to raise the quality of education for underprivileged urban children. 

Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer dissented. 

""Whenever we remove a brick from the wall that was designed to separate religion and government, we increase the risk of religious strife and weaken the foundation of our democracy,"" Stevens said. 

Souter agreed in a dissent that he read from the bench. 

""Public tax money will pay ... for teaching the covenant with Israel and Mosaic law in Jewish schools, the primacy of the Apostle Peter and the Papacy in Catholic schools, the truth of reformed Christianity in Protestant schools and the revelation to the Prophet in Muslim schools,"" he said. 

Breyer said the majority effectively ""turns the clock back"" to a view the high court rejected more than half a century ago. 

""In a society composed of many different religious creeds, I fear that this present departure ... risks creating a form of religiously based conflict potentially harmful to the nation's social fabric,"" he said."

"event","Tell the Senate to STOP Bush's Anti-Choice Judges 
A raft of anti-choice judges who lack respect for women's rights may 
be confirmed by the Senate unless you act TODAY.  Please contact your 
Senators and tell them to STOP the confirmation of anti-woman, anti-
choice judges.

President Bush has nominated over 100 conservatives to the federal 
judiciary - 57 of whom have already been confirmed by the Senate.  
These judges have demonstrated records of hostility to women's 
equality and reproductive freedom and are poised to further roll back 
a woman's right to choose. These actions are a concerted effort to 
control the judicial branch of the government.

Please contact your Senators TODAY and tell them to reject anti-
choice, anti-woman judicial nominees.  Click here 
http://www.naralaction.org/index.asp?step=2&item=1659to send an 
email to your Senators. **Please forward this email to your pro-
choice friends and ask them to take action on this critical issue.**

Here are just a few of Bush's egregious judicial nominees who may 
come up for a Senate vote this summer. Click here for more 
information, http://www.naral.org/mediaresources/fact_sheet.html#10

D. Brooks Smith:  Nominated to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. 
For many years, Smith belonged to a club that refuses to admit women, 
a violation of judicial ethics. In 1988 he promised the Judiciary 
Committee that he would resign from this club.  Yet he failed to 
resign until ten years later, when the chance to move to the higher 
court opened up.  

Lavenski Smith:  Nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, 
Lavenski Smith is extremely anti-choice.  He represented the ""Unborn 
Child Amendment Committee"" in its unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent 
abortions from being performed at a state hospital in Arkansas, even 
when the state was not paying for the abortion.  

John Rogers:  Nominated to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, Rogers 
has advocated overturning Roe v. Wade.  As a Justice Department 
lawyer in the Reagan administration, Rogers wrote a brief urging the 
Supreme Court to overturn Roe as ""arbitrary"" and ""inherently 
unworkable."" 

Dennis Shedd:  Nominated to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, 
Shedd was a top aide to Senator Strom Thurmond, a potent anti-choice 
leader in the U.S. Senate, for many years.  As a district court 
judge, Shedd has demonstrated great hostility to civil rights and a 
lack of respect for the right to privacy.  

Priscilla Owen:  Nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, 
Owen is a far right fringe justice on the already conservative 
Supreme Court of Texas. As a justice, she has repeatedly tried to 
deny young women access to abortion and has even suggested that young 
women be required to receive religious counseling before obtaining an 
abortion. In trying to deny young women access to abortion, Owen has 
so blatantly ignored the law that even President Bush's own White 
House counsel thinks Owen's view is an ""unconscionable act of 
judicial activism."" 

Your Senators must hear that you care about the constitutional right 
to privacy and to choice, and that you are watching their votes on 
Bush's right-wing judicial nominations.  In addition to sending an 
e-mail at http://www.naralaction.org/index.asp?step=2&item=1659, 
please call your Senators and tell them that you oppose these five 
judges - especially Owen - as well as Bush's other anti-choice, anti-
woman nominees.  

Call the Senate switchboard at 202-224-3121 and ask for your 
Senator's office.  Also, please call Senate Majority Leader Tom 
Daschle at 202-224-2321 and ask him not to make deals on judges that 
will threaten a woman's right to choose.  And if you can, write a 
personal letter and send it in the mail to both of your Senators at 
United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20850.

Well, she is the child of ""fundies""... They make sure she's on the church bus EVERY time it comes thru, she goes to two or three different churches, simply because her parents want her out.  Wellll... The girl comes over yesterday and tells Marti, ""My momma got me a pool.  But noone else can play in it.""  This kid is old enough to know better.  I told her, ""Remember all the times you've eaten dinner here, spent the night because there was noone else in your house and you were afraid to be alone, ridden to the library with us because your mom didn't want to take you.  When your mother is ready to say Thank you, come back.  Until then, like I told you the other day when you wanted to play in OUR pool ALONE, do not come back over here.""
I'm not asking much, as a matter of fact, until the last few days I didn't even ask a ""Thank you"" from the fat bitch.  But then her kid hurts my kids feelings....  That is just beyond forgiveable and Now, I'm PISSED.  As much time as the kid spends in church you'd think she'd learn SOMETHING about being christian.
I saw the mother later and told her that she didn't have ANY trouble with ""sharing"" when I was the one giving to HER kid.  And that until SHE learned the value of GIVE as well as take, I didn't want her, her kids, or anyone or anything from their household coming to my home.  (The anything was because every fucking time we turn around the Lab puppy they have is running away from them and coming to my yard to shit.  Heehee... I took care of that though.  Positively EVIL plan came to me, heehee)
Why do people do things that they KNOW are stupid?  THEN whine and expect sympathy?  If you're sick, you don't do things that will irritate your illness.  Unless, of course, you're a weak willed IDIOT.  If you know you have to drive, DON'T drink, if you do, don't complain when you get busted.  Rent/Mortgage payments, insurance, utilities, groceries, ALL expenses that occur on a regular basis, NOT unexpected expenses, if you piss your money away, don't poor mouth, because you deserve no sympathy.  You were stupid."

THAT was a joke!  She could have gotten the SAME system from Dell for about 300 less, or my brother could have put the system together for her for about $500 less.  But NNNOOOOOO.  Anyhooo... she gets the machine today, and they don't know where to START.  So, guess who gets begged to help.

Him: Guess I'll have to get a phone line.
Me:  You can get a cable modem for 40 a month from our cable    
company.
Him:  That's an awful lot of money.
Me:   Look at it this way...  Fone is $27 a month just to have it in the house.  THEN you have $22 a month for an internet service.....  How is that cheaper than $40?
Him:  I don't know.
Me:   You don't have a fone cuz you ran up a $300 bill, right?
Him:  Yeah
Me:   Well, you think the fone company's gonna give you a fone without getting paid that outstanding bill?
Him:  Ok, so what do I need to tell the cable company when I call?

LOL  Some people just can't see the forest for the trees."

"event","To the lake again today.  They had a ball.  Hubby plays in the water with them, and is slowly convincing Marti that she CAN swim.  We all had a good time, it was nice, not too crowded until we were getting ready to leave.  We got there just as the beach opened so it was empty, just us and about 8 other people.
I'm suffering now.  Been trying to catch a cold all week.  got up with a sore throat today, hubby tried to cancel the lake trip, but I just didn't have the heart to disappoint the girls.  NOW, I wish I'd just sent them all and stayed home.  I have a seriously sore throat.  
Marti likes the floats and will go as far as we'll let her in the lake.  Charlie, on the other hand, likes the floats, but doesn't want to get her face wet, so she stays in ankle to hip deep water and plays in the sand.  
Got home and found that the retard dachsund had pissed in the kitchen, not once but 7 times.  LOL  I don't know where he gets it, but that is the one pissingest dog I've ever seen.  So, I had to mop the kitchen as soon as I walked in.  He was hiding behind the couch.  We didn't punish him, we were gone 6 hours and he's used to going out every 2-3 hours, AND he didn't piss on the carpet, just the tile floor.  But, he's my baby boy and, big doofus that he is, I love him, he's a part of the family.

Oh, yeah!  What does everyone think about the sudden death of Darryl Kile?  Apparently he died in his sleep, natural causes, 33 yrs old.  Five yr old twins and 10 month old and a wife.  Such a shame."

"event","The girls conned me into setting up the tent in the back yard.  THAT was an adventure in itself....   Well, they wanted to sleep in it (OF COURSE).  So, Night before last we slept in the tent.  Both dogs and the cat just HAD to be there too.
Well, the cat got kicked out because she kept pouncing on anything that moved in the sleeping bags.  
THEN, the dogs decide they want to go inside, at 4:30 a.m.!
I tried to calm them down and make them go back to sleep but they weren't having it.  So, put them in the house.  Went back to the tent to TRY to get some sleep.  Well, 6:30, out come the dogs, bouncing into the tent, hubby let them out when he got up.
I finally gave up.  I was so sore, felt like I'd been beat up.  LOL  Needless to say, I took the tent down within an hour of the girls coming inside for breakfast.  
Went to be early early early last night.  LOL  I bet I didn't sleep 2 hours all night outside.

Fri Jun 7,12:20 PM ET 

NORWALK (Reuters) - Kennedy family relative Michael Skakel was convicted on Friday of the 1975 murder of his next door neighbor, laying to rest a quarter-century-old mystery of who bludgeoned Martha Moxley to death on the lawn of her family's home. 

Skakel, 41, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, is facing a life sentence in the murder of Moxley on Oct. 30, 1975, in the affluent Connecticut town of Greenwich. 

A solemn jury delivered the verdict without looking at Skakel shortly after beginning their fourth day of deliberations following a four-week trial. 

A loud cry went up from one of Moxley's friends as the verdict was read. Moxley's brother, John, and her mother, Dorthy, hugged when the verdict was read. 

Skakel appeared to bend a knee and pray next to the defense table a few minutes before the jury's decision. After the verdict, his hands shook as he moved to his chair and his attorney Mickey Sherman offered him words of consolation. 

Moxley was found on the lawn of her parents' home beaten to death with a golf club that investigators matched to a set owned by Skakel's mother. 

Authorities said she had been killed the night before. 

The evidence against Skakel was largely circumstantial. At the start of the investigation, authorities focused on Thomas Skakel, Michael's older brother and the last person to admit to seeing Moxley alive. 

But the investigation stalled for two decades until authorities found discrepancies between Michael Skakel's original statements to police and those he made to private investigators hired by his father in 1992 to clear his name. 

In 1975, Skakel told police that he and two of his brothers went out in the family car, returned home after 11 p.m. and went straight to bed. After state investigators brought in forensic expert Dr. Henry Lee to reconstruct the case in 1991, Skakel modified his alibi. 

He said he had not been able to fall asleep, became sexually aroused and climbed the pine tree under which the body was later found and masturbated before returning home. 

Skakel said he did not originally tell anyone about the masturbation for fear they might think he was the killer. 

Lee never found any incriminating DNA at the scene. 

But prosecutors said Skakel had made confessions and incriminating statements, some of them to classmates at the Elan School for troubled adolescents in Maine, which specializes in treating alcohol and drug abuse. 

Prosecutor Jonathan Benedict said Elan classmate Gregory Coleman portrayed Skakel as a ""spoiled brat who boasted of the killing and said he could get away with anything."" 

Coleman told the grand jury Skakel had confessed to the crime in 1978, but he later said he had been high on heroin when he testified. Coleman died last year of a drug overdose."

What's a Military Family Worth? 
  by Rush Limbaugh 
  March 11, 2002 
  
I think the vast differences in compensation between the victims of the 
September 11th casualty, and those who die serving the country in uniform, 
are profound. No one is really talking about it either because you just 
don't criticize anything having to do with September 11th. Well, I just 
can't let the numbers pass by because it says something really disturbing 
about the entitlement mentality of this country. If you lost a family member in the September 11th attack, you're going to 
get an average of $1,185,000. The range is a minimum guarantee of $250,000,all the way up to $4.7 million. If you are a surviving family member of an American soldier killed in action, 
the first check you get is a $6,000 direct death benefit, half of which is taxable. 
Next, you get $1,750 for burial costs. If you are the surviving spouse, you get 
$833 a month until you remarry. And there's a payment of $211 per month for 
each child under 18. When the child hits 18, those payments come to a screeching halt. Keep in mind that some of the people that are getting an average of $1.185 
million up to $4.7 million are complaining that it's not enough. We also learned over the weekend that some of the victims from the Oklahoma 
City bombing have started an organization asking for the same deal that the 
September 11th families are getting. In addition to that, some of the 
families of those bombed in the embassies are now asking for compensation as 
well. You see where this is going, don't you? Folks, this is part and parcel of over fifty years of entitlement politics 
in this country. It's just really sad. ""Patriotism is not a short and frenzied outburst of emotion but the tranquil 
and steady dedication of a lifetime."" --Adlai E. Stevenson, Jr. Every time when a pay raise comes up for the military they usually receive 
next to nothing of a raise. Now the green machine is in combat in the MiddleEast while their families have to survive on food stamps and live in low 
rent housing. However our own U.S. Congress just voted themselves a raise, 
and many of you don't know that they only have to be in Congress one-time to 
receive a pension that is more than $15,000 per month and most are now equal 
to be millionaires plus. They also do not receive Social Security on 
retirement because they didn't have to pay into the system. If some of the military people stay in for 20 years and get out as an E-7 
you may receive a pension of $1,000 per month, and the very people who 
placed you in harms way receive a pension of $15,000 per month. I would like 
to see our elected officials pick up a weapon and join ranks before they 
start cutting out benefits and lowering pay for our sons and daughters who 
are now fighting. 
Rush Limbaugh 
March 11, 2002

(I'd also like to add that for every dollar that the US military receives in a raise they lose at least the equivalent and usually $3 in benefits.  They got a raise and LOST free dental coverage for dependents, and gained the privilege of paying for the insurance.  I could go on for hours about this.)"

    A girl in northern India claims she can detect the presence of snakes by their smell, reports the newspaper Navyug.
    The 4-year-old has astonished people by pulling cobras and pythons out of holes near the Shiva temple in Ranchi and then the snakes wrap themselves around Dipti Agarwal's neck.
    The snakes are my best friends and want me to play with them and I know they are around from their smell, the girl says. 
    ""It's simply amazing how snakes are attracted towards her and she to them -- there appears to be a divine bond,"" says priest Jatashankar Maharaj.
    The girl's businessman father says he is worried for her future and dreads the possibility of her being bitten by a poisonous snake, Navyug reports.
    ""She has been attracted towards snakes since she was 1, but the amazing thing is that she has not been bitten even once -- each time she picks up a cobra I feel I am going to have a heart attack and I keep praying that it will not bite her,"" her father says. 
    The father adds that he wished his daughter would forget about snakes and show some interest in playing with children her own age, but she doesn't have a single friend because other children are scared of her.

god i have to pee every fucking 45 minutes from these vitamins, i swear... its soo annoying.

we had practice tonight... it was another really unproductive practice, and that new song is just getting worse instead of better... its really dissapointing... i just feel like we're stuck right now... its not good... its really bugging me. I don't know what it is. Maybe we just need a break. Probably... I don't know... We're all tired of playing our songs, but we can't right anything new, at the moment at least. We should probably just get rid of this new song n start on something else, its not going anywhere. its sounding like its not gonna be as good as we first visioned it... Well, we're not practicing this weekend cause im gonna be at Jena's... n then we've got a show next friday. on the 7th. hoping itll be good for us. we'll see...

I guess Jena's gonna come over on thursday and spend the night, then we'll go back to her house on Friday, and then to her Mom's... so thats cool. im happy that i get to see her sooner. so i wont be happy til Thursday i bet. better than friday though, right? thought so... yep. our 2 months is on Friday. i dont think we're gonna do anything special though. thats okay though. eh, we'll see, maybe ill figure something out, but i cant cause we'll be at her mom's house, so i cant do anything. well, maybe i can do something... ha... shes gonna read this toooo, mmhmm. haha k ill shut up...

gah, i really dont want to goto school tomorrow. i need sleep, but i wont be able t oget it since i have to wake up at fucking 6:30. i dont want to, dammit. It's Garrett's birthday tomorrow too. I might so to his basket ball game. I dunno, my mom brought it up tonight and asked me if i wanted to go. I don't, but i probably will cause its his birthday. Maybe i will, even though i wouldnt see him if i went... we'll see...

i feel liek shit, i want to sleep, i wish i could. goodbye..."

"event","hi. I'm really tired... Jena was over this weekend. She came over on Friday pretty late in hte afternoon... like around 4 or something... We hung around for a while, watched some TV, then we went to Irvington to see Garrett's basketball game. They fucking whooped Irvington's ass, it was great... haha... then after the game, Jena, Ryan, Adam and I went to Wendy's n got some food, n went home and ate. My mom put on this movie with Jennifer Aniston, and it was fucking terrible. She had a terrible Southern accent. The movie was so boring and cracked out. But it showed her topless, that was cool. haha, best part of the movie ;)... hmm... Sorry, im just a boy, deal with it.

Saturdayyy... Jena and I just hung around for a while, and had a short practice... N then we all went to Bob's Giants Burgers... n had lunch. Went home, everyone packed up and left, then Jena and I hung around... Watched this movie with Christina Ricci called Pumpkin... It was okay, kind of a low-budget independent film... It was pretty good until this one scene towards the end, it just killed it, i swear. it was hella cheezy... like where the hell did that come from? kinda ruined it for me... ha, oh well... Later on we had to goto my Grandparent's house for dessert... n we came home n watched TV and hung out in my room til pretty late and went to bed...

Today, we went to the movies with my whole family and girlfriends, hehe... n we went n saw Old School. Oh man, it was sooo funny, i highly recommend it if you wanna laugh. I liked it a lot... Thennn... we came home and hung around with each other, enjoying every minute until Jena had to go home, which was too early for me ;) hehe... I had to take her home around 5... ehh... wasnt too thrilled about that. but oh well, i guess people have things to do in the real world. Which, i sure as hell dont live in... I sit around on my ass not really doing shit, just waiting to hang out with Jena all the time, n play in my band. But hey, that sounds good to me. Im happy not being in school, and not having a real job... 

We need to pick it up a bit with the band. Things are getting less exciting, and we never practice. We need some new music and more shows... I love playing shows, but we play the same frickin places, or i should say place all the time. The lack of venues sucks ass. Luckily, we're going out to Tracy for our next show, so thats good, change of scenery. We've played out there once before, but this a different venue... The kids in Tracy loved us, so hopefully they'll go n check it out again... But that'll be fun, its a bit of a drive. So thatll be fun. I hate having to drive in the truck instead of the van with the rest of my band n stuff... Feel so discluded, it's not anyones fault or anything, I just have to go in the truck with my drums n shit. So, whatever. Oh well, I get to have my Jena in the truck, so that makes me happy. Jena's been to every one of my shows since we've been going out, n I'm so glad. I love having her there with me at the shows... She's my stress reliever. Shows are stressful... Trying to get everyone there on time, and being there on time, setting up and taking down the gear, just everything, its all stressful. But when your playing, everythings just great. You get to rock out your hardest, n take out all your aggression... And nothing else in the world seems to matter except to express yourself through the music your playing... Such a good release. But anyway, i got off topic. She's really good to have around, she keeps me happy, and gives me massages cause im always sore, or tense. n i dunno, i just love to see her watching, its such a comfort and inspiration to have her there... Ah, okay. well i better go call Jena. Seeya guys."

"event","Boy do i have a lot to tell... Haha. yikes. You ready for this? ;) I don't know if i am... hehe... it actually probably wont be tooo detailed... eh. k.

Well on Thursday I was just getting all my stuff together for Valentine's day n stuff... went out n bought Jena roses n some other stuff i needed to put the final touches on some stuff. Eh, had a bad night, but oh well... Life goes on, right?... yup... Went to sleep late...

(this is the moment that i live for)
Woke up early on Friday morning to get ready to go see my baby. Got up, took a shower, put on nice clothes to try n look all pretty for Jena... I thought it was cute at least... hehe... headed over to her house with flowers and her presents in hand. I'm not gonna go into detail to about what Jena did for me, but let me just say that it was the sweetest thing anyone has EVER done for me. It was beautiful. Thank you Jena, it was so wonderful. We were there for a couple of hours. And then we walked over to McDonalds and had lunch, the Big Mac tasted funny. hehe. then we took the bus out to Morgan Hill so we could goto Jena's mom's house. She picked us up from the bus stop. n we headed over to the house, n i met her Step Dad n stuff. This was my first time meeting both her mom and Step Dad... It was cool, they're both really nice. So much better than her scary ass Dad. I wasn't even scared, so that counts for a lot! Haha... yeah they were really nice... we hung around the house for a while and ran out to get some stuff for her brother who forgot to get stuff for his girlfriend. what a weenie! hehe... then we went out to dinner with her mom and step dad, n then to her grandparent's new house, where I met like the rest of her family. aye yi yi. haha... so yeah, i met like her whoooollleee family all in one day. Crazyness :) thats okay though. I didnt sleep much at all that night... it sucked. i hate not sleeping, motha fucka. hehe.

Woke up on Saturday at like 5... layed in bed for like 3 hours, n then we left to go back to Jena's Dad's house, where we chilled a bit before my Mom picked us up. And then we headed home and were quite bored... Just one of those days, ya know, where its all gloomy outside n everything just seems to suck bad. well it did... we didnt do anything for a while. Angela came over, n we hung out, wee! hehe... n we went out to carl's jr n got dinner, packed up n got ready to goto the show... don't wanna go into detail about that night, it sucked... but we watched fightclub after the show, well i watched it while jena and angela both fell asleep. everyone always falls asleep, and im the only one awake, and it gets lonely... haha. i hate it! Jena was actually kind of awake, so i spent some time laying with her while the movie was on n stuff, i think she was half asleep though. n Angela hella sleep talked to us, and it was really funny. ""the tape is too big"".... haha... what the hell was she talking about? who knows. CRACK HEAD! :) hehe... just kidding, i went to bed at about 3.

woke up Sunday morning, and it was like 9:00... n Jena came up n hopped in bed with me, weeeee. i was so happy. hehe. i missed her. n then we got up... angela woke up, n we got ready to go, and left to head up to Santa Cruz at like 12:30. we hung out at Angela's for a bit, n went out to get some food, n came back n hung around more and more. and then we went out that night to the beach, n walked around, n watched the sunset n stuff... it was all beautiful n junk... it was damn cold. n we left n went home n hung around, we watched the ladies man, while Jena slept, as usual. hehe. After the movie angela and i went to bed. Jena hogged the pillow, so i slept on my Finch jacket next to her and she was kinda pushin me off the bed. hehe. that dweeb! :) ... hehe, i didnt sleep well at all.. i slept liek 3 or 4 hours off and on. we got up, n walked over to the donut shop n guess what we got?... DONUTS! wooo! hehe... thats right kids, we got donuts at a donut shop, how clever. okay... then we went home, n fuckin shit, Jena took forever and a day to get ready, then we finally went out to subway n had lunch, n went to the boardwalk n stuff. went n walked around on the beach some more. watched out over on the water... went home n hung around, and then we left... headed out to Taco Bell on the way home, n then Angela dropped us off at Jena's dad's house... we spent the night there.

So.... this was yesterday, Tuesday... we went back to my house and hung around for a while, til liek 4, n then Jena had to go home. Sadly, i was having a good time being alone with her n just laying around n sleepin n stuff with her... It sucked... I started on my homework, then i got a call, n we were gonna have band practice, so i stopped and set up my drums, then had practice. we worked on a new new song. yay... we jsut came up with it on the spot. we have like a 40 second intro so far! haha... its really cool though. It'll be a good song when its done. Then watched Smallville. wooo, god i love that show, its so fucking good. weee, cant wait til next weeks episode, its gonna be really good. did more homework, and went to bed abit after midnight...

woke up this morning at 6:40 and it was sooo hard to open my eyes.. yikes, i had school, n got back a bit ago. yipee!...

So, i had a great great time this weekend. Lots of fun with Jena and Angela. Thanks for letting Jena and me stay over n stuff with you Angela. we had a really good time. im tired, and i want to stop typing now. more late,r bye suckas."

Ms. Jena came over last Thursday... yay yay... i was so happy, i couldnt even tell you what we did, it seems like it was so far away. i just realized the other day that my memory really is pretty bad... oh welllll....

Friday, we went to the bagel place for lunch, and it was good....  we went and saw Shanghai Knights with Justin and Tiffany, it was pretty good.... 

Saturday, we just hund around during the day, we went to guitar center so i could pick up my cymbal, oh thank god, i was so happy to get it back... wee!! :) its beautiful, all shiney. hell yeah... then came time for us to head down to the show... I always feel so rushed to goto the shows, well i kinda was to leave for this one, i took too long to get into the show before it, so eh. thats why... but we got there, unloaded... n then we went over to mcdonalds n got some dinner, then headed back over to the teen center... we ate and watched the first band. Who Manda seemed to not like when she saw them at the Gaslighter... I know they werent great. But they were good for being liek... 14? or younger... I was impressed. Their drummer was pretty good. N then 4 Bux played, they were, eh, better last time we saw them, oh well... Then it was time for us to go on... and we played. It was our 1 year anniversary of Printed Blanks... We played our first show there a year ago. It was our first tiem back there since then to. So that was pretty cool. definitely a huge improvement since our first show there, haha... It was fun, i thought we sounded good. We havent played very much lately, so i thought we might not do so well, but we did good. i was happy with it... Gah, on the last song, my left floor tom and left China fucking fell off the 3 foot stage... oh christ.. i was soooo pissed. If you didnt know, my drums are hellla nice and expensive, so i was fucking pissed... i played so hard after that, not even caring what i was doing, probably broke a cymbal from playing so hard n crazy.... surprised if i didnt. gah, oh well... we had a good performence. so i was happy. We sold like 13 CD's, so thats good... We have a steady rate of like an average of selling 8 CD's per show, which is totally awesome, cause we usually only play in Fremont for the most part, and we sell a steady about of CD's here every show. That's awesome, more and more fans. Hehe, we had to sign some autographs for some people... it was cool... usually only little kids ask us to sign their CD's n stuff... no one really cares. actually, we signed quite a few at our CD release show, so nevermind... heh, its always weird though... its like, hm we're not anyone special, but thanks a bunch! Things are going good. So, yay for that, and everyone who supports us...

Sunday... was a typical sunday, we didnt do anything, i dont think... just sat around.. i thinkkk? ha.. did we do anything jena? i dont know... ehh...

today, we also just sat aroudn n didnt do anything... but thats okay... i took her home a bit after 8...

Yeah, i dont know what else to say, i dont really have anything else to talk about, so ill stop. gotta do homework tomorrow, yipee."

(technically monday) was a rough day... but i survived. heh... jena and i got into an argument. well... not so much of an argument... but... some emotions were stirred, and nothing good resolved of it. so whatever you wanna call that. heh... i dont know, it sucked bad... and i got super depressed, like more than i would ever have liked to... back to how i felt months ago... ya know- yeah- that bad. and stuffff... but we cleared it up... and i guess things are okayyy... i hope so at least. im sure everything will be fine.

so i had another night of hardly any sleep... i was up til liek 4:30 coughing... i finally fell asleep around then... i dont know exactly when... god its terrrrrrrrrible. i hate not sleeping... i love to sleep- and wish i could again.. hopefully when my cold goes away ill be sleepin my ass in once again. i doubt it though. even before my cold ive been waking up at like 8 or 9. which fucking sucks. cause i dont sleep till like at least 1 AM every night... usually way later than that... but anyway... i woke up this morning at like 10. which is the latest ive slept in in a couple months. i was so surprised to wake up and see 10 whatever it was on the alarm clock. heh... anyway, jena called and woke me up, and we talked for a bit. its always a good way to start off the day. always gives me a happy and positive outlook on the day...

Tonight i watched John Q... That movie with Denzel Washington, where his Son's heart is starting to fail, and they're poor, so he holds people hostage in the hospital in order for his son to get a heart transplant and stuff... It was a really sad movie. Had some tears hear and there. heh... it was sad, i swear. I liked it a lot, it was a great movie. I think its exactly what i needed after my emotionally hard day. one of those movies that touches you and makes you all thankful for what you have n shit, n want to give your love one a huge hug and kiss and tell them exactly how much you love them. ya know?... So, I called Jena after it was over, but i got her voice mail. hehe... im sure she fell asleep while waiting for my call... She's s such a sleepy head, soo cute. Oh well, sleep is good, im glad she sleeps better than i do... 

I really need to get over this cold, its killing me, I can't take much more of it... I just want to feel good, and sleeeeep, and stop coughing up all this flem, its so gross. and blah. I miss feeling nice and healthy... Oh well... im going to go... and do... nothing while im not sleeping. this sucks... haha... k..."

"event","Blech, I'm sick... it sucks. hehe. It's all Jena's fault ;) hehe... no its my fault for kissing her, but yeah... Hers went away, n then i got sick... but i think it came back to her today when she woke up. Sorry jenaaaa! Yikes.. it sucks though, i hateee being sick... As if i couldnt sleep well enough while im feeling good, nowwww im sick. So, im sure this isnt helping any. actually, last night i slept pretty well, but i had to wake up at 6 to get ready for school. which sucked, i just wanted to fall back asleep. but its not like i can just miss school whenever i want... I only go once a week.. and can only like miss 3 days of school a year or something. So, i have to make sure im really dying in order to stay home... hehe.. oh well... it wasnt too bad i guess. I had to take a test though, i havent taken a test in like 3 months or something crazy like that... haha oh welllll...

anyway... Jena came overrr on... Monday... Monday morning around 9 in the morning. yay. that made me happy. We were both craving this day all weekend. So it was quite enjoyable. hehe. we just hung around all day... Jena made sugar cookies, with a little help from me... They're delicious, yummmm. N we went for a walk to the park, n it was freeezing... hehe... so we went home pretty quick... n hmmm, we watched Now & Then.... and then of course Jena was so tired, n went to sleep ;) hehe... 

Tuesday was our one month anniversary... hehe. sounds so... not long at all... well its not, but oh well. its a start. right?.. we've practically been togther for like 4 months all together anyway... so whatever suckas. hehe... anyway... we went to the movies and saw A Guy Thing... which i thought was quite dissapointing... I was expecting so much more... But... i suppose it was okay. Eh, oh well... we went home, n just hung around all day... didnt do much... She left at 8... i wasnt ready for her to go- as usual, i know. hehe... that sucked... Oh well, ill see her on Friday... Thats probably a good thing, we need to get over our sicknesses, although they most likely wont be gone by Friday. gr. i wish... oh well...

I think tonight im going to Garrett's basketball game. I haven't seen him play this season, so hopefully ill be feeling good enough to go... Anddd... we're playing a show on Friday at the YMCA in San Jose. Playing with some bands we never have, or hardly have played with. So its going to be cool. I think they're all pretty damn pop-punk. That's okay.. I guess thats what we are too when it comes down to it. Well, some of the stuff. Whatever ;) ... Our new stuff is better. But im looking forward to the show. itll be cool... K, im gonna gooo.. seeeya."

"event","whats uppp....Oh really now? ... great... heh... I don't feel like updating, more like i ""need"" to... so its not gonna be that good, sorry... 

Lets see whats happend since the last update....

Jena came over on Thursdayyyy, Brandon was over to hangin out for a while... I don't remember what we did on Thursday, oh well... Jena slept over.

Friday came... we were lazy for a while... quite a while, we didnt shower til about 2, or a bit after. thats okay, i had a good time... Dave, Blacker, and Adam were over hanging out... we went n got some taco bell... n hmmm... later on Angela n Jen came over n picked Jena and I up and we went out to pizza with them, Jack, Robert, Ryan, and Adam... there were a whole lotta people at the pizza place, it was crazy. It was Lauren's birthday party, so there were tons of people i knew. Which was cool, hadnt seen some of them for a while... N there were some people there who saw the video tape of me getting my cartiledge pierced... and they recognized me... it was quite odd, thats for sure. haha, oh well... We went home, n then Jena had to leave. N that put a damper on the night. I wasn't ready for her to go home... not at all... its like... a day and a half feels like nothing to us now... well me at least. im so used to spending like 3 days at a time with her... so anything less feels so short. I know, it's odd, oh well... Then we went back over to Dave's coffee shop... They were closed, and we were just waiting for Dave to get out. It was really boring, so we al lwent our seperate ways... n i came home n talked to Jena for the rest of the night i believe...

Saturday... I did some yard work to earn some money... which i sure as hell need. So that was definitely good... I sat around after that all day just talking to Jena n stuff... I was supposed to goto the Normal Like You show, but Brian who was gonna take me bailed on me, as usual. When does he not? Christ... So i was pretty dissapointed... But Ryan decided that he would take me isntead... so that cheered me up. Sooo, we rushed to the show, not knowing exactly where it was... We just knew the general area. we got pretty lost. but somehow managed to find it, and get there on time! they were just setting up as we got there... n I ran into my old homie Alex Holt, so I was like woo! that was cool. didn't really know what to say to him, but it was good to see him. He used to be my MxPx/Dr. Pepper homie. We had some good times. We had matching MxPx sweatshirts, except he had gotten his after I did, and it was slightly different... Heh.. Sorry, memories... :) .... Okay... Normal Like You played... the sound there was sooo shitty. Oh my god it sounded terrible. n they only played 5 songs, so we were like what a rip off... we got their new CD which came out that night, n we left... that was basically my night... 

Today... I had lessons early... had to make up for Thursday... n then I talked to Jena for a few hours, n did homework for the rest of hte day. it sucked... im finally done with my homework. Doing a weeks worth of homework in one day is not fun. Jena, when you start- do a little everyday, itll be easier. Trust me, just start like that, n it'll become a habbit...

Jena is coming over bright and early tomorrow morning. Thank god, I think I would burst if I didnt get to see her tomorrow. Well, even that early for that matter. Yikes... I miss her a whole bunch... we're so pathetic... hehe... oh well... :) ... shes spending the night... n then Tuesday our 1 month is FINALLY here.... it seems liek its been forever... We're both happy its here... So im gonna take her out on Tuesday. yipee. okayy... so dont expect me to be on til late tuesday night :)... heh... okay, im outta here..."

Saturday-
We had practice around 2... Brandon n mitch were there before kickin it... n then we played the set n the new song a few more times... n... it was pretty late after that, so i took a shower, n got ready for the show at Iceoplex... Wow, the show was amazing. There were SOOO many kids there... holy shit. The line was helllla long to get in... like inside around everywhere, and then outside.. i was like WTF! haha... that never happens. it was great. i was so happy to see that many people there... I thought we played really well... Couple little things were ehh. but i thought it was really cool. and one of our best performences in a while. we busted out the new song... didnt hear tooo much feedback on it from people, well not in detail. everyone said they liekd it, so thats cool. its a bit different. but so is every new song we make... everythings just different all the time... n i think thats cool that we can be able to do that... but anyway... Then Jena and I hung around... she ice skated with my little cousin n it was soooooooooo cuteee... i was just watching n being all awww... hehe... n we went home n watched TV, we were both sooooo sore n tired... went to bed.

Sunday-
We were lazy, sat around n did homework, n a whole lotta nothin... We watched Signs ... and we got scared :) hehe. hm n then we were just up late watchin TV n talkin... Sundays never seem to be very exciting

Monday-
We went to Guitar Center around like 2:30... n i brought in one of my crashes cause it was cracked, my warenty was still good on it, so i got to send it back in to get it fixed, well they end up just sending you a new one... so im without one of my crashes... and it really sucks cause we have 3 shows while i wont be having the crash. i dont know what to do yet. fuck. GR... hehe.. anyway... we went to Jena's house after. Keep in mind that I have never stepped foot inside her house and I am terrified of her Dad... haha... luckily, no one was home when we got there... n we walked over to Carl's Jr, we were so hungry- we hadn't eaten all day. So we got there ordered our food, started eating n we werent very hungry anymore... haha, it sucked. oh well ;) we sat n talked for a bit, n then we walked home n chilled for a bit. Jena's Dad came home... YIKES!.... ha... he wasnt too bad at all. thank god. he seemed pretty okay. i was like ... wow. so that was such a relief. we just hung out in her room n watched TV all night, n had a great time. We didnt goto bed til nearly 4... n we got up at like 9 too... hm. i think we were both up before that, so we were pretty damn tired. 

Tuesday(today)-
Watched TV for a while... n then we went to the Mall for a while, n around there til pretty late... n went back to Jena's for a little while, hooked up her old computer cause hers is broken, i couldnt fix it, i was like dammit... hehe... oh well... blah, i had to leave her around... 8. it sucked. I hateee leaving her. Its no fun :( ... heh... especially after being with her for 5 straight days, you get sooo used to being with her, and i totally dont want to be without her. I just wanna spend every day with her n things would be greatttt. heh... oh well

so, lets gather feelings together... and they equalllllll... Content. I am very content and happy with the way things are going... It's nice to have something(someone)(jena) other than just my band as a positive thing in my life. So now that i have 2 such great things, its just like wooo. awesome. I enjoy it. although the band feels kinda like we're slackin off... n i think we need to pick up the pace a little bit more. oh well, everyone gets into these slumps. but we've got quite a few shows coming up, so itll be quite alright... 

School tomorrow bright and early, not lookin forward to it. i better go... its almost 12:30. night."

Played that double - bubble game for a bit, hehe, god its fun... n then we went in... n watched the movie... eh, it was a total chick flick, i thought it was cute, but Jena didn't really like it. hehe... oh well... hehe.. so it was over, n we headed back out on our walking fun... It actually didn't take that long to get back... it was realllly cold though... we stopped at Subway, n split a sandwhich... thanks jena :) hehe... it was gooood. yum yum... Then we walked back to the Gaslighter... n wow... there was no one at the door. Home Grown was playing She's Anti, i was like weee. so we just walked in n sat n watched the rest of their set, Ryan said we only missed a couple songs, so i was like score! They did pretty good, not as good as last time, but definitely better than any other (besides the last time) ... yeah... it was cool... I had the greatest time with Jena... I just really extemely enjoyed every second of being with her... just cherrished every moment... 

I get to see her tomorrow at The Used and TBS ... eh,well probably wont see much of her, but she'll be there... ehhh. thats all ill say about that...

oh well... ill see her lots this weekend. like Friday - Tuesday. ha.... hopefully at least. I really hope so. that'll be nice. im going to goto her house on monday - tuesday i believe.... Scary... itll be the first time meeting her Dad... im really scared of her Dad. He's really intimidating... and I really dont think its just my imagination either. Oh well, hopefully he'll be nice, n i wont really have to be as scared of him anymore...

okay, well i just wanted to write about my lovely night... i have school bright and early.... yipee...

oh yeah, i saw a million trillion people i knew tonight. including Ms. Manda... I don't think she likes me. Ehhh... k... well im off too bed- cause i really dont wanna be awake anymore... yup.. night..."

Jena came over this weekend. I'll start from Friday.
Ryan, Adam and I headed out to San Jose... We were really early for the show... So I decided to go pick up Jena n bring her to the show, instead of having her meet us there. i was happy to see her, i wasnt having the best day, so it put a smile on my face... n then we headed over to the Static Lullaby show. it was just at some auto body garage place, quite strange... a couple bands played before them... eh, the first one was okay, the second one wasnt very good- at all. n then ASL came on. It was... okay. Not as good as i hoped. They bugged me, they took like 5 minutes inbetween each song... and ended up only playing like 5 songs... it was hella ghetto. Jena seemed to really like it. I don't quite understand why she thought it was thattt good- it wasnt. hehe... she'll kick my ass for that. oh well... Then we left, n took Adam home, n went over to Dave's work, he usually gets out around the time we were over there. But we found him and jack next door to Dave's work... It was Jack's birthday that day, so we hung out there for a bit. And then we decided to goto Denny's n have some good... We were there for like an hour... n then Ryan, Jena and I went home... Layed around in bed for a while, looked at Jena's adorable baby pictures... n then we went down n watched TV til like 3 somethin, n went to bed. 

Saturdayyyy... I had practice at 1... we worked on the new song a bunch, n played the set, n then changed the set... i guess the new set works better, so thats good. I just wanted to change things around a bit to be different. But oh well. This one is still different though, so its all good... After practice, it was like 5:30... n ... Brandon, Kel-E, Jena and I went to McDonalds... got some food. Well- they all got food. I can not eat Fast Food except for once on Friday's. Jena has me on some crazy diet... Which is insane cause i am so god damn skinny.... haha... well her defense is ""it's not a diet, it's just to make you stop eating fast food."" maybe i need it to keep me weighing enough. ha or something. oh wellll :) its good that im cutting down, its a waste of money, but i have no food to eat here, so it sucks. oh well. anyway. then Brandon dropped Jena and me off at home... n then we ate dinner there. hung out for a bit... n then we watched Goldmember. Welllll, i watched it while jena slept next to me... hehe. oh welll. That movie sucked balls. Oh my god, wtf happend? christ- it was terrrrrible. there were only like 4 good parts in it. which consisted of Mini-me and Fat Bastard, the rest of it was terrrrrible. God i was dissapointed... eh. The movie ended aroudn midnight. Jena stayed asleep, n i just went on the computer for a while... went to bed at like 1:30...

Today was just layed back, hung around with Jena all day... wow, we really didnt do much, did we? ... hehe... oh wellll... had to take her home at 8. God i hate having her to go home. it sucks so bad... the way home from taking her home is so depressing... its sadddd... i just want to cry... hehe... ehhh, i got back n had to start doing homework, finished up my English, so thats good. now i just have 10 hours of Math!!! wooo looking forward to that... i have to do 11 chapters, fuck its a lot. dammit. damn school...

oh well, overall- i had a great weekend. Weekends are more enjoyable now that I get to spend them with Jena. hehe... I guess for the past few weeks shes been spending the night every weekend, huh? pretty crazy... Good shit... I love it... can never get enough of her though, thats for sure... Jena isssss.... AWESOME!!! WEEE :) hehe.

Ooo, Marcella co-hosted Sound Check tonight, it was hella cool :) she played Wasting Time, woo good shit. Okay. I'm done. Seeeya."

"event","dammit, Brian bailed on me for the Static Lullaby show tomorrow... fuck... i wanted to see ASL and Jena is gonna be there... But, hopefully Ryan will take me instead. I think Jena is coming home with me, if i get to go... I sure hope so. I want her to spend the night. I've been lucky to see her as often as I have since she lives in San Jose n all... It makes me happy. Being around her puts me in such a good mood... Jena is such an amazing person. Shes so incredibly sweet. I love feeling loved. It's what I need, and thats what I get when shes around, and yay... its great. 

Yesterday I had school, woohoo.. ha... ha ... n uh, went n got some lunch n went home for a bit. then Dave, Ryan and I headed out to go pick up Jena from her school... We got her (yay yay yay), n then we headed over to guitar center so I could get a new snare head (blech it sounds like shit, i need to wear it in more still)... n yeah... got it... then we went home... Hung out all day n had a great time. She looked sooooooo incredibly beautiful. :) hehe... It was fun... Blacker took her home at around 10... So glad i was able to see her yesterday... 

I really want to see her tomorrow, i better be able to go. Or else ill be sad n angry :( blech... 

We had practice on Tuesday, worked on the new song more. we're still putting all the lyrics together n stuff, i was hoping to finish it at that practice, but we didnt. at all... So Saturday we'll have to work hard on it. Get it finished so we can play it at the show on the 18th... I really wanna play it then. The song is awesome, i love it. Can't wait to hear whatcha guys think about it... 

I'm really looking forward to the show on the 18th... We haven't played a show in a month... And itll be the first show in the upstairs room at iceoplex, instead of on the Ice... itll be a good time. n Jena will be there, n im really happy about that. Itll be the first show with her there as my girlfriend. wooo. hehe. can't wait.

eh, k... im done."

"event","aww... sooo... Jena ended up coming over yesterday... Saturday... its technically Monday now... so eh.. yeah Saturday she came over, n i was sooo happy, you read how sad i was on Friday cause i wasnt able to see her... So she spent the night, n we had a great time. I did at least. hehe... Everything was just soo wonderful, i loved every minute of it. She left tonight a bit after 8... n it was sad. i wish she didnt have to go. but theres something called reality... i know... she (as well as everyone) has to go back to school tomorrow. so that sucks. means seeings her less... probably wont see her until tuesday the ... 12th i believe, at the Home grown show... then the next night at the used and tbs show, n then that weekend of the 18th. gah, seems so far away. kinda is. knowing us, we'll probably find a way to see each other this coming weekend though... hehe... we're pathetic, cant go more than a day n a half without each other it seems. hehe... ehhh... oh well, everythings great with us. im really happy with our relationship n how everything is going with it... shes a great girl.

we also had practice on saturday... worked on the new song... its getting there... i dont know if we'll be playing it at shows though... eh. we need to save some for the CD and not play them at the shows. but at the same time, we need new stuff to play at the shows. maybe we'll bust out this one, and then save some other ones. our newest one was like 2 months ago already, or more even. so i think we need something new to play live. okay... im gonna go talk to jena... nightt..."

"event","Wowww.... weee. hello. Miss me? of course you did... time to catch up.

Sundayyy... we recorded the demo version of Struck Down... and ehhh... we're gonna re-do the vocals when Mitch gets back from Arizona, i have no idea when that'll be. hopefully soon. today Chris decided that he probably wants me to re-record the drums. god, i dont want to set up my shit in there again, it was a pain in the ass to move evrything n shit... grrrrrr! but anyway... it was fun recording, really tiringgg. and yeah, that was my Sunday... Jena got a tattoo that day. wooo, kick ass. 

Monday- I went to Tracy with Ryan and Dave. we got there around 5 in the afternoon. It was Sean's birthday. So we just went n chillied with him and his girlfriend... I got another piercing in my ear lobe. And Dave got one in his ear lobe and one in his eye brow... We left around 12:45 or something. I dont remember exactly. So we left and it was hellllllllllla pouring and hellla windy on the way home.. it was crazy. When we finally got back to Fremont, we had to pull over one time cause the rain was coming down so hard n fast, we couldnt see a damn thing. but then i got home n talked to Jena on the phone for a while, n went to bed.

Tuesday- Jena was supposed to come over around 10 or something, so i got up at 9 to get ready... n she ended up not coming til around like 2 or something... hehe. that sucked ;) oh wellll. She got there n i got super happy :) hehe... it was awesome. That was New Years Eve... wasnt it? i believe so. yup yup... hehe... i dont remember exactly what we did all day. ohh just hung out for a while. n then people started showing up later that night, n we all kicked it, had a nice talk with Jena... n surprisingly Angela showed up with Jen... It's been a while since ive seen Angela, so that was a nice surprise to see her... it wasnt a very exciting New Years, but oh well. i enjoyed spending it with Jena and my friends.Jena and i stayed up late watching TV... n then finally went to bed at like... nearly 4... 

Wednesday- i was woken up a bit after 8 by the god damn sun. grr... haha... i was sooo tired... i sat around n watched TV for a while... n then went n hopped in bed with Jena, and layed around for a while. Later on we had lunch n made the Which Printed Blanks Member Are You quiz... n ... yeah its fixed now guys. then we went out n got some taco bell... watched Hannibal n spent the rest of the night in front of the TV... it was a nice relaxing day. I had a good time.

Today... we just hung out... ordered a pizza... Brandon came over, n then Jena had to go at 4... that sucked... i really didnt want her to go... its hard on me when she leaves, cause i get so used to spending day n night with her for however many days... n then shes gone and i get so empty and feel incomplete... its just hard on me... for her too though... But the time we spend together sure as hell makes up for it... I always have the greatest time with her... She's so amazing... I love spending time with her, she makes me damn happy... after she left, i realized it was Thursday and I hadn't even talked to Derek about having lessons today... So i called him up, luckily he wasnt busy... So he came over n i taught him for a while. N then i came in... chilled, had dinner... n then worked on homework for quite a while... Took a break n went out with Garrett and Robert... drove around... got Justin after he got off of work, n went to mcdonals... came home... started back on my homework and have been talking to Jena. Too much homework tonight, blech, my brain is overloaded.. it hurts. i just wanna sleep. which is what im going to do now... soo goodnight people"

Christmas was okayyy. Not as good as i was hoping... pretty sad n lonely... I think i had a better time on Christmas Eve... It was cool though, i got a bunch of shirts n random things. the new Bon Jovi CD... cause Bon Jovi rocks my fucking balls. The CD is really good. i was happy about that... lonely day though. oh well...

Thursdayyyyyy Ms. Jena came over unannounced, and it was the best thing that could have happend that day. I was sad n lonely cause i thought she wasnt gonna be able to come... but then she called me, n then i asked her if i could call her back on my house phone, n then she came in, i was like EEEEEK... talk about long lasting big ass smiles, geeez. it was great... shes so sweet. Sean came over a bit after. Which was cool. hadnt seen him for like a month. Or more.... yeah a bit more i believe... when i got my lobe pierced. next time i go up im gonna get a couple more in my lobe. itll be cool. People keep saying i should get my right ear done, but i wanted one ear to sleep on ;) hehe. my left ear is so uncomfortable to sleep on, hurts to just lay on it. so eh. i dunno what to do. eh anyway... Thursday was a lot of fun. went out to visit Dave, he got out of work early for once. eh i dont wanna go into detail about everything. but i had a really good night. lotsa fun. 

Friday we went n helped Sean clean out his families storage locker thing... that took up the day, n we were tired, so we layed around n watched Shallow Hal, it wasnt as stupid as i thought it would be... it was entertaining. i have no clue what we did for the rest of the night... that was just last night though, huh? yikes... Jena n i were up til like 3:30, yikes. today we just hung around. Sean went home in the afternoon... Jena n I were being lazy... n took her home around 8. butttt i was finally not stupid today, n i finally asked Jena out. FINALLY, i know. N im really happy with it, i should have done this like 4 months ago, i know... but now we're finally together. and im really glad... Yay. 

Tomorrow we're recording the demo of Struck Down ... that should be fun. I'll let ya know when its up on mp3.com... okay, im tireddd."

I've seen it all a thousand times... haha.. oh well. and... then Derek came over, n I gave him lessons. Started to teach him Was There Some Hope... the Printed Blanks song. mmhmm. ;) n Jena went with Justin and Robert to see the worst movie in the world, Lord Of The Rings... blech...

Went n got some Wendy's... went to Iceoplex so Ryan could get some Homies... haha... n went to Dave's coffee shop... sat around for a while... lalala... then they finally got home. n kicked it some more... dont exactly remember what happend after that... i know we watched American Pie 2 at like 11... n then Joyce, Dave and Jasmine came over at like 11:30 or something... watched some of it with us, n then they left... Lesbians, hot lesbians. WEEE> LESBIANS! they were hot bitches.... haha. I'm touchin his ass im touchin his ass im touchin his ass. haha... good movie. okay. n yeah.. hm...

Saturday rolls around... sat around for a bit. n then Mitch and B-Diddy came over ... we all went n got some Burger King... and Mitch spit on my tray ... haha. yikes. haha. then we came home n worked on the new song a bit. this one is taking a long ass time to do. i think we've changed it quite a bit n stuff. but it'll turn out hella cool, hopefully. I like it a lot. n then we sat arond n kicked it more n more. Garrett was over. sat around watched more of the god damn Drive-Thru DVD... haha, godddd. they're killin it for me ;) Oh well, i can never get enough of the Rx Bandits w/ Nate from Finch. Its the fucking best thing ever. But okay. hmmm.. we hung around for a long time. Then we all went down to Iceoplex to watch our buddy John play. but he ended up having to go last, and they added another band... so he didnt end up going on til 11:45 or some shit... so we didnt stay... we waited too long and were all too tired to stay n watch. Sorry John.... but we went home n hung out more. Joyce n Dave n Robert were all over at my house with Justin n Tiffany, n Ryan n Angie. and yeah. then eventually they left. So, Jena, dave and I watched A Night At The Roxbury... n Jack came over... n then Dave n him left... hehe... n hm. yeah.... theres Saturday.

Well anyway... i woke up at 6, so extremely exhausted... i was tired up until a few minutes ago, the exhaustedness went away... dont get me wrong, im still tired, but it isnt half as bad... im just babbling on because i have nothing else to do at 7:05 in the morning. ya know? but thats okay... im actually kind of hungry for once in the morning, andd im actually up in time to have breakfast. maybe i will for once... Actually, ive been waking up around 8:30 the past week n few days... i just stay in bed hoping to fall asleep, rarely does it happen... I hate not being able to sleep well... it sucks... i love to sleep in...

So, last night was amazing... no i didnt have sex with Britney Spears, sadly... wow i wish I did though, that would have been cool eh?... heh, but no.. um. we had practice... buttt, heres the deal. We want to play Bandfest at Mission, but you have to have 50% of the band attend mission. we only have 1/4... so... we have to add 2 people for us to play. So I asked Alek and John to come play Violin and Viola for us... I believe they only have to play on one song. So we had them come over for practice... N had them play to Everscenes... and wow... they did an amazing job... it was beautiful... Try-outs are this Thursday... Alek told me he cant goto them. So i dont know what to do. Maybe they'll just let it slide without Alek... i hope so... But it was just amazing with the violin n viola... wow... we'll have to record a new version of Everscenes with them on it. it'd be great. Maybe an acoustic version with it? Eek, you'll just have to wait n find out. 

It's still only 7:15... and im getting tired again... i can feel my eyes getting heavy... gosh i just wanna go fall asleep on my bed... that'd be so nice. I want jena to come hang out with meee... n i want her to get better, she's sick. really sucks... I hope you feel better jenaaaaaaa."

Rawr... just sucks... I wish they'd pay...

Well, im not as tired as i was this morning, maybe it was from the help of the wonderful Rockstar, yum... it was good. hehe... gettin slowly more tired though... School was... boring, its school, thats all i really need to say eh?... I got the date of the Proficiency test finally... Its January 11th, its not too far off. so thatll be cool. 100 multiple choise questions in 2 and a half hours, and then an essay in a half hour... The only thing ill have a little trouble on is the Math, some of the stuff I haven't learned cause i never did any Algebra or anything. But im prefect in English and can write essays really well (my teacher says so, not me;))... hehe... I get A's on em, so thats good... N they only take me 20-25 minutes which is what the Practice thing says to do, n then 5 minutes to look over, so thats good. so good shit... IF i dont pass this test, theres another one on April 26th, a day after my birthday... woo. God I hate birthdays... but thats another story. So, im looking forward to the Proficiency test, get outta fuckin school. hell yeah...

The guy from Concerts First called us yesterday and gave us the time we're playing on Sunday. We get the slot that we chose, woo! We go on at 5:30. This is the best time slot of the day, so fuck yeah. We rock ;) haha... itll be a cool show. For those of you who don't know what the Great American Music Hall is like... its just like a mini version of The Fillmore... Its damn cool... big venue. So itll be a really cool show... really looking forward to it. What should i wear to the show?... Black dickies... eh but what shirt? ... Tough decision... Maybe my Senses Fail - I should've known that you were a killer shirt... that shirt is bad ass. Maybe ill wear that.. but i kinda wanna wear a black shirt with just white writing... Eh, I'll figure it out. Ha, we were talking about what we were gonna wear for Sunday- last night at practice. Lawson already has his whole outfit picked out. hehe, crazy kid. Mitch wants to wear his new fat kicks, haha :) good shit. 

Fuck, i was looking around online and i saw an OCDP snare for 300, i was like oh fuck me. Thats the lowest ive ever seen one for. thats really good... its not vented, but its still an OCDP, so fuck yeah- thats rad. i want it, but im not even gonna bother asking my parents since we're on a tight budget now, otherwise im sure id get it just like that. 

Speaking of OCDP, i need to put my frickin endorsement package together n send that shit in. i want my brother to record some drum tracks of me. cause ive already progressed a lot since we recorded our album in August. I've got recent video tapes of me playing, but CD stuff would be better. Maybe ill record some later on. I've got 2 refferences for OCDP (Cyrus (nfg) and Tom from TSL), ill be sure to write that on my letter to them. Wooo. If i dont get endorsed by OCDP (that'd suck ass) ill try some other companies, i have some others in mind. but we'll see. ive been working so hard to be on OCDP... hopefully itll happen.

I've got nothing to do today, dammit. what to do, what to do..."

"event","wanted to post some of the stuff i wrote in the past few days... 

i wrote this a few days ago..

*dark...red...*
deep inside your mind
lies all your twisted thoughts
of this fucked up world
and the way you live this life
is no better than me
dried up blood and scars
black mascara running with the tears
hide yourself in the fears
the light wont see this time
but i will be your savior tonight
the dark red pain has come and gone
this body has seen more than youll ever know
hide in my arms just one more time
we'll lie and die in this night
this feeling is all we know
but now its time to surely go
fade 
     away


then i wrote this one on saturday i think, i dont like it as much, but im going to post it...

*the game*
you make me want to shove glass in my veins
like i want to bleed out every ounce of blood because of you
but still i keep coming back for more, again and again
just push the knife in deeper and turn it now.
im drowning in this pain

im better off without you, and thats for sure
but im addicted to your every little move
its killing my quietly, without making a sound
Even if I told, you wouldn't even understand.

So, what's the point, get this over with.
Crush my heart, dig out my eyes.
You make me wish I was dead
But you know I'll be back for more.

I'm just a loser in your killing game.
The only rules are that you have to suffer
There's no way out, you cant quit.
Game over, I'm broken-hearted.

I lost.


n i just wrote this one tonight, i like it a lot... 

*lost*
here i am, 
ive been without you for too long
this skin has been untouched
just waiting for you

you always were my bestfriend
how could we have drifted so far apart
its time to reunite you and i
its been far too long

oh the memories of you and i
up all night long w/ no converstion
but it didnt mattered
you were always there

let them say we're crazy
they dont mean a thing 
we only need each other
and i need you now again

my friend has come back to me
cold, sharp and chrome...
i can see myself in your reflection
its not what i want to see

its time to leave this fucked up life
we'll go down together
just you and me my friend.


enjoy, night guys."

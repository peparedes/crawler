"event","The sweetest thing ever ( My friend is gonna take a deck of cards, and put them in a box, and give it to his gf, its gonna say 52 things I love about you, and each card is gonan have something differnt. Isnt that sweet?) Anyways! I wish I had a bf for valentines day, it seems like every year this holiday comes around, that im single, :o( oh well...

I have a 20 page report due tomorrow that I am definatly not gonna even attempt to finish tonight. And they wonder why we hate school sooo much?

Orlando was exciting! and this weekend im goin to Bush Gardens with my daddy and brother and other people. I love spending time with my dad becuase i never get to, I miss him soo much! I wish things were the way they used to be. If your parents are still together, then you are very lucky! I see my dad once every 2 weeks, and I feel like i barley know him. Its sad. Ok enough of that!! Im gettin upset!

School was gay as usual today, pep rally, sucked as usual. Too much cheerleading ass!! lol christine!! put that shit AWAY!

Then after they skated for awhile we went back to jasons and chilled there. Alica's b./f came over! She was VERY happy! lol I L U. She told me some exciting news today!!

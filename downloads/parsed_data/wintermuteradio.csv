"event","Hello, friends!
I know I've been neglectful, and I'm sorry.
I've had a large amount of computer trouble and a small amount of time for tending to said issues, let alone update.
At any rate, here I am now. (Such as I am.)
If it helps, I do come with gifts for you.

After a few months of not being able to upload any new music, in the past couple days I've added over 60 tracks including:
<BLOCKQUOTE>brand new stuff from And One, Assemblage23, Beastie Boys, Duran Duran, Icon of Coil, Killers, Morrissey, Real Life, and Seabound

classics from The Church, Concrete Blonde, Nick Cave, Depeche Mode, Fad Gadget, Shriekback, The Smiths, This Mortal Coil, Ultravox, and Yaz

also plenty of other great songs by artists from Peter Murphy to Dean Martin</BLOCKQUOTE>
I guess you could say I had some fun putting this together. I hope you will enjoy listening.

In other news, I am putting the finishing touches on the next Sampler CD. Drop me a line if you want a copy.
Cheers!

"event","As you may know, I changed the bit-rate to open things up for those who lack broadband.
With that, I have more space to play with, so I have been trying to make some major revisions to the music library.  
This, of course, is an on-going process, so be sure to check in regularly.
Fall is more or less upon us.  With that, I have a new CD compilation if anyone wants a copy.
You know the drill: just say the word and it's on the way...

"event","RESURRECTION

Saturday, 28 June 2003 (normal club times, you know)
The Steeple Lounge in Charlotte (1212 Pecan 704.333.5545)
<blockquote><a href=""http://www.bellsouthpwp.net/w/i/wisenhour/resurrection%203.jpg"" target=""_blank"">(flyer)</a></blockquote> 
There's an unexpected addition to this event...
I will be DJ'ing downstairs.  Many people know that I have an <a href=""http://dresdenblack.net/radio"" target=""_blank"">internet radio station</a>, but this whole ""doing-it-in-public"" thing is new to me.

There will be, of course, several great local Goth/Industrial DJ's and I'm honoured to be included.  

I hope you can all make it out, and while you're there, come visit me in the lounge downstairs.  

Cheers!
-<i>DJ</i> Dresden Black"

Just a little bit of Christmas music to get one in the mood, or something like that.
(Needless to say, with a Wintermute twist.)
If anyone has any special holiday requests, please let me know.

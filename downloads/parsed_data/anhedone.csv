"event","Welcome to my .. well .. journal.

My name (even though my usual title is Sakura) is Andedone because I thought it was an interesting word. It means to ""Feel not pleasure in events that are generally deemed pleasurable"". Now, I'm not depressed or anything like that, even though that word might be viewed as some underlying dis-satisfaction with my self or life.

Ok, the title does apply to me I suppose, but only because I feel differently about alot of things than most people. I don't REALLY enjoy most of the things that many people around me do, but hey, not everythings bad eh?

Ok. I'm going to have to finish this (my grand entrance) early due to .. well .. bed.

I'm off so, see you all later! 
Oh, and as a reminder of a webpage, I'll past it here.

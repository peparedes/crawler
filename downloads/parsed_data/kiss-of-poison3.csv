It really shouldn't be like this...someone should not be able to have such an effect on you with no real, significant reason.

I've been dying to tell you anything you wanna hear...

It confuses me how someone can be in your life for next to no time at all and still leave such an impact so that the two of you have that certain something that always ties you back to eachother. Not necessarily romantically, but in a way that you know noone else could ever be for you, and you can just tell that there is a definate reason for this person in your life. Even though you can go months without talking, the feelings are just as fresh as the day they were formed. How the memories of that individual two years ago still make your heart race and your mind become involved in one and only one thing, yet every tiny detail pops out as if it were yesterday.

You make me smile, please stay for awhile"

"event","Danny is such a little baby girl. Last night he called me at like 1 and Sarah claire leah and I were watchin tv so i wasnt really listening to him plus I'm kinda annoyed and pissed off at him cuz he keeps hitting on me and calling me late at night and saying I love you and totally leading me on but then he's interested in someone else and asks her to a movie. He's also REALLY hypocritical and is only happy if he can win no matter what. But as soon as he thinks I'm moving on or have other options he gets all pouty and PMS-y. So after like 5 minutes I told him I had to go and he was like ok bye and hung up really fast.  Then like 15 minutes later he sends a text saying ""sorry i called. didnt mean to intrude."" what the hell?!?!  All I know is that for MANY MANY reasons I really NEED someone else right now. I'm not even sure who I want that someone to be but for my health, sanity and overall well being I need him NOW..."

"event","So I'm now single again...sort of. Danny and I are ""taking a break"" which means that for like a month or two we are just gonna be single, but its guaranteed we'll get back together and we arent allowed to go out with other people (his rules). The weirdest part though is that i'm not that upset. Maybe its cuz i know we'll get back together or maybe its cuz he told me that he really doesnt wanna break up he just wants to slow down for a bit and that he still really loves me and wants to be with me. Or maybe it's cuz of that stupid problem I have where I wont let myself be truly upset. I let my self cry for 1 minute tops then i make myself get up and go work out and not think about it. It's so frustrating cuz sometimes i just want to break down and bawl but I JUST CANT. Becasue for some reason I just wont let my emotions come out all the way even just to myself. I feel like I need to be stronger, better, more perfect. And that's why I'm more pissed off than sad. Because he's getting in the way of perfection. Stupid as it sounds its the truth. For me perfect is happy, and this is far from it. But I'm gonna be just fine. I'm gonna go out and enjoy being single and not having to always call my boyfriend and I'm going to enjoy the people around me who I may have been giving less attention to than they deserve and I'm going to do my best to make this feel...perfect."

"event","I got a car!!! :) :) :)! It's a white '91 lincoln towncar. In other words, a huge-ass Grandma car, but hey, its a car, so I'm not complaining. It's in pretty good condition and it's got lots of room inside ;) It sat in some old guy's garage for 10 years, so it hasnt been used much and doesnt have a lot of miles on it. So no convertible for now. sigh. oh well.  Today I went to a baseball game with caitlin and Jarad. It was really fun and I decided I really like watching baseball and also I decided that I really miss playing softball. i might try out for the summer league next year. Anyways, our team was losing pretty badly but there were lots of hot guys there, so thats always nice. lol. So then after our asses were numb we got up and played hacky sack which was interesting considering Jarad's pretty much a pro and Caitlin and I SUCK. But it was fun. So then we walked to Jarad's house and I got to meet the entire fam. What fun. But they were pretty nice and then they all left leaving us with the house to ourselves. We hung out and talked for awhile till my mom showed up. then we left and came home. wow. what a pointless story. fun day tho."

"event","Hey guys!
Well, after learning some things about a certain ex of mine I decided it would be a good idea to make this a journal that only my friends can read. So if you wanna just post a comment with your username and tell me who you are, I'll add you as a friend! Thanks, love, Hannah"

"event","good news: i made $300 this weekend watching a 6 year old...man i love my job!!

bad news: summer II has started and i don't like it one bit!! i enjoyed my time off so much...traveling, playing, and just relaxing! now i go to school from 730- 930, work from 10-6, and then play tennis from 7- whenever! i'm so tired by the end of the day i don't want to do anything except lay around. i kinda feel bad b/c jerrad is always wanting to go out and i never feel like it! but he went to kansas for a week withou me!! i was so mad b/c i wanted to go so bad! i miss all of my kansas guys especially one special one! it was a much needed trip i needed/wanted to take b/c i want to see him so bad..not jerrad, the special one! plus it was sue's 21st birthday so everybody was going to be in town and were going to go out to the bars and party and i'm stuck here in summer school! i hate it! hopefully jerrad can convince them to come down towards the end of the summer and we'll all go to the lake house...i need to see my kansas people!! i'm thinking it's time to go back and see them...maybe this fall!!! i do have 2 weeks off from work b/c they're going out of town but i will be in school and having wedding every saturday so i don't think i'll make it up there before summer ends!
 
well i never thought i would say this but...i'm kinda ready to go back and see everybody. i'm excited about hanging out with alyson and lisa b/c they are oh so much fun..i'm thinking i won't be getting much done this semester..but hey as long as i have fun and pass it'll all be okay!  i'm really excited about not living on campus anymore and having to deal with the drama and people that i can't stand. i'm excited about football starting up and seeing what the team will look like...i'm thinking we're gonna do really good..as long as we KILL THE KATS(bearkats that is) i'll be okay!! i'm ready to make roadtrips on saturdays and come back late saturday nights to then go out and party. i'm ready to go and hang out with my favorite family....i really do miss them...so much i talk to them almost every night! 

anyways... i'm really just writing in here b/c i don't want to write this rough draft for my paper! i hate english...i mean seriously i'm not going to have to teach my 2nd graders how to right a critque over an essay or a paper arguing why or why not they should be invited to little susie's birthday party...so why should i have to do this?!! it's stupid! 

so today lynsie called me today with somewhat good news about her brother! it brought a smile to my face and i'm VERY excited for him if he follows through with it! my be travling out west more...which means i can go to lubbock and see the best friend too! i miss her so much...maybe i'll take a roadtrip out there before the summer is over! we haven't celebrated our 21st birthday together yet...that could be trouble but it would be OH SO MUCH FUN!!

okay well i'm going to go work on this paper and go to bed! i hope everybody is having a GREAT summer so far! for all you nac people i can't wait to see you and hang out...i'm ready to enjoy being 21 without mom and dad getting mad!!"

"event","so i got a message saying it was time to update my journal...and so i felt this was the perfect time to do it after such an amazing weekend!

actually...i'm going to update on florida too! as most of you know i went to florida about 2 weeks ago! i'm so in love with that place it's crazy. i really can't wait to move there and just enjoy the rest of my life. i've started looking at good places to teach and places to live. anywho...i went to florida for a week with the family...ALL 7 of us...my 4 sisters, Dad and Mom. we had a great time spending time on the beach and relaxing in at the house. i did learn one thing...i will NEVER ride a jet ski in the middle of the gulf of mexico again. yes i'm love with the beach and the ocean but being out there in the middle of the ocean with nothing around kind of scared me! the thought of sharks coming up and getting me had we fallen off just got the best of me...therefore i'm going to stick to just riding on the boats. especially since there were shark attacks this week around the same place we were. other that nothing too exciting went on. i did my usual things when i go to florida...beach, tennis, and sleeping.

so...finally the big birthday weekend!!

as most of you know i turned 21 this past weekend. i went to good ol' nac to celebrate and see friends. thursday night i went to the wallaces where they had birthday dinner and cake waiting for me! then went to devo on the deck for yellow house and that was fun. then anna, will, tessa, megan, john, and i went to flashbacks to watch the basketball game. now this was a real exciting time b/c when i ordered a drink i got to show my i.d. for the first time LEGALLY!! i sure did show it to the waitress with pride!! it was really exciting. the night was fun..even though the pistons lost. 

friday i got to see a lot of my friends that stayed there. i played tennis in the morning which was probably the worst idea ever! i've learned to NEVER EVER play tennis the night after going out and drinking. the two just don't mix...so of course i didn't last long AT ALL! i then had lunch with Alyson and her friend Lindsey...and we caught up on stuff so that was fun. after lunch i was still not filling so hot so i went to my favorite place..the Wallaces...and took a nap before taking Ande out to play tennis...still not a good idea! later that night we went back to flashbacks for more drinks! :-)

so saturday some of were suppose to go to the rangers/astros game in houston. well piece of advice..make sure you have tickets before going driving out there b/c you never know when the game will be sold out! in case you didn't catch on this happened to us. i was so upset and i have also learned that i just greatly dislike the houston area...probably won't ever go back! anyways...we decided to hang out down there since we were there anyways. well the guys got the best end of the deal and went to main event while the girls went to the mall. i was not happy at all b/c 1. i hate the mall and 2. i hate the mall on saturdays b/c parking is horrible and there's a bunch of kids running around getting in the way. luckily we weren't there for long and i got to eat at cheesecake factory.

so saturday night was the big night to go out. we ended up going to anex and meeting up with alyson. actually had a good time hanging out and dancing the night away! after that we ended up going to some ATO house out in the middle of no where. it was a lot of fun though...so much fun didn't get in until 5 in the morning. so after we left the party lisa and alyson were going to drop me off at anna's. well she wasn't there so we danced in the car and waited for her to get there. well these guys came over and started talking to us. they were pretty funny actually..and one of them looked like mario as in mario and luigi.

sunday i went to church and then spent the afternoon with the wallaces. the youth group at devo at the clardy's pool/ tennis court thing. well this guy ended up coming out there and he ended up being married to the lady over academics in the athletic department at SFA. you're probably wondering why this is important...WELL since she saw me play maybe she'll say something to the tennis coach and it'll help me get on the team! i really want to play next year...so much i'm playing on the time to get better. in a couple of weeks my life is going to be school 730-930, work 10-6, and then tennis 7-9/10. CRAZY i know but it's important to me.

well my weekend was amazing and i can't wait to get back in august to hang out with people...alyson get ready to go out and have fun (""I don't speak spanish..."") this next semester is going to be better than last semester b/c i'm not going to get involved with people that are going to bring me down and make me mad. i didn't enjoy last semester at all and don't want to go through the same things i did. it's going to be an awesome semester i can already tell!

well that's all the excitement that's gone on the past couple of weeks! i have a couple more weekends of traveling before summer 2 starts and i have weddings every weekend (which i'm not looking forward to). i hope everybody is having a fun summer!

until later:

"event","so tonight i went to what i think will be the best wedding of the summer! i don't say this b/c of the reception and dancing...although it was a plus...but because of everybody i got to see! it was a trip down memory lane seeing everybody from highschool. i know i say i don't miss people from highschool but tonight i realized that i actually do miss a couple of people! tonight the group i hung out with was all together tonight. we got to spend time together and it seemed like things had never changed except that one of us was married. we've all gone our seperate ways but it seems like everytime we get together somebody is getting married. we danced the night away and just had a great time! hopefully we'll all be together next year when another one of us gets married...oh so can't wait!!

well my summer is going great...going back to nac just doesn't appeal to me right now. i'm having fun spending time with my family. my uncle, aunt, and new baby cousin came in town and we had so much fun. hopefully they'll move back down here. tennis is going great. i'm having a blast and basically spend all my time up at the tennis center....met a couple of cute guys too. i've started drills too and i think it will help my game out. watch out SFA tennis team..KAT'S coming!! the family is going to florida next week...oh so excited! me and the older sister are going to go scuba diving. plus tammy, lindsay, hannah, and hazel are going to come see me for a day! i can't wait! the only reason i'm ready to go to nac is b/c scotty, tammy, hannah, and hazel are moving back to nac! plus we got a pulpit minister at northstreet! so things are going to be good back at church in nac....can't wait! 

well i'm gonna go bed. hope everybody has a great week! be good!

"event","so as most of you know i went to kansas this past weekend! well i had an AMAZING time!! the people i met and saw are freaking AMAZING!! i would love to move to kansas and be with them. i've realized that they don't change and that they don't care about anything that you do and just like to have a good time! 

okay so friday...lush luau date party. we had hot tubs and drinks! well since it was a date party i ""thought"" i was going to be jerrad's date. well being the best friend he is, jerrad had a surprise up his sleeve for me! i really wasn't going to be his date! i was A.C.'s date...totally surprised and excited! for those of you who don't know the story of me and A.C. ask and i'll tell you! well i'm not going to tell everything about the party b/c what happens in kansas stays in kansas but i will say.. oh so much fun!

so every year theta xi takes a trip called the booze cruise. they canoe down the kansas river and get drunk! i was so excited b/c i've never been in a canoe before so doing and then drinking on top of that...SO FUN...or so i thought! well we start on our trip and everything's going good..little wind in our faces and the sun's shining but not a whole lot! well just as you think things are going to get good it starts sprinkling and lightening! well half the guys are in metal canoes and need to get off the water! we top on this island in the middle of the kansas river while it is raining and lightening and nobody has their cell phone! really great..i know. we wait out the storm and let it pass before we set off on our trip. after the rain the sun starts shining again and things get better except the fact that it seems like the river is never going to end! we made it to the end..half of us drunk, half of us sober, half of us dry, and half of us soaked! the only thing i could think about was gettting a shower after we finished our trip. now that it's over with i laugh at it and i really did have fun..good bonding time with the guys....saw more that i really wanted to in some cases! 

overall this weekend was great! i'd do it all over again and hopefully i'll see the guys again soon..i already miss them. tomorrow it's back to good ol' nac to take finals and leave for the summer. i can't wait. i need to get away for awhile and recollect my thoughts and feelings on things. this semester sucked for the most part..minus the roadtrips and margarita nights...i don't want to remember anything from this semester. i'm ready to put everything bad that happened behind me and start over. things started looking brighter towards the end so hopefully that will carry over into the fall! i'm really excited about trips and sweetheart stuff going on then! 

well goodluck on finals everybody hope you did good!!

"event","first let me say..Alyson i hope this is good enough for your reading enjoyment. it may not be as funny as the ones from football season but maybe it'll bring a smile to your face! and i'm so glad you're still doing sweethearts..we need to hang out!! 

so today has just been absolutely horrible!! first we had to do this stupid binder for reading 320. well she didn't even take the thing up...she just had a friend check of a list for us. everything we did in that class was pointless. so after that i go to art to do my art presentation. courtney and i had no clue what we were doing. we sure did just wing it! so i've learned 2 things today...1) education classes for the most part are stupid and pointless and 2)never wait until the night before to figure out what you're going to teach to a class. maybe the fact that i got limited amount of sleep last night has something to do with it too.

so i played horrible in tennis today! i seriously have to start working harder if i want to be on the team. this summer is going to be school, work, and tennis. i really want to make the team and if i don't then it might be okay since i didn't play the other 3 years i was here but it'd be something fun to do and a good experience!!

after tennis i went to the sweetheart meeting! i am so excited about next year! we have so many good girls who actually care about it this year. alyson and i talked about taking a trip to new orleans whenever the team plays McNeese! i'm all for it! too bad there won't be any buses going to the FAR away games this year...i might be crazy and hop on it again! well i'm happy for the girls who decided to do it b/c they'll have a lot of fun. we're planning lots of fun things for next years season so boys get excited! i'm also glad we found enough girls for all the seniors so that way girls that i didn't want doing it don't get to and that makes me VERY happy! they wouldn't get to do it anyways b/c i sure would be talking to mrs. joyce and saying ""nope they're not good for this!"" i love when i get to have a say in stuff!!

well hopefully tonight will get better! i'm suppose to go have drinks with candace and watch movies...i don't think it gets better than that....well actually it does but we won't talk about that! the only thing i really have looking foward to is going to kansas state this weekend! we're going to have so much fun up there with the guys...date party on friday and canoe trip on saturday! it's going to be a weekend of partying and probably doing a bunch of crazy stuff! but you know the saying...""what happens in kansas, stays in kansas!""

hope everybody has a great week!!

"event","so this weekend was absolutely amazing! i had more fun this weekend than all semester put together! i branched off from my group...met amazing people..and had an amazing weekend! 

for those of you who don't know i went to troy, alabama for a flag football tournament..crazy i know. we got there late friday and got up early saturday to play a full day of football. we didn't win the tournament but we had fun. i scored a touchdown..i have moves i never knew i did! so after playing football all day we hung out at the student center. a band...Boochie Shepherd (i love that name)...played and they were really good! so the real fun came at 11:00 p.m. when some smart person suggested we go to the beach! it was the best idea i had heard all day so of course i was on board! so we left around 11 to head to panama city beach which was 2 1/2 hours away! well we got there and hung out on the beach for 15 min. and then headed back. we got back around 5 in the morning. now all day yesterday i was asked several times if i would go back and spend the same amount of time...the response..OF COURSE! i absolutely love the beach and take advantage of every oppurtunity i have to go! well sunday morning we had worship on the 50 yard line in Troy University's Football stadium...the same stadium they beat the Missouri Tigers. it was awesome and i have pictures to go in my football scrapbook! oh another plus...i charmed my way into krispy kreme doughnuts! i never got to tell the guy that there were no words to tell him how i felt about him...he probably knows though!! 

today i was talking to a good friend and my mom. i have come to realize that i am tired of living in texas and i'm ready to move to florida. i decided that i'm going to wait until monica graduates from highschool and then make the big move. that's in 5 years!! i'm so excited and my mom is starting to accept the fact that i'm moving and understands that that's where i'm the happiest. i'm ready to start over. to meet new people, forget about all the crap going on here, and have fun and enjoy life to the fullest. i've made great friends here and i'll never forget them and they will always be a part of me and i will always be there for them but i'm ready to move on in life. i'm very excited about this and there is nothing that can change my mind. for now though i'm going to make the most of the time i have left in texas.

"event","so today i had a conversation with a friend...he told me that i've changed since the first time we met. i told him that i was tired of people taking advantage of me and who i am. i told him that i'm looking out for me and only me! that couldn't be anymore true at this moment in time! 

well i'm just really ready for summer to get here so i can get out of here! i'm tired of people not minding their own business or complaining about something i supposedly did. i mean does everything i do really effect you that much that you have to go cry and complain about it?! 

i'm tired of SFA and all the shit that comes with it. i haven't done anything to anybody. i stay in my room most of the day, play tennis and go to class. from now on that's all i'm gonna do. maybe by doing this i won't hurt anybody and nobody can say anything about me. nobody will have to worry about me. instead of ""kat said or did this..."" it will be ""thank goodness Kat's not around!"" 

i wish i could go back to before christmas break when i didn't have a care in the world...everything was just fine. nobody knew who i was and that was okay with me. i miss my carefree days when it was class during the week and partying on the weekend. i have no desire to go out anymore or have fun. i miss the old Kat. 

5 weeks until summer and then i'll be with people who actually care about me. don't get me wrong i have people that care about me here and thanks! but at home my best friends and family are there. i miss them more than anything right now and can't wait to see them. if i had it my way i would never come back to this place.i'm ready to start over. move somewhere where i don't know anybody...florida maybe?! that way i can find the old, carefree Kat. 

this weekend i'm going to alabama. i couldn't be more excited to get out of this town we call nac. i'm gonna have fun and forget about the stresses of the world. then in couple of weeks i'm going to kansas to visit some of my favorite people. 

hopefully the week will get better. i had a freakin awesome weekend and only to be ruined. i had a conversation with this guy tonight...he told me that he has nothing to worry about b/c he doesn't tell anybody anything. i may try that...keep everything to myself. that way i don't bug anybody, hurt anybody, and nobody will have anything to say. yeah i may drive myself crazy but oh well...i have to look out for me! 

some good things did happen this weekend. 1) me and anna got to spend time together going to tyler! whoo-hoo for girl talk! 2) i might be playing tennis at SFA next year. i was talking to a girl on the team and she was going to tell coach about me and then said i would need to go talk to him. I'm SO excited. it's gonna be so stinkin' awesome. i love the game (played all day friday...i love it so much) so why not try and play it for the school. not to brag but they said i was really good..hehehe!! 

alright that's enough for tonight! hopefully tomorrow it'll be a positive entry! who knows though?!

"event","so this weekend was absolutely great! the most exciting thing is that anna and will are finally engaged!! i'm so excited for both of them and all i can say is...it's about time!! so anyways... the rommie and i spent the whole weekend together going to pretty much every sporting event that was going on! it started friday night when we went to the basketball game..both teams sucks and lost! saturday we went to the softball games and they were fun!! i'm gonna start going to the games more often! today we went to the softball game and then i went to the tennis match! both teams lost which sucked! we also went to the soccer game and they lost but we just won't go there!

so i played tennis on friday and saturday and it was great fun! saturday while melissa and i were playing a guy from northwestern came out there and was watching us! when we took a break he was talking to meliss and the conversation went a little something like this:
man: so do y'all play for the team?!
melissa: no
man: are you serious?!...y'all have pretty good ground strokes
man: did y'all play in highschool?
melissa: yeah
man: are you SURE y'all don't play for the team?!
(minutes later)
melissa: kat be nice to the man...he might have money and could get us somewhere! 

that's pretty exciting that somebody thinks that we're good enough to play in college! we went looking at all the people involved in sports at northwestern to see if he had any ties but he didn't! it kinda sucked b/c we were talking about it and if had offered us to go there to play tennis we sure would've taken it...or at least i would've without even thinking about it! we're gonna go to the match when sfa plays them to see if he's here. so...the thought actually crossed my mind to try out for our team but i decided i didn't want to b/c i didn't want to loose my passion for the game. right now i enjoy playing and look foward to going out there and i know that if i made the team and was forced to practice then i wouldn't enjoy it as much!  so as for now i'll just keep going out there and hitting, meeting hot guys, and having fun! oh and hopefully i'll have a job teaching girls from my church tennis...whoo-hoo money!! 

well i'm ready for spring break!! only one more week and then i'll be going home to see my family and friends! the best friend kristi won't be there so hopefully i'll have fun..me and nicole are gonna hang out! i'll be subbing at a school too so that'll be fun...and put some money in my pocket for all of my trips coming up! i'm going to kansas to party with the theta xi boys and then to troy st. for a flag football tournament! i'm kinda excited! mom also has planned to come down here so it'll be good to see her and my sisters if they come.

well i'm going to bed! everybody have a great week..only 1 more left until spring break!

until later:

i've started playing tennis again! and let me say if you wanna meet somebody go to the tennis courts. melissa and i won the intramural tennis doubles...2nd year in a row...we're going for the dynasty title next year! umm...that's really the only exciting thing that has happened since we got back to school!

oh well actually the lastest drama is pretty funny if you ask me! i've been accused of giving people around campus dirty looks! funny i know...i mean really...can't you find anything better to do than worry about me and looks that i supposedly give you?! oh well...i have better things to do than worry about that! 

so in may i'm going to k-state to party it up with jerrad and his fraternity! it's the lush luau date party...you know...hot tubs, walking around in swimsuits, and drinking...sounds like a great way to start off finals week and the summer! i'm so excited b/c i miss them so much and just really need to see people that make me smile! 

i'm ready to leave nacogdoches or sfa. just ready for a change and something new. i wanna go somewhere where i can enjoy myself, no drama, and be happy! i'm gonna finish here at sfa only a year (hopefully) left! i don't know what i wanna do but it's not gonna happen here in nac! don't get me wrong...i've made some great friends here who i will miss but i'm not happy here anymore.

oh well...i'll get over it and move on! i'm gonna just gonna have fun and make the best of it!

alrighty i guess i've complained enough! i hope everybody has a great weekend! i'm spending time with my roomie...basketball game, softball game, and who knows what else..maybe some dancin?!! i know i'm playing tennis for sure b/c it's suppose to be so pretty this weekend! i'm so excited!

"event","so the last time i updated this thing was...i think a week ago! nothing really exciting has actually happened in my life! it's been pretty much school and sleep. it's been kind of boring. thursday night tessa, jenna, and i went to the alpha probate...that's when they reveal their new members. it was pretty good..couldn't see anything but my friend motte (his first name is michael) is now an alpha...quite exciting! then on friday the kappa's had their probate and my friends ronnie, anthony, charles, and tim all are now kappas! i'm so excited for all of them! thursday night was another night at Raguet, Tx as keldrick and ed call it! we had cake...i wanted cake so i went and got one...and played monopoly, battle of the sexes, and nintendo! it was actually a lot of fun. top sang to us and was our d.j. i'm really excited about living with tessa and jenna. it's going to be tons of fun and keldrick and ed said they'd come hng out with us and we'll cook for them! 

friday night was a night of nothing. we went and watched the village. i don't know why people think it's scary. it was a good movie but i didn't like the way it ended...i need that closure that everything was going to be okay! anywho...after that i went for another fun night of sitting around with the guys in lloyd's room. that room is like the place to be and i swear it has a revolving door..people are always in and out of that room! it was fun just sitting aroud and watching t.v.

saturday i laid in bed pretty much all day watching football...go figure! auburn won which made me very happy! i really wish they got to play in the orange bowl for the championship but the bcs is so screwed up they have to go to the rose bowl! anywho after that it was party time! tessa and i went to the annex party! there were so many freakin people there! it was actually fun until people started fighting! i don't understand why people have to fight all the time! everybody's having fun and then some drunk guy has to start s**t! it really ruined the night! oh and i wasn't too happy with braylon either....but what's new! i think it's time for us to go on another break from each other! christmas break needs to get here fast! anywho...after that i just came back and went to bed. what a fun and eventful night...NOT...and to think i was rather excited about this party too! 

sunday- so today was very lazy too! i did a whole lot of nothing but i did manage to score a date! it's funny how you can be joking around with somebody to come take a nap with you and then next thing he's asking you out on a date! i've been giddy all day..imagine that! i didn't even let braylon get to me when he called in a pissy mood! i'm moving on...slowly but surely! i'm really excited though...oh what to wear!! also i'm going to a thing in lufkin with my family from church! it's going to be just us girls! i'm really excited about that too. this weekend is going to be a lot of fun...date, ""family time"" and if there's time the basketball game saturday. it's been awhile since i've watched basketball but i'm still not in the mood. i guess i'm still in my football state of mind and when all football is over then i'll turn my focus to basketball! 

alright well i'm going to go finish working on stuff! i've done nothing but slept for 4 hours today! i guess i should do some homework since finals are in a week. i'm very excited to go home and spend time with my friends and family. i kinda miss all of them..especially the angels! i hope everybody's in the christmas spirit b/c i sure am!! i still don't know what i want for christmas though! this time next year though i will be going on a cruise! i'm so excited! i hope everybody has a great week! hang in there for all you college kids...christmas break is right around the corner and then you can let go, relax, and party!

"event","so i hope everybody had an awesome thanksgiving break! if it was anything like mine it was a much needed break to get away and relax! i had such an awesome break but i am glad to be back!

alright so the vacation started on tuesday! i wasted an hour of my day by going to my educational psychology class b/c i didn't even take a quiz therefore we could've been on the road around 10! so i get out of class at 1:45 and it starts raining! by the time i get back to my room it's pouring and you can't see anything! i was not happy at all b/c i was ready to go home but i waited it out and about 30 minutes later it cleared up! so we were on the road about 3. alright so we're driving and everything's going great! then my ""friend"" decides he was hungry so we go to sonic and like normal people i turned off my car while we waited for our food! well we get our food and i go turn on the car and it does nothing! we look at each other and i try again...NOTHING! so i start freaking out, the ""friend"" starts getting upset with me b/c i'm almost in tears, and carrie's just sitting in her car trying to figure out what to do! well we call everybody we know...mechanics, dad, and friends...to find out what to do! well my oil was low so we go get oil and carrie buys booster cables! the ""friend"" did everything! i was so happy he was with me b/c i sure would've sat in henderson waiting for my dad to come get me! so we get my car started and i get what i want..the ""friend"" driving home...me sleeping! we get to his house and my car starts smoking! turns out mr. fix-it forgot to put the cap back on after pouring the oil in...oops! so we unload his stuff go get more oil to put in my car and then i'm on my way home! i get home to a family who was VERY excited to see me..which made me smile b/c i missed them....and then we go eat! it was so good to have all of us home...minus the older sis...it seemed as things had never changed! we did talk about marriage alot and i quote my mom...""well dad you know they're in college b/c they're talking about husbands!"" i love my parents! so we go home and hang out for a little while..play monopoly and just catch up on life! i then went and saw derrian for a much needed visit! we haven't seen each other since july! we caught up and spent time together. i can't wait till christmas break when we have more time together! 


alright so wednesday morning...time to go to lubbock! that is the worst drive in the world! driving from nac to dallas isn't the best but at least there's some things to look at! on the way to lubbock there is NOTHING except dirt and every couple of hours you hit a city! so i slept the whole way b/c i was extremely tired! we get to lubbock about 7 and spend time with kristi and her friend kody! he's a great guy and i'm very happy for whatever happens between them! well when we get to lubbock i get sick...no fun at all! after dinner we went and hung out with some of kristi's friends...they played football...one of them was really cute and great guy! anywho...turkey day...i was kinda of sad b/c it marked the 3 year since my cousin passed away but after talking to my aunt and hearing that she was doing just wonderful i was okay! we went and watched the football team practice which was pretty cool! it was cold but how many people can say they watched the team practice up close and personal?! after that we hung out around kristi's house watching football and had thanksgiving dinner! we really didn't do much that night b/c i was sick and well there was really nothing to do. paul came and hung out with us for a little while...he's the really cute football player. 


friday- kristi, her mom, and sister went shopping in the madness! i stayed home and just kind of took it slow. watched a little football, read my book, and relaxed b/c i was on vacation! it was wonderful. i did meet up with them for lunch and did end up going to the mall with them! i realized how much i dislike shopping and don't ever want to do it again! i'm gonna start online shopping b/c it's so much easier! after that we went home to watch more football and hang out around the house! 


saturday- GAMEDAY!!! i was so excited b/c i was going to the texas tech football game! i love football and will continue to go to all the games i can until the seasons up! anybody up for going to the cotton bowl?! i don't know who's playing but football is football! anyways...we go to the field and we got to look around the football facilites and sit in on a meeting that head coach, mike leach, had with the recruits! i felt kind of important! we then went to get our tickets that paul had reserved for us...he was my temporary boyfriend for the day! so the highlight of my trip was when i got to walk down the football tunnel, as the players were coming out of the locker room to go warm-up and everybody was watching us! i felt like all eyes were on me and then i got to take pictures with kristi on the field...it was such a rush! we also sat with the saddletramps next to the band which was a lot of fun too! i throughly enjoyed myself at the game and tech won which made it ten times better! alright so after the game we went to eat and then it was time to go out! we ended up going to cricket's, some bar and it's amazing what you can get away with when you know the right people! so we were hanging out at the bar, guys bought drinks for us, and well we hung out with the senior football players. some of them were nice and others were just jerks! it was fun though up until i got sick and we had to go home! i had a great time though!...sorry carrie for the drunk phone calls! i really need to work on my drunk dialing!

so here we are sunday night! we got home around 4 and then me and braylon headed back around 6:30! i was so glad he was with me b/c he drove back again! this trip was so much more fun than the ride home! we talked about so much stuff and got so much stuff worked out! we have never laughed as much as we did tonight! i'm really glad that things are better between us. i'm glad that we can just talk about stuff and not be worried about what the other might say. i'm glad we have a friendship instead of ending things on a bad note. i'm glad we can be honest about things that are going on in our head. i'm glad we can ask the other a question without the other getting upset! i'm glad we can talk about stuff and laugh about it together. i'm glad he's finally opening up to me. i'm glad i got to meet his family! i'm glad i don't have to worry about saying something that will upset him! i'm glad he's honest with me and tells me that he likes me no matter how much i cry and complain! i'm glad that we just hang out! i'm glad that our relationship is growing! 

so this break was just awesome! i was excited that the note started on a good note and ended on an even better note! things can only get better from here! i'm going to bed b/c i have class tomorrow and i've riden all the way across texas! i hope everybody has a great week!

"event","so the jacks played their last football game last night! it was senior day and well they didn't win their last game at home. the first half they did pretty good not letting northwestern state score. the second half it was all down hill from there! the quarterbacks weren't doing anything! i mean the first one throws a pick, so we put in the second string and he fumbles! instead of trying the third string quarterback we put in the first string qb and well he throws an interception...good call coach! so in the third quarter braylon was going to make a tackle and he got hit pretty hard. i didn't see the whole play but all i know is after the whistle was blown he sure didn't get up for awhile. he was hurt and struggling and i was freaking out! he finally got up but he was done playing football for sfa! it turns out he has a broken or bruised rib...i'm not sure b/c i havent talked to him yet. ron also suffered from a concussion and had to stay in the hospital overnight! anywho...we lost the game and chief caddo. the boys were all banged up and hurting! we're all pretty upset that our season is over even after our good start. we'll be getting a new coach sometime soon and hopefully he'll turn things around for us! our seniors did good leading our team and now it's time for others to step up and take charge! 

so after the game i hung out with danny and lloyd. we watched the florida/florida st. game...better yet i watche the game and they both slept! poor guys they were all worn out! after that me, jenna, tessa, keldrick, ed, and sug all went bowling! it was so much fun just to go and hang out! after that we went back to keldrick's and ed's for some nintendo, cookies, and fun! we ended up playing scattagories and it was so much fun! it's amazing what you can learn about people just through their answers. we ended up playing that all night and didn't get home until 3. it's amazing how much fun you can have staying sober! 

well i have two days of school left until thanksgiving break! i'm so excited b/c i get to see my family and kristi! the ride home will also be fun b/c braylon's riding home with me! it's going to give us a lot of time to talk and just spned time together! i'm so looking foward to it! well i hope everybody has a wonderful thanksgiving break! i'll be in lubbock with kristi. we'll be going to a football game and then probably get into some sort of trouble like we also do when we're together! i'm excited! y'all have fun too and just think we'll have only 2 full weeks until finals and christmas break!!

"event","so this weekend was pretty fun! tessa and i hung out on friday night! we just watched movies and hung out! it was fun! i enjoy not doing anything on friday's except hanging out! ali also came over and watched the oc! we were suppose to go out but neither one of us wanted to so we hung out!

so saturday was...GAME DAY! so of course i woke up at the crack of dawn and just hung out around the room like i do every saturday before games! i also went to tar'a lingerie shower! she got some really cute stuff! i can't wait until my lingerie shower! i'm kind of worried b/c people might take this time to get back at me and get me some crazy stuff but hey that's okay!! i can't wait!

so jenna and i went to lumberjack earlier and it was pretty empty! it was kind of depressing! after that we headed to the game! jacks got off to a good start! the team that played yesterday was the same team that played at the beginning of the season! defense held mcneese on 3rd downs, forcing them to punt and then offense responded by scoring touchdowns! it was a very exciting game! we were also entertained by the some of the freshmen redshirts that were dancing to the bands songs! they were hilarious! so we won 55-7! bug got 2 interceptions which was just awesome, danny got to play at quarterback, keldrick recovered a fumble, ryan blocked a kick, braylon caused a fumble and well as a team they were playing their ""A"" game! too bad that it's too late into the season! it kind of sucks to start off so good being ranked and probably going to the play-offs to being unranked and not going to the play-offs! so next week is the last football game, it's senior night so it will probably be pretty emotional (braylon's a senior *tear*)! this was our year and who knows what happened! i'm still very proud of the guys!! 

so after the game carrie and i watched the rest of the tech/a&m game..tech lost which sucks....anywho and i realized that sfa has the worst school spirit! you know at the beginning of the season everybody was going to the game and cheering the team on and then as soon as we lose one game people stop coming! it's pretty sad! if you look at a&m their stands are filled every game whether they're losing or winning! their fans stay from kickoff to win the clock hits 00:00! they're also screaming and cheering their team on! i wish that we had school spirit like that! where the stands and grass areas are full of people in purple, cheering the guys on! people talk about how our team sucks but you know they really don't! all teams have their bad games..that doesn't automatically make you suck! the only game that was packed was sam houston and that's only b/c they're our biggest rival and because people just wanted to seen! it would probably mean so much to the guys to see thier fellow students in the stand the whole game cheering for them! they give up b/c we give up on them! last night at the game at the beginning of the fourth quarter the stnands were empty! the only people still there were the parents, bands, cheerleaders and loyal fans! it was depressing to see that! so what if it was cold! that's why they make gloves, coats, and blankets! just bundle up and get out there! it wasn't even that cold! also look at mcneese...they haven't had a winning season but their fans jumped on a 5 hour bus ride to come and support their team! so i'm very disappointed in our school spirit and i really hope it gets better!

okay that's my tangent for the day! i'm gonna go watch football, take a nap and maybe even do some homework! hope everybody has a great week! one more week until thanksgiving break!! I get to see kristi and jerrad...i so can't wait!!

"event","so this week so far just hasn't been very good! i've just been very frustrated over a lot of stuff! i've come to realize that i'm truly not happy here at SFA! it doesn't matter how many things i'm involved in or who i hang out with...i'm just not happy! i really don't know what's brought this feeling along but it kind of hit me this weekend! i didn't do anything except watch sex and the city, and football! maybe it's the fact that i'm lonely and miss everybody from back home! i talk to them all the time but i just want to see them again! 


maybe i'm just tired of putting my heart out there to be crushed! maybe i'm just trying to get away from it all! maybe the two people i want to spend time with i can't! one i know i shouldn't talk to but i enjoy spending time with him! we spent 8 months together! i know that there were bad times but when we were together we had fun! maybe i screwed it up and didn't trust him when i should have! maybe we jumped into fast, instead of being good friends first! i don't know but i miss spending time with him! the second one is just 2 hours away and we only get to see each other when we're at home! he knows everything about me and i know i can go to him for anything! i miss having him five minutes away! 

i also miss my family believe it or not! i haven't seen them since like the first week in october! i won't see them again until christmas! my sister is coming home from missouri and i probably won't get to see her! it's harder on me than i thought it was! all i want to do is spend time with them even if it is just a couple of hours! i know they're only a phone call away but i want to see them! i want to sit around on saturdays and do nothing but watch football all day and then movies late into the night! i want to go to my sister's soccer game and plays! i feel like i'm missing out on so much by being out here! i know that i have prior engagements and so do they and it's hard to find a weekend that's just open for all of us! 

i miss my best friend kristi! we were always spending time together! we talk about each other to our other friends! there's nobody that can replace the other! i hate the distance between us! i hate that we can't be together when the other has a bad day! we can call each other and complain and try and cheer each other up...most of the time it works...but it's just not the same! i can't wait until thanksgiving break when we get to hang out and catch up on things! 

now for all you nac people that are reading this...i want to say thankyou for everything! for putting up with me when i'm acting like a crazy girl to when i'm just down and not fun to be around! i know it's hard to put up with me and i thankyou for doing that! i'm sorry if i have ever hurt you! i love spending time with all of you! you have all touched my life in some way! i just want to ask you to be patient with me and pray that i just come back around and to my normal self! i miss my normal self!  maybe this is just a phase i'm going through and i hope that i get through it! i don't know what i'm going to do but i'll find a way! 

thanks and i love all of you!

"event","so this weekend so far has been VERY relaxing! i've done a whole lot of nothing! friday carrie and kelsey packed up and went on a spur of the moment roadtrip to a&m! i would've gone but i was tired and well had plans for saturday! therefore, i stayed here and watched sex and the city all night long! if you've never watched it...you should b/c it's freakin awesome! 

so today was well college football day! so i woke up about 10 watched some more sex and the city and then started watching games! most of them were pretty good. mizzou lost...they so should've won that one! i just don't understand how you can blow a 21 point lead! i mean you're defense was doing awesome the first half...why can't you keep that up?! the most exciting game of the night was a&m and ou. a&m put up a good fight but ou is just too good! 

well for those of you who are wondering...the jacks lost...pretty bad actually! it sucked...our quarterback is no good anymore and without our quarterback tony can't do anything! our defense does really good in holding teams but offense just can't convert plays into points. they drive all the way to the red zone *inside the 20 for you illiterate football people* and then turn the ball over! we have never played as bad as we did tonight...offense that is! keldrick scored another touchdown! he's been doing really good this year. he has either a touchdown or interception every game! i think he should just play both ways! so our team that started out 5-0 is now 5-4! i don't understand how a team that has beat ranked teams is losing in their own conference. the past 3 games we should have won! yes we were without 8 of our guys this game but you can't count on 8 guys to carry your team! plus santiago is stupid for trying to move players around on defense! why would you do that...our defense was all playing different positions than what they've been doing! it's really frustrating b/c our guys really had a chance to be the southland conference champs and also go to the playoffs! well all of those are out the door and well they'll be spending thanksgiving with their families. how awesome would it have been to go to the playoffs over thanksgiving break! this was our year...next year will be a rebuilding year b/c we're losing so many of our seniors that start and help us out! it's going to be very interesting! also we need a new coach! this is the 3 year our coach has had a losing season. if we get lucky then we'll be 6-4. but still that's not enough....so i say we hire a new coach! from what i've heard the guys don't like him anyway! so get somebody in here that's gonna help our guys get that conference ring! all of our other sports are winning conference left and right...it's the football teams turn!! 

okay enough on that...so me and jenna had a girls night! we went out to dinner, made cupcakes for the guys, played jeopardy and watched a movie! it was really nice to get to sit and do nothing...well i did work on homework! 

alrighty well i'm gonna go start season 4 of sex and the city and go to bed! have a great rest of the weekend and i'll talk to you people later!

until later:

"event","today was just a very emotional day! one moment i was happy, the next i was just mad and didn't want to talk to anybody! so today i skipped math b/c 1) my 930 class was canceled and then 2) the stuff we're doing is just way easy so i decided to sleep in! it was wonderful! so the sun is shining but NO it's still cold outside. it's going to be a misreable winter for me b/c i hate the cold weather..i don't have winter clothes!! maybe i'll go shopping with daddy over thanksgiving break! so the day is going fine i go talk to ali and we just hang out for a little while!

alright- so i go get the pinelog to read and i pick it up and what's on the front cover?...the article on the 8 guys who got suspended for fighting after the sam game. they have 6 of the guy's pictures! now i understand that everybody knows that they were suspended but the way the newspaper went about putting it in the paper! they didn't have to put the guy's pictures on the front page! they didn't even have to put the article on the front page...just put it in the back with the rest of the sports news! there are so many other things going on that should've been on the front page! the way they went about this was wrong...the way they put their pictures on there made it look like the guys had committed some crime or something! everybody knows that guys don't smile in their pictures especially football guys! i'm sick of the pine log and them writing about all the negative things going on! so therefore, me and jenna are going to write a letter to the editor telling them that what they did was totally uncalled for! i know the guys aren't to happy about it either! 

alright so after getting all upset over that things kind of got better. i got to take a nap and did a little homework! i talked to derrian tonight and that just really made my day! i miss him so much and guess what...he might be coming to see me this weekend! i really hope he does! we probably wouldn't do anything but lay in bed and watch football but that's okay with me and him! that's how we spend time together! if he doesn't come this weekend then we will so see each other over thanksgiving break! i really can't wait! i wish he went to school here with me! 

so back to football! so i was talking to chase tonight and he was telling me about the game against sam! so apparently the head ref of southland conference called and apoligized to coach santiago about making bad calls! we should've won that game but b/c there were SEVERAL bad calls that were against us we didn't! so basically the refs screwed our chances of winning our conference! that's a load of crap! they seriously need to get it where coaches can challenge plays in college b/c a lot of games would turn out differently! i say we play the game all over again over thanksgiving break! that would be freakin awesome and then the guys would just go their seperate ways to the locker rooms instead of trying to shake hands! i would stay for the game! so the coaches keep talking about making this sfa/sam rivalry healthy again! all i have to say is...it isn't going to happen! the tension between our schools is so big that there is really no way to get it where everybody's friends again! we're big rivals...WE HATE EACH OTHER! also...for those of you who are wondering...miguel is going to be fine. he's in the hospital still, had surgery 2 days ago but he's going to be okay! he's gonna be in TONS of trouble when he's out but at least nobody was killed! 

alright so i was all upset and in tears (yes i cried when i found out about the game) i went to kelsey's b/c carrie got me a present! carrie knows just what to say to make my tears go away! she bought this month's cosmo!! i was so excited and forgot about football for a second! so my night is ending on a good note! me and jenna aren't going to louisiana anymore. it's a long drive and i'm just not in the mood. we're gonna stay here and play nintendo and just have girl's weekend....until the guys get back. well i'm gonna go read my cosmo and go to bed! be good everybody and have a great weekend!

last night he came over and we talked about our future and everything! we're gonna have 3 kids...romeo, roderick, and rachel! all of their birthdays will be in august or september....if you do the math everything will happen during football bowl games in december *wink wink*! so we're gonna live in miami in the same neighborhood as let's say...usher or shaq! so yes a gated community! our neighbors are going to be my best friend kristi on one side and his best friend on the other! we're going to have four cars...he'll have his sports car and work car. I'll have my bmw and then we'll have the family tahoe or escalade! romeo and roderick are going to play football and ali's going to be the coach. i'm just gonna be the cute little team mom that plans the end of year parties and has team parties at the house after the game! rachel's just going to probably do cheerleading or play tennis! that's if ali lets her...he's very protective of his baby girl! 

we also discussed having a house in the hamptons so when the kids go visit his mom we can go to our house! then we'll have another house here in texas since that's where my parents are going to live! in our regular home we'll have a media room and a pool! friday's are reserved for watching romeo and roderick play football and then saturdays and sundays will be for college football and maybe nfl games. it just depends! during all of the bowl games the kids will have the privilege of visiting the in-laws so we can enjoy our time together..hehehehe!! oh and every now and then me, kristi, and our friends are gonna get to take a trip to one of our homes and just have girls weekend! we'll go shopping and just relax while the kids are at home with the dads!! 

i'm also gonna stay at home with the kids while they're young and in elementary school but maybe when they're in middleschool or highschool i might substitute teach just so i'll have my own spending money for girls weekends! ali said he'll take care of me as far as shopping and the kids! so basically i can stay at home and work around the house and spend time with the kids...they're gonna be really cute by the way!! 

so there you go! now we just have to finish school and get rid of his current girlfriend...lol! i'm not worried though...she doesn't enjoy football so she won't be around long! i'll keep y'all updated!!

have a great day...stay dry if you live in nac and stay warm if you're in lubbock..it's snowing there!!! oh and go vote!!

"event","so this weekend was just freakin awesome!! it goes down in the books as one of those i would do all over again!!

so friday night tessa and i went to the step show! some of them were really good, others well just shouldn't of showed up! the best part was when the zeta's made fun of the a.k.a.s! it's about time somebody told them that they're not all that and just rude! it was awesome except how the moms from both sororities started fighting! the girls have moved on so why can't you?! jason's fraternity did really good too! after the step show we came back and chilled in the room for awhile and then went to the bonfire! it was pretty fun! i got to see thomas and haff! i haven't seen them in forever! i realized i really do miss them and wish that they were back at school here! Haff has lost a lot of weight and me and him could probably where the same size clothes...pretty scary! so the seniors talked and got everybody pumped up for the game against sam! it was a fun time! i was dancing and just having a great time talking to everybody! i also got to talk to my new friend #14 and he told me how much he enjoyed the spirit towels the sweethearts got them! i was really excited about that b/c some of the sweethearts got up every morning to stuff their lockers with goodies and then came back the next day to find it laying under their workout stuff..kinda frustrating! but then we got them the towels and that was their favorite part! the towels were really cute too if you didn't get to see them! after the bonfire it was off to bed b/c gameday was right around the corner!!

saturday i woke up at freakin 7 in the morning! i have no idea why but i was alive, alert, and ready to go! i kinda just took the morning slow since i knew after 12 the day was gonna be full!! so i went to the yellow house for the alumi lunch and it was so great seeing everybody that's graduate! i didn't realize how much i missed them until i saw them yesterday! it was great! then i had to go to the game early in order to pass out the spirit towels to the fans! they loved them too!! alright- so it's game time! the stands are packed, the bands are playing their fight songs, and everybody is just ready for the big rival game of sfa vs. sam houston..purple and orange do not look good together! so it's game time- the jacks come out and don't play as good as they usually do in the first half. we had a chance to go up 3-0 and the kick was blocked! then sam came back and scored b/c we just couldn't get to the quarterback! his arm is awesome and the offensive line did their job in blocking for him! so at the end of the first half it's 14-17...sam on top! then in the second half our team came out playing a whole lot better! offense was doing some what better and defense kept doing a great job..ryan blocked a kick! the second half of the game was so much more exciting b/c it was a close game...it kept going back and forth in scoring! so alright there's one minute left in the game....our offense is advancing the ball and doing good! so there's 30 seconds left in the game and we bring out our field goal team...we're down 28-31...if rossner makes the kick then the game goes into overtime! well the ball is snapped, ryan goes to kick, it's blocked!!! sam won the game. so the game was really exciting and our guys did good! if it wasn't for our defense then sam probably would've run all over us! they put up a good fight and gave sam a scare. so after the game our guys were going to sing the alma mater and the class-less jerks from sam decided to go stand on our logo. our guys didn't like that too much and some words were probably said b/c the next thing you know they're fighting! players and coaches are getting pushed down, player's helments are coming off, and everybody's just mad! it wasn't good at all! i was so upset i left and didn't stick around to watch! it makes me so upset that we play a good game and then shrink down to their level! really...they're not worth fighting! they are a bunch of jerks that have no class! i hate sam houston with a passion!!! don't ever expect my kids to go there!!

so after i came back to my room to calm down i went to the yellow house for singing and visiting more with the alumni and it was fun! i went to eat with lynsie, her family, and a bunch of people from sam! i was not happy but i went anyways and ended up being okay! so i'm full and now it's time for what i've been waiting for all homecoming week...the after parties!! so the fab five (kat, jenna, jessica, tessa, and crystal) get ready to go out! we decided on the alpha party (jason's fraternity) b/c girls got in free until 11! at first it was pretty boring but by the time we were ready to go the fun started happening! tessa got hit on all night and it was pretty funny! haff and braxton tried to get us to go to the after party with them and then go back to #14's house to ""watch a movie!"" we passed! we spent half the night looking for jason b/c tessa REALLY wanted to dance with him...jason has a crush on tessa! so we didn't find him and then when we did he was working the door! so crystal, jenna, and jessica left at the beginning to go somewhere else...so me and tessa were stuck there with no ride or so we thought! the other 3 came back and got us and we went looking for more fun to get into! we didn't make it too far b/c nothing was really going on. we did go see ryan up at whataburger with his friends and crystal talked to him! apparently she told him that he needs to hook up with me and he said he's trying too! i really like him! he's such a good guy and will treat me so much better than what i had last year! so keep your fingers crossed that it all works out! we did end up hanging out last night but we were both so tired it wasn't for long! 

so it's sunday...HAPPY HALLOWEEN!! i'm going to take a nap b/c i'm tired and running on very low sleep from all week! y'all have fun doing whatever you're doing tonight...be careful!! oh i talked to my best friend and i'm going to texas tech thanksgiving weekend for the football game! i'll also probably spend thanksgiving with her family! i'm so excited b/c that means more fun with the best friend and hot guys at tech!! have a great day and week!!

"event","so it's currently 8:25 am and i can't sleep! i had to put stuff in the football lockerroom this morning at 8! why did i volunteer?! i don't have class until 10! all i have to say is the boys better appreciate it b/c i don't wake up this early for just anybody! also i did learn that coach santiago doesn't like any of this stuff we're doing! the guys love it but head coach doesn't it! why you ask? probably b/c it takes their focus off the sam game! i understand that it's a very important game but it's homecoming and fun! the guys love it and well it's for them not you santiago! i seriously don't think it's taking their focus off the game! it's just something to say ""good job and keep up the good work! oh by the way...BEAT SAM!!"" i think it's cute and all i have to say is...at least we're not sleeping with them and taking their focus away from the game b/c we could do that instead of getting them candy and treats! so suck it up and get over it santiago- the guys deserve it!

so kat's in town! it was so good to see her yesterday! i seriously wish she was still here at school! things were so great then...don't get me wrong they're great now! but she was my other half, who knew what i was thinking and if i wasn't thinking it she sure was! she kept me out of depression by just making me take my mind off of whatever was going on! yes she did buy cakes all the time and yes we probably didn't need them but every bite was worth it! i'm glad she's happy at home but why can't she be here and be happy? so kat when you read this...""i miss you so much! i'm glad everything's going good at home and i'm glad you're happy!""

so last night i hung out with kat and nyc for a little while and played ncaa 2005 on xbox! SFA is on there! it was awesome b/c i got to play the big homecoming game on there! i was very amused and every player was on there! so after i finished hanging out with them i thought i was going to bed but i ended up talking to ali for what seemed like forever! it was fun though! 

well i'm gonna go get ready for my one class! tomorrow's thursday and that means the weekend gets started and homecoming festivities begin for me at least! i won't have anything to do until sunday of monday! i'm excited!! everybody have a wonderful day...it's suppose to be hot and humid!

"event","so i have a dilemma on my hands! there's this guy who apparently likes me! he keeps telling people and askng people if i'm talking to anybody or have a boyfriend. the only problem is i'm not attracted to him. he's a nice guy and all but yeah..i just don't know! i'll still be friends with him and everything. it's crazy guys...it's amzing how ""good game"" turns into a big crush!

so apparently it's been brought to my attention that i've been ignoring people! if you have been a victim i just want to say i'm sorry! i don't do it on purpose i just talk to whoever's talking to me. i don't ignore people on purpose unless i just don't like you and trust me you would know if i didn't like you! so i'm sorry for ignoring people and anything else i've done!

so today was pretty good! besides being forced to go to my late class everything was fine! i love not having my 11 class anymore! it's nice to get to come back to my room and lay in bed while watching young and the restless, saved by the bell, and jeopardy! i lead such a boring life but hey i'm not complaining! i actually enjoy having nothing to do sometimes except enjoying my afternoons! 

so this week is homecoming week! lots of crazy stuff going on from sweetheart stuff to parties! it's gonna be crazy and i'm so excited! the only bad part is i have to get up at 8 every morning to put stuff in the football locker room! seriously 8?! that's so early especially for somebody who doens't have class till 10! so next weekend i've decided that i'm going to louisiana for the football game against nicholls state! i've come to the conclusion that i've spent more time on the road between football and home then i have in the classroom! (i've only missed 2 classes all semester!) that's a lot of traveling and i'm not done yet! our yellow house minister sent us an email about a retreat in florida...guess who's going! that's right me! i'm so excited and can't wait! yes it's gonna be a long drive but nothing can be as bad as the bus ride to iowa! if you can do that then you can do ANYTHING! i also talked to my kansas boys and it's their homecoming week too! oh how i wish i was up there with them! i miss them so much and can't wait to see them again! so that's another roadtrip in the spring..if anybody wants to go just tell me! long car ride= hot guys at the end of the road!

alright i'm really tired and as you read i have to get up early! also kat's probably coming in town so i have to have lots of energy b/c we're gonna be staying up late catching up! plus she's only here for one night/day! i'm so excited i can hardly contain myself! y'all have a great week!

"event","what a wonderful weekend! the original plan was to ride the bus on saturday to the game watch the jacks and then come home! well....i talked to lynsie and all plans got revised! so we end up going to bridgeport, texas to watch her brother play football! where is bridgeport, texas you ask? well it's in the middle of nowhere! so i go to lynsie's house and i knew she lived in the country and i knew she had cows but what i didn't know was that the cows would actually be in the yard! we pull up to her house and they are in the middle of the road and wouldn't move and then i yelled ""hey cow"" and they started running towards us! it was quiet amazing and i was VERY amused! 

okay so the football game...now i knew that the bridgeport bulls weren't doing so hot and now i see why! they're coach is just stupid! i mean the quarterback doesn't run and the receivers don't adjust to where the ball is going! now i understand that he's a young quarterback but he needs to learn that you don't drop back and loose yards when you can run and gain a few yards! the first half of the game was very good and they kept up with the eagles but second half i was just frustrated! that's okay..they're learning and everything will get better! 

okay so now it's saturday  morning..which means GAME DAY!!! so i get up,watch highschool football highlights with the mann family, and then get ready for part 2 of this roadtrip! so me and lynsie leave before her parents to go to san marcos. so we're driving down south on 35, i'm on the phone, and we're just outside of burleson when i hear lynsie scream ""oh $**t!"" then the next thing i know she's pulling off the road! well turns out everything locked up, gas and brakes, and then it wouldn't start! so you have 2 girls, broke down car on a major highway, cars driving by honking, and no car knowledge AT ALL! well thank goodness her parent's weren't too far behind b/c we would've been screwed...literally probably! also my dad was no help b/c i called him and he started laughing at me! so lynsie's family gets to where we are and we call roadside assistance to send out a tow truck! by now i'm in tears and scared that i'm not gonna make it to the football game! so lynsie's parents let us take mom's car and head on to san marcos while they keep her car and get it fixed! so we're on the road again...destination-bobcat field in san marcos, tx!

so we get to the game with 30 minutes to spare! i was so excited! so we get to the game and the 1st half looked promising for the jacks! keldrick recovered a fumble and scored a touchdown, and ryan smith blocked a kick and got us good field position! well those 2 things meant ABSOLUTELY nothing to us! so it's first quarter and we have a chance to go up 3-0...well our kicker is very inconsistent and can make field goals 53 yards away but not 30 yards away! so he missed it! okay so later he comes up to kick again to tie the game and..you guessed it..he missed it! so that's 6 free points missed!!! okay so everything else that went wrong was....mike got hurt and they put in zeke...he can't do crap!! he just stands there and then when he realizes that the defense is about to tackle him and throws the ball out of bounds! so our offensive line didn't do very good blocking for the quarterback! we didn't take advantage of our good field position! we kept committing personal fouls! we just weren't the lumberjacks that played the first games of the season! so as you know i was in a HORRIBLE mood last night after the game and if you called me and i yelled at you i'm sorry (carrie)! i was just really frustrated that our guys didn't play their best game! we were suppose to win that game! plus...sam won last night which would puts them up above us in rankings and they're going to have more fuel to want to beat us this week! we have to win this week b/c it's homecoming and we're playing sam houston! i hate sam houston and it would give me more satisfaction to beat them and send them home crying! 

so on a good note... i got to see marco martin and codi pettigrew...she hasn't changed her last name yet! they came down to watch our friend krys williams play! it was really good seeing them! and i'm so excited about christmas break when we all get together (marco's friends included) and celebrate codi's 21st birthday! oh so fun..hot guys and a party it's gonna be wild! 

so today i had to do sweetheart stuff today! we have so much crap for the guys it's crazy! they better appreciate us sweethearts when it's all said and done! i mean i have to get up 8 am to put stuff in their lockers! they better love me!

so i'm chillen with carrie and kelsey, watching baseball and eating pizza! it's raining outside so it's the PERFECT night to do nothing but watch baseball! go red sox!

well i'm gonna go! i'll talk to you later!

"event","so today was a great day overall! classes flew by and after that i got to enjoy my afternoon! the weather was great and i didn't have a thing to do..imagine that! jessica and i were going to read by the ag pond but it was a little to hot so instead we came back to my room to watch stepmom..or jessica watched stepmom and i slept! for dinner we went to the yellowhouse for dinner/devo and it was pretty cool until a certain somebody started getting on my nerves! i have come to the conclusion that i can't stand watching sports with stupid people! i mean really if you don't know what's going on don't say anything to make yourself look dumber! if you don't understand something ask somebody quietly instead of shouting something out and people are like ""okay time for you to shutup and leave!""

anywho...after the yellowhouse me and jenna went to hailey's to help tie ribbon to put on the football players cars! this homecoming stuff is going to be hard work but fun! i'm really excited! i also got to know hailey better and megan...they're both sweethearts with me! so after leaving there i was going to go to jitterbugs to watch something that i wanted to see but i just wasn't in the mood. instead me and jenna went to keldrick's to play scattagories! it was so much fun! i didn't think you could take such a simple game and make into something so hard..but keldrick did! it was fun spending time with them! so after we played that me and jenna played jeporady on the old nintendo for a little while until i got tired! 

after leaving there i got my second wind and went and hung out at kelsey's for a little while. it was pretty fun i love just hanging out with friends and not worrying about a dang thing but just talking and enjoying each other's company! 

so this weekend is going to be fun and full of football! our boys play in san marcos so of course i'm going to watch them! we will beat the bobcats!!  i've come to the conclusion that i just can't tell the guys no when it comes to watching them play football! i feel like they're expecting me to be at the game to cheer them on and if i'm not then i'm letting them down! i love those guys! plus tyrell is suppose to score a touchdown just for me.. and i guess the team...but for me first!! i'm rather excited about this game b/c my friend codi and her husband are suppose to come down and i haven't seen them since their wedding in may! it's gonna be a fun trip even though i don't get to go to 6th street that night! oh well...sweetheart duties come first! 

so homecoming week is coming up and i'm so excited! there is so much stuff going on that i don't know where to start! the guys are going to do great and i can't wait to be there to watch them kill the kats! 

alrighty..well it's been a long day/night so i'm going to bed! i have nothing to do but pick up football gifts and tying ribbon! such a hard life i lead! i'll talk to you later!

friday- went and saw friday night lights with jessica and carrie! it was an awesome movie! i also got to meet my football player that i'm a sweetheart for! he's an awesome guy and i get dinner at the end of the year!! also my friend i haven't talked to in 2 years called and said he was in town! overall pretty good day!

saturday- wake up and it's raining outside! clue #1 it's not gonna be a fun day! all of the teams i wanted to win lost their games...clue #2! the jacks lost to an unranked team...clue #3!! so i went to bed at what time....yes 11!! it was wonderful though! 

sunday- went to church! got to spend time with #14..we had fun just laughing and talking! then i got to nap and do laundry! cowboys lost!! seriously...who goes for it on 4th and 1 when you're losing the game!?! yeah parcells don't do that again! care groups was fun tonight at the yellow house! i got to meet a lot of the youth group from church...pretty cool kids! then we finished (almost) putting the tile in the kitchen! it was so much fun though sitting around the kitchen with stephanie, jenny, cricket, dana, travis, and brennan just talking and laughing! those people are fun to talk to! i'm so happy i have a place to go and just relax with people and not care about everything else going on in my life! oh and i got to talk to...we'll call him #92! it'll be interesting to see what happens here!!

okay so on a more serious note! guys i really want to ask you to pray for 2 people and their families!! the first one is travis kelly. he's a 2 year old that goes to my church and i found out today that he has leukemia! it's treatable since they found it early but i mean really...2 years old with this! it's hard on his mom and the rest of the family! so please pray for the kelly family that he gets better! the second one is miles lafferty. apparently he was in a bad wreck this weekend! i think he's still in the hospital. so please pray for him and his family and also his 2 friends that were with him! 

alrighty well i'm going to bed! i hope everybody had a good weekend and has a better week!! i'll talk to everybody later!

"event","so today was just awful! every football game i watched was horrible and stressful! nothing went right today! our jacks that were 4-0 lost tonight! for some reason nothing was really going right for us! yeah we got 2 interceptions and came back(somewhat) but we weren't making our tackles, rossner missed a field goal, and our running game just wasn't good tonight! they shut that down completely! i don't know what was going on in the heads of our defense but they just weren't there tonight! they spent half the game on the field and just really didnt' do anything significant! they shut our running game down and mike just didn't bring his ""a"" game. don't get me wrong we had some big plays but the sfa team that played tonight was not the sfa team that played the first 4 games! 

we need to practice harder this next week b/c uc-davis is going to be ready for us! they won tonight and they're just gonna be ready to hand us a second loss! we're playing on their home turf too which will be easier for them! we also need to win b/c sam houston is sitting at home with smiles on their face b/c we lost tonight. nothing gives them more satisfaction than beating us or seeing us lose! our ranking will also go down from 5 to who knows where...out of the top 10 most likely! 

we're gonna be okay though! at least this is conference play! we have one more game to get everything ready for conference! texas state is going to be ready for us and of course we play there (roadtrip)!! anywho our guys played okay and made a come back from 21 behind to just 7. they're going to be okay..it's our first loss! we'll bounce back next week! i still love my lumberjacks..all 99 of them!

also every team that i picked to win tonight freakin lost! mizzou might be my only hope! good thing i didn't have any money on any of these games b/c i'd be in debt! 

well i'm going back to my bed...the place i've spent pretty much all day!! night!

alrighty...so for weeks now i've been anticipating the movie ""friday night lights"" to come out! i went and saw the first show in nac last night with carrie and jessica! some of the football team was there which made it better just listening to their reactions! the movie was really good and if you follow texas football and know how big it is then you'll enjoy the movie! now i haven't read the book yet but i'm going to now...some guy told me that he really enjoyed it and you never hear about guys enjoying books so i'm going to take his word on it! girls....if you cry in movies then take your tissues b/c you will cry! some of the football players were in there sniffling! on another exciting note...a coach that use to teach at my highschool is in the movie! he plays one of the coaches for odessa! it was pretty cool seeing somebody i know in the movie!  so this movie is now on the list to buy when it comes out on dvd! i'm even going to see it again on friday with the little sister!

"event","so you have those weekends that you never want to do again and then you have those weekends that you would SO do over again and don't regret a thing you did! well this past weekend falls into catagory B!so as most of you know jerrad and his fraternity came down to good ol' texas for some fun! they got in town on thursday night/friday morning and that's when the fun began!!

so friday afternoon we head down to austin for a night of fun! we went to sixth street for dinner and then back to the hotel to get ready! we then head back to sixth street! let's just say i was feeling really good and ready to dance! i danced in the streets...yes i danced in the streets! we found the club and i danced for a little while and then just didn't feel like dancing anymore so i hung out with the other guys that weren't dancing! jerrad sure was showing everybody up...he's too good..nobody can handle him! after the club we head back to the hotel b/c everybody was tired and ready to party some more which we didn't do...instead we all went to bed...at least some of us (hehehehe)! okay so after the club i made a very interesting phone call to carrie! i'm gonna play it back for you...at least what i remember! 
 *kat-""carrie i'm moving to kansas on monday!
 *carrie-""but what about me?!""
 *kat-""well we can see each other when we go home!""
 *carrie-""no kat you can't move to kansas!"" 
 *kat-""okay i won't move monday but at semester i sure am!""
so there you have it! i'm apparently moving to kansas in the spring! we talked about other stuff but i won't be posting that! 

alrighty so saturday after our few hours of sleep we get up and head to college station for some football!! well b/c jerrad's my best friend he let me drive his truck from austin to college station! everything was going great until i had to turn a corner to go park! let's just say i didn't quite make it around the corner! i was turning when i heard a loud sound like i hit a fire hydrant! oh but it wasn't a fire hydrant! it sure was the back right tired hitting the curb and the tire going out on us! i felt horrible! i wanted to crawl into a hole and die!! now jerrad told me not to worry about it but i mean come on i messed up your tire and it's not cheap to get it fixed! I'M STILL VERY SORRY JERRAD! i'm going to work on the street corner starting tomorrow! so that got our pregame fun started....changing a tire! so after that happened and we got everything fixed we hung out until game time! 

so now game time.....k-state wasn't doing to well in the first half! they weren't far behind at the half so there was still time to come out and win! third quarter was the most frustrating  quarter i've ever watched! i was so mad and i don't even go to the school! now playing at kyle field is a very difficult thing to do seeing that it's loud and annoying the WHOLE game but you got get use to it and play your game! the fourth quarter was really exciting seeing that the came back within 5 until reggie mcneal made a 60-something yard run to seal the game! but the guys played there hearts out and the quarterback is still young and learning! i really enjoyed myself at the game and hanging out with the guys! 

so i've come to the conclusion that all fraternity guys aren't jerks and all sorority girls aren't mean! the guys in theta xi were freaking awesome and the girls in kappa kappa gamma were too! they were nice and knew how to have a great time! they don't have a care in the world and are so laid back! if i could move up there i really would b/c i love them so much! all of them...even the ones i didn't meet! the ones that came down were so nice and i'm really excited about going up there for spring break to meet the rest of them! the girls were nice and not judgemental! it was nice to get away from the drama of SFA and hang out with people that just wanna have fun! so a.c., mary, nate, danielle, sue, ashley, megan, skinney, deiter, ross, craig, cliff, myers, mcfadden, byron, dylan, beam, david, ryan, comfort, nick, frang, jerrad, and anybody else i forgot and met this weekend...thanks for the great time this weekend! i really enjoyed myself and i really hope i get to see you all again...whether it be at spring break or if you come back to dallas (you're welcome anytime...even if jerrad's not here! you can stay at my house!) 

alrighty well i got 8 hours of sleep this whole weekend so i'm going to bed! i hope everybody has a great week! the lumberjacks play this weekend (oh how i miss watching them play!) so it's time to get ready to kick some florida international but and go 5-0!!

"event","<P><FONT color=#6600cc>don't you love games that it comes down to the last few seconds, you have butterflies in your stomach, your heart's racing, and can't sit down until it's over?! well we had stressful yet exciting game #3 like that last night!&nbsp;so get this...there's six seconds left in the game.....it's all tied up and you can either a) run out the clock and go into overtime or b) try to kick a field goal from 53 yards out! okay well we're SFA and have an awesome kicker so we'll choose option b! six seconds, 53 yards out and the game riding on your shoulders...bring out Ryan Rossner! the other team calls 2 timeouts to mess with your mind and lose concentration! okay time to kick...the crowds yelling and your teammates are all on there knees praying you make it! the kick goes up....and it's good! SFA wins 24-21!! GO JACKS- 4-0!! so there you go guys that's how the game ended last night! another close one but the guys pulled an upset...again! yes we didn't play our best football but that's okay we have a week off and to work on stuff. we'll be ready for florida international to kick there butts again like last year!! we'll also move up in our ranking to #3, maybe #2! our guys are freaking awesome and i love them...all 99 of them! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>alright we won know it's time to celebrate! jenna, crystal, jessica and i all go back to jessica's to get ready! we decided on lumberyard since everybody said that's the place to go! well boy they were wrong! nobody was really there..very disappointing and a waste of money! i think&nbsp;we had more fun driving&nbsp;back to jessica's from the game and&nbsp;dancing in the car!&nbsp;we left early and went driving around looking for something else to do b/c we all were excited about maybe staying out untl 5 am...well around 2 we were tired and headed back to the house. you would think after a win like that there would be tons of things going on...especially in nac! we have homecoming weekend to stay out that late b/c that's gonna be an awesome weekend!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>so i've come to the realization that i'm not going to california unless one of two things happen...1)daddy/somebody buys me a ticket there or 2) one of the football players stuff me in there suitcase! seeing that neither one of those will probably happen i'm just not gonna go! i'll just stay here and listen to the game on the radio and then go celebrate the win with them when they get back! it's no fun not being here when they're already back in town and you're not leaving till the next day! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>so today is going to be an awesome day no matter what! on my way to church i was driving through the new raguet apartments and</FONT><FONT color=#6600cc>&nbsp;who do i see but my favorite football player- #14!! we got to talk for a second but we were both on our way to church! yes he was going to church! it made my day! i don't know who or what is having this good influence on him but i love it! so that just made my day! i still miss him! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>okay well it's a gorgeous day so i'm gonna go do some reading for class by the ag pond! i hope everybody has a great week! i'm going to austin and college station with jerrad and the rest of theta xi boys for the k-state/a&amp;m game (go wildcats)! it's gonna be a great weekend! </FONT></P>

"event","okay so today so far has been long! i went to the school and played with the kids which was fun! so get this...i'm leaving and a little girl (eden) comes in to go potty! well she's walking around with this picture and i tell her to put it in her box! she then goes to pull out her purse and i ask her what she's doing! she proceeds to tell me that she needs to take her medicine so i ask the teacher and come to find out this medicine she has to take is captain crunch...yes the cereal! it was pretty cute that she tried! she's a smart little three year old! the kids are so much fun and well i'm enjoying my new major!

so today i was talkiing to ryan smith and he asked if i was going to california! now that i think about it i really wanna go to the game! it's not until the 16th of october and i know the next weekend is austin/san marcos! but i  mean come on...a trip to california! it would be a blast! so i'm gonna work my magic and see what i can do about this trip! so if anybody has any ideas or wants to buy a ticket and go just let me know!!

on another note...i've done some thinking lately! now i know that i've said i've wanted to move on from, we'll call him #14. now i've come to the realization that i'm a forgiving person and no matter what somebody does to me i'm gonna forgive them in the long run. life is too short to hold grudges! also recently things have been going good for us...on the friendship side! i think everything will actually be okay as long as i'm strong and don't give in to his sweet nothings! we're gonna run into each other all the time whether it be on campus or at social events. i can't run the other way everytime i see him coming or avoid him all together b/c that's just not gonna be fun! so here i am saying yes i'm going to be friends with #14 (not like i ever stopped!) i understand some of you will be upset and not happy but i just can't hate him or dislike him greatly! so since i'm forgiving him all of you should too! :-)

alright on that note...i fell much better getting that off my chest! i'm gonna go take a nap b/c apparently i look really bad! seriously...if somebody says you look really tired why don't they say ""hey you look like crap!"" that's what they're trying to say anyways...so stop beating around the bush!!

"event","so i know it's a day late but HAPPY BIRTHDAY TESSA AND JESSICA! i celebrated their birthday's with them so that's all that counts! so yesterday was pretty fun! the fun all started when me and lynsie decided we wanted to decorate the room! so off to walmart to buy stuff! we bought streamers, balloons, cake, and party favors! it was quite exciting decorating! so anywho...we go to our night class which is pretty fun in itself! we wore our birthday hats and even gave one to the teacher!! it was fun! after class we went to chick fila with our horns making noise and having fun!

let the fun start: we went to casa ole where tessa got to order her first drink as a 21 year old! she was pretty excited about the whole thing! they sang and all that hoopla! we then went driving past the intramural fields blowing our horns and tessa yelled out the window..""it's my birfday!"" yes she said exactly that! don't worry guys she's not drunk...yet! we then went to find birthday girl #2! we went into steen making noise and to take pictures..which will be posted later! after that we proceeded to chili's for the birthday girls to buy their own drinks as 21 year olds! it was fun...the waiter even wore a hat!! 

after that there was more driving and and noise making! we then went to tammy's for the birthday party! we sat around socializing and having fun! we left early due to test and work early in the morning. mark came to visit us when we got back and well...you'll just have to ask tessa for the rest of the details...it was her birthday!! too bad jason didn't come strip for us..he missed out on ALOT!! 

on another good note....SFA lumberjack football team is ranked #4 in division 1-AA!! they are amazing and i'm VERY proud of all of them! i was talking to some of them and telling them good game against iowa and they said thanks for coming! they noticed i was there! they are now trying to get me to come to the game in california!! i so want to go but i doubt a)there will be a bus going and b)i don't think daddy's gonna buy me a ticket even though that would be AWESOME! other than that though i'll be at all the other away games!! crystal got off work so me, her, and jenna are gonna be roadtripping it to austin/san marcos for football, parties, old friends, and maybe even some shopping at the outlet mall! man the anticipation is killing me!! 

alrighty well i'm going to bed b/c i'm EXTREMELY tired! it's been a long day and apparently i look like crap so i'm gonna catch some zzzzz's! i hope everybody had a wonderful day!!

"event","so take away the really annoying girl who knows NOTHING about football and the what took forever ride home and well this trip was very successful!

for those of you who don't know sfa did beat northern iowa 24-21! now this game was rather exciting kinda like last weeks! it went back and forth for the last few minutes but what would you expect from 2 ranked teams! 

the trip up wasn't so bad because we traveled mostly at night. then when we woke up we stopped for breakfast and only had 3 hours! jenny and miranda went so the trip was more enjoyable since i had somebody to talk to. when we got to cedar falls we had time to walk around campus and stuff. the campus was really pretty, even though there was really nothing around except barns and cornfields! we went looking at one of the dorms and we went into this guys room and well he told us..and i quote him..""i think y'all are the first girls ever in this room!"" okay now why would you tell us that. yes you're not the most attractive person but come on...don't make yourself look more like a nerd!

okay so to the game! we get there in time for pre-game warmup and all that jazz! the stadium is indoors and was really cool but also intimidating! that place gets really loud whenever all of their fans are cheering but we didn't let it get to us! so the guys are doing awesome through the first quarter...especially roderick palmer and braylon. every other tackle was made by one of them! anywho..we're cheering and then uni students came and sat by us. they were pretty cool and funny so we didn't bother them too much. so at the end of the first half we're winning 14-7! 

second half... we come out looking just as good as the first. even though we still haven't grasped the concept of rushing and sacking the quarterback b/c if you shut him down then you shut the rest of their game down! their offensive line did do a good job of keeping us from him but when we got in there the quarterback freaked out and well nothing got done! anywho...during the second half the uni students are sitting next to us again. i made a new friend..couldn't tell you his name but he plays basketball for the panthers and was really nice! it was fun going back in forth on who was gonna win and giving each other a hard time! i reassured him though that everything would be okay if they lost and the only thing that would happen is we would move up in rankings and they would move down! okay so the game really came down to the last 2 minutes! we scored with five minutes left...well the panthers are pretty good and responded with a touchdown which put us up by only 3! okay now time to start panicking! so there's 4 minutes left in the game...we have the ball...we do nothing. they get the ball back and bring it down the field and almost score but we caused them to fumble...even though we didn't recover that set them up for 3 down and like 20-something yards. so they snap the ball and don't do much and that sets them up for 4th down! wel the kicker comes out to attempt a field goal and well he misses! the game is over as we know it! there's 2 minutes left and all we have to do is run down the clock and that's exactly what we do! alrighty sfa moves up to 3-0!!

so i don't know about you but i hate when i go to games and people scream things and have NO IDEA what they're talking about! this girl at the game was screaming high-pitched the whole game! it was very annoying and nerve recking b/c she didn't know what she was yelling. she was just the echo of what her mom was yelling. and another thing when the refs throw flags they do it for a reason not b/c they're bored but well b/c somebody did something against the rules! and why complain when they call 2 calls on us and the other 20 on the other team! if you don't know what you're talking about then don't say anything to make yourself look stupid! anywho...me and the no name basketball player had fun talking about her! so was quite annoying! 

well the trip back seemed like forever but hey it was well worth it! we came back with a win and still undefeated so i'm not really complaining! plus it was all for free!! for all of you whom i invited to go with me you should have b/c it was a blast and a once in a lifetime trip! well i hope everybody had a great weekend! i'm gonna go rest now so talk to you all later!

until later:

"event","so today has been very exciting! so i wake up feeling like crap get ready and go eat breakfast with lynsie and carrie! well they inform me of a bus going to iowa for the football game! i don't believe them but flip through the pinelog and well they're right! so i get all excited and start calling people to see who wants to go! i've made up my mind i'm going regardless of who's with me! i talk to jessica williams and she's all excited and wants to go too! so i call the ticket people and sign us up! SCORE- 20 hour roadtrip to waterloo, iowa for the football game! so y'all are probably thinking i'm crazy for doing this but you have to understand i really love the football team (all 90 something of them including creepy massage guy and yes, even #14)! i called my mom she's concerned b/c i called her last night sick and now this morning i call her telling i'm going to iowa! she just laughed!

so i bailed on a&m this weekend(sorry carrie i still love you!) to do homework and i wind up on a bus to iowa! crazy how things work! i'll still do my homework b/c it is 20 hours there and back! so if nobody has anything to do feel free to call me b/c well i'll be on the bus still!

on another exciting note....today is melissa's 18th birthday! so happy birthday lil sis! be careful and don't do anything i wouldnn't do! i love you and i hope you're having fun in missouri! 

well i'm gonna go rest so i'm ready for this weekend and not sick the whole time! y'all have a great weekend and check back next week for pictures from iowa!!

"event","so today/tonight was freakin' awesome! i went shopping today with jenna and that was great fun! i bought tons of cute stuff -all on sale of course!

the game was pretty boring up until the last few minutes! now you have to understand..this party is riding on whether pete has a good birthday or not! so northern arizona ties the game with like four minutes left! well we come back and try and score before time runs out...well that doesn't happen! so then we go into overtime! we score and so that gives northern arizona the ball! well our awesome defense keeps them from scoring and therefore we win! brent was in town and that was just exciting in itself b/c i've really missed him! 

alright so tonight....we go to pete's birthday party! at first it was alright- a couple of cops show up and tell us to move our cars! no big deal! well then all the football players and other people start showing up! it was crazy but great fun! we're socializing, meeting new people, having a great time! well then the cops show back up and break it up! 

well me, jessica, crystal, and jenna aren't ready to go home so we go visit keldrick (the party pooper!) he's tired, we're hungry so we call everybody...and i mean everybody..to take us to i-hop! no takers so we go to whataburger! 

well we run into my favorite person again...we already saw him at the party! well he acts like he doesn't even know me! i don't know what i've done to him but i don't deserve to be treated like crap! i was nothing but good to him for however long we talked! 

i'm home now after going and driving and letting off steam! i'm really upset and don't know what to do! i need to just talk to him and tell him how i feel and tell him it's over but.....it's not that easy! just wish me luck that we get everything worked out and i move on b/c apparently...rumor has it that there's other guys that want me! (who would've thought?!)

well i'm going to bed! y'all have a great week and i'll talk to you later!

"event","so i'm finally connected to the outside world! it took forever but we got it done!

so anywho- i just wanna say thanks to everybody who got me through last week- tessa, jessica, lynsie, jenna, anna, and anybody else! for those of you who don't know it was a crazy, emotional week! lots of things were found out, things that i guess were good to find out even though it hurt, but hey i'm moving on! so for everybody out there...there is no more kat and braylon! we had a great time whenever we spent time together for the year and so many months but i guess all good things come to an end! also word of advice: don't always believe everything you're told! so i'm moving on and it'll take some time but i'll be a-ok! 

so today is lumberjack football day! i'm very excited b/c i love college football especially SFA football! we play northern arizona and since we're both ranked it should be a very good game! the jacks will come out on top of course! after that we're partying for some guy on the football team...it's his birthday! happy birthday pete! 

well there's really nothing else so until later:

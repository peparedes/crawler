"event","Since the time I was 15, theres always been one thing i believed in. You know, love is temporary and more often than not seems to bring more pain than it does joy, family can be highly overrated, but true friendship is strong, and lasts forever. But.. certain recent events are causing me to question this. I've always valued friendship over everything else. Of course, you have to be a friend to have friends, and ive always tried to be the best friend that I could be, and ive always thought that my friends would do the same for me, and their other friends.

Was I wrong to feel this way? Have I been wrong all this time? When one friend betrays the other, even if they claim to have their reasons.. What do you say to someone like that? They turn their back on their friend for petty reasons and grudges.. Friendship obviously doesn't mean that much to them.  Even if you pretend that nothings wrong, how can you ever look at them the same again? And how do you know that they wouldn't do the same to you, if they haven't cut their ties already? This only makes my decision to stick to videogames that much stronger. In the words of a wise man, ""I'm getting too old to be this naive.."""

"event","Way back when fighting games first came out, I started playing them just like everyone else. They didnt hold my interest for long, since I didnt really have any game playing friends to compete with, and soon I was just ignoring them in favor of RPGs and stuff. I didnt really think of them as fun anymore.

Until now.

Recently, I went and got Soul Calibur III, in the interest of giving myself more variety (and because it looked pretty interesting at an anime con I went to late last year). Oh holy CRAP on a stick, this game is awesome! Its got lots of characters, with cool looking weapons, many different gameplay modes, and a TON of unlockable stuff and things you can purshase in stores! Not to mention the create-a-character mode is a fanboy/girls dream come true! 

I didnt think that a fighting game could hook me like this, but it has. My expenrience with this game has actually made me think twice about my opinons on fighting games, and made me want to check out some more of them! Again, this game is freakin' awesome! ^_^"

"event","Valentines day.

I think a friend of mine said it best:

SakuraLuv: 	>ehem<  Curse those Whos down in Whoville... they are always so noisy.  all that crap about ""Oooooh, Valentines, I think I'll spend 30 bucks on chocolate or else my GF won't love me no more""
SakuraLuv: 	""I'm gonna guilt my man into spending 80 bucks on a Teddy Bear. Ooooooooh""
SakuraLuv: 	::puts on a hat with a heart design with an X on it::
SakuraLuv: 	Behold!  I am the Pooka what will steal Valentines!  and then, just to prevent them from getting all mushy and stuff... I chall use... THIS!
SakuraLuv: 	::pulls out a REALLY large Cupid bow:: I shall launch this Lovey Atom bomb!  BWAHAHAHAHAAAAA
SakuraLuv: 	::bes the embodiment of Pooka Valentines-rage::

Seriously, is this what weve come to? What is t he big deal about Valentines Day? For all of the wonderful things we hear about love, youd think it would amount to more than just buying someone jewelry.. 

Society always puts everything in terms of material worth, and everybody just buys into this. But then, romance as we know it today is a sham. Love never lasts forever, It NEVER does, no matter what you may think at the time.. and then you break up,and all you have is pain. Ive seen it happen to my friends WAY too often. Its stupid, and totally not worth it.

Besides, I for one would much rather have something fun,like a video game or a book, than jewelry or stuffed animals anyday."

"event","Ok, yesterday was just horrible. Some history.. every Wednesday night, I spend the night bagging newspapers, then I spend Thursday morning delivering them. Well,it wasnt gonna be a picnic doing all that with a hurt shoulder. I took a pain pill before i left to deliver yesterday,and then I did it again about a little over 3 and a half hours later. I was supposed to wait 4 hours. we were eating lunch, and then went back to work.. first I was in a very good mood, due to just having eaten and not feeling the pain as much.. it didnt last. By the time I was done with my work I was drowsy,headachey,and most of all, sick to my stomach. Seriously, I felt like i was gonna throw up.. And it pretty much lasted the whole night, too, since riding in a car made it worse.

And that, Giarc, is why I wasnt on FFXI last night :p"

"event","Well, I just got back from Sugoicon 2005! and man, was it the MOST fun ive hadin a long time! i LOVE anime conventions! :D

<lj-cut>Ranko15:  well,first off, my sister and her boyfriend bowed out at the LAST POSSIBLE MINUTE   
 Ranko15:  leaving me with my dad and my weird biker uncle and his giant parrot   
 Ranko15:  and they torturned me with cheesy oldies and mowtown the entire way down there (even as i type this my spleen and liver are melted away and my pancreas is half gone)   
 Ranko15:  on  the way down there, we stopped at some truck stop, so i was checking out the game room   
 SakuraLuv:  Aiya!  not the pancreas! 
 Ranko15:  yep..my pancreas   
 Ranko15:  so anyway,i was in the gameroom, and there was this one game where you create a horse and race it,and then its printed onto this little card that you take with you everywhere you go   
 Ranko15:  and one of the machines still had 2 credits on it that some guy put in and never used   
 Ranko15:  it was just sitting there,begging me to play   
 Ranko15:  so i played   
 Ranko15:  now i have my own horse card ^_^   
 SakuraLuv:  kickin 
 Ranko15:  so then we get to the con, and find out that caps not gonna be there for another few hours, they had to make a detour in Cleveland (but im sure Cap will tell you all about that,so i dont need to)   
 Ranko15:  so i run to the dealer room and do my routine check for the import game booth (if they have anything really good,i kinda wanna get there before its sold out)   
 Ranko15:  and i wind up buying A SWORD   
 SakuraLuv:  hmm... what... KIND of sword I wonder 
 Ranko15:  it wasnt full-sized,more like a mini sword   
 Ranko15:  but still a sword!   
 Ranko15:  it was just like outta the middle ages!   
 SakuraLuv:  ""I Like Swords!"" 
 Ranko15:  oooh,no you dont   
 Ranko15:  no comparing me to fighter   
 Ranko15:  i admit,i think swords are cool,but i have brains!   
 SakuraLuv:  heee >^_^< 
 SakuraLuv:  is okay 
 SakuraLuv:  I still have mega-nerdy Lightsaber collection stuff 
 SakuraLuv:  and I really want to get this new one that's out... 
 SakuraLuv:  a modular creat-your-own set 
 Ranko15:  so anyway, Cap finally shows up at around 10,we trade stuff,and..er...uh oh   
 Ranko15:  i just remembered something   
 Ranko15:  he still has my shonen jump!! ;_;   
 SakuraLuv:  KILL! 
 Ranko15:  i lent it to him so he could read it,and i guess with all the stuff happening,he forgot to bring it back.. ;_;   
 Ranko15:  so anyway, the next day was just one big party   
 Ranko15:  where among other things,i bought a Fire Emblem game for my game boy, much Naruto, Tekken and Soul Calibur was played,and i was introduced to the most messed up anime i have ever seen   
 SakuraLuv:  Bobobo-bo bobobb? 
 Ranko15:  no   
 Ranko15:  worse than that   
 Ranko15:  and much less humorous   
 SakuraLuv:  eep? 
 Ranko15:  YES   
 Ranko15:  for i speak of none other than...   
 Ranko15:  ELFIN LIED!   
 SakuraLuv:  ::cocks head:: eh? 
 Ranko15:  you may not want to know   
 SakuraLuv:  tell me! 
 Ranko15:  ok...youve seen Akira,right?   
 SakuraLuv:  of course, who hasn't? 
 Ranko15:  you remember the scene where Tetsuo escapes and  destroys everyone in his path on the way to the little kids room?   
 Ranko15:  imagine that, only with 10 times the blood and gore, and change Tetsuo to a naked girl   
 SakuraLuv:  ::blink:: whoa 
 Ranko15:  you see a security guy get totally gutted and his freakin HEART lands on another guys lap just before THAT guy gets his head torn off   
 Ranko15:  from seemingly out of nowhere   
 SakuraLuv:  ouch 
 Ranko15:  and that girl winds up going from THAT, to a pet cat-girl who cant say anything but ""mew,mew!"" and wets herself   
 Ranko15:  because of a head injury   
 Ranko15:  its just disturbing   
 SakuraLuv:  sounds like it... I'm guessing this is just a one shot, not a series? 
 Ranko15:  no   
 Ranko15:  is a series   
 SakuraLuv:  GAH! 
 SakuraLuv:  but... HOW? 
 Ranko15:  like i said, the college kid   
 Ranko15:  see,she escapes, falls into the sea, gets a head injury, and is found by this college kid and his cousin   
 Ranko15:  and his cousin,she turns out to have a crush on him    
 Ranko15:  so she kinda moves in with them   
 Ranko15:  but then,her evil side comes back   
 Ranko15:  and she sort of switches back and forth   
 Ranko15:  like a split personality   
 SakuraLuv:  wierd... so any other cool stories? 
 Ranko15:  cool?   
 Ranko15:  it just seemed so..MESSED UP to me...   
 Ranko15:  i dont exactly think of it as cool..   
 Ranko15:  anyway, nah,not really.. nothing that notable,at least   
 Ranko15:  Sunday we pretty much spent most of our time in the game room   
 Ranko15:  except for the Too Cute to Live panel   
 Ranko15:  i just BARELY lived through that   
 Ranko15:  i saw some Kingdom Hearts necklaces,but by that time i had used up my money   
 Ranko15:  it took all my willpower not to buy em ;_;   
 Ranko15:  and there were these freakin HILARIOUS T-shirts! you should have seen em!   
 Ranko15:  there was a samurai one and a bubble bobble one   
 SakuraLuv:  neat! 
 Ranko15:  and finally, we went home   
 Ranko15:  i got the motown torture all the way back,too 
 Ranko15:  not to mention, i charged up by gameboy the night before so i was prepared   
 SakuraLuv:  ouch... any other organ casualties? 
 Ranko15:  but when i pulled it out   
 Ranko15:  i found it had come on in my pocket   
 Ranko15:  and was now dead again   
 SakuraLuv:  the spleen?  maybe the sqeedeleespooge? 
 Ranko15:  dont be silly   
 SakuraLuv:  AIYEEEEE 
 Ranko15:  no HUMAN has a sqeedeleespooge 
 SakuraLuv:  I've got a sqeedeleespooge.... 
 Ranko15:  so yes,there i was, gameboyless, and with fullblast Motown pounding its way through my skull   
 SakuraLuv:  ah!  teh brainmeats! 
 Ranko15:  yes ;_;   
 SakuraLuv:  poor Ranko...  
 SakuraLuv:  liverless, pancreas-less.. and now brainmeat-less... 
 Ranko15:  its taken everything from me ;_;   
 SakuraLuv:  motown is eeeeevil</lj-cut>

I was probably the only person who liked Wall Street Kid or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom for NES when i was a kid.. Harvest Moon, Earthbound, Pokemon Snap, and Incredible Crisis are other strange games that got my attention. And there are some very strange games that can come out from Japan. Unfortently,the only American system that can play Japanese games is the Gameboy/Color/Advance.. plus you have to know Japanese.. so the best i can do is read about them. These are just an example of what im talking about!

"event","Yeah,so I was in the middle of a PS2 Everquest addiction, then I got a Gameboy Advance SP dropped in my lap, and decided to test it out with Golden Sun, which I could not put down at all until I finished it..then Gamecube Zelda comes out and shows up on my lap unexpectedly...suddenly being a gamer has become a full-time job. And yes, I have put my long-standing hatred of the Gamecube Link to rest, thanks to Saku. Plus, i finally have a PS2 keyboard! Now nothing stands in the way of my EQOA joy. 
I cant help but notice that Cindi's depressed.. I wanna call her sometime, but its trickier to do it now because we dont have long distance anymore, meaning I have to use a special phone card."

But today I played one of my FF9 music CDs while eating lunch.. Melodies of Life in Japanese, English and instrumental, and listening to it made me start to cry..I forgot how beautiful that song was. I wasnt even feeling down at the time, but I still started crying.. maybe I should take a break from Everquest and play through FF9 again, because I feel like playing it now."

"event","Ok,this has to be said...PS2 Everquest is the GREATEST!! ive been playing it for days, and i pretty much have the hang of the different controls. Ive even set up multiple characters across different servers. Ive tried making characters in different places so i can learn my way around them all, in case one of my main characters has to do some serious traveling..otherwise ill wind up lost. Its so easy to get lost in this game! Luckily, theres a system set up so that once you get to a new town, you can go to the local stable and sign a ledger, so that you can get there and back quickly. Its good to explore, though, you never know what you might find..i found this cool Stonehedge-type place a few times, it was so neat. I really recommend this game to anyone with a PS2, especially RPG fans!

Oh,and by the way..in .hack, there is this one EVIL dungeon that is a PAIN to try to tackle, ive been in there 4 times, and ive died each time. If you play this game, and you get an in-game email from a character named Mia, telling you to come to a dungeon alone....RUN!"

Aside from a few snags I hit setting up the Network Adapter and getting signed on and set up, I was able to get on and play an MMORPG for the first time in my life! Its all pretty cool, and ive already made some new friends, but theres just one little problem..I didnt get a keyboard for it,and its like slow torture trying to type things out without one,even WITH all the practice I got playing Animal Crossing! Oh well... 

On to the bad news, as of now,I dont have a job anymore. The resturaunt where I worked has gone out of business, and will soon be replaced by a barbeque place.. I picked up my last check today. But when I was in there the other day,and I saw them taking things down,and packing them up and out.. I just felt like crying. Ive been working there for 3 years, and seeing it like that just got to me... *sniff*"

"event","I have been spending the past week or so involved in beating the N64 Zelda games...both of them, back to back..and not just beating them, but completely mastering them. So far, im succeding, and have done lots of things that I can brag about later. 

There are a few things that catch my interest, though, especially with Majoras Mask. Since it uses the Expansion pak, its way bigger and more complex than Ocarina of Time. In OoT, there were shortcuts and things.. like all the dead-end doors in Hyrule market,or Zoras domain never unfreezing. Not Majoras Mask, every door leads somewhere, different things happen at different times of day, theres a lot more detail everywhere, inside and out, and the plot and character development is through the roof. 

I roleplay a lot, so I especially like the attention to detail. All the rooms have lots of little objects in them that make it easy to imagine what it would be like to actually live/work/play/whatever there. It would actually be nice to live in Termina, if the place were real. Another thing that i like is the Milk Bar. Its basically a bar that serves alcoholic milk, and its got this whole big cow theme.. the idea of alcoholic milk is really strange, but I think its neat.

Another point of coolness about this game is the masks. All the masks have a particular power or purpose, some of them are only good for one kind of situation, others come in handy all through the game. a few masks even change you into different forms. the ones I thought were the coolest though, were the Zora mask, the Romani cow mask, that shows your a member of the milk bar, the Stone mask,that lets you slip past anyone unnoticed, and the Bunny mask, that doubles your speed.."

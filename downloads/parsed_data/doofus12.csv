"event","A meme that I stole from Kate:

1. Pick 15 of your favourite movies.
2. Go to IMDb and find a quote from each movie.
3. Post them here for everyone to guess.
4. Strike it out when someone guesses correctly, and put who guessed it and the movie.
5. NO GOOGLING/using IMDb search functions.

1. 'What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella '

2. 'You poor simple fools. Thinking you could defeat me, *me*! The Mistress of All Evil! Well, here's your precious princess! '

3. 'All right, if the applicant is young, tell him he's too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat. If the applicant then waits for three days without food, shelter, or encouragement he may then enter and begin his training. '

4.'Wait, you know Superman? I think I'm feeling something here... Are you aware of Garfield?'

5. 'I'm a full-time dad. I'm a working parent. I'm a mother and a father. I'm a guy who reads parenting books and cookbooks before I go to sleep. I spend my weekends buying tutus. I'm learning to sew. I'm Mr. Napkin Head! '

6. 'Yeah, well, the difference is you're still sickeningly handsome, whereas I look increasingly like my Aunt Mildred. '

7. 'Take off your clothes, just like we do at bath time. You too, Evan. '

8. 'I can treat that jackass like any other faceless groom! And that's just what I'm gonna do! Why? Because he's nothing... because I love a challenge! And because I am a goddamn professional! '

9. 'I see angels, Mickey. They're comin' down for us from heaven. And I see you ridin' a big red horse, and you're driving them horses, whippin' 'em, and the're spitting and frothing all 'long the mouth, and the're coming right at us. And I see the future, and there's no death, 'cause you and I, we're angels...'

10. 'After all... I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. '

11. 'No more training do you require. Already know you, that which you need.'

12. 'We cannot. We belong to two opposing sides. If we meet again... one of us will have to die. '

13. 'I'm ten years old. My life is half over and I don't even know if I'm black with white stripes or white with black stripes! '

14. 'This is all they're really doing here, isn't it? They're just biding time until SOMEBODY proposes! '

15. 'I don't want to be original, Matty, I want to be cool.'"

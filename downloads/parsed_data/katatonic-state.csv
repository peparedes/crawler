"event","One of my big goals for Post Road is to grow them into a bigger chorus.  Ultimately, I want 80 - 100 singers, but I know that isn't going to happen overnight.  Right now, we're hovering around 25, so my goal between now and May (contest) is 35 - 40.  If we do well at contest, it'll make our job easier recruiting new singers.

Last night, we auditioned a new (fabulous) singer and she passed with flying colors.  Last week's guest night brought three potential singers in -- one of which came back this week who's really gung ho to join.  And we have a third singer that came a few weeks ago that is getting geared up for the audition.  All of them are young -- last night's auditionee is younger than me, in fact!!! -- and have great voices.  

It's very exciting to watch the chorus grow!!"

1st Congregational Church of Shrewsbury presents

The Music of Godspell

Saturday, November 15, 2008 at 7pm.

Tickets: $10 per individual or $25 per family.
(Note: There will be a childcare room, so if you're unsure if your kid can sit through the whole thing, there will be a safe place for your kids to go run around.  Our church has several women who are fantastic with the kiddos).

1st Congo is at the corner of Main St and Rt 140 in the center of Shrewsbury.

And no, we're not doing the whole show -- just the majority of the music.  We have a kickin' band and a great group of singers.  Wombat's also performing in it.  It'll be a great time!  :)  I have tickets.  If you want to come and you don't see me before the 15th, let me know and I'll make sure there are tickets on reserve for you at the door.  Oh.  And we're going to have desserts and goodies.

AND...

If you're interested in hearing my chorus, we're performing for Simon Malls One Night of Giving.  We'll be at the Solomon Pond Mall on Sunday, November 23rd from 7 - 9pm.  We'll be doing 30 minute sets down near Macy's (I think).  Tickets for this event are $10 -- some of this money goes to my chorus and some of it goes to the Simon Kids Charity.  The ticket enters you into some sort of raffle and if presented at the stores that night, you'll get discounts.  Again, I've got tickets if you want on -- unfortunately, I don't think I can put them on reserve at the door, so if you show up that night, you're on your own.  (I doubt this will be an issue since it's not like there are a limited number of seats or something...)  :)"

Hey all you closet (or not-so-closet) musicians out there!  I'm in need of your help.  I know I've made mention of an upcoming (music of) Godspell production I'm involved in on November 15th.  We're putting together a kickin' band to back up the singers.  Unfortunately, the person we thought we had lined up to be our bassist can't do it, so we're trying to find a last minute replacement.

There is a rehearsal this afternoon -- Saturday, Oct 25th, 3-5pm -- in Shrewsbury.  There will be a few other rehearsals between now and the 15th -- most of these are to be deteremined.  (Today is the first day we'll have the band together, so we'll figure it out then).  The only one that's set in stone is Friday, November 14th at 6pm -- this is our dress rehearsal.  The show is Sat 11/15 at 7pm (5pm call).  

If you're interested -- even if you can't make today's rehearsal -- please get in touch with me ASAP.  Either email KatatonicState (at) gmail (dot) com (or you can Google Talk me) or call me - 774 239 1512.  If you can make today's rehearsal -- even better!  And, of course, if you aren't musically inclined, but know someone who is, then by all means give them my info.

This is a fundraiser and we're trying to do this with all volunteers if possible.  My director of music can hire a professional if needs be (and will do so if it comes to it), but would prefer to save the cash.  So, compensation would be my undying gratitude -- which could include things like baked goodies, beer, and/or lunch or dinner on me.  :)"

If you enjoy singing and want to learn how to better your sound and technique, then you might want to consider taking lessons.

Here's the info:
I teach at the First Congregational Church in Shrewsbury.  (The corner of Rt. 140 and Main St - the big white church on the town green).  I offer hour lessons at $35/hour (or $30/hour for fulltime students).  I am happy to work with any age -- junior high or older.  My services range from coaching / prep for some event (one-time or a set period of time) to general weekly/bi-weekly voice lessons for beginning and intermediate students.  For those wishing to study with me (not just get some specific coaching), the first lesson is an evaluation of where you're at and is therefore free.  (It's not an audition, so don't be intimidated!)  Current students who successfully refer me to a new student receive a free lesson after the new student's 4th lesson.

You can find the petition at
http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/organizationsORG/momsrising/signUp.jsp?key=2362

THE LOWDOWN: CPSC is an under-funded agency with an outdated
regulatory authority. It needs the resources and authority to keep our
children safe. It's time to pass legislation to make sure CPSC can do
its job to keep dangerous products out of our homes. Congress can take
several steps to keep children safe:
1) Give real teeth and authority to CPSC to keep toxics out of toys
and set firm toxic limits (since there are only guidelines now);
2) Create a third-party testing system and increase the fines for
those companies who put toxics in toys;
3) Fully fund the CPSC, which has had a stagnant budget since 2005, so
it can enforce the laws;
4) Increase staffing at CPSC since their current staffing is at its
lowest level since the 1980s;
5) Give authority to quickly release safety warnings about imminent
hazards without manufacture approval.

Two recently introduced bills in the Senate propose to do just this.
Let's make sure that Congress hears our strong support for this
legislation. Our children need safe products NOW.

PASS IT ON--KEEP TOXICS AWAY FROM KIDS: Can you think of any list you
have not yet posted this petition on? Any friends who have been
sneaking into their children's rooms late at night to confiscate that
special Big Bird toy? Get them involved and pass the petition on so we
can get as many signers as possible!"

"event","...you say, ""I expended all my MP wrestling the sage plant...""  I have a beautiful sage plant.  It decided that the Mint in the herb garden was a little hard to take, so it relocated itself.  It managed to work it's way out of the garden by growing in the narrow space where two of the railroad ties that border the garden meet.  The (substantial) root was almost completely under the tie that's actually bolted down.  Using a pry bar, Wombat was able to pull that tie up enough for me to wrestle the plant free - I managed to keep a good bit of the root intact and we didn't destroy the railroad tie.  The Sage is now back where it used to be before it's big move.  Here's hoping it survives.  I also got the rest of the herbs that I have planted/moved this morning.  I realized that while I still have a ways to go, things are starting to look really good.  This weekend, I hope to buy everything else I need so I can just be done with the big stuff and start focussing on smaller things that I want to clean-up, etc.

We finally have a space to hold an organizational meeting for our theater group.  I'll post here with the details in the next day or so.  (I'll be posting all over creation, in fact).

Wombat's step-dad (the MIL's husband) called this morning and left a message while we were outside.  He sounded beleaguered and asked Wombat to call him this afternoon.  Sounds like it's time to sit down and discuss things.  Ah, the passive-agressive life: have your husband deal with that which offends you.  (When she's pissed, Wombat's step-dad is always the one to call us about it.  Whatever - I like dealing with him because he's reasonable and understands a heckuva lot more about what's going on than the MIL ever gives him credit for)."

This morning, I cleaned out my Mint...err... Herb Garden.  My gardens are in surprisingly ok shape this year given that they received little attention last summer.  The worst garden is my herb garden.  For some reason, the summer before last, it was neglected.  (I can't remember the reason, but it was).  The mint and lemon balm took over and killed off everything else except for the chives.  Today, I took a shovel to it and dug it all out.  What's left are a nice clump of chives and a cone flower.  I have no idea where that Cone Flower came from, but it's there and it looks nice.  Tomorrow, the cone flower will be moved to it's new home and I'll plant some lavender, thyme, sage, and parsley in the garden to get it going.  This weekend, I'll buy more parsley, basil, oregano, and rosemary (to go into a container that lives in the garden in the summer and inside in the winter).  I'm thrilled to get my herb garden back - it's great to just run outside and get what I need when I'm cooking.

I'm hoping to also get a veggie garden going this weekend.  I know it's a little late, but I haven't gotten my act together to buy containers - most of what I want to do will be in containers since I don't have a decent bed to put stuff in.  I had thought about joining a co-op, but for less than the money I'd invest doing that, I could put together my own container garden and then it'd be a minimal investment from here on out.

"event","It was a good day.  I took Ruth to church with me this morning and left Wombat at home to have some time for himself.  Church was sparsely attended today given the holiday weekend so it was a ""low pressure"" work morning.  She spent the morning playing with her friends in the nursery, so she was a happy girl.

This afternoon was spent catching up with an old friend.  The more we chatted, the more I realized that we probably have more in common now than we did 12+(!) years ago when we first met.  I'm glad he and his family are back in the area so we can hopefully see each other more than once every year or two.

And to cap off this fine day, Ruth taught her parents a very important lesson -- Fresh Cherries + Corn + 24 Hours = Stupendous Diaper.  Yowza.

Tomorrow promises to be another good one.  We'll spend the morning doing the town festivities - pancake breakfast, book sale, plant sale, whatever else they've got going on at the Common.  And then, I finally should be able to get some much needed gardening done."

"event","It's all come to a head.  And I've come to the realization that I'm spending way too much mental energy on stupid petty bullshit.  Unfortunately, I'm stuck playing someone else's game, but I don't know the rules.

<lj-cut text=""Another MIL Rant"">
Well.  That's not entirely true.  On one level, I know what motivates her.  My MIL is essentially a nice person who means well and who wants to give her granddaughter all the stuff that she was unable to provide to Wombat when he was a kid.  I get that.  The problem is this -- she has her own perception/reality that she lives in and she's built a very healthy fantasy of what the role of Grandma is.  Only she's not letting anyone - namely us - in on what her World View is.  This has caused no end of trouble and Thurs. night, it blew up in our faces.  Yes, that's right, my MIL and I got into a shouting match in front of Ruth.  Not one of our finest moments.

The straw that broke the camel's back was Ruth's birthday where my MIL decided to ignore a few simple requests that I had for gifts and buy whatever she wanted.  My requests?  Consult with us for large-size items.  For those of you who've been to my house, you know my house is small and has a tremendous amount of stuff in it already.  I wouldn't necessarily shoot down a large present, but I want to make sure that I can make the space for it and that it's something Ruth will enjoy and use.  I also asked to forego buying stuffed animals.  Ruth isn't interested in them and they're taking up space that could be better used for stuff she does play with.  (She has a TON of stuffed animals already thanks mostly to the MIL).  What did she give Ruth for her birthday?  A large stuffed animal (""She'll use it as a floor pillow."") and one of those IKEA pod chairs, plus some random other junk that probably won't get much use.  At least the random stuff is small.

This may seem trivial - and if it were an isolated incident it would be - but this isn't the first time in the last 1 year and 9 months that she's taken our requests and and done the exact opposite of them.  It's like whatever we say is optional - if doesn't fit into her world view of what Grandma means, it can be ignored.  On the otherhand, if it's something she wants, it isn't optional - The Crib Incident is a perfect example of that.  There's no saying no to her and if you try to push back, then you're disrespectful.  This applies for everything -- matters concerning us, but even moreso matters concerning Ruth.

To add insult to injury, she's in a one-sided competition with my mother.  (No - my mother ain't playing).  This weekend, Ruth was also baptized.  My mom made the dress she wore.  My MIL was pretty bent of shape that she didn't get to purchase the dress, so ""Here.  I bought this cross instead.""  (Said with a very snarky tone implying my mother one-upped her and pissed all over her grand design).  Thankfully, Ruth wore the cross without fussing with it - if I had been able to get it on her, it would have been my fault that my daughter likes to play with jewelry.  And yes, I've had many snarky comments about my mother lobbed in my general direction as of late.

And then there are the gifts that aren't really the gifts.  For example, the deck still has a few things that need to get done.  It's been on Wombat's list to do for awhile, but between work and crappy weather, it hasn't gotten done yet.  Last week, she showed up with a Home Depot gift card and when telling me why she did it, implied that we were too lazy to get off our asses to do it, so she hoped it would get us moving.  (Normally, I'm thrilled with a Home Depot card - what homeowner isn't?  This time, it was tough to smile and say thanks.)

So back to the blowup.  Thursday night, she came over for dinner and to watch Ruth while Wombat and I went to choir rehearsal.  Shortly after supper, I find her in the family room with Ruth trying to get her to play with the aforementioned stuffed animal.  Ruth, as predicted, didn't care.  I said (as gently as I could) that it would be something she'd grow into.  (I refrained from an ""I told you so"").  At which point, she started yelling at me.  And I yelled back.  I then suggested that she leave before things got worse.  (On her way out the door, Wombat got an earful about what a disrespectful ingrate I am).

Am I an ingrate?  Maybe.  I do look the Gift Horse in the mouth.  She inundates us with tons of stuff - much of which isn't useful to us.  (Sharper Image Coffee Bean Vacuum Urn, anyone?)  We can't get rid of it because she gets upset.  We can't give it back because she gets upset.  (And it is kinda rude).  And it's just stuff - meaningless, bought-on-the-spur-of-the-moment-without-any-thought-for-the-sake-of-buying-you-something stuff.  I've gotten so many Gift Horses that I could open my own Gift Horse Farm.  And between the snarky presentation of many of the ""gifts"" as well as the blatant disregard of our needs/wishes/etc, it feels like they're more of a means of control and ""I'll show you"" than a way to show affection.  I say Thank You, but often times it's a bit on the hollow side.  It's tough to be happy to recieve something if it's presented in an insulting manner.  (Note:  The stuff that I am happy about, I tend to show a ton of enthusiasm - and perhaps the fact that I'm not praising every single piece of crap/gesture at the same high level is part of the problem).

Do I respect her?  I thought long and hard about this since the blow up and the answer is no.  It's a two-way street and let's just say that I'm not feeling the love and haven't for a long time.  In fact, it's gotten worse since Ruth was born and some of our ""earthy-crunchy"" choices have gotten in her way as Grandma.  (Note that this isn't actually true, but I think she believes it is).   I reach out to her time and again and I'm met with suspicion and/or snarky remarks.  She's even got her parents commenting about my supposed bad behavior.  I try to fake it - play nice for the sake of Ruth, and recently I've been falling down on the job.  She gets snarky with me and I get snarky back.  I know this isn't helping the situation, but I'm only human and I've been grinning and bearing some of this bullshit for years.  Since I became pregnant, it's taken on a whole new life of it's own and I'm to the point that I can't ignore it.  Even when she's on her best behavior, there are times that I can bearly tolerate her - just too much as been said and done.  This only fuels my snarky tone.

I try to understand her perspective and cut her a lot of slack.  I also know my personality foibles - and my ""no bullshit"" approach to life tends to not play nice with those that like to play games (intentionally or not).  I've worked hard at sugar-coating stuff for her and biting my tongue.  Given this isn't my nature (for better or for worse), I feel I've done a decent job at this until recently.  

For Ruth's sake, I need to fix this.  I just have no idea how.  No matter what approach I take with my MIL - and I've tried many over the 11+ years that Wombat and I've been together - it doesn't work.  (Or it's fine for awhile and then things fall apart again).  This has been the worse incident - I'm sure because there's more at stake for her than in the past.  Short of me not saying anything and letting her dictate how and when things get done - this includes how we manage our lives as well as how we raise Ruth (no exaggeration), I don't see her being happy.  I'm sure at some point soon very soon, she and I will sit down and attempt to work this out.  I hope we can be open and listen to what each other's saying.  Given the tone on Thurs night was that of a mother talking to her teenager who refuses to do what she's told, I suspect that ""hearing each other"" isn't going to happen.  Perhaps I'm just a pessimist.

And that concludes my Mental Purge.   Here's hoping I can stop focusing on it and get back to my Regularly (ha!) Scheduled Life."

I worked (sang) a funeral this weekend for a gentleman who apparently died after some illness.  He died relatively young - early 60's - and had spent the last 120 days of his life in a hospital.  He had a large family that took up 6 rows of pews in the church.  His younger brother gave the eulogy.

I'm working with a couple of folks who are looking to develop a new community theater in the Shrewsbury area.  We're looking at an MWRep-style of management - that is, we want to create a community of theater enthusiasts who want to share in the production of a show.  Like MW, we'll create a system of democratically choosing what shows get done.  If things take off like we hope, the system might be completely different than MW in that we may need to plan a season or two ahead for funding/grant purposes, but we want the community to drive this rather than one guy-in-charge.  Also, like MW, we want to give people a chance to try new stuff.  With this said, as we develop this idea, we need input to see if there's any interest.  We understand that our lives are radically different than when we were in college and had 40 hours a week to devote to whatever production was happening at the time.  We know that there are jobs, kids, houses, and other things that eat up your time at play here.  We're really interested in hearing about what your priorities and how theater could potentially fit into your life.  You can respond here or if you prefer, send me a private email with your thoughts -- KatatonicState (at) gmail (dot) com

Thanks for your input!
<lj-cut text=""Our Survey..."">

Our informal survey:

+ Are you currently participating in theater?  If so, where and what do you do with that theater?  Are you happy where you're at or are you open to trying something new?

+ If you aren't currently participating in theater...
	- In an ideal (I-have-all-the-time-in-the-world) life, does participating in theater interest you?
	- Are you unsure you have the time to participate?
	- Have you been unable to find a theater to work with?  (Don't know what's available and/or haven't found the right fit?)

+ If the idea of doing theater interests you...
	- What kind of time committment do you feel comfortable making?
	- What sorts of jobs would you be interested in doing?  Acting?  Production staff? Publicity?  Stage Mgmt?  Directing?  Tech?  House Mgmt?  Fundraising/grant writing? Something else?
	- What is your ideal theater environment?  (Remember this is community theater...)

+ For the NV playwrights who see this, one of the ideas we kicked around is to (at some point next year) do a production of one-act plays that were written by local writers.  Would you be interested in seeing your shows produced again outside the college theater environment?

+ To get us started, we're aiming to do our first production around Halloween of this year.  While we're still open to ideas at this point, ""The Crucible"" has come up as a solid possibility (with the thought of doing something Halloween-ish).  Would you be interested in being a part of this show and what capacity might you be able to help out?  (We won't hold you to your response - I'm just trying to gauge level of interest at this point).

+ Any other thoughts you'd like to share?

</lj-cut>

++ I know there's tons of folks who aren't on LJ who did theater at WPI - if you know someone who might have some ideas/interest for us, please pass this along to them.  We'd love to hear from them.  Thanks! ++"

"event","Yup.  That's right.  A breastfeeding support site was selling a T-shirt that said ""The Other White Milk"".  The Pork Industry decided that this shirt not only infringed on their well-known slogan, but it also denegrated the pork industry because the shirt and the site itself  is an ""apparent attempt to promote the use of breastmilk beyond merely for infant consumption.""

"event","Wow... Hiring a nanny without the use of an agency can be an adventure.  I posted my add to the Worcester LJ Community and to the Worcester Craigslist.  (Try for free... then move onto the avenues I'd have to pay for).  I got a ton of responses.  After wading through all the ""nannies"" who were actually moms looking to make a little money watching someone else's kid(s) while schlepping their own kids along and women who were looking for a non-retail job that pays better than minimum wage but don't have any relevant experience (except that they did a babysitting job in high school), I came up with four candidates:

Candidate #1: A resident of Boylston who has been a nanny for years.  Her last gig (which just ended) was for a set of twins.  She nannied them from age 3 months to 4 years.  The mom worked out of the home - a similar situation to our own.

Candidate #2: A woman from Oxford who has also been a nanny and/or preschool teacher for years.  Her current gig is a night nanny position and she wants to get daytime hours so she can spend more time with her 5 kids (this includes triplets... she must *really* like kids).

Candidate #3: A woman looking to make a career change.  She was tapped to sit on a Federal Grand Jury a couple of years ago -- the time committment as well as the cases she was handling forced her to quit her job. (She had previously been city planning -- a mob case she was working hit close to home, apparently -- she ended up knowing several of the people indicted through her work with various construction companies).  Her service is about up and she's trying to figure out what to do with her life.

Candidate #4: A young woman (Freshman in college) majoring in Early Childhood Development.  She's currently working for a daycare, but wants to do more one-on-one.  She's held summer nanny positions and has a list a mile long of kids she babysits/has babysat for.

We interviewed #1 and #2 last week hoping that one of them would work out.  We set up in the living room - I put a playmat in the middle of the floor with some toys and sat there with Ruth.  I wanted to see how our potential nanny interacted with her.  Candidate #2 - #4 did to varying degrees.  Candidate #1 didn't.  At all.  Scratch #1 off the list.

I wanted to hire #2.  She had some ideas as to how to handle a few minor challenges that Ruth has been presenting.  She had a warm personality and seemed like she'd be great with Ruth.  I called on Friday and left a message with her 15 year old son.  She never called me back... because she never got the message.  She emailed me late Friday (after I went to bed) saying that since she hadn't heard from me, she accepted another position.  Scratch #2 off the list.  When I called her again on Saturday, she was very apologetic, but what was done was done - can't blame her there.  I made appointments with #3 and #4 for today.

Both were great.  I really liked #3 - she seemed like a really cool person in general.  But she lacks experience.  She was tentative with Ruth, but was open to her.  I think ultimately, she'd be good with Ruth, but it'd take some guidance from me about what to do.  She was upfront about the fact that this probably would be a temporary thing.. and she's allergic to cats.  Between that and the fact that I don't really want to train a nanny, I decided that she wasn't a good fit for our needs.  Scratch #3.

#4 was AWESOME.  She was actually everything I was looking for and more.  Great personality.  Great with Ruth.  Wonderful references who think the world of her.  More experience and certifications than you can shake a stick at.  I hired her on the spot.  She starts Thursday.  In a way, #2's annoying son was a blessing in disguise.

All-in-all, it wasn't a terrible process, but not one that I'd like to do regularly.  I'm happy with the decision we made -- I think she'll work out great.  But I'm also glad <lj user = ""milknut""> is able to continue working at least on Fridays (and probably some on Monday too)."

"event","It's been awhile since I've written a Ruth update, so here goes...

Ruth is now 6.5 months old.  At her last doctor's app't, she weighed in at 16 lbs 5oz and was 26"" long.  Also, at that last doctor's app't, she get another round of vaccinations that she managed to have a nasty reaction to.  Co-sleeping with an child is great until the child pukes.  Not cool.  But she's better now.

She's now eating solids.  I started her shortly before her 6 month birthday.  She'd been very interested in food for awhile, but there was one day when her hands were in my lunch more than mine were.  I decided that was the day to start her.  I'm making all her food (at least for now).  It's certainly easy enough and I know exactly what she's getting.  Thus far, sweet potato is her favorite followed by avocado.  Tonight, we're trying barley for the first time.  I suspect it'll go over like rice cereal and oatmeal - like a lead balloon.  

She's almost crawling.  Not quite, but just about it.  She'd much rather support her forearms in our hands and walk - which equates to 6 or 7 stutter steps and then she sits down.  The stutter steps are getting better and more consistent, so we'll see which she does first - crawl or walk.  If you ask my mother, she thinks it's terrible that Ruth is going straight to walking.  According to her, a baby needs to learn how to crawl.  Whatever.  Ruth will do what she wants to do.

She and <lj user=""milknut""> are getting along incredibly well.  There are days that I'm superfluous (except for when Ruth wants to nurse).  I thrilled that this has worked out.  Now that <lj user =""milknut"">'s work schedule is changing, we're going to have to find secondary care since I'm still going to need 15 hours or so a week.  I'm thinking of finding a teen to work as a mother's helper a couple of days a week after school to make up the hours for me.  Even if <lj user=""milknut""> can work only one day a week we're going to keep her on as long as she wants to be here.

Ruth appears to be ahead of the game in at least one area.  Speech development is happening rapidly.  She babbles along like more babies her age, but she's also learning words and understanding what they represent.  She's already said her first words - kitty cat.  She says them <em>clearly</em> when Dante or Pandora are around (and doesn't turn around and point at the toaster and call it a kitty cat afterwards).  Both my MIL and <lj user=""milknut""> have witnessed this, so I'm not reading into what I'm hearing.  Today, she seemed to associating ""Da Da"" with Wombat and my MIL swears she was looking for ""Ma Ma"" when the MIL was babysitting her this morning.  If she continues at this rate, we're gonna have our hands full.   As an interesting side note, she also called the MIL's cat ""kitty cat"".  So I guess she's smart enough to know that Dante and Pandora aren't the only two cats on the planet.

Yesterday, she also demonstrated that she understood object permanance very clearly when I hid a toy and she found it almost immediately.  I thought this was supposed to happen a little later in the game as well.  (Yes - I threw the book out a long time ago, but still...)

And here are some <a href=""http://smilestore.picturepeople.com/my/images?tk=6d9e6a0a-3cff-4f88-ae25-b4d7e378e92d"">pictures</a> to look at... These are the family shots we got done last month at The Picture People.  
OK.  Done bragging now.  I'm a proud, but very tired mamma."

"event","Osiris died sometime in the last 24 hours.  I've known for a couple of weeks that the end was near for her - there were at least a few times that I questioned whether or not she had already died because she was so still.  Elderly lizards don't move much overall.

Osiris was our first pet together.  She preceded Dante by about a year and a half.  We had her for 13 years.  She significantly outlived her life expectancy as a captive iguana.  Most don't live that long because their owners don't take the time to learn how to properly care for them.  Osiris was never lovable and even at her best, she wasn't sociable.  In otherwords, not what most would consider an ideal pet.  She was part of our family nonetheless.  

Osiris, I hope you succeed in taking over the world in your next life."

"event","Well.. it was good until I watched the Pats lose this afternoon.  Currently, Pittsburgh is up 14 to nuthin', so maybe my day will improve.  Ruth and Daddy are napping while we watch the game, so I have some time to update my journal.

Our nanny (<lj user=""milknut"">) started this week.  I can't begin to talk about what a relief it is to have someone I know and trust here taking care of Ruth.  Since we share a similar ""earthy-crunchy"" philosophy, it's been a relatively easy transition.  I think Ruth was confused since I was still in the house, but I wasn't actively paying attention to her.  I give her another week or so and she probably won't even care.  (She was already fairly content to play with <lj user=""milknut""> by Friday).  To have my head and hands free to get things done is very cool.  Since my consulting work won't really get going until this upcoming week, I was able to get a few things done around the house while easing Ruth into the situation.

<lj user=""nisi_on_the_net""> called me yesterday from China.  She uses Skype, so the call is fairly cheap for her.  Once I get set up on Skype, it'll be free.  It was good to hear from her.  I think about her often, so when she calls it always makes my day.

I know people have been bugging me about posting some pictures of Ruth online.  I have a Walgreens account set up with a ton of pictures.  If you want me to share that with you, bug me and I'll do that.  (You'll ultimately need a Walgreens account to look at all of them).  Wombat's been kinda busy, but I'll also see what he can do locally so I can share pictures without going through Walgreens."

"event","An opportunity has landed in my lap.  (I love it when that happens).  Wombat's newest client has so much work that Wombat can't keep up with it.  It's work I can do, so after some discussion, I'm going back to consulting.  

<lj-cut text=""But what about Ruth and the fact that you wanted out of tech badly?"">
Yes.  I hate tech.  Yes.  I have these plans to change my vocation.  And those plans are still there, but they're just going to happen more slowly and maybe I won't make a complete change -- at least not as immediately as I had originally planned.  The money's good and some of the things I hate (like dealing with asshole clients) won't be an issue.  I actually don't mind the programming work -- it was all the other na-na that burnt me out the first time around.  (NOTE:  If you spoke to me about potentially being a doula for you, I still plan to have my certification squared away by the time you're due).

I'll be working 15-20 hours a week out of the home.  That means I need to find childcare for Ruth.  I love my daughter dearly, but lordie, she can be a handful.  In a good way.  But still.  When she's awake (and that's most of the time), she needs constant stimulation.  Y'know how some babies are content with being put down to stare at ceiling fans, dust bunnies, or shadows?  That's not my kid.  I have no hope of getting work done while trying to keep her amused.  So while Wombat and I were making the decision about whether or not I should join the workforce again, we also had to make a decision about how we were going to deal with our little munchkin.

We've decided on one-on-one childcare.  Call it a Nanny or a Mommy's Assistant or a Babysitter, but that's where we're going.  I have fairly strong feelings about putting my kid in daycare at such a young age despite the fact that it'd probably be cheaper.  So I'm now embarking on a journey that as of last week, I never thought I'd need: we're looking for Mary Poppins.

Anyone have any experience with this?  I'm hoping to find someone that can manage Ruth as well as some light housework for the 15 - 20 hours per week I'll be working.  Since I'll be around, I'll still be available to feed her... which is good, since Ruth never took to a bottle no matter what we did and she's ok with a sippy cup, but she hasn't had a full meal from a cup yet.  I'm looking for a good agency in the area as I don't have the time or inclination to deal with a newspaper ad.  I figure the extra cost of hiring someone through the agency will more than pay for itself since I shouldn't have to do a background check or weed through nutjob applicants. 

For the short term, I'm hoping the MIL can handle Ruth for at least 10 hours a week so I can get started.  I'm actually secretly hoping she might sign up to take her for a full afternoon weekly so I won't need to hire someone for quite as many hours.  While the budget will support someone for the full 15 - 20 hours, if I can save money for something else...like say, a college fund... I wouldn't complain.  :)

I like Taco Bell.  It's fast and can be done vegetarian.  So when I order the nachos with beans instead of meat, that's what I expect to get.  In fact, when the nice drive-thru cashier enters it into your cash-register-computer-thingy correctly, I expect you to make them WITHOUT MEAT.  But.  If you're going to fuck up the order and put meat on it, could you not hide it under the chips so when we check the order before leaving the premises, we can actually see that you messed up and we can rectify it?  

I did not enjoy sitting down to a night of TiVo and junk food only to realize that instead of a mouthful of beany goodness, I was eating your greasy wannabe hamburger substance.  I also did not enjoy feeling unsettled and barfy for a good bit of the evening/night while my body tried to figure out what to do with that small helping of faux cow.

No love-n-kisses for you,
Me."

"event","Last week's funeral was the most upbeat funeral I ever attended.  The most depressing part was one of the songs that family wanted me to sing -- a beautiful Appalachian piece.  (Not something that you'd normally hear sung at a funeral, but fitting nonetheless).  I don't know the circumstances around the man's death, but those at the funeral were all about celebrating his life instead of mourning.  I think this is great -- but it was odd at the same time.

Today I'm meeting my friend D for lunch.  She'll have her little girl in tow who is just starting to speak and is learning to say her name.  Her name ends in ""th"" so when she says it, there's a bit of a snake effect.  She does the same when she says Ruth's name - it's very cute.  We'll see how long she and Ruth hold up while D and I catch up.

I have to rant for a second... I knew that there would be hormonal changes after giving birth.  I just didn't realize that they happen 4+ months after the fact!  Now my hair's falling out.  (Yes, Wombat, that's me that keeps clogging the shower drain.. sorry).  Now I'm having wicked hot flashes at night.  Now my face looks like it did when I was 14.  Gack.  I know this too shall pass, but I had hoped that the Ugly would be going away now that I'm getting back to my normal size.

Busy afternoon.  After lunch, we'll go visit grandma for a few and then Ruth and I will be off to our New Mommy's Group.  She's one of the oldest babies in the group, but it's nice to get out and meet other moms.  One mom has a 6 weeks old that is Just. Too. Cute.  I have a hard time remembering Ruth when she was that size..."

I just booked my first singing gig in months.  (Church doesn't count).  Nothing exciting -- just a funeral tomorrow.  (Don't know who the deceased is.. and that's better that way).  But it's a positive step.  Singing after having a baby is wierd -- everything changes and you have to find your breath support all over again.  I had a couple of opportunities to sing this summer and I chickened out.  I'm kind of excited to be doing the service despite it being a funeral.  Now I just have to figure out what to wear.  I'm back in my pre-prego clothes, but I haven't taken everything out of storage.  (Laziness).  I'm hoping that I have a few funeral-appropriate things that are clean and don't smell like mothballs."

"event","Wombat inspired me to update my journal since he did his... Since it's been over two months since I last did so, I don't even know where to start.  So let's see..

First off -- to those that recently found out you're prego -- CONGRATULATIONS!  It sounds like we'll have a busy spring/summer with all the new babies.  And here I was wondering where I'd get my ""new baby smell"" fix after Ruth loses hers.  Of course, some days, that smell ain't all it's cracked up to be.

And speaking of Ruth.. she's doing well.  4.5 months old - she'll be five months on the 21st.  We're still exclusively BFing - I decided to hold the solids until 6 months.  I've found I can still keep up with her demands fairly easily.  She meets all the milestones, but I don't want to rush it.  A couple months ago, I finally decided to embrace ""attachment parenting"".  (Yes.. Dr. Sears is my best friend...)  Ruth now sleeps with us and she's carried most of the day.  Co-sleeping rocks -- feeding her in the middle of the night without waking up (much) is VERY nice.  We bought a sling last week to make carrying her easier as she's getting a little big for the Baby Bjorn - at least for my back  (she's about 14.5 pounds).  She and I are getting used to it -- it's different than the Bjorn, so there's an adjustment there for both of us.  The upshot is that she cries and fusses *alot* less and bedtime is usually fuss-free.

As for career stuff... heh.. what career?  I started the reading for the doula training... So. Many. Books.  Of course, this is my own fault since I want to be certified as both a birth and post partum doula.  I was planning on taking the birth doula certification class in November, but have decided to push that off until after the first of the year.  I'm not ready to be separated from Ruth for a weekend yet.  (I'll also start shadowing other doulas after the first as well).  I'm finding the post partum reading interesting -- much of what I'm  taking away from it is applicable for my own life.  The birth reading is more difficult for two reasons... first, I'm just burnt out on it -- I did a lot of reading on the subject before Ruth was born.  I'm sick of reading about giving birth.  And second, the more I read, the more I realize that I'm still struggling with my own birth experience.  Reading about how a doula can make your birth go easier makes me a little sad that I was denied that resource... and it makes me a little bitter.  I've hooked up with a great group of Worcester-area doulas/birth educators - they've been a great resource in directing my efforts for education and they're also proving to be wonderful sounding boards as I work through the unresolved feelings.  

I'm back to singing, but not to lessons.  Wombat alluded to the financial crunch we've been in -- having a client who thinks it's optional to pay with any sort of regularity makes it tough to shell out $40/lesson.  It's good to be back doing what I can, though, so I'm not complaining.  Hopefully, with his second client, a couple lessons a month won't be a big deal.  I miss my teacher.. and I miss the regular ass-kicking that she hands out... I so need my ass kicked on occasion.

My biggest challenge right now is getting out of the house.  I need to get out more as I tend to get cabin fever.  But (as those of you with kids know), it's a production to go anywhere.  But for my own sanity, I need to get out more often.  And I also need to get in touch with several people who I've been meaning to call for weeks now..  Now that Wombat's car is back on the road, there's really no excuse to stay home since he doesn't need the CRV anymore.   

Wombat and I are still trying to work out how to balance things so he can get his work done and I can get some non-baby time during the day.  We can't afford daycare at the moment -- and even if we could, I don't think I'd want to put her in just yet.  (After she's a year old.. then we'll talk).  So we're doing a juggling act... some days, we're good at it.  Some days... not so much.  But such is the story with all parents, no?

And now I have to feed a hungry baby.."

Saturday's wedding was a lot of fun.  Beautiful ceremony and we got to catch up with a few people we haven't seen in awhile.  Ruth was less thrilled with the day -- too many people and too long of a car ride for her liking.  She was good for the ride out and the event, but the ride home was...long.

Today was spent with a group of Wombat's friends from high school.  One friend is a doula.  We got to talking about my plans and she has offered to help me get connected with whomever I need in the area.  I never doubted my ability to do the job.  I was a little nervous about getting into the community and finding the right people in general.  Looks like this won't be much of a problem afterall.  

Overall, today was a relaxing day down at a private beach in Sturbridge.  Ruth slept for much of the day (probably sleeping off the stress of the last couple of days).  So it was a nice visit and a chance to see a bunch of people that we don't see often enough.

<lj-cut text=""Here's what's happening..."">

The Good:
Ruth had her 2 month app't yesterday.  It was a week late because my mom was in town last week.  (See The Ugly).  She's growing like a weed.  22"" long and 11.5 pounds.  Breastfeeding has finally (mostly) worked itself out.  A couple of weeks ago, she decided she didn't need the nipple shield anymore.  The transition was a little rough as she worked out her latch without it, but that's what they make Sheep Dip..err..Lanolin for.   Every day is something new for her now -- real smiles, giggles, grabbing at her toys, sitting up with help, etc, etc -- all those little firsts that probably don't mean much if the baby isn't yours, but it's the coolest thing in the world to see when she does belong to you. 

I found time to sit down and take a long hard look at the eBay business.  In doing so, I figured out where I was making money (Good) and where I haven't been (Bad) and how I can change things so I might be more consistently making money - even with the rate increases.  The downside is that a major overhaul requires more time than I might be able to give, so I'm now looking at how to do it in bitesize chunks.  It's mostly just a matter of prioritizing so I don't get reamed by the new fees while I make the transition.  If I can do this, I should be able to continue selling on eBay part time as I work on my certifications.

And speaking of that new career, I was able to order the books I need to start doula training.  They arrived a couple of days ago.  I am both excited and overwhelmed -- several of these books look very cool.  But there's so much reading...

The Bad:
I said goodbye to two friends over the course of two days.  I realized how badly I suck at goodbyes yesterday when saying farewell to <lj user=""nisi_on_the_net""> and her husband.  I was broadsided by how hard it turned out to be.  Granted, she and I have been through quite a bit together this last year, but I thought I was prepared for it.  This morning, when I was thinking things over in the shower, I realized why her departure hit me so hard.  She and I have the relationship where - regardless of the time of day - we can pick up the phone and call each other and either vent about what's bothering us..or chat about random na-na..or do some of both.  Since she'll be in China, I don't see this happening very often since I don't want to take out a second mortgage to pay the phone bill.  I also came to realize how much I depend on email, LJ, and the like to maintain relationships -- I need to change that.

And as icing on the Bad Day cake yesterday, Ruth got her first vaccinations.  She was fine for a couple of hours afterwards, but when she finally started to feel it, I got slammed with the whammy bar.  She's better today, but yesterday afternoon/night were exhausting.  And to make matters worse, when I broke out the baby tylenol, I discovered the label doesn't actually give the dosing for under 2 years of age -- it says to consult your doctor.  (Had I known, I would have asked the doctor whow much to give Ruth when she told me I might need to use it).  *sigh*   With Ruth screaming bloody murder, there was no way I was going to make it through a phonecall with her doctor.  Fortunately, I found the correct dosage on the web. 

The Ugly:
Mom was up to visit last week.  Overall, it was a good visit for her and Ruth.  I'm sad that it'll take Ruth time to remember her on their next visit at the end of this month.  What made the visit ugly is my mom's unwillingness to accept Ruth's limits.  Every day we had to go do something which probably would have been ok if Ruth hadn't started her 2 month growth spurt halfway through the visit.  I tried to put my foot down a couple of times and was met with crankiness/whininess.  Yes, I could have really laid down the law, but I didn't want to fight with my mother.  By the time my mom left on Friday, Ruth and I were both pretty burnt out.  

And I'm trying to figure out exactly what I need to do to kick myself in the ass to start exercising.  It's not a lack of time or being tired -- although on some days, these are valid reasons.  It's that physically, I'm whipped.  I have no abdominal muscle tone so my lower back and hips hurt constantly.  If I started doing yoga and walking again, this would work itself out.  But I don't feel like it because I hurt.. but I'll continue to feel weak and hurty until I get off my ass... Nice spiral, eh?  The worst part of this spiral is that it really affects my ability to sing -- I have no power.  Come September, when church resumes, this will become a big problem, so I have a month to get myself on track.  Even if I'm not 100% come September, if I'm at least going in the right direction, I'll be fine.

"event","I guess eBay made the decision for me as to what to do...

As of August 22, they'll be raising their store fees -- insertion fees are going up 150%.  They're also jacking up the final value fees.  They aren't raising the monthly storefront fee (which is on top of the insertion and final value fees)... they raised those about a year and a half ago.

I use my store to sell off small stuff (dollar value).  This is stuff that'll sell, but not under the auction format.  When I have auctions up and running -- which I haven't since Ruth was born -- the auctions drive business to the store and they two compliment each other well.  With that said, the store isn't a huge money-maker.  Running the store solo means I'm breaking even on the fees and that's about it.  (I didn't take it down for ""maternity leave"" because that would mean relisting 900+ items at some point).  I also have a backlog of stuff to get into the store at some point -- I buy large lots of old sheet music and post cards.

So now I have a boatload of inventory to unload.  And I don't want to pay GreedBay to do it.  But I don't have a heckuva lot of time on my hands to research other venues."

"event","I went strawberry-picking with A and her two kids yesterday.  It was nice to get out of the house and get some sun and fresh air.  And Tougas' was picking in their lower fields, so that we even got a ""hay"" ride.  (I use quotes because they use the same cart that they put hay on in the fall, but you sit on the benches instead of hay).  I think the cart ride was the highlight of the trip for the kids... strawberry-picking is hard work, afterall.  :)

Sadly, the strawberries are SUCKY.  The weather has not been kind.  There are tons of berries just rotting on the plant... we had to lower our standards quite a bit when we were picking or we'd still be there looking for the perfect berry.  The flavor isn't much better... somewhat flavorless or (if there's flavor) tart.  Nothing like what a fresh-picked strawberry should taste like.  At least A and I split a flat, so I don't have a metric boatload of berries that I don't want to keep.

I cleaned them all this morning.  I have enough for some baked goodies, so I'll make a cobbler... and maybe some muffins.  I figure they'll be good and sugared, so their sub-quality won't show through quite so much.

Now, the tart cherries I picked up while I was there, on the otherhand... YUM."

"event","I've finally made up my mind about what I want to do when I grow up.

<lj-cut text=""A career in music would be nice, but..."">
I've done a lot of thinking about what it would take to have a career in music that I could actually make a little money at.  I never expected to make tons of cash, but at the same time, I'd like to make a meaningful financial contribution to the household.  Realistically, this means I do one of two things: teach or church work.  

Church work means that I need to learn how to play the organ.  While I have a resource that's more than happy to do this for me, I just don't want to go there.  It's not a lack of desire to learn -- it's a lack of time to committ to the endeavor.  Since I do not own an organ, I'd need to find time to go to the church regularly to practice.  And it would take some time for me to really get good enough to do anything.

Teaching is much the same thing except I can practice at home.  But practice I would need.  After talking to a number of people who actually teach, it sounds like I should go get my Masters in Music (not education).  In order to get good enough for any respectable school to accept me, I would need to practice.  A lot.  Several hours a day at least.  

Either way, it's at least year before I'm really able to do anything worthwhile.  So music remains a (serious) hobby for me.  And that's actually fine.

This got me thinking about other things that I am interested in - holistic/natural medicine kept coming up to the top of my list.  This is another ""hobby"" of mine in that I've done lots of research around specific things (like pregnancy) looking for alternatives to traditional Western Medicine.  So, starting in the next month or so, I am kicking off my two year plan.  (Which includes being ""useful"" sometime after the first of the year).

Over the course of the next two years, I'm working towards several certifications: Birth/Postpartum Doula, Yoga Instructor, and Ayurvedic Medicine.  I'll have the Birth Doula certification around the first of the year (except for the practical experience part).  The PPD certification will be shorly thereafter -- I just need to find a certification class that I can get to.  The Yoga and Ayurvedic certs will follow over the coure of the next couple of years.  

My goal is to work with a couple of different populations -- obviously, pregnant and postpartum women.  After my birth and breastfeeding experience with Ruth, I feel even more strongly about this.  I expect that I will probably be working with kids as an offshoot of this.  (Think Mommy & Me Yoga, Circus Yoga, etc).  I am also interested in people with chronic pain and/or the elderly.  My mother has rheumatory arthritis -- watching her cope with some of the challenges with this disease has inspired me to help others with similar conditions.  

It's nice to have a roadmap finally laid out and know where I'm going.  I'm looking forward to building on my medical/biology background and learning something new.

"event","This evening, I'm taking advantage of Ruth actually going to sleep at bedtime and staying asleep.  (It took a couple of tries, but 2.5 hours later, she's still out).  I'm actually slowly getting caught up on eBay transactions.  Last night, before I went to bed, I sent an email to my pending customers to let them know that I hadn't forgotten about them and that I'd get their stuff out to them by the end of the week.  (I had hoped to do more, but Ruth decided that what we wanted for bedtime didn't fit into her hectic social calendar.. or something).

So today, I get an email from an asshole who wants me to cancel his order.  Here's the ironic thing:  He bought a book and asked for it to be shipped media mail (which sometimes takes 10 - 15 days to get to where it's going).  He paid for the purchase on 6/12.  In otherwords, if I had shipped it the instant he paid for it, there's a chance he wouldn't have it by now.  I had planned on upgrading this guy's shipping to Priority to get it to him -- if you factor in my normal processing time, he'd get the book at roughly the same time he would have if I had shipped it media when he originally bought it.  But he's an asshole.

And I got an email from a woman in Canada who bought a board game from me back in April.  She tells me that the game is what she expected, but she was disappointed that the box needs repaired and asked what was I going to do about it.  The description reads: ""The box is generally shelf worn and scuffed up - especially along the bottom. The box lid has two split corners - the edge that's adjacent to these corners is also starting to split.""  So yeah - no shit, the box ain't perfect.  Another classic case of people forgetting how to read.  Maybe I should send her a roll of Scotch Tape.

And finally... the one that I feel kinda bad about... I had a buyer from the Netherlands who purchased a game at the end of April.  It's a little Bridge game that you can play solo.  The guy tells me it's for his dying mother who can't attend her regular bridge game anymore.  Instead of paying for the game via Paypal, he sends me a check.  I receive the check at the end of last month.  Per my policy, there was a 10 day hold put on it, so the game should have shipped on the 8th of this month... and it was delayed like everything else, so I sent this guy the ""wicked sorry"" email.  He responds today to tell me his mom died last week and was buried on Friday.  Granted, this guy picked the slowest way to pay possible, but I still feel bad.  (And yes, if I had shipped it when the hold was up, I doubt his mom would have lived to see it's arrival...)

My ""wicked sorry"" email did include a brief explanation of why things are delayed.  And most of my other customers wrote back with their congratulations/best wishes and were quite understanding of the situation.  It's nice to know that not everyone I deal with is a jerk.

Hot weather = hot cranky baby.  But she doesn't always want to settle in the Pack-n-Play in the bedroom where there's A/C, so she sometimes hangs out or naps downstairs.  Where it's hot.  And then she gets cranky.  Which makes getting anything done impossible.  And feeding her is painful -- when she blows her cork, she doesn't remember to open up for the latch.  Ow.  And despite making hungry-baby indications, she may not be hungry.  Or thirsty.  I think she just wants to see Mommy screw around with her nursing bra.

But this isn't why I'm pissed.  No.  I'm pissed that the high-end Sony Babycall monitor that we got stopped working less than a week after we started using it.  And it'll take 2 - 3 weeks to get a replacement.  (It was bought back in March, so it's well-past the return period that BRU allows for).  This came highly recommended because it has a bazillion channels and will work no matter how many electronics you have in the house.  (And we got lots of 'em).  We just finally got her taking naps upstairs in the Pack-n-Play.. and we're finally establishing a bedtime.  But you can only hear her if you're sitting in the couch in the family room if you don't have the TV turned up.  If you go anywhere else downstairs, you don't hear her.  No matter how loud she screams.  So while we're waiting on the replacement, do we take our chances and buy a cheap-o monitor and pray it works with all the other electronics or do we live on the couch waiting for her to start screaming?  

And then on top of this, I'm finally coming to the realization that I was smoking crack when I thought I could actually run a business and have an infant at the same time.  My business is completely scaled back at the moment (handful of store sales a week and no auctions) and I still can't keep up with it.  I have a backlog of stuff to ship out.  I have payments and sales that haven't been processed.  And despite many apologies with an explanation about delays, I have pissed off customers.  In reality, I don't actually blame some of them for being pissed -- I'm not holding up my end of the bargain for how quickly I can turn a sale around.  It's starting to look like I need to just completely shut stuff down for a couple of weeks until I get some semblance of a schedule together.  (Setting Ruth's ""schedule"" is working... slowly... but it's easily thrown off).

Time to go check on the baby... and then see if I can get anything accomplished before she's looking for her late night snack.

The last three weeks, I have been consumed with breasts.  Now, I realize many of you don't find this to be a bad thing at all.  However, when part of the obsession involves figuring out why your baby would prefer to hurt you rather than just latch on and do her thing, it stinks.

They say that the only part of your body that has more nerve endings than the nipple is the cornea.  I believe it.  For awhile, the pain associated with breastfeeding was hands down worse than full blown labor on Pitocin.  It bad enough that I considered giving up.  Two visits to a lactation consultant over the past 1.5 weeks has resulted in far less pain... as long as Ruth doesn't feed CONSTANTLY.

And it's not the constant feeding of a growth spurt.  Unless she's been having one fairly consistently since we brought her home from the hospital.  In the past several weeks, there were times where she'd take 7 - 10 breasts worth in the course of 5 - 6 hours with little or no sleep between.  The lactation consultant helped me address pain/latch management -- she didn't help with schedules or how to ""empty"" the breast completely.

So Jim picked up ""The Contented Little Baby Book"" by Gina Ford.  I had read about this book a couple of months ago -- it's all about putting your baby on a schedule and how to feed more efficiently.  At first, I found her schedule ideas not only daunting, but also draconian.  (The book is very strict about the feeding/napping/playtime scheduling).   But it was either that or go insane, so we decided to try it.  We're on Day #2.

Ruth doesn't like it thus far.  It's wierd going against the old adage to ""not wake the sleeping baby"", but we do that to get her to feed at appropriate intervals throughout the day.  (She really doesn't like this).  BUT, she's already sleeping better... and she's eating more efficiently -- and I get breaks in between feeds.  And I think in another couple of days, she'll be doing the waking up on her own.  (And as a side note, despite the concept of a schedule, I am still feeding on demand some -- if she wakes up from her nap early because she's hungry, I don't make her wait until the assigned feeding time... )  I foresee some challenges around going out with her with this schedule, but I think once we're settled into it, we'll figure it out.

We're still using the nipple shield.  I'm hoping to re-wean her off it in the next week or so.  Now that we have the latching issues pretty much worked out, I think we can tackle her latching without the shield.  She's already done this several times, but just isn't consistent.  I haven't pushed the issue because I figured I was already throwing a lot at her with just readjusting her latch in general.

Aside from that, Ruth is happy and healthy and growing.  The cats have adjusted to her presence by basically ignoring her.  When she screams, they leave the room while giving us a dirty look.  But they haven't tried to smother her in her sleep yet, so I look at this as a Good Thing.

This week I'm starting to work again -- it's dramatically scaled back from what I was doing before Ruth was born, but I need something to do that doesn't involve an infant.  And heck, now that she's sleeping for a few stretches during the day, I actually have a little time to do something other than watching old Law & Order reruns that the TiVo recorded.

On the MIL front, she's being surprisingly good.  Very little in the way of parenting advice.  (She's doing better than my mother).  Her latest obsession is getting us curtains for the mudroom.  No, I don't understand why.. I was happy with what was there.  But there it is.  
</lj-cut>

I think we're finally open to get togethers -- we'll just have to work around her schedule for awhile until she's really settled into it.  But if you want to meet her, drop me an email and we'll figure something out.  We'll be sending out an email for a game night or afternoon sometime soonish as well.  Both Wombat and I are in need of adult conversation."

My folks came up to help for a little while.  They arrived the day after I got back from the hospital, so the timing was great.  I was looking forward to spending time with them... and then overnight, mom turned into THAT mother (y'know the one...)

""Why don't you just give Ruth a bottle?"" - Said to me as we were leaving for Target so I could buy a few pairs of shorts that fit.  (My maternity jeans - low-riders and full belly panels - all cut right about where the incision is.  Ouch).  Gee mom.  Ruth already has nipple confusion -- let's just add to the mix and see how the poor kid does.

""Why don't you just give Ruth a pacifier if you don't want her to fuss?""  See above response.

""Why don't you give her a bottle of water?""  Said when it got hot.  See above response.  Oh yeah - and a bottle of water might upset the electrolyte balance in Ruth's body and cause a seizure.

""Maybe Ruth is feeding all the time because your milk is thin.  You should drink more milk so you have more protein.  You're a vegetarian - you can't possibly be getting enough protein.""  Said after a night of cluster feeding.  Ummm, mom?  Yesterday, I had protein at all three meals (which I proceeded to list what I ate that had protein in it).  In fact, I may have had more protein than you did and you eat meat.

The conversation about protein happened only once -- apparently, my cunning response was too much for her to argue against.  The other conversations happened at least twice a day - sometimes more.  My mother doesn't understand the concept of nipple confusion, cluster feeding, or feeding on demand (among other things)... often times, when she doesn't understand something, she doesn't believe it exists.

"event","I started the birth process with the hope of having a completely natural birth.  No drugs.  No interventions.  I hired a doula to help facilitate this knowing that since I had chosen to go the hospital route, I'd probably need some extra support in getting what I thought was best.  I doubt any birth ever goes completely according to the plan, but Ruth's birth was miles off the mark.  Under the cut the full story from when labor kicked in to when I left the hospital - it's pretty long.  <lj-cut text=""An exercise in what can go wrong will go wrong..."">

5/18/2006, approximately 8:30pm - While walking out of the Shaw's in White City, I get hit with a whammy-bar of a contraction.  Since stuff had been happening all along, I didn't think too much of it until I got another one roughly 5 minutes later... and another one.. and another one.  We head to bed by 11pm to try to get some sleep.

5/19/2006, approximately 5:30am - My water breaks.  After takng a shower and getting dressed, the doctor and doula are called.  Since the contractions were still 5 - 7 minutes apart, the on-call doctor tells me to hang out at home.  This is also when I learn that my regular doctor is at a conference in Connecticut.  The doula showed up shortly after breakfast and hung out for most of the day.  After talking to the doctor around 7pm, it's decided that if the contractions get worse over night, I should come in.  Otherwise, I can wait until the following morning and head to the hospital.

5/20/2006, approximately 10am - We're off to the hospital.  The contractions are worse, but still very manageable.  Upon arrival, I'm checked and it's determined that I'm still 1cm.  In otherwords, my body still isn't getting its act together.  Since my water broke over 24 hours ago, we're on the clock.  Time for the Pitocin. 

At this point, I meet my doctor's partner for the second time in my life.  He's a nice guy and (despite being generally uncomfortable with male doctors) I feel I can work with him.  He has a resident in tow, who I will call Dr. Tool for the remainder of this story.  After some discussion with the Real Doctor, Dr. Tool is put in charge of my care.  The Real Doctor tells me he's taking off, my Actual Doctor will be in sometime around 8pm and that Some Other Doctor might be in to look in on me.  Fabulous.  Continuity of care at its finest.

5/20/2006, early afternoon - I'm still sitting in Triage because the hospital is so busy they don't have a real room for me.  About this time, my doula informs me that she's going to leave.  She had warned me about a camping trip she had scheduled for the weekend but told me the prior evening not to worry about it.  She changed her mind.  And she left.  Watching that lifeline walk out of the room after already veering off the birthplan within an hour of setting foot in the hospital was probably one of the hardest things I had to do (at least to that point).  My friend A knew about the doula's camping plans and had told me that if anything came up, she'd come and sit with me and Wombat.  Wombat called her and she came in.  At the time, I still expected (despite the Pit) to have a relatively normal birthing experience and if A wanted to share that with us and lend some extra support, that was fine.  A arrived within the hour.

5/20/2006, mid-afternoon - I'm finally moved to my own room where I'm left to labor to my heart's content.  The labor pains were 1 - 3 minutes apart and intense for pain.  The timing was still odd, though -- I'd get three of them together and then a short (2 - 3 minute) break and then another three.  Since I'm hooked up to the monitors because of the PIt, I can't really move around as much as I'd like, but the Yoga Ball proved to be invaluable for helping to manage the pain.  The dosage on the Pit was still relatively low, so I looked at this as promising.

Shortly after arriving in the room, the nurse asked if I had a ferning to test to see if my water actually broke.  I didn't.  She reamed Dr. Tool a new one for forgetting to do this.  (And a test is performed, showing that indeed the water broke).  When Dr. Tool checked me, he would forget to tell the nurse basic facts like effacement and the baby's station.  I would have done better if I just had Wombat check me, I think.

I have since found out that at this point Ruth was showing subtle signs of distress.  The nurse hinted at this by telling me to drink more juice and eat popsicles to get more sugar in my system.  HOWEVER, not once did Dr. Tool or Some Other Doctor bother to mention that there were any problems.  Around 4pm, I was checked and I had progressed to 4cm. and 60% effaced.  (This was one of the many times that Dr. Tool had to be reminded to actually give all the stats).

5/20/2006, approximately 7pm - Dr. Tool comes back for yet another check.  I push him off, telling him I'd like to wait until my Actual Doctor arrived since she'd be there around 8pm.  (Dr. Tool isn't so good at the checks -- I know they aren't supposed to be comfortable, but he was... rough).  He proceeded to give me a lecture about pushing things off... while I was in the middle of one of those contraction clusters.  I still remember clearly openning my eyes (and coming back from my ""Happy Place""), looking him straight in the face, and saying ""I don't need a fucking lecture"".  I didn't see him again until he came in with my Actual Doctor around 9pm.

5/20/2006, approximately 9pm - The Actual Doctor arrives.  While she's checking me, she informs me that it's time hook me up to all the internal monitors.  And without further conversation or stated reason, during a contraction, that's exactly what happened.  The contraction pressure monitor HURT when they put it in.  I point blank told the doctor to take it out and not put another one in.  Instead she took it out and put it in again, ignoring my wishes.  At this point, I mentally checked out.  More was happening than I could process and the sudden violation - the only word that I can come up with to describe it - took my mind back to an incident that I had thought long since put to rest.  I remember Wombat trying to talk me down.  I remember A talking to Wombat and keeping him focussed on me, instead of roundhousing Dr. Tool.  I remember the oxygen mask being shoved on my face - which freaked me out further since it's claustophobic.  Somewhere, during this fiasco, I realize how this is all going to end.  Even if I managed to instantaneously calm down, the damage had been done.  Ruth was already under stress and I managed to put her under even more.

I'd like to just say here that A did an admirable job.  We all assumed this would be a normal birth which she has experience with - she has two beautiful kids that came into the world with relatively little fuss.  But A isn't a doula and certainly didn't know all the tricks that doulas have up their sleeves.  Nor did she know what she could or couldn't get away with in terms of advocacy for me.  This was one of those births that I truly needed a doula.  If mine had stuck around,  I may have still ended up with a C-section, but I believe that some of the stupidity and non-communicaton up to this point would not have happened - the path to get there would have been very different.

Shortly after all this happened, as I was trying to get myself focussed again, I'm finally told that Ruth is under stress.  (A conversation with my Real Doctor after this was all over with revealed that Dr. Tool told her that I knew what was going on.  So I don't completely blame her for how she handled things -- she was going in with a few incorrect assumptions.)  At this check I was 7cm, so they decide to turn off the Pit and see what happens.

Between then and 1:30am, the Pit is turned off and on again several times.  When off the Pit, the contractions slow down.  When on the Pit, Ruth's stress is starting to become apparent.  The OB doctor is called in -- my doctor is Family Practice -- and she suggests a few things to try, including replenishing the fluid in the uterus to see if that takes care of the stress.  (Another somewhat uncomfortable procedure).  It doesn't.  I'm finally given a choice - C-section or have a procedure that draws blood from Ruth's scalp to see what's really going on.  The blood draw would happen every 30 minutes -- and in between the draws, we hope that something happens for progression.  I opt for the C-Section.

5/21/2006, 2am - I'm wheeled into the OR and prepped.  Wombat joins me by 2:10am.  Ruth is born at 2:14am.  Despite it not being standard policy, Wombat is allowed to stay with me even after Ruth is taken to the nursery.  A is put on baby chasing detail.  (Oh yeah -- and for those of you who are playing along at home, Ruth missed being a Taurus by 2 hours and 14 minutes -- she's a Gemini).

By 3am, I'm in the recovery room and bonding with Ruth.  We're having problems with breastfeeding due to semi-faulty equipment (short nipples).  The night nurse hands me a nipple shield and two of the plastic helmut thingies and tells me she'll get me on the list for a visit with the lactation consultant later in the day.  

5/21/2006 8am -  The pain meds wear off.  I call the nurse to remind her to bring me more.  By 8:45, nothing had arrived -- I call the nurse again only to be informed that the doctors forgot to put me in the system.  No pain meds for me until she can find someone to take care of that.  By 9am, I finally get something.  While still hooked up to everything (ie, before they let me out of the bed), Ruth is brought in for her breakfast.  The nurse tells me that she'll help me.  She hangs around, watches me for 2 minutes, and then leaves.  Wombat had run home for a shower and nap, so I'm on my own.  No big deal until Ruth needs a new diaper and I can't get out of bed to help her.  The rest of the day is uneventful.  And I did not get a visit from the lactation consultant. Over night, the night nurse offered no less than a half dozen times to give Ruth formula so we could sleep.  

5/22/2006 - Ruth is starting to show signs of jaundice.  I attempt to go to the breastfeeding class, but there's no instructor.  After sitting there for 20 minutes, the 4 women who showed up, left.  I went to the nursery to pick up Ruth on my way back to the room.  The nurse in charge berates me for not feeding her enough -- it's (apparently) my fault she's showing jaundice.  After taking a deep breath so I wouldn't remove her head, I inform her that a) the breastfeeding class didn't have an instructor and b) I had been promised a visit with the lactation consultant over 36 hours ago.  What exactly was I supposed to do if I wasn't doing it right?  She finally put in the proper calls and by mid-afternoon, I met with the lactation consultant - Susan.

Susan was a goddess.  She realized that I understood what the heck I was supposed to be doing, but just needed some help with the practical application of it.  She also reassured me that I was doing everything I could be doing and that Ruth was getting plenty to eat (despite the bumps in the road).  She had me start pumping between feedings to help with the short nipple situation and also to try to get a little extra out of me -- the more Ruth ate, the better - it flushes her system of the bilirubin.  (And normally, the hospital will insist on supplementing with formula for jaundice if they feel you aren't giving your baby enough food).  I started pumping -- and I produced a ton of colostrum.  Apparently, more than most women can produce.  So my body couldn't get it's act together for labor, but it made up for it in the food department.

5/23/2006 - The shit hits the fan.  Ruth's bilirubin continues to go up.  By the evening, it's decided that she needs to go under the bili-lights.  I didn't think this would be a big deal -- Ruth had other ideas.  The little headgear that the infant needs to wear for eye protection made Ruth go ballistic.  She was inconsolable.  She screamed at the top of her lungs for 5 hours straight -- she became dehydrated from the heat of the lamps and all the screaming -- making the cure part of the problem.  After a call to the doctor shortly before midnight, it's decided to take her out from under the lights with a promise from me to feed her like crazy.  (And at this point, I have several bottles of supplemental colostrum to give Ruth, so no formula should be needed).

5/24/2006 - Home at last.  Ruth's bilirubin tests are trending downward thanks to marathon feeding sessions and her brief time under the lights, so we're allowed to leave.  Her weight loss hit it's low point and looks like it'll be trending back up.  (Which, by Friday, she was almost back to her birthweight).

We're still dealing with issues of nipple confusion because of the shield that was given to me.  Ruth's getting pretty good at feeding directly from the breast, but every now again (like this morning) she won't do it.  I'd like to throw that thing away, but I can't until I know I can consistantly feed her without it.  If you're ever offered one, refuse it -- there are other ways to get your infant to feed and the resulting nipple confusion is a royal pain to overcome.
<br></lj-cut>

I can't recommend UMass Memorial as a good place to give birth.  I'm sure some of it depends on who your doctor is, but the nursing staff has some real losers as well.  (Don't get me wrong -- there were a couple of nurses who went the extra mile and were wonderful... and then there were the rest of them).  Despite this experience, I want to do it again (in a few years) -- I hope to find someplace who can handle VBAC that's close by (that isn't UMass Memorial).  Also, despite this experience, I'm more than happy with the results -- getting to know Ruth over the past week and a half has been the best thing that I've ever done.  I'm constantly amazed at how much she can already do -- and how fast she's growing!"

"event","Ever been so tired you can't sleep? I get that way often. Especially if I have more than one day off of work. I've now had 3 full days off. I need to be up at 5 am, but I can't sleep. Last night, I cleaned my bedroom from 10 pm until a little after 4 am. I had way too much caffeine and was wired. I watched TV until 5 and then still managed to get up at a little after 7 am. I was a bit tired all day, but I was so busy with errands I hardly noticed. This evening, knowing full well I had to be back into work mode, I soaked in the hot tub at 7 pm, got ready for bed and read until a little after 9 pm. While I was reading, my eyes grew heavy, and I could feel the urge to sleep come on. Great! I'll get a nice full night's sleep. Well, sleep never came. I waited and waited and waited some more. 

So now, I wait for the Gravol pill I took to kick in. I hate doing that because I end up with a drug hangover for most of the morning. But I have to sleep. I have yet to find a cure for my insomnia. I've tried many of things with no success. I go through bouts of it periodically. Thankfully, it usually doesn't last more than a week. 

I think too much when I lay in bed. My brain starts to work, and everything bothering me, or pissing me off, floods my head. I try to shove it aside, but it's difficult. I keep so busy during the day, I don't have time to think then.

So yeah. I thought I'd write in my journal and attempt to bore myself to sleep. It's not working. Any suggestions?"

"event","So I received an e-mail from one of my best friends yesterday morning. Jason has been a good friend of mine for about 9 years now. He moved out to BC, with my mom and brother, 3 years ago. He tried it for a year, but decided it wasn't for him. He moved back a year and a half ago. Jason has always been in love with me, but I've always made it clear we would never be more than friends. I think this is one of the main reasons he moved back to Ontario. I think he felt that he would change my feelings by moving out here. He left a good paying, secure job, friends, family, everything, to move here. I told him from the get go, do this for you, not for me. He insisted he wanted a change. The town I came from was a dead end, go nowhere town. It sucked. I'm glad I got out, and all I wanted was for Jason to get out and make something more of himself. Anyhow, I'm only giving you readers some background on my relationship with Jason.

Now, I've known Jason's whole family for about 15 years. Len and Liisa (yes, Liisa with 2 i's), have 4 sons. My brothers hung out with the youngest 2, Chris and Kevin. I knew the older two, Clayton and Jason, but we never really hung out, even though Jason and I were only a year apart. I hung out with another guy, Chalmer (who was also in love with me, jeez, can guys and girls not be platonic, or what??!?!?), and he had been friends with Jason's family for years. Hanging out with Chalmer eventually led to hanging out with Jason. This family was fun. Len coached my brother's hockey team and was heavily involved with soccer. The family was quirky, but funny as hell. A very sarcastic bunch, my kind of people. Len, well, he had a lot of conspiracy theories. This guy could tell you stories that you didn't think were possible. He's encountered everything from witches to UFO's. The thing with Len is, he's such a likable guy, you really believe everything he tells you. I don't think Len is a bullshitter, even though a lot of his experiences sound very far fetched. Though I have experienced some weird shit too, one incident which took place on the same evening as one of Len's UFO encounters. Remind me to tell you my Louise Johnson story sometime.

So, moving on (I have a terrible tendency to drag out stories don't I?), the e-mail I got was simple. Len had a stomach tumour that was supposedly benign removed a couple of months ago. He never did recover, and after several tests, the family was dealt some pretty crappy news. Len has a rare form of aggressive cancer, sarcoma, and they have given him a week to 2 weeks to live. That's it. I'm shocked. It has spread into most of his organs. He's in the hospital and all they can really do is medicate him and make him comfortable. 

So, I sent an e-mail telling Jason that he and his family are in my thoughts and prayers, and that if there was anything I could do for them, not to hesitate to ask. I'm going to call this weekend. Oh, and as a side note, Jason met a great girl online from New Hampshire earlier this year and I think he's completely over me which is great. But this news is not great, it's shitty. It sucks. 

You never know what life is going to deal you, do you?"

"event","Ok, so, we've all done it I'm sure. Today, while Granny Jenkins was babysitting, my 4 year old God daughter, Emily, cut her hair. Chopped off big chunks. She had hair that was half way down her back. Long, blond and beautiful. I often put it into french braids for her. She always complained like crazy when I had to comb the knots out. A few months ago her mother, my best friend, trimmed a good 6 inches off. I was somewhat upset as I have always been a fan of long hair. Emily knew I was upset and told me, don't worry Jessie, it'll grow back. I won't let mommy cut it anymore. It was quite cute. Today, her first comment to her mother was, is Jessie going to be mad at me? Not mad doll, just heartbroken and devastated. I think I'm more upset than anyone. I took her to my hairdresser today after work to even it out. She now has a cute bob that falls just below her ears. And ridiculously short bangs. But, it will grow back. She's beautiful regardless.

I knew Bush would get back in. A few months ago I honestly pegged Kerry to be a shoe in. But over the months, I knew he wouldn't pull it off. I was shocked at how close the the results were though. There are a lot of unhappy Americans. Maybe they should all rebel, separate from the US and become some extra provinces here in Canada. We'll trade off Quebec in return.

I'm trying to figure out how to deal with an unfortunate recent discovery at work. I inadvertently became aware that the new hygienist is being paid 3 dollars more an hour than I. I've been at this office for 5 years now. I turned the entire hygiene program around. When I started I was making well below the average salary in Vernon. But it didn't bother me. I believed hard work and dedication would pay off. After 2 years I finally went in and asked for a raise. He didn't hesitate and gave me a whole 1 dollar per hour increase. Time went by, I worked hard, a hygienist left and a new one came, and I asked for a raise again. This time it was, well, ok, what are the other guys paying you (I worked for 3 dentists at the time). So, he gave me a 2 dollar an hour increase. But I was still slightly below the average. But he was a good guy to work for, the staff was great and I've always enjoyed working there. So a hygienist quit last March. He was freaked about losing one of us, so to be sure I was still on board, he gave me a pretty decent raise. A 3 dollar an hour raise. There is a shortage of dental hygienists in Western Canada. We advertised for a while and only got two responses. One was from a girl in town looking to change offices. Dale (my boss) didn't like her. Got a bad vibe/feeling from her. The other girl was from Alberta and was looking to relocate. He hired her immediately. We liked her, she's a little quirky, but hey, I'm not exactly all there or normal myself. So she started the middle of May. Last Saturday, she had her pay stub out checking over her hours and I caught wind of her wage. I was sick to my stomach. It was so tough to get through that afternoon and be civil to my boss. I was devastated.

I've been there 5 years. The previous hygienist was a nice girl, but left behind a lot of tarter. I was left to clean up a huge mess. I got people on a program. I more than tripled hygiene productions. I made Dale a lot of money. I have never asked for anything except the odd bit of time off. I never take sick days. The big joke at work is that I will come in with my heart beating in my chest and still manage to give 110%. In 5 years I've only left work ill once because I was puking my guts out with the stomach flu. I even managed to make it through the morning that day. I'm always in 30 - 40 minutes early to prepare and set up. When I have a cancellation, I find things to do. I restock rooms, I clean out my draws, I seat and take x-rays for other people's patients, I keep busy. The other hygienist will make sure her instruments are done, and her room is stocked, and then she'll sit in the back and read a magazine. I could care less about it except she's now making more than me. Am I being greedy? The trouble is, I'm starting to resent her and it's not her fault. And I used to admire and respect my boss, now I think he's sneaky and underhanded.

I'm not sure what to do. I've always been so non-confrontational. But this is eating me alive. You know, just once, just freaking once, I'd like someone to come to me and say, you know what Jessica, I appreciate you, I appreciate all the hard work and the dedication you have shown to my practice. For that, I'm going to reward you with a raise. Not, oh gee, ok, she's been here a while, I guess I have to, or, oh gee, someone is paying her more, I guess I have to pay the same, or, gosh, she might leave, I better bribe her to stay with more money. I'm sick of being shit on and taken advantage of in both my personal and professional lives. I believe there are two types of people in the world, givers and takers. I'm a giver. Always have been. I give and give and give some more. And people around me seem to take and take. I don't know.

And the real kick in the ass was hearing on the radio news today that Celine Dion is being paid a reported 11 million dollars for her Air Canada Ad Campaign. I'm so writing those jackass yahoos a letter. Bastards.

I'm going to bed."

"event","Wow. The discussion of high school days at the Jazz Odyssey board took me back to those times. My father was in the Canadian Armed Forces. We moved a lot. Yup, I'm a certified base brat. In the summer of 1988, my father was posted to a small military base in the Ottawa Valley. CFB Petawawa. We had lived there for 6 years before moving to CFB Trenton for 2 years. This time, my parents decided to move to a small town 15 -20 minutes away called Chalk River. Home to one of Canada's largest nuclear power plants. And coincidentally enough, it also has the highest rate of breast cancer in all of Ottawa and it's surrounding areas. Coincidentally my ass. It also has the most ridiculous amount of left handed people. I have nothing against lefties, my mom is one, as is my Grandmother. I should have been one myself. What I find freaky is that most of the left handed population in Canada live in Chalk River.

Chalk River is a town where everyone is born and raised. They weren't very used to new people coming in. Deep River was about 10 minutes up the highway. Turns out the dirt bag loser trouble kids lived in Chalk River, they were called 'bushies'. Never did figure that one out. The kids in Deep River were the preppies. We've all heard that term before, right?

Anyhow, I was 15 years old and starting Grade 11 that fall. The first day of school, my 9 year old brothers caught the bus at the same stop as me. Being the first day, and not yet moved into our new house, my mom drove us in from Petawawa to the bus stop in Chalk River and waited while we caught our respective busses. Did I ever take a ribbing for this. I am a very shy person. I just got on the bus and sat in the first available seat, which was in the front. I could hear snickering and laughing and people saying, awe, did your mommy take you to catch the bus today. These people didn't even know me. Also against me was the fact I dressed up a bit for the first day. Big mistake. I was teased the whole bus ride to school for that.

So, for the first couple of weeks, I had a lot of trouble meeting people because I was so introverted. I was more used to the military bases where almost everyone was new all the time. It was so easy to make friends with people who also knew the joys of military life and moving around. I kept to myself, and would just take my lunch into town with me and walk around. Sometimes I hid in the library. It was awful. I was so uncomfortable. In Canada, we do something called The Terry Fox Run every year at the beginning of school to raise money for cancer research. I walked by myself for this. That is until half way through a guy, Ken Sauve, came up and started to talk to me. He was nice of enough, invited me to detour to his house. We get to his house and he starts trying to make out with me. I freaked out and ran like bloody hell. I got lost and was late getting back to school. The next day this guy spreads a rumour around about me that I had Syphilis. Very nice.

The bus rides were awful. There was a group of girls who hated me so much. Especially after I got a job at the local variety store. They told me the jobs should be reserved for real locals, not kids of pongo's (a derogartory term used to describe military personnel). Sometimes they sat behind me and kept saying, go back to where you came from, no one wants you here, no one likes you, you're ugly. Once they got off the bus and followed me home picking up small rocks and pebbles and pelting me. Another time they corned me against the school wall and all took turns spitting in my hair. 

In English class, we used to have to keep journals. One was based on happenings in the news, the other was personal. I wrote a lot of stuff in there I was feeling. Well, a group of guys got a hold of it, photocopied it, and pinned up pages of it all over the school. It was humiliating. 

The really kicker was when a real popular guy decides to ask me to the Christmas formal. My parents really wanted me to go. I wasn't keen. I decided to say no, which I'm glad I did because the whole thing turned out to be a joke.

The worst thing that happened was the killing of my pet rabbit. I kept him inside usually, but I also had a large pen built outside for him. I stayed late after school one day and came home to my rabbit dead and mutilated. The next day, someone taped one of his ears to my locker. 

As soon as I turned 16, I got my driver's license and bought my own car. A 1985 Hyundi Pony. A big rust bucket of a car, but it took me to school and back. I spent the rest of Grade 11, 12 and 13 working 40+ hours a week and doing homework. It was great. I saved up a lot of money, got excellent grades and worked my way through college. What happened in High School doesn't really affect me now. I'm ok with it strangely enough. I feel sorry for the people who picked on me. I've run into a few on occasion that act like nothing happened. Harmless fun apparently. 

I think I turned out ok. I've done well for myself. I'm still shy, but I have some friends. I've always been partial to having a few close friends rather than a large group of friends. My heart breaks for anyone who had to experience any kind of bullying in school. What is happening with kids today? What are parents teaching them? Where does the blame lie? I hesitate to have children for fear my child will either be picked on, or I will raise some kind of monster bully. Of course I could also raise a future Prime Minister of Canada :) Who knows. I just wish there was a way to solve this outbreak of bullying in the world. 

Sigh."

"event","DISCLAIMER: The following journal entry may contain language that some readers may find offensive, reader discretion is advised.

Also, this is a very, very, very long entry. Please feel free to skip to the end.

For the last fifteen plus years, my summer vacations have been spent at a cottage in the Ottawa Valley. Thompsons' Campground in Clayton Lake, Ontario to be exact. A family owned and operated campground that had several neat cottages right on the water. For 2 weeks every summer, my Grandparents would rent out a cottage where we, my mom, my brothers and myself, would meet up with my mom's younger brother from Nova Scotia, my uncle/Godfather, Jeff (whom my own brother, Jeff, is named after). Usually along for the ride was his wife, Sherry, and their two kids, Tamera, 16, and Brittany, 18. My mom's cousins would all get out there as well over the course of the two weeks. It was like a family reunion. My Grandpa had a small motor boat he'd bring out. We'd tube, fish, have campfires, and, well, in true Martin family fashion, party hard. We had a lot of great times there.

Even after moving out West 5 years ago, I still made a point of flying back east almost every summer for the cottage visit. The only one I missed was last summer. My brother Jeff was getting married in September and I used up all my holidays helping to plan the wedding etc. This year, my mom wasn't going to go because she couldn't afford it. One night we played some Trivial Pursuit while consuming several alcoholic beverages. We got to talking and I said screw it, I'll pay for your plane ticket as a birthday gift. So, all liquored up, I booked her a ticket online.

Thank God I did this. Thank sweet mother of God. My mom flew down a week before I did. This year was a little different. This year my cousins took on summer jobs in Nova Scotia and didn't come down. So for a week and a half, my mom had spent a lot of time with my Uncle and Sherry. She brought our dog Malcolm, down. He picked her up from the airport, they got lost, so funny. The two of them are so much alike. The way they walk, talk, their mannerisms, their poor sense of direction. They look alike. They both are the spitting image of my Grandpa. Their older Brother Bob is so different. Neither Jeff or my mom got a long very well with Bob. Me? Well, I flew down almost a week later. But instead of going to the cottage, I met up with my friend Tabitha in Toronto. There, we caught a train to New York City for a BNL concert in Jones Beach. We spent a few days there and then came back. My mom and Grandpa picked me up at 2 am Monday morning in Kingston. My Aunt Sherry and Uncle Jeff were due to head back home on Wednesday. So that left me with two days to spend with them. They ended up taking the cottage for only one week seeing as it was just mainly the three of them. Even the cousins didn't visit much this time around. Instead they had a big family dinner (which I missed being in NYC) at my Grandparents place.

So, for two days, we played cards, had some rum and cokes, looked through old photo's etc. Sherry, my mom, Grandma and I went shopping on the last afternoon, while my Grandpa and Uncle Jeff went fishing. When Jeff and Sherry left Wednesday morning, my Uncle was crying. He didn't want to leave. Long story short, my Aunt and cousins were monsters who treated my uncle badly in the last few years. My oldest cousin was always in trouble with the law. A high school drop out. The other one dreams of being a porn star. My aunt believed in something called Liberal Parenting. She did not believe in raising your voice to kids, punishing them, or spanking of any kind. Some other time I'll emphasize. Long story short, my uncle wasn't happy. We had been trying to get him to move out west for a while. He is an electrician by trade, and that is very much in demand here in BC. He was giving it some serious thought. He promised to come visit. Ontario was always his home. But Sherry was from Nova Scotia and refused to leave. Jeff was a very shy, timid man.

So they left. A few days later, on Saturday, July 24th, my mom and I flew back to BC. I had tickets to the Auburn, Wa BNL concert for the next day. So, life goes on as normal. My mom says Jeff sure looked great didn't he? He had lost some weight he had in his belly. He said this past winter was the first time he was able to shovel the driveway without getting winded. He and Sherry had been walking nearly every night. My mom kept meaning to call him and ask how their trip home was. I went back to work on the Thursday, my mom went back on Saturday, July 31st. My brothers flew back to Ontario the day before to see their father (he's my father too, but only by blood). So that Saturday, I had this weird urge to check my phone messages. I called from work on my lunch hour, only to get a message from my Grandpa that went like this: Oh, hi Joan (my mom's name), it's Dad here, look, I guess you've heard the news by now, Jeffery's passed away, Joan, your mom's a real mess here, look, could you please call as soon as you get this message. I remember the message word for word like it was yesterday. A wave pf panic shot through me, and the first thought that entered my mind was my brother Jeff. My Grandfather's message didn't sink in at all, it made no sense. Stupidly, I called my mom at Wendy's where she works, and repeated it. She went silent and then I said, wait, I must have heard something wrong, and I said I'd call back. Apparently Monica, my sister in law, had to calm my mom down because she thought of my brother, her son, as well. Monica assured her she just talked to him on the phone 5 minutes prior.

Funny, neither one of us thought of my uncle immediately. I called my Grandpa right away and was delivered the most horrible news I'd received since a beloved employer of mine died a few years ago. I've never seen/heard my Grandfather cry in almost 31 years of existence. When he told me, all I could say was, Jeff who? And my Grandpa said, Jeffery, my son. God. I still cry when I remember all this. My son. 

The hardest thing I've ever had to do was tell my mom her brother died. It turns out, the family was planning a day at the beach. My uncle went in his truck with his beloved dog, Hillary. My aunt took the car with Brittany to pick up Britt's friend LeeAnn. When they got to the beach, they saw my uncle had put the boat in the water, and had the inner tube sitting behind the truck, not blown up. They went to the truck and my uncle was sitting inside it, with it running and the air conditioning on. My aunt was sure he was sleeping. She even laughed to herself when she realized he was drooling and would be so upset to know LeeAnn saw him drool. But after banging on the window, she realized something terrible was wrong. She grabbed some lady's cell phone, called 911 and yelled for help. An off duty fire fighter was there and proceeded to get my uncle out of the truck and start CPR. It was too late. He lost bladder control and was already discolouring. Turns out he had blockage in his arteries, and that by some complete fluke, a piece of the plaque build up chipped off and lodged itself in a vessel, stopping his heart. We figure he suddenly didn't feel well and went into the truck with the air conditioning. The one consolation we got is that it was quick, and that he likely didn't feel very much. He just turned 46. He just celebrated his 25th wedding anniversary. 

So what does this all have to do with Air Canada you ask? Well, I'll tell you. I had to get my mother on a flight back east immediately. So, I called Air Canada, explained the situation and got my mom on a flight that night. It was so hard to send her off alone, a week after we just got back. I then had to get myself back, and my sister in law came as well.  Now, I have always been a dedicated Air Canada flier. I hate flying with a passion. Loathe it. But, over the years, when I had to fly, I always went with Air Canada. Always. In the month of July alone, I spent nearly $3500.00 on air fare for my whole family for summer holidays. So, I book my mom's ticket, and am shocked when I'm told it's $1100.00. Whatever, she just needed to get back. the ticket agent at the Kelowna airport actually had the nerve to tell me that the high fee was the penalty for booking last minute. My 46 year old uncle just dropped dead, sorry it wasn't planned you moron. Fine, the fact was, we had to get back. 

My sister in law and I flew in very early Wednesday morning, arriving just in time for the wake/funeral. Neither my mom's or our flights were sold out. On mine and Monica's Calgary to Toronto flight, they double booked my seat and we were bumped up to first class. Big freaking deal. Monica and I came back Friday. Wow, $1100 for 2 days of crying and sadness. On our Vancouver to Kelowna flight, we were 5 minutes away from landing when the pilot announces we are turning back to Vancouver due to mechanical problems. I freaked. All these scenarios played in my head. I thought I'd see an engine on fire, or a wing fall off. Turned out to be minor, but I'm still at a loss as to why they didn't drop us off first then go back. So, after convincing me not to take a bus back, Air Canada, being the generous folks that they are, gave us each a $10 lunch voucher. Yes, ten whole freaking dollars. So, we drank 3 coronas each and got back safe and sound.

So, after everyone got back, and got over the shock of what happened, I mailed our boarding passes along with the death certificate, to Air Canada. Four weeks later, I get my reply. We are sorry to inform you that after careful review, we are unable to provide you with any reimbursement of your plane tickets. We are sorry for your loss, however, you did receive our special bereavement fare, blah, blah, blah. Their so-called bereavement fare was nearly double the cost of our 'regular' fare, which, I might add, was purchased for travel during high season. Bastards.

I've slowly calmed down. Life goes on. But, I'm watching TV last night and what do I see? Air Canada's new ad campaign, featuring none other than Canada's golden girl, Celine Dion. They have new uniforms. They paid this woman an 'undisclosed sum' of money to be their spokesperson. This absolutely sickens me. Disgusts me. They were near chapter 11 bankruptcy. They couldn't give me a break on a compassionate flight. But boy oh boy, they could pay this woman, who can't possibly need more money, to sing her skinny french white ass off for their new ads? WTF?

I'm pissed off. And I'll be telling them so in a letter. They won't give a rat's ass, but I'll get some satisfaction from telling them I'll be flying alternate airlines from here on in. Assholes. They got into trouble because they are greedy. They have spent the last couple of years going after small airlines and running them out of business. First they bought out Canadian Airlines, then they ruined Canada 3000. They then tried to run out Westjet, and they nearly folded because of their greed. The employees took pay cuts, people were laid off, passengers picked up the extra costs. They profited off tragedy ie, increased security fees because of 9/11 (I never saw this so called extra security), ridiculous compassionate fares, etc. But they can pay Celine Dion? I'd be pissed if I worked for the company.

Sigh. They won't care about little ole me. But I plan to try. It's so disheartening, you know? It's not the money. I'd trade all the money to have my uncle back. It's just the principal. So, that's the end of my rant. I apologize if you are now confused, sad, or just plain bored. I didn't mean to spill out the whole story, but once I started typing, it just came out. Thanks for reading. Hopefully I'll have something happier to post about soon."

"event","So we were discussing our upcoming Christmas party at work on Wednesday. First off, the girls thought it would be funny to inform me that I was voted designated driver for that evening. Ha! I told them they better have a back up plan. They know me too well from previous Christmas parties. I'm actually surprised they are having me along after last years' fiasco. The Vernon Dental Association made the grave mistake of holding the holiday festivities on the eve of my 30th birthday. Let's just say Jessica did a little double celebrating that night, and it wasn't pretty. I don't think either Dr. Ree or Dr. Henry would own up to me being their employee to anyone at the party. Ah well, it was fun, despite talking to ralph on the big white phone for several hours.

Ok, getting off topic here. So the girls asked me casually if I would be bringing someone to the party this year. Seeing as I have not done so for the last 5 years, I simply stated nope. They asked why? They said they knew someone, blah, blah, blah. Ok, be warned, I'm about to lead into a rant here.

I have been single for a very long time. In my nearly 31 years of existence, I have had a total of two relationships. The first one was when I was 19 years old. There was this guy named Rob who worked for Pepsi Canada. I worked at a variety store and I knew him from years of delivering products. My boss at the store was constantly giving him my phone number. So I went away to college for Dental Assisting, and on the weekends my girlfriend and I would come home to go clubbing. Every weekend I would run into Rob at the club we frequented, Sassy's. My friend gave Rob our number in Ottawa and he called. That was the start of it. For the next nearly 3 years we had a relationship, albeit on and off. It was not a healthy relationship to say the least. I don't want to get into detail right now, but let's just say that the demise of the relationship came during the reception of my friends wedding, where I served as a bridesmaid. Rob was very jealous and possessive. He was also a heavy drinker. We were fighting all night. I was upset and a friend of the groom's, Chris, was trying to make me laugh and cheer me up. Rob did not like this and well, it resulted in me being dragged off the dance floor by my hair and a huge fight erupting where he called me every derogatory name in the book in front of everyone. The next day all my tires were slashed. I ended it permanently the next day.

Enter Chris, the guy from the wedding. He waited until things calmed down. After about 2 months he called me and we started dating. I thought he was the perfect guy. A real gentleman. Cook me romantic dinners, very affectionate, held doors open for me, kind, curtious, you name it. Everything you ever wanted in a guy. Well, about 5 months into the relationship, he stopped calling for a week. Then he called and asked me to meet him for coffee and desert. He broke up with me. Said it wasn't working, blah, blah, blah. I found out a short while later he had actually met someone else. Looking back, I'm surprised he kept dating me for as long as he did. I was very passive at that point. I wanted him to make all the decisions on what we did, when we did. I never took any initiative to plan anything. I was just very immature at that point. He was 29 and I was 22. But it hurt.

Now, I don't hold any grudges. I'm not a man hater. I believe there are tons of decent, worthy guys out there. I am just not interested in dating. I do not want a relationship. I do not see marriage in my future at this point. When I think of marriage, I think of having a second income and that's it. What's my problem you ask? My problem is that everyone else thinks this isn't normal. People, co-workers, friends, family, my patients for crying out loud, think I need someone. I'm sick and tired of people wanting to fix me up. Believe me, I don't have trouble finding people. I have been asked out more times then I care to keep count of. I meet people everywhere. Great people. Good looking guys. Guys with money. You name it. I'm just not interested. And I don't understand why everyone thinks that I just tell myself that.

I like my freedom and independence. I have worked my ass off over the years to get my career going. I'm self supporting. I make good money and I've done well for myself considering where I came from. I want to travel. I want to pick up and go when I want, where I want, without having to consider someone else's feelings or schedules. I do not want a boyfriend. Why can't people accept that? I'm tired of answering questions on it. I'm sick of my patients asking. What really pisses me off is when people say, oh, well, so, are you gay then? WTF? First off, it's none of their business. Second off, why assume I'm gay just because I don't want a boyfriend? That's pretty pompous if you ask me.

This has been a common battle for me over the years. When I moved here I told everyone that I had just gotten out of a relationship before moving out and was enjoying my single life. I didn't tell them it had been a few years. Now, I've been here for almost 5 years and people are starting to wonder why I'm still single. I'm running out of things to say about it. I'm tired of saying I just don't want that in my life right now. I'm basically tired of having to explain myself to people, over and over. But in the same sense, I can't be rude or straight forward and just say bug off, it's none of your business. Sigh. So I guess that's my own fault and I'll have to deal with that. But I just wanted to vent. It's been bugging me since last Wednesday. 

I feel a bit better now. Thanks for reading :)"

The Tragically Hip - It's A Good Life If You Don't Weaken

I love this song. As a matter of fact, I love this entire CD. The owner of the Wendy's in Vernon, where my sister in law is a manager, gets a slew of concert tickets to any show you can think of that's in town. It's how I got BNL tickets when they guys came through Kelowna this past March 31st. I'm hoping that he can get me some Hip tickets. They are playing next month in Kelowna, and I'd love to see the show. I'm reflecting back on all the concerts I've seen. I can't remember them all, but there are some of the bands I've seen:

Gowan (my first concert ever, I was 13)
Chris de Burgh
Aerosmith, with Sound Garden opening
Milli Vanilli (how embarassing is that?)
Rolling Stones
Pursuit of Happiness (Obscure Canadian Band)
Meatloaf (saw him twice)
Madonna 
Celine Dion
Boys II Men (Destiny's Child, Mya and Uncle Sam opened)
Billy Joel and Elton John (a joint tour)
Elton John (here in Kelowna 2 years ago)
Rod Stewart
Amanda Marshall, Jann Arden & The Moffats (all Canadian, a benefit concert here in Vernon)
Matchbox 20 (Lifehouse opened)
Tragically Hip
Nazareth
Don Henley
BNL
BNL and Alanis (Twice in one week!)

There are more I'm sure. But I can't think of them right now. There's been so many. I love live music. Ok, ok, Milli Vanilli turned out not to be live, but I was 15, what can I say? It seemed like a good idea at the time.

This is turning out to be a pretty useless entry in my journal. I was going to write about some dark stuff that went on this summer, but the music changed my mood. It's probably not a good idea to get into death and dying right before bed anyhow. I've been battling insomnia lately, that's the last thing I need keeping me awake. 

Hmmmmmm, there's a spell check on this puppy. Cool. i'm going to try it out and sign off for now. Maybe I'll get a little more serious tomorrow.

let's get friendship right, get life day to day........Find somewhere to go, go somewhere we're needed, find somewhere to grow, grow somewhere we're needed.........."

"event","AIM sucks. Sucks the big one. I kept getting booted from chat last night and finally gave up. So what did I do? I went out to a club instead. There's this band from town called The Young'uns. They are an awsome cover band. They play everything from CCR to Sublime. It's a three piece band, drummer, guitarist and bass  player. They all sing. The guitarist is a patient of mine and a friend of my boss's. Anyhow, they rock. I managed to squeeze in about 6 killer koolaid cocktails and 5 china white shooters. I also managed to win a hundred bucks playing black jack. There was a crew of people over painting my living room yesterday and I had bought them a couple of cases of beer as a thank you. Needless to say, they were feeling quite good when I got home from work.

So reading Lori's journal this morning brought back some memories for me. I'm a base brat. My dad was in the Canadian Armed Forces. He just retired this past summer. We moved quite a bit. I was born in Ottawa, Ontario. Spent a few years there til my dad enlisted when I was 2. We were then posted to Ormocto, New Brunswick. I spent 7 years there, and my brothers, identicle twins, were born there. We moved to Petawawa, Ontario when I was 10. That's in the Ottawa valley. Spent 5 years there, moved to Trenton, Ontario, which is about 2 hours East of Toronto. Two years there. then back to Petawawa where my parents bought a house in a small Town 20 minutes away called Chalk River. Home of one of Canada's largest nuclear power plants. My parents permanently split when I was 17. I moved to Ottawa to attend college at 19. I took dental assisting. I moved back to Chalk River to help my mom and brothers out financially, working as a CDA for three years before moving to Toronto to take the dental hygiene program. Moved back to Chalk River for one year before packing up and heading west. The jobs in my field are here. I moved in with friends, then to an apartment, then to a rental house, then I bought my first home in March of 2003. Now I'm thinking of selling my house. Who knows. 

Long story short, I've moved alot.

Ok, that concludes this installment of welcome to Jessica's world. I'm now off to have another cup of coffee and make a serious attempt at cleaning my house. Good luck with the packing Lori!"

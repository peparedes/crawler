"event","Well, a fair few days later and I am back in the land of the living.  My course of super-strong antibiotics left me with sleepless nights and some odd hallucinations, but have mostly fixed me.  I still can't feel some of my face and I am a touch tender - but I no longer look hamster-esque.  I hope.

I am also house moved - which was an epic undertaking, feeling as I did (awful).  Thankfully I had Liz (and Jam and Bob with a car big enough for my bookshelf a bit later on) to help, which was splendid.  Without Liz appearing in the morning and providing excellent advice, hard labour and good cheer, I would have collapsed in a little tearful heap at about 11am.  Thank you missus :) 

I am now pretty much settled in and I made a cake yesterday, to check the oven worked.  It looked a bit like this..

..and cheered me up no end.  I supplemented it by watching some Firefly and 'Zombieland'.  Good times.

Much love to you all.  There will be a housewarming soon (28th August) which I hope you can all come to.

"event","I have the toothache and it's making me grumpy and twitchy.  It kept me up last night and woke me up this morning.  I bloody hate teeth sometimes.  Actually, a lot of the time, for various reasons.  I'm going through the list of possible things it could be and I've whittled it down to a possible infection in a tooth I had filled a couple of months ago.  This is bad, because infections are things that tend not to go away easily.  Bah, bloody humbug.

I am 200 miles away from my Dentist and I'm moving house at the weekend.  Now would be a good time not to have pus forming in the middle of a molar, you know?

Trying to write a report and failing.  Listening to Radio 4 though and it's soothing me slightly.

Sometimes, I still can't quite believe that David Cameron is my Prime Minister.  Every time I look at him, I think 'skin covered reptilian'."

"event","I'm not a big fan of change.  Change often irks, upsets or saddens me.  My family are well aware of this, but they like to exploit it for their amusement.  A few years ago for example, I came home from University and my Mum had replaced the front door, with no warning.  Not the colour of the door, not the locks, but the door in its entirety.  I felt completely bereft.  And they all laughed at me - from behind the living room window, of course..

So, imagine how I felt looking at the BBC news website this morning.  Well.  I was unimpressed.  Suddenly it's all big bouncy text and too-prominent pictures.  It's all 'Lookie over here!  Here's another lovely picture! Don't read the words!'.  I mean, the words themselves are fine, but I just don't trust them any more.  My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.  Clearly.

I know I sound curmudgeonly.  I don't care.  I'm fine with most medical and technological advances, just not with anything else.

"event","I woke up to the sound of rain and wind this morning, and it was with much glee I snuggled down further into my sleeping bag, knowing that today was not a site day.  No standing in the rain for this fair weather archaeologist!  Not today, anyways.  Instead I am ""working"" at the computer, mostly calculating my mileage.  I get 35p a mile, and I have driven Carlos about 500 miles for work alone over the two weeks.  W00tzor.  I'll be rich, rich beyond my wildest dreams.

I am suffering from an aching heart unfortunately, that can't be cheered by mere mileage claims forms.  I bought the Firefly box-set at the weekend, and have now only got two episodes left to watch.  I wanted to watch them last night, but I have rationed myself to one a night to prolong it.  This is really difficult to do though.  And I can't see how the series can end already, there's so much to find out, to watch unfold.  Do Kaylee and Simon finally kiss?  Do Inara and Mal admit there might be some romantic feelings there?  (Could I be any more of a girl? Tut.) Do we find out what's going on with the men with blue hands?  Gah.  I can't bear it.  And mostly, I can't bear it because I know it's finite.  Woe, pure woe.

But I suppose it's fueling hours of daydreaming, which is nice.  Being an lone archaeologist smuggling a precious artefact across space aboard Serenity (for some noble, if illegal reason) sounds like fun.  

I think I might do that for a bit.. *dreams*"

"event","It was with some trepidation I set off to Finchampstead this morning.  I had been assured by my employer that I was needed at 8am, to meet with the site officials to talk about 'health' and 'safety', before watching a machine strip off the topsoil from an inordinately large field.  Ha.  

Firstly, it's not me that needs a talk about health and safety - it's the several billion mentalist white-van drivers using the M40 and M4 today.  Secondly, <i>there was no one on site</i>.  The field was eerily empty of all the things one would expect - a site hut, a big earth moving machine, contractors drinking tea and so on.  The only sign of human activity was a shiny new padlock on a gate and some road irons positioned strategically across the field.

Really needing a wee (Too much information? No such thing!) I was in a bit of a quandary.  Since, of course, I had arrived at site earlier than anyone would be in the office back in Oxford and this meant I couldn't check if I had got something wrong (like the location).  And I couldn't use any facilities on-site, since there were none!  What a delightful position to be in.

Luckily, I managed to look confused (or pained) enough on the side of the road to attract the attention of some kind townspeople.  I was ushered into a kitchen by a man cutting a hedge, and given tea and a bathroom to visit.  And a dog called Rosie to stroke.  I discovered that this man was called Derek and the land was his as of yesterday - he'd been forced to sell the land, interestingly, it was by a forced purchase order - but he'd not seen anyone doing anything to the site.  Well, nothing other than putting a padlock on the gate that was still technically his, preventing him getting his cattle feeders out.  

A real professional bunch we're dealing with here, can you tell? :D

After three hours of waiting around, it was revealed that the contractors had changed their mind about turning up today, but forgot to tell anyone.  I would have found out sooner, but our 'in the know' contact at the council was late into work - which impressed me, since he's supposed to start work at an already generous 10am.  Yep, 10am.  Two hours after I was already on site, having driven 60 miles in London-bound traffic to get there.

So, I left Finchampstead, just in time to see Derek and son getting around the 'padlock' situation by literally taking the gate and associated fence posts down.  The site was suddenly very accessible.

Brilliant :D"

"event","Well, today started with being woken up at 7am by one of the Housemates having a bath.  No, I don't know why there was so much noise involved in that.  Maybe he's summoning some older God or horrific demon in there.  Who knows?  But it did inspire me to wake up, eat a sausage sandwich (free sausages from a over-meated BBQ last week.  Win!) and get ready for the day ahead nice and early.

So, I have been to the Post Office to send off some eBay things, been to the library to return books (and get flustered when a good looking guy deigned to smile at me) and copied a whole metric fuck-tonne of CDs before I take them to a charity shop. I have also had lunch with Bob, given him presents and some horrid, horrid whiskey.  But he didn't seem to think it was as bad as I did.  Weird.

Realisations I have had today:

1) I like archaeology more than I like my PhD.  By a long way.
2) The crushes I develop are always a touch inconvenient or strange.
3) I have too much stuff.  I want to go all zen and shed all my possessions.  
4) I like my possessions too much to do that.
5) Having just painted my nails red, I look like I've dipped my fingertips into a carcass.  
6) Eating less cake might make me happier in the long run.

Having said the word cake though, all I want is spongey chocolate goodness.

Butterfly chicken.  Interesting phrase that.

I left work in Oxford at 3.30pm (having already done a full days work).  I arrived, at my door in Sheffield, at 9.50pm.  I did about 150 miles in that time, with a break in the middle of an hour or so whilst I popped by a family members' house in Tamworth for a cuppa.  I'm practically braindead now.   It's not nice when the M1 becomes a car park.  And when all the roads north from Junction 20 become little car parks too. 

I want a hug.

And some food.  And some wine.  And shiny things.  And a nice bloody house to come home to.

I'm not upset about it per se - whatever happened at J20 must have been far worse for some people than my day was for me.  But.. I still want nice things and warmth.  Yes."

I have succeeded in travelling south.  The sun was blistering hot, but my faithful steed Carlos dealt with the weather remarkably well.  Once or twice he shuddered 'neath me, as we battled against the great wheeled behemoths of the Em-Won, but together we managed the journey well enough.  I'll do that thing with his dipstick tomorrow morning that he likes, as a little thank-you to him.  

My lodgings are simple, but sufficient for my needs.  After greeting the men who are to employ me, I conducted my background research on the graveyard I am to visit tomorrow.  There are stories of strange men intent on desecrating the holy ground, demolishing walls and doing unspeakable things to the gate of the church.  We have it on good authority that corpses will be uncovered at some point, an undeniable danger in this part of the world, where the ritual beheading of the dead shortly after the last breath has only very recently been mandated by law.

The place I am to visit is called Marsh Gibbon.  So named, one assumes, after the dance.  I truly hope I have the strength to combat whatever terrors I encounter tomorrow.  I do not want to fail this task.

I have no further news at present, I will report again tomorrow."

I'll need it when Housemate no.1 starts rutting (in about 20 minutes, I suspect) with the (brunette) ladyfriend. 

I had both ear-plugs last night when Housemate no.2 and friends were stamping up and down the stairs at 4am, but now.. just one left.  But still two ears!

Shall find something else to stick in my ear methinks.  Maybe some kind of vicious looking assassin spike thingy.  

Nope.  No spikes.  It's all Indiana Jones tomorrow, after all.  Must be positive.

Even through the best efforts of people like <lj user=""edy_"">, <lj user=""bonedancer""> and <lj user=""caerban""> - I just wasn't having any of it.  That was, until <lj user=""cheesymoments""> <i>literally</i> frogmarched me to a TV and forced me to sit there and watch it.  Forced me, red wine in hand, to sit there through the first three episodes.  Terrible, I know.

But dammit!  It was awesome.  I have that slightly giddy, obsessive feeling about it that I sometimes get - where I might think about nothing else for a month or so.  It's got all you need - characters to identify with (for example, so far Mal has killed all the people I was shouting at to be shot asap) and characters to swoon over (what's that, a sinister looking Doctor character with a secret? Well, hello!) and splendid dialogue.

But why am I telling you this?  Most of you are about 8 years ahead of me. 

Remind me to listen to you earlier next time.  Ahem. 

I saw this, this morning and it made me smile - maybe it'll make you smile too..

Things I like about his email:
*  That him being a Reverend is introduced early on, to lend some kind of trustworthy validity to the email.
*  The oh so plausible 'I've gone to West Africa to live, but I've left everything in this flat, including my computer and all the utilities still running' story.
*  The idea that rent isn't important at all and really they just want a nice tenant (I wouldn't mind a nice Tennant myself tbh..)
*  That he needs a picture of me before deciding if I am a good tenant or not.
*  That I can only view the flat 'from the outside' before living there.

I'm going to reply to it, making myself sound like a dumb millionaire.  Let's see if he wants my bank details/a deposit to secure this mysterious flat next, eh? ;)

In other news, karate was awesome.  I'm going to miss it so much whilst I'm away down south.  Still, the skeletons will make up for it, I'm sure.  Mmm.  Skeletons.

And!  This is a <strike>dead</strike> sleepy squirrel that was bought into the lab today:

"event","I had a meeting with a dentist yesterday to talk Research.  Dentists always make me super paranoid about my teeth oddly enough, so I try not to smile too much.  However, I can't help smiling, because it's what my face does most of the time.  It's like a tick.

(I went on a date with a very tall, ginger dentist once.  He wore purple leather trousers.  Fun facts for you..)

Anyway, I am relieved to say that it doesn't seem to have gone too badly, since the dentist accidentally sent me an email intended for another dentist (unless he bcc'd the other person, but it doesn't seem to make sense if he'd done that) in which he described me as <i>""a delightful PhD student in Archaeology...""</i>.  Oh yeah, delightful.  Not moronic!  And in his subsequent email to me he asked if I liked the idea of a collaboration at some point.

No, not in a sleazy way.. :P  Although thinking about it, I might use that as a chat up line one day.

It's very quiet here today.

The landlord of the beautiful, cheap, friendly house I was going to move into on the 15th July just phoned to say that his ex-wife has moved into the house with no warning and everything has gone horribly wrong for him.  

Ergo, no new house for me.  

I was fairly cheerful and upbeat to him on the phone, as he sounded pretty devastated.  But wow.

Sitting here, looking around at my room, in my not-so-nice house, getting quite tearful.  Very annoying.

What do I do? I have a week until I have to go away and work for a month, by which time my contract runs out on this place.

"event","<b>A Japanese capsule containing samples of the Itokawa asteroid is being linked to a number of incidences of violence in the Australian outback, local people report.  </b>

The capsule landed at round 1351 GMT on Sunday, before a special response team from the Japanese space agency (Jaxa) came in by helicopter to remove it to a secure location.  However, a team stationed at the control centre in the Woomara Prohibited Area have announced that the capsule was not brought to them on Sunday evening, and radio contact has since been lost.  

The capsule produced a spectacular fireball in the Australian night sky, with many local people and reporters travelling towards the landing site. A user named <i>@MadDogMcBonza</i> on the microblogging site Twitter posted a comment at 1450 GMT saying 'Streuth! Just found the Jap capsule - bloody thing looks like the south end of a north bound horse!' indicating that the capsule was visibly damaged on re-entry.  There have been no further 'tweets' from this user.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/just_linzi/pic/00027h2t/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/just_linzi/pic/00027h2t/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""178"" border='0'/></a>
<small>Image linked from @MadDogMcBonza's Twitter account, showing the broken capsule.</small>

Hazy mobile phone footage, apparently taken soon after however and uploaded to video sharing website YouTube, shows what appears to be an altercation taking place between two men near the crater site.  The clip ends rather suddenly, with the uploader shouting 'Crikey!' before turning away from the capsule location and running.  Other similar short video clips have filtered through to the Australian news outlets.  All of them show acts of sudden, unexpected violence from people near the area of the landed capsule and its distinctive parachute.

Roger Jumping from the <i>Maralinga Post</i> was observing the scene from a news helicopter, noting how 'this Japanese mission has been fraught with technical difficulties from the start' before exclaiming 'Stone the flaming crows... they're all...[unintelligible] bloody everywhere... my God... covered in [radio noise]'.  All contact was lost with Mr Jumping and his team at 1530GMT.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/just_linzi/pic/00028rb8/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/just_linzi/pic/00028rb8/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""178"" border='0'/></a>
<small>One of the last photos from the capsule site.</small>

The Australian army has been called in to investigate and secure the scene, which they promise they will do as soon as they've found some equipment to use and found someone sober enough to drive.

The case bears some similarities to an incident in Pennsylvania, USA in 1968 in which unprecedented violence broke out in a rural community.  Typically deadly force, including shots to the chest, could not stop those affected from carrying out murderous impulses.  Scientists explained this outbreak as a result of radioactive contamination from a space probe that had recently exploded on contact with the Earth's atmosphere.  Sheriff McClelland, a survivor from the Pennsylvania incident said 'Damn well hope to God this aint what it looks like, you folks will all be dead by the weekend if it is.' when asked for his thoughts on the matter.

"event","I had a really odd dream last night, featuring my teeth being full of gaping holes and a stream running through a house I wanted to live in.  I'm fairly sure these are anxiety dreams about a) my PhD and b) my current search for somewhere to live (using my almost Freudian like powers of psychological interpretation..)  It's all very complicated and sadly it can't be resolved by my normal method of dealing with personal problems - ignoring them til they go away.  Pesky.

Have been offered work down south in July, digging up dead people (project officer and osteologist, sounds swish huh?) and I am really looking forward to it.  It's time to top up the freckle tan a little.  Although, now that I've said that, watch July be the wettest on record.

In other news, <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/science_and_environment/10284925.stm"">this article</a> made me feel a little more secure about my frequent lack of mental prowess.  I've often noticed that I can't spot big changes in landscapes and cityscapes.  If a shop changes ownership and function, I won't notice, despite walking past in every day for a week.  If something gets painted a markedly different colour, I don't usually notice until it gets pointed out.  Luckily this is called 'change blindness' and happens to us all, it's all about how our brains respond to contrast and viewing attention (i.e. what initially grabs our attention about a place or a person).  

Luckily, it provides an easy and evolutionarily based explanation for why you might not have noticed a loved ones new hair style.  Phew."

Maybe they're trying to make it more homely, or perhaps, just perhaps, they can't bear the idea that there is a regularly used web page out there that isn't adding to our day-to-day sensory overload.

Perhaps they are trying to encourage us to use it as a modern-day version of a desk based photograph of a loved one - because nothing says 'I love you darling!' more than typing in phrases like 'free hot man on man porn' over your husband's face, right?

"event","Yesterday, as a special treat to myself, I bought a newspaper.  I know that doesn't seem like much of a treat, but I like doing crosswords <i>in real life</i> occasionally, since I can't cheat with sneaky Google searches and I like the challenge.  And yes, I know, I'm only cheating myself when I do that.. :P

One of the stories on the front page made me very sad however, and as it's a story I've been following for a while so I thought I would rant about it a little.  

<lj-cut text=""All you need is love?"">
A couple in Malawi, Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga (who is transgendered and identifies himself as a woman) had a 'symbolic' marriage a few months ago, for which they were subsequently arrested and charged with gross indecency and 'unnatural acts'.  Found guilty, they were sentenced to 14 years in prison with hard labour.  The presiding official, a Mr Nyakwawa Usiwa Usiwa said: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/20/malawian-gay-couple-jailed-14-years"">""I will give you a scaring sentence so that the public be protected from people like you, so that we are not tempted to emulate this horrendous example.""</a>

So far, so horrible.  People watching the trial shouted that they should have been given longer sentences or executed.  Whilst representatives from human rights groups showed support for the couple, various anti-gay organisations called homosexuality a 'spiritual sickness' and lauded the harsh decision of the court.  It took an open letter from Elton John - a nice wtf?! moment - and international pressure for the couple to be eventually pardoned and released.

And here comes another depressing detail - the couple have now separated.  There may be any number of completely normal reasons for the break, but it will undoubtedly be seen as a victory by the religious right, in a country constitutionally homophobic.  Evidence that gay couples don't work, that it's not natural in the long term and all the other whooping sounds of delight that homophobic people make at times like this.

It would seem to me that being  plucked out of relative obscurity to be poster boys highlighting the plight of gay people in Malawi must have put a great strain on their relationship, not to mention their criminal convictions and the physical separation this caused.  Suddenly they became the target for very vocal abuse and threats of violence, their families disowned them and their own country turned against them.   

The couple may have paved the way for LGBT rights in Malawi, but it came at a great personal cost.  The people at the forefront of a battle are always the worst hit.  Monjeza has said<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/08/malawi-steven-monjeza-tiwonge-chimbalanga""> ""I was forced into the whole drama and I regret the whole episode. I want to live a normal life ... not a life where I would be watched by everyone, booed and teased.""</a>

And who can blame him?  Love does not conquer all, not for everyone.  You can be happy with someone, love them dearly and still be unable to cope with the catcalling or being spat at in the street.  Some people want a quiet life.  The great tragedy here is a couple have been forced to be in the public eye and stand for something that is only a small part of who they are.  Someone who is gay is not the epitome of gayness - it's a very small part of a person.

Is there another way though?  Unfortunately, probably not, because people need to make public stands and be visible examples in order to implement the change in law much needed in places like Malawi.  But by being the example, you will become a casualty.  

Speaking as a person raised by two women, and having to call one of them our 'lodger' for most of my life, to make the household more socially acceptable, I feel a great sadness at stories like these.  My parents were able to stay together at no detriment to their relationship by being covert until such a time they could be sure their children wouldn't suffer negative consequences and they could legally marry.  My parents would not have wanted to be at the forefront of change, because they wanted each other and a normal life.  And this is in England, where being a lesbian has never been illegal.  Ridiculous, but absolutely true.

</lj-cut>

One day, everyone will stop giving a fuck about what consenting adults do in their bedrooms and with who, and the world will be a much better place.

Blimey.  That went on quite a bit.  Sorry about that.  I think it's something that pushes quite a ranty button in me.

"event","Today is a miserable day, a day of quiet solemnity devoid of joy and warm human emotion.  

""Why is this?"", I hear you cry from behind your computer screen.. well, today, the gutter press has reported that the wonderfully acerbic <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1285111/Konnie-Huq-marry-Charlie-Brooker-unlikely-showbiz-wedding.html"">Charlie Brooker is to marry the beautiful Konnie Huq </a>(she of Blue Peter fame).

Not that I thought I was in with a chance (he's a famously funny, scarily intelligent TV personality from London, I'm a lackadaisical, humourless PhD student from Sheffield, we're worlds apart!) but I was really hoping it would turn out that he's into plump ginger birds.  I always hope that about people I admire, and I am always disappointed.  

You never hear of people in the public eye marrying some unusual looking person, do you? Someone with extra weight and cross eyes in photos.  Someone with funny looking knees or hair that wont submit to the demands of the most proficient hair stylist. 

And of course, why should they?  The media industries produce some splendid looking people, who are undoubtedly nice people too.  Of course people are going to pick from the best of the gene pool while they can. Pesky.

So now, all my hopes rest on the wonderful bitter-voiced comedian David Mitchell.  If you're reading this David, you're invited to come check out <s>my etchings</s> the Medieval skeletal assemblage I am collecting data on.

Worst chat up line, ever.."

"event","I do believe I might start using this thing again.  I am filled with an overwhelming urge to wibble about things, and dammit, I think I will.  

Although saying that, I have nothing to say right at this moment in time.  Apart from being hungry - but as I have discovered, I am always hungry.

Also, I really want to roleplay again.  I really, really want to hit things with an axe."

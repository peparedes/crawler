"event","im a different person then most people expect
i feel people see me as outgoing semi cool if they get to know me
im a good person to be around they think im a regular pothead and im
a bad influence but i deserve it i made that reputation for myself
i wish i could change it as fast as i made it but its just like the first
time i had a bad reputation it will be years before it changes again.
im really a good person but i wear my heart on my sleeve
even when a person warns me and says take it slow i cant im not saying i like someone else
because i dont but id like to make a better understanding for myself
something i can go back and read and understand why i think the way i do
i have so many feelings built on all that i know about this girl
the reason why i like her so much is because i see how much she goes through
i can see that she deals with alot and i find that to be attractive
shes such a good person and i like that to theres nothing i can say to make people
understand me fully but my emotions are sensitive and it sucks 
i wish i could go through life and not care what people think or just 
love life all the time but i cant its not me i really dont thinjk that people care 
about me and when someone finally does or i think someone does i really really like that person
i cant help it like i said its just me thats what sam has done 
she showed me she cared and im jumping for it i cant do that this time
i know i already did but if i keep at it im gonna lose her
i dont want to lose her i dont want to fuck this relationship up like ive done all the rest
all my relationships end with the other person cheating on me accept one 
i let that one slip away and i dont want to do that again
i have something great and i know i do i dont want to lose it to stupid decisions 
or to what i think about what she thinks i just need to take it as it goes
if i dont it will end all to soon"

"event","so today was a little easier in a way. i still delt with alot i didnt want to 
i wish i could avoid bad situations. they seem to follow me werever i go
i still miss sam alot. she ate lunch with me for half a lunch im glad i had a study
im glad i got to sit down for a little bit with her 
i guess i just cant understand sam that well thats sumthing i really have to work on
i think if i work on that maybe i can be a better person in those aspects
everyday when i go to school i have so much anxiety i always wanna see sam
i think its a little weird cause ive never been so impatient to see someone
i really like her shes so awsome 
i go thruogh alot each day but it's all worth while when i get to see sam 
and hug her and give her a kiss and tell her shes beautiful tell her how 
great she is. i wish i could do that alot more. ill write another entry later im 
filled with to little thaught right now sams in my head"

"event","today was a day from hell or so it seemed
i took a vicodine this mornin to ease the pain cause i thaught it would be a bad day
i got to school and my gilfriend told me not to bother her all day
i had my sources and she was having a really bad day
i gave her her space and she talked to me at the end of the day
she said thank you for me leaving her alona said she was gonna visit her sister
she gave me a  hug and a kiss and i told her to call me later
she still hasnt called
sometimes i think she doesnt want me 
maybe i think to much 
i always think of this girl and i just cant stop
i wish she knew how i truely felt because i feel like she doesnt
i want her to know she always has someone to turn to 
but i feel like she doesnt even have faith
i may be wrong
im still so new at this point its been 4 weeks 
i wish she knew everything 
i wish she could jump in my head for one day 
i wish i could do the same because then i would understand her
never will i do anything to hurt her i only want to help 
i understand she has to do things on her own and im happy about that 
but i would really like to help 
im just glad i get the chance to hang out with her
shes so great
im so happy around her
i hope im with her for a while"

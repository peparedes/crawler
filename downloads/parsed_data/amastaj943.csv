So my day started off with a dress rehearsal at 8am with my first quintet I was playing with at the Midwest Composer Symposium. Come to find out that we're now the IU Wind Quintet because our composer forgot to put our names in the program and only listed us as a group. Not bad, if I must say that I'm part of a group with a name now. We had our performance at 11am and all went very well. I then had another dress rehearsal at 12:30 with another quintet I was playing with, but with a different composer. Again, we had our performance at 3:30pm and again it went very well. After that, Selina (the bassoonist in both quintets) and I ran off to our next rehearsal with the ad hoc orchestra and played Russian Easter Overture and the Walton Viola Concerto until 5:30pm. I managed to have a break after that, but I got in one last hour of practice for my lesson on Monday. Now, I just want to change into my pajamas, and relax for the rest of the night. My aunt and uncle sent me a really big care package with all sorts of snacks, different socks stuffed with granny smith apples (MY FAVORITE!!) and other fun stuff. Tomorrow, I have my ad hoc rehearsal from 10:00am to 12:30pm and the concert for it at 1pm. After that, I should be free for the rest of the day to practice, finish up some theory homework, and hang around with my friends.

We mangaged to get through the first movement of the piece we're doing and its starting to come along well. I'm bringing in brownies next week for Halloween. Then, it was was WBP rehersal. That was meh. I was always really sharp and I kept on pulling out and I couldn't fix it and the room was very hot. I was dieing. After that, it was tutti rehersal, and we worked on the Tchaikovsky. I finally fixed the cork in my headjoint and I was finally in tune!! It was only Nick and I for the flute section and it gave us a chance to work with each other. It was annoying however that he kept on reminding me that I was sharp. Oh well. All in all, the two of us were thankful we didn't play the shosti since we didn't feel like covering the missing parts. Now I'm home....and I gotta do science homework!! Oh shit. Oh well, more lata

We played the waltz from Sleeping Beauty. I think we did good. Paul and Megan were playing with a Little mermaid doll that they found, and it was funny. After that we had sectionals and Susan said that I'm starting to play out more, and I'm really happy about that.

Now I know why Linda wants me to cram all these fuckin pieces down. I decided that I'm not going to use the Ibert Concerto in any of these, but use it for the 2005 GBYSO audtion, since I'd rather focus on it strictly after all this mess. The Hanson is the best piece I've ever played in my life. Period. I really can't wait till I practice it more and I get better at it. The Faure is comming along. I must perfect in a month and right now its a tad rushed, but I am going to work at it. 

GBYSO today. The usual tchaikovsky and shostakovich. We also have sectionals on the shosti, mvts 3, 1. Thank God, now I can get help on those damn solos. Susan to the rescue, with tips on phrasing and all that fun stuff. Should I bring a book since I barely play in the 3rd mvt? hmmmm....I know I must bring a camera today, but I cant find my mom's anywhere. I'll ask her. I needa take pictures of friends for a project for band ""My life as an orchestral flutist/piccolist"". I know it's a conflict of intrests, but I consider myself more orchestrally trained, than band oriented. I'm also bring my CD player, so I can listen to Into the Woods. Great piece, hard to play. My brother just got an ipod. I think it's just a waste of money. Do you know how many CDs he could have bought? Oh well, its his money.

its 7:45 now, and my dad has left, and my mom and brother arent up. I need to find my mom's camera...soon. My dad took his, and I already have pictures on there. ::sigh:: oh well, looks like my hunt begins...

"event","Ok, so we had our latin party and it was fun. Now I'm stuck practicing for way too many things. This damn musical music is killing. Theres these few parts that are triplets that are really awkward to play and it's all in the 3rd and 4th octaves. For all those flute players out there, playing that high at about 126 to the dotted quarter, it's just plain hard. I'm practicing them over and over, and I know that I have a long way to go with them. Nothin like the weekend to take care off all my problems...

I hafta take the psats tomorrow and I really don't want to. I'd rather practice. Wow, I cannot believe that I just said that. I have way too much to do. Tomorrow, hopefully I'll get in a 6 hour practice session. That should take care of a lot of things.

"event","I just got back from playing for Max Hobart (former BSO associate concert master, and current Wellesley Symphony Orchestra). He was my teacher's old college professor (conductor I assume) and he really loved my playing! He said that I had a very meaty tone quality and that it sounded a lot more fuller than those he heard from other players. He's gonna put in a good word for me for my teacher and now I can't stop smiling!!!

Now that's over, I can concentrate now on lesson work, NESE competition, and Districts. Oh how this is gonna be a very interesting month...

"event","So it was a normal day at GBYSO. Our chamber group had a sub director, in which he's the repertory clarinet coach. He was cool. After that we had a full day of tutti rehersal. We played the tchaikovsky first which was fun. My flute though became progressivly sharp and it was annoying the hell outta me. I hadda pull out at lest a good 1"". Paul kept spraying me with his spray bottle thing and that was funny, yet annoying. After that we hadda break and prepaired for the shosti. I retuned my flute and verything was good. During the shosti, I couldn't play my solos the way I wanted to. My throat was full of mucus since I'm somewhat sick and I couldn't get the power that I wanted. Also, my phrasing sucked and I needa sit down, record myself and make sure I don't fuck them up EVER AGAIN DAMN IT!!!

After GBYSO, I went to starbucks, got a glazed donut (2 really hehe) and a double chocolate frappochino. Yummy. Then I went to the train station. The first train that came by just went right passed us, which was really shocking, but then another one came. I ended up sittin next to Kelly and we talked about All States and what she played, and what I played at Districts and All States. Then we got into who we want to study with in college. It was uber-fun. Now I'm home, and I'm kicking back.

I have a long day tomorrow: 

Practice= 9-12
Lunch=12-1
Practice=1-4
Lessons= 5-6:15
Hmwrk= 6:15-8

Oh shit am I gonna be drained. I also have an audition comming up that wednesday, in which I still need a time and a place for it.


I also got to practice for my school musical as well, and I need to find a cellist too. I asked my friend Adam today before rehersal if he'd like to do it, and he said he might, but he's also gonna ask his friend if he wants to do it, since he's done the musical before. More details soon to come.

"event","Yesterday was probably the most fun ive ever had in a long time. Basicly, andy, my bro and I walked around Salem, and looked in all the shops. I got a new necklace, while andy got more suppliments. Along with eating fried dough, we also manage to raid some of the storm drains at night (in the fountains), with my lazer pointer, and try and get coins. After that, we just hackie sacked for the majority of the time. Sam and I sucked really bad since both of us have only done it about twice in our life. It was still fun. We need to do something like that again. Maybe i can convince andy's rents to let him come to england with me, and be my bodygaurd. He said he'll do it once I get older.

GBYSO fun today. Tchaikovsky, and Shosti mvts 1+4. Great, I get solos either way. Oh well. Chamber's fun though and I love my group. Probably next week, I'm gonna bring in my camera and take some pictures. We'll see. Anyways, breakfast is calling me. More later....

Then I went out to dinner The Rome restaurant, followed by meeting up with Andy at Mel Diva afterwards. Now, im back home, and im kicking back, and listening to the play. Theres this part on the CD ""A very Nice Prince"" in which theres more music on the CD than there is in the script. Oh well. More tomorrow (if i get back early enough)

"event","Yeah, so today was amusing. It started out with Latin, and all we did was nothin since we have a sub for 3 days. Next was band, and all we did was listen to the trumpets mess up idk how many times. ELB, we tried to record the entire ""Disney Suite"" as I like to call it, but we never managed to get through even half of it. Then it was off to chem, and we hadda quiz and it was extremly easy, then we sat around and chatted about it. Last was english and once again, i did nothin, but mark up my musical part with vocal cues while Mr. Quindley tallied off the freshman elections.


Then I had lessons. I was able to get 2 etudes crossed out of the three. She also gave me a new warmup routine that isn't in any of the books, so now i must figure it out all over again. Then we worked on my audition music for on of her college professors. It's the Mozart in D. She said that im very uneven with my 16ths, and I do not know how or why is that. She also corrected my posture since I've ""watched, learned and played with Susan Milan so much that I need to get back into the American style of playing."" Oh well. Guess I gotta stare at myself in the mirror again for 2+ hours trying to correct that. I also have the plessure of another 1.25 hr lesson on monday before the audition on Wednesday. Oh joy. I just hope I do decent, I heard the guy is very very very VERY picky about everything.

Saturday should be fun, I'm going to Salem with Andy. Anything we do together, always turns amusing in some twisted way. I heard we're gonna to some haunted activities....sounds sketchy if ya ask me. Oh well, I'm off to copy CDs for my fellow thespians.

"event","So it was like every normal day at GBYSO. I had chamber, and we finally got colleen to be our oboist. THANKS SO MUCH!!! After that we had normal rehersal, with out Nick. So it was just Lisa, Kelly and I. Not being a bad thing, but for the tchaikovsky, it was kinda empty in some of the phrases since he's second and im principal. 

We also had our picture done for our local newspapers. I got mine with Ben Carson. I've come to the conclusion that he isn't that bad of a person that all. What really bothers me, is that he like a foot taller than I am, and a year younger. Is it just me, or is it that the younger they are, the more taller they are?? Oh well, we got our photo taken, standing next to one another. It was almost back to back, but my body was turned one way, and my head was in another position. All in all, it better be in the paper.

Everyone loved my brownies. I gave some to everyone yesterday. After the senior orchestra, i tried to give one to Nick Johnson, but he's still being a hard ass. I still don't know what's his problem, but if he's only being that way to me, I'll make sure it will come right back at him and bite him in the ass. Good side though, i gave one to emi and she looked like she really enjoyed it too. That made me happy."

GBYSO tomorrow, and I got to make my brownies for the flute section."

Anyways, I told him not to drive to Celebrate Holliston cause of his lung(s) but he's going to anyways. I wonder if I can convince him to drive me there/go out to lunch, even though he just got his lisence. Oh well.

I got another audition next week for one of my lesson teacher's former teachers. I wanna make a good impression and I really gotta practice hard. I was just thinking I should do the usual mozart concerto in D and play a few orchestral excerpts like Peter and the Wolf, Afternoon of a Faun, Midsummer Night's Dream and probably Brahms 4th. This should be interesting.

School's been pretty borning:


Latin- Easy, but the teacher will not call on me. I did make a few more senior friends, who so happen to be girls ;-)

Band- Easy, self explanitory. Fun times being Jamie's massuse haha

ELB (Band)- bleh, boring. I need  a challenge

Chem- OK, not learning anything new yet. The people surrounding me are soo annoying

English- Drew, Mellissa, Jess and I have fun, its interesting and I have the coolest teacher. Period.



Well, Pizza's here. I'll write more lata this week. Ciao"

1) went to breakfast with gramps
2) Got ready for GBYSO
3) Went to GBYSO
4) Got a frappachino and a cookie at Starbucks (yum)
5) Had chamber music first (a woodwind quintet with no oboist yet)
6) Had tutti rehersal, which was kinda borning (we keep going over the 1st and 2nd movements of the Tchaikovsky and it's really boring the hell outta me. That and we went over the Shosti, 2nd mvt)
7) Had sectionals which was kinda fun (WITH VANESSA!!)
8) Came home


I'm really glad I had that drink or else I would not have been alive through a 4 hour day. It'll soon get longer by the second semester, once I do chamber orchesta, then it'll be 6. ouch."

"event","Yeah, so yesterday was my grandad's bday and we took him to F1 Boston. Basicly, its an indoor go cart place, only they go 10X faster, much better courses, must be 18 to do them (which sucked) and you had to wear a fire suit and a helmet too. There was nothin else to do there, but sit around and be bored. I tried to call some of my friends, but the didnt answer *cough cough*. 

Oh well, I got GBSYO lata today, where chamber groups start up. I'm in a woodwind quintet and I'm very excited. Then we have Tutti rehearsal on the Tchaikovsky and the Shosti mvt 2. I love that mvt. Then I get to have a very fun time in sectionals, with Susan, and we're doing mvt 1 and mvt 2 of the Shosti. 

Monday, I get to work with my play music for a bit. I also got Ben Carson to play violin for the musical, which should be pretty interesting, since the two of us don't really care for each other. I guess I gotta suck it up. More news lata today, i promise."

"event","So I woke up early today, did some chores and practiced for GBYSO. When I got to BU, I got the folder for the parents meeting, since my rents couldn't go, and I found the rest of my flute section. I was literally right next to Emi, from Senior orch flute section *drool*. She's amazing, and really nice too. We're always smiling at one another, and her smile always makes me feel better. Then there's Nick in senior orch flute section that always gives me the nastiest looks. Idk what i did to him, it's just when ever I talk with Emi, like at camp, he always signal her to get away from me. What ever his problem is, I don't care. 

So after that meeting, I went to look at the schedule board and I go my chamber music assignments for the 1st semester. I'm in a wind quintet with Vanessa as my coach. I forget who are the people in my group. A

fter that I went to rehersal and we ran through the 1st and 4th mvts of the Shostakovich, and the 2nd mvt of the Tchaikovsky. The first mvt of the shosti is sooooooo weird. There are way to many exposed solos, and when I mean exposed, I mean the violins are playing too softly (pppp), and then you come in. Oh well, I just got to work on the solos a bit since I have quite a few of them. The 4th mvt went OK, but I heard better at camp. Playing it on my new piccolo, is kinda different. I can blend a whole lot better, I don't hafta force myself to play louder, I can control my dynamics, and its a lot more rich in tone quality. Oh well. I still like the 2nd mvt the most, and its solos (too bad I'm associate principal on it). I've also still yet to hear the 3rd mvt and how that one will go as well.

Tomorrow's school and it's a....""D"" day, which means I gotta do some last minute reading for english and I got to do answer 3 questions before fist period tomorrow. Oh well."

"event","Chapter Eight - The Deathday Party<br /><br />October arrives, with colder weather and a spate of colds. Harry is practising  hard at Quidditch - the Slytherin Quidditch team are excellent, on their Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. As Harry heads back to the common room after practise, he bumps into the Gryffindor ghost, Nearly Headless Nick, looking very miserable, and definitely got something on his mind. He explains to Harry that he had applied to join the Headless Hunt, but his application had been declined, as his head is still attached to his body. As the two of them talk, they are interrupted by Mrs Norris, the cat, closely followed by her master, Argus Filch the caretaker, who isn't very happy. He is suffering from 'flu, and he has to clean up the castle. Filch immediately marches Harry to his office, for befouling the castle with mud. <br />Filch's office has chains and manacles hung on the wall, Filch is always asking Dumbledore for permission to hang student from their ankles from the ceiling. There are wooden filing cabinets full of details of students who Filch has punished. Fred and George have a drawer to thermselves! As Filch prepares to write down Harry's punishment, he is distracted by an enormous bang. Filch automatically blames Peeves the Poltergeist, and goes off to find out what he has done this time. He is longing for a excuse to have Peeves expelled from Hogwarts As Harry is in Filch's office on his own, his attention is caught by a letter about a Kwikspell Correspondence Course, where you can learn beginners magic. Harry is intrigued - why would Filch want to learn magic? Filch returns to the office. Peeves had smashed up a vanishing cabinet. Filch looks horrified when he notices that the Kwikspell letter has been read by Harry. He seems flustered and dismisses Harry without even a punishment, after stating the Kwikspell letter doesn't belong to him. <br />It isn't often that students get off Scot-free from Filch's office. As Harry heads to the Gryffindor common room, Nearly Headless Nick stops him. He persuaded Peeves to drop the vanishing cabinet over Filch's office to distract Filch. Harry really appreciates this, and asks if he can do anything for Nick. Nick explains that it will be his five hundredth deathday, at Hallowe'en and he is holding a party in the dungeons. It would be such a honour if Harry - and Hermione and Ron, of course - could attend it too. Lots of ghosts will be attending, including Sir Patrick Delaney Podmore, who is in charge of the Headless Hunt. It might really help Nick's chances of joining the Hunt if Harry told Sir Patrick how frightening he finds Nick. Harry agrees to attend the deathday party - even though the Hallowe'en Feast in the Great Hall sounds much more appealing - and manages to persuade Ron and Hermione to attend too.<br />It is Hallowe'en, and while all the students head for the Great Hall for the magnificent Hallowe'en Feast, the Trio head for the dungeons. The dungeons is full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people dancing to the music of thirty quivering musical swords. The food in the dungeons doesn't appeal to the Trio at <br />all - a maggoty haggis, mouldy cheese and an enormous cake in the shape of a tombstone. Hermione tries to avoid a ghost who haunts the girls bathroom - her name is Moaning Myrtle. Peevs overhears this, and makes Myrtle come over to the Trio. Myrtle is a extremely miserable looking ghost, who seems to have a inferiority complex. She goes away in floods of tears as Peevs taunts her and calls her &quot;spotty&quot;. <br />A dozen ghost horses suddenly enter the dungeon - the Headless Hunt has arrived. Harry tries to persuade Sir Patrick Delaney Podmore that he finds Nick extremely frightening, but Sir Patrick is extremely disbelieving of this. The Trio are freezing cold and decide to head back, perhaps they'll be able to get some pudding in the Great Hall. As they head towards the Entrance Hall, Harry hears that same voice, the one he heard in Lockhart's office. It sounds even more menacing than before. Harry tries to follow the voice, Ron and Hermione follow, extremely confused because they can't hear anything. But, on a wall, is a message written in blood, with a puddle of water underneath it.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><strong>THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED.<br />ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE<br /><br /></strong></span></span></div>And underneath the message is a horrible sight. Mrs Norris the cat is hanging by her tail from a torch bracket, her eyes wide and staring, as stiff as a board. Ron says they don't want to be found near Mrs Norris, they've got to move quickly. But then, the crowd of students exit the Great Hall - the Hallowe'en Feat is over. And the Trio are right in the middle of the Entrance Hall, in front of Mrs Norris. There is a stunned silence until Draco Malfoy's voice rings out.<br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>&quot;Enemies of the heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!&quot;</strong></span></span><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I enjoyed the description of the Deathday Party and especially the introduction of Moaning Myrtle.  Myrtle is very important to this book. What a dramatic end to the chapter."

"event","Chapter 7 - Mudbloods and Murmurs<br /><br />As the days go on, Harry realises that he seems to have acquired a admirer. Young Colin Creevey, even though he is in the year below Harry, follows Harry everywhere and is eager to find out everything about magic. Oliver Wood, the Gryffindor Quidditch captain (and Keeper in the game) comes into Harry dormitory before dawn one morning. He tells Harry to get up quick, he wants to start the new training programme, get a head-start from the other House teams. Harry sighs and gets up. As he heads to the Quidditch pitch, Colin follows him, pestering Harry to tell him about the complicated game of Quidditch.<br />The rest of the Gryffindor team are in the changing rooms when Harry finally shakes off Colin. Oliver takes Quidditch very seriously, he has charts to show the team how their new tactics will work. The training talk takes almost a hour, before the team is allowed to go onto the pitch and start practicing. It is wonderful, for Harry, to be flying again. But even though there are few spectators - Hermione, Ron and Colin among them - the Slytherin Quidditch team are also on the pitch. Wood is infuriated, he booked the pitch! But Flint - the Slytherin Quidditch captain - shows a specially signed note from Professor Snape, giving the Slytherin team permission to practice, to train up their new Seeker. Wood angrily demands who the new Seeker is. And from the six large Quidditch players clad in green steps out Draco Malfoy. <br />Flint then shows Wood the new broomsticks that the Slytherin team will be using - Nimbus Two Thousand and One - Lucius Malfoy made a extremely generous gift of them. Harry's prize broomstick is &quot;only&quot; a Nimbus Two Thousand, considered the best broomstick, until the Nimbus Two Thousand and One's came out. Draco sneers at Ron as Ron and Hermione approach, to see what all the fuss is about. The Weasley's only have Cleansweep Five brooms, extremely inferior. Hermione glares at Draco, at least no one of the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in, they got in on pure talent. Draco is annoyed by this and says <strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-size: larger;"">&quot;No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,&quot; </span></span></strong> There is immediate uproar. Ron goes for his wand immediately but it fails miserably. It backfires and makes Ron belch slugs. This has the Slytherin team in hysterics, and Colin going for his trusty camera immediately. Harry and Hermione lead Ron to Hagrid's hut, Hagrid will know how cure Ron. <br />As they approach the hut, they see Professor Lockhart leaving it, Hagrid seems extremely relieved to see him go. The Trio approach Hagrid, and go in the hut for tea. Hagrid says Lockhart was giving him advice on how to get rid of kelpies from a well - as if he doesn't know how to do this already! He says he can't stop Ron belching slugs, it'll stop when it's ready. Hagrid comments that Lockhart was the only person for the Defence Against the Dark Arts job, people aren't too keen to take the job, people think it might be jinxed. Hagrid asks who Ron was trying to curse. Hermione says that Draco called her a &quot;Mudblood&quot; - she doesn't know what it means, but she knew that it was rude. Ron says that Mudblood is the most insulting thing Draco could say. It is a foul name for someone who is Muggle-born, born of non-magic parents. The Malfoy family consider themselves &quot;better&quot; because they're pure-blood. Hagrid reassures Hermione, they haven't invented a spell that Hermione can't do. He then gently teases Harry, asking where his signed photograph was. He says that young Ginny came to see him yesterday, at his hut, she probably wouldn't say no to a signed photo of Harry. The Trio have a look at Hagrid's enormous pumpkins - helped on by a Engorgement Charm - ready for the Hallowe'en feast, before heading back to the castle.<br />Professor McGonagall corner the boys as they go in for lunch. They have to do a detention for flying the car, and they'll be do it tonight. Ron will be helping Mr Filch, the caretaker, polish the silver in the trophy room. No magic either - Ron will be using elbow grease. While Harry will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan-mail. Both boys consider they've come off worse with the punishments. Harry begs to swap with Ron but McGonagall says Lockhart asked for Harry particularly. Soon it is eight pm and time to do their detentions. Lockhart is delighted to see Harry, he considers Harry's punishment more of a treat than a punishment. Harry is extremely bored while addressing the envelopes, the fan-mail seems never ending. And then Harry hears a voice, a voice that chills him to his bone-marrow -<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-size: larger;""><strong> &quot;Come ... come to me ... let me rip you ... let me tear you ... let me kill you ... &quot;</strong></span></span> Eek! The surprising thing is, that when Harry asks Lockhart if he heard the voice, Lockhart denies it. Harry must be getting tired, Lockhart says - and no surprise, it's almost midnight! They've been at it for nearly four hours. Harry heads for the dormitory. Eventually Ron comes to bed - Filch has had him working very hard indeed, it didn't help when he had another slug attack over a Special Award for Services to the School. Harry quietly tells Ron (so that the other Gryffindor boys don't hear) about the voice only he could hear.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was totally thrown, on first reading, with the &quot;voice&quot;. I had no clue what or who was making it, but knew it wasn't good! The way Draco is the new Seeker of the Slytherin team, just because Daddy brought the team top-of-the-range brooms still annoys me. Draco shouldn't have been on the team at all - he should have had to try out, like everyone else. And we get the first mention of &quot;Mudblood&quot; - a horrible word, which affects the whole series (just think of book 5 and a &quot;certain memory&quot; and book 7)"

"event","Chapter Six - Gilderoy Lockhart<br /><br />Harry, Ron and the others at Hogwarts start their new term and their lessons the next day.  Hermione is still a little annoyed with Harry and Ron, the way they flouted the rules, and flew the car to Hogwarts. Neville is sent a parcel from his Gran, at breakfast, with things he'd forgotten to take with him, while Errol, the Weasley family owl, also delivers something to Ron. Unfortunately, it is a Howler letter from Mrs Weasley, expressing - very loudly so that the whole Hall can hear! - how disappointed she and Mr Weasley are of them flying the car. Mr Weasley is facing a inquiry at work.&nbsp; If Ron puts another foot out of line, they'll bring him straight back home. Ron is totally embarrassed but at least the Howler makes Hermione forgive the boys. <br />The first lesson for the second years is Herbology with the Hufflepuffs, taught by Professor Sprout. Professor Sprout approaches the greenhouses with Professor Lockhart. Lockhart announces that he has just been showing Professor Sprout how to doctor the Whomping Willow - which is now bandaged up. As the second years file into the greenhouse, Lockhart takes Harry aside. Lockhart shakes his head at Harry - he knows exactly why Harry flew the car to Hogwarts. When Harry and Lockhart had the photograph taken for the Daily Prophet, it gave Harry a taste for publicity, he craved more. But when Lockhart was twelve, he was just as much of a nobody as Harry - even less so, seeming Harry survived Lord Voldemort at one year old! Lockhart&nbsp; says hehas won Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award five times in a row now! Harry is extremely relieved to be allowed to enter the greenhouse.<br />They learn about re-potting Mandrake plants in Herbology. The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it, but it forms an essential part of most antidotes. The Mandrakes are like ugly babies, the leaves grow out of their heads, and it is extremely difficult to re-pot. As the Trio do their best, a Hufflepuff second year approaches them. He introduces himself as Justin-Finch-Fletchley, and knows all about the Trio. Justin seems to be a admirer of Lockhart. He says he was down for Eton - a famous private school in England - but was delighted to attend Hogwarts instead. After Herbology, it is time for Transfiguration, where they have to turn beetles into buttons. Ron is having tremendous difficultly with his wand, which he has now Spellotaped together, as the Whomping Willow more or less broke it in half. As they head for lunch, Ron asks Hermione why she's decorated her school timetable with hearts for the Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson.<br />As they finish lunch, a small first year shyly approaches Harry, He introduces himself as Colin Creevey, and is obviously awed to be in the presence of the-boy-who-lived. He explains that he didn't have a clue he could do magic until the  letter from Hogwarts arrived - his dad's a milkman, so he's taking lots  of photos to send home to him.He has a Muggle camera with him and tentatively asks if he can have a picture of Harry - even better, if Harry's friend could take a picture of both Harry and Colin. Harry is extremely embarrassed but then Draco Malfoy walks pass. He is extremely scathing, and announces loudly that Harry's giving out signed photos, despite Harry's denials. Colin bravely pipes up that Malfoy's just jealous. Malfoy says that he doesn't want a foul scar across his head. During the disagreement, Lockhart approaches. He manages to disfuse the situation by allowing Colin to take a photo of himself and Harry, and they'll both sign it.&nbsp; It is time for Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson.<br />Lockhart decides to spring a test paper on the second years, to make sure that they have read the set books (all by Lockhart himself!) properly. Predictably, Hermione gets full marks and gains ten points for Gryffindor. And now to business! Lockhart has brought some caged freshly caught Cornish pixies into the classroom. They might not look dangerous, but they can be devilishly tricky! When Lockhart opens the cage, pandemonium ensues. They wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. Two of them seize Neville by the ears and lift him into the air. Soon Neville is swinging from the candelabra in the ceiling. Lockhart is totally useless at rounding them up, as the class bell rings for end of the lesson. The students make a rush for the exit, Lockhart asks the Trio to round the pixies up and leaves them to it. Ron is extremely annoyed, but Hermione says Lockhart just wanted to give them some &quot;hands-on experience&quot;. Harry splutters that Lockhart didn't have a clue what he was doing, and Hermoine reminds him of all the amazing things he's done, in his books. Ron mutters &quot;He <span style=""font-size: large;""><em><strong>says</strong></em></span> he's done&quot;.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />My favourite bit of this chapter - maybe of the whole book except for one more incident later&nbsp; - is the Howler. I listen to the audio version of the book as I read along, and Stephan Fry does the Howler absolutely wonderfully!"

"event","Chapter Five - The Whomping Willow<br /><br />Finally, after a lovely break at The Burrow, it is time for five Weasley children - Percy is entering his sixth year, the Twins their fourth, Ron his second year and Ginny her first time - and Harry to return to Hogwarts. It isn't easy, taking six kids, trunks and animals to King's Cross Station. They keep forgetting things. Ginny is extremely anxious when she leaves her diary at the Burrow, and they have to return for it. Arthur Weasley tries to persuade Molly to let him to use a special button in the Ford Anglia - the Invisibility Booster - which will enable the full car to fly in the clouds, unnoticed. Molly says no, immediately. They arrive at King's Cross with only a quarter of a hour to spare. <br />Ron and Harry are last&nbsp; to go through the barrier, that leads to Platform Nine and Three Quarters. Wizards and witches can usually just lean against the barrier, and it melts. But this time, it refuses to budge. Ron and Harry are totally stranded in Muggle London. No Muggle money. Then Ron has a idea - they can fly the car to Hogwarts, with the Invisibility Booster. Harry eagerly agrees, and they head back to the car park. The car works well, flying in the clouds, but the Invisibility Booster seems a little faulty at times. They just have to worry about areoplanes. They follow the Hogwarts Express from up in the air - a extremely comfortable way to travel, in the clouds and the blazing sun.<br />But as the journey continues, hour after hour, they begin to think longingly of the witch on the Hogwarts Express with the sweet trolley and where you could buy pumpkin juice. The car seems to be tiring too. They are now very close to Hogwarts castle, they're more or less in the grounds. The car engine suddenly gives up and they are heading for the solid castle walls. With a bit of tricky steering, they manage to hit a willow tree. But not a ordinary willow tree. A willow tree that fights back! The tree attacks Ron, Harry and the car, Ron's wand is broken nearly into two. After they manage to dis-entangle themselves from the tree, the car ejects the boy's trunks etc and trundles off into the darkness.<br />Harry and Ron approach the school, they can't resist looking through the window, and spying on everyone having the welcoming feast and the Sorting. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. But then Ron realises something. There's a empty chair at the table. Where's Snape?<br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>&quot;Maybe he's ill!&quot; said Ron hopefully<br />&quot;Maybe he's <em>left</em>,&quot; said Harry, &quot;because he missed out on the Defence Against the Dark Arts job <em>again</em>!&quot;<br />&quot;Or he might have been <em>sacked</em>!&quot; said Ron enthusiastically. &quot;I mean, everyone hates him - &quot;<br />&quot;Or maybe,&quot; said a very cold voice right behind them, &quot;he's waiting to hear why you two didn't arrive on the school train.&quot;</strong></span><br />Oh dear! Snape leads the two boys to their doom. He says that the car had been seen by Muggles, flying - it is in the Muggle newspapers. And now they have damaged a very valuable tree. If they were in his House, he'd make sure they were expelled immediately - most unfortunately, the decision doesn't lie with him. Snape goes to fetch Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor.<br />McGonagall is understandably annoyed with Harry and Ron. Why didn't they send the school a letter by owl, when they were trapped in London? Harry has Hedwig, that would have been a lot easier than flying the car. As McGonagall continues to tick off the boys, Professor Dumbledore enters. He demands that the boys give a explanation. He isn't annoyed -&nbsp; he just looks extremely disappointed in them. When the boys finish explaining, Ron says that they'll go and pack. Dumbledore says they aren't expelled, but a letter will be sent to their families. If they do anything like that again, he will have no choice but to expel Harry and Ron. Snape looks extremely disappointed.<br />Instead of going to the Great Hall for the Feast, the boys have a private feast. Before McGonagall goes to join everyone else, she says that Ginny was Sorted in Gryffindor too. The boys feel extremely relieved that they are not expelled. They head for Gryffindor dormitory, and meet Hermione on the way. She is horrified that the boys flew the car, but the rest of the Gryffindors are extremely impressed, especailly the Weasley Twins.<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I think my favourite part of this chapter is a simple sentence.<br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>&quot;They had almost reached the motorway when Ginny shrieked that she'd left her diary.&quot;</strong></span><br />Simple sentence, yes. But if the Weasleys hadn't gone back for the diary, the story could have been totally turned on it's head. I'd love to know how Jo would&nbsp; have worked it,&nbsp; if she had Ginny leaving the diary at The Burrow.<br />"

"event","Chapter Four - Gilderoy Lockhart<br /><br />The biggest difference that Harry finds between Privet Drive and The Burrow is that the people at The Burrow seem to like having Harry around. A letter from Hermione arrives, saying she hopes Ron didn't get into any trouble while rescuing Harry, and arranging to meet up in Diagon Alley when they do their school shopping. Young Ginny will be starting Hogwarts this year too, it is going to be a expensive business for Mr and Mrs Weasley, with all the set school books - a lot seem to by a Gilderoy Lockhart - so Ginny would probably have to do with second-hand stuff. The Twins mention that Percy the Prefect&nbsp; seem to be very busy and secretive. He didn't even gloat much over his twelve O.W.L. (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) results.<br />The day arrives when they are all going to go to Diagon Alley for their big shop for all the things they need for Hogwarts. But instead of by flying car or broomstick - they use Floo Powder. You step into a fire, sprinkle powder and state where you wish to go. Harry breaks his glasses during traveling by Floo Powder. He ends up in entirely the wrong place -&nbsp; and ends up in a shop.&nbsp; The shop seems to be full of things he's never seen in Diagon Alley. And while trying to get out of the shop unnoticed, who should enter the shop but Draco Malfoy and a blond haired man who could only be Mr Malfoy.<br />Harry definitely doesn't want to be seen by Mr Malfoy and Malfoy Junior in his disheveled state so decides to hide in a black cabinet. He can hear everything clearly though. Draco is complaining that he isn't on the House Team, after Mr Malfoy says that he will buy him a racing broom. Harry got special permission to play on <strong>his</strong> house team last year, even though he's not all that good, it was just because he's famous. Mr Malfoy reminds his son that it isn't prudent to appear less than fond of Harry Potter. Their conversation is interrupted by Mr Borgin, the owner of the shop. Mr Malfoy is trying to sell things to Mr Malfoy that he doesn't want the Ministry of Magic to discover - even though the name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, the items might cause embarrassment if they were found at the Malfoy's home.&nbsp; There is supposed to be a new Muggle Protection Act coming into force. Malfoy is bored by the conversation, and admires a withered hand on a cushion. Mr Borgin says it is the Hand of Glory -&nbsp; best friend to thieves and plunderers. Malfoy Senior says he hopes Draco will amount to more than that, but his school marks would have to improve. Draco should be ashamed, being beaten in every exam by a girl of no wizard family. Harry smiles grimly. Obviously Hermione. After the Malfoys leave the shop and Mr Borgin goes away, Harry makes a swift exit. Apparently he is in Knockturn Alley, and it is full of shops devoted to the Dark Arts.<br />Harry is desperate to find his way back to Diagon Alley, and he is extremely relieved to meet Hagrid. Hagrid says he was looking for flesh-eating slug repellent, and guides Harry back to Diagon Alley, where the Weasley's are waiting for Harry anxiously. After collecting some of his money from Gringotts, they all separate and arrange to meet at Flourish and Blotts bookstore to buy the school books. The Trio see Percy in a second-hand book shop reading a book called <strong>&quot;Prefects who gained power&quot;</strong> When they get to Flourish and Blotts, they find a large crowd. Apparently Gilderoy Lockhart - the man who has written the majority of Harry's schoolbooks - will be signing his autobiography today. The crowd seems to be mostly witches, even Mrs Weasley is in a flutter, as in Hermione. They finally get to the front of the queue. Gilderoy is dressed in robes of forget-me-npt blue, with dazzling teeth. He's delighted to see Harry, and makes it the perfect photo opportunity for the <strong>Daily Prophe</strong>t. Gilderoy announces that he is going to be the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. He then gives Harry the whole set of his books. Harry is immediately embarrassed and gives them to Ginny. Draco sees all this and snidely comments that Harry;s got himself a girlfriend. Ron and Harry are tempted to attack Draco, but then Mr Weasley and Mr Malfoy approach. The two men swap insults with each other. When Malfoy Senior sneers at Ginny's battered Transfiguration book, that it is all that Arthur can afford,&nbsp; it is all too much for Mr Weasley and throws the first punch. Hagrid manages to break up the fight. Harry is extremely relieved to leave Diagon Alley and get back to The Burrow<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />There are several things I really like about CoS, although it is always one of my least favourites in the series. The first is that there are so many things connected with HBP and other books in this chapter - the cabinet Harry hid in, the Hand of Glory are just a few. And the other is Gilderoy Lockhart. I know a lot of people find him frustrating but I think he's a great comical character - and he doesn't know it! In fact he becomes even more appealing with his reappearance in book five, with his memory malfunction. Kenneth Brannagh did a excellent job in the film version :-D"

"event","Chapter 3 - The Burrow<br /><br />Ron has come to rescue Harry in a flying Ford Anglia, turquoise no less - and Fred and George have come along to help out with the escape plan. The Twins pick the lock of Harry's locked door, to get Harry's broom, wand and school stuff which is locked up downstairs while Harry puts all his stuff in the car quickly. They manage to pack the car and nearly escape, before Harry realises that he left Hedwig and her cage behind. He quickly goes back for it - but the noise has awakened the Dursleys. Vernon does his best to hold onto Harry but fails, and the dumbfounded Dursleys watch Harry fly off in the car, which Harry calling back merrily &quot;See you next Summer!&quot;<br />It is time for some explanations - the Weasleys already know Harry is in deep trouble for performing underaged magic. They &quot;borrowed&quot; the car - Mr Weasley loves tinkering with Muggle stuff, and he enchanted the car. Harry tells the Weasleys all about Dobby, and the warning that &quot;something&quot; is about to happen at Hogwarts. The Twins say that rich witches and wizards, who have old families, usually own house-elves.  Ron and Harry immediately think of the Malfoy family - it is just the sort of thing they would do, to make their servant try and scare Harry not to return to Hogwarts. And apparently Lucius Malfoy - Draco's father - was the first to come back to the &quot;good side&quot; when Lord Voldemort vanished, although he was supposed to be right in Voldemort's inner circle. The car flies on, towards the Weasley's home, The Burrow.<br />The boys plan to quietly slip inside the house and pretend they've been their all night, and Harry just &quot;turned up&quot;. Sounds simple enough, right? But as the car lands at a rather ramshackle-looking house, Mrs Weasley approaches and gives her sons a severe ticking off. She was worried to death, just wait until their father gets home! They could do with taking a leaf out of Percy's book. Then Mrs Weasley turns towards Harry - and is extremely sympathetic and welcoming. She cooks all the family a huge breakfast, and then makes the Twins and Ron de-gnome the garden as punishment for flying the car. Harry volunteers to help too. Harry also meets the youngest of the Weasleys - Ginny. She seems extremely nervous around Harry, even though Ron says Ginny has been talking about Harry all summer.<br />Mr Weasley gets home from work. He works in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, at the Ministry of Magic. He seems extremely impressed that Ron and the Twins flew the car to rescue Harry and wants to know if it flew well. He backtracks, when catching his wife's face, and tells the boys <strong>&quot;that - that was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed ...&quot;</strong> Sorry, Mr Weasley, but that wasn't all that convincing :-D Harry will be sharing Ron's room. Ron nervously shows Harry his room - which is covered with posters and things to do with his favourite Quidditch Team, the Chudley Cannons. Ron is nervous, he knows The Burrow isn't a bit like Privet Drive. But Harry smiles broadly. This is the best house he's ever been in .... awwwwwwwwwww!<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I loved all the descriptions in this chapter. How many of us &quot;Muggles&quot; would want to stay at The Burrow? It mightn't be much, but it's a proper home - a much better home that Privet Drive had been to Harry. We caught a glimpse of Molly Weasley in book 1, and she seems like the perfect mother-figure for Harry. She adores her family, but rules with a rod of iron. Her lecture to Ron and the Twins was hilarious, and then the way she just automatically welcomed Harry after venting her anger! But Arthur Weasey is also just as brilliant as his wife. I loved the way he was so proud of Ron and the Twins, the way they managed to fly the car, and then had to give rather a subdued ticking off, prompted by Molly :-)&nbsp;<br />Last night, as I said, I went to see a &quot;amateur&quot; production of Les Miserables. And if that was considered amateur I'd love to see it professionally performed! I think it was the best three hours I've had at a theatre for some time. The only thing which could have been better, is that orchestra seemed to drown out the singers at some parts of the show, but they orchestra did do a fantastic job. All the actors were brilliant. And although the actor who played Valjean was excellent, the star of the show for me (and for my uncle and aunt) was the actor who played Javert. A absolutely unbelievable voice. Brilliantly performed by all.&nbsp; I really want to see it again one day, with a professional cast. One day maybe :-)<br />"

"event","Chapter 2 - Dobby's Warning<br /><br />The strange creature introduces himself to Harry - he is Dobby, just Dobby the house-elf. Harry is understandably rather surprised to have a house-elf in his bedroom, the unfortunate thing about Dobby is that he is rather noisy (especially when Harry tries to treat him as a equal), and seems to enjoy beating himself up. Not the ideal guest, with his Aunt, Uncle, cousin and the very important guests only downstairs. Dobby's owners will make him do punishments if he finds out Dobby came to find Harry. A house-elf must be set free by it owners. Dobby finally tells Harry why he is there.  <strong>Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts</strong>.<br />Harry is rather startled by this, Hogwarts is the only thing that has kept him going, during his break at Privet Drive. He doesn't belong in the Muggle world, he belongs in the wizarding world. But Dobby says that there is a plot to make terrible things happen at Hogwarts, Harry must not put himself in peril. Dobby, however, refuses to say exactly WHO is behind this plotting. Then Harry realises that Dobby has been stopping his friend's letters. Dobby says he can have them if he promises not to return to Hogwarts. Of course Harry can't promise this, the argument between them continues in the kitchen. Dobby then does the worst thing possible - he makes Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding float up to the ceiling, and then drop it, before disappearing. This of course attracts the attention of the Dursleys.<br />Vernon might have still made the deal with the Masons but then, a barn owl swoops into the dining room. Unfortunately, Mrs Mason is terrified of birds, and the Masons make a extremely swift exit. The owl has a letter for Harry - he performed magic outside school, something he isn't supposed to do. If he performs any more magic, Harry will be expelled from Hogwarts. Vernon is surprisingly delighted that Harry isn't supposed to perform magic outside school. He locks Harry in his bedroom, with a cat flap for food to be shoved through, and bars on Harry's windows to finish off of effect. Harry lies on his bed, feeling thoroughly miserable,how on earth will he cope, not being allowed to go to Hogwarts any more? But then a most surprising apparition appears at his barred window - Ron, his best mate, is outside!<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><strong>Ramblings and family ramblings!</strong><br /><br />I always found Dobby a little annoying but I don't think a character's death affected me so much as Dobby's. I can remember being in floods of tears and saying that he &quot;was only a house-elf&quot;. But Dobby turned out to be really useful to Harry.<br /><br />I haven't mentioned my family much during the revisiting of Philosopher's Stone. The &quot;Princes&quot; are fine, their daddy is off to Afghanistan next month for six months. Mum has had a few health issues over the last week. She had a blood clot in her leg two years ago, and she was on medication for about six months, which sorted it out. Her leg has been troubling her all last week, so much so that she went to the local A &amp; E over the weekend, to have it checked out. The bad news is that she has quite a few blood clots in her leg so she's going to have a few blood tests, and see a specialist this coming week. The good news is that it can be dealt with with medication, although seeming this is the third time she's had a blood clot, she's going to be on medication for the rest of her life.&nbsp; But she's in really good spirits, and doing all her normal things around the house.<br />And tonight, one of my ambitions is about to come true. I am going to the local theatre to see a amateur production of &quot;Les Miserables&quot; with Mum's brother and his wife. I've always wanted to see it on stage, I've got the dvd and cd of it, and love them. It doesn't bother me that it's a &quot;amateur production&quot;, just something to cross off my &quot;wish list&quot; :-D I shall, of course, say how it was tomorrow :-)"

"event","Chapter One - The Worst Birthday<br />This is Jo's second novel about Harry Potter. This first chapter gives a quick summary for Muggles who haven't read Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone, about what happened in the previous book. It can become a little repetitive, but it only happened in this book and the following two books. After book 4, we get right into the action!<br />Harry is having a miserable summer at Privet Drive, virtually ignored by Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Cousin Dudley is more scared of Harry. But now Harry has got something to keep him going, he'll be returning to Hogwarts. When Dudley demands more bacon, Harry says &quot;he forgot the magic word&quot; (meaning &quot;please&quot; of course). The simple utterance of &quot;Magic&quot; sends his Aunt and Uncle into a frenzy.&nbsp; After calming down a little, Vernon announces this could be the day when he makes the most important business deal of his life. The Dursleys are going to host a dinner party at their home, to impress some potential clients, the Masons. Vernon makes sure Petunia and Dudley are well prepared for their guests - and Harry will be confined to his bedroom, making no noise and pretending he isn't there. Or else ....<br />Harry goes into the garden, miserably. He hasn't had any contact at all from the wizarding world, even though one of his best mates, Ron Weasley, said that he'd invite Harry and their other friend, Hermione Granger, to stay with his family. No one seems to remember that today is Harry's twelfth birthday. He really, really misses Hogwarts and Quidditch, the wizarding sport played on broomsticks. But HAS everyone forgotten? As Harry gazes into a hedge, he sees a pair of eyes gazing at him. Then Dudley approaches Harry, and the eyes vanish. Dudley takes great delight in saying he knows it's Harry's birthday - doesn't Harry have any friends at that &quot;freak place&quot; he goes to? Harry retaliates in the only way he knows how, pretending to perform magic, and scaring Dudley into seven fits.<br />Harry is punished for his bit of fun, made to do chores until he gets bread and cheese for his main meal (while the Dursleys will feast on roast pork and a beautiful looking pudding with whipped cream and sugared violets!)&nbsp; before being banished to his bedroom, mere seconds before the Masons arrive. But there's someone else in Harry's room ...<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I got to say that Chamber of Secrets is always one of my least favourite of the series. I think it is because of the spiders! But I do enjoy the way Harry taunts Dudley by muttering the nonsense words <strong>&quot;Jiggery Pokery, Hocus Pocus, Squiggly Wiggly&quot;</strong> :-D It is never explained exactly how Dudley knows it is Harry's birthday, but the previous year Hagrid gave Dudley a curly pig's tail during the confrontation in the Hut on the Rock. Hard to forget, especially since it had to be removed!"

"event","Chapter 17 - The Man with Two Faces<br /><br />So if it isn't Snape in the final chamber, and it's not Lord Voldemort ... who is it? It's Professor Quirrell - but he's different. Much more confident and no sign of a stammer. He says to Harry who would suspect him with Snape swooping around like a overgrow bat? Snape hasn't been trying to kill Harry - that has been Quirrell. Snape was performing an counter-curse, during Harry's first Quidditch match, while Quirrell was trying to get Harry to fall off his broom. Of course Quirrell couldn't do anything to harm Harry at the next match, seeming Dumbledore was watching. Quirrell ties up Harry and says he let the troll in at Hallowe'en. He then gazes in the Mirror of Erides, which is in the chamber too. The Mirror is the key to finding the Philosopher's Stone.<br />To distract Quirrell, Harry asks him why Snape hates Harry so much. Snape says yes, Snape does hate Harry, but he never wanted Harry dead. Snape was at school with Harry's father - Snape and James loathed each other. Quirrell continues to gaze in the Mirror, saying that he finds it hard to follow his master's instructions. Quirrell met his master while he was traveling, and he has served him faithfully. The Mirror doesn't seem to be giving Quirrell the answers he's looking for. Harry realises that if he looks in the Mirror, he will see himself finding it. Somehow, he has to look in the Mirror without Quirrell noticing. Then a high voice sounds in the chamber, it seems to come from Quirrell himself.<strong> &quot;Use the boy ... use the boy ... &quot;</strong> Quirrell forces Harry to look in the Mirror. Harry sees his reflection pop the Philosopher's Stone into his pocket ... and he also feels the real stone in his pocket, Somehow or other, he's got the Stone! He lies to Quirrell, and says that he sees himself winning the House Cup for Quirrell. Then the high voice is heard again. <strong>&quot;Let me speak to him ... face to face ... &quot;</strong> Gradually, Quirrell's turban unwinds ...<br />And instead of the back of Quirrell's head, there is a terrible face. It is chalk white with glaring red eye and slits for nostrils, like a snake. It's Lord Voldemort, he's been controlling Quirrell for months. Unicorn blood has strengthen Voldemort slightly but he needs the Elixir of Life to get a body of his own. He demands the Stone, residing in Harry's pocker. Better save his own life and join Voldemort ... or Harry will meet the same end as his parents. Voldemort tells Quirrell to seize Harry. But Quirrell can't hold Harry, when he touches Harry's skin, Quirrell's skin burns. Harry uses this to his advantage until he passes out and falls down into blackness ...<br />Harry awakes in the hospital wing, with Professor Dumbledore beside him. A lot has happened in three days. Harry is extremely concerned that Voldemort has the Philosopher's Stone. But Dumbledore reassures him - the Stone has been destroyed, Voldemort has not got it. Yes, it means Nicolas Flamel and his wife will die, but they are both extremely old. After all, to the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure. Dumbledore says Voldemort is going to try another way to come back and gain power. But they are prepared.&nbsp; Harry asks why Voldemort wanted to kill him in the first place. Dumbledore sighs, he can not answer this question. Harry will know one day. Quirrell could not touch Harry because of the love Harry's mother had for Harry. To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us protection forever. Dumbledore also explains why exactly Snape and Harry's father hated each other. They were rather like Harry and Draco. But then Harry's father saved Snape's life and Snape hated being in Harry's father's debt. He tried to protect Harry all year so that he and James would be quits, and Snape could go back to hating James. Harry was able to find the Stone in the Mirror because he only wanted to <strong>find</strong> it, and not <strong>use</strong> it. Harry gets lots of visitors during his stay in the hospital wing. Hagrid visits him, utterly distraught that he told Voldemort/Quirrell how to get past Fluffy. Harry reassures Hagrid, it doesn't matter. Hagrid gives Harry a photograph album full of wizarding photos of his parents. Harry is extremely touched by the gift.<br />So it is the end of the school-year and the House points have to be awarded. Harry is allowed to the feast, released from the hospital wing. Slytherin has won the House Cup, they Great Hall is decked out in Green and silver. Gryffindor are in last place, they need 160 points to tie even with Slytherin. But wait! Dumbledore says he has a few last minute points to award. First to Ron - for the best played game of chess Hogwarts had seen for a long time - <strong>fifty points</strong>. Cheers ensue for the Gryffindor table. Even Percy the Prefect is proud of his little brother. Next - Hermione, for the use of cool logic in the face of fire - <strong>another fifty points</strong>! Gryffindor has got a extra hundred points now. Third - to Harry, himself, for pure nerve and outstanding courage - <strong>sixty points</strong>.&nbsp; The Great Hall is now in chaos - Gryffindor are now tying for the House Cup with Slytherin! Yay! Such a shame Dumbledore didn't give Harry one more point. The Slytherin table look extremely disappointed at the awarding of the last minute points. But Dumbledore hasn't finished yet - surely there's no-one else going to be awarded points? And finally - ten points to someone who has shown bravery. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but as much to stand up to your friends. <strong>Ten points </strong>to <span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><strong>Neville Longbottom</strong></span></span>! Neville, who has never won as much as a point for Gryffindor before. <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>Gryffindor has won the House Cup!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong></span></span>&nbsp; As Harry basks in the celebrations, he catches the eye of Professor Snape. Harry knows Snape's feelings for Harry hasn't changed a bit, he still totally hates Harry. But Harry doesn't care - this is the best <br />evening of his life. Finally, it is time to go back to the Muggle world until term starts in September. Before they arrive at King's Cross Station, Ron invites Harry and Hermione to stay with him over the summer. Harry agrees readily - he'll need something to look forward to, he's got to spend time with the Dursleys. All three Dursleys are waiting to &quot;greet&quot; Harry at the station, and don't make a great impression on Hermione and Ron. Hermione wishes Harry a good holiday and Harry smiles, oh he will have a good holiday. The Dursleys don't know that Harry isn't allowed to do magic in the Muggle world. Harry is going to have fun with Dudley over the summer ....<br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />What a brilliant ending. The terror of actually &quot;meeting&quot; Voldemort, and the way Harry battled him and Quirrell. We get so many little hints of what to come - the hints that Snape and James were at school together, and they hated each other, the way Dumbledore refused to answer a few of Harry's questions. The touching photograph album - I am sure Hagrid would have contacted Remus Lupin for old photos of Lily and James, Sirius probably didn't have many photos in Azkaban :( <br />And even though I've read this book loads of times, I got a warm fuzzy feeling as Dumbledore awarded the crucial final points to &quot;my&quot; Neville, to make sure that Gryffindor won the House Cup. This is a total triumph of a book, still can't believe Jo had so much trouble getting it published. I love the series, and each book individually but when I pick my &quot;favourite book&quot; it always seems to be this one and Deathly Hallows. And we've got six more books until the finale! :-D"

"event","Chapter 16 - Through the Trapdoor<br /><br />It is mid-summer and exam time. The first years struggle through the exams, especially the Potions one. It is hard to make a Forgetfulness Potion with Snape breathing down their necks (Giggle! :-D ). Harry has got his reoccurring nightmare back, about his parents, but now has the added problem of dreaming of the hooded figure. His scar keeps hurting too, more than it usually does. At last the exams are over, and the Trio lounge in the grounds. As Harry watches a owl flutter towards the school, Harry's mind begins to wander. The only reassuring thing he has is that Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get <br />past Fluffy. But .....<br />Harry suddenly realises something and makes Hermione and Ron to come with him to Hagrid's hut. Harry immediately asks Hagrid what the stranger looked like, when he played cards with him to win the dragon's egg. Hagtid look surprised - the stranger never took his cloak off, he never saw what he looked like. Harry asks what Hagrid and the stranger talked about. Hagrid says that he told the stranger that he was gamekeeper at Hogwarts and he always wanted a dragon. After the stranger brought Hagrid lots of drinks, the stranger said they could play cards for the dragon egg - but he had to be sure that Hagrid could handle a dragon. Hagrid had told the stranger that after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. He also told the stranger how to soothe Fluffy - just play him some music and Fluffy would go asleep. Hagrid immediately regrets telling the Trio this bit of information but he has no chance to explain more, <br />the Trio have gone off together.<br />Harry says the stranger had to be either Snape or Voldemort under the cloak, they have to go to Professor Dumbledore immediately. Although the Trio have no clue where Dumbledore's study is, they head inside the castle despite it being a glorious day.&nbsp; As they wander around the castle, they meet Professor McGonagall, who is none too pleased to see them. They say they have to see Dumbledore urgently - but they're out of luck, McGonagall says Dumbledore has gone to London, a urgent owl arrived from the Ministry of Magic.Harry says that they know all about the Philosopher's Stone and someone is trying to steal it.&nbsp; McGonagall is shocked that they know about the Stone, but says it is well protected. Snape appears and insists that the Trio go back outside. As they go, Snape says to Harry that any more night-time wanderings and he shall make sure Harry is expelled. The Trio know that they can't do anything else at the moment. Harry tells the other two that he is going through the trapdoor that night and going to try and get the Stone before Snape. If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back. Harry absolutely refuses to go over to the Dark Side. Hermione and Ron immediately agree. And they're going with Harry - did he think that they would allow Harry to go alone? They'd use the Invisibility Cloak and hope for the best.<br />Night-time approaches and Harry goes up to the dormitory for the Cloak - and picking up the flute Hagrid made for him for Christmas, it might come in useful. As the Trio prepare to leave Gryffindor common room under the Cloak, they're interrupted. Neville is in the common room too and tries to stop them going. Gryffindor will be even more trouble. Neville is standing in front of the portrait hole, he even threatens to fight all three of them! Hermione, very reluctantly, casts the full Body-Bind curse on Neville, there's no other choice. They leave Neville in the common room. After managing to escape the attentions of both Mrs Norris (Filch's cat)&nbsp; and&nbsp; Peeves - Harry pretends to be the ghost of Slytherin Tower, the Bloody Baron, to get past Peeves - they finally arrive at the third floor and make their way to the trap door. There is a harp near Fluffy - obviously Snape had managed to soothe Fluffy, and then gone through the trap door. <br />Hermione is provided with Hagrid's flute, to play to Fluffy, while Harry and Ron go through the trap door. At the bottom of the trap door is a plant to cushion their landing. But not a standard plant. When the boys are safe through the trap door and call Hermione to come down too, the boys realise that the plant is twining itself around them. Hermione knows it is Devil's Snare. After almost losing her head in panic, she manages to conjure a fire, the plant doesn't like warmth. They carry on up the passage. They enter a chamber full of winged birds ... but are they birds? No, they are winged keys. Harry realises that they have to catch a certain key to continue. And luckily there's broomstick in the chamber too. Harry's Seeker skills come in extremely handy as he catches the right key. The chamber they enter next, they seem to stand on the edge of a giant chessboard. They have to play their way across the board to go on. But luckily, Ron is a extremely good chess player. He will take the place of a black knight, while Harry will take the place of a black bishop and Hermione the place of a black castle. It is a extremely brutal game of chess. Finally, Ron realises that he will have to sacrifice himself so that Harry and Hermione can go on. Reluctantly, Harry and Hermione go into the next chamber, leaving Ron knocked out<br />They find a concussed troll in the next chamber. Harry and Hermione realise that each teacher used their own particular brand of magic on the obstacles. Professor Sprout's (the Herbology teacher) was the Devil's&nbsp;Snare, Professor Flitwick (the Charms teacher) put charms on the flying keys while Professor McGonagall Transfigured the chessman. That leaves Quirrell's obstacle and Snape's. In the next chamber, they find a concussed troll, which is very easily stepped over. The next chamber isn't too frightening - just a table with seven different bottles on it. Fire flames from doors which lead backwards and forwards. On the table is a riddle that says that three of the bottles are poison while two are wine. One of the bottles will take them foward while the final bottle will take them back. They are to chose. Harry is totally bemused by the riddle while Hermione looks relieved. This isn't magic - it's logic. And Hermione's very VERY good at logic. After thinking it through Hermione picks up two bottles - one will take them forwards while the other will take them back. Harry tells Hermione to drink the one that will take her back. She is to get Ron and to send Hedwig to Dumbledore. They need Dumbledore. Harry will drink the one which will go on to the last chamber. After a quick hug and saying friendship and bravery are much more important than books and cleverness (awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!) Hermione goes back. Harry takes a deep breath and drinks the other potion. He is able to walk through the door of flames into the last chamber. But wait! There's someone there already! And it's&nbsp; <span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><strong>NOT</strong></span> Snape <strong><span style=""font-size: xx-large;"">OR</span></strong> Voldemort ... <br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Ramblings<br />What a chapter! Jo does action-pack so well. Devil's Snare reappears in OoTP. Ron's expertise at chess comes in extremely handy during the chess match and Hermione's logical mind is so important. Harry's skills as a Seeker&nbsp; is vital for catching the right key.&nbsp; <br />"

"event","Chapter 15 - The Forbidden Forest<br /><br />After being caught by Filch - who always seems to be around exactly at the wrong time! - Harry and Hermione are marched to Professor McGonagall's office. Things are bad for them - and about to become much worse when McGonagall enters with Neville in tow. Neville was out of bed, he was going to warn Harry that Malfoy was going to catch Harry and Harry had a dragon. Harry tries to warn Neville to keep quiet, silently, but McGonagall soon realises what has been going on - Harry had told Draco a fairy story, to get him into trouble. She takes fifty House Points <strong>EACH</strong> off Harry, Hermione and Neville, and they will be serving detentions too. No student has the right to be wandering around after midnight. <br />The deduction of one hundred and fifty House Points from Gryffindor does not go down well with the other Gryffidnors. They turn against Harry, Hermione and Neville - and even the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turn against them, seeming they wanted Slytherin to lose the House Cup. About a week before the exams begin, Harry overhears Professor Quirrell whimpering in a empty classroom. Harry is pretty sure that Professor Snape has finally &quot;persuaded&quot;&nbsp; Quirrell to tell him how to get past Fluffy. Hermione says they should go to Professor Dumbledore and tell him everything they know - from the Philosopher's Stone to the stranger behavior of Snape. But Harry says they don't have proof - Dumbledore would believe Snape, not three first-years. Ron wants to do a bit of poking around, but Harry again says no. They don't need to be in any more trouble.<br />Harry, Hermione and Neville go to serve their detentions. They are told to meet Filch at 11 pm. When they meet Filch, he has Malfoy with him too. Obviously Draco will be serving a detention with the three Gryffindors. Filch marches the four first-years towards the Forbidden Forest, frightening them by muttering how he'd deal with them, if he was able to. Hagrid is near the Forest - Harry feels a little more relieved, at least they're going to do detention under Hagrid's supervision. Hagrid is going to take them into the Forest - there is a hurt unicorn in there, somewhere and they have to find it. Malfoy is extremely nervous of the Forest - he says that he's heard that there are werewolves in there - and is not pleased that he's going to do &quot;servants work&quot; as he considers it. Hagrid tells Malfoy to do what he says. They are going to split themselves into two groups and go in opposite directions - Draco with Neville, Harry and Hermione with Hagrid. Draco demands to have Fang with him too. Hagrid tells them to fire up green sparks, with their wands, if they find the unicorn. If they get into trouble, fire up red sparks. The two groups go off in opposite directions.<br />As they walk through the Forest with Hagrid, Hermione and Harry meet some centaurs - half man-half horse. Their names are Bane and Ronan. The centaurs warn them that<strong> &quot;Mars is bright tonight&quot;</strong>, and Ronan adds that <strong>&quot;Always the innocent are the first victims&quot;</strong>. Hagrid is extremely dismissive of the warnings, he tells Hermione and Harry that centaurs are &quot;deep&quot; and never try and get a straight answer from them. They're not interested in anything closer than the moon.They are distracted by red sparks - Draco and Neville are in trouble. Hagrid goes to rescue them, and returns with them, very annoyed. Draco had grabbed Neville as a joke, and Neville had fired the sparks. The groups are changed - now Hermione and Neville are with Hagrid and Harry is with Draco and Fang. Hagrid apologies to Harry but Draco will find it harder to scare Harry. <br />As Draco and Harry go deeper into the Forest, they find the unicorn ... dead. As they look at it, there is a slithering noise. A hooded figure bends over the unicorn and drinks it blood. Draco frightens it away by screaming and runs for it, leaving Harry.&nbsp; Harry's scar burns, it has never hurt as much before. There are the sound of hooves behind him and a palomino centaur appears. This is Firenze. He tells Harry to get on his back, he will take him to safety. As they travel through the Forest, there is a confrontation between Firenze and Bane and Ronan. Ronan and Bane are ashamed that Firenze has a human on his back, they're not common mules. Firenze tells the other centaurs that he is willing toset himself against whatever in lurking in the Forest, with humans beside him if he must. As Firenze and Harry head out of the Forest, Firenze asks Harry if he knows what unicorn blood is used for. The blood of a unicorn can keep you alive, even if you are a inch from death. Harry gradually puts two and two together - the Philosopher's Stone (the Elixir of Life) hidden in the castle, and unicorn blood. Voldemort was drinking the unicorn's blood ... shivers! Harry returns to the Gryffindor Tower, Ron is waiting for him and Hermione. Harry says Snape wants the Philosopher's Stone for Voldemort and Voldemort is waiting in the Forest. Hermione tries to reassure Harry - Dumbledore is the only one who Voldemort is frightened of. And with Dumbledore at Hogwarts, Voldemort can't touch Harry. When Harry returns to his dormitory, he finds his Invisibility Cloak under his sheets with a note that says &quot;Just In Case&quot;<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Something that has always puzzled me is why in the film they have Ron serving the detention instead of Neville. In the book, Ron was in the hospital wing and couldn't help take Norbert to his brother's friends.<br />I knows that Mars is the God of war, so when the centaurs say &quot;Mars is bright&quot;, they mean war is getting close - or Voldemort is getting stronger. But a phrase which has never been explained to be really is: <strong>&quot;Always the innocent are the first victims&quot;</strong>. Now I have read the whole series (lots of times!) I've imagined it refers to either Cedric (book 4) or Hedwig (book 7) but am open to new theories!"

"event","Chapter 14 - Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback<br /><br />Hermione is getting into a panic, their exams are &quot;only&quot; ten weeks away, she hasn't studied nearly enough, and she makes the boys revise too. As they are revising in the library, they find Hagrid lurking in there. When he says that they're not still trying to find out about Nicolas Flamel, Ron says that they already know about him. Hagrid looks horrified when he realises that the Trio know about what Fluffy is hiding. He tells them to come and see him later. After he leaves, Ron goes to look at what books Hagrid was looking about .... they are all about dragons. Harry says that Hagrid said he'd always wanted a dragon on his first meeting. Ron says dragon-breeding is now outlawed, but there are wild dragons in Britain - Welsh Greens and Hebridean Blacks. <br />The Trio go to see Hagrid. Unusually, all the curtains are close and Hagrid has a blazing fire despite the beautiful weather. Hermione persuades Hagrid to tell them what else is guarding the Philosopher's Stone. Hagrid says that Dumbledore borrowed Fluffy from him, and Dumbledore did some enchantments himself. Then Professors Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall did some enchantments, as did Professor Quirrell. Hagrid counts up the number of people who cast enchantments to protect the Stone. There was one more ... ah, yes, Professor Snape helped to protect the Stone. But Hagrid reassures the Trio - only he and Professor Dumbledore know how to get past Fluffy. But Harry is distracted by something in Hagrid's fire. In the middle of the fire is a huge black dragon's egg. Hagrid says it is going to be a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon. Hagrid explains to the horrified Trio that he won the dragon's egg in a bet - he played cards with a stranger. He's been reading up on how to raise dragons. The Trio know that is all going to go wrong.<br />The next day, Hagrid sends a note to the Trio with two words ... <strong>&quot;It's hatching&quot;</strong> Although the boys are willing to skip Herbology, Hermione makes them wait, and they go down to Hagrid's during their break. They watch the egg slowly hatch and a baby dragon emerge. Hagrid is totally in love with it, at first sight. Then Hagrid sees someone peeping through a gap in the curtains. It's Draco ... now he knows about the dragon too, and there is no where that he's going to keep it a secret. As the days go on, Hagrid becomes more fond of baby dragon - Norbert. But keeping a baby dragon in a wooden hut is not the best idea. Then Harry has a brainwave. Ron's brother, Charlie - who works in Romania with dragons - can take him! After some persuading, Hagrid agrees to the idea.<br />Charlie agrees to take the dragon in secret, he'll arrange to get some friends to meet the Trio and Norbert on top of the tallest tower - the Astronomy Tower - at midnight on Saturday. There's a hitch when Norbert bite Ron on the hand and he ends up in the hospital wing. So it is up to Hermione and Harry to take Norbert up the Tower, under the Invisibility Cloak, of course. Hagrid is totally heartbroken as he says goodbye to his pet. Hermione and Harry don't have a easy time of it, they see Professor McGonagall has caught Draco out of bed. Despite Draco's protests that Harry Potter has got a dragon, McGonagall refuses to believe him. This makes Harry and Hermione very happy, to see Draco in trouble. They finally hand Norbert over to Charlie's friends.&nbsp; Then they head down the Tower jubilantly and as they reach the bottom of the stairs ... they are faced with Filch. They've left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the Tower ...<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><strong>Ramblings</strong><br />I love the way Hagrid is so attached to Norbert, and the way he packed him rats, brandy and a teddy bear when Norbert is on his way with Charlie's friends.<br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>&quot;From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though teddy was having his head torn off.&quot;</strong></span><br />Awww, poor Hagrid and Norbert.<br />And another THIPS. Harry and Hermione take Norbert up the Astronomy Tower to meet Charlie's friend. The Astronomy Tower is pretty important in book 6 ... :-("

"event","Chapter 13 - Nicholas Flamel<br /><div style=""text-align: left;"">Harry tries his best to forget about the Mirror of Erised, but it is hard. He starts having nightmares about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light and a high voice cackling with laughter. Harry is loving Quidditch practice, but becomes nervous, when Wood tells him that Snape will be refereeing the next Gryffindor Quidditch match against Hufflepuff. Yes, Snape ... who has never refereed a match before and is sure to favour Hufflepuff, if it stops Gryffindor overtaking Slytherin. Harry goes to find Hermione and Ron immediately. They suggest that Harry breaks his leg, and doesn't play in the match, but Harry says there is no reserve Seeker, there's no way out of it.</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">Neville interrupts the Trio's whispered conversation by bunny-hopping into the Gryffindor common room. Malfoy has done the Leg-Locker curse on Neville. Luckily, Hermione knows the counter-curse and Neville is soon un-jinxed. Ron tells Neville he has to stand up to Malfoy and everyone else who uses him as a doormat. Neville says miserably that he knows he's not brave enough for Gryffindor. Harry tells Neville that he is worth twelve of Malfoy (Awwww!) and the Sorting Hat put him in Gryffindor, while Malfoy was Sorted into stinking Slytherin. He also offers Neville the last of his Christmas Chocolate Frogs. Neville decides to go to bed, and hands over the Chocolate Frog collectible card to Harry. Harry reads it, idly,&nbsp; Professor Dumbledore was the first card he ever got, on the Hogwarts Express. Then his mouth falls open.</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>&quot;Professor Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of <br />the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the <br />twelve uses of dragon's blood, <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">and his work on alchemy<br /> with his partner, Nicholas Flamel</span>.&quot;<br /></strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br />Hermione immediately goes to get a big book she got from the library for some &quot;light reading&quot;. They find out a lot more about Nicolas Flamel, and also, about the Philosopher's Stone. This Stone will turn any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which makes the drinker immortal. Obviously Fluffy is guarding the Stone. <br />The Quidditch match, Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff takes place. Hermione and Ron are in the stands, armed with their wands. They plan to do the Leg-Locker curse on Snape if he shows any sign of hurting Harry. While the game is taking place, high up in the air, Malfoy taunts Neville and Ron in the stands. Neville actually stands up to Malfoy, and declares he's worth twelve of him. While Ron and Neville have a fight with Malfoy and his two body-guard buddies, Harry catches the Snitch. Gryffindor are in the lead, they've overtaken Slytherin on points. Harry returns his broomstick to the broomshed later, feeling really, really happy. Then he sees Snape silently heading into the Forbidden Forest. Harry can't help it, he follows him, and lands in a tree, to spy on Snape. Snape is in a clearing ... having a conversation with Quirrell, who seems even more nervous than usual. Snape seems to be threatening Quirrell and asking him if he has found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet? Snape also mentions Quirrell's &quot;little bit of hocus pocus&quot;. So the Stone is safe as long as Quirrell stand up to Snape. As Ron says, it'll be gone by next Tuesday.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><strong>Ramblings</strong><br />First, a admission. I was in my 20's when Harry &quot;found&quot; me, and even though I must have come across the word <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Philosopher </strong></span></span>before, I didn't have a clue what it really was. So this book was a education to me. Truth be told, I've learned more Latin and about myths from Potter than from school! We get the first mention of Philosopher's Stone/Sorcerer's Stone in this chapter. It has always being surprising to me that the American title and British title are so different. <br />My love of Neville only got bigger as I read this chapter for the first time. I more or less fell in love with him on King's Cross station, bemoaning the fact that's he'd lost his toad, and the wrath of Gran Longbottom. I felt sorry for Neville as he is bullied by Snape - no wonder Neville is nervous at Potions, the way Snape bullies him.&nbsp; And then I began to gain a little respect for Neville when he has to tag along with the Trio, during &quot;the midnight duel that wasn't&quot;. True, he didn't have much choice, and the sight of Fluffy probably haunted him for a good while - but he still went along with the others. Of course his low self-esteem makes him believe that he isn't good enough for Gryffindor, and Malfoy saying so makes it worse. But he hands over that Chocolate Frog card to Harry. If he hadn't, they wouldn't have found out about Nicolas Flamel until Hermione had finished her &quot;light reading&quot; :-)<br />One thing I never noticed until this re-read (and I've read PS/SS loads of times!) is that the first years are writing down different ways of treating werewolf bites in Defence Against the Dark Arts. I feel sure this is foreshadowing of book three. <br />And another interesting sentence, when Harry gets the feeling Snape is following him ....<br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Philosopher's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could - <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds</span>. </strong></span><br />Isn't Jo wonderful, the way she slips things in? :-)<br />&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</div>"

"event","Chapter Twelve - The Mirror of Erised<br /><br />Before my ramblings, and I have said this a lot of times, this is one of my top three chapters of the whole series (the others being <strong>Christmas on the Closed Ward </strong>in OoTP and &quot;The Prince's Tale&quot; in DH). It's a unbelievably sensitively written chapter, and, hard to believe, the editors tried to persuade Jo to leave the chapter out of the book. Shakes head in disbelief. Anyway, into the chapter!<br /><br />Christmas is approaching rapidly and the weather is getting colder. Harry decides to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas instead of returning to Privet Drive. It's possible he might actually get to celebrate a &quot;real&quot; Christmas for the first time. Ron, the Twins and Percy are staying at Hogwarts too, Mr and Mrs Weasley are going to Romania, to see Ron's older brother, Charlie. The Trio are still trying to find out who Nicholas Flamel is, after Hagrid slipped up and mentioned him in connection with the three-headed dog, the mysterious package and Professor Dumbledore. They spend their spare time in the school library. Harry feels sure that he's read Flamel's name somewhere. Hermione is going home for Christmas.<br />On Christmas Day Harry wakes up in his dormitory to find ... <strong>PRESENTS</strong>! He's not used to presents at any time of the year. Hagrid has made him a wooden flute which sounds a little like a owl. And the Dursleys actually remembered Harry existed and sent him something too ... shock! horror!. Granted, it is a fifty pence piece, but it is the thought that counts, right? :-) Ron is fascinated by the shape of the fifty-pence piece.&nbsp; Mrs Weasley has sent Harry a &quot;Weasley jumper&quot;, knitted in emerald green and some home-made fudge. Ron told her that Harry wasn't expecting any presents. All the other Weasley boys Weasley jumper too - Harry is very touched by the present. Hermione has sent Harry some Chocolate Frogs. This leaves one more present. Harry unwraps it ... it's a Cloak. But not an ordinary Cloak ... a Invisibility Cloak! You become completely invisible when you put the Cloak on. There is a note with the Cloak. The note says: <strong>&quot;Your father left this in my possession before he died.  It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. A very Merry Christmas  to you.&quot;</strong>&nbsp; There is nothing to say who sent it.&nbsp; Harry puts it away safely, then goes off with the other Weasley boys to enjoy Christmas.<br />Christmas dinner is magnificent, with every type of food imaginable. Harry goes off to play in the snow with the Weasley's later. When he goes off to bed, he lies awake, thinking about the Cloak. The temptation to try it out is too much - he wants to use it, the first time, by himself, not with Ron. He decides to head to the library, and find out who Flamel was. Harry immediately goes to the Restricted section - you need a specially signed note from a teacher to look at the books in the Restricted section, but here is a golden opportunity for Harry. As Harry opens one of the books, the book starts screaming. Harry stands quite still as Filch enters the library, attracted by the noise. Harry manages to slip around Filch and heads in the opposite direction. Then he hears Filch speaking to Snape, saying that someone had been wandering around the Restricted section. Harry hides in an nearby room.<br />The room is like a disused classroom - except there is a magnificent mirror in the room too. It has a inscription on it. <strong>Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi</strong>. Harry can not resist looking in the mirror, with his Cloak on, and seeing no reflection. He stares into the mirror - and gets the shock of his life. It seems as if there are a crowd of people standing behind him ... but he is the only one in the room. He stares in the mirror again. A woman is smiling at him, although she seems to be crying. Her eyes are exactly the same shape and colour as Harry's. A man comforts the woman, a man who wears glasses and has untidy hair ... again, exactly like Harry. Harry is seeing his parents for the very first time. Harry finally tears himself away from the mirror and goes to bed. <br />Ron wants to go with Harry to see the mirror too, so the boys return to the classroom the next night. Harry sees his parents again but Ron sees something different. He sees himself older, as Head Boy. He's holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup. Why is it that the boys see such different things? Mrs Norris is prowling around, so the boys head to bed. Harry is become totally obsessed by the mirror. Although he has been almost caught twice, he returns to the classroom a third night, to gaze at his parents. As he looks at his parents, he is horrified to realise that he's not the only one in the room - so is Professor Sumbledore. But Harry doesn't seem to be in trouble at all. Dumbledore says that the mirror is called the Mirror of Erised, and it shows you your deepest desires of your heart. Harry sees his parents because he has never seen them before, while Ron sees himself the best of all his brothers - he is always overshadowed by them. But this mirror can drive people mad. It will be moved to a new place and Harry is not to go looking for it. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Before Harry leaves Dumbledore, he asks what Dumbledore sees in the mirror. Dumbledore's answer is surprising - he sees himself holding a pair of thick wollen socks. As Harry drifts off to sleep, in the dormitory, he wonders if Dumbledore was telling the truth or not ...<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Ramblings<br />One sentence, near the beginning of the chapter, sticks out at me. <br /><strong>&quot;The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his urban.&quot;</strong><br />For a first time reader of this book, and knowing the Twins, you'd think it mildly amusing. Quirrell is usually the but of jokes. But think about it. Later in the book we find that Lord Voldemort has been residing in the back of Quirrells turban for a good month or so now. Just imagine iFred and George knew that they were actually aiming snowballs at Voldemort himself? I feel sure they'd thrown even worse things than snowballs! I always find that little sentence hilarious :-D<br />I'm afraid if I ever got to look into the Mirror - and how fantastic that  <strong>Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi</strong> says<strong> I show not your face but your hearts desire</strong> backwards, or in &quot;mirror writing&quot; if you will - I would see exactly the same as Harry, people I've loved who'd gone on. And I really do not think I'd have the will-power not to look in it all the time. Best I never look in it, I think!<br /><br /><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/JaneMarple1/PSchapter1209.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />No idea of the artist but a beautiful image!"

"event","Chapter Eleven - Quidditch<br /><br />Before I begin, I have to say that I have never been a massive fan of Quidditch. Maybe this is why I don't like Goblet of Fire as much as the others. The best thing in Quidditch for me is Lee Jordan's commentary (surpassed by Luna's commentary in book six! :-D ) and Harry, of course.<br />So Hermione has finally become best friends with Ron and Harry, forming the exclusive Trio. And since she has got friends, she seems to willing to bend the rules more. The Trio are in the courtyard, the day before Harry's first Quidditch game against Slytherin. Harry is making the opportunity of reading<strong> Quidditch Through the Ages</strong> by Kennilworthy Whisp, trying to ease his nerves. Then Snape comes across the yard ... and he is limping. He heads towards the Trio and says that library books aren't to be taken outside the school. He takes the book, and also five points from Gryffindor.<br />Harry is bored that evening and decides to approach Snape and ask for the book back. He goes to the staff room, Snape and Filch are in there, Filch is bandaging Snape's leg. Harry hears Snape muttering<strong> &quot;How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?&quot;</strong> before Snape sees Harry. Snape yells at Harry to get out. Harry tells Hermione and Ron that he is after whatever the three-headed dog is guarding. After all, Harry and Ron saw Snape heading to the third floor on Hallowe'en night. <br />Harry is extremely nervous the next day. All the students assemble around the Quidditch pitch. Harry knows that he has a lot of support from most of the Gryffindors. Wood gives the Gryffindor team a last rallying talk before they go and face the Slytherin team. The Slytherin captain is Marcus Flint, Harry thinks he has some troll blood in him. Madam Hooch is the referee, and demands a nice fair game ... she seems to be talking to Flint more than Wood. And finally ... they're off! Harry's first ever Quidditch match.<br />Fred and George Weasley's best friend, Lee Jordan, is the commenter for the match, and does a exceedingly amusing commentary, with McGonagall's beady eye on him. Lee finds it very hard to be impartial. Hagrid comes to sit with Hermione and Ron, Harry seems to be doing all right, as is the Gryffindor team. Harry thinks he sees the Snitch and dives for it, but it is just a illusion. The Slytherin team start to play dirty. But now Harry's broom starts misbehaving. It is trying to jerk him off. But, as Hagrid says to Hermione and Ron, nothing can interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark Magic. But Hermione sees something strange going on.<br />Snape seems to be muttering under his breath, in the stands. Hermione and Ron are convinced that he is jinxing Harry's broom. Hermione leaves the others, works her way over to Snape ... accidentally knocking Professor Quirrell over as she does so ... and sets fire to Snape's robes. The distraction is enough for Harry to regain control of his broomstick. Hermione then bottles up the fire, and works her way back to the Gryffindors. It only took a few moments.<br />Harry is still on the look-out for the Snitch. Suddenly, he sees it, and catches it in his mouth - nice going Harry! Gryffindor beat Slytherin 170 points to 60. The Trio have tea in Hagrid's hut, Hermione and Ron tell Harry about how Snape was cursing his broom. Hagrid snorts in disbelief, Snape's a teacher! Why would he want to do something like that? Harry tells Hagrid their theory about Snape wanting to steal whatever the three-headed dog is guarding. Hagrid is surprised - how did they know about Fluffy? Fluffy belongs to him, he brought him off a Greek chappie in a pub. He warns the Trio to stop meddling things which don't concern them. That's to do with Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel .... oops. Hagrid regrets letting Nicholas Flamel's name slip out immediately.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Significant Sentences<br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><strong>&quot;He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,&quot; </strong></span>Flint was still howling twenty minutes later ...... <br />(We don't know exactly HOW significant this sentence is until book seven. Oh Jo, how well you hide little details for us Muggles to overlook and then to kick ourselves!!)<br />And from the American edition (Dean states Red Card in the British edition, and Ron just says you can't send people off in Quidditch, and what's a Red Card?)<br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><strong>&quot;In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!&quot;</strong></span><br />I just like the additional information!"

"event","<strong>Chapter 10 - Hallowe'en</strong><br />Harry and Ron quite enjoyed their night-time adventure, but Hermione is more or less ignoring the boys, regretting her impulse to join them, and Neville just never wants to see the three headed dog again. Harry is thinking that the dog is guarding the grubby package that Hagrid removed from Gringotts.<br />The next day, Harry receives a parcel - his new broomstick. And not any old broomstick - a Nimbus Two Thousand, the best broomstick there is. Draco tries to get Harry into trouble with Professor Flitwick, by telling him that first years aren't supposed to have brooms - but Flitwick knows all about the special circumstances and congratulations him on getting on the Gryffindor team. Harry learns all about Quidditch from Oliver Wood, and he turns out to be a very good Seeker. Seekers are the most important players - the game only ends when the golden Snitch is caught by the Seeker.<br />It is now Hallowe'en - 31st October. The first years are doing well in their Charms lessons too - they get to try and make objects fly. Harry is partnered with Seamus, Ron is partnered with Hermione. Predictably, Hermione manages to get her feather to float a few inches, much to Ron's disgust. He states to Harry that it's no wonder anyone can stand Hermione, she's a nightmare. Most unfortunately, Hermione overhears and runs off, extremely upset.&nbsp; Ron feels a little guilty as they go for the Hallowe'en feast, with no sign of Hermione.<br />In the middle of the feast, Professor Quirrell bursts into the Great Hall, declaring there's a troll in the dungeon before fainting. The Prefects are commanded to escort everyone to their Towers. During the confusion, Harry says to Ron that Hermione doesn't know about the troll, she's hiding in the girl's toilets. They've got to warn her. As they sneak off, they see Snape heading towards the third floor. Why isn't he with the other teachers. Ron and Harry manage to lock the troll in a room.  Whoops -it's the girl's bathroom, where Hermione is hiding. Harry and Ron somehow manage to overpower the troll, and Ron's wand manages to go up the troll's nose ... nice!! All the noise brings the teachers to toilets. The boys are sure they are going to be really big trouble, but Hermione - the know-it-all, who sticks to rules all the time - tells a deliberate lie, it is her fault. She thought she could handle the troll by herself. McGonagall takes five points off Hermione, but awards Harry and Ron five points. When they are go up to Gryffindor Tower, they all apologise to each other and they obviously become friends.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Favourite quotes<br /><strong>&quot;Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor.&quot;</strong><br />We don't know this until book five, but wise move, Harry, looking at the floor. First sign of Occlumency, Legilmency in the series.<br /><strong>&quot;But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.&quot;</strong><br />Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! :-)"

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><strong>Chapter 9 - The Midnight Duel</strong></span><br /><br />Harry is managing at Hogwarts. He isn't top of the class - that place is reserved for Hermione Granger, who seems to know everything - and his least favourite class is Potions, but he is enjoying his new life. They are also going to have flying lessons. The only downside about this is that they'll be doing this class with the Slytherins,<br />On the day of the flying lesson, Neville's grandmother sends Neville a Remembrall, it helps you remember when you've forgotten something. Very useful for&nbsp; Neville Draco Malfoy tries to take it, but McGonagall steps in. The flying lessons are taught by Madam Hooch - they use the school brooms, which are rather battered. Hooch gives them their instructions, before their first flight. But poor Neville jumps&nbsp; the gun. Nervous already, he shoots upwards on his broom. Higher and higher he goes before .... WHAM. He falls off, leaving his broom still in the air.. Hooch takes him off to the hospital wing, it's a broken wrist. She warns the class to stay on the ground.<br />Some chance of that! Draco spots Neville's Remembrall, and immediately swoops on it, and hurls insults about Neville to the Gryffindors. Harry calmly tells Draco to hand the Remembrall over. Instead Draco flies off on his broomstick, with the Remembrall, and taunts Harry. Harry acts fast. Without ever being of a broomstick before, he immediately mounts it - despite Hermione's warning that he'll get them all in trouble - and takes off for the first time. To his amazement, he feels at home in the air, he'd found something he could do without being taught. And now there is a confrontation between Draco and Harry in the air. Draco deliberately throws the Remembrall in the air. Harry races the Remembrall and catches it - much to the admiration of the Gryffindors below. But ... OH NO! Here come's Professor McGonagall and she does not look happy.<br />McGonagall frog-marches Harry to the castle, not listening to any explainations at all. Harry is sure that he is going to be expelled immediately. What on earth is he going to do? Go back to the Dursleys? McGonagall calls in Professor Flitwick's class (the Charm's teacher) and asks &quot;could I borrow Wood for a moment?&quot; A burly fifth year joins Harry and McGonagall.&nbsp; This is Oliver Wood - the Gryffindor Quidditch captain. McGonagall tells Wood that Harry would make a fantastic Seeker. The Gryffindor team need some new blood, Slytherin have beaten them six years in a row, they haven't won properly since Charlie Weasley (Ron's brother) left.&nbsp; McGonagall says that they will find a way to bend the rule that first year's are not allowed their own brooms. She ends by saying Harry's father would be proud - he was a Quidditch player too.<br />Ron is impressed that Harry has been put on the team. Fred and George are also on the Quidditch team. Draco and his two henchmen are very disappointed that Harry has not been expelled, Draco challenges Harry to a Wizard's Duel at midnight that night. Crabbe is his second, Ron will be Harry's second. A second is there to take over, if the original wizard dies. At midnight, Harry&nbsp; and Ron sneak out of their dormitory and head to the trophy room. As they sneak out, Hermione tries to stop them. They will be expelled, don't they care about Gryffindor? She follows them, hissing venom as she goes. When they reach the Fat Lady's portrait, there is no Fat Lady, Hermione is locked out of the Tower. There's no choice, Hermione has to go with them. To add to Harry and Ron's troubles, they next find Neville outside the Tower, waiting for someone to let him in. So two become four. They reach the trophy room, with no sign of Malfoy or Crabbe.<br />As they wait there, they hear Filch the caretaker prowling around. They don't want to be caught by anyone - least of all Filch -  so run away. They don't pay attention which direction they are going, and find a empty corridor. Then they are intercepted by Peeves, and are taunted by him, Peeves is sure to bring Filch to the scene. Hermione manages to open a locked door,&nbsp; and the four of them hides from Filch. But they are not alone - the door leads into a corridor ... the third floor corridor. And what should be looking right at them but a three headed dog? Eeeeeeeeeeekkkkkkkkkkkkk! The four Gryffindor students run for their lives, up to Gryffindor Tower. And thankfully the Fat Lady has returned, so they can get in. Hermione says didn't the boys notice that the dog was standing on a trapdoor? It is obviously guarding something. She goes off to bed in a huff with Harry and Ron.&nbsp; Harry thinks over this bit of information.  Hagrid said Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide - except Hogwarts. It looks as if he's found out where Hagrid hid tat grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><strong>THIPS</strong><br />Hary being so at home on the broomstick. He didn't know that he was flying a broomstick at one year old :( <br /><br /><strong>Favourite quotes</strong><br />So many memorable quotes in this chapter but:<br /><strong>&quot;I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed - or worse, expelled. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.&quot;</strong> by Hermione and<br /><strong>&quot;Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, but can I borrow Wood for a moment?&quot;</strong> by the wonderful McGonagall&nbsp; stick long in the memory!<br />"

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><strong>Chapter 8 - The Potions Master</strong></span><br /><br />Harry has his first week at Hogwarts. He begins to realise exactly how famous he is - everywhere he goes, people stare at him. Ron&nbsp; seems to have become Harry's &quot;best friend&quot; pretty quickly. And even after the warning that they are to stay away from the third floor corridor from&nbsp;Dumbledore, Argus Filch, the grumpy caretaker, finds Harry and Ron near it. Luckily for the boys, Professor Quirrell comes along and &quot;rescues&quot; them. I was pretty sure that Quirrell was going to be rather a rubbish teacher at Defence Against the Dark Arts, when I saw him in the Leaky Cauldron. I was right - he isn't a confident teacher and seems nervous all the time.<br />The other teachers are just as interesting. We get a actual ghost teaching History of Magic - Professor Binns. And McGonagall teaches Transfiguration with a firm hand - Hermione is the only one who seems to do well it the class. And Harry takes his first ever Potions lesson with Professor Snape - the hooked-nosed, greasy-haired teacher who Harry saw talking to Professor Quirrell. Snape definitely knows his stuff - he is almost fanatical about Potions - and knows how to control the class. But he takes delight by asking Harry questions that he obviously will not know, ignoring Hermione who seems to know the answers. Snape also gives poor Neville Longbottom a put-down, when Neville accidentally melts his Potion partner's cauldron, calling him a &quot;idiot boy&quot; and blaming Harry and Ron for Neville adding the wrong ingredients.<br />After a disastrous Potions lessons, Harry and Ron go to Hagrid's hut for tea and rock-cakes. Harry is convinced Snape hates him, Hagrid reassures him that he doesn't .... but not very reassuringly. Harry browses <strong>The Daily Prophet</strong> and notices that there was a break-in at Gringotts on the actual day Hagrid and Harry were there. How very curious. <br /><strong><br />Ramblings</strong><br />I think the Potions lesson has the most THIPS in this chapter - in fact this chapter is littered with THIPS. We get the mention of Bezoars (reappears in book six - and thank Heavens Harry remembered this, it saved Ron's life!) and a mention of the wolfsbane potion (I reckon that is foreshadowing book three) and finally Draught of Living Death. This potion is created in Slughorn's first lesson, so why on earth did Snape ask the first-years about a sixth-year potion? Although Hermione is a annoying know-it-all, we've got to feel sorry for her in Potions, being ignored. Snape had some fabulous quotes in this chapter.&nbsp; The article in <strong>The Daily Prophet</strong> gives us actual canon, that Harry's birthday is 31st July (as is Jo's!). We didn't know this before this chapter.<br /><strong><br />Differences and the Unexplained</strong><br />I like the description of Hagrid's rock cakes. <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><strong>The rock cakes almost broke their teeth ... </strong></span>occurs in the British editions but the American editions have <strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth ...&nbsp; </span></strong>I find the American version so much more descriptive :-D<br />And<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/JaneMarple1/PSchapter801.jpg"" /><br />This is the chapter image for this chapter. I know this chapter is entitled <strong>&quot;The Potions Master&quot;</strong> but is this the Potions book that Harry and the other first-years use or is it another set book?

"event","Chapter Seven - The Sorting Hat<br /><br />So Harry actually gets into Hogwarts - the first years are greeted by Professor McGonagall, the deputy Head. She explains that there are four houses - Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor and Slytherin. Harry remembers that Hagrid said Lord Voldemort was in Slytherin when he was a boy ... shivers!. McGonagall continues that whichever House they are Sorted in, will be like their family at Hogwarts, they can gain points for their House, and also lose them. She leaves the first years and Harry is left worrying how exactly he will be Sorted. Ron says that Fred said the Sorting hurts a lot. Before being led into the Great Hall to be Sorted, the first years see a crowd of Hogwarts ghosts.<br />The first years are Sorted by sitting on a stool and putting a battered old hat - the Sorting Hat - on their heads. Hermione is immediately Sorted in Gryffindor - to Ron's disgust! - and so is the toad-owner, Neville Longbottom, after the Hat considers for a little while. Draco Malfoy gets his wish and immediately Sorted into Slytherin. Finally it's Harry's turn. Every eye is on him as he places the Hat on his head. As he sits on the stool, Harry thinks desperately <strong> &quot;Not Slytherin, Not Slytherin&quot;</strong>. Although the Hat says that Harry would fit in Slytherin, it would help him on his way to greatness, Harry is Sorted into Gryffindor, and joins the Weasley Twins, Percy the Prefect and the others. Much to his relief, Ron is also Sorted into Gryffindor.<br />The Great Hall provides a luxurious feast,&nbsp; all of Harry's favourite food, and Harry has the chance to look around the Hall, examine the enchanted ceiling and see Professor Dumbledore properly, for the first time, as well as the other teachers. Professor Quirrell is talking to a greasy-haired, hooked nosed man. As Harry looks at the hooked-nose teacher, his scar burns.<br />After the meal, and a few words from Dumbledore - warning everyone that the third floor corridor is out of bounds to everyone as is the forest near the school - and a encounter with the Hogwarts Poltergeist, Peeves, Harry and the others are led to Gryffindor common room and to their dormitory, where Harry has a strange dream about the Sorting Hat and the hooked-nosed teacher before falling asleep.<br /><br /><strong>Ramblings</strong><br />I love the description of Hogwarts, and the meals. Obviously Harry isn't going to go hungry at Hogwarts! I can't blame Harry saying &quot;not Slytherin, not Slytherin,&quot; before being the Sorting and I was relieved to see him Sorted into Gryffindor. This chapter features my first &quot;head-desk&quot; moment in the Potter-verse. Back in 2006, I joined the Leaky Lounge Reading Groups, and they were doing Philosopher's Stone. I thought I knew a reasonable amount about the series, and was loving the discussion. But one thing always bothered me. Why did Harry's scar hurt when Snape was looking at him? (Remember, HBP was out by then, so we knew about Occlumency etc) Then another very friendly member reminded me - <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>Snape was talking to Quirrell</strong></span></span>. I'd read Philosopher's Stone loads of times now, but this red herring is so so clever.<br /><br /><strong>Differences between PS/SS</strong><br />I forgot to mention one of the more famous differences in the last chapter. All to do with Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans - <strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">the Booger Flavoured one</span></strong> over<strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""> the Bogey flavoured one</span></strong>. I find it so amusing!<br />Also, <strong>&quot;Thomas Dean&quot;</strong> is Sorted in SS, while in PS Dean isn't Sorted. How curious."

After their encounter with Hagrid, the Dursleys virtually ignore Harry (which suits Harry fine) and Dudley is more or less terrified of being in the same room as Harry. Vernon unwillingly agrees to drop Harry off at King's Cross Station on September 1st - but if they didn't have to take Dudley to a hospital to have his tail removed, they wouldn't have been bothered.  Although the image of Dudley having a tail removed is funny, it's got to be painful for him.<br />The Dursleys are unusually helpful at King's Cross and helps Harry to the platform. Then Harry realises why - there's a platform nine ... there's a platform ten ... but no platform Nine and Three Quarters. The Dursleys leave Harry in the busy station, not bothered what Harry does next. Nice people! Harry begins to panic - the train leaves soon, he hasn't got a clue how to get onto the platform, and he's surrounded by Muggles. But wait ... could there be help in the shape of a family of red-heads who have a owl with them? Desperately, Harry asks for help. The woman - who is escorting her four sons to school, accompanied by her younger daughter - reassures him, and tells him to walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Doubtfully Harry does this ... and it works! He's on platform Nine and Three Quarters, in front of the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam train, and Harry tries to find a empty carraige. As he walks along the platform, he passes a round-faced boy about his own age, bemoaning the flat that he's lost his pet toad, and his sever grandmother ticking him off. Our first introduction to my personal favourite character in the series - Neville Longbottom.<br />Two of the red-haired boys who showed him the way onto the platform - they are twins, by the names of Fred and George Weasley - help Harry put his trunk into a empty carriage, and Harry overhears Mrs Wealsey saying goodbye to her sons. The oldest son - Percy - is a prefect, while the youngest red-head - Ron - is starting Hogwarts for the first time. The little girl - Ginny - is desperate to attend Hogwarts&nbsp; but is too young. The Weasley twins have recognised Harry immediately, they tell their mother all about helping Harry load his trunk. They want to ask Harry what happened when his parents were killed, but Mrs Weasley is firm, and says no. Ron shares Harry's carriage and they soon become friendly, especially with the help of wizarding sweets - the Chocolate Frogs are particularly interesting, seeming it gives some information on Dumbledore,<br />The round-faced boy enters the carriage - his name is Neville Longbottom -&nbsp; and asks if they have seen a toad, then returns with a bossy, bushy-haired girl, by the name of Hermione Granger.  She seems to know a lot already, and hopes to be sorted into Gryffindor House. Ron shows Harry his pet - a boring grey rat, called Scabbers. It belonged to his older brother, Percy. Ron seems to have a lot of hand-me-down things, obviously the Weasleys aren't exactly well-off. Speaking of well-off ... the pale young boy, who Harry met in Madam Malkin's, enters the carriage with two boys who look like his bodyguards. The &quot;bodyguards&quot; are Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, while the pale boy is Draco Malfoy. Draco is much more interested in Harry than their last meeting - now he knows who he is! - and extremely condescending to Ron. He offers to help Harry find out who the &quot;right sort&quot; are. Harry coldly says he can work out the right sort for themselves. Scabbers the rat bites Gregory Goyle, and then Draco and his bodyguards disappear. The train gets nearer to Hogwarts, and Hagrid escorts Harry and the other first years to Hogwarts Castle by boat. Neville's toad is found too.<br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><strong>Quick ramblings</strong></span><br />It was so obvious, as soon as Harry and Ron shared the same carriage, that they would be best friends forever. I absolutely loved the Weasley family - Harry picked the right people for directions to platform nine and three quarters. I even liked Percy the Prefect! I am so glad Draco and his family were not nearby. The introduction of Hermione was also interesting. I was sure that she was going to be friends with&nbsp; either Harry or both Ron and Harry, but she needed to learn not to be so bossy - didn't make the best impression! Draco is even more horrible than he was in Madam Malkin's. And now, Harry is off to Hogwarts itself!"

Hagrid takes Harry away from &quot;The Hut on the Rock&quot;, leaving the Dursleys stranded ... awww! :-D Hagrid and Harry travel to London, and enter The Leaky Cauldron pub, where Harry is greeted warmly by all the witches and wizards in there. He even gets to meet one of his new teachers - Professor Quirrell, a very nervous young man, who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts. As Harry enters Gringotts bank, and to his vault, escorted by Hagrid and the goblin, Griphook, he realises he won't have to worry about money while attending Hogwarts - his vault is full of gold Galleons, silver Sickles and bronze Knuts. Hagrid also picks up a mysteriously small grubby package from another vault.<br />Harry goes to be measued up for his Hogwarts uniform, at Madam Malkins, and gets the opportunity of meeting a wizard his own age. This is Draco Malfoy, and seems extremely sure of himself. Although first years are not allowed to bring a broomstick to Hogwarts, he plans to persuade his parents to buy him one anyway. Harry is glad when he is able to escape the dressmakers.<br />Hagrid has got Harry a extra present of his pet - a snowy owl. After buying all their school supplies and school books, they head to Ollivanders the wandmakers. Harry finds Mr Ollivander extremely mysterious, and is not sure he likes him. Mr Ollivander says that<strong> &quot;The Wand chooses the Wizard&quot;&nbsp;</strong>not the other way around.&nbsp; After trying lots of wands, Harry finds a wand that suits him - Holly and Phoenix feather, eleven inches. After Harry buys the wand, Ollivander says it is very curious - the phoenix whose tail feather is in Harry's wand, gave only one more feather. Ollivander remembers selling Lord Voldemort his wand - Yew, thirteen and a half inches with a phoenix feather. It is curious that Harry is destined for his wand, when its brother gave Harry his scar. Hagrid take Harry back to the Dursleys, until term starts at Hogwarts on September 1st ... shame!<br /><br /><strong>Ramblings</strong><br />I loved how Diagon Alley was described. And another great play-on words by Jo - Diagon Alley = Diagonally. I can only imagine how Harry must had felt, his fist foray into the wizarding world. I took a instant dislike to the pale young boy (we find out that's it Draco Malfoy in the next chapter!) , for me, even with his brief appearance, was the wizard equivalent of Dudley - thought a lot of himself, obviously got everything he wanted off his parents etc and didn't think much of witches and wizards who didn't know about Hogwarts. I loved Hagrid in Ollivanders, the way he immediately looked guilty when Ollivander said Hagrid's wand was snapped in half, after he was expelled. It is so obvious that the broken pieces are inside the pink umbrella! :-)<br /><br /><strong>THIPS <br /></strong>I think the most THIPS are in Ollivanders, with wand-lore. I likes the way Lily Potter's wand was good at Charm work&nbsp; (I am pretty sure she would have excelled at every lesson) and Jame's wand was excellent for transfiguration (big, big THIPS there!). Of course we get the first mention of the history between Harry's and Voldemort's wand. And Griphook the Goblin takes Harry and Hagrid to Harry's vault (the series comes full circle again in book seven).<br /><br /></span><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The Unexplained</span></strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><em><br /></em></span><strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><em>Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad</em></span>.</strong><br /> I know we're jumping ahead a chapter, but no mention of pet rats. Interesting .... <br />And HOW did the Dursleys get away from the Hut on the Rock, seeming Harry and Hagrid used the boat? There again ... who cares? :-D</span>"

For it was Rubeus who was knocking at the shack, and makes his grand entrance - frightening the three Dursleys into seven fits! He does look scary but he's also extremely kind-hearted - as he handed a chocolate birthday cake to Harry, I knew Harry's life was never going to be the same again .... yay!<br />Harry is told he isn't a &quot;normal boy&quot; as he believes, he's a <strong>WIZARD</strong>. As Harry digests this massive surprise, he realises all the things that he had done, which had annoyed the Dursleys, was part of him being a wizard. Harry is told exactly how his parents - Lily and James - died, they were killed by a great sorcerer, Lord Voldemort, who had killed lots of witches and wizards. But after failing to kill Harry - and that's how he got his scar - Voldemort went into hiding. Harry's name has been down at Hogwarts, a wizarding school, since he was born, and Hagrid is going to make sure he finally reads his letter from Hogwarts,<br />Vernon declares Harry isn't attending Hogwarts, while Petunia starts venting about her &quot;freak sister&quot;, Lily - Lily and James Potter were also a witch and wizard. Hagrid totally ignores the Dursleys, reassuring Harry that he is going to the best wizarding school - seven years at Hogwarts and he won't know himself. The head of Hogwarts is Professor Albus Dumbledore,  the deputy head is Professor Minerva McGonagall. After Vernon declares that he isn't going to let &quot;some crackpot of fool&quot; teach Harry &quot;magic tricks&quot;,&nbsp; Hagrid loses his temper and threatens the Dursleys with his pink umbrella ( :-D ) and gives Dudley a pigs-tail for good measure. For me, this might improve Dudley's appearance! :-D After all the excitement, Harry settles down to sleep under Hagrid's coat.<br /><br /><strong>Ramblings</strong><br />No major differences between the British and American text. What I like the most about the American editions - as well as the chapter art - is the &quot;real handwriting&quot; for the letters, while the British editions has them in plain text.<br /><br /><strong>THIPS</strong><br />Lots of them!&nbsp; The main one is Petunia's rant about Lily. We get to know why Petunia's so bitter in book 7 and subtle hints in book 5. And Hagrid admitting he was expelled in his third year at Hogwarts and then quickly changing the subject ..."

"event","Chapter Three - The Letters from No One<br /><br />We jump ahead a few weeks (Dudley's birthday is June 23rd, according to some websites, although not confirmed by Jo) taking us to 29th or 30th July 1981. It's the summer holidays and Harry will be attending a different school than Dudley in September - he'll go to the local comprehensive,&nbsp;Stonewall High (sounds really lovely, doesn't it? :-D ) while Dudley is off to Vernon's old school, Smeltings. The Smeltings uniform is orange knickerbockers, maroon tailcoats and flat straw boater hats. Also a knobbly stick, used to hit people with. Is it me or do the Smelting sticks sound very much like the wizarding wands?<br />Harry gets post - for the first time ever. <div style=""margin-left: 40px;""><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(0, 128, 128);"">Mr H. Potter<br />The Cupboard under the Stairs<br />4 Privet Drive<br />Little Whinging<br />Surrey</span></em></strong></div>A unusually thick letter, and with a purple seal bearing the coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter &quot;H&quot;. I wonder who that letter is from? :-D Although Harry does his best to read his letter, it is taken from him by Uncle Vernon. Petunia and Vernon seem extremely disturbed by the letter. Most unusually, Vernon starts being kind to Harry after the letter arrives, and promotes Harry to Dudley's smallest bedroom. But the letters keep coming. Harry doesn't get to read the letters - Vernon and Petunia keep destroying them - but whoever is sending them seems determined to contact Harry ... <br />Sunday arrives. After twenty-four letters the previous day, the Dursleys breathe a sigh of relief - no post on Sundays. Oh isn't there?????? To their horror, letters start flying down the chimney. Vernon totally loses control, and tells the family to pack quickly - they're going away. They drive for what seems like hours with many U-turns. They stay the night at a gloomy hotel, but there is still no escape from the letters. There are about a hundred letters for Harry at the hotel, which Vernon immediately destroys. Harry realises that he is going to be eleven years old the next day. The Dursleys never make much of a fuss about his birthday - they gave him a pair of Vernon's old socks and a coat hanger last year. But he still looks forward to it. The Dursleys go to stay next in a gloomy little shack way out to sea. Harry lies on the floor, watching his birthday grow closer. The weather is getting gradually worse, strange noises outside.&nbsp; And as midnight, and Harry's birthday arrives ....<br /><strong>BOOM.<br />The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.</strong><br />(Well done, Jo, what a cliff hanger for the next chapter!)<br /><strong><br />Ramblings</strong><br />I love this chapter on so many levels, even without the dramatic ending. I think my favourite bit is Vernon and the letters.<br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.<br />&quot;No post on Sunday,&quot; he reminded them happily as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, &quot;no damn letters today - &quot;</em></span><br />What I find most amusing about this is that there actually<strong> IS</strong> a newspaper called &quot;The Sunday Post&quot;, a Scottish produced newspaper - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Post"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Post</a> , I know this because we (as in me and Mum) get it every Sunday. Dad used to go for the newspaper each Sunday, and the shopkeeper used to always say &quot;No Post on Sundays&quot;. Obviously a Potter-fan, such a shame Dad never understood the reference :-D<br /><strong><br />Differences</strong><br />The main difference between the American and British edition is the <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><strong>Mail slot</strong></span> in the American edition over the British <strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Letter box</span></strong>, Not a big difference, but it still looks unusual to my British eyes!

Privet Drive is almost the same - still as neat as tidy, with photos scattered around of the Dursleys beloved son, Dudley. Not a sign that another boy lives there, in a cupboard under the stairs no less. Harry Potter is virtually ignored by his Uncle and Aunt, bullied by cousin Dudley and made to do a lot of household jobs.<br />The chapter opens on Dudley's eleventh birthday - lucky Dudley gets thirty-seven presents, and seeming he doesn't think that is enough, a promise of two more while on his birthday outing later in the day. Does a eleven-year-old really need thirty-nine presents?? Obviously the Dursleys think so. Harry' s Uncle and Aunt plan to leave Harry with their neighbour, the cat-loving Mrs Figg, until she telephones to say that she have broken her leg. Reluctantly, Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia allow Harry to tag along on Dudley's birthday outing to the zoo, with one of Dudley's little friend, Piers Polkiss. Vernon looks horrified when Harry casually mentions that he had a dream of a flying motorbike. The Dursleys do not approve of such things!<br />Harry gets to go to the zoo for the first time, and is actually &quot;treated&quot; to a cheap lemon lolly ice and a knickerbocker glory when Dudley says the ice-cream isn't big enough. While in the reptile house, Harry comes across a boa-constrictor, and to his amazement, finds he can actually have a conversation with it. The snake tells Harry he was bred in the zoo, and somehow or other Harry manages to release it. The snake says &quot;Thankssss Amigo ... Brazil here I come,&quot; before escaping. This does not go down well with the Dursleys - obviously Harry's fault - and he is confined to the cupboard under the stairs for the foreseeable future ...<br /><br />Time for ramblings<br />The only many differences between the American text and British is that there are lots of pictures of Dudley wearing <strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Bonnets</span></strong> in the American edition and wearing <strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Bobble hats</span></strong> in the British text :-D The mention of Aunt Petunia trying to make Harry wear a jumper of Dudley's <strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Brown with orange puff balls</span></strong> changes to <strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Brown with orange bobbles</span></strong> in the British text. There is also the mention of the said jumper fitting a <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);""><strong>hand puppet</strong></span> over a <strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">glove puppet</span></strong>. <br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 128);""><strong>THIPS</strong></span><br />The first mention of the cat-loving neighbour Mrs Figg (wait for another four books to find out more about her!) and the way Harry can &quot;talk&quot; to snakes is foreshadowing for the following book. Theres also Harry's wistful thought that some unknown relation will come and take him away from the Dursleys (he has to wait another two books for this, and even then it doesn't work out exactly as planned! :-( ) and the unusual strangers who seem to know Harry.<br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);""><strong>Unexplained?</strong></span><br />And finally, the thing that has intrigued me most in this chapter. Piers Polkiss, Dudley's friend, who went to the zoo with the Durlsley's and Harry. After the snake had escaped from the zoo, Piers gets Harry into tremendous trouble ... <span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>&quot;Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?&quot;</strong></span> How very curious. None of the Dursleys noticed Harry talking to it. We know it is foreshadowing book two, but HOW did Piers know that Harry was talking to the snake? Piers initials, pre-Hallows, had me with many theories. <span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>P.P.&nbsp; </strong></span>I was pretty sure there was more to Piers than meets the eye - remember that there is another character in book three with the same initials. I was convinced Piers was going to do magic late on in life, as Jo had hinted someone would. However, she later changed her mind :-(<br /><br />"

It was a big thing for both me and Mum - and we wouldn't have been able to do it unless my sister and her hubby were already there. And then, to our amazement, we had the added surprise of my two nieces, a friend and the two Princes coming to join our holiday. I also met a &quot;internet friend&quot; for the first time, and a very pleasant time was had by all!<br />With the highs, you've got to have the lows. Two Uncles who I knew well died during 2010. One of<br />them - mum's sister's husband -&nbsp; had been in ill-health for a while. But my other uncle's death - dad's sister's husband - was unexpected, as he went for a reasonably simple operation, but never recovered. May those who have lost loved ones in 2010 find peace xxx<br />I'm not much of a person for world affairs - the co-government in England doesn't interest me much, and although I wish Prince William and his bride-to-be every happiness in April, when they marry, there is only one &quot;Prince William&quot; in my life :-D But one world event sticks in my memory - and I consider it a modern-day miracle. In August, 33 miners were trapped in a Chile mine. Somehow or other they all managed to survive, and, in October, all 33 were brought back to the surface, with the wonderful rescuers and the medical team. I remember watching the tv, as each miner was reunited with their families. Mum and I agreed it was the best thing that had happened in a long, long, time. And that tiny little capsule, what was sent to rescue each miner and their rescuers, was called <strong>Fenix</strong> , And by a stretch, it could be called Phoenix, bringing those brave miners from the ashes.<br />Tomorrow starts a brand new year. I do make resolutions, but only ones I can reasonably stick too :-D My main resolution in 2011 is to keep a eye on my weight. I do NOT want to become obese again, I'm not going to let it happen, and its not a option!! I shall limit the Christmas goodies to the weekend. My &quot;diet&quot; starts this coming Monday :-)<br />To keep this blog going, I plan to review Harry Potter (again!) from the very very beginning. Just my opinion on each chapter, character development, my favourite quotes in each chapter etc. That should keep me going, and take my mind off &quot;goodies&quot;!<br /><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">HERE'S TO 2011 and blessings to each and every person who has touched my life in 2010 xxxxx</span></strong></span><br />"

"event","Greetings to one and all, my wonderful blog friends.

Christmas comes but once a year (Believe it or not!) and I love every single second of it! Santa has been good to me so far (and not been to see my sis and her family yet!) and got me a brand new laptop. Well, really, my current one has become a little slow and noisy, and Mum's laptop is even slower than mine. So I am having the new one, Mum is having my &quot;old one&quot; and Mum's old one is going to just store pictures. What a clever Santa, to know just what we wanted!

Christmas Day also holds a special place in my heart. Four years ago - Christmas Day 2006 - I was browsing the Internet before settling down for a big meal, and my first visit was to the Leaky Lounge. I had become a reasonably active poster on the Harry Potter forum, especailly the Reading Groups. But as I logged into the Lounge that day, I was also asked to become a Moderator, to help look after the Lounge, - and, don't forget, the title of the seventh book had only been released days earlier. To be honest, I really needed something to take my mind of things. Dad had died six months earlier from Cancer, and it was a sad time. I jumped at the chance to help the Lounge.

And it was the best thing I ever did. I have &quot;met&quot; the most wonderful people on Skype. I might not ever meet them in the flesh, but&nbsp; I consider them friends ... best friends. I don't get to go places without Mum, so the virtual friends mean so much to me
Thank you to all my Harry Potter friends - those assosiated with the Lounge and those who have moved on. xxxx

(And yes, photos will be forthcoming tomorrow&nbsp; of the Princes :) )"

Food shopping is Mum's department, and she usually does the christmas goodies shop in little bits, and then store them away.<br /><br /><br /><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/JaneMarple1/BLOG%20ADVENT%20CALENDAR/1997SeptemberJanewithDelsvan1.jpg"" style=""width: 568px; height: 306px;"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Anyone who really appreciates good British comedy - even those overseas! - should recognise the distinctive three-wheel yellow Robin Reliant, which appears in Only Fools and Horses.

As long as they have four wheels and I have someone to take me to wherever the destination is, that is as much as I care about them!

Truth be told, I still have difficulty sleeping in December, even though I know everything (or more or less everything!) I am getting - I probably have seen Mum wrap up my presents. But no matter how old I am, I still love ripping open presents in the early (ish) hours!<br />My Christmas mornings used to start about 3 or 4 am (yep, three or four in the morning! :-o ) when I'd do my best to creep downstairs (usually with a torch) to open my presents. Open the presents while watching television. I never got really big presents when I was younger, nothing to todays standards, but Mum used to knit my Sindy dolls (and there was about 20 of them altogether) a new set of clothes, or run them up a new dress or two. Most of my presents would be Sindy related, or books. No surprise that my love of books has continued!<br />These days, I choose the sensible option and have the presents in my bedroom. Still have a Christmas stocking on my door handle, and I usually make sure that I have a new audio cd in it, so that after opening the presents (and I usually wait until 5 or 6 am these days!) I can curl up in bed with it.<br />The magic of Christmas ... and Santa ... will live on through &quot;the Princes&quot; :-D<br />"

A very unexpected present. <br />I have celebrated most birthdays at home, and some Aunts and Uncles are sure to call in during the time. But for my 18th and 21st, we had a nice family party at home, with everyone who could get there calling in. With Mum being one of 12, and Dad being one of 13 (and all 12 of his brothers and sisters are still living), you can imagine it was rather busy. Great fun though.<br />"

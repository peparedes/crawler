"event","Well I haven't written in a while so I figured I'd make a little entry.....Things are kinda normal around here until I leave my house, then I enter into the world of chaos again. IT is soooo crowded. I started my new job today (unofficially) at Rhino Video Games. I will officially start sometime this week or it may be Monday. I hope soon....I am broke and the holidays are approaching fast. Well I better get off this thing and study for mid-terms. 

Glad your back on Devin!!!"

"event","We are just now getting the internet back up today since Katrina hit. Overall---I feel very blessed that my family made it thru okay. We had some minor damage and lot of stress but we are still going strong. I think through all of life's events we learn lessons and in many ways I have learned a lot about life. One of the little lessons I learned is that I am WAY more productive without cable. I am still in school and trying to find a job. I might have one at Winn Dixie---not my first choice but with gas prices the way they are can't afford not to work.  I am kinda dating someone. We are taking it slow and I don't want to make too much out of it but he is definately a SWEETHEART. As for where that goes----I leave in God's hands. Thats about it for now......."

"event","Today started out okay. I got up got dressed ran errands and then registered for classes at the River. I am taking 15 hrs. this semester and then I will be taking 12 more hours there next semester to give me a total of 68 hrs in May. I will then have 4 semesters at USM or another 4 yr. After 2 hrs at PRCC I headed home. I got to go to the eye doctor and FINAL got some contacts. Thank God!!! I can SEE w/o my stupid glasses. Then it started getting bad. My mom informed me that I need to tell my sisters what I was doing b/c I hadn't told ne1 up till a few days ago. So I texted Joy and told her. About three minutes after the text sent she called. We talked for about five seconds. She called my mom and preceed to tell her how mad she was that I didn't finish cosmetology school and that I had nothing to show for all the money and time I have spent. I do take full responsibility for ALL of my mistakes and blame no one but myself. I think the biggest mistake I made was leaving Jones for Hatfields. I have to live with my mistakes and I have to deal with them. She is entitled to her opinion of my mistakes but I don't need them rubbed in my face. I am dealing with them every day. It took me forever to figure out where I went wrong but it all hit me like a ton of bricks about two weeks ago. I don't expect support from anyone I think it has to be earned. Ughhh........Part of me wonders why I it takes me sooo long to figure out what I want to do. I change my mind every six months and I can't afford to change it again. I feel like Ive made the right decisions-----Ive said that before but never really meant it. I just knew that's what people wanted to hear or thats what I was suppose to say. LORD please let it be the real thing this time...........or atleast give me the courage and strength to commit till I am done with school. There are a ton of jobs that I would love to do if I could just get done. Well I think Ive blown off enough steam now."

I am currently in my third school since I have graduated high school.....and needless to say that its not a charm. Yet again I have found something that I DON'T like. I am hoping and praying that I will get this flight attentdant job that I have applied for. If I do then one of my dreams would come true--I would get to move to Newark, NJ which is 25 miles from NEW YORK NEW YORK. I love New York and have always wanted to live there or even better near there (a lot safer). Well that's about all for now....maybe one day I will figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life."

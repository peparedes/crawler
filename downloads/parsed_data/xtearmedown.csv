This is mostly only for myself.  As I stumbled upon my entries from last January and February, I realize that there's no way I'm going to fall out of love with Keith.  I remember everything that's happened between us and I love everything that's happened between us.  Its nearing the end of January.  That's near the beginning of February.  And according to this very journal, that's about the time I just gave up on every guy but Keith and I guess you could say, fell for him.

I don't know why this journal seems different than im_real_xoh but I feel like spilling everything here.  It seems secret.  Maybe there's just no link in my profile.  But in all honesty, its probably still lingering on people's friends lists as people are too lazy to delete non-updaters.

Things with Keith, over about the past year, have been crazy.  There's always been something completely different about him as opposed to other people.  Putting him before Anne.  Was that having confidence to do something I've wanted?  Or was it being selfish and dumping out on my ""best friend"" for a boy?  Or maybe something, something completely unrelated to Keith, made me realize that it'd be best for us all if she and I had next to nothing to do together.  Its so weird now.  We're strangers.  I had a project with her last week, and reading this journal and me calling her a friend then, is really, really weird.

However.  Keith.  I read about the problems I had with other guys.  And how Keith stood there through it all.  Maybe he had some problems of his own with himself.  But now, he doesn't.  And that's crazy and unfathomable to me.  How I'm the one who changed it.  And just... I love how things have been this whole... well... Year.  Even before we spent every second of every day together, he said and did the sweetest things.

I've really hit the jackpot.  Y'all are just after me lucky charms.

That was random.  But I mean... I can't even go on.  Its too crazy."

"event","Today was the worst.  I was so miserable.

Try waiting for some people and them being about 3 hours late to just treat you like shit.  Keith got tattooed for about four fucking hours today.  Then showered.  Then Cool Kid Sean came over and took too long so they got up here late to do something that WE didnt even wanna do.  We did this for KEITH.  Then he's all talking like ""This is lame"" cos y'know, gotta impress Cool Kid Sean.  So we just hung around Smithfield where he made us stay in PacSun for about three hours talking to Summer and Setha.  Maybe not three.  Maybe like one.  Still!  And not to mention when Erin called them cos they were late to see where they were, Keith asked if I was ""getting pissy"" and the way he said it made it sound like that's something I do alot.  Like I'm such a bitch.

So then Keith takes Sean and buys him some Taco Bell.  Y'know, it just wouldn't be right to ask if we wanted anything.  Not like for him to pay.  Just I mean, c'mon, completely ignore us in the backseat?  Rad!  And they do that.  And we go for ice cream and Keith is pretty much on his cell phone *I will fucking kill that thing* and talking to Sean the whole time.  So we meet Josh at Sharon's and its closed.  So I had to get out of that car where Sean keeps asking stupid questions and treating us wicked dick.  Me and the girls went in Josh's car.

We went to Dunkin' Donuts and me and Lena sat on the huge rock and threw pebbles.  Then everyone else came out and we sat and I sat alone and Keith came over and asked what was wrong.  Yeah, cos y'know, Erin WASN'T the one who told him to get his ass over to me and see what was.  So I ignored that and told him nothing.  So we got in the car and listened to the Starting Line and I sang at the top of my lungs and enjoyed about 4 seconds of my day.  Besides when we were singing ""That Thing You Do.""

We went to Josh's and hung out there and it was okay.  I love his house.  Its nice and he has a trampoline and a rope to climb and a pretty pond in the back yard.  And Daisy, his dog, is so cute.  Keith was being really ... whatever ... there, too.  I felt so bad when he said he was alone on a beach for hours after prom.  Now I don't.  That's how he was acting.  Like I wasn't even there.  I had to have Lena with me all the time to keep me occupied from crying.  I was miserable.  Finally he came over and asked me what was wrong.  I told him and he said that every time he came over to talk to me I'd run away.  I said, ""Yeah the only time you did that is now.  What're we doing?""  He said he was sorry when we were leaving to go back to my house.  But I doubt he meant it.  He wrapped me in his sweatshirt but that made me sad.  I felt like he just felt bad for me cos I'm stupid or ugly or boring or whatever I am.

I cried most of the way home and then Josh put on the Starting Line again and I sang along with the girls.  Keith didn't follow us home.  I kind of almost thought he would.  I mean, it might have been a nice thing to do.  And I thought for a second maybe they just went to D&D's but that's wishful thinking.  So Lena and I sat on the dock freezing and I cried some more.  I hate fighting with him.  I also hate when he acts like this.

I should have gone with Josh today when he asked me to go to the quarries.  I might have been happy.  I hadn't seen Keith since Sunday.  And that was only for a while.  And Sunday night I cried for so long, so hard, I was so upset.  And I was getting happy because y'know, what other boyfriend would cry with you and tell you you deserve better, or even the best, of everything and all that happy horseshit.  Then, Dan came over so it was no longer convenient so he got off the phone.  I then cried my ass to sleep, miserable all over.  I didn't see him yesterday.  I see him today, late, and look how he acts.  I'm seriously so miserable.  He's NEVER been like this before.

I'm glad Lena's here I missed her so much."

I also told Keith some things that I know he didn't know before and I don't know if anyone else does either.  And he cried.  And I felt bad.  He told me I deserved everything perfect in the whole world, the best of everything.  I told him I was almost there, because he is perfect and the best of boyfriends.  I cried myself to sleep, slept terrible and had nightmares.

Today I went shopping with Erin and Mom.  I got a cute light pink Dickies skirt, some panties and these WICKED rad earrings.  And all for $28 from Pac Sun.

Then we went to the Orthodontist and it sucked, and then to my other house to get my bank book and then for some iced coffees at Hava.  Then it was back up to the lake to be bored and play camera whore.  Its okay.  Tomorrow will be better.

On the radio we heard good jams.  Ashlee, Michelle, Sublime, a cover of ""Time After Time.""  Totally rocking out.  You know!"

"event","The other night I had a conversation with Keith about the future.  He's the best best friend/boyfriend I could even come close to asking for!

Yesterday rained and thunderstormed all day.  It was so depressing and the thunder shook the house.  My daddy took us out to eat and then Keith came over.  I had to go to church and then I went to Erin's and we watched ""The Butterfly Effect"" and ""Thirteen"" and ate Chinese food and I came home around 11.

I got up this morning at like 7 and it was freezing.  I worked at 8 with Amy, Gina, Dani, and Gina.  It was funny and good and my brother visited me but I had the worst cramps and I wanted to like... die.

Keith picked me up in Woonsocket and brought me up to the lake.  But first I gave him possession of my guitar so he could fix it up and polish it and get the rubber cement off from when the Cadillac emblem thing was on it.  It's kind of yucky looking.  Erin came over to get the coffee I made for her (that she loved) with Josh and we watched some of Thirteen and everything.  We also went up to Keith's car to look at my guitar so I could show him what was wrong and me and Erin Fabreezed his car.  Hahaha.  He left to go to work but I might see him again tonight.

So since I'm retarded and know nothing... Keith's going to teach me to play guitar.  And to ice skate.  And Luke's going to teach me to drive and take me out when (one day) I have my permit.  Niiiiccceeee.  I guess it all came about when Keith said he wouldnt fix my guitar up if I didn't play for him and I told him he had to reteach me everything.  Haha.  Awesome.  

Tonight I might go to Luke's to watch the Red Sox game on the big screen and to hangout before he goes to Canada.  IF my mom stops being gay.  Errrgghhh."

"event","Work gets its own entry.  It was so stressful.  When I got there, there was nothing to do and Dani told me I'd be bored cos there were five of us working.  Gosh she was wrong.  Cat St. G is training now.  And Amanda was showing her how to change the cream in the machine.  But since there was a pinhole in the bag, it exploded when it was put in the machine.  Cream is so gross.  It got all over Amanda, all over the counter, all over the floor and all over the coffee bean bags under the counter.  And it just HAPPENED to occur as the drive thru was getting really busy.  And Cat wasn't used to the drive thru yet, so she couldn't really take orders.  So we're stressing out and running to the other station to put cream in the cups and slipping and spilling and there's customers everywhere and the Java Tap ran out of like Regular or Snickerdoodle or something.  So we were completely stressed out and I think Rocky was, too, when he mopped the cream mess.  And I want to pretend it slowed down, but it didn't really, and we weren't really caught up until about 3:30-4:00.  It was seriously so nuts.  

But Keith visited me.  And he got my flavor coffee.  Cos we're SOULMATES. And it was funny cos Heather and Amanda had been asking me about him.  So he talked to me for a bit and then left so I could help the other girls but I'm glad I got to see him even for like 10 minutes today.  And it was like he was a little kid cos I snuck him behind the counter to show him the Java Tap that Dana's dad made cos he knew about it and stuff.  Anyway.  It was good to see him and I think he's cute and its awesome having a perfect boyfriend.

So I came home and swam the sweat and coffee smell off.  I felt so dirty.  But the girls told me I handled today's situation really well, especially for someone who's training still.  But I'm almost off.  Sweet.  Today was Lena's first day."

Yesterday I went to Keith's.  We watched the Battle Of The Bands tapes from this year and last.  Aww I loved seeing Silent Standard and Keep the Change and 30 Helens Agree.  It was awesome.  Then we just watched a little more T.V. and did whatever.  I saw Tyler!  I love seeing Tyler!  I also stole the sick Red Sox shirt that I always say I'll steal but never do.  But I don't feel bad since he has my red Vans hoodie, my blue Hang Ten hoodie, my pink Rancid shirt and my blue New Found Glory shirt.  I'm wearing it to work today.  And he can't stop me.

We came back up here and as usual, the car ride was fun.  We heard T.L.C. TWICE on the radio!  We ate and hung out and read people's livejournals.  And laughed.  We laughed ever-so-hysterically.

So okay.  People write about the ideal guy.  And how he doesn't exist.  Yet, I got to sit there and read what you all had to say about that and I was WITH the ideal guy.  Also, I make myself laugh.  I was reading some of my own entries from a long time ago today and I seriously just laugh at it all.

Today I'm working at 12 til 4 and I don't know what else after.  Keith's getting the Pulsar back.  Yes!  I wicked miss it.  And Lena."

He brought me to work but we stopped at his house so he could change first and I played with Tyler.  ""Am, come my room!""  He's too freaking cute!  Omigosh I love seeing that little boy!  And I talked to Keith's mommy a little.  She's so cute cos she doesn't want me to live in Burrillville either.


So yesterday I got a few pieces of good news...  First, Keith is getting the Pulsar back.  Yes, I missed that stupid thing!  Its so awesome.  And second.  Sam called me the other night when I was in Providence.  So she called me back yesterday and she asked me if Lena would want to work at Hava with me.  OH MY GOSH!  I'm so freaking out.  Me and Lena... We're like the Dreamteam!  I'm so excited.  So I guess she's gonna start soon and it's gonna be awesome.  I mean.  All the Hava hoes are lovely.  But I'd love to have someone who I like, know... y'know?  And who the hell is better than Lena!?!

And I went to work a little early cos Keith and I were both working at 5.  And it was me, Dani, Amanda and Toni.  There was like nothing to do.  All I could think about was when Keith worked at PacSun and told everyone to ""Have a Pactacular day""... Gabe and Jake visited me.  It was okay but I had to put some really gross cream cheese on Jake's bagel.  Ew!  But I talked to them for a while and stuff.  Then I did my thing and Luke came in.  Aww I love Luke.  Then my daddy came and I came back here and did like nothing.

Yesterday was an awesomely beautifully artsy fun day in Providence.  Keith, Erin and Josh are the best.  I spent so much time laughing and smiling.  And holding hands.

I had an orthodonist appt. in the a.m. and they made me ugly and I have to go back in less than a week.  Then Keith and Erin came over.  Then Josh.  We left here after playing some serious Tetris Attack and Dr. Mario and listening to some serious Further Seems Forever at like 4.  We went over to Thayer so they could check out my brother's store.  Josh got a couple shirts.  We went to a few other stores and walked.  Because RISD kids just walk.  All the time.  And they rest to draw and read.  They're so artsy.  So we were walking and being artsy.  In the Army/Navy store, Keith put on an artsy hat and struck a pose.  

We walked around a wicked lot around Hope Street and all.  We saw a dog, literally, as big as, and the same kind as, the one in the Sandlot.  No joke.  It was huge.  And we played on the playground!  Erin and I were on the swings and the boys on the jungle gym and they saw this little old nun scrounging through the bushes.  She freaked us out, so we all ran to the top of the jungle gym -- where we sat -- and were artsy.  Then we walked our artsy walk some more and it was like 6 or something, so we got back in Josh's car and went to park closer to Waterfire.  We ended up watched cars go over the speedbump near the Statehouse after frolicking near the steps and grass and only one car really flew over.  So we went to the mall.

The mall was funny, too.  ""I wonder what it would be like if someone just went in and DID IT on the beds in a furniture store,"" Erin said.  So we all kept joking that that's what we were gonna do.  We went to Newbury and saw Kelley and then for some food.  Keith looked so hungry and he had no money with him so I bought him a hot dog from Spikes.  Then myself some ice cream.  We also watched the sunset from the windows at the food court.  I know it sounds cheesy but it was so pretty.  And the sun went down so fast.  So we all ate and went down to Waterfire.

It was pretty and they played bad music.  The smoke bothered Keith's nose so we moved up on to the higher steps.  And we talked and something we talked about made me cry and he felt really bad about it and I yelled at him but I didn't mean to.  Somethings just worry me sometimes.  This was one of them.  This same thing kept me up last night.  I couldn't sleep from like 3-5 a.m. and I just cried most of the time.  Those two hours felt like forever.  And Keith had tucked me in like a mermaid and everything so I should have slept great.  Only, I didn't.  --Sigh--

So I'm up now and kind of hungry and I don't feel great because of my sleeping fiasco.  But my day was great.  And P.S. Before we left, we went to this park of where Waterfire would be if it were a full lighting and it looked like the Titanic.  I wanted Josh to yell that he was king of the world but he just danced.  Then we all ran around, toward the car and train station.  After we left, we went to the 7-11.  ""Wanna DO IT in the ice room?""  haha such little kids.  And got juice.  Then we came home at like 11.  Okay I'm gonna go wake up my baby.

"event","Yesterday I worked and it went by fast.  This guy that looks like Johnny Depp in Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas came in.  Nothing eventful really happened.

I went to Keith's after I showered.  We played with Tyler.  He calls me ""Am"" instead of ""Anne"" and it's really, really cute.  ""Am's turn.""  We played with Keith's guitar, and that kid is seriously just too cute.  He's so funny.

After that, I got a fashion show -wink- haha and we layed down and watched ""Buffalo 66.""  That movie's funny.  I liked it.  And Keith showed me a picture of him and Andrea.  He looks so adorable in it.  But when I looked at it, I randomly started crying.  And then I couldn't stop.  Crying is like peeing.  Once you start, you can't stop.  And it was for no reason.  Keith just held me and wiped my tears and kind of cried himself.  I felt so... strange.  Like one of those psycho girls that cut themselves or something.  I'm just glad I had him there with me and he didn't think so.  I love that boy sooo much.

When I finally cheered up, not that I wasn't cheerful before, cos nothing was really wrong, he offered to sing me one of the songs he wrote about me.  Usually I'd have said yes, but I'd have cried again.  He makes me do that because he's so gorgeous and I love his songs.  Silly me, all in love and stuff.

So we sat around listening to old Silent Standard demos and looking through his CDs and making fun of him.  And I stole like 10 of them and 2 DVDs to put on the mp3 player.  Then we left to come back up here and I said bye to Tyler, and ""You da bee-bee"" (Kailey) and his parents.  Hehe his mommy is so funny cos she feels so bad that I have to live in Burrillville.  ""Tell your mom that's silly!""

On the way back to the lake it was rainy and ugly.  But we sang to each other in the car and laughed and told stories.  Why is he definitely my best friend?  He's so amazing.  I made him listen to ""Hey mama"" by the Black Eyed Peas and I think he hated me for a minute.  ""La La La La La""  And he kept asking if I were okay.

We came in the house and my daddy had brought home KFC and Taco Bell.  So we ate and were really happy cos we both love the biscuits.  Then we put his music on my mp3 and watched some Olympics until about 10:30 when I was falling asleep on the couch so he tucked me in to bed and left.  I slept pretty good."

It was funny like the bubble fight in my kitchen yesterday with Erin.  He left about like 3:45 after playing Clue with Luke and I.  Now, Matt, Luke, Logan and my parents are here.  Logan and I are wicked excited about gymnastics tonight.  Did you know she's only a year older than my boyfriend?  Oh my god.  My brother and I are nine years apart!  We showed her some Disney pictures and now we're going to eat soon.  And we're listening to the Red Sox game on the radio.

Tomorrow I'm working.  Obviously and I hope I'm going to Keith's after so we can actually watch Buffalo 66.  And finish it.  And hear it.  Tuesday is in question.  Eric's new band is playing one of those nights and we wanna go.  Ryan and I need to have a movie day or night because he's mad that I haven't seen like...anything.

We got stuff for grilled pizza and then I helped him make it.  Later on, Amy and Pat came up with the hermit crabs -- Mr. Marky and Wade.  They played in the sand.  They're cute--for hermit crabs.  Jon, Kevin and Danielle ended up coming up too.

Then Erin's sister Ariana and her friend Kiana came over to swim.  And then my daddy called Erin's daddy for a beer.  So we had a million people at my house.  Then Erin and Jon came over and back to the Stupidmarket with me in the big maroon school bus and then Keith (""Tokey"") came up after work.  We ate food and had to share a napkin--haha--and then had ice cream sandwiches and went to Erin's to watch Buffalo 66 and eat popcorn.  We didn't finish it.  Keith and I came back around 9 and watched some of the Olympics with my mom and daddy.  Then, I was really tired, so Keith tucked me into bed, kissed me goodnight and he left to go home, or out, or anywhere.

It rained all night.  It's still raining.  If the streets flood, we're taking the kayaks and canoe and blow-up boat out and paddling around.  I wanna make cookies."

We watched it and drank orange juice with Josh and Keith.  I don't know, tonight made me smile.  Maybe because it's Friday and I really am in love.  Maybe beacuse I know that tomorrow morning Keith and I will remember each other.  Maybe because I laughed so hard.  I laughed so hard at everything.

"event","Yesterday was an okay day.  But that doesn't mean I was happy.  In the morning me and Erin were having a conversation online that couldn't be held online so I went over there.  We made food and watched ""That Thing You Do"" until Josh came over.  Then I made muffins and straightened my hair and Keith called me on Erin's phone.  I talked to him and then went home to change and stuff.  I was supposed to go over there, but my mom is wicked gay.  So he just came up here and my dad jacked the TV so we went for a walk.  It started raining and we ended up at Erin's.

Some Glen fag kept calling and harrassing her and saying he was going to come over.  He'd been doing shit like this before, too, and so Keith and I hated him already.  We <b>dared</b> him to come over and every time he said he would, he didn't.  But he did keep calling back until I got on the phone and gave him a hard time.  I said, ""What, you don't have anything better to do with your life than call Erin, who couldn't possibly give LESS of a shit about you, and harrass her?  Does it make you feel big?  What, you don't have a life, so you're saying to yourself, 'lets call Erin and give her shit so I can play tough guy!'""  Yeah, he didn't call back after that.

So Erin, Keith and I just did whatever around the house and talked to Dan and stuff.  We ended up making fried Ramen with eggs and came back here.  Keith and I were both wicked tired so I went to bed.  And he probably went home and didn't go to bed.  -Rolls Eyes-

Today I'm working 12-4 and then Keith's bringing me here and probably hanging out and he might have Jim with him and I love/miss Jim and I'd kind of like to see the kid.  And hopefully today is better than yesterday."

I say I hate it.  I say ""I can't wait to leave,"" ""Maybe next year I'll go somewhere different,"" ""I don't wanna be hear anymore,"" ""I can't wait for summer.""  But in all honesty.  South Main Street in Woonsocket is the only place I want to be.  12 Sleepy Hollow Lane, Pascoag, RI... That isn't home.  It's a house.  A cottage.  The place it's fun to visit on 95 degree days when we get to drive up with the T-Tops down and 5 kids squeezed in the Pulsar.  Not the place I want to lay my head at night.  Those stupid wooden walls that don't even match the other are not what I want to wake up to anymore.  Its backwards here.  Even the zipcode is 02859 and not 02895!  I'm sick of Keith having to pay so much for gas everyday.  I'm sick of not seeing anyone unless I make plans way in advance because they're just too far away.  I'm sick of having to sleep at Lena's if I want to be in the city past 7 at night.  I'm sick of Sam and Bob sleeping together in my bed and me not being able to stop them because I'm not around.  I'm sick of my mom bitching at me to be back from Woonsocket, a half hour drive at such and such a time.  I'm sick of my mom bitching that she has to bring me there for work.

The worst part of all of this is the fact that my mom is so hypocritical.  ""I don't feel like driving that far for you to be there just a few hours and back.""  Yet through the first weeks of September its okay for her to drive back and fourth to work and school every day?  How is she honestly going to justify that?

Its nice seeing Erin everyday.  Don't get me wrong.  I love that girl and I'm still not sick of her.  But I miss other people.  I haven't seen Jim or Anita all summer.  I've seen Gabe like three times.  Josh like twice.  I miss everyone.  I saw Katie B and Craig like once.  I love all those kids to death and back and if I didn't go to school with them, I'd probably be miserable.  So what am I now?  I'm miserable.  Because they aren't here.  I don't even see Lena everyday.  I miss hanging out with her at least 5 days a week.  The only things saving me are Keith and Erin.  And my mom is always so sketchy about Keith.  This is all so g.d. ridiculous.

For now I think I'll just go and click my heels."

"event","Today I went to Erin's.  Keith came over.  I saw some of Anger Management.  When Josh came over, we all watched Full House.  I Love That Show!  Then we took a short trip to I.G.A. in Josh's messy The Starting Line infested car to get cookie dough.  It was awesome.  I love The Starting Line and cookie dough and Keith and Erin and Josh.  Josh also got a lot of juice.

Keith read my livejournal today and he said it makes him happy what I write about him.  Then again today I beat him up accidentally and I teased him ever-so-consistantly.  He jokingly said that Tyler was his son and not nephew, so I got on his back about his past girlfriends and accusing each one of being the real mother.  It got old after a while.  He also attacked me and tickled me like mad on Erin's floor.  Stupidbuttfacehead!  I'll get you back!  I laughed so hard.  Aww he makes me smile.  And yes, the best part was he got me a WICKED cute Oscar The Grouch tee-shirt.  I love it so much.  It even has the cute little wormy on it!  Yey!  But, what're you trying to say?

After we left Erin's and Keith left here, I went to get my hair cut.  Most of the blonde is gradually disappearing and Debbie even French braided my hair for work.  Yey!  It looks cute.  Also, I saw Heather cos she works next door.

Then there was work for two hours.  I talked to Turtle Man and cleaned pretty much.  It was really slow.  And Sam and Amy sat and ate for what seemed to beee... forever.  I ate a coffee cake muffin but NO coffee since it was long after 3:31 P.M. which, if I drink coffee after then, I won't sleep well.  Tomorrow I'm not working.  Friday I am, but I'm not sure what time cos they keep switching me.

Hey.

Matthew William Hunt.  I miss you.  Happy Birthday.

Also.  I miss Jim Berthiaume and Keith gets to see him tomorrow.  Not me.  -Cries-

"event","Yesterday was pretty alright.  I saw alot of doggies.  Jonny came home from Maine.  We walked to see him and then to Danielles with Billy and Ariel and Erin.  We went back to Erin's for a while.  Then here.  Then Erin and Josh came over.  Then Keith and me had Chinese and walked Ginger home cos she ran over here from my cousins.  Last night we had a good talk on the dock in the dark.  But he left kind of in the middle because of my mom going to bed at like 9:30 p.m.  Soo ghetto.

Deb called me into work today.  I'm so glad.  I felt bad because Keith was supposed to come up.  But okay.  The more of a pain in the ass it becomes for my mom to bring me home and back everyday, the greater chance I have of moving home sooner.  And because my mom was being gay about Keith and I today.  I don't like being a child anymore.  But I was very pessimistic this morning but work cheered me up.  As weird as that is.  Gabe and Josey came in.  I haven't seen them in a while.  It was cool.  And I was just in the city and not at Burrillville and busy and not bored.  And I worked yesterday, today, tomorrow and Friday.  And Thursday I think we're going to Midtown cos Keith and I both have the day off and Erin doesn't work.  Yey!

I'm looking on the bright side now."

"event","Yeah but so okay.  After the lastest time I wrote I went to Erin's for a while.  They tried to teach me to play all these card games.  I don't get any of them.  Billy, Josh F and Josh R-K were there.  Sadie ran off, too, but she came back.

The next day, Erin, Keith and I were supposed to go to the hockey game at 11 to see Corey play.  I got up all extra early and then Erin called and said that Keith'd called her the night before, after I left, and the game was moved to 9 a.m.  Pfft that shh.  So Keith and Corey came up after the game and Erin came over.  Corey cracks me up soo hardcore.  And I totally LOVE green-icing-tattoos.  -wink- Yeah, they left to bring Corey to work at five and Corey left his underpants here.. Hahahahaha.

Then Keith came back and we watched Super Troopers with Erin, Ally, and Jeff.  Then they all left and Keith and I made popcorn and watched the X-Games and he gave me a backrub.  Oh my gosh.  It was a party in my back and shoulder area!  Hehe.

He left early and I straightened my hair and went to bed.  I was sooo tired.  And this morning I worked with Amy, Mark, Deb, Sam and Danielle.  Mark made me laugh so hard.  ""She looks like a drowned chiwawa!""  And I left early cos Amy said it wouldn't be busy.

Now I'm here.  Keith's coming up.  I'm soo hyper."

"event","Work yesterday was slow.  Danielle, Heather, me and Sam were there.  There was seriously next to nothing to do.  It was so slow they like ran out of things to show me how to do.

Last night I went with Keith and Lena to the hockey game and we saw Kels, Craig, Craig, Ryan, Jason, and Katie.  And they wanted Keith to play hockey but he didn't have his stuff.  Craig and Ryan and Jason wanted me to go with them to throw snowballs.  Yeah right, its <b>so</b> still summer.

We left early and went to Leviticus so Keith could get his chest tattooed.  I think it looks cute!  I can't wait 'til its colored and the leaves in the back are in.  There was Motorhead and HIM and the Misfits playing and stuff.  It was an alright time.  We were there until like, 10 and then got gas and stopped at Keith's to see his new bathroom and the new stuff in his room and to say hi to his mommy cos she's a sweetheart and then went back to Lena's to eat.  Keith stayed until like 11 and me and Lena went to bed at 11:30 or so.

Last night was hard to sleep cos Lena's room was cold and it was hard sharing a bed with her when I was that cold.  But okay.  I was up at like 8:30-9.  We got ready and called Luke.  We saw Spiderman II and that movie is actually pretty good.  ""She'll be the black widow once he dies!""  We also went to Borders cos Luke needed some book that he couldn't find.  We left the mall and I was hungry so we headed over to Thayer to see my brother at Ragtime.  Matty talked to me about working there.  I think I'd be too lonely.  But he meant more like when I drive but still.  The four of us walked over to Gordito's/the pizza place and got some food.  Then Luke bought me some Krispy Kremes and Jones Soda at Store 24 and we brought Lena home.  Stopped at Lukes to let Merlin out and I'm home.

I'm so tired and I want my stupid boyfriend to have the shading on his half-sleeve finished so I can see him tonight.  I doubt it'll happen.  I think I'll call Erin even though I'm dead tired and Luke's still here.

"event","Yesterday sure was chill enough.  I woke up to rain and the memory of the fact that Keith is home.  I'm so glad he's home.  I'm so glad I got to sleep in the same bed he'd been sleeping in the evening before.  But rain here, still sucks.  So I came online and stuff and talked to Erin.  Then I showered and called Keith and Erin and I went to Erin's and we watched (OMG) cable!  Hah it was funny watching the Fuse channel.  We saw the ""Failure's Not Flattering"" and ""A Decade Under The Influence"" videos and some others that were kinda good.  Then Keith came over and we watched a little more TV and then just married.  Then we straightened my hair and Erin burned Keith's ear.

At like quarter of five Keith dropped us off at my house and I ran in to change my shirt and then me and Erin and my mom went to Applebees and for dessert we got some really yummy chocolate cake stuffs.  Then I got to go shopping!  Yey!  I got numerous new undergarments.  I got new maroon and white sweatpants for gym/work/games/spirit days.  I also got a random green tee-shirt from Target.  Then at PacSun I got four really cute shirts.  A baby blue and white tank top and a baby blue, tan, brown and orange striped shirt that'd match my stupid O'Neill hoodie that nothing else matches.  I also got a 3/4 length light pink shirt and a black and pink Billabong one.  And a new belt that ISN'T pink.  And we helped a brother out cos when my stuff and his stuff was put together it was over $150, so we got a $25 coupon thing and he got two.  Then we went to some other places and I ended up with a 3/4 length green shirt and a brown sheerish long sleeved one with a hood and a boring brown shirt and a boring red one.

I didn't really need to tell you all of that but I did anyway.  Like it.  And I came home and Keith called me and I talked to him.  He was at Leviticus (how do you spell that?) and Marc was getting tattooed and Keith's getting his shaded on Saturday.  I guess that's tomorrow, huh?  And oh yes, we talked about our addiction to the new Taking Back Sunday CD and how I have a copy for the car and for the house cos I can't live without it.  Hey, I Love Him.

I slept terrible last night.  I've been up since 6:20.  Holy Bejesus that's Keith's birthday.  But still too early to be awake.  Today I'm working at eleven until four and showering at Lena's and then Keith is taking us to the hockey game.  At this hockey place I will see Craig, Kels, Katie, maybe Ryan, maybe some others.  I miss these kids!

Then it was kind of getting busy and I checked the dining room and saw Marc walking in... And thought nothing of it until I realized Keith was with him and that they were supposed to be in Cleveland.  It was about 10:30 and Keith's hair was all over and he looked miserable, tired, unshaven and dirty.  I wanted to hold him so bad.  But it got busy and I was taking drive-thru orders and having other people make them which I felt guilty about after a while.  I'm glad they came home early.  I know it's what they wanted.  And I'm glad they did something for themselves.

After work I came back to the lake and called Keith and showered and he came up and we went to Erin's and I was soo happy to hold his hand again and to hug him and to kiss him and lay with him.  I was soo happy.  But he started to cut his hair and it was uneven so now it's short and he's too tired to not be upset cos he hadn't slept in like 34 hours.  I had him lie in my bed, I turned on the fan, gave him my Keitch and closed the doors and shades.  He's been sleeping since 5:45.  I also wrote him a love letter that he can wake up to.  Erin also just left.  I kicked her ass at Tetris Attacks.

Now I'm talking to Dana and Justin and I'm gonna go wake my baby up in a few after I call Lena and go pee."

I'm listening to it now.  Then me and Lena walked home and went in her pool cos it was hot.  We also made pasta, played Dreamcast and Keith called me.  And I fell asleep watching Gleaming The Cube and Lena thinks Christian Slater is hott.  Haha.  Dork!

But, he's not coming home tomorrow the way I did.  He's still got another week and a half.  And they've only played one show so far, which is what gets me the worst.  At 

Today/tonight I'm going to Lena's.  I can't wait to be out of Burrillville just because its boring me out of my head.  I mean, its not like any other place where if all else fails, watch TV cos we don't even have cable.  Kill yourself.

Tomorrow I am working 8-12 and I think Ally and her family, and maybe her boyfriend, are coming up for a while.  I'm also working Wednesday 8-12 and Friday 11-4.  And shopping for Back To School on Thursday night.  I'm glad I'm keeping myself busy.  Its easier to miss Keith when I'm laying around.

I like working with Mark, Amy and Sam the best because they all, especially Mark help me out alot.  So I don't know when I'm going back.  Probably Monday.

Now I'm going to shower and call Lena and find some pants cos I don't have any and watch School Of Rock until Luke comes back and I go back to the lake.  Sound like a plan?

//Edit//
Today was boring but Jasmine and I had a great conversation.  And I met Luke's dad's doggie Ozzy for the first time and he made me think of Keith cos he's skinny with a big head.  Just another one of those things that reminds me of how much I miss him.  Then we rented Gleaming the Cube but I don't have a VCR and its a VHS.  Fuckbitch.  But I had a nice conversation with Keith via telephone.  Well, two.  The first one, he told me that last night the show didn't go so well.  The second one, we laughed and joked.  ""I'm not gay.  I love you and you're a girl.""  ""How do you know?""  ""Anne, let's be honest.""  And we talked about how girls love the Keith O'Rourke.  'Specially this one.

I saw monkeys and elephants and like...everything except for penguins and alligators and otters.  They were all so freaking cute.  I like bunnies and stuff.  Actually, I like mostly every animal I saw.  I hate mice.  We went to KFC/Taco Bell for lunch after.  Oh my gosh we ate so much.  Oh yeah and Luke bought me an iced coffee from the Powder Mill place.  It was okay but it didn't have enough flavor to be French Vanilla.  Lena left at like 7:30, I went for a boatride and showered.

Tomorrow I'm working 8-12.  It'll pass some time but I need to find something to do afterwards.  Where are all those friends I thought I had?  I might chill with Lena again if she isn't doing anything with Riah but honestly she probably is.  Hey, wanna hang out?  Eh, maybe I'll just sleep the day away.  Wow.  So pathetic.  Anne:  Stop talking.  -Stops-

Yeah when I talked to Keith we told each other how much we missed each other and its sad how much reminds us of each other.  He said he'll see signs for prices that are $3.31 and everything.  And yesterday Alyse was at her house making a grilled cheese.  I always make Keith grilled cheese.  And when Keith and I hardly knew each other, he asked me out for coffee and now I work at a coffee place.  Everything just coincides to make me miss him more.  And tonight is his first show on the road.  First one.  Which means there's like 800 more!  Its not even close to over.

So I worked today.  Mark Hundley saw Snoop Dogg and The Used for free tonight.  I'm getting over my fear of the drive-thru.  Gabe and Joey came in.  I saw Russ and Mrs. Maelo.  She told me I have to take her class.  I don't know.  Work was good and only three hours.

I picked up Lena and came home and showered cos I smelled like Hava and then ate.  Then we went to Erin's and saw Alyse's new hair color.  We went for a long walk to IGA and CVS and got cookiedough and fruit2o.  We saw these kids Brandon and Tyler.  And we saw Danielle and she's cool.  She's wicked funny and has A.D.D. worse than me. No, ""O.D.D."" and Erin got a new nickname.

We went for a boatride and then out to dinner and to get some stuff at Dick's with Erin's family.  It was cool.  Me and Lena were gonna come home and swim but I got depressive and she got tied up online and the water was cold.  We sat and talked (and I cried) on the dock for a while until Erin came running to my house and it made me worried.  But she was fine and we resumed.  We went in and I called Gabe cos Erin told me he said to.  We talked to the boys and then I called Keith.  He didn't answer.  We came online.  I fucking hate AIM.  So much drama.  All the fucking time.

But read what Joshy said!

So I cried because Keith is gone and no one knows what its like to have him not here.  I sat near the water and thought about all the times he said it was pretty.  I thought about the waves and how they splashed up on us and got us wet and he had to wear my pants.  I thought about how cold I was and how if he were here he'd warm me.  I thought about how the water was freezing and how he's such a baby about it and always gets goosebumps and gets out right away.  I thought about it all and how I have to wait and I just cried.  It was terrible.

Now there's fucking mice infesting my house and Lena, being the little animal obsessive freak she is is letting one go in my back yard before it gets killed.  Get the fucking thing out of my house and it won't have to be harmed.  But I feel so dirty living here.  I want to go home.

Those green walls.

I called you just to hear your voice.  I miss you."

"event","Last night when my aunts were here, Aunt Lucille told me that someone she knows has kids named Ted and Todd.  I swear I asked her if she was serious and I laughed and no one knew why.  When I told Keith on the phone today, he, Carl and Marc were laughing seriously so hard about it.

I couldn't sleep last night but I finally did and then at quarter of seven my dad woke me up cos he was in the bathroom. It was too cold in my room to fall asleep again so I layed there until about 7:05 which was when I had to get up anyway.  I got dressed and went to Woonsocket for work.  I worked 8-12 and I learned so much.  And Mark is so stupid and called someone a dickhead with a pot leaf and skull tattoo at the drive-thru just loud enough so that the guy probably heard.  So Marky ran to the bathroom and locked himself in.  Wendy and Amy were teasing him saying that the guy wanted to talk to him.  So funny.  So anyway.  Yeah, that was good and easier than I thought it'd be and I'm working tomorrow 8-11 again.  

I came home and I showered and I had just gotten out and Keith called.  He informed me that they had slept in a Little Ceaser's parking lot and the security guard asked them to leave at 6:30 in the morning.  Then they had to search through dumpsters to find Burker King receipts to get free whoppers.  He sounded less upset than the other night, but he still said it wasn't that fun.  Gosh, I wish he were home.  And his first show isn't even for another two days, which I don't understand why they left freaking yesterday morning if that's the truth.  Torture I tell you cos I miss the boy like mad already.

Okay I hope I don't have to go into Hava on Friday and I hope its nice out cos I want to go to the zoo and see Spiderman II. I think I'll go call Lena and/or Erin now.  I miss Lena.

"event","Last night was terrible.  Keith called me all stressed out and got to my house late because of selfish, inconsiderate people.  And then he was just sad the entire time.  Except when I gave him a tattoo out of permanent marker, red pen, black pen, and green icing which he later made me lick off.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v226/SoMarried/Tattoo.jpg"">

See?  Keith left at like 10 and when we were saying goodbye he started crying.  It made me so sad.  I wish he didn't have to go.  Not just cos I'll miss him.  Just cos he's not even going to have any fun cos everyone is just pissing him off.  Luckily he has Marc and Marc's a good kid.  And that the van is Keith's, so if Keith wants to come home, he can and no one can stop him.  But he's just stressed out and doesn't even have like anywhere to sleep.  AND I'm going to miss him.  He called me and woke me up this morning to say goodbye again.  I couldn't sleep after.  I'm not happy about this.

Tomorrow I have to work at 8 and so I might take a nap.  I went out for Lunch today with Erin and that was cool.  We gave $2.37 for a tip and couldn't open the bottle of ketchup.  We almost asked the waitress to do it.  The walk home was so long and we couldn't take the shortcut cos there were people there.  I hate people.

My aunts are coming up later.  Can't wait..=(

"event","Last night Keith and I kind of got in a fight.  More an argument that he ran away from so we couldn't solve it.  But we made up over the phone and were on the phone until 3:31 a.m.  And I love him.  And we talked about everything last night/this morning.  Especially about how no one knows what its like to have what we have and how people can call us stupid and say that we don't know what we're talking about and we're too young to be in love.  But its different than anyone else.  He says I'm the one who turned his life around and saved him and that if it weren't for me, he'd be dead.  No one else could say that.  But anyway, I just love him so much and I can't wait until he's back from tour.  And I'm glad he's leaving tomorrow and not tonight.  But anyway.  I slept about 6 hours so I might need a nap and I didn't do anything today cos we have dial-up and no call waiting and I was waiting for a freaking call.  Eh but now tomorrow I have to wait too.  But Keith's coming over later.

Last night I also had one of those breakdowns where I can't understand why people call me beautiful.  Stopher, Josh, Kayley, I really really like you guys.  Thanks.  
PoOroleStopheR: but just remember dont compare yourself to others you are the cutest in my book and joshes so thats all that matters!!!
PoOroleStopheR: we love you

And today I just talked to Gabe and Mark and they were telling me how hott Lena and Erin are, which I hear all the time.  And they also made me laugh quite hard.  I really really like those kids too."

<center>""Be Our Guest""
Be our guest, be our guest
Put our service to the test
We give horrible directions
But our food is at its best

Taking orders one by one
Thinking Anne is twenty-one
And Felipe is straight out of France
We have a ""Chocolate Dream""
Don't drink mom's wine lest she screams
Be our guest, be our guest, be our guest

Dropping glasses, cutting feet
But our bread cannot be beat
And all the boys finished all their food
Put on a nice clean shirt
Amy's hemeroids hurt
So be our guest, at Carrabba's
We're the best!

"event","Last night I finally saw Spiderman I.  Now I wanna see Spiderman II.  Its so good and reminded me HARDCORE of Batman Returns.  I slept from about 12:30 to 8:30.  Lena and I got up and ate cornbread and my microwave dings.  We went to CVS and bought Keith a surprise in CHANGE.  The lady was mad and said I should have rolled the coins.  Whatever.  It was a really long walk.  Lena bought me plane candy.  (Snickers Pop-A-Bles!  Thank you sweetie.  I looooovvvveeee you..!!)  We took the shortcut back.  Then it was hot and HAPPY BIRTHDAY JUSTIN!  We hung out, ate more, put our feets in the water, came online.  Erin and Stacey stopped by as I was trying on Lena's bathing suit, the cute brown and pink one that I'm stealing for Florida.  Hehehe.  They left and I realized that I had Erin's movies so we walked over and brought them and hung out there for a while.  We were hyper.  Haha.  Fat kids!  Then, Lena and I came back here... and ATE MORE!  P.S.  Keith called me at 3:31.  Whee!  He said he has a surprise for me tonight when he stops by after work.  I'm excited!!  He doesn't get his until next week, when I'm back.  And he has the Saturday I come back off.  WONDERFUL!!  Okay.  I'm going to go.  We're going to Woonsocket soon, and to drop Lena off and I'm going to miss her soooo crazy much.  And Keith.  Hehe...  Then I'm showering, Keith's coming over for a visit to say goodbye and kiss me goodnight and I'm sleeping until 4:30 tomorrow morning cos the limo comes at 5 a.m. and doll...

When I went to Hava, Wendy was happy to know I'd be working and Mark shot me with a water gun and told me since I'd work there, I could do that.  I also got coffee.  I packed at home and did errands with my mom.  Then we picked up Lena, they took us to McDonalds for lunch, where we saw Bruce and what I ate eventually made me sick. We went to Erin's, even though she wasn't home and hung out there and put money in the TourMoneyFund and let her dogs out and came back here and had to go back there for some stuff.  Then Keith came and some how we ended up on a tiny island.  Well, Lena, Keith, Erin and I.  I also ended up alone in the water with no bathing suit bottom.  Haha.  Jonny, Andy and Alyse went wakeboarding.  I went swimming and it was fabulous.  I don't know, so much happened..  Fries this big and Erin and Lena's song.  ""Why would we be sitting and fucking?""  My dad yelling ""SPECIAL!!!!""  Omg, just so much.  Why is everyday I spend with Lena a day that I laugh so hard my tummy hurts?  Honestly.  We might go back to Erin's later.  Who knows!

Lena and I talked to Gabe tonight and we're all going to try to be the way we were, when we all had a good relationship and were really good friends.  Lena and I miss him to pieces and we told him how much he's changed and he realised it... So we will chill again and he'll come visit Anne Marie at work.  I'm so glad we had that talk.  That boy is rad.

On a light, light note.  I promised Ryan a picture of my manicure/pedicure.  Nothing too cute, promise!

"event","Okay I just got back from getting my nails did (and getting a massage by that insane psycho chair --I was into it--).  Rad!  They seriously look so freaking doll.  I got a French manicure on my toes and hands by these cute little Asian girls.  It looks amazing.  Especially when I'm wearing the newly stolen sweatshirt from Keith, that I swear is actually Kenny's.  It's so hott.  I also got pizza with my sister and mom and aunt.  Poor sister.  I hope tonight cheered her up.

Today consisted of breakfast at Erin's courtesy of Jonny and Andy and Chris, Keith coming up, confirming plans with Lena, visits from Ryan and Billy, and claiming Keith was ""too sexy for his shirt"" and taking it off him to put it on me and running away while watching ""I Love 1991.""

Keith told me I was beautiful and pretty and gorgeous and cute so many times today.  He seriously always puts a smile on my face.  He's amazing.  He would honestly just stare at me and all of a sudden say, ""God, Anne, you're gorgeous.""  I love that boy.  And I guess at work, some psycho with a friend named 'Jess' ran up to him and said that her friend though he was SO HOTT and asked if he was single.  PSSH.  Back off, skee-low."

"event","So good.  Yesterday I was torn from my Pop Tarts to make pancakers with Erin for Jonny and Andy.  It was so cold and rainy.  I came here to shower, ate more, and Erin straightened her hair.  Then we ended up walking to the docks to check out the S.S. Redneck.  It was DIRTY!  But we took it out in the pouring rain anyway and got soaking wet.  We're going to clean it up for either $5 or $8.  Whee!  We went to Jonny's for some popcorn and this kid Chris puts sugar on his.  Not even a little.  A TON!  So we hung out there and Jonny has a nice bathroom and Sadie's mommy is SO cute... Too bad Sadie's the devil.

We ended up back at Erin's where we ordered pizza, fries and calamari from two different places.  Olympia was faster.  We watched Blue Crush.  I almost fell asleep on Erin's couch but Keith <33 called me.  I can't believe it's almost 4 months!

Jonny, Andy and Chris went home to eat and I came back here to eat.  They picked me and Erin up in the boat a while later and we went fishing but no one caught anything.  However, I totally love that random litle pontoon raft thing near Party Isle.

I slept amazing.  Woke up, woke Keith up.  He's on his way, so I should probably shower.  P.S.  I talked to Lena yesterday.  I missed her so much.  And P.S.  I'm getting my nails did tonight, and toes too.  And, Lena might be staying here tomorrow.  Maybe Corey?  Coreycakes, we miss you 'round these parts.  Haha, ""Justin says hi.""  ""Tell him I said 'Firetruck'.""  Interesting rainy days, eh?

Apparently someone keeps calling me asking for money.  Supposedly there's something about a guy named Mike.  It's unfortunate I don't know anyone named Mike.  Hmm..  So now people are screening my calls.  Keith said I'm a movie star.

I talked to Keith's daddy and mommy cos I haven't seen them in forever.  After that and after Keith's, we came back and I made him some lunch before work.  Then he left and people were here, so I was kind of bored.  The Whitney's, my aunt Estelle and my brothers were here.  Erin and Danielle stopped by for some cake.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY DANIELLE.  Now I'm super bored but really excited about Florida.

I think Friday I'll go visit Keith at work.  To say goodbye.  Unless he's only working until 10, then I'm making him come over after and say goodbye.  We'll see.

Keith and I went for a long walk and it was just so good.  We picked flowers for each other.  I saw this pretty pretty yellow lily and he picked it for me.  We also almost jumped in the waterfall.  Hehe.  We stopped at Erin's for a bit.  Erin's parents gave Keith a griddle type thing for Jeff and Adrienne.  That was sweet.  Keith and I came back here and played Uno a million times.  Erin came over.  I made Keith some lunch and he went off to work.  Erin and I went to her house and then to the supermarket.  I made fun of the girls working for wearing so much make up.  We came here, played games and made Mac N Cheese til she left and I talked on the phone with Keith.  Now I'm freaking bored.

P.S.  My cousins left today.  

Tomorrow I'm going to Baby's christening with Keith.  Baby (Kailey Grace) is adorable.  But even more adorable, is Tyler.  I miss that little boy.  Whee!!  Plus it's out of the house and into the city with my baby.  When I get back I'm having a family dinner for Matt's birthday and then helping Erin pack for Florida.  ONE week from today.  Limo at 5 A.M. at my Woonsocket house.  Oh my gosh I'm SO excited.  Pedicure/manicure on Wednesday.  That's badass.

What she just said to me set me off so bad because its fucking ridiculous.  ""You're not laying on the couch or on the bed, that's getting old.""  Fine, then you have to sleep on a separate bed from dad at night.  It's been 26 years, that's not old yet?  You're going to fucking Florida with your love so since I can't see mine for three fucking weeks, what you say to me is in one ear and out the other.  I don't fucking care.

"event","I've been stressed and bitchy lately.  Although Keith will not call me a bitch, he did say I seem stressed lately.  I am.

-breaks into tears-

I let things get to me so bad lately... I just randomly cry and I cry over stupid little things.  It just seems like the right thing to do up here.  I hate this place and I hate everyone.  I wicked like Keith but what the fuck... I can't see him as much.  I'm going to go about a month with such a little dose of Keith.

This isn't what summer should be.  I haven't gotten used to not being able to spend money cos of my daddy having no job.  I haven't gotten used to the fact that not every person in the world gets treated like they're 10.  I haven't gotten used to the fact that I can't do this anymore.  Summer should be constant, nonstop fun with people you like/love.  Summer shouldn't be, ""be home at 8:30"" and ""no, you can't do this, this, and this.""  I get so stressed because of my mom and my lonliness and the fact that I think I'm going insane and that scares me more than if I actually went insane.

People I don't usually see that much that've seen me lately must get this impression of me that isn't right at all.  I'm not insane psycho bitch even though I'm going crazy thinking I'm crazy.  I'm not even bitchy really.  I just can't win!

When you realize life can't be perfect, it hurts like hell.  When you realize you're crying and you aren't even PMSing, you know you could be bipolar.  I hate spending so much of my time saying ""Why me?"" 

I hate to sulk and be sad.  I wish I could just always look at the bright side.  I just look in the shadows OF the bright sides.  Like when Keith said, ""I love you and its because you're the reason I'm alive, I can drive and hour to see you everyday and not even be upset about it, I can't even imagine HUGGING another girl and feeling anything, I can't see us breaking up... I just love you so much more than anything else,""  I smile until I realize I don't see him that much lately anymore.

I'm stressed like hell.  I wanna move home... I honestly hope this job keeps me sleeping in Woonsocket, away from my mom.  I honestly love Keith so much.  That's what's in my mind right now as I try to cheer up.

This place is so hard cos you convince yourself everyone at home has forgotten you... you don't matter, you're a half hour away.  My selfish parents aren't helping.  Everything is set so THEY'RE happy, no one else.  My mom blantantly, openly said that I'm with people too much.  Does she not want me to have friends?  Freak!  And she doesn't want me driving to Woonsocket and back, but its okay to when we're going to school cos its what SHE wants.  This lakehouse is supposed to be relaxing and peaceful.  FUCK that.  I've never been so stressed before in my life.

Don't let me go belly up.

On the upside of things, I went to Erin's and Keith and Carl came over.  I cuddled and kissed Keith.  Erin made me laugh so hard I cried and almost peed my pants.  Erin BIT Carl and they cheated on a team at Scrabble so they'd win.  Uhm.  Maybe zoo tomorrow but I wicked want to see Keith.  

I also went to Providence today to take a nice walk on Thayer Street.  Went to Matt's store and played dress up, got him a gift certificate to Gordito Burrito...  Went to some other places and for lunch.  Got iced coffee!!  Woo!!

My eyes hurt.  I don't wanna sleep.  Sleep is scary.

I told my mom Keith and Carl were coming up, just like pretty much any other day and she's like ""Well I don't want them to because there's not a lot of room in the house because it's raining.""  And I'm like ""Mom, we already made plans with them for today though... We all were going to go out to dinner if that's okay.""  Cos Carl owed Erin dinner.  So whatever, I go in my room and Erin's like ""Well, there's room at my house.""  So we talked to them and said we should go there.  Oh yeah and P.S.  My mom is like ""Keith called when y'all were in the water.""  Okay, when was she planning on telling me this?  It was two hours before the fact.  So we all get dressed, in my clothes, and we're like ""Okay, we're going to Erin's, okay? Call you later.""  And she's like ""Okay.  But, uh, when you have nothing to wear, don't complain to me!""  I think she was on drugs.  Whatever.

We're at Erin's, we're hanging out, it's cool.  They come over and we were leaving.  I'm like, ""let me and Lena just run home real quick.""  for dollars and Clue and to talk to Mom.  She flipped out on me.  She's like ""You didn't run this by me!""  I'm like ""Excuse me?  Lena and Erin were right there.""  And we argued more and she's like ""You aren't going to Woonsocket and back, that's too much gas.""  Hello, CARL was driving, not her.  Why is it her concern?!  So I just walk out and go back to Erin's.  And they're like ""Well then, we'll just order out.""  Cos they love me.  And we did.  And we go to pick it up and Erin's mom calls Erin's phone.  ""Have Anne call her mom.""

I call my mom from Erin's phone.  We got in this huge fight and she said I was being ""sneaky"" cos Keith and Carl went to Erin's... Okay am I supposed to tell her everyone that goes to Erin's house?  They're friends with her, too, by this point.  It wasn't my mom's business.  So I told her that.  And she's like yelling at me and told me to be home by 8 by myself.  I told her there was no way I could be in the same house as her and she started yelling so I hung up.  And then started crying.  And the boys came back and didn't even know what to think and all of a sudden I wanted to freaking be alone.

I don't wanna get grounded cos I leave in less than two weeks and then I won't see Keith for like 3 weeks straight.  And I wanna kill myself as it is about that.  So I came in and went straight to my room.  Then called Keith cos he'd bought me cheesecake cos I love it and he made me promise to take it home even if I didn't eat it but I forgot it.  But he brought it to me.  I love him so much.  

The only things that didn't suck were when I was still at Erin's.  We started watching Eurotrip but Keith and I were like ""Screw it,"" and went down to watch The Wizard Of Oz with Ariana, Erin's 8 year old sister.  Keith and I are going to be Dorothy and the Tin Man for Halloween this year.  Hehe.  And when we grow up and get married, we're going to have a dog like Toto.  Hehehe.

I also got a visitor *Erin* at like 9:15 last night.  She brought all my shit back.  

I don't wanna be grounded.  I hate my mom.

Sad cos me and Keith were fighting cos he threw me in the water twice so I punched him and slapped him and he left to go to Dunkin' Donuts.  And Maad Chill cos once we made up, everything was great.  Carl and Erin were totally playing random board games and cards and Snake Eyes for hours.  Lena and Erin BOTH beat Carl at his own game!!  We went to Erins and went on the SlipNSlide and Keith and Carl wore Erin's board shorts.  They were both size 0 and they looked like they actually had ASSES.  Keith's were pink.  I didn't think I'd ever see Carl on a SLIPNSLIDE.  And we watched the fireworks.  Everyone left about 11:30 and Erin and Lena stayed over.  We were up until about 1.  I guess I missed alot during the time Keith and I were making up in my room.  But I just remember alot of Carl and Erin.

Today is rainy.  Already we've been in the water in the pouring rain.  Today we don't know what we're up to... Movies?  Something with Keith and Carl and dinner tonight cos Carl owes Erin for the Battle Of The Bands for slapping someone.  

I'm glad Keith didn't leave when I said, ""Just leave, cos you know that's all you want to do,""  because cuddling with him and eating s'mores and rolling on the beach with him during the fireworks was great.  When he even told me, ""Sometimes I feel like I'm losing you and its my own fault,"" I just started crying because I'd never want to lose that boy.  He's soooo great.  Omigosh.  And I guess some of the things I say to him I don't expect him to take to heart because he's the only boyfriend that actually <b>cares</b> about me and what I think and say.  Anyone else would be like, ""Anne I don't care what you think.""  But he does.  Cos he loves me.  I'm new at this being in love thing.  I've never done it before.

Keith I love you!  Be my baby?

"event","Okay so people write about their problems and stuff in their journal... I don't have any.  My life is so chill.

Yesterday was typical.  Erin, Keith, Erin's house for weiners, boatrides, swimming.  OMG Erin gave me a Jones Soda!  Green Apple!  Sarah came with her family.  Keith left for work.  Erin left for dinner and stole my Clarissa Explains It All teeshirt.  Around 7 or something, I called Lena.

<center><b>OMG LENA IS HOME!!!!!</b></center>

Aww I missed my little midget sooo much!  I still miss her but we talked about everything she missed over the week and she's coming up today with Jasmine and Keith.  I freaking can't even wait.  I love Laney Janey!  Hehe.  We actually talked for a pretty long time until I realized I have no Call-Waiting.  I got off the phone.  Keith called me on break and I talked to him and it was funny cos I could hear the fireworks there and here.  He also asked if I was okay cos I was hyper.  Then Erin, Staci, Alyse, Donna, Ariana and David came over, so there were like 127430918409 people on my dock watching fireworks.  Or like, 14.  Hehe.

Today is gonna be rad.  So much food!  So much LENAAAAA!
Okay I'm done freaking out.  I'm gonna go eat and wait for Sarah to get back and French braid my hair now.

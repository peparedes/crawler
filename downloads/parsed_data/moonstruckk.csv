my day:

thea didnt come early so my heart was broken. 

i had my science practicle and it was easy. maybe it was so easy that i did bad. o well .. its only the regents lol. shippee let us out early so i went to the lunch room with lindsey and we saw maura and sarah there. dude sarah and i are having a party 2morrow w/ thea and katie. sarah said were gunna see the stepford wives ( is that the title??? its sumthing like that)

then i had studio art and holly cried cause shes gunna miss us. awwwwww. i think ill have her for video art next year tho. yayyy. i presented my ugly pot. then we talked and maura signed my yearbook again. maura also wrote this funny thing in jesse's ""yearbook"" (which was actually a sheet of paper). i wrote in jesses yearbook ""hi go die"" its a haiku that expresses my emotions. lol sandra signed my yearbook too. then i left art telling holly i hated her but i was kidding. i hope she knows that...

then i went to lunch and sat with katharine and lindsey cause we were 2 cool to sit at the table next to us with squishy and thea. i asked anthony and justin for money cause i really wanted pizza and they were like fuck off. then this random dude was like heres 2 dollars. i was like wow ur god.

omg the french final was sooo hard. squish and i were like what do these things mean? i was like these 2 words start with the letter a so im gunna match them together... i didnt kno anything. at least i have my stupid buddy squishy. i couldnt sit still ain my seat so i was shaking and asked to get a drink so i could have a seizure in the hall. then katie was like can i come to ur house cause i dunno wanna go home and i was like yah. then thea found out and was like me 2 so they came to my house. thea and i talked on the bus about sarahs ""party"" and about the plans to go to kisco friday night with maura aka fat whale. katies having a party tuesday or thursday or sumthin .. i dont remember. so katie thea and i sat in the basement ate and watched reruns of the fairly odd parents. thea fell asleep with ducki so kaite and i played pool. (i am the champion of pool!) then the doggies puked a lot. eweyyyy.

my mom just left for stew lenerds (crap how do u spell that lenords leneords lenerods lol i suck at life) thank god shes sooooooo annoying. somehow i need to make like 15 bucks 4 tommorow wwhen were going to kisco ( i think) for the movies. and 4 friday night 2. ahhhhhh what 2 do what 2 do. and i still have 2 pay back maura. ahhhh. im a hobo

"event","Hello there. I got bored so yah i made this, even tho im suppose to be studying. o well. today:

i took my math final. it was ok i think i did pretty well. it was raining really hard and i was like ahhhh were gunna die .. not really.

Then i walked off with maura and christie. i first we werent but then we did. it was all wet out. ew and we walked through the ghetto part of cross river lol were the rapist hang. so we went to the cross river plaza thing and we thought we would be the only ones there but it turns out to be like 3 million people there all hangin and smokin (COUGH COUGH) I couldnt decide what 2 eat so we went to dags, the bagel shop, and that weird place. at the weird place christie taught me what a wrap was and i sat on the floor while mean people kicked me. I ended up buying this really yummy lemon thing. Then we went back to school and i ate pizza. maura said the pizza tasted like cardboard and i said it was heaven so the new name is cardboard heaven. then maura took my cow thing and wrote inside jokes on it but that skank hoe katharine (jk) wrote things on it like ""im a slut"" and ""suck a penis"" then i stole rainbow cookies (or what maura calls them- cake 4 squares)from donny. yummmmmmmyyyyy. maura and i walked around the skool a tad bit.

Then we had review in science for the test and like a thousand people left. it was so freakin boring.

then i went home on the bus. i sat with thea and we talked about how we stole the number thing from kisco and maura was like i have still have it. so thea was like lets go friday night and do the same thing. party. so then i sat with kristin because losers in the back were spraying water. but then she left so i sat with maura and we planned an orgy party. 
BelIEgoisteAmour: because IF THERES A FUCKN ORGY GOING ON IN MY BACKYARD>>>SOMEONE ELSE LIVING IN MY HOME IS BOUND 2 REALIZE THERES PEOPLE HAVING SEX IN THE BACK YARD
and thats why it cant be at her house lol.

then i got home and walked the dogs, ate half a pie, and 6 popsicles. yumm. i got grounded laughing at nothing and screaming at nothing.. i was really hyper. shes like u need to go back on the ritalin now. w/e my mom will 4get that she grounded later

im talking to sarah now abou the french final tomorrow ahhhh

ok im really need to go study now cause its already 830

oh crap i still gotta type that lab alex stole from jj ( just to make it clear i didnt steal it he did) grrrrrr

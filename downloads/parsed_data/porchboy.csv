No particular reason aside the fact that I think it's about time that Greg (my friend) got what was coming to him with his band.  He's been putting the time in for years and years, and I really thing he has a chance to ""make it"" with this band, and I want to help him with that as much as I possibly can.

Click this link once per day to vote for Bullet Train to Vegas.

I'm not making any promises as to when I'll be udating in the future, but I can guaran-damn-tee that if i don't get at least 5 comments from 5 different people about how I should update more - i'll never ever update again.

Friends, get on it!  Inspire me!  Tell me how much you miss me!  Stroke my penis.  Er, I mean my ego.

"event","Got a wild hair up my ass and decided to burn 20 CD's tonight, bringing my total to a whopping 123 albums.  I now have 77 albums to go before it's time to buy a bigger CD binder.

It took me about 2 hours to burn, reorganize (because I'm anal about alphabetizing) and list all of my albums.  I think that tomorrow I'll set up an actual database so I don't have to retype this every single time I add albums to my collection.

If I'm missing something that you think I HAVE to get, let me know - I'll get it.

After reading it, I kind of entered into massive thought mode, and started pondering the following...

First, when I say prostitution, I mean consensual sex between an adult jane? and john, not any kind of forced sex, or sex resulting from personal threats, or prostitution by a minor (under 18 years of age)

Why is prostitution in it's purest form illegal?  If a man or woman wants to sell his or her body, how is it civilly acceptable for you or I to tell them that they can't?

Is the risk of spreading STD's more inherent for a prostitute than it is for you or I?  Does sheer number of partners necessarily preclude one's ability to stay STD free?

If someone is prostituting themselves, even as a last resort to pay the bills, does that make it non-consensual sex?  Even under those circumstances, the act of taking money from someone indicates consent to have sex.

How is prostitution different from the porn industry.  Are not both male and female actors paid to have sex on camera?  Is the camera the only aspect that turns being compensated monetarily for sex from prostitution into pornography?

Finally, how is the act of taking someone out to dinner with the hopes of getting laid not prostitution?  If the direct result of the money spent on dinner is the buying party getting laid, I don't see how it differs all that much.

If you've read this far, please comment :)"

"event","So, we called UGG yesterday morning to see what was up w/ our remaining orders, because we had been told they were closed - which generally means shipped.

Well, they hadn't been shipped, they had been canceled.

So we called our rep, pissed, but he had found out before us, and he was even more pissed, cause he KNEW we woudl have taken it out of his hide if they seriously fucked us like that.

So he says he's working on it, and gets us in touch with someone WAY up in the company - the president teh credit manager - they were all involved.

Anyway, they called us up and said give us a list of everything you've presold, and we'll see what we can do.  We gave them a list of 895 pair that we needed.

Three hours later, they called back and said, we have good news, and bad news.

The bad news is, the 4 pair of Classic Short Ruby Boots in size 5 aren't going to be available.

Meaning, we have 891 Pairs of boots coming in, and we're not fucked for the rest of the year.

YAY deckers for fucking up and having to crawl all over themselves to keep us from being fucked."

The plot twist at the end was way too predictable, and the cast did seem to just be hanging out - as opposed to really getting into their characters.  To sum it up - it was basically everything the press said it was going to be.

Also had brunch w/ krystal's dad today too - it's getting easier and easier to hang out w/ him - he's less of an Ogre now that he's remarried and happy w/ his life.  We might go shooting sometime soon.  Yay shooting ranges.

I want to watch disc 3 of 24, but I think it'll have to wait till tomorrow.

On another note, how in the hell is there not a mood setting and icon for ""comfortable""?  That's lame."

I had a lot of fun, but I always do when I head down there, but the best part is that everyone (save Justine and Sally) had a really good time too.  Not that that's surprising, I expected them both to play one game and then be over it.

All in all - it was a good time out w/ friends and some family, and it was great to see Danny again.  There aren't many people I miss from my days at UltraZone - but somehow - even just stopping in to see Danny makes me smile.

"event","Had a decent sized argument w/ Krystal tonight about the way I behave if and when I decide to go out.  Based on past experiences, Krystal often has troubles with me going out, even to the most mundane places w/ whom I believe to be very trustworthy people.  It's not that I've ever given her reason to doubt me, and I havn't, but because of a specific instance when a female friend of mine followed me into the bathroom at a party cause she really had to pee - and I got there first.  Nothing happened - nothing ever would have - but it was taken the wrong way and drama ensued.

Anyway - Krystal has had issues w/ me going out in the past - that often, due to her inability to see that it's totally innocent, and my inability to handle her inability to handle - we often fought about me going out.  This ended up in fighting for an hour before I left, and often fighting for an hour on the phone sometime during the night.  Never a fun situation.  This lead me to do one of three things when the opportunity to go out arose - in order of most common to least common.

1) Not go out to avoid a fight.
2) Go out and handle the fight, which puts a damper on my evening.
3) Go out and not say anything, and hope that it doesn't come out later.

As is quite obvious, none of those situations are ideal, and it's #3 that Krystal took the most issue with, which is completly understandable to me.  I don't ever give her shit about where she's going - but as any reasonable S.O. I like to know where she's going in case of an emergency.  It was very hard for me to extend her that common curtesy however, because I was afraid to deal with the fight beforehand.  Her getting as upset as she does may be a very valid response - but it's not one I understand, and I don't know how to properly relay that, if there is a proper way to relay that I don't understand the way she's feeling - so I just wouldn't say anything.

After about an hour of virtually screaming at each other, and her making me realize that I wasn't giving her a chance, and that she had gotten a lot better about things like that, and I must admit, she has come a very long way - we came to an agreement that hopefully will work out well for both of us.

1) I'm going to tell her where I'm going and what I'm doing - instead of just not going out or keeping her in the dark.
2) She's going to do everything in her power to understand that I'm not doing anything stupid, and to let me go without a fight, because she does trust me.
3) She told me that most times when she gets upset, she realizes later that she overreacted, either to the situation, or to I dealt with her overreacting, which is understandable since I can be a cunt when I don't get my way.  So she told me that if she starts giving me shit about going out because of where or who I'm going with - that I should kiss her goodbye, tell her I love her, and go.

I'm not so sure how #3 is going to work out, but I'm tired of having fights, and I'm tired of not going out for fear of having fights, so I'm willing to give it a shot.  And, if it doesn't work - at least I'm not holding things back from her anymore.

So yeah.  I think this is by far the most personal entry I've posted in my journal.  Hopefully I won't have to keep these to a minimum."

I'm only really into it because of my family - and even then only when I'm there watching with them.  I don't get as hyped up as they do, but I do cheer and cuss on good and bad plays respectivly.

I'm sad that they lost, but glad that I got to spend a good chunk of time w/ my family.

It was also my mothers surprise birthday party - it was my responsibility to get her there on time, and I did a great job of that - she had no idear it was coming.  It was a really good time for her too.  She got lots of presents, including a new Sewing machine - something that surprised her so much and made her so happy - she cried.

I'm glad that the day went the way it did.  Lots of fun was had, lots of my Uncle Bob's barbecue ribs were eaten, and all in all, it was a good time."

"event","There is one major problem with the current setup, and a few rather annoying restrictions that are making moving this shit around extremly hard. I'm hoping that someone will be able to reccomend a setup that works, and save me from tearing the rest of my hair out. I've been playing w/ trying to get this damn room arranged for about 4 hours now, and I just can't do it.

HELP!

Impossible solutions:
1) Get rid of the cats.
2) Take the cabinets down.
3) Seal the garage door.

Problem:
There is a window at the head of the bed (east wall), and the stupid cats play in said window. When stupid cats lose footing, or decide to play chicken, stupid cats fall w/ claws out on our faces. While we sleep.

Additional info about the room:
1) It's hard to see in the image, but on the east wall, there are hanging cabinets that cannot be removed - they start about 4 feet off the floor and continue on to the ceiling. They are above the fridge and both dressers.

2) The two unlabeled tan rectngles on the west wall signify space that is rendered useless due to the garage hinges. Yes, the west wall is a garage door, and it cannot be sealed or made un-openable.

3) In additon to the window on the east wall, there is also a window on the north wall - right smack dab in the middle, and it's as long as the sorter, and half of the couch.

Furniture Restrictions:
1) The bed cannot be below a window, under the cabinets (because she doesn't like buggies, even if there aren't really any buggies) or on the west wall (because it's too cold.)

2) The TV has to be on one of the walls, and preferable (though not currently) viewable if you're on the bed, and if you're on the couches - it's only a 13 inch TV.

3) Neither of the computer desks fit under the shelves on the east wall.

4) She would prefer one side of the bed is against a wall, otherwise she feels like she's going to fall off of it.

The surroundings and people have been different, but one thing in the dreams remains constant:

I have the ability to fly, and to make things hover.  I'm apparently still learning how to do it in dream world, because it doesn't always work exactly like I want it to, and sometimes I have to try a few times to move something.

The first time I had that dream I was in a HUGE warehouse - kind of like a skatepark, and I started trying to move one of those tiny superballs.  AFter I got the basic hang of that, someone taught me how to use my abilities to make myself fly.

Each time that I have the dream, I try moving something bigger, and flying is easier and easier.

I don't know what these dreams mean, but I hope I keep having them because they're really fucking cool."

"event","This whole ""voters wrote in the name but didn't fill in the bubble so their ballot isn't going to be counted"" thing is really starting to bother me.  If someone took the time to go to the polls, or even to fill out their absentee ballot, and then has their vote disqualified based on a technicality - the democratic system that we believe in so strongly has failed.

If I go into a bank, pull a gun and demand that I be given all the money in the safe, and then get away with nothing, I can be charged with attempted robbery because my INTENTION to rob the bank was clear.  Based on that logic, the ballot of someone who goes to the polls and writes in a candidates name should be counted due to the fact that it was their INTENT to vote for the person whos name was written on the ballot.

I don't live in San Diego, so I don't really care who the mayor is.  I do however, believe that the law should be changed to side with the voter instead of the instructions in the case of ""hanging chads"" or write in candadites, as long as the intent of the voter can be determined.  I will be extremly upset if the law does not change based on this election, and I will also be very disappointed w/ Dick Murphy if he doesn't at least come forward and admit that he is NOT the person who the majority of people in San Diego county want to be mayor.

As far as I'm concerned, Dick Murphy lost this election based on the fact that there are 5000 write in ballots for Donna Frye that have not been counted in the official election tally and the fact that he only won by a margin of 2000 votes.  The people of San Diego want Donna Frye, and they should have Donna Frye."

"event","<b>Step 1</b>
Make a post (public, friendslocked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fandom-related (""I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

If you wish for real life things (not fics or icons), make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ, or link to this post (it'll be public) so that the holiday joy will spread.

<b>Step Two</b>
Surf around your friends list (or friendsfriends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list. And now here's the important part:

If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use--or even know where you could get someone's dream purebred Basset Hound for free--do it.

You needn't spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out, it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf--to spread the joy. Gifts can be made anonymously or not--it's your call.

There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Just...wish, and it might come true. Give, and you might receive. And you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special.

<b>My List</b>
1) Lots of pictures of each of my friends
2) Canon EOS300D Digital Rebel
3) Linksys WAP45G Wireless Access Point
4) Linksys WMP54G Wireless PCI Card (Two of them)
5) Maxed out Dell XPS Notebook Computer
6) Books (Eric Nylund, Chuck Palahniuk, John Grisham etc.)
7) Smilecam Webcam
8) Canon I9900 Photo Printer
9) Dell UltraSharp 2001FP 20.1-inch Flat Panel LCD Monitor
10) Mens low rise jeans, light colors - size 38x30 (short and fat ;P)

Do with this list what you wish..."

You should all get it, learn it, and then get in touch w/ me so I can beat your ass Tron style :)

Before you call me a complete nerd, which I am of course, you should try the game out, you'll find it to be incredibly addicting, especially now that the internet multiplayer works.

I thought ""Oh, Disturbed..  I can deal with that.""

So I'm listening to this band and all of a sudden it starts sounding like KoRn.

I listened some more - I can dig a band that sounds like Disturbed and KoRn..

A few seconds later though, I hear something that sounds similar to the the rasta guy that sings w/ Shaggy, but with a hard chunky rock beat.

Disturbed, KoRn, and Shaggy - all rolled into one.  The band was called Skindred, and the song Nobody - If you like Disturbed, KoRn and Shaggy, you should check them out."

As of right now, the date is set at February 5th, a Saturday, and the location is pending.

The game will be Texas Hold'Em.
There will be 10 players.
The buy-in will be $500.
This tournament will be invite only.

After three rounds of tournament play, a single winner will walk away with $4000.

I'm hoping that of the 25 or so invitations I send out, I'll be able to find 10 people willing to take the risk.

I figure that 2 months planning time is more than enough.

Bring on the poker!"

"event","so um lately things have been ok, i've tried to do everything i could to block out what has happened in the last week..ish. i've been doing chores and going to bed making sure that i'm about to pass out from exhaustion before turning off the tv, b/c so far if i go to bed still awake i wind up crying myself to sleep. last night i called nono and asked him if he wanted to go on vacation and my strong nono chief engineer in the navy and very highly respected who used to yell as his normal voice (b/c he was used to be in the engine room) said to me in a weak depressed voice that he didn't know and that he would just be in the way and that he has nothing now b/c the one he loved, even though he loves us all very much, is gone. i continued trying to convince him through tears that he would never get in the way and it would be good for him, he would have fun; i told him he could sleep on it and i would call him again. i was so upset with the way he sounded that i went upstairs to be alone. i was looking around the room hating material possessions when i saw this tape in the corner of my room...unmarked but clearly used, on it, a christmas get together a few years ago that i had to for a project on it was me and my cousins were reading tarot cars and i smiled and off guard nana's voice was on it, along with nono's; honestly i hadn't heard her voice in such a long time  and started to cry b/c i was both hearing it again and realizing that i would only hear it again on tapes. i had never been so happy i did a project in my life before that night.
today my mother calls me telling me that she has good news, i got a car! yay right? wrong, wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong. you know why it's wrong because it's my grandfather's car!!!!why the hell would you tell me that so close to when he died and give me something that relates to his death!??!. i felt bad b/c mom was waiting for an answer of gratitude and all i could say was that i was speechless unknown to her not in the way she intended. i don't want the damn car but it's free and the only way i'll get my own car. i just wish it wasn't his anyone but his. i've also realized that i hate cars and i hate the woman who did this and if i ever met her...you know. i don't know when i'll get it probably not for a while and i'm just fine with that. i guess i'm going to take it b/c i don't want to seem spoiled or ungrateful, i am grateful of getting a car just not that one, you know what i mean? i just hope that by the time i get it it won't smell like him anymore or i won't be able to drive it, cry in it yes, drive in it no. i hate that woman, i truly hate her."

bah! horus just pooped on my shirt while serenading me extremely loudly. well at least on the shirt and not on the floor, i had tried to leave him downstairs but after about an hour or so he freaks out and starts screeching his 'where are you' call. so you go down stairs, he see's you he runs to you and then doesn't let you out of his sight for at least two hours all while fucking up my hair and my shirts. oh well i love him regardless and he's my only company throughout the day. i took him out the other day when the grass was really long and put him down he jumped into the grass and i couldn't find him. he's currently pacing up and down my arm debating on whether he's going to brave the desk and attack my mouse with a red light on it, he's making noises at it and fighting an intense battle with a paper towel it's creeping my out. did you know birds are extremely good at finding lost change? he kept going in the back of the comp whenever he would get his beak on a coin and horded them in the back of the computer in a pile, so if you need to find something shiny he's your man. he's crouched really low and swaying as if he were drunk and then beating the crap out of the mouse.
holy shit this was long i really just gave a play by play of what was happening when really i was just going to come on and say i was bored. and so um... i'm bored...i guess i'll go do chores."

"event","ok my cuz kate said that i could make it for one more month, well you should prob listen to this....
ok so last wed i go to free and to the table my friends are at and this girl secily is sitting there,(this girl ses is the girl who started this whole racism thing and she stopped sitting with us; then ap testing was held in the media center[where she would go]and she came back down to sit with us;no one wants to sit with her and we always move to another table but she follows, anyway...)kelly koler did not want to sit next to her so she's like maddy sit next to me and since she really had no beef with me and she was sitting with US i figure she wouldn't mind and i would just be a bumper if she started something. so i move her stuff over and put my stuff down and go to the bathroom. i get back and ses is sitting there and has this HUGE purse on the bench where i was going to sit, so i move it, and she moves it back. so i tell her that she has to move it so i can sit down. and she's like why did you move my stuff?!?!! and i answer that i always sit there, that's my spot, and she looks around and says that she doesn't see my name on it and i don't have any right to touch her stuff, and if i can move her's,she can move mine,and throws my books in back of us all over the floor. no i've heard the expression tears of rage before but i've never actually experienced them...until that day. i was just standing there shaking while she's mocking me, unable to do or say anything. well the teacher comes and gets me and i'm out. then i hear that my friend b.o. was like what was that for? and starts to follow us (note:b.o. has depressive probs) and ses screams out shut up you psychotic bitch! later we find out that they didn't hear the rest of it and that she actually said shut up you psychotic bitch, go home and cut yourself! so my friends J.T and mike come up and start cursing her(ses) off and she starts cursing back at them....fast forward to today where now me and b.o. and kelly koler got letters on friday saying that ses's mom went to the police and charged us with harassment, so we are being investigated, AND J.T. and mike got letters too but saying that they now are being close to sewed especially J.T., who she is charging him for sexual harassment, saying that he slapped her and said that he would do stuff to her. also today at free she had the balls to try and sit with us again, i mean WTF!?!?! well the parents are pissed and i might be transferring.
yeah kate Mc.D - 1.don't spread this with the folks yet/2. what was that you were saying...only a month???"

"event","i haven't updated this thing in a really long time. i've just had too much to do what with studies and lax and violin concerts, everything has been jumbled up in one big mess. this is not even to mention the physical and mental breakdowns i have had. running around for two hours and then comming home and staying up late to finish homework is talking it's toll. last night i had the violin concert and was scared shitless through the whole thing but then me and tim had a clapping contest, i won XD. i also found this drawing in my italian workbook that looked like my mom so much it was scary and i told tim to look for it the  next day, then i ask him if he did it today and he really surprized me that he actually looked, cuz guys are usually like yeah yeah just to make you happy but he actually looked!so he earned a point.today was especially nice because i was ready for a math test that we had to take and as soon as i get it my mind goes blank. fast forward 43 mins and still nothing is on my paper i'm shaking and feeling like such a piece of shit.fast forward less than 4 mins and i'm walking to free and crying to b.o....i pretty much cried the whole free. i tried to study for the next test i had (i had about five tests today and less than 2 hours of sleep) but wound up staring blankly at the page feeling like a dumb ass. i wound up going to the bathroom, even though it was very teen awkward movie like, and staying there till i calmed down since b.o. had to go finish the rest of the math test. a few periods later i'm in italian hating life cuz i didn't get into the  italian honors society, it wouldn't have bothered me as much if i really missed it,but i just skimmed it.
well that's just the highlights of my shitty month, so much more has happened but i'm just to exhausted to type it, later people."

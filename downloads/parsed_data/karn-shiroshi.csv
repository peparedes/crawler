"event","Shitty EVERYTHING! Hmph..yes, I'm in a shitty mood, too! Tonight has been total, apocolyptic hell for me. So just don't ask. I have problems piling up, my brother is going to die soon, the only one in my family that actually gives a rat's ass about me. I'm just...blah. I'm not even sure if Mikoo still cares about me anymore. Maybe its the bad vibes I'm giving off, but thats just me, the disgusting worm I am..I'm sorry, Mikoo, for everything I've put you through..."

"event","Wow, its been awhile since I updated this. I guess this is a better time than ever to do it, seeing as I don't have to work tonight. Okay, so the reason I haven't been writing is - well..I've had a lot of work on my hands to deal with. I've been sacrificing sleep, for work, and I've just been so out of it. Too out of it to worry about writing here, sadly. Anyway, I'm just glad Mikoo has stayed with me through this all, I know this has really taken away from my alone time I usually have with her, and I'm planning to spend whatever time I have off with her, at least that thought makes me happy. *smiles* Well..I'm gonna go do just that. Bye."

"event","Yep, I was finally pressed to actually create one of these, with the help of Mikoo. *smiles* Thanks, hun. Anyway, this goes against all my morals and I feel so dirty for doing this...but if it makes her happy, I guess I can deal with it. Anyway, I'll get the hang of all this in a few days, I've just been really busy with everything. Well, back to work with me, remember to check back - if you even care to hear my mindless rambling. Ta-ta for now.

I love you Mikoo!"

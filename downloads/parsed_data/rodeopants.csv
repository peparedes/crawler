"event","I want to be like her someday, b/c for me, it's all still a show. I also wonder if I should start a community called ""I_weep""

I weep b/c the blood i spill is empty and suburban, not like your deep hatred. And your unremitting bloody sexuality.

<lj user=""covetous_gashes"">, someday,I will be you. Or at least I hope to be like you. OMG, <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/blood_beauties/53628.html"">Here she is, so hot</a>.

I suck. I'm gonna burn all those polo shirts that my mom bought for me in an apparent fit of INSANITY!"

I hate the fact that I have a sense of humor so that I'm not upset over the fact that the History channel is running Irish programing broken up by documenteries about alcohol.

But if this were February and they were running black history programing and it was broken up by the history of cotton there would be an outrage.</b>

and I felt him and replied:

<lj user=""rodeopants"">
Wow. That is so fucking deep. I mean, you are so maganimous. It's kind of like when black people complain about oppression and don't realize that me, cause I'm 1/4 Swedish, am subject to all those Ingmar Bergman stereotypes. No, I don't make films about isolation and existential angst.

It's totally hard. That and the whole, ""Oh you are Swedish, you must like Saunas"" or ""You are Swedish, you might like Lingonberries"" You know and the only thing people know about Sweden is furniture design and Greta Garbo.

I feel you. Goddamnit, yes I do.

<b>One more furniture comment, <lj user=""sparklerodeo"">, I swear, I'll cut you."

"event","Today, I died a little inside. You see, I was carving this really amazing ankh into my headboard, in preparation for an altar and my mom came into my room and started being, ""You can't keep destroying furniture, honey?"" I got so goddamned mad that I started screaming, ""YOU FUCKING WHORE! YOU DROVE ME TO THIS! YOU ARE A WHORE!"" She is. All she ever did as a child is try to repress me. Putting me into gymnatstics, ballet lessons, all that horrible shit when all I ever wanted to do is explore my vampiric side. Then I stole her wallet. She cried alot, but that's what she deserves. And she almost had the nerve to not give me the 75 bucks she promised to give me for that totally cute shirt at Hot Topic, you know it's all retro, with Bettie Page and it'll rock with my little spider earrings.

Fucking parents. They do nothing but give me shit."

"event","Today, I had so many feelings. I suffer the way that poetic writers of yore suffer. I hate those fuckers at school who always are looking at me with their eyes. I dyed my hair the same color as the head of the debate club, because I wanted to join their scene. But they took me to the shed and beat me again. I have this friend who is obsessed with crotches and she's always messing with my rage. We don't really get along, and she calls me a cocksucker. I hope that when she grows up, she works for minimum wage while I'll be like a GOD with my mad programming skillz. FUCK THE POLICE!"

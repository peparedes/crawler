"event","So after studying like a&nbsp;fool (i.e.&nbsp;basically all day, everyday) for too long now, I finally have arrived on the eve of my exams.&nbsp; Tonight I've realized that I have plunged way to far into the details and have yet to take a firm grasp on the big picture.&nbsp; I look reality in the face(read: three exams in the next two days, if you don't have it by now, you don't have it)&nbsp;and choose a good night's sleep as my plan B.&nbsp; Some say that a good night's sleep will do the learning for you, all you need to do is stuff&nbsp;that information in during the day&nbsp;and the brain-elves organize it overnight.&nbsp; So, I go to bed, &nbsp;trusting that my brain-elves aren't having any union issues this time of year.&nbsp; But woe, to no avail.&nbsp; My efforts be-est in vain.&nbsp; If you're like me, you'll know that stress means that you brain kicks it into high gear.&nbsp; But beware, this is not the please-read-me-another-flash-card kind of high gear.&nbsp; This is the brain working through every unrelated situation, issue, task, idea, decision, past event, hypothetical event, concept...etc that it can possibly find.&nbsp; And everything&nbsp;is questioned, questioned.&nbsp; As soon as I turn of the input (i.e. studying, roommates, work) hoping to wind down, my brain does just the opposite.&nbsp; Spinning, spinning, spinning.&nbsp; So here I am 1:50am on the eve of two exams, trying to focus my racing brain by writing....for the moment we're doing well...."

"event","<p>Hi y'all. <br /><br />Having been so unfaithful to my blog, I really don't know where to start. So many things have happened. <br /><br />Firstly, and most importantly, I gave blood! Ok, you may not see this as the most monumental event BUT, if you had read <a href=""http://heathermobile.livejournal.com/3969.html"">THIS</a> entry you would know that it is no small feat.&nbsp; It was fantastic.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have been there.&nbsp; There I was, uncontaminated by various international diseases, bursting with iron and oh so ready to give my little round red friends away.&nbsp; Once settled into the space age chair and suited up with blood sucking gear, I got to work.&nbsp; I was like spiderman&nbsp;(think about his signature gooey web spray movement..but with more, um..bloodlike results....Psshhh!!).&nbsp; That little judgemental light which so haunted me before had no choice but to stay green.&nbsp; I showed them.&nbsp; A full bag.&nbsp; Ten minutes.&nbsp; *beaming with pride*<br /><br />Compared to that little episode, the rest of life is pretty insignificant.<br /><br />I have another concert tommorow with the choir.&nbsp; This time it's much bigger and classier.&nbsp; We've rented a place and sold tickets.&nbsp; We have two outfits and I have to do it all in high heels (BAWK!).<br /><br />I have my final exams coming up in two weeks.&nbsp; I hope I will be able to manage my time and discipline myself to study and really do my best on these exams.&nbsp; As my fellow students know, all things considered, the end of the semester is really not the best time to have final exams.&nbsp; Who thought up this system anyways?<br /><br />I'm working in a respit care centre for handicapped children.&nbsp; It's very similar to what I did with MCC Supportive Care last year, we give the&nbsp;same kind of care,&nbsp;but with kids, and they just come for a couple days so that their parents can rest.<br /><br />I'm moving in January.&nbsp; I've found an apartment with a friend of a friend.&nbsp; It's really cute and in a nice area.&nbsp; It's right across from a park, right next to the bike path,&nbsp;and a bus ride away from school.&nbsp; My roommate-to-be seems super nice, sociable and passionate.&nbsp; I'm excited to have an place which will be more a home for me, that I can make my own, where I can feel freer to invite people over, and also which can be a restful place for me.<br /><br />I'm starting another job in January, very part time.&nbsp; It's the administrative end of the youth conference slash missions trip that I helped out with last summer.&nbsp; It'll be about a one day a week thing until summer when it'll be two months full time.</p>I'M COMING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS!&nbsp; I'm super-duper excited to come home and see you guys.&nbsp; It's been a year.&nbsp; Excited.&nbsp; I come home on the 14th and will stay until the 28th.&nbsp; Excited.<br /><br />Later"

"event","So friends, I've joined a gospel choir (check them out <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/jirehgospelchoir"">HERE</a>). <br /><br />If I have any of my highschool possy out there reading this, you'll remember a time in my life when I tried to be a little more soulful, and a little darker-of-complexion that my chromosomes have destined me to be. As you may equally remember, it didn't work all that well for me. Admit it. <br /><br />NONETHELESS <br /><br />We are going to give this soul thing another try. We leave the awkward years and leap forward into a new era. This time, I will let my inner groove lead me. HEAR the music, FEEL the music.... BE....the music. <br /><br />In theory, this is all fine and good, in reality: <br /><br />I've been listening to the same fourteen songs, every waking hour for three weeks, hoping to train my 'inner groove'. <br /><br />I've been planning my days to practice, trying to find a moment of the day where I can sing my lungs out without being met with angry roommates with pitchforks. <br /><br />There was a concert planned three weeks after I joined. By week two I was having stage fright dreams where I didn't know my songs right before a concert, and instead of letting me practice someone came to me begging that I help them with some dire emergency (such as finding their lost child or walking a turtle or something). These dreams would always end up with me on stage, horrified, with my mind completely blank and everyone waiting for me to sing. <br /><br />By week three, I had some exams, some projects, I had started to learn a choreographed dance for the concert that was five days after. I was so nervous about getting up on that stage and messing up that suddenly I was worrying about everything including exams and the A- I got on a project (worth 10%, which meant that I would SURELY never accomplish my career goals). I had trouble sleeping because I was worried about not getting enough sleep, and on top of that, the philosophical questions of the universe were consuming me! <br /><br />Then Sunday came. I got on stage, had a fantastic time singing and moving and proclaiming God's faithfulness with a bunch of lovely, fun, encouraging people. I enjoyed every minute of it and got off the stage wanting to do it again. <br /><br />My exams this week are going to be no problem, I'm feeling calm about my career options, I'm sleeping well and apparently the unanswered questions of the universe aren't as scary as I thought. <br /><br />Ridiculous...and anticlimatic.<br /><br />Emotions, BEGONE!&nbsp;<br />"

"event","To my friends fascinated by the human body and especially those who are so brave as to call themselves Nerds....did you know:

-fetuses in the third trimester can distinguish their mother's voice from any other voice.

-they can distinguish their native tongue from all other languages
                                         ............all before they're born!

-if their mother read a poem to them every day in the last six weeks of her pregnancy, once born, the baby can distinguish this poem (even when it's read by another voice) from other poems.

-a baby is born with the capacity to distinguish between and learn to produce ALL of the sounds of ALL of the languages on earth..it is in learning their native tongue that their ears become insensitive to certain sounds not present in their mother tongue.

I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;

"event","So, have you ever tried to carry a desk home from Ikea on public transport?  No?  Well, there's a reason why.  I discovered this today...one of those, gotta-try-it-to-believe-it lessons.

So off I go backpacking to Ikea to get a desk, alone, fully content and obviously overconfident in my muscles.  I spend the afternoon wandering the showrooms and shelves in a bewildered, deer-in-the-headlights, sorry-about-your-foot-m'am kind of way that anyone who has been to Ikea on a Saturday afternoon can understand.  I found a reasonable table, and then did, and I'm not exaggerating, four full laps of the lighting department trying to fix the lighting situation in my bedroom.  Between the zoo of people and, well, the lights blaring at you from everywhere, would someone tell me how you're supposed to decide?  Anyways, the deed got done, I made it through the check out and away from the crowds of people.  Now I had to figure out how I was going to take the bus and two metros carrying all my loot!  Before I looked at the measurements and figured I could just tuck the desk under my arm and, though it might be a bit heavy, be on my way.  Clearly this was not the case.  I tied the table legs to the table top with Ikea brand quality twine.  After a long time I realized that there was no way I was going to carry this beast like a baguette..not a chance.  Making handles with twine would not help the situation.  THEREFORE, I made a backpack.  I quickly found that the twine dug into my shoulders, so I tucked a bath towel that I had purchased under the twine.  This greatly improved the situation.  So there I was, desk tied to my back, towel wrapped around my shoulders, backpack in my arms.  I had to turn sideways to shuffle onto the bus and I had to get the metro guard to let me through the wide gate.  Most people smiled.  Everyone stared.  I really felt like a mutant turtle."

"event","Hi one, hi all.  It's been almost a week since my arrival in Montreal and I finally got this crazy piece of machinery to work and connect me to the world wide web (well, mostly work.  If anyone knows why my computer will make no noise, please tell me...it doesn't make any sound, not even out of the earphone jacks.  and no, it's not on mute, in any way, shape or form)

Okay..so I'm in Montreal.  I have my room mostly civilized, with the only things missing being a desk for my studies and pictures put up on my wall...oh..and I have no bed..but you can't really tell :).  I live on the fourth floor of an old stone church right in downtown.  There are exactly 56 steps from the street to my apartment.  Oh, and did I mention that I have gargoyles on my house?  yeah and a bell tower, they rang the bells the other day.  In my house.  Right across the street from my house is an art museum which I hope to explore a little more in the days to come.  My roommates are really nice.  There are five of us right now, but when everyone gets back from christmas vacation there should be eight people in the apartment.

Up until now I've spent my time catching up with people, putting a bookcase together, spending new years with a local church and then watching fireworks, reading and trying to figure out student cards and other such necessities.  Tomorrow I'll be writing an essay and having an interview as part of my placement for school.  Hopefully I'll get some other things arranged as well, including taking a nice long walk around the school so I don't get lost later.  Oh and PS. for those of you whom I told that I was forced to sign away my electives on Dictionaries 101....I have swiftly given that class the boot as space has opened up in other classes!  so good riddance!

That's the update!  I'll be sending out my phone number and address by email.  If you don't get it and want it, email me.

Lots of love,
Heather"

"event","<p align=""left"">When I was a kid and had friends over, my dad would always put on this goofball, silly-spastic act, and of course, mortally embarrassing me at that young impressionnable age. 

He's reverted. He did it again tonight. Unfortunately though, no outside witnesses, just me and my mummy witnessing the spectacle. 

We had gone to a concert of eclectic semi-improvisation. It was splendid. I have decided once again that I want to be a gospel singer(and possibly VERY large, and of dark complexion so that I can pull it off). In any case, it was a lot of jazz, some folky stuff, some newly written music and a large selection of obscure instruments. And this is where my dad found himself reverting to his former self. 

He used to be quite the music connoisseur, having done his bachelors in music, and teaching it for many years. So he decided to enlighten us on the finer points of bdjublidoomies(i dunno what it's called) which (after hearing his schpeal about them) I have decided are flutes made out of gourd shaped objects. So after listening attentively to some techno-babble about the precise angle which would distinguish bdjubliedoomies from a regular flute, my mother pipes up to say maybe it's cylindrical like a ..well, like a FLUTE. My father was quick to point out that if God wanted flutes to be cylindrical he would have created plants which are shaped like cylinders. 

""What about a cucumber?"" said I. 

""Cucumbers are a result of the Fall"" said he."

This is a sign to encourage safe and slow driving. Think of the children!  

It says ""This could be...YOURS""

So the next time you're not quite sure where your kids are..be sure to check next to the tire-tracked raccoon by the postbox.  Ew.

I must say my dear friends in Quebec, you have spectacularly morbid signs.  Note the blood on the bumper.

It made me smile nonetheless...the kid's missing his shoe, his sock is half dragged off..is that what happens when you get hit in the stomach by a car?  or was it the raccoon who took it?"

It's been two days now since the fluffy white stuff set in.  People now stay stationed in front of their tv screens where they flip between the weather channel and the evening news where commentators will tell them exactly how perilous this change in the weather actually is.  The more daring among us drive at speeds sometimes reaching 15km.  Cars are lying in ditches or stopped mid-lane.  Mothers are rocking absently in corners paralyzed by the fear of driving in this mayhem.  Their children prance around them hoping school will be canceled.

"event","I work with handicapped people.  Most of you only know about what I do when I joke about poo and gross you all out.  Most of the time I don't say a lot about it.  Generally that's because not a lot happens.  But that's the point.  We don't do anything extraordinary together, meaning that these men and women are enjoying living ordinarily whereas they otherwise would not.  Today what I learned is that events that we can consider to be simple can be magnificent and victorious.  

Today I went swimming with Ariel*.  Normally she can't move.  Not in ways she can control in any case.  She neither talks nor seems to have much comprehension of what we say to her.  What she likes to do is watch people.  So she does.  We use a lift to bring her to her recliner or her wheelchair and she watches.  Today she swam.

A coworker and I struggled with a mess of lift slings, bathing suits and water wheelchairs in the handicapped change room and finally wheeled her into the wading pool.  We pushed her around and did exercises with her.  We headed off to the hot tub and she felt the water jets.  And of course, she watched people.  If we could have found her a head supporting life-jacket she also could have let the water carry her around in this crazy whirlpool thing.  What got me was how someone usually so limited by gravity and the physical toll that has on her body can move so much underwater.  Simple, but it made a world of difference to her. 

I have another story, but we'll leave it at that.  Sorry if this has been too cheesy.  But these are my thoughts.


*names have been changed to add a Little Mermaid theme and to protect confidentiality.  That's one work agreement I have the hardest time keeping.  I've probably already broken it to most of you.  I just like telling stories.  This story is probably a breech of confidentiality.  I apologize."

"event","I'm just getting to feel like it's time to write.  I've been searching for a couple days for something goofy, or even just amusing..at the very least thought provoking, but no, it appears my creativity is shot.  The juices have run dry.  I am a withered prune that someone forgot in an artificial tanning bed, and who eats prunes anyway?!  People who are old or people obsessed with fiber and their health.  Neither group should be in tanning beds, the first because they have already figured out what UV rays does to your skin and the second because...it causes cancer!

All to prove the point:  I have nothing of importance to say.

So, that said, I'll just give an update on life.  I'm a nerd.  But most of you knew that already.  So the most life changing things that are going on right now involve school.  Biology is getting more fulfilling.  I now know why people grow six toes.  And what Klinefelter syndrome is -did you know that XX and XY weren't the only options?!

In bigger news, I'm kicking some statistics butt.  Ninja style.  There are definitely binomials and disjoint events who are lying flat on their faces because of my wild nun-chuck action.  They never knew what hit them.

But every martial arts master has their nemesis, someone just a little more zen.  This round kick guru is commonly known as French Literature.  He kindly gives me a humbling foot in the jaw every week.

But the nimble little guy will always come out on top right?  I can dodge the round kick.  I will dodge the round kick.  The round kick will be dodged.  Maybe I can distract him with prunes."

"event","I'm reading ""Reaching for the Invisible God"" by Philip Yancey.  I came across this quote of Augustine and found it gave me a slightly different way to look at my God:

""Man's maker was made man that He, Ruler of the stars, might nurse at His mother's breast; that the Bread might hunger, the Founain thirst, the Light sleep, the Way be tired on its journey; that Truth might be accused of false witnesses, the Teacher be beaten with whips, the Foundation be suspended on wood; that Strength must grow weak; that the Healer might be wounded; that Life might die.""

What a step down from limitless Godhood, and all for us.

To borrow another quote:

""PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER...itty-bitty living space"" -the Genie, Aladdin

It's like He chose to go into the lamp."

"event","So I gave blood today for the first time, an all around alright experience given my less than steller blood work episodes involving multiple nurses trying to find my veins, minutes of digging and much lightheadedness.  And it turns out that I'm not biologically inclined to be a blood doner, but boy am I determined, so where there's a will there's a way.  While waiting I met another first-timer.  She had also had trouble at the blood labs.  Misery loves company, so we quickly made an alliance...and then started to compete.  We were going to race to see who could fill up a unit the fastest.  She got in slightly ahead of me..so she had an advantage, but I wasn't worried.  This kind and dainty oriental nurse set about finding my veins...both my arms in pressure cuffs she put on her thinking face and went about searching.  She eventually found some suitable veins and explained to me that we wanted to take the biggest ones possible.  I then made some comment about how we would have to if I was going to beat this other woman who I was racing.  The nurse laughed and said that there's no way I should hope for that, they're bigger than my other veins, but by no means big.  So even out of the people who have perpetual problems at the blood lab, I have laughably small veins.  Through this whole process I'm watching, with jealousy, my neighbour's bag fill up, my blood will never flow like that...sigh.  By the time the needle actually get's in there, my partner in crime is leaving her bed.  She's done.  One full unit, nine minutes.  The men all around me are dishing them out in four.  What do they think they are?  Niagra falls?  I sure wasn't getting done fast.  

The place gave me this wierd impression that I was a batch of muffins.  They have this timer stuck by your head.  They set it for fifteen minutes.  When the timer beeps, you're done, whether or not you're a nice golden brown.  One of the other nurses decided that I should be a cake, stay in there a little longer..then maybe I'd fill the bag.  There's a little light near the bag holder which only the nurses see (or you if you look at the reflection on the underside of your armholder).  It tells you whether you're going fast enough or not.  Green means you're doing well, slow flashing red means you're ok, fast flashing red means, well, it means you might want to audit and save your GPA.  Guess what I had.  I did get it up to green once, or maybe they just said that to save my self-esteem.  In any case, I did cross the finish line, crawling, dragging my sorry little red blood cells across with me; three-quarters of a unit in just under sixteen minutes.  I'll beat that next time.  Just you try and stop me."

Felicia and I went over to visit Kevin and Kelly, and I spent two-thirds of the time with their precious wide-eyed, full-cheeked, bobble-headed little girl on my lap.  She's a soft and rosy little Michelin baby with a fringe of black fuzz on top sprouting up in crazy crowns.  We played games and cooed and counted little piggies on her toes (it turns out she's ticklish).  She's pushing off and trying to stand, though I say she should try to master the neck control first.  We worked on her first words; well, more specifically I babbled noises and words to her and became almost convinced that she was immitating me.  Then it turned out it was the hiccoughs.  Darling thing.  Oh! What's that?  ""Hello Maternal Instinct, nice of you to stop by.""  I want one.  

Do you think Sears has babies in stock?

Then there was church and people and chili at Chelaine's.  And Aaron Peters playing their baby grand.  One of my top ten places on earth is under a baby grand with my head tucked into the underside between the supports and an expert tickling the ivories.  THAT is experiencing music.  You hear the music loud and rich.  You feel the music through the piano, through the floor, in your whole being.  You almost smell the music.  Bliss.  After my time under the piano we sang and played some jazz and whatnot.  Man, that was good for my soul."

Who thought that it was almost better than a convertable because of the wind-in-the-hair factor?  Me.  And who forgot that they lived in the Lower Mainland and might need to roll up the windows every now and then?  ME.

Glacial rains plus the wind-in-the-hair factor may result in limited vision, hydroplaning, near-death experiences, loss of feeling to the extremeties and a very very wet and cold Heather.  If high fever or nausea remain for more than a week, contact your physician immediately.

My solution?  A saran-wrap suit with strategically placed joints for ease of movement.  I'm still working on the breatheability of the fabric, but no invention is perfect I say.

"event","Hey team!  Big news this week!  I've been accepted to the University of Montreal.  For the majority of you who didn't know I applied, I did that this summer.  I just need to do a french test at the end of September and it's all set.  I will be starting a double major in Linguistics and Psychology in January.  And this is rediculously cool.  You guys have no idea.  The deal is three years in which is included the possibility of up to a year long exchange in Europe.  After finishing my bachelors, I will have a rediculous amount of skills (It's rediculous how rediculously well I express myself with a variety of words..achem..rediculous), such as French (Yes, there are still things I want to learn, for those of you who still haven't figured out why I keep going back, or for that matter decided to learn french at all), learning linguistics in French will allow me the option of teaching back here, or wherever.  It will give me a better understanding of language in general which would be useful in learning others (which I very much want to do).  It will let me learn lots about Psychology and people and find out whether that is truly where I want to continue.  If (as the plan stands right now) I still want to become a youth counsellor, I will be prepared to do a doctorate in Quebec (as they now skip the masters program in Psychology there).  If I realize over the next three years, that that is not the direction I need to go, I can do something more in the linguistics catagory, including Speech Pathology (an option which my mother is subtly pushing me towards).  So in short, I can learn lots and lots and lots in the next three years, and at the end of my bachelors, I won't be at all limited, my options will just be wide open for me.  Sigh...heavenly nectar.  For those of you who read french or try to and care to take a look, this is the program: http://www.etudes.umontreal.ca/index_fiche_prog/118310_desc.html

For this semester I'll be hanging out somewhere between the Wack and Langley BC.  I'm at the Institute full time and working part-time.  I'm fully embracing my new mode of transportation - the bicycle.  I am refusing to put my little honda back on the road, so if you see me slogging through the rain, sleet and hail, over mountains and through puddles across the expansive terrain that is Abbotsford, don't pity me.  Remember that I'm not paying for parking tickets, speeding tickets, no-seatbelt tickets, um broken headlight tickets, sassing off to cops tickets, (like I got any of those before..um not) oh right, and I'm going to be extrememly buff.  There's a positive side to everything."

This means that I get to know all of the campers pretty well and still get a good night's rest, not a bad deal.  Splish-splash (our lifeguard), Kousse-Kousse (Couscous) one of our special events coordinators and I have been dutifully jogging every morning.  It's a time of conversation, seagull watching, life threatening stunts and of course a little exercise.  We're working on our push-ups now -insert imposing muscle flex here-  AND I'm proud to say that I finally managed to go a week without sleeping through my alarm. But unfortunately dispite all that work, the kids still kick my butt at soccer.

This next week should be super restful as there's a church camp renting the grounds and we're not needed as counsellors.  Some of the staff is hanging around to cook, clean, do manual labour and also do some major planning for the teen camp that's happening the following week. (During which I get to have my girls back!  I get to have the oldest group and I'm so excited!  -insert intro music- OOOooohh teenagers!!  You don't like to be SIIlllyyyy!  But I do (dum dumm da da dum) OOOOOhhh teenagers!

Today I'm going to a planning meeting for camp where we'll brainstorm about the ideas for activities during the Art themed weeks where i'll be in charge of theatre.

I got to show her the house and talk to her a bit about my experience.  Then Saturday night i was off swing dancing.  It was super excellent.  I saw a bunch of people that I remembered from my time here before and well..it was super excellent.  Oh, and I got a place to stay for a week, which is a definate answer to prayer.  I went to church on sunday and someone(suspiciously named Heather as well...) asked me where I was staying..and when she heard I didn't have a place to stay for a week..she offered me her room while she housesits somewhere else!  Grand and wonderful.  This week I've been playing with Philippe and Matthieu (I met Philippe swing dancing twoish years ago, Matthieu is his brother, I went to their house for bible study a lot while I was in montreal).  I went to see my kids at the afterschool program, but their program finished just before I arrived here.  Monday I visited my people at hand-in-hand (day program for mentally handicapped adults)  and they all remembered me and were happy to see me.  We bowled...it was super fun; I'm going to see them again today.  Today I'm taking a lovely bus ride with all my junk down to verdun (an area in the south of montreal) where my cousin Andrew and his wife Penny live with their new hatchling Dylan.

I'd just like you all to know that I'm missing you.  We had a song and dance doohicky where the different activity groups showed off their style.  The choir sang a sad song; it was quite lovely but sad and pretty songs make me nostalgic, nostalgia leads to melancholy and melancholy, well that just makes me want to go home and see everyone I love.  So, big hugs and kisses to you at home.  I advise you not to listen to too many painfully beautiful songs(no wonder poets get depressed - or maybe that's a chicken before the egg thing..hmm...).

Anyways, it's my last week out here and we have all sorts of rediculous things to do...for example, I signed myself up to sing a song on this coming friday..on stage... all alone (except for my trusty sidekick Shane-Douglas).  I'm mostly regretting signing up..but then again I'm in Chicoutimi (where I will likely never return) with near-strangers (from all over Canada whom I will likely never see again).  So I'm just going to be brave and if need be, make a fool of myself.

These past two weeks I discovered the hidden society of Chicoutimiite swing dancers.  Oh the joys of discovery!  It was lots of fun.  The group is small but super nice and super welcoming.  Unfortunately for me, they seem to favour jive (which I have never learned) to lindy or bal (oh my great and wonderful bal skills ;) ) we did find a common ground with east coast.  But just so you all know: swing even exists in small town Quebec.

Other than that, I have an exam (I think; my prof isn't too clear) and then I'm outta here.  Montreal here we come."

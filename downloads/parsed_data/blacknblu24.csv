"event","Hmmm...Yesterday I woke up late, took a shower & did some homework. The rest of the day I just laid around because I did not feel well at all. Around six I went to deleware because my family came up from Florida for my couzins birthday. It was surprisingly a lot of fun. Got home really late and crashed on the couch. This morning my parents made me go to my sisters bball game and then we went out for pizza. After that we went to some family party which was a complete waste of my time. Now I'm trying to finish my homework because were watching a family move later.

"event","<P><FONT color=#330099 size=2>Lets see, today was ok. I did not fell well at all, but my mom made me go to school. Slept on the bus because the gay bus driver doesnt believe in the radio. Normal morning, and lunch was so awesome. Tesia and denai did some stupid thing, but it was mad funny, I almost died. English, I cant remeber what we did, I think talked about Shakespeare or something. Goulds class we got a take home test that I know all of three answers to. Wouldn't it be great to have a teacher who actually teaches? lol. Health was unuasally boring w/o foster. The bus ride home was SO funn! Jess &amp; kate drew dots on my chin and I laid so my head was upside down , so all you could see was my chin. It looked liek a little face. It was sooo funny. Then we took suggestive photos &amp; the bus driver was looking back at us the whole time. great times. Now I'n home & I have to babysit. its all good.</FONT></P>

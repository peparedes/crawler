"event","I don't think I can keep living like this. I feel like part of me is missing...he is missing. I promised, i promised I wouldn't start cutting again but I don't know what else to do to deal with this. I can't kill myself. I have to stay for my family, and the crew...but mostly I'm staying for my best friend Bridgette. I love her, and I don't think she would take my death very well. So I have to stick around...or maybe I'm still here cause deep down within my being I still believe there is hope of him coming back to me. If he did come back I don't know what I would do...my friends would be mad at me if I took him back. They keep telling me ""he's an ugly pig nosed lying pillow muncher."" but I don't think that's true...well the lying is he like lied to me about EVERYTHING! Maybe he was just using me from the beginning but I can't stop the feeling that maybe deep down inside he always loved me, and never really stopped loving me. I thought I finally found my ""soul mate"" We had so much in common, and I thought it was true love. Where, and when did I go wrong? What did I do wrong? Was it my fault? Yes! it was my fault...It's always my fault. I do EVERYTHING WRONG! With David I never even kissed him so he left me. With Michael I kissed him too much (so he says) and he stopped loving me. What the FUCK! What do they want from me? Maybe Michael was lying about why he left me (stopped loving me) How do I know what was the truth, and what wasn't? Why can't people just be straight up with honesty. All i want from Michael is the truth, the WHOLE truth! I mean EVERYTHING!! I need to know the truth. I need him. How can I still love him after he treated me like shit, and some kind of whore...I was his girlfriend. He should know better. For someone who says he doesn't want people toying with his heart, he seems to FUCK with a lot of peoples hearts! One day its going to come back and bite him in the ASS! He is such a hypocritical, liar, prick, ass hole, dick licking FAG, but I still love him. Why does it have to hurt so much? The way he used to look at me would make my heart skip a beat, but now it makes me feel like my heart was ripped out and burned. I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't think I can make it another day without...him. Why do I let myself get hurt all the time? Why? Why, can't I live without him?"

"event","ok my day suck first people suck they walk so slow and i was later for a few classes and i forgot my book for social studies and it was the day we needed to use it like my god. my day also sucked because the guy i like is too beautiful. i can't keep my mind off him. i think i might LOVE him but idk hes to perfect and i'm so blah and i'll never have a chance with him ever. so wats the point of even trying? ahhhhhh i hate plans because when u plan stuff ahead of time something happens and people can go anymore and everything falls apart. idk some times life just sucks so bad i want to go missing for a few days. 
well that's it for now. ttfn - abii"

Akron? No. I guess they refuse to plow side streets (Falls had all the side streets I drove on cleared.), since I drove on a few that hadn't seen a plow. Or a snowblower. (That's why people aren't getting stuck on my corner-my dad went out with the snowblower and cleared the street.)

I'm not that good at conversations.
I've gotten better, but still. I suck at conversations, apparently, and I guess I'm not interesting enough to hold one.
Conversations with Whitney, the Kristens, Rick, that lady at the endodontist's office, John, Weaver, the flutes at OBDC, Mike, Alanna, and Mr Dauphin made me a little more optimistic about my conversation skills...ha. Nevermind that.
I can't be that boring, can I?

whee! I escaped the dungeon of Obaa-chan! 
and she's the only one who ever reads this. 
anyways...Rick gets back from North Carolina today, yay. Finally! 
Got to sleep in a little, for once.
My ankle hasn't been retarted yet today, so I'm rejoicing about that. 
Lily's adorable.
My head itches. 
and I really hate it when people say ""then itch it!"" instead of ""then scratch it!"". Someone can itch, but they cannot itch something. However, they can indeed scratch an itch. (Yes, I know, spontaneous topic-I just thought of it and remembered that my third-grade teacher used ""itch it"".)
I'm reading eight books right now.
and I really want pretty much all the Nightwish cds. like...right now. 
Apocalyptica would be nice too. 
well, I have about ten bucks. Record Exchange, anyone?
hmm...maybe...
I want to walk down to Highland Square. I have money to buy phone minutes, so I need to do that soon...but no one else is home besides Al and Lily, so that could be a slight problem.
'Twould be fun though
I'm off to eat breakfast. yum yum."

Alas, Babylon is good though. Nuclear holocaust, set in Florida, people die, there's radiation...it's better after the first three or so chapters. 
Rick tomorrow, that'll cheer me up. 
I've been moody and hungry and not hungry and thirsty for the past few days and my nose is kinda stuffy (i typed noose at first...) and it's just getting so annoying. ugh. I have so much to do in the next week and a half-two weeks, and I have the feeling that I'm going to be pretty stressed next week. Band Ice Cream Social is Monday, AYS audition is Tuesday, string Ice Cream Social is Wednesday, I have two things for science due Friday (one of which I found out about today), a portfolio thing for English due the 23rd, the final draft for our personal narrative due the day before...so much stuff. 
I have The Eighties stuck in my head. Yay for ICS music...it's so much more fun than competition stuff. and we have a blast. one more day of it, then graduation and marching season stuff...I wonder if I'll get to play bassoon for graduation...

Band...states. we performed so well, but one of the judges was on crack or something, so we got a III from that judge. a different rating from each judge...grr. Stupid drugged-up judges. Went home, dropped Ashlynn off, sat in the car and read, came home and practiced for 20 minutes or so, spent the next six and a half hours with Rick...so much fun. (I'm a little worried though, he said (I quote) ""damn it"" then ""I have to leave"" and immediately signed off...no email *sob*)

We needed tater tots or fries, so dad had the two of us run down to ACME to get some...Rick drove. and it was my dad's suggestion. whoa. but anyways, that was fun. (we got tater tots) Food was tasty, and it was so much fun talking to him before we ate and all that jazz. We watched two James Bond movies and walked the dog, and that was one fun walk.

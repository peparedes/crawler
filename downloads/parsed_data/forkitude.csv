"event","So, I was looking at my LJ stats or whatever and I apparently made this livejournal on 6/6/04. And when I looked at the info, the last time I posted was 6/6/06.
I didn't know that. I don't even remember why I made a new journal it doesn't really make sense, but i did. Oy.

I'm such a sucker. Really. I can't study at all I spend way too much time on LJ, actually. I find a new community everyday and it's really unhealthy. Tomorrow I have 80 minutes periods of 2,4,6,&8. Which means regents practice in every single class, and a final in child psychology. Boo!

The regents are in less than a week. I'm screwed!"

"event","Fudge lab in chem. I gave my fudge to Amanda because I didn't feel like eating butter, fluff, evaporated milk, sugar, vanilla, and chocolate. I get sick when i eat now...weird.

Okay so i got my working papers filled out and got the Green card that i have to give to the employer. I came home, and my dad was like ""here this is for you."" So, it was a box! A box that had a cute little camera in it. He said it's a late birthday present. =) My camera broke two days before my birthday. And he sent the old camera out, so when it comes out and gets fixed (which is may or may not) then that will be his camera.

So in about 30 minutes I think i'm going to give my application in. Argh I hope all goes well. I want a job... and my mom said i should apply to Panera bread also, but i have NO clue how i'd get there because it's in Nanuet. And Dan said he could drive me to work, if i get that job, because it's close by.

Wish me luck."

"event","Actually, kidding, I already updated what i thought i didn't.
Yesterday I went to Alyssa's house and we went to walmart...and made tye-dye shirts. So she had work at 6, i went home and put the letters on my shirt and did some other crap that i dont even remember. I'm sooo tired lately and it sucks. 

Hmm, so let me go backwards in time for a bit:
<sub>
One day at lunch, a few boys were talking. ""Yeah, there's a talent show in April. Blah Blah etc etc. We should try out for it!"" So, the boys talked about silly little boy bands. Their first thought was from the TV movie, where the bands name was ""2gether"". So, they started practicing little moves at lunch, hoping to be in the talent show. 

They auditioned in front of the school principal, Mr. Weeks, and some other lady. Ms. Duchin, i believe? So, after their audition, mr. weeks rejected them. ""I'm sorry, but there is no talent here. This is a talent show""

The boys were crushed. Mike decided that he would write a three page letter against mr. weeks, but in a polite way, to prove that they have talent and should be in the show.
So, with a second audition, the boys were allowed in the show.

""Man we really need to practice a lot to show them, it'd suck if we're in it and can't do anything""

The boys practiced on their own time, and in the wrestling room every day. They made extreme progress and impressed their peers, however many of the practices were secretive; they didn't want everyone to know about their moves just yet - it'd be better if it were a surprise.</sub>

Day of the talent show: April 4th.
The boys fucking kicked ass.

I can't even explain it...well, maybe i can. It was a million times better than when they were practicing. 
And you know what else?
FIRST PLACE.
I'm proud :)
The thing i like the most is that they actually really do deserve this. All of the people there were extremely talented - there's no doubt about that. But I remember someone saying that most of the people who participate in these talent shows are singers, dancers, or people who play an instrument. It's tough to choose the best when they're all talented in the same general thing. 
And Mr. Weeks did not expect it at all.

I'm kinda in a bad mood 'cause i couldn't go to sutters because my dad doesn't let me do anything...but oh well. The shirts Alyssa and I made were good, but Drew's girlfriend made ""real"" shirts and they're pretty nice, too :)

<3

And dan came over today and we made more tye-dye shirts, however there was a meatball accident (i dont even like meat!) in the car hahaha and... yeah that's all i'll say, it's kind of embarassing but i had to go back and get sweatpants.
=P"

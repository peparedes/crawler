Im not sure why but i have been pretty bummed about it. It seems like it gets worse if we hang out, abd usually if we are apart for a few days I start feeling better. This time around alot of girls who knew i was dating cherie have agressivly been pursueing me since the break up, and although I am flattered ( it's nice to know you still got it. ) I don't feel like jumping into anymore drama. Still a man has needs. Cherie wants to get back with me, but w/o devuldging the info on the break up, lets just say it's gonna take a whole lot to swing my decision. Still sometimes I root for her, partly b/c everyone else roots aginst her, and partly b/c i want to feel special enough for someone to work for. Lord knows what I have done ( expecially in the past 6 months ) to keeps things good. but I'm not perfect either and I think the combo may be to much. I miss being happy but i know i will be. ""I'll find someone newwwwww, swing swing on the chariot"" you know the song. Anyways until next time peace!"

My g/f stayed over this whole week and is returning home this weekend. It will be nice to have a little space. I currently have an A in English, a C in art, and a C in history, with finals just around the corner. I will need to study real hard to pull those C's up so I can keep my good GPA. Wish me luck!

"event","Another week has passed in a flurry of tests, papers, and mixed up work schedules. But all and all it is better than the alternative. Sometimes in life we take special percautions that inhibit us from progressing in a way that is good for our soul. Being to wary can often times make it easy to over look the good things along the way. Life runs in cycles and more than likly the past will oce again be the present. The question presented to you is this, what will you do with the time you have?"

"event","Hi everyone I hope you are all doing good. As for me, well it's been a weird month. Best way I can describe Feburary is ( depressing ) but this time it's not b/c of a girl, well it is but this one is 4 and She is my daughter. I didn't get to see Gabi all month and I am still not seeing her. And all because I got drunk and yelled at Liz when Gabi was not around.  But I am suposed to talk to her Saturday so hopfully I'll get to see her then. :( Other wise  Girl S and I  ( she doesn't like me to mention her on here ) dated and broke up again. It would seem our relationship has a hard time getting started as when one of us is dedicated the other one only isn't quite able to put out the same. So we have decided to just be friends, which is probally for the best as just earlier this month I almost lost her forever just because of the difficulties in seperating our feelings of friendship and more. She is probally  right when she says i am Jaded when it comes to relationships. But maybe one day I will meet someone who will help turn that around. I no longer work at Waffle House ( the only good thing to come out of Feburary ) And am curently unemployed  ( woohooo i just keep becoming more of a winner by the day ) but truly is's ok i have 600 dollars save a tax return coming and hopfully i will be joining the air force In April. I am still going to look for a job,  but i will let the know my short term intentions. Other wise i am doing well, need a hair cut ( shaggy Dale ) and a car, and a place to live. Screw it, Fuck love, i need a sugar momma lol j/k ( kinda ) Can't belive Liz got married! I hope she is Happy. And I love you guys so until next time.......peace!"

"event","Happy Valentines Day everyone! I hope you day today, was good  and that if you have that cirtin someone they took time out to make you feel special. As for me, well I am single on Valentines Day ... ho huh, and you would think well atleast he'll save money right? Nope :( but on a bright note I did not leave Valentinesday empty handed. For starters there is Jamie, A girl who really .....really.... really.... wants to date me. As for me, well I have no intrest in being with her, even though she is real cool and smart and sweet, sounds good so far right? Well the only real problem I have with her is that she is to premiscuious. As in I see her with a different guy everyday she is all over her customers both male and female, and all at the same time saying  but moses  ( my alias for those who don't know ) I really want to be with you, i know i need life style change and i would stop doing it for you. Well, even if this were true, ( it's not Marvin, a cook also who works with me, and I were comparing notes just to find out if she says alot of the same shit and we found 4 different things that she said to both of us, and Marvin is UGLY!!! Capital U, basicly she throws here self at any guy that pays her 1 second of attention  maybe the fact that i don't is why she wants me so bad. So anyways today for valentines day she gives me  a card, some boxers, a stuffed lion, some candy, fuzzy sex dice, and a balloon. Now this was actually the only thing i got for valentines day until 15 minutes ago when my mom gave me some chocolate. Baring in mind this was atleast 30 dollars worth of gifts to me I had to ask her why she had given it to me, knowing i was not interested in her in a valentines day gift  exchanging way, to which she responded some crap about me being different than most guys and she really wish i would date her. I told her it wasn't happening, and she insisted on and on and on until finally she  invited me to  eat lunch with her saying just give me a chance to prove it to you at lunch and if after that you still don't want to date me I'll back on. Well beween that and the guilt i felt for her spending 30 dollars on me for valentines day so i agreed. Bla bla i keep hoping i can meet a good girl who has respect and confidence  for herself, who is open minded, yet an individal, Who needs me for their weakness and will help me with mine. i guess it's not as easy as it used to seem before i developed the dating 6th sense, or just maybe an over all distrust in people. To say I have built walls would be an understatement!  I have saved enough money to start my achool assestment and treatment, after that my licence is next  ( 300 ) bucks,  for that and probally another 200  to put to fixing the van I have bought to get it driving. Then it is off into my own place. I am going to have to take Liz to court b/c she won't let me see Gabi, bad thing is if i take her to court just trying to get my visitations, my lawyer said I will probally get full cusidy but just in case she catches wing of this journal i am not revealing why. I haven't seen Gabi in a month I really.....really..... really.... miss her.  Anyways just a simple queston for you guys?.......Reply back .....  what are your most memberable  ( good or  bad )  moments on valentines through the years? Hope to hear from you guys I love ya'll!! until next time peace!!!"

Wandering soul,
Even though love is like a dream,
Never does it seem,
To be in grasp,
And if tomorrow found a way to repeat the past,
Would it even last,
Or would there be sorrow,
We always seem to be,
Chasing history, And not tomorrow,
Life, a bed of nails and strive,
Always looking for a light to lead us on,
So I sing a song, A song about today,
A song about a way,
To fill your heart,
I can remember, both bright and dark Decembers,
Loves cast in to the ambers,
 Of the fire,
And I was tired,
Didn't want it anymore,
Didn't need love to adore,
Thought they all were broken whores,
Until today.
I just want to think you kindly,
For taking the time to remind me,
For removing the past that blinded me, ...to love.
For the way you were my friend,
For never trying to pretend,
You weren't who you are,
So I'll name this star ... after you.
The sun can rise again tomorrow,
And the sun's set on the past,
And even though I felt such sorrow,
It's nice to know it didn't last.
Come hold my hand,
We'll walk into today,
Finding our own way,
To make this last,
Free from the past."

Well without reviewing the details, ( as they don't relate to me ) Lets say I have come to the conclusion That I would rather be just a friend to her. Which is half of why I am still up, I've had alot on my mind as it involves what love means, infactuation, lust, or even my new fav, greed. Not that this matters to much to me right now ( bearing the fact I am a bit lonley), so perhaps my eyes are open to the possiblities of a girl friend. But before i get into all that a have quite a few more things on my plate, so with any luck I will soon have a car, Wish me luck! Well until next time ...peace!"

I've decide to go into metal fabracation and tool and dye as a career, I'm enrolling next semester at midlands. I have quit using drugs now for awhile, and I am planing to continue that trend. My brother is in jail for DUI, grand larcany of a truck,  leaving the scene of an accident, open container,  and failure to change his address on his licence. I guess the last charge was just for shit and giggles. His bond is 7,800.00 and belive it or not my parents are actually bailing his out, go figure. I need 400 dollars to get my licence back and atleast 500 for a down payment to get into a car, plus I have christmas, and the on-going saga of child support, rent, and a phone bill. But I think somehow I will manage. I have got one more poem I am going to post and the hell that has been will be over for you guys, This will be a new one and it will be one of mine, after that ........ there will be no more.

And I don't think I wanna,
Ever come back to this,...... World again,
Kinda like it in a coma,
Cause noones ever gonna,
Make me come back to this....... world again,
Now I feels as if I'm floating away,
I can't feel the preasure,
And I like it this way,
but my body is callin my body is callin,
Won't ya come back to this .....world again,
Suspended deep in a sea of black,
I've got a light at the end,
I have my bones on the mast,
Well I've gone sailing, I've gone sailing,
I could leave so easily,,
My friends are all calling back to me,
I said their,
Their leaving it all up to me,
When all I needed was some clarity,
And someone to tell me what the fuck is going on,
Goddamnit!!
Slippin further and further away,
It's a miracle how long we can stay,
In a world our minds created,
It's a world thats full of shit,
Help me,
Help me,
Help me,
Help me,
Bastard,
Pleae understand me,
I'm climbing through the wreckage,
Of all my twisted dreams,
But this cheap investigation,
Just can't striffle all my screams,
And I'm waiting by the cross roads,
Waiting for you,
Waiting for you,
Where are you?
No one's gonna bother me anymore,
No one's gonna mess with my head no more,I can't understand what all the fightinmgs for,
But it's so nice here  down on the shore,
I wish you could see this,
Cause there's nothing to see,
It'sa peacefull here and it's fine by me,
Not like the world where I used to live,
I never really wanted to live,
Ya live your life like it's a coma,
So won't you tell me why we'd wanna,
With all the reasons you give it's,
It's kinda hard to belive,
But who am I to tell you that I see any reason why I should stay,
Maybe you'd be better off with out me anyways,
You gotta one way ticket,
On your last chance ride,
It's a one way ticket to my suicide,
Got a one way ticket and there's no way out alive,
An all this crass communication,
That has you left in the cold,
Isn't much for consalation,
When you feel so weak and old,
An if home is where the heart is,
Then there's stories to be told,
No we don't need a doctor,
No one else can heal our souls,
Got your mind on submission,
Got your lift on the line,
But nobody pulled the trigger,
They just steped aside,
They be down by the water,
While you watch them waving goodbye,
they be callin in the morning,
They be hanging on the phone,
They be waiting for an answer,
But you know nobody's home,
And when the bell stops ringing,
it was nobody's fault but your own,
There were always ample warnings,
There were always subtile signs,
And you wouldn't have seen it coming,
But we gave you to much time,
And when you said no ones listening,
Why'd your best friend drop a dime,
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting,
For a way to spend our time,
An it's so easy to be social,
It's so easy to be cruel,
It's so easy to be heartless when you ant got shit to loose,
And I wish That I could help you,
With what you hope to find,
But I'm just sitting here watching reruns of my life,
When you reach the point of breaking,
Know it's gonna take some time,
To heal the broken memories,
That another man would need,
Just to survive."

When I look into your eyes,
I can see a love restrained,
But darling when I hold you,
Don't you know I feel the same,
Cause nothin' last forever,
And we both know herats can change,
And it's hard to hold a candle in the cold noverber rain,
We've been through this for such a long long time just trying to kill the pain,
But lovers always come and lovers always go,
And no one's really sure who's letting go today,
Walking away,
If we could take the time to lay it on the line,
I could rest my head just knowing that you were mine,
All mine,
So if you want to love me, then darling don't refrain,
Or I'll just end up walking in this cold november rain,
Do you need some time, on your own,
Do you need some time, all alone,
Everybody needs some time, on their own, 
Don't you know you need some time, on your own,
It's heard to keep an open heart,
When even friends seem out to haunt you,
But if you keep a broken heart,
Wouldn't time be out to charm you,
Sometimes I need some time, on your own,
Sometimes I need some time, all alone,
Everybody needs some time, on their own, 
Don't you know you need some time, on your own,
And when your fears subside,
and shadows still remain,
I know that you can love me,
When there's no one left to blame,
So nevermind the darkness,
We still can find away,
Cause nothing last forever, 
Even cold november rain."

It's by our one and only bush bashers..... the Dixie Chicks!



Today's past 18,
He was waiting for a bus in his army greens.
Sat down in a booth,
In cafe there,gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair,
He's a little shy but she give him a smile,
And he said would you mind sitting down for awhile,
And talking to me, I'm feeling a little lone,
She said I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go,
So they went down and they sat on the peir,
He said I bet ya have a boy friend but I don't care,
I got no one to send a letter to,
Would ya mind if I send one back here to you,
""Icried, never gonna hold the hand of another guy,
To young for him they told her,
Waiting for the love of a travling soldier,
Our love will never end,
Waiting for the soldier to come back again,
Never want to be alone, when the letter said,
The soldier's comming home"",
So the letters came from an army camp in california to vietnam,
He told it was hard, it might be love,
And all the things he was scared of,
Said when It's getting rough over here,
I think of the day sitting down by the peir,
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile,
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for awhile,
""Icried, never gonna hold the hand of another guy,
To young for him they told her,
Waiting for the love of a travling soldier,
Our love will never end,
Waiting for the soldier to come back again,
Never want to be alone, when the letter said,
The soldier's comming home"",
One friday night at a football game,
The lords prayer said and the athem sang,
And a man said folks will you bow you head,
For a list of local ..vietnam..dead,
Crying all alone under the satands,
Was a  pickalo player in the marching band,
And one name read nobody really cares,
But a pretty little girl, with a bow in her hair,
""Icried, never gonna hold the hand of another guy,
To young for him they told her,
Waiting for the love of a travling soldier,
Our love will never end,
Waiting for the soldier to come back again,
Never want to be alone, when the letter said,
The soldier's comming home"","

Of playing,
Playing these silly games,
I'm gonna give my heart away,
Give it to another girl to play,
It's been dangerous to long,
From this path,
Unchained,
We're looking at different picture,
In this new frame of mind,
A thousand flowers could bloom,
Move over and give them some room,
And I won't stop, 
Being a man,
Just take a little look,
From outside when you can,
So A little tenderness,
No matter if you cry,
And give me a reason to love love you,
Give me a reason, to feel,
Like I once did,
I just wanna feel like I did,
This is the begining of forever and forever,
It's time to move over,
So it'll always be,
So tired,
Of playing,
Playing this stuipid games,
I'm gonna give my heart away,
Leave for another girl to play,

So open and so free,
It's like being kissed by a thousand angels,

Like all eternity trapped in time,

Her smile reminds me of days gone by,
When I last knew happiness,

Begging to be kissed,

There's no place I'd rather  be than this,

Which kinda of answered my queston of if she liked me or not. I feel something Inside when I'm around her I haven't felt in awhile, I'm just scared to trust it. I don't belive in true love and soul mates anymore, because if those things were real the Ashley and I would have never of broken up, because if there was a soul mate she would be mine, I know this,but like I said thats the words of a hopefull idiot who didn't see the reality of life and the way of women I guess It was my fault for bringing myself in those situations, I just hope if I start feeeking something more it don't end up the same.

I always have fun working with Lindsay, I guess since we have the same birthday we get along real good. We both end up spending  5 dollars in the juke box and almost always pick the same songs lol. Marvin is pretty cool to he just came back to WH  and cooks just as good as me, as a matter of fact he's the reason I get to wait tables now. Tomorrow morning I am going to Tech to register for next semester, I should be getting the Pale grant, lottery tuition, and a student loan.... if needed. I will use most the money to get a car and of course pay for school, that along with a little christmas money I'll be making at the 76 then by jan. I should be well on my way to home ownership, I'm even eyeballing a place out near peak. Anyways Have a great night and wish me happy tipping...peace!!"

Third My family for always being here when I need them, I'm thankfull for life lessons, for the god given abilities I have and most of all for being able to see this thanksgiving 2004. I had a good night last night I cooked 900 by myself, not to shabby, got a 18 dollar bonus  and instead of working third tonight cooking I get to wait tables on second so I am going to stay awake.

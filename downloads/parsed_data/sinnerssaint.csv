"event","I went to church tonight, it was actually really nice, the guy preaching said something I really liked and have probably not applied to my life, he said 'We have to enter God's presence to change not change to enter God's presence', I really liked that, I think for a long time I've been trying to change to make it ok, to make it that I wouldn't have any faults and therefore could be accepted by Him.

I also met this gay guy at church, his name is Craig and he's really sweet, you can tell he is really hurt to some degree, I mean in his past, I really felt for him, I wanted to give him a hug but we had just met so felt it a bit over the top, maybe next time.

Hope everyone had a good weekend."

"event","The other night I watched two of my friends(husband and wife) sit together and hold hands, she gently and soothingly rubbed her thumb up and down his, a act so simple but with such care and love, it really made me want someone."

"event","I went to Bible Study last night, I wanted to tell Michael I was gay but I just don't know if that is true ? I haven't had sex with a guy(or a girl), do I have a sexuality? I don't know if I can trust Michael, he's a nice guy but that's something different. When I left Paul always gives me a hug but last night he really held on, I think he could tell I had some turmoil going on, I really came so close to crying while he was holding me.

I bumped into Simon in town, I haven't seen him in a little while which is good because he is my first major crush. He seemed so happy to see me and we went for a drink, he always has a smile on his face and it makes me so happy to be around him, he is still as beautiful as the day I met him. Dani keeps telling me she thinks he is gay but I don't know, he is just really friendly I think. If he were gay and offered anything sexual I couldn't resist, with anyone else I would think about it and probably talk myself out of it but I have had a crush on him for over 2 years and he is just such a wonderful guy *sigh*"

"event","I guess I'm constantly confused, about my sexuality and my spiritual side and about this worlds judgements and acceptance. I always feel I'm fence sitting, I don't want to embrace this gay side of me but there is always temptation right in front of me because there are so many hot guys. I've never had sex so I couldn't say I wouldn't like it and just dismiss it but I feel if I go with it I'm just going to become this slut going down on as much cock as possible and really don't want that :( 

On the other side is my devotion to Jesus, I want a stronger relationship, stronger bond and I know He doesn't want this homosexuality in my life but it's so tempting and would be so easy, sometimes I just feel I need to try it once but then, I am so confused.

I'm rambling."

"event","Stuart left for Australia for a 6 week holiday today, I'm going to miss him. Stuart is a work friend, he is so hot and me and another co-worker think he may be bisexual, even if he were he wouldn't be interested in me, but he is so cute. 

He is visiting relatives in Perth I think, I got a picture of him from the staff party, maybe I will post it here then you will understand why I am crushing so bad. He has got a girlfriend though, I wouldn't cheat with someone who had a partner. He keeps on showing me his sexy stomach at work."

"event","I suppose I should introduce myself, my name is Peter but most of my friends call me Petey. I'm a nice guy, I tend to be over emotional and can be hurt easily by others words.

I'm gay, I realise this world has become very accepting to people who are homosexual and I think that is a good thing, in any way this world allows more tolerance is beautiful. The point is I don't want to be gay, I don't believe God made me this way and I want to change, I believe it is a choice and I can change it if I just believe in Him and let Him guide me through it. I'm human, sometimes I fall, sometimes I sin, do not judge me because of it, I am human. I'm not saying homosexuality is wrong, I'm just saying it's wrong for me, please whatever you do, do not argue this point, it is how I feel, respect it.

I love Jesus and everything He has done for me, I have been in some very dark places and He has never left or rejected me, that is what makes Him truly amazing because I think He had every right to leave.

I am obviously a devout Christian but it isn't my whole life, I am very open to meeting people of other religions and backgrounds and don't shove the Bible down others throats, I have many non-Christian friends in real life, the Bible teaches me to love them so I do.

I love music, it really relaxes and soothes me. I also love flowers. 

If you want to know anything else don't be afraid to ask, I am an open book."

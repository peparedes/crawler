"event","Have I ever mentioned how much I HATE doing laundry?? Well it's one thing to do it in the privacy of your own home...BUT...when you have to drag it all OUTSIDE to display for everyone....AAARRRGGHH!!  Our stupid dryer isn't working, so I have to wash all the laundry here...then drag it out to the laundromat while it's wet and heavy to dry it.  What a pain!  Luckily, Emeron is happy just going somewhere new so he's a great sport about being dragged back and forth."

"event","Man..it is so hard for me to get my butt moving today.  I have tons of stuff to clean up after yesterday, well, technically, after the whole weekend.  I wasn't home much at all this weekend.  Ok, that's not really a true statement either.  I was home all afternoon yesterday but spent the day entertaining the kids while John layed in bed with a hurt back.  Anyway, I didn't get anything productive done yesterday, so now I have to do it all today.  But I'm not feeling very productive today either. SIGH"

What a liberating experience. For most people their hair is just hair, for me it wasnt about looks it was about individuality, and unforunately my past. About two years ago, i was raped, and awake for the whole dehumanizing experience. And ever after i couldnt get that feeling of his hands in my hair. And now it's all gone, and i feel human again. In nazi germany, when a woman was put into a concentration camp the first thing that happened was the german guards would shave their heads.Unlike i used to believe, they did not do this because of lice, but because it dehumanized them, it supposedly made them all look alike. It's so ironic, in my world shaving my head makes me stand out, makes me different from a majority of people and instead of dehumanizing me, it made me human again. Watching all that hair go to the counter and the floor around me, was almost like watching the pain of the past just fall away. this was liberating because i was free, free to just live in the here and now, and start to heal and forget the past humiliation and degradation of my body, my soul, my heart. And now its like being reborn. everything is new, more intense, and safe without all the flashbacks and memories. it's like the past an finally be really in the past."

"event","Well, it was hopelessly bad. I woke this morning at 7:53 and with only 7 minutes to be on time for registration, i was of course late. my mom was sick and in the bathroom all morning, so my grandfather had to drive me in to the college and complained all the way about how i never do any work, total bs, if i didnt work i would be in college early. got there, sat through boring lecture and intro of staff. they were quite fascinating in their oddities. break, had a smoke met wonderfully synical and sarcastic man. back to boring lecture more intros, more eccentricities. lecture/registration ended tour began, i ditched that and lunch, went for a smoke, talked with the wonderfully cynical and sarcastic man. spent an hour or more in the library, which i fell in love with immediatly without the due intro to it, which i dont think i would have needed anyway spending as i have a chunk of my life in numerous libraries hiding among familiar and unfamiliar writers and histories rather than meeting new people who were still alive and all around me, i'm not ever going to be one of those social butterflies. called my mom, waited an hour in the blistering hot sun, must have got heat stroke cause nearly fainted in car, and then fell into dreamless black sleep in my bed when i got home. the only good things about this day were the library, meeting the wonderfully cynical and sarcastic man who was nervous and shy laughing at everything i said, and running into a good friend of mine, hugging in reunion, but that ended quickly and i had to continue my own path the opposite way. the worst of the whole thing was running into a person from high school who had been a sexually intrusive twit, who forced me and then paid me adding to the humiliation and degradation. but i'm tired so night."

"event","My family started the way many families do. It started with a man and woman in the U.S. who loved each other, married, and had kids 2 girls, and a boy. They moved to the us for thier son to escape drafting. One girl married, and the other took on a husband, one girl had two kids a boy and a girl, the other had my mother and a boy. My grandmothers boy married a rich bitch had three kids and moved far away to Hawii with his three boys. My mother married an asshole unfortunately my father and had two little girls and after having enough of that violent prison she divorced the son of a bitch. Soon after all the boys and men in the family seemed forgotten, even my grandfather grew vague in my memory amongst my great-grandmother, my grandma and her sister, my mother and my sister and me. There was never a time we lacked in psychology lectures, art, or philosophy. Great-grandma was simple, she was the bolts holding the entire family especially the strong, stubborn females of it together, she passed this gift on to my grandma's sister. My grandma's sister was a writer, and teacher, who studied sociology, archeology, of the First Nations of Canada and the U.S. Her daughter is an artist, doing the art for childrens books and selling and exhibiting her own work, her husband is rarely remember although he's nice, i think i cant really remember. My grandma worked in mental health, and i remember after her death, some of her clients would turn up and say how good she was at her job, how they missed her, and were sorry for our loss. My mother worked in that area too, but worked preferably with teenagers working at shelters and so on. We all look alike and have the same toughness about us, as well as the stubborness that gets us into trouble as things have to be done our way or things are done wrong. Hell, before grandma and her sister menopaused they had their periods at the same time, as do my mother, my sister and myself...our household is like having glass all over the floor, fights happen, and so do wounds. What's the differnce between a woman menstrating and a terrorist? You can negotiate with a terrorist."

"event","Traditional religions are an explanation of the mysterious and sometimes awesome events of life. Moses heard his call in the burning bush; Mohammad heard the voice from a cave outside Mecca; Paul was on the road to Damascus when his god spoke to him; Jesus heard the voice by the Jordan River; none of these revealations were based on reason. The voice that comes to all of us from nature is the voice of rationalizing human experience. Religion has been defined as the beliefs, attitudes, emotions, and behavious constituting the powers and principles of the universe. Thus, a religion centered in nature is an interpretation of the powers and principles of the earth. At the same time, that belief acknowledges that it be tempered as science reveals more of the unwritten laws of nature. The difference between the religion of nature, and other traditional religions is that traditional religions are based on the supernatural while the religion of nature needs no diety to augment its position. All movements seek some reference to establish their authority. in Christianity it is the bible and supernaturalism; in capitalism, it is money and assets; in communism it is the state; in socialism it is the group; in nature it is the discoveries of science which seek to find the laws of natureand help people live in harmony with those laws. Today it has been accepted that nature operates under general laws that do not need intervention by a deity. The so-called miracles are simply unuasual events with, in some cases, natural causes which have not been defined by the discovered laws of nature. With the study of nature we find that even our intellegence, our ability to reason, and our emotional responses are dependant on matter, death concludes an existenceand only chemicals return to the earth to live in other forms. Many religous movements today still ask their followers to accept by faith simply because their premise will not stand the test of rationalization. With the modern discoveries in science and technology, our cultural evolution will continue to grow toward that utopia envisioned by the dreamers through the ages. 
Religion has always been associated with the moral tone of any civilization. Religion has been the motivating factor in the ethical conduct of culture,but when the religous tradition breaksdown so does the moral behavior. Moral degradation as well as social decomposition takes place. Some have said today we are living in North America in a sick soceity. Rioting, violent demonstrations, and murder have characterized the last 50 years. When a nation was a war, such as the Vietnam debacle, in which many cant see a moral purpose, then the individual reacts with immoral acts to achieve what they term moral purposes of their own. Morality is related to acceptable behaviour of the individual and the group. Traditional religion has depended on the bible and pronouncements of the church fathers to determine whether a given type of behaviour was good or bad. the decrees of the church were accepted by governments so that laws could be enacted that would make immoral behaviour punishable by law. Rape, murder, drunk driving, dope trafficking, embezzlement, and many other behaviours are punishable by law. the trouble with this approach is that the existence of these laws will not ensure that crimes will be done away with. locking a man up in prison does not gaurantee that he will be a change man for the better. with the breakdown of religous bodies has come breakdown in morality. there was a time when the fear of god did undoubtably influence human behaviour. many followed the straight and narrow path simply because of fear of the consequences. 
With a religion of nature, where man accepts that he is a part of nature, the incentive to be moral becomes a partof his being. we must take a positive approach so that man acts not because of fear of punishment by god or government, but rather because as a part of nature, and injustice done his fellow man, or a society of which he is a part, is an injustice to himself. Example: A manufacturer allows his smoke stacks to fill the atmosphere with chemicals that produce acid rain. He becomes a party to damaging land that is needed to produce food, to poisoning the fish in the lakes and the rivers. That emission from the factory damages the very environment of which he is a part of. That action is immoral. the technological introductions in our period of time have brought about the liberation of nuclear energy. At the onset, man was told this would better mankind; the power and lights would be available to all at less cost than existing practices before that. But that is not the case, instead, nuclear energy has been developed for purposes of killing off the human race and destroying nature itself. One who embraces a religion of nature must discover that the two mentioned practices are immoral and if governments are to assume responsibility for protecting their citizens, than laws must be enacted to regulate such immoral practices. 
There is a whole group of actions that have always been seen as immoral because they have to do with bringing harm to another individual. Among them are rape, theivary, embezzlement, killing, injuring others, drunken driving, and many others fall in the same behaviour pattern. with the religion of nature, such behavior that impairs or injures another member of society must be dealt with as immoral since injury to any member of the group is an insult to the conception of man as kin to every other human being. We must come to see that is immoral may impair not only the individual but the society of which he is a part. 
The task of transmitting the rules of society that pertain to moral behaviour have largely been left to the church or other religous institutions. However, with the church struggling simply to exist, this whole field should be turned over to education. Education should address moral issues so that students can make rational choices."

"event","I do not mean to offend anyone of you who are readind this, whether you are religous or not, this blog is just my observation of a truth about religion's partnership with supernaturalism rather than science. If you want to rebuke this, show me some sort of proof, making this my truth about the organized religion false. 

Throughout my life, I have asked  many times, ""Why and by what authority is this truth?"" The teachers who I asked this, often enough answered, ""This is so because I said so."" My mother and her mother usually gave the same answer. I once went to church, the experience there got me started in questioning the validity of either the bible or supernaturalism in providing the truth. Supernaturalism lies outside the bounds of science, there is no way to experiment within it. It is the belief in a doctrine that a divine power guides and directs the natural order. They are the same events that are beyond the forces of nature. One has to accept that a supernatural power, outside of man, is imposed on man by the Deity; acceptance of the revalation is dependant on blind faith. Christendom as well as Judaism depends on a revelation to one of its patriarchs for its moral code. Moses stood before a burning bush and God came to him with the 10 commandments. Historians now have revealed that the Code of Hamaradi had the same Ten Commandments written some 400 years before the time of Moses. There were more than ten commandments in that code, but Moses must have choose to delete some, probably to keep the attention of potential followers. 

Zorasterism: West Iran, 6 B.C. founded by Zoraster-he had sat on the banks of a river and saw a radiant light that conducted him into the presence of god. 

Shintoism: Ancient and flourishing in Japan still, Japanese rulers claimed a special relationship with a great divine power in the sky, claiming direct contact with the gods through male and female shamans who danced themselves into ecstatic states wherein they become mouthpieces of God. 

Islam: Is the religion of all Arab states with 600 million followers. God is called Allah, Mohammed was born about 570 AD in Mecca, at 40 years he had a vision, he saw a being who had text written on silk, this being comanded Mohammed to write and the result was the Sura 96 of the Qur'an. 

Buddhism: Founder Gjautoma who was supposed to be born of a virgin in the year 536 B.C. At age 35 while sitting under a Bodhi tree he meditated for many days, acclaiming finally to have achieved nirvana, which is a state of mind where the outer world ceases to influence the mind and one attains freedom and tranquility. Buddhism is a religion not based on supernaturalism, but has many legends and stories with supernatural connotation. 

Mormonism: 1920, Joseph Smith claimed to have a vision while praying in seclusion, he was approached by God, the father and god the son, and was ordered to cleanse the churches of which he was critical. He claimed he had supernatural powers, and to validate he claimed to have recieved from god the golden plates upon which the Book of Mormon is written. 

If I were to now tell you that i spent a lifetime seeking truth, and i went up a mountain and sat by a babbling brook for a week where god revealed itself to me, presented me with truth, and told me to return to my people and explain to them what god wanted all of us to do, i doubt if any of you reading this with me would, listen much longer.You would say i was a fake or if you were kind, say i was mentally disturbed. Yet the same people who would say this welcome, with open arms, the religion of their choosing which ten to one is based on the same kind of suparnaturalism as what i've discribed. 

There is an old fable that I'd like to use to close this discourse: It was a long time ago when man was still walking on all fours. A certain tribe had one person who stood erect, and was the leader and commander of the tribe. Anyone who dared to look up was beaten on the head by the leader. Someone had told them that a land of milk and honey lay across the mountain ridge. They all trudged along and suddenly the leader spotted a lush green valley with trees laden with fruit and fish jumping from the mountain brooks. He remonstrated with the followers that they must not look up or else the gods would destroy them. He filled his stomach with berries and fruit and doled out the pittance to his crawling tribesman. He became very cruel with his followers and bashed them on the head if they showed any indication of standing erect. one man had stolen a glimpse of the valley beyond them. He told the others and one by one they all stood erect and disposed of their leader. A new leader was elected from their midst. For the first time in their lives they walked proud and erect to possess their promised land."

"event","In the many flings I've had, there's really only two relationships worth writing about in a journal. One, was a girl who had so many eccentricities I can only name a few rather than spend entire weeks trying to document them, and even begin to try to figure out how to understand them. My favorites were how she was afraid of doorknobs and would use a kleenex out of the pack she kept in her purse, another was that she kept a writing journal and would write in the bathroom, crook of a tree in her yard, and even in the bomb shelter her father built to save them from the nuclear bomb. she loved the bomb shelter and spent most of her time in there, we did, she had the same fear of the nuclear bomb she was certain would kill us all any day now. she'd take us in there, shutting and locking the door, talking of the nuclear bomb and impending doom. But with all the eccentricities she still had great body, and a mind that was far greater than my own. The bomb shelter was small, but at least it was private and fun, although half the time was dark. The second one, was everything normal except her sexuality, and even that she hid from everyone brought me. she wore all the pretty colors and fashionable clothes, she had blonde hair that was always done up, she wore makeup in a way that made it look like she wasnt wearing any but you could tell when we made out or more, her make up smeared and her hair was messy but didnt stay that way, she was done up within minutes. she was an A student, and wouldnt dream of taking drugs, she had a boyfriend although mock but he didnt know that until six months passed and he hadnt gotten a any from her, it took him that long cause he was fucking other girls on the side. she was unhappy when they broke because she was afraid people would notice us, and soon we broke up. After that i went into a severe depression, because i had loved her through it all and now she tells me it's over and that now all of the sudden she likes men. the depression eventually put me in a hospital, as my mother freaked out after she cut me loose from the rope around my neck and tied to a cieling rafter. i was first diagnosed with  depression, then anxiety when i had a panick attack that sent me into hyperventilation and then i fainted. lastly i was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which made me this dramatic suicidal freak because of the stigma i and my society and even psychiatric circles placed on borderline. i was released, unfortunately even after the depression and panic attacks quit and didnt come back the first two labels stuck to me like bolted in fixtures. i'll talk about borderline in my next journal."

"event","My Greatgrandfather found the alcove like town of Vernon. He was originally from a town in Michegan. His only son had been drafted. So my great grandafther, his son and his wife, my grandmother and her husband, and my grandma sister moved here for their brother to escape the Vietnam war, a war they all despised because it was a war the U.S. shouldnt have gotten involved in. My mother and brother were born here, it was near forgotten that my granfather was not his sons father, but some man  my grandmother had met in the states, i only found this out many years later by talking to my mother about grandma one day when i was working on a portrait of the stoic, stately, majestic looking woman, who was kind as rain for harvest, and hard as a drought when she was upset or was displining someone. My mother says my first word as ""grandma"" and she had grown to resent her mother for the candy, chocolate, gifts of toys, and mountains of videos grandma shared with all of her six grandchildren. My Grandmother died when i was still young, and became my first wound of many and one of the two greatest injury's of my short life, the second was my parents, who fought hardily every day and could brake into blows at the simplest of things such as what to watch or what to buy or not, when they divorced it was like something in me broke up with them. Finally i was shooed into a grade eight a few years early, discovered that it was a challenge that could make me happy, and i dived into schoolwork and drugs head first, maintaining a B+ average, while experimenting with drugs, was great fun. I found that i didnt care much for hallucinogens or depressants, although i liked alchol because it got me a desent amount of sleep althrough the high school trouble and anxiety attacks. i found that i liked cocaine good deal, but only in portions that made me faster, more intense, hightened my senses, and focused my attention. i found that caffiene was a good enough substitute, when i didnt have the money for coke, and that it only worked in the pill form for me. In that time of high school i found i had not interest for boys, i thought i was one of those people who would never have sex or something strange like that, but then i found myself making out with this girl in the bathroom at school and when i told my friends, they laughed because i was the last to know i was a lesbian. the word always sounded foreign and odd to me and perhaps always will. i then proceded to be extremely promiscous to the point where my sexuality was known in almost all the high schools in vernon except Kal. but sex is just as weird and foriegn, i enjoy, but i swear i have NO IDEA what i am doing. Sex for me is like everything else in my life, it's in the dark, pitch black dark. so finally i got bored of the high school world in vernon with all the same girls, and all the same darkness, so i applied early to the okanagan college, into the ABE program to finish my high school studies, in the hopes that being there soon i would learn more educationally, and my sex and sexuality would get some light shed onto it. College starts wednesday, and the begining of college will hopefully will be the beginning of world outside of my pitch black darkness. boring, huh?"

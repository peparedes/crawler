The elevator was fixed today! it's been six weeks i think. far too long. but all that's forgotten now that i don't have to walk up stairs.&nbsp;

so since i last posted, i went to amsterdam, my mommy and daddy came, and lauren's mommy and dan came.&nbsp; eventful.&nbsp;

so..OJ simpson...what. a crazy. he needs to be put away. the fact that he wrote the book, whether it ends up being distributed or not....it's just way. way too much. i can't even credit that as a sleezy but smart business move. that's just really evil.&nbsp;

nothing that i find too funny has happened. i've been wearing my underwear, not wearing corsets, staying out of feces. the usual i guess. i did see where anne boelyn got her head chopped off. and i don't fit into a dress that i did when i came here. so there are two fun facts for you.&nbsp;

I'm really done with school. i spend way too much time there. i'm sure i'll get a lot out of it later but for the meantime i'm really not improving acting-wise or enjoying it so i'm a little bitter. i just want to run around lonndon all the time, is that so wrong?&nbsp;

but my last week is fun time so i'm looking forward to that. and king john has been neat. my part is playing the piano and being a little sarcastic&nbsp;and demeaning. i mean i think i can handle it. and hopefully twelfth night will be fun. it better be with 12 hours of rehearsals six days a week. MAN that's a lot of time. but i'm confident it will be a good experience.&nbsp;

that's all for now...considering my record maybe for good. but one never knows, does one?

HAPPY FANKSGEEEVEEEENG! GOBBLE GOBBLE GOBBLE!"

MERRY CHRISTMASTIME!!! Yep, that's right, november first. Christmastime. is here.&nbsp;

I got back from Greece on Saturday night. It was great, though nothing really amusing happened. It was just spectacularly beautiful all the time.&nbsp;and now it's FREEZING in london.&nbsp;

Actually, I don't have any real stories. Although this weekend in Amsterdam should be pretty exciting, considering I don't know where i'm sleeping yet. This will be my European adventure.&nbsp;

Really, it's cold here. This morning I was glad because I was beginning to regret bringing my big winter jacket instead of my thinner coat, but i NEEDED it today. brrrr.&nbsp;

Last night was halloween, and I had class at night. WHAT THE DICK? i was not happy about it, if it wasn't my favorite class and if i didn't get free chocolate and dismissed an hour and a half early and we didn't watch both Alfies (with michael caine and jude law) then i would have cracked some skulls. But luckily all of those lined up and i only sulked a little bit during the day.&nbsp;

Guy Fox day better be great, because England needs to make up for it's crappy halloween. 

That's all for now. I'll try to have something fun happen in amsterdam that i can write home about."

"event","went to paris this weekend. you know...paris paris paris.....i lay in dog poop. for an hour. 

i don't know if telling the story would either make it funnier or more understandable. iiiii went to a park. sat down. in poop. lay down. in poop. talked about how they must just use a lot of fertilizer to get the grass so green, and that's why the park smells like poop. watched a dog roll in poop and comment on how much i loved watching them have so much fun in shit...annnnnd....smelled a clump of dirt i saw thinking that it might have been dried up poop, explaining the smell. yes i did all of these things...before realizing...that i was covered in fecal matter. 

i mean i'd say why me? but really there's no one better than me for that to happen to. for as much time as i've devoted to talking about it...really it was only a matter of time before i needed to walk the walk. 

i was going to play with some alliteration and say i was the duke of the doo...lady of the loads...you know. but in order to do that of course i had to go to the poop thesaurus (http://www.heptune.com/poopword.html....as if you didn't know that already)...and one person listed ""chunky poop"" and a synonym for ""poop."" now...i'm no master of the english language....but....last i checked an adjective did not make a word synonymous with itself. the fact that it's the same word, maybe. but that chunky is just unnecessary. and, if i may be so blunt, crude and distasteful. sphincter spear, on the other hand, now holds a special place in my heart. 

but paris. also i was physically accosted by a man intent on selling me a friendship bracelet made out of string. really i was grabbed by both sides and pushed around a bit. you know, all he had to do was make a baked good. that's how friends are made. d-oy. he really just went about it the wrong way, and i denied his demand, and wriggled myself out of his grips, to be seen off with a ""fuck you."" it was 10AM on a sunday morning outside of one of the most famous churches in the world (sacre couer) and i was cursed at. i felt violated. i mean i yelled it back, but only after i was confident the big man would give me a bye. 

we also met a french man on the train who when we talked about parking illegally, drinking illegally in public, and prostituting illegally....could only reply with...""well, it's not legal, but what are they going to do? arrest me? fine me? no, of course not."" so there's france. 

annnnd you know...i was in paris. and did like, stuff. awesome stuff. paris is AWESOME."

it's cooled off as well. but i still seem to be constantly sweating. what's up? 

i got called out for being too ghetto the other day? kind of. but i'll leave it at that because it's better that way. it was in stage combat class which is GREAT. but it makes me want to pistol whip someone. which i'm thinking is not a normal reaction. anyway i DOMINATE. and yes maybe it's because shakespeare wrote it to have the english win...but i like to think i have a hand in there as well. i mean i did take the bucks county community college class ""write your own shakespeare"" after all.

"event","HAPPY OCTOBER! it goes without saying that i watched nightmare before christmas today. 

i also went to a sports bar with laurlaur where they play football! i only watched the last quarter of the colts/jets game but it was GREAT. and there was a philly fan wearing shorts in october that just kept saying what they should do or what was going to happen. felt like home. 

i had an elizabethan costume class last week, and some things i learned werrreeee....
1~in order to make themselves look more pale, women would put white makeup on. and they had the choice between makeup based with either lead...or...asbestos. so then they would get sores and just cover it up with more makeup. Elizabeth actually lost her teeth and went bald while she was queen because of the poisonin...but then because she had such a big forehead as she was losing her hair, women would shave their hairline to get a bigger forehead to look like her. 

BUUUUT the more interesting one is 2~that women would wear shirst that cut so low, their boobs would just be hanging out. full. on. boobies. all the time. lucy and ethel ain't got no place to hide. 

i also tried a real corset for the first time. like lady had her knee pushing against my back and everything.  and i want to wear one all the time. it was so cool. it didn't keep me from breathing at all, and squishy people like me are just MADE for it, because everything just gets moved around and held into place. i didn't even realize i had boobs except for the fact that i could wipe my nose with them because everything was just in there and was NOT moving. really. lifechanging. i want one. i was tempted to buy a girdle but i just don't think it will be the same as that corset. that was spectacular. 

people in my program use the word ""lovely"" like it's going out of style...it's... a little much. and yeah i use ""awesome"" more than i would ever like to admit...but WE'RE NOT BRITISH AND YOU CAN'T SAY LOVELY UNLESS YOUR BRITISH. also wanker...does not work if you're american. and we're american. deal with it you lame-os. 

there are not pretzels here. i mean i guess the mennonites or whatever religion started pretzels got kicked out of england at some point, but IT IS TIME TO KISS AND MAKE UP. i bet a lot of people here have never had a pretzel. what kind of life is that? there has never been a better combination of starch and sodium. HENRY VIII THIS IS PROBABLY SOMEHOW YOUR FAULT.

"event","I have seen zero hours of football while being here. And by football I mean football, don't think for one second i'm one of those people. So football, none of it. makes sense. i was completely prepared for that.

But yet today in the gym, on BRITISH TELEVISION, out pops a minute long commercial about...Terrell Owens. And not even about him, just various clips of plays he's made throughout his careers and soundbites of people saying that how great he is. And. excluding politicians, I don't think i've ever seen a commercial advertising a person. There's always some kind of merchandise attached. But not in this case. not at all. TO, ladies and gentleman, T.O. 

And i heard he tried to leave the party early yesterday. I guess a broken hand doesn't get the headlines it used to. neither does making a minute long homage to yourself and putting it on tv in the UK...where they don't play football. Go big or go home Terrell. 

Also, the vh1/mtv hybrid in the gym airs newlyweds. and not in the ""lets see if we can tell where this went wrong"" sense. the intro still says ""how long will the honeymoon last?""

yeah, i miss american tv. cable i will never take you for granted again. 

i didn't know bill clinton was here the past three days. and apparently he spent all his time at a jazz club in soho. i would have been on that had i known. biiiiillll come back and bring america too.

nothing funny happened today. woah but i did find out that tisch is just giving me ten pounds because they think week four is a difficult week for us. so that's a foreign custom that i hope to bring back to new york with me. 

i bought a vegetable i've never seen today. i thought it would taste like  a sweet potato but it didn't, maybe it's because i didn't put any butter or sugar on it but i think instead i'm going to chalk it up to english food is bad. not my cooking. phsyah. as if. 

another milk went bad. that's five now. why isn't that proof that it doesn't work properly? we've even bought milk from other stores as an experiment. the fridge just does not keep things cold enough. the elevator is broken again too LAME.

Elevators don't have close buttons. only open buttons. this has not been something i like about elevators. 

MAN my life is just ACTION PAAAACKKKKEED. i'm going to have to stop here just so i can try to get fifteen minutes of sleep in before something NEW and EXCITING and BRITISH happens to me."

"event","oooo not doing to well with the frequent updates and it's like...week 3 1/2. whatever. in a related story, i've decided that i am going to bring back the hand sign for ""whatever."" i've already got my security guard elijah doing it, so i'm well on my way. 

this weekend laurlaur and i went to brighton. it was vedy vedy naice. i mean it was a beach that i liked being at. that says a lot. and i've decided rock beaches are more fun than sand beaches. and that i miss having a dog a lot.puuuuuppppyyy where aaareee youuu? oh maybe most importantly though, starting the day with hot chocolate, having fudge mid-day, and then eating chocolate chip cookies and nutella is not a plan for a happy stomach. just a happy mouth. 

perhaps the best part of the weekend, though, came about 5 minutes after we checked into our hotel. While giving LL her key, i noted how we were trusted with two keys, refering to christa and elyce's trip where the hotel refused to give them both available keys. lauren of course laughed because i'm hilarious and then began to make a sarcastic comment of her own, but simultaneously.....dropped her key down the elevator shaft. that little crack in between the elevator and the floor...key down there. probably the most perfectly timed ex-lax move ever. and that's why i stay friends with her. because god knows she doesn't shower.  

also we found out the slogan for carlson is ""probably the best beer in the world,"" and deemed that probably the best slogan in the world.

"event","it's kind of hit me that these are hard to update. Like i could say things i did, but except for the fact that they happened in a different country, they're kind of uneventful. so i guess what the plan will be to just remind you that my life is captivating enough to write down is that any time i say something that sounds like it could happen anywhere i'll just put...and i'm in england. or that's what she said i guess...just to mix it up. so then you'll know that you're not wasting time by reading. although really who are we kidding you're obsessed with me more than i am with myself. 

wow i think the only letter i capatalized in that paragraph was like. and it was completely not grammatically necessary, in fact i would say not gramatically correct. I could erase it, but then I would have to fill this space with something else. 

Soooooo things in the past few days. I started RADA and I have lonnnnng hours but it doesn't look like they expect us to rehearse outside of class so i'm guessing it might end up being less work than atlantic. like once the first four weeks are over at least three hours a day are for rehearsing whatever production we're working on. so that should be neat. 

Also i had my first stage combat class and we had long swords in our hands within 5 minutes of class starting. Although it was fun I couldn't help thinking the whole time ""None of us knows what we're doing, and yet we're not really questioning the fact that we're lunging at each other with swords. mkay."" And our teacher said a couple times that you want to stay out of the other person's sword range, so if they swing when you're not ready they still won't hit you...""you know, like in a real fight."" ......and then I thought you...probably play a lot of dungeons and dragons, huh? I mean he's got to be a LARPer, who else has ""real"" fights? although I read some article (reality article, for any from PA) that said those two were nothing alike, so what the hell do I know. 

Heeennyway, Lauren got here, that was the event of the week. We're friends. and we're in England. 

Today i was in the gym and people just came in and were gathering around the tv to watch one of the soccer matches today. It was neat like you would never see people having a good time watching a football game at home in a gym. Although to be honest most of the people at my gym are 65+ so i'm not exactly being fair here. still i've been there when wheel of fortune was on and they didn't get nearly as excited. 

I guess I look more Anglo than I thought, because I get stopped for directions ALL THE TIME. And one time someone stopped me and I started talking, and then they asked me where in Australia I was from. And one girl from NYU asked me how long I have lived in London in the middle of conversation with her. And apparently some guy from Texas thought i was from here too. I mean i know i'm pale and don't have a southern accent, but really? When's the last time you heard an English person with a voice quite as shrill as mine? i mean i'll take it though, as long as i don't sound like an American who wants to be British. I hate that more than I thought I would. 

So a scandal here is the fact that people are up in arms that models here for fashion week are skinny. they tried to pass legislation last week saying that a five foot nine model would have to weigh at least 123 pounds in order to walk. The average model for fashion week now is 5'9"" and 110 pounds. Seriously? Seriously. What the dick? I mean I can't imagine supporting a government taking time to pass a law saying that you can't give jobs to people who don't meet a weight requirement, but really? 110 pounds on a 5'9"" body? what the dick? to kind of quote my father...i've had crabs in my pants that were bigger than that. 

that didn't really work. and i've also never had crabs, for the record. but I just loved that line. 

I'm going to Paris this weekend and a Cruise to Greece and Turkey in five weeks. Jealous bitches?!?!yeyyyyaaaaahhhh.

Also i thought being in london would be a motivation to kind of spend more than ten minutes on my appearance in the morning. that has proven very false. very false indeed.

"event","Dick NYU Housing. Really dick them. So my place is generally ghetto compared to the other buildings for various reasons, like no access to laundry rooms (because of stupid freshmen,) tiny rooms that we pay the same price for, no cable, two tiny fridges for five people, one of which has had three milks go bad before their expiration date and will not be fixed because the repairman said that it felt cold to him, and being next to the freshman dorm, where they are clearly fully enjoying their first couple weeks of school, judging by the fact I can hear them all night long. 

But last night, i got stuck in the elevator. By myself, in between the third and fourth floor. Which is annoying in itself, but just got more aggravating. I started off when i  realized i was stuck by pressing the alarm button and screaming down hoping the security guard would hear me. Then i realized that he was probably out smoking hookah with the freshman, because that's what this guy does while at work. So I thought I would call the building engineer from the Elevator phone, where it gave his number. But that didn't work. Then i tried something labeled ""agent,"" though I didn't know what that quite meant. But that didn't matter because that didn't work either. I ended up biting the bullet and calling emergency, and they said they would send a fire brigade, and asked for my address. Well, I know the address i was given, but the one attached to the elevator phone had an address i hadn't seen before. i figured maybe it was special for the police, there was another entrace for emergencies or something along those lines, so i gave them that address. Nope, wrong. THE ELEVATOR HAD THE WRONG ADDRESS. Luckily they knew what phone I had called from, and the emergency people eventually got there. So they got me out, and the security guard was there too, and said that I shouldn't have called the fire dept, because he has a key for the elevator when it gets stuck. I have no idea how that would have worked, but really didn't feel like talking to him if i didn't have to. So I just thanked the firemen and went upstairs, where i found out the same thing had happened to my roommate that morning. yep. yep. Apparently having an elevator stop working wasn't enough of a reason to get a mechanic to look at it, because later in the day it started working again on its own. magic. 

So that was something. In other news i start school tomorrow at RADA and am scared. Also worth mentioning that in the past two weeks I've been here theres been a little bit of rain on just one day. And it's been warmer here than in Philly and New York. Nanny nanny poo poo. I know, I know, I just bring the sunshine with me where ever I go."

Today i went commando. 

It wasn't planned. It just happened. I went to the gym expecting to go right to the brick lane festival. so i brought a towel, some pants, a shirt, a bra, even deodorant....

no underwear.

I kept thinking that my pants were transparent the whole time i was walking around the festival. At one point two men were walking behind me and I KID YOU NOT ONE OF THEM WHISTLED THE TUNE TO I SEE LONDON. I know I said I would make things up, but this is the real deal. 

I know this experience may seem like old hat to many, but it was an adventure to me, and not one I hope to take again. I love underwear.

In  other news, I'm going to go to the gym on a regular basis, if not for the fact that i had to pay a pretty penny to go, than for the fact that they have an mtv/vh1 channel. I have five channels at my place, and they're all british. Lots of British tv is bad. Bad in the sense that when i watch it i feel worse than i do when i watch vh1 and e! That kind of bad. 

for the record: clotted cream~very bad name, very good taste. 
also, new movies can cost 24 bucks a pop here. 
and a yeast infection is called ""thrush"" here. i worried about that all day whilst wearing no undies."

"event","I'm not really sure why I've decided to do this. I can't imagine my daily happenings being so much more exciting to anyone but myself that they merit being recorded and posted on the internet, but i'm abroad. This is what you do when you're abroad. 
RADA classes still haven't started. I want them to though, thinking about them without knowing anything makes me queasy. Also making me queasy is the fact that I have to write essays for my theatre and film class. Really? Essays? 8-10 pages? Abroad? NOT what I was expecting. 
I met George Galloway last week. He's a member of the House of Commons who really opposes Blair so he was in high spirits when I met him because it was the day 6 of Blair's aides quit on him. I thought he was pretty intimidating when we were in his office, but later on I was talking to a security guard at my building about how three of us went to meet him, and the guard called him a pussy cat. I thought he was referring to his politics, or just...throwing out minimally offensive insults until I saw on tv Galloway on Big Brother Celebrity edition pretending to be a cat. So that put a different spin on things. 
I went to Shakespeare's Globe a couple times and saw In Extremis and Comedy of Errors. I really want to do a comedy this semester. I don't think many people are in the program agree with me though. They just can't seem to realize that watching men get kicked in the balls will forever be the most entertaining thing that could be put on stage. 
I also went to the British Museum and saw a bunch of dead mummies. Not that you can't see that in Philly or New York but there were more of them here. There was this one guy that was just but in the sand when he died and because he didn't have a coffin the sand sucked all the moisture out really fast and the soft tissue just kind of ..leatherized?...instead of decomposing. So there was a 4000 year old body just lying there. The best thing about these museums is that they're free so if you're like me and can't enjoy being there for more than an hour (generous) you don't have to stick it out to feel like you're getting what you paid for. 
Yesterday I went to Stonehenge and Bath. Stonehenge was everything you've seen in the pictures and nothing more. Except the area around it looked like most of PA, I felt like I was on my way to State College. Bath was really neat though, we went to the Roman baths and then went to tea at the Jane Austen centre. Not that we're tourists or anything....
Eggs cost over 4 bucks a dozen. I lived on eggs last semester. Getting protein will be a new challenge. 
Also, no hersheys and no chocolate chips. 
And nothing in my neighborhood stays open on the weekends.  
That couldn't have been an entertaining read. I may or may not make things up in the future to make it seem like creating this was worthwhile."

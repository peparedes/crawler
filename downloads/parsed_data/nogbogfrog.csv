It helped me realize what I liked in terms of tech, and in terms of teamwork.  I am going back to the software department with a lot of knowledge gained, and plenty of understanding about myself.  I am going back happily!

The primary purpose of my visit is to spend time with my grandmother.  There are also 2 weddings to attend.  Bengali weddings have a lot of pomp and circumstance attached.  A wedding really refers to the entire host of events, anywhere from 4 to 6.  A lot of the family has come back to Bangladesh for these 2 weddings.  So it's fun to see many cousins I haven't seen in an age.

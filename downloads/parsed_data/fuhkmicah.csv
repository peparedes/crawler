Ive been really lonely lately. 
Moreso because i have been neglecting my social responsibilities. 
Neglecting every opportunity to trust and be hurt. 

I hate letting my guard down. 
I hate the feeling. 
I hate the uneasiness always.. 
and the suspicion. 
I hate going through relationships liek that.

I thought i had a system.
I thought i figured it out.
But someone came along and messed it all up. 
I have let go of everythign i beleived in.
I am a mess.
And i have been neglecting everyone because of it.
I am so socialy disoriented.

I just hope this little bit of rope i have let him grab on to..
doesnt turn into a noose later on.

This really sucks. 
I need to eat something let alone get out of this room for once. 
Every night. 
same place. 
Sitting in my room.
Thinking about ways to fix this.
Ways i wil never ever be courageous to attempt in a million years.

Im so jealous..
and I hate being this way. 
Im a jealous person only when it comes to self image. 
With others.. i usualy dont care.
But lately..
Its been bothering me. 
Because i want somethign to happen so bad..
and there is no way of knowing if it really will.
I need someone to come over and give me hugs and drink tea with me
and listen to me babble on about all of this stupid mumbo jumbo. 



But no one really cares that much.

ok so..
I know i havent posted in a little while.
ok ok 
its been <b>AGES</b>

But I have <i>mainly</i> been working on getting that second lip ring.

I wish i would get paid already.
And i have to go in to work tonight 
and change my shift.
I said ""No, I cannot work Wednesdays""
and
I get scheduled for a <font size=4>
<b>6 HOUR SHIFT</b></font>
The same time as my night class. 

What can you expect from HMV

This library smells.
I think it is because of the girl who just sat next to me.
I wonder if she knows she has a pungent odor.
She seemed so unknowing.. 
She probably thought she smelled of daisies or something.
With her hopelessyl tangled baby blue knit scarf..
and what was left of a bad-haircut-bad-hair-yet-still-trying-every-morning look.

I love my school.

PS:
I think fat people should <B>NOT</B> wear white sweatsuits.

<b>EVER</b>

PSS: I'm meeting a boy soon <3    </p>"

ok
this is <u>gross</u>
the other day.. 
I woke up.. and when i looked in my bathroom mirror...
half of my lip was <b>HUGE</b>
you can guess which half was poofy.

<i>yes</i>
the pierced half.
my first infection.
I shoudl write a snarky little satirical childrens book.
Im in that kind of mood.

After being anal with it the swelling has gone down 50000%
[not <i>literally</i>DUH]
but it is still sore..
and crusty
and <b><u>GROSS</u></b>

plus
my cartiledge
[that i got done a few days ago]
would not stop bleeding
so my ear was constantly covered in blood
last night was the <b>FIRST</b> night it didnt bleed
and so far today it has been fine

sooo

im only going to assume its healing
=]
yay for self-mutilation
haha


im <i>such</i> a loser"

i need to move out.
like i have been carrying on about for the past little while.
=\
Today something happened that was.. amazing to say the least. 
i saw my best friend since i was a year old. thats around <b><i>15</i></b> years.. maybe a little less. 
anyways.. its been about 2 years since i last saw her...
and she looks so mature. 
she <u>flipped out</u> at the length of my hair
and the <s>new</s> frequent additions to my body
=]
but it made me realize how i <b>missed</b> her so much. 
and how i miss who i was when me and her spend too much time together. 
i was careless.. and carefree
and right now i jump from friend to friend..
and i need to settle

but i remember her vividly
her little Tim Horton's milkslush concoction
that long perfectly blonde hair i have been jealous of for ages..
her tall slender frame
another asset i have always wanted to myself. 

seeing a bunch of old friend has kind of got me down as well. 
Everyone is <u>growing up</u> and <u>moving on</u>.
they all look so <u>mature</u> and <u>gorgeous</u>..
and im still in <b>highschool</b>..
looking like the <i>12 year old boy</i>
i have <b>ALWAYS</b> looked like.

Still something I am comming to terms with.

On an official note..
i thought i would finaly let the world know.
I have a <b>crush</b> on a boy.

I know i know..
everyone is probably all:
<font size=6>
OMFGWTFNOTAGAIN</font>

But trust me..
this isnt one of my ""ooh he is cute so i have a crush"" kind of crushes. 
I think when i have to much time on ym hands i will officialy type out all the different types of crushes one person can have.

back to topic.
Name and such shall be held for security purposes. 



and now..
the grand finale:
<font sixe=4>
<b>
omgheissocuteandsoabsolutelyprettyinthefaceandohmygoshitsjustsowickedrad</b>
</font>
Sorry..
i just <i>had</i> to

<b>This</b> is getting fucking ridiculous.
<i>this</i>: 
current situation occuring inside home as of recent

My father's fiance is a bitch.
She <u>purposefuly</u> thinks of ways to go against anything..
and i mean <b>anything</b> i may need or want.

I <b>have</b> to leave
have to
I cant stand her or her bullshit

If anyone
<u><i>anyone</i></u>
has a place where I can stay for awhile..
it would be appreciated.


Apart from the <s>house</s> HELL I live in...
Im going to save every penny
and go and finish getting the piercings I want.
Fuck what they say.

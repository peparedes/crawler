"event","ALright so I am in New York right now...I love it hear! Even though it's been raining since I got in. It's so beautful. I'm not in the City...I'm in the country. It's so awesome. I would love to live in a place like this. The houses are beautiful! There's so much land...it's just awesome. So anyways...Jenn and Troy are probably getting married tomorrow and then I am coming home Friday night. I fly in at 11:38pm. I'm really not looking forward to going back home. It's been really nice not being around my mom so much. I think we will get along much better once I move out. We are just not compatible to be living with each other...which is not uncommon with Mother's and Daugthers. 4 months you guys!!! 4 months and I can MOVE OUT!!!! I can't believe it. It's actually coming really fast. Well, once I got to 8 months away...it was moving really slow. But then when I hit 5 months....time has just flown. The past two months seem like a couple of weeks. It's really nice. I hope it continues like this!!! lol...alright well anyways. I will try to get to the mall and get everyone a present. I can't make any promises though. We don't have a car 98% of the time. But I will try!!! I love you all! I will see you when I get home!!!!!!

XoXo,
Julie"

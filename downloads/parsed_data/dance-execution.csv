"event","Toooooday I walked to school in the freezing cold,
Went to art and listened to the kids i dont like talk about runescape or whatever they were talking about.
Went to social studies and stared out the window.
Went to math and did the same.
Went to lunch and ..nothing interesting happened. D:
Went to tech and drew a picture and poked conner,then he fell and layed on the ground and everyone was like ""OMG CONNER!"" and stared at him.
Then I went to science and ACTUALLY DID WORK :O.
Then I went to spanish and...did nothing.
Then I went to the computer lab and ...did nothing.
Then I went to study hall and sit in the corner of the cafe while everyone was on the other side telling each other riddles and it was stupid. 



Bye =]

p.s. I want to go to walmart :("

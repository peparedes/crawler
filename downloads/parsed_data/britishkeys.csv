"event","Well i think like half of the high school population i am in love with the idea of being mrs.darcy...oh it was an amazing movie...proabably would have been better if there hadnt been all of those ""great"" people making comments and shouting, talking on their cell phones,etc.  By the by it was the most amazing Romance movie i have ever seen.  Love the genius that came up with that ending.  Incredible.  Best part was of course the rain scene and uhhhhhhhhh the fog scene.  Honestly why can guys not be that way anymore.  There seems to be no romance left in the world.  No heart felt romance.  Oh to live in that surreality.  I would be in heaven.  I think half of the people didnt respect that movie partly because they have not read that book.. This is one movie that does the book justice..and that is a hard to find quality in hollywood productions today.  By the way if you don't already know they are filming some scenes to the prequel of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" right down the street.   LOL in Martindale of all places.  Well it is pretty late and i need some sleep so for now i will talk to yall later.  Free Refills anyone? :D im bored
Good night und schalft gut.
Kye"

"event","You know I never thought it would be this hard to host a exchange student.  It sounds stupid but it is alot of stress.  Last night at Michaels party some peeps and me were talking about it and it is like having a child to take care of.  On the topic of Michaels party it was pretty good.  Just chillin basically and enjoying some amazing lasagna and cheescake.  Found out that Elfie and Astrid are crazy. Weeee Armadillo's.  Skippy fell and hurt himself in an attempt to scare Susan and I.. To say the least it was pretty hilarious. We also went to Gruene that day too.  It was good I think the Germans had fun and all.  We went to the Outlet Malls after and i ""accesorized"" :D That made me happy.  Today we went and ate at Hong Kong.  Lecker! I saw about 5 peeps from school at H-E-B.  Such a small town lol.  anyhow Caitlyns ""welcome party"" went well.  We swam and hung out at the river.  I got a stone bruise on the ball of my foot but that did not stop me from jumping on the trampoline :D School still sucks.. It is the ""debby downer"" of my life.  That and stupid people that think that having a gf is the only thing that matters and no matter how long they have been involved in somthing they can put it off until the last second and excpect everyone to be ok with it.  Hell no is all i have to say.  That and couples in general make me sad....I am so lonely it isnt even funny.  Yes I have friends and a german that i love but you know just that some you can kiss and hug and just be with is missing from my life.  Speaking of my german she is crazy but a good kind of crazy. :d She does her stretches and makes all these weird noises lol.  and she was playing with the vaccum lol she is crazy!  Well i guess i dont blame her..i subjected her to Napoleon Dynamite today while everyone went bowling...good times.  Well for now thats it i am kinda tired. 

Ciao

"event","Well I thought that I would take this time out of my day to rant and rave.  I must for my own self.  I keep everything built up inside and although I may hint that somthing is wrong I never express it.  Its time to let loose and even if I sound stupid in the process I will hopefully feel better.       So of course now I am the utmost alone.  Its sad and there isnt anything it seems that I can do.  I see people who are happier than I and they all seem to be in a nice functional relationship.  What is it about me that makes me so relationship incapable?  And also what is with that fact that the only people that I ever seem to want are people already with someone else?  It doesnt seem fair that that well I dont know.  It isnt fair that others can have their way when it seems that no matter what I am inevitaly doomed to seldomly see things go my way.  Now that I am thinking about it I happend to stumble upon an old memory.  Well it will be about a year old in November but still.  It seems like such a long time ago that for a split second in my life things might have actually gone my way.  I wonder what happend to make it happen and what happend to make it end.  Its sad because what ever caused it to end is still haunting me today to this very second.  I seem so touchy when it comes to this subject.  I was told to wait it out.  To be the invisible girl and then one day be the girl who takes their breath away.  Maybe it will happen maybe it wont, but oh how I want it to.  It seems that I live for this.  I cannot imagine my crumy life with out the thing that makes me crum.  It so sad yet so hard to give up the thing that I love so much.  One day yes maybe one day I will conquer it and be like ""haha I have conquered you"" but no that seems so unreasonable.     Another thing, when ever I am around people that I am not totally comfortable with ,such a people that I think think they are better than me, I feel so out of place.  I feel like I may be trying to hard to fit in and be one of them when in reality I want to be myself but be excepted for who I am but that doesnt look like it is going to happen either.  Im not trying to hard Im just there :(  It doesnt help that half of those people intimidate me.    And another big problem to my screwed up and disfunctional life are my brothers.  Now it is mainly my stupid and imature younger brother who lives with me but this weekend it was both.  I went and visited my older brother,his wife and their new child.  Now my god he is 30, has a kid, and STILL treats me like shit.  I hate it.  Almost as much as I hate the crap my younger brother pulls.  I am constantly fed up with him and then he goes and has a bad day and expects me to give him a damn ounce of respect when he never even thinks about doing it for me! I just hate that shit.  Well for now thats it.  Other than school but I wont even go there..........ohhhhhhhhh...... ok whatever im out for the count....1....2.....3...a....b....c......Kye"

"event","So last night at around midnight my older brother calls us to tell us that tami( his wife) is in labor.  Its pretty amazing that life works this way.  There are some things in life that are sacred, for my brother and tami this is one.  The major life changer, from now on they will always have this little ""critter"" to look after.  And i hope it goes well.  And then of course there are other things in life that are sacred and not meant to be openly shared with the world.  And in turn that kinda makes life complicated.  But no one can really change that but anyhow tomorrow is (as props movers) our first real day of practice.  EXCITING! not well its all good i guess.  I gotta go Hong Kong is calling my name yummy:D"

"event","One of the most talked about topics is one that is on my mind all the time now.  America it seems may be falling.  I dont know maybe it is kinda dumb to think that, but it sure doesnt seem to be getting better.  First and foremost, the hurrican katrina that hit louisianna has caused a ripple affect all over the south, and also the fact that it isnt the last one is even worse.  the fact that people are dying in masses and that it will take years to restore and even get help is outrageous.  Now i know that we can't all blame bush for everything even though it may be partly his fault for not listening, but omg what is his deal?  My mom and her friend where thinking about going to louisianna to help but they decided not too bc of all the looters and all the chaos and such.  I want to help out as much as i can so i donated all i had and ask that yall wil consider doing the same. pitching in to the local orginizations that are going to send money to the red cross or something would be one of the best things for our country today. On another note gas prices are ridiculous, yet another ripple felt by the entire coninent of the USA.  Its completly bonkers.  they say prices will go up to $4 on monday and i know, like the majority of the peeps out there cant afford to drive anywhere anymore.  I want a hybrid car.  my birthday is soon but that doesnt matter.  On a lighter note my mom got me a awesome ring today for a early birthday present.  Its an eastern star.  My greatgrandmother was a part of that orginization its cool. well i gotta go figure out whats gunna go down."

My last first day at high school went pretty good except for one small,almost unnoticable thing that happend this morning, it still kinda erks me, i am determined to not read into it to much though.  All classes are good, in most of my classes i know someone but in my 2nd period i know no one except the teacher.  We did that ""Exercise"" where you go around the class and name EVERYONE!  ok here it goes, dorthy,cat,chris,bradley,dylon,stephanie,ashton,leeann,constatine,juan,bryan,george,michael,jessie,eric,gumaro,johnathan,fransisco,gina,nate,paulette,victoria,miss reynolds,jessie and amy.  i think that is everyone. They changed my Communication teacher to mrs.morales! grr i have known her too long to take her seriously and everyone else just thinks she is loopy,which she is beginning to be.  Its quite scary.  anyhow all other classes are ok other than mrs.schifletts room is freezing! like nippy noodles totally.  well i guess i will see everyone tomorrow and hey samantha, does your bunney have a limpy ear bc if it does it might be a ""dwarf rabbit"" i had one when i was younger but it died but it was really cute.  ok well like georgia says, im away laughing on a fast camel.

And then i usually find myself once again hoplessly taking quizzes on quizzila.com wishing for a good outcome.I mean honsetly, one quiz says im a ""loner artist"" the other says im the "" perfect girlfrind"" which is sad because i wouldnt know!*tear o well life seems to go on though  one day it will stop but i hope it doesnt come to that any time soon.  It sucks sometimes when you look back on life and see all the crappy points and the sad points when what should have happned didnt.  But then again you see the good times even though they are limited.  Its too hot to go horseback riding and that upsets me, i cant wait until the fall.  My sister-in-law is pregnant and due on September 12th.....grrrr. That birthday isnt that great already I hope he comes sooner or later than that.  So my family will probably head out to california to ""celebrate"" the critter but that probably means no coldplay concert, o well it cost to much anyhow, hey you know that good feeling you get when you let your hair down after it has been in a pony tail for so long, yea i made some scrumpcious things this night, they were yummy. Lecker!hmmmm i am a true virgo, nice to know, this is what this one quizzy thing told me,,,,, true love comes from a scorpio, capricorn, taurus, your own virgo, and sometimes aquarius.hmmmmm oy ve i will have a hard time falling asleep tonight. who's damon? i went and worked out today for a long while, yes this is getting random...ahhh im sorry everyone, lol or just those few who read it. im going to write a book.  again.  ok i got what i came for now its time to go and TRY to sleep haha sleep whats that, o shit i have to wrap my leg darn scar ""made in Germany"" my butt ugh anywho gute nacht"

Does anyone know of any place hiring?  I need to get a job, kein mula.  ach so, das ist sehr shada.  Ich bin traurig.

"event","It is a truth universally acknowledged that one must be taught,learn,or be adapt to mingle.  I have come to the conclusion after many ""get-to-gethers"" that i am not a person that can do this so easily, even when it is with people i know and love.  It is not in my character to do so, so i always end up being the one who sits by herself watching everyone else have fun, and/or talk to others.  But one thing that i can conclude from not being able to mingle is that i do not make a fool of my self by talking loud and boasting about myself continuously.  I may in other ways make a fool of myself by it seeming that i do not want to talk to anyone and if this is so it is not true i just need encouragment for me to have a good time and it is sad i know.   Something else i have come to realize is that i have a tendancy to screw up my left knee hardcore and it is getting very annoying.  O and dont you just love it when you are ignored so bluntly by one of your so called ""friends""?  Eyes just sweep over you when they are looking for better people to say bye to.  Maybe i just need to build a bridge and get over it but it is something that i wish wouldnt end so sourly.  Today is my dads birthday and i have found the perfect card to suit him.  I also pledged to go work out today to which although i need it i dont seem to want it at times.  So to wrap this up I once again take on the role of Elizabeth Bennet or Bridget Jones as my life character.  Still waiting for my Mr.Darcy tho.

I might be going to the beach again this weekend and if i am i am so taking Christina she deserves a break.  I cant believe how fast the summer has gone by.  I need to do something.  Im bored and yea, what else is there to say.  I also need a new vehicle.  I dont trust the Miata anymore.  A revolutionary thing happend yesterday...i cleaned my room so it actually looks nice, its quite amazing! i need a rug tho, i saw one at target that i really liked, but it cost $99 which is sher teuer( very expensive)...sad thing happend last night, i just opened the back door so i could feed the cat that we have adopted(her name is lulu) and all of a sudden this wasp lands on my lip and STINGS me! it hurt but i was in shock so it took a while to set in ya know.

"event","Yes i know that is a stupid question but it WAS in the Trivial Pursuit game we played at Michaels.  Good times.  Well other than that there isnt really that much going on, other than my parents had a row and now arent talking, i swear its like high school.  I want to get out now please.... Well there is a possibility that i will go look at new cars today and i am really looking forward to that because i need one.  *Listenin to music that so totally reminds me of germany, good times also.  Its going to intresting in October when they come because after that it is likely that we shall never see each other again and there isnt much that we can do to stop it unless we go back to germany but that cost some mulla which alot of us dont have.  I still have yet to recieve my AP scores which will probably just say i did bad but i guess it is better to actually know rather than just guessing.  In the end that is the truth but for half of our lives we are left wondering which way to turn and end up guessing eh?  Maybe it could be worse but it coudl also be better, so on that not so deep thought lol im just making myself sound stupid now ,ciao,  kye"

"event","There isn't much going on here just like everyone else in the world i finished harry potter and it was awesome, but so much for raving about it i know that there are plenty doing that already.  So anyhow, seeing as tho i just got back from germany i want to go back to europe even with all these stupid terror attacks on london.  England is on of my favorite places that i have been and i just want to go back now.  I miss everybody beacause i havent been able to hang out with them because they are all out on vacation or doing something else more productive with their life.  I need a job, but until the germans come this fall i dont think i will have any room on my plate to squeeze anything else on there so maybe i will get one at the end of october hopefully.    Well since nobody is going to read this except for me it seems i might as well us it as a place to vent my feelings, but as usual i am still uptight about it.  New oportunities need to form their way towards me i am stuck in a rut without any help except my own and it really kinda bites.  But what is fun i have come to realize is camcorders and the random stuff you can catch on the like dropping a gerbal or what ever it was.  So to everyone out there , adios

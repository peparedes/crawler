"event","A window-cleaner in our street
Who fell, five storeys, at my feet,
Impaled himself on my umbrella.
I said 'Come, come, you careless fella!
If my umbrella had been shut,
You might have landed on my nut!'


William in one of his nice new sashes
Fell in the fire, and was burnt to ashes.
Mother said ""Though the room grows chilly
I haven't the heart to poke poor Willie.""


Little Willie from his mirror
Licked the mercury right off,
Linking, in his childish error,
It would cure the whooping-cough.
At the funeral, his mother 
   Smartly said to Mrs Brown,
""Twas a chilly day for Willie 
   When the mercury went down.""


Uncle, whose inventive brains
Kept evolving aeroplanes,
Fell from an enormous height
On my garden lawn last night.
Flying is a fatal sport;
Uncle wrecked the tennis court.


All those who see my children say,
""What sweet, what kind, what charming elves!""
They are so thoughtful, too, for they
Are always thinking of themselves.
   It must be ages since I ceased
   to wonder which I liked the least.
Such is their generosity,
That, when the roof began to fall,
They would not share the risk with me,
But said, ""No, father, take it all!""
   Yet I should love them more, I know,
   If I did not dislike them so.

    
""There's been an accident,"" they said. 
""Your servant's cut in half.  He's dead!"" 
""Indeed!"" said Mr. Jones. ""And please 
Send me the half that's got my keys."" 


Father heard his children scream, 
So he threw them in the stream, 
Saying, as he drowned the third, 
""Children should be seen, not heard!"" 

In the family drinking well 
Willie pushed his sister Nell 
she's there yet because it kilt her
We have to buy a filter. 


Dr. Jones fell in the well 
and died without a moan. 
He should have tended to the sick 
and left the well alone. 


Willie poisoned his father's tea; 
Father died in agony 
Mother came, and looked quite vexed: 
""Really, Will,"" she said, ""what next?!"" 
    
 
Willie saw some dynamite, 
Couldn't understand it quite; 
Curiosity seldom pays. 
It rained Willie for seven days. 


Making toast at the fireside 
Nurse fell in the grate and died. 
But what makes it ten times worse, 
All the toast was burnt with Nurse. 


willie with a taste for gore,
nailed his sister to the door,
mother said with humor quaint,
""now now willie dear, don't scratch the paint""


There was a young lady of Lynn
Who was so uncommonly thin
That when she essayed
To drink lemonade
She slipped through the straw and fell in.


Willie in the cauldron fell; 
See the grief on mother's brow; 
Mother loved her darling well -- 
Willie's quite hard-boiled by now. 


Little Willie with a shout, 
Gouged the baby's eyeballs out; 
Stamped on them to make them pop. 
Mother cried, ""Now, William, stop!"" 


Little Willie mean as hell, 
Threw his sister in the well! 
Said his mother when drawing water, 
'sure is hard to raise a daughter.'


Willie with the nursery shears 
Cut off both the baby's ears. 
To the baby so unsightly 
Mother raised her eyebrows slightly

Roachies

          by Amalee Wilson



twas the night before christmas and all through the coach, 
not a creature was sturring not even a roach, 

if roaches could talk i would ask 1 oneday, 
what else do you do, than run scurry and play?, 
he would start to reply in a very nice way, 
and what he said was ""WE DONT JUST RUN SCURRY AND PLAY!"" 

""arent you being rude mister roach"", 
""for something so small you know how to boast"", 
he replied ""well what are you gonna do?"" 
""hire a lawer and sue?""

i replied quite angrily""I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO LISTEN TO SUCH A DROOL!"", 
then i lifted my foot and smashed the daggum little fool!

"event","my Existing Situation 
Working to improve her image in the eyes of others so as to obtain their compliance and agreement with her needs and wishes. 

my Stress Sources 
Feels unappreciated and finds the existing situation disagreeable. Wants personal recognition and the esteem of others to compensate for the lack of like-minded people with whom to ally herself and make herself more secure. Her sensual self-restraint makes it difficult for her to give herself, but the resulting isolation leads to the urge to surrender and merge with another. This disturbs her as she regards such instincts as weaknesses to be overcome; only by not succumbing to them, she feels, can she withstand the difficulties of the situation. Wants to be valued as a desirable associate and admired for her personal qualities. 

my Restrained Characteristics 
Willing to participate and to allow herself to become involved, but tries to fend off conflict and disturbance in order to reduce tension.
Wants to broaden her fields of activity and insists that her hopes and ideas are realistic. Distressed by the fear that she may be prevented from doing what she wants; needs both peaceful conditions and quiet reassurance to restore her confidence.

my Desired Objective 
Suffering from the effects of those things which are being rejected as disagreeable, and is strongly resisting them. Just wants to be left in peace. 

my Actual Problem 
The need for esteem--for the chance to play some outstanding part and make a name for herself--has become imperative. She reacts by insisting on being the center of attention, and refuses to play an impersonal or minor role. 

Your Actual Problem #2 
Depleted vitality has created an intolerance for any further stimulation, or demands on her resources. This feeling of powerlessness subjects her to agitation and acute distress. She reacts by considering that she has been victimized, and insists--with indignation, resentment, and defiance--on being given her own way.

lotr character:Boromir, Heir of Denethor, Captain of the White Tower

Boromir goes to Rivendall after convincing his father, and tries to persuade the Walkers to follow him to Minas Tirith. He is constantly searching Frodo's face for non-verbal information.
You are good at winning others' confidence and not shy at telling others what to do. Social interaction energizes you. The more people the merrier. You have good observational skills. In your desire for clarity in life, you may have the tendency of being remote or even ""heartless"". You like keeping your options open. Closure is probably not one of your strong suits. 

Like Boromir, you are not content to sit on the sidelines while the action takes place around you.

Traits: Open minded, easy going, persuassive, optimistic about the future. On the dark side you could be exploitative and an opportunist.




With your 60 % you are: You are a DOG! You are loyal to your fellows... Blah, blah, blah... That's it!  

But you have almost become this: 
With your 30 % you are: You are a CAT! You are mostly alone although not lonely. You are comfortable with yourself... Whatever... 

And that you are not at all: 
With your 10 % you are: You are a MONKEY! You are a natural joker who is lively & full of life! Though too much MONKEYING around is bad!!!"

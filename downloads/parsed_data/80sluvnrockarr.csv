"event","lieing is like a disease. it consumes you. until you cant stop. it just goes on forever, and ever, and everyone knows your a lier.

It is hard to explain who i am. I am a very depressed child. well i should say young adult right?&nbsp;
I like to put on a front, a happy joking little front that amuses most people, i let them laugh it up and i along with them get some enjoyment. BUt like EVERYONE i hide things. but i want to let you know what i have hidden for so long.

i cut myself when i got depressed. i wouldn't find a razor blade to slide across my skin... i would scratch myself and just take off the top skin or i would gouge my skin or i would create a scaring desighn, i still have the scars on my arm and on both my legs. and sometimes when i get really worked up i want to do it again, and sometimes i do, but not like i used to.&nbsp;

I also have a tendancy to act like a whore. a complete and total whore. its&nbsp;a depressing scene to watch, my simple self searching for love and throwing myself at men to make myself feel beautiful. but the worst part is, is i realize all of it.. and it dosen't matter at all. i still do it.&nbsp;





okay i feel better now. just had to get it off my chest, maybe i can sleep now!"

"event","<p>okay so my life has been really crazy. it seems like i am making friends just as fast as i am losing them... i get the most random attention that i am not sure of whether or not i should be proud of. i want to live an explore everything, but i am barley making ""ends meet"" with my 3 jobs. how are people supposed to survive if they can't even make enought money to do so in ""today's society"" i try to wish the best for everyone, but i want to me selfish and yell and scream and kcik them until they see that ""the world does not revolve around"" their sole being. in a partnership people are supposed to express themselves as one unit, a unit i am afraid to commit to. for whatever reasoning i have. looking hard for the reality, i seem to be missing it every time. every laughter. every tear. every scream. every moment of love. i cant grasp them and pull them together to create anything... anything at all. its just a mess, a grey area of blobs that can focus into anything. maybe this time, is the final time. maybe its not, but whatever it is, i hope, i pray, i can make it work. maybe just this once.</p>"

"event","She didn't know how to react. All there was to say had been lost moments ago on his closed ego. She could not reach out to him, she couldn't, shouldn't and didn't want to. The thoughts of their first meeting scared her, every thought about him scared her; this was unusual. Her typical attitudewould suggest that she had no idea what being scared was. Years before&nbsp;she learned to block out the pain, thats why there was no reaction during their first meeting; or during this one. He stood before her, his green eyes were wide, bairly showing any white, and full with passion, a bad passion. The agression he held pulsed. She watched the waves of it peel of of him, and still she didn't know how to react. Now was not the time to let fear control her, let her back down from a fight. This was a battle she refused to hand over, it was her turn to let him see what she was before. Deep, steady breathing, in out, in out; they matched inhale for exhale and over agian. She didn't know why, or even how it came but it did and it hit him and he fell, hard. Not physically, but mentally he was gone. She watched him crumble at her feet and felt no remorse for it. It was time he learned that his years ahead of her made no difference. He was not the controling one. She had to live life with what she wanted, what wanted her. He did not want her but for the night; once a year when the time came around. It was a strange thought but she knew just how to show him. And with that, she got up, and she walked out."

i feel like i have lost my best friend 2 times over and that is really hard to deal with because i can get extremely stressed about the dumbest stuff. don't get my wrong, i have friends!! and i love all of them, but i feel like im missing one of those you can say everything to and not worry about what you say... at all!! i think my goal is to get an associates here and then try to transfer to an away school or something.. or maybe even just move out of the house. i love my family and all but 1. i am never home really 2. when i am i get yelled at for being a ""hermit"" and 3. i just want to be on my own and feel independent. 

Singing is so much FUN. apperantly i rocked on sunday. there was this one fun rock song and paul had turned up my mic really loud. everyone said i did good....but even if they were saying that just to be nice, i don't care because i had fun. i felt happy, genuinly happy. and proud of myself. i felt like i could accomplish anything that i wanted in that moment. it was awsome. i can't wait until i can sing again...

my dog is so cute and i love  him haha, his is looking at me like he is about to die of bordem as he lays on my couch all streched out and panting. what a spoiled baby he is. its my own fault though, i give him everything he wants usually because he is just so darn cute!

~ that is a good song, butt yeah
so i wanted to write about stuff. its so sad really being home. all the people im usta seeing are gone and off with their new life. and my sister is missing in action... at least in my life. im lonely. but i was talking to someone and they told me that is how my life is going to be because i have to make money and go to school. i can't expect to have a social life. 

sometimes its so hard beacuse my parents expect me to be and adult financialy and in my decision making that i don't want to mess up. im afraid that my life could be over after one decision. i stay up late at night stressing over stupid little things like that. and when i walk around campus i see all these beautiful rich girls who have no worries beyond which prada backpack will look best iwth their outfit in the morning, and i actually think why couldn't my life have turned out different. why must we all suffer because of the mistakes that our ancestors have made done the line.

he is beautiful.
i love him.
and the best thing of all
i think he loves me.

i went to bed listening to some 106.7 the drive. 
thursday, woke up around 7 and started on cleaning my room for all the ppl that would be getting ready in there. i took a shower and got myself all nice and clean for my hair and makeup appointments. i did my nails all nice and then my daddy showed up the the LIMO BUS yay haha i thought it was lots of amazingness. but then of course i got to clean it too haha. but it was definatly worth it. 
i left at about 11:30 to go to the bank and get a camara but my mom called because she got off work eary and she wante to go with me to my hair appoint.
so we go and i get my hair all beautifully done by the greatest godmother/aunt after. i loved it *smile*
then my mom dropped me off at the makeup and went to pick up the tull. i went in before Caitlin got there and the lady kept telling me i was beautiful i just needed to play up my looks a little more! she did such a gooooooood job haha i actually looked pretty damn decent if i do say so myself haha--- finally caitlin go tthere and she got all beautiful and then we raced to my house

"event","Okay so here i am writting because i never write in this thing... like ever. in my last entry i put a picture of my puppy who just happens to me the thing that i LOVE THE MOST in my life currently. i miss my dad alot tho. and i still have my music

so far to day lets seeeeeeee what happened.
i took part of a test in math that i have to go in early to finish AGAIN
then i went and took a quiz in first hour and i was surprised and how much i knew! lol i love that class tho. its definatly one of my favorites. that class is world religions and is taught by Mr.Hamka who rocks. i love that he takes it seriously and tries to make everything interesting which he does.
on i then went to AP ENGLISH we got da bagels yumm yumm tehe. and we got our assighnments for the East of Eden essay. i LOVED the play it was so amazing. iago was so sinfully amazing oh gosh. haha. if you had any idea what i was thinking while watching that play you would probably laugh at me.
from there it was creative writting. i wrote a poem. i took poetry to write poems. i want to write stories
then to A-PUSH- an always eventful class, and we had to listen to the poor poor girl cry and whine, ahh someone needs to teach her to shut up. me and lucais both have to make up a test in the class, and thanks to the greatest girl in the world i have something wounderful to study with.
after that,lunch where the world tried to hide from the serious amount of extortion (spelling?) well actually just 3 people, but it was fun anyway.
then astrology which i absolutley loveeeeeeee and i wanted to kick the ass of half the kids in that class for making Mr. rodger feel bad. i swear it looked like he was about to cry. i wanted to give him a hug, but it probably would have been wierd. why is it that people who think they are smart have to try and make the teacher look stupid when in fact they r the ones who are acting like a dumbass.
oh and the never ending hell of math
missed art club
went to work
burned 440 calories
5lb must be lost by friday........... duh duh duh
oh and plans have been changed due to a mother in a rage... this should be interesting to see what trouble i get in b/c of this one.




<edit>

well i deffinatly managed to make someone cry and now i feel horrible. and i think that im gunna cry now for what happend... but what am i supposed to do about it? im only one person who seems to be slipping away from the person who i want to be in my life. i feel like shit and ican't figure out what to do. so i think i just lost my best friend and it hurts so bad. damn im defintaly crying now... im gunna go see if she will tlak to me"

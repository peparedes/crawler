"event","Hmm.. so last night was one of the most interesting nights in tally i have ever had.
it started off like the usual.
pregaming at ashley s.'s dorm. 
all of us getting ready and taking shots at the same time. (makeup comes out a tad messy)
and then we start to head out to the night nole (or the drunk express).
as were walking down the trail..ashley desides that she wants to gracefully fall into a bush.
and she did..
end result: a very cut up entire left side of her body.
sure she looked fabulous before...but blood and black pumps just dont mix.
me being the most sober had to help her clean up..so abere grabbed her fluffy cell phone case and played doctor for a while.
the only words coming out of ashleys mouth where: ""im fine i swear, lets go party.""
what a trooper she is.

well after this whole process, we finally got to floyds and got off the bus.
me completely not noticing the fact that my cellphone sneakly slipped out of my back pocket.
i realised the second i went to pay that my life had been left on the bus.
but i was enibriated so it all didnt really matter to me...at the time.
we finally got into the club..but the second we stepped on the dance floor we all lost one another. 
i found abere in the bathroom...
but ashley, kait, and ellie were no where to be found.
so me and abere went on and found our friends shane,matt, and david hanging out by the bar.
ordering huge mugs of rum and coke (i think)
being a drunk. i grabbed one and ran. well more like grabbed on and attempted to run.
they didnt mind of course, cause they just ordered another one.
so me and abere drink in hand headed out to the dance floor and found ellie in the corner looking for all of us. 
well we start dancing..and i spot the cut guy from my chem lab class..
so i go and dance with him.
he was actually a very good dancer..but because i was extremely worried about where the rest of the girls were..our dance session only consisted of fergie's fergilicious..
anyways.
we found kait..and she told us that ashley had gotten kicked out of floyds because she was still bleeding.
so we ran outside and headed back to the bus.
the second i go into my back pocket to make sure i had everything that i needed.
it turns out i lost my wallet.
ohh yeah. double wammy.
so the bus let us off at our dorms and i rushed up stairs praying that the roomy wasnt asleep.
it turns out that the girl that had found my phone contacted my mom who later contacted my friend so that she can give me back the cell phone.
and the girl who found my wallet is dani solanos sister.
what a fucking small world.

but i didnt know this until the next day.so i went and cancelled all of my cards..got new ids..and got a new fone.

but the moral of the story is..

there are nice people out there...
and not everyone is out to get you.

Thursday:
It was about 11:30 at night when i finally left tallahassee.
I was already nervous about the weekend.
I had been looking forward to this weekend since last month when I went up to Horror Nights with the girls and Melissa gave me the ticket. 
I finally got to Orlando @ around 3:45.
I walk into her dorm room to find Christina Rushman (We have to say her last name. it just flows.)
on the bathroom floor. Someone had partied too hard that night and he threw up all over Melissa's bed.
This was perfectly ok, because we just put her to bed, and took this laundry room moment to catch up.
I had missed Melissa soo much, after spending the whole summer with her, having to seperate for college was very difficult. Her, Elis and I were inseperable since Senior Year when we ran everything as Senior Board. 
Well, me and Melissa discussed everything. My change in major, her love life, and my potentials.
Things had changed. We had grown up. And well, it felt great!
We went to bed that night/morning @ 6:00 a.m.

Friday:
We woke up @ 4:00... just in time to go pick up Elis from Turkey Lake Plaza.(the infamous plaza where i almost killed me and melissa during our 2 week long road trip to FSU, UF, and UCF, and where i always get dropped off when i go visit melissa..lets just say that service plaza holds many memories)
We picked her up, and it felt like home again. The 3 musketeers where reunited.
We got back to Melissa's dorm, and we decided to cook spring rolls. We all cooked...We all cleaned. 
And the rolls where delicious.
Then the party really began. Melissa had bought a bottle of parrot bay, and we started taking shots as we started getting ready to go to Club Paris. (paris hiltons club in orlando) 
We all looked fabulous, and we dressed to impress. 
That evening we took the best pictures ever.
We went to club paris..really buzzed, and excited after an awesome sing-along car ride.
There werent many people there at first...but by 12:00 the club was packed, and i was already dancing ontop of the stages. I had a blast.
@ 2:00 a.m. we headed back home.
Then, we went to melissas room, and me and elis contemplated her love life.
We didnt go to bed until 6:00 again..but it was awesome. I felt reconnected.


Saturday: 
We woke up @ 2:30. Elis was the last one up..even though she swore up and down that she couldnt sleep til that late.
We ate cereal, and watched laguna beach..and wondered ""how many times each girl can say like in one sentence."" 
We then got ready to go to the concert.
We got to the convocation center @ 5:00..since it was right behind melissas dorm room.
The line was not as long as we thought..but we were at the end so that wasnt great.
After waiting 2 hours. we weere finally let in and we took a seat infront of some of the cutest boys i have ever seen.
The show begins:
Brand new walks on stage..and the crowd goes insane.
I love brand new and they performed amazing.
We have blob pictures of them...just because the set was soo colorful.
They didnt play any of their popular stuff..but the show was still amazing.
20 minute break.
They are setting up for Dashboard..and I was anxious.
But it all paid off when the set was finally revealed.
it was beautiful.( it looked like a big window with naked tears outside. many chinesse lanterns were around the stage..and it felt soo indie)
Chris came on stage and my heart stopped.
He is an amazing performer. and drew the crowd in instantneously.
The played a couple of new songs..but the majority of them were from their unplugged CD that i over played.
I was soo into the music that i couldnt help but belt every word to every song out.
Everyone around me wanted to kill me.
After about 7 or 8 songs. they said good bye.and i was dissappointed.
No hands down.
Then to my astonishment they came back.
and followed up with Vindicated and finally. Hands Down.
I started to cry. The song held so many memories...my solo.. my adolensence..my love life.
Me and Elis were so overwhelmed we climbed onto the chairs, and because we were so elevated above the crowd, chris pointed at me and elis 3 TIMES! and sang along with us. It was magical.
After the concert. We ran outside to the barracades where brand new was signed shoes and tickets.
They left right before they got to us, but out walks Mike..the drummer from dashboard.
I ran to greet him, since many people where pushed away. BUT! HE SIGNED MY SHOE.
then the security started kicking us out..but us and couple of other brand new fans..stood outside their bus and sang SOCCO AMARETTO LIME. Not only does that song hold soo many senior year memories..but it was our anthem. Me, melissa and elis were alittle smarter about it. we walked to the front of the bus, to where our surprise. Jesse the lead singer was holding his ear up to the window watching us serenade them.
It was incredible. He had a huge smile on his face..and u could tell he was impressed.
Finally, we got run down by a big black security guard. but as devoted as we are, we waited 2 hours after the show in the mud to see if we could catcha glimpse of chris.We made up songs..and even had a master plan of attack if we were to meet chris. we dared to dream.
But instead, we met 2 boys that were also forming a band. AND! mike..the drummer..climbed the barracades and came out to talk to us. 15 minute convo..he is such a nice guy.(and extremely good looking)

and then..after 2 and a half hours. we retreated to the dorm room, where we had nachos, and went to bed.


sunday:
we wokeup early and said our good byes.
it was one of the saddest moments ever.
and now i am here documenting every second of my unforgetable weekend.

last words:

    ""you're just jealous cause were young and in love..."""

"event","Yup, I got wasted last night lol.  I went out with my brother and 2 of our friends. We didn't know where we could go to drink first since me and the two other girls, Jessica and Monica, are 19. My brother is 24. Then i remembered about El Patio...a mexican restaurant where i'm tight with a couple of the waiters and the mariachis or how ever you spell it. The place is famous for its blue margaritas that are strong as fuck. I had half a beer b4 we got there..there i had 2 blue margs...then we went to Jefe Bar..I had 2 coke/vodka...and then a long island iced tea. So knowing me..i'm a light weight..i was goneee last night lol. I remember dancing with the guy and I think i made out with him how embarassing though cus my brother was there but I was drunkkk so thats my excuse. I think his name is carl cus i checked my phone and thats the only name I don't recognize...i had lots of fun tho..considering we went to Jefe bar it was 18+and it wasn't that ghetto surprisingly lol. But of course I ended the night in the restroom...i think i puked but I don't remember illhave to ask jessica later...i kind of remember seeing another girl in the stall with us giving me water hahah im not sure..oh and this morning my brother told me he had to carry me from the car in the garage into the house upstairs and in my room lol he said i was heavy :( he also told me that when i was dancing wtih the guy he pinched me really hard LOL so protective hahah. He also said when we got home my mom was asleep on the couch and i think i was upstairs already but he wanted to hook up with monica and he kept telling my mom 'don't cock block me mom don't cock block' LMAO but thats pretty much the night...i woek up this morning with all my clothes on lol it was fun. ohhh and i'll post pictures later"

"event","So thursday michelle came to pick me up from my house we went out to the mall bought a dress then went to her house and since she can't drive at night she told her mom i was driving and i told my mom she was driving since i dont have a car but we had our friend Justin pick us up and we went back to his place....we called so many ppl to try and find somethign to do but we ended going to a club cause there were no parties going on....but yeah i had like 3 beers and then i had a glass of vodka and i was goneeee.  I can't rmember going to the club at all lol. according to michelle i got really sick and was puking soooooo much in the restroom and then i was like falling asleep so we left the club and she got in contact with one of my best friends who is like 27 and had her pick me up cus i was so sick. and i stayed at her house... pictures under the cut..

so i havn't talked to jared (boyfriend) since thursday when i called him to see if he go out that night with us..he couldn't...but yeah so friday on his facebook i wrote that i missed him and i went to his facebook page like a couple hours ago and its not there anymore...he deleted it...and his relationship status says single still...so obviously he did that cus he probably doesn't want any girls to know he has a girlfriend...he doesn't have a cell and i hate calling his house especiallly at night so i just sent him a message on facebook asking him what that was about we'll see what he responds...probaly some lame excuse so i will probably break up with him....my cousin knows him from high school that how we met so i asked my cousion what jared was like in high school...i asked if he was a player or w/e and my cousin said ""yeah...at least i heard ppl say he was..or is...and that he thinks he's the shit..ppl talked"" i'm just glad that i found this out early in the relationship before i got too invovled with him. but i'll see what he says first...

"event","So my sister was suppose to fly back from LA today. The plan was her arriving at 1:25 and then she was going to dialysis. She told my mom that her husband was going to pick her up. So around 4pm the dialysis place is calling saying my sister still hadn't arrived. So me and my mom call my sister tons of times and no answer. I call her husband and I ask if she's with him and he said that she's in LA and hasn't talked to her since Friday morning. So I hung up and that struck me odd. I did not want to panic yet but thoughts of the worse did start coming to mind. I know she's on bad terms with her husband so I just thought maybe he lied to me and did something to her. 

I went to the airline website to see if the plane arrived and it did at 1:25. I called the ppl she was staying with in LA and they said they dropped her off which meant she had to be here. She also had told my mom for her to pick her up at dialysis....I called her again a few times still no answer but then I get a text. 

This is what the msgs said:

Roxanne: Tell mom I'm here don't worry
Me: mom wants to talk to u
R: Later
Me: Where r u? she said it's urgent
R: What's Urgent?
Me: mom is gna have an anxity attack if u don't call
R: Damn ill call later what's the big deal. I'm not a little girl.
Me: where's amy [her 2 year old daughter which she left with her sister in law]
R: With Me Bye
Me: What about Denise [her 11 year old daughter who stayed in LA a few more days]
R: LA
Me: Where the hell r u?
Me: Mom is going to have a heart attack if you don't call right now

So I told my mom to lets drive to Roxanne's sister in laws house to see if Amy was there or not. I found it strange my sister was not calling and the way she was writing in the texts didnt seem like her. And so I was still pretty calm the whole drive there my mom was crying though and very uneasy but I did not want to get worked up for nothing. When I got to the sister in law's house I rang the doorbell and then her sister in law opend up and then I saw Amy. I lost it. 

I was crying uncontrollably. I couldn't stop shaking. My mom couldn't stop either. I had dropped to the floor. I just imagined the worst had happened. I couldn't belive this was happening. I just couldn't. I did my best to explain to roxanne's s-i-l what was going on and she was on the verge of tears. When I did my best to calm down I called 911 and reported her missing. All they said they could do was put it in the database. 

When I hung up with the police I went outside to where my mom was. She was on the phone talking to my uncle. And then I called my brother and told him Amy was here with us and he rushed over.  My mascara was smudged all over my face from all the crying. I just really couldn't belive it. And then seeing Amy broke me too. Shes so innocent doesn't have a clue what's going on. 

This went on for about two hours and then Denise called saying that Roxanne had called her saying she was fine. 

So me and my brother tried calling again and she still did not answer. About an hour later she finally called my brother and then she called my mom. She didn't tell us where she was but she said she was fine and that she would come to the house in the morning. 

It was really fucked up that she did that. I love my sister to death. And I really don't know what she was thinking but it's the worse feeling in the world thinking you've lost your sister forever like that. 

And I hated to see my mom the way she was today. She seriously almost had a panic attack. And I'm just glad I know my sister is okay."

I started Tuesday went to go buy food for the restaurnsts but yesterday and today have been so exhausting. yesterday i woke up at 530am to drop off my mom at the airport and then i had to go buy for the restaurnat and take money from one restaurnant to the other. then around 930ish i left to go get an employee from the restaruant that is like an hour away from my house and take her home and had to wake up this morning at 7am to pick her up and take her to tha restarant. then i had to go to Sam's to buy stuff for the restaruant like to go boxes and and napkins that kind of stuff. Then went to go buy food and cheese and a bunch of shit. and my head is hurting now. i didn't think that it was this bad to run the restaurnat but i totally appreciate my brothre more and dislike my dad more. dumping all this on my brother while my dad jus goes get drunk all day. not cool.<br /><br />lets see what else..oh yeah my fuckin migraines suck. last week i got one on friday afternoon then i got one saturday night an dmonday i owke up with a small headache and nauseous and monday mornig at 530am i got another migrain. the pain is unbearable. the throbbing is horrible. i seriiosuly want to jus like cut my head off when i get them. it suckssss. the one i ggot last friday made me throw up 6 times! heh i felt thin that day LOL but yeah my mom called my neurologist and he said she coudl take me in for some treatment.&nbsp;It was my first time i had an iv. they put it in the vein on the top of my hand and when the nurse like poked me w/ the needle i could nto stop bleeding lol. i got more nauseous looking at it. first they gave me an anti inflammatory medince and made me super nauseus and did calm my headache a little but nto all the way and so then they gavae me another one caled Depacon i think and its usually for those with Epplipsy but it worked on my headache.&nbsp;<br /><br />i would hate to have an iv in my all the time. i totally feel more for my sister now. since she has Lupus which has caused her kidneys to fail so she has to go to dialysis 3 times a week and its even worse then what i had of course. one little iv in my hand compared to what she has in her chest and her arm. i really hope she can get a transplant soon. she doesnt deserve this...<br /><br />well time to watch Ghost whisperer finale....."

"event","What have I been up to? It has been like months since I've really written something so let me tell you! First, I have a new header....Lets see my class schedule included History, Political Science, Media&Society, and Communication Theory.  I dropped PoliSci because it is just not the class for me and anyway I'm most likely transferring to the Art Institute for Video and Digital Filmmaking so I won't need a credit for PoliSci anyway. But yes if i go to the art institute I will have my bachlors in 3 years. 

Lets see my best friend moved back home from Mississippi so I've really been hanging out with her on weekends and going to the beach. OUr first weekend at the beach we met a bunch of ppl so we've become friends with them and hang out w/ them all the time. It's funny because one of the guys we met is in my history class lol. 

So basically just been going to school, drinking, partying, going to the beach and having fun. This weekend I'm going to Wilmington for the Charity Game so that should be fun huh. I don't know why I am not more excited lol. 

So music wise I've been on a Blue October phase. I cannot stop listening to their music. The lyrics are so poweful and its the only band that I feel really and truly write from the soul and not just the heart. Their live performances are beyond amazing. No doubt best concert you will ever go to. ""Let It Go"", ""18th Floor Balcony"", ""Black Orchid"", ""For my Brother"" are just a few of the most amazing songs they have. 'Black Orchid' is truly sad. Its a confession to his mother at the age of 14 he wanted to commit suicide. If you download it get the live version. It's more powerful. 

This past weekend...lets see Natalie called me at like 3 in the morning to see if i wanted to go to the beach for the day and I agreed. So woke up at like 9am and then got ready and then headed over to her house and we headed to the beach. Then this car with like 5 guys in it started liek waving at us and wanted our number. 2 of them were cute so we decided to give them my number. It was hilarious because we're on the freeway and I have my hands out the window and trying to give them my number by showing them with my figners but then they get cut off and like 2 mins later they catch up to us and they have a little paper in their hand and he extends his arm out the window and they start getting closer to Natalie's car and my hand is out the window trying to reach it and then my hair is blwing in my face it was just too funny. So we called them and they seemed chill but we didn't hang out with them lol. 

Then we got to the resort which was beautiful. Their was a bar like in the pool and it was such a pretty day. So we laid on the chairs for awhile getting a tan and then decided to get in the water because it was so fuckin hot we were sweating. Oh, and a few of Natalie's friends she met last week came as well. They were over 21 so they were able to by us drinks. It really sucks not to be 21 lol. But yeah we started drinking around 2pm hahah and so we had Pina Coladas and Margaritas. I had frozen and on the rocks both were good. Then the guys left and this other guy we had met at the pool bought us another drink and after that drink is pretty much when I was pretty wasted. I do not remember getting out of the pool and walking to Nat's car or anything lol. 

We ended up going to the convient store it around 7 to see if we could buy beer. I barely remember this but Natalie said I went inside asked the clerk if he'd let me buy beer and he was like I need to see ID and then I walekd out lol. So then we went to a restaurant and Natalie said she told me to go to the restroom and she'd order the food. She said I was taking so long so she came in to see what was up with me and I was passed out  in the stall on the floor. LOL so then she got me up and we walked out and she said they wouldnt let her buy beer but like the beer was outside in the open like on ice and so as we're passing it and she tells me to grab two beers. I stick my hand in grab two beers and continue walking lol. Playing it off cool. And there were lots of ppl there too lol. So we get to the table we sit in the corner kind of by the kitchen and she said I knocked over the chair lol so I figured that's why my ankle hurts now. Anyway I didn't eat that whole day. The last time I ate was Friday arond 5ish and it was 730 at this time and she said I didn't really eat the food so yeah I was pretty much just on alcohol. There were some shelves that had a case of beer nxt to us and she told me to grab them and I don't protest at all she said I got up grabbed them and then gave them to her to put in her purse. So I stole 6 beers LOL. 

So we're leaving and theres like 10 stiars i have to go down and so Nat said that when I saw the stairs I said, ""OMG look at this huge mountain!"" And then she drove to her condo. I don't remember that car ride at all. I jus remember sort of seeing those stairs and then we're parked outside her condo. So we're like sitting there in her car talking about what we should do next cus the guys from earlier at the pool wanted to hang out and I dont really remember much its all a blur to me. But then the song Bleeding Love came on. And we're like obessessed with that song. And we blast it up and we're singing and stuff. Who knows if anyone saw us LOL. and some other stuff happened that Lena knows about lol that I won't bother talking about. And then we went upstiars to her condo. I dont remmeber much just that I didn't like the beer we were drinking lol. I think it was called Shiner. and I only like Corona and Bud Light. 

The rest of the night is really a blur. I jus remember Natalie going into the restroom locking the door and putting on the shower but then taking it off. I didn't tink anything of it and I'm watching TV but like 10 mins later I realize she's been pretty quiet so I peek through the like frosted window on the door and shes' fuckin passed out on the floor lol so I get the door open with this other key and I'm liek trying to get her up off the floor and finally she wakes up and gets up herself and then walks to the bedroom so I figured we were going to sleep and I turn off the TV and she gets pissy and is like turn on the TV and shes like bitching at me to put my PJs on whcih I didn't bring b/c I thought we were going for the day but since we're both to drunk to drive we didnt go back. We ended up falling alseep on the couch and around 430am I wake up and we're like both in the most uncomfortable position and the TV is a commerical for Penis enlargerment pills LOl I decided to go to the bed in the room and let her lie down on the couch. But the whole day I was so nauseous. Like really sick and it lasted until today around 2ish. I didn't know hangovers could last so long...but all in all it was a great weekend.

I also saw Forgetting Sarah Marshal. That movie is fucking Hilarious I recommend it. 

Soooo behind the cut you can see pictures from the past few months of what I've been up to. I'd post videos too but those are too embarassing lol. Only Lena has seen them lol. Me drunk... haha 

PS: family wise -- it sucks. mY dad's an ass and my mom is too needy...financially my dad really fucked us over. Lets hope once my parent's divorced is finalized our trouble will be over.

"event","Yes. I got the best news. This past summer when me and Jasimine opened up www.gossipgirlonline.net we also made a myspace for it.  Not too long after having signed up for the myspace account Jeff who wrote and directed the movie, Inside, messaged me.  He told me that Leighton Meester who plays Blair Waldorf is in the movie. Anyway we msged about the movie and stuff and we're on each others top friends.

anyway since I'm majoring in communications - Media production to be specific I messaged him to see if he had any internships or any jobs or what ever that I could proably be a part of and he got back to me tonight. He told me first off that Inside will be open everywhere on Februrary 26, 2008. and that he might be working on a new feature this upcoming summer and that he might be able to hook me up with something and if he can't that he could probably find something else in Cali for me to do. He just wanted to know specifically what I wanted to know more about. So i have my fingers cross so hopefully I get a chance to do something.

"event","the concert was amazing!! OMG she was awesome. That had to be one of my favorite concerts and I've been to alot. It was so intimate just really very personal. She is so adorable and sweeet. And if i had to describe her in one word i'd say REAL. She is jus really very real.

She gets so into her songs and I love that. When she sang 'Nothing That You Are' you could feel the anger in her voice. She just let it out. She would even like stomp her foot numerous times. She got so angry that She even walked backstage for a moment (i got that piece on video by accident lol)

Also, when she sang Gardenia towards the end of the song you could tell she was starting to tear up. You could tell in her face and then she turned around and walked towards where the drums were set up and I'm pretty sure it was so we didn't see her probably wipe her tears away. (I got the whole song on video)

Then she also sang umbrella by Rhianna. I liked Mandy's version better. ( i got a small bit of that on video) andd she also sang this funny song along w/ her band it was soomething they made up I think i got some of that on video too. And her final song she sang was CANDY!  she was like how it has no meaning and how she didn't know what the song meant when she was 15 and she still doesnt know what it means but she was like I'll sing it anyway. Then she was like but I'll never sing In my Pocket  ( i got a small bit of candy as well on video) then she said her good bye and went off stage and then the like stage helper guy was starting to clean up and the whole crowd kept yelling Mandy! over and over again and she finally came out and she was like I don't usually do this, my voice is shot but we'll play one more song for you. 

But yeah I'm happy that I decided to go to her concert. I respect her alot more now. Oh and also her mom and I think a couple of her friends were there too cause she would dedicate songs to them.

i'll add the video and pics in another post cus i havent uploaded them to anywhere yet. 

and now college. Ive been going to UH for the past 2 weeks. Its not as bad as i thought it was going to be. I have one class on tuesday, thursday, friday, and saturday and 2 classes on monday and wedsnesday. and i dont have to wake up early during the week cus my class either staerts at 10 or 12. but saturday is the worse cus i have history from 9-12. but my teacher is pretty cool so it makes it a little better. Hes pretty hilarious. I haven't really made any friends yet. so that kind of sucks but thats okay. My friend Natalie came from college b/c she was so homesick so its nice to have a friend back here and we both want to transfer to UTSA next semester. and we'll get an apartment so that'd be pretty cool. Anyway expect another post soon with pics from mandy moore aand video. and also i'lll post some pics of me and my friends last night together b4 they left to college."

"event","Well I had a blast last night with my best friend Melinda. We were kind of bummed that no one else could go because most of our friends are out of town but we still had a bunch of fun. Pictures under the cut. (Also added random photos of me and me and of my niece who recently turned 2) Anyway I was late to Melinda's house because I stopped by one of my parent's restaurants to meet up with a friend. We had some beef early in the year, my fault, but we've moved on. She was like a sister to me and I fucked that up but she forgave me. I also saw her sister who just came to town to live. She lived in El salvador but she's going to college here. Anyway we were catching up on things for like 2 hours. So then I finally went to Melinda's got there at like 945 got ready fast and then we were off to the club, Rich's. We stopped by for Cigs first tho, Camel 9, if you havn't tried them you should they are so good. I don't smoke but I tried it and I have to admit they were good. I got so trashed lol I can barely remember the night. Melinda told me I was dancing with Ugly guys and she would pull me away from them and when she would look away i'd go back to them hahah. Anyway I had a shot of 151 and 4 vodka's with diet coke and then one other drink. So Yeah I can't really remember much. On the way home I called Jack. :) He lives in Arizona I havn't seen him in 2 years but I know he's the one. I can feel it. WE talk alot and stuff and I always drunk call him. I don't remember what I said to him but he messaged me on FaceBook today and said that he knows I was drunk and doesnt know if what i said was true but that he misses me alot and that if I lived in AZ he would drop everything for me. He said he doesn't know if what he feels is True Love but that he'd like to find out. He is so sweet. Anyway after we hung up I started feeling nauseous, well thats what Melinda told me so I started puking out the window and she said it got all over my arm. SO GROSS! But yeah then we finally got to her house and I dont remember much I think i washed my arm and threw up a little more and went to sleep in my clothes lol. 

Today I went to eat lunch with my mom at PF Chang's and then went to see Rush Hour 3. I thought it was pretty funny. Definetly had some good laughing moments. Then I came home and I got my information packet for LA film school. I love everything it had to say. I really want to go there. Then I went to drop off my niece at my grandma's house because that's where my sister was. Then I went to my uncle's house, he's out of town so I went with my cousin to feed the dog, who recently had puppies. So adorable!! Then I came home to watch SON premiere. It was awesome!!! I don't mind Ashley and Spencer but I'm still all for Aiden and Ashley. It looks like its clear that Ash is hung up on Spencer though. Damn their make out scene lasted so long hahaha. But Aiden and Ashley's kiss was damn good too. 

OH yeah I finally got my new naval ring. I lost the screw from the one I had before but finally went to the mall and got a new one. I posted a picture.

Anyway, I'm done. So now you can see pictures.

"event","Okay this is a long post but I think it could be a good read lol and I'd really like to see what people think. 

I've been getting these strange feelings lately as if someone is in my house who isn't suppose to.  Sort of like a spirit. Yeah I know many people don't think stuff like that is true or what ever but I believe it.  I think it's my half sister's father. He died almost 3 years ago unexpectedly and ever since every thing went downhill from there. 

I never knew anything about him until after his death.  He lived in California and I live in Texas. I had never met him in my life. My mom did attend his funeral.  She would talk to him from time to time on the phone and he would always say that she was the love of his life and that he wanted to be with etc. He would even cry but my mom always said no.  Because of couerse she was with my dad.  He was angry because she had left him.  

He was making plans to move out here to Texas with his girlfriend or wife I don't really know what she was. Of course to be closer to my mom even if she wasn't going to give him a chance. The reason my mom left him was because he was an alcoholic and I believe he got physical at one point.  Anyway when my mom returned to Texas after the funeral weird things started happening to her.

We have a two story house and my house is right above my mom's. I was in the dining room and my neice was in the living room. My mom was in her room and no one else was home but us. She was on her bed watching TV when she heard this loud liek bang come from my room...from my floor. She left her room and saw that we were both downstairs and we didn't hear a thing so she went upstairs to check out my room. At the time I had kept a small candle in a small vase like thing. No taller than 3 or 4 inches. My TV is at a corner of my room and the candle, inside the vase was in the center of the room. How did it get there? The candle was not at the edge of the TV or anything and we tried ourselves many times knocking it off ourselves to see how far it would go from the TV and it didnt go at all as far as my mom had found it. 

Next thing that happend to her was again when she was again in her room on her bed. She had just showered and did everything you do before getting into bed liek brush her teeth dry her hair etc. SHe then hears her razors fall to the floor of the shower. It wasnt as if they fell at the same time though it was one razor and when it hit the floor the next one fell. I feel that these 2 occurances happened to her to get her attention for some reason but I honestly dont know.

Last thing that happend was when she was on the couch in the living room. She was at that point where you're half asleep but half awake and she felt like a wind or breeze go over her and she said she saw the face of my sister's father in front of her disappear. 

Ever since then my dad and mom began to fight and it's when my mom found out about my dad cheating on her for the 3rd time.  But it felt diffrent this time she said like worse. It's been over a year and she still cries for my dad and they are always arguing. She gets like hystrical at one point she had like a nervous breakdown.  Not only that but also ever since then financialy we are like fucked. We have so much to be paid and not enough money for it. 

Those occurances happend nearly 3 years ago and the money problems as well as my parents' problems have been happening since then as well. 

Recently I have been seeing or feeling things. Getting odd vibes.  First thing that happend was about 2 or 3 weeks ago. I was home alone the sun was barely setting and I was downstairs in the living room. The shutters from the windows were all open and I was on the couch. I was watching TV and from the corner of my eye I felt I saw someone walking on the back porch so I turned my head and I swear I saw a man in a faded blue shirt with white print walk across. I couldnt see anymore because the window ends and a wall begins in my hosue for a moment I thought it was my housekeeper but when I didn't see anyone at the window from the door I knew I had seen a ghost or spirit. 

A few days later I'm upstairs on the couch in the game room. From there I can see the stairs, backdoor, and a little of the begining of the living room. I was with my cousin and like i said I was on the couch with him and we were watching TV the lights were off and then we see a flash from the corner of our eyes coming from downstairs. It looked as if it was coming from the living room to the window. Not window into the living room. So I know it wasn't lightning. 

This past Sunday I went to my sister's dad's sister's house. I went with my two younger niece's (my sister's daughters) and with my mom. We talked to my sister's cousin and she recently had a baby. She said a week before the baby was born that she had a dream with her uncle (my sister's dad) She said that it felt so real and that he hugged her around her stomach and when she woke up she said that she actually felt it.  SHe then said that he was wearing a hawaiian shirt like he always does. Which made me think back when i saw what I saw in my backyard. The white print had to have been hawaiian flowers. 

My sister's aunt later on put a video that had my sister's dad in it. It was a Christmas video from 2000.  He was drinking and then started saying how life changes and how he loves someone but she lives in Texas. 

The following day my sister and niece were over at my house. I started researching more about spirits and spirit attachments so then I bought a book called Heaven and Earth by James Van Praagh. It says ""[...]range in color from white, yellow, and oragne to blue or even violet. The colors may change upon observation and the lights will flash quickly in the atmosphere.""  Exactly what me and my cousin saw. As i was reading the book I was in the gameroom on the couch. My 2 year old niece had joined me she was sitting next to me and I had bought her a kid book for her to look at. So as I'm reading I start to hear her like moan a little but I didn't pay attention to it I just continued to read but she kept doing it so I look over at her and she's staring up at the wall to the left of us. I look over and didn't see a thing. I look back at her and she looks scared so I look at the wall again and I point and i'm like ""right here?"" and she shakes her head no and points more to the right. I ask her what is he saying and she cotinues to look scared and then started to say ""mommy, mommy"" and then she took my hand and took me to my sister. 

I've heard numerous times that kids can see spirits as well as dogs. My dog has constantly stayed frozen and starred up the stairs when I look I dont see a thing.  

I also read that a house that has had many arguments and fights has alot of negative energy.  FOr years and years there have been fights in this house. Pretty bad ones. My parents fought all the time here and still do sometimes  when my dad needs to come here to get something for work.  There's been a time where he kicked the door of the bedroom and cracked it. My brother has punched two holes in the walls. THis house just doesn't feel right. 

Oh yeah I also read what the symptons were of a Spirit Attachment and my mom has had many of those symptoms. One in particular caught my attention. It said that the person with the attachment will either feel the symptons of the illness of teh deceased person or have certain traits.  My mom is acting the exact same way with my dad the way my sister's father acted with my mom. Does he want her to feel how he felt?

I hope you guys don't think I'm crazy lol. But all this just freaks me out a little and I don't know just want to know what you think..."

"event","UGH I'm so Pissed that I have no more money. My Cousin stayed for me for a week because he like hates his dad and doesn't like to stay with him and his mom lives in California so it's not like he can stay with her but anyway his dad didn't give him any money so I had to buy his food when we  would go eat and then we went to Schilleterbahn and I thought his dad gave him money but he didn't so I had to pay for his ticket so now i'm completely broke. I do have $233 from my vending machine  but I have to buy more snacks using that money. 

Also, I think I changed my mind about going to Ole Miss for college.  My brother actually convinced me but I still need to talk to my mom about it.  My brother said that I could live in his house since he is most likely moving to El Salvador. He is going to start a Bar/Club over there meaning I can take over his house. But he said I'm going to have to pay the bills of course. Which I think I can handle once I get a job.  Beacuse with that plus my vending machine and I'm going to have to arcade game machines as well which make good money I think I'll be set.  But yeah  I hope its not to late to sign up for classes at the university I plan on going here. And I guess I have to let Ole Miss I'm not going too LOL Duh. And I think it'll be better that way anyway since I didn't get approved for finacial aid and my parents didnt really want me going so far. 

And So I went to Randalls tonight, a grocery store, I was hungry and since my brother has no food what so ever in his house and I'm not even kidding he really doesnt. I went there to buy some california rolls and a diet coke. Anyway, when I was goign to pay this one employee guy said he'd check me out. BTW he was sooo adorably cute.  His name is Jordan and he was like making conversation with me how his days are so long.  He asked me if I had a long day and I said that I'd just been home all day and he said oh you had a chill day then I dont get one of those till like Wednsday.  I'm definitely gonig to go back to Randalls tomorrow lol maybe he'll be working again.  He seemed to be into me and I didnt even have make up on LOL. But Yeah I havn't done much these past few days so I think tomorrow I should actually get my ass out of the house and do something. So I'm gong to Sam's to buy snacks for my vending machine and then go fill it up. 

Also, I just need 3 more episodes to watch of Sesaon 2 of Ghost Whisperer and I'm done. It's so good. I can't wait to see what happens. 

Right now i'm watching Legally Blonde. I love this movie"

"event","So Finally I have a chance to get back online. The past like 3 days I've had no internet access or any cable TV which equals like MY WORSE NIGHTMARE.  So I called the company to see what was wrong and all they said they didn't know so they'd send someone over. So I was like Okay cool and the the chick tells me not till Monday will they be able to send someone over. This made me sooo pissed. 

I spent the past few days watching Ghost Whisperer Season 1 and let me tell you that is such a great show. I absolutely loved it. Jennifer Love Hewitt is just pure love. She is so adorable at times on the show and she can act so well.  I so recommend it to everyone.  It can be so funny at times and still give you a scare but pretty much every episode will make you cry. Especially the finally and also ep 102. I just watched the first ep of the second season and I was crying so much lol. I'm currently downloading the rest. 

Anyway I was pretty scared tonight because I'm home alone in my brother's house (he's out of town) and I was watching I Still Know What you did Last Summer and even though i know what's going to happen I still get a little bit scared lol. I was getting some popcorn and I thought of that scene in Scream with Drew Barrymore and I felt like someone was going to call me to ask me what my favorite scary movie was LOL. Anyway after watching that was when i watched Ghost Whisperer 201 which was a tad bit eerie lol. I def got a little jumpy while watching that episode. Because I am alone in this house lol and it's like 3am and all. 

My brother definitely should do some grocery shopping."

"event","So it was a pretty relaxing day. I woke up at like 1 today and went to the garage to run on the tredmill but it was so hard because there were like at first 2 wasps and they totally freak me out I ran out of there as fast as I could so I told the housekeeper if she could kill them for me and she did so I went back to running and then all of sudden I see two more...just great... I ran out of there again and told the housekeeper and she killed those too. Finally i got to finish my running. Then I hit the punching bag for a while and did sit ups. It feels so good to work out lol. After that I went swimming in my pool for awhile. I was only there for like half an hour and i got darker Yay :). I showered and then had my lunch while watchiing Friends. The one with Rachel's going away party - makes me cry everytime. Especially when she's going to tell Chandler bye. so touching lol.  

I havn't read any magazines in a while so i decided to go to CVS and i bought Teen Vogue. I usually don't believe in those horoscopes but WoW did mine seem so true.  This is what it says: An ex will reappear on the scene arond the 12th; do your best to keep your cool.  Ignore that lingering temptation to let old emotions resurface - any changes in this guy's attitude are bound to be superficial.  Today is the 10th..the 12th is very close.  Yesterday i got a msg fro my ex, Jake. It was the weirdest thing cause I havn't talked to him since like forever.  It was nice to hear from him though.  He was just seeing how I was doing. He's out of town right now but he wants to hang out when I come back and I do too...so yeah I think i'm going to see him when he gets back. I wonder how that will go."

"event","<p>A lot has changed in the last three years.&nbsp; Pretty much everything has changed since I last posted.&nbsp; Jake and I broke up, my parents separated, I quit soccer, I graduated from high school,&nbsp;One Tree Hill became my obsession for a great while, I fell in love with music, my hair is dark brown...the list goes on and on.&nbsp; I've definetly matured. Do I have any regrets? Just one. Usually people answer this saying no because it's what made them who they are and that most likely would've been my answer but not anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm off to college in a little over a month.&nbsp; I'm mad excited to go but as the day comes closer I'm getting a bit more scared.&nbsp; I really want to get away from home to be away from problems that don't concern and to learn how to be independent.&nbsp; My whole life so far everything has come easy. I got what I wanted. Many people called me spoiled and I just really want to prove to everyone that I can do things on my own.&nbsp; That I don't always need my parents.&nbsp; I want to make something out of my life.<br /><br />My current obsession is the TV show South of Nowhere.&nbsp; God, I love it.&nbsp; I just love Ashley and Aiden together.&nbsp; I don't mind Ashley and Spencer they're really interesting to watch but Ash and Aiden are just love.&nbsp; The show comes back on August 10th and there have already been a few promos.&nbsp; They're so good and I can't wait for the new season.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, If you've read my previous entry you know I was a huge Gossip Girl fan.&nbsp; And I still am even a bigger fan.&nbsp; I finally&nbsp;finished the book series and a prequel is coming out in October.&nbsp; Also, they are making a show of Gossip Girl which I can't wait for.&nbsp; I am pretty happy with the cast.&nbsp; I'm not expecting it to be like the books and I'm hoping it won't.&nbsp; If it were then all of those who have read the books would be spoiled.&nbsp; The actors from what I can tell from the promos can portray the characters from the books really well.&nbsp; My favorite character is Blair and I totally love the actress who plays her, Leighton Meester. She's a terrific actress.&nbsp; My favorite couple is Blair and Nate but I would not be opposed to Blair and Dan.&nbsp; They are my fantasy couple.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I will start posting here again more frequently.&nbsp; I'm still trying to figure LJ out but I think I have the basics down. </p>"

homg *dies*

The first one... Tanner and I were sitting at my lunch table at school and we could see Reuben and he used secret sign language to ask her out and she said yes.

And I was like ""'lsdkhfdkas wtf""

Because Reuben is like my little brother and if anyone messes with him i'm like ""BACKDOWN BEFORE I KILL YOU"" but then they kept talking in the secret sign language and I was all like "";alfd stttttttooooooopppp""

Then my mom woke me up to give me my cell phone and tell me that she was leaving for work.

Alfshlf And then i had another dream

Everyone went out for the night and SHelby was staying at my house.

So we asked matt to come over
and my mom came home while he was still here so he hid in my closet?

and my mom was trying to clean my rtoom and she went to my closet and was like ""wtf pooltoy?"" and it was matt.

lol

and yeah my mom could here when i tried to open a window to let him out

so he couldn't leave until the next morning


it was gay"

"event","Soo..

I'm on the computer at my Gramma's in Zephyrhills.

Trailerpark<b>X</b>core.

XD

Yeah, so about my mom finding the pictures....

When she turned on my computer AIM automaticly signed on and Hunter IMed me.

And on my computer you can see your own buddy icon.

To make matters worse Hunter started saying I should take more pictures...of more of me...

And my mom was pissed.

So she picked me up from Shelby's house.

And she told my dad that I was mad at Shelby and wanted to come home.

I thought my dad had a heart attack so I was like ""UJGDKJGDKJ""

So I cried when she showed me what she had found.

She threatened to make me live in Canada with my dad.

I stfu.

I told her I didn't show the pictures to anyone.

But she still said she was mad because I did something so stupid.

I had a major headache by that time so I went to get something for it.

And she was like ""rarwfdsgf how many pills do you have?!?""

And I was like ""HOMG FUCKING CHILL I'M NOT GOING TO KILL MYSELF DUMBASS""

And I left.

I only had three pills anyways.

I'm downloading AIM on here and it's taking forever kthnx. 

I still have like a ton of math work to do.

AND I'm not eevn that mad about being grounded for a long time now.

BECAUSE...

Last night was like...

HOMG...

lol

I absolutly didn't think that's what I would be doing this weekend...

XD

lol

So now <u>Shelby && Matty</u> are my favourite people.

lol

and I'm sorry I kept fighting with Matty.

But he so started it!!

We never even finished our cake.

...

tehe.

I'm making this super long because AIM is taking unreasonnly long to download.

WTF @ it.

I don't think I'll be going to church for awhile.

But my mom is for deff a pushover so maybe.

I'm for sure not doing anything else this weekend.

Atleast I don't have to move tomorrow...

To Canada with my daddd that is.

I was like 'holyshitpissniggerheadhoefaceslutgangsterscenekidemofaggotfruitcupretardedface' when she said she woulld make me go.
 
Because there is no way I could leave everyone down here now.

And I'm not talking to Hunter for awhile...

Because he is the reason I'm in so much shit anyways.

Even though he didn't know.

But still... I didn't like knowing he said that anyways...

lhfsd

And AIM is at 81% at the moment.

Holy crap kthnx.

So I wish I would have atleats ate the cake icing last night...

Because now I really was some?

lol

All I had was a breadstick.

ROFL.

And I drove by Carrabba's today and threw up alittle.

...

:)

Matty made me fall down like 345643657546 times last night.

At one point him and Shelbii like...worked together on making me fall...

lol.

93% YES.

OMFG.

My back hurt sort of kind of.

And this gum that I'm chewing is like very hot.

And I like my pants that I'm wearing at the moment.

And my parents might by the old people trailer park that my gramma lives in?

WTF @ them.

AND HOMH AIM IS DONE YAY.

I'm going to go install it now.

kthnxbye<3"

I pierced my nose.

My dad might be leaving for Canada soon.

So I can sneak out easier.

Tell me if you want to hang out at midnight.

I miss kissing.

Kissing girls just isn't the same...

And thinking about that makes me sadish.

Oh, and Shelby the chips were called ""Munch<i>o</i>s"" not ""Munch<i>ie</i>s"".

Fgt.

K so I'm bored again.

Kirby isn't talking.

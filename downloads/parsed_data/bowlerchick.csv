"event","i feel more disappointed with myself this week than i think i ever have been. i just want things to be simple but life's proved once again to be so damned complicated. i just want to be happy. i just want to hang out with my friends. i have had so much fun this last week, kelsey is one of the most awesome girls i've hung out with in a long time, actually she's one of the most awesome people period. too bad she's gone to ghana now. oh well, i'm leaving for europe soon enough. i want that to be a good trip. 
while this last week has been a blast, it's been hell too. everything's so unsettled and i don't know how to settle it. god damn boys"

"event","ok, so last night sucked so so much. sometimes i just don't understand how people can go from being one person one minute to being a complete asshole for the next 14 hours straight. such is life sometimes i guess. thank goodness for dustin and kyle who could be there for me in what seemed at the time to be one of my darkest hours. good friends are hard to make at this point in life and i would like to think that i truely appreciate those that have. 
there was a highlight of the night though, at lucky lils i put a dollar in a video poker machine and was just playing one nickel at a time when i hit a royal flush. i'd never actually seen one of those and needless to say it was really cool. all of a sudden one nickel turned into 600 (30 bucks for those who don't feel like doing math) 
anyway, i'm not sure what i'm going to do with everything in my life right now. i'm really looking forward to going home next week to spend some time with my family and with a bunch of friends that i haven't seen in (literally) years. it will be good to have a break from kelly and work and having to pay for food. i love my parents kitchen, Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm. 
speaking of food, i'm getting pretty hungry... time to go track down some dinner"

"event","it's currently 59 degrees and the sun is shining and it's absolutely gorgeous! i love when the seasons change, it always makes me so happy. of course, i'm sitting in studio not out enjoying the beautiful weather yet but it just lifts your spirits to know that it's spring out there. i guess dustin and kelly went and rode around on their motorcycles so if that doesn't make it officially spring i don't know what does. i'm getting so excited for mandy to get here! i realized a lot the last few days about how much i miss her and how wonderful it is going to be when she gets here. i always knew i missed her and that i was excited for her to come back but now i guess i'm just even more excited. it's going to be the best summer ever! happy spring everyone! i'm making a bremix cd, i don't think i've made one for more than a year now but i decided this spring is going to need a soundtrack. any good suggestions will be seriously considered."

"event","so i just don't want to think anymore. i want to drink lots so that the most complicated thing i can think about is the difference between up and down. i keep finding my thoughts running away with me today. they keep making me wonder. i just want to have life be good how it is because i know that it is good how it is, sometimes it just doesn't feel like it. i don't know. i'm sure it's just some wierd thing going on in my head today. tomorrow it will be better. it's just strange how sometimes when things are all going ok you realize that you aren't as happy as you thought you would be when everything was going ok. school, friends, love life, family, it's all so complicated. why does life have to be that way?

really good lyrics
1:

Travelling swallowing Dramamine
Feeling spaced breathing out listerine
I'd said what I'd said that I'd tell ya
And that you'd killed the better part of me
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I'd said and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything
We kiss on the mouth but still cough down our sleeves

Travelling swallowing dramamine
Look at your face like you're killed in a dream
And you think you've figured out everything
I think I know my geography pretty damn well
You say what you need so you'll get more
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I said and you know what I mean
But I can't still focus on anything

2:
cause it hurts when you discover one's worse and one's better
to suffer or cause others to
and you can live by your conscience
now guilt is a concept
you're no longer subscribing to

there's a virgin in my bed
and she's taking off her dress
and I'm not sure what i am gonna do
there's a song stuck in my head
and i can't help singing it
oh how i hope my singing pleases you
cause i am not who i've become
but what you made me into"

"event","so i just talked to my friend andy. he's my best friend in the whole world, i've known him since i was 3 or something, we haven't lived in the same state since 2nd grade but every time i get to talk to him again it's like nothing's changed. it's good to know there's some people who will always be around no matter where you end up. it's sad when someone you always thought would be there for you isn't anymore and things just fall apart, it's happened to me and now i'm watching it happen to two people who both mean a lot to me and it really sucks; i wish there was something i could do to help them. the really shitty part is i think it's more kelly's (my boyfriend) fault and it makes me almost disappointed in him for not wanting to see the good in it more. in everything more. i guess it really scares me because a lot of the stuff he has a problem with dustin for is stuff that dustin and i have in common and it makes me wonder how long he is going to be able to go before he can't deal with me anymore and pushes me away and chooses only to see the bad and read into things the worst possible way. anyway, i think that's all i can say about that right now cuz if i talk about it anymore i'm going to get myself really worried"

"event","alright, i'm gonna give this live journal thing a try. i'm sitting in school and i'm supposed to be working but i'm just sitting and thinking and screwing around with this thing and listening to music instead. i got a really good quote from one of the kids over here in studio...
""life, i believe, is a gift
the meaning of life, is the choice to live it
anybody can live a life, and
anybody can destroy a life, but
to love the choice you've made to live, is the greatest gift of all""
-shoes
he said i could use it as long as i gave credit it to shoes, so there it is
i think that's enough for now"

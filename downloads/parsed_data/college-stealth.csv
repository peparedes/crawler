I just don't have time any more. Crazy, crazy. </p><p> Sometimes I wonder what I've been doing and where I'm going.  I'm getting pointless again.  </p><p> I'm in a relationship that's made me re-evaluate all my other relationships.  I'm starting to think that in the past whenever I've been with someone it's been purely based on lust.  This is the first time I find myself lying around next to someone who I respect, who's functional, who's strong, and entirely with it.  It actually almost intimidates me.  ..then it's made me depressed in thinking.. What was I thinking all of these other times if this is something that's so great, but feels nothing like them? </p>"

"event","</p> Three days and no smokes. I could kill a small child right now... but I won't. I went to the Health Center and asked 'em about quitting and they gave me free patches.  Oddly enough I'm committed to quitting, besides, I'd look like an ass if I started smoking in front of all of the R.A.'s again. They'd been on my case for so long, then I told 'em that I was going to quit. I did it for a reason..to discourage me from smoking. A big reason I wanted to quit is because I got myself getting more and more stressed and felt the anixety building up. It was mad crazy, the outward sign of that was me smoking. Yeah I know, it is a cold day in hell. </p><p> I'm back with that crazy girl down in Texas. I don't know what the hell was going through her mind. She calls me on a Tuesday and calls it quits, for all these various reasons.  Then I get a call a week later and we're back together. It's one of those random trust issues that makes me worry.  Of course I want to be with her! She's super, but then on the flip side, what was it that set her off when we were in town together? Humm, she's coming into Seattle in two weeks.  If she goes Psycho on me again then this shit isn't going to work out. I don't know, I've taken a lot of flack for being a bitch while I was in town, but that was only as a direct result of her acting TOTALLY weird... humm, one of those mysteries. </p><p> I worked out tonight. It felt really good. Granted I had to throw on a winter jacket and sweat pants as I was walking out of the gym with sweat pouring off of my body. Fucking snow flurries/sleet/rain, I don't know what the hell it is, but damn if it isn't cold! Burr! </P><P> Playing raquetball always clears my mind. It lets me let go of frustration and to let my mind wander.  It's just so mindless and routine that I let myself become lost in it and face some issues.  The random aspect was that mid-way through me playing I stood in the middle of the raquetball court realizing an amazing fact...here I am, alone with my thoughts..in a little white room, with padded white walls, and a little window that allows people to look in.  Yeah, where else do you hear about white rooms? </p><P> Fuck, I hear a fight below my window. Gotta break that shit up.</p>"

"event","<p> I feel like this evil person who only turns to my journal when things aren't going right. In reality I guess that's how things are supposed to be, right? But then again, who said that things aren't going right? Ugh...I can't read LJ from my office computer..which is two hundred times better than my home computer. I guess that would be the number one reason why I haven't said or done anything in my journal for such a long time. </p><p> I went home to Texas this weekend, only to return on Monday and have Bre breakup with me on Tuesday. Humm..oddly enough..well not oddly enough, I guess the sad part is that for once I care enough about someone that I'm afraid to lash out and hurt them as much as I usually feel like doing it, I just don't think that I'll get the same enjoyment. I've already vested to much time in building her self-esteem and it would make me for naught to take the time to rip it down, as justified as I would be, and as much as I have enjoyed it in the past, it would, I guess the right words would be: make me feel bad. </p><p> Stupid kid. Worst part is that it's a stupid kid that has a special place in my heart. She's too young for me, not right for me, but oddly enough to care so much about someone...humm, I guess I'm being human for once. That's an odd feeling. Worse yet is I hit the wrong button, turned her off of me for ever.  Other things like her making a mistake going back to the same friend....geesh, to much to go into.  Humm, I think that if I cared for in a relationship sense, like she HAD to be my lover type thing I'd be really upset.  .....but I care about her, as a little kid, friend, uh...person? Scary thought, me being nice to someone.  I guess me being this passive makes me wonder how much I wanted her as a girl friend...but I did, and i do....just to have her close...but I can't have that...but I want her as a friend and I can't do that, because it would hurt me. Humm.. </p><p> Maybe none of this is making any sense.  I don't want to be mean because I want this chick to come to me if she has any problems, I know, odd isn't it? Great, she's probably going to think that I'm psycho and ignore me for the rest of my life...and I don't think I want that. No, I just want to be friends....breaking up was for the best and I wanted it to happen, I can return back to my life and get things done and become the professional that I wanted to be and I am developing into, without having to worry about these phone conversation and these feelings.  I can put those down, that's something that I'm excited about, reclaiming my life...but I'm worried about this girl for so many reasons that extend beyond me.  Ugh, why do I have to care about a friend for the first time in my life?"

"event","<p> Wow, it's been a while. Here I am, sitting in a little apartment somewhere in Seattle, Wa.  It's amazing where life takes you sometimes.  Then, to TOP it all off I'm listening to Lucinda Williams...that would be the big shout out to Rachel...damn her.  She'd know which song, ""Lake Charles."" Speaking of Rachel, I need to e-mail her. </p><p> Maybe I'll do a stream of thought entry, one where you just let everything come out to you as you write. That would be from Mrs. Nelly in the sixth grade. Granted, if I do that then this entry would be pointless and I'd end up talking about a fly on a wall...due to Kelly P when I was a junior in high school. </p> But I digress.. </p><p> I've been so fucking busy. It's unreal. I still haven't started school and ultimately I've gotten to that point that I've forgotten that I was a student.  Well, that was until my teacher e-mailed me and the class telling us we had a book due the first day of class.  Wow, what am I doing here? How'd I end up in Seattle. Oh wait, I remember, it was my escape, my escape from everything that was that life somewhere in Texas.  </p><p> But here I sit...listening to Lucinda, thinking of home, thinking more so of New Orleans and friends that I've left somewhere over there.  Realizing that it would be pointless to go back and look for those friends because they've all gone their own ways.  I wonder if there will ever be a point where I settle down and say, ""There. This is life..here is life..here are my friends."" Instead I look to Texas, I look to New Orleans, and even in the little bit of time I've been in Seattle I've met some people that will hold a special place in my heart. </p><p> ..but these people in the NorthWest, they seem funny to me. I guess it'll take some time to adjust to them.  I saw my family for like a day, but I haven't had any time to see them again.  I lie awake in bed worrying that this is my life now, running from thing to thing.  Even more so oddly I've realized that the working world sucks. ...but what's even worse than that, I'm good at it.  I don't think that I'll ever be a real work, but an administrator, which is worse because it's all about delegatin, at what point where I assume the actual position myself? ..I mean do the actual work, I've realized that some people just fall into the role of supervisor/admistrator so naturally, it's something I don't want, but it feels good, it feels right, but...I don't know if I like it.  I'm determined to be a High School history teacher now. </p><p> Then, to top it all off, fucking have to go and fall head over heels for this girl somewhere in Texas, not even a day before I leave for Seattle..but instead a fucking night before.  ...and here I am, talking to her every night on the phone wishing that I was with her, around her, near her, or at least a funcational part in her life.  I sometimes wonder why I fuck myself over like that.  Sure, there was that moment of realistic expecations and she just told me it wouldn't work.  The worst part is that I believed her and agreeded with her.  It was the realistic me..the part of me that ALWAYS comes out and jumps to the forefront.  Yet, we're back at that orginal point..and it's odd.  For once I'm hoping, hoping for something, more so someone.  It's a distraction from work, a link to something grander in life, and well..it's nice.  It's nice to realize that there's something outside of research and outside of sitting there as a counselor to those students.... it's realizing that there's a part of me that wants to reach out on a more personal level.  Humm..it's so much easier to give that advice to so many others and not expect it for myself. Odd...I'm flying home in Oct.  I guess that'll be that point where you look at that person and remember them..and have that come to Jesus moment when you ask yourself where things are going. ...and I can only hope for the best.  It's one of those situations where I know that when I seem 'em I won't have that moment..that one moment I had years ago coming home.  Missing my gf for the weeks that I had been gone, but it was like when I saw her I realized that I wasn't in love with her, I realized that we weren't right for eachother.  I don't think that I'll have that moment, I'm actually positive, but knowing that its happened to me in the past I realize that it can happen where the other person makes that realization.  Who knows, we'll see if Bree comes to her senses and sends me out of Beaumont with a kiss and a hug and a ""we need to talk"" look as I board the plane.  </p><p> My R.A.'s are all good people.  I worry, they're not that assertive...fuck, page...so much, so long, so little time, there's no time for me even to gather my thoughts and put them in order. </p>"

Sure, I only sent like five things to Rachel, but it was enough, enough for another 140 pgs! So, there's this incrediable peace over me. I finished something I had set out to do. There's no goals or ambitions for it beyond this point. I can lock it in a drawer and pretend that it's just something there, one more thing to check off my list.

"event","<p> Whoosh....I'm getting down to the wire in Texas. Why is it that when things get good I have to run? I actually had this weird thought about how much I want to stay in town..well at least for now. </p><p> So, sometimes last week my friend Ahli puts me on the phone with this other friend of hers.  Bree is the girl's name.  Apparently she has been having troubles with her ""friend"" and always talked to Ahli about it.  Finally Ahli just asked her if her ""friend"" was just a ""friend"" or a special ""friend"". It turned out it was a special ""friend"".  So, Ahli puts her on the phone with me and we talk..and talk, and talk.  </p><p> Bree is madly in love with her best friend, the best friend knows, has gotten frisky with her before and continues to toy with her while she is dating other guys. Yeah, it's fucked up..but Bree has hung in there for the past few YEARS and has put up with it, finally it's just gotten to be to much. </p><p> So, Bree and I talk, and talk and talk, and I'd never even met her before, it was just kind of weird.  Later on in the week Ahli tells me that me, her, Bree, and our guy friend Chris are all going to go to the local gay club together.  I wasn't excited about going to the gay club, it was just the fact that I was finally going to met this girl after talking to her on the phone.  So she pulls up, first she's nothing like I had imagined, I mean her voice and her looks just don't mesh well, anyway, that's beside the point.  </p><p> We get to the club and there's only six other people there, so we take up upstairs and we're alone, the four of us and the DJ. That's all, to boot it's karoke night.  Bree just sat there, with this far off look in her eyes, obviously thinking about this friend who has complete control over her.  After closing the bar we head over to my friend's and it was just weird.  It was obvious that Bree wanted to talk to Ahli about something that was going on, but Ahli just wasn't getting the hint.  Chris and I felt horribly awkard and kept leaving the two alone, just so that they would have that time to interact and be able to have what ever talk it was that she wanted. </p><p> So, with nothing else to do, Chris and I jump into the pool.  Me, without a bathing suite, just said fuck it and took off my shirt and wore my sports bra and shorts... Now mind you, I NEVER expose myself to ANYONE, regardless of sex..but Chris is my old but who does not have the most flattering body..best part is that I knew he just wouldn't care, so I felt entirely comfortable. We're swiming and having a good time and then this Bree chick decides to leave.  I realized that Ahli hadn't said a single word to her. So, I jump out of the pool, topless and barely pulling a shirt over my ass stopped her at her car..and made her talk.  Well, she didn't really talk that much, she just kind of cried and I talked to her... </p><p> The truth is...I told her that she's selling herself short, and how much it's really worth to keep up this friendship when it's all consuming and if the pain has really been worth it.  She doesn't have a chance with the girl, and the question becomes is she really a friend to keep toying her a long.  I found myself telling Bree that she's too beautiful and has the most amazing personality... Yeah, I look easy considering I told her that the first night I met her, when she didn't even talk to me.  ...I felt like an idiot, I came off easy, but worse yet, I meant all of it.  Silly me! So, getting on with it, she leaves..in tears, and some how she just sticks in my mind. </p><p> Friday Night: </P><P> We all get together Friday night to go on a scavanger hunt, my car has me, Ahli, Bree, and another girl in the backseat who is insignficant.  Bree was so cool, sat in the front seat with me, we talked the entire time.  The scavanger hunt was pretty fun, I posted clues all around Beaumont for everyone.  We had a lot of fun.  We also had a keg back at the main base, but that's besides the point. </p> <p> Get done with the scavanger hunt, it's about three in the morning so we get in the pool and decide to have a little chicken game.  Ahli on my shoulders, Bree on Chris's.  It was a lot of fun, we kept winning 'cause Ahli and I knew that to get 'em all we had to do was keep ripping Bree's bathing suite off.  Modesty will get you nowhere when you play with us.  Anyway... while we're doing that, Ahli kind of get's a dislocated shoulder. We know this because she get's out of the pool and goes, ""Colleen, I need a favor..drive me to the hospital. </p><p> Lucky for me, Bree feels guilty and decides to go to the hospital with me.  It was super great. I was there for six hours, but I can honestly say that I enjoyed every minute that I spent there.... Bree was great, we just kept giggling and being stupid, it got to the point that we'd just laugh, well because we would.  The second reason was because Ahli had a conscious anestia that made her talk and say some pretty wild shit.  I sat there and watched her get her shoulder put back in place. It was pretty fucked up, she's done it before and has had to have surgery, but the worst part was the look of fear and panic in Ahli's face when they told her that they were going to re-locate the damn shoulder.  Man, it was upsetting to see her so scared. </p><p> Anyway, while Bree was outside the cleaning lady, who'd we'd had a blast with thirty minutes before, kept asking Bree if Ahli and I were ""friends"", no, no, not just friends, but ""friends"".  It was pretty funny and Bree told her the truth, we aren't ""friends"" but just friends.  All and all it was a pretty wild time at the hospital..with every moment fun as hell 'cause this one girl was with me...someone who I met the fucking night before.  Crazy shit..it's like one of those once in a life time things.... I'll have to go into the craziness that was Saturday night another time, it wasn't as important because she wasn't there..but at least i got her to come out of her shell and watch movies tonight..oh yeah."

"event","</p><p> Friday was my last day of work. I went over to my friends, the same one, and we had planned on running a scavanger hunt.  The guys that we had over kind of vetoed the idea and instead sat around and drank.  There were about nine of us just chilling pool side.  Here's the fucked up part, so it's Chris and Bris and Kyle..there were others, but these we the three main ones.  </p><p> Let's take a moment to talk about these boys. Now, none of them are under 6'2, none of them are under 220 pounds, and by no means are any of 'em weak.  They all behave like cave men.  First, they don't care about anyone's personal belongings.  Second, they don't care where they are, when to leave, and they sure as hell don't get a hint.  Here's an example, they were at my friend's until 7:30 a.m. with me and her, even after she had told 'em to leave.  3) The moment their masculinity is challenged, whether it is by a male or female they have to exert control. </p><p> Now returning poolside Friday night.  I'm on my period..and it was that special day..you know the one we all know where it's like Niagra Falls would have nothing on is.... so I'm wearing both a pad and Tampon.  These guys feel the need to shove everyone in the pool. I protest to them, I explain my situation in GREAT detail, but because the third guy challenged the other one they had to resort to dragging me in the pool.  </p><p>Now let's evalute something.  I'm not a small girl, and I'm by no means helpless, but in relationship to these guys individually, I can't take one, but I had two of 'em come after me.  I held on to a chair..that stalled 'em.  I sat on the ground...got a little more time..but by this point they were dragging me.  I even went for the nuts, fighting and SCREAMING at the top of my lungs..and not in that friendly joking way.  I grab onto a wood fence post, I'm holding on so hard and they're pulling so hard that we ended up ripping the fence post..then FINALLY..they get me in the pool, but they ended up draggin me in knees first..which mean that there was blood when I got out of the pool, it's just that I honestly have NO skin on my right knee. Those fucking bastards."

"event","<p> I spent this past weekend on the river in Texas hill country. It was me and two friends from camp.  We are all old has-been counselor's and went up to soak up the sun.  We sat there, in our innertubes for hours each day.  The silence was great, the sound of the wind through the trees over head. There's nothing that I can say to recreate how wonderful it was. I determined then and there that I'll return someday, maybe even to retire.  </p><p> On the flip side I got so sunburned that my upper arms are blistering and I couldn't move for the first day after I had gotten back from hill country.  Awww...the first sun burn of the year.</p><p> We went to camp, no longer than an hour each day. We sat around and ate with the counselor's and picked up our Dirty Mexican counselor. It was great to see her. She knows the details of why I'm not back at camp. It was so painful to walk around camp and having all of these other staff memebers, who have no clue, that I should have come back, that they needed me so bad as a staff memeber, that archery wasn't the same.  It was horrible.  I did however enjoy going to camp just one more time. I guess it was the informal goodbye that I had been looking for.  I think it would have been a little easier to put things behind me if I could have walked out of the gates at the end of this summer, after being a counselor just one more time..but I couldn't.  There was so much pain associated with my peace. </p><p> Then, the girl, who is the reason I can't go back to camp...she randomly calls last night. Talks to my mom, my mom asks her for her name at the end of the conversation and she gave it.  Idiot.  My mom, and I quote said, ""I'll make sure she never calls you back or ever speaks to you again."" I checked the caller ID this evening when I returned from work.  There was a blocked call listed again.  It's so odd that she's decided to call now, after all of this time, then to call right when my pain is the ABSOLUTE worst after having been at camp this weekend.  </p><p> I guess it would sound stupid to anyone else who hasn't been at camp.  It's such a large part of myself.  There was a time when I felt certain of a future that involved camp. I wanted to be a teacher so that I would have my summers free and be involved with that magical thing that is camp, but now I can't.  I guess there's always funny ways of moving onto something new. </p><p> I put my one-week's notice in on Monday. This Friday is my last day at work..another end to another chapter. </p>"

"event","<p> So yesterday I leave work early. It was just that mood that I had been in all day. I had called my camp friend and after talking to her I didn't feel like doing anything at work. The system was shot to hell anyway, I managed to convince my old junior high friend to run away with me..and run away I did. I got home and slept, finally went out around 8:30 and hung out with my nerdish AD&D friends, but I had fun.  I like hanging out with them, they're cool, but I am angry when I get embrassed when other people see me. I'm shallow. </p><p> So, I get home around 11:20, call my friend Ahli. She has Chris, Michelle, and herself sitting at her house waiting for me. I pull up and they're all dressed in black..that either means a funeral..or a fun night. </p><P> So, we proceed to go to the local high school and couldn't find anything to take, then we go to the local church and find what we were looking for, two statues, about 4 feet high..mind you these fuckers are heavy..and we run off with 'em. </p><P> I know, I know, it sounds like petty theivery, but it wasn't, there was reasoning behind it.  So, we take the statues, treating them like the Saints that they are..Anthony and Micheal, and cruise around town in a phat 1982 Benz.  Four young adults with nothing to do.  What came to pass is that we ended up running around to various places and taking pictures with the statues. The carwash, the toliet, the bed, playing soccer, 7-11 buying smokes, at McDonalds, at Starbucks, you name it, those statues went and had a wonderful time. </p><P>  None of these pictures have any of the four of us in them..what we're playing is to develope the film and mail it back to the church with a themed scrapbook, ""Anthony's and Micheal's Wild Night Out."" It really was hysterical...Thank God we never got pulled over 'cause my other Three friends were DRUNK AS HELL..and kept screaming at people..but that's besides the point. </p><p> Of course we returned the statues at 3 a.m. in the morning, safely where they had been three hours before. No theft involved."

"event","<p> Pretty funny...my friend's parent's drunk and asking me for three hours last night if I'm really, really happy with my life's decisions. I explained to them that I was and I wasn't in denile about it.  It was a pretty cool conversation.  The reason why I was over there was because they caught some stupid kids trying to steal their bikes in their garage.  It's a pretty funny story, but I don't have the time or engery to type it out. </p> <p> I skipped out of work early today. I was depressed, we're talking SUPRER depressed. Nothing for the past three days has gone right for me.  No matter what I try to do, nope it just goes to hell. </p><p> I was so depressed because my Dirty Mexican friend e-mailed me from camp and told me that I had to call her and talk to her. I did, expecting the worst, and it really wasn't, but she talked to the ladies at camp and she wanted to let me know that they all didn't hate me, that they believed me when I told 'em what really happened.  It was just whack, listening to her talk, hearing the kids in teh background and here I am sitting in this world of re-fiancing and numbers when I should be out there..out with kids, out teaching archery, not here, anywhere but here. It's not that I don't want to become an adult, but it's becoming that person who forget's what it's like to be a kid. I'm so worried about that..and I hope it never happens. </p>"

"event","<p> So, my friend comes over tonight and tells me she broke up with her fiance/boyfriend.  Humm...I don't know why, but I do. They just weren't happy with eachother. I wonder how much of an influence I had. I've been ragging on her for a while. It's not that I don't think that he's a bad guy, but you can see that she's not happy with him.  THe worst part is that when I made those type of comments she'd disscuss it for hours with me, reinforcing the idea that maybe she had settled on someone.  The part that scares me was,
Me, in a joking, trying to lighten the mood way: ""You didn't break up with him for me?""
Her: ""I was waiting for you to ask that.""
</p><p> Sure, that conversation seems a little harmless, what would it implies makes me worried.  She didn't say anything beyond that, so what does that mean?  Usually someone then add's a ""no"" somewhere after that, but she didn't. Ut-oh! </p>"

"event","<p> So, I smell like gasoline, that's nothing new. I've been working my ass off. I got shafted on may check and the bastards shorted me $70. Assholes. </p><p> My eye has been twitching, which means that I've been stressed. The only person who can actually make that happy, apply enough stress in my life, is my mother. She's so talanted. </p><p> Nothing else to report. Actually, there's a lot to report, well not really. Just the haze that has been my life. Work is cool, it's a lot neater going there and enjoying the time. The people are not a lot more laid back and I'm having fun. Yes, fun..I missed that. It's just when I get home at the end of the day I've put in a ten hour day. They moved me up to an assist leader the other day. I had to go to the training classes and answer questions for them when they took live calls. Summary: On Friday's, after a week of training the students actually begin to take real calls with supervision. I was one of two people in the room with twenty others answering questions. It went pretty well. I was surprised that I knew as much as I did.  </p><p> Fuck, what else happened in my life. They dreams, they still come and they've been ruining my day, waking up with these hoplessly lost feelings. </p>"

"event","<p> I got the memo today at work. I'm set to start an 80 hour training class...two weeks of intense morgage management data, theories, and numbers.  Jesus, my mind just reeled when I found out.  I mean, I was excited that they picked me, they only picked a few of us, however I'm not at this point where it's all awe.  Me, a number cruncher, in two week's time that's all I'm going to do, number crunch. The program that I've been assigned requires me to gather all information needed to process a loan application.  Average length of a call: two hours.  I'm taking a person from the bottom rung, with no pre-approval research and starting to figure out where they stand. I have the power to deny..which I really don't want. </p><p> I also got bored today and called my credit card company. I just asked them on the off chance if I could get a lower intrest rate..and they actually said yes.  Mother and I had a fight over money again.  I don't know what to do with her and tears my heart when ever we do fight about it. I just get so frustrated because she plays helpless when she should have been <i> trying </i> to do something..anything about a job or even insurance. God. I'm angry. </p><p> I'm a number cruncher..a degree in history and I'm fucking number cruncher. I was in special math my entire time in school.  I guess it's a great career oppurtunity..if I'm ever short some cash and need a job I can always go back to the morgage field..but how did I end up here? Wow, life is just a mystery. </p><P> I got smacked in the face by my old camper yesterday. She blames me for another camper not coming back to camp. I think that she was just hurt though, that her friend would say, ""I'm not going back because Colleen isn't going back,"" as opposed to being willing to go for the other camper's sake. </p> I'm in a super funk. I can't go to sleep in a heartbeat like I had been doing for the past week or so...I just can't drift off. </p>"

"event","<p> Who knows what the hell I've been doing. I think that I'm the last person to actually know.  It rained today, not hard, but firm, and it was sunny while it was raining.  I don't know, something about it made me a little happy and I enjoyed walking in it. </p> <p> I've realized that I'm actually enjoying work. The days seem to go by super fast and before I know it it's already over.  I guess I'm doing something that requires some intellect and so I'm capable of doing a better job at dispensing information.  My mother did catch me the other day, her comment was ""Your conversational language has deteriated."" I just looked at her, and then she said, ""You're English is for shit, who the hell have you been hanging around that you can't sound like an educated person.."" I realized that the people at work have this influence over me. </p><p> So, I had my friend Ahli over the other night. She was going on about this guy she fell in love with in college, whom she had met up with again over the past weekend and fell in love with again.  Now she's totally disatisfied with her life. I don't blame her, her boyfriend and I don't share the same views. He's the one who made the comment that gay marriages will lead to polygomy and that marriage is for the purposes of reproducing. </p><p> Once again, not being gay in southeast Texas, I had to refrain from jumping on top of him in the car and smacking some sense into him.  Anyway, he got into this whole speil about marriage isn't about love, it's about lust.  That when you get married it's with someone who see yourself being potentially happy with in having children.  Basically it's back to the whole thing about love not really exsisting...why am I the only one who feels that it's there.  Damn bastards. I'm a fucking romatic and I'm a dork, but I'll hold firm 'till the day I die...mainly because I know that I've experienced it..but oh well.  There was a point to this..oh yeah.. </p><p> Ahli whining about her guy who she'll never see again..she had asked me if I had any idea about this feeling and I had to go into a whole speil of yes..I do, in fact there is this girl sitting in Austrila who I hadn't thought about for a while..but she brought all those painful memories back and now I'm haunted by them and constantly think about her before I go to bed....but those will go away again.  They have in the past, they will again.  </p><p> Then also going back to lost love, Ahli knows the story about my super ex, the one who is about to get married.  When Ahli and my friend's sat in New Orleans they spent an entire weekend trying to plot the destruction of this poor girl's wedding.  All I can do is say, ""I'm not involving myself in this conversation, I wish her the best,"" which is enirely true..but still she comes back and haunts my dreams a lot too and I don't know why.  That chapter has been closed, but I wake up at night sometimes cluthing at a dream that I just had with her. Those nights haunt me."

"event","<p> Last night I got so frustrated at my mom, and then at life in general. She went to go pick up a prescription and they told her that her insurance had been cancelled.  She was pretty upset by this, considering she's in surgery right now for her foot.  She had planned on the insurance picking up everything... My father's company said that she had three years of insurance from the date that my father died. Understanderably she's upset because he didn't die until the end of July. </p><p> Anyway, outside of the whole battle we're going to have to wage with the company, I asked my mom what she had planned on doing when her insurance ran out, mainly because she takes a fair number of pills.  Her response, ""I don't know, I had just thought about saving the money that I was spending on insurance and using that."" I was so pissed, my mom has had all this time and she still hadn't figured out what she wanted to do. I just wanted to scream at her. </p> Ahli called me after I got home and I went out to the restraunt she was at.  She had her boyfriend's cousin, who's only 16.  He's a fun guy though and cute and sweet.  We ended up going over to his house, looking at his mom's new wedding pictures for an hour and half and then finally making our way out to the country to shoot off some fireworks that Zach had bought. </p><p> Ahli calls his boyfriend who lives around the corner and he came out, we're all sitting on the tail gate of his truck by the creek and the Sherif's department shows up.  We only had about four fire works..like the big ones that make a show.  Apparently the neighbor's had called the Sherif's department on us. We were setting them off 15 minutes after 10:00 which is the latest you can shoot them.  </p><p> We all just giggled because we knew we were all legal, we didn't even have liquor, which the Sheriff kept asking us if we did.  Ahli's boyfriend's cousin, Zach, looked a little out of place when we all told him our ages.. 22,22,22, and 16, but we informed him that he was the other boy's cousin.  It's been a long time since I've been interrogated by the Sherif's department. Anyway, he left without incident and we stayed out for a while longer. </p><p> I guess that I need to get back to the dr's office where mom is having foot surgery. I talked to my sister the other day who is up in Seattle visiting.  Apparently my other grandmother is not in the best health.  However, my sister told me that everyone up there, like the rest of relatives were super happy to hear that I was coming. My half-sister talked to me a bit on the phone and apparently they've already been planning weekend trips with me.  She offered me a deal, I can come do laundry anytime.....but I just have to watch the kids.  That's not a bad trade-off. </P>"

"event","<P> I'm tired.  However, I have to update my journal before I forget everything that has transpired with in a 73 hour period. </p><P> Got off on Friday, made it to Baton Rouge, where I was horribly side-tracked by Ahli and Rachel and Ahli's demand's to watch the movie ""The secretary"".  ...granted it was addicting.  Finally get back on the road to reach New Orleans at about 1 a.m. I think that that is what time we made it. No wait, it was later than that. </p><p> I spent Saturday hanging out with a few New Orleans friends that I haven't seen in a while, Ahli's little sister and pretty much waiting to hear something from my friend Beth, whom I was staying with.  At Beth's apartment was me, Ahli, Courtney (Suitemate from college) and her friend Uh..Mary Ann? It's horrible that I can't remember her name because I fell madly in love with her..but that's besides the point. </p><p> Beth disappared on Saturday night with her friend, Sarah, whom I've met before and is hysterical. Apparently some high school crushes randomly appeared in town and they had to hang out with them. I lost track of Beth for most of the night at that point, but Courtney, Ahli, Mary Ann, and I went out to dinner where we got to know eachother and began laughing hysterically for no reason. </p><p> We get a call, head to the same bar with Beth and her friends..about four other's.  It kind of ended up so that we really didn't talk to Beth and her friend's that much because the four of us were so involved with what we were doing.  Which was being pretty stupid.  I don't think that I've laughed as hard as that for a long time. It was one of those nights that progressed into me holding my stomach and not wanting to laugh any more because some things were just so damn amusing. </p> <p> So, my friends proceed to get pretty damn drunk. Ahli and Mary Ann (who is SUPER attractive) keep drawing in guys who were going to the bathroom.  We had a bar stool set up for these guys and we'd ask 'em questions.  It got to a point where guys in the bar would drag their friends over to be asked questions.  Meanwhile..my friends are getting shots bought for them left and right and I'm standing soberly by watching them with my life. </p><p> Towards the end of the night, around 5 a.m., is when it got pretty funny and pretty wild.  I had to be on the guard 'cause the girls were pretty damn drunk and there were guys lining up to take them home. I had to keep on explaining that I was the sober friend and I was cock-blocking. Quite a few of the guys understood and then they tried to take me home. Good times, good times. </p><p> I drove home Sunday  night. Thanks to Mrs. Rachel who was nice enough to put me and Ahli's sorry asses up again..even though she had that horrible Physic's test that she had to take..not that she studied for it.  At least Ahli and I got to watch the end of the secretary. Granted I only spent three hours asleep at Rachel's it was quite nice. ...and I know that secretly she wanted to jump on top of me the entire time...  </P><p> Ahli and I had a pretty big recap on the way home.  She as really suprised about this secret ""double"" life that I lead.  She was always curious about what the hell went on in New Orleans and how me and my friends really were.  I guess she was a little suprised about how mean and evil we were.  I was called Satan a few times with my friend Beth, but we've just grown accustomed to it.  It's what makes us shine in the morning. </P>"

"event","<p> I'm getting to the point where I hate being here. No, I'm not frustrated, it's just the lack of depth with some of my friend's is mind boggling.  My best guy friend, came back into town this past weekend.  Of course I don't get a call, but I do get a call to come hang out tonight.  </p><p> Well, after hanging out at my female friends house, and then having my car run out of gas, my happy ass finally made it to the bar where I find my female's friend's boyfriend, and my guy friend Jon, and another guy friend. I haven't seen this guy in like two months..which really isn't that much, anyway, no comment no word.  All he talks about is how great Arlington was and how many Hooter's he went to.  It was so degrading.  I just wanted to say, ""So, did you manage to get any titties in your face that you didn't have to pay for?"" Ugh! </p><p> I'm so upset by how much money has changed him.  It's like he's too good for any of us because he's the super head manager inherting all of his money from his father's company.  It's my one motivation in life, biterness towards my friends, just to do something with myself that's not fiancial.  That's all he wants, going on talk about how he's going to buy a boat, and he's trying to get $8,500 a month instead of $7500. </p><p> It's not that I'm pissed off by what he's getting, or even how he's getting it, it's just that he's being such a bitch about it.  The conversation has to go back to him at Hooters, or him getting drunk at the company picnic, and ALWAYS these hot waitresses..Jesus man, if you have to get drunk and seriously OVER tip these woman..that should tell you something..but that's all it was about. ALL of it. </p><p> I'm so ready to get out of here. When I leave I'm not turning my head back.  I need to finally step away. </p>"

"event","<P> I had to play the longest game of scrabble last night, alone with my mother.  After that shit, and winning, I finally got to go out. Headed to my friend Katie's.  She's just kid, a junior at LSU and 20.  She's the little sis of a guy friend who is my age and one of my good buds, but he's been out of town.  Me and Ahli headed over to Kate's 'cause her parents are out of town.  It's not exciting for us any more, but it is for Katie, so we figured we'd entertain her while she got drunk.  We had a few other people during the night, but in the end it ended up just being me, Ahli, and an old school friend Chris from back in the day.  Katie was there the entire time..but. </p>
<p> Stupid girl got drunk as fuck.  My friend Chris I was trying to encourage to get some action on and he was.  Ahli was the good angel and I played the bad angel.  Chris was pretty pissed that Ahli was trying to cockblock him, but then we realized Katie was pretty damn drunk to do anything on her own, so we put her to sleep. </p>  <p> It's whack though, Ahli and I have always had this thing, that makes me constantly wonder what the hell is going through he head.  At bar's, and at parties, when she get's ANYTHING in her system she'll be on top of me.  Tonight we were talking about something and I said, ""Come over and I'll sleep with you, and we'll get freak,"" her immediatly response was, ""Okay!"" I was so surprised I just looked at her and smiled.  She then went on to explain that in her class that she's learning about how criminals and some people just let things slip, it's what they really want, but even more so when she's drunk.  I pointed out to her that that means that she's backing up that she want's me.  She smiled.  </P><P> While Katie was being taken of by Chris... Ahli and I had some alone time.  She told me that there was something that she wanted to tell me and she seemed pretty upset by it all.  After proding her for about half an hour I got it out of her.  She once told me this story about she had been hit on by this girl.  Last night she told me that she hadn't told me it all... that she had actually gone home with this girl and they had dome some wild shit.  We spent some quality time talking about it, and how she feels.  I guess after all the months ago that it happened I'm the only person she mentioned it to.  I asked her the standard, is it the though of what you did that upset you, or the thought that you'd do it again? Her immediatly response is, ""I don't answer my phone when calls because I'm afraid I'll go over and do it again, because part of me want's to. </p><P> So, I spent the rest of my night giving an abbrevated, ""It's okay, you're bi,"" talk.  However, she kept on trying to get me to stay after the time I was there.  All she kept saying was, ""I want you alone."" I HAD TO GO.  I had to be at work, but from a few other things she had said regarding what she'd like me to do...I have a very strong feeling I'm going to have to keep a guard up so that I'm not alone with her for two long a time... </p>"

Explified in evolution.  </P><p> So you have humans, who have this goal of survival.  They have imination, stemming from actual events.  Let's say an apple fell from a tree, and someone ate it.  This event that has occured in actual reality is taken to the next level.  A person takes this idea and uses it to their advantage, they create a belief around this apple, encompassing it so that they have a positon over other people around them, thus helping their survial. </p><p> This is way simplified from the main idea. </P><P> A human, who has a greater capacity for imagination ties this apple into religion.  They have created a higher being that helps them achieve a certain status within the community.  Example, men as more proment then women, or an event that binds the community together.  Example man is not perfect, they have fallen from grace, but this shared experience makes them closer to one another. </p><P> Taking this idea further, and more narrow, a man creates a history of what has happened.  Perhaps once he stayed with a neighbor from another tribe.  The man was nice to him, he will recount the story to his children so that they know to respect the neighbor.  They have a history together that unites them, thus making them stronger in the goals of survial. </P> <p> Families delevop similar histories to unite themselves, at the same time dividing themselves from people who don't share the same history...even if that history was a part of the imagination.  However, these lines are drawn, as a figment of the imagination based on fact that unite some and fragment others.  Let's just say that their concept of survial or history they develop is narrowed based in that they don't think to include everyone in it.  They get their strenght through this concepts. </p><p> Through this will to survive they have created a religion that unites, a history that unites.  The flaw of this idea of history is that through time it has divided certain nations, who essential similar to wage war on one another.  The only way to erase this idea and create a true state of survival would to create a history that would be all inclusive... </p><p> ...I had written a thirty page paper on this concept, and this was the capstone ideas that I was trying to recall..but I couldn't remember what my inherit flaw was..fuck.</P>"

It struck me as kind of odd, because she seems like a lady who is pretty with it.  I guess it would make sense if I added that the people that work at the place I work at..work there for a reason.  I work there because I'm a college kid with nothing else to do.  People work there because they're convicted felons and can't get other jobs.  People work there for a reason, not just encompassing the job idea. </p><p> Anyway, Susan is an older lady, reminds me of my mom, in her late fifties and pretty with it.  Can hold an intellegent conversation and doesn't stagger into work drunk.  </p> I got to work a little earlier and got off an hour from one of my shifts and me and Susan, and this other lady who is there because she's in her residency for a nurse practictioner were all smoking and hanging out.  This lady, the NP resident has been at my company for a long time.  After Susan left I asked her what her story was 'cause the NP is a gossip. </p><p> Anyway, the NP resident told me 'bout how Susan just spends all of her money at the Casino's, she's an addict and lives at the Salvation Army. Her family threw her out 'cause she stole from her and another lady at work threw her out of her house 'cause she stole from her as well. </p><p> It was really odd, I felt kind of upset.  Here I thought that this lady was totally cool..and she is, but it was kind of a wake up call to my naive stupidity.  I mean, I am super trusting of a lot of people and always hope for the good in 'em.  This one threw me for a loop 'cause I just didn't see it, I couldn't see anything.  It wasn't all just the NP resident, there was another lady there who was agreeing the entire time...man, freaky how many secrets people have. </p><P>"

Bastards! </p><p> I hung out at a friends tonight.  On the brief drive over there I kept thinking that summer was offical and here I was in town for the first time in ages.  What the hell am I going to do? I have a feeling that it actually might turn out good, if it's anything like tonight, than maybe so. </p> <p> There were five us hanging out my one friends house tonight, we went swiming and they were all drinking.  Two of 'em I hadn't seen for ever, big Chris and Michelle.  We all hung out like old times.  Ahli and her boyfriend, Brian disappeared.  I was in the pool, alone and got out and asked what the hell was up.  I missed the boat 'cause the others were taking bets on how long it was going to take before they came back.  Sadly, Chris won at only five minutes.  These two others went and fucked in five minutes..that's including the time it took for 'em to get to the bathroom and get back.  </P><p> Okay, it's not the part about 'em having sex while we're all right there, no, not at all.  What kills me is what is the purpose of fucking in only five minutes? Sure, the guy feels pretty good about it, but damn what is the point? </p><p> These are the same friends who I had to debate, while remaining heterosexual, about why they don't call sex, making love. There argument is that they don't understand why it would be called making love, when they talk about it they say that it just sound stupid. Sex is sex.  I tried, very poorely (due to my heterosexualness) to try and explain that it seems kind of sad that they don't experience sometype of intimate closeness, extended foreplay, or just being close to someone while having sex.  The argued back that it's not just the person that they're with, but they feel that that is how it would be with anyone that were with, regardless of how much they loved them.  </p><p> This argument just doesn't seem right in my head. Maybe I'm just a romanitic, or even worse, a lesbian, but still, I know that you can call ""sex,"" making love because that's the enjoyable part of it. The ""making love"" is more the intimate aspect and I really feel for my friends 'cause they're just fucking around missing out on a lot of good stuff there.  This argument has gotten stupid. I'm going to bed. <p>"

"event","<p> Wow, it's 2:30 a.m. and I Just walked in the door. I never thought that there would be a day like this in Texas. I'm over in Houston, staying at my sister's.  I called an old friend from camp, we had dinner and then I called some guys from my past and found myself in downtown Houston... at... gasp, dance clubs. </p><p> I figured that this night was going to be a miserable social obligation, especially since I was the designated driver, and going out with my guy's and their girlfriends, who are all a very young 18. Thank god for my camp friend who sat with me at the bar and proceeded to make fun of QUITE a few people who walked in the door.  It was all I could do to have beer keep from coming out my nose on quite a few occassions. </p><p> I opened up and told her about why I couldn't go back to camp.  She agreeded that the whole situation was a little fucked up.  The whole conversation that we had some how didn't dawn on her that I might be gay, and then at the bar.. </p><p> Imagine two girls, sitting togther, one is VERY attractive (my friend) who is wearing blue jeans and a wife beater, 'cause she hadn't planned on going out, and then there's me at a table with shorts on and a t-shirt..The two of us just giggling and holding bud beer bottles... we were true women. </p><p> So, these girls walk in as a group, all cutesy and ready to go upstairs.  Well her friends go upstairs, and she follows, but twenty minutes later she's back down at our table.  She gives us some excuse, something along the lines of if she could hang out with us 'cause she wasn't about the dance scene.  </p> My friend are all for it, we don't care, but we couldn't understand what this one super hot sexy beautiful girl is doing downstairs with us, especially since she was all dressed up and ready to go out.  She even passed our constanted bombardment of insults of people who passed through the door. </p><p> So, this girl turns out to be pretty cool, and she's sitting next to me, and just keep sliding closer and closer, finally her friends come back through the door and wave to her to come, I guess that they were club hopping, although this was an hour later. So, it's one of those momets where it was awkard, she looked at me and then she looked at her friends, just as she was about to tell them something, my guys walk up wanting to go as well, making it clear that we were about to leave. </p><p> Anyway, the girl says she has to go to the bathroom and looks at me, I caught the clue and figured that I was going with her.  So we went to the bathroom and outside she quickly wrote her name and phone number on this piece of paper.  Then out of nowhere she's like, ""You're going to have forgive me,"" and totally jumps all over me.  I didn't even respond, I was so dazed and fucking shocked, that the poor girl pulled off kissing me and was like, ""I fucked up,"" and at least I was quick enough to respond that she hadn't, just that it was a suprise, that was all....at least that put her mind a little at ease and I got the most beautiful smile out of her when she walked away. </p><p> ON the car ride home I was thinking about it, like the difference between tonight and the night I spent last night with the guy. I guess that the one thing would be that I had a great time talking to this guy, but there wasn't a single second that I thought about sex, or how attracted I was to him, but how attarctive he was in general.  Where as with this girl, it was like ""WOW."" Again and again in my head, it wasn't just her great personality, in making fun of people with us, but damn I was physically attracted to her.  I guess my heterosexual crisis has once again been averted. </p>"

"event","<p> I was out in the sun today, mowed the backyard, vacuumed the pool, weeded the yard. I tried to clean the carpets, but I broke my mom's machine.  I feel really bad about it.  It's like her favorite tool in her life.  If I had the money I'd get her a new carpet cleaner. She tells me that it was on it's last legs regardless..but still we've only had it for about seven years and well things in our house tend to last longer than that. </p> <p> In other news, I went to feed my dogs yesterday outside and I was attacked by the neighborhood birds.  My mom watched and laughed, apparently since we've been feeding our dogs the birds and woodland creatures all know when it's feeding time. They will start to gather in the trees around you as your put the food out.  As soon as you walk away they'll walk up to my dog's food bowls and eat with them.  It really is like the movie the birds. BlueJays, woodpeckers, crows, and sparrows, all line the fence watching you as you feed the dogs. It's pretty damn scary. I had to act as the decoy and let the bluejay attack me while my dog could eat.  I've been pecked at by the same bird before. </p><p> I've been thinking about a conversation I had almost five years ago, wait it would be three minus four, so seven years ago.  I talked with a friend of mine, Morgan, at my other friend's Helen's birthday party.  I remember walking down the street with him and telling him that he needs to get his act together.  He always played the fool and acted a lot stupiter than he was.  I remember telling him that eventually it was going to kill him.  That he wasn't going to be able to live his life like that or someday he'd snap. </p><p> We were freshman in high school then, and our senior year Morgan and I hadn't talked to eachother in almost four years, not since that birthday party.  We had both gone our own ways and he was with his group of friends and I was just around somewhere in between.  We'd run into eachother at the occasional party, but neither one of us would acknowledge the other's exsitence.  That's just how life had pulled us apart.  When I got the phone call from another friend of mine, telling me that Morgan had killed himself I wasn't upset that he was dead.  I was upset by the fact that here I had been, four years before, talking to a boy that no one even believed that I knew.  I had told this boy that this was going to happen, now he was dead and no one had over heard that conversation.  Bitch killed himself and I couldn't even say, ""I told you so,"" because no one would believe me. </p>"

I had slowed down and stopped to look at 'em because I was near the edge of the yard and I just figured that I might know them if they were slowing down. Instead the bastards shot me with a water gun! Okay, they really aren't bastards, I thought it was funny, as they drove off the screamed that it was a drive by shooting. It was just water, so it was fine.  There's nothing like mindless jokes on a hot day. </p><p> I went out to the pool hall/ bar with a few friends the other night. We had a good time, I guess. I haven't been out in ages and it was nice to see the guys.  </p><p> For some reason, and for sometime, I've just had this building resent for a friend of mine. I guess I'm super pissed off that life is being handing to him and he's changed into this super jerk who won't even talk to us.  You spend a whole month in Europe with someone and then they run off to a big cooperation.  I'll never sell my soul for anything, especially if it makes me into that.  I can't even hope for tradgey to befall him, I mean in terms of financial, because even if he fails at his job, he'll still have millions handed to him when his father dies.

Two days before there was a sparrow that was so weak from being trapped on the patio that it let me pick it up and put it outside.  It flew out of my hands, it was pretty neat.  The damn woodland creatures come in to eat the dogfood then they can't find their way out. Stupid animals. </p><p> Anyway, while chasing this blue jay across the patio, and having it attack me. It hit the window to our family room.  It hit the window pretty damn hard.  Now I'm not really that superstious, but my mom just makes me aware of the superstion.

The 95 years of drinking two beers a night, a glass of wine, and smoking a pack of cigrets finally caught up to her. Well, they actually didn't.  She just kind of closed her eyes and went to sleep for good.  I guess that's the best way to go.  I'm not upset, I knew her, but I didn't see her that often.  Especially at that age, it's kind of expected she's going to go at some point soon. </p><p> I now have to drive my happy ass up to Pennsylvania.

Well, I kind of have to go there, but it's this weird complex thing that I don't even want to think about.  I had that phone interview for that job and I think that it went well. Who knows what the hell is going on in the world. I don't hear shit back about anything I've applied to. I guess I need to be patcient. </p><p> I'm just bored. God, two or even three more months of this town may kill me. I don't ever see my friends any more. We've all kind of scattered to the wind. I need to go to bed. I'm not really feeling all that depressed, I still have so much hope in all the things that come. Humm. </p><p> I've been thinking a lot about getting certfied as a teacher.  Random, but it's something that I think I'd enjoy and be good at. Who knows, I don't know if I want to be underappreciated and underpaid for an extended period of time. </p>"

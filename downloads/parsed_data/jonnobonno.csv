Laterly I've found I've been sending drunk text messages to people, and thats bad because I'm at my most vulnerable when drunk, I will open up and shit, and I don't want to do that. So instead I bottle it, and come home from being drunk and start doing stupid shit.

Why can life be so unfair? What have I done to deserve to feel like this the majority of the time? I feel like i'm heading to disaster, I just cannot cope much longer and I don't know what to do, or where to turn.

"event","Hello again,

Well stuff has changed again since I last wrote in here. We finally have a house for next year, although haven't seen inside yet, which is a bit worrying, but its better than nothing.

Went out to the font last night, had a really good night, which is a change from all the other nights I've had this week, and what i'm having tonight. I feel like such a failure, a worthless piece of shit! ARRRRGGGHH

I'm lost, I have no direction, no one to turn to who will understand what i'm going through, I hate it! I really hate it! Sometimes I wonder why i'm even at uni, I suppose because I couldn't stand working full time any longer, the place was driving me mad.

Something is still missing, I know what that is, and it was hammered home when I got a letter earlier this week from andy and amanda, on behalf of SCC. I'm doing it again this year, because I had a great time, but am I doing it for the right reasons. Oli and other people seem so settled at their uni, and I don't know if I am, is it too late to start? Bah!

Well at least the house is sorted for now, and I'm really looking forward to sharing with the people who I'm sharing with, it will be strange as we don't live with each other this year. But thats a long way away, other bridges to cross before we get there.

Work sucks at the moment, I have two essays and an assignment to write, all for different subjects, so I'm finding it hard to keep switching. I'm also not organised, and the philos essay is soooo hard, I hate it! I'm going to have to do a stint in the lurk tomorrow, as there are too many distractions at home.

Oh well thats it for now"

I can't pin it down exactly what is bringing me down all the time, probably just the combination of things that always bring me down, and thats a whole seven years to draw upon.

I really hate being me, I see other people and wish WHY CAN'T I BE LIKE THEM, instead of being me. I just can't take being like this anymore, fed up of being up and down all the time.

"event","Well compared to yesterday, today has been a shitty day. Just when I thought that everything would finally be sorted, house wise. Everything goes tits up once more. Why can't life be simple, it seems that way for everyone else. 

Firstly noone is to blame, its just a bit confusing. Basically we (me tom and steve) found a house we really like. Its a five bedroom house, and we assumed (perhaps this was our downfall) that Ian and rob would like to move in. Rob has got to sort out what he is doing next year, and is not sure what he is doing, which is fair enough, but quite annoying as we've only got the property reserved until four tomorrow afternoon, and Ian isn't a student anymore, so its unlikely that he'll be able to move in. BALLS

Looks like we're going to have to pass on that house and look for a four bedroom one instead, because then if rob doesn't move in, its only one room to fill, rather than two. Its a shame really because I really liked the house we looked at, but then again, as always things are out of my control.

I'm also starting to feel a bit separated from some of my friends, especially Karen and Luke. Luke there is no real reason why, I suppose we're just very busy and he lives on the other campus. Karen however is a bit more complicated. Due to circumstances, I don't see her as much, because we move in circles, but when two people are not really seeing eye to eye, and you happen to be good friends of both of them, it becomes tricky. This is in no way meant to be a guilt trip for the two people involved, its just is so hard being in the middle, just wish I could make it better.

I think I'm starting to make myself feel ill, with constantly feeling down.. I have no energy, always in a mood once I'm alone. I just hope I can feel better by the weekend, as I'm really looking forward to the cruise. 

Uni is supposed to be a time where you define what your personality is, I just wish someone would tell me what I'm like, my good points (if any), my bad points... as I have no idea.. I just feel so bland and unimportant, like its not worth the time of day to talk to me. I know that sounds dramatic, but at times thats what I feel like. Stupid me eh!

Anyway, thats all for now."

"event","Today me Steve and Tom went house-hunting and it went quite well. We really wanted Andy, Will, Rich and Dan's house but when we rung up it was already taken, so we were quite annoyed about that. However after looking round a bit more we found another house we like still close to uni, and the great thing is its close to both campuses and Asda, which is nice.

Tomorrow steve is going to ring up in the morning, a reserve it for us, and then we'll go and pay the deposits, I will feel alot happier when we know that we have got the house for sure, at the moment its still quite stressful and worrying. We also need to make sure we have the house full, it looks like that won't be a problem with Rob and Ian moving in, but you never know... I just don't want to be left with empty rooms which leave us all out of pocket, because that would be annoying.

Tom and steve went to the font tonight, I was going to go, but I can't really be arsed tonight because I don't have alot of money, and I've spent alot on the cruise that we're going on, on saturday. That should be really good, and I'm really looking forward to having a good laugh with mates (Steve W, Karen, Luke and Tom)

Exam was yesterday, and it was a disaster, but not going to dwell on that, nowt I can do about it now... the only confort is that lindsey and kate found it hard too, so hopefully everyone has done badly, which won't be so bad ;-)

Next few days I planned to catch up with stupid philosophy, but knowing me I won't actually bother, I HATE IT SO MUCH! 

I'm writing loads today because dodgy college lane t'internet is down again, which means I'm just sitting here writing this on notepad thingy-ma-jig, and I don't have anything else to do.

I suppose I better sign off for the moment, might go and watch Shaun of the dead now... will chuck this up ont t'internet when it comes back up.....whenever that will be."

I have no idea what is wrong with me. I just feel worthless, unmotivated and drained. I feel like i'm plodding along with no real purpose. Perhaps it is things that have happened in the past coming back to haunt me. I mean the fight with my dad before I came back to uni was nothing compared to what we've had before, but he did say things which cut deep, and confirmed a few things for me. I suppose that might have something to do with the way i'm feeling.... a bit of a failure.

Its kinda like a new years resolution, keep THAT side of things to myself, other people don't deserve the burden.

Today I stayed in and did some work, i'm glad that I did a bit, but its nowhere near how much I should've done. I need to start working hard, I messed up my A' Levels and I don't want to make to same mistakes here at uni.

Today i've been quite reflective, I've got alot going on in my head, and as i've resolved not to open up, it needs to stay there. But at least I can offload onto this if it all gets to much, which... to be honest, it is at the moment.

I'm feeling the lowest I have for a long time, I do think I can keep pretending to people anymore... But I have to try, for their sakes more importantly than mine.

I'm off to make a drink, I will carry on thinking, and I may post later tonight.

"event","Here we are again back at uni. It was good to see everyone again.

I'd like to think that I could do the whole, new year, new start thing.. problem is, I try that every year, and it gets me nowhere. 

One thing I've got to do though, is keep it to myself. There is no point talking to other people about my problems, its just not worth it, I only end up pissing them off or making them miserable, and thats the last thing i want to do. 

I'm going to try and help other people, my problems aren't that important, i've never been that important. I know some of them have issues, and I'd like to try and help if I can.

I keep asking that quiestion, where did it all go wrong? but maybe thats because its never been right, I don't deserve to have a happy life, so why should I, thats just my selfish attitude.

I might post last, but at the moment, i'm a bit drained.....

"event","Three hours ago I was happy.. Now i'm a wreck again! What is wrong with me!

WHY I CAN'T I JUST BE LIKE THE OTHER LITTLE SHIT WHO DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS!

Tomorrow is the last day of Uni, and we're going to a big party, i'm really looking forward to it. But at the moment, I just feel so down, with no one to turn to .... and this time it really is no one. I'm finding that I tend to be too trusting, and I just get burned... 

..Time to bottle it up more Jonno. In some ways Uni has been the best and worst time of my life. But I can't quite articulate why yet, because I'm still trying to work it all out in my head.

I can't keep putting on this happy face, sooner or later (it has once) its going to slip in public and I don't want my friends to see that.

Whats left!? NOTHING... oh well, plough on i will... I always do!"

"event","Well I find myself here again, due to the fact that I can't talk to anyone else.

Why do I keep feeling like shit, no matter how often I get ""Happy Spells"" they come crashing down at some point. The more happy I am, the worst it is aswell.

I feel jealous of people for stupid reasons, and its wrong. People keep saying that other people's opinions don't matter to you, BUT THEY DO. Its whats defined me for the last 6 years.

I do have good friends here at uni, those ""friend-for-life- types. Although sometimes I feel like its one way, all me taking and none of me giving, which makes me feel like a burden... (AGAIN). 

All to often I am seeing things which remind me of bad points in my life, someone may even say something as a joke but it cuts deep, and I dwell on it. I need to let go of some of these things, I would love to, but I can't... because I'm weak. I'm not as GOOD AS ALL THE REST OF THEM!

I have been thinking laterly, what is the point. Why the hell am I here?! A song sums how I'm feeling up right now.... 

""I don't care if it hurts, I want a perfect Body, I want a perfect soul. I want you to notice, when I'm not around, you're so fucking special, I wish I was special. But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, what the hell am I doing here. I DON'T BELONG HERE!"" (""Creep"" Radiohead)

if I don't belong here... where do i belong.   I've lost the ONE thing that used to give me comfort, and I don't think I can get it back, I'm past help!

WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER!"

"event","Well I've decided to try and give this another shot. I don't really know why, maybe I just really need someone to vent to occasionally, and laterly I've been burdening close friends, and that something I really hate doing.

I had a really bad night last night, one of the worst for a long time. I'm still feeling the side effects of it today, I just feel like a bit of a tit sometimes. I'm scared that IT is happening again, but somehow I think that if it happens now, it will be worse than last time.

Perhaps its just the combination of being in a new environment and missing my family, and my ""old"" life. Sometimes I do wonder, why I bothered coming to uni and do I really belong here.

I've met some really good friends - but sometimes I just get paranoid, I think that everyone hates me. etc.... Its complicated, and If I could write down what I feel inside, as I go around trying to be happy-clappy jonno, I would.

Certain things are bugging me right now, serious things. Things that were so important to me before, have suddendly dissapeared, every week I keep thursdays free, and every week I fail to go. Just another thing for me to fail at I suppose.

I miss people at home, I miss people like Oli, Lizee, Naomi, Kev etc... who I had a great time with, especially during my gap year.

Where did it all go wrong Jonno?!?!

Time to do some more soul searching tonight... before I put the happy mask back on for tomorrow stint!"

Yes I've gone back to be a depressed wreck again, bugger. I was determined to change at uni, new start and all that, but I guess that somethings are too hard to move on from, and somethings are determined to stay with you forever...no matter what you try.

Sometimes I just feel like ""What the hell are you doing Jonno, yet again you've messed things up""

Hmmmmmmmmm, Oh well

Sorry to depress everyone!"

"event","Yes as the name suggests, I have run out of food. me and Kate are going to ASDA on wednesday morning, so tomorrow I've got to have cocopops and cup a soups all day. NICE

Today has been a boring day, boring with a capital BOR(e). Nowt has happened, except for the funny lecture we had this afternoon. There is someone in our class who ALWAYS asks stupid questions, he was on top form today with three questions. Idiot.

Anyway, Might go to sleep now. I need to actually get up early tomorrow rather than my usual lie-ins. Need to work on this stupid philosophy essay. arrrgggggghhh I HATE IT

"event","Woke up this morning with a massive hangover. So went back to bed.

It all stems from the wonderful thing here at uni called ""Silly Saturday"". Our saturday last night, was silly!

It started with a quiet drink down the Ele, those present were: Myself, Karen, Steve, Ian, Ian(Steve's Neighbour), Karen's BF Ben, and Turps turned up as well.

We then went down to the font, and everyone had a good time. Highlights of the night include, Steve finding out he was an Uncle and deciding to drink even more. Steve coming back from the toilet twice saying ""I've just been sick"", Steve tipping beer over his head in his drunkened state. Very Steve orientated I know...but everyone was on top form.

I tried, once I finally got up to do this philosophy essay. Didn't try for long though, as it is really hard. Gave up, will try again later in the week.

Anyway, Laters Innit Bruv!

PEACE OUT!"

"event","Well as the title suggests today has been REALLY boring.

To be honest, I'm not sure why i'm doing this live journal thingy. I don't think I'm interesting enough to write something everyday. But, I'll give it a go.

Had a bit of a lie in this morning, which was nice. Finally made myself get up, by rolling out of bed at 11oclock. (Its quite nice having all but one hour, of my lectures in the afternoon).

Decided to go and do some washing. I must have picked the washing machine who was having a bad day. With 6 minutes left, it started getting really loud, and I MEAN LOUD. Everyone else was looking at it, we all thought it was going to explode. (College lane people. don't use 5 from the left)

Tonight is St. Trinians. I was going to go, but then I though nope. Don't know why, I get like this sometimes. Its a real effort for me to go out, I suppose it stems back to things in my past. I made a sort of resolution to start over at uni....but its quite tough. Probably go out tomorrow. POUND A PINT!

Anyway, Run out of things to say.

Bye"

Today I didn't really do much. Got up stupidly early to go to a Statistics lecture (BORING), then went to DH's LRC to see if anyone loved me, but I had NO email. :-(. Then a nice little philosophy lecture!

I'm feeling really ill at the moment, I think i've finally got the ""fresher's flu"" which is going around. :-( I also feel quite down at the moment, probably just because I've got loads of my mind. Oh Woe is me!

Anyway, Can't think of anything else to write about. So I will end it there.

Thanks for reading."

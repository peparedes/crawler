"event","i am a sleepy, sleepy panda. and getting a bit antsy because i really need to get on my way back to school. home has been nice, if a bit tiring. i'll be back next weekend, anyhow.

came home friday night and met the fam for a pseudo-birthday dinner for mom. i reassured her that we can start subtracting years from here on out if she'd prefer. got a new book, as i am wont to do, although i'm still in the midst of the one i started at the end of winter break. which i really ought to finish because it's actually really good. i just don't read much during school...maybe i'll set aside some time each night before bed. 

speaking of bed, i need to get to sleep earlier tonight. 4 am is a time i usually see only when i'm trying to finish up some paper the night before it's due. but, all in all, the night was worth it. went out to the 40 watt and met christina and a few of her friends for the modern skirts concert. good concert, although i would have come a bit later than 10.30 if i had known the modern skirts wouldn't be on til closer to 12. the opening acts were pretty good, but i was hella tired already from working in the house most of the day. still, definitely a fun concert. when it all wrapped up, it was about 1.30 and christina and co decided we should hit up the grill. apparently, a majority of the drunk students downtown also thought this was a good idea, so it took quite a while- although it was totally worth it for the strawberry milkshake and good company. christina's friends were a lot of fun. didn't leave there until about 3.30 so it was right after 4 when i hauled myself through the door and into bed. 

and then up at 8.30 this morning to help mom with horses. we were both sore from working on the house yesterday [and my feet hurt from standing in flats for 3 hours at the concert] so it was kind of a chore. but not so bad. hopefully we'll be leaving soon to go into town and pick up paint for my room and hers, and then i'll be on my way back to agnes land. to do all [or at least some of] the homework that i haven't even looked at this weekend. blah. but yes, bedtime will most definitely be well before 4 am tonight. because i'll be an utter zombie-bitch tomorrow if it's not.

hope everyone else had a good weekend. :)"

"event","the academy is and the cab [well, actually, beckett and sisky from tai and alex deleon and ian from the cab] came and played a really small concert at eddie's attic today. tiny, tiny show and so awesome because of it. me, esther, and shea went. they played some awesome covers [""hit me, baby"", ""santoria"", ""working class hero"" (john lenon), ""gone"" (nsync), ""brick"" (ben folds five), and a verse or so of ""hotel california""] along with their own wonderful songs. there was much chatting between songs and story telling. it was all highly amusing, especially the guys from the cab. 

an example of such amusement was all the comparisons of william to various famous people. alex told a story about how a waitress was utterly convinced that he was johnny depp. which led to a list of other people he vaguely resembles, among them jack from titanic [especially with the button down, suspenders, and hat he was wearing], prince caspian, and an unspecified-jonas brother. so, on the vein of famous people, beckett goes ""i just want to throw this out there: i think i should have been cast as edward cullen"" to which everyone responded quite enthusiastically. a response which gained greater enthusiasm upon alex's comment that he should have been bella. because, damn, i would definitely have gone to see <i>that</i> movie.  

afterwards, we waited around outside the bus [like the pseudo-stalkers we are] to get autographs, etc, after the show. alex came out first, signed autographs and all that, and then serenaded us from inside the bus through a window. and after a long wait, beckett finally appeared and was his darling self. esther and i went to go take a picture with him and he stuck out his hand and looked at me expectantly, so i took it and said ""hi, i'm jessie"" to which he replied ""i'm william"" which was adorable, since i obviously knew who he is. and then he told me he liked my jacket, that it was nice [or cute or something...i don't recall exactly] and there was some internal squeeing. and then we talked to him for a bit, telling him how much we enjoyed the show, and he was so genuine and nice and just kept talking to us. i think he would have stayed talking to us for a while, but we made sure he went to go talk to everyone else, too. it was just so cool. he spent time with everyone, talking about all sorts of random things. such an utter sweetie. 

so, yesh. i &hearts; william beckett like whoa. he's such an utter sweetie and adorably awkward and i want to take him home with me. i wants a william of my own. to go with the brendon i will also someday have. and they can just be adorable together and make me happy when i'm down. because they totally would."

"event","so we were watching 'the fast and the furious: tokyo drift' because it came on and cody was like 'dude!! awesome cars!' it was entertaining, if not spectacular. han was kinda hot. too bad he was was kind of shady. but my favorite part was probably at the end when the main kid was suddenly 'drift king' and a new guy [vin diesel] shows up in an american muscle car [plymouth roadrunner, apparently] to challenge him and it turns out he knew han. now, tell me this doesn't just sound laden with innuendo:

kid: Nice ride. 
vin: I won it from our friend Han a few years ago. 
kid: I didn't know he was into American muscle. 
vin: He was when he was rollin' with me. 

pfft. seriously? i dunno, maybe i'm just warped, but it's so easy to see. and then after that the kid says ""you know this ain't no 10 second race"" and vin diesel says ""i've got nothin' but time""...and maybe that's more of a stretch, but come on.

"event","well, happy new year, i suppose. it's been 2009 for a whole day now, so i guess i'm a bit behind. o well.

spent new year's with mer, watching dr who, playing laser tag with kitties, and lamenting the stupidity of boys who don't answer phones. we had champagne at midnight, after fighting mightily to get the thrice-damned cork out- nearly had a heart attack when it finally shot out of the bottle. pretty chill evening, but nice overall. all the other athens kids when were doing other things [like being in patagonia or packing for rome or snowboarding in west virginia- lucky bastards] or else there might've been a bigger get together. 

so, i don't usually do the resolution thing becasuse, hey, i know myself well enough to know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and a lot of them are probably mine. that being said, here are a few of my good intentions for this year:

- work out more often, aka stop sitting on my lazy ass
- dedicate more time to school work outside of class and less time to procrastination
- readdress ""pietas"" paper in a less than cursory manner
- get a job- either something around decatur, or get recertified to ref
- write. 
  - finish the story i started a year ago for a friend [and haven't finished because i fail at plot]
  - attempt to flesh out [or, you know, <i>come up with</i>] a plot for werewolf story
- find somewhere to live for fifth-year
- meet new people, aka quit being shy awkward panda

i guess 'graduate' should be on that list, but that's not a good intention, it's going to fucking happen. because if it doesn't, i have no idea what i'll do with my life. so we're going to just put it down as inevitable and hope i don't royally fuck up. 

well. there you have it. and i'm off to bed. ta."

"event","so. grades are in. managed to do fairly well- 3.667 semester gpa, whoo. still not enough to pull my cummulative up to a 3.5 by the end of the year, mores the pity- no hope for cum laude, it looks like. would've been nice.

came out with an A in greek, but i figured i would- 97 going into the final was a good indicator. according to blackboard, i got a 100 on my final, but i don't see how that can be right- i left a blank for a word in one of my sentence translations because i couldn't remember it. and i really figured i must have made a couple other mistakes. so now i want to see the final. i'll ask sally when we get back, i guess. 

B+ in latin, but i kind of thought that would be the case. my grades in that class- quizzes, midterm, etc- were never high enough to really make me think otherwise, although i did manage a 90 on my final [which i would like back- i wonder if dw is going to send them to us]. i had hoped that i could maybe manage an A-, but o well. i'd probably do better if i devoted more time to my homework and review. bad habits, hard things to break. there we go- new year's resolution: spend more time on latin. maybe i'll stick to it. 

and rounding up the semester, i got an A- in abnormal psych. which was actually a pleasant discovery. i had figured somehwere in the B to A- range, but i didn't want to get my hopes up for an A-, so i figured on a B or B+. i'd really like to know how i did on the final, but alas, dr cooley doesn't post anything on blackboard, so i don't know. i suppose i could ask her, though. we'll see how much i really care when i get back to school. 

well. there it is. i officially have one semester left. only two required classes left- latin elegy and greek 102 are the only things standing between me and my bachelor of arts in classical language and literature, with a little psych on the side.

"event","just realized that all of my spring courses are on m-w, or m-w-f. dear god. i have classes at 11 [greek 102], 12 [plato and aristotle], 2.30 [latin elegy], and 4 [linguistic anthro] on mon/wed, and my 11 and 12 o'clock classes on friday. at least i'll be pass/failing one of those classes [probably philosophy]. and i'm planning to audit another [gender in antiquity]- which will actually be tues/thurs at 11, so maybe i won't be a completely useless blob. and maybe i can set up some time to meet with sally or abbot or dw each week [or every other] to work on my pietas paper from last year, so that i can use it as a writing sample for grad school. bonus points, because it could totally work with my gender in antiquity class, even if i'm only auditing, since it's mostly about women as avengers. hmm. must consult sally about this. 

anyhow. break has been good. christmas was nice- mostly got clothes that i already knew about, so no real surprises. got a pair of boots that i'm thinking i might return because i'm starting to doubt i'll really wear them. got three new scarves, which were kind of a surprise, especially since i'd been eyeing one in the store and had no idea my mom got it for me. sneaky person, she is. also got a pretty, pretty watch from fossil. i tried to find a picture to post, but i can't find it online, and i fail at taking actual pictures. meh. it's pretty. so there. 

also, family arguments are fun. and by fun, i'm not sure what i really mean. because, honest to god, i think me and cody both enjoy it when we aren't actually trying to pummel each other. because it's come to blows, or almost blows, at least twice over break, and once he gets strong enough to break my grip, i might be fucked. hopefully by that point, we won't be getting in those kinds of fights. but, when we're just arguing, we get into this banter-argue state that i think we both actually enjoy, as twisted as that might sound. i think that might be why we both argue so damn much with the 'rents. well, golly gee. 

okay. so. off to go read books i have procured from their respective retailers- or rather, the one, since reading two books at once sometimes leaves me confused. and then beddy-by time. ta, lovelies! :)"

now, have to pack up my life [well, most of it], load up the car, clean up the apartment, and head home tomorrow morning. 

but! tonight i'm out to a concert with stone. acdc, bitches! details later. :)

::edit::

so. concert was fun. getting there was more effore than we'd counted on. mostly because we got stuck for like 15 minutes on marta [by 'stuck' i mean stopped, not in a station] for god only knows what reason. and then we missed our stop because a couple of drunk guys who were headed to the concert as well got in our car and one decided to talk to us. so, we had to get back on marta and go back a stop. but after that, we were golden. 

the seats were like ridiculously close, especially for somewhere as big as philip's arena. granted, we were off to the right side of the stage, but it was still pretty sweet. and i think i'm half deaf, although it's coming back now. ears are still ringing like woah. i don't really know a lot of acdc songs, especially their newer stuff, but it was hella fun. 'back in black' and 'all night long' will always be awesome. and for older guys, they can still rock pretty damn hard. the guitarist had this insane solo that just wouldn't quit. despite the fact that the whole time i was like 'please don't have a heart attack or something' because he definitely looked like it was possible. also, did a bit of a strip show for us, and performed half of the concert without a shirt. kinda ick, but not as bad as it could've been. 

all in all, a nice way to close out the day. although now i have zero motivation to pack, etc. thinking i might start on it a bit, at least fold my clothes and all, and then do the rest in the morning. sleep sounds really good right about now."

i had planned on taking greek today, but after my 4 hours in the library yesterday, attempting to make flash cards of all things relevant, i was a little burned out. and a little scared out of my mind because i hadn't really realized how much shit i have to keep straight. also, there is a reason i don't make flash cards, and it starts with 'p' and ends with 'erfectionist.' because if i mess up the grids or fail to account for some little thing, i've got to start all over again. i don't seem ocd, but the weirdest shit brings it out- like artsy/aesthetic type things. thought i'd gotten over it in high school, but apparently not. 

but anyhow. have decided to put off greek until...sometime later. like i don't know when. tuesday at the latest. bah. since i didn't take greek today, i did latin instead. which was okay, but i know i'm going to get shit for not including enough latin quotes in one section of my essays. ah, well. it's submitted, so nothing i can do now.

what made it even better was that later, kenny chesney came on stage to perform and mom goes, ""is he gay?"" again, ""...what?"" apparently, kenny chesney fulfills my mother's expectation of 'gay man' which cracks me the fuck up. dad mentioned something about him being with renee zellwegger [or however the fuck it's spelled] but mom argued that obviously that hadn't worked out. but then i pointed out that she looks like a chipmunk, and i believe the matter was settled. mom's still not convinced of kenny's heterosexuality. i guess i can see what she's saying, but really. it was just random. and kind of bizarre."

"event","so i've been thinking fifth year, and feeling pretty sure about it, but i'm starting to reconsider a little. because, really? it doesn't make as much sense as i was thinking at first. half the reason i was thinking fifth year was because, hey, finding a job right now is going to be not easy. and somehow i just thought, if i'm still a student, i don't have to worry about it and tuition's free, so...but really, not so logical. because i'm still going to be supporting myself after this year and if i'm at school that cuts down on the available time i will have for working. even if tuition is free, i'll still have to find somewhere to live and pay for that and food and all the other random shit i buy...so i dunno. i mean, fifth year probably will help my future prospects for grad school, because more latin and greek certainly won't hurt, and it would definitely be good to get a foundation in german. and, yes, that will be my schedule if i stick around at agnes: latin 3-something, greek 2-something, and german 101. i'm going to confuse the fuck out of myself.

i just don't know. i mean, job, of any variety, is going to be high priority. because my parents have been wonderful and have completely supported me up until now. they've paid for four years of college, left me with no loans to pay off, given me a car that's completely paid off, and supported all manner of extraneous spending. but after this year, i'm pretty much on my own. if i'm doing fifth year, or at the very least, if i stick around the atl area, chances are i'll be able to find people to live with and therefore cut down on that area of spending. whereas if i just up and go somewhere else [which part of me seriously wants to do], i'll be either finding some totally new and random person to live with [kinda scary] or living on my own, probably in a shoebox. meh.

- go to abnormal [2.30-3.30]
- game vs lagrange [3.30-7ish]
- astronomy lab...? [8-10, if i go...]
- latin quiz [augh!!]
- latin homework [doubl augh]
- probably something else that i'm forgetting

...but i am le tired!

seriously, tonight is not going to be fun. i mean, homework-wise. i'm totally down for the game, despite the fact that i am <i>sore as fuck</i> from my workout with jamenda on monday morning. note to self: think about how hard you work out when you've a game two days later...dumbass. goodness. i have almost 60 lines of latin to go over/attempt to prepare for tomorrow morning, and a quiz to take which i am not at all confident about, on top of which, i'm supposed to go to lab at 8. i'm thinking with the amount of shit i have to do, it's just not going to happen. that's 2 hours of my life that could be spent working on all this other shit. 

so, this is how it's really going to happen [hopefully]:
- abnormal
- game
- dinner w/parents
- shower
- library
- disinfect carrel [because apparently people with the death enjoy sitting there and coughing all over it...ich]
- hole up in said carrel with latin text/dictionary/etc until work is done or the library closes
- sleep"

"event","no wonder there are so many jokes about livejournal and emo kids. if my posting were any kind of marker, the jokes would be pretty spot on of late. and i say this preparing to launch into another post of emo, although i'll try to keep this one brief.  

this weekend = utterly hellacious. i mean, there were some redeeming factors, and i did enjoy the team bonding, but i am all for team bonding that doesn't include a 6.5 hour drive to mississippi of all godforsaken places, 2 losses, 2 injured players, and at least 4 players with some sort of stomach bug. i mean, <i>fuck</i>. the bus ride home was especially not fun, as that was when 3 of the 4 players actually got sick. ich. my poor girls. 

we're down to something like 14 whole and hale players, including mk, which means we've only 2 field subs. amber sprained her ankle at saturday's game and ashley did something to her knee early in today's game. me and laura were trying to decide if this is some kind of karmic retribution for some utter fuck up, because it really has felt like the universe has been shitting on us since the season started. which is especially not cool since i really do love this team and we're all getting along better than any team has since i came here. it's like we gave up the drama only to get fucked otherwise. we need a win, for serious. i'm hoping that one victory will perhaps be the catalyst we need to get the season on a more positive track. hopefully peace will give that to us on saturday- which is finally a home game, thank the gods. 

i should probably get going to bed. we finally got back to the apartment around 11.30 but i was too awake to go straight to bed after my shower. 

maybe the next update will be full of sunshine and rainbows. here's hoping."

"event","has anyone located the reset button for this semester?? because i would dearly like to find it right about now. for serious.

<lj-cut text=""cut for serious whinging"">today has just been a day full of Not Good Things. and you know it's serious if i'm actually capitalizing shit. when i get down to specifics, it doesn't seem as bad i think, but it is. trust me. it was probably all kick started by the fact that i did jack shit this weekend until yesterday and even then, what i did was finally unpack [after being here for two weeks...] and not the gods awful heaps of reading i should have done for classes. so i was unprepared for classes today in general. on top of that, i stayed up til nearly 2 am trying to get reading done for my 9.30 latin class, completely ignoring the fact that a) it would make me tired and b) we've gote a game today and 6.5 hours of sleep isn't fucking enough. so i've been half brain-dead all day and was not able to take the nap i was banking on after lunch because i'd forgotten about the epic class i'm auditing. so no nap yet, although i'm planning on that in a few.

but! the cherry on top of today's 'fuck you' sundae was one of my girls quitting the team. i'm not naming names for those of you out there who would recognize, and if you think you know, kindly don't spread it around just yet. i only talked to her briefly, but she explained some of what's going on and i understand why she wants to stop. she's dealt with a lot in the past couple years because of soccer and she's really lost her desire to play in recent months. thing is, i <i>understand</i>, but that doesn't keep me from feeling upset, betrayed, and just downright pissed off. i <i>understand</i>, but that doesn't necessarily make it okay with me. i have a fundamental problem with someone commiting to a team, and a team which relied heavily on her experience at that, and then backing out of that commitment. it was something my parents drilled into me from a young age, and i can't help but balk at those who can just walk away. i know it's not that easy for her, i know she's struggling some with it, and i really do get why she can't take it any more....but i can't help my frustration at her decision. i guess the silver lining here is that at least she's leaving before the season has truly gotten underway and not leaving us in the lurch at the conference tourney. and i want her to be happy, but i want to be selfish and keep her on the team as well. it's my senior fucking year, goddammit, and i just want things to work out!! but shit just keeps falling apart and i'm not sure what to do to keep things together. 

so i apologize if i'm not a little ray of sunshine in the near future. i'm just so tired of all of this. </lj-cut>"

"event","soooooooo today could have been better. i suppose it could have also been <i>worse</i>, but i think i'm glad it wasn't. just lots of little irritations, but isn't that always the way? so, allow me to list said irritations, if only to make myself feel better for the venting.

1) tornado siren going off at 8.15 this morning. seriously? if the inclement weather could please restrict itself to reasonalbe hours, it would be greatly appreciated. 

2) dropping $657.70 on new tires and alignment this morning. dad put $600 in my account for this sole purpose, but it was still quite disappointing to know that it all disappeared [and then some] before it really even settled. so now i'm down to something like $100 and i still need a couple books, but i don't want to ask for more money given the recent amounts i've spent on stuff for the apartment and gas. ich. we'll see how far i can stretch it. 

3) multiple failed attempts at setting up our wireless router. laura swears she was mostly through with it and then the program closed somehow without her permission and now we can't get it to work for anything. she's worried that maybe she established the name and password and now we're locked out of it because we aren't sure what the password set as. and the router resisted all attempts to rectify this, so we're calling in someone who knows wtf they're doing soon- i.e., tara's bf or rachel- hopefully they can get it sorted. 

4) practice. just gernally speaking. ich. keeper work wasn't really keeper work, but hand drills/games, all of which i failed at today. and then we went into a 4v4 game and played kind of ickily, which got coach pissed/frustrated [a state of being which is most enjoyable, let me tell you]. and <i>then</i>, just when we were starting to put it together better, fay decided to fucking dump the sky on us and mk almost got taken out by a falling goal much like i did a year ago. coach was seriously upset so we just called practice and everyone went up to the building, soaked like we'd been dumped in a pool. also had a talk with coach and aimee about our line-up and formation, and we think we've settled on something new that might make up for the fact that we've lost a couple of key players this year. we'll have to see how that works out. 

i guess four things doesn't seem like that many, but there were other little things, too, if you want to get technical. like my cleats still being wet from last night, my room still being unorganized and not unpacked, the drawer liner sticking to itself when i tried to get it into my dresser drawers, and various other little ickies. meh. i suppose i should stop bitching about it. 

well, i'm going to go chill for a while before bed, maybe get my soggy practice gear into the wash, and then hit the sack. classes start tomorrow! luckily, i don't have anything until 11, so i won't be getting up stupidly early."

"event","have officially moved back to agnes and it's definitely nice to be back and have some sense of space and privacy. the mattress in the corner of the kitchen was beginning to grate, if only because i'm so accustomed to having space to myself. haven't really begun the ordeal of unpacking. but, seriously, who am i kidding? i probably won't be completely unpacked until i've been here a month, although i'm going to try and make myself. we shall see. waiting for beacham and tara to get here so we can make an ikea run and buy pretty things for bathrooms, etc. 

this weekend was fairly enjoyable despite being absolutely ridiculous at times. laura borrowed my car saturday to run a 5k and got a flat, so me and esther drove over so i could call AAA and have them come change it. i had a spare, but no jack and i have no idea how to change a car tire [something which will be rectified the next time i go home] and besides, that's why we have AAA. but that ate up a good chunk of time. so now i've got to get my tires changed- the needed it anyhow, as low as the tread's been worn. but then driving back esther almost got sideswiped by some asshole who wasn't paying attention and started drifting into our lane. 'twas quite scary. 

and then yesterday, the car troubles continued. jana drove me, esther, and laura to target yesterday for random shopping and some things we knew we needed. we spent the better part of 2 hours there and were leaving for esther to get back to a dinner with oc, and me and laura to go out with the soccer girls. only problem was jana's car wouldn't start. luckily there was a guy who pulled up right across from us and had jumper cables, so he jumped the car and got it started again. but <i>then</i> as we were driving out of the parking lot, it died again. so we had to put it in neutral and another guy helped us push it out of the way. we called AAA again [esther this time, since jana doesn't have it] and settled in for a wait. the AAA guy said that the alternator must be shot because even if the battery is dead, once the car is started, it's the alternator that keeps it running. so jana went with the tow truck and me, esther, and laura tried to find someone to come pick us up. ten phonecalls later and laura finally got one of our soccer girls, just as one of our friends pulled into the lot, so we ended up hitching a ride with her. but all in all we were at the target shopping center for over 4 hours yesterday- 2.5 of which was waiting. ich.

on top of all that fun, there have been lots of athletics/soccer things. like bowling yesterday afternoon. and dinner at coach's [mae's pregnant!! i think we're all almost more excited than coach]. and we started 2-a-days today. which is always fun- 7 am for an hour of fitness and then 5 pm for practice with balls and such. the fitness this morning actually wasn't as bad as i'd thought it might be, and i'm excited to go practice tonight. i can't wait to see what our new girls look like when the get back into the swing of it. everyone's touch on the ball is a little off right now, but i think we've got a pretty promising team. maybe not as deep skillwise as last year, but pretty solid at least. and all the girls seem enthusiastic and have been getting along really well, which is encouraging. i think it'll be a fun year, at the very least. 

anyhow. have some errands to go do now. bookstore and then lunch. and then perhaps a nap and just relaxing before practice. we still have to set up the tv, but it shouldn't take long. but really, i'm done rambling now, so i'll be off. have a good day! :)"

1) ryan lochte's lips look ridiculously kissable
ii) packing last minute is a bad idea [well, i already knew that...but it was reinforced]
c) the olympics are ridiculously distracting when trying to pack last minute


must set alarm and hope i can drag my ass out of bed and dig up that power-packing-gene that i've got somewhere. i packed up my entire dorm room in like 4 hours my sophmore year. half my shit never got unpacked this summer, so i'm banking on getting it done quicker than that. and on that note....

"event","so i was once again lazy and slept in rather than getting up to run, but i feel i was justified. not only did i work my ass off this weekend [painting etc yesterday and yardwork on saturday- mowing a lawn with a 40 degree incline is a <i>bitch</i>] but it is now that wonderful time of month and i woke up this morning with a headache and cramps. working out was not going to happen. but i've got keeper stuff tonight, so i won't be a complete bum all day. 

in other news, i now have enough books to keep me happily occupied until christmas, or possible longer, since i don't read that much during the semester. i'm in the middle of one book [and it's <i>fantastic</i>] and i've also got the sequel to it, and then i've bought 3 others in the past week. i'll probably finish <i>ink and steel</i> and <i>hell and earth</i> before school starts up, but i'll have the others to read through the semester. yay! :)

also, a [random] word of warning: post trail mix crunch is not as fantastic as it would like you to believe. it looks yummy on the commercial and on the box and then you pour it into a bowl...and face disappointment. not nearly enough yummy granola clusters. and it gets soggy in like 3 seconds and turns into mush with raisins and almond slices. not even yummy mush. gah.

not only am i not surprised, but i am in fact quite happy. i think it's a pretty well known fact that i'm probably a bit more fond of remus lupin than it's appropriate to feel for a fictional character. although, my conception of remus is probably more fanon than canon at this point. meh. werewolves are pretty kickass. especially when they're remus lupin [who, in my brain, looks more like david wenham than david thewlis ;)].

in other news- i move back to agnes in a week. i will admittedly be glad to get away from home [cody's about to drive me up a wall with all his extraneous noise making and refusal to stop when i ask] although i will miss my lazy days of summer. and it'll be nice to start soccer back, even though i'm a bit worried about my fitness. i've got myself running in the mornings again and i've been doing keeper stuff 3 times a week, so i'm not a completely lost cause. but my mile time [which i only just started taking because i didn't have a watch until last weekend] is disappointingly high. like, i should be running at least 1.5-2 minutes faster than i am. i'm hoping that when i get on a flat, even track, i'll drop some time, since the hills and gravel road are certainly not helping matters here. i doubt it'll look good for the senior captain to be coming into camp unfit, but i can only do so much in the next week. so, it is what it is, i suppose. 

also, i was happy to discover that i won't have to spend 5 billion dollars on text books this semester thanks to my lovely friends who are willing to share! so i'll have my books for astronmy, abnormal psych, and potentially greek. i'm still debating whether or not to actually buy the greek book. in any case, i'll only have to buy my latin books, the martian chronicles [for astronomy- which totally kicks ass], and my greek grammar/dictionary. which will hopefully total no more than $100. sharing for the win! :D"

"event","&nbsp;today was interesting. got my arse up to go run, so that i could get back to the house before baseball boys got here, because i get red-faced and sweaty and very unattractive when i work out. thankfully i made it. so then i showered and came back out to help clear the porch so the boys [q, kyle, jeff, and george]&nbsp;could paint the front of the apartment.&nbsp;there were various pieces of wood [unused trim, flooring, etc] piled haphazardly around, providing an ideal habitat for creepy crawlies. 

thus begun the great spider hunt.&nbsp;

besides lots of teensy, relatively harmless spiders, there were at least 5 black widows,&nbsp;along with at least 4 egg sacks. ich ich ich.&nbsp;&nbsp;because i am a complete pansy about spiders in general, and deadly ones in particular, i made sure i was well protected. namely, soccer socks and my knee-high mucking boots for to protect my little toesies. and so i became the spider stomper with much flailing and 'eee'-ing. i'm sure it was an amusing sight.&nbsp;

it was actually kind of fun though. i ended up spending more time with the guys today than i have before. me and cody went to lunch with them [fresh-air bar-b-q, yum yum] and i got to talk to them a good bit. discovered that i actually really like q- he's fun/easy to talk to and honestly smarter than i had initially thought. so now i feel bad for presuming. still a fan of george, though a little of the 'oo, shiny' has worn off. although, i think he's greek [or half? his mom is from what i can tell] which is pretty hot. i mean, he's a new yorker through and through, but i can see the greek in his features now that i know that's what it is. and greek boys are often quite pretty. yum.&nbsp;;)

anyhow. i should be going. need to get into bed earlier tonight so it's easier to get up in the morning. the guys are coming again, probably for the last time, and my folks will be gone a little before they get here, so i need to&nbsp;make sure i'm back from my run and&nbsp;not in the shower. night, lovelies!"

"event","went to see 'made of honor' with sarie tonight. quite enjoyed the movie- i'm just such a sucker for chick flicks. who knew patrick dempsey could look so young without his 5 o'clock shadow and different hair.&nbsp;i almost believed he could be a college student in that first scene.&nbsp;and&nbsp;the ending- talk about dramatic, but still so sappy and fantastic.&nbsp;i blame disney and chick flicks for my unrealistic desires for a fairytale ending. i don't say expectations, because i'm not that naive, but i still cling to a sliver of hope that i can find one of those ridiculously fantastic men [even flawed as they are sometimes].&nbsp;*le sigh* <br /><br />also, i was ridiculously excited about the snippets inside the met- i want to go there like burning. just re-emphasizes how completely i have succumbed to my classics dorkery [not that i've been lacking such confirmation- i bought a pretty silver ring the other day&nbsp;because it reminds me of a laurel crown]. the brief flashes of statuary had me all excited. <em>such</em> a dork. especially after that greek and roman art&nbsp;course last semester. only&nbsp;reinforced my belief that museums are pretty much the coolest places ever. right up there with libraries. ...i sound like the life of the party, don't i? ^^; <br /><br />randomly- there's been a veritable light show of lightning out here for the past two or three hours. like, huge webs spanning the horizon and lighting up the night. sadly, there has been little in the way of rain, which is what we really need. <br /><br />anyhow. i've updated twice in one day now, so i'll be going. ta, lovelies."

"event","&nbsp;had to go to the dentist this morning since i haven't been in a while. usually hate the dentist because i almost always have at least one cavity, although often more like 2 or 3. annoyingly, my little brother, who eats more sugary sweet things than me and doesn't always remember to brush, has never had a cavity. where i was gifted with my mother's bad teeth, he got dad's perfect teeth, the brat. held true today as well and i'm going back to get my one cavity treated tomorrow. one bonus for today was that i didn't get the red-headed devil-woman technician.&nbsp;she's actually really nice, but she is vicious&nbsp;[or 'diligent,' as mom likes to say]&nbsp;&nbsp;with those pointy scraper things. i always end up with a headache when she's through. but i got the nice blonde lady today, so my mouth doesn't completely hate me.&nbsp; 

have now not gone running in two days- yesterday because i got up at 7.30 to help mom with horses out at leslie's [which takes at least 2-3 hours] and this morning got up at 7 for my 8 o'clock appt. and now i've got another appt in the morning, so that might screw me up as well. thinking i'll&nbsp;might try to go this evening, or at least get up tomorrow before my appt and go, since it's at 9.10 instead of 8, so long as i leave myself time to shower. shall see.&nbsp; 

hmm. what else? no progress with baseball&nbsp;boy, because i am chicken shit and can't say anything. besides, if he's leaving in a week or two&nbsp;what's the point? besides getting over my ridiculous shyness. meh. anyhow, i think the division tournament is going to be hosted here, since right now the pirates are winning it, so at least there's a few more games for me to watch him. although i sometimes like the games that he doesn't play better, because then he's sitting out by the field and there's more potential for interaction. a couple of my friends came out last weekend and both agreed that he looks over towards me a lot, although with them there, it could have been for a different reason, because sarah and tegan are both really pretty. but i like to hope i was still part of why he was looking over. :) 

gonna go check on the horses and look at the paint samples we've got up in the house. might go see a movie at the $2 theater later with sarie. otherwise, it's laundry and chores today. fun times."

"event","went running this morning- 1 mile and half mile of sprints between mailboxes. also did some crunches when i got back. feeling better, now that i've got myself started. planning to do at least the mile and crunches&nbsp;every morning. i need to mix in some other core workouts and ball work, but at least i'm getting some stuff done now. also realized i should call coach and get some updates on next season, since&nbsp;as far as i know&nbsp;we're still lacking an assistant coach and i have no idea who my co-captain is. so, yes. must call. 

the boys came out to the house again today, but sadly george was not among them. actually, only kyle and cedric came out today. george, q, and canada were supposed to come, too, but ended up having other things to do. someone's girlfriend was in town, someone had to pick someone else up at the airport, and i have no idea what else they had to do. i've been hoping all day that the girlfriend in town was anyone but george's. because he's totally been flirting with me. i mean, maybe not really obviously or whatever, especially by other people's standards, but it's really kind of thrilling, considering how often this kind of thing happens to me [i.e., very rarely- which is mostly down to me being too shy and unwilling to put myself out there, so i can't really complain]. gah. i should not get wrapped up in this, for a variety of&nbsp;reasons:&nbsp;1) i'm not&nbsp;sure he's really interested, 2) my dad would give him hell, 3) he'll be gone in 2 weeks or less, and there's probably more that i'm just blanking on. besides which, i never feel like i'm the type of girl those guys date- i don't wear lots of make up&nbsp;or spend&nbsp;much time with my hair and chances are my outfit doesn't involve short shorts or&nbsp;pretty shirts and isn't some crazy designer brand and i'm not a perfectly tanned size 6 or smaller. dunno. just saying those are the kinds of girls i always notice around ballparks and i don't fit the bill. maybe he doesn't care- he's a total sweetie from what i've seen. so, a girl can hope, right? 

in other news. i've been working on my story idea [alt history/fantasy with werewolves and rome], just basics, but i'm really kind of excited about it. who knows when i'll ever get around to actually writing it out, but i'm proud of where the concept is heading. i've been doing some background research into the mythology surrounding romulus and remus and i think i've got a pretty interesting idea going. i'm going to keep fleshing it out, then move onto characters and plot, since right now the plot is a vague idea at best. if i could stop reading other things long enough, i might eventually get around to writing. we'll see how that works out.&nbsp; 

so. off to go do something else. work a bit more. go to bed so i can haul my ass up and workout again in the morning. rah."

"event","also, in totally random news- i loathe thistle and fire ants with a burning passion, as they seem to have formed some sort of unholy union in attempts to completely overrun our pastures. trust me, two hours of picking off thistle heads so the gods-be-damned things can't spawn will result in similar feelings of hate, especially when the ants crawling all over the plants then become ants crawling all over <i>you</i>. gloves are life savers, but my feet were not so lucky. mrg.

but! on a happy note, i have just been informed by amazon that they shipped my two books and i should have them on tuesday! without my laptop i've been doing a lot more reading of physical books rather than digital. but a character [well, two really, but mostly the one] in the book i'm currently reading has pissed me off so severely that i had to put the book down for fear of tearing it apart. stupid girl was fine when she was an unrequited love interest, but then the wench had to go and decide to return the boy's feelings and muck things up completely. bitch. i liked her well enough before she decided to go and have sex with him, but she's squarely on my black list now, not in the least because half the reason she's getting closer to the boy is so that he'll confide in her so she can keep tabs on him. it's complicated, but she's [partially] using him and it pisses me off. in any case, i obviously am getting too involved, so i'm looking forward to the arrival of my shiny new books to distract me- the fact that the two male leads eventually end up together is only the icing on the cake. ;)"

turkey just beat croatia in pks, after the craziest overtime i've ever seen. 

<lj-cut text=""recap"">i was pretty sure it was going to end up with pks after watching most of the second half when neither team really capitalized on the few opportunities presented. so then, two 15min halves of overtime [no golden goal] before pks. croatia scored in the 119' when rustu [the second string turkish keeper (their first string is out because of a redcard in the last match- he decked a guy completely off the ball)] came out for a ball into traffic, failed to win it, and was beaten on the shot trying to backtrack into the goal. so everyone's thinking, 'dude, 30 seconds left, croatia's got this.' but lo, the referee adds one minute of stoppage time, and turkey scores in the 121' minute of play. seriously, who <i>does</i> that?? to which the answer is apparently 'turkey' since this is their third come from behind win in the tourney- they scored 3 goals in the last 15 min [2 of the 3 in the last 2 minutes] of their game against the czech republic to win 3-2 and move on to the quarterfinals against croatia. 

so then, pks. croatia starts it off bad by missing the first pk, just wide of the goal. and then missed wide again on their third pk, after making the second. turkey made all three of their pks, setting them up 3-1 when croatia stepped up to take their fourth, and potentially last, pk. which rustu blocked, cinching the win for turkey. as much as i think pks suck, it sucks even more when you've lost pks because you've missed the goal, rather than being blocked by a fantastic save. just puts the loss more squarely in your own hands, you know? you can't say, 'o, the keeper made a fantastic save- i've no idea how he got there.' you're stuck with, 'well, shit. i fucked that up.' sucks either way, for sure. i alwlays want to hug the poor boys afterwards- it's so sad to see them so down. 

croatia was my pick to win this game, and i was pulling for them, so i'm kind of sad they lost. but, i also think that perhaps germany will have a better shot against turkey in the semis [germany lost to croatia in group play], and germany's my team. although, with the random miracles turkey has pulled out of thin air, i'm beginning to think that turkey might be more to worry about than i thought. three goals in the last 15 versus czech absolutely floored me, not only because the czech defense is usually quite tight, but because petr cech is pretty much considered the top goalkeeper in the world right now. so i dunno. maybe i should be worried about this match. in good news [for germany] turkey's had 10 yellow cards and one red, which means players [key players, at that] will be missing their semifinal match. still, i think they definitely shouldn't be taken lightly.</lj-cut>

now i've got to make sure i watch the netherlands v. russia tomorrow. the netherlands is one of my other top picks and they've been on fire this tourney, so i'm definitely interested in seeing how they come out. i'd like to see them and germany in the final. don't want to miss the match tomorrow because russia could potentially pull an upset and beat the netherlands, like germany did with portugal. hm. also need to watch spain v. italy on sunday, although i don't much care about the outcome there. i suppose i'm pulling for spain. so, hey, atlanta folk- i'm probably going to be showing up early enough tomorrow and sticking around sunday to watch the respective games, if no one minds terribly. ^^"

"event","okay. so because best buy is best buy, my laptop has to be sent off to the service center to confirm that there is actually a hardware malfunction [the fan hasn't come on in almost 3 months- it's <i>broken</i>] before they'll approve the exchange. so it could be two weeks before i have my own laptop again- potentially one, but i'm not getting my hopes up. 

in good news, the new laptop i get needs to be of equal or lesser monetary value, and since i'm pretty sure we spent something like $1000-1100 on mine, i can get a pretty sweet upgrade for the same price range. definitely looking forward to that! <i>and</i> it doesn't have to be the same brand, so i can get something that isn't an hp and maybe won't have ridiculous malfunctions. any particular recommendations from the techies out there?

"event","<lj-cut text=""rambles: week in review"">hope friday the 13th treated you lovelies as well as it treated me. found lots of pretty things at target that i don't need, of course, but i resisted temptation and didn't buy anything. mostly because i'm going to make other people buy them for my birthday. yay! went out to best buy to scout external hard drives and believe i have decided on one. mom and i are going to head out there tomorrow and buy it [and maybe one for my dad for father's day] so i can get all my stuff backed up. i've got to take my laptop in, yet again, but good news that i also found out today- i get a new computer! well, that's supposed to be how it works. this will be the fourth time i've brought it in for hardware replacement [3 mother boards, 1 lcd screen, and now my fan] and geek squad has told me that fourth time's the charm and i get a new laptop. now, i had thougth this meant a refurbished computer, but the guy today told me i actually get a brand new one, like, off the shelf. kind of excited about it, although i had been planning on getting a new one after i graduated. i suppose now i'll just wait a couple more years, since this is free, and who would turn that down? so yes. good day. 

now, recap since i've last updated. keeper camp was last weekend. good experience, but i'm definitely glad i can sleep to my heart's content now. i didn't even do half the work that the campers did, but i was tired and sore and decidedly sunburned. damn my pale irish skin. well, not so pale now, except for everything covered by shirt and shorts. and socks and cleats, but i'm hoping i can fade out the sock tan. despite the <i>gods awful</i> heat, the weekend was pretty good. the kids were fun to watch, and it was neat to see improvement even over such a short period of time as the weekend. have discovered, however, that i don't think i'm really suited for coaching. i can work well with individuals, but i'm not sure i've got what it takes to run a team. might in later years, but not at this point in my life. i will admit, however, that any kid i work with would probably get irritated with me- i tend to harp on the technicalities a lot. i mean, developing good fundamentals and form is key to further success, but i worry that sometimes i get too focused on it and don't offer enough encouragement. i do enjoy working with kids, though, and i do know what i'm talking about, so i just need to find a balance between critiquing and encouraging. 

in other news, we've had a sick horse on our hands for the past week, although it's beginning to look like she's actually been sick for a while but only recently started really showing signs. she's dropped a lot of weight, been off her feed, been feverish, and had diarrehea for the last week or so. we're beginning to think that something's wrong with her teeth, and hopefully we'll have the vet out here tomorrow to check. he came out a few days ago and gave us some meds to start her on and keep her fever in check. we thought she was getting better wednesday, but she sort of regressed yesterday. mom's been in knots over if loki will come throught this alright. hopefully, if it's her teeth, once we get that sorted, things should look up. but i guess we'll just have to wait and see. 

haven't been doing a lot lately, except hanging at home, doing chores, and running errands.  been watching a lot of pretty european soccer, but not as much as i could, i suppose. euro2008 started last saturday, and i've watched a good few matches, but i've yet to see germany play, much to my disappointment. i've been a big fan of the german the past couple years, so i'm excited to see what they can do in this tourney. it's still group play [and wow, that sounds dirty], so the real competition has yet to start, but i'm definitely looking forward to when it progresses.  

anyhow. i guess that's it. birthday's wednesday, but i don't really think we've got plans, though we'll probably at least do dinner out. haven't really talked to my girls here, but i figure we can at least go out for drinks or something. next weekend i'm headed in to decatur to have birthday dinner with beacham [hers is a day before mine] and friends and drinks at the chocolate bar [tiramisu martinis sound fantastic]. should be fun! :)</lj-cut>"

"event","so. nothing too exciting recently. saw indiana jones [got a little sci-fi, but i still enjoyed it] and ironman [totally my new favorite superhero- reformed playboy + snarky + hot + genius + kickass superhero = 12 kinds of awesome]. still no job, which is probably good since we started painting [by which i mean priming...no pretty colors yet] and probably will be for the next few weeks. helped mom with horses this morning and yay! for the summer schedule. means we lead them in from pastures instead of out of the stalls which means we don't have to muck stalls- not that i ever had to do that. i think mom was afraid if she made me muck stalls i would stop going with her every week. 

birthday in a couple weeks- woot! the big 2-1. which is seriously bizarre. i should still be 17 or something, not legal to drink and a senior in college. geh. 

also, <lj-cut text=""book meme"">stole this from <lj user=""maderr""> like 3 or 4 days ago.

<b>1. One book that changed your life.</b>

mmm. maybe <i>the giver</i> by lois lowry? i read it when i was 8 or 9, but it's one of those books that just sticks with you. makes you want to think outside the box and question the status quo. i reread it a couple years ago, and it's just as meaningful now, if not even more so.

<b>2. One book that you've read more than once.</b>

<i>the black swan</i> by mercedes lackey- hands down my most reread book. 

<b>3. One book you'd want on a desert island.</b>

hm. good question. something i'd enjoy and be able to reread. maybe sarah monette's labyrinthine series...because i'm totally pretending that they're all one book. at least <i>melusine</i>, since i think i could reread that a few times and still enjoy it. and i think it's one of those books that you probably pick up a lot more details when you read it again. 

<b>4. One book that made you laugh.</b>

<i>good omens</i> by terry pratchett and neil gaiman- seriously hilarious, if you can take a tongue in cheek approach to religion. aziraphale and crowley are one of my favorite literary duos. 

<b>5. One book that made you cry.</b>

first thing that comes to mind is <i>order of the pheonix</i>- there have been others, but that's probably the most recent. my darling sirius!! TT-TT yes, i cried. nyah.

<b>6. One book that you wish had been written.</b>

i'd like to see someone write the book i've got in my head, because i have serious doubts about my ability to actually sit down and do it myself. i think i'm good at conceptualizing, but not always actually realizing the idea. i love supernatural stories, especially those mythical or folkloric in nature, and especially werewolves, although not so much what they've become in modern mythology. basically, it's a different take on werewolves and it's set in ancient rome. it's been buzzing around in my head with myriad possibilities for the last few months, but i'm awful at sitting down to write. meh. maybe i'll get some of it started this summer. 

<b>7. One book that you wish had never been written.</b> 

hm. this is kind of hard. rare is the book i've read that i truly dislike, but even in those rare cases, i wouldn't say that i think the book shouldn't have been written- merely that i wish i had never actually read it. maybe <i>the world according to garp</i> by john irving- i've never actually read all of it, but that's because the parts i have read definitely squicked me. i'm sure there's some book out there that is absolutely vapid and something i would be apalled had ever been written, much less published, that would fit this more aptly, but i have yet to come across it. 

<b>8. One book you're currently reading.</b>

<i>the lightning thief</i> by rick riordan. young adult novel about children of the greek gods and their presence in modern society. it's a really interesting premise, and i like a lot of it, but i think i'd enjoy it more if the protagonist was older than 12. even so, it's pretty fun, but i set it aside about a couple weeks ago and haven't picked it back up- i'm bad about that sometimes. 

<b>9. One book you've been meaning to read.</b>

i have a laundry list of books i've been meaning to read, but i'll go with <i>the mirador</i> by sarah monette. i've read the first two in the series, but haven't yet gotten around to reading this latest. i <3 mildmay like no other.  

<b>Bonus question: What book scared you the most?</b>

a few books have freaked me out, but probably it was one of those compendium of ghost/horror stories that it was cool to read when you were a kid. hated those damn things. i make it a point to avoid things that will scare me, since it's a pretty easily accomplished act. i'm a complete pansy about horror flicks, and i'm much the same way with books, although to a lesser degree. i'm far too good at imagining things into reality and becoming ridiculously paranoid. </lj-cut>"

"event","i've come to the conclusion that a deciding criterium for where i end up living is going to be the presence of a good coffee shop, preferably of the independent, non-starbucks variety. don't get me wrong, i do like starbucks, but given the opportunity i'd much rather give my money to a hometown shop like joe's. besides which, joe's makes better coffee in my opinion. kind of wish i could just transplant a joe's, but i suppose that's just silly. it's just so nice to walk in and see people who are genuinely happy to be working there and enjoy talking with customers. they've got a stamp card for each coffee/drink you buy and you get a free coffee when you've got 10 stamps- and they always give you the most expensive drink free, if you're ordering more than one. and if you're a regular, they often give you multiple stamps for one drink [and you always get two on double stamp tuesday]. and cute baristas are a definite plus, although my new favorite is a couple years younger than me, but not jailbait, so nyah. he's just such a sweetie and he makes such good caramellos! i do so love joe's. makes me sad that i can't go every morning, since we live so far out now. so yes, i definitely need an good independent coffee shop wherever i end up. :)

now that you've wasted 5 minutes of your day reading this, i'm going to go and try to find something to do. joel mentioned movies yesterday, but i'm not holding my breath since i haven't heard from him yet. maybe i'll dig out that book i keep meaning to start..."

"event","sad panda. chelsea just lost the champion's league final in pks. it was 1-1 after 120 minutes of play [plus stoppage time] between manchester united and chelsea. i came in during the first few minutes of the first 15 minute overtime. so many opportunities that just didn't come through. all the way to pks, which i still maintain is a shitty way to determine the better team. pks are like 45% skill, 40% luck, and 15% sheer nerves, both on the part of the keeper and the shooter. gods, i always feel bad for the losers, no matter if they were my team or not. and in this case, it was my team. peter cech simply amazes me and i dearly love half the chelsea team.

pks go best of 5, with each team guaranteed 5 chances, and move on to sudden death [one-to-one, so if you miss and they make, you're out] after the 5 if things are tied. looked like chelsea was going to take it, up 3-2 in pks with a save by cech, then 4-3 as the next two made their shots. the last man u player made his as well, with john terry coming up for the final chelsea pk to clench the win. he missed and it wasn't even that he shanked it- just as he was swinging through, his plant foot slipped and the ball veered just wide of the goal. van der sar was no where close, he dove the opposite direction, so it was obvious terry would have had the goal if only he hadn't slipped. but this only meant that both teams were tied at 4 all after 5 pks, so it moved on to sudden death pks. both teams went a round, tying 5-5. man u's giggs made his, giving them the lead at 6-5, which was just what they needed when van der sar blocked anelka's shot for chelsea, securing the victory for man u. 

i seriously wanted to give john terry a hug. no doubt he took the loss on his shoulders, since it would've ended with his pk had he not slipped. he was obviously upset. a lot had been riding on his shoulders, being team captain and such a steady and reliable player. i'll say it again- pks are shit. i can understand the point, since everyone was dead tired after 120 minutes of play and it can't go on forever, but i still hate them. it doesn't lessen the sweetness of victory, but sometimes i think it deepens the pain of loss. o well. i still love chlesea, john terry and peter cech espcially. i'm sure they'll be looking good next year as well. 

now, just gotta start keeping up with euro2008 and find me a team to follow. 

also- totally random, but my last grade finally got posted. A- for myth. so i came out with an A, A-, and B, which only raised my gpa a smidge, but still better than nothing."

"event","<lj-cut text=""so, grades came out today"">i've known what my grade for latin is for the past 3 or 4 days, because abbot actually uses blackboard, unlike half my profs, and had our finals posted as soon as he was done grading them. i was a bit disappointed in my final exam, but i knew walking out that i had done rather poorly. in my defense, i spent almost the entire first hour freaking out about the possibility of an honor court case because i'd asked to leave my bag in the dispensary- we aren't even allowed to bring bags into the building during finals, but i didn't really want to abandon my bag in the library for 3 hours when i had my debit card, cell phone, and apt keys in it. so yes. freaking out and not focused. i'd like to think i would have been more successful otherwise. even so, i don't think i could have raised my grade much above the B i got [maybe a B+ but i don't think i could've made an A-] so no harm done, really. 

anyhow. was pleasantly surprised by my grade for psych. thought the best i could possibly hope for was an A-, which i wasn't actually expecting. figured i'd come out of there with a high B+, so imagine my surpise upon seeing an A, a good-solid-no-minus-attached A. quite a nice surprise, i must say. i do wish i knew what i made on the final and that project, since by my calculations, i would have had to make at least a 93 on both to get even an A-. sadly, blatchley has only posted the first two test grades for the course on blackboard, nevermind the grades for test 3, the final, and our project. hopefully she will, sometime.

a little curious to know what i actually got on lynn's final, but he is one of those profs who doesn't even pretend to use blackboard for grades, so i guess i'd have to ask him to find out. i passed the class, which is all i was really looking to do, so no worries there. i'm sure my final grade was in the C-range somewhere, but luckily, it matters not to my gpa. thank the gods for pass/fail.

now, i'm just waiting for mythology. i'm thinking i should have at least an A- locked in that class, since i had an A- going into the final and i think i did pretty well. maybe it'll be another nice surprise. i would be irritated that my grade isn't up, since they're due today, but i figure dw deserves some slack since she popped out a kid two weeks ago. i'm sure nico has been a distraction from test grading. maybe she'll actually have them up by the end of the day, but i'm not too worried. </lj-cut>"

"event","home now. finished my last exam wednesday at 3.45. finished packing in a frantic mess thursday morning. 'checked out' at 9.30am [which consisted of turning in my apt and gate keys, since we were technically supposed to be checked out by 10] but didn't leave until something closer to 12.30/1ish. picked up the munchkin from school and met my girls for grey's and a show downtown that night. was nice to see everyone again, especially since xtina is leaving for china for 3 months tomorrow. 

drove back in to agnes friday night for graduation saturday morning and finish getting all of my shit home, since some of it was left there knowing i'd be back. watched boondock saints [seriously love that movie..connor is fucking hot] with my agnes girls and had breakfast with jana at chick-fil-a before graduation. was nice, although a bit hot in the sun. saw my lovely graduates for a few minutes afterwards and then back to the apartment for frenzied packing and the realization that i'd left a hell of a lot more than i'd originally thought. yeesh. 

anyhow. home now for good. still wishing i'd managed a reason to stay in atl, but i can't argue with the money issue. it's just too damn expensive to rent my apt for the summer, even if i had a job, when i could stay home for free. sad that i'm not closer to my darling esther and whoever else happens to be around- jade for some, jana, tara...would like to be spending more of my summer with them, but alas. it was not meant to be. plan on going in when i can, but i can't help balking at the amount of driving i'll do this summer with the way gas prices are now. filling up my jeep makes me want to cry. and staying home doesn't actually cut down, but rather increases the amount of driving i do. living 30 minutes outside of athens is certainly a downside to this place. o well.

the new house now has walls. by which i mean there is sheetrock up rather than open framing. it does not mean that we've moved out of the apartment up the hill, sadly. once we decide on trim and doors and paint colors, it should go rather quickly, since we're hiring people to paint so that it doesn't take another year. but, if you know me, you'll know how indecisive i can be, and i do not hesistate to tell you that it's most definitely either an inherited or learned trait. so this could be a while. pretty set on wanting my room green and my bathroom blue...but what specific shades, i'm not sure of just yet. also have to help mom figure out what she wants, especially in the dining room/living room/loft area, since they're all basically the same space divided up, which means the colors have to work together. and the kitchen is kind of connected too, so...should be fun. if by 'fun' you understand that i mean 'interesting', which really means something more like 'a pain in the ass'. 

anyhow. enough rambling. i'm off to read a bit more and maybe see if i can't get myself to start on one of the many writing files i've got sitting around half finished...i'm starting to think my muses have abandoned me. they'll stop in just long enough to get an idea planted, but then abandon the seed. eh. o well."

and then there was beltane! which was fun, but i definitely crashed not far into it. apparently 'tired jessie' is similar to 'emo/sulky jessie' and so i was asked by multiple people if was okay and what was wrong, followed up by questions today of if i was feeling better. promise i'm okay, darlings. i was seriously just exhausted and feeling more introspective than social. was still kind of tired/blah today, but it's all good. 

i've only got 3 exams left [latin, religion/magic/science, and psychology] which i'll be stretching out over the next week. yay for self-scheduled exams. think i'm going to take latin tomorrow since it's going to require the least amount of studying. also need to start packing, which is a seriously daunting idea. sorting all of my shit out of this apartment..oi. but! leaving most of the kitchenware that's mine with esther since she's staying here this summer. so, that's one less thing to really worry about. and i'm applying to stay late and volunteer at commencement so i'll have a couple extra days. 

ah. this turned out a hell of a lot longer than i meant. o well. suppose i'll go look for that article on cicero and read up for tomorrow, maybe start some packing...or maybe just sit here and watch tv.

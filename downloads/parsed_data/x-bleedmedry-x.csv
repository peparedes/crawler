"event","Fourth of July weekedn with the boy was awsome!

Friday- went to Fiddlers Hearth with some kick ass ppl! Had some cider and listened to Mossy. Bonfire was fun and we were going to camp out in my Dad's tent, but it was way to cold to be sleeping on the ground. So the wusses that us girls are, wanted to go inside and sleep...and that we did.

Sat- went to breakfast. ""Doomy!!!!...or is it Doomie?""   Then we went shopping at the Irish Import shop. Bill got a new ring. It's nice. We then headed over to Mitch's house and grilled hot dogs. Me and Bill left early due to his massive headache. Poor boy.

Sun- LAKE w/ Bill's fam!!!! It was fun. I didn't go swimming but it was nice just sitting on the boat taking in nature and all that. We cooked out again for dinner, lol. It was a good day.

Mon- Breakfast with Bill's Mom and Sis.....back to Bob Evans. EVIL! But the food was good. We then went to see War of the Worlds. Good movie. Can't remember much of the book, so really can't do to much comparing. Good special effects though. Afterwards me and the boy just hung out and watched TV.

Today I go back home to no job and doing who knows what. And I have no idea when I get to see the boy again. He is gone next weekend and I the weekend after that.

 

CONGRATS TO MY LAURA ON HER ENGAGEMENT!!!!!!!

Love to all my MC and non MC peeps. I miss you all!! *Especially you Trish!!!!!*

 

 

//edit//

So I must admit I'm jealous. Me and Bill have been going out for almost 1 year and 2 months and yet Laura is engaged. I thought for sure after Trish's wedding I'd be the next one to at least get engaged. I'm not ready to get married.....but I will admit finally that I am ready for the next small step.

I'm ready for planning

I'm ready to be his forever

I'm ready to live with him

 

I'm not ready for the bills

I'm not ready for the debts

I'm not ready for the responsibilties or for working...

"event","<P><EM>It's getting down to the end of the year and after convo today I felt like I've been needing to do some reflecting. I know I'm not a senior yet and don't have a full four years here to relfect on.....but it needs to be done.</EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>While I've been Here</STRONG>:</EM></P>
<P><EM>I've learned so much about myself and the real world and about friends. I learned there really are those few who you cerish and will always help you up once you've stumbled. I'm glad I've finally found some of those. There are also those ones who like to play games and act one way then suddenly show you who they really are...even if its not direct. To those asses I say thanks for the lessons learned. To those who I care so much about and who really have been there for me I give shout outs:</EM></P>
<P><EM>Susan: Thanks babe for the summer and being there when I really needed someone to vent to. You are amazing.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Laura: Not much to say cause I think you know how I feel.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Erin and Chrissy: Thanks girls for being there for me and know I'm there for you. Can't wait to live with you next year.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Ang: Babe we've been there for each other and always will be. </EM></P>
<P><EM>Ae Rin: Babe I love ya and thanks for hearing me vent when I need to</EM></P>
<P><EM>Rah Rah: You are a doll!</EM></P>
<P><EM>Kat: I love ya and you are so awsome....thanks for a wonderful year.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Amber: Well.....we've been through a lot together this year but all in all I still love ya and hope to keep in contact with ya.</EM></P>
<P><EM>TJ: Nothing to say...you know it all...half the time you know me better then I know myself. I love ya and you really are like my best friend.....now its time for you to come visit me <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/winky.gif"" width=15></EM></P>
<P><EM>Bill: I LOVE YOU. Thanks for being there and sticking with me for a year. I know we went through hell, but we made it back and have a stronger relationship then ever. My soulmate.</EM></P>
<P><EM>J: You kick major ass!!! Thanks for listening to me vent and a mjor thanks for helpping me in january when I needed someone the most. I love you!</EM></P>
<P><EM>Sarah: Thanks for REALLY letting me vent when I need it. You are so awsome!</EM></P>
<P><EM>Eric: What can I say....you were there for me lastyear when I really needed someone. Thank you</EM></P>
<P><EM>To all others who I love and have affected my life positivly, thank you from the bottom of my heart.</EM></P>
<P><EM>I've also learned a lot about other people. Some don't care what others think of them and others take it to much to heart. All that matters is how you percive yourself, how your closest friends see you, and how your family sees you. </EM></P>
<P><EM>I've also learned a lot about what it means for others to believe in you. Last year I was told by a prof of mine that I needed to get my gpa up and that he knew I could do it if I pressed myself more...he's seen it in my course work. That made me feel ...well I don't know how to say it. Amazed? My family has always believed in me and my parents have always tried their hardest to push me to greatness and it worked in high school and for the most part here.....but to have a prof say that is just something new and different, and yet wonderful. </EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>About myself</STRONG>:</EM></P>
<P><EM>I've changed a lot since coming here 3 years ago. High school I was the little innocent know it all girl. Thank goodness I lost that stereotype. I've learned a hella lot about myself and gone through a lot of changes. I realize I'm not always right and not always the perfect one to come talk to about problems....and I realize now what it means to actually have my own issues. I've been depressed and yes maybe to the shock of some of you thought about cutting myself. That is all in the past for the most part. I've learned to change my views on how people act. I've learned to except the changes that some of my close friends in high school have taken. I've also majorly realized and changed how I deal with things. I'm letting a lot of old baggage go as well as new. I've had many new experiences and tried many new things that have helpped me reshape myself as a person. I'm trying as hard as I can not to get into other business yet still trying to be there for them when then need it. </EM></P>
<P><EM>I've kinda also realized how much some people mean to me. Dealing with the death of my Grandpa was hard....still is hard as fucking hell. I just don't know how to deal with it yet.....he was the first in my family to die since I have grown up and become an adult and really had to deal with things. Its a whole new experience and well I really don't like it. I know I change that but hey...its a thought right? I plan on keeping those close to me very close to me..otherwise I wouldn't be me. My friends and my family make me ....well me. <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/happy.gif"" width=15></EM></P>
<P><EM>This place has really helped me mature to a whole new level and I'm very happy with it. My family has even noticed it. I've become a little less indepentdent and secluded this year. I actually go out and have fun and get to know more people. When I came here after highschool, laura was the only one I knew and thats how is stayed for a while...I was just to scared to meet new people. That has changed now and I've very glad. Hell if I hadn't come out of my shell and flirted with Bill last may day...we wouldn't be celebrating one year this friday!!!</EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>About life</STRONG>:</EM></P>
<P><EM>It's a crazy ever changing thing that can't be taken for granted. And I can already tell I'm not ready for the real world. I'm scared to death of what the real world means. Job....working....no life.....BILLS! (the bad kind <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/winky.gif"" width=15>) Oi, its not something I want to deal with yet. I really am not ready.....yet I'm ready to get done with school and school work and drama and shit. BLah. Is there a limbo I can crawl into?</EM></P>
<P><EM>Otherwise I've noticed that life is a hard thing to deal with. So many things to deal with and....I don't know. I have a feeling and can't figure out how to convey it. Oh well.</EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Relationships/Friendships:</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM>Not something to take for granted. Not all friendships last as long as you'd hope or as long as you thought. While here I have lost contact with my close friends from highschool. It kinda sucks...but at the same time I'm happy about it cause I found some of the most amazing people here. And most of those that I lost were due to actions basiclly against me. I do still harbor bad feelings toward some.......but time will help me deal. It's not as major as it once was. But here I have also learned more about friendships and what NOt to do....right Twin? <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/winky.gif"" width=15>&nbsp;Sometimes it takes loosing cool people for a little while to realize the mistakes you make. </EM></P>
<P><EM>Relationship.......some of them are just shit. I've seen a lot of bad times though my friends....but also some amzing ones. Some people just aren't ment to be together...and some just magically find that special person. I've dealt with my bad relationships......one that ended cause the of disappearance and the other...well it just wasn't ment to have that fairytale ending that we once thought. We have both moved on and I'm dealing the best I can with all the situtations that still arise from it.......but that doesn't matter any more....its in the past and I have my new life and am not that same person that he once was in love with...nor is he the same. But I have found that special person and it all came out of the blue and during a time when I actually gave up searching for someone and actually was starting to search again for God and who I was.......and that I have found with him. Thanks baby.</EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Love</STRONG>:</EM></P>
<P><EM>Love is not what I thought it would be. Yes, I've gone through it twice and each time it was different. My first love.....anymore that wasn't love...just lust. I really just wanted someone. I never had a boyfriend....NEVER till freshman year.....and then that wasn't even real. Love is not something you mess with. It is a feeling granted to us from a higher power and I'm very thankful he granted it to me now. I have realized that love is precious and sometimes requires time, selflessness and even seperation to work and finally show up in someone's heart. ""And suddenly I am where I'm supposed to be <BR>And after all the tears I was supposed to be here"" (superchick) I cerish this feeling everyday and everynight a thank Him for this wonderful opportunity as well as bringing the most wonderful man into my life. Bill you are my everything and I wouldn't be the same without you. I'm not going to continue cause you know how I feel...I tell you enough as it is. <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/winky.gif"" width=15></EM></P>
<P><EM>Wow....what a long post and a lot of deep relfectiveness....I think that is a new word. I'm sure there is more that i could say but it just isn't coming to me. Hope all is well with you!</EM></P>

"event","Nothing about school seems to fit anymore.....again. Yes I've said this before but something is different now. Lately I've been wondering ""What am I going to do after next year is over?"" Going to grad school or getting a job really have always been my two options.....but now I'm not to sure either of them are going to happen.

To get a job doing what interests me I either have to go to grad school to get marine biology training and experience.....or move to find a zoo that is willing to hire.....both costing money I don't have. I'm already in debut enough for picking a private school for my undergrad....

Plus, I don't think I can get into Grad school.....my GPA isn't the greatest..........I'm trying fairly hard here...granted I could always try harder but then I'd over work myself and have no life......and I need on of those to stay sane. And having no life would mean having no Bill........no way in hell I could do that. I mean....I must admit I've thought about it because of all the pressures and stress upon me.......having a relationship is a lot of work and at times takes me away from studying, especially when we are with each other. But am I really willing to throw away a years worth of wonder and amazement? Thats the question.......

But grad school means going to a coast...only place to find marine biology grad programs. Going to the coast means leaving Bill here so he can work at the job he loves....means 10 hours if not more away from each other....means no way in hell of seeing each other.....and money is a big problem. I have none....can't pay for housing.....can't pay for plane tickets to come home often to visit the rents and Bill.....hardly ever be able to see the wonderful friends I've made or even my family in Wisconsin......so is getting a masters in an awsome field with great opportunities in research worth giving that up? Why can't my path be so damn certain and already laid out for me? Maybe I may just have to give up the idea of Marine Biology........maybe go to grad school around here for something else in Biology........*sigh*  

*crying*

Ok....I need to get on to homework.....paying to much at this school to give up at least getting my undergrad degree"

So this morning I got a sad feeling. I realized how much I miss my best friend. He's a whole bunch of states away and I've only met him once but he knows me as well as I know myself. Its so freakin great. We seriously can read each other so easily, its kinda scary but funny at the same time. I love the boy. He has helpped me through so much. He was the one who got me through some of my darkest moments. His light has always been there. I'm so greatful for him. I'm glad I could also be there for him when he needed me. I wish I could be there for him more though, he has always been here for me. But its hard being so far away from each other. Some day my lil fox boy. :) Miss you bunches and thanks for always being there for me. You are the greatest and I don't know what I'd do without you. MINDY!!!"

I laid there and kissed your cheek so gently,
While you were lying there
I watched you breathe,
While you were breathing
You captured my soul,
And while my soul became yours
The best dream of my life came true."

Went and saw Joseph tonight and it was wonderful!

Then we went to Taco Bell and the fun began. Singing Ocean Avenue while everyone stares. Playing with a $1.00 bouncy ball in the parking lot and almost hitting cars and the street. And then Ben mooning Matt, who was following us. HAHA! It was great!!!

Other then that I think I'll soon go to bed or something.

I miss my boy"

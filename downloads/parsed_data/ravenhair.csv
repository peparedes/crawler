"event","<p>It's been...a few weeks...or maybe just one week. Whateva. Anywho's, had band camp this weekend, which was pretty fun. Froshed the juniors on Friday night and got very little sleep. Saturday was band all day, very tiring. Came home early this morning though, had some work to do back at home. Didn't really tell anyone cause I knew everyone would start freaking out and making a big deal about it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I got a job! And my liscense (I think I spelled that wrong...). I'm currently working at Starbucks (tomorrow is my second day of work, I'm really nervous). I've been driving around for a few days now as well. Took my test last Wednesday. It's pretty freaking awesome. I also got accepted to Mount Royal so that's pretty exciting. It all happened in like, two days, pretty amazing. U of A also sent me a letter saying that I've been awarded a 1250$ scholarship to their university, which would be awesome but I don't think I'm going to school there, so I feel kinda bad.&nbsp;<br /><br />Other then that everything has been pretty low key I think. I am freaking out about the job thing the most though. Whenever I think about going to work I get this knot in my stomach (the nerves) and keep thinking ""Why the hell did I get a job? I don't want a job"". But I think I'm gonna grow to like it, and the money would be awesome. So it's all going to work out&nbsp;(I'm sure).<br /><br />OMG THE OFFICE STARTS BACK UP THIS WEEK AND I AM SO FREAKING EXCITED!!!!! IT'S GOING TO ROCK SOCKS PEOPLE!!!!!</p>"

"event","Umm not&nbsp; a lot has been going on. It's been a pretty crappy week, and I'm really glad the weekend if finally here. Today was also a crappy day, so I left band early and came home. Haven't done much since then, except eat (haven't had much today). My parents are out at and auto show, and my brother and Lorne are over here doing...something. I really want to curl up on the couch and watch Heroes or something, but I'd feel bad cause it's sort of a family show. I guess I could watch Grey's Anatomy, but I don't know if my mom wanted to watch it as well. So maybe I'll just give them a call and ask.&nbsp;
I haven't been feeling very well lately, thinking about going to the doctor. I don't really know though, might just be all in my head. Hope everyone has a good weekend, Happy St. Pats!"

"event","So it's been like a month. I keep meaning to actually post something but I don't get around to it. The only reason I'm on the good computer is my brother is at a job interview (he might be working at Superstore).&nbsp;
Umm...today was a pretty good day I guess. The best part was when I opened my lunch and found....MINI EGGS! I don't even know where they came from! It was exciting. I ate them all during french. English was pretty dece as well, since we just watched a movie. Religion and social were less cool, but what can you do? Time seems to slow down at approximately 11:00AM. This is when social is about half way done. Takes forever.&nbsp;
I'm a little disappointed cause all my TV shows are currently on break. There was nothing new on last night except Scrubs, and it was a clip show. I really need to rent the first/second season again. So a friend of my mom's lent us the first three episodes of the show Heroes, so I might give that a shot. I don't have anything else to do except homework. I would have liked to do something with Mark but he is busy.&nbsp;
I don't really have anything else to report. It's been kind of a stupid week, so I'm glad it's over. I wish I wasn't just sitting on my ass though...

"event","So I'm in a really good mood. This is excellent, because it means I'm not stressing out about math and I'm not going to make myself sick worrying about it.&nbsp;I'm basically just going to post about Friday.&nbsp;

I came home Friday after the chem exam and was feeling really crappy. The exam went pretty well, but I was still feeling really...lonely? sad? tired? I don't really know. But I got home and my parents had gone out after work, so it was just me and Dyl. He was on the computer (as per usual) and I decided to listen to some music. I put in a CD I got for Christmas, put on some pajama pants and sat in my bean bag chair. I started to mellow out and then decided I should do something because I was starting to feel restless. So I pulled out this box from my closet that had a bunch of stuff in it from when I was still sleeping in the room upstairs.&nbsp;
This box was like magic. I popped it open and the first thing I spotted was a tiara. I immediately put it on and wore it for the rest of the night. This box was full of old pictures, old birthday cards, jewlery (all of which I also put on) and tons of other trinkets. I was laughing so hard at some of the stuff that my brother came in and asked who I was talking to. He thought I was a little insane because of the tiara. After I'd cleaned out the box (leaving the contents everywhere) I decided to watch a movie I rented called Dear Frankie. My brother left about then to a friends house. My parents came home soon after. My mom came down and asked why there was a tiara on the coffee table. I told her about the box and she laughed at all the stuff with me, and then wore the tiara. She also pinned&nbsp;my ""GIT R DONE"" pin on her housecoat.&nbsp;We watched Smallville (OMG LIZ IT WAS SO AWESOME. BEST EPISODE EVER) and some TV and mostly just hung out (my dad also joined us after making fun of Smallville). Afterwards I went to bed and read till 1:00am and went to sleep. Best. Friday. Ever."

"event","So I don't really have anything to say, except Happy New Year. I suppose. Not a whole lot has been going on. I'm getting started on lots of studying, math, physics and chem. For some reason times flies by when I'm actually doing work. You'd think it'd be the other way around. How odd!

Just finished a book from the library today called Just Listen by Sarah Dessen. It was really good. I almost cried during some parts, except I couldn't because my whole family was in the room. That would have been really awkward. It's a really good read, if anyone wants to borrow it/pick it up sometime.&nbsp;

I'm really kinda bored and I don't know what to do. To pass the time I'm currently listening to Alanis Morissette. I'm not totally sure why I picked that for some reason, but I did. I'm thinking that in a little while I'm going to watch some Scrubs, so that should be awesome. I finished watching seanson two of The Office, and it was awesome. The ending was SO GOOD. It made me feel very giddy. I heart Jim!!! He's awesome."

Not a whole lot has actually been going on. I've mostly just been lazing around watching The Office and Scurbs, and various other DVDs. For some strange reason I just watched A High Scbool Musical on family channel, even though I'd already seen it and decided it was the cheeziest movie in the entire universe. But watching it today actually put me in a good mood, so I'm not complaining!

I'm trying to think of something to do right now to avoid going back to my room and working on my math/physics. I'm thinking maybe I'll listen to some music? I'm really upset though because someone lost the headphone jack and I can't listen to music on my stereo at 2:00 in the morning. And I've been picking out cd's that I really want to listen to, and now I can't. *tear* I think my brother lost it. But no one knows where it is. So sad!!!!

I really don't have anything to update about. Like at all. Hopefully the New Year will bring a more...eventful year? But with good events. Not shitty ones..."

I watched Benny and Joon (Johnny Depp!!!), Bring it on, and Quest for Camelot (which hopefully isn't over yet, cause I'd like to see the end. I think they kiss at the end...).

I have discovered my weakness when shopping. No matter how hard I try, I can't resist notebooks. Lined paper, blank paper, hard cover, soft sover. I love them all. I didn't have enough money to buy anything today, but it was painful to walk out of that store. Also, I went into Le Chateau today, and had the sudden urge to buy a dress. They were all so pretty and cute and I wanted them all. Ugh I need a job so that I can go shopping. I'm dropping off a resume this weekend at a few places. Hopefully that goes well. P.S. We're also starting Secret Santa soon.&nbsp;

Otherwise not a lot is going on. Parade, party and concert tomorrow, and I'm really excited. It should be a good night all around.

The last one I watched was so...not depressing. It was happy. And that made me happy. Three cheers.&nbsp;

Got a movie date with Mark tonight which I'm looking forward to. Unfortunately, my brother decided on Thursday that he'd invite a bunch of friends over tonight as well. He's promised me they won't leave the upper floor or step foot in the basement the whole time, which is something I guess. I mean, it's not that big of a deal, but it would have been nice to be alone for a change (get you minds out of the gutters ladies, lol). But I'm hoping it'll be a good night none the less.&nbsp;

Not sure if we've gotten our report cards yet and I'm starting to stress about it. Within the next hour I'm going to be looking through brochures from around Canada to see if I want to go out of province for school. I'm so nervous for life after high school. ARG.&nbsp;"

""You're so 1990...and it's&nbsp;1994""

""I have a history of losing my shirt""
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
""And I know in my heart we all die, like the day&nbsp;and the night, like the sun in the sky""
""Mistaking lust for love""
""Made a deal, not to feel. God that's dumb....everybody knows the deal fell through""
""Tell her something in my hug needs her more then even clowns need the laughter of the crowd""
""Got those nice copper pipies...""
""She's seen her share of devils in this angel town""
""You're finding things that you didn't know, I look at you with such disdain""
""Up in my lonely room, when I'm dreaming of you""
""He smiles politely back at you, you stare politely right on through""
""Lay down a list of what is wrong, things you told him all along, and pray to God he hears you""
""He will admit to everything or he'll say he's just not the same, and you'll begin to wonder why you came"""

Post party was fun (slideshow was awesome) and post post was pretty memorable as well. School is okay, I'm really thinking about dropping physics. My teacher asked that I wait until we get at least half way through our next unit before I sign my sheet and stuff. Ick. I don't know why I bothered in the first place. But I guess this is just pointing me towards my future right? Now I'm absolutely positive I don't want to deal with physics.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I did the LIght the NIght walk last night and it was amazing. The weather was perfect, and the people I went with are people I haven't had that much of a chance to get to know very well. I had the most fun I've ever had in a long time. After band we all waited out in the parking lot deciding what we were going to do for dinner. The original plan was pizza, but Sarah ended up not even being able to go because she had work. So we all went to Shell for supplies and then to the train station because no one could drive down to Eau Claire. We were late, and sort of missed the dinner provided. We grabbed our banner and started marching behind all the other walkers. About about a minute we started the singing. We sang everything from Disney to Spice Girls to Queen. Tom and Kailee sort of hooked up, but I'm not sure what's going on with that. Either way, we had a total blast and it was all for a good cause. I really felt good about it.&nbsp;I'm hoping to do it next year as well, and hopefully we get just as good a turn out!!&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, I don't really have all that much to say, except I hope everyone has a great week!

Band has sort of started up, which is exciting. IT's weird being a senior, but at the same time it feels nice. People are counting on you. Met some new people which was totally cool. Good potential!!

Haven't really been up to much. Classes are fine. Don't really know what I enjoy. Chem is the easiest so far, since it's just review. Math should be fine, and physics...well, I have a fun class. This also means my marks could go down. A lot. Shucks."

Mel spend the weekend here which was cool. Went to the mall with her and Liz (bought many clothes) and then to the drive-in where we met up with Curtis. I had lunch with Victor on Sunday (entertaining!) and then went to Mark's house and watched Braveheart. 

Can't say I want school to start tomorrow, though I am looking forward to seeing people again. I could defenitely use another week though.

"event","So this past week has been pretty good. Went to Mark's cabin this weekend and had a pretty good time. Hung around at the beach, ate some good food, went swimming, had a fire, lit some fireworks. All in all a good weekend. My dad couldn't go (he had ball) and so that kind of sucked. But it was still a good time. 

It's sort of starting to sink in that once school starts I'm going to be seeing les and less of Mark. Football starts up right away and we have no classes together until second semester (in which we have one). He's going to be working all day on Sundays, and all this week is going to be training for his lifeguarding thing. Including band and school, and think the only time I'll be seeing him is in school. It kinda sucks. But at least I've got someone right? I shouldn't be complaining. :)

I think I'm taking my brother into the shcool tomorrow or Tuesday for his schedule stuff. Running some mindless errands tomorrow and I've got my first driving lesson on Thursday. Other then that I'm not really doing anything, and I'm pretty excited about it. Hope you all have a great week!"

"event","So it's been a pretty good weekend all around. I rented Buffy, V for Vandetta and Howl's Moving Castle this week to entertain myself. And I must say, if for any reason anyone wants to buy me a present, go out and buy Howl's Moving Castle. I LOVED it. Anime rocks. 

Dani and Suzanne were over last night, as were Kyle and Lorne. We had a good time, goofing off and what not. I'm pretty tired though, so I'll probably be calling it early tonight. Liz, I tried calling you to see what you were up to, but I called twice and no one answered. Sorry to have missed you, I hope you had a good afternoon. I finished my book today, which was amazing. Scott Westerfield is a fantastic author and I recommened all his books. The one I finished was called ""Peeps"" and it was awesome. Really interesting. And it teaches you at the same time! I've learned so much about parasites it's kind of disgusting. 

Well I hope everyone is having a fantastic week and I hope to see you guys at Dani's tomorrow! Except of course for Sinead (hope you are doing well!). LOVE!"

My aunts and cousins came out for the last week we were there. Chloe is talking lots and cute as a button. Aiden also talks up a storm, even if no one understands him. 
Sadly, my aunts dog Willow got hit by a truck on the highway on our last night there. She's at the vet and has been since Sunday. She had surgery, but she's not doing well. :( I don't want her to die. But you never know. She could pull through!

Haven't been doing a lot this week except hanging around the house for the most part. Hung out with Mark, Katie, Kathy, Steph and Alex so far since being back. Can't wait till the rest of you get back! Should be a party! 

Anyway, nothing is really new, so I guess that's about it. Hope you're all having a great summer!"

I've been having lots of fun out here so far, and we've only got a few days left. I'm coming back either on Saturday or Sunday, so hopefully everyone else will be back around that time as well. 
Stayed in Kamloops for the first three days and then went out to my aunts cabin till Saturday. Craig had some friends out (how I love his friends) and so did Katie (hers were a little intimidating). Those days were lots of fun. It rained yesterday so we went to see a movie (Pirates). It was awesome!! Loved it. 

Well, I'm starting to feel a little homesick, so I'm pretty excited to come back home. Hope to see you all soon! Laters!!!"

Still got shopping to do (so much) for both tour and presents. Katie, what do you want for your birthday? WHICH IS TOMORROW! ARE YOU EXCITED?!?!?!?!?! I am. I'll call you tomorrow!

Not much has been going on this past week, except studying. Ick. I saw Mark on Wednesday, had my lazy day on Thursday, was at school Friday and yesterday for math tutorials. Otherwise, I've been keeping busy by watching Scrubs and Veronica Mars. Oh so good. And listening to my new cd of course! I heart Three Days Grace!!!

"event","Cool pyramid: 
INNOVATORS - The first kid to keep her wallet on a big chunky chain. The first to wear way-too-big pants on purpose. To wash jeans in acid, stick a safety pin in something, or wear a hooded sweatshirt inside a leather jacket. Most Innovators don't look that cool. There's always something off about them, like they're uncomfortable with the world. Except there's always one thing that stands out on an Innovator. Something new. 

TRENDSETTERS - A Trendsetters goal is to be the second person in the world to catch the latest disease. They watch carefully for innovations, always ready to jump on board. Unlike the Innovators, they are cool, so when they pick up an innovation, it becomes cool. A Trendsetter's most important job is gatekeeper, the filter that seperates out real Innovators from those crazy people wearing garbage bags. 

EARLY ADOPTERS - Adopters always have the latest phone, the latest music player plugged into their ear, and they're the guys who download the trailer a year before the movie comes out. They test and tweak the trend, softening the edges. And one vital difference from Trendsetters: Early Adopters saw their stuff in a magazine first, not on the street. 

CONSUMERS - The people who have to see a product on TV, placed in two movies, fifteen magazine ads, and on a giant rack in the mall before saying, ""Hey, that's pretty cool."" At which point it's not. 

LAGGARDS - Proud in their mullets and feathered-back hair, they resist all change, or at least all change since they got out of high school. And once every ten years they suffer the uncomfortable realization that their brown leather jackets with big lapels have become, briefly, cool. But they bravely tuck in their Kiss T-shirts and soldier on.  

In 1918, there was a really nasty flu. It swept across every country in the world. A billion people got it, almost a third of everyone alive back then. And you know what's really amazing? The virus didn't spread over the radio, and you didn't get it from watching TV or reading the side of a bus. No one was hired to spread it. Everyone who contracted the disease got it from shaking hands with, or getting sneezed on by, someone else who had it, right? So in one year, just about everyone in the world had shaken hands with someone who had shaken hands with someone who had shaken hands with Patient Zero. So imagine that instead of sneezing germs, all those people had been saying to each other, ""Wow, this new breath mint is great! Want one?"" In just a year about a billion people would be using that new breath mint without anyone ever spending a dime on advertising. 
Kind of makes you think. 

There was a garment factory in South Carolina in 1962. One Friday one of the workers there got sick and said she'd been bitten by bugs while handling cloth from England. Then two more workers had to be hospitalized with fainting and hives. By the next Wednesday it was an epidemic. Sixty workers on the morning shift fell ill, and the federal government sent in a team of doctors and bug specialists. They discovered the following:
1. There were no poisonous bugs, from England or anywhere else.
2. The workers' various symptoms matched no known illness.
3. The sickness hadn't affected everyone on the morning shift, only workers who knew each other personally. It spread through social groups rather than among people who had worked with the suspect cloth. 
It looked like a scam, but the victims weren't faking. The disease was sociogenic, the result of a panic. As the rumors of illness spread, people thought they felt bugs biting them, then a few hours later they developed symptoms. It really works. Watch this: Bugs on your leg...bugs on your back...bugs crawling through your hair...bugs bugs bugs. Okay, do you feel the bugs now? I that think that you do (or you will in a minute or so). Go ahead. Scratch. The contagion in South Carolina had spread the same way yawning does, from brain to brain. So how did they cure this epidemic? Simple. They fumigated the hell out of the factory, pumping clouds of poison gas into it right in front of everyone. Real poison gas. Because if you believe the imaginary bugs are dead, they stop biting. Sort of like Tinkerbell...but bugs. And the epidemic was over.

We don't wear signs saying what we are. After all, if you knew what we were up to, we couldn't work out magic. We have to observe carefully, and push and prompt you in ways you don't notice. Like good teachers, we let you think you've discovered the truth on your own. And you need us. Someone has to guide you, to mold you, to make sure that today turns into yesterday on schedule. Because frankly, without us to monitor the situation, who knows what would get crammed down your throats? It's not like you can just start making your own decisions, after all. 


Nothing new has been going on, I guess. I'm really tired, so I'm actually going to go to bed soon. I'm excited about pilates tomorrow morning. Ummm...I guess that's about it. Hope everyone has an excellent weekend."

Ally's staying here for the weekend, which should be pretty cool. She's got work all day for the whole weekend, but will be here in the evenings, which is cool. Nothing else really going on this weekend though. I'm a little disappointed that Mark is going up to his cabin, but I suppose my picnic plans can wait :)

I'm so thrilled to finally be failing
I'm so done, turn me over cause it
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time

Anything plain can be lovely, anything loved can be lost
Maybe I lost my direction, what if our love is the cost?
Anyone perfect must be lying, anything easy has its cost
Anyone plain can be lovely, anyone loved can be lost
What if I lost my direction? What if I lost sense of time?
What if I nursed this infection? Maybe the worst is behind"

"event","Oh man, I wish there was something on Tuesday nights so that I wasn't so bored. I finished my book about a half hour ago so now I don't have anything to read either. I was hoping to swindle one of my parents into taking me, but my mom's band meeting got cancelled so she's not going out anymore. Which also means I shant be going to Erika's drama collective *tear*. 

Well not much has really been going on. Band camp was on Saturday (I skipped out for a while to have brunch with my cousins and such) and then I came home and studied all night. Sunday was Red Deer, and it was okay. I was in a really bad mood on the way back so all in all it wasn't that fun. Except for the mall. I had fun at the mall. Monday we wrote the AP exam, which was basically worse the Red Deer. Truthfully, it was as hard as I expected it to be and I'm almost positive I failed. A little depressing considering how I did study and everyone else thought it was easy. 

Don't have band tomorrow morning, which means I can sleep in, but it also means that I have to take my tux with me on the bus. I'm sort of excited for the concert, except that's it's probably going to go for three hours and ick. But whatever, I guess. I'll live. 

Well I guess that's it. My life is currently boring, so yeah. Hope you all have a good rest of the week."

"event","I really don't have all that much to update about, but whatever. I've basically spent most of my night doing homework. ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. I hate biology. I'll be so happy when this stupid exam is over. Still going to Red Deer, so that's the main reason for doing homework when I could be chilling in a hot tub right now. Disappointing? I think so.

I was also looking for the temporary schedule for tour that my mom has. She says it will probably change again at their next meeting, but so far it looks pretty cool. We do get to sleep on the buses, and otherwise it's all on gym floors. We spend no more then two days in one place, so that's a lot of bus time. We need to bring lots and lots of movies. We don't have all that many rehearsels (at least not as many as I expected) and they are mostly only 4 hours or so. Which means we have relatively large amounts of free time (sometimes). It looks like fun though. 

There was something else I wanted to say that I think was kind of important, but I forgot what it was. That kinda sucks but I'm sure it wasn't anything fantastic. I'm so bored right now, but I know that if I go back to studying I'm going to throw a tantrum. But I guess that's about it. Hope you guys have a good weekend, if I don't see you all!"

"event","So I didn't do a whole lot today except sit around in my pajamas. First of all though, I need to say that I watched a documentary today on WALMART. I actually am still having trouble understanding how they can be so irresponsible and...evil. I mean, yeah, I knew WALMART was pretty bad, but it's so ridiculously bad I can bearly put it into words. You really have to see it to believe it. If anyone wants to borrow it, they can. CRAZY.

Otherwise, I finished my book today, Ready or not. It's the sequel to All American Girl. I recomend it. It's pretty funny. I'm just gonna post some of the stuff that was the best. It's mostly all about sex. Both comical, and actual issues. Good read. Also, if you feel like reading a good book, I recently read 13 Little Blue Enveloppes. Good reads!

""In the meantime, I had the package Luzy had said she'd left for me. It was sitting right where Lucy had said she'd left it, in the middle of my bed. I looked inside the nondescript brown paper bag and saw two boxes. The first said RIBBED FOR HER PLEASURE! in masculine-looking type. Oh my God. My sister bought me a box of condoms. Feeling a little sick, I looked at the other box. It had curly writing with flowers on it. Inside, I found a canister and a plastic, tampon-like applicator, along with an insert. HOW TO USE CONTRACEPTIVE FOAM, the insert said. Oh my God. OH MY GOD.""

""Well, he shouldn't judge ME by the way I look,"" Lucy said, her eyes very blue and indignant. ""I mean, I can't help looking like this any more than Hellboy can help looking the way he does. I may look like a stuck-up popular girl, but I'm not. Why can't Harold see that? WHY? I mean, Liz saw past Hellboy's horns!""
""Maybe,"" I said carefully, since a cheerleader - even an ex-cheerleader - in love is a volatile thing, ""you should give Harold the benefit of a doubt. I mean, maybe he DOES see the real you, under your, um, horns, and just can't believe someone as...horny as you would ever like him back.""

""And did you have a chance to ask your mom and dad about Thanksgiving yet?"" David wanted to know. 
""Uh, no, I forgot."" I said. 
""Oh,"" David said, sounding only a little disappointed. Like, not as disappointed as I would have thought he'd be. ""Okay. Well, let me know. Because my mom wants to know how big a turkey she should order.""
Whoa. Was that some kind of code for ""I need to know how many condoms to purchase?"" I thought about telling him he didn't need to worry about that part of it. But then my call waiting went off.  


OMG. Three Days Grace has an album coming out in June. SO EXCITED"

I'm pretty freaking excited for this weekend, I must admit. I'm currently a little confused as to what is going on tonight, but oh well. I was supposed to go and see some friends of ours tonight, but I sort of didn't want to. I think my mom knew that so I don't know if she and my did just left or not. No one is home yet, so I have no idea. I'll call my dad later.
Saturday I'm getting together with Mark (hopefully) and probably visiting Kathy. WOOT! Saw her and Katie on the bus. Once exam season settles down we'll all have to get together. I was thinking maybe another Scavenger Hunt? Or at least something that is outside where it's warm. 
Long weekend and I so don't have to write the FLA AP exam on Monday. I'm going to school in the afternoon anyway though cause the guys team has a soccer game. Feel free to come if you want! Katie, if you are coming (and maybe Kathy?!?) I'll let you know when the game starts!

Hope everyone has an excellent weekend and I'll talk to you soon! Laters!"

I know Ally and Mark and Alex don't get back till Saturday, so I was thinking maybe Saturday night or something. We can just hang around and order pizza and watch movies and stuff. If I can get it organized, Mel, you are welcome to bring Curtis. So nothing is actually definitive, but if anyone wants to then let me know. And if not this week, then maybe next.

It hasn't been to bad though. Basically, I got to the operating room (so scary) and I was shaking so badly they put two blankets on me. The gas tasted terrible, and I woke up an hour later with a sore throat, a bloody mouth and an IV in my hand. The nurse came over and started talking to me and I don't really recall what I said to her, but there was definitely something about Slurpees. I was a little loopy from all the drugs and what not and my face was numb (I couldn't close one of my eyelids, I looked really stupid). I got home and spent the day on the couch. The gauze was terrible, cause I couldn't swallow which made my throat sore and any sudden movements and my mouth would start bleeding. I threw up mashed potatoes, but other then that I got down some jello and mushed bananas. Slept sitting up. 
Today so much better. I'm eating more and not having to take as many pills! Sadly I finished both season two of Scrubs and seanson one of Veronica Mars so I rented a few movies for the rest of the week. We should all get together and do something later this week maybe. I want to see everyone (preferably without look like a chipmunk and being able to fully close my mouth. Stupid wisdom teeth. 
But anywho, not a whole lot else has been happening. Hope everyone's break is going well and I'll talk to ya'll later!"

Instructions:
Write fifteen statements
Intended to different people.

1. I'm so glad I have you to talk to, even if it's only once and a while. I feel like you're the only person who won't judge me.

2. I don't like you. I feel so uncomfortable when you're around. 

3. I never know what to say to you, because what I really want is to be friends. But I feel like I don't qualify.

4. Lately I feel like we've lost our connection. I don't want to lose you, but I don't know what to do anymore. How can I try and talk to you when everything is so damn tense?

5. Holy fuck. I try to be there for you, I really do, but sometimes there's no point, because you never open up. Evetually it just wears me down, and I can't do it anymore. 

6. I feel like we've really grown close this year and I really feel like I can tell you anything, and I appreciate it so much!

7. (Obvious, but whateva!) I can't wait till summer comes because hopefully I will see you out in BC! Miss you and I really hope we have a ton of fun!

8. One of the coolest people I know. We may not be as close as I want us to be, but when we do spend time together I always have the time of my life. You rock.

9. I worry about you! I love you tons and it's so much fun hanging out with you. Don't do anything stupid!

10. Miss you so much. Every time I'm really going through something really tough I come to you, and somehow you always point me in the right direction. It comforts me to know that you're there, even though I don't really know it. 

11. You put a smile on my face. Thanks for that. 

12. I try to be like you. You inspire me to be different. I hope someday I'll be just as cool as you!

13. You are so cute and I really hope I get to know you better as the year goes on. 

14. Slowly you've started to open up a little bit. I really enjoy talking with you; you've usually got something fun to say that puts a smile on my face. I hope it continues!

15. I so glad that I've gotten to know you better this year. You are such a cool person and I really hope we become close friends."

"event","Back from the weekend at McGrath! It was pretty fun I must admit. The bus ride was awesome, first time I've ever had that much fun on a bus going somewhere band related. Didn't get a whole lot of sleep (luckily we get to sleep in tomorrow) but I've learned to function. My evening here was pretty relaxing. Had a bath (the burn on my legs started acting up) and read Harry Potter. I'm re-reading the 5th one. I enjoy that one quite a bit. My brother is currently re-reading the 6th one, which I might also do after I'm done the 5th. 

I'm currently a little bored and don't really know what to do. I've been on here for a long time, longer then normal, but I don't want to get off because I don't know what to do. I was thinking of watching a movie, but my parents are watching one. So I'm thinking I might like get into bed and put something on, and then I can just all asleep while it's playing or something. Dyl's working tonight, so I can't get him to show me how to play WOW. My mom said he can skip first period tomorrow because he's the only one who would have to be there early. He misses religion (so lucky). 

Well I hope everyone had a great weekend. I don't even really know why I'm updating, because this entry is completely useless. I'm just feeling really restless I guess. Poop. I don't want this week to start."

Anywho, today was a pretty sweet day. I cleaned my room this morning and then went to the mall with some of the ladies. Bought Kathy lots of prezzies and came back and had some jello/pudding. The rents and brother are currently out, so I'm making the most of my time alone in the house. It's been pretty sweet so far, so HAZA!

Also got a photo album today at the mall, so that's going to my project for the night, I think. I was definitely supposed to work on my french story, but that's going to have to wait for tomorrow, I'm afraid. As is math. Whateva!

Today was pretty boring for me actually, and a little crappy. Woke up this morning from a freaky-weird dream and my alarm went off a few minutes later. Got up and had a cookie for breakfast, then went downstairs to finish watching Devour. It was kinda weird, and I was pretty confused, but whatever. 
Watched some of the special features on RENT as well. Johnathan Larson seemed like such a cool guy. 
After that I figured I should finish up my bio and eat something for lunch. Had alphagetti for lunch and finished bio. Then went downstairs and listened to music and an hour or two, and got into a really crappy mood. So I came upstairs to read my book and had a piece of toast as a snack. Brother got home a little while after, and my mom is home now as well. 
I'm feeling very ansty right now, like I can't sit still, but I don't really want to do anything, or I don't know what to do. I have no motivation whatsoever and haven't for a while now. It definitely sucks, but hopefully things start to pick up this week. Or at least when this month is finally over. I'm really excited for Easter break. I feel like I really need to get out of here, but don't have anywhere to go. Blech."

My parents went out for a little while, so I watched RENT while Dyl and Mike goofed around (I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!!!). Saturday we all walked up to VHQ/Mac's and rented Harry Potter and got some candy. Mark came over to watch the movie and then he went to church and I went to babysitting. It was a bit of a rough night, but after they fell asleep I watched Chocolat and Smallville (drool, Clark Kent). Today it was just my dad and I before I went to the mall.

"event","Well it has been quite the week. Very long, in my opinion. It's been pretty good though, so I can't complain much. The cold weather has kind of sucked, but I'm trying to be optimistic and keep telling myself that I'll wake up one morning and actually see the sun. 

Monday and Tuesday are kind of blurs in my mind at the moment. I do remember watching dodgeball (hehehe), Deal or No Deal and Supernatural. Two good days, I'm guessing...

Wednesday was mostly good. The day itself kinda sucked, but afterwards it was pretty good. Spent 2+ hours studying/doing math to prepare for my math test, so I didn't exactly eat. This being the case, I wasn't too excited for marching, but it actually went really well. I'm so proud of my section for working so hard and applying themselves. Hopefully saturday goes just as well.

Thursday was pretty good as well, watched The Amazing Race and Beauty and the Geek with my mom. Had a tub which was awesome as well. Didn't end up falling asleep till pretty late, but whatever. It was alright. 

Today was pretty good as well. I think I did okay on my ear test this morning, but who knows. I'm pretty bad at that. *Remembers back to piano exams*. Also did my make up bio test, which I ended up getting 95% on, so I was so excited about that. Math was pretty good as well, got a 11/14 on my quiz. Also did my CLAM test after school, which wasn't as fun. Went back to the band room to see if anyone was there to take the bus with, but apparently they had all left. That kinda sucked since I took the bus home by myself, but meh. It happens! It was pretty freaking cold out though, so that wasn't cool. Got home and watched a little bit of Devour. *Drool* Jensen Ackles. Oh so hot. Haven't finished it yet, cause the rents are home. It says on the case that it's only 14A, but when the movie started, it said it was rated R, so I figure I'll watch the rest of it when no one is home. Or maybe if it's just me and my brother. Cause he definitely won't care. 

So that's about all that's happening in my boring life. I'm very sad that it's already after 8:30, because I have to get up in less then 12 hours and that's so not cool. I wish it was only 6."

So glad we didn't have the math test yesterday, so I still get the weekend to study for it! Haza! I think my CALM test went okay, I knew most everything on the test, but forgot one or two of the last ones. I don't think bio went as well, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed. Went to Mark's for a while after school to hang and do some tobaganning (spelling). Katie came as well, and we went out, but there were a lot of people on the hill so we didn't stay long. Alex and Mark had to eat for their soccer game, which I was then invited to go to. They said they could give me a ride there and back so I said sure. The game was intense but lots of fun. Afterwards Mark was supposed to go to Lindsey's and I figured I might be able to go as well, but then he ended up not going cause he was covering for someone this morning and had to be up really early. So they just dropped me at home and I ended up not being able to go. I hope it was lots of fun!
Not much planned for today, other then babysitting tonight for a little while. I missed the open house at Saint Mary's which sucks, but I can always go next year I guess. But anyway, not a whole lot going on and I hope you all have a fabulous weekend!"

"event","So totally just finished my book, The Bitten, and holy freaking crap it was so good. I spent all day reading and I was yelling at my book the whole time. My family thinks I am insane!! BUT SO GOOD!

Had a pretty sweet weekend, though am quite disappointed I couldn't go to Danielle's. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I heard something about strip poker...
Went to lunch with Mark on Friday and then to dinner. Got home and watched March of the Penguins, which was pretty crazy. 
Babysat all day on Saturday, from about 11-7. Made a good thirty bucks from that deal though, so it wasn't too bad. Got home and chilled at home while everyone else went out. Had a jolly good time watching Video on Trial and reading. 
Yesterday was homework day, doing some CALM and then went to Jubilations with my mom. It was pretty fun, lots of singing and stuff so that was all good. You know me with the musicals...
And today consisted of reading until my eyeballs popped out of my head! And it was oh so worth it! Haza! Hope everyone else had a fantastic weekend as well and I'll see you all tomorrow!!!"

"event","It's been a pretty relaxed day for me here at home. Woke up late and had the best sleep of my life, most likely. Had chocolate cake for breakfast and watch our fabulous Canadian atheletes win silver medals and mens/womens group speed skating. 

A few of my brothers friends came over for the afternoon, so I kept to myself, mostly staying in my room all day. I cleaned up and listened to music for roughly 3 hours. I went through pictures, notes, ticket stubs, cards, school work, diaries, poems, drawings...everything I forgot I had. Brings back a lot of memories, good and bad. Also organized by jewlery and bathroom. Oh, how I feel clean. 

Forgot it was Thursday and luckily caught Smallville in time. Made Kraft Dinner for the guests and myself. It only occurs to me now that I've barely eaten all day. Now, as my brother is baking cookies, I'm chilling until my parents get home, so we can all gather around the TV and watch Survivor, and maybe some CSI after that. It almost depresses me how much television I watch.

Can't make it to Danielle's tomorrow, I'm supposed to be heading out to dinner. I'm babysitting all day on Saturday, and possibly going out once again in the evening to visit family friends. I'm thinking Sunday and Monday is when I actually get around to doing my homework, as is the norm. Looks like a promising weekend!

""Every day you wake up to the same bloody question: is today the day I die. Death is on your heels baby, and sooner or later it's going to catch you. Part of you wants it; not only to stop the fear of uncertainty, but because you're just a little bit in love with it. Death is your art. You make it with your hands, day after day. That final gasp, that look of peace. Part of you is desperate to know. ""What's it like?"" Where does it lead you?"". And now you know. That's the secret. Not the punches you throw, or the kicks you land; she merely wanted. Everyone has a death wish. Even you. The only reason you've lasted as long as you have is because you have ties to the world. But you're just putting off the inevitable. Sooner or later you're going to want it. And the second that happens, you know I'll be there. I'll slip in. Have myself a real good day. Here endth the lesson. I just wonder if you'll like it as much as she did.""

"event","Finally got on the computer. I would have updated a while ago but someone spilled Root Beer on our keyboard and now the whole middle row doesn't work. So we've all been booted to the computer upstairs, and I finally got on! Three cheers!

So obviously, school has started. I'm having a pretty good time so far. Religion is kinda boring, but he seems pretty open to discussions and stuff so that's cool. Got a spare with quite a few people, some of which I don't talk to all the often so that's good as well. French goes by the quickest so far, followed by Math (got my first quiz on Wednesday! *Crosses fingers*). Bio is pretty sweet, I like the stuff we're learning about. Sadly I'm not that happy with the class. I can't focus in classes as big as ours, especially when no one stops talking. But I guess I got to get used to that one fast...

Band is great as well, except I'm starting to get a little impatient from time to time. Either with Mr. Reigel (when he keeps on talking and I want to play) or with the juniors in my section, who'd better show up to sectionals tomorrow. I'm not trying to say that I'm the best or only one playing, but some of them have to step it up a little. But whatever, I'm sure it'll work out.

Took the bus after school which broke down just after pulling out of the station. After waiting about 5 minutes I got off and walked to the next bus stop to catch the 3. Took that and waited another while for the 79 by the library. Luckily it wasn't too long of a wait. Got home and realised I couldn't go to the gym because my mom was working late and I'm not allowed to walk there in the dark. Guess I'll just wait till Wednesday night to get my workout. 

For those of you who are actually reading all of this, sorry it's so long and slightly cynical. It's been a bit of a rough start to the week, and I'm feeling a little sick as well. I dunno. I hope the end of the week turns out well! Have a great week guys!"

"event","SO I went to see Tristan and Isolde last night. It wasn't too bad. It lacked a bit of ....omph, but it was still pretty good. 

Going to see The Producers today with Mark at the cheapies, which hopefully will be pretty fun. Hopefully it's pretty funny. ANd it's sort of a musical thing going on, so I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

Totally forgot about Mel's thing, thank god Dani reminded me. If possible, I'll either need to get a ride from someone or I'll just be late. If anyone reads this before the night has gone and passed, let me know if I can get a ride! Lol. But I'll call around, and if not then no worries, I'll just be a little late, which is fine as well!"

"event","On and on 
and I just feel helpless
How long will this take to wear out?
On and on
when will I get through this?
Welcome to my own down and out

Another day, another day in paradise
If you only knew wouldn't it be nice?
Get away get away get away
I'm about to detonate

Lately I'm not quite myself
Just my confusion
Trust my delusion

I'm past the point of reality
This isn't me, this isn't you
It's just everything we do
Till you open up your eyes and understand this isn't real
This isn't me, this isn't you
This is everything but true
Till we come to realize it's what we put each other through

And just for one day I wish I could disappear
Just take me far from here

Is my confusion reality or fiction? 
Am I out of my mind?

If we could all depend on what we know
If you could understand...I'm losing control"

"event","Had the chem final today, which hopefully went well and also did testing. Had tons of fun at the mall with Liz and Mel and made the journey home. Got home and have been lazing about ever since. Recently put some cream on my feet because I had some sort of freakish reaction. Currently hurts like a mother fucker. 

""Recess! A school day break for play and exercise. Little does Susie realize how much exercise she is abuot to get! She tunrs at the sound of running get behind her. Have her friends come to join her? NO It's a pack of ferocious deinonychus dinosuars!! Screaming, Susie hurls herself toward the school doors, but the pack is closing in! With the grim efficiency of wild dogs, the predators have a meal! Across the playground, students huddle in stupefied horror! Which one of them will be next? Thus, the weak and stupid are weeded out in a heartless, but essential, natural selection, keeping the human population in check. ...at least, that's how it OUGHT to be.""

""It all boils down to lluck, Hobbes. Some people are born lucky and some people are born unlucky. Either way, there's noting you can do about it. You can't fight luck. You go along, minding your own business, and suddenly your luck runs out. If you're unlucky, what can you do? You're condemned to suffer!""

""I wish we could stop summmer right here and have the days stay just the way they are. That's the problem with life. It rolls along with speed you can't control. You can't go faster or slower. Fun experiences always go roaring by, while bad experiences never pass quickly enough. I wish we could choose how fast and slow events go.""
""It's not the pace of life I mind. It's the sudden stop at the end.""

""Mom's calling. Start the stopwatch.""
""Shouldn't you answer her?"" (H)
""Not yet. She doesn't see us, so she can't prove we heard her. The trick is to listen to her tone of voice and answer just before she gets mad enough to come looking for us...Ok, that was it. Now we play innocent. Are you calling me?""
""Come inside. It's time for bed. It's getting dark.""
""Ha! She made a tactical blunder. Darkness is relative! It's not dark!""
""Yes it is, come inside!""
""I can still see my hands. It's not real dark!""
""It's dark enough. Let's go.""
""Rats. She cut off debate before we could really define the terms. Now we have to bargain. Can I stay ouy another ten minutes? That's all I want!""
""No. Come in now.""
""Five minutes then. Just five minutes okay?""
""NOW, CALVIN!""
""Darn. She's catching on! She guessed that my five minutes it her half hour. We'll go for the fake agreement. Ok, I'm coming! Now we can stay out a little longer before she realizes I lied. How's the time?""
""We've dragged this out 53 seconds so far."" (H)
""Good, let's go for the record. Oops, I lost me shoe!""
""Every minute outside and awake it a good minute."" (H)"

"event","Recently, I took a few weeks off of work for a ""vacation"".  The scare-quotes are because it wasn't really much of a vacation; I didn't go to Hawaii or the Carribean or France, even.  Instead, I spent my vaction money on a video camera.  Nonetheless, it was nice to be away from work, though not entirely relaxing.  I told myself to spend a few days working on some things around the house, like cleaning (from file cabinets to kitchen cupboards), paying bills and most importantly, getting my shit together.  It seems that I'm always behind, never ahead of the game.  The plan was to get the un-fun stuff out of the way so that I could get to the fun stuff.  Makes sense, but damned if I didn't just spend a week getting organized and another week sleeping in and staying up too late.  Which brings me to the sobering (albeit long) conclusion of this little tale.

I had only three days left on my ""vacation"", having squandered the majority of it with no exciting events occuring.  Not that this part will be exciting, either.  But stay with me - it's a short little rant.  Anyhow, I decided to go up to Blaine, WA to visit a friend and also stop in Vancouver, B.C. to see another friend.  On the way back, I stopped in Bellingham in order to film my roommate's band's performance at a place called The Factory.  The show started at ten, so I used my new camera and got some decent footage (my first time filming) for a half-hour or so.  Around 12:30, I left Bellingham and, though I had consumed half of a long-island and a couple of beers 1.5 hours ago, was feeling tired due to the late hour, the long road trip of the previous day, and the anticipation of an hour's drive with a reasonably drunk passenger.  I was really looking forward to sleep.  Now, I went to Western Washington University, where I got my B.A., and more importantly, learned to navigate (one straight path) my way from Seattle to Bellingham and back, and rather quickly.  The cop noticed that, too.  I got pulled over just south of Mt. Vernon, clocked at 18mph over.  Which is not really that big of a deal, except when you've had a tiring and somewhat dissapointing weekend and you just want to go home and sleep.  Did I mention that in all my years of driving experience I have NEVER been pulled over or gotten in an accident?  Truthfully, I tend to speed and am guilty of past vehicular transgressions (not on paper) as I was of this one.  So I was written up for 10mph over the speed limit, which, incidently changes from 70mph to 60mph in that area.  All told, it cost me $101 USD and 37 cents for speeding.  Completely sober.  At 1am.  On an almost empty three - lane highway, the only other present automobiles doing at least 85mph.  But I was caught, and I had to pay for it.  I can't really be mad at the cop, who was just doing his job, though he could have given me more of a break, seeing as how it was my first legal offense OF ANY KIND in my life.  Also, anyone on the road at that time has a place they need to be, NOW.  Let us late-night travelers just get to where we're going before we fall asleep at the wheel and make a mess.  Really, what perturbs me is the system, man.  (sigh)  Seriously, I know it's out in the middle of next - to - nowhere, but goddammit, don't the cops have anything better to do than fine me for the vehicular equivalent of jaywalking?  I call ""no harm, no foul"" on this victimless (save for me and my wallet) crime.  Back to that jaywalking analogy.  Jaywalking in Manhattan is so prevalent, you'd be hard-pressed to find a jaywalker with a ticket.  Besides, NYPD have more important things to do.  Maybe we can set a precedent.  Calling all safe, good drivers who like the open road: Just drive as safe as you feel.  How much harm could that cause?  Well, here's the theoretical part - if you are a good enough driver that the state issues you a license to operate a fast-moving machine, then you ought to be able (other things being equal) to decide whether you are operating a vehicle at a justly safe speed.  No shit.  This might get the DOL to stop handing out licences like they were Cracker Jack prizes.  Or it could set a jaywalking-type precedent.  Or you just might see more, faster black-and-whites in your rear-view mirror.  Two can play that game.  Truck on, brothers and sisters.  They can't catch all of us."

"event","Last night I went to the Seattle Poetry Slam at the Capitol Hill Arts Center.  It actually only sounds lame.  It's not some stuffy old community center.  And this is not your Father's poetry.  Nor is it for the kids either, given the late hour, the subject matter, and the 21-and-over crowd (They serve beer and wine).  I had a good time, though parking is always an adventure and it took some time to find the place, which is downstairs from Crave.  The slam is every Wednesday at 8:30pm, though sign-ups are at eight.  The evening begins with an open mic, followed by a featured poet, and then finally the slam.  For the sake of brevity, I won't explain how a slam works or what it's about - you're on the internet, you figure it out.  I like slams but I'm not a slam-type poet, although I wouldn't mind doing a few open mics.  This was the first Seattle slam I've ever been to, and it was comfortable, if not super-duper impressive.  Nonetheless, it was definitely worth the five-buck cover.  The only slams I've ever been to were in NYC, and they were quite different.  I imagine every city has a unique slam setup, some more strict than others.  This might even vary from one side of town to another.  That, I think, is part of the beauty of it; slam is a fairly recent invention (just over twenty-years old) so it is still developing and not stagnant.  But hey, enough of my yapping.  Go check it out, it's different and better than suffocating at some bar or sitting at home alone in front of your computer.  Yeah, I said that.  At the very least, you'll learn that not all Capitol Hill people are superfucking weird.  And some of them are even stranger than you could have ever imagined.  Relax.  Have a couple of drinks.  And leave your inhibitions at the door.

I think too often I write like I think someone cares, as in a journalistic fashion.  But just fucking deal with it because that's the way it is baby."

"event","Not that you care, but I've been way too lazy lately to update my journal.  Well, sorry.  On the plus side, consider the humanitarian gesture: By not updating my journal with frivolous shit, I am restricting the output ( in my own small way) of web pollution.  Actually, I wrote twenty minutes worth of a rant on why I was upset with the Seattle coffee-house scene, but it was accidently deleted and not worth retyping.  Suffice it to say that this city should be open later than it is.   

By the way, I'm using a new wachamacallit, to access and post entries here, so we'll see how well (or if) it works.

This weekend I went to see <a href=""http://www.visqueenonline.com/"">Visqueen</a>(for the umpteenth time) at the Croc.  I like their one-trick pony music because Rachel Flotard wails like a banshee who rocks.  That was kind of a stupid way of putting it.  They are like the Donnas, but more basic (huh?) and better; they actually rock live.  I saw them with Big Business and Spider Bites, who aren't really my cup of tea.  Mostly, I went to hang out with some friends I hadn't seen in a while.  And a friend of a friend who plays in a band I haven't seen called <a href=""http://www.plum-st.com/"">Plum St.</a>It was good for me to go out, though I'm sure I lost some hearing.  

On Saturday I went up to Bellingham after work to see Death Cab for Cutie (who don't have a website but check out <a href=""http://www.barsuk.com/web.cgi"">Barsuk Records</a>), Visqueen again, and United States of Electronica.  This was all one show at Western Washington University, my alma mater, and was an occasion to celebrate  the 30th Anniversary of KUGSfm, which is the mediocre campus radio.  Therefore, the venue was less than interesting, the sound was inconsistent, and there was no bar.  But it was a good show, save for the United States of Electronica which is a cheesy, quasi-electronic, Up With People-ish, Saved By the Bell sort of band with too many members, some of which don't even do anything except bounce.  The only compelling feature of USE is that they have a Vocoder which is, unfortunately, the predominate ""instrument"" (read: gimmick) among their cavalcade of cheer-queer hipster members.  But hey, to each his/her own.

I'm not even going to comment on the Superbowl because, quite frankly, I was bored/didn't care.

This weekend may find me up in Bellingham again, as well as Blaine and possibly Vancouver to visit friends.  But that's a long ways away, and I have some things going on this week:  Wednesday, I'm going to check out the poetry slam at the Capitol Hill Arts Center, which is supposed to be pretty good, and Thursday I'll go see Miracle or whatever it's called about the you know US Hockey team of two decades ago.  The rest of the time, I guess I'll just play some music or watch a DVD or whatever, since I've finally gotten around to hanging all the pictures and mirrors in my house and paying the bills, etc.   

Well, if you've made it this far you can relax.  I promise to keep it shorter in the future.  If you're out and about you might find me sipping at <a href=""http://www.herkimercoffee.com/"">Herkimer Coffee</a>, which is my favorite neighborhood coffee joint.  But only until 8pm, because that's when they close.

"event","I am just typing in order to say something.  My pix should be up later tonight, tomorrow if I'm too tired.  I guess today was a rather boring day - just doing lots of laundry, cleaning the house, and taking care of business.  I have tomorrow off as well, so I'll probably go visit my grandmother (I haven't seen nor talked to her in weeks).  Then I'll just play/record some music, catch up on some dvds.  I should be reading and writing, so hopefully I'll get to that, go running, do some yoga (I'll try to try).  Right now I'm at my parents' place, having just had dinner and now using their scanner to save some pix. I don't even know why I'm writing this; I imagine thus far only ironmaus will see this. It's getting late, I'd better go home and relax (somehow)."

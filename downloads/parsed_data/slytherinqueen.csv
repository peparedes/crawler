"event","I'm bored, and looking for something to do. 

Basically, that's it, that's all. I am bored out of my mind - even school was more enjoyable than this! <i>Honestly</i>.

Someone - anyone - suggest something that I could do. Please."

"event","<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/bittersweet_dm"">Draco</a>'s daughter really is sweet. Evita...she's a bit spoiled, but that's to be expected, I'm supposing. She's also rather ticklish. Takes after her father, that one.

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/mediwitch_davis"">Tracey</a>? <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/more_rag"">Morag</a>? We have to get together at one point. Really, catching up is a must."

"event","So, it looks like <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/bittersweet_dm"">Draco</a>'s little girl, Evita, is coming for a week. As much as I loathe admitting it, I love when she comes. She's such a sweet little child, and she looks so adorable.

How <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/bittersweet_dm"">he</a> plans on running a casino while she's here, I don't know. But that's his problem, not mine."

"event","They changed the light filters in the club again, and now they're blue. I wish they would just leave them -- for at least a week! Just a few days ago they were gold. And now I have to redo my entire makeup plans and costumes for the entire week.

And people say that being a showgirl is an easy job. That's <i>definitely</i> not true.

And <A HREF=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/bittersweet_dm"">Draco</A>? Are you..stopping by this evening before the show?"

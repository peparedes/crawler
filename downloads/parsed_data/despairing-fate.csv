Why don't people on television ever go to the toilet?
Is the only thing that makes God different from us the fact that when he does something cruel he doesn't need to explain himself?
Does it prove that life is hard by the fact that no-body gets out of it alive?
To be or not to be... Is that a trick question?
If life is hard, shouldn't we all be wearing helmets?  LMAO
If you ordered a pizza with no toppings would you have to pay extra because it's a speciality pizza?
How can you tell what time you went to sleep?
Is sanity madness put to good use?
Is a friend somebody who knows you, but likes you anyway?
According to statisticians there is a 14 million to one chance of winning the lottery, and a 1 million to one chance of being run over and killed by a bus. So why don't more people bet on getting run over by a bus?
Why is quicksand so slow?
Which came first, the Question or the Answer?
Isn't the urge to destroy, a creative one?

And I could go on...............

"event","<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are those who find God in order of the universe - evidenced in elements as small as atomic nuclei to forces as massive as the cosmic energy that holds galaxies at bay. From Galileo to Enstein to Hawking, the balance of energy to prescribed laws and constants. While mathematics of the universe may connote the existence of a supreme being, to me it is that which <EM>defies</EM> maths probabilities - the impossibility of two objects colliding in an infinite void to indelibly alter each other's eternal course. In this there is divinity and an unseen hand.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the course of my own life I have come to believe that life is not gifted by the sweep of a clock's hand or the change of a season, but rather, experimentally, each experience laid upon the previous, delivering us to a loftier plane. Perhaps this best describes my concept of God - the architect of that ascent and the divine, unseen wind that propels us through the uncharted waters of our own destiny. But salvation, spiritual or otherwise, is not a solitary matter and along such journeys there are companions placed along our travels and travails, fellow sojourners who forever alter our paths and sometimes carry us when we are too weary to carry ourselves.</P>

"event","* Linzey, I read your #40 article, it was really good.  I definitely think they should publish it.  Your advice was great.*

What follows are not exact words because when serious conversations about love and emotions come up it's always a blur and I never say what I want or intend to.

He:  You've been stand-offish and act like you don't care about me.
I:  I know, I've been thinking about some stuff and need to talk.  
He:  Are you seeing somebody or talking to someone?
I:  Talking to some people.
He:  Why didn't you tell me.
I:  It's not that.  I need to be with somebody who wants to be with me.
He:  Did I ever say I didn't want to be with you?
I:  I deserve to have somebody's full attention not someone who still talks to their ex-boyfriend.
-long silent pause infront of the TV
He:  Well, I got to go.  I'll talk to you later.
I:  Aight, you got my number.

Shit!!!  That's not what I meant.  Listen, there is nobody else right now, but to be honest if someone wants to talk I will.  I care about you and love you.  So much so that I want all of you.  I'm tired of hanging out and making out while you still talk to your ex-boyfriend every day.  I deserve more!  I'm tired of feeling like you have me on a string as your plaything while you decide who it is that you really want.  Part of me wants you to go back to him so that you can see he really hasn't changed.  Go ahead, I bet he'll hit you again within 2 months.  You never really broke up or got over him.  You've talked to him every single day (many times a day) since you ""broke-up"".  What the hell is that?  You can't get over someone and move on if you talk to them everyday.  Yes, I love you but I just have to ignore those feelings and move on.  I can't wait around on you.  Sure you have shit to work out; we all do.  If you wait to get your shit straightened out before you get into a relationship, it will never happen, but you do have to get over him and move on before you get into another relationship.  I want a relationship with you, not you and him.  I don't want to be a jealous lover.  I know, nobody likes that.  But honestly when we are together and he calls or texts you it drives me crazy, I just want to push you out the door.  If I don't have your loyalty, then I don't want anything.

Ah fuck, just grow up.  I don't get it.  I know I don't, because if someone abused me the way he did to you (mentally and physically) I would be out the door or in prison.  You said yourself that I've been better to you than your own family, and you can't decide?  God, love is blind.  I don't get it."

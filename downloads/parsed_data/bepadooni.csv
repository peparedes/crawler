Seeing Caleb's away message that just so happen to be Imogen Heap lyrics leads me to mention that last night I totally met her and it was AMAZING!!!  She was playing at the Patio and it was an absolutely incredible show, and had a chance to get autographs and talk for about 15 minutes afterwards.  She was very shy, soft-spoken and uncomfortable, but a vocal powerhouse on stage.  

YAY IMMI!!!! (: (:

I will be oot and aboot downtown tomorrow night... is anyone else going to be??  Maybe we can meet up?!?  That would be so super sweet.

"event","Quick update! Started the new jobby up in Carmel and just like any job it has it's good and bad points, but the good outweigh the bad so no complaints!  It's at a business development and marketing firm, and I'm the only full-time employee, which is odd-- ever been in a job where there's really no one walking by or people to talk to?  That can be nice though.  

Just found out I get to go see Wicked in Chicago!!!!  I got some surprise tickets and I'm crazy pumped.  I've never heard any of the music from it so it will be a completely new experience.  Can't wait!!!

I'm so glad it's the weekend!!  I'll be out a bit Saturday night, the only place I know of for sure is @ the Emerson to check out The Nancy School, but if anybody's going out call my cell and we can try to meet up, so I can make out with you!"

"event","So I was mega excited to see everyone at the pimps and hos party.  Had my shiznit picked out to wear, ready to go, then in the afternoon I get a call that my Grandma had to go to the emergency room.  She couldn't breathe because she has asthma really bad and was getting pneumonia on top of that, but pretty much didn't tell anybody.  I was at the hospital with her until 10:30 or so, then spent the night with my Grandpa so he wouldn't be alone.  She won't be coming home until Tuesday at least... why can't our family and friends be healthy forever?  sigh  
I miss you guys very much and I hope ACTF is off the hizzle.  I heard a gangsta say that once and I think it means ""really great.""  (I think?) 
Hope we can do a girl's night soon."

"event","I started a new job last week, and it's actually a real job and I have decided that I don't like working at all and can't believe that I have to do this for the rest of my life.  Working at school is one thing.  But man, I love being home... I'm such a homebody.  And I have to work a minimum of 40 hours a week, and it's an hour drive from my house.  
It's a pretty sweet deal though and amazing that I even got it.  It's an internship at Ingersoll-Rand, a Fortune 200 company that I had never heard of but is incredibly successful and a very notable name apparently.  They make 50% of all door securities in the United States.  They own a slew of other big businesses, like Hussman and Bobcat.  The intern who had this position before me told me there was a stack of resumes ""up to my knee"", so I never thought I'd get it.  It's really hard to fit in and I don't understand anything at all.  
I'm doing some desktop support, technical documentation, repairing shop floor computer problems, data validation and... ok I'm going to stop, because don't all of those things sound boring?  Actually I really like going out in the factory, because I can talk to the workers and watch the pretty machines.  It's one of the most innotative and clean factories in the nation from what I've heard.  They even have robots that do certain tasks... I could watch those things all day.  They're so cool!  
It's deafeningly loud and there are distracting, hot, sweaty guys in tank tops everywhere.  One guy looked like a filthy Johnny Depp!!!!  How excited was I?  He was nasty and I couldn't stop looking. (:  I'm going to go back out later and see if I can find him.  Probably not, because there are about 500 people that work here.  
The hardest thing I have to deal with is the high stress and the huge expectations they're putting on me to pick up everything the first time.  I need to do things 47 times as well as write it down to understand it because there are so many new things being thrown out.   
No, I take that back.  I haven't even touched on the worst thing, and I don't even know where to begin.  Ok, the boss is this evil asian dude who is the devil himself.  You just wouldn't believe him; I swear he has flames shooting out of his eyes.  Here's what's bad: The girl that I have to work side-by-side with is none other than his daughter.  She is evil.  I have never met someone so evil in my entire life.  The first day she told me she hated me.  She said she hated everything about me.  She tells me every day that since she is the bosses daughter, if I do anything to upset her there will be huge consequences.  I'm her puppet and she knows it and tries to use me for things like wiping her ass and getting her coffe, but I won't do it.  She freaks out at least once a day and shrieks that I'm going to steal her job and that I'm replacing her.  She lies about everything and is a self-proclaimed hypochondriac.  Every 5 minutes she finds something else on her body that hurts.  Oh shit she just got here....... I HAVE TO GO!!!!!!!"

Juston, you are so smart and a wonderful person.  

So..... April SUCKS.  It has to be the worst month school-wise because everything's piled on at the end.  Who wants to quit school and live in a box with me??  It's a really nice corrogated box and I punched eye holes in it.

10 little things to make you happy:

1) Finding the perfect dress that fits juuuuust right
2) Seeing Emily and Sara... yeah!!
3) Um, two words: Bethany knitting
4) PR shots of Lendell looking oh-so creepily at Joanna... hilarious!
5) Feeling the wind whisper across your face
6) Staring at the sky in the evening
7) Eating cookies 
8) Eating more cookies, followed by lots of ice cream
9) Seeing babies smile
10) Being alone 

Do you like InTake magazine, or think it's a horrible Nuvo imitation?  

The offer to live in that box still stands, by the way."

Waiting around until night class, studying for a test I have in there.  Debating whether to take some summer school classes.  Need to find a summer job!!  Anybody doing anything fun/exciting/illegal/crazy/did I mention fun? over spring break???  I'm having so much trouble concentrating on anything this semester.  I can't do homework, I can't think, I can't learn in class (and I use the term ""learn"" loosely)... I don't know what's up.  It's kind of nice drifting along like Eileen and not realizing what's going on in the world around me.  

I'm so clumsy I swear I'm going to fall and break my ass.  Don't be surprised if you see me in a wheelchair.  Stupid ice.  

And the radiator went out in my car so I have to get rides ::again:: for a whole week.  It's done really well though this winter, so I can't complain.  

Just watched Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful.  Soaps are AWESOME.  I have watched those since I was little.  

You know what I love?  Eating.  I love food so much.  I am so passionate about food.  Wanna make me happy?  Sit me in a corner for a few hours with a cookbook."

Played in the snow, walked across frozen ponds, got caught by cops, all in all a wholesome evening.  I love hanging out with Kristin, Nikki, Juston, and Evan.  Best of all was when we saw the terrorist snowman for the first time and couldn't stop laughing...

So I saw Janet Jackson's boob at half time.  Don't know what to think about that.

Um.  Gettin ready to go to Prod.  

What more is there to say?  I am sooooooooo boring.  Sold about 250 tickets to Our Town in an hour and a half... everyone called/came to the window nonstop.  It will be sold out fo' sho'!  But not yet; don't worry.  

And I reeeeeeeally have to go to Prod now!"

Can anybody give me some suggestions, good brands that you personally have and work well, etc etc?  Since I hold your opinions higher than anyone else, I'm asking all of you first!

What's everybody asking for for Christmas?  I need a lot of boring stuff like socks, underwear, clothes, you know, stuff just to live.  My parents, I mean, Santa, go all out for Christmas.  We hardly do anything fun during the year so Christmas is our big thing that we splurge on.  

I have a big hill behind my house, so if anybody wants to go sledding when there's enough snow to do it and you'll be in town, let me know!!  That would be muchos fun!  Does anybody wanna go ice skating or anything like that next week?  I can't skate worth crapola and I can't even take one step on the ice without holding somebody's hand, but it's crazy fun and gives you a good excuse to hold hands with people! hehe  That's what you get when you are clumsy and uncoordinated like me."

Best because I got to do all of the little things that you take for granted that you don't get to do as much while in school.  We had Thanksgiving at our house this year with a very small bunch.  Just Grandma and Grandpa, the two people I am closest to in the world besides my mom, dad, and bro.  I hate big get-togethers.  Too hectic.  Mom and I cooked for 2 days nonstop.  So much fun... cooking is probably my favorite hobby.  I ate waaaay too much though and my stomach is knocking over tables and scaring babies.  Then we put up our X-mas decorations over the course of Fri-Sun.  I love X-mas so much.  Winter = cozy sweaters, fires, hot chocolate, tons of food, eating all day long, movies, nice crisp cold on your face.  Winter is great for us girls because then we don't have to shave every day!! WOO-HOO  Went to the basketball game on Saturday and that was a blast... we kicked some assssss!  I can't wait for this week to be over.  Well, and next week too.  School is awful right now, and I agree with Chris McKay that this is the semester from hell.  Can't wait for the cast party.  I think we all just need to have a crazy time together and go nuts before we all go our separate ways for break.  I feel like I made a Danae entry; long, nonsensical, too idealistic... oh how I miss that girl.  What it must be like to live (be trapped in ??) in the mind of a 12 year old."

I'm such a morning person; I wake up at 7:00 and have to get up no matter what time I went to bed the night before, which reeeally sucks to be like that sometimes.  I can't go back to sleep.  Damn internal clock.  But my mom made the best breakfast... cinnamon rolls, bacon/egg/cheese biscuits, coffee, oh man, it was so good.  As mad as we get at our moms sometimes, we should all be so thankful for them.  My mom's my best friend and the only person in the world that I tell everything to.  Sniff, tear, I sound like an after school special!

I'm SO HAPPY it's Friday.  Publicity crew for Stage Blood is just... I'm so lucky to have Kristin, Amanda, and Caleb.  I think we've all gotten really close throughout the whole thing.  

Bad news... my little black 1990 Mazda is officially dead forever.  Not good if you are a commuter.  There were some problems I didn't know about, and when I got home Monday my dad discovered the engine was ruined from me driving it home in the state it was in.  I had no idea though that there were all of these leaks and stuff in it.  I've resorted back to freshman year of high school getting rides from mom to/from school.  There's nothing else to do though.  I can't afford another car... I have about $800 and $500 of that has to go for books next semester.  I know you're probably thinking ""cry me a river, Ashley,"" but I am really upset about this.  I loved that little car; it was the most reliable car and still looked good.  That $8 for the Stage Blood t-shirt isn't looking so good right now! (:

I can't wait to see Stage Blood... it's so hilarious from what I've read and I think it is brilliantly cast ;-)"

The picture of her that was on the casket was GORGEOUS!  It was so bizarre standing there looking at the casket; it was hard to believe that she was actually in there and it was not just part of some display.  That sounds so stupid, but it all seemed surreal to me.  It was almost like a goodbye party for someone moving away, and in the back of my mind I truly felt like she would be coming back... show up in the suite one day, come out of Howie's car with her stuff ready for class, show up at Krista's house for a party.  It is so devastating to realize that she's not.  I'm so thankful that we have each other to lean on through this."

The Half-Ass Revolutionaries had every girl in the place (and a couple guys too... ::cough cough:: Chris Vicoli) going completely insane.  Oh yeah, this is probably a reeeeeeeally stupid question and everyone will think less of me than they already do, but where did the name ""Chucks"" come from?  Is there a story behind this?  Ok, onward. Ron's beautiful rendition of the saddest part of My Dog Skip was touching and sad.  Who knew award-winning playwrights could READ so well, too??  Shanelle's song was just gorgeous.  She didn't mess up once and sounded GREAT, both singing-wise and on guitar. (:  Melissa's story was SO APPROPRIATE for the evening, and Dr. Seuss didn't fail us in providing top-notch rhymes.  She sounded so sweet and sincere... ::happy sigh::  Rissa, the lights were so good I wet my pants.  You're amazing.  Who did I miss?  I'm writing this on Monday and my memory fails me.

OH KRISTA- I didn't have a bike that I could actually ride as of about a few years, and I got a new bike for EASTER!  Let me know whenever you guys are going because I am SO THERE.

"event","It's nice to be at the show every night, because I haven't been able to hang out with everybody as nearly as much as I want to, and this gives me a good chance to do that.  
They were selling ice cream and cookies for 50 cents in Schwitzer, and I have just partaken in that goodness, even though I bought three dollars worth and now I'm really sick... I wish I still had the mechanism in my brain that told me I was full.  I have completely destroyed that, it seems.
Chris McKay and I had a fun 2 hours of hanging out- didn't we, Chris?  He played me a variety of songs on the piano, including ""Mary had a Little Lamb"" and a variation of ""Hot Cross Buns.""  
I wanted to say how much I loved Someone For Everyone and Sister Mary!!!  EVERYONE, maybe excluding a couple o' designers (hahahahaha), did an AMAZIN' job.  Box office update: LOTS of people coming Saturday night that I know of.  Who knows who will randomly show up, but we've sold a lot of tickets for that night in particular.
I heard Ron's coming tonight!!!  I miss that crazy man. (:
So all of this insane crap with Melissa's family.  Dear Lord.  I think in some strange, twisted way it is the only way they know how to let her know how much they love her.  They are obviously desperate to keep her here, and if they didn't love her tremendously they would let her go and not care.  And Melissa, if you're reading this I'm sorry I'm referring to you as ""her!!!"" LOL
The rubber band ball I started is now at a fairly impressive size.  We were throwing it against the walls of Ransburg today.  Broke a few lights, busted the sound board a bit, but all in all everything's basically in one piece.  
Chris Vicoli is here, and he is in big trouble.  He has not updated his journal for a long time.  If he refuses to do so, I will throw the above rubber band ball at his face. By the way, he is a wonderful actor!!! (;"

"event","Back to school.  It's sooooooooo hard to come back. Break was pretty uneventful; I stayed home and did stuff around Indy.  I had a job interview Monday with Simon Property Group (the guys associated with the malls- they're the largest real estate group for income producing firms in the United States, and their central headquarters is downtown) that was pretty promising.  But the time involved is immense.  I don't know if I'm willing to plunge in that deep while still going to school and all.  I was asked back for a second interview, but I don't know if I'm going to do it.  I kinda have to make up my mind about it like, oh, TODAY though, so I'm kind of torn on what to do.  
I saw Frank Caliendo from MAD tv at Crackers in Broadripple on Saturday- it was freakin' hysterical.  He was so incredible... what a talent to be able to get up there on stage and do what he did.  The two opening acts were really funny too.  Some white trash lady that said she lived in a trailer park and a black guy- nice combination!  
Did a bit o' spring clothes shopping, seeing as how I have nothing and would have to wear 20 lb. sweaters in the 80 degree weather.  
So I can't wait to hear all about Krista, Chris, Rissa, and Jared's vacation!  I'll live vicariously through you guys. (o;
OH, I do have sort of an exciting story.  When I was grocery shopping at Walmart on Sunday, I was in the toilet paper aisle, and what do I find on the ground?  A hundred dollar bill!  No joke!  I thought, I bet someone is freaking out because they lost this much money, so I went to the customer service desk as fast as I could to turn it in.  The girl at the desk said thanks, took the bill, and I watched her go over to the office to give it to management.  No big deal, right?  Well, when I got home, I thought it was odd that she didn't take my name or anything, so I called Wally World to see if the person who lost it claimed it.  I talked to the manager, and he said no money was turned in that day.  So I gave him my phone number and he went and talked to the girl to see what was up.  He called me back, and said the girl said she never talked to me and didn't get any money....  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!  The manager wanted to catch her, so he asked what I was wearing so he could look it up on the security tapes.  I was all excited because I thought, ""WE'VE GOT HER NOW!""  He called back an hour later and said that the tape is useless because of the angle that the camera is set up; he couldn't see a thing and could never prove anything.  
The moral of the story: if you find money, don't try to be a good samaritan: keep it."

I just wanted to say really quick before I have more time to write later how much fun I had at the surprise b-day party and how much that meant to me.  I love you Krista for planning that; I love you guys that braved the weather to show up; it really shows who your true friends are!!! (:  Will write more later....

"event","Supposed to go see a play tonight with Ron, but I couldn't get a ride there to IRT because of car troubles.  While I'm leaving him the message that I can't go, a thousand little kids walk by from College Mentors for Kids, and I'm trying really hard to concentrate on what I was saying (and came across like a complete bumbling fool, to which most of you will reply, ""When don't you, Ashley?"").  Ron, I'm sorry again that that happened.  Bad situation, long story all around.  

On a happy note, I'm uber-excited to see LOTR with big poopy Bradley, Jared, Rissa, Chris, and Krista this weekend!!!  We gonna have some fun.  I mean, if Rissa would quite trying to make out with me the whole time (save that for later, sweetie... wink wink) LOLOL  We'll make Jared jealous (:  Tell me if anybody else wants to come; we'll make a huge date of it.  I'll letcha know on the time.  Ethan WAS going, but now he can't.

I miss Ron Popp.  It's so bizarre not having him at school, readily available to have a good laugh with, a good cry with, and to have Oprah parties with.... sigh.........

Chris and Emily, you guys rocked in Acting class today!!!  That was tons o' fun to watch. (:

Hey, gotta give mad props to Elizabeth Ann, aka Liz for her part in making that wonderfully wretched little thing.  And just so you guys know, Erika DID make a blindfold for it and it was hilarious, but don't worry- we took it off.  So I want to rsvp for Liz's baby shower on livejournal- how tacky is that?  Hahahaha, gotta be unique and original I guess.  And I'm muchos excited for that.  Liz, are you registered anywhere?  
Let's see.  Friday went to the symphony (thank you Ron for the tickets!)  I love going there simply because the building is gorgeous and I like to touch things, like the oil paintings that are on sale on the walls.  Probably shouldn't me fingering those.  Oops.
Haha.  I just said ""fingering.""
Brad and I wrote messages in the foggy windows, talked to random old people, and caused general mayhem.  Ah, good times.  
Anyway...
I want to know my stupid position for Blithe Spirit.  Is that so much to ask? 
I hate math.  Statistics sucks booty.

"event","I'm sitting in the box office and Jeska's sweet looking display is right here, and out of the corner of my eye, about every 30 seconds, I think a person is standing there staring at me.  But NO.  It's the GARGOYLE sitting there with that smug look on his face.  You'd think I'd learn after the first time.  NOOOOOO.  It's very unnerving when you think someone is right there.  Now I mean, if it was, say, Vin Diesel staring at me (in a good way, not a You're Crazy and I Hate You way or something like that) I would be a pretty happy girl.  Besides the fact he has an 18 year old model girlfriend.  Besides that.  But no.  It's a statue of a not-so-sexually-attractive beast.  Without big muscles and the star of a movie called The Fast and the Furious.  Sigh......

Hooray for Krista- big call back baby!  Chris, don't you even worry about it because I heard through the grapevine, and I know it's true because it's a trustworthy source, that Brad Wright said he was VERY IMPRESSED with you, especially considering you had never auditioned before.  That's so great that you got a ::gasp:: compliment from him!!!!  I don't know if anyone else on livejournal auditioned, but I'm sure you did great if you did.

So if there's a LIVEjournal, does that mean there's a DEADjournal too?"

So I'm hoping that Krista is going to feel better, because I have hereby declared that she is no longer allowed to be sick anymore.  Or Melissa.  If you violate this new  rule, you will be showered with sympathy and love.... oh wait.  That's not really a punishment.  (oh well)

So HAPPY BIRHTDAY TO RON!!!  It's so strange not having him here at school, readily available to get together with and make fun of people and situations.... oh TEAR!

Emily, don't you worry about not coming to ACTF.  You can come next year when it won't be in stupid Evansville where the most exciting thing going on is brick streets.  But I did miss you while we were there. ):

ACTF seemed to be a lot calmer than last year for some reason.  Seemed to be just more hanging out and talking, which was great too.  But the game of musical beds was a fantastic one, and I think it should be implemented every year.  We need to write everybody's name down (ok, not EVERYBODY'S) and draw a name from a hat or something.  Well, I don't know, you could get stuck with someone you're not too thrilled about sleeping with.  Scratch that.

It was lotsa fun shunning a certain someone from coming in my room one night (know who I mean?)  I love Chandra DeNap!!!"

"event","Yeah so I've been planning ever since I got the invite to go to Krista's surprise party, and last night at about 7:30 my stomach starts feeling not-so right.  My brother has been sick with a stomach bug since Thursday, and he threw up on the half hour like clockwork for 12 hours straight... that poor kid was soooooo sick.  And guess who gets it the next day.... me..... and my dad too actually, and my mom is getting it too.  So I'm all mad about the timing of this because I really wanted to go to the party.  But I feel like I'm dying so I'm going to go now.  UGH."

I'm listening to sappy Whitney Houston songs who, by the way, is a crazy psycho druggy (did anyone catch her interview with Diane Sawyer?? That woman is insane).  I have so much Christmas shopping to do still.  Good thing I picked up my measly check from school today.  Too bad it won't stick around for long, though.  Ever been so bored that you didn't have anything to write about?  Yeah, that's how I am right now.  Nothing exciting happens to me anyway, but this is ridiculous.  When watching a 12 year old find out who the real father of her baby is is the highlight of your day, you know you need a life!  I did go to Walmart.  It was a madhouse.  Walmart is so great though; it is so much cheaper than anyplace else.  Yawn."

I don't know why everyone says no one took the show seriously, because from what I've heard everybody worked their patoots off!  And the final product was kick-butt all around!!!! (:
I guess everybody's really stressed out right now, because we all look like we're about to cry any second and everybody's being really negative.  Hello, it's almost CHRISTMAS!!!  hahahahaha  Ok, hello, PRESENTS!!!  It's all about the getting, not the giving.  Isn't that how the saying goes??"

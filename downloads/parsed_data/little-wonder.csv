"event","HOLY MOTHEr!!!  Thank the good lord for technology, for computers, for the internet, for KAZaa, for the radio, and for remixes.

ok so here's the story that i find so exciting, and life altering, that after weeks of not posting here, i choose to post about this, and only this.

So last week I'm listening to the radio, flow 93.5 to be exact.  I'm in my car when this great rnb song comes on that i've never heard before, but see it's not like all those other redundent rnb songs that come out these days, this one's beautiful, the main reason being that the background instruments consist of a guitare and conga drums or something.  So i blast this song, but unfortunately don't catch the title or singer.

A few days later i hear it again on teh radio and find out it's called Officially over you by Tamia.  So i run to my friendly computer and download it.  All's well until i hear whut i donwloaded.  It's the same song, very pretty but a little different.  After a few 'listenings' i realize that the one i downloaded is the original wihtout the drums and a little slower.  So i frantically try to download the one that i heard and try to guess who the remix is with, thought it was Jay-z but no luck.  

So for the past few days i've been listening to the original on my computer, enjoying it, but sulking that i can't find the one i really love.  (wow, that last sentence sounds like i'm talking about a guy hehe)

A few minutes ago i was in my room, organizing my photo album (cough, procrastinating) when the remix of the song comes on the radio.  I blast it and dance like the white girl that i  am.  Afterwards i come down here and figure i'll try to find it again on kazaa.  So this time i type in various titles and BINGO, the search comes up with ""officially missing you remix"" by Tamia feat. Talib Kweli.  SO i almost piss my pants and quickly double click.  (are you sitting on the edge of your seat..cause i am!)....i'm soo delusional, no one's reading this.

Finally it finishes downloading and i listen to it and guess what! IT's the one that i love!! I FOUnd IT!!!!!  So not only did i find the song, but i also find out that the guy in it is TALIb who I also love!!!!  Who would have thought??

GREAtness, i'm gona put it on a cd for the chalet.

sigh......life's tough, but somehow, i manage to make through each day.


i'd like to make 2 additional notes:  another newbie that i really enjoy is ""Right where you stand"" by Gang Starr ft. Jadakiss
And i'd like to point out that the music video for ""Joints and jams"" by black eyed peas is super.

P.s. i'm trying to learn portuguese

obrigado e tcau

I was telling duck how my posts here are always just updates of my previous days...unlike hers which are more random thoughts and ideas.  I COULD change that right now..but I'm way too lazy.

Let's see what's new...summer is good, I'm liking this nice weather we've been having these past few days.  Working is good but shitty at the same time, gota see what i'm gona do about that.  Boxing is awesome, jiu is awesome.
Tami's coming home in like 3 days, yay!

can't fucking wait for NYC, especially the picnic we're gona have in central park (LOaf of bread!).

My front and backyard are BEAUTIFUl, not trying to sound snotty but you just have to see it...like a multi coloured jungle!


Nothing new with boys...gota work on the challenge that duck and i made.

summer school starts soon...too soon :(
if anyone wants a great cardio workout that's fun, get a skipping rope!!!!  I went to york and just skipped for half an hour yesterday and it was great!  

This song is the shizzle

this weekend was lots of fun...in fact, i'm gona go as far as to say that it was TONNEs of fun....crazy me.

pre-weekend: thurs. had my first exam...the easiest one and it went really well!  After that I went with ang to get a new licence b/c i lost both my G and G2 within 2 weeks (ooops!) but it's all good b/c i wanted a new picture anyway...then went to jiu and kicked some butt....as well as started going over the blue belt  curriculum.  (later on i decided i'm not gona go for it yet b/c although i'm pretty confident that i'd get it, i want to be better and more deserving)

fri. night stayed in (oh trust me, it got even funner than that! HOW?? you ask, well keep reading! {at this point i would like to note that funner should definately be a valid word in the english language, thank you})
Saturday tried to do work (failure...EVil procrastination) and just ended up being sad that i was missing jiu.
Saturday night went out with my jew crew for my friend's b-day..at the Beer Markt which was nice and fun and met some awesome ppl. 
Sunday got up nice and early to go on the MS walk with tami which we do every year....awesome time, ran more than 1/3 of the 10 km path, and got some bonding time with tami.
**I'd just like to say that i'm EXTREmely proud of tami b/c her endurance has gotten soooo much fricken better and she kept a nice pace.....and din't give up, ran all the way with me to the end!!! LOVE YOU MIKS
Tonight terri tam and i went to Sotto Sotto (FANcy) for tami's b-day....amazing food, beautiful place and we were not surprised to see a table full of good looking actor-model like men since many famous ppl go to this restuarnt when they're in the T-dot (that sounds so stupid, t dot).
so the whole time we're trying to figure out which actors they are, etc. and after the hotties all walk by and we notice that they're all hugely built...we find out they're the PHiladelphia Flyers.....so although i'm all for the leafs....i might havta start cheering for the other team...jsut cause they're sooo yummmyyyy!

Afterwards we took some random pictures and got the help of some very friendly ppl (I LOVE Friendly strangers).  chilled at Terri's, saw her crazy ass dog and came home.
WE all missed duck's calls...and i feel bad cause i know she was sad that we were out and she wasn't wiht us...duck we all love you!!!

ok now i'm just putting off studying...booourns
can't wait till the 28th!!!

"event","time is on my mind...i just don't have enough of it (i guess like everyone else)....it sucks to be stressed from trying to  figure out how to balance the important elements in my life and then get pissed on by someone who doesn't understand that my life consists of more than just one group of friends and school.  (i just read this over and it doesn't make too much sense to the ave. joe i don't think)
I would love to catch this journal up on the past little while but i wouldn't even know where to start...i'm also real tired right now so that's not helping the thinking process.

this weather sucks....my mom just called me over to her bedroom window to see how all the backyards on our block are frozen solid and you can see lights shining off the frozen ground...since most of the backyards aren't fenced off, it pretty much is a skating rink....and you people call this Spring?? Man, this shit never happens in Israel!  But I guess this shitt weather doesn't really compare to suicide bombs...where am i going with this? who knows!...extremely tired, balbing away...babbling that is

remember boys and girls: SPRINg your clocks forward one hour
i miss my girls very much....i know they feel like i'm neglecting them (the two T's at least)...and i can't wait to see them cause, well..theyr'e my chickas...so next weekend will be awesome cause w'ere going out for tamik's 19th b-day!  I'm also looknig forward to seeing duck..whenever that'll happen.

GGGGrrrrrr....i feel like i'm supposed to chooose between thigns that are equally important to me (apparently we're back on the topic of the first paragraph): training in jiu and capoeira, a few groups of friends, school, soon work, family, travelling, chilling...ahh it's too much....i feel so ironic being stressed out by all this (is it possible to feel ironic??)...b/c i've had times in my life when i could only wish to be this busy and have so many good ppl around me and be so happy....but it's just fucking hard to juggle it...but i keeep telling msyefl to stop complainign!....ok stopping NOW...no, NOW....ok now 

so anyways, last night went to talib kweli/common/sauks concert...doors supposed to open at 8, we get there at 9:30, line is allllll teh eway around the building to the other side (i'm talking 100's of ppl in a line on a freezing cold night)...so terri's bro, his friend and I line up...for like an hour...then i decide to call up my friend hilary who' might show....she tells me she's on the tour bus and i'm like 'fuck off, lier' so seh lets me talk to Talib's bus driver 'zeus' and he tells us to come ot where the front of the line is and get on teh bus...so we do..Amazingly nice bus....so we chill for like an hour, i go to use the really nice washroom and the stupid thing's not flushing..so i'm like tryhing to make it flush and i hear talib and his dj come on...so the dj guy is knocking on the door and i feel so stupid but turns out it wasn't my fault! yay me!!  so we meet talib and chill a litte more then get to bypass the by-now-smaller-line....and enjoy the concert! good times man!

the only shitty thing was that the ocncert started at like 12 and i got home at 5 am...only to wake up at 9:30 to go to capoeira and jiu...oh well...i'm a dedicated fighter!

i don't know if i have time for a guy...but i would like SOmehting....hopefllyy this summer will present some opportunities tee hee.

man this is waaay too long....and i didn't even really say anythign improtant...well i hope for your sake you're not reading this!  although i'm sure it's hard to resist reading about the exciting life of YalE

yale

p.s. i need a driveway talk....i was gona say something more but i realize it's more appropriate for a driveway talk...duck? you hear that??

looking around at the world that we live in makes me sad....so i try to focus on my own life and make that as sweet as possible...and maybe just maybe, that'll take the edge off the sourness of the world

well today was fuckin cold....but i braved the weather and went to the tallest building in the world...yes folks, i'm talking about our very own CN Tower!!  I went with my sis and my bros' friend Lizzie from England.  It was actauly relly fun and cheap since Meritxell works there....and I learned all about how they built the huge mofo...i know i sound like a nerd (which i am) but it truly is incredible.

I had a really awesome weekend: fri. night went to Lula Lounge where some of my jiu boys did a show which was awesome and we danced and chilled and had a jolly night.  Saturday went to the ROM (wow i've been such a tourist lately) for bio..had to answer some stupid questions and felt like i was in gr.6.  Then went to jiu which was aweomse after 2 weeks of not training.  A few of the guys have been telling me that i should go for my blue belt (eventhough i don't have any stripes yet)....and not that the  belt matters to me, but i might go for it sometime soon, who knows!?  After that I went with 2 BEAutiful ladies (ie. korn and tamiks) to a jew party but that didn't work out....so instead we rented 8 mile in which eminem is a HOttie and raps geniously.
Sunday I had to withhold from going to capoeira roda and training with carlos b/c my paretns weren't happy with my lack of studying.  As usual i managed to get SHIT done all day, but not to worry, the whole day was NOT wasted!  My friend michelle called me up to go with her downtwon to be an extra for a tv show.  Had an aweseom time: met some cool ppl (including a cutie named tequila), got my ass featured in the background (only my bubble could achieve such an honour haha)...and got placed right in front of the camera in the 2nd scene.  3 of us background girls decided we wern't going to settle for some fuckin scraps they give to the extras so we snuck into the actors' buffett line and got in on the real deal!  hell ya!!  So i got payed for having fun...sweet...hoepfuly i'll get to do that again.  I never knew the amount of attention that's payed to details in films/tv....like the tiniest things you would never think about, they have to have it just right.  I can't see msyelf working in the entertainment business (i don't think) b/c to me, it seems kinda ironic that sooooo sooo soooooo much money and effort and time is put into something fake/made up when there are soooo many important causes in the world that could use that time/attention/MONEY (ie. world hunger, homelessness, environmental problems, wildlife, etc).  I know that really sounds weird and shit...but i duno...that's jus what i think...for the moment.

MUST study AHHHHHHH I really really want to do well on these exams...please jesus, stop me from procrastinating!!!

word of the day: fuckin

thought of the day: do something nice to a stranger...it will make the both of you feel amazing"

for the first time in a loooong long time I feel really happy even though i don't have a boy.  this experience with the jdate boy totally helped me grow (that sounds So corny)...and now i'm like, if something comes up and i get into a relationship that'd be awesome, i'd for sure love that....but if not, it's all good.  I'm not going to force anything, natural is the way to go (this also applies to make up...um yeah).
I'm sure next week i'll be back to my old self, obsessing over boys and trying to get myself to ask out a guy i'm crushing on...but for now, it's all chills.

I've been talking to duck a lot this past week and that's awesome...i love that chicka....i think we should make a movie about how we are always mentioning past conversations we've had...the whole movie will be us reminding each other of past events/conversations! oh yeah

Man i feel so good....i have phases (i'm sure like everyone else) where i feel like i don't have a lot of friends and get all sad and shit..but right now i feel like i ahve soo many friends and ppl i enjoy spending time with....plus i have my jiu, and i've been doing some stand up jiu lately which brings back sooo many memories....and last night i had my first CApoeira lesson (a brazilian martial art that slaves used to do)!!! IT's the most amazing thing...and has made me realize that i love the whole brazilian culture and that my #1 place i wana travel to is brasil.  I'm going to start taking capoeira regularly, hoping to get good at it..just havta figure out how to balance that with jiu and the rest of my life.
Last sunday i trained with carlos...soooo goood....we always do mma (like some grappling, some stand up and some boxing).
so on sunday we did ground work and i got some good drills to practice with one of those balance balls...and then carlos' boxing coach (who's apparetnly one of the first boxing coaches in canada) came by and he trained us individually...sooo damn good..boxing's awesome...carlos is fighting in pride in 2 weeks....i hope he wins!

i'm in the process of searching for a summer job...i can't believe i only have like 4 weeks of 1st year left! holy crapola!!  I've only applied at the new kelsey's so far but they seemed to like me so i'm gona try to get them to hire me....i'm also in the process of trying to get a job at youthgoraphy...that'd be sick.  On friday i'm gona apply at other restaurants and we'll see...i just hope that i'll have some kind of job by the start of may.


i was gona do that ""top 5 list' that herzog started..but i know she'll get pissed if everyone's copying her...so i'll just do one:
Top 5 conversations with duck (these are just the 1st ones that come to mind):
1. germans don't have honks
2. something about lesbians...?
3. i wana rewind..it's ok..i wana rewind..it's ok
4. laughing at dimitri's for 20 min (not really a conversation)
5. our crazy driveway talks (yes, this coutns as one bitch)

"event","well..haven't written here in a long time.....

these days i'm realy happy...still have that STUPID fucking SHIT procrastination habit..but other tahn that i'm dandy :)

Last night was fun....drove downtwon with my friend joe, stopped by eric's show which was cool...it was great to see that kid...by the way eric, i really like your coat hehe.
Then we went to my jiu dojo...chilled there for a little and then went to second cup cause i was hungry..had marble coffee cake....LIERS!! i didn't taste any coffee OR marble! 
then we went over to Lula lounge where we pretended we knew how to dance samba (brazilian dancing)...soo much fun....I love going to clubs where there's no attitude and everyon'es there to just have a good time.
Then I got home and talked to this guy on the phone until 2:30 am....whut is it about late night conversations that's sooo good? I mean...you can have good conversations during teh day..but at night they're always so much better...does anyone know whut i mean?!

Today I gota do a lot of work as usual...figure out cards and b-day presents for my siblings...then tonight going to Babalu's for my sis's b-day to salsa! yay!! should be funny.

Trying to get off my lazy ass and apply to get a job...i don't know whut i'm goan do this summer but hopefully something fun and interesting (and well paying..is that possible?)

Next week I'm going on a date...very excited.


I was watching ""A dating Story"" yesterday and can I just say that some people are fucked up?!....I know that at the end of a first date, ti's gona be a little awkward..not knowing whether you should kiss or just hug or whatever..but you DON""T prolong the awkwardness by stadning there face to face making small talk.  IT was torture watching this one date...at the end they just stood there asking each other if they had fun...then b/c the guy was soo nervous he calls her by the wrong name...then they continue the stupid small talk and i'm like ""KISs already!! Make out....run away!! I dont' care just stop this TORTURE""....so they finally hug and kiss on the cheek...but i'm thinking, why are ppl so ironic?? I mean, they're both nervous, they both know that the other person is nervous..why don't you just laugh aobut it..get it out of the way..i duno.

I'm so mad, talib kweli and common are going on a tour but they're not coming to canada! fuck..that would be the HYPEst concert ever.

My friend carlos is fighting in Pride in march...gona be an awesome card....b/c he's fighiting a tough opponent AND my fave. fighter minotauro is fightin too.  Yay for violent sports hehe. 

""This morning, I woke up
 Feeling brand new, I jumped up.
 Feeling my highs and my lows, in my soul, and my goals.
 Just to stop smokin, and stop drinking
 And I've been thinkin- I got my reasons
 Just to get by, just to get by
 Just to get by, just to get by""

"event","..i've started listening to this group lately (n.e.r.d aka neptunes...this song is the shit

I made a realization and a decision today....I realized that it's nice that I have a lot of things that are important to me right now...I train a lot in jiu, I'm studying kinesiology, I have a lighter sched so i have more time to work out and relax..and I have my friends (the boyfriend area is the only place I feel lacking :)....but I realized that with all that..i'm missing something..I don't feel like i'm DOING something..like i'm really contributing my time wisely...and i'm always planning stuff for the future (ie. in the summer i wnat to volunteer in a physio clinic, and do photography, and work, travel, etc.)....but that's always in the future.
so a few days ago I saw a commercial on tv for Big Brothers and Sisters of Toronto..a non-profitable organization that i've heard of before and that caught my attention b/c I've always wanted a little brother or sister, I love kids, and I think this is an amazing way to help those kids who deserve much more than they have with time instead of money.....so today i went on the website and signed up...and i'm looking forward to getting an application form.

I think this is a really good idea and i'm really happy that I'm doing it...I'm always thinking of what i wana do LATER not NOW...and so NOW i'm going to do this...i'm very excited.

well i just wanted to share that :)

oh and i'm hoping to visit my duck real soon!!! Oui Oui"

last friday went drinking with my guy friends at a shitty bar called the brit at yonge and clarke....but itwas fun times and the guys bought me 5 drinks..after which i was still convinced that i wasnt' DErunk...but the next day i had a headache..which never happens...

had a crazy week....last monday I was crazy stressing about whether or not to drop calc...finally after getting some opinions on the matter, I did..and i'm soooo happy!! 
So now this semester is very light for me, giving me lots of time to NOT procrastinate, workout, jiu, hang with friends, etc.  oh and visit duck (february I hope) of course!

Friday I went shopping with tamika at the outlets...baught 3 very nice sweaters oh and i finally got new glasses which actually look good on me! (thx upsonofa).
Friday nigth went out for my b-day with two thirds of my girls and had a grand ol' time (COUGH).  my chickas' are awesome i must say!
Saturday I went to jiu which was fun times and then at night watched Pride at elliotts...Minotoro was AWEsome, once again finishing with a beautiful armbar...he is officially my favourite fighter.
Afterwards my jiu friends and I went to Roxy Blu where we drank and danced and saw my coolest friend Omar drum it up on the bongos...AMAZing...had an awesome night.

other than the wind and coldness..i love the winter...whenever it snows, espcially those big flakes, i just can't help smiling..walking around campus in the white wonderland....is it just me or does snow make everything quiet, and make you feel like you're alone in teh beaiutful whiteness?..hmmm maybe it's just me :)

Sunday my paretns came back and i just chilled.
Today was aweomse, made a workout friend whcih will help motivate me to get in shape....and enjoyed my light schedule.

...tomorrow is a new day and life looks promising.."

so we went to that japanese place at yonge and clarke, under the condos...i've been there before but apparently the management has changed...and i'm not exaggerating one bit when i say that it was the worst service i have ever experienced in my life...that i can remember.
WE had to ask twice for water, they forgot our soup, they brought each of our orders at different times, then forgot half of my meal and then charged me twice for it, they never once asked if we needed anything or filled our glasses, didn't ask if we need dessert, and then they accused us of lying..so we left 50 cents tip....i felt kinda guilty but it was raelly horrible...the guy from the table beside us had to go up to a waiter to ask to order.

well i was appalled to say the least, but at least teh company was good! Pattie!!

had a good break...went by too fast...got to see duck and can't fucking wait for the day when we go down for our morning coffee and people-watch in the great city that is nyc!"

Seeing as that it makes me so happy, you'd think i'd do this every time...but no, apparently i love stressing out..ah well.

so yeah, i'm thankful this exam period is almost over and then i get to relax in israel...and then it's back to schoolio..but i'm living in the moment...roight

i'm 19 in seventeen days...but who's counting:) hehe i hope it's a good one!  
I'm so exicted to see my duck....even though i'll just get to see her for one day, but 1 is better than none!

i don't believe in god 

I went to jiu yesterday after not going for 3 weeks...holy shiz nizzle...it was awesome! 3 weeks feltl like 3 yrs..but it was worth the wait b/c everyone was excited to see me..and vice versa.  My boys are so cute, I love them so much!  then after rolling for a bit, i was supposed to go home and study for this morning's kin exam...but instead, i ate subs with elliott and watched Mr. deeds (which was hilarious).  But all in all, it wasn't so bad that i got home at 12:30 'cause the exam was bullshit today...

so yeah, can't wait to see my sis in a few days, and of course my homeland....shopping baby! oh and the food...oh my GOD

just a thought...every time the clock says 11:11..i make a wish...but every time it's the same wish..and it hastn' come true..you'd think i'd learn..

"event","I just wana say that I totally agree with Noah....new hip hop is mostly shit...I mean I listen to 93.5 when I feel like dancing around or whatever..and here and there i'll hear a good song...but mostly it's all about money and pimping and whatever....Redman/Methodman are the shit...as well as the Roots....in addition to Noah and Aaron's list...I also havta add Talib Kweli and Common..who are both AMAZING hip hop artists.  Hip hop is all about telling a story or rapping about something you belive in/soemthing that's important to you....so here is a song by Common called ""I used to love H.E.R."".....just read the lyrics, and make sure you read the last line too!!...BOOyaka! 
p.s. the third verse is saying EXACtly what noah is saying..read on

verse one:
I met this girl, when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school, when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
on the regular, not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money, no studs was mic checkin her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggaz, had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
and just cool out, cool out and listen to her
Sittin on a bone, wishin that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
because we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh yo, when she was underground
Original, pure untampered and down sister
Boy I tell ya, I miss her

Verse Two:

Now periodically I would see
ol girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body but she started gettin thick quick
DId a couple of videos and became afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about, stoppin the violence
About my people she was teachin me
By not preachin to me but speakin to me
in a method that was leisurely, so easily I approached
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin, so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in L.A.
And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the pro-black, was goin out of style
She said, afrocentricity, was of the past
So she got into R&B hip-house bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becomin well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell, by how her titties hung

Verse Three:

I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
But once the man got you well he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
that she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs lickin rock and dressin hip
And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talkin about poppin glocks servin rocks and hittin switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
Tellin me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed, but so many niggaz hit it
That she's just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
I see niggaz slammin her, and takin her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back hopin that the shit stop
Cause who I'm talkin bout y'all is hip-hop"

Picked up some alco-mo-hol and drank up at Dom's..keeping quiet of course...angela is the horniest, funniest drunk...even though she spilt woody's on dom's carpet....walked over to the bus stop....getting some exercise by ringing doorbells and running our asses off....waiting for the bus for like an hour (dom trying ot reassure me that it's coming)....but it was well worth it, because as Eyal kept remding us, he got to see Angela's ass haha!! We sang some songs (pretty well i must say)....and eyal tried to teach ang how to grind!! Oh man the laughs! Finally we call a cab and find the one driver who has no clue where he's going...so we finally get to York and dance it up for one hour and then get a ride home...the end...PATTIE!!

Fri. night I went to elliott's to watch UFC with the jiu crew...fun times...some very entertainig fights...we put down votes and i got most of mine right (unfortunatly no money was bet).  Today I caught up on some sleep and actually got some bio done!! Finally....it's sad to say, but i think other than some philosophy reading, today was the first day i actually did work. Fuck i'm the worst!! Ah well...any other way, I wouldn't be the Yale you all love and adore (and respect, look up to, drool over...i can go on forever:)
Just got home from babysitting..almost killed myself while watching this show on Treehouse with 3 adults dressed up as monsters who play pretend all day...they are clearly high!!..sheesh, kid's shows these days......watched monster's inc whihc was adorable and now tami's coming over to chill and wathc some of our video from gr.7 and the chalet.

"event","one reason today was good: I got in touch with all 3 of my girls...
lunch was fun...and yummmy...even with the ugliness of the restaurant!  It kind of sucked that we didn't get to chill more..but monday night will be fun....
I finally spoke to my duck...greatness...i can't wait for you to visit and have a driveway talk!! another conversation we forgot for the list: Duck: My left nostril is plugged
Yale: holy shit!! I swear that I was just about to say the EXAct same thing!! hahahh


philosophy is great...i encourage EVERy single one of you to at least take one phil. course in your life time....you don't have to be all artsy or anything...it opens your mind...

it's fun when people are unpredictable once in a while...it's refreshing to hear an unexpected reaction (terri i'm talking about you...haha you prob have no clue what i'm talking about)

lately i've been questioning religion, god, etc...hmmm....

I realized this past week that with some ppl/ situations i'm too dependent and undecisive..i'm going to work on that

Yesterday I got my G class license..yay!! NO more Tests for yale!!  it was actually fun..my tester guy was great and we had a whole deep conversation in the car...which i'm not sure if he's allowed to do..?...

PUB NIGHT next thurs...if you wana join me and my Buds you're welcome to!

hopefully trainign with carlos on sunday..i miss that kid
next friday going to elliott's for UFC....should be fun..hopefully as good as PRIde...but I dont know if anything can beat that fight..shit...

IN conclusion: I Love it when songs have stories...like something you have to follow along...or if there's a hidden message...it's great....for example...COMMOn..he has this song where he raps about this girl who he's crazy about and stuff and he's describing her and you imagine this girl right...well at the end he tells you that the girl is... HIP HOP.


p.s. does anyone know when the new season of THIRd WATch is going to be on????"

Welll the first day of school was fun times!!  It's funny b/c i feel like the next few days are all going to be ""the first days' just cause each day has different classes....
so yeah....Angela and I went to school at 7:30 for our 8 am kin lecture....what do we do first thing?? Screw up our classes...not only do we go into the wrong lecture hall...we also sit down, then get up and complain that ther'e no lefty-chair-table thingies...then move over and sit down again...then ask a girl to check which class it is..then realize that we are in the wrong class!  So anyway, the kin class was good....just introductory stuff....then i had my calculus lecture which was interesting (cute prof)...but i definately have to go over my OAC calc....met 2 nice guys.....then had an hour break and I sat down outside on the grass in the shade and ate my lunch...so peaceful! I jsut sat there...looking around and loving it ALLLL.....soo manny different types of people....sooo many hottties!! :P
After that i headed over to my volleyball class wehre the teacher was nice and the class looked like fun....then on my way out of the building i went over to look at a board of the martial arts classes they offer and this cutie was telling his friend that he wants to do martial arts so i told him that he should do jiu jitsu..which is waht i'm doing wink wink! :)  
Then i met up with clausner and then angela nad jeff...chilled....then went to my bio lecture which was cool...i have 3 profs in that class and one of them is a crazy australian who studies insects..kind of reminded me of Mr. SEvier....
After this I worked out a bit in the gym (i think Tait Mackenzie..which is the sports centre...is gona be my second home...)...and the ntook the bus home where i chatted with NIMa! yay nima!!!

and now i showered and ate fruit salad and i feel soo pumped!

"event","A hoy Hoy!  Well let's recap my frosh experience so far:
Monday Night I spontaneously decided to go to my college's party with eyal (golani) and angela (and angela's friend brandon).....it was ok except that we didn't meet anyone and the 3 of them stood there while i  danced (eyal claims that he wan't to dance but WHATEVEr)....so yeah.
Tuesday morning I went off with Ashley clausner and her friend to academic frosh.  It was pretty fun and i met this nice girl named melanie.  We played games during the day and I got to race on this blow up maze thing and i got a 'carpet burn' ouch!! I went home to relax and then at night I went back to party.  Met some people and ended up partying with a girl who's family is friends with my family....it was so much fun!!  I bumped into Josh and Jeff a few time which was cool (and we will def. party again)....and even TOllman!!! That was wickid, seeing that boy...he was soo cute and drunk and he even danced with me a little! haha...he told me that BEAR is screwed becase they put him at Glendon campus which is the french speaking campus!!! Apparently he can't swithc out until after first year...so yeah i feel bad for my panda!!!
Today I slept in big time....and took a bus to york....sat down with some ppl for pizza and then decided to get a ride home...and here i am.
Gona get shit done in the next few days, party at night, work out (york has a great gym which i joined!)....and get ready for univeristy!!!

tonight should be HOT with a few parties to go to...and fri. night i wana head downtwon for clubbing after holiday dinner.

IF anyone know's Levitt's new cell #...please let me know!

This summer has been incredible.  Like everyone else, I can't believe it's about to be over.  Terri, Tami and Duck are the bestest friends I could ask for and I'm sooo happy we are all so close.  Last night was a lot of fun...great freinds, great food, great times and a great hostess! (thx Ekstein!)  AFterwards, Terr, Tam, duck and I had our tearful goodbyes....it was sad,,but i think the 4 of us truly belive that we will be friends forever.  I was kinda bothered becasue I have never had a problem crying infront of others...in fact, I cry really easily....but last night I was dry eyed when the girls wwere bawling...and then right when I dropped off Tami, i start weeping in my car,driving home.  I was sooooo close to driving to Duck's house again and knocking on her door...but I fought that urge.  All in all...i'm excited for duck (and for all of us starting univeristy)....and i'm happy I have got to hang out and hopeuflly continue to hang out with such a great and fun group of ppl! 

This week should be damn good....my parents are going to Germany for a week which is damn sweet!  I have a few plans, but my days are mostly free for me to do anything!  I will definatly soak up this last week of freedom before the school work starts piling up!!

I'm very excited for York...although very nervous for those first few hours of Frosh...although Josh reassured me lsat night....I know this year will be a very exciting one!

I don't know who I will or won't talk to before they leave to uni....so I'd like to wish everyone good luck and to have fun and to appreciate every opportunity they recieve!

WEEEEEEE!!!!

greeeeat weekend! Fri. night just chilled and went to sleep early....saturday woke up at 7:30 (which actually felt really good), washed and vacummed the cars with DAd
then got ready and headed to TAste of The Danforth with Tami....it was wayyyyyyyy way too hot for my liking to be walking outside, so we only walked around for like an hour...lots of ppl, interesting looking food, cute stores, and i ate a samosa (yummy indian thingie) and a Rosemary Lamb pie which was Delic!
after that tamika and I split up and i headed to queen st. where i went to the store ""Showroom"" on a recomendation from herzog.....they had cute sketchers skater shoes...the kind with the big tongue so you don't have to lace them up...and normally sketchers are too damn expensive, but htye were on sale for half price! so i baught the white ones with yellow trim! SWEEEEEET
then headed over to JIU where i had tonnnes of fun rolling with several guys....they were actually challenging fights and i managed to get 2 chokes and one arm bar....nice
after a few hours of this, i got ready to go and elliott invited me to go out with a bunch of guys to the danforth
so this guy Bryan, elliott and me went to elliott's house where i took a nice shower, and then the 3 of us ate dinner at taco bell (i know it's garbage, but once every few yrs won't kill me...right?)and then headed down to the danforth to meet up with two other guys...couldn't reach them and there were a shitload of ppl there so we decided to head back to elliott's place where we watched Eddie Murphy ""Delirious"" which was SOOOO histerical!! A lot of his movies lately suck, but he is one gifted man!  If you've never seen Delirious Or RAW, you must!!! do yourselves a favour!! my fave, is when he imitates white ppl...greatness
After this we were hungry again so we went to the 7/11 where we hooked up some munchies, parted with bryan and elliott and i went back home and ate hotdogs, chocolate, and watched Friday.
Pretty funny movie, i must say...only in the last scene, while we were both about to drop unconcsious, did i realize that it wasn't the same Friday movie i had seen before (i guess i saw the second one..)
But they were both damn good....ice cube is good and chris tucker is dammmmn annoying but funny 

so i slept over there and got up at around 11 and then took the subway back home.

oh yeah and i also got Mountain tea from the danforth which is the bestest TEA EVER!!!

right now i should be training with Carlos, but i'm way too lazy/tired/bruised up
shit, i look like i have an abusive boyfriend or seomthing, my legs and arms are all purple and red!
SHIATE

on the car ride home, my mom's like ""one day you're gona havta stop doing jiu, cause the bruises don't look good"" and i'm like ""YEAH fecking righT!! lets think, what's more importatne to me....what ppl think about my bruised up body....or practicing my loved sport, JIU jitsu!"" shit, that's a toughie

so yeah, now i'm all peachy keen...hpefully gona see my friends eli and dre tonight
tom. i might work and then pack up for my chicka trip to the chalet!

Sunday I""m hoping to train with carlos
and i pretty much have no other plans! LONER

This week has been really good...got to see pretty much all my friends...

last night jiu  was soo much fun...i brought a notebook to write notes about techniques..i'm really happy i'm doing that b/c it's soo much easier for me to practice them like that....This guy bryan is supposed to be a good artist so i asked him to draw me soemthing...like a girl doing an armbar or something
So he draws this girl with big boobs and a tight shirt with ""jiu jitsu"" on it....doing this weird strech which looks a tad provocative.....it didn't resemble me at all...except for the fact taht she seemed to be a jiu chick...but when the guys saw it, they all assumed he was drawing me in a sick sort of way...so i got sooo embarrassed and ran to hide the notebook... I don't even think it looks like me, i guess guys are all sickminded and don't realize that there is a possibility that he wasn't drawing me

ANYway...I rolled with omar and he said my game's improving which is good...my stand up def. sucks so i gota work on that.
Elliott was there and we rolled and then took the bus/subway toghehter...i'm really happy we're still cool and can be friends.....i realize that i'm so slow when it comes to telling whether someone is high....he smoked up before jiu and i was with him the whole night and i culdn't tell..he had to tell me

ah well, i guess i'm just innocent is all :P

OH man life is good..but...
soo many ppl are leaving me soon:(

Duck guessed it right away, and then we sat there, staring at Aspire and making stupid songs.  The advice for the day is: if you wana be somebody, go somewhere....wake up !!!

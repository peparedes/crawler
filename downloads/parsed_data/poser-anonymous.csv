"event","And noone else is listening. What do I want to say today? Every day I have to reassure myself. I can write. I can paint a picture with the power of my language. English! =) Hablo Espanol? Nope. I speak English, and I speak it WELL!!!!!!! I enjoy writing. Always have. It's something that used to be fun, but I've fallen out of practice. All I have to do is talk. I can talk with a keyboard and I can talk with a pen. I can even talk with my mouth. I just need something to say. I have things to say. Important things. Valuable things. Intelligent things. The things I tell myself surprise, and delight me. Soooooo WHY??? WHY WHY WHY can't I say them out LOOOOUUUD????? =\ Like what? Uuuhh I don't know. Things about love mostly. That's been a big issue for me since I left high school. How can I tell the difference between love and infatuation, when I never give it a TRY???? I want to fight. I'm sick of myself, and so I think I'm going to change. It won't happen over night. It will take time, but it has already begun. So now I find myself wondering what I will become. I want music in my life. I can hear it in my head all the time. Holding it in is getting harder and harder. Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 
Here we go. Here comes a song. Duuuuuuuh. Walking makes me feel good. I walk all the time. One of these days I will walk OUT of my mind. And when that happens I'll be feelin fine. Walking makes me feel good. I walk all the time. Walking eases pain makes me eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkkkeeeinfaoingjapigaipe heetehrhehehehehe nooo hahaha wha   wha  wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha heh anyways uuh walking yeah it makes me feel great When I walk I donttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt use breaks I walk to pass time and to heal MY mind and it works too Im so lost right now it is no longer funny Im glad today turned out to be sunny cause it started out gray and gee thhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhatts great I dont mind gray days Theyre fine but the sun is so much better when it SHINES! The beatles are a funny band they take me on a tour lost lost I lost I lost loser loser me me yup ok no no NO! heeeelp heeeelp I feel funny... Im going for a walk. OOOH YEAH! Maybe when I come back I'll have something relevant to say. Maybe that's my PROBLEM I always want something important to say. It doesn't have to be so deep don't give it so much MEANING the only subject you need is how the day is SUNNY =) hmmmm ok so what did I say where did I say it to who and when? or... why! No no I've lost it again what have I lost? TTTTTTHHAATTTTTT I dont know.

"event","Outside myself, I see all my problems. I think I've finally figured out how to solve them.
To learn how to talk is my goal. Soon I'll start school, and soon I'll find answers, about things that have happened so far. Why do I stall, how did I fall, where did I lose that fire? And why don't I let myself dance? What happened to having friends? Fun? Anyone? Hmm... I know I'll do better this time around.
Because I will LET myself do better. Now I've found a reason, it doesn't need a rhyme. It just has to give me things to fill my free time (It may not NEED rhyme but I'm still going to try to give it some ;). I want to improve myself, and build up some confidence, so I can learn how to live, and learn to be free, and learn to let myself be me. The human spirit is real, and so is the soul. Now it's time to show that I am filled with both. Now it's time to find that connection between my body and mind. And when I do find it I won't let it go. I'm going to keep the feeling alive forever! I may not find love, but I will find some friends. Because I've had them before. Of this I am SURE. I will find more. And do you know, that alcohol and weed are great. They can be fun, and let you cut loose, and get you in touch with that creative side.  But without reason, or for the wrong reasons, they will only bring pain. (Actually they dull pain, along with other, more important things, and in the end this only leads to misery, and misery is equal to pain.)  Alcohol at least I know is this way, but I'm not so sure about the weed. There's just too many unknowns. I've stopped smoking for now to clear my head, before I go back to school. In a month or two I'll try it again just to see how it really makes me feel. I do know one thing. Excess is BAD. You know what I'm saying? Too much of anything will hurt. Well maybe not ANYthing. There are better ways to get high. Music is one way I've enjoyed in the past, and I will enjoy it again. YO YO soooooooooo I'm gonna go. It's been fun talking to myself in a healthy way. :)  Goodbye (said the AOL guy.)"

hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

Thats about all I have...

Hmmmmmmmmmmm. TO SAY!!  Heh.  I like talking to myself. I think everybody does... Fundamentalist Christians are wrong... !!! What does it all mean? Heh, mean, rhymes with bean... I know a guy whose last name is Bean. At work, we call him Frijole. I went walking downtown today. I had a good time. I ran into a guy who was making a drawing of downtown Juneau. It was for a painting he's going to make. It looked really cool. It was a rough sketch in water colors. CRAZY CRAZY WE'RE ALL OF US GOING CRAZY and that makes all of us the same :)Because if everyone is crazy then noone is insane. Sanity is for posers. Hmmmm... burn!! =) Heh. Also when I was downtown some dude standing outside of a tourist shop asked where I've been. He thought I was someone who used to work at Heritage. Said I looked just like the guy. I thought that was kind of strange. Im in there all the time anyways letting the girls take my money... They make me leave big tits... I mean tips! Hahaha... it's evil! But I don't mind. :) I love this website. It's like talking to myself, but other people can read it too! I don't go as fast here though... Maybe I should give it a try because I can type pretty fast when I want to. But sometimes I just can't think fast enough to keep up with my typing speed. Maybe I smoke too much pot? Hmmm does it slow me down I think it does but I dont care cause I like drugs ;) and if you think theres something wrong with ah damn I lost it!!! noooo I was so close to breaking through... through what I dont know. I know it was in there somewhere.. a good song... its like having something on the tip of your tongue. Something to say but you just can't quite say it. Can't quite see what it is. Can't quite get a grip... Just can't shake those hips! hahaha I like to dance, and I don't care if I can't. :) I want to have fun again. What happened to me??!!! :( Talk is cheap. If you want to do something than do it! So I got this job and its really lame cause all I do is kill time all day and I wish I could be doing something better but I've got bills to pay =\ I'm tired of killing time, and I want to get laid :) Really really bad actually... It's pretty much all I think about. Heh. Walking around downtown there were beautiful ladies everywhere, walking in gangs.  I passed this group of 4 really hot ones and on a radio in a store the song Girls Just Want To Have Fun was played. I started singing along but changing the words making my own song. It went something along the lines of I want to have fun with you blah blah blah blah (Only it was musical so it wasn't stupid and it wasn't those exact words). It was really cool... I was singing it for a while and I got a lot of words hammered out. It gave me hope :) Let me show you how much fun I can be! That was one of the lines. And there was a bunch of other stuff that rhymed with that. Well it didnt all rhyme with that... songs that rhyme the same sound all the time suck... its too much like rap. Some rap is cool though. It's definitely it's own form of art. I don't think anyone can argue with that. It's just not a very good one IMHO. :)

Work is cool, I work with a crazy mexican dude. Drumming is still fun. I've been  drawing stuff recently. Not much, just some weird crazy shapes and things with a pen, but I think it looks artistic. I got a new hackey-sack. It's hand-made, and it's made of suede. It's a freestyle dirtbag with a well balanced 8 panel design! I purchased it from the Canadian Footbag Alliance, in Canada (from their webpage.) And as always, I'm ready and waiting for another LIVE SHOW!!!! The Misfits concert rocked. I forgot to bring some drumsticks for Robo to sign, but I did get them to sign my shirt and my Heritage coffee card. The mosh pit was intense. It was the first time I've ever been in a real mosh pit. I need more. Shows around here suck because the only ones who mosh with me are little high-schoolers and I just knock them all down. Hahahaha!!!!! But not at this concert! I was covered in bruises after the show, and my eye had a small purple mark around it that almost looked like a black eye. Someone elbowed me in the face. After the concert I went stumbling around down town and people were asking if I was drunk, but I wasn't. The music did it to me! And the moshing. It gets me so high."

It's up to me to change the way I think and what I do in my life. Fucking grow up. I'm going to find a job, damnit. I was singing along to less than jake in the car on my way home from keiths place (watched a sharks tale, ate some papa murphys thin crust pepperoni and took some hits off the bong, good times) and I think I actually sounded good. I cant be sure though. I've seen that show Motormouth on VH1 and I know how people can be somewhat disillusioned when it comes to there singing skills. (Somewhat??) But I had the volume turned down real low and I was singing kinda loud and what I heard didn't sound to bad. And I know I have the ears for it because I've been trained musically, starting in the 5th grade. I might not have been the most astute person ever to play an instrument but I know I'm not tone deaf.

So I've been thinking... I'm cool :P I wrote some crap I wanted to share. Just some crap I've needed to get out for a few years now... read it or not. I don't care. It's kind of a mix between my attempt at writing some lyrics and me just writing some stuff down. Just bullshitting. There's also a few stories mixed in there about some of the crazy stuff thats happened to me. :)

<lj-cut>
A song about how my life has become fucked up 
No job no money payments due soon living at home 
my parents are here but I'm alone I know that they love me 
and I shouldnt be so sad because 
if I look back my life isnt that bad 
I've got a roof over my head and food to eat 
but something isnt quite right 
I need to earn it for myself stop being a moocher 
I feel like a homeless person and I'll probably end up one
im cynical and bitter like an old person waiting for life to get over with
im through feeling like that im ready for change im gonna face life with a grin
I'm not even cynical, there are just some things that SUCK
Things nobody likes. Like bills. Bills suck. And rednecks. 
Nah rednecks dont suck. theyre funny. I dont want to be one though.
Other things that suck include... wow Im not cynical at all. thats cool.
Bills are great, got some more? I'll take whatever you can throw at me because its just money
I dont care. Maybe cause my parents pay them? What the hell happens to someone who cant pay?
Is that bankruptcy? Do they go to prison? What happens when they come to collect?




I feel like I could be something if I actually tried
I feel like my brain has not been fried
ive never felt smart and never fit in
ive always been an outcast just playing my games
i feel like a rapper singing to my crapper
cause thats all rap is you can call me a cracker
punk rock music is how I get my kicks
I also like making out with random chicks
hey thats not to bad, it has a nice ring. In fact I could turn it into something real.


Turn into something real...
Turn into something other people can feel...

can you dig it?
I guess...
blaaah heh
I need to get me some... confidence! hahaha cause I've never been felt before? ... :(
Everyone needs to get some! plaguirism? :) sorry division (POSSIBLE BAND/SONG/ALBUM NAME)
Maybe I should just write some crap down and pull lyrics from that hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhmmm
Thats the way to do it I think, theres some good stuff up above there. I could make up stories about how hardcore I am
I was raised on the street dude I grew up with that shit I always had to watch my back im tough but I have a cream filling
dont mess with this, I went to college so im smart ill tear you apart i dropped out after a year because I sucked
now i want to go back? maybe I dont suck anymore id like to give it another try i know i can succeed the only thing is,
whats my reason for going back I want it to be my future but im afraid that im only going back for one reason
A GIRL hah well is there something wrong with that? college degrees are good to have or so they say. I might go back and itll still suck and she might not even
be there she'll probably leave this piece of shit city we live in, and go back to the real place that she came from! 
ive seen her 1 time all year and I still think about her...
why do I do that? this feeling cant be real its too much like every song i ever heard
now I guess the question is, has the music ive been listening to all my life forced me to feel this way
or do the people that have written it down before me also feel this way
this is all pointless because I know Ill never have what it takes to ever ask anyone out on a date
fuck dating I just want to make out with some chick on the couch that would be fun thatd be great
that sounds way better than some crappy date go eat some food go see a show and if your lucky you might get a little something at the end
hey now dating doesnt sound to bad Im hungry now and I can always use a show. and what can be said about a good blow - its cool?
I guess, but I wouldnt really know... I wish I could tell you its the best thing in the world because
I know a lot of guys who feel that way but until I try it I wont say I know
I like one thing though.. self gratification heh yeah thats cool I self gratified in my brothers apartment this morning
it was cool cause I woke up drunk and he left for work
last night was fun. It started with a simple plan. A plan to find some buds. It started with a fourty and ended with a bottle of mac
Thats macnaughtons for all you laymen out there its whiskey duh good shit too heh in the plastic bottle

I want to join a band! Its weird I know now that I can do this the background is there the way ive grown up, how ive lived my life everything thats happened
I have it all! I can write songs. The material is there. I'm even from a shitty small town that sucks! It can be fun sometimes though cause theres some cool people here
The only problem I have is that theres NO good music here and the few live shows we do get are not enough. most of them are in bars anyways
the only solution to my problem is joining a band and making my own show. I'd like to try singing its tough though
you gotta have balls. thats really all it takes, that and a little bit of talent, but thats what practice is for
I'll get better. fuck it im done being afraid.
sing like no one is listening and dance like no one is watching!
lets see if I can keep this up heh itll be gone in five minutes im sure but I'll try and keep it locked away somewhere
no way I cant lock this away something this cool can not be held back! I am going to ROCK this town.
I've only felt this way one other time. And that was on drugs. Drugs never last, but I'm sober now.
I'm already feeling scared again though. Just thinking about grabbing that mic and wailing out a song... 
Aaahh so now we get to the real problem. I can't see myself. I look in the mirror and see nothing there.
There was one time that I looked into a mirror and saw a real person. He was cool too. He was someone I want to be.
He looked like some guy from a movie. Is that me? Do I look like that all the time or only when I'm HIIIIIIIGH?
I was so baked... and I followed that up with 4 shots in a row, and a 5th shot a few minutes later.
I stood in the bathroom for 10 minutes staring at myself and thinking, laughing, and bouncing around.
I never cried though... really... crying is stupid. At one point I was just screaming to myself with my forehead pressed up against the mirror. The world was bending at that point and I think I heard a snap.
But anyways, I know that if I could just get to the point where I can look in a mirror and see that person all of the time I know that I can turn into something real...

How do I do that? I'd like it to be that way when I'm sober but maybe I need to start drinking all of the time.
I do have to get ready for my 21st birthday. It's coming up soon, and I feel unprepared. People are lining up to buy me drinks, and I'm going to get hammered. 
Had a bad hangover today. It's almost gone now though. Wasn't too bad. I just felt like I was going to throw up for about 6 hours.
I can deal with that. I almost lost it a few times though. Driving to the valley was an experience... Driving to my brothers apartment last night was a REAL experience!
I shared 4 fourties with 2 other guys and had 3 shots of macnaughtons, and all the while we were smokin pot.
I stole 20 bucks from my mom's purse yesterday. I also stole a cigarette from my brother and smoked that. I'm such a fucking rebel. I gave the loot to Keith and sent him out to the bar to find some weed for me. He came back with 2 bags! The guy handed him an extra sack on accident, and we smoked it all. Oh and my dad gave me some money to go to the store and buy some ice cream for him. I kept the change from that and used it to put gas in my truck.

Thats all folks! The beast is going back into his cage now. :P"

"event","... but not long enough, apparently. I can't think of anything to write about. I guess I don't have anything to write about because all I've been doing is playing World of Warcraft. I could write about that but I won't. OH YEAH!!!! I went up to Eaglecrest for the first time in three years a week from yesterday! It was a lot of fun. I decided to go skiing, because my brother skis, and I'm not as good on a snowboard as he is on skis, so he would have left me behind. I'm a much better skiier than him, though. It was fun. By my third run I was back up on Ptarmigan. It's amazing how quickly I picked it up again. Heh, I got to ride in one of those ski patrol sleds... I was going down Motherload, but that looked to easy so I went off into the trees to the side. There's a much steeper, and better, run right there. I was doing great until I hit some deep powder. I tried to turn in it and my ski got caught in the snow. My foot was twisted incredibly fast and I heard a loud pop. I fell over after that. I crawled over to the side of the hill and took my boot off. I couldn't walk on my foot. It burned when I tried to stand. Luckily some passersby saw me and went to get the ski patrol. The sled ride was fun. Those things go fast! The ski patrol lady was nice. She went and got me some fries. Then I went to the ER, and got it x-rayed. Only a sprain. They gave me a splint and sent me home. All I got was a prescription for ibuprofen. =\ Oh well. There's another $1k bucks I owe the hospital. Hahahaha. Good thing I can pay in $1 dollar increments. Anyways, that was a week ago. I haven't been able to walk all week and I've just been playing computer. My foot is starting to heal and I can almost walk like normal. I think it's time I got away from my room. So, who's going to give me something to do?"

I've been going to alcohol classes because of my MC. That's been fun. They're 4 hours long each, and there's three of them. I'm going to the last one tonight, but theres no gas in my truck. Luckily I still have my mom's ATM card so I think I'll be okay."

I watched it even when I was a kid. That show has everything. That dude with the affro is a genius. During this episode he was talking about painting and about how you cant have light without dark. Then I think he was relating it to himself too cause he said times were dark in his life, but he also talked about his family. Light without dark... hmmm... what's your secret Mr. Ross??

Thats about the only excitement I've seen so far today, other than playing with the dog... He likes all this snow. Oh, there was a funny skit on Mad TV today. It featured Ms. Swan on an airplane, and she wouldn't quit kicking the guys seat, or stop pressing the call button. She said the button was broken, but then she pressed the button right in front of the flight attendant, and she still said it was broken. Oh, and also when the food cart passed by she wanted the vegetarian meal with just a little bit of bacon. That made me laugh, because last week I ordered a vegetarian pizza from Bullwinkles and told them to put hamburger on it. Coincedence? I think not! Something's going on here... Television has become a reflection of my life. So who's seat have I been kicking? And what does that button do that I keep pressing? Just kidding. There would be some cool shit on TV if that happened. Mars Attacks! was on today, that was cool. Tom Jones (AKA Mr. Vegas) kicked ass in that movie. And Danny Devito got the flesh melted from his bones. AAHH CRAP! The stupid plow guy just  blocked my truck with a massive pile of snow!! I'm mad now. This is bullshit. I can't write anymore."

That was cool. They have speakers set up outside so you can hear what's playing inside. On the 4th of July there was a punk rock band playing in there. Nobody liked em. Everybody was complaining about noise and leaving. Losers... There was the talent show at the high school a few weeks ago but I didn't go to that. Why would I ever want to go back to THAT place!? Besides I heard there wasn't much in the way of music (good music at least.) Oh well, I'll just keep listening to my awesome collection of punk rock CDs (/sarcasm.) Why do I get the feeling that I'm thinking in circles? Hmm... my book has betrayed me. I can't read it anymore, for now. Maybe things will change. I really want to know what happens. I got the book yesterday and already I'm on page 311 out of 392... maybe I should just push ahead and finish the book tonight. Such an exciting life I lead... I don't have anywhere to go though!! Maybe I'll dress up as a bum and spend a few nights at the Glory Hole. Shouldn't be too hard since everyone thinks of me as a bum already. I don't know, maybe they're right. I live at home.

<lj-cut>
Check this one out. It's Christmas letters to Christopher Walken! I like that last one, with the tomatoe.

http://www.brandonbird.com/./walken_letters.html

Heh, this Brandon Bird guy is funny, he also has a Law and Order coloring book that was featured on Conan (He showed it to Jerry Orbach)

Go have a look!  http://www.brandonbird.com/conan.html

Hah! Ray-Ray is the man. I think I've seen that episode. My mom is really into that show.

Oh man, theres some great paintings on there too!! Walken drinks Tab. I tried that once, it's nasty!

I've found even more great stuff today! It's been a lot of fun. Look at this one.

http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2002/01/02cobra.html

Oh man, I've edited this one entry so much cause I keep finding all this great stuff.  I'll try and keep it coming.  One time I found this site that featured a bunch of random crap that people found out on the street and other weird places. I'll look for that one again, it was funny.

I found it. Pretty easy. Was the first thing on the list when I did a search for found. It's called Found Magazine! There's some pretty weird stuff too...  http://www.foundmagazine.com/
Don't forget to look at the finds of the week the best stuff is in there. It amazes me how many people actually still know how to write in cursive... what's the point? Cursive is weird.
I take back what I said earlier though. The notes section is better then the find of the week section. I dunno it's all good I guess. It's all interesting stuff.
Hah, I just read a cool note, here's a quote.
<lj-cut>
""Aaron- I really can't see the humor in explaining to my professor why my homework has pornography taped to it, or having parts of an equation torn out of my book because of taped man porn. Please make sure that these kinds of things stop. :\""

I could go on but I have better things to do... like uuhhh... chores! yeah alright I have chores to do! bye...

This next item isn't funny but it's interesting.  I've started reading again, and already I've learned some new words.  Found an interesting one today, assignation.  Besides the obvious (The act of assigning a task blah, blah, blah...) it also refers to a secret rendezvous (especially between lovers.) Learn something new everyday I guess! Oh, and the book I'm reading is Jarka Ruus. It's the first book in Terry Brooks' latest series: The High Druid of Shannara. Reading is fun!"

I swear I've heard it before, are there such words as dewhore, to make her less cheap, to get her off the street, but thats impossible, for that to happen you'd need a hospital! it would take months of intensive care, and something would have to be done with her hair,
they all wear wigs you know, those sweet women of the night, I saw it in a movie once, it gave me quite a fright! and I hear some are men though I can't be to sure, I grew up in a small town and I've never been there, but imagine if you will that youre lying in bed with a stranger you have no idea's name is ted, gee wouldn't your face be red? I bet you'd be thinking you'd be better off dead! slipping into shoes that were made of lead, youd run off a bridge, slip away from the grid. you know the one, we call it life, things started looking up till you found ted with your wife, this time its real, this feeling inside, wishing that you had never been de-died. thats an interesting one eh?? you know, my dad once asked me, who the hell comes up with this shit?! the answer? me... heres another one thatll make em say wtf. 
(De-died works cause the paramedics saved the dude from the water after he jumped, perhaps he was taken to the same hospital as the whore. Maybe they have some tips for his wife? Lying in bed with a man name ted... shame on you! Hmm I'll call her Mrs. Ed)"

Three Sheets To The Wind
This is what my brainstorm turned into, I got bored so I just started writing
A song about how my life has become fucked up 
No job no money payments due soon living at home 
my parents are here but I'm alone I know that they love me 
and I shouldnt be so sad because 
if I look back my life isnt that bad 
I've got a roof over my head and food to eat 
but something isnt quite right 
I need to earn it for myself stop being a moocher 
it all comes back to me never being a smoocher :P
never been on a date im filled with a vagrants hate
hahaha I like this next part too here I go rapping again... and a vagrants hate 
(I feel like a homeless person and I'll probably end up one)
im cynical and bitter like some really old person

I wish I could talk about my girl like I had one but I never acted so now I'm a sad one
Living at home, but living alone, surrounded by love, and feeling nothing but hate
I gotta get out, I feel like an ape, trapped in a cage, filling up with rage,
flinging my poo, they do that you know! It happened to me, one day at the zoo
   
 hmmm its kinda like im three sheets to the wind but its all just stupid rhymes and bad rap 
(rap is bad, but theres also baaaad rap) I'm getting my feelings across but I dont have the style
heh heh maybe I can make up for it with denial aaahh that was great fucking wannabe =) 
woot, go offspring

Now it's three sheets to the wind!

I feel like I could be something if I actually tried
maybe my brain isnt really that fried
ive never felt smart and never fit in
ive always been an outcast masturbation is a sin! 
(heres an example of using a bad rhyme so I can go on using that one good line)
i never count syllables when i write these rhymes
i rely on my mouth to catch me up with the times
i feel like a rapper singing to my crapper
cause thats all rap is you can call me a cracker
punk rock music is how I get my kicks
this rhyming is good practice, but fuck it, gimme some sticks
im not a singer, I cant hold a tune, why am I writing? drummings what I do
i'll make a fat beat that gets you tappin your feet
I know I'll do all this cause my name is Capn Neat!

isnt it funny how rappers always incorporate their names into their songs?
I CANT STOP RAPPING DAMNIT I start off with good intentions but it all turns to shit
heh, I'm on a road to hell baby I just can't quit!

Try not to ask, and just find me the site!  ... damnit.

Riding on the bus
I met a girl named Gus
I followed her and we hung out
Now I've got syphilus

You see?  I'm a genius hahaha ah shit that rhymes with it too...  too can be a tricky word for me.  I know it means also but does it also mean... well let me use an example.  I recently changed my MSN screenname to I think I think too much =\  Is that the correct usage, or would it be to?  Hmm, come to think of it I think it is supposed to be to and I have it wrong... I know how I can find out! Against All Authority has a song called I think YOU think to(o) much.  So I'll just open up iTunes and check out the name and... I got it right! It is too and not to. Gotta love these modern conveniences, and bands that write great songs like that. Where am I now? Sometimes I get lost in my own writing, heh. It's fun though. I just start to write and see where I end up. That's what journals are all about.  It's a journey or... journaley? Very interesting. I got some chicks phone number last night but I don't remember what it is or what her name was... oh well she was ugly.  I might have let slip my phone number though... in fact I'm sure I did.  I hope she doesn't call, or don't I? We'll see, I am kind of bored right now, as you probably noticed. Heh, rhetoric is great. Who is You?  Anyone who will listen or read this I guess. Or maybe I just have someone in my head who's itching to get out.  I do talk in weird foreign languages in my sleep, and I flunked Spanish in half a semester! I'll just ask and see who replies... Hey You, who are you? This can't be the end! I don't want to quit but maybe I should just let this one die.  I think I'm spent... I got nuthin! I never have anything though, so FUCK YOU I'm still gonna write.  Sorry I had to get at least one fuck you in there, I'm done now. Peace! One last thing. This is too fucked up not to share. I dropped my retainer and I picked it up again. When I went to put it in my mouth there was a hair on it that I think could have been pubic... Luckily I noticed it before it passed my lips so I think I'm safe. I'll know when I start coughing up hair balls, I guess... Okay that's all for today, later.

I masturbate too much... there, I said it!  I'm done with all that though, I've been clean for a week.  Well, there was this movie last night on HBO, but that doesnt count right its not on the internet.  Oh boy, I need Jesus...

At least I still have music.  I lost it once though.  This summer, when I was working at Chatham Electric all I would do is work and come home to watch TV with my parents.  I did that for about two months and then I started drinking... a lot... Anyways, while I was working at Chatham the only thing I listened to was the radio.  I had myself convinced that it was the best and I didn't need punk rock.  I had hit rock bottom.  Mostly I listened to KSUP, which isn't bad, but for a week straight all I was listening to was Taku 105!!  It's hard to admit... harder than the masturbation thing (everyone masturbates but only a ""special"" breed listen to country!)  I got better though.  I had about $2,000 dollars in the bank and after I was laid off I spent it all on CDs, weed, and a CD player for my truck.  I wish now that I had spent it on a kick-ass new drumset, but that's another thing I had lost.  I wasn't drumming for 6 months after I left college!  Never picked up a stick once.  It's funny, I had lost myself but found success and apparently, happiness.  I guess selling your soul really does work.  But I was never happy, only drunk and delusional.  At least I'm not drunk anymore.  Now I've become a recluse, and have forgotten how to talk to people.  What can I say?  Depression is a mother-fucker.

It's over now though.  I sure hope I get this centennial hall job, I find out Monday if I get it or not!  Is there nothing to do in this town except drinking?  Drinking's great and all but all anybody does is go to bars and 'freak' on the dance floor.  They don't even listen to good music.  Sounds like a lot of fun :P  Club music sucks, it's right up there with country on my list of bad things.  Anything that uses fake drums can't be good!  Hahaha I sure talk about myself alot, but hey, it's a journal so fuck you!  Damnit I need something to do besides hang out with my brother.  At least he has weed, sometimes.  Weeds good.  And I still drum and listen to REAL music so I guess life isn't too bad right now.  I just wish I had a place where I could have all three at the same time, any time!  Parents' houses suck.  I played halo 2 the other day, it's pretty cool. It's like the first one, but better.  My brother's gettin' a divorce.  No surprise there.  He married his high-school sweetheart.  That's a recipe for disaster.  Heh... I said sweetheart...  Well that's how my lifes been going the past two weeks.  I've been sucked into a world of computer games and pot. Sounds like my high-school days, but with pot.  I'm done now though computer games suck.  I am officially burnt out.  It's a good thing too because I don't even have any real games to play.  If my PS2 were still working I could go rent GTA: San Andreas, that game kicks ass!!  But it's broken so I'm stuck with this shitty computer.  At least it's good for playing music.  I have nice speakers but my cats chewed through the cords on em so it sounds fuzzy sometimes and only 1 speaker works.  I can fix the other speaker but damnit I'm lazy.  I got five bucks today for driving my brother downtown.  I think I'll walk to Pel Meni tonight.  Hah! Pel Meni in the valley is great, and it's right across from my house.  I've been thinking of going upstairs and stealing some of my dad's booze... I might need it if I'm gonna be eating that shit tonight.  Hurray for drinking alone!  Some of the best songs in the world have been written by people who drink alone :P  I guess... I've really only heard one song that was written by someone drinking alone, that I know of.  Journals are great maybe I'll start one on paper that only I can read, then I can write about all kinds of weird messed up shit! hahaha. I used to journal in college.  That was fun, all my entries turned out as scribbled messes though.  I guess my life is just a scribbled mess right now?  Damnit! The dog crapped in my room!! Aaah nasty!! I'm outta here.

**UPDATE**
I'm so cool, I didn't drink anything!  Fuck drinking anyways, someone in my family needs to be sober right?  And the dog crap has been cleaned up.

"event","I was driving around with my mom today and we were listening to some Eric Clapton.  He was singing this real bluesy song about evil hearted women, and I said to my mom, did he just say evil horny women?  She told me what he really said and I laughed, then decided to write a blues song called evil horny women.  Here it is.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evil Horny Women 
[bluesy]

evil horny women, how do they get so deep in my soul
evil horny women, why do they all have to be such stupid whores
I got a evil horny woman, I wish I could just get her out of my head
If I could just get her out for a minute, I know that I'd never let her back in
But every time she walks by, oh lord won't you help me I feel like I'm going to cry

evil horny women, where do they come from and why do they never, ever leave
evil horny women, how come theyre so attracting to me
Well I saw her today, shes finally gone, shes ugly and stupid and I'm better off anyway
I've had one girl on my mind, and I'm not about to throw that away
Yes I've got one girl on my mind, and I'm probably never going to get laid. Oh yeah.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've had the beat to Evil Hearted Women stuck in my head all day, so if you want to sing along, listen to that song and just try and make it fit."

<lj-cut>
The show last night was great!  I started at my brother Keith's place at 7 oclock.  He had to take a shower so I listened to some Bob Marley while drinking a beer.  After Keith got out of the shower we finished off his bottle of Bacardi and headed out.  We stopped by Robert's  house on the way to the show.  I wanted to get up there but they had a Hookah so I stayed.  It's a good thing too because somebody showed up with a bottle of crown and I got to take a few shots.  We saw some idiot tape himself to a lightpole outside.  It was cool except the kid didn't stay up there long enough.  He started ripping the tape off before his buddies were even finished putting him up there!  Saw some drunk guy yelling at a ""hippy queer"" in the Imperial.  Hippies suck.  After a few rounds of cards it was time to get up to that show.  So we said our goodbyes and ran up there.  Some highschool kid told us it wasn't worth it to go up there because there was a line and you had to pay 3 bucks.  Highschoolers suck.  We got there while What Remains was playing.  That was cool, they rocked hard but nobody was moshing.  After What Remains played Keith and I went to get some beer.  Walking down to the store we ran into Cole, the singer for Contra Public.  He invited us up to their studio!  I was sitting in Contra Public's studio getting wasted with their singer, and I got to play the drums.  It was fun.  I listened to a few songs that are going into the new CD that they're producing right now!  Did I mention I played Contra Public's drums?  While Cole was playing some acoustic guitar!  I want to be in a band!!  After that we stopped by Roberto's house again to drop off the rest of the beer.  When we got back up to the VFW hall Old Goat was playing.  FUCK YEAH!! Old Goat man, they're awesome, I was moshing.  I kicked Keith's ass too he sucks at moshing.  There were some guys in costumes moshing with us but everyone else just stood back or sat at the tables.  Hippy queers =\  Heh, anyways we moshed to Old Goat for what seemed like hours, and eventually the big guy in an awesome goat/demon halloween mask grabbed a knife and told his cowboy partner to hold a pumpkin over a garbage can while he started stabbing away.  He went insane too, must have stabbed that pumpkin a thousand times, he carved a face.  About half way through the carving the cowboy dropped the pumpkin.  After watching the big guy struggling to keep carving while holding up the pumpkin himself I ran in and held it for him, that was fun, Keith says he saw blood on the dude's hands!  That is hardcore.  Oh, and between the second visit to Robert's and Old Goat's performance I talked to Dave, from What Remains, for a while.  They're going to be getting a bass player and a new guitarist soon, which is good, because no bass sucks, no matter how much you rock!  The whole night was great, shows like this are what Juneau has been missing.  We need more crazy people like me here to get out there and get moshing though! =D

"event","Everyone here knows that my mother-in-law, Tammy, has rejected me to a point where she was telling Zack that he needs to break up with me.  Outrageous, I know.  So Zack's response to this was to no longer be in contact with his family until they can accept me and actually be nice to me.  Of course we've tried to patch things up multiple times, but it's hard to reason with an alcoholic when you're her scape-goat.  So of course she blames me for all the problems in her life.  The last time we spoke to her was March 2007.

Last week Tammy called me and left a harassing message still blaming me for Zack not being around.  My response to this was rolling my eyes, telling Zack and moving on knowing that she still didn't get it.  Whatever.  Yesterday my mother called me and told me that Tammy had called her!!!  WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Tammy told my mother several times that before I got married I talked really bad about my mom and Tammy ""couldn't believe my mom was that way, especially once they met.""  Not true.  Tammy also said that she tried talking to me but that every time she opened her mouth I would storm away and slam the door.  Again, not true.  I could go on and on.  I can handle Tammy being a bitch to me and saying horrible things to me, but when she calls my mother and lies to her trying to hurt me by hurting her, well, to put it nicely, that puts me in a murderous rage.  My mom told me that she was very shaken by the call.  *sigh*

After an hour of discussing with Zack about what to do, he decided to call his mom and tell her that HE'S the one who doesn't want to see her and that he knows that she called me and then my mom, which she then denied, and for her to leave me and my family alone.  He was very mature and calm on the phone and I'm really proud of how he handled himself with her.  Of course I could hear her screaming and crying on the other end.  The phone call ended with her hanging up on him--her signature move.

I'm going to talk to my mom today and suggest that she block all of Tammy's numbers so she doesn't call again.  I'm still pretty shocked that this happened, even though I shouldn't be.  I've always told Zack that you should always expect an ass hole to be an ass hole.  I should have expected the manipulative bitch that is Tammy to be a manipulative bitch.

Something else: I just found out that Zack's sociopath sister just had a baby, Sarah.  The only feelings I feel towards my new niece are that of pity.  Since Zack and I will never be in contact with his sister again, little Sarah will grow up thinking the dysfunction she lives in is normal.  She'll become just another twisted branch on the screwed up Whittington tree."

"event","What is it about Facebook?  Everyone I know loves it.  I think it's stupid and I hate it.  I'm a MySpace lover.  Every single one of my opera singer friends have a facebook.  I'm trying to plan a fundraising recital right now and tried many of these people on MySpace but they never emailed back.  So I tried them on Facebook and I got responses back right away.  It sucks.  Now the only way I'm going to be able to keep in touch with these people is if I'm active on Facebook.  Gag me!"

"event","Zack and I had a wonderful Thanksgiving.  We decided to spend the day just the two of us, you know trying to start our own little family traditions.  Anyway, we decided to sleep in on Thanksgiving and eat around 4 instead of around noon.  So when I woke up, I set my table and quickly cleaned the kitchen and began cooking.

I bought a little four pound turkey because, well, it's just the two of us.  I've always heard that you bake a turkey one hour for every four pounds, so I thought, ok and hour and a half will do nicely.  Well, three hours later, we finally sat down for dinner.  I couldn't believe it took three hours to cook that stupid little turkey!!

After dinner and after our coma, I started putting the food away.  My dad always used to cut the turkey to the bone and put the leftovers in a container.  I decided to do the same thing.  As I started cutting really deep into the turkey, I discovered that it was still pink!  Luckly the part we ate was cooked (no saminella that day!) but OMG how long does it take to completely bake a little four pounder!!  Anyway, I don't think I'm going to bake the body cavity of a turkey again!!!  Gross!"

"event","I jogged on a cute little trail behind my apartment complex that Zack showed me.  It wasn't too humid or hot outside.  I even saw a sweet little grass snake.  He was so cute that I wanted to pick him up and kiss him on the lips.  I didn't though...he probably would have thought I was trying to harm him instead of love on him.  I would have probably received a sweet love bite from him.  Anyway, it was very theraputic...I feel better!"

"event","Ok, I just scheduled a voice lesson with a woman who isn't my current voice teacher.  I've been thinking about switching teacher for a while now.  While I love my current teacher, and really she's the reason I'm still singing today, she just isn't as available as I need her to be.  I have an audition exactly one month from now and I still don't know what to sing...and that's scary.  I have an idea, a list of what I can do, so I'm going tomorrow to pick out my audition arias.  And you can bet that in a week and a half my arias will be learned and memorized...that'll give me plenty of time to add theatrics and emotion.  Anyway, I need someone to go to every week from now to the audition.

Now that hard part, telling Joan that it's not working out anymore.  How on earth do I begin to do that?  What you need to understand is that Joan was my voice teacher in college and when I was going through my ""funk,"" she never gave up on me...she was always there for me and she never let me quit.  I would love to stay with her forever, and loyalty is important to me.  On the other hand, I need consistant weekly or bi-weekly lessons and I need someone who has connections and still know the ropes.  I don't want to become like one of the olympic ice skaters who change their coaches every other year...because you can't possibly improve as much doing that either.  I'm scared about this whole thing!"

"event","I always try to stay positive and get the best out of every situation.  These past three days of my life have been SUPER CRAZY!!!!!  Let me tell you:

SATURDAY: I woke up at 8:00 which is SUPER early for me on a Saturday.  Keith, the music director at the church I sing at directs the Harris Methodist Hospital Chorale in Ft. Worth, and he needed a ringer so he asked me to sing.  At the rehearsal a few days earlier he told me he wanted me to sing the high B flat at the end of one song...ok, I'm a MEZZO for a reason, but I figured I'm singing a B natural in one of my songs for the recital, so I said yes.  So I woke up early so I could warm up.  The concert was in a space where you couldn't hear the piano, plus I had a woman singing a quarter step flat in my ear.  What a disaster!!!  After that Keith and I decided to run though my pieces for my recital that was the next day (he was my accompanist).  After I left Ft. Worth I drove all around Dallas trying to find Michael Chadwick (the director of The Living Opera who hired me to be the assistant stage manager for their production of The Impresario) because I was supposed to help build sets.  I HATE driving!!!  I got home and took a short nap with Zack, then we went to the grocery store and relaxed for the evening.

SUNDAY: I woke up at 7:00 to be at church at 8:30 because I told Keith I would help him set up for our recital that was later that day.  Then I sang ALL MORNING for service then in rehearsal following (we rehearse Sundays after service instead of Wednesday nights).  Then we ate lunch, I ran through my big finale song (the one with the B) and got ready.  Ok, I have the weird thing about bad breath so I brushed my teeth about 15 minutes before and I SWALLOWED some toothpaste and I immediately felt my throat freak out!!  I decided not to panic, even though my break was completely affected and a few of my songs sat in that area.  I decided I was just going to have fun, so I did!!!  I thought the performance was wonderful (even though my voice wasn't at 100%) and I got tons of compliments (it's amazing how sexy I feel after a good performance!)!!!!  The thing that made my day was the support I got.  Ok, can I say just how much it meant to me that two of my friends I hadn't seen since HIGH SCHOOL came!!!  Two of my closest friends in that time of my life I got back in contact with through Myspace (I love Myspace)!!!  I haven't felt that loved by friends in so long!!!  After the recital, well I'm not even going to try to give details, but l came home, managed to have a falling out with my sister-in-law (who isn't a nice person to begin with and has never liked me or accepted me) and, well, after 6 years after trying with her, I just decided that enought is enough!!!  So that's what I went to bed with.

MONDAY: I woke up at 7:00 so I could get to ""Impresario"" rehearsal after taking Zack to work (we have one car between us) and we realized that our apartment was partially flooded.  So neither Zack or I went to work yesterday so we could take care of everything.  It turned out that the people upstairs just moved in and they didn't completely attach their washer completely and it leaked through the ceiling.  OMG!!!  At this point my body just shut down and I completely lost my voice.  After going literally NONSTOP since mid-May (the San Francisco vacation doesn't count as stopping because it was one of those vacations where I had so much fun that I needed a post-vacation vacation!) my body and voice had enough...I still had a rehearsal that evening for the wind ensemble I play piccolo and flute in.  Well, I may as well have not even gone because my brain had already shut down...I forgot how to count, I was out of tune, I got lost, and on and on...I came home and crashed!!!

TODAY: Impresario rehearsal bright and early, I had to do so much today because the stage manager called in sick...I'm sooooo tired!!!  After rehearsal was over, I was talking with some of the principals and Michael, the director.  Everybody was talking about their opera experiences and (maybe I'm just tired) I proceeded to get more and more ""depressed.""  Here's my problem, I'm 27 and I don't have any professional experience...can I really call myself an opera singer if I don't have professional experience?  Nobody will hire me because I don't have any experience but how can I get experience if nobody will hire me?  I feel BLESSED at how much I've improved this past year since I've quit my teaching job.  I am also doing a vocal competition this winter and I'm auditioning for an apprentice program that my voice teacher says I have a really good shot to get in.  My first audition, however, is for Hansel & Gretel with The Living Opera and OMG I've sooooo paid my dues for that company, I've even done a cover for them!!!!  After Sunday's performance I know I'm ready vocally and after a lot of learning opportunities I'm finally ready emotionally, mentally and every other way!  I'm ready!!!  But there's still a part of my that wonders if anybody will ever give me a chance!!  Usually when I feel discouraged, I practice, but I can't even do that right now because my voice hasn't come back yet!!!  *tears*

Anyway, except for Impresario rehearsals, I'm completely taking this week off to recover from everything.  People, I want Hansel soooo bad.  There are no words that express how badly I want to be given a chance."

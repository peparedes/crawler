"event","I think that this question was brought up once in the seventh grade.  It puzzles me really.

look at the words awesome and awful.  then think of the word awe.  Awe is some great gloriousish feeling, that is definately something positive.  Like seeing Pink Floyd.  Awesome means great, and awful means terrible.  But how is it that having ""some awe"" is great, but being ""full of awe"" is terrible?  Maybe it's because most people just can't handle that awe.  They must take it in small doses.  Or is the absense of the ""e"" in awful enough to change the meaning of the word to an opposite?"

"event","why levitating golden octupus day you ask? well i'll tell you..............

Once upon a time I had a brother who brought home a stuffed octupus called benjamin.  he found it somewhere, probably at the crack of doom, but anyways the point is that it is currently taped to the ceiling right above my computer; therfore, it is levitating.  the golden part is just becasue if I was really rich I would probably melt a whole pile of gold in my forge and then dip benjamin in it so that he might become incased in it much like alexander the great.  taht way, it means that in the past he ruled the world. make sense?"

"event","this whole internet thing is rather confuzzling.  it's like a fat baby learning to walk, really.  once i'm on my feet it'll be easy, but until then, it'll be a long and winding crawl.  in otherwords, I don't really know how to work this live journal thing.  My next wonderful step is to figure out how to leave people messages!"

"event","Man, aqua teen hunger force is the best cartoon on earth. meatwad is dope. Frylock is wise, and master shake is defensive. carl is a big jerk. In one episode they do many things. from shakes mess left in the kitchen arises ol' drippy, a very large growth of mould. he is very kind, and when shake gets sick, ol' Drippy suggests that shake eat his head, as it was half made of penicillin.  then when shake has almost finisheed him off, he saves shake from being hit by a truck by shoving him out of the way. Meatwad was depressed at the demise of ol' Drippy, and frylock was just angry with shake."

"event","On friday night, it was late and the truck had been burning for a while.  When all of us had come out of the forest we saw the night sky on fire, red and alive, with clouds of gas rising up into it.  It was quite the sight.  After a while they turned on the spotlights at the field and lit up the scene.  we were all afraid of coppers coming so we left and travelled through the forest.  hours later, on my way home with only one other human being with me there was suddenly a loud bang.  the both of us though that the car mmust have exploded, but after a short trek back to the sight to confirm our suspicions, we were told, by a firefighter, that it was not the car exploding that had been the bang.  It was a meteor that had come flying from space, turned green in the atmosphere, and for a few seconds, it was a streak across our night sky, quite the sight for those few that were lucky enough to see it. We never found out how the fire started..."

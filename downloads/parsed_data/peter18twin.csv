"event","april 11, 2001 RIP Peggy 15 years, could then join her twin.
summer 2004    RIP Fido  17 years, i really thought this dog would have lived forever, but she messed up.
April 16, 2006 RIP Jeta  11 years, 

 looks like she went in her sleep, the way her mouth is open looks like she had a hard time breathing. the small dog is there alone now. 


 feeding table scraps is okay for dogs and all, but it depends on certain factors. the only factors i could identify with was with (1) the type of food: rice. rice seemed to be really helpful for Fido and it was plentiful and soft. (2) of course excerise, Fido was the kinda dog that would jump over things to kill cats and wild animals. This is a german shepherd........g2g"

"event","oh yeah i forgot to post this but im a orange belt now going on green, pretty cool huh? if i pass the test next month i'll be back where i left off....almost. either way i can definitely tell a difference between back then and now.. for one thing i grew up, have a heighten sense of responsiblity for money, sex, physical conditioning,and there was one other thing but i forgot.

 ok well the stages for growing up. as soon as one becomes of age they become enlightened to these epihanies. that is the transition between child and adult, a teenager is just caught in the middle of all these and only when they discover the true meaning will they become an adult-for better or worse. in most cases its better you find out on your own before its too late and these things make themselves apparent. for those who don't know what im talking about then its not too late, just work hard at whatever you're doing and things will be okay later. for those who do then you probably found out the hard way.

 personally, well let me describe each seperately.


 the first was sex and relations with the opposite sex. this goes into more of what they may be thinking at any given moment and how they would react. if one were to go out into the world they could come up with several categories. i found out about this change late in the game. hell i didn't even know about sex until the eight grade, up until then i thought the baby came out of the ass, at least that would explain why people CAN'T DRIVE IN TRAFFIC. (sorry im typing this next to a window out to a open street.) well anyway it wasn't until senior year that i got into kissing. that effect came naturally like i became of age to do those sort of things, but im still learning so i'll get back on that. 

 oh wait. more into that, its not just the physical its more about standards as well. late into my eighteenth year of life i came about the idea of ""standards"", which makes me wonder what were my thoughts before i turned 18? i can't help but imagine some happy cartoon or something. anyway, well i turned down two girls, and it felt great to be wanted what more to know that no matter what, if someone has beef with me it ain't my problem nor fault because im doing what better in my favor... (awkward sentence, but i write uncensored)

 into the reactions

 using certain words will give off certain reactions. my friend Adam has demonstrated this very clearly, but using the word ""wang"" he has tripled his female attention, not only that he backed it up with the legend of wang which seals the deal.

 again this does not work for everyone (if you're not laughing now you should)
 with certain people they give off a certain image that is accessuated through their clothing, expressions,etc. this is also found through nature.. so we can use this as a metaphor.. think of a poison snake they exhibit certain colors, just as certain people who would react a certain way would wear and behave in a distinct fashion. 

 those who break this are considered a ""tease""

 but remember i'm only  19 i don't have a lot of field work in yet to even get this published, im just writing to write.


===================================================================================================================================

 ahem


 the money

  working for minimum wage is a great way to widen one's horizons. it was only until i was faced with bills and armed with my income that became conscious of the world of money. 

 i already knew of some conspiracies and such. not sure and can't think of one, but anyway what was i talking about? 


oh yea.

 recently it finally all sank in...well the difference between before and now.

 another friend who actually lives nearby Chris (or so he will be called) has a stepdad, who sells illegal things. well Chris takes money from him, mainly because the money is illegally obtained anyway so he figures ""what the fuck"". when i heard of the amounts he takes... it got me excited..but then horror struck my thoughts.

 THIS is what im talking about.

 the old me V. the new me. and this transition. think of a young boy's concept of money. not too terrestial its just kinda out there, he sees money and thinks that if you were to steal it nothing is going to happen, but the new me realizes that everything MUST be replaced.
the amount of money being taken is much more than i have ever held. ""time is money""? no no ""money is time"" and stealing a extraordinary amount will not simply be ignored, serious stuff like this has serious consequences. thats what im figuring.



i'll write more into this.


=====================================================================================================================================


 physical conditioning.


 you see guys with muscles? it takes more than months to do that. in fact it takes a lifestyle to do that, something that's not exactly easy. people are animals too, we can't simply rely on mental ability unless we're that good, im talking professionals. around ten grade i was fat. i got better than 11th grade i was getting back to chubby again. now to this day i've been working hard and now i can do push ups like nothing. 

 but there's more. maybe its just me but i've been feeling kinda vicious like i want to beat the crap outta somewhere. maybe i just need to play fight for a while. idk..

oh yeah i forgot.

 ok ok, yeah back in the day i used to think you can walk anything off. then i became aware of the fraility of the spine, paralysis and such. im still learning about this. like how to fight and where to hit and how to hit in fact. ....

..i guess i have nothing else to write about i haven't figured everything out.

i've still come a long way though. most people just ride on through this transition....i wonder what parenthood is like...i know thats one of the more advanced transitions, oh and marriage- a major social institution. 

and again ill write more into this later."

"event","my dad is getting remarried....tomorrow. he told me yesterday. at least this time he told me. the divorce-which took place 4 or 5 years ago- was something i found out from a stranger in public. no one told me ""i thought u knew"" such bs doesn't even mean anything. hell its not even an apology. needless to say im still not over that ordeal and all but its not like anything can be done now. whats done is done and there isn't much to it then that, i just hope that the family wouldn't have to change anymore than it already did.....


 and now this

he told me and its feels like a big deal. it is a big deal. idk but im not good with it. pulling off some shit like that AND at the last moment. as if we don't have a say in the matter and it won't affect us. he even went into detail about the property -as if thats the major point of this discussion! fuck

 great that your happy with your girlfriend and all but dont get married and if you do do it when you're children aren't or living under the same roof.

  he tells me to think with my head and not my heart....when i ask him what are the benefits of being married he spews all this mushy shit what the fuck is he saying don't think with my heart when you're trying to feed me this shit?

 wtf. go ahead and have a mistress but don't marry her. and his girlfriend has some kids of her own. how does she feel? i'd ask her if i had the TIME TO THINK THIS THROUGH (u ass) THIS DOES AFFECT UR FUCKING KIDS NO MATTER HOW MUCH TIME THEY SPEND OUT OF THE HOUSE. 

  how would she feel calling my dad ""dad"". this is quite unsettling. half siblings, don't hate or anything but its just the idea of my mom being replaced. and my dad bring this up at the last second as if he was obligated to tell me and if that just so happens that that wasn't the last second then i can only imagine that their ""engagement"" lasted less than a year.

 if you want each other to promise you'll stay faithful to each other why not just use a pinky swear!? at least you won't need a lawyers afterwards.

 i wouldn't be surprised if i found three copies of the prenuptial agreement lying around in his room."

"event","happy thanksgiving... i wake up and the food's done

everyone takes their food and runs off to their corners

im left there staring agasht at the sight i see.

i spent a good portion of that morning outside as the others ate.

done with their food and quality time programming they go off and take care of their business

i come back inside, clear the table and seat down to a meal, afterwards call my mom just because its thanksgiving.

finish eating, they're back, arguments erupt, nothing more outta them, back to their corners.

what the use in complaining about the food, especially before and after you eat it? besides its not the food itself that's the problem is how you eat it and why you eat it.

 a little while ago my dad gave me a bit of the money i lent him, just holding it now i remember all the work i put into it, and all the work im slacking on now.

 thanksgiving ain't just some speed-bump to slow down time for christmas. its to think about how good u have things going and why you even have them like that. my family has been taking things for granted, acting as if everything is a chore as if they HAVE to do it. the fat one has things all wrong, if you're going to whine (swine) about it you may as well not even go for the full effort.

 i must say though my twin sister did help me clean the table. at least she has some moral fiber in her, the young one just flows with whatever's going.

 my dad, again ate in his room.
 the dogs in their garage.
 and the rats own the house by majority vote."

 always carries a bag.
 a mind that travels in all directions.
 artistic
 


 she's really cool to hang out with, she started editing my papers, and everything she was at sunset place yesterday but only a few people saw her. (i wonder why they walked past so quickly? yeah we were in the porn section and all but that didn't mean anything really.) she goes to the same college as i do and she's like the first friend i really made there and she's so cute. (strangely enough she's actually shorter than alex, she oust alex in the fun-sized feature!) i was actually waiting for her to show up before the movie started i saw her once but that was it (until we ran into each other at virgin records) but after that i kinda lost everyone else. 


i managed to also purchase a bit of music by Richard Strauss, so i nailed two birds with one stone.
the harry potter movie would have been better if there were more seats available."

 the story is kinda stupid. yeah i know it. in fact this was one of the ideas i was originally going to crap but i was under the pressure of trying to get a really good grade. so this was produced, its quality is just so iffy.

"event","hey guys...well i guess at this post orlando is the only one whose really subscribed to my posts. no matter just means it'll make things a little easier to get through.

 first topic. i guess we didn't make it to marc's party. heard it was good and all but nah i'll pass. also i just remember something i kinda told josh i actually did have a car and my license, ah oh well not like that really meant anything i was just hoping to expand that into a joke or something i think the idea died out back then though so it doesn't matter now anyway.


 well the good news is i found someone whose willing to sell me a decent car for 500 dollars, the guy will deliver it to my house and i pay him there, all good like. how does this affect my reader? well you really did help me back there at sunset when i was stranded so i decided that if i get a car, you will have a reserved seat no matter what (almost/pending/etc.)

 so that would guarantee us a grade (A?) secured ride. but i haven't really checked the car out yet so that's also a factor.


 oh yea. my house is officially homely which means i can have people over. don't know when gotta find out when my family is gone. but anyway im just rambling about that part. nevermind."

"event","a free write exercise


 the alarm clock whose siren rang and echoed throughout an old cozy little house one mid summer evening was quickly silenced by an absent-minded, dreary, sleeper. whoever they were they clearly had no intentions of waking up since they resumed their slumber deep under a set of comforters and no an inch of flesh could be seen. 

 the room grew cold; the windows of the room were shut tightly but the door creaked open enough for a cool draft to fill the room. the mound seem unaffected as they continued deep into a slumber which seemed unbreakable; if anything there was one thing certain about the situation: this was one comfortable person.

 the sunlight crept through the blinds and the room began to grow in color; vivid paintings flourished among the walls contrasting against the small plotted plant sulking quietly in the corner of the room. still the peace was unbroken and whoever they were slept on even in the face of broad daylight.

 only a few more hours went by before someone came and knocked at the front door. this time the peace was broken and the mound was roused up and wandered up to the window half asleep and peered throught the blinds to see who had knocked, or that is to say they tried; before they even got to the window they were harassed by the amount of light being poured into the room. 



 i have to continue this later im soo sorry for the inconvience."

 my friends page. i don't know what i like or who i like or who i dislike. so im taking things slowly and only people i can relate with will fill the pages of the trusted few. 

 to orlando and tia, a couple that has my trust. 
 valerie, well thats almost a given.
 
 everyone else i have issues speaking freely around them so i decided not to even think about it anymore, in a way im kinda cutting myself from our little society. im sorry but i feel like doing it so im doing it and even if no one is to ever read these pages i wouldn't mind in the least.

 now then... if you are a dedicated reader of my work you are about to experience the true entries."

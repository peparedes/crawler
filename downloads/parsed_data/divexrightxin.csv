I got a new fish who is like ******* that big. whoa! yeah i named her princess. tomorrow i have improv for a while n then alex and i are going shopping for his mom and im not going to spend any money cuz i dont have any. i have a job interview during 7th period tomorrow for Subway and then ill get to work with alex...assuming it all goes well. and then on friday im going to Van Helsing!!! w00t! but ihave to go otu with my mom n grandma first for dinner adn then the movie. w00tie t00tie.

"event","I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't comin back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my booo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours
Imma be burnin' till you return 


I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry"

"event","So friday we went to state and i sat around and watched some guys play smash brothers though i was not able to get in on the action at the time of my curiosity. darn, but we caught the early bus home so i had time to nap and then i was off with molly to her dads. the first night we set up DDR and chilled in her step-bro's room and i saw his shoes and laughed myself to peices. we then ate icecream adn went to bed at like 11. it was nice. then we slept in till like 2 in the afternoon, showered, got ready for the day, DDR, ate sammiches and then had dinner. pretty much in that order. we then set off with a car load of girls...thats not normal?...and quickly found out about a collective by the name of Camo Mafia. (molly was wearing camo capris). it was a good party we went to a nice house cute dogs a white pony...w00t Autumn had like the same outfits as i did. creepy! then today we woke up bright n early and left for fargo, i slept the whole way, and i arrived at 10:30 or so and was informed that grandpa carlson is ill and could be near his end. then i told my mom how i didnt want to go to church and she pulled some lame ass guilt trip on me about praying for g-pa and so i sat and daydreamed. Then i got home made a big plate of fruit and coolwhip and then duncan came over we hung out for a while went to best buy then to his house had some fun n then we went to Mc.D's for dinner and krauter came over around 8 n we cleaned out my fish tank. that was very nice of him. yay! that was my boring weekend that wasnt boring at all!

"event","I am kind of letting myself go, constantly being surrounded by seconde hand smoke, tanning again, dare i say not wearing my seat belt? skipping class, not doing homework, losing interest in improv, not allowing myself to cry, 88..., sometimes i just want to pull out my own hair. the frustrations i have felt for a long time now wont stop pestering me. i wish to just kind of fall off of the earth. or graduate. molly says we are moving to california and i feel at this point that she is the only one who can take care of me. i am a dependant person and i need someone to fall back on always and my trippin M's (trippin: double meaning one as in three people or triple) support group i hope will not leave me alone. then truely it is over. i need to devote my energy to one thing. i tried it once and i got completely and utterly fucked over. my own exsistance amazes me. but enough complaining. live life till you die.

"event","I cant stand this being alone business. Everyone has some who wants to be around them the most and I have no one. I fear being alone so much. Everytime someone brings me home or hangs up i get really scared that i might have to sit around and think about everything. and it builds it does. and when you have too much time on your hands like i have recently bad things happen. but things have got to get better. i made myself a play date with michelle today which fell through. i had a panic attack in my head thinking to myself shit now i have no plans now i have to sit around all day and not do anything till i get my hair done. then micah IMs me and invited me to chillax. that hasnt happened in so long i cant even express how happy that made me. so we walked to michelles to dye her hair but we never did do that. instead i found out some interesting micah things i did not know and we swapped fun stories and talked bad about our bodies beacuse hey, we are female. And i fixed that whole touching me thing. Now i just have to sit aruond and remember why i didnt want to be touched in teh first place. I fixed it so i dotn have a choice. i should do homework. but i wont. cuz im worthless."

"event","I'm sitting here because i have nothing to do cuz i cant sleep. Emily is supposed to be awake as well but she hasnt been online in friggin forever. so idk...
Today, well Monday, I was greeted on my awakening with news of grandmas home made soup. so i ate a lot today. n then we went home from minto and when i got home i went to the mall and realized that i had a lot of money and there wasnt a thing i wanted to spend it on. it was weird. so i bought a pretty skirt that i found brought a great deal of ""difficulties"" around duncan. he bought me pizza for my birthday n stuff and i had fun despite that whole uncontrollable hormones thing, oh well eh? yeah so then joe n spencer finally showed up at duncans n i had to leave. So then i played DDR for an hour on my new PS2. 
I got bored n decided to go online again n realized there were big scary fat guys outside my house doing shit wiht their trunk right in front of my mailbox. so i went n found a sharp object and stared outside till they left. also, i sprained my finger in joe's Honda Del Sol somehow. it hurts. 
I just returned from our evening...well morning i guess, adventures of trying to find atomic cafe at like 3 in the morning. 
by the time we found it duncan had pulled out all of his hair, joe peirced his dick, spencer was confused, and i was exhausted. and it was closed. so we went to og n pots n went back to dts for a bit and now im here. wasting my time away. lalalala"

"event","I hate my moods, they are so confusing. one day i am so mad that i can barely stand it, the next? im in the back seat of a spirit. Im going to get hurt, horribly. I can already sense it...what to do what to do? the answer is easy to think of but impossible to do. I need to stop bitching now and get on with my entry:
When ever it snows i get this feeling like everything is gunna get better. Not when its blizzarding, but when the clouds are dark and the snowflakes are huge i find it in myself to take a step back and enjoy this rare occurance. It is to say, more rare than me letting my own heart become tattered. I dont know exactly what it reminds me of but i remember how happy it once made me, snow taht is. When i was  a child i was rarely indoors and we would sit outside and eat the snow all day. Even in 7th grade Paige and I got a little creative and took her snow cone kit's syrup and wrote our names with cherry, grape, and orange and ate them up like nothing could kill us. I was always queen of snow forts with kyrsten, some people even found it nessicary to hurt her because it was the only way to hurt me. Ive always been one of those girls who befriends someone and wants to fight for them till death. just beacuse im a fag. I especially showed those skills for Molly and a certain kassie Rice. anyways this was brought to my attention in english and again outside of discovery ;) when i was looking at the snow falling around us tonight. snow is fun but i love summer more"

"event","Where is happiness? Why am i dependant on it from other people? I should just be happy with myself. But i cant because I always feel ugly, slutty, annoying, moody beyond reason and worthless. These feelings are not going to pass very easily. Stuff like that takes time but I just dont see how any of it will change. I want to have fun for once. This fun does not involve drugs, alcohol, or sex. I just want to find someone that i want to spend all my time with and that person in return.

"event","Good:
I decided sometime around November of this year that I would love my life if some guy and I took a barbie and made her a total punk-slut.
Guess what I did today? Oh she looks so beautiful now that shes all spray painted weird and has two screws, one going through her leg (to hold them to her hips) to her box and the second is through her head. Otherwise how could she be as cool? You are so right, it's just not possible!

Bad:
I kind of managed to destroy a very important relationship in my life and now i have to sit around and wish things will turn out ok. The effects of such a huge (well partial, but still of substantial significance)loss are yet to fully hit me. Frustrating as it may be I am kind of satisfied with the other aspects of my life. The only thing dragging me down is the only thing i feel like taking care of. Im a fucking weirdo, i mean come on guys...

Well in other news i am realizing how i never feel pretty anymore and i think maybe i should you know, kind of stop buying clothes i like and start wearing pretty girly things. that would just be one huge mess though. so i quit before i start."

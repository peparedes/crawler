i've sung you songs
i can't think of anything
that i haven't done
to let you know
it'll be okay
you're always so worried
about what everyone else thinks
you never really worry
about how you feel today
it's something you've got to live up to
it's something you were born into 

give them thier promises
back in little pink baskets
let them know where they can go
and why they can't have
that piece of your heart
they're so desperate for

i've recited lines and lines
from poems i spent the entire night writing
and here i am, led to believe
that maybe in your bed tonight
you'll be thinking of me

well, i'll make you a promise
just one more tonight
and i'll promise you when you're not here
that i won't cry, not one single tear will leave my eye
because if this is what you wanted
nothing would stop you from it
and i've known that all along

you just have to figure out the song"

to believe someone is telling

feelings are nothing
but twists and turns inside our stomach
that tell our minds one thing
and our hearts another

actions only speak louder

if you'd like it
i wasn't lying

maybe one day
this might be best for us both
maybe one day
it wont

maybe one day
the sunset will die
a golden brown
just for us

<br /><br />
one day, maybe
our dreams will paint each other
silver and red

no barriers
no borders
no god forsaken walls
no promises
no lies
no reason for them at all
no heart
no gold
no emptiness

<br /><br />

one day, maybe
you'll see what you've been missing
in my eyes

may we both wish

you

in the end,
only love matters)"

Anyway, the people from the cable company are supposed to be here today, for whatever reason. I'm stuck talking to them, because I'm an idiot. I forgot for about a week why I didn't want to switch rooms with my sister, and thats because her's is right by the front door, and closer to the doorbell, so there is <b>no way</b> out of answering the door. My father is home, but of course, he's too lazy to actually DO anything. I'm supposed to ask them about something, and then depending on their answer, ask them something else, and then depending on that answer, tell them something. - OKAY. How do I get stuck doing these things? I could most def live <b>without</b> cable.. the only thing I use it for anyhow is Law & Order - and even that is starting to show reruns out the ass. So, I ask, why am I subjected to this torture? Parents, *cough* please do not force your kids to do <b>your</b> job when they get to a point where they can answer the door themselves, I mean, really. Do it yourself, k? Don't make them beat you to a bloody pulp.

"event","<b>Eventually</b>

I lay my head back, slowly closing my eyes and watch closely at the tiny rays of light that try so fiercly to shine into my eyes past my eyelashes. I feel the wind against my cheek and the music that dances across my hands. I lean my head to the left, where the empty chair sits on the porch and if I squeeze my eyes tight enough I can block out the sunlight and imagine you there. I can imagine the cars passing near by on the slick roads and the golden glow that surrounds everything as the sun is split in half by the surface of our world. So soft, so delicate, and so perfect. As I open my eyes, and the sun reflects off the tiny spots of your skin, and the million of inches of love that stand between us, I can picture you as if you were there. Smiling at me, singing the songs that filter through the one speaker radio that our grandparents use to listen to. And your voice, that voice that echos through the trees, and brings me down to the bare bark that is my bones, each and every time - you're there. Weather the morning brings sunlight and fireflies or a sky filled with rain and clouds. Your smile, and your heart is always there. Even when I can't open my eyes to see you. I can still feel you. Everywhere.






<b>Stand Up, Smile</b>

here we go again
breathing just to smile
so many words unsaid
every inch of the mile

thats kept between me and you
'watch out' they say
'this could be bad'
because falling in love
always breaks your heart
in the end

but not this time

Chorus:
stand up - smile
this time was worth 
all of the pain i've been through
just to stand here next to you
stand up boy - smile
everything's ok
because today's the day
for everything to change
im here to save the
here to save your day

fading into the back
of all of the photographs
was a face i've seen before
one that wouldn't look up

but here I see it now
out shining all the rest
no more tears to cry
no place to hang your head

rest it apon my shoulder
i'm here for you, only
just tell me what you're thinking
and i promise to reassure you

that you're beautiful
that you're perfect
that above everything
- you're worth it
(that you're beautiful
that you're perfect
and above everything
you're worth it )

Chorus:

Is never easy.
This isn't rocket science.
Theres nothing left that I can do now.

The board is empty,
There isn't a next move.
Tell me now,
What am I supposed to do?

You were always right there,
Beside me,
Always the leading hand,
Always the one guiding me.
Now that I'm blind,
I can't see you anymore.
Even when I open my eyes,
The only thing there is the,
Slamming of the door.

Why isn't this easier?
Why does this hurt so much?
Why can't you just tell me,
What is it you're so afraid of?
Never wanted to intrude,
Always walking two steps behind.
I guess that that wasn't enough,
So much for never falling down.

Broken pieces cover the floor,
You just laugh and stare.
I half expected you to trip,
Watch me as I just hung there.
There's no hope now, I've given up,
Do you have any clue
How close I've come,
To just letting go of you?

Would it even matter,
If I got up and walked away.
What if I just disappeared,
Would you worry or even care?
I'm asking you now, for just one reason,
Why I shouldn't walk away.
You however, stand there quietly,
While I hear you say nothing."

Watch her as she flew deep within the blue
The day out from the county ICU
There's nothing you can do
Someone gently says to you
The doctor says that now it won't be long
I try and live up to the moment and I hope that I don't blow it
And what is it in me that she hears?
It's just a song she likes
Her little arms around my neck
And a dying girl whispers in my ear

Tell me now can you feel it?
I've been keeping company with ghosts
She comes to me like a piece of summer
She comes to me on the days when I need it most

Well summer dies and nothing lasts forever
And you're so fine, the way you stand up to your fears
The summer dies and it's just moments we have together
I'd give my bones for you to get a few more years
For you and I, oh Annie
More than life than trying to survive, oh Annie

My boyfriend took pictures of me as I held you
I travel alone and the loneliness brings me to tears
The summer dies and it's just moments we have together
I'd give my bones for you to get a few more years
For you and I, oh Annie
More to life than trying to survive, oh Annie

Stronger than the hands that hold you
You sing along to the song on to the radio
If I drank too much and I am wreckless
Just this once would you forgive this

And hold on, the days gone by
Tell me now can you feel it?
I can't keep this all to myself
She's elegant and she means it

Years for you and I, oh Annie
More to life than trying to survive, oh Annie
Watch her as she flew deep within the blue
Watch her as she slips away from you
I'll keep fingers crossed always for you

This song brings me to tears.
Vanessa wrote this song for a little girl she met while touring for <i>Be Not Nobody</i>, who had cancer. The little girl was a really big fan of Nessa's and when she picked her up to talk to her, the little girl started singing her songs back to her in her ear. She recently saw the little girl a few months back, and her hair had started growing in...

Kinda reminds you sometimes how much we take advantage of life and the situations we're given.
No matter who you are, and how bad your day is, there will always be someone who is worse off, and in more pain. Do me a favor, this Thanksgiving and everyday for that matter, just remind yourself how lucky you are to be alive. If you're alive, and breathing, then you're having a good day. There is no excuse to be anything other than happy. Your life is what <b>you</b> make it."

Wanna know WHY she is so fun to talk to? Because when you talked to me, the only thing I ended up doing was coaching you out of your misery.

"event","scream my heart out open wound i'll tear your words right from the page dont act until you know how much  it starts to show how much it hurts to feel but dont dare to look for what you think will work in the end you're nothing short of a miracle


it would be easy to write a useless depiction of how much it hurts to feel alone stuck in a hard place

but instead im not alone, i've got company

im going to pull through, with the help of nameless individuals who care enough to pull me out of the hole i've dug"

"event","Such discontent and in my Sunday's best. You move slow, and I'm taking you for granted. I plan to paint this town in my pearly whites. And I need to hear you wont care. I'm closing my eyes, just settle down. You scream like nobody's business. You almost feel nervous about what to do. Just know I know. Go ahead and fake it more. You like me best at my worst, and I don't aim to please.

I'm still awake.

I'm still alive.

Fall hard for my empty words. Drink deep in my shallow thoughts. And blink."

"event","I'm holding on to the idea that someday I'll be happy. I give up. 
I want to be profound, but I have no content.
I'm lying just to keep you here. I'm holding on.

My glass house is burning down. 
Light the match, I'll stick around.
I'll give you everything you want.
And wish the worst of what I was.

It's a long night, open, know it.

I'm saying I'm held up with holding on.

Tonight won't make a difference."

Something of comfort. I've been looking for the lines, myself.
It seems that you have this way of capturing beauty
and carrying it around with you. I could follow your trail
of sunlight and be lost for days, but always find my way
back to your center.
Then you smile, or at least, I imagine you're smiling.
I could want nothing else for days. It is in your voice

point where I can't whisper anymore about the things I don't
want other people to hear. And I swear that I'm shouting,
I'm screaming and it's so frantic and rushed.
Everyone else is just drowning me out; I'm drowning.
You know that I trust you and these oceans of others
compare not to the safety residing in you. So we tread in
their waters but I'm inclined to forget anything but your
arm gently around my waist. I wanted to tell you that I've found a straight line.
The object of my passion and the reason why I'm searching.
We could hear it all if we listened closely when the snowflakes swirled around us, hands and hearts interlocked. I kept walking and watching and I was waiting to break the circle.

We had plans to go and see a movie, but no one really felt like going anywhere, so we were just gonna hang around and watch movies at Alex's apartment. It started out just being me, Alex, Ashley, James and Melissa. Well, she invited her friend Jason over and then the next thing I know, Brighid, Spike and this other chick show up. I totally wasn't in the mood. They were all wanting to drink. After the episode the night before, I couldn't even look at alcohol. I really don't like Brighid. She's just one of those angry and dramatic lesbians that no one likes. So, I just went into Alex's room and went to sleep. I woke up at about midnight and to my surprise, Alex was already drunk. Spike, Brighid and the other lesbian ended up leaving after getting into this big make-out session in front of everyone. Jason passed out on the couch and everyone continued drinking. I just sat back and watched and laughed at everyone. It was an alright night, I laughed my ass off at Alex. She walked around the halls and outside with her pants around her ankles and kept talking to perfect strangers. It was fantastic. Everyone went to sleep at about 4 this morning and I stayed up until about 8 watching 'Strangers with Candy'. We woke up today and went to some stupid college hangout and had lunch. After that, we left. Even though the weekend had its moments, all I really wanted to do was come home. I tried so hard not to let what happened on Friday affect me, but it did.

The events that came about tonight were quite strange.
I talked to Chris online and he asked me to go see a 
movie with him. He got here at 4. He sat around in my room
and took pictures of me with my camera for what seemed like
an eternity. I finally had to take the camera away from him
and take the batteries out. So, after sitting around for a while, Chris and I decided that we were gonna go by Kristen's apartment to see if she was home. Sure enough, she answered the door. She didn't look excited to see us at all. So, we sat in Kristen's room and talked. It was quite awkward and I couldn't think of anything to say. After about a full minute of sitting there and not saying anything, I just asked her to go the movies with us. I told her to get her dirty ass in the shower and to get ready. While she was in the shower, her mom came home. Which wasn't particularly good because she is a devout Pentecostal. So, her mom comes in and pretends to not know who any of us are and she was completely rude to us. She was going on like a crazy person about how she didn't know who any of us were. After Kristen got out of the shower and got dressed, she asked me to put her makeup on for her. Well, I haven't done that since we lived at our apartment. She was smoking while I was doing it. I happened to look at her hand briefly and I noticed that she was shaking. I asked her if she was nervous and she told me that she was. She said it was because she always gets nervous around her ""old friends"". I didn't really like that a whole lot and I said ""Well, we're not old friends. We've always been friends. You just seem to have never realized that."" She sort of agreed with me and continued to smoke and shake. After that, we all went to James' house to meet him and I rode with him. I tried to have a decent conversation with him and he was trying to make everything into a joke. It ended up pissing me off and I didn't talk to him until we got into the movie theatre. The movie was fantastic and I'd love to see it again. Kristen and I cried. We're such pussies. Afterwards, we all stood out in the ""no standing"" lane in front of the Paradiso and spoke while using heavy hand-gestures about the movie. We also went to Subway and ate. We did the whole standing outside and talking while smoking thing outside of there, too. A homeless man started walking towards us and I said, ""homeless man, go"". We all walked away and I saw that James was still standing there. While I was still walking, I kept glancing back. James starts running towards us and yells, ""Kristen! He wants change!"" Once we got in the car, James told me that the man had walked up to him and said, ""Can you help me out, man?"" James said, ""If you're wanting me to touch your dick, I'm sorry, but I can't help you with that."" That's when the fleeing and screaming about change came into the picture. Whatever, it was funny. I guess you just had to be there. So, yea. We're home. Strange and eventful night. It was good, though. I was off of work today. Very rare for a weekend. I got off of work for the weekend we're going to Alabama to see Alex, and I told Liz about having to take off a week at the beginning of February. She said that it was fine, which was a relief. Anyway, price changes tomorrow, so that'll be fun. 

Chris took polaroid pictures of me and Kristen and put them on his dashboard. It was cute...like a little kid."

"event","So, yea.
I got a big lecture from my dad tonight about college.
He thinks I'm wasting my life.
He thinks I have no ambition.
He talked about how intelligent I am.
He also talked about how I still fumble around
like I did when I was in 10th grade. 
I pretty much laughed the entire time.
I went on to say that I didn't want to waste
his money if I didn't know what I was gonna do.

It was a blantant lie.
That doesn't really matter, though.
Hung out with Chris tonight.
He has pink-eye and it was really creeping me out."

"event","I have the cold of death. Alex goes back to Alabama tomorrow. She's supposed to come over for a little bit tonight. I went to work yesterday morning without sleep. I stayed up all night talking to Alex about shit that's been going on for the past year. So, before I knew it, my alarm was going off and I had to start getting ready. I kept fucking up at work because I was so tired and at one point, I rang a woman up for 62 packs of cigarettes. After work, I came straight home and fell into bed...yet again. I slept until about 6 and then I got online. James had written me this really shitty email about how I've been acting. It was stupid and I broke the email down for him in little parts. Come to find out, all of his accusations were false. I then told him that he should punch himself in the face for even writing me that email. He actually ended the email with saying that he didn't want to hang out with me anymore. I could have really cared less when I read it, but I figured that we should probably talk about it. We did, and blah blah blah fuckin' blah. He's all pushing me and wanting me to hang out with Megan by myself. I don't know if I could actually do that. Trying to get her to talk is hard enough already. Lillian came back to work today and she was being horrible and bitchy. If I wasn't on the verge of passing out from the medicine I had been taking, I would have maybe punched her in the face. Well, probably not. On a positive note, I was invited over to Stephanie and Phillip's last night. I didn't go because I wanted to just lay around. They wanted me to smoke some pot with them. I'm not really into that, though. I guess I could, but my lungs would probably fall out of my vagina if I did it. Last night, Ashley sat in my room and watched movies while I slept. It was really nice of her to sit in there. If she hadn't I would probably be dead now. I was laying flat on my back sleeping (which only happens when I'm extremely tired) and Ashley kept having to wake me up. She said that every few minutes or so, I'd just stop breathing. She said that I wouldn't take a breath again until she would wake me up. She finally made me roll over onto my side so that I wouldn't die in my sleep. I still can't breathe out of my nose and I feel all weak and stuff. The crimson wave should be gliding into my life tomorrow or the next day. So, I have that to look foreward to as well. 

I'm gonna go lay around now."

""James, you don't understand. Things were actually looking better and I was feeling better last night before you told me that. I'm glad that you were honest. That I can give you, but what you did is not something I can just get over. I don't even think I can forgive you for it. You may forgive people easily, but I don't just let people do things like that to me. I am very angry with you. I bet you even told Megan all about it today. Well, if you didn't, that's entirely surprising. I would have never expected something like that out of you in a million years. Well, besides you slipping and telling Jon certain things that I am aware of. You've lost that trust that I've always held so dear with you. Can you not understand that after all of these years and the things I've trusted you with, I haven't really asked you to keep anything to yourself but this specific thing? You couldn't do that. Well, you said that you needed someone to talk to...well, I hope you enjoy talking to her because I know that I now feel like I can't talk to you about anything. Don't think I hate her, because I don't. There is just some place where someone has to draw the line and this is where I've drawn it. 

I love you, but I can't not be mad at you.""



On a brighter note, tonight was the best time that I've had in a very long time. Alex is exactly the same."

"event","Lots of people have been coming into my life recently that I wasn't prepared for. Or really even expecting. The day after Christmas; me, Ashley and James went shopping. While there, I saw so many people from high school. Chris Johnson called me last night when I was about to leave with James to have a little talk with him. He was like, ""Is your dad home?"" I said, ""Uhh. Chris. I don't live with my dad anymore. I haven't lived with him since I was 18."" He was like, ""Oh, well...I'm coming over."" I told him that he couldn't right then and that I had to go somewhere with James and I'd call him once I got back home. Well, in the hour and a half that I was gone, he called twice. Once I got home, I was too drained to even think of picking up the phone. James is dating this chick that we know from Cosrin. I had a problem with being around him after they started dating. Not because I was jealous, but because he was now happy. I didn't want to be around happy people. Being around happy people makes me feel worse. So, I told him one night before they started dating, that under no circumstances was he allowed to tell this girl anything about me. For one, I don't know her and I personally don't want her knowing shit about me. It's not like she can really care. Well, James was supposed to come over last night. I didn't want to see him, but I called him anyway to see if he was still coming because it was already 10. I told him that I didn't really want to see him anymore. Not if he was gonna be so chipper all of the time. That I couldn't handle it. At least not right now. He kept saying, ""So, do you still want to be my friend?"" The conversation resulted with a lot of tears because I finally let out all of the emotion that had been building up for about a month now. I finally said, ""Just come and get me and we'll go riding around or something and talk."" He told me that he'd be here in 30 minutes. I thought it strange because it only takes 15 to get to my house, but I didn't think too much into it. After I got off of the phone with him, I went in the bathroom, still upset and I was trying to gain composure. I hate for people to see me cry, and I hate to even make it obvious that things bother me. Well, Laura knocked on the door and asked me if I was alright. I told her that I was and she said, ""Well, I don't believe you. You've been acting strange for the past week or so and I want to know what's going on."" I kept saying, ""It's stupid. It's just stupid. I don't want to tell you."" She assured me that whatever it was wasn't stupid and that I needed someone to listen to me. Well, I sat down on the edge of the tub and I laid it all out for her. About Donal, about not hearing from him, about how it makes me feel, about James and Megan and how it makes me feel to know that he's gotten what he wants and I'm still just kinda hanging around. She said, ""Ohhhh. So he's the one you called that time."" I nodded at her and she said, ""Well, call him. You need to know what's going on. If he's dating someone else or if he's just having financial troubles. You just really need to know so that this will stop affecting you this way. Call him. Call him right now."" I explained that I couldn't call because it was too late and she told me that if I ever wanted to call from the house phone, that I could. I don't really want to, though. I feel like I'm trespassing through some boundary that is not supposed to be crossed and that I'd be invading on his personal space. I should probably just call, but I want him to be there when I do. I can't know that he'd definitely be there if I just called on a whim. Anyway, I got all of that out and I decided that I now felt better. When James arrived, he hugged me and told me that I looked nice even though my face was all splotchy and red from crying. We left and we talked a little about what was going on with me and I told him about telling Laura. Well, he then blows my face off with the following news. He tells me that when I called earlier that Megan was still there. That he told her what was wrong with me. About them and Donal. I just looked at him and said, ""Why would you do that to me?"" He just said, ""I don't know."" I was furious. I started screaming at him and asking him how he could call himself my best friend if he'd turn around and do something like that after I specifically asked him not to. He didn't say anything. He just sat there. In turn, that made me even more angry and we sat in silence for what seemed like hours while riding around. I finally said, ""Are you gonna say anything? I don't know what to do, I want to send you on your way now. I'm glad Megan can trust you. Now you can trust each other because I can't trust you."" He just halfway looked at me and said, ""I'm sorry."" I then told him that it wasn't okay and it isn't okay for him to do things like that. After a little while more of riding around in silence, I said, ""Just take me home."" Once we pulled up in the driveway, he said, ""Are we all still going to the gym tomorrow?"" I said, ""No, I don't want to be around you."" Then I shut the door. I felt so betrayed. I still do. He called today while I was at work and asked Ashley if she and I wanted to go to the movies. He can go fuck himself now. On a different note, after I had almost sliced my fingertip off at work, Ashley called to tell me that Alex is coming over tonight. That she was at her house. I haven't seen or spoken to her in over a year. Alex got on the phone and sounded extremely excited to talk to me. It made me feel better. She's coming over tonight to play games with us. I hope it's fun. I really need to have some fun.

I say ""daddy"" like a little girl, when I'm scared, but reaching out to him leaves me feeling empty.

"event","So, yea. James told me that he's in love with me and he's jealous of Donal. Ugh. Last night, he kept asking me to kiss him and kept trying to hold my hand. I felt entirely helpless. I was pretty drunk, but I had to maintain a sober front in order to handle what was going on. He kept drinking more and more. I took the bottle from him and he started yelling at me and saying, ""You have everything! I have nothing! Just give me the bottle!"" God, it sucked. He started puking after chugging out of the bottle and I just took off walking around Overton Square. When I came back, he was attempting to walk towards me, but really wasn't getting anywhere. He was covered in vomit and kept asking me to let him just touch my face. As I type, I am shaking my head. I looked at him and said, ""Why do you do this to yourself, James? Why can't we just drink and have a good time? You've drank too much, and I can't stand to see you this way."" He was leaning on the back of some truck trying to keep himself upright, and he said, ""It's because of you."" He then went into talking about how he's recently started regretting how he never noticed me before. It's just something that happened recently. It made him realize that he wants to be with me. I told him that I didn't believe him. I told him that I think that he's so desperate for someone to love, that he's going to the one person who he knows already loves him, and he's making those friendship feelings into something that they aren't. He then asked me about 17 thousand times to kiss him and I decided that I needed to go home. James went into his house and threw up and went to bed. I sat downstairs with Jon and I was trying to sober up before I drove home. He kept asking me if I was okay and then told me that James had told him that he'd had feelings for me for a long time. Then Jon asked me to come sit next to him. I declined the offer and lied by saying that I wouldn't be able to walk over there. He then told me that he doesn't have any emotional feelings toward me besides sexual ones and the ones that keep us friends. He then said, ""Just pull your pants down to your knees and put your legs up. Just let me put it in."" I was like, ""What the fuck? Is everyone gonna do this to me today? Don't worry Jon, I wouldn't give you that satisfaction."" He came back with, ""What turns you on? Is it how a guy kisses you? Or is it a place that he touches you? What are those places?"" I was like, ""Ugh. It's mostly how they kiss me. Wait. What the fuck am I doing? I don't need to tell you this! That isn't something you should know. You're really creeping me out. Jon, you have a fucking girlfriend!"" He just shrugged and told me that once I had sex with him, I'd want more, and more, and more. I was like, ""Yea. So that you can pound away at me and not give a shit the next morning? I don't think so. Your goods are way too big."" Jon-""Well, how many people have you slept with? I've always wanted to know that. I can tell by looking at you that you're experienced."" What? Is it the way I blink?

After that last statement, I went and got Ashley and I took the risk of driving home in the state that I was. Ashley wanted to stay because she was drunk out of her mind. I didn't. I didn't want to have to put up with everything coming at me from all sides. People thinking that just because of what's going on in my life and being let down recently, that I'm just gonna fuck them or love them to make it all go away. Well, you know what? When I woke up the next morning, I'd feel even worse, and the things that linger in the back of my mind would still be there. The initials on my wrist would still be there and the person laying next to me would still not be the person that I want it to be. 

Now you might understand a little bit better about why I hate everything.

So, yea. Took my English final this morning. It was surprisingly easy. I walked in and almost tripped when I saw who was sitting behind me. Brandon ""Goats"" Coats. It was after the exam that he tapped me on my shoulder and said, ""Holy shit, you don't even look the same"". I gave him a side glance and nodded. He told me that he's missed me, blah blah blah. He said he was coming over today at noon. I am so not there right now and I don't even feel bad (It's 12:35). I went to see my academic probation officer not too long ago. God, I hate her face. I can't even tell you how much. She has a lazy eye and her complexion is horrible. She is moreso oddly proportioned than I am. Ugh. I told her that I've only managed to get in 1.5 hours of tutoring so far because of work and she wrinkled up her stupid face in something that was supposed to be a smile and shrugged at me. She then said, ""IIII don't know what youuu want me to tell youuuu."" God, I wanted to punch her in the face. I have until tomorrow to finish 3.5 hours of tutoring that I don't even fucking need. 
I went to the bookstore and sold my books and Jared at the bookstore was all, ""Oh, just the person I was hoping to see today."" I smiled at him and said, ""Um, why?"" He said, ""Well, we are very interested in having you back with us for the Spring of 2004. Please give me a call after the holidays and let me know what you're taking next semester so that we can work around it."" That fucking jackass wants me back. Jackass, jackass. Then he was all over my Ramones hoodie like a big greasy cock. ""Oooh, The Ramones are so good. We should really hang out sometime and like...listen to...music"". Funny. I was given a complimentary pen that reads, ""What's in it for U?"" I don't know, motherfuckers. What exactly IS in it for me?

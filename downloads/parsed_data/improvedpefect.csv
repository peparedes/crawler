It is a strange thing, and something we had never encountered before this world, and before this curse of humanity befell us.  I still wonder perhaps if this form served some larger purpose, for the lessons I have learned within it and the realizations I have come to will be with me always.  When I look to the sky at night, Mew, I am looking for the cords of our bond.<br />Someday, Mew, we will be reunited.  I sense this and await that day...

Father appears ill, though.... I wonder, he doesn't seem to like being called ""father,"" should I call him Mewtwo then?&nbsp; But he, with the help of mother - Mew? - remade me, so I do not need to kill anymore.&nbsp; Father is asleep now, but in his sleep he mutters about mother - is he worried about her for some reason?

You don't really try to seduce people... it just seems to happen.
Fun loving and free spirited, you bring out the inner child in people.
You are spontaneous, sincere, and unpretentious - a hard combo to find!
People drop their guard around you, and find themselves falling fast.</font></td></tr></table>

"event","where have bourbon biscuits gone??????? please sum1 answer me!!!  am missing them, lovely chocolately soft cream! mmmmm anyway that was quite random

today has gone so slow, dunno why just one of those days. Does anyone else eat loads when they dont actually have much to do, which is soooooooo bad because ive been at a loose end all day - i should get into my reading list, get prepared for uni but meh ill get round to it

guyz u gotta check out The Blitz - Rich sent me the link, they r a fab band from Sunderland so check them out at www.the-blitz.co.uk!!! Best song has gotta be Girl from the 80's but listen to all as they r good.

I suppose id better mention that we do have a new Pope (every1 knows but i felt shallow just talking bout biscuits) but tbh i dont know much about him so cant say as i dont want to be judgemental or say the wrong thing...

However Beth and I were really dissapointed to discover you can't buy inflatable Popes in Venice - letdown like...lol on a more trival note

Scary movie is on later - am i the only person that is still scared in that movie??? its funny but still always get scared :S

Yay my second post!!!! Had a gd (apart from having flu) week - on thurs went bowling, girls against guys - yeah i know its bit if a cliche but tis fun! of course the ladies won, Linz did happen to fix our scores and we did have bumpers but thats not the point. WE WON YAY!!!!!!!! of course Jason got really competitive and was being mean as usual lol, its fine tho Phil and I have given him a new nick name....loser. lol am just jesting.    

We then went to Fox and Hounds, loads of people were there for Bungle's 18th (lol he was so gone)- was cool but was boiling am sure every actually wanted to strip off...Em and I tried to play pool but failed miserably, Em is smaller than the cue stick teehee so in the end we gave up as we took bout 30 mins to pot one ball..the white 1. It was great seeing every1 but am feeling bit down at the mo hardly saw n e 1 because of this stupid flu and now every1 has gone back to uni!!!! its really upset me actually....oh well...summer is soon! 

Then on Friday i think it was, the introduction of Tiger Drive records! which was fab actually!! DT looked so smooth in suits.Black shirts and white ties and so yummy. played well guyz!!!

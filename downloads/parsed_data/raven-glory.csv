"event","Is it just me, or is something up with Alastor Moody these days? Vivian tried to contact him via the fire yesterday and he seemed too preoccupied to talk to her. His own sister... they usually chat for hours, those two, they're very close...

I do hope he's not overworked - or is it something else? I know it's a difficult time for him what with the Death Eaters and all - but still..."

"event","I must say I enjoyed your recent article - you made some excellent points. Personally, I see the differences between Muggles and our kind as cultural rather than having anything to do with species, and learning more about each other would be useful.

I bet the likes of Lucius Malfoy wouldn't have approved, though. Merlin, that man is insufferable!

You've quite a fan in Vivian, I must mention. She's wanting to know when your next piece is coming out!"

"event","Vivian's no fun when she's in one of these moods.

I mean, bloody hell. She's worrying needlessly in my opinion. I don't think the Ministry would be so stupid as to try and push her towards a desk job or early retirement. She's only 52, and her brother Alastor's just 2 years younger and I don't see the Ministry retiring <i>him</i> any time soon.

I really feel for her though... the ageing thing has never bothered me, but I'm only 28 after all. Although Viv doesn't speak of it, I think she's worried about whether I'll ever be tempted to go after a woman closer to my own age...

The answer of course is no. I love Viv for who she is, and the age difference between us has never bothered me. I just hope it isn't starting to bother Vivian. Because I couldn't stand to see her hurting that much."

"event","I must say I was proud of the people who stood up to the Death Eaters like that - well done! Viv was a bit miffed at missing most of the action, but I'm just glad it wasn't worse than it was.

How are you folks holding up, anyhow?"

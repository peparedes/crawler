She took me outside earlier.  That was interesting.

Still, sleeping is good.  I think I'm going to sleep a little more now.

I might keep this journal, but I might not -- it's going to be awfully hard to look at it without crying for a while.  No, Sugs isn't gone yet.  We went to the vet this morning to see if anything could be done, but there isn't anything, so (aside: aaaand she just peed on me.  Rotten to the end -- that's my cat) we're going back in four and a half hours for the very last vet visit.

This sucks.  Immensely.  I've known this was coming for months (eight or so, in fact), but it still really sucks.

And now, without further ado: Sugar."

"event","MY definition of hell: holding my failing pud while she twists about after yakking in her Cone of Shame and getting it in all the delicate structures of her face, TRYING and failing to use her paws to rub the crap out of her eyes 'cause, well, Cone of Shame.

Yes, we cleaned her face off for her.  Poor puddy.  It sucks that she has to deal with this kind of crap now.  It really sucks that I don't think the Cone is going to come off for more than an hour or so ever again.  It sucks that she's gotten fleas AGAIN, and we can't use the stuff that works 'cause it'll make her kidneys fail faster.  It sucks that she's covered in flea bites when her tumor-filled ear is ALREADY itchy.  It seriously sucks that she's leaking pee again, meaning I'm going to have to take her to the vet to get an antibiotic shot a week or two earlier than she should get it, 'cause the last one hasn't cleared out of her system yet.  It sucks that we have to give her subcutaneous fluids at home at least every other day.  It sucks that her food has to be elevated on a dish so she can get to it while wearing the Cone.  It sucks that every time she shakes her head, she breaks open the scab in her ear and bleeds all over everything.  It sucks that the fleas REALLY like all the blood.  

And yet, I pick her up...and she purrs, and we cuddle, and she goes limp with bliss, falling asleep while I play with the little pink paw pads of one of her feet.  Dying is annoying and messy and it sucks (see above), but there are still sunny windowsills to occupy, glasses full of vodka and grapefruit juice to knock over, and humans to snuggle.

It's not quite time to go yet.  Soon, but not yet."

Of course, that doesn't mean that sometimes I do not get lonely.  For example, right now, when I have climbed onto my human's bed while she is playing with the glowy tappy thing that I like to sit on.  When it's being glowy, I can walk all the way up next to it and wait, and my human, being well-trained, will pet me.  Usually she will cuddle me as well, which is a wonderful turn of events for all concerned.  One way or another, I get to bother my human while she's doing something that isn't me-centric.

"event","So I was in the library, doing a spot of writing, when I caught a flash of movement out of the corner of my eye.  I looked, and there it was, a bug of some sort (closely related to a cockroach by its shape and coloring), crawling remarkably slowly across the rug.  Even though it was going about tortoise speed, I didn't get to it in time, so I didn't manage to kill it before it got itself under the sofa.

Well cruds.

I tried to ignore it, but once I know there's a bug in my home, I kind of HAVE to kill it, and I have problems doing things like eating or sleeping until it's gone.  Sadly, I didn't feel like moving the stupid sofa only to find that the bug had moved or that I couldn't catch it.

As a sort of tongue-in-cheek move, I opened the doors to my suite, allowing Sugs into the main part of the house.  I mean, why not?  Any time she finds a bug (that I know of) she yowls for me -- I wouldn't have to find the bug; she would find it for me.

I opened the doors, Sugar trotted out, and I went back to my room to read.

Five minutes later, the yowling began.

Figuring it couldn't POSSIBLY be what I thought, I followed the sound of the yowling, only to find Miss PuddiePants sitting on the dining room rug, staring at a neatly flipped-over but still alive bug.  I killed the bug, and all was well.

I swear, I had no idea that my crazy scheme would actually WORK.

So, note to self: Sugar isn't just decorative, she has a talent.  Sugar is a Bug Finder.

Who knew?

I rocketed out from under the covers like something had exploded, grabbed my glasses, and headed for my beloved pink pet, afraid that the horrible sounds she was making indicated that she'd been poisoned or hurt or that something else extremely horrible had happened.  Either that, or it was a bug.

There she was, Madame Pink, sitting in front of the bathroom, staring at the large bug on the carpeting in front of her.  Did it move?  No.  Did she attempt to catch it, eat it, or even nudge it with a paw?  No.  She just yowled and made other horrible cat sounds while I killed the bug and flushed it.

Of course, I don't want to lose my human again, so when she moves from one end of the house to the other, I follow a few steps behind her.  She gets misplaced so easily.

I kind of like the Land of Boxes, really -- there are big windows that get lots of sun with boxes in front of them so I can perch and/or lounge.  Kibble arrives, as per usual, infrequently and often late, but the water is fresh and clean and the litter, so far, has been the same.

Sometimes my human and her mother watch the glowy box in one of my rooms or the other (I have two main rooms, plus a litter room, though they're all pretty small), and I get cuddled, whether I want to or not.  Sometimes I hear and smell other cats outside my doors, but they haven't invaded my space yet.  Likely they are afraid to tangle with a master of Cat Fu.

I SUCK AT RESEARCH.

I hate doing it, and I'm not very good at it.  So here I am, in my apartment, suddenly realizing that I basically have tonight to learn about Conversation Analysis.  I have to somehow know enough about it and the enormous body of work in the area to be acceptable to the professor who teaches the subject.

Right."

"event","Well, my application to graduate got submitted.  I have no idea why it worked this time, since it didn't work last week and nothing's changed since then, but hey, I'm not gonna complain.

I also noticed that it's actually due on the 25th, not the 15th, so...yeah.

Anyway, now I just have to put the extra lit in that my one reader asked for, somehow wrangle the report into the correct format (not as easy as it sounds), get signatures from my readers (one of whom is in Romania, with the other being in Tuscon), get a signature from the grad advisor (who I hope will be okay doing that ASAP since she's going to be gone as of the end of this week), and...wait...that's it.

Well cruds.  Like I said earlier: this may yet work."

I'm still coming down off that high.

Also, my good friend Cel made me realize something I hadn't: no, it's not adviseable, and yes, it would mean that I'd be tossing ANOTHER $3,000 right after the tens upon tens of thousands I've already spent on this damn thing, but, if I really really had to, I MIGHT be able to get another person to be my first reader, and I MIGHT be able to get my master's through in the fall.  It would be really really annoying, but it IS possible.  It is.  Not real possible, but I've had a course with basically every prof in the department at least once, so I could probably convince at least one of them to be willing to read my report.  It's not the best solution, but it would, in the end, work.

That's...a really comforting thought.  Not the best of ideas, but hey, I'd get my flipping degree.

Thanks, Cel.  I really needed that."

All I did was leave a doot or two on the carpet and a big smelly one in the box, and now my box is clean, parts of the carpet have been cleaned, the trash was taken out, and the human's even doing laundry -- sheets, rugs, and some shirts!  She even put her smelly shoes outside!

All that for one or two little doots."

"event","Hm.  So some of you might have noticed that I tend to wrap my hair around my neck sometimes.  It's mostly to keep it out of the way, but I just do it sometimes, even if I don't REALLY need to keep it out of the way, 'cause I know where it is, then.  Usually I end up with about sixteen inches of hair hanging over my right shoulder, 'cause that's just where it ends up.  I had always thought that was okay, and not usually in the way.

Apparently it's in the way when you're eating Kraft parm with a spoon.

Now I have to pick grated cheese out of my hair.  Grand.  Just grand."

It should be fixed now, though I'm going to wait a few days to see if my second reader will respond to my e-mails before I actually apply -- I have a feeling that I might have to shop around and see if someone else will be willing to be my second reader (UGH).

"event","To all those other cats out there:

I know that it seems counter to your nature, but sometimes manners are helpful.  Sometimes your human will reward you for sitting patiently next to him/her, or for asking politely to come onto his/her lap.  I know your first instinct is to demand (it's mine, too), and you have every right to whatever you want, but consider politeness as a sort of grease on the cogs of service.

It's certainly been working for me."

My prospective first reader is doing the ""I can't help -- here's my number if you need it,"" the graduate advisor misunderstood my problem (this is common), and the person who runs all the admin stuff in the department referred me to the degree evaluators.

So I sent an e-mail to a degree evaluator.  We'll see how this works.

"event","Okay, so I tried to apply (again) to graduate this morning.  I've tried a few times, but I kept getting stopped by my need to put in an address that would actually work past three weeks from now.  Well, I've got the address (a PO box), but now I have a new problem: my supervisor isn't on the list of approved faculty, even though I specifically asked her about it a week or two ago.

I would assume this is because she's leaving.  Since no one's said there's anything wrong with her being my supervisor, I'm really hoping that the graduate advisor (or, more likely, the lady who does all in our department) or whomever can fix this ASAP so that I can apply and get this whole mess done.

I kinda knew something like this would happen (and, quite frankly, I'm expecting more snags...lots more snags...), which is why I've been trying to make myself get this from done and in, even though it's one of those big things that's really hard for me to make myself do.  Forms like this, for some reason, just scare me.  Taxes, financial aid, graduation forms...stuff like that.  Big stuff.

I am, however, seriously glad I made myself do it two weeks before the form is due, 'cause the people in my department aren't exactly known for speed.  Heck, I've waited a month to do this -- I'M not exactly known for speed.  And, of course, like I said, chances are there'll be more snags.  Many more snags.  Sigh.

Here's hoping this all works out.  I'm not overly worried, 'cause I've found that if you have the people in the department on your side you're usually okay, even if you're not quite meeting the rules (I'm hoping the department's on my side in this, but I'm mildly sure that the Graduate Advisor would like me to actually GET a degree) but I'm worrying almost on principle.  You know the drill."

"event","Sometimes my human and I communicate very well.  Obviously there are those times when I see fit to express myself vocally -- generally when I'm particularly annoyed, either because I have been grabbed or poked, or when the kibble is not as forthcoming as it should be -- but sometimes we can communicate in other, less obvious ways.

Yesterday, for example, my human was on the bed, playing with the little black thing and the glowy box.  I, however, felt like some cuddling, so I walked up behind the pillow and stood next to her head for a couple of minutes, purring.  And, sure enough, the human figured out what I wanted, grabbed me, stuck me under one arm, and continued playing with the black thing.

I was there for a while, purring -- until the human decided that she needed to get up, basically -- but it was nice.  I don't usually ask for cuddling that way, but it worked remarkably well.  

I might just try that again sometime."

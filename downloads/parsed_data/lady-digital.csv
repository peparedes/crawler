"event","Schwag.. I've had a lot of words but Schwag is a new one. I was browsing MacAddict's site when I saw it.. amused me so I filled out the survey.. which had nothing to do with me since I'm not old enough to work at a job, not to even mention a computer related job but hey :) I also saw a link to an article about the new switching ads.. I saw one yesterday as a matter of fact.. When I was incredibly bored and couldnt use my computer. I almost thought it might be a PC ad at the beginning but.. well, let's just say I'm glad it's an Apple ad. And to any peecee ppl.. <a href=""www.apple.com/switch"">switch</a> :) or <a href=""www.apple.com/switch/whyswitch"">10 reasons</a> :D Why? Cuz there just might be a wet sock filled with lime jello nearby.. :p"

"event","Eh, that was just to get your attention.. If anyone knows, it's from SNL (celebrity jeopardy with Sean Connery, Bjork, and Dave Mathews.. Season Finale actually.. with Winona Ryder) Sitting in my very uncomfortable chair, I look at cyranomn's journal and can't be surprised at the weird stuff he finds.. or how the Joy of Tech comic <i>is</i> so true.. (Never heard of Joy of Tech? www.nitrozac.com Go. Now. And don't forget to look at After Y2K :D) Then I think of quizes and how bad they all are.. though the ones that I find amusing I usually put here.. Where was I? Oh yes. Some people put quizes in their lj or post on the quiz communities I've seen because they have interesting pictures.. Which will affect if I post a quiz in my lj, but not the point :p I will only post quizes that I think are interesting, whose graphics don't suck, and who's subject isn't just dumb.. Unluckily for me, that takes out most quizes :p *yawns* I have all the time in the world for once and nothing to do.. How come this never happens if I have even just something to do? -_-"

"event","I am very in lineage.. and have even thought of quiting after a few things happened including the latest update... which screwed mages btw and didnt make anyone else happy either.. Lineage is getting dumber and dumber.. a friend of mine has gotten kicked because NC is full of aholes who think ""because your account has been accessed by 2 people besides your self in the last month"" you get kicked from lineage and can't use it or any of the 3 servers as a diff account.. They, and a few of my other friends, have started playing a game much like Lineage II will be (well, just for comparison, but it's actually much diff. but anyway.. if u wanna know more to go the website).. Dungeon Seige, which I wanna play but it's made by Microsoft (my ass.. Did you ever think why Microsoft would want to buy Bungie? Besides that their evil, etc. Besides, look at one of Bungie's websites.. Proof Microsoft has them involved with the X-Box at least.)  and I don't have VPC... Oh well. Anyway, I've been pretty much been bored all day.. Out of curiosity I search live journal for ppl interested in Lineage.. But then I realized Lineage is also a thing.. like something to do with heritage or something I think (My vocab. isn't very big, k?) But if any has ever played it and you've taken the time to read this lil rant of mine.. tell me :) Before I decided to rant about NC and Lineage and how it's really starting to suck I had something else in mind.. oh well.. Also, here's a quiz.. kind of odd, but couldnt be odder than the quiz I took earlier.. More on badly written quizes later..

"event","There are many reasons I'm a fan of Douglas Adams.. first of all, his books are absolutely awesome :) For another thing, he was a huge fan of apple and of macs, never using a pc in his life :) He had a whole family of apple computers, including an Apple II, a macintosh, (ooh yes, <i>the</i> macintosh) and one of the first powerbooks, and has even written articles for such magazines like macuser (some which are published in the The Salmon of Doubt, which was published a little while after his death in May of this year) He complains about dongly things in one of them, and the uselessness of some applications (and also has some fun laughing at pc's during it, even though pc's were never even part of the article) but back to the dongly things.. Douglas Adams, was, of course, British, and had British Apple computers.. So, traveling in the U.S he'd always have to have a universal adaptor, but that's again not part of my point. He complains about the American dongly things on some of his stuff and, oh yeah.. I was gonna have a point to that? Oh yes, that that's one of the things he complains about, that along with Frank the Vandal (Read his books, and then when ur done with all of em, or at least the Dirk Gently and Hitchhiker ones, read The Salmon of Doubt- it's great.. Oh yes, and then rent the 2 dvd set of the television series, or better yet.. buy them! :) ) Anyway, that was basically the point of this entire post :) <table width=""350"" border=""0""><tr><td width=""144""><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.geraldfield.com/nadinesplace/calvinquiz/spiff.gif"" width=""142"" height=""125"" align=""absmiddle""></div></td><td><div align=""center""><b><font size=""3"">You are Spaceman Spiff!</font></b><br><font size=""2"">Zounds!

"event","I'm so tired.. I don't know why, really, either.. (I was supposed to have a point to that, wasn't I? Oh well..) Looking at a picture of Konoko that I have (One of the three that are my uploaded pics) I came to thinking what age Konoko was.. (I think about a lot of pointless things.. I know) Of course she wouldnt age physically, but it's also obvious she couldnt be any older than early 20's.. So goes how I got to wondering how old she would've been and how she even got her supernatural strength and all that.. (Which reminded me of SpiderMan) Which also brought to mind another obvious reason I hate Microsoft.. I think too much, I realized, and stopped.. And then I went on to being annoyed at the size of the latest Lineage update which doesnt really help me at all.. Actually, the only parts that will even affect me is that any monster's that are at a lower level than 2/3 of my lev. (approx. 14.. I'm almost at lev. 27) will give me 10% less exp. every lev. below that, which obviously isnt any help since the higher lev. you are the more exp. you need to actually get an exp. point

Maybe I should do something productive, like clean up my desktop (put all the files away.. etc.) but, I think I'll wait till the desktop's covered first.. It's not the messiness that annoys me, it's when all my downloads file up over my hard drive (Which, I need another of, saying I'm down to about 1 GB left) and I have to dig it out. Well, I should end my pointless thoughts for right now and do something a little more entertaining.. If it doesnt require too much thought ;)

"event","Im not sure really how I feel right now.. And if I did, I wouldnt be wondering how I felt right now. My graduation is next wednesday.. I wish it was sooner, though, because If youll understand this- I've been in the same school for 9 years now with many of the same people in a class that only has 26 people.. And about 6 that are guys. I think if I stayed any longer, I might explode. I would be playing Lineage right now but I got a little bored and decided I might as well start my lj. Well, that's about it.

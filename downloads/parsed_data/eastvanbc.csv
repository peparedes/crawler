"event","It's an interesting take on Peanuts (Charlie Brown and the crew).

<lj-cut>
What if Snoopy actually died? 

It would be the single most shocking moment in comics history. I mean, it's not like when Superman died. Superman's job is to go out and get punched in the face, so it's not too surprising when he got beaten to death. It's on his resume: ""1937 to 1992: Flew around and got punched. 1993: Died, got resurrected. Temporarily out of work. 1994: Went back to being punched.""

But Snoopy. Snoopy lays around all day and eats dog food. If he died, there would be absolutely no logic behind it. And I thought I would bring a small synopsis of - what would happen to the characters in Peanuts if Snoopy died:

Charlie Brown: ""Auuuuuuuuugh!"" he cried in agony, pounding the floor. ""I can't even keep my dog alive!"" Charlie Brown took it harder than anyone; he stayed in his room for a month after Snoopy died. It occurred to us that Snoopy was the only thing Charlie Brown had in life. He grew emaciated; we pushed meals under the dog door in his room, but he refused to eat. He even lost interest in baseball.

But one day, a month later, he emerged, looking pale and unwashed. ""I think I can go on,"" said Charlie bravely, got dressed, and walked out into the world again. Unfortunately, the first person he saw was Lucy, who pulled a football out from underneath him for the last time, and that was the last anyone ever saw of Charlie Brown alive. 

Peppermint Patty: She took Charlie Brown's death harder than anyone; even though she was a rough 'n' tough tomboy, Patty had never had the guts to tell Charlie how much she loved him. And now it was too late. At the funeral, she choked back tears as she threw a baseball mitt on Charlie's bier. Later that night, she stole a gun out from under her father's bureau and went to the veterinary hospital screaming, ""CHUCK! CHUUUUUCK! WHHHHYY???""

She got four doctors and a nurse before the police cut her down.

Lucy Van Pelt: Even though she supposed she was responsible for Charlie Brown's death in a way, she didn't really care. He was a loser; even after years of state-sponsored psychotherapy (""Advice: 5 cents"") and Prozac-spiked lemonade, he still hadn't come to terms with his pitiful life. It was at that point that Lucy decided she would never wind up like Charlie Brown. Lucy grew up to be a talk show host, interviewing lesbians and transsexuals for a living. Her ratings were better than Oprah.

Sally Brown: One good thing came of Charlie's death; the teachers finally noticed that Sally was Learning Disabled and suffered from a severe case of Attention Deficit Disorder. This was the reason she had been giving strange, unrelated reports in class for the past two years. Thanks to money provided by MetLife's coverage of Charlie Brown's death, the Brown parents were able to afford tutors. 

Schroeder: He wrote a fifteen-minute classical fugue, entitled ""Opus Loser"", in memory of Charlie's death. It was so beautiful that his unsupportive parents finally decided to buy Schroeder a real piano instead of the plastic toy one he'd been playing on for years. It took him another six years before his feet could reach the pedals.

Pig Pen: Pig Pen was never able to forget Charlie Brown; scrub as he might, bits of black dirt from Charlie Brown's grave stayed embedded in his skin for the rest of his life.

Linus Van Pelt: ""As I laid my blanket on Charlie Brown's casket,"" wrote Linus years later, ""I realized I was saying goodbye to my childhood. Charlie Brown was something innocent, so open and easily hurt by all the world that eventually it killed him; I resolved never to become like him. When I laid my blanket, the symbol of all my childhood fears, in the grave with Charlie Brown, I was laying to rest all of the vulnerable days of my youth. In that day, I became a man.""

Linus's autobiography, ""The Death Of Charlie Brown,"" won him the Pulitzer Prize for Literature. It was his fourth. But Linus could never speak in public, because hearing the relentless ""wah whuh wah wah whuh"" of his voice only reminded him that he was no longer a child.

The Little Red-Haired Girl: She'd had a crush on that round-headed kid for years. She never told him. She died a virgin.

"event","Two funny thoughts.

1. Despite what you've been led to believe, some lesbians are pretty attractive. And it's every guy's nightmare - a cute girl who literally has no interest in you, either as an individual or as a race. The only way to cover your ego is to say, ""Well, she hasn't slept with me yet. If she just gave me a shot she'd see why men are so hot, y'know?""

Somewhere, there's a homosexual guy saying the same thing about you.

and...

2. Much like you should never shop when you're hungry, you should never trust your dick to make financial decisions. The penis doesn't pay the Visa bills, unless you're Ron Jeremy."

"event","I woke up a short while ago, and if I don't write this shit down, i'll forget it.

I had 2 dreams this morning. What was odd was they were the same dream experienced from different parts of the world. The plot goes something like this: the Sun is growing for some reason, and the Earth has about 2 hours left until the sun swallows it. (Ignore the scientific questions here, it was after all a dream.)

In dream #1 I was in Russia for some reason, in a bunker with 2 soldiers. The soldiers were pretty freaked out about the human race ending and stuff. So, the decided to grab me, and all 3 of us found this old GM city bus. And we drove until the end came. Then, in real life, Jen (we'll learn more about her in dream #2), who stayed over here and got drunk with me last night, woke me up to tell me she was leaving and she'd see me at rehearsal tonight. I said it was cool, and went back to sleep.

In dream #2 I was here in Vancouver, in a scientific building of some sort. I know this because there were beakers and tubes and stuff all over the joint. Anyway, I was in this lab type thing with Jen, my friend and stage manager in the play I am currently acting in, in real life. We were just shooting the shit to each other, watching the sky. It was dark outside, but as the sun got bigger, the nightime began to dissolve away. At first, you could only see the clouds near the northwest horizon become orange, like they are at sunset, then the sky got bluer. Eventually, it was as bright as the daytime. Around then, a man came into the lab, and handed me several books of tickets. He said that he thought we would get a kick out of these. Then he left. I looked at the tickets, and what was on them. Oddly enough, usually text in my dreams is blurry and unreadable. These tickets were clear and readable to me in the dream. The tickets had many different venues and cities printed on them. But all of the events were the unique events throughout history when people thought the world was ending for one reason or another. The one I remember most was a ticket that was from New York City and had just a date as the event. The date said 01/01/2000. I chuckled at that one. So Jen made a point of noticing that it was about that time. I began to weep. Jen hugged me, which is weird because she wouldn't do that, and I embraced her, weeping, watching out of the lab window as the day gained light exponentially. Then it just went to black, and I woke up.

Odd, huh?"

Well, everyone except Me, Jer, Crystal, and Alli. We were on our geology kick last night and figured out that when the Cascadia Subduction Zone decides to produce the once-every-500-years 700 mile long >8.5 richter scale earthquake, everything between Juneau, Alaska and Portland, Oregon is toast. Not just from the intense 10-20 minute shaking, but by the 1000 foot tsunami wave that will certainly follow. But back to the 4 of us making it out alive. Jer and I concocted a plan. When the shaking starts, we meet at the end of the main East-West runway at YVR (Vancouver Int'l Airport). I, having many years of Cessna 182RG flight simulator experience, will have the plane fueled and ready for takeoff when Jer gets there. Crystal is with me, and we fly out to get Alli. Then, we soar back into the wild blue yonder, and watch it all get washed away from our front row seats.
<h2>MORE FROM THE GEOLOGY CLASS...</h2>
Jer and I, in our infinite and soulmate way, used our brains some more and figured out that there just may, in 10,000-100,000 years, be a new tectonic plate trying to form. We studied 4 earthquakes in the middle of the North Atlantic plate, which are, the 1811-12 New Madrid, Missouri series (3 major quakes measuring >7.5), the 1800's Charleston, South Carolina quake (8.0), the January 21,1994 Reading, Pennsylvania series (2 quakes in one hour, 4.0 and 4.6) and a recent micro-quake this week in, get this, Kansas. So we drew a map. You can view our work at http://www.kenschaefer.com/skar/newplate.jpg
...and tell us whether or not it seems farfetched.

We rock, me and Jer.

"event","SO I auditioned for a band today. It went good. I think I will get the gig. These guys are rockin! They sound like Incubus on steroids. Really kewl. Oh, to explain the Gord Thompson thing...I went to Wendy's before the audition, and I filled out the customer survey card saying that everything sucked harshly, and put my name in as Gordon Thompson. Very Canadian name, EH? 

LOL.

GO NUCKS!!!

"event","Boy, since I got here, I have become such a hockey head. Weird. I used to be a baseball nut...but anywho. Markus Naslund HAT TRICK!!! 3 goals in one period helping the Vancouver Canucks win over the LA Kings 5-2. If Edmonton loses tomorrow and Vancouver wins at Calgary on Saturday, the Canucks will be in the NHL Playoffs!!! Oh, man this is gonna be cool. So, the idea here is, I don't care where you are from, or who your team is, root for the Vancouver Canucks to win on Saturday. That's all I ask. So I repeat, GO 'NUCKS GO!!!

Yours Truly, #5, Jason

If you don't know that backstory, DON'T ASK. But for those who do, imagine it. I could take callers and stuff. Yeah, the Jason Show, starring Jason, Produced by Jason, Written by Jason. Hair by Toni. LOL.

Also, since when does the RadioShack at Pacific Centre close at 7:30pm??? I thought the mall downtown closed at 9pm. Oh well.

"event","Was listening to an old episode of Howard Stern today and it was an episode with Noel Gallagher of Oasis on. He played Wonderwall and Don't Look Back In Anger acoustic and live with no band. Not even his cock of a brother Liam there. It sounded awesome. I downloaded those 2 songs and remembered why I liked Oasis. Solid songs and even more solid songwriting. Hmmm...why did it take me this long to like them again? Not sure.

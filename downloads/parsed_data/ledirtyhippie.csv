"event","<p dir=""ltr"" align=""left"" style=""margin-right: 0px"">&quot;Is it possible that I've suffered so that I, together with my evil deeds and sufferings, should be manure for someone's future harmony? I want to see with my own eyes the hind lie down with the lion, and the murdered man rise up and embrace his murderer. I want to be there when everyone suddenly finds out what it was all for. All religions in the world are based on this desire, and I am a believer.&quot;<em><br />...<br /><br /></em>&quot;I don't want harmony, for the love of mankind I don't want it. I want to remain with unrequited&nbsp;suffering. I'd rather remain with my unrequited suffering and my unquenched indignation, <em>even if I am wrong</em>. Besides, they have put too high a price on harmony; we can't afford to pay so much for admission. And therefore I hasten to return my ticket. And it is my duty, if only as an honest man,to return it as far ahead of time as possible. Which is what I am doing. It is not that I don't accept God, Alyosha, I just most respectfully return him the ticket.&quot;<br />&quot;That is rebellion,&quot; Alyosha said softly, dropping his eyes.<br />&quot;Rebellion? I don't like hearing&nbsp;such a&nbsp;word from you,&quot; Ivan said with feeling. &quot;One cannot live by rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me straight out, I call on you--answer me: imagine that you yourself are building the edifice of human destiny with the object of making people happy in the finale, of giving them peace and rest at last, but for that you must inevitably and unavoidably torture just one tiny creature, that same child who was beating her chest with her little fist, and raise your edifice on the foundation of her unrequited tears--would you agree to the architect on such conditions? Tell me the truth.&quot;<br /><br />-- <u>The Brother's Karamazov</u>, <em>Fyodor Dostoevsky</em></p>"

"event","&quot;So like, right now for example. The Haitians need to come to America. But some people are all, &quot;What about the strain on our resources?&quot; Well it's like when I had this garden party for my father's birthday, right? I put R.S.V.P. 'cause it was a sit-down dinner. But some people came that like did not R.S.V.P. I was like totally buggin'. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, and squish in extra place settings. But by the end of the day it was, like, the more the merrier. And so if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange some things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion may I please remind you it does not say R.S.V.P. on the Statue of Liberty. Thank you very much.&quot; 

Murray: Woman, lend me fi' dollas. 
Dionne: Murray, I have asked you repeatedly not to call me &quot;woman&quot;. 
Murray: Excuse me, &quot;Ms. Dionne.&quot; 
Dionne: Thank you. 
Murray: My street slang is an increasingly valid form of expression. Most of the feminine pronouns do have mocking, but not necessarily in misogynistic undertones.

"event","&quot;What about little microphones? What if everyone swallowed them, and they played the sounds of our hearts through little speakers, which could be in the pouches of our overalls? When you skateboarded down the street at night you could hear everyone's heartbeat, and they could hear yours, sort of like sonar. One weird thing is, I wonder if everyone's hearts would beat at the same time, like how women who live together have their menstral periods at the same time, which I know about, but don't really want to know about. That would be so weird except that the place in the hospital where babies are born would sound like a crystal chandelier in a houseboat, because the babies wouldn't have had time to match up their heartbeats yet. And at the finish line of the New York City Marathon it would sound like war.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />--<u>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</u>, Jonathan Safran Foer<br /><br />I am in love with this book, and I'm meeting the author on Wednesday. Go read it."

Schau aus Deinem Fenster
Schau wer draussen sitzt
Ich bin still hier wartend 
Schon die ganze Nacht
Wenn Du dann Dein Haus verlaesst
Klingle ich und rufe
Ah, mein kleines Maedchen
Mein brennend Verlangen erwarchte Sonntag
Gib mir Dein Herz und ich lieb Dich bis Dienstag

Who's that hiding in the apple tree
Clinging to a branch?
Don't be afraid, it's only me
Hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade
I'll keep you nice and cool

Ah, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never ending
And I'll love you till Tuesday

Let the wind blow through your hair
Be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon
Because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry

Ah, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame
I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl
And I'll love you till Tuesday

Lieb, lieb, lieb, lieb  
Lieb Dich bis Dienstag
Lieb, lieb, lieb, lieb
Lieb Dich bis Dienstag

Na ja, vielleicht wirds ja auch Mittwoch?"

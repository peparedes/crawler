I can live without her. I can. But it's just I hate the way I felt when she left.</P>

<P class=blogContent><STRONG></STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Somewhat recently, as many of you know, I told my parents I was gay. This didn't go over very well, and it ended with my dad crying, my mom tearing, and me not knowing what I'd done - or what to do. It kind of.. went away for about a week or two I think. They claim it's beause they didn't want to interfere with my last week or two of school.&nbsp;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Yesterday they told me that I couldn't go anywhere until I got a job.&nbsp;Out of the blue.&nbsp;Because I'm the most irresponsible child my dad knows - as he told me - mainly because I forget to unload the dishwasher sometimes... it doesn't matter that I have to clean up after my sisters and myself everyday. It just doesn't.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Well today, my mother, father, and I had a very long ""talk"" in my room where they let me know I am to apply for a fundamentalist christian program for gays. They tell me that there is something psychologically wrong with me, and they ""raised me wrong."" I'm a big screw up to them, who isn't on the path God wants me to be on. So I'm sitting here in tears, joing the rest of those kids who complain about their parents on blogs - and I can't help it.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I wish I had never told them. I wish I just fought the urge two more years... I had done it for three before then, right? If I could take it all back.. I would, to where I never told my parents things and they always were mad at me-- It's better than them crying and depressed cause they will have no granchildren from me. It's better than them telling me that there's something wrong with me. It's better than them explaining to me that they ""raised me wrong.""</STRONG></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><BR></P><B><FONT color=#008000></FONT></B>

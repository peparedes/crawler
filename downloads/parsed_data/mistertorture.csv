"event","Well I just got my copy of Anthrax's music of mass destruction a week ago.  Anyway, before I sday what I think, I will preface it with this.  Anthrax is a band I grew up with, even since I was in the first grade I have been listening to Anthrax.  I had their debut record on cassette, and have bought each and every album by them since, in fact I really don't see Anthrax having a ""bad"" record.  There are some albums I like better than others but all in all, they are all good for one reason or another, at least for me.

There have been a good number of metal bands who have gone into the studio and recut old songs.....the first I can remember is Iron Maiden doing it in 1988 when they recorded versions of Prowler and Charlotte The Harlot.....songs from the first debut s/t Maiden record, and used these versions as b-sides.  Iced Earth did it in 1997, they didn't completely re-record the songs but Matt Barlow re-cut the vocals for all of the tracks he didn't sing on as the other songs without him had horrible singers on them.  The album was called Days of Purgatory, Saxon recently re-recorded songs from, their 2 through 5th album on their Heavy Metal Thunder album in 2002,  Running Wild in 1991 recut old songs, Testament back in 2002 re-cut songs from their first album, and shit, Anthrax did it back in 1984 when Belladonna first joined, in fact they did a version of Metal Thrashing Mad and Panic live in the studio back then.....same type of thing they did here with Music of Mass Destruction.

I will admit I had concerns before this album was released.  John Bush doesn't have the vocal range Belladonna or Turbin hadfor sure.  This isn't saying that Bush isn't any good, hes great and he is the singer the band needs right now, I have liked him since the Armored Saint days as Delerious Nomad is my fav Saint album.

As far as this new record goes, I thought it was ok, and as I have said the lack of vocal range John Bush displays hurts it, and the band doing a re-recorded version of Indians bothers me for some reason...I always think of that song as Joey's song....whether he wrote it or not.....he always wore the headdress on stage and shit.  Those to me are the only negatives and neither of them are bad negatives.  They recorded this album the same way my band recorded our debut, live in the studio.....saves money and time that way I guess.  The recordings turned out pretty well for this record, the quality kicks ass.  What John Bush lacks in vocal range he makes up for in improvising(sp?) the vocal parts he can't sing.  I will have to say though I like the originals better than this, its cool to see John's renditions on them but I still like the originals better with one exception.......I think his rendition of Keep It In The Family is better than the original.  I always told ppl that John Bush would have been a  great fit on Persistence of Time maybe even better than Belladonna on some songs.  I also feel if they had taken their time recording this......effects, processors and harmonizers would make John's voice fit more.

Overall i'd give this record a 7 out of 10.....which on my review scale is great....above average, etc  I thought they executed the songs well and they are very tight as far as their playing is concerned.  Hell when was the last time these fuckers player Deathrider live?  Or Panic, or Gung Ho?!  Its been a long time and they played these songs pretty tight.  Charlie changed some of the drum lines slightly on Deathrider but it fit well, kind of like a modern version of it.  At any rate, this disc kicked ass even if I find it to be blasphemy for John to sing a studio version of Indians.

"event","I cant help but play star wars battlefront all fucking day long.  My god, its just like the movies, the battles are that intense.  I love using the ATATs, they fucking rule.  I was playing a battle on Rhen Var and there is tunnel there whoch is made up entirely of ice.  Well I was using the empire, just a standard stormtrooper and the game suddenly says ""Luke Skywalker has entered the game"" and im thinking WTF?  (later on i realized jedis can be in the game) anyway not thinking anything of it I run into this tunnel where there was a fiece amount of firefighting going on, I was one of like 15 stormtoopers trying to breakthrough a bunch of rebels when suddenly I see this dude dressed in black run into the tunnel from the rebel's side of things.  Low and behold its Luke Skywalker.  What I didnt expect is what happened next.  

The fucker stops, and I see him pull out this green lightsabre giving my troops the look of ""Im gonna kill you all"" well, all my troope start shooting at him and hes deflecting like 238904573498573904578903457 shots from their blaster rifles at once he runs up and hacks like 15-20 guys into pieces and im thinking ""FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK"" yes and well the jedis/siths can outrun you because the fucker ran behind me in a matter of seconds and killed me.  So this guy kills 21 p;eople in like 30 seconds,  How insane.

The vehicles are kind of a bitch to drive, especially the fighters, while the X-Wing is easy for me, the tie fighters are a bitch and the jedi starfighters are a bigger bitch.  Nothing is as devatating as a tiebomber or an A-Wing......the bombs in both of these vehicles kill like no tomorrow.  I mean we're talking like 20 names getting killed each time a batch of bombs gets dropped and both fighters are easy to control.  The land speeders, the ones the imperial scouts had on endor are completely authentic in the movie, so authentic the fuckers are too fast to control when you first try and use them.  Most of the land vehicles are pretty easy to use though.  For some reason the wookies are hard to kill but when you use them they are horrible.  The dark trooper and the republic trooper with the jetpack rule.   

Oh and the levels are sweet, probably my fav levels in the game are the ones on tatooine.  The one is at Mos Eisley, its the spaceport and its mass urban battle and the dune sea is always fun, while imperials and rebels fight each other or droids and the republic......you have the damn sandpeople who are neutral trying to kill both factions and the sarlac pit is funny, it grabs ppl if you get too close.  Both bespin levels are fun, especially the one which has all the platforms and landing pads.  The battle of hoth is killer as is the battle at geonosis.  While I like the battles of endor and naboo, the forest level is kind of a bitch to play, you cant see shit and the plans of naboo is more or less boring.  I do like the city of theed though, killer level.  Rhen Var's levels are killer, especially the citadel.  Kamino is good and is total anarchy.  Dont care much for the battles on Yavin and the battles on the wookie homeworld are ok, the one with the docks kicks some major ass, especially since you are trying to strop like a billion battle droids from hitting the beaches.  

My fav vehicle is the Republic MAF, easy to control, and the missles just devistate shit.  Oh yah the droideka is a destructive motherfucker.  Its fun to use it and it sucks to fight it.

Im a geek

"event","Well what else can I say, this week has been rough.  I am understaffed to hell at work and have been trying to hire faster than we fire ppl or lose someone.  I have had a bad two days.   Today sucked because I heard a friend of mine in IRAQ is in critical condition, he lost both of his arms after being ambushed by a bunch of rags.  

The band and I are doing well although I completely HATE our drummer, hes the dumbest, most selfish self centered asshole I have ever met.  Its memememememe and make everyone else work for everything while he sits there and gravytrains us and makes us pay for everything.  What a stupid fucker.

Today is horrible, and it sucks, and kerry lost which pisses me off to that IQ of 86 redneck dumbass.  I would vote for a chimp before I vote for bush, hands down.

I have a lot of energy today, I dont know why.  We're playing a show at the Blue Moose eatery 10pm saturday night.  

Damn this week sucks, Im trying to be happy, im really trying.  The pain is eased because sometimes I daydream and think of a certain person who reads my journal and whehn I think of her I smile.

I'm out like the curse of the babe.

"event","Well much has happened since I have written anything in my journal.  Although I will have to say things have gotten much better for me in the last few months.  I have had a headache off and on the last day or so and its gotten better at least.

Anyway its been a great few months, I got transferred to a new store which kicks some ass.  Although the place is strange that I am at now, I am happy there.  I was at my previous store for more than 2 and a half years and was glad to get out of there for quite a number of reasons.  Mo Rage has been doing well, we are selling quite a number of CDs.

I have had nothing to bitch about concerning women.  I have started seeing someone who I have known for a couple years.  She is an amazing person and is absolutely wonderful to me.  I haven't been this happy in years..........more to come.

"event","So Anthrax is going to record an album of re-recordings.  Basically recording old songs with the new lineup.    Steve always talks about how great of a song Lone Justice.  Well with my birthday being this Sunday, I turn 27, and it also marks my 13th anniversary of being an Anthrax fan as my first album by them was Spreading The Disease.  Let me say the first song that I called my favorite Anthrax tune was Lone Justice, I remember being back in high school and rewinding my walkman to listen to that song over and over again.  I listened to Spreading today and wow.......what memories this album brings back to me.  The same thing has happened when I have listened to these Megadeth reissues.

Anyway I am sitting here listening to the final result of Mo Rage's debut album and I am impressed at how killer this album sounds, especially now that its mastered and the final versions are now on the record.  It wounds like it could be major label quality stuff which is killer.  I cant wait til the CD is duplicated and pressed........

Til next time

Its been a crazy long year that I have been in this band now and we have come farther than most bands do in 5 years.

Its funny how after all this time who are your real friends and who aren't.  Jelousy and selfishnesses is quite common in the music scene in cleveland, luckily we have a very blue collar mentality with our music and our demeanor, we are definitely the coolest band to deal with in this city.

"event","Today was a horrible day at work to cap off a horrible week, I was blamed for a bunch of shit that I didn't even do.  I walked into the door, and basically was screamed at for no reason, and for shit I had nothing to even do with which was not even my fault.  I have made recommendation after recommendation and have complained about people not pulling their weight, not doing their job, etc and I have the same fucking idiots who dont do their job talking  shit to now 4 of my employees that I dont do any work.  I bust my ass everyday when I am at work, and anyone who doesn;t see that is stupid.  I don;t ask for recognition, and obviously I never get it, I came close to walking out today, extremly close, and if I didn't need the money right now I would have.  I have been fucked over every day I have worked this week and when I say something about it, all that happens is....well...NOTHING......nobody cares enough to DO anything about it, so I just get constantly fucked.  From employees being taken off my schedule without me knowing, to having NOTHING DONE when I walk in, and its like it falls on deaf ears and nobody gives a fuck.  I am so sick of this shit....thats ok, because unlike other people I won't put a thief in my veins, mouth or lungs to steal my brains (drug addicts this applies to you), I will deal with it on my own, and I have a possible solution to solving it all.

People wonder why I am so angry, people say this or that well fuck it, they are on the outside looking in, nobody understands my daily fucking ride of agony I deal with daily....and I say again, if I am so bad, DONT TALK TO ME.....PLAIN AND SIMPLE.  Im sick of being fucked over, and thats fine because now, anyone who fucks me over will get it 10 times worse to them.  Beware.

"event","Well its been awhile since I updated eh?  Well I've been pretty busy this past week.  First off I have been jamming nonstop on one of my old school Hammond Organs.....a 1976 T series and I also have a 1978 A-100.  Saturday, I got stood up by some girl (go figure) and I jammed for 10 hours straight on it.  My fingers fucking hurt from flexing my hands to all of the keys.  However it has been extremely fun and has taken away a lot of stress.

Last night or should I say....this morning, I recorded about 95% of my vocal parts for not just our first record, but we are now a bit more than halfway done with the second.  it kicked ass, and singing through a 10 thousand dollard, 50 year old Neuman Condenser Mic didn't hurt.......damn the songs are so badass sounding without even being mixed yet.  This is going to sound so killer it's sick, its godly sounding as it is.  I go back again at Midnight Wednesday to finish.

Last but not least, how sad is it that people in this world are too weak to deal with their problems?  Instead many of them have to slam down a ball of crack, a pound of pot, or 2349785628347563489 gallons of alcohol in order to deal with their problems, then these same people complain that they don't have any money.  I mean what the fuck, thats so pathetic its sick.  Most of the time people like this are the partial or full cause of their problems, abnd even if they are not?  Why get addicted to a substance?  Its completely stupid....shows lack of strength and lack of intelligence since people are probably just too stupid to solve the problem at hand anyway. 

Its one thing if someone is using something for a medicinal purpose such as cancer, a hip replacement etc, but for anything else, its stupidity, plain and simple.

"event","Well tonight was a waste of a 10 hour day, a bunch of band bullshit which wasted my time tonight, mostly because of our pinhead dumbass knucklefuck drummer.  I get to go record my vocals Monday Night after work though so at least that will work out.

On other front, got hatemail out the ass about my entry from yesterday, oh well, life goes well, what do they know.

Im not much into commercial Music but Asia has to be one of the coolest bands I have ever heard.  Great stuff, good 70s oriented prog rock.

I may get yet another kitten....dont know yet.

Ive been stressing out lately about a lot of shit....worst thing about me is I stay happy and let it build up and then just go off.

Ok im done and im tired.

"event","Well lets see, a former member of our band called the venue up we were going to play at, and cancelled us two weeks prior, him and quite a few others have been screweing with us, but we are taking legal action against them, among other things.  Last friday i was so pissed, I took some of our gear back, went up to the gate at Jacob's field and watched the indians play the royals and then left very pissed off....thinking about how I just got fucked.  One of the ppl who has been messing with us, was playing in a club in Lorain.  So at about 1:30am i drove out there, to the club......and I walk in and pointed at him and told him hes dead and that id meet him outside.  He decides to start right then and there and whips me in the bacjk of the head with a surge protector power strip.  Anyway I beat the living shit out of this dickhead and his drummer, while the three friends with me beat the fuck out of the other guys in their band.  I went to jail but was let out since the guy who hit me first I may add.  Anyway I filed an assult charge against all of them....so they are fucked royally.

On another note, I have come to a lot of realizations about life:

1.  No Matter what I do, I seem to piss ppl off

2.  I have figured out what my problem is with not only people but with women especially....oh thats right, I dont HAVE any problems....THEY do.  Women for example, you tell them something and they completely take what you say the wrong way, twist it around then try to fault you for either being a dick or for making them feel like shit when all you do is tell them the truth.....fuck that, fuck this ""Oh  value honesty"" bullshit, its a pack of fucking lies.  Its also funny how people accuse me of this when they turn around and do the same thing....yet Im not even the one DOING THIS.  Instead of dealing with our problems, we blame others, abuse chemicals, dick people over, break a contract, break silence, and we decide to be gullible.  People who also bitch constantly about their problems, never seem to either do anything about them or they continue on paths which keep up the present state of shit they complain about instead of doing anything about it.  They CHOOSE to do what they do, they CHOOSE AND MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS, its THEIR FAULT......Lets also not forget the large amount of stupidity, gullibility, laziness, and selfishness our country has going for it now.  I experienced this shit daily, and still do.  People fight about the dumbest shit. 

3.  Fuck anyone who doesnt like my honesty, ive pissed off 4 people today....i may feel bad for upsetting people but i dont apologize for my honesty, if they dont like it, they shouldn;t fucking talk to me.  And I have also been accused of TRYING and getting OFF on making people feel bad, I would really HATE to see how people would feel if I actually TRIED to do that.  Case in point, I dont try and/or go out of my way to make someone feel like shit.  I give compliments when they are due and I also tell people how it is even if they dont like what i say, if someone cant accept that, then they have the problem....NOT me.  If people think I dont care about anyone's feelings....fine...how about this, how about I actually STOP caring about people's feelings then see how horrible I make someone feel.....then I'm sure they would retract that comment.

4.  I have come to the conclusion that the only person who matters in my life is me, thats it, fuck everyone else.  I'm all that matters and all I should care about. I have also come to the conclusion Im above a lot of people, its taken me 26 years to get to this point of figuring out that most people in this world are below me....and they can all kiss my fucking ass if they dont care for my opinion.  Im accused of all this shit so I may as well live it right?

As John Wayne said in True Grit ""Women, they have no generosity""......THAT is so true its sick.  Women are all about the money, lying, and being right whether they are wrong or not.

Im done venting.

I'm out like the garbage below me.

"event","A wise man once said  ""Honesty is that which people say they want, but talk out both sides of their mouth and really don't.  A dislike of honesty is for the weak only""  I totally agree with this.  I love it when people ask you for an HONEST opinion and they get pissed when you tell them what they don't want to hear, yet it's the truth, something they asked for. So in other words, they get pissed at you for giving them what they wanted....how fucking pathetic is that?  It's like asking a waitress for more ketchup and getting pissed at her for bringing it to you.  A big reason why many people can't handle me or are intimidated by me or get mad at me, because I tell whem the truth whether they want to hear it or not.  Its also funny when people bitch about something or someone yet they either keep doing it or keep fucking them.  Case in point, my cousin bitches about her guy all the time, and the guy is a real asshole who has fucked with her head etc etc, but she keps having kids with him, and when she complains he fucks with her head, she still sleeps with him.  How pathetic is that?  How fucking stupid are you?  How desperete are you? Weak people are pieces of shit.....there needs to be a stupidity bomb, and all stupid people need to die from it.

If you don't like someone being honest with you then you are a weak stupid fuck, end of discussion, this isn't an opinion its FACT.  I can;t stand people who are like this, it drives me up a wall, women are the worst too, they HATE honesty with a passion, maybe thats why they all lie and stretch the truth 100% of the time anyway, not to mention being hypocrites, its because they tell people what they want to hear to get what they want and god forbid you tell them the truth although they say they want someone to be honest with them all the tume, typical hypocritical attitude that females have.  How fucking pathetic.  Most guyd tell women what they want to hear, hence why I dont have a GF which is fine.  At least i have my integrity.

"event","I caught yet another bitch in a lie.  Last month I met a woman who kept telling me how great I was, how awesoem I was, how great of a person I was etc.  We seemed to hit it off great, and then, she never returned my calls, at all.  Granted she was 33 or some crap but things were good and she even told me to please call her the next day....so I called once, left a message....nobody calls me back,  called back two more times....used the three strikes rule.....no call back.  I even instant messaged her, and no reply, and this was on yahoo messenger too which you can recieve instant messages when you aren't online, so I know for a fact she saw the many messages I left her.

So its not a month later, and this bitch messages me....and starts talking to me, and I tell her some crap thats on my mind and she tells me how sorry she is that i have had to deal with so much crap at such a young age, and how great I am and how anyone girl who ends up with me would be the luckiest woman in the world and that anyone who blows me  Basically kissing my ass like crazy.  So we start bullshitting and

So I ask her ""Are you dating anyone yet?"" shes like ""yah Ive been seeing a guy for the last month"".  And we then continue the conversation when I asked her ""If anyone who blows me off is stupid, how come you blew me off?"" and this is how it went:

StupidFuckingCunt:  I didnt blow you off

Me:  You never answered my instant messages or voicemails left on your phone

StupidFuckingCunt: I never got them, you never left me any

Me: Yes I did

StupidFuckingCunt:  I never got them, I swear

Me:  So you mean to tell me that you did not get multiple emails, phone calls AND instant messages?

StupidFuckingCunt:  I didnt, why didnt you keep trying?

Me: Well I figure that after trying like 15 times you weren't interested.

StupidFuckingCunt:  I was interested, but I never got your messages and I swear I would not blow you off.  I have been really busy lately, I swear, I am working round the clock and signed a 250,000 dollar contract this past month and just had a bunch of stuff going on, my cellphone doesnt get messages half the time.

Me:  What about the emails or the instant messages?  By the way I work a 50+ hour a week job plus play and practice in a band yet i had time to talk to you did I not?

StupidFuckingCunt: (no response)
Me:  So in other words you didnt have time to talk to me, but you did have time to start dating another guy right?

This conversation ended badly for her, I dont have time to type the rest but it ended badly for her.  Basically she tried to say she never got the messages and tried to tell me she felt bad etc etc etc.  Basically a bunch of bullshit, as usual from every woman in this world, and people wonder why I think the way I do?  I am at the point where I am starting to really not give a fuck, not even about myself anymore.  I should have been killed when I was 10, sometimes I regret it didn't happen. Also if you dont care much for my opinion.....fuck off. People are so critical of someone when they don't understand how bad things are.   On a lighter note, I got the new Skyclad album and it kicks ass.

The Tony Webster timeline:

It all started Feb 14th.....On valentines day, a good friend/relative of mine tries to kill me by pouring arsenic in my food.  I survived it because #1.  I only took a few bites of what I was eating that night, and #2, my body had been traumitized by a mass poising when I was 10 and was stung like a billion times by a couple scorpions and was in a coma for a week.

Feb 18th:  Went to the clinic to get my blood tested and they find something else that wasn't expected.  They thought I had Leukemia and told me that if I had it I'd be dead in about a year or two.

March:  9th:  get tested again and they find strange patterns with my white blood cells and an abnormal white blood cell count, meaning I most likely may have Leukemia

March:  21st:  After all that is happening to me in normal life this shit makes me flip out, and I start slowly but surely pissing off and driving people away, going into a total state of isolation from everyone except the guys in my band, and in Helloween.

April 1st:  Began to get even worse, I started to alienate many people and just started snapping and not giving a fuck about anybody's feelings, including my own.

April 9th:  get tested again, and am told that I may want to get a second opinion

April 15th:  I get a second opinion and they tell me that things may not be as bad as they seem, that there is a chance I am not going to have any type of terminal illness.

May 1st:  Played a big gig at the odeon, we headlined and put on a hell of a show.

May: 2nd : began to turn almost nearly evil, I was horrible to a shitload of people.

June 16th:  I find out im not going to die at all and make amends with most people.

A few things changed about me as a result, I found out what few people actually gave a fuck about me, at least who they were.  I found out I don't value my life too much.  I also found out that I deserve better than a lot of the shit I havd dealt with......my outlook is much more positive.  Although my theories on women are the same, I was all excited someone hit on me, turns out she was trying to make another guy jelous.....guess thats all I'm good for.

Oh yah and Mo Rage Plays the scene Pavilion Aug 28th :)

"event","I have an ""emergency"" doctor's appointment, they called yesterday and said it was important and that I needed to come in ASAP.  Which usually means bad news.  At this point it doesn't even matter to me if I am going to die or not  I have come to this realization.  I haven't any friends, family, girlfriend, etc and the couple friends I did have will never want anything to do with me anymore because of the fact I didn't trust them and talk to them about my problems and instead pushed them away, so even though things are ""cool"" with them, they really aren't on their part and probably never will be, just yet another thing I screwed up.  Now that I realized my mistake its too late anyway, I have amounted to nothing, will amount to nothing and I am just a waste of space, in a way I hope I do have a terminal illness it'l make things that much easier and I won't be around to waste anyone's time by the fact I exist, not that there's anyone left who cares anyway, now I know why I am a reject.  If there is a problem and its terminal I may just refuse treatment, it will be a waste of money anyway, oh well.....time for my final blood test.  I'll update with the results when I get them.

Im out like my blood in a test tube.

"event","Well its funny how sneaky some of the bands in cleveland can be.  I am the type of person who will give no shit but wont take it either and I am fair, and now you get these fucks with an inferiority complex messing with you.  In the past I have said I don't trust women at all, well I take that back, I trust NOBODY, man, woman, animal, alien....etc etc. Maybe it's because I was brought up not trusting even my own parents and never talking to people about my problems, I just dealt with it and moved on and lately I've started to crack and I really have nobody to talk abour problems with.   Many people in this city I thought were my friends have done nothing but try and completely dick me over.  Fuck it, the only one who is going to give two shits about me is myself.  After all I have been dealing with these last three months, I will admit I have been proven wrong about a couple people who showed they actually cared what happened to me, and actually showed they cared whether or not I exist.  I've also had people trying to cause me detriment by going behind my back and taking statements I said and twisting them around.  The funny thing is that the same two assholes who did this are the same two idiots I was given information on about doing illegal shit they shouldn't be, and a big problem now is that the people who were told I suppossively said stuff probably dont completely believe me because of other people's immaturity and fear that I may give them a good fucking in the ass once I catch them red handed doing shit they shouldn't be.  Damn....the music biz is brutal eh?  As Gord Kirchin from Piledriver once said ""Oh well That's rock n roll"".

We have a lot of shows planned:

June 12th at the grand opening of the Red Parrot in downtown Lorain, damn this will rule, we will put on our own production and everything, an we will pack that place with at least 200-400 ppl easy.

June 26th We play a big outdoor party with about 300 ppl there.

July is going to be killer, and we may just have gotten ourselves a distribution deal.  The first record is almost done being mioxed amnd the second is almost done being recorded.  We are also breaking out new material which makes our current stuff look like little kid crap.  These new songs rule man.....Gnos Yerret, Winds of Change, Dragondance, etc.

So far the albums are titled as followed:

The Fix of Rage - which will be done soon
Into The Eye of The Storm -  We're currently recording this
Disciples of Rage - We're learning the material for this now
Return of the Priest King

Things look good in this respect.  Been talking with Weiki a lot and he has given me so much good advice its sick.  This is a guy who has been through all of the bullshit and has helped myself out tremendously.

My cousin who was stupid enough to have three kids with her asshole husband has now come to realize he is a piece of shit.  The one bad thing about most guys is that although women are materialistic, deceitful, etc.  Most guys aren;t much better.  I have a manager I work with who has been dicked around by her ex husband so many times its sick, she has three kids and doesnt pay for anything or even health insurance.  What the fuck is this crap?  Thats bullshit, sure maybe you hate your ex wife but your own kids?  Why do that to them?  Why put them through this shit?  Anyway my cousin's husband was dealing and doing drugs in their house and would take all of her money and his to buy and sell dope, he has also decided to give her the royal fuck in the ass because he spent their entire savings account gambling and owes some dude like 500k.   So after lying to her throughout her entire marriage, he has taken all of her money and has fucked over his own kids. Their divorce has been funny, dude has taken back everything he said he gave his word to.....just another pile of lying shit.  She only married the fucker because she got knocked up by him, which is HER FAULT......but to have to deal with this is beyond horrible and I feel bad for anyone who has to deal with this type of shit. As they say in Germany ""Wot a crap"".

I'm out like the integrity of the world.

"event","Too much bullshit is happening all at once, they say that ""Hell is the impossibility of reason"" well my life is hell, although sometimes I can put a smile on my face, its a very fake smile, because deep down I just have too many issues.  I am at the point where people's feelings are no longer relevent to me, I couldn't care less if someone thinks I am a dick, I couldn't care fucking less if I hurt anyone by changing the way I have.  What has happened to me and what is happening to me has completely changed me as a person.  I don't consider anyone my friend, maybe 2 or 3 people tops, but thats it.  In about a week and a half or possible as soon as next thursday or friday I will find out for sure if shit will hit the fan.  After that I will go into detail of all thats happened to me.....trust me what is happening is horrifying.....on top of all the lying big mouthed untrustworthy drug addicted monkeyfucking cum guzzling assholes who keep fucking with me.  Ok well I am out for now.

"event","It is really a shame, one of if not the oldest car company in the USA is now gone.  GM's decision to get rid of olds was a stupid one.  Oldsmobiles didnt even have the lowest sales in the company, Buick did, and olds was making money again, hell all of the divisions have been making money, even Buick who's sales have dropped 3 or 4 years ago and started to go up again.  This is stupid, Oldsmobile's were a very unique line in GM.  The cars had a higher quality about them and had traits no other division in GM had.  First off, they had the best leather interiors.....don't know why this was, but a different company did all of the leather for oldsmobile which lasted longer and was more durable then even leather found in Cadillac's.  My Eighty Eight's leather intwerior is almost 10 years old and its in excellent condition, same with my dad's 92 Toronado Trofeo.  What a shame.

It was a crazy night last night at rehearsal, and re arranging the basement so it is arranged how it is on stage.  Its gonna rain like a fucking week.....fuck that, this shit is like being in Hamburg when the sun shines once a month.

Got the new WASP, AINA, Vision Divine, Nocturnal Rites, Brainstorm, and Ayreon albums in my cd player right now.....all of these bands rock like fucking hell!

I've been a dick lately to many people, sometimes for no reason and sometimes for every reason in the world.

Went this morning to check out that house in columbia station......and its beautiful....problem is I noticed a crack in the foundation the size of the san andreas....so looks like Im not buying that thing.  However I am going to check out another house next week in columbia station, this time 5 mins from where I live now.  So we'll see what happens, Id like to live in columbia station, its close to work, isolated from all the world, yet close enough to civilization (if that makes sense), I also cant wait to hear this shit mixed....oh my god.

The girl who stole all that money........shes been charged with grand larceny.

And the other bitch who called me ugly before....yeah shes dating like a 500lb black guy now who just cheated on her.  Hahahahaha and now she actually tried calling me, I quickly pressed ""END"" on my phone, and deleted her fucking message without listening to it, yeah fuck that dumb cunt.

Watched the movie Platoon the other night.....damn fine movie....I love how Johnny Depp is like a 17 or 18 year old kid in that movie.

I have done nothing but burn cds today for my radio show.  I will be done with that show in August.

We're getting our album mix and what I am hearing is with only 3000 dollars worth of recording equipment the guy who is mixing our album said that he couldn't have tracked the songs better himself.  That the raw recordings were extremly high quality and he shit when we told him that we did it with a small 1000 digital mixer and under 3k worth of gear.  So far its sounding great and shit is taking off for us so fast its sick!

Just got myself another shipment from Alta Mira, Neil always hooks a brotha up.

I;ve noticed my focus with the band also has carried over to work, I am more focused at what needs to be accomplished at my job and getting more shit done now than I ever have in 4 years with the company.  Ok im out, i'm ""finis"" as they say in French.

"event","Events in my life as of the last three days have taken their toll on me.  My life has hit an all time low and an all time high at the same time (damn what an oxymoron).  Lets start with the good first....

Saturday were two of our best shows ever.  Especially at the Odeon, in which I was at my most fluent on stage.  I am a completely different person on stage, in my own completely different world, and I feel higher than the sky for the hour and fifteen minutes we play.  It was so killer and after the show I was so completely hyper after busting my ass with these guys from 8am to 12:30 at night......it was insane playing two shows in one day but we did it and worked our ass off to do it.  We overcame a shitload of obstacles while at the same time going higher and higher on the ladder of success as we continue to impress not only the press but people who have no clue who we are.  We are moving upward at such a fast rate its sick.  WMMS has completely started to throw support our way the last month or so, WMMS is a station that helped make many bands, including Bruce Springstein for example.

On the negative side, what I just wrote above is the only thing thats really positive in my life.  The events of the last three days which I will keep silent for now have really changed me as a person, some people I used to hold dear to my heart really betrayed me in a way that cannot be forgiven.  All of this shit started Saturday night after our show.......its not anyone in the band so dont get that idea.  The shit I just dealt with has really carved out a massive gap of hate inside of me that seems will never end.  I trust almost nobody, I have no faith in humanity, and my life has very little meaning to me anymore to the point where it doesn't matter to anyone if Im alive or dead and to the point where I have nothing to lose now.  Morbid as fuck eh?  I guess to quote Iron Maiden ""Hell ain't a bad place, hell is from here to eternity"".  Thats what my life feels like right now and in case you are wondering, I am listening to Fear of The Dark by Maiden right now :).  Anyway back on the subject..............

The last three years have been extremly brutal to me.  I have lost many friends either by being screwed over, or they died.  I have been fucked over more times than I have had phone calls it seems.  I trust very few people and trust no women what so ever.....they all lie PERIOD.  The last of any confidence I have in dating anyone has been wiped away.  The last two girls I met seemed interested then said I was an ugly fuck and well wouldnt date me,and other people have made various comments towards me in that same vein in the last month or so which has really hurt me.  Go figure.....anyway....There are very few people I can even be nice to or civil to anymore.  This is a disturbing thing to me as I must explore my thoughts and figure out what the fuck I need to do.  I feel so hateful right now, black, blacker than the ace of spades.....it's like all a horrible nightmare that doesn't seem to end.  I have slowly started to become the nightmare I did not want to become.  I remember being 16 years old and saying to myself ""I do not want to turn out to be the hateful person that many people in my family have become, I am better than that"".  Well.....I don't know now, I do not know whether I am anymore.  I don't know if I can deal with the magnitude of what has been happening lately.  I have come to the conclusion that I am an outcast, a reject, or whatever other adjective you can come up with.  I dont have any real friends (at least in the usa), I'm a social reject, and a male reject among women.  I have also come to the conclusion that I am not a good person anymore, I am not the good hearted person I used to be, after these last three days and after the multiple times of being fucked with, any good in my heart is gone and any hope I had is now gone, and when there is no hope, there is no life.  I have lost all hope in humanity I guess you could say.  I think when I die, it will not be of any disease, it will notbe of age, but it will be of lonliness, the same thing people stranded on islands back during the imperial age died of.

I have this constant rage built up in me, which as funny as this is, it makes me perform better on stage.....how fucked up is that?  Something so negative can be positive.....I guess as King Edward the Longshanks said in Braveheart ""As king, you must find the good in any situation"".  Thats about the only good in my life, everything else just fucking sucks.  I have become a very horrible person and I wish I never have become as selfish and as cruel as I am now.

On a lighter note.....Here are my top 10 albums of the week:

1.  Axxis - VooDoo Vibes - Like every band out there, this is the experimental album by Axxis and it's also the album that got them dropped off of EMI.  Overall it is not as experimental as you would think however it does add some new elements to this band which would later be carried on to their next three albums and really add to them.  I had to pay out the ass in Euros on amazon.de to get this album and some other past Axxis releases so it was worth it though.

2.  Iron Maiden - Fear of the Dark - I don't know why in the fuck I began to listen to this album but I have listened to it nonstop for hours at a time this week.  This was one of those albums by Maiden I did not get til later on in high school, like my junior year in 1994-1995.  However It's impact on me is still there, I still like it as much as I did when I was 15 or 16.

3.  Slayer - South Of Heaven - Lets go back to high school yet again!  I used to listen to Slayer a lot back in the day, and after 1994 when Divine Intervention came out I lost interest in the band since this album is one of the most horrible releases I have ever heard with the exception of the first song.  That album and that shitty punk covers album were the low point for Slayer intil Diabolus on Musica came out.  Anyway South of Heaven was the second slayer album I ever heard and bought (The first was Hell Awaits) and this is actually the very first time since high school I have listened to it!  Last time I heard this album was back during my senior year of high school, during football season in the fall of 1995.  So 9 years later,  pop this bad boy in and WOW, what the fuck have I been smoking?!  I can;t believe I havent listened to this record in this long of time.  bLeH...SLAYER!

4.  Pink Cream 69 - Food For Thought - I dont know what the fuck it is about this album but even though PC69's new one is great this album seems to keep attracting me.  It's simplistic yet one of the best records i have ever heard.

5.  Grip Inc. - Incorporated - I keep listening to this album when I am angry (which is all the time! ha!).  Endowment of Apathy reminds me of a lot of lazy people I either work with or have worked with.

6. Ayreon - The Human Equation - Like every fucking Ayreon album, it takes me awhile to get used to the record, this album is strange as fuck but its cool.....I'll update later on it.

7.  WASP - The Neon God Part 1 - WASP, and Blackie Lawless as much of a dick as people say he is, he is one of the most gifted songwriters and musicians I have ever come across.  Hes actually a darker person than I.

8.  Labyrinth - Sons of Thunder - Olaf Thorsen's last album with this band, although at the time it came out I thought it sucked, a few years later I like it now.  

9.  Halford - Resurrection - This is one of the most bad ass albums I have ever heard not only production wise but songwise.  Damn!

10.  Axxis - The Big Thrill - Total 80s sounding metal with a german touch.  This album sounds very commercial one song then heavy as fuck and non commercial the next, its strange!

Heh, there is a band name called ""HIV and the Positives"".....jesus christ we have some heartless fuckers out there :)

Thats all for now.  I'm out like the Gene Simmons tongue magazine.

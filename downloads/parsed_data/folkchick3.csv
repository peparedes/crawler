"event","Today I made three new friends while waiting in line at Panera for my food to be ready. There was Katherine, who is 79 years old, wears bright green and purple every day and celebrates her birthday every single day of her birthday month. There was Barbara, who got fussed at by her church because she didn&rsquo;t finish folding the bulletins on time because some strangers showed up to the church and she believes that &ldquo;fellowship is more important than folding&rdquo;. Then there was Sarah. Barbara met Sarah on a bench at the beach when she was sitting and enjoying the sunset. As she stood up to go, a parrot (this story is true!) flew down and landed on the edge of the bench, and started saying over and over &ldquo;Sarah! Sarah! Where&rsquo;s Sarah!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well who the heck is Sarah?&rdquo; Barbara wondered aloud. &ldquo;Why dear, that would be me.&rdquo; came a voice from about the height of her elbow. Turning, she found a tiny little woman with a great big smile, the parrot now sitting on her shoulder. She was ninety-two years young with a twinkle in her eye, serene as the sunset and wearing all the colors of the rainbow. They have been friends ever since. I love these three, and want to put them in a book. It will be called &ldquo;Songs in the Rainbow Choir&rdquo; and there will be a parrot and three sassy angels on the cover. What a wonderful world."

"event","It is certainly something else, entering this full immersion, all-in writer experience...not that I am complaining! Before it was writing. Now it is writing, cover design, learning to format, online presence, author blogging, websites, deadlines, editing, planning and scheduling.... intimidating and exhausting and exhilarating!
Though I think I may have words with the next person that says &quot;Are you enjoying not working anymore?&quot; to me.
They have no idea.
Today - purchase images and elements for covers and settle on a design for the first two novels.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Rework timeline to adjust for three books in series one coming out before addressing series two
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Begin to design author website(s)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- drink massive amounts of coffee at the cafe&#39; while wearing writerly spectacles and a noble expression
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - oh... and rehearse for next weeks music festival!"

"event","The library where I went to write while visiting in Connecticut was also wonderful. It had that glorious old fashioned feel, as if time was bustling on by outside it&#39;s tall glass windows, but inside the library the only journeys that mattered were those that traversed the endless miles between two hardbound covers.
Here is what it looked like ... but with SNOW!!! *grin*

"event","&nbsp;Taking a page from the lovely and incrdibly prolific <lj user=""seaheart"" /> , I have begun to rediscover the joy of writing in libraries. This is not to say that the coffee scented air of a frequenty visited Starbucks doesn&#39;t get my creative juices flowing... but there is something inherently delicious about libraries; places built for imagining, journeys and learning, towering shelves of books rising on all sides , stories of the past spine by spine with newborn creations while the whispers of a thousand, thousand authors breathe in the dust of the past and exhale it&#39;s dreams into the future. Sunbeams in tall glass windows, the smell of ink and binding, the muted hush of people enamored of words and stories getting lost in books and hoping no one saves them. Magic. &nbsp;I grew up in a library. Oh, I did not live there, of course, I lived a maybe a mile &nbsp;up the road, but I visited that lovely little brick edifice as often as possible (every day, in summer!) and used my clearly enchanted, powerful, mystical library card (back then they we made of PAPER! Mine was yellow....) to bring pieces of the library home with me for a &nbsp;visit. I loved the sound of my feet on the rubber treads of the wooden stairs (the children&#39;s department was on the second floor), the thud of that rubber stamp decreeing return dates in the back of each book (Oh how I wanted one of those! Almost as much as I wanted to be a Librarian. Placing books in people&#39;s hands for a living, could there be a more glorious and honorable endeavor?) I remember the weight of the heavy door as I pulled it with all my strength to open it, the art classes and story hours, the bright bulletin boards and summer reading contests (I almost always won!), the high ceiling and tiled floor of the foyer as I was granted entry to this magical place that rested ten feet (and a billion light years) from the everyday world outside it&#39;s windows.&nbsp;Sorcery.
This was my childhood library...

The library where I write now is beautiful. Upscale and modern, sleek and graceful, with spectacular views and brass and glass and graceful architechtural symmetry. But though it is beautiful, though it is modern, state of the art, well stocked and well attended, there will always be something missing... the thud, perhaps, of that rubber stamp, the creak of old wooden floorboards, the dusty smell of forgotten literature waiting to be rediscovered by another generation of eager, wide eyed readers...
It is not that I am not I &nbsp;grateful. Grateful for Google and landscaping and bountiful parking and elevators and air conditioning and complimentary high speed internet... but some days, most days, today, right this moment, I would trade it all for that little red brick library I remember, a magical, vintage, larger than life steamer trunk filled with paper bound miracles, there to borrow for the asking. It wouldn&#39;t be hard to find it; it still sits on Main street in small town USA, right around the corner from Oz and Avonlea and Narnia.

"event","Over new years I went to Connecticut to visit <lj user=""elfinecstasy"" /> and had a wonderful time! It was actually cold, and I (fresh from an eighty-five degree Christmas in Florida...ugh!) spent the week getting excited every time the temperature dropped, and crunching through every pile of snow I came across, no matter how small. I got brave by the end of the week and drove the car that had been kindly loaned to me, and spent a delicious evening in the local library editing the current manuscript while <lj user=""elfinecstasy"" /> was working. I wandered up and down &quot;main street&quot; Manchester (literally) and bought a vintage bowler hat in an eccentric and eclectic shop where I spent a full thrity minutes just chatting with the woman who worked there. <span style=""line-height: 19.6px;"">So much of my time in Connecticut was spent doing just exactly that; talking, sharing, listening, connecting... not only with <lj user=""maerie_grace"" /> and <lj user=""elfinecstasy"" /> and her wonderful family, but with people I met in shops and on walks, in libraries and on sidewalks, everyone on their own journey. </span>One of the great pleasures I am beginning to appreciate since leaving my (stressful) job is taking the time to just talk to people. Cashiers, waitresses, people on the street. I&#39;ve had so many fascinating conversations with interesting people just by slowing down long enough to smile, to talk, to listen. People are filled with stories; walking, living,breathing stories, just wandering around out there waiting to be told, to be articulated, to be heard. It amazes me, truly, realizing what we miss as we hurry through our busy lives... and I was more guilty than most. I scarcely managed to find time to listen to my own stories. I feel as if I have been reborn. Peoploe are so extraordinary.
I don&#39;t have many pictures from the visit of wonderful... but here are a few.

This afternoon/evening, I have rehearsal for the Pinellas Folk Festival, which is on January 30th. Michaele and I (who have been singing together for years upon years) have added a third member to our group, and I am so excited about what Randi is bringing to the table. Besides brilliant harmonic instincts, she has a great sense of humor and an exquisite voice, perfect for the Irish and Scottish songs we will be performing. Having been out of touch with Randi for literally more than ten years, it has been so exciting to reconnect with her and renew our friendship. This new life of mine has proven strange and wonderful - traveling in new directions and spreading my wings and at the same time reconnecting (there&#39;s that word again!) with the real and true and intrinsic parts of who I used to be.

Spent the morning at a four hour training event during which I was (for the first time in a long time) not teaching. It was...weird.

As soon as it was announced, Undria (a gal I&#39;d worked with seven or so years ago at the Saint Petersburg YMCA) yelled out &quot;Where&#39;s Ruth? C&#39;mon girl, let&#39;s get up and teach this thing!&quot; to which of course I yelled back &quot;I&#39;M ON IT! GET ME SOME CRAYONS!&quot; (I am nothing if not good on the fly!) Sadly, though, the sick instructor had stayed home with all the art supplies, so we had nothing to work with. &nbsp;Instead I attended a workshop on utilizing local farmers markets as resources for healthy cooking projects for children <lj user=""songtoisis"" /> and <lj user=""razzle"" />, I thought of you!) After that it was music and storytelling for Pre-schoolers , wherein I objected loudly to the instructors offhanded remark that it wasn&#39;t that important to talk about storytelling (What? Oh NO she didn&#39;t!) followed by the inevitable and obligatory state rules and regs/laws and legislation portion of the training. Now I am home and thinking about a nap. And storytelling.

She is scholarly, nicely dressed and well groomed, fairly serious but pleasant and clearly intellectual, with the kind of glasses that make you look even smarter than you are. She conducts research in heavy leather bound volumes, remains focused despite the lure of the internet, pauses to ponder what are clearly deeply philosophical conundrums and probably can turn a pretty phrase faster than Emily Dickenson. She has a spreadsheet, and post it notes,&nbsp; diagrams and outlines (&ldquo;circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back&hellip;.&rdquo;), and she sits in literary silence, where she types serenely, composes thoughtfully and apparently does not tear her hair, gnash her teeth or rend her garments in the search for perfect metaphors and elusive descriptives. &nbsp;I peeked over her shoulder yesterday when I passed behind her and I am pretty sure she is probably writing the Great. American. Novel.

&nbsp;I on the other hand, arrive at the library with a sticker emblazoned, battered laptop, licorice bears and cheddar bunnies hidden in my purse, and my headphones tuned to Abney Park, Eric Bazilian and Frenchy and the Punk. &nbsp;I open my computer bag to a rush of trapped Starbucks scented air, spend forty minutes leaving smart aleck comments on Facebook before I get around to opening the current manuscript file, buy all my flash drives in bright jewel toned colors (and then lose them), scrawl bits of dialogue on the backs of my hands while driving (lest I forget them), and dress pretty much as one might expect with Steam punk, Stevie Nicks, Jane Austen and the lead singer from Coldplay as style icons. I am scattered. I am disorganized. I am colorful and erratic and ecstatically creative&hellip; I have also written&nbsp; eight novels, a novel length web serial, two one act plays, a novella, several short stories and &nbsp;the proverbial &ldquo;rowth o&rsquo; rhymes&rdquo; since 2010.

In the words of Robert Burns: &ldquo;good workmen never quarrel with their tools.&rdquo;

"event","This morning when I went to the library to write (my usual morning occupation) I discovered two things.

The first was that of the three ladies working on the outdoor garden just before the library opened, one loved to sing and was happily doing so at the top of her voice, caring less than nothing about who heard her do it. I was snoozing in the car (I do this) with the windows down and a cool, rain scented breeze lulling me into a relaxed (pre-writing) state, and I dozed off and dreamed I was at the Renaissance Festival (where, I can assure you, I took many, many naps to the sound of distant singing!) but when I woke up (I actually have an alarm set on my phone that reads &quot;Library Opens!&quot;) I discovered the voice I had heard singing was actually this woman crouched in the garden with her hands in the soil and her voice raised to the clouds. It was kind of a beautiful thing.

The second thing I discovered (upon stretching and climbing out of the car) was&nbsp;that the local Friday morning writers group (which I have been threatening to join for ages) was meeting in a room off of the children&#39;s wing in... oh...five minutes ago, and I hung my head in self imposed shame. I felt trapped by my own intentions, guilty for not going in, busted by my own brash bragging that I was going to &nbsp;attend &quot;one of these days&quot;.... &nbsp;I did not actually make it through the door - they had already started and I felt funny walking rudely in in the middle (&quot;Hi! You don&#39;t know me but I&#39;m here to crash your writer party!&quot;) but I eavesdropped outside the window shamelessly for a few minutes. There was a man in there reading from one of his work-in-progress, and he had a lovely reading/speaking voice; deep and resonant with expression and a pleasant, rhythmic cadence. The idea of the group (apparently) is sharing your writing and being offered polite, helpful constructive criticism (polite, helpful constructive criticism makes me cry) in a group setting (yeah, that&#39;s me, over there, hiding behind the Caldecott winners on the third tall shelf, pretending to read &quot;Corduroy&quot; and &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; in Spanish....). I think it is possible that I might actually have made it in the door after a few minutes of hemming and hawing (Oh look! And here are the Newberry Winners on this OTHER tall shelf over here....Did you know Neil Gaiman&#39;s Graveyard Book won in 2009? I did.) but over by the childrens circulation desk a burly man and his loud voiced assistant were assembling metal shelves for DVD&#39;s, and the metal to metal hammer blows drove me away after five minutes with my hands over my ears. It really was hideously loud in the middle of a LIBRARY... and didn&#39;t they&nbsp;&nbsp;know I was trying to eavesdrop? Hmmmph.

&nbsp;I will not attend the writers group next Friday morning either (for those of you that are wondering) because I have work meetings all morning, but the Friday after that? Well... who knows.

Anything is possible."

"event","Quite without meaning to, I seem to have taken a four month sabbatical from live journal, in the process breaking my own avowed intention to NOT become &ldquo;one of those facebook&nbsp; people&rdquo;. &nbsp;I my defense, I left live journal &nbsp;(as usual) at the end of October in order to do National Novel writing month in November (the thirty day/50,000 word challenge leaving less time for journaling in any case) but somehow I just never got back on the live journal horse (so to speak) and I find myself regretting that. I miss hearing what all of you are up to, seeing your pictures, hearing your thoughts, connecting with you&hellip; so I am going to try to be a better blogger (bad blogger, no cookie!)

I am, of course, still writing. The (last) novel was finally finished at 157,000 words and I am now 70,000 words into the sequel, and have the next sequel already in the works (since this is apparently <strike>doomed </strike> <b>destined</b> to become a series, eh <lj user=""elfinecstasy"" />?) This &ndash; I have just realized, means I have written 227,000 words since July (along with another 6000 words of random short story) which actually isn&#39;t too damn shabby, is it? I am also editing my 2012 novel (Whispers on the Windowsill) and engaging in several other bits of literary endeavor, bolstered by enthusiastic support from <lj user=""elfinecstasy"" /> and <lj user=""razzle"" /> .&nbsp; All in all, there is much writing afoot. In the meantime, how are all of you? I am going to try (first) to catch up and then (second) keep up with live journal, and can&rsquo;t wait to hear how everyone is and what you are up to (though I know for a fact a lot of you are busy shoveling snow!)

You would think I&#39;d have learned this lesson last semester, when the final-exam-of-apocalyptic-proportions required the speed reading, flash learning and frantic study of THIRTEEN CHAPTERS OF MATERIAL IN ONE WEEK, because I spent the entire second half of the semester playing that little trick.

"event","<div>So there I was, sitting at Panera writing a novel (as one does &hellip;) and at the next table but one was a lady working on something of her own to the strains of music, just like me. She was interesting, in a quiet way; soft energy, centered and peaceful and a gentle way about her. Wrapped up in my characters, my own music and my story, I glanced her way while searching the horizon for the perfect word (as you do&hellip;) and we exchanged smiles. Two hours later, she rose to leave, and stopped by my table to hand me a scrap of paper.</div><div>&ldquo;I would like for you to see my painting&rdquo; she said in a soft voice, handing me a neatly printed scrap with an internet address written on it. <span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">&ldquo;If you have a moment in your day&hellip;&rdquo;</span></div><div>With that, she was gone.</div><div>I went to the page on my laptop then, as she left and drove away, and there she was in the photo, same open, gentle face, same quiet way, same sweet smile. And her painting was in the photo with her, a dandelion; &nbsp;its graceful lines and lovely colors a reminder of the days when things like falling stars and dandelion wishes were the kind of magic that I could hold in the palm of my hand.</div><div>I don&rsquo;t know how she knew that I had forgotten, that I no longer wished on dandelions or falling stars or threw pennies into wishing wells&hellip; but somehow, some way, she knew that I needed to remember.</div><div>And I did.</div><div>I wish that I could thank her.</div><div>Perhaps the best way to thank her is to never forget again.

</div><div>I have been so busy that I have not had time to write here very much, and what time I&#39;ve had for writing I&#39;ve been using to try to keep up my camp NaNoWriMo word count. Until yesterday, that is, when I crashed and burned after pushing myself for twelve hour days for over a week. Yesterday and today I have mostly slept and sat on the couch&hellip;
</div><div>The play that my theatre camp kids put on this Friday (Puss in Boots) was a great hit &ndash; the parents loved it and the kids were SO excited! &nbsp;They are already begging to begin the next play! I, however, am taking Monday &ldquo;off&rdquo; to do &ldquo;camp things&rdquo; with them (you know, like swimming and games and camp songs!) before we jump right back in to another play. Then, auditions on Tuesday for &ldquo;The Storyteller and the Sultan&rsquo;s Son&rdquo;! 
</div><div>I absolutely LOVE doing theatre camp, and intend to beg for this assignment every summer for the rest of my life.</div><div>In writerly news &hellip; although I&rsquo;ve slowed down a GREAT deal (mostly thousand word days for the past few, with two zero word days thrown in on the dress rehearsal and Performance days for &ldquo;Puss in Boots&rdquo;) progress still is steady, and I am ahead of schedule by 5,418 words, a lead I have been able to maintain (give or take) despite my two non-writing days.

"event","I am inside the air conditioning working on my novel while my husband does yard work outside in Florida in July.
I&#39;m kinda OK with that.

Also? 

Sadie is on probation and is not allowed unsupervised visits with the real world as she is no longer to be trusted, so I am attempting to knock out at least three thousand words today at my desk, with a crazy chihuahua tied to my ankle.

Literally. With string.

In other news, I spilled half a bottle of Patchouli oil on myself in the bathroom this morning, so now I smell like an incense burning hippie folksinger creative writer type.  
I&#39;m kinda OK with that as well.

And now I am going to put on my headphones and drown out the sound of the lawn mower with the sound of Josh Groban. 
And I am SO very OK with that as well.

It&#39;s a good day."

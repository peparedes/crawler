"event","Well the saga continues with James' sister MaryAnn.  It has been over 7 months since she went back to Regina, thinking she can look after herself.  Well in the last few months, she has been harrassing my daughters, demanding stuff that was sold to care for her, and harassing them.  My next step is to call the police and have her charged.  I don't want to do that, but she is leaving me no choice, she is yelling at minors on the phone, and being very beligerent.
   Just needed to vent, I am so upset over this."

Tradionally known as a ""siren"", ""rake"", or ""femme fatale."" You exude sensuality.
And while your sexiness is part of what makes you an incredible seducer...
Your ability to make others feel sexy is what really makes your seduction skills shine.

Most people don't feel attractive or desired enough - a need which you tap into.
You have the ultimate sex appeal, and getting attention from you is a total self esteem boost.
Your confidence is contagious, and you help others unleash their own sexuality.

Your sex pot seduction skills are so intoxicating that you can get away with... well, almost murder.
Lovers feel like your sensuality is in your blood, so it's only natural if you flirt a little.
And if you stray, that might be okay as well - as long as you make your lover still feel hot.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>"

"event","Well, lately I have been plagued with memories of what 'was'.  I can't seem to shake the feeling that everything was better in the past, and I keep trying to get back there.  I remember being happier in the past, especially before the HIV.  Isn't is interesting how we remember past experiences as happier than we did while we were living them.  I know there is a lot of shit in the past, and not everything looks better in the past, but actually some things are best left in the past.  And I am starting to learn that I need to leave the past where it is. Gone.  I am not saying we need to forget the past, just the opposite, we need to remember it, and all we have learned from life.  I just have to stop trying to get back what was.  Life changes us, it has changed me.  I am starting to realize I am not the same man I was 7 years ago, or even a year ago.  I am changed by lifes experiences, and to go back to the way I was, would deminish all I have accomplished and learned.  Life is full of gains and losses, and in order to gain something new, we need to loose something.  That is how I have found life to be.  However we don't really loose them, we have just moved on, and no longer need them.  To make a long rabbit trail short, I am realizing I have been living in the past, pre-HIV.  I want things back the way they once were, but that can never happen.  I need to accept that and move on.  They say hindsight is 20/20, and it is true, because as you go through life you are constantly learning something new, and experiencing something new.  If we all went back to 'the way it was', life would be a boring rerun of a bad soap opera.  One of the reasons that I hold onto the past so hard is that the future looks so dark, unknown.  The future to me is like a black hole, with no light.  They say when you are dead, that you should 'walk toward the light' to get to heaven or someplace better.  To give into the darkness would be to give into eternal death.  I need to realize that there is a light at the end of this dark tunnel called the future.  I need to walk toward the light if I want to live life, or I can just let the darkness consume me, continue being the walking dead, and long for what was, but can never again be.  The future can be a dark scary thing, or can be full of new experiences and excitement.  I need to stop holding on to what was, and start looking forward to what could be.  There are so many possibilities, and by dwelling on the past, I am letting opportunities slip through my fingers.  I am walking through life, looking over my shoulder at what was, and tripping over what could be.  Is it any wonder I feel like I am being hurt all the time?  In order to walk forward in life, I need look ahead at what could be.  As I am writing this I am remember a story of how a chicken can only walk forward, they can not walk backward, or they will fall over.  So I guess what I am saying, is I want to be a chicken.  (I want to walk forward in life, with out looking behind me all the time)  Lets hear it for the chickens, hip hip HORAAY, hip hip HORAAY, hip hip HORAAY!!

  Our quitting smoking is going a little better with the girls gone.  It is less hectic and easier to handle.  This is pathetic to say, but I don't think I make that great a father, when I can only handle kids for so lone.  Then I get stressed, not good.  But I am trying.  Anyhow, we are in week 3 of no smoking, and I can't wait till we don't need the patch anymore.  We bummed a smoke this afternoon, oh, gross.   I had one drag and made James finish it.  I am glad we finally quit, I have been after James to do this for a long time.  Iam already feeling better for it, even my pot smoking doesn't choke me up as much, and I for some reason have needed less pot.  Which is great and a big help on the pocket book.

"event","Well after a very fantastic 10 days with my daughters, they are off and on their way home.  I am waiting to hear if they land ok, but I am trusting they will... but won't stop worrying till they call, thats a papa's perogative.  I have to say this is the best visit we have ever had with them.  I am so happy about that, my moods were very stable, with no fighting bewtween James and I, and only a couple minor loss of control over something the kids did.  I quickly regained control and apologized, then carried on.  It was great.... things are definitely much better since getting on proper meds, and a proper diagnosis.  However we obviously didn't pick a good time to quit smoking as we got a little cranky, and gave in and bought some smokes while the girls were here.  But 3 packs in 10 days as opposed to 30 that we were doing, I think we did pretty damn good.  We were blonde today, though, and forgot our patch, so are smoking more than we should till we get home (still in chilliwack for a bit), but will try again tomorrow, and will put on the patch as soon as we get home, we are still quitting, just a little set back, thats all.
OH boy am I exhausted!! The girls certainly succeeded in tiring us out big time.  We are sitting at the office but hopefully can go home early so we can get some much needed sleep."

I am very much enjoying having them here, am sad it is already half over, but we will try to get them out again in the summer, so all is good.  We havn't done anything major with them except get them hooked on Heroes, heehee... we have watched every single episode that is out and are waiting hard for next weeks...  I also started watching this cartoon called ""the robot chicken"", it is hilarious, not for kids, but my daughters think it is hilarious (good thing they don't actually get half the humour).  They have come to work with us a few times and have been real good.  We are going swimming with them tomorrow, and on monday, we are taking them shopping and doing a scavanger hunt.  Somewhere this weekend I need to take Chantal and teach her how to parralell park before she goes home so she can get her license when she gets back.  Wednesday, we are finishing off Christmas shopping, and taking them out for one last major supper.  Thurs before they fly out we will do a Christmas morning and a brunch.  I am hoping we can keep from fighting too much before they leave, heehee, but kids will be kids.

"event","After many many many many many (2 to be exact) the snow and cold (-10) is gone.  Whew, I hate snow, one reason I left Sask.  I guess one can never escape, heehee.  Oh well all things considered, no power, frozen pipes, burst hot water tank, frozen pump house so no water, we did pretty good surviving in this little trailer.  But I am very thankful to see blue skies and the sun again.  I dont mind the rain, in the warmer weather.  

As for 'work', and yes I use that word loosely.  We have been helping Devon out now for several months.  In one way it pays to help, in another it doesn't.   I volunteer to do the office stuff and dispatching, and James drives (which brings in a little coin but not much), especially when you consider the amount of hours (more than full time, which is burning us both out) we have put in.  James and I discussed this and the effects on our health the stress it has put on us with the extra hours and decided we are cutting back on the amount we are helping out, and setting our own hours.  We figure if he wants our help, he will accept whatever we give even if it is controled.  So we are now only helping part time.  However I have to mention the benefits are not that bad.  Along with the litte bit of coin James brings in driving, Devon has provided him a car (small shit box of a sprint but it runs), to help us get around since our van is off the road (another story).  Plus he just bought another car ($100 Mercury Topaz), so I can get around a little easier and get out of the office occasionally, or stay home while james is driving or to help out driving occasionally.  So we can't complain too bad we are still being taken care of is some ways.

As for the van, a little rabbit trail.  The insurance ran out in November and has been off the road since.  We have been looking into what it will take to transfer over to here, and the amount of work that the van actually needs is not worth the hassle and expense.  So we decided to junk it and just drive what Devon gives us for now.  If all falls through helping him, then we loose the cars too, which is ok, we will work it out from there, but we don't see it falling through anytime soon.  Nothing is permanant in life, it is all temporary.  A lesson we have been learning the hard way this last year.

We are still hoping to have the girls here in February.  It didn't work out at Christmas as planned, so are planning for Feb.  Unfortunately we need to book flights in the next week or so and we still don't have enough to do it.  we are still a few hundred short.  Not sure how we are going to do it, but I am going to stay positive and believe that it will work out.

Health wise we are both doing fine, well as fine as can be anyhow.  James' MRI turned out normal, as did all our other base line testing.  However we seemed to have picked up an intestinal bug.  We have been having trouble for a couple months, and the drs are still working on the cause.  Is draining some of our energy, especially with go go go as we normally do.  But again, it will all work out, just a temporary speed bump in life.

It sounds odd in a strange way, but as much as I miss the way things used to be, I am kinda glad for the ""starting over"" phase that unintionally has begun.  One of the things that depresses me most about christmas, is everyone giving gifts all around, even to me.. but I can't afford to give back.  This year we dont' know enough people to do that for us, as much as I do appreciate those who have given to us in the past and still do, and I appreciate the understanding that I can't afford to give back.  It can be hard not to dwell on the little things that make up the Christmas blues, but I am trying to see them for what they are, blessings.  Blessings that help me to understand a little more of what makes me tick.  I may be ticking in the wrong direction, thats when blessings help me to see that and change my direction.  This has definitely been a season of new beginnings, I just pray the Goddess will guide me the way through.
   ON a lighter note, we are going to have a quiet christmas eve at home at the trailer alone with our puppies.   Christmas day, we have been invited to our friends in Chilliwack for dinner.  We were going to stay overnight but decided we wanted some alone time for Christmas.  All is good.  James and I are going to enjoy some horsydourves and some RED wine and curl up and watch a movie.
    OOHH!!  The natural wonders of BC, and a GREEN Christmas.  I do not miss the cold and snow one bit.  That little arctic front we got in last month was enough of a reminder of Sask weather.  I much prefer the now, warmer, greener weather.  It may be wet but it is not cold and not snow.
   Well Merry Christmas EVERYONE!!!"

However, as always, I need not worry, they are content with coming out in during their February break, since Chantal has finals in January.  Soo, we discussed that I use the air miles I was going to use to fly them out to buy them a Nano.  They all liked that idea.  This all helped combat my blues and take some stress off of me.  They such awesome girls.
   So we are finally home for a couple days, alone.  What a concept being alone.  HeeHee  I am not complaining, they are great people that we hang with, is just nice to have our own space a little, that is not just eating and sleeping. 
   James is trying to help me get into the Christmas spirit, he bought a small living potted tree for the trailer, and decorated it.  Then put garland around the trailer.  It all looks pretty, it just still isn't quite right, maybe cause I don't look at the trailer as home, but as a stop over till we get an apt or house, which is a long way off yet..  :(  I know i need to change my thinking to a positive one.  I AM trying damnit. heehee
   Just a quick note about our puppies, what awesome dogs they are.  We are so proud of our newest girl.  When we first got her, she would run away all the time, and we couldn't catch her.  Brian was here at the time, and he chased her and chased her, and could only get her when she stopped to go poop.  NOW, she runs out the door, runs around watching us, does her business and comes back for scratches.  When she is overly hyper, we send Cain after her to wear her energy out, then she comes running back to us for protection from Cain, it is so cute."

I remember when we lived in saskatoon, last february, James tried to kill himself and ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks.  There was a drag show that weekend, and as much as I am all for ""the show must go on"", but I felt there was little to no supoort even when I opened my home to everyone to get ready and to stay night, despite what I was going through.   Yet here, I get a fever over 103 and need to be rushed to the hopital by friends. and then they kept James occupied so he wouldn' worry bout me till we found out exactly what was wrong, and bring down the fevers.  We have been nothhing but open and honest with our friends, we have nothing to hide, and finally we have some positve people around us that is there to help and support us just as much as we are there for them... we expectt they same from our friends that we ourselves are willing to give.
  Sorry for my rambleing, I just needed to get this off my chest....James and I have been through the ringer with this move, and have weathered the storms (some literal) quite well, and will continue to only surround ourselves with positive people that have the same agenda we do for a relationship.  That is to be there when the times are good and when the times are bad, with out judgement or bias...jsut true honest friendship..."

On Sunday it was 102.9, james was about to take me to emerg, when it dropped just as suddenly.  So I have been hovering on an average of 101 everyday.  Went to Emerg yesterday, and was checked for phneumonia, bacteral infections in blood, etc.  The dr was VERY thorough.  I was impressed for an emerg dr.  Anyhow, to make a long post short(not happening), I have an infection in my tonsils, AGAIN, I told them to take them out back in Saskatoon, but they wouldn't so here I am going through it all over again, just a bigger case of it this time.  So he gave me penicillin for that, and my chest xray was clear, but he didn't want to take any chance of PCP setting in with the current infection happening, so also is treating me for PCP.  Yeah more pills.  Good thing we don't really have a job or anything, I would keep loosing it.  Oh well, heehee....

Next story, Whilst at the hospital, well go back a bit, on the way to the hospital we picked up our regular Tim's fix.  Well the girls forgot the sugar.  So, whilst at the hospital, James went to the resident Tim's outlet in the hospital to get sugar.  On his way there a woman came up and assaulted him on her way to steal sandwiches etc.  An off duty police happened to be there and secure the situation, but got kicked in the balls in the process, he identified himself, James identeified himself as a retired private in vestigator (which he is), the cop said, go for it you know what your doing, USE FORCE.  It took 3 of them to take her down, and drag her out in cuffs.  James is ok, but was pretty shaken and his hip is a bit sore.  Man the wierdos out here, LOL We fit right in,..;.

Then to make the matters even worse, trouble always comes in 3's.... James blew the tranny on the car our friend gave us to use tilll our van is registered.  So now we got stranded in here in Chilliwack for yet another couple of days, with no wheels.... OH well, something good is going to come out of all this....

It turn out I do NOT have neuropathy, and the pain killers I was on for it was a waste of time and a waste of a year of my life......still working on what is going on...however in working with my depression and mood swings, it has come out attention (yesterday at docs to be exact) that I am bipolar.  yahoo, well Kat I know what you mean...lets chat.. oh by the way KAT & DAEL  thanks for getting cherise to babysit munchkin, she loves being there, and with out us there, she has no other queer influence...thanks....oh and we miss you guys lots... HUGS HUGS HUGS...(wipes tear)...so back to bipolar,... been reading lots since, and now realize why I ahve been the way I have been...doctor started me on drugs already(did that a couple weeks ago for depressive cycles).. they seem to be working..since diagnoses yesterday, I have a new drug to start for bipolar forget the name, is sitting at the pharmacy right now... but hopefully it will work... these major depressive cycles, and manic episodes are unmanageable....
   Apparetnly I am suppose to journal to help keep track of symptoms, and triggers... well the best journaling I can do is here....so lets see how commited I can be to writing here, and actually getting things off my chest.....   We have also been learning that we need a wellness plan put into effect to better manage our HIV so this will also help me better manage my bipolar.  We need to work on out nutrition habits, exercise habits, relaxation habits.  We are also slowly getting involved in the HIV advocacy movement here, so that gives us a chance to interact with other poz folk.  Now I just need to find others with bipolar that can help with peer suppot there.  But it will come."

"event","Well the countdown is on, it is Sunday, and James and I (Willie), and Brian, are heading down to Regina to pack up MA's house and get it ready for the Uhaul at 10 AM Monday morning.  There is a lot of stuff yet there to pack up, never mind what is still at the house here S'toon.  With any luck we will be having a bonfire on Monday night in S'toon, one last horaaahhh with my duaghters, I hope.  It keeps getting cancelled, and I have yet to spend the quality time with my daughters that I and they have needed for the last 3 months.  Arghhhh!!!!
    Anyhow the plan is to try and be out of S'toon by noon at the latest on Tuesday.  We will be heading to Consort Alberta as our fist stop to see our GREAT friend Lyle (Jake).  We will be staying there till Thursday morning first thing (the earlier the better), then heading west.  Not sure where we will be spending Thursday night but we should have that planned by Wednesday.  Actually I am hoping the rest of the trip will be planned out on Wednesday while chilling at Lyles.
     We are all looking forward to this move.  However we all have our fears and reservations about it all.  I personally am stressed out to the max about our finances, we just don't have enough money to do this, but here we are doing it.  I am afraid we are going to end up stranded somewhere with absolutly nothinhg to fall back on.  Plus I have HUGE issues about leaving my daughters behind.  I will miss them so much, I love spending time with them, and being able to see them anytime I want.  Now I can't, and what happens if I can't afford to fly them out to see me, or me back to see them.  I am loosing a huge part of my life and the reason that I have been able to keep going through all the tough times, they have been my source of strength and unconditional love..  Anyhow, words could never express what I am feeling, so no sense in trying I guess. (sigh!).  All I can say is that when I am sick and feel like crap the only thing that can even remotely make it feel ok, is a hug from one of them.  Because I know they are dong ti out love not obligation or pity.  I am going to miss the so so so so much.  (blows nose).
     This has been an extremely difficult last few months for me.  With it all starting with James trying kill himself in February, to MA's brain hemmorage, to the move, to having to care for MA and financially supporting Dave, Brian, and now MA.  The stress is way more than I can take, and I am having trouble holding it together......shit here I go whining again.....to to get a move on with the day, so we can actually going to Regina and get that packed up.  It is going to be a very long, long night.......
             Will post more tomorrow night when we get back to S'toon."

In Buddhism, there are Four Noble Truths: (1) Life is suffering. (2) All suffering is caused by ignorance of the nature of reality and the craving, attachment, and grasping that result from such ignorance. (3) Suffering can be ended by overcoming ignorance and attachment. (4) The path to the suppression of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path, which consists of right views, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right-mindedness, and right contemplation. These eight are usually divided into three categories that base the Buddhist faith: morality, wisdom, and samadhi, or concentration. In Buddhism, there is no hierarchy, nor caste system; the Buddha taught that one's spiritual worth is not based on birth.<br><br><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Buddhism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='71' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>71%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Christianity</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='67' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>67%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>agnosticism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='63' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>63%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>atheism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='63' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>63%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Paganism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='58' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>58%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Satanism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='54' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>54%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Islam</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='50' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>50%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Hinduism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='46' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>46%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Judaism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='42' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>42%</font></td></tr></td></tr></table><br><a href='http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=10907'>Which religion is the right one for you?

James spent 4 hours landscaping our back yard and putting in the pond again, has it filled, and a pump running in it, all we need is some feeder goldfish and we are all set.  still lots to do, need to find a tiller to the the garden real soon, so we can plant it when we come back from Radville May long weekend. Gotta get the green house cleaned out and operational, build lots of flower beds and rock gardens, for that we need to fine big rocks, and white gravel for the rock gardens, and around the pond.  Wow still tons of work to do.

     ON a seperate note, I am still planning on going to Regina step down, I have to, that is my kid up there.  So not sure how we are doing it yet..  I need a ride down friday, so James can work friday night and come down after.  Not sure where to stay either, as we have the dogs and James sister is talking bout coming up here that weekend, tho we can still use her house, which we always do anyhow.  Something will work out, I hope."

I went to the cafe with James, then put them on and took Cain for a ""ROLL"" through the part to see all the cute bois out playing in the sun.  That was a lot of fun, Cain certainly is learning how to behave in public, I am so proud of my puppy.   It was hilarious though, when he realized that if he pulled hard enough on the leash he could keep going, pulling me in tow.  He had great fun trying to take up the streets, I think I need to teach him the meaning of the word 'mush', might make a good sled dog.  heehee.  Anyhow, the great thing was that I saw my grandbaby down town.  So silly me decided to skate down the block and head staight for her to give her a big hug.  Well, I seemed to gain a little TOO much momentum.... AND .... SMASH.....we hugged all right, as well as tumbling and rolling on the ground in the process of me stopping...damn she has a hard knee, right in the middle of my left rib... OUCH.  Well all was fun till after rollerblading home, and laying down, then I couldn't get up, my ribs were so bruised I couldn't move..ended going to St Pauls and getting checked, they agreed just bruised, but gave me a shot of some super pain killer, it is NOT working.... nor is the pot OUCH OUCH OUCH....  any how, Keein, I hope YOU are ok, and sorry I made you fall head over heels in front of your friends.

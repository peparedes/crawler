"event","This summer has gone by so quickly that I still don't realize it's almost over. There's a month left and it feels like it just started, you know? I've been working between 35-40 hour weeks at the job and, I'm not going to lie, it doesn't make me feel mature, only tired. Atleast now my house is retiled and I'm not watching that smelly house (and the dogs) and thus I can sleep in past 7 am regularly. The moneys added up quickly and all things considered it was relatively painless.

Sunday I worked a 5 hour shift before the mall even opened, then i hung out with josh, went to dinner with crespo at chili's (Where, I discovered today, 4 days later, I left my wallet... I got my wallet and ID back but lost $50) and then played pictionary at megan's. Then I was suddenly overwhelmingly tired and promptly went home where I discovered my throat was sore and I had a hundred point something fever.

That said, except to go to the doctors office and on a few 5 minute excursions I havent left my house since then. I'm on medicine but I'm still feeling mighty crappy, and I don't know why, but my throat and I can never seem to get along.

But the negative aside, I'm exceedingly happy with everything right now. It's kind of a bummer that I havent seen anyone in awhile, but I don't think I'd have been much fun out and about anyway.

Tomorrow I'm flying to NYC to stay with my brother for the weekend. I hope I start to feel better. Soon. Now. Please?"

"event","This week:

I saw a movie in theatres for the first time in a long time. For free.
I worked a lot. Hard, too.
I broke in a pair of really cute shoes.
I bought a pair of tennis shoes.
I've been in contact with a few too many dogs.
I made myself jewelery.
I've been woken up at 7am for the crazy tile people every morning.
I went to the library.
I played a lot of guitar.
I have not eaten a home made meal once. Except a sandwich at Sean's house, if that counts.
I went to the high school.
I drove home a girl whom I did not know.
I had awkward conversations with my parents.
I went to the doctor.
I got stuff for college.

I've left out much more than I've told. Mostly so that whenever I talk about anything that's happened, you'll still want to listen."

We finsihed high school. We got sun burnt promptly thereafter. We graduation-rehearsed, then we (I, more accurately) nearly puked up 20 ounces of beef, but didn't. We all walked across stage without tripping. We played poker with chips in denominations of millions of pesos. Briefly, we were aliens and did some weeeeeeird stuff. We miraculously found my flip flops.

It's been decided that I'm going to Tufts. I'm excited; suddenly I'm getting college mail again, but this time it's all from the same school, the one I'm going to. It feels nice. Finally.

Josh is home.

"event","I haven't updated in awhile, which is justifiable, but also kind of sad because I'm almost positive I had a lot of important things to say.

Prom was amazing in its entirety. I literally loved every second and every song-- my humps, the electric slide, whatsitcalled from grease-- and every smile and every sip and every spill-- the salsa and the gatorade-- and every trip to the bathroom-- both other people's and my own. Granted I only have 10 pictures, but compiled with Lisa's and the others I'm expecting from all of you sometime soon, I'm pretty sure I will never forget how much fun it was.

Seriously, everything was perfect, or near enough, anyway. A blackeyed peas cd was in the limo's cd player by some miracle; dinner was delicious and relatively mess-free; and we made it to prom just in time to be admitted as VIP's via the coop, and hear the infamous My Humps followed by that annoying yet catchy booty (x's 5) song. Yeah, you know the one.

The hotel was equally enjoyable, and the other whs-er's there were fun, too. It was right on the beach, and after the rain stopped some of us went for a late night stroll to get a break from the 5 or 6 kids who were hiding in our room from a threatening security gaurd patrolling the hall near their rooms. After laughing at medoff, jordan, and 2 drunk boys, for their sad attempts at drunken pickups, i stayed up all night with zac and sean to see the sunrise.

The next day at the beach Garcia, Philip, and I swam down to Ocean Reef Park and Medoff lagged behind. We climbed on the rocks, but we didnt see any fish. After walking back and failing at finding crabs, we hung out at the pool. Eventually Adam, Medoff, Philip, Carlee, Garcia and I headed to lunch at Cheeburger, and then on home.

This week has been filled with sleep deprivation and Poetry Live and fun. PL went relatively well. Granted only what 8? of us do anything at all, but I'm kind of glad because I really like those 7 other people. Performing was really fun and so dancing on stage once it was all over and done with. I'm so glad it's finally over... yet, it's bitter sweet because everything is really finally over. High school ends in 9 days. 

Now comes studying for AP exams and the actual AP exams and that pathfinder thing and the last day of school and finishing my gold award paper work and more scholarship applications and more time at work and then graduation. Then what?

Sigh."

Friday my mom, my brother and I went to Tufts in the morning before going to meet Doug for lunch at Harvard and then going to BC. [Choices, choices. Eek.]

Then Josh met us somewhere just outside of downtown Boston and we all went to see the Bunker Hill monument at the request of my brother. [yes, it was as dull as it sounds.] We ate dinner downtown, bought an umbrella, and at another request of my brother we wandered around looking for the Boston Massacre sight which apparently has been misplaced [??].

Then Josh took me with him to see the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and I had a really [really] good night to top off a really [really] good day.

Saturday, at my mom's suggestion [not that I complained whatsoever], her and I went back with Josh to Brown, so I could see the school again incase I eventually end up getting in [wishful thinking]. We wandered around a little, then while my mom chilled in a library Josh showed me his room [heh.] and introduced me to some people and before I was ready to leave it was time to go back to Boston [:(]. Last night my mom and I had a rather late dinner with a family friend who now lives in Boston, even though this morning we had to wake up at 6am to catch our flight. I have successfully stayed busy all day, yet have completed very little of what I wanted to get done. [Funny how that happens, huh?]"

"event","This week has been quite the contradiction. I'm glad that the whole college waiting process is done and over and yet I can't deny that I'm disappointed. I'm not a pessimist-- I know I'll be happy where ever I end up, but I have no problem admitting I'm jealous of everyone else who not only knows exactly what they want, but got it; so easily, too. I worked just as hard, harder than some; I'm not saying people don't deserve what they got, I just wish I got the same sort of recognition. I'm so petty and immature. I'm sure this is supposed to teach me something, but it's hard to grow when you feel like you're lacking something that everyone else has.

I'm getting what's good for me. I know that much. But the largest part of me is still a kid and I'd rather have what I wanted most then settle for what I got.

If I had the chance to redo it, I wouldnt have done anything differently. I couldnt have tried any harder. I am what I am. It's weird that that thought is both so heartbreaking and comforting at the same time.

As stressful and sad as some parts were, this week was also lazy and relaxing and I'm so happy that Josh was home.

In the days after you leave I always feel a little bit lost, like you packed a part of me in your suitcase, like my heart is 1,000  miles away from here. I'm glad that you have that part of me with you, but I wish I had a piece of you here with me, too."

It's just that lately I feel like i've become as passive as I never want to be; I've resigned to just allowing myself to be pulled along for the ride, not reacting to anything because I know I'm passionate&nbsp;and if i react I'll just make things worse. It's easier to sit by and watch things slowly deteriorate than to do anything that will make it happen any quicker.&nbsp;Cant make it better, then dont make it worse.

The best nights are the private ones, the secret ones, the ones that I dont even care enough to ask what anyone else is doing because doing what I want to do is more important than who I do it with. And because the people I really want around are already apart of it without me having to ask."

-It's eight o'clock? How did that happen?
- Naps are nice, but not when they're totally unintentional.
-Financial aid and scholarships are a pain in the ass.
- Fun is good. But fun is more fun when you share it with fun people.
-There are some people I don't like, but I always seem to forget how much I dislike them.
-I don't know who it is that's making things so complicated, me or you. Yes, I mean you.
-I think a large majority of what you say and do is bullshit. But I mean that in the nicest way because I don't think you know what you're doing. (And because a lot of what I say and do is bullshit, too.)
- I wish I could stop thinking about then and start thinking about now. Face my feelings.
- I wish I could say exactly what I want to.
- I wish you would say exactly what I you want to, or atleast what I want you to.
- I really, really, wish there wasn't anything I wanted you to say.
- Sam, I'm sorry for fighting with you this morning. I think it was a combination of sleep deprivation, fever, stress, and all around grumpiness. Cause I really don't care that much about colors. Infact, I'm totally backwards in the way that:
- The times I really should be expressing my frustrations are the times I'm quiet.
- I talk about other people too much.
- I don't talk about myself as much as I need to. And that doesn't make me self centered.
- I need one straight dose of honesty. Then everything would be better.
-It's funny that I say ""everything"" in reference to one thing, because everything else is actually really good right now.
- I ignore the bad side of things even though I know it'll blow up later because it's so easy to do. 
- I'm actually pretty much up to date with litmag and art pieces which is amazing. AMAZING.
- It's also amazing that there are only 3 college interviews and 2 months until admissions decisions.
- 29 days (or 28 depending on when you'd say it is) until my birthday (and the lotto, strippers, clubs, and porn). 
- On my own, ending on a good note is my forte."

I feel like time is playing tricks on me again and I kind of like it. I kind of hate it, too. Time has blurred everything together; I feel like I'm in the back row of Mr. Mucino's room while he's writing on the overhead and I'm not wearing my glasses. I'm squinting,  and where are my glasses? In my bag.

But now I'm in Mr. Perdomo's room and he owes me $10 and he has big gross sweat stains under his arms, but he looks out for me the same way Mr. Mucino did and it's kind of endearing.

Someone was talking about Mrs. Henderson today and I remember her saying she would come to graduation and hold a sign and cheer for us. That seems like yesterday, doesn't it? And now we're really graduating and that's... that's weird.

I miss being driven to school every morning by my parents, then Amanda's parents, then my brother, and I miss parking spot 240. I really do. I know next year I'll miss parking spot 14, too.

I remember what it felt like when I didn't know where I wanted to apply to college. I remember what it felt liken when I didn't get in to where I wanted to go. And now I know what it feels like to wait and to try to convince myself that I still don't know where I want to go. 

I'm not actively waiting, not yet, but I know eventually I'll realize that I should be, and I will.

It's scary that everyone knows something about their futures, something I don't know about mine. It's scary that I feel like I'm being left behind when nothing has even started yet.

I feel like college is just a dream. I know it must be real because I know you've gotten in, and I know you're there, and Josh, I know you just left to go back to college, too. It must be real because it's changed you all so much, it's changed how I see you, how you see yourself, how you see me. But it doesn't seem real. It feels so make believe.

I've been so happy lately, and even crying was okay because I'm in love. I've said a thousand goodbye's, but knowing so markedly how much I'll miss you makes me teary eyed and I can't help it. I don't really want to, either.

"event","It amazes me that something so simple as the phone call I got from Rachel last night is by far the single most thoughtful thing anyone has done for me lately. I don't even think it took much thought, but thank you Rachel, none the less. (And I promise I'll try to make sure that our talent doesn't really come unplugged.)

I woke up lateish today after having a strange series of dreams that were vivid and fun, and when I woke up I was disspointed that they didn't really happen, that I was just in bed, at home, alone, with no one to even describe them to. So it goes, I guess; things change and life isn't quite what it used to be. Maybe it's about time I stop dreaming anyway; it doesn't get me anywhere.

Last night was random, and informative, too. fyi- diamond-shaped yellow signs picturing red octagons and an arrow pointing to the sky indicate a stop sign ahead, not stop signs falling from the sky. ...Abolition?  :o) You guys are fun.

Friday night I saw Harry Potter with my mom and it was good jolly fun. Friday night I realized that if we ever did have magic, we've probably lost it by now; I think it's strange that we're able to lose things even when we want them so badly.

I feel like I'm always wishing and waiting, not for something but for things to be better, different, or I guess the same?, but nothing ever happens. Do you have any idea how that feels?

There's so much to say, but I say so little. This is the best I can do."

Mr.Sink: ""Just a number. But make sure it's not higher than 27, because there are only 27 amendments.""

"event","...and everything always comes around back to you, that easily. I forgot to put that song on your cd, even though I know I meant to; how did I forget? Maybe I'd feel better if I had. All day I've been getting these 3.5 second dizzy spells, like everything in my head is going too fast, or maybe it's everything around me that's going too fast, but how can that be when everything's going so by so, so slowly? Seriously, this time management thing has gotten easier, and it's not because I have any less to do; it's like time is trying to help, and driving me crazy is just a side effect.
  
It's funny that this whole college-separation thing is finally wearing me down when you're all about to come home. I hate not being able to understand, and I hate the awkwardness when I don't know how to respond, and I hate feeling like home (or whatever you call this place now) isn't the same anymore, like it's inferior to how it was before ( and it is because I can tell atleast part of you has moved on). Part of me has grown to hate letters, because even though sometimes they make you feel closer, they also make you feel so far away. When you're within 20 miles theres no need to write; why do you have to be so far?

*dizziness*

*sigh*
On a shallower note, why does everyone always make the biggest production when I wear the slightest bit of makeup? I get strange looks for not caring, but I feel like people look and me even more strangely when I do. What's up with that?"

Sam, Garcia, Adam, Medoff, Philip, my mom, my dad, and myself made an escape from hurricane hell to Orlando for the night on Saturday. It was so much more fun than being at home in the dark, or even sleeping over somewhere with power. The car ride up seems so much shorter with good company and good music, and Halloween Horror nights itself was amazingly fun.  Who doesn't laugh when someone wags a chainsaw in their face, or shrieks pop tart? I certainly do. And I think we were all comforted by the fact that my dad is the biggest pansy of us all. 

Afterwards we left the park and time travelled back to the hotel room (which had a door bell?) and talked awhile before going to bed. We had lunch and went home and I HAD POWER. I had a deliciously warm shower last night, even though I had one yesterday morning, and then I played on the computer because, oh my sweet lord, have i missed the computer.

This week the days seemed so long, but now I think about it and it's already Halloween and it's already November. This week is already over; this year is almost over. Time is slipping through my fingers and I don't know if I should clench my fist and try to hold on or just let it all go, but either way its dripping, dripping, gone. And you're almost home, and I'm happy, but that just means you're almost gone again, you know? When will your home be where my home is again?"

I was stained, with a role, in a day not my own 
But as you walked into my life you showed what needed to be shown 
And I always knew, what was right I just didn't know that I might 
Peel away and choose to see with such a different sight 

And I will never see the sky the same way and 
I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and 
I will never cease to fly if held down and 
I will always reach too high cause I've seen, cause I've seen, twilight 

Never cared never wanted 
Never sought to see what flaunted 
So on purpose so in my face
Couldn't see beyond my own place 
And it was so easy not to behold what I could hold 
But you taught me I could change
Whatever came within these shallow days 

And I will never see the sky the same way and 
I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and 
I will never cease to fly if held down and 
I will always reach too high cause I've seen, cause I've seen

As the sun shines through it pushes away and pushes ahead 
It fills the warmth of blue and leaves a chill instead and 
I didn't know that I could be so blind to all that is so real 
But as illusion dies I see there is so much to be revealed 

And I will never see the sky the same way and 
I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday and 
I will never cease to fly if held down and 
I will always reach too high cause I've seen, cause I've seen, twilight

All that I know is that you're here with me 
It's alright, yeah it's alright 
Won't you tell me that you need me so bad 
'Cause you are everything I've never had 
Every time I look at you, it hurts so bad 
And it's alright, yeah it's alright 




*sigh* it's only thursday, which means that Josh was here 4 days ago. And it seems like it's been so much longer. Come back.

I miss you, Josh. And I miss you, too. Yes, Megan, you."

"event","Freak lightning strikes that knock out the school's power and cancel school for the day should happen more often, even if they're planned by the faculty and not by god, because they allow for a lot of spontaneity and fun.

Today was what I always imagined senior year was supposed to be like. And it was nice (minus the slight-courtyard-chaos).

We got out at 8 something (after I had a brief awkwardness with Josh's roommate on the phone), proceeded to ""discuss"" what to do with the day until 9 something while waiting for traffic to clear, and eventually went onward to city place. We brookstoned it for a good thirty minutes, and ate at City Pizza, which has been expanded (*gasp* i know) to double its size and is just as good as ever.

Then we went onto the beach, where the changing was easy and weather was perfect. I love that spot on the beach with the shallower water that I can stand in until a good 15 feet out. I also love friends who make me forget, even if momentarily, that there is a bigger world out there than just us.

Sometimes it's okay to stop worrying and to just have fun; even when you're supposed to be in school; even when you're missing someone terribly.

I love you guys.

And Josh, assuming you still read this, I love you too."

"event","So... Last night Kathy hugged a freaked-out spanish stranger, Josh almost died from Dr Pepper, I hit on a burger king employee, Medoff needed some preperation H, and Sam was momentarily a lesbian.

Last night Josh was going to streak but couldn't. And last night we all climbed a tree and then Sam got shot. Got a shot, sorry. At the hospital. It was a good time, or atleast it will be a good memory, and it was a good distraction from the fact that Josh was leaving.



...And he went. And he's probably in Boston right now, as I'm typing this, and that's kind of a cool thought. Except for the fact that he's not here.

It'll take some getting used to the fact that he's gone, and that everyone else is gone, too(except for us cool junior/seniors). But I'll get used to it, we all will, and before we know it they'll all be back, and soon we'll be leaving too. Wow. That's fucked up, isn't it?


We'll all be leaving soon too."

"event","I haven't updated in along, long while. I was looking back at my old entries though, and now I kind of wish I'd been updating this whole time, so I'd have something to help me remember this summer. But maybe what I can't remember on my own, isn't worth remembering, anyway.

So, long story short, this summers been good (as I'm sure you've read in everyone else's lj anyway; my updating really would have been superfluous), despite the fact that we seem to have collectively given up on the movie (and the boat) that we were so passionate about at some point.

I just got back from a Boston/New England college-tour-trip yesterday morning. It was... informative. Well, not really. Well, kind of. You can see I'm conflicted; I don't know what the eff to do. I could use some help, but I don't know who to ask; and I dont really want any help, either. I already know what I want to do, I just want someone to tell me that I can, and that it's okay and that... I'll be happy next year around this time.

I want people to make me all the right promises and to mean them, and I want some things to never change. I want a lot of things that I know I can't have, things I can't even bring myself to ask for. 

But there's that little part of me that still wants to ask. Y'know?

I just don't think I'll ever feel comfortable parking in the first row. It's a nice short walk to class, but these days I feel like I could use a longer one with time to think and time to breathe and time to realize what's going on. Maybe short is better; no time to realize how different everything really is. It's 6 rows closer and it's a different perspective, a scary one, one I'm not ready for. After school, the parking lot is only a quarter full (...three-quarters empty?), and the kids all look so young. We're all so young. I don't want there to be next year, and I really don't want to feel like I'm missing something when I turn and see 240 empty and the shade looking so nice.

But I kind of do because it already seems as far away as everything else, and it's not even tomorrow yet.

"event","And now for a guest appearance (in a poem/not really a poem at all/ my mindless ramblings) by one of my all-time favorite words/phrases: question mark.

""?""
I know that question mark isn't there by mistake
It was strategically placed
To make me wonder,
And make me hope
That someday you'd be telling me,
Instead of asking me;
That you'd be certain and 
You'd be happy,
Instead of holding out for something better.
Somehow you can pretend that that question mark's invisible
Like I can't hear the change in pitch of your voice,
And you can't see the dissapointment in my eyes.
That question mark carries so much meaning
That the phrase it follows is tipping to the right under its weight;
It's leaning towards confusion,
Towards uncertainty,
Towards everything it shouldn't be,
Everything it's not supposed to mean.
I don't know how to respond
When you tell me,
When you ask me...
When you say, ""I love you?""
And it's funny because you never had to say you did;
I was content as long as you didn't say you didnt.
But that question mark,
It isn't there by mistake
It was strategically placed
To make me realize
You don't love me;
Not the way that I love you."

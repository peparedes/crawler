You see, Mirika doesn't watch TV or read newspapers, so Mirika didn't hear anything about him until coming onto the Internet. He's an amazing man~. Mirika sees a lot of people calling him a bad person. Mirika wasn't sure what to think at first. But she decided she likes him. He risks being jailed to steal from the rich and give to the poor. He wears such a sparkly outfit, too. And like that mister with the big nose said, he can fly like Max!

Sigh~~ What a romantic figure..."

"event","Max is still sick. It's a bit boring without him around here. He brings so much life into the circus tent~! Especially when him and Rilo are together. Heehee.

Mirika's been doing some thinking. Her heart is so full right now. Every time Mirika hears about a certain someone, her heart beats faster. Hmmm, that's exciting, now that Mirika thinks about it... Oh! That means Max doesn't have to be around for things to be exciting after all~! Yay~! Time for strawberry ice cream!"

Mirika thought it would be a happy site about circuses. But, but... WAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Mirika isn't a bad girl. Ratoh is her best friend! She would never hurt him! They want to take Ratoh away from Mirika? Do... do people really HATE people like Mirika??"

"event","Hi~! Max is letting Mirika use his computer. You see, Papa's computer broke. He said it was full of spies and bugs. Mirika doesn't know how they got in there. How strange! Papa had to take it to a doctor to get it all healed up. It should be okay soon! But anyway, that's why Mirika has been so quiet. Sorry~. Mirika will be back, okay?

P.S. Thank you for all the lovely Valentine Day's cards! They made Mirika so happy."

"event","Hi, everyone! I'm Tachimi Rika, but you can call me ""Mirika,"" okay? Nice to meet you all!

Mirika plays with her cute friends every day at the Tachimi Circus. Papa is the circus owner. He bought this amazing magic box that lets Mirika talk to people outside. This is so exciting! It's a little confusing, but that's okay. Mirika will get the hang of it... right?

Oh! Mirika heard this box can even play music. So! While looking for music Max could use for his show, Mirika won a chance to win ten thousand dollars! Yay! Lucky~! Then, while looking for more, Mirika won a chance to win a MILLION dollars! Do you know how many dresses and cupcakes and glitter glue can be bought with that much money? Hmmm... ...A lot, right? Wish Mirika luck! The magic box also showed a way to win something by shooting a little duckie. But, Mirika couldn't do that. Mirika tried talking to the duckie, but he didn't respond. He probably wasn't ready to be a star yet.

Hmmm. I guess that's all. Does anybody want to chat? We just finished rehearsal, so Mirika is bored."

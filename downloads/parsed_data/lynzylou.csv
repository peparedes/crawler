"event","<lj-cut text=""my skydiving story...with pictures"">I finally did it, I went skydiving.  After reading and signing pages and pages of waiver that repeated itself along with a video that explains the damn waiver, Eric and I waited for about an hour and watched divers overhead circling the field like vultures.  We probably saw 100 people jump and neither of them died or broke anything. That was comforting to say the least.  We got trained on landing, exiting the plane, hand signals, stuff like that, plus the arch of the body which you have to do during the freefall to keep yourself stable before releasing the parachute.  
     The airplane smelled badly of exhaust but you could see the mist of niagara falls way in the distance.  What I was about to do hadn't hit me until we were driving to the place. The scariest part was knowing I was next.
So the instructor and I waddled over the edge in our tandem straps and did our plane exit which was basically just rocking back and forth 3 times and then leaning out with our arms out. blast of cold air and wind. It was such a shock to the system falling that all I thought about was how it felt. can't breathe, 120 mph air hitting every part of my body (we were falling at 120 mph after all), focus on breathing and watch for hand signals.
So the first 10 seconds of the freefall was pretty unpleasant until I got used to the wind tunnel effect.  The freefall itself was approx 40-50 seconds long. It was the weirdest feeling- very hard to describe.
Then he gave me the hand signal signifying the end of the freefall by opening and closing his hand (if I remember correctly that means 5,000 feet) and then tapping my side. My hands were so numb that it was hard to even find the thing and hard to tell if I was the one who even pulled it. 
   Then a jerk and it was completely still. It didn't seem like we were going anywhere, as if we were just suspended and floating in midair. It didn't seem real at all.  I always liked the view from an airplane- and here I was, god knows how many feet off the ground above what looks like a computer grid below us. We had jumped out at 14,000 feet if memory serves me right. He said you could see Toronto, including the tower, but I couldn't make out anything remotely resembling a city so I eventually told him I saw it so he would stop pointing at it. Lake Ontario was obvious, and the Niagara River. Niagara falls was nowhere to be seen.
   We talked and he let me steer the parachute with his help.  He had done 750 jumps, and although he gets paid to do tandem jumps, it's just a hobby for him. He's also from Syracuse so we talked about that.    
After about 5-6 minutes of gradually approaching the ground, we were pretty close to Eric and his trainer so I was able to watch them land.  Tandem divers usually land on their butts- keeps the legs of the way of the instructor.  The landing felt pretty hard actually- any harder and I think I might have broken something.  I even have black and blue marks from it and my body feels kinda sore sitting down, even today.  But it was fantastic having the chance to do this. Unfortunetely, eric didn't like it becaues he has sinus problems so his ears killed him on the way down.

If my sister decides to go and needs someone to go with her, I would do this again.  Otherwise, probably not. I think the chances are just low enough to try at least once, maybe twice. So there you have it, I'm alive and well. 

oh and justin thought i was dead for about 5 hours becaues I didn't know what his number was, and my family never even answered their phone, and I was stuck at a bus station.

oh yeah and my roomate is moving out right now, she got the ra position.

yeah and target has green apple soda now. in cans.

this has been a good week.

It's 8 a.m. on New Year's Day, and I'm finally heading to bed &mdash; Colin and I have our own little New Year's Eve tradition of choosing a season of TV to marathon, and then parking ourselves on the couch all day to get through it all.  Today (yesterday?) we started at 4 p.m. with the last four episodes of <i>Chuck</i>, season 1, and then moved on to season 1 of <i>Dexter</i>.

(We have a thing for death on New Year's Eve, apparently &mdash; the last two years have been seasons one and two, respectively, of <i>Dead Like Me</i>, and we also have <i>Pushing Daisies</i>, which we didn't get to tonight, but which we'll be watching in the next couple of days.)

But today, it was 16 episodes in 16 hours, almost to the minute &mdash; including food and bathroom breaks.

Sounds like a pretty perfect New Year's Eve to me."

"event","I can't think of that ninth commandment, ""Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,"" without my mind jumping to ""Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain.""  Two separate commandments, but they go hand in hand, to me.

More than just an admonition against swearing, particularly blasphemous utterances, that third commandment is a reminder that, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, we literally <i>take the name</i>.  Whether it's identifying as God's Chosen People or as <i>Christ</i>ians, something about our very identity invokes God's presence.

So when I take that name, do I take it in vain?  When people associate me with Christ, in whatever way, have I taken that responsibility and privilege lightly?  When I identify as a faith-based theatre artist working from the Christian tradition, and I carry with me the baggage of centuries of religious art and cheesy Christmas pageants, is there something about me--about my work--that rises above that and bears the name of Christ, rather than only bearing the history and tradition?

It's bigger than simply uttering, ""Oh my God!"" or ""Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!"" in moments of surprise or panic.

It's a matter of taking a name, taking an identity, bearing a witness.

In one of my classes right now, I'm in the process of writing my aesthetic and artistic statements, finding the words to describe my work and how my faith impacts it, both in the general terms, and in the specifics of what I will or won't produce.  I came in with that document on Friday, and presented my class with a list of works--faith-based or not--that inspire me, and certain criteria for work that I want to do.  It was more about the attitude and underlying themes of the work than the story content, and I think that it surprised some of them that I didn't come in with my ""WILL NOT TOUCH"" list.

As I took the name of faith-based theatre artist, did I bear witness to the fact that we're not all working from a list of taboo subjects, but that my context determines the work I do, just as much as the content itself?  Did they see that I want to tell good stories, just like the rest of them, and that I refuse to pigeon-hole a script that I haven't even read based on its perceived content?

I bear witness as an artist, as a Christian, as a person of faith.  I take these names--do I take them in vain?"

"event","I smile big in photos.  Closed-mouth smiles, half there, look silly on me.  My eyes are big, and they get bigger, somehow, when I smile.  I look like a goof when I try to smile with my lips together.

He smiles small.  His favorite pictures of himself have his mouth closed, and he looks like he's got a secret that he's not telling the camera.  He doesn't like photos where he smiles with his teeth showing.

When we smile--and I mean <i>really</i>, genuinely, deep-down smile--I sparkle; he glows.

I'm still waiting for a transcendently beautiful picture of the two of us laughing together, but whenever someone takes one, one or the other of us has our eyes squinched up funny, or a huge double chin.

At first glance, this is the best description of the two of us.  I'm more outgoing, more verbose, more likely to be the one heard across the room.  He's less likely to talk for the sake of making noise, more likely to think before he speaks, less brash, more likely to back up what I'm saying and distill my ramblings.

And maybe the fact that those first impressions are as one-dimensional as a photographed smile is why we complement each other so well.  It's a clear, accurate picture, but it's far from being the full spectrum of smiles that either of us has.

Maybe the squinchy-eyed, double-chinned, weird-angled laughing photo is transcendently beautiful after all.

<i>For the visually impaired:  There is a photo of Colin and I standing in front of a Christmas tree. We're both looking straight at the camera.  I'm smiling a wide, full smile.  He's smiling more gently, with his lips together.  It's one of our favorite photos of the two of us together.</i>

"event","Gotta say, I'm not really a fan of winter.  It's not my favorite season--that distinction is reserved for summer.  (Ah, summer, with your long, long days; your lazy lethargy; your warm sunshine... but I digress.)  It may not have been the main reason I moved to L.A., but the weather has certainly been one of the biggest perks of living here for the past two years.  For the past few winters, I've gone back to Calgary for 3 weeks in December, and that's enough time to get my fill of snow and cold--and, more importantly, to drive on icy roads long enough to not become a wimpy driver who can't handle winter.

That's the thing.  I may not <i>love</i> winter, but I can handle it.  I come from hardy, Canadian prairie stock.  I know what to do when it's -40 degrees Celsius out, but I love the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_wind"" target=""_blank"">Chinook winds</a> that invariably mean that I don't have to deal with the -40 weather for very long.  I know how to drive on ice, and I don't freak out if there's a skiff of snow that doesn't even stick to the ground, and thankyouverymuch, I plan on keeping those skills.

I have yet to wear a winter coat (or gloves, or a toque) while living in Southern California, because it has yet to get <i>cold</i> here.  I see people around here get all bundled up when the temperature hits 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Canadian part of me laughs at them for being such wimps, while the American part of me gloats at my family and friends who live where they <i>really</i> have to bundle up.  It gets chilly, yes.  It gets cold enough that I don't want to sleep with my window open all winter, cold enough that I'm not wearing sandals all the time, cold enough that I can actually use my sweaters and fall jackets--but it doesn't get <i>cold</i>, and that's one of the things I love about this place.

One thing I don't love, however, is the assumption that just because I'm Canadian, I've never experienced hot weather before.  I could do without all the comments about how this must be the hottest weather I've ever experienced, and I must be so out of my element, and isn't it just so <i>different</i> from the frozen north, and it must be <i>freezing</i> up there.  (My favorite is when that last comment comes in August.)

Winter and I have a complicated relationship.  <i>I</i> may not like it, but that doesn't give others who have never lived with it the right to knock it.  When Calgary's weather doesn't cooperate with the season, I feel like the city is a misbehaving small child, embarrassing me in front of all my friends, even though I <i>know</i> it's not doing it on purpose.  But that doesn't mean I won't defend it.  ""It's not always like this.""  ""This isn't really seasonal.""  ""Wait a few days; a chinook will hit and the temperature will jump 40 degrees overnight.""  ""At least we're not like some places, where winter doesn't leave until spring.""

And, you know, there are things about it that aren't all that bad.  While it's all well and good to curl up in bed with hot chocolate and a book on a windy, rainy, chilly day in Los Angeles, it's even better to do it on a blizzardy, blustery, freezing cold day in Calgary.  And if you've never experienced a midnight snowfall on Christmas Eve, you don't know what you're missing.  And just like any other season, it's the change that's the best part.  The first crisp, cold day; the new sweaters, jackets, and corduroy in stores; the first snowfall; those bright, cold, sunny days that are still good days for a walk outside.  As long as those days don't come before December first.

When it comes to winter, I'm picky.  I want it on my terms, when I want it.  I'd be happy with a winter that lasted for the month of December.  No more, no less.  Give me a winter that goes with Christmas, and I can handle that.  But by February?  You and me, winter?  We're <i>so</i> over, and while I still may not like other people smack-talking you, I reserve the right to badmouth you all I want.

I wrote a few of the challenges as home entries, but I think it'll be great to have something other than my thesis (and <a href=""http://alidaanderson.net/blog"">my professional blog on my website</a>) to focus on writing for the next few months, and this poor little lj needs some love and attention before it atrophies into nothing.

Yes, it's a busy few months as it is, but there's always time to fit something else in.  Sleep?  Pfft.  Sleep is for wimps."

"event","I still need to get a second job, but I really don't want to.  There's <i>so much</i> going on in this city that it kills me to think of eating up my evenings with another job.  I don't take advantage of nearly enough of the stuff that Calgary offers, but with this job (the Calgary Arts Development one), it's coming across my desk constantly.  When I'm more aware of what's happening--and around people who are more excited about it--I'm reminded that I need to be out there, seeing and doing more.  I want to be doing something cultural at least every week, and there are that many opportunities (and more!), if only I didn't have to work evenings and weekends elsewhere.

Sigh."

"event","And we're off!

The trailer was packed up yesterday, and I had everything down in the car by 8:30 last night, which was great.  I had the end of the evening to spend on the phone with Colin and just chill on the couch.  (My bed is gone, so I slept on the couch, which is fortunately not going anywhere.)

The place looks oddly half-empty.  I mean, my room is totally cleared out and the living room has half the furniture gone, but the dishwasher is still full and there's stuff in the kitchen, but not nearly as much as usual.  It's odd to move out without having to do the whole ""get the place to the completely clean bare bones so the landlord can inspect it"" thing.

In any case, I'm hoping to make the trip in two days.  We usually do it in two (a 15-hour and a 9-hour) when there are two of us driving; I'm hoping to split it more evenly and do two 14-ish-hour days on the road, giving myself lots of time for stretch breaks and so on.  The upside to getting awful gas mileage while pulling the trailer is that it forces me to stop for gas about twice as often as I would on a road trip without it.  We discovered that it's about 3 1/2 tanks of gas from Calgary to L.A. with no trailer, and about 6 tanks with the trailer.  Icky.

So anyway... I have to stop at the U-Haul dealer to drop off the dolly, and then I'm on the road.  That'll take me about 20 minutes out of my way, but I should be going for real by about 8:00.

I'll post tonight from somewhere in Idaho!"

"event","I'm supposed to be working on my thesis database, but I'd rather be doing anything but.  It's not that I mind the research, because that's interesting.  It's the data entry into Access that's dragging me down.  I know it's the best way to keep everything straight, because otherwise, I'll never remember what belongs where, but still... I'd rather have a photographic memory and not have to document everything.  ;)

Man, this Starbucks is freezing.  I should really go home, where I can control the A/C.

(And now, I'm home.)

The internet here is being ridiculously slow tonight.  Just sayin'.

I don't think I've mentioned it here yet, but I plowed through <i>Chuck</i> in the past couple of weeks.  I've been busy with so much other stuff, and yet I kept going, and I watched both seasons within about a week and a half.  It's one of those shows that I've now caught up to and I actually miss.  I haven't felt the need to rewatch episodes or random scenes from week to week with any show for a while, but I've been doing that with this one since I finished it.  Colin hasn't seen it, so I've already told him that this will be added to our ""must-buy"" list.  He'll like it, and I'll gladly rewatch it with him.

We have so much TV on DVD to get through, though.  There are at least 5 shows that we need to watch all or part of (or have a season of and need to watch to see if we want to watch more).  That's definitely where more of our entertainment budget has been going lately.  We both used to buy a lot more movies (especially him), but in the past year or so, most of what we've purchased has been TV.  Somehow, it just seems like a better value to get 14 hours of viewing for not much more money than a movie's 2 hours.  Also, we love having the excuse of working through a show to spend a quiet night at home.  We get so busy that when we do have time to spend 3 or 4 hours in front of the TV, watching a few episodes of whatever show we're working through, we love it.

Not that we don't watch movies, because sometimes that's just what we're in the mood for, but for whatever reason, it's been more about TV lately--but we so rarely watch TV live that it's all about the TV on DVD.

I don't have a desk right now, and I haven't had one while I've lived here, but when we have our own place and I have a desk again, I've found the one I want.  I really like the IKEA Mikael desk, either <a href=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2359/2481564382_3222a28f59.jpg?v=0"">regular</a> or <a href=""http://www.furniturestoreblog.com/images/picture%20%235.jpg"">corner</a>, depending on the configuration of the room.  Sunday after church, I had lunch at IKEA and spent some time wandering around.  Bad idea when I'm packing and putting things in storage.  Heh.  There are always too many things that I want.

New blog entry up at <a href=""http://alidaanderson.net/blog"">the other blog</a>.  As an artist evaluating your work, whose opinions matter most?

Four more days until I leave.  Fortunately, there's not <i>too</i> much left to do around here.  I'll have enough to keep me busy for the next couple of days, but I shouldn't be too overwhelmed and stressed out.  And then, I have next week off, since I'd planned to start work a week later when we were hoping to take next week as a vacation week.  Hopefully I can get together with a few friends and get some errands done--maybe even take care of transferring over my license, the car registration and insurance, and my health care right away.  We'll see.

And... it's bedtime."

"event","I have a BBQ with the Coffeehouse committee this afternoon, and I don't really want to go.  I have to, though; I'm leading the meeting portion of the afternoon.  Sigh.  I have so much to get done this week.  Makes me glad that I got a majority of my packing done last week, since my schedule was somehow lighter.

Really, I only have two major things left:  Portfolio Review on Monday, and my Independent Study documentation, due next Tuesday.  I'm on the planning committee for Portfolio Review, so I have things to take care of with that, and then I have to put together my own portfolio.  I've been mostly concentrating on my website, which is just about ready to go, so that's fine, but I need to put together a powerpoint version of my resume/portfolio/profile.  I'll have some binders out (how exciting; you can see how I organize my binder!), and I'll put out posters and programs, but my primary focus is getting something together that I can distribute (a website) and that represents the shows I've done.

It's hard for producers to do this kind of review, because we don't have the physical work to show.  Designers can set up a model or a mannequin, and their work can be presented in its own right.  A stage manager or production manager's binder says a lot about their work, and while it may not be as pretty or as interesting as a designer's table, to the right person, it speaks volumes.

My portfolio, though, depends on other people's work.  If you take a look at <a href=""http://alidaanderson.net/portfolio"">my online portfolio</a>, you'll see that it's comprised of a lot of things that other people have done.  Other directors' stagings.  Other actors onstage.  Other designers' designs.  Other graphic designers' posters.

However, all of that is important to convey the scope of the shows and the style of work that I do.  I need to present all of that (with credit, of course) so that people can see that the Passion Play, which I production managed, involved over 100 cast, was seen by 10,000 audience members, and had a several-acre stage.  I need to show what the shows at CalArts look like, what kind of aesthetic was developed.  And, in a way, that's best seen on a screen.  I'm not trying to appropriate anyone else's work as my own, and I'm not trying to show their models or the specific details of their work.  I'm explaining my place in the big picture, and the big picture involves a <i>lot</i> of people's work.

So, all that to say that it works best as a digital portfolio, and I have to make a powerpoint presentation to have looping at my station all day.

And then... thesis work.  Mostly it's just making sure that all the documentation of what I've done this semester is up-to-date.  I need to make sure the company database has all the information I currently have in it, and I need to finish a summary of all the reading I've been doing this semester.  Oh, and interview questions.  I need to at least draft some questions that I want to use when I'm doing interviews this summer.

And, of course, there's all kinds of little stuff; the flotsam and jetsam of the end of the year.  Signatures that I have to track down, paperwork to submit, grant money to spend, receipts to submit, things to get ready for fall, all-school cleanup on Tuesday, work (at both jobs), internship details to hammer out, a second summer job to line up, etc, etc, etc.

Not to mention the five or so blog entries that are running around my head, threatening to disappear and be forgotten if I don't write them really, really soon.

Yeah, I'm really glad I did that packing last week."

"event","It's amazing how indecisive I become when faced with the fact that I have to decide what I'll need in the next three weeks and pack the rest.  Am I going to need those hair products, or can I start packing up my bathroom now?  Which jeans will I be in the mood to wear, and what shoes will go with them?

Then, of course, there's the process of deciding what I'll need in the next year and packing it separately from the things I don't need to access before at least next year.

And finally, there's the division of things that I'll need to have access to over the summer and things that I'll need in the fall (or potentially things that I'll need after December but before... whenever it is that I unpack everything else, which is still an unknown date) but can stay packed for the next four months.

Everything that can go in the trailer for the next while is packed in boxes sealed with yellow tape.  Everything that needs to go into a house is in boxes sealed with blue tape.  The blue tape boxes will be opened in waves, since I won't need them all at the same time, but I do need them all to be accessible.

Sigh.  No wonder I'm tired.

But the U-Haul is booked (and I'm still grumbling at the fact that it's 3 times more expensive for a one-way move from here to Calgary than it is from Calgary to here) and I've got 13 packed boxes stacked in the living room, so... I'm on my way?  I guess.

Mariah's out of town for the week, and by the time she gets back, she'll come back to an apartment full of boxes.  Poor girl.

Side note:  This is why I tend to procrastinate packing.  Once you start, the house is <i>never</i> clean.  There's just no way to tidy up and have the place look nice when there are boxes (and half-packed boxes, and stacks of stuff to go into boxes) everywhere.

Anyway.

I was looking for someplace with free wi-fi that's open 24 hours.  None of the Starbucks in the area are, but I'm wondering if Denny's has wi-fi.  It's attached to a Best Western; maybe it has hotel wireless, even if the restaurant itself doesn't.  It's not that I need it to be working all night, but the Starbucks that close at 11:30 or 12 aren't open quite late enough.  Tonight, I ended up at a Starbucks that was open until 11:30 (after getting there at about 9:45), and then came home to keep working here, but sometimes a change of scenery is nice."

"event","Well, I'm back.  My little blog-cation has served its purpose, and it's time to re-enter the world of the communicative.  It's been a full few weeks, with Esther's visit, more hours at work, the semester gearing up to the end and winding down at the same time, and the various and sundry day-to-day things that happen.

There were a thousand little things that I thought of to write about while I was away from lj-land (at least, away from the posting side; I kept up with everyone else's journals), but, of course, I didn't write them down, so they're lost in the netherworld of the space in between my brain and my keyboard, never to be recovered.  Most of them.  Some of the ideas will likely resurface at some point--I find that I mull over certain entries for quite some time before writing them--but many of the trivial, fleeting ideas are gone.

That's okay, though.  Not everything that passes through my head needs to find a voice on the internet.

So, what's new?  Well, my laptop's keyboard <a href=""http://www.treasurekingdom.com/Electronics/008DLECKSPrn.html"">is pink now</a>.  I have pictures of my own computer, but they're still on my camera, so in the meantime, you can look at that and envision.  My favorite is that the backspace key is now a magic wand.  The stickers are removable, so the fun won't last forever, but in the meantime, it's very exciting.  ;o)

Mariah and I are discussing our options for our apartment, the summer, and the fall.  We need to come to a decision in the next few days, and suffice to say, I may be having to make different arrangements than I'd originally planned for.

I leave for a weekend in Calgary tomorrow morning.  I'll get to see the show that Colin composed the orchestrations for (and which numerous other people that I know are in, but that's all kind of secondary for me).  I'm ridiculously proud of him, and having heard the various pieces in their electronic incarnations as demos, I'm excited to hear them as done by real instruments played by real instrumentalists.  It's the biggest project he's ever done, and he's certainly put the work into it and should be very, very proud of what he's done.  I know I am.  :)

We'll have the usual kind of holiday weekend.  Colin has both Friday and Monday off work, which is absolutely fantastic, so I don't have my usual dilemma of having time while he's at work.  Usually, when that happens, I try to schedule coffee with my girlfriends, but I'm completely okay with not having time for that.  We'll have Easter dinners with both our families (Saturday brunch with mine, Sunday dinner with his), two performances of the Easter show, Easter Sunday morning service, and Monday to just chill and hang out.  I fly out on Tuesday, but not until early evening, so since Colin's back at work, that's when I've scheduled my meetings and things to get done.  Bank meeting, internship meeting, and probably coffee with my mom (y'know, since my parents paid for this flight...).

Today--my birthday!--has been pretty normal.  It's a regular Thursday, with school, work, more school, more work.  The girls in the Public Affairs office made me cupcakes, but that's about it.  I work tonight, and I still have some packing and cleaning to do when I get home, so it'll be a short night before I head to the airport in the morning.

I'm very excited.  Since our visit last month got cut short by about 6 days, I really need this weekend.

Anyway.  Hopefully there'll be lots of pictures.  Lori promised to have her camera on hand.  :)"

"event","After living in the U.S. for a significant part of the last almost-4 years, I go back and forth between Celsius and Fahrenheit fairly easily.  I can convert them in my head (rather, I know the equivalents along the way, and I ballpark from there--I don't actually do the math), although I'm fuzzy on the Fahrenheit equivalents of 0 to -40 Celsius, and I'm fuzzy on the Celsius equivalents of 90+ Fahrenheit (gee, I wonder why...).  And, like learning a foreign language, I'm getting better at ""thinking"" in Fahrenheit, but there are still times that I have to convert it to Celsius to translate it into a sense of what the air will feel like on my body.

However, I've realized lately that, no matter who I'm talking to, I talk about Canadian temperatures in Celsius and American temperatures in Fahrenheit.

I realized it most vividly when Esther commented the other day that she wants it to be in the 30s the entire time she's visiting.  I did a quick double take and then agreed with her, because, yes, I'd like it to be in the mid-80s the entire time she's visiting.  The funniest part is, I have no problem instinctively saying that I would be fully happy for it to never dip below 25 all summer while I'm in Calgary, and would never think of saying that I want it to be in the high 70s for three months.

In my foreign language example, is this the equivalent to dreaming in French?"

"event","It's the responsibility of any artist to champion the creation of art that he or she disagrees with, doesn't understand, or is offended by.

This is a theory that I've been mulling over for a while--about a year now, I guess--and I think that I can fairly confidently boil it down to that statement.

<lj-cut text=""Let&#39;s explore that statement, complete with footnotes."">I subconsciously became aware of it when I was considering CalArts, but I actually put it into words last spring, when I was deciding whether I was going to take the job with the Calgary Fringe Festival for the summer.  In that case, it wasn't about whether I was artistically opposed to anything, but it was the fact that a lot of the work I'd have been associated with and working on would be work that I was morally, ideologically, religiously, and politically offended by.

Could I put my name on that kind of work professionally?  Well, in a sense, I do it every day, simply by being at CalArts.  A lot of what comes across my path is work that I don't find very aesthetically pleasing, work that is in direct contradiction to my beliefs and the way I live my life, and even work that mocks the things I build my life around.

<a name=""entry1""></a>However, the conclusion I came to (even though I didn't end up taking the Fringe job) was that I could seriously consider it, those objections aside, because the work I do is also ""fringe.""  Faith-based theatre is fringe theatre in the sense that it doesn't attract the mainstream, LORT-going<sup><a href=""#note1"">1</a></sup> audiences who want to see the same shows re-mounted year after year.  Both fringe edges struggle for funding, audiences, press coverage, and so on, because they, by definition, attract a ""fringe"" of the theatre-going public.  Work that is shown at a Fringe Festival may be ""fringe"" because of its content or its execution; faith-based theatre may have a more conventional presentation, but its content is what makes it less accessible to the general public.

Both groups are struggling for validation, recognition, and some level of mainstream presence in the theatre world, and by championing one type of fringe, I am a part of building a world where my kind of fringe has a voice.

I think that one of the most important qualities that an artist needs to have is the ability to recognize quality work, <i>whether they like the work or not</i>.  How else will art continue to grow, unless artists recognize that their niche is only one part of a larger world?  I don't have to enjoy work to recognize its quality (or lack thereof).  I don't have to agree with it to see that it's good.  Conversely, I don't have to like everything that presents a worldview that I agree with.

I need to be free to criticize the work of artists with whom I have everything in common.  If I can't see past content to quality (in both senses--the worldviews I agree with and those I don't), how will my work combine both quality and content?  If I'm only learning from people who are doing work that I share an ideology with, how will my art transcend the implied and perceived boundaries of faith-based theatre and draw its inspiration from the world around me, including the avant-garde work that can be, at times, offensive, scary, and polarizing?

And, just as importantly, if I'm committed to doing quality work, what can others--who may find <i>my</i> work offensive, scary, and polarizing--learn from me?

The art world is symbiotic.  We are all constantly learning from and drawing from each other.  A world with only LORT theatres would suffer from a great deal of deprivation--and yet, those theatres reach a certain demographic and serve an audience that may or may not ever branch out from it.  If an artistically conservative audience is ever going to see anything on the fringe, are they going to get there if they haven't started with something more conventional?  I'd say that most of them probably won't.

<a name=""entry2""></a>Although CalArts doesn't bear his name (but theatres and spaces inside the building are named after various members of the Disney family), it was founded by Walt Disney and his brother Roy.  CalArts students, on the whole, have a love-hate relationship with Disney.  There's the typical ""it's so commercialized, it's mass-appeal"" thing<sup><a href=""#note2"">2</a></sup>, but in my mind, Disney's work (speaking of Disney the corporation, not necessarily Walter E. Disney the person) exists on a different plane than CalArts' work.  They both shape the art world in some way, and they exist together and can learn from each other, but they generally reach different audiences--or reach the same audience for different reasons.

<a name=""entry3""></a>In any case, I read an article which argued that Walt Disney should be recognized as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.  Not only because he revolutionized animation--which continues to impact the film industry to this day--but also because he was committed to things like CalArts.  Even though he admitted that he wasn't a huge fan of its avant-garde work, he <i>recognized its importance in the art world</i> and established a school dedicated to it.  CalArts is, in some ways, the antithesis of Disney<sup><a href=""#note3"">3</a></sup>, and yet Walt Disney understood the importance of quietly championing a subset of the art world that wasn't his ""preferred"" aesthetic in order to make the art world a richer, more diverse place.

<a name=""entry4""></a>That's the thing.  It's not always about championing the work or the artist.  It's about championing an art world where the work I find offensive has the place to be made, because I recognize that my work is offensive to someone, yet it needs its place, too.  Their place isn't--and doesn't have to be--my place<sup><a href=""#note4"">4</a></sup>, but we both need a place.

<a name=""entry5""></a>No, I don't go see everything that comes across my path.  There are certain things that are so offensive to my faith and my beliefs or that are so graphic, grotesque, or unappealing to me that I choose not to see them.  There are things that I'm not aesthetically attracted to that I choose not to see.  I make that call based on a number of factors, but for me, the important thing is that no single factor, in and of itself, is enough to make me write off a piece of art<sup><a href=""#note5"">5</a></sup>.

I'm not obligated to see everything.  I'm not obligated to agree with, like, or even understand everything.  I'm not even obligated to appreciate everything.  Like everyone, it's my prerogative to choose not to watch something based on whatever criteria I want.  It's even my prerogative to judge my desire to experience something based on reviews and other sources, even though I haven't seen it.  It's my prerogative to have certain artists or companies whose work I refuse to support financially.

Those are the rights of every patron of the arts.  This entry isn't an ultimatum; it's not something that makes ""good"" or ""bad"" artists or audience members.  It's not something that means that an artist or audience member is ""more"" or ""less"" sophisticated than others.

What is it, then?  It's a way to promote the growth of the artistic community, in all aspects--mainstream, fringe, and everything in between.  It comes down to the fact that if I refuse to acknowledge the artistic merit of work that is opposite mine and they refuse to acknowledge the artistic merit of mine--and if we refuse to recognize that there are ways in which we can learn from each other--the art world becomes a very narrow place.










<a name=""note1""></a>1.  LORT = <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LORT"">League of Resident Theatres</a>.  Most rep houses in any major city are LORT theatres (or LORT-style, if they're outside the U.S.).  This is one of the styles of theatre that's fairly widely considered to be detrimental to innovative and creative work; the kind of house that will do things like remount ""A Christmas Carol"" every year.  However, it also appeals to the broadest subscriber base and probably represents the largest pool of theatre-goers in the not-for-profit world (i.e. excluding Broadway).  <a href=""#entry1"">(Back to entry)</a>

<a name=""note2""></a>2.  Certain CalArts students--and artists in general--have an automatic disdain of anything that has mass appeal, thinking that it loses some sort of artistic validity, but this argument goes both ways.  There's something to be learned from art that has reached and touched the masses, both in an artistic sense and in a business sense.  Does that mean that everything that has mass appeal is good?  Depends on your definition.  Some of it, not so much, but there's something to be said for the fact that it appeals to people.  <a href=""#entry2"">(Back to entry)</a>

<a name=""note3""></a>3.  In other ways, it's not, especially when it comes to animation.  CalArts' original animation teachers were some of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Old_Men"">Nine Old Men</a>, and some of the most influential people in animation today are CalArts alum (every animated film nominated for an Academy Award this year had CalArts alum attached to it).  While CalArts is cutting-edge and experimental in its animation work, that department has the closest ties to Disney and the ""mainstream"" industry.  However, that's not to say that there aren't alumni from every department who have had notably successful careers in the mainstream eye.  There are.  I could name people in any artistic discipline, and if you've got some sense of who's who in the arts, you'll know their names.  Animation is just the subsection of the arts and entertainment industry that's most dominated by CalArtians.  <a href=""#entry3"">(Back to entry)</a>

<a name=""note4""></a>4.  Although sometimes it is.  When I was in negotiations with the Fringe last year, they were considering a partnership of sorts with the faith-based art community, because they were beginning to recognize that, although we come from very different places, we end up side by side.  That partnership didn't happen last year, but the seeds have been planted, and both sides are more aware of the common ground between the two groups.  <a href=""#entry4"">(Back to entry)</a>

<a name=""note5""></a>5.  A lot of what's out there breaks my heart, because I believe it's so far from what God intended humanity to be, but each piece of work represents and reflects a person, and the way that work changes--in any significant trajectory of an artist's career--is because their life, ideology, faith, circumstance, etc. changes.  In other words, I can't make art be more reflective of the world I <i>wish</i> I lived in by trying to ignore or silence the work that is in opposition to my beliefs.  The work will change (in any way) if people themselves change.  Some do, some don't.  <a href=""#entry5"">(Back to entry)</a></lj-cut>"

"event","Well, March is definitely my month of visitors!  First Dad, then Colin, and now Esther's coming for spring break, since our breaks coincide (no, she's not a student; she's a preschool teacher).  She'll get here next Tuesday and leave on Sunday, so we'll have a good number of days to hang out and do fun L.A. stuff.  Like the beach and Disneyland.

My work schedule seems to be just about perfect, too.  After a number of weeks with very few hours (thanks to tech and the show), I have just over 20 hours this week, and I'll probably still get in an almost-full (10 hours is my usual) work week at school, <i>and</i> the timing fits well with Esther's trip.  I work Monday, but not Tuesday (when she flies in).  Wednesday and Thursday, I'm off by 4 p.m., and I'm off Friday and Saturday.  Sunday morning, she leaves really early, and then I work on Sunday evening.  She'll have to entertain herself for a couple of days, but I've got lots of TV on DVD, wireless internet, and a Target within walking distance of my house.

I'm not sure yet what else we'll do.  She's going to do some googling and see if there's anything that really strikes her fancy.  Disneyland is a must--she's been waiting her entire life to go, and it's half the reason she's coming down.  I think she's only half as excited to hang out with me as she is to go to Disneyland.  :)

We'll probably go to the beach, although weather will determine whether we actually hang out on the beach or just walk the boardwalk and go shopping.  Hopefully it'll be warm enough to be a combination of both, but we'll see.  Today was in the low 80s; hopefully it'll be around that while she's here.

Aside from those two things, we don't really have any particular plans yet.  If anyone wants to offer suggestions... well, that's what the comments are for!

(Hopefully next week is an indication of the kind of hours I'll get for the rest of the school year--without the show, I have more availability, and would really like to be getting decent hours.)

I've updated some of my tags, too.  I consolidated and deleted a few redundant ones and gave some of my most-used tags new names.  Now I just have to remember what the new names are when I'm tagging my entries.

I kind of feel like I'm already on spring break, just because I don't work until Saturday this week (thanks to a schedule that was tailored to Colin's intended visit) and I'm not hanging around school until midnight every night (although I <i>will</i> be there until sometime around 2 a.m. on Saturday night).  I've been home both last night and tonight, and I'm starting to get a little bored with it already.  It's nice to have the break, but I need to be productive.  I've got a lot to do in terms of my thesis, and I need to use this week wisely for that kind of work, but it's been nice to take a couple of days to relax and not do much of anything that wasn't absolutely necessary.

And now, I'm going to have some ice cream and read a book before I fall asleep.  Shhh.  Don't tell anyone that I'm being so unproductive."

"event","Two days is never enough time, but in this case, it was definitely the best decision to shorten Colin's trip down here and make it just a weekend.  Both Saturday and Sunday were long days, in the good way; Saturday night was a long night, in the ""we didn't get up until 1:30 Sunday afternoon"" way; and it was relaxing, especially for Colin.

Saturday, his flight got in at 11 a.m., and we just hung out for the afternoon--had lunch, went for a walk, started watching <i>Everwood</i> season 1 (which is going to be our next marathon, since Colin has never seen the series).  We headed up to the school at around 6, and then after the show, I was there until 2 for strike.  Colin was, too, but he went out to the car and fell asleep at around midnight, since he hadn't actually slept, except for a bit of dozing on the plane, since he got up at 9 on Friday morning...

... which explains why we decided to be heathens on Sunday morning and not even try to get up for church.  Instead, we got up at around 1:30 and decided that we'd go for a walk to get some lunch, come back, and watch some more <i>Everwood</i>.  And this is where the weekend gets interesting.

We left the apartment to have lunch, planning to walk there and back, about 2 miles each way.  Not that far, but far enough that I didn't really want to carry my purse with me, and since Colin had his wallet and phone, I didn't take anything with me.  Including the keys to the apartment.  Which I realized when we were about three steps out the door, which was firmly locked behind us.

Mariah was in Vegas for the weekend, and she wasn't going to be getting home until around 10, so we called a locksmith to see how much it'd cost to get in, but decided that the $60 was more than we wanted to pay, and we'd just figure out something else to do.  Colin had his car keys in his pocket, so at least we had a wallet and a set of car keys, so we could entertain ourselves for the rest of the day.

Except that it turned out that Colin didn't have his keys with him.  So, we had an afternoon and evening to kill with a wallet and some decent walking shoes.  Instead of walking to the restaurant we'd originally planned to go to, we went to the mall a little further away (about 3 1/2 miles), which has more sit-down restaurants and a movie theatre, and figured that we'd see a movie, and by the time that was over and we walked back home, Mariah would be getting back.

That part of the plan worked beautifully.  We walked to the mall, had lunch, wandered around Borders for a while, saw <i>Coraline</i>, and walked home, getting back at around 10... only to find out that Mariah's flight had been delayed, and it'd be at least another couple of hours before she got home.

And, of course, I had to pee.  I figured we should walk to the 24-hour grocery store, since nothing closer was open by 10:30 on a Sunday night, and wait there until Mariah got home.  So, off we went, walking about a mile to the store--and when I was finished, Colin figured that we were going to just head back.  I'd thought we could just wander around in the store for a while, but he didn't really want to, and I told him that as long as he was going to keep me warm (fortunately, it was a mild night, although sitting on the cement steps outside the apartment was a little chilly), that was fine.

We sat on the steps outside for a while, then decided that we wanted to go to 7-11 a few blocks away and get some supper, since it was about 11:30, and lunch had been quite a while ago.  Mariah came home at around 12:15, just as we were finishing chili dogs from the Tommy's beside the 7-11.  (Chili dog and hot chocolate.  Nice combination, no?)

If nothing else, the day was our first really good training walk for this year's breast cancer walk... we did about 9 miles (almost 15 km) over the course of the day.

Once we got inside, we ended up watching another episode of <i>Everwood</i> and not going to bed until almost 3.  Of course, the alarm went off at 5:30, since we had to leave for the airport by 6, but I was back home by 7:30 and in bed for a couple more hours of sleep before heading out for the rest of my day.  

Now Colin is back in Calgary, likely working on music by now.  He's planning to still take this week as a vacation of sorts and not go to the rehearsals that he's already planned to have covered by someone else, so he'll have enough time to really work on the show.  He might go back to work on Thursday and Friday (and save those two vacation days for some other time), but that'll partly depend on how the music is coming.  Even if he does, though, this is a ""days"" week for him, and it's always easier for him to get work done outside of work when he's on days, rather than nights.

So, like I said when we first decided to do this, it's the best decision.  He got a couple of days away from the work, and we got to spend some good, uninterrupted time together for a few days.  Easter weekend will be a little longer and a little busier, with a lot more people to see, but it was nice to have this interlude that was just us for a little less than 48 hours."

"event","CalArts has warped my perception of normal.  I've been touting <i>Borkman</i> as a great show to bring non-CalArtians on campus for, since it's relatively normal and not as bizarre as many shows we do here.

Linear storyline?  Character development?  Actors fully clothed?  Fairly consistent period costumes?  Proscenium staging?  Audience seated in chairs, in rows?  Plot development in traditional four-act structure?

Really, what more could people want?  So it doesn't have a living room onstage as the set, but who wants to see that kind of set design any more anyway?  That hasn't been current, in any kind of theatre, in quite some time now.

However, both my dad and Mariah said that it was good, but a little strange.  I think that had more to do with some of the sound design, the directorial choices, the staging, and the movement, but trust me, it's not <i>that</i> weird.

We also had a couple walk out of the performance one night.  I have no idea who they were, if they're someone's family or invited guests, or if they came through our advertising.  If they came through the advertising... well, no show will appeal to everyone, but I was really pushing the fact that this show has more of a mass appeal than most of what we do here.

Oh well.  Some people can enjoy theatre (and art) that pushes their preconceived ideas of what's ""normal,"" and some can't.  If they can't appreciate the art for its own sake, as opposed to how much they enjoy it, too bad for them.  Is that the kind of audience we want to be developing anyway?

(And I'm not watching it tonight; I'll see it on either Monday or Tuesday next week, and also on Saturday.)

Also, as small-town-paper as it is, we've got some <a href=""http://www.the-signal.com/news/article/10171/"">press coverage</a>.  There are a few mistakes--for instance, Maureen (the director) is in fact a student.  This show is her thesis.  Also, I'm not the assistant producer, nor am I a curator for this production.  That would be the Coffeehouse.  Things like that.  However, it's a story, which is cool.  It's publicity for the show, which is nice but not completely necessary, as we're already almost full, and it's more fodder for my portfolio.

I got a full set of acrylic nails for the run.  I'm not impressed.  The girl who did them did a shoddy job, and they don't look that great.  I really don't want to have them re-done elsewhere (and pay for a second set), but these ones look really crappy, so I might have to.  We'll see.

I like getting a manicure like this, that doesn't bite the dust as quickly as a regular nail-polish-only one, but it always kind of makes me sad to be able to have these longer nails for a while.  It means that I'm not playing the piano regularly, which was always the reason that I kept my nails short.  I keep my natural nails short these days because I really hate their shape, and the less I can draw attention to them, the better, but fake ones are different.

Here, have a few pictures of me all gussied up.  This isn't the greatest picture of this dress, which was borrowed from Mariah's closet and is a lovely deep purple.  It also has the tendency to make my legs look about 3 inches long, which is why I have to wear 4"" heels with it for it to look in any way flattering to the lower half of my body.

Also, please ignore the mess in my room, so thoroughly reflected in my full-length mirror.  Usually it's not that bad, I promise.

Anyway, I'm home now.  I don't have to be anywhere until the box office opens for tomorrow night's show.  (Yay!  No matinee!  I hate matinees.)  I'm going to clean, since Dad will want to sleep on my couch on Monday night, and I'm going to sleep in.  Especially since it's almost 2:30 a.m. now."

"event","So, my parents are pretty much awesome.

My dad's flying down on Monday to see my show (he'll fly in Monday morning and fly out Wednesday morning), and they're flying me to Calgary for Easter weekend as a birthday gift.  Yay!  I get to see Colin's show!  And spend my birthday weekend with him!  And Mom gets to have a family dinner!  (That was what Colin told me I should use as a selling point:  ""Your mom likes family dinners.  Tell her that she can have one for Easter and your birthday if they buy you a plane ticket."")

My mom and sister are still considering coming down for spring break, but that's still up in the air, pending my mom's permanent resident card and some decent flight prices."

"event","My prop master was laughing at me tonight when we were going down our list of things to do for the show, and my list was something like this:  proof the program, send the program to be printed, follow up on ticketing for group sales, prep the box office reports for each day, write the pre-show speech, get the opening night gifts from the management team, get a haircut, get my eyebrows done, get a manicure, make sure I have 9 dressy, professional outfits ready.

Yeah.  My to-do list before the show opens includes all my personal grooming and beauty stuff, since, as the producer, I'm at the show every night and I'm the face of the production to the audience.  I'm the one who has to look good when it's all happening, and if I don't look pulled together, it impacts the show's presentation.  Especially since we've invited a number of VIPs and bigwigs in the industry.  Who knows how many will show up, but regardless of who's there, I'm the first point of contact.  (Well, technically, the box office staff is, but I'm the first one that's specific to the show.)

Unfortunately, I can't expense my manicure to the show.  Dang."

"event","Has anyone seen <a href=""http://jimspages.com/States.htm"">this game</a> before?  It's a drag-and-drop state placement game, to see how well you can guesstimate where a state belongs on an unmarked map of the U.S.  Some states, of course, are easy, and the order that you get them in can determine some of your early errors, depending on what kinds of markers you get early in the game.

My first try, I got 86%, and my average misplacement was something like 70 or 80 miles.  My second try, I got 94%, placing all but three states in the right spot on the first try, and making my average error margin 10 miles.

I remember having a similar game as a kid--it wasn't exactly the same, but it was a computer game where we were given the outline of a state, without the context of a map, and we had to name it.  There was also one with state capitals.  I can remember doing fairly well on those... better than most of my classmates would have done, although we all knew the names of the states in alphabetical order, since, for some reason, we learned ""Fifty Nifty"" in grade 6 music.  I'm still not sure why, but we did.

Of course, these are the kinds of games that don't work nearly as well with a map of Canada, hey?  It's not nearly as difficult when you only have 13 options--12 when I was a kid!  Ooh--<a href=""http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/Canadian_Geography.htm"">here are some Canadian geography games</a>, though, including <a href=""javascript:openBrowSimpleScroll('canada_G1_drag_drop.html')"">the same kind of game</a>, and other games getting progressively more difficult.  Apparently they <i>do</i> work with Canadian geography; it's just a lot easier to get 100%."

"event","I love Bryan Fuller's shows; I think he's brilliant as a show-runner.

However, I have a theory.

Part of the reason that he's so brilliant is that his shows always get canceled too early.  <i>Wonderfalls</i> was 13 episodes, 4 aired.  <i>Dead Like Me</i> was two short seasons and a movie.  <i>Pushing Daisies</i> is two short seasons.

And as tragic as that is, and as much as I'd love to see his shows last longer, they never have the chance to jump the shark.  The plot devices don't have time to get old; the premises don't get worn out; the original, fresh storylines that are the impetus for the beginning of the show aren't played out; the characters don't have the chance to become something different than what they were in the beginning.

In that short a time--30 episodes or less, basically--the shows can remain these encapsulated moments of brilliance, and the showrunner is never faced with the challenge of sustaining the world created in the show for a long period of time.  I mean, any show that runs for more than a season faces a weak season; a show, no matter how brilliant, can't sustain the same level forever.  <i>Gilmore Girls</i>, <i>Veronica Mars</i>, <i>Heroes</i>, <i>Ugly Betty</i>, <i>Everwood</i>, <i>Joan of Arcadia</i> -- those are just the ones off the top of my head that I've watched recently, but each of them has strong seasons and weak ones, and each of them has storylines that are generally considered to be weaker than the others.  (And, incidentally, each of those shows had first seasons that were widely considered to be exceptionally strong.)  Individual fans' favorites may differ, of course, but the fact is, when a show runs past the initial premise, there are going to be developments that don't work as well as others.

So, as much as I think it's tragic that <i>Pushing Daisies</i> is being canceled early, and as much as I would have loved to see some of these shows go on and live longer, maybe it's not completely a bad thing.  I'd love to see how Bryan Fuller would do as a long-term showrunner, and how he would carry a show through multiple seasons, but at the same time, the circumstances a) allow his reputation as an excellent showrunner to be preserved, and b) allow the various ideas floating around in his head to see the light of day, in one way or another.

What do you think?"

<center><u>25 Random Things About Me</u></center>

<ol><li>  I like to tell people that I knew I'd marry Colin the day he brought homemade chocolates to rehearsal a couple of months before we started dating.  Any man who could make that kind of chocolate was someone I wanted to be with.</li>

<li>  One of my biggest pet peeves is inconsiderate audience behavior.  I know that it's irrational to expect that people have an innate sense of how to act if they haven't been taught, but it bothers me anyway, and I expect better.</li>

<li>  Related to #2, Colin and I will laugh at you if you're sitting near us and you exhibit poor etiquette.  We usually end up sitting near someone who makes really random, dumb comments during a play or a movie, and it provides us with endless entertainment.  We're still laughing at an incident that happened in June, 2007.</li>

<li>  I love living in L.A., and I'll be sad to leave here next December, but I also love living in a city that I know inside out.  I know a lot of random trivia about Calgary, and I make a great tour guide.  Still, I'll miss having a reason to become more familiar with L.A.--at least until we move back here.</li>

<li>  If I had to choose, I'm not sure whether I'd choose to live in New York or L.A.  There are things that I love about both, and they have such different personalities that it's almost impossible to compare them.</li>

<li>  I'm not a nervous flier.  I can easily sleep through takeoff and landing, and a normal amount of turbulence doesn't bother me.  I used to get mildly nauseated during landing, but even that doesn't happen any more.  I also tend not to get stressed out at the airport, going through customs and security, and planning the time to make my flight.  I've done it so often, I just go with the flow.</li>

<li>  My family teases me about my ""soapboxes,"" especially relating to the arts.  I get very passionate about them, and will often lecture my family at length during family dinners, even though they're not usually the ones who need to hear it.  They all roll their eyes at me; Colin joins me and we tag-team lecture everyone else about the arts.  This is why we're perfect for each other.</li>

<li>  I've filed taxes in both Canada and the U.S. since 2005, not having worked an entire calendar year since then in only one country.  2010 may be the first year that I only work in Canada.  I've never had a year where I've only had one T4 or W-2; I've always worked for more than one employer.</li>

<li>  I watch TV differently since I started posting on TWoP.  These days, I'm not involved in online fandoms the same way I was with <i>Gilmore Girls</i>, and I don't spend as much time in the analysis and discussion of any show, but I watch in a different way than I used to.  However, that's also due to my theatre background and to dating someone who is in the television industry.</li>

<li>  I don't think that TV is an inferior, brain-rotting form of entertainment, despite my parents' opinions of it when I was growing up.  I think that a balanced TV and movie intake is just as important as reading, current events, theatre and other performing arts, visual arts, and a general observation of the world around.</li>

<li>  It's vastly important to me that my future kids are very exposed to the arts.  I don't know what I'll do if they don't develop a healthy, strong, passionate appreciation for the arts, even if they're not artists themselves.  Guess I'll just have to learn to deal with it.</li>

<li>  When I tell an American that I'm from Calgary, without clarifying that it's in Canada, and they don't know where it is, my esteem for them drops a few points.  If they can come back with something about the city (even if they only know that the Olympics were held there), it rises a few points.</li>

<li>  Colin and I will sit through the credits of every movie we watch in a theatre.  It's partly because we want to start to develop familiarity with names that we may work with in some capacity someday, but it's also a professional courtesy.  On the TV shows that Colin works on, his name is toward the end of the credits; it's our courtesy to the people whose names are at the end of a movie's credits to make sure someone sees them.  Also, I get very irritated when people don't read the entire program of a show that I do, so it's my way of reciprocating.</li>

<li>  I enjoy doing memes like this because it feeds into my delusion that I'm fascinating and that people actually care about the minutiae of my life.</li>

<li>  I'm of the firm opinion that mayo is far superior to ketchup as a fry condiment.</li>

<li>  Having grown up near the Rockies, I have specific criteria for what constitutes a ""mountain.""  It must have snow on the peaks all year, there must be no trees on top (because there's a lack of oxygen), it must be pointy, and it's not possible to go over or around--it had to have been blasted through with dynamite in order to have a road there.  I laugh when people talk about going ""over the mountain"" to the next town, because that's clearly not a real mountain.  It's a hill.</li>

<li>  I pick up the speech patterns and rhythms of whoever I'm talking to, but I don't pick up random accents.  It's more that there are certain people I talk faster when I'm around, and certain words, phrases, and rhythms that I'll pick up.</li>

<li>  I'm passionate about faith-based theater and making it a viable art form in the mainstream, but also I'm very skeptical when other Christians tell me about their shows.  My default philosophy seems to be ""Cheesy Christian art until proven otherwise,"" and it makes me very sad that art done by Christians tends to be 30 years behind the rest of the field.</li>

<li>  Growing up, I loved being the oldest child, and I still harbor a secret belief that I was my parents' favorite.  :)</li>

<li>  I was single when I applied to grad school, but I'm not entirely sure I would have gone if I'd been single by the time the decision came around.  I don't know that for sure, but I do know that Colin was a big part of my decision to move down here, and I think I might have talked myself out of it.</li>

<li>  I can easily spend 8 hours or more sitting in a coffee shop with my laptop, a book, and some music.  I tend to get more work done at Starbucks than I do either at home or in my school office, but there's still the potential for distraction, thanks to wireless internet.  However, I'm not being distracted by a) my bed or b) other people in the office.</li>

<li>  I rarely eat at the table at home.  Usually, I'll be sitting on the couch or in my bed, leaning up against the headboard.  I see very little point in being more formal than that when it's just me.</li>

<li>  I talk out loud to myself constantly, and I often talk to other people when I'm alone, especially when I'm driving.  I have the conversations that are coming up, thinking about what I want to say; I have conversations that I've already had, saying what I wish I'd said; and I explain things to people, trying to make it as clear and thorough as possible.</li>

<li>  The most surprising (to me) thing to come out of grad school so far is an interest in municipal public policy affecting the arts, and the way that the arts define culture within an urban area.  I was never really interested in that before, but I've become very intrigued by the interplay between the cultural industries and their surroundings.  That's a big part of why Colin and I will likely never live anywhere smaller than Calgary--both of our careers need a city with a thriving arts scene, and it's hard to find one that can sustain us in a small city.

<li>  I actually knew within 6 weeks of when we started dating that Colin and I would get married someday.  The grad school decision was made around that time, and I knew that if he was going to be a part of that journey, it wasn't casual, and it was going to result in marriage.  It took him slightly longer to figure it out, but he still knew within the first 3 months or so.  From that point on, there was (and still is) a lot to learn about each other and a lot of growth together, but breaking up became, and has remained, as much a non-option as divorce would ever be.</li>"

"event","Random (related to a conversation in the Dragonfly a while back about mixing up celebrities with similar names):

I always think of Danny Strong when I see Danny Boyle's name, and I have to remind myself that it's not the same person.  I think it's because I associate Danny Strong with Doyle on GG, and Boyle is just similar enough that I confuse them, especially given that they've both had acclaim for recent projects (<i>Recount</i> and <i>Slumdog Millionaire</i>, respectively)."

"event","I smell like I've been in bed all day.  Probably because I have been.  On the bright side, the chicken soup I ate for supper is staying down quite nicely, and maybe I've kicked this thing.  And I really need to shower before I crawl back into bed for the night.

I've booked Colin's flight down here for March.  It doesn't look like I'll be going to Calgary for spring break, mostly because he works nights that week, so it would be kind of pointless since I'd hardly see him anyway.  He'll be down here for the full week before spring break, though, so at least we'll have a week together and he'll get the vacation time.  I still have to keep an eye out for his flight back to Calgary, but at least he'll get down here, which is the important part, right?  ;o)  (You mean it <i>wouldn't</i> go over so well if I kidnapped him and kept him here?  Too bad.)

I'm watching the first few episodes of <i>Being Erica</i>.  Cute show.  Someone in the Dragonfly (<lj user=""insanityjones"">, maybe?) said that it has sort of a <i>Wonderfalls</i> feel to it, which I can see.  Doesn't hurt that Tyron Leitso is in it, but the similarities go beyond that.  I'm remarkably impressed--maybe Canadian TV is finally catching up?  (Oh, Canadian art, which is so far behind...)  Also, Erin Karpluk kind of looks like Alyson Hannigan.  I don't notice it so much in stills, but in motion, there are distinct similarities.

There are some distinctly Canadian phrases (""I was in my second year of university,"" in particular) that reminded me of a conversation I had before Christmas.  I was talking to an American and a Brit, and the American commented that Brits and Canadians take out the ""the"" before certain words; for instance, ""going to university"" or ""going to hospital.""

The Brit agreed, but I had to protest, saying that any Canadian I know would never say, ""Going to hospital;"" like Americans, we'd say, ""Going to the hospital.""  As for the use of ""university""...

Americans refer to all post-secondary education as ""college.""  Whether you're going to Harvard or Murray's House of Learning (thanks, Jackson), it's referred to as ""going to college.""  There are, of course, the distinctions between junior college, two-year college, state school, private university, Ivy League, etc, but in general, the language used is that, when you're finished high school, you go to college.

In Canada, there's a distinction made between going to college and going to university.  If you're going to, well, a university, you go to university after high school.  If not, you go to college, which could refer to a technical school, a trade school, a Bible college, a community college, and so on.  I have an accredited Bachelor's degree, but because my school wasn't specifically a university, I say that I went to college.

So, no, I wouldn't say that I'm ""going to university"" in the same way that someone might say that he's ""going to hospital.""  If I was going to the physical location of the university, I'd say ""the,"" just like I'd say ""the"" if I was going to the hospital (I'm going to the university to study; I'm going to the hospital to get my gallbladder removed).  I'd also say, if I was, for instance, a student at the U of C, that I was a student at <i>the</i> University of Calgary.  However, in the broad sense of going to university to get an education, there's no ""the.""

(Also, Canadians don't talk about our freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years.  We refer to our post-secondary years as the first year, second year, third year, and fourth year.  Which, incidentally, CalArts kind of does, too.  We're referred to as BFA1, BFA2, BFA3, BFA4, MFA1, MFA2, or MFA3s.)

(And also, in another scene, Erica talks about being in grade eleven, which is also quite Canadian, as opposed to saying ""eleventh grade."")

Anyway.  That was a kind of pointless diatribe.

Oh, when I booked Colin's flight, the confirmation screen (after I'd paid) showed a different total than the emailed receipt.  I printed out the confirmation page and I have the receipt in my email, so I'll check the credit card in a couple of days to see how much it was charged for and contest it if I have to.  Weird."

"event","I really love GMail's new ""send and archive"" feature.  It's amazing how happy it makes me to skip the step of archiving a conversation after I've replied to it.  Hitting one button and doing both is so much more convenient, especially since my inbox is only for emails that I haven't dealt with yet, so once I've responded (or taken other appropriate action), an email gets archived.

Lazy?  Perhaps.  But it's so handy--how did I ever live without it?

"event","I suppose I should give the addendum to the Ugly Santa debacle from the Christmas party.

That night, Esther and I were talking about going to Starbucks together so she could get the mug that she'd wanted and that Nancy had ended up with, while I was still in town and could give her my discount.

It didn't work out that week, and by Friday, when she was on her way out of town and I was leaving before she got back, I ended up at Starbucks on my own (which is another story, in which I was stood up for coffee with a friend), but I had to leave before Esther could make it over there.  I offered to buy the mug for her, and she could pay me back, and she told me that I should buy two mugs because she felt so bad that I'd gotten stuck with her crappy gift at the gift exchange--not realizing that it wasn't actually a white elephant crappy gift exchange in the first place.

So, I bought two mugs, and that night, Colin and I ended up at Esther and Justin's house, where I got a Starbucks mug, purchased with my employee discount, as my replacement gift from the gift exchange.  I'm very happy with it (one can never have too many good-quality travel mugs), and rather amused by the whole story.

Ugly Santa is still lying in wait for next Christmas, though..."

"event","I was at a Christmas party last night that included a gift exchange.  It wasn't really a white elephant exchange; the gifts were mostly nice, useable things (a picture frame, a set of mixing bowls, a Starbucks mug, a bottle of wine, a gigantic chocolate bar, etc).  This wasn't the ""wrap a roll of duct tape and can of Spam"" kind of gift exchange, although those are fun in their own way.<sup>1</sup>

I was the second one to pick a gift, and the one that I happened to open was a Lindt chocolate snowman (not bad) and the ugliest Santa candle I've ever seen... and I knew as soon as I opened it that I'd be taking the ugly Santa candle home.  No one would want to steal that gift from me--and I was right.  My fate was determined in the first round of gifts, and that's exactly what I ended up with.

It wasn't until afterwards that I discovered that my very own sister had brought that gift, regifting some items from a gift basket, and didn't even warn me when I was about to pick it up!  I didn't get a well-timed cough or a glare or anything!  She just let me unwrap to my ugly-Santa-candled doom.

So guess what she's getting in her stocking next Christmas?

However, there are two ways to win at a gift exchange.  One is to take home the best present (or the one you want most).  The second is to have brought the most sought after gift--the one that's stolen the most often, desired by most people, and causes most disappointment for the ones who don't get it.  In that part of the game, I totally won.

I took a Starbucks travel mug (one of the ones with a coupon for a free drink) and a pound of coffee, and it flew back and forth across the room a number of times before finally ending up in Colin's mom's possession.

Also sweetening our overall win of the evening, Colin came away with a brie baker, which we'd actually been wanting to get anyway.  I'd seen one a week or so ago, and contemplated buying it, but didn't, and we were actually looking at it again yesterday afternoon.  When someone else opened it, I knew it was pointless for me to try and steal it, because no one was going to steal my crappy gift away from me, but Colin did some clever maneuvering and managed to end up with it, so bonus points for us there.

Still.  Ugly Santa is totally going in Esther's stocking next Christmas.




<sup>1</sup>  I saw an article this Christmas with the best White Elephant gifts, and my favorite was to take an empty gift bag, and when you get to the party, take someone's purse from wherever people are storing their coats and put it in the gift bag.  I have no idea where I saw that article, so if someone reading this entry linked to it, you get credit for this suggestion."

"event","So, I'm hanging out in an office today, doing a temp job that's very slow.  As in, I'm the only one here, the phone has rung once today, and there were three pieces of mail to ""sort.""  As such, I have all kinds of time on my hands.  I've already made two posters for Coffeehouse stuff in January, and I'll do more this afternoon, but in the meantime, I feel a meme coming on.  It's an old one that's circulated the internet for years, but who cares, right?

<lj-cut text=""Peel away.  I'm an onion.""><b>LAYER ONE:</b>
<i>-- Name:</i>  Alida Ruth
<i>-- Birth date:</i>  April 9
<i>-- Birthplace:</i>  Calgary
<i>-- Current Location:</i>  Right now?  Sitting in an office in Calgary.  Where I live?  L.A.
<i>-- Eye Color:</i>  Blue
<i>-- Hair Color:</i>  Brown.  Right now, a dark chestnut.  Sometimes it's other shades.
<i>-- Height:</i>  5'5""
<i>-- Righty or Lefty:</i>  Righty
<i>-- Zodiac Sign:</i>  Aries

<b>LAYER TWO:</b>
<i>-- Your heritage:</i>  Mostly Swedish, with a little bit of English in there.
<i>-- The shoes you wore today:</i>  Black runners.  I'm going to change into heeled boots later, but I didn't wear them this morning.  I'm ticked off at this snow, though, because it means that I can't wear half the shoes I brought with me.  Cute flats (or cute heels, for that matter) + many inches of snow on the ground = no good.  Blah.
<i>-- Your weakness:</i>  Um.  French fries?
<i>-- Your fears:</i>  Getting the car stuck in a snowdrift.  Seriously, I'm good at that.  Two winters ago, I don't know <i>how</i> many times I got stuck.  None yet this year, though!
<i>-- Your perfect pizza:</i>  Y'know, I'm not really that picky.  I like most kinds of pizza.  
<i>-- Goal you'd like to achieve:</i>  Finishing grad school.  Making a living in the arts.  Having a family.  Raising our kids well.  Being a godly wife.

<b>LAYER THREE:</b>
<i>-- Your most overused phrase on AIM:</i>  AIM?  I haven't used that in years.
<i>-- Your first waking thoughts:</i>  ""How many times can I hit the snooze button before I absolutely have to get up?""
<i>-- Your best physical feature:</i>  My smile.  My legs (well, calves, at least.  My thighs are nothing spectacular).  My eyes.
<i>-- Your most missed memory:</i>  How can you miss a memory?  You can miss the event that you're remembering, but if you miss a memory, you've forgotten it, and it's no longer a memory.  Right?

<b>LAYER FOUR:</b>
<i>-- Pepsi or Coke:</i>  Coke.  Diet Coke, actually.
<i>-- McDonald's or Burger King:</i>  McDonald's, usually.
<i>-- Single or group dates:</i>  Both in their time.  These days, I'm antsing for a single date, since we haven't had one since I got into town two weeks ago.  However, I love double dating with good friends.  It's always nice to have a night out with another couple.
<i>-- Adidas or Nike:</i>  I really don't care.
<i>-- Lipton Ice Tea or Nestea:</i>  Nestea.  Lipton tastes too artificial.
<i>-- Chocolate or vanilla:</i>  Generally chocolate.
<i>-- Cappuccino or coffee:</i>  Depends on my mood.  I usually go for a latte over brewed coffee when I'm at work, but brewed coffee if I'm having a cup with dessert or something.

<b>LAYER FIVE:</b>
<i>-- Smoke:</i>  Nope.  Never.
<i>-- Cuss:</i>  Rarely.  I use a few mild ones every now and then, but I'm not a potty mouth.
<i>-- Sing:</i>  Of course.  In the car or on stage.  Doesn't matter.
<i>-- Take a shower everyday:</i>  Most days.  I don't wash my hair every day, though.  This cut actually works nicely for about 3 days after I straighten it, and the less I wash it (within reason, of course), the healthier it stays and the longer the color sticks around.
<i>-- Do you think you've been in love:</i>  I <i>know</i> I've been in love.  Am in love.  Present tense.
<i>-- Want to go to college:</i>  Well, since I've already finished one degree and am halfway through a second, sure.  I don't know that I want to go back after I'm done this one, though.
<i>-- Liked high school:</i>  Yeah, I enjoyed it.  I was on student council, one of the main drama students, and enjoyed my classes and teachers.  I wouldn't want to be 18 again, but I liked it while I was there.
<i>-- Want to get married:</i>  Uh, do you know me?
<i>-- Believe in yourself:</i>  Sometimes.  It depends on the day.  Colin believes in me more than I do sometimes, and he boosts me when I need it.
<i>-- Get motion sickness:</i>  Rarely.  I got kind of sick this summer when we were driving up the coast, but that's the first time in years.
<i>-- Think you're attractive:</i>  Moreso now than I did a few years ago.  But generally, yes, I think I'm attractive.  Not gorgeous, but attractive.
<i>-- Think you're a health freak:</i>  Ha!  No.  I eat way too much fast food and exercise too little to be a health nut.
<i>-- Get along with your parent(s):</i>  More now than I did when I was a teenager (but isn't that the way it always goes?).  We get along fairly well, and I get along with Colin's parents really well, too.
<i>-- Like thunderstorms:</i>  Definitely.
<i>-- Play an instrument:</i>  Piano.  I wish I played more, but I haven't learned any yet.  Colin got a violin and some self-instruction books for Christmas so he can learn (stringed instruments are the one family he doesn't play).  I told him I was going to steal it and try to learn, too.

<b>LAYER SIX: In the past month...</b>
<i>-- Drank alcohol:</i>  I can't remember.  I don't think so, but I could have had a glass of wine that I'm forgetting about.
<i>-- Smoked:</i>  Nope.
<i>-- Done a drug:</i>  Does ColdFX count?
<i>-- Made Out:</i>  Nope.
<i>-- Gone on a date:</i>  Yes, although not by ourselves (see: double dates).
<i>-- Gone to the mall?:</i>  It's five days after Christmas.  Of course I've been to the mall recently, both hitting the before-Christmas shopping and the Boxing Day sales.
<i>-- Eaten an entire box of Oreos?:</i>  Nope.  I don't think I've ever done that in one sitting.  Eaten an entire box by myself over time?  Sure, but not all at once.
<i>-- Eaten sushi:</i>  Yes!  I'd been craving it for ages, and Colin doesn't like it, so his parents took me out for sushi last week.
<i>-- Been on stage:</i>  Several times.  Four performances of Christmas concerts, a couple of Sunday morning services, singing special music at Adam's church.  I think that's it in the past month.
<i>-- Been dumped:</i>  Heh.  No.  That's something I'm planning to never have to deal with again.
<i>-- Gone skating:</i>  Nope.  It's been a few years since I went skating--I think that the last time was when I lived in NYC and the Forefront ladies went to Bryant Park.
<i>-- Made homemade cookies:</i>  Eaten homemade cookies?  Yes.  Made them?  No, although I've made other homemade foodstuffs.
<i>-- Gone skinny dipping:</i>  It'd be a little chilly, dontcha think?
<i>-- Dyed your hair:</i>  Yup.  I did it just before I came to Calgary.
<i>-- Stolen Anything:</i>  Nope.

<b>LAYER SEVEN: Ever...</b>
<i>-- Played a game that required removal of clothing:</i>  Yes.
<i>-- Been trashed or extremely intoxicated:</i>  Nope.  Slightly buzzed, but only once--I don't drink enough to get drunk.
<i>-- Been caught ""doing something"":</i>  Nope.
<i>-- Been called a tease:</i>  Yes.
<i>-- Gotten beaten up:</i>  Nope.
<i>-- Shoplifted:</i>  When I was a kid.  I took some candy from the bulk bins, and my mom not only made me pay the store for it, but I had to pay her a dollar for each piece.  That ate up my allowance for a few weeks.
<i>-- Changed who you were to fit in:</i>  A little.  I think we all adapt to our surroundings to some extent.  Changed myself in major ways?  No.

<b>LAYER EIGHT:</b>
<i>-- Age you hope to be married:</i>  27 would be really nice.
<i>-- Numbers and Names of Children:</i>  Probably 2 or 3, depending.  We know the name for our first boy, but nothing else yet--all the other names are still just ideas being tossed around.  However, I did tell Colin that I want one baby to be born at the end of November or beginning of December so that we have a baby that's the right size to play Baby Jesus one year.
<i>-- Describe your Dream Wedding:</i>  In how much detail?  We want it to reflect who we are very intentionally, so it'll incorporate very specific elements of film, theatre, and music.  It's a celebration of a covenant we're making with God, and that will be very clearly a part of the day.  It'll be a celebration of the people we're surrounded by and the ways that they've gotten us to where we are.  And, while we're not militant about having all ideas that no one else has dreamed of, we still want it to be individual and unique, so we're trying to avoid some of the cliches.
<i>-- How do you want to die:</i>  After a long, full, rich life.
<i>-- Where you want to go to college:</i>  Haven't we already established that this decision is many years in the past?
<i>-- What do you want to be when you grow up:</i>  Heh.  A millionaire?
<i>-- What country would you most like to visit:</i>  Oh, there are too many.  These days, I generally enjoy visiting Canada.  There's some extra incentive, though.

<b>LAYER NINE:</b>
<i>-- Number of drugs taken illegally:</i>  None.
<i>-- Number of people I could trust with my life:</i>  A few.
<i>-- Number of CDs that I own:</i>  I don't know--I haven't had CDs anywhere but the car for a number of years.  Everything's on my computer these days.
<i>-- Number of piercings:</i>  Seven.  Three in each ear and one in my belly button.  I used to have my nose pierced, but not anymore.
<i>-- Number of tattoos:</i>  One.  A sunflower on my shoulder blade.
<i>-- Number of times my name has appeared in the newspaper?:</i>  Many.  I grew up in a small town where things like the honor roll and other school accomplishments were printed in the newspaper.
<i>-- Number of scars on my body:</i>  A few.  Nothing big, but there are a bunch of little ones all over the place.  Shaving nicks on my legs, a chicken pox scar on my lower back--stuff like that.
<i>-- Number of things in my past that I regret:</i>  A few.  They all made me who I am today, though, so while I might change some of them if I had the opportunity, I'm kind of glad I don't have the chance.</lj-cut>"

"event","Generally, I'm quite a good packer.  I can Tetris things together so that they fit in the car (or trailer, or suitcase)--a skill I inherited from my father.  I can pack light and travel with no checked luggage.  I can find a way to organize my cupboards so that everything fits.

At Christmas, though, that all seems to go out the window.  For any other trip of the year, I only take a carry-on suitcase.  That's sufficient for a weekend, absolutely, or for a week or even two, depending on the time of year.  Summer, yes.  Winter, no.  (Sweaters are too bulky.)  When we went to Europe, I did almost two months out of the carry-on suitcase.  But this time of year... ah, sigh.  My packing skills take a turn for the worse.

I check two bags (granted, one of them is the carry-on size suitcase, so maybe I'm not as far gone as some, who would check two large suitcases) and have two carry-ons--my laptop bag/briefcase and my backpack.  That gives me a fair amount of space to work with, and it's the one trip where I have to get a baggage cart at the airport, because just dragging it all down to the front door to meet the cab is a feat.

Granted, presents take up quite a bit of room.  This year, I had the advantage of an extra trip two weeks ago, so I took up a bunch of gifts then, still only using the carry-on.  If I wasn't taking them, I could have almost packed in a backpack, since three days doesn't require much in the way of clothes.  There's a large tote bag sitting in Colin's closest with half the family's presents in it.

Still, there were a few that were too big for the small suitcase, and a few that I've purchased or had shipped since then, so that's a bit of space.

The biggest thing, though, is that I have to pack for <i>everything</i>.  Casual, dressy, semi-formal, and this year, I'm working, so I'm adding business casual to that.  Of course, I'm not under the illusion that I have to pack enough clothes for four weeks.  I'll do laundry several times while I'm there--and, in fact, I'll likely do laundry just before I come back so that I can unpack directly into the dresser instead of into the washing machine.

When I packed for Europe, a) it was summer, and clothes were a lot lighter, but more significantly, b) I packed 2 skirts, 1 pair of capris, 1 pair of pants, 1 sweatshirt, 1 long-sleeved shirt, 1 pair of pyjamas, and a bunch of t-shirts, which roll up nice and tiny.  Oh, and one dress.  When traveling around, mostly in casual scenarios, that's very feasible.  I was sick of those clothes by the end of the two months, but they were sufficient.

For four weeks in Calgary, though, that's not nearly enough.  And then, of course, I fall into the ""but I don't know exactly what I'll want to wear!"" trap.  Do I need three pairs of heels (I think I'm taking... 7, maybe? pairs of shoes total)?  Well, I'll probably wear them all at some point.  In fact, I'm quite sure I will, because I'm thinking of specific outfits for specific occasions.  However, I could probably get away with one pair and plan the outfits around that.  (But that's not nearly as much fun!)

All this to say, I'm almost finished packing.  I haven't packed my carry-on bags at all, but those will be fairly easy (as long as I don't forget anything like, say, my keys to Colin's house or my passport).  I'll do one last load of laundry on Monday, just so that I'm not leaving any dirty clothes sitting in my hamper for a month, and there are a few last things I'll toss in then, but mostly, it's finished.

One concert down; two to go.  Tomorrow, the choir sings in both morning services and then has both matinee and evening performances.  Long day, but we get a couple of hours in between church and our call time.  I live about 25 minutes from church, so there's not really any point in coming home for an hour and then going back, but I'll probably take a book (and laptop) and go sit in Starbucks in between.

Monday, last-minute packing and cleaning, a meeting at school, and more Christmas cards to write (there are a few more that need to be mailed before I leave the country, and I'd like to have the Canadian ones written so I can mail them in time to get to people before Christmas Day), but that's about it.  And then... Tuesday, my flight leaves at 7:30 AM, so it'll be a ridiculously early morning, but that sets the stage for a good afternoon nap."

"event","I brought my car in to get an oil change this morning, knowing that there was a leak in the transmission gasket, and it would need more than just the oil change.  Fine.

They told me that the oil change would take about 2 hours, so I walked over to Target (about 10 minutes away) to get an eye exam and pick up a few necessities.  They called after the 2 hours, just as I was finishing my lunch, saying that the oil was done, but it would be another 2 hours for the transmission.  Okay, that's fine.  I hadn't done my shopping yet, and I figured I could kill that much time in Target.  It's about a 30-minute walk home from there, so I could have walked home, been there for an hour or so, and then walked back, or I could just sit around Target.

After about an hour and a half, I walked back to the shop, noticed that my car was still inside, and kept going to the Wendy's, where I sat down with a book and a Frosty for about half an hour.

It's now been about 3 1/4 hours since the second 2-hour estimate, and I'm sitting in the shop's waiting area.  Fortunately, it's right next door to a Staples, which has a wireless hotspot, and I had the presence of mind to bring my laptop with me, so I'm doing some homework, and I think I can manage to kill whatever time is left."

"event","I have two stories to tell today:

Before I left for Thanksgiving, I ordered a few things off of Amazon--namely, part of Colin's Christmas gift (which I'm not going to name here, since he occasionally reads this) and a couple of books for thesis research.

I didn't figure they'd come over the weekend, but I'd forgotten that Thursday was the only day without mail service, and when I got back, the tracking said that it had been delivered on Friday.  The only problem was, Friday was the day that overlapped Mariah and I both being out of town, and the package was nowhere to be found.  When USPS delivers a package that doesn't need to be signed for, they usually leave it outside our apartment door, and we pick it up when we get home.  No big deal.  However, with both of us out of town, it went missing.  I'm guessing that a neighbor took it, but I really don't know anyone in our building, so I didn't have anyone to ask, and, of course, I didn't want to go door to door accusing people of stealing my mail.

I left notes on the doors of our immediate neighbors, asking if they'd happened to notice it and pick it up for safekeeping, but didn't get a response from either, so I emailed Amazon, asking about a replacement.  I figured that I'd have to spend some time on the phone with customer service and that I'd have to fight to get a replacement, or somehow prove that I hadn't actually gotten the package.

Within 12 hours, I got an email back, saying that they'd processed a replacement order for me, and that they were upgrading the shipping on the second one.

I realize that they must have policies in place and they probably deal with complaints like that all the time (and I'm sure a certain number of people use it to scam the company and get duplicates), but I was so impressed with how quickly it was dealt with and how little hassle.  One email.  That was it, and my replacement package is on the way and will be here well before I leave for Christmas.

Amazon FTW!


Story #2 is a random, cool, ""it's a small world"" story (because really, do I have any other kind of story?).

<lj-cut text=""Strange, convoluted family relations"">On Saturday afternoon, Colin and I were at his Grammy and Grampy's house, picking up some music, and we spent a few minutes catching up on life and everything.  We mentioned all the concerts that they'd gone to, and got onto the topic of Dawn and Glenn, and how crazy-small the world is, in terms of their moving to Calgary and Dawn taking over the music program at Rocky.

Grammy said that they'd been thinking of going to the RMC concert on Friday night (the night after we went), and said something about her cousin, Dan [last name].  I said to Colin, as kind of an aside, ""That's Aaron's uncle,"" and then it all started clicking, and we spent the next five minutes making connections of the people that we know and are related to.

Grammy is first cousins to Aaron's uncle and father, which means that Aaron's grandfather is Grammy's uncle, and that (through adoption), Colin and Aaron are cousins.

As for the adoption part of the story, Grammy and Grampy aren't Colin's biological grandparents.  Grammy and Colin's maternal grandmother were best friends and the two families had always considered each other family (Colin's mom has always considered his Aunt Judy her sister, ever since Judy's birth); after Colin's grandmother died (when Colin's mom was 19), Grammy and Grampy unofficially adopted her as a daughter and became even more the parent figures in her life as an adult (rather than aunt and uncle that they were when she was a kid), and so they were the only grandparents that Colin knew, and their children are basically Colin's aunts and uncles.

So, by unofficial adoption, Colin and Aaron are second cousins once removed.  Colin is a third cousin to Jake, Kayla, and Gabe.  Aaron is a second cousin (for real, not by adoption) to Grammy and Grampy's kids, Colin's honorary aunts and uncles.

Which means that, in a roundabout way, once Colin and I get married, Kat and I will kinda-sorta be cousins-in-law.  And as she said when we told her, ""So, since we're family now, does that mean I have to get you a better Christmas present?""</lj-cut>"

"event","Goodness.  I haven't posted a real summary of the weekend yet.  I was too busy getting over the cold that I caught from Colin that he caught from Jakob.

It was a busy weekend (surprise, surprise), but a really good way to officially kick off the Christmas season.  Thursday night, we went to Rocky Mountain College's Christmas concert (you know, with the whole ""small world"" thing with the director, who was the director at my church in California last year), and Friday and Saturday, Colin, Mom, and Dad sang in Ambrose's production of <i>Messiah</i>.  Saturday afternoon, we went to a baby shower for Scott, Heather, and Martin; Sunday, we went to church in the morning, and then had two rehearsals in the afternoon before heading off to the airport.  And somewhere in there (mostly after midnight), we still managed to find time to finish watching the first season of <i>Arrested Development</i>, which we'd started at Canadian Thanksgiving but not finished.

And, of course, there was the time with Kat, Aaron, and the kids, but that's already been well-photographed and posted about.  :)

<lj-cut text=""A review of sorts of AUC's production of 'Messiah'""><i>Messiah</i> was good, overall, but disappointing in places.  The first, biggest, thing was that it was held in the gym of the college that was hosting it.  That wasn't the director's choice, but the school just built a brand-new campus, so of course the administration wanted the Christmas concert to show it off.  Unfortunately, there's not a large enough concert hall for the event, so they set up the gym.

The sound was quite good, and it didn't have the terrible acoustics that most gyms have, but the aesthetic was <i>terrible</i>.  The mood and formality of the event was really compromised by having it in the venue that they did.  I get why the administration wanted it there; I'm also completely on the director's side, who has said that he's going to fight to make sure it never happens in that location again.  It's why I <i>will not</i> have my wedding reception in a community hall or something similar.  No matter how much you try to dress it up, it still looks like a high-school dance, and that's an aesthetic that isn't appropriate for a concert like that.

The Saturday night concert was a sing-along, which I was really excited about, but it was far from meeting my expectations.

Last year, Jenny and I went to a sing-along <i>Messiah</i> with the L.A. Master Chorale at the Walt Disney Concert Hall (which is one of the world's best concert venues).  Of course, right there, if I'm comparing the two, there's a problem.  Heh.  However, the issue went far beyond the size and stature of the event.  At the one we were at last year, there was no choir.  There was the orchestra, four soloists, and the conductor, and the audience, most of whom had come prepared to sing, were the choir.  It was fantastic, great fun, and really, really interactive.

The way that Ambrose did it, the concert went on as usual, the exception being the fact that the audience was invited to bring (or borrow) a score and sing along.  However, there wasn't much interaction with it, and people didn't really come expecting to sing.  Because the concert was with two college choirs (and a community choir), there were too many parents and family members who were just there to see their kids.  Not enough people wanted to sing.

I think it would have been significantly better if the choir had been planted in the audience for the sing-along.  80 choir members in an audience of 400 would go a long way to build enthusiasm for the sing-along part, and then the conductor wouldn't be focused towards the choir, but could be toward the audience.  Also, Colin made the point that, as a choir member, he felt like the audience's attention was divided on the Saturday night, since we (at least those of us who were singing) weren't fully there to see/hear the choir, but to participate in it ourselves.

But, as I said, the music was very good.  It was very accessible for a classical concert; the soloists were obviously trained, but not too operatic for the average audience member to enjoy.  There was the unfortunate incident of a few college freshmen in the back row who haven't quite figured out ""concert behavior"" and just about made me keel over from laughing so hard during the Saturday night show.  One of the guys in the back row yawned--huge--and stretched just as the bass soloist started singing.  Exactly the same moment.  It was like the moment in <i>Lion King</i> where Simba roars, but it's really Mufasa behind him making the noise.  The kid didn't bother to cover his mouth, keep from stretching, stay fully seated (he kind of rose halfway out of his seat)... it was hilarious, in a ""how can you possibly think this is appropriate onstage behavior?"" kind of way.  It's like they forgot that people could see them when they weren't actually singing.  Seriously, I think Colin was just about ready to come down from the choir to see if I was going to die on him.  My face was turning purple, I was laughing so hard, and I think that Esther was kind of ashamed to be seen sitting next to me.

It's just unfortunate that they were forced to perform in a gym and that the sing-along wasn't better thought-out.  Maybe next year!

And that's my two cents' worth on that.  Esther commented that I carry around a pocketful of pennies, ready to insert my two (or ten) cents when it comes to the arts.  Fortunately, Colin does the same thing, so we're obviously a perfect match.</lj-cut>



Sunday, there was a rehearsal after church for Colin's cantata, which I'm going to sing in, despite only having one rehearsal with them.  I've had the music longer than anyone else in the choir (I helped pick it), and I've been working on it on my own, so it'll be fine.  After that, there was another rehearsal for the Christmas show at Foothills Alliance, which was my only chance to hear any of that show, since it'll close a few days before I get into town.


By Sunday afternoon, we were both well on our way to catching colds.  Jakob, who was coming down with something, was all over Colin on Thursday, and then I think I got it from Colin by about Saturday.  I stayed home Monday and slept, and that was helpful--it seems to be running its course really quickly.

And now, we're well into the home stretch of the pre-Christmas rush.  I have five written assignments and two presentations to do in the next week, but fortunately, the presentations each correspond with a written assignment, so really, it's only five assignments.  Also, a) some of them are already partially done and I just need to finish them up, and b) they're not all full-length papers.  I don't think I have anything that will end up being longer than about 8 pages, which isn't bad at all.

Emmanuel Church's Christmas concerts are on the 13th and 14th, so we have our dress rehearsal next Wednesday.  Colin has more in the way of rehearsals than I do (although I need to be in on some <i>Borkman</i> rehearsals in the next week, as well).  He's finished with <i>Messiah</i>, obviously, but Foothills Lutheran's cantata only has a few rehearsals left, he's heading into tech for Foothills Alliance's show, and he has to finish the design for <i>Steel Mags</i>, which apparently is kind of a train-wreck of a show, in some ways.

I was going to try and keep this entry from being too epic, so I'll post pictures later, as well as a story about Amazon.com.  In the meantime, my homework and my pillow are both calling me.  The sooner I get to one, the sooner I can get to the other."

"event","Yay, Christmas decorations are up!

There's no tree in the apartment, so I had to get creative.  We may get a tree later (after Thanksgiving), and if we do, I still have plenty of ornaments that didn't get put up, but in the meantime, here's what we've got:


<lj-cut text=""This way for pictures""><center><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/being_fulfilled/pic/00178bc7/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/being_fulfilled/pic/00178bc7/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

I really like having a fireplace in the apartment.  Even though it's not working (it might be, if we had the chimney cleaned and really wanted to light a fire in it--I'm not certain that it's completely not working; we've just never used it), the mantle gives some nice options for decorating, and it's a good focal point in the room.  Also, Christmas lights around a mirror is a nice effect.  The big window (beside the fireplace) is also lit.  We don't have a balcony, so I couldn't hang lights on the railing, so the lights in the window is the extent of our outdoor decorating.




<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/being_fulfilled/pic/00179eee/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/being_fulfilled/pic/00179eee/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Ornaments hanging on the mantle and at the kitchen door/breakfast counter.  Without a tree, I decided to string up the ornaments instead of putting up a garland in those areas.

The chandelier above the kitchen table.  I picked up the amber-colored ""gems"" at Target the other day; they're fun ornaments, especially hanging where they are.  They catch the light quite nicely.

Christmas centerpiece on the sideboard under the window.  I have a candle arrangement that sits there the rest of the year, but this is the Christmas replacement.  I didn't have any tealights to put in the red candle holders, but I'll pick some up soon.  I have little tealight holders all over the place (a set of 6 on the mantle, and some wall sconces on either side of the dining nook), so I need to get some more candles to put in those.</center></lj-cut>

There's a garland around the door, which I didn't take a picture of, and I might pick up a few more little things, like a wreath, if I find some good stuff on sale.  Mervyn's is going out of business, so I'm going to stop in there on Wednesday and take advantage of their 60% off sale to get some more decorations and hopefully a few gifts.

Today and tomorrow can't possibly go fast enough.  Wednesday will be fine; I don't have class, so it'll be a day of laundry, packing, cleaning, shopping, and getting a haircut, but I'm ready for today and tomorrow to be over."

We don't name-call, throw accusations, or have big tempers, and we're really good at talking it out, being respectful, and not walking away from an argument before it's resolved.

But even when it comes to arguing and disagreeing, it's pretty rare that it's about the big, important things.  We're pretty much on the same page when it comes to major life decisions, finances, ideas about marriage and family, faith, and all those big-picture things, but every once in a while, we get into the most ridiculous arguments about the most random things.  We're both stubborn enough that we'll stick to a position and not budge, but it's definitely fun to make the other one try.  And really, those kinds of ""arguments"" are the best kind.  A lot of the time, they actually end up being kind of fun, and if nothing else, it's good practice in debating and being persuasive.

Last month, we were driving down to High River for Thanksgiving dinner, and <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> came up in conversation as we drove by a ""lake of shining waters.""  Colin made a comment about not having seen the movies or read the books in quite a while; I commented that I hadn't read the books in a while, but while I think that Megan Follows is the one and only Anne, I'm not a big fan of the movies, particularly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables:_The_Continuing_Story"">The Continuing Story</a>.  That movie bothers me on so many levels, mainly because the books are set 30 years earlier, and the film plays with the timeline in a way that's unacceptable to me.  World War 1 was the war that affected Anne's children.  <i>Rilla of Ingleside</i> is the book set during that time period, and the main character is Anne and Gilbert's youngest daughter.  The orphaned baby was taken in by Rilla, and it was Anne's sons who fought, not Gilbert.

Anyway, I made all these points about the books, and the thesis of my argument was the fact that it's impossible for a viewer of a movie (based on a book) to fully appreciate the movie without having read the book.

And then the argument started.  :)

For the next hour, Colin stood by his point that the viewer can have a complete, full entertainment experience by only watching the movie.  I stood by my statement that a reader can have a full experience of the author's original intent by reading the book but not watching the movie, but not vice versa.

The funny thing is, I don't think we entirely disagreed with each other.  I think that a movie-watcher can have a complete <i>entertainment</i> experience with the movie alone; I just don't think that it's possible to experience the fullest world of the story the way the author intended.  Watching the <i>Anne</i> movies may be an entertainment experience in and of itself, but it's not the story experience that L.M. Montgomery intended.  In this case, it's not even the same story, but even if it was, I still say that the story and experience is incomplete.

I used the example of the Harry Potter books, too.  Aaron refuses to read the books, and I stand by my claim that he's robbing himself of J.K. Rowling's full story.  The movies are an <i>adaptation</i> of a written story, and without reading the story, the visual story is incomplete.  She may have put her stamp of approval on the screenplays, but by the very nature of an adaptation, there are things that had to be cut and sacrificed; therefore, the representation of the world she created is not complete, no matter how accurate the pieces may be.

Colin held to the position that it's possible to fully enjoy a movie based on the book without having read the book.  He stood by the fact that he separates the book and the movie; for instance, in the case of <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, he's fully aware that the movie is not the story of the book, but he looks at them as two separate pieces of entertainment that are only partially related to each other.

Because film and literature are two distinctly different art forms, they can't be judged the same way.  A story told on film and the same story told on paper are two different artistic experiences--the story on film fleshes out the visual narrative in a way that the story on paper is unable to.  In that way, he argued, it could even be said that the film completes the story of the book in a way that makes the reading of the book an incomplete rendering of the artist's original vision.

He also used the Harry Potter example to differentiate between casual and obsessed fans.  He claims that someone could be an obsessed fan of the movies without ever having read the books; I claim that someone who is truly a fan of the Harry Potter world would never claim to be so without having read the books.  A person (like Aaron) can be a fan of the <i>movies</i>, independent of the books, but I would argue that he can't claim to be a fan of HarryPotterTheGlobalPhenomenon while steadfastly refusing to partake in the <u>original</u> manifestation of the characters and plotlines.

Colin said that's discriminatory towards people who don't enjoy reading; I say so be it.  Being a ""fan"" in the most obsessed sense of the word (and I'm not talking about being a casual fan/appreciator of the work) includes being familiar with all its facets.  I enjoyed <i>Batman Begins</i> and <i>The Dark Knight</i>, but I'm fully aware that my knowledge of the source material is spotty at best, and because of that, I couldn't consider myself a ""true"" fan, no matter how much I enjoyed the movies.


Now, a few caveats:  I'm not saying that books are necessarily a superior form of entertainment to movies.  Movies, both originals and adaptations, are an art form in and of themselves.  I would never say that film is a lesser art form than literature or theatre.  Each one is a different storytelling medium, and I'm not making a judgment of value on their relative worth.

I'm also not saying that an adaptation can't be entertaining without having read the book.  There are many, many movies that I've watched without having read the books, and I can appreciate the filmmaking and acting and story, but I'm also fully aware that I'm not getting the full experience.  I can <u>enjoy</u> it for what it is, but I know that ""what it is"" is less than 100% of the author's intention.



And just to top it off?  My proudest moment in that whole argument was the fact that Colin got so frustrated that he actually growled at me.  Ha!  In the middle of a sentence, he actually growled in his throat, and it cracked me up so much that I had to pause the discussion and laugh really hard before I could resume.


So, friends, what do you think?  What is the relationship between a book and its film adaptation?  Is it possible to enjoy one without a working knowledge of the other?"

"event","I was browsing through some random websites earlier this week, and I came across a site was full of ""evidence"" of how evil Walt Disney was (and Disney as a corporation is).  It had some of the more common stories, but the one I found most amusing is that ""Walt Disney was evil because he chose music by dead composers for <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_(film)"">Fantasia</a></i> so that he wouldn't have to pay for the music.""

While it's true that Disney (as a company) has an incredibly powerful legal team that understands the inner workings of copyright law better than just about anyone else anywhere, it makes me laugh that using public domain music is evidence of evil.  How is it not an artist's prerogative to choose to either have new work commissioned, support currently established composers, <i>or</i> reintroduce the public to classical works?  Any of those three options, especially with the scope of Disney's influence, had the potential for significant ramifications within the artists' careers (if new work had been commissioned or contemporary work used) and the public consciousness and awareness of the music scene, even though the film was originally not as well-received as hoped.

Most artists have at least some understanding of public domain, even if they don't understand copyright law as a whole.  In general, with written works, at least, once the author has been dead for 70 years, the work passes into public domain, meaning that royalties are not paid.  Therefore, royalties are not paid on a Shakespeare play, for instance (unless it's an adaptation or translation, in which case, royalties are paid to the publisher of the translator).

I have no doubt that fiscal choices informed part of Disney's choice of music for <i>Fantasia</i>, but the fact remains that by using classical music as the score for the movie, a younger generation was introduced to music that they may not have listened to otherwise, especially when the scope of the work is taken in the context of 60 years.  Much of the music used may be the most popular classical music, but the fact remains that it's classical music, and anyone with any sort of musical interest and/or training should have a working knowledge and recognition of those pieces.  There's merit in perpetuating the knowledge of the roots of modern music history and style, and in using public domain music, Disney allowed that.

This website (and I really can't remember the address) was obviously out to prove that Disney is eeeeevvvviiillll and is out to destroy the world.  Eh.  I like Disney.  I also like emerging, independent art.  The two are not mutually exclusive.

However, if they really wanted to talk about Disney and copyright law, they should have mentioned this:  Copyright laws are radically changing with digital technology.  The entire art world works differently and sources material in different ways than it used to, and that radically changes the way copyright is viewed.  While it may seem that a ""hard"" copyright law is best for artists, in many ways, that's not the case.  However, every few years, the parameters for work in the public domain changes.  One of the reasons why?  It's revisited (with pressure from Disney's legal team) every time Mickey Mouse and Steamboat Willie are about to enter the public domain.

In my opinion, if the author of that website was looking to tie Disney into copyright law, this is a much more compelling ""Disney is evil!"" argument than the fact that <i>Fantasia</i> uses public domain music.

(Also, this is one reason why many support a dual-layered approach to copyright.  The challenge is finding a middle ground where independent artists who are hampered by a hard copyright law are allowed freedom and protected within the flexibility of such a stance, and yet the large corporations with instantly recognizable symbols [like Mickey Mouse] are protected from the soft copyright that many artists are pushing for.)"

"event","It's that time of year again...

The A/C in our apartment is set up kind of strangely.  We can't have both the A/C and the heat at the same time.

<i>Well, of course, you silly girl; who would want the air conditioning and the heat on together?</i>

Okay, no one.  But what I mean is, because our system is set up in this weird, funky way, we have to get a technician every winter and summer to switch something in our A/C unit from heat to A/C.  This is something that our landlord could have permanently dealt with, but she's chosen not to (yet), so we have to call someone in every few months.

In general, this isn't a bad thing.  For most of the year, we don't need both the heat and the A/C at the same time.  However, there are a few weeks in November when it would come in handy.  See, at night, it's getting down to 50F/10C or so, which, while not freezing cold, is kind of chilly.  Without being able to run the heat to take a bit of the edge off, it's hard to be motivated to get out of my cozy, warm, 3-blanketed bed into the cold bedroom.

However, we have days, like this weekend is forecast to be, that are still getting up to 90F/32C.  The apartment faces west, and all the windows are on the west side, so in the afternoon, the whole place can get a little bit toasty, and it's handy to have the A/C just to take the edge off.  We don't need to run either one a whole lot--in general, the apartment is quite comfortable when it's the temperature that it naturally is at this time of year--but there are moments.

In another week or two, we'll call the technician in and have the system switched over to heat so that we're set for the winter.  Once it gets chillier, in January and February, we'll want it, and we won't need the A/C for a few more months at that point.

Still, for right now, it's rather inconvenient, and as much as I love snuggling under lots of blankets in a chilly room (because that's quite a wonderful feeling), it's not so fun when I have to get <i>out</i> of bed in the morning.



In slightly related news, I have a 30% off coupon for Old Navy, Gap, and/or Banana Republic.  I might have to use that to get a winter coat, since my older dressy one is getting kind of worn and I've needed a new one since at least last year.  I may only need a real winter coat for about 3 weeks of the year (when I'm in Calgary at Christmas), but I still need it for those 3 weeks, and if I'm moving back up there after I graduate next December, I'll definitely need one then.

I saw one that I <i>loved</i> at H&M, but it was about $30 more than I wanted to spend.  However, Target has one similar to the one at H&M, and it's almost exactly the same price as the one I'm looking at from Old Navy (with the discount).  I'll have to look at them both again and see which one I like better.

I also have a ""friends"" coupon to forward to as many people as would like it, so if you want 30% off through Sunday for either in-store or online (U.S. only, unfortunately; seems like Canada is always being discriminated against in the good-discount department), let me know (along with your email address if I don't have it), and I'll forward it to you.

<lj-cut text=""Just to get you onto my page"">Also, I changed my layout.  It's very bright.  (Click through and see my page in my style, just for fun, if clicking through the lj cut doesn't do it for you.) I like this design, but it only comes in this bright purple, in a teal/blue, or in black and white.  The black and white is a little too stark for me, and the teal isn't quite what I'm looking for, either.  I may change it in the next day or two, but we'll see.</lj-cut>"

"event","The highlight of my weekend was taking a really good nap.

I love getting the chance to take a real nap, with no time limitation.  This is no cat-nap, no power nap, no quick refresher--no, this kind of nap is the real thing.  For me, it's almost always 3 hours long, which is, I suppose, one full REM cycle.

A good nap involves real blankets and a real bed.  It's not the same thing as curling up on the couch for 20 minutes, and it's not just lying on top of the covers with an afghan.  No, a real nap goes under the covers and pulls up a quilt.

A real nap is fully clothed.  Taking a nap is not the same, psychologically, as going to bed.  There may be a change of clothes (think: Sunday afternoon nap after church), but it's not a change into pyjamas.  There's a psychological difference between taking a nap and going to bed, and attire plays a big part in that.

Getting into bed fully clothed, pulling up the covers, and snuggling in while it's light outside feels wonderfully decadent and slightly delinquent, in a very ""I'm a grown-up"" way.  (Because really; when was the last time a 3-year-old rebelled by falling asleep?)  It's even better if you can pretend that you're getting into bed to read, knowing that you'll fall asleep and the book with fall on the ground within 3 minutes flat.

Waking up is almost as good.  Because it's not actually time to go to bed for the night, three hours is enough, and the body drifts out of sleep slowly, stretching and waking one limb at a time.  There's no alarm, no sense of having to get up and hurry; it's like sleeping in on a weekend morning.

(Not to mention that my dreams are more vivid and weird when I nap, and sometimes, those are more fun.)

All that to say that I got to take a Sunday afternoon nap, and that was the highlight of my weekend.  Except for the part where I realized that the $22 plane tickets between Calgary and L.A. were just a dream.

We also got our digital converter for our TV this weekend, so retroactively, that may be the best thing to come out of this weekend, but since I haven't watched any TV since it was set up, the nap still wins."

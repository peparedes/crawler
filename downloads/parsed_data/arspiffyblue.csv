To Ashley
my love 
who to me
you are above
all teh rest
so please dont stress
because to me
you are the best
and I love you so much
you dont have to test
I hate it when you are sad
it makes me feel so mad
because I dont like it
when you feel bad
for you my love its true
without you I wouldnt know what to do
I wouldnt have a clue
so please dont cry
I did try
Bye

"event","So it was mine and brians 4 month today... sniff sniff.  I love him so much.  Well he leaves in a little over a week to go to school.  I cry every day thinking of it.  I have no idea how it is going to be without him.  It just wont be the same.  On another sad note I found out I have to have some syst taken out of my neck... eeee.  That freaks me out.  Its about the size of a tennis ball... it does not stick out that much but its about that big around.  Its really ugly on the CT scan.  And the real sad thing is brian wont be here... he will be at school.  I know he will come back though to see me as soon as he can.  ON A HAPPY NOTE THOUGH... we saw ancor man tonight... it was really funny.  I would see it again... maybe.  Athens this weekend was fun too!  HAPPY B-DAY AGAIN SLOANIE!!!!  I saw Bo and Daniel... Steves (my ex's) two friends.  Kinda wierd, but they are way too nice!  But ya anyway I gotta jet, so I will write a lil more later!  PEACE!"

"event","I cant believe how well everything has been going.  Lifes the best... I have a great boyfriend, great friends, lifes jsut great.  Brian and I have figured out that our next little vacation is going to be to flordia.  It will be nice Im sure only cause everything we do together is nice.  Like when we went to the mountains the other day.  The waterfalls he took me to were amazing.  It was a long hike but we got to chit chat and take in the view.  8 friggin miles, dang.  Well after that was a nice italian dinner and then it was back to his house for a shower and a nap.  We are going to spend a weekend up there before school starts back too.  Ahhh the nice life.  I could not ask for more.  Oh and did I mention his parents love me too?  Really his whole family.  Aunts, uncles, cousins, parents, and his brother.  Im like a giant hit.  He is the same with my family.  Everyone loves him.  Ive got myself a nice tall sexy man.  Oh its great.  Ive never been so catered to in my life.  Chairs pulled out doors opened for me always making sure that I have tons of blankets when i go to his hosue cause its sooo cold cooking me dinner 3-4 times a week... and I even get to eat in bed!  Awwww.  Well Im off to bed.... I will yack at you guys later.
Peace!"

"event","So I have been thinking about this a lot.  If someone told me a few years ago that I would be with Brian Delaney I would have laughed and said yeah right.  At the time I was with a guy named steve... we were together for about 1 and a half years.  Bad decision from the get go.  Anyway, senior year I had a class with brian we would talk then but not too much we knew the same people and all that fun stuff.  We both went to perimeter... when we saw each other we would stop and talk for a while... we did that for another 2 years... then it just all fell into place one day... like it was meant to be.  I used to tell steve that I got the butterflies when we kissed... I did but I never got a smile on my face anytime I saw him.  I never told him good bye for 15 minutes and then kept on for another 15.  I always felt like I had a burden on my shoulders with steve around, with Brian, I can spend hours with and never get bored or mad... Im always as happy the 10th hour as I was the first.  I may have loved steve... but I loved him before I knew what love was.  With Brian... its as pure and pure can get... and its true too."

Friday night we went out to the globe and had dinner with his family... well he started drinking and about 11:00 he was toast... he started around 6.  Anyway we went to his aunts house out in danielsville to spend the night.  That is one amazing house they have!  Well the next morning we got up around 7 watched some tv till about 9 and fell back asleep till 2!  Saturday we hung out with a bunch of his friends and ended up hitting the sheats at 9:30!  We were pooped!  It was a great weekend though!  Just a little FYI for all you out there July 4 will be our 3 month!  Is that not just cute!  Gosh darn it it is!  Well Im gone to bed... Im pooped!"

"event","So a lot has been going on here... my dad had a heart attack, I lost my job, and my car broke down again! But my babe and I are still doing great!  Sometimes I wonder what would happen if we broke up... I would be crushed!  Kinda weird though... everyone keeps seeing my ex around town... thank god I have not run into him yet.  I am always with brian and Im sure something would go down... knowing my ex... he always tries to be a smart ass.  Well tonight Brian and I chilled out over at his house with his brother and a couple of his friends then we went out in his new car.  He got into a wreck with his old one and his parents just bought him a 98 Acura CL... its NICE... black 2 door sports yet classy car.  We were jammin out to some good music too! (I cant believe I just said good music... I guess I have come around to what he listens to now...)  Well Anyway.  Once I get a little more time I will come back to this but for right now I gotta go!  PEACE"

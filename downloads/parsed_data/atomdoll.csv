I am still here. Still in the same state of mind, with a little less severity. 

Love,
Me"

"event","It is the second day of my vacation. I really do not want to go back to that hell hole. Really...

My house smells like cinnamon and nutmeg biscotti baking, and that is quite alright with me.

I am really bummed that I am not going to be able to go to Fencon next weekend, but as usual money and lack of it gets in the way. I am sure my housemates will have a good time and tell me stories. I am just pissed I am going to miss six room parties! (and Jim Butcher)

Someday during this vacation I am going to get back on the writing wagon. I am starting to make myself very angry about the whole haven't written in ages thing. 

There is also the idea of getting a little farther in my crochet than a chain. We will see how that goes.

By the way, I know you all love your LJ but I have four invites for <a href=""http://vox.com""> Vox</a> that I can give away. My main journal is there, and I am digging it.  Just leave a comment if you want to get in on the Vox thing."

"event","I love Stargate.  It is one of my favorite science  fiction shows. That is why I like it.  There are aliens, space ships, other galaxies,  alien technology.  It is a perfect escape from  reality. 

That is my  primary reason for my love of Stargate, but I cannot lie to you my readers.  There are times when my love for Stargate trancends the science ficttion aspect.  There are times when it is about the other
chromosome.  There are moments when the eye candy is just too much to handle, and I become a drooling mad woman.  It is a ""shame"" I will admit to.

This realization didn't hit home as strongly until this past weekend, and the Counter Strike episode. There is this climatic moment where Teal'c and Mitchell draw their weapons,  it is shot from an interesting angle, and it just grabs you.  (the picture above is not the moment, and if anyone can find  me a decent screen capture of that moment, I just might have a new best friend)   When I first saw it, I sucked in my breath and nearly fell off the couch. Thanks to the wonders of DVR we were able to watch it over again.  Just thinking about it gives me a warm feeling.   There is just something insanely sexy about two men with drawn P-90's looking like they want to hand you your ass for lunch."

"event","I am one of those people that will write letters to celebrities to tell them how thankful I am for their work. I don't think there is anything wrong with that, everyone needs to know they do good things.  I started to talk to my friend about having a lot of autographs from my life.  Of course I knew I had to really think about it, and make a list. This is not in chronological order or anything, my mind isn't that sharp right now. (mmm NyQuil)

    * Autographed picture and handwritten letter from Jamison Newlander. (The dark haired Frog brother from  The Lost Boys)  (it was right after the movie came out, it was stolen out of my locker)
    * Autographed picture and letter from Shane Conrad (oh my god I loved that show High Mountain Rangers)
    * A letter from Mark Morris, a writer whose book The Horror Club, I loved emmensely. (I was sixteen, and the letter came with writing advice)
    * An autographed picture of Drew Carey circa 1996.
    * Small autograhped picture of Jonathan Brandis. (I have a little scrapbook full of cut out pictures of him. The autographed one is on the first page. )
    * Autographed Rent playbill from my trip to NYC.
    * The CD sleeve to Rant and Roar autographed by all of Great Big Sea.
    * The back of a McDonalds tray sheet, autographed by all of the Buffalo Sabers, including the coaches. (our two morning regulars brought that for me)
    * Autographed copy of Diary by Chuck Palaniuk (a friend of mine got it for me)

    * Autographs and set list from Moxy Fruvous.

(I might be forgetting some, and I seriously think I need more)"

"event","Of course I am spending my day off with my two lovers; Day Quil and his swarthy older brother Ny Quil. The cold has moved onto flu, and into my chest. I am a few steps away from calling the doctor. 
I can't sleep very well, so I am awake at 9:40am and restless. I am trying so hard not to cough because it is an ordeal each time.

I think I am going to take my craft crate upstairs to the bed. Throw in a dvd and work on postcards."

"event","This day had such potential. 

Now it is over and I did nothing.

I am now faced with sickness. I feel like complete and total crap. I couldn't stay sitting up long enough to write anything.  So my short story word count stands at 0, and my drive has dwindled under the strains of a sore throat and fatigue."

"event","I never intended to have another livejournal. This is going to be a place for me to talk about gaming and geek stuff. Mostly to keep in touch with people that I meet at cons.

You see I went to <a href=""http://www.fact.org/dillo/"">Armadillo Con 28</a> this past weekend. It was my first real sci fi convention. I am now officially hooked. I am on my way to <a href=""http://fencon.org/"">Fen Con III</a> in September. 

It seems like quite a few of the awesome people I met, have livejournals. So I made another account, so I do not lose touch."

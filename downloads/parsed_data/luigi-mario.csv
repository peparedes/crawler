Whatever, i am very sick of feeling like shit so i might as well try what she is doing to see if it will help me aswell. I still think its fucked up that it has come to this, but whatever happends happends i guess. And i tried to tell mel about how i think LMAO. That didnt work as well as i hoped. No one understands me and its really starting to bum me out.

So i start to panic a little. so i walk threw a tiny section of the woods to get to the street and as soon as i come out of the woods(which took like 10 minutes because i got stuck severely on thorns) he ran after me so i took off like a bat out of hell.

He said he needed air in his tire , ill go fill it up and be at your house in a little bit. Well i was bored so I went to his house, he was still trying to find his bike pump. I helped him look, about half an hour later we give up...he asks him mom for some money to by a new pump, she gives him 20 bucks and we venture to cvs. On the way there we went to the gas station and filled his tire there(its directly across from cvs). we had 20 bucks and nothing to do with it. So we go to cvs to buy a drink. we end up buying 6 cans of Red Bull, two packs of Extra, and two things of Bubble Tape. We spent $19 on this crap. We went to my old school and sat on the slide on the playground(its my elementry school) and chucked Red Bull and ate all of the gum at one time. We laughed histaricly for a good 14 minutes (almost choking twice myself). It was so awesome.

"event","I just relized how awesome my brother Anthony is. He always messes with me and i always get pissed at him and we always get into fights, and i went to check the mail today and there are letters that say family members names. So i brought them into the house and i saw that there wasnt one with Anthonys name on it. So i read mine and it was from Anthony to sum it up he said congratulations on making it to high school and try hard and shit. HE wrote my family individual letters saying how proud of us he is. He is great."

"event","I slept over mikes house yesterday and i got home today...i got there and Ryan was over and we played GTA for a little while. Then we ran after the ice cream man and ate dinner afterwords. We dropped Ryan off,then we watched a little bit of a movie, then we went to sleep(well i woke in the middle of the night and didnt go back to sleep for a few hours) then his sister got us up at 9:00, and then we went to the beach. Aunt Gale drove me home right after that so i couldnt hang out with Alyssa or anybody, and i didnt get to fight Chris! This week just sucked in genral, i really wanted to hang out witheverone at Mikes... thats why I slept there in the first place.

"event","Well last night i spent about 45 minuets on an entry and it didnt work. That really pisses me off and i really dont want to write it all again so ill just sum up what i said... okay, here we go. yesterday Alyssa told me that she liked me and then (already knowing that i tried to act supprised, well not supprised but not knowing of, if u get what i mean.) Then i said i like her to and then there was an awkward silence. And we just went on as normal. The like 15 mins later she signs off so, yes that was about it but last night was more indepth. And I dont know were this thing is going to lead but i hope it has a good ending. 


thats all for now u fucks

And i am going to tell him we are going to go see Alien v.s Prediter and fill in the other details, but i am going to order tickets to go see.....Yu- Gi-Oh. He will be soooooo pissed. its going to be awesome, i will be a little unhappy at the fact that i have to sit and watch Yu-Gi-Oh, but it will be worth it."

"event","So i got back from seeing the Village about an hour ago. It wasnt as good as i thought it was going to be, but it was alright. So I was talking to Alyssa on the computer and i was trying to bring up the fact that i knew she liked me without me saying it. So i brought up Erinn and all the stuff she always says. And she said ""she says all the stuff just to get me mad."" and i said ""why choose somthing such as u liking me to get u mad, y would she make that roumor instead of somthing else. And she said ""well i kinda do like you"" then i said i kinda liked her to, and blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda. And then she had to leave.....so.....yeah. I dont know were this me and Alyssa thing is going to go, so i guess ill just wait to see what happends.

At first it was just like a cold thing, then two days pass and still the same thing. The next night i was shivering, i got like 3 hours of sleep, so my mom got up and i asked if i had a fever(i knew i had one because i was so fucking cold, but anyway) i had a fever of 103. So here i am now, bored and sick.....i want to play Monopoly."

"event","About 10 months ago, I started running again. It was slow. And painful. I started out with the Couch to 5K program, also known as C25K. I&#39;d run one day and then have my ankle swell up the next day. Thankfully it didn&#39;t hurt, it would just swell to the size of a softball. But I kept going, repeating some of the weeks in the C25K program when I wasn&#39;t ready to move to the next week. Eventually my ankle stopped swelling. I still can&#39;t wear high heels anymore, if I do, I pay for it the next day with an achey ankle. So I solved this problem: I got rid of the high heels!

To date I have run five 5K road races, one 5.6 mile charity race for a fallen chief of police, and one 5K zombie laden obstacle course race (the Run For Your Lives race). Last fall I was trying to come up with a way to commemorate these runs and keep me motivated. I decided to get a Pandora bracelet and add a charm for every race. I have 6 charms and need to pick up a 7th for the 4th of July race I just ran.

My run times have sucked lately, they always do when it gets really hot and humid. It&#39;s been a lot of both lately here in Boston. I&#39;ve actually been going back and forth on whether to wimp out and start hitting the gym several times a week instead of running outside. Not so lucky for me, that decision has kind of been make for me in the form of a heat rash. Thanks, body. What I did learn from this rash and the heat, wearing yoga capris to run is a bad idea. I&#39;ve been buying those largely because I can get them cheap at Target. However, I think I&#39;ll suck it up and get good running capris at Athleta or Sports Authority. I&#39;ve also been wearing the yoga capris because well, my ass is big and I hate seeing it in spandex or any other tech fabric. Vanity be damned, it&#39;s time to get rid of them. Well, actually I&#39;ll keep them for what they were made for- yoga!

This weekend I&#39;ll be hitting the gym instead of the pavement. I&#39;ll set the incline up slightly on the dreadmill (no, that&#39;s not a typo, I meant to type a d instead of a t) and go for my regular runs. Tomorrow I may even venture back into the weights too. It should help with the toning and strength, which will eventually improve my running.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","On Monday <lj user=""drgndancer"" />&nbsp;and I started the <a href=""http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/insanity.do"">Insanity</a> program. It&#39;s an intense exercise program, and I do mean intense! It&#39;s 6 days a week, 5 days of hardcore exercise and one day of slightly-less-hard-core exercise. We started Monday with what is called the Fit Test, a 30 minute set of exercises to count your reps and note. I noted my numbers, took my measurements and before photos. I finished the fit test coated in sweat. On Tusday we got down to business with a 40 minute plyometrics workout. I&#39;ve been sore ever since!<br />Yesterday was 4/6 workouts and the &quot;easy&quot; day. And comparitively, it was easy. It was kind of a yoga, deep stretching 35 minute session. Much less sweaty then the other days, but still sweating.<br />Through all of this, I&#39;m super sore. My calves are screaming WTF? on a <strike>daily</strike> hourly basis and my shoulders are threatening to revolt and walk off the job. Or just drop off the job possibly.<br />All of this pain and yet, I&#39;m really enjoying this workout set! That is the definition of masochist, right? Who knew I had it in me? It&#39;s a 60 day program, and claims it can do in 60 days what would take a year in the gym. While I doubt I see those kind of results, it&#39;s a great start!<br />While I&#39;m doing this intense program, I&#39;ve taken a break from running. My plan is that this will help my running in the long run and kick start getting back into serious shape. Once I get to the one month mark, I&#39;ll take a look at the photos and probably post them. I lost 4.5lbs this week and while I am not expecting or even trying for that every week, I&#39;ll take it for the first week! A good start!"

"event","So Trevor and I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment last weekend. I have the living room put together (mostly) and the kitchen set up. The rest of the apartment is mostly still in boxes. So I can cook and watch TV! Oh yeah, and our king size bed is set up and we&#39;ve been sleeping on it for the last week. Best week of sleep I&#39;ve had in months! Can you see my priorities? Food, TV, and sleep!

I have this Friday off and all of next week. After Thursday, I don&#39;t go back to work until January 3, 2012. Trevor is taking the week after Christmas off for vacation, so we&#39;ll get everything unpacked and organized then. We are staying home for the holiday, the first time in years we&#39;ve stayed home. We are looking forward to it.

About 8 weeks ago Trevor went to Tampa for his dad&#39;s 60th birthday as a surprise. Well, while he was gone I opened a bottle of wine (as I often do) and had a glass or three of wine while watching a movie. So I had gotten an email about a Yulefest 5K run for December 18th. I decided, &quot;Why not?&quot; and promptly signed up not just myself, but Trevor too. Fast forward to last week, we move and I&#39;ve been so busy getting ready for that, that I&#39;ve let my running slack off a lot. Not good. But, we&#39;ve been in the 50&#39;s most days lately- a very unseasonably warm December. Fast forward again to today. This mornings temp when I got up at 7:30am was 18F. Ummm...COLD! So we got our cold weather running gear together and head out. By the time of the run at 10am, I think we were up to maybe 22 or 23. And we ran it. And survived. Really, it wasn&#39;t that bad all in all.
For the first few minutes I was dying. It was cold, my nose was running its own race- straight down my throat. I had a thing to go over my mouth and nose, but it kept pushing the warm breath upwards and fogging my sunglasses.&nbsp; I finally pulled it down and kept going, but it did still help by keeping my neck warm. I wore my hooded sweatshirt over my running shirt and I won&#39;t do that again. I got too hot and ended up taking it off and tying it around my waist. I wore gloves too- excellent decision. I had a pair of running tights on AND a pair of yoga pants on over them, not for modesty (they were thick tights/leggings that can be worn alone) but rather because I was that cold. That was a good plan. I had a skull cap hat on too, another good decision. I stayed warm, but I didn&#39;t get uncomfortably hot. I finished my run in 39:24 and was pleased with that. I ran the Oktoberfest run in 39:21. I would possibly have done better, but I had to stop and retie my shoe at one point. Given the cold, I was just excited that I finished under 45 minutes.

So tomorrow is back to the grind. Work, and then the gym to run and do weights. Time to add in some strength training and get back on track with 5 days a week of workouts. Feeling good!"

Cell phones definitely. I love mine and will never give it up, but people just do not think. Texting while driving? Scary!! I think the most annoying is when students answer their phones in class!

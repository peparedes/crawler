"event","Title: Of a Vampire and a Slayerette (Ch. 1)<br /> Author: Merna (of the Quill)<br /> Beta(s): None. The proofreading is done by a slightly dyslexic yours truly.<br /> Rating: PG-13<br /> Spoilers:&nbsp; Up to Teacher's Pet, S1 (Buffy)<br /> Summary: What if things had gone differently? What if Willow saw something in Xander's enmity towards Angel, something that Xander had never even considered? And let us not forget that small variations might completely eradicate the original outcome. For example, what if a stone being kicked around for distraction's sake skitters into a road?<br /> Disclaimer: Not mine, only playing.<br /> Warning(s): a rusty writer<br /> Feedback: Yes, please. Anything but flames with bad grammar, spelling, and/or inherent flaws.<br /> <br /> Notes: My muse is an idiot. She a lovable idiot, but an idiot all the same. This is late because I can't stick to one fandom and now have a large half-finished HP fic sitting on my laptop's hard drive. I've also been out of town the last two weekends.&nbsp; Anyways, this is a multi-chapter story, and I will try to update often, college permitting.<br /> <br /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Make sure to read the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/merna_of_quills/2356.html"">prologue.</a></span></span><br /> <br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Chapter One""> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /> Chapter One<br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /> ""Oh boy,"" Buffy sighed.<br /> <br /> Around her the throng of people surrounded her, writhing, twisting, and turning. The music became almost too loud, and Buffy idly wondered if she was going into some weird Slayer sense of time... or shock. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cryptic liked her. <br /> <br /> And he still wouldn't say who he was, or why he did what he did. Or even really what he did. He could even a entirely different reason for letting her keep the jacket.&nbsp; Perhaps he meant to give her the leather jacket because it had some mystical protection-- no, he had been straight feared about the reason he wanted her to keep...&nbsp; or at least it seemed obvious. <br /> <br /> Her fingers began to trace patterns into the leather jacket, nails creasing it, an action she had been resisting since he put it on her --had it really been only two days ago? Leather needed to be worn in, like her old brown jacket. Something she could fight in.<br /> <br /> Romance with this guy, one who wouldn't tell her who he was, who was a fellow vampire hunter. He was insane, trying to do this now, here on the mouth of hell, where the bogles, phantoms, and everything that dwelt in the darkness came. He was truly crazy. But the question there still remained a question, was she?<br /> <br /> ***<br /> <br /> ""...Look Wills, all I'm saying is that he should really work on his sources if he thought that 'fork guy' was the worst thing out there."" Xander paced. Agitation showing in the tensing and untensing of his shoulders as walked from her desk to the door to the bookcase.<br /> <br /> ""Well, we tried to tell you that she was a bug--"" Willow offered from her perch on the her bed. She shrank at Xander's glare.<br /> <br /> ""I know."" The anger in Xander seemed to seep out of him as folded himself to fat between the bookcase and the side of the bed, one of his favorite places to sit if distressed, wether it be over homework or evidentially, fallout from life and death situations. ""I really don't like that guy,"" Xander announced after a moment.<br /> <br /> Willow snatched one of her pillows, hugging it to her chest. Her room was palimpsest, each object right down to the rose wall-paper border holding memories of different years, other times. Her eyes sought to avoid the chair at her desk, trying not desperately think of how it was Jesse's favorite spots. How he would tip it over and sprawl on the back of it, the seat supporting his head, or the one time when he had spun in it for over half an hour and vomited. And now he was out there... a vampire. She let out her breath shakily and draped herself over the bed. <br /> <br /> ""Is that because Buffy does?"" She peered into his face, upside down.<br /> <br /> ""Buffy what?"" Xander asked quickly.<br /> <br /> ""Likes him.""<br /> <br /> ""What..."" Xander softly breathed. ""She...""<br /> <br /> ""Has all of the classical symptoms of like him,"" Willow said knowledgeably, her lips forming a quirky smile while she tried to nod her head.<br /> <br /> ""But she doesn't even know anything about him!"" Xander protested, his jaw clenching<br /> <br /> ""No one knows everything about love, Xander,"" Willow demurred softly, her eyes coasting up to the ceiling and the star charts. ""That's what makes it so precious."" Another long moment stretched between them, again and Willow forced herself from hoping to hard that Xander would look up at her and see what he never did.<br /> <br /> ""Well, I always heard it was the hormones myself,"" Xander joked as he began to pick at his jeans, not looking up. ""So... she likes him... Are you sure he likes her back?""<br /> <br /> Willow's eyes narrowed at the persistent line of questioning, why did he seem to so hopefully that Angel didn't like Buffy? Shouldn't it be the other way round. He had the blinding crush on Buffy. However, after a month hadn't he figured out by now that she didn't see it? Look at her and him, she had been all but throwing herself at him for over five years. Willow suspected that all of school knew, which might be the reason no one had ever asked her out.<br /> <br /> ""Wills?"" <br /> <br /> She looked back to him, words forming a question in her head.<br /> <br /> ""Willow!"" Buffy burst into her room. The Slayer took a deep breath. ""You won't believe what just happened."" Her expression was some what upset.<br /> <br /> ""Mom came back from her trip early and gave you a long talk on Sunnydale being the center of experimenting youth sexuality when the ratios are compared with that other towns and cites with data from..."" Willow trailed off, flushing a bright red. ""Guess not.""<br /> <br /> ""I think she might be on to something though,"" Buffy said, she walked into the room, and tried to sit on a wicker chair, sweeping the stuffed bear into her arms, and then jumped back up when the legs of the chair made loud snapping noises. <br /> <br /> Willow winced trying not to think that Jesse and Xander as well as Amy had always been aware not to sit on the unstable chair.<br /> <br /> Buffy smiled nervously at her and placed the bear back on the seat. ""I just saw Mr. Shadowy Hint Guy. He told me to keep the jacket, says it looks better on me.""<br /> <br /> ""He what!"" Xander exploded standing up from his hidden spot. ""Buffy, do you even now his last name or if Angel is really his name? I mean, what mother would name a boy that?""<br /> <br /> ""Xa--"" Buffy began.<br /> <br /> ""Hear me out."" Xander snapped, not seeing the hypocrisy in his own words. ""He just happens to know when everything is about to happen. He happens to show up and warn you about the vampires, but doesn't even try to help fight. He could be assassin for that master person for all we know!""<br /> <br /> ""Xander,"" Willow hissed. ""He might not be able to fight, or... Oh! Maybe he has a geas on him, a sort of magical compulsion not to fight!""<br /> <br /> ""Or we could be ignoring the obvious fact that he might not be on our side,"" Xander argued.<br /> <br /> ""Xander, he did get some wounds from that vampire with the blades hand thingies,"" Buffy disputed, moving over to him... getting to close... sort of invading his personal space... not trying not to yell or sound hostile... throwing all the old rules about arguing out the window... <br /> <br /> Willow tried to remain inanimate on the bed, her head still inverted watching the two upside down figures taking aggressive stances. This could get explosive. <br /> <br /> ""We've only got his word!""<br /> <br /> Yep, there it went. <br /> <br /> ""And the wounds he got!"" Buffy exclaimed<br /> <br /> Willow winced. Logical was good, logic was great. Logic would not work here. Tension was still running high; Buffy had tried to warn Xander about the she-mantis while Xander had accused her of being jealous. And wow, she was in slight psycho-analyzation mood. She knew that Xander didn't mean to act this hostile, fights in his house where typical all or nothing. Yeah... she might want to see if she could work on his people-skills.<br /> <br /> She began to tune them out, trying to ignore the sick feeling, that only increased as she became uncomfortable with her head lolling over the side of the bed. However, the physical vexation distracted her from just how wrong the quarrel was playing out.<br /> <br /> ""Well, I can see when I'm not needed!"" Xander yelled and slammed the door shut.<br /> <br /> Willow slowly sat up and rode out the blood-rush, faintly aware that Buffy was talking to her.<br /> <br /> ""...I mean, he could have a point, I don't know where to find Angel, and what mother would name a boy that..."" She paused. ""Says the girl named Buffy.""<br /> <br /> Willow spared only half of her attention on Buffy, her mind still racing. She knew that Xander was still jumpy about a=what happened between him and Ms. French, and that could be part of what had him so accusatory towards Angel, but he hadn't seem to like since he first set eyes on him... Seemed to hark to using the word ""buff"" as well...<br /> <br /> ""By the way, Willow,"" Buffy began, the change in tone jerking Willow out of her reverie. ""Why would your mother start talking about Sunnydale being the center of youth sex?""<br /> <br /> ""Youth sexuality,"" WIllow automatically corrected, then blushed. ""She's a psychologist. Sunnydale has an increased ratio of all most every mental condition or behavior. That's why my parents moved here in the first place... I think.""<br /> <br /> ""Oh."" Buffy continued to sort her thoughts out aloud while Willow nodded in the appropriate places. <br /> <br /> However, the fact that Sunnydale was ""the center of experimenting youth sexuality"" in North America haunted Willow's mind.&nbsp; A very strange and odd idea had occurred to her. What if Xander was (or was going to be) one of those experimenting youths? What if that was the reason behind his loathing of Angel?<br /> <br /> What if Xander had a crush on Angel? <br /> <br /> It would explain why he hadn't had a girlfriend since the barbie incident. <br /> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /> </div><br />"

Title: Buff<br>

Series: Of a Vampire and a Slayerette<br>

Author: Merna (of the Quill)<br>

Rating: PG-13<br>

Spoilers:&nbsp; Up to the first five minutes of Teacher's Pet, S1 (Buffy)<br>

Summary: On the walk home after the first&nbsp; time he sees Angel, Xander reflects. Season 1<br>

Disclaimer: Not mine, only playing.<br>

Warning(s): pre-slash, a rusty writer<br>

Feedback: Yes, please. Anything but flames with bad grammar, spelling, and/or inherent flaws.<br>

Notes: First in series of ficlets/drabbles/any other names I can think
of for short fanfics. I'm planning on writing a new installment for
this every week.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<lj-cut text=""See the result...""><br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~<br>
""You never told me was buff."" Or it something like that, Xander
remembered he'd hissed to Willow as he watched the new guy Buffy had
been ranting about appear at a side-entrance to the Bronze, and Buffy
stride over. And then watched as he, this new guy, cryptic guy as Buffy
called him, give her his coat. And scrutinized the man as Buffy put the
coat on. He saw to hopes within him two hopes crack.<br>
<br>
Once she the grumping blonde came back, telling them of the latest
warning, something about a fork guy, he made a quick joke, chucked
Willow on the shoulder. Making some excuse about actually trying to do
homework, he left.<br>
<br>
Walking home, Xander kicked at several rocks, and had even managed to
keep one rock skittering along the sidewalk with him for a block.<br>
<br>
His usual avoidance tactic failed as his rock skittered out into the
road, forcing Xander to stop for a second. In that second, his thoughts
from the Bronze caught up with him. Angel wouldn't be his or Willow's.
He had not been sent as a bandage from some benevolent god for the
gaping wound that Jesse had left, not like he'd hoped.<br>
<br>
He could see it already, those two sparking. No matter how much Buffy
denied it, she was attracted to him. And Angel to her, no matter how
much he hid behind his cryptic guy act. <br>
<br>
Buffy would be too busy looking at Angel to even consider him as date, no matter what either of the men did.<br>
<br>
Angel would be too distracted by Buffy to look at Willow or him, and
see the possibilities. When they split, Angel will be gone within a
matter of days, Xander perceived. After seeing them, he couldn't image
the four of them going to Willow's to watch Jeopardy and make fun of
their resident red-head geek. Buffy, Willow and him yes, but not Angel.
There was something about him the way he held himself apart, as if they
were beneath him. Nope, no new friend for the two former members of the
Sunnydale triad. Well, there was Buffy, but Xander could already see
the changing dynamics, losing focus on geekdom and slow beginning to
revolve around slaying and fashion. Heck, the had nearly been killed
last week by Amy's mom!<br>
<br>
And no matter how much he tried to forget, nothing would be the same,
and Xander concluded. He was also rather doubting that everything would
ever be right.<br>
<br>
But what it all came down to...<br>
<br>
""He's Buff's.""<br>

"event","It took me three hours, forty-four minutes and eleven seconds to finish the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.

Very well written... not so well plotted. (Or maybe I just did not like the fact I'd predicted so much of the plot). The first two chapters were a completely pleasant surprised. 

The biggest problem in the book I had was Slughorn (well, biggest I can think of). I liked the effect Umbrigde had, in fact the big problem I had with OotP was that the prophecy was so mundane. Slughorn... I was very intrigued when he was introduced. And the ""Slug Club"" was quite interesting as well, but... something was off. 

Hermione was off her game as well. Don't get me started there.

The identity of the Prince only left me a little surprised. 

More later when I'm coherent. And when I can spell and use grammar correctly.

P.S. All fanfic writers out there, I urge you to consider the possibilities of AUs."

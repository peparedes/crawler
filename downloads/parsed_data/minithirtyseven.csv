"event","My lamp is shining in my eyes and now it is much to hot to do anything about, so if I go blind by the time I finish what I expect to be a lengthy catch-up entry... forgive me.

So it's been awhile...  Red Sox won the fucking pennant, and they're going to the World Series tomorrow.  I know I don't seem psyched, but I am.  It's also a little late for me to be enthusiastic about much.  I got me some red socks and my hat, and I will be living it up tomorrow night with some beer (probably high life, not my favourite, but it will do the job the same as any other) and Game 1.  Keep the faith.

Everyone else's lives are infinitely more interesting than my own.  I don't know if anyone else has ever had this problem, but I was just talking to Amy and the only thing that I could talk about are the Sox.  Which is fine when I'm talking to Sean, Jimmy, Ryan, Tim, Charlie and anyone else for that matter, but I know that Amy is more of a football fan and I couldn't give two shits about football.  Except for maybe UT and USC, but that's college...  Oh sweet jesus, I need to stop talking about sports...  ANYWAY.  Amy's got all this shit going on with college and what do I have to show for myself?  Today I woke up, went to work, came home from work, got the tires balanced and rotated on Sean's car, payed my insurance bill, watched TV and that brings me up to now.  Not that I had a particularly bad day, but tomorrow will be much of the same.  I will go with Sean to have his brakes done, then I will go out to Buchanan Dam and party the night away, while I drink beer and watch the World Series.  This is the highlight of my weekend.  I guess it all boils down to presentation...  I mean, if you consider all the time that I did not update, and include my brief stint with alcoholism, my new found dependency on over the counter sleeping aids (both very expensive habits, might I include), coupled with a lack of and then a sudden discovery of direction in my life, maybe I'm not so boring after all.

For all who might be curious about my brief stint with alcoholism:  There was a two or three month period (the period where I did not write in here), where I got shitfaced.  Every. Single. Night.  I really didn't function emotionally without getting completely wasted at the end of the night.  This all ended when the guy I drank with went to jail...  heh.  But he's out now.  And I'm not drinking nearly as much.  The last night I drank was last Saturday night, and the night before that was the Saturday before that.  So no need to worry, I've got it under control (thank God) now.

I am oh so much closer to getting an apartment.  Finally.  The new car is first though.  I don't know what kind of car I'm getting, but it's pretty much boiling down to what I can afford with a good gas mileage.  Whatever.  It will be better than the one I'm driving.  I'm not looking for a dream car, just one that will get me to work and back and maybe occassionally to Austin or Dallas.  Sean and I are doing a black, khaki, brushed alumnium thing.  It should be cool.  I'm going to try to find b&w prints of like some Sex Pistols posters and the Rat Pack.  I'm going to have to buy some sort of Red Sox memorabilia to hang on the wall as well...  There is also this really cool Franz Ferdinand poster...  That all comes after the actual apartment, however.   Haha.

What the hell was I thinking?  I think that a lot as I look back on my life.  I say this with particular emphasis to past relationships.  For instance, I spent one and one half years with a guy I really don't have a damn thing in common with, while another guy who I made out with once when I was 16, is still a good friend of mine and we have damn near everything in common.  I guess you can kind of call it a regret, but only in that particular time of my life.  Maybe nothing would be as good as it is now if I hadn't spent that what seems like an eternity with Mr. Wrong.  Don't get me wrong, I love Sean and I live for everything he is.  I just wonder ""what if?"" too often.  But also, I regret nothing.  Because everything I used to be, is part of everything I am now and I just can't deny that I've learned and moved on.  Maybe I would be going through serious heartache and depression because of the demise of a relationship I was truly invested in didn't turn out Cinderella style.  I've been all too close to that for comfort and would rather not feel that way for any length of time.

As far as work goes I offer a word of advice to EVERYONE.  When you have kids... Make sure you don't put them in care from 2 months old.  It really fucks with them.  18 mos is a good age to start.  The kids I deal with are so pathetic mentally it breaks my heart.  They're all so pissed at their parents all the time, and who gets the brunt of it? ME.  So, for the sanity of your children, yourself and their future educators, one of you needs to quit their fucking job when they have kids or at least work only part time.  There.  I said it.  And take birth control damnit.

Boy howdy do I love the computer.  What a monumental waste of time this expensive contraption is.  I wish I had a proper desk because my fucking back is killing me.  I started this entry one hour and fifteen minutes ago, and I had already been sitting in front of the computer for awhile.  But alas, I'm not yet blind.

I have They Might Be Giants going in this room and Tony Bennett in the other.  I think TMBG should definitely cover Tony Bennett and I think it would be the shit.  I dare you to disagree.

Goodnight all.  I'm fucking beat.  And my back still fucking hurts like a bitch."

This weekend is going to suck goatballs.  There are few things more loathsome than working at the mall during Tax Free Weekend.  Now hear this:  If I recognize you as anyone I know, knew or may have seen one time, and you come into my store during Tax Free, you will be beaten within an inch of your life.  ARGH.  I hate malls.  I hate the Shoe Depot.  I hate everything.

Although there is a happy little paycheck waiting for me there, and there will be another after the weekend from Hell.

I'm getting closer to buying my iBook, and I almost can't fucking take it.  Oh, and a new car.

"event","You're not poor, Erin.  Stop fucking acting like it.  The only poor person in this little group is ME.  ME.. JUST ME.  You know why?  Because I can't find a full time job, and without a full time job, I can't go to school.  Tim complains about working 16 hour weeks.  Well, I'll have you know, that he doesn't pay a goddamned bill.  Maybe car insurance, but whoo. That's huge!  Erin's parents pay for EVERYTHING and acts like she's as poor as I am.  Even Sean acts like he has no cash.  He pays one of his own bills and about half of mine and still has cash to blow on a new fucking stereo system for his car.  It's not that I covet their possesions, or that I'd like to have their lifestyle, but for the love of GOD, they need to stop acting like they're so fucking poor.  I know kids who put themselves through college (um HELLO! ME?!) and shit like that.  It's so fucking offensive to me, if you act like you have no money and you CLEARLY do.  Matt (Sean's oldest bro) said he made $1000 a week, but that is nothing.  UM...my response to that is... ""ARE YOU FUCKING STUPID?""  If I was making $1000 a week, I'd be in fucking hog heaven.  <i>I'm lucky to be where I am.</i>  They don't fucking get how easy their goddamned lives are.  Poor poor Erin with her ranch and her new truck and her stereo system, and poor poor Tim who pays no bills and works for $10 and hour 16 hours a day, and poor poor Matt who makes $1000 a week, has a 195 acre ranch, a new truck and job security.  Yeah FUCK THEM ALL.  Don't get me wrong, I don't hate middle class (because I am, only because we used to be rich, and I have Sean to help me out), or rich people, because there is obviously nothing inherently wrong with it.  EXCEPT WHEN THEY ACT LIKE THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR BILLS.  I hate being poor, but I hate having money and being miserable more.  SO THERE.  They don't know what it's like and GAH.  Okay.  I'm fucking done.

"event","I guess one of the things that pisses me off the very most about people my age is that they think they know shit when they don't.  ""I'm in love."" No you're not.  No you're not.  I know few people who know the true meaning of love and everything that a commitment like that entails.  It means giving up everything you've ever wanted for yourself to help him/her achieve.  It means not caring that you have to give up so much just to stay together, because the sight of that person's face is enough to get you through your toughest time, even when you're seconds from ending your own life.  It means not caring what anyone else thinks and doing what's right to help both you and the relationship grow.  Many people say love is like a flower.  It isn't.  It isn't at all.  Love is like a rock.  At the beginning, it is rough, brown and faulted, but through the seasons and the weather the rock becomes a gem, smoothed, polished and beautiful.  Yeah, some seasons are worse than others, but it's all about the end.  What will your love look like when it's all over?  Will it be a smooth and shiny gem, or will it be a rough piece of uncut granite, broken in half?  Only love, real love, will end up pretty in the end.  And that's why I hate people my age.  Well, among others.

Speaking of which, a friend of mine (who is not like the aformentioned idiots) is asking permission to be married.  Good luck. :-)

My job is still all right.  Lisa is going to see if her dad's work is hiring full time tech support.  That would rock my socks off.  Sean didn't end up getting the Teller 2 job in Round Rock because it was a mispost.  So he's still looking for a Teller 1 position for me.  Damn you Renee...  The non hiring woman.  I had spoken to her about a teller position back in like February.  And that woman never freakin' called me back.  She called me first, making her a phone tag quitter. GAH.

I need a different job.

Apparently, O'Connor refused to let the national anthem to be played be before a concert she had for one reason or another...  Well Sinatra found out about it when he played in the same venue the next night, and said something to the effect of ""I'm going to kick her in the ass"" (for not allowing the national anthem to be played).  Later on, O'Connor said that she was still a fan of Sinatra and she had to be, because who isn't (duh), and that even being threatened with physical violence by Sinatra was an honor.  Straight up.  Sinatra can kick my ass any day.  Speaking of ol Blue Eyes, here are some pictures of him, since he was such a hansome man.

"event","I guess I'll give ya'll a rundown of the party Saturday night, mainly because I have little else to write about.  Needless to say, I'll probably end up rambling on about whatever... So hold tight I guess.

Okay, so Graduation blew, I think I mentioned that.  Anyway, afterward we came back to Sean's house and he played drums while Leslie, Erin, Tim, and some others chilled, had a beer and stuff like that.  I think by the time the cops came at ten til midnight, I was already pretty sloshed.  I just got worse, but fortunatly I didn't get sick.  I can't remember exactly what happened in chronological order, but at one point Les and I were laying in the back of her truck giggling about God knows what, and then we played guitar and sang...  I didn't get to see it but Cheeto hit Clay in the face...  Pretty funny.  Sean and I ended up going to bed about 4AM.

I worked on Monday, and I might be made a keyholder...  That's good, I suppose.  Promotions are always good.  However, I'm still looking for a full-time 8-5, weekday job...  That way, I always know my schedule, I get paid more and I get benefits.  Sean might take a Teller 2 position in Round Rock, so I might be able to take his position in Georgetown and that would be very awesome.  He'd get a pay raise, I'd get a pay raise, I'd work closer... It would just be a very good situation.  We would be in a very good place.

Sean mangaged to change his starter and his starter solenoid.  That wasn't why his car wasn't starting.  It ended up being a bad battery connection (wow, not like I didn't say that 10 times before...) and it just ran down the alternator.  It's a good thing he got a new starter though, because the last one sounded pretty asstastic when we took it to AutoZone and had Manny check it.  It sounded like the bearings were going out...  It's a good thing he changed it now, I guess.

Damn, I need some pain medication.

And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry
And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love
That have to say goodbye 

And as I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go 

Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright 
And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here 

And every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy day
And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't dance before
And every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kiss
And pick you up in all of this when I sail away 

Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plain overhead
Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly
But with you I can spread my wings
to see me over everything that life may send me 
When I am hoping it won't pass me by 

And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me
there you are to show me

Sometimes I wonder what the hell I'm doing here, instead of with my folxs in Missouri.  But what the hell would I be doing there?  Why the fuck is this so complicated, and why can't I just get over it??

I do work tomorrow and Saturday but I get Sat. night and Sunday off.  So let's all hear it for that.

I wish I wasn't so mother freakin' broke.  I did get my hair cut and dyed today courtesy of Sean.  Thank you, Sean!!! :-)

Sean's battery crapped out on him today.  Piece of shit $120 Orbital.  So we high tailed it in the Jeep over to the 24 hour Auto Zone (that's where Jesse James buys his auto parts, you know.  I'm <i>so</i> sure...)  and picked up a Duralast for $70.  It will do.  It's fine.  Whatever.  I'm tired of our cars crapping out.  I want a new goddamned car.  I think I'm going to forgo school for awhile.  I don't know.  It's crap.  All of it.

It is weird and somehow very very dumb.  It irritates me.  Oh man, on my way home from work, I was at the light at Williams and Austin Ave and this <i>retard</i> in a Saturn sat there revving his engine (you make that 4 banger go) and then he'd roll back and then forward and then back and then forward like he was some kind of badass waiting to take someone off the line.  Did I mention he was turning left?!  What a jackass.  It's a Saturn for God's sake, not a Ferrari.  Good freaking lord.  If I ever see this guy again, I'm going to rip him from his pathetic little vehicle and beat him until he cries like the little bitch he is.

I hate life (not really), I hate bills (yes really), and I hate money (only when I don't have any).  GAH.

From someone's profile: ""Youll miss me this summer im moving to flordia all summer but will return in time for school.""  No I won't, and you're not moving, asshole.  Sigh.  Some people just don't fucking get it.  I don't know exactly what they're supposed to get, except that I don't really give a damn about them and their lives.  That's not entirely true, because I do give a slight damn.  I mean, I don't want them to die, or get hurt or anything bad, I just don't care if anything particularly good happens to them.  You know?

I never had the chance to leave for the summer because of relationships.  That's really pathetic, but it's true.  I spent a good part of my life wasting it away with one guy or another.  Simply putting my life on hold for them and not living my life to the fullest it could be lived.  I don't particularly regret my past relationships, it's more like I regret being so attached at such a young age.  It did teach me a lot about how to treat other people who are close to you.  When you're practically an only child, you don't realize that there are other people on the planet.  I'm mainly speaking about the ones in my family.  Which I should call tomorrow, but I digress.  I don't regret anything I've done to be with Sean or moving back to Georgetown, and it's not harder than I thought it would be, it's just... lamer than I thought it would be I guess.  I dunno, there was some sort of glamour, back in the day, to living away from my parents and not having to go to school, and it's still here... I don't know, it seems my days are shorter than they should be and that I can't seem to fit in everything I want to do everyday.  I know lots of people can't fit in all they need to do in a day, in merely 24 hours, but it seems like it's even worse for me.  I don't seem to get enough sleep, even if I sleep half the day away, so I sleep all I can, and I don't get anything done.

My life is just so empty while I'm awake and alone.  I feel useless and wasted.  Not good wasted either, haha.  I feel like I'm taking up valuable air that some other, more deserving, human being needs to flourish.  I wish I didn't feel like such a failure all the time.  Even when I was in college and had all A's, and studied a lot, I knew that I was a failure to my family and to Sean because I wasn't there for them.  I don't know what to do.  I'm so confused about all this.  I wish I could convince Sean to move to Missouri, but he doesn't seem to be warming up to that idea too quickly.  I don't want to force him into moving with me, because that would be very unfair and I don't want to move without him, because that would negate the purpose of moving there at all.  The purpose, of course, being to be able to be with Sean and my family at the same time.  He's just not ready for something like that, and hell, I'm not either.  Maybe when we get a little more money saved up... without having to drop thousands of dollars on our cars and stuff.  Good lord.

Today at the store, some woman was talking about buying green shoes to go with her black dress... She said they would make the dress look dressier (I don't get it either, folks) and it would make her stand out.  Yeah.  You know what else would make you stand out?  If you dyed your hair florescent orange and gave yourself liberty spikes. ARGH!!!

Hokay.  Pieces ya'll.

I love you all."

"event","I've had a fairly long day...  Lot's of sorting and restocking and stuff during work.  Fucking highway construction caused me a one hour commute home.  Bullshit, says I.  And I get to do it all agian tomorrow, except for longer.

I might have forgotten to mention this...  But Sean got me flowers!  Hooray, they're pretty.

Damn, I'm so freaking tired!

I need to buy some more comfortable shoes for work, because my feet hurt badly after work.  Screw all of you who get to wear tennis shoes.

I have nothing to write about, bitches.  I'm too damned tired.

Peace ya'll.

I love you all."

"event","i wish i could have said
exactly how i felt,
but the sound of the truth against the air
was too much pain to bear.

i should have told you to leave,
i should have walked away myself,
no matter how wrong things are,
they're more right than ever,
i can't stand...
i can't stand (to be) alone.

i wish you would have said
exactly how you felt,
but the sound of truth against my ears
would be too much for me to bear.

i'd rather be broken than lonely.
i'd rather be broken than lonely.
i'd rather be broken than lonely.
i'd rather be broken than lonely.

don't walk away and i won't either
nothing is ever as bad as it seems,
no matter how wrong things are
they're more right than ever
i can't stand...
i can't stand (to be) without you."

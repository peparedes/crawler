"event","I've spent eighteen years falling time and time again.It's all nothing more than a sad song and too many hours spent playing PS2. I've been burned by pots and pans ,boys and friends. I've dealt with the drama of everyday life. High school was just wild gestures and talking too loud with agression in every smile. I'm older and younger than you in spirit and experience. I may have seen it all but the stars in the sky never fail to excite me. This is all a jumble of misunderstandings, avoiding confrontations, having meaningful conversations with everyone and hours spent on the phone contemplating life,death && everthing inbetween."

"event","so this morning betty woke up really early and was running frantically around the house.  I knew she was on some sort of mission but i went to bed at 3 and it was 8 so there was no way i was going to wake up and figure out what it was.  Erik got up before i did and went to take a shower and in the bathtub found out what betty's mission of the morning was....

It's not easy to open your heart before you are clear about what you want. Nevertheless, your courage will be rewarded if you simply share your current thoughts and feelings without trying to get anyone else to cure your ambiguity. The beauty in this is that your openness to the present moment can create a special magic that is not available if you begin with a specific agenda."

in other news.. i am going to denver tomorrow which will rock.  jessica is coming out and so is matt and we will have so much fun i might even forget about pooheads who cant make time for me.  the convention looks amazing, i was looking at the line up today and it hink it will be great. 

 oh and the glorytellers (2 members from karate, though not the one i long to see) will be playing in denver on sat night so i might get to see them.  and the 3rd karate member better get his butt back to the states soon so i can see him to because i miss him and his face.

as of the beginning of november i will be adopting another dog from a friend who cant take care of it anymore.  two ilttle black and white fur balls.

ava will be moving out at the end of november and chris and betty will be moving in on december 1st so we will have 3 dogs and 2 people which will rule!  doggy fun for all.

i got a call friday morn that i didnt have to go to work so we bumped up the trip to leave at 1ish, i went to breakfast with a friend and got home too late to remember to pack much of anything (good thing i was stayng with jessica)  we got on the road and i noticed there was a wobble in the car but katie said it jst wa s like that.  after i made chris drive because i was tired the tire tread flew off and we had to put on the spare and jessica found us a wallmart to get the thing fixed at.  after about an hour in wall mart we were back on the road and made it to jessica's safe and sound.

sat we woke up late and ran around the city and made katie lay on a table and get some needles in her side then we came home and watched snakes on a plane (it mother-fuckin rules)

today we woke up ate bagels went to visit jessica at work, went on a long walk, ate a great dinner and drove home.  i totally needed this weekend and i had a great time, hopefully i will be able to do it again soon.

"event","so this past week has been spent on the right coast of the united states.  erica i miss you already and can't wait till you are back home to go hiking with and enjoy long nights watching movies and drinking wine.  after a short stay in new york that ended waiting for a bus in a line a bit too close to a line full of people waiting to audition for ""so you think you can dance"" 

we headed to our nations capital to visit fromar and ziska.  the first night there me and ziska had a good amount of alcohol and we all headed out dancing... they told me we called ryan and i remember the phone being to my ear but could not tell you what either of us said.  the rest of the trip was a bit more mellow filled with board games and walks through the streets and museums.  

now i am home and though i had a ton of fun and glad to be home.  but hopefully i will get to see omar and ziska in juneish and erica in a few weeks.  now ryan just needs to get his ass back out here and everything will be perfect!"

I am not sure what that says about me but it is what it is. &nbsp;I use Facebook to keep up with friends and family which is very, but I use Twitter to talk to someone set of friends on more personal more controversial stuff like that. &nbsp;Hell, I even get most of my news from my Twitter feed because I have CNN, the local news, the weather, and Aljazeera news on my Twitter feed. &nbsp;That being said I&#39;m still going to try the posts every now and then because it&#39;s really nice to see some consistency with my life and go back and my archive see the progression of my life.

Raleigh
&nbsp; In two words? &nbsp;Annoying and Wonderful. &nbsp;She loves to sing, dance, draw, stomp, and talk.... incessantly. &nbsp;She&#39;s growing up so fast and it&#39;s so amazing to see different aspects of both Kalee and I in her. &nbsp;She has Kalee&#39;s love for music but my tone deafness. &nbsp;She has Kalee&#39;s reaction to stress but my sunny demeanor. &nbsp;she has Kalees creativity and my curiosity. &nbsp;She&#39;s been doing gymnastics for over a year now and she really likes it so I see no reason to put in her something else. &nbsp;Truth be told I don&#39;t trust any dance companies because I&#39;ve edited their shows for DVD and seen how they sexualize little girls. &nbsp;That may be overstating it but I found some dances uncomfortable to watch at times. &nbsp;Kalee enrolled her in some vacation bible schools lately. &nbsp;I like her involvement and that she&#39;s learning about God. &nbsp;I&#39;m not the biggest fan of churches but that&#39;s my spiritual issues and not hers. &nbsp;She&#39;s off to actual school soon and I&#39;m a little freaked out. &nbsp;I just don&#39;t want her growing up so fast. &nbsp;I used to be able to cuddle with her on the chair but now she either doesn&#39;t want to or she&#39;s too big. &nbsp;Time marches on I guess

Korben
&nbsp; This little man is hitting his stride. &nbsp;This is my favorite time. &nbsp;He&#39;s forming sentences, he can ask for what he wants, and he can express himself in better ways than just crying. &nbsp;It&#39;d be great,.... if he also didn&#39;t have the MOST defiant personality I&#39;ve ever seen in a kid. &nbsp;His most basic nature is to be as difficult as he can be. 

Me - &nbsp; You want a drink?
K &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp;Uh huh.
Me - &nbsp; &nbsp;You want water, tea, juice, or kool-aid?
K &nbsp;- &nbsp; &nbsp; Water
Me - &nbsp; &nbsp;**I go get him water and hand it to him
K &nbsp;- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NO!! I don&#39;t WANT!
Me &nbsp;- &nbsp; &nbsp;You said you wanted this! &nbsp;Well, what do you want?
K &nbsp;- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;** he then proceeds to cross his arms, turn his back to me, and curl his face as if I just kicked his puppy.
**** &nbsp;I then proceed to try different drinks, cups, methods of delivery, conversational transitions, ice, and locations.  

The kid is driving me up the wall. &nbsp;The only thing that makes it bearable is the fact that he is the freaking cutest kid ever. &nbsp;It&#39;s like he&#39;s daring you to try and make him smile. &nbsp;Other than the unbelievable pain in the ass he likes to be sometimes he is all I wanted in a son. &nbsp;I love being able to pick him up and spin around. &nbsp;Tickling, snuggling, throwing, chasing, funny faces, piggy-back-rides, bed-hopping, hide&amp;seek, just general playing gives me such joy I can hardly contain it. &nbsp;I do feel a day coming where the cuteness no longer outweighs the need for correction and his mother can only coddle him for so long.


Work is going okay. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been running into issues with policy. &nbsp;UA is a cornucopia of policies that conflict, don&#39;t make sense, or don&#39;t exist when they really should. &nbsp;It&#39;s so frustrating to be told by my boss that I can make my own schedule and then get in trouble 3 years later because I came in at 7am instead of 8am. &nbsp;It&#39;s draining to dodge egos, not step on toes, and wander through the digital domain with no roadmap and no support from the central office. &nbsp;I&#39;d never leave UA because overall I enjoy the work, I love most of my coworkers, and feel like I&#39;m finally getting the lay of the land. &nbsp;That said I&#39;ve always got my ear to the ground for a position that fits my unique and broad skillset.

Sterling Installs is doing well. &nbsp;I had to back off advertising because I was getting more business than I could handle. &nbsp;A good problem right? &nbsp;If I did this full time I feel certain I could really get consistent work going but who has the time.  

I&#39;ve gotten into microcontrollers and it&#39;s a ton of fun. &nbsp;Arduino bases make everything fun and super cheap modules/components from china don&#39;t hurt either. &nbsp;I&#39;m hoping to integrate a control interface into my EV Motorcycle if I can ever afford to finish it.

That&#39;s it for now. &nbsp;Till next time.&nbsp;"

Raleigh is so smart it&#39;s crazy. &nbsp;I&#39;ve seen kids her age and not to be mean but she&#39;s so far ahead in every department. &nbsp;I love it when she&#39;ll walk up to someone and have an in depth, legible, and rational conversation with them. &nbsp;The person is usually very surprised. &nbsp;I just look at her for a period and it amazes me that she&#39;s her own little person. &nbsp;She&#39;s so pure of intent and heart, I just hope it&#39;s something she can keep as long as this mean old world will let her. &nbsp;We had a conversation the other day about her being able to do anything she wants, even &quot;boy&quot; things. &nbsp;I made sure she knew she could be whatever she wants but was totally okay when she said she wanted to be a princess. &nbsp;I can live with that.

Korben is walking everywhere. &nbsp;It&#39;s so nice as time progresses that he becomes more self sufficient. &nbsp;He can go up and down the stairs now and we let him follow us around instead of picking him up to go to another room. &nbsp;Kalee says he has my smile which I can only hope he uses for good, because of it&#39;s great power over women, hehe. &nbsp;He&#39;s pretty much got &quot;Dog, Dada, Mama, Ball, and Uh-Oh&quot; down pat. &nbsp;I can&#39;t wait till he starts talking and I can converse with him as I do with Raleigh.

Kalee and I are as great as ever. &nbsp;She&#39;s still the light of my life and time seems to slip by with her. &nbsp;She mentioned that we&#39;ve been together almost 10 years now. &nbsp;And until I read her LJ I hadn&#39;t realized all the tribulations we&#39;ve survived together, BECAUSE of each other. &nbsp;She has a real dedication to staying fit which has kept her as beautiful as ever. &nbsp;I have a sense of pride, just shy of boastful when I show people pictures of her. &nbsp;I&#39;m just so lucky.

Work is going well. &nbsp;It seems as though i&#39;ve weathered some storms in my department and I expect no calamities on the horizon. &nbsp;My building is getting ready for a 35 million dollar renovation so I&#39;m looking forward to the challenge of being a technical person in a 2 year long project. &nbsp;Not sure what&#39;s on the other side of that finish line but it appears UA will take care of me.

Something of a late development in 2012 I&#39;ve started another business. &nbsp;I&#39;ve learned some hard lessons from the demise Sterling Studios and do not plan to make the same mistakes. &nbsp;Thankfully I have no overhead, no employees, no bills (of note) and no ongoing equipment needs to keep this endeavor making money. &nbsp;I&#39;ve made in my first job almost as much as I made in the entirety of Sterling Studios&#39;s gross income. &nbsp;I hope that this business is a source for new stability and financial security for my family while not sacrificing my home presence for those benefits. &nbsp;Here&#39;s to Sterling Installs, live long and prosper."

A sash which is only given to those who have dedicated themselves to a physical ideal of what is considered a warrior. Due to circle problems and lack of training partners I spun my wheels for a year and learned what I could when I could. Then an old friend came back to town with the same goal and we decided to work toward this together. So knife sharpens upon stone man sharpened upon man. We got better and learned. Though the finish line seemed to keep moving forward, so did we.<br /><br />On August 18th 2012 we both completed a grueling, nearly seven hour physical trial. We ran, we swam, we jumped, we fought our way through everything. In the end my brother and I crossed the finish line. My cup was empty.

Korben will be 4 months old soon and he's a joy to be around.  He has the best smile I've ever seen and loves to coo and laugh.  I think he's going to be a positive kid.  It's so great and strange to be going through all this again.  Looking for the roll over, making noises to get a smile, and being amazed when he starts understanding what's going on around him.  I think he's already partial to his sister.

Raleigh is holding conversations and loves to talk....a lot.  I caught a glimpse of her sitting in the grass with the cat explaining that the house had four windows and why it was important.  Unfortunately she got up before I could snap a picture.  I love overhearing her playing with her toys and listening to the conversations they have.  Kalee and I have had to start curving what we watch on TV since she's completely able to understand the basics of a TV show.  You can only tell your kid that they're playing so many times when something bad happens on TV.

Work has been pretty okay.  Not having an exact start date has proved difficult trying to celebrate one year at this job.  I feel as though I've hit my stride and settled in to my role here.  My techs are dependable for the most part.  I'm hoping to get my student manager back as a graduate assistant.  I'm angling for a raise in my next review.  Right now I'm 30 cents above what the minimum pay is for my position at UA.  I'm hoping to get that raised to the median pay which would be a roughly $2.50 hourly increase.

I'm almost done with the sunroom.  I just have to get it looking nice and I'll be satisfied.  I'm not as below budget as I'd like which leaves less for nice furniture and add ons.  Considering we got quotes around $40,000 to build it I think I'm sitting pretty at below $4,000 all things considered.  I can't wait to finally give Kalee her sunroom.  I feel great being able to do something for her that I know she'll appreciate and enjoy.  Not to mention our kids being able to get some fresh air without being devoured by bugs.  As soon as I'm done I think a cookout is in order.

Work is much better.  We're getting multiple compliments and event won a Student Affairs spotlight award.  In just over a month I will have been at my new job one year and at the University for over 2.  My office is being given more projects and my techs are much more dependable than they were.  

I was looking to go back to school and get my masters in higher education administration but I think my old GPA might be a detrimental factor to this effort.  We'll see how that goes.  I want something that will help me advance within the university but that might not be completely worth it."

"event","So not withstanding the sadness of losing my Nana this week....

Apparently my entire Tech Office stinks.  We suck.  We are the opposite of good.  I honestly bought into the idea that my office is real easy to blame when things go wrong.  But that thinking has become dangerous.  

Last Wednesday we had the first Tech meeting we've had in a while.  I organized it and even made the topic list.  Now I'm a very ""nuts and bolts"" type of guy.  I see a problem, I fix it.  What ensued was an example of what all that can go wrong in a meeting.  My entire team (including myself) has demonstrated that we cannot be held to a higher standard of service.  We do the absolute minimum to get by, and sometimes not even that.  It's an atmosphere of defeat with no greater ownership of the problems of the Ferguson Center.  

This is all laid out for me in a closed door meeting with the director and 2 other Ast. directors.  I felt like I was in front of a firing squad.  I felt like I just figured out I've been blind to the suckage I'm in charge of.  I was told various missed opportunities and short comings, that honestly left me embarrassed and angry.  My boss told me that I was a great tech, but he hired a leader and I wasn't doing that.  Whenever a big problem or project came up I was the first to jump up and do it.  Instead of developing my techs so they can be as well rounded as possible.  They repeated various times that my job isn't on the line and that I just need to work differently.  However this brings back the ball of stress in my stomach I just got suppressed.  That thought that my family's future is uncertain.  That at the drop of a hat my professional career that I've been SO proud of could just end any moment.

So that happened on Wednesday/Thursday.  My boss told me to not come in on Friday due to the death in my family.  So I've had this going through my head all weekend, just making me anxious every time I think about it.  I scheduled a mandatory meeting for my techs on monday where I don't know exactly what I'll do.  Somewhere between spreading some positive reinforcement and reading them the riot act I suppose."

I'm only sad for us left behind who have one less blessing in this world.  She had no pain in her last few weeks and went peacefully in her sleep.  She used to tell me about working in the bakery, about how fog in San Francisco was so thick you could cut it with a knife, and how I special I was.  She was always so loving and protective of me.  When I got married she LOVED my choice and suddenly I was charged with ""treating her right"" with her shaking her finger at me and smiling.  When we had Raleigh the finger shaking doubled.

Raleigh
Is growing up so fast it hurts.  As much as I love talking with her and asking her questions and her mannerisms I sometimes miss how little(r) she used to be.  She's learned the word ""NO"" quite well.  I sense a very independent attitude in her that we'll have to keep an eye on.  I always thought it sounded weird or corny when people said ""All I have to do is think about her/him, and I smile"".  Now I understand.  When I'm at work and I think about Raleigh and all the funny things she does it just brings an involuntary smile to my face.  Like I'm smiling from my soul and it just so happens to show on my face.  Kalee can now put her hair up with bands and stuff which struck me strangely.  I remember when she barely had hair.  It was course and you could see her scalp through the strands.  Now she's got wonderful, full hair that just shows how old she's getting.  It's awesome being a dad.

Korben
Is giving his momma hell.  Everyday it seems like Kalee has another ailment.  I really feel for her and wish I could shoulder some of the discomfort, but I can't.  Kalee says he's all knees and elbow and is VERY active.  I can now feel him kicking very easily on Kalee's stomach.  I don't know why but I have a suspicion that he'll come out looking like the men on my mom's side of the family; very tall and lanky.  I'll probably be looking up to him by the time he's 16.

Work
Every day I'm there my fear of something going wrong with the job lessens.  Every day I get new challenges and love solving them.  After only a month of having my new office/nook downstairs in storage with the tech guys they've moved me upstairs to be in the administration offices with the directors and such.  I'm slowly but surely getting involved with as many projects as I can and endearing myself to other departments that we work with.  Just today I have 3 out of building meetings.  One with Judicial Affairs for a hearing, one with Fiscal Affairs for an event, and one in Rose Administration for a tech room evaluation.  I think I'm finally starting to speak the corporate language and building relationships within the University system.  I just hope to move up within Student Affairs sometime because I'm enthralled with my bosses, coworkers, techs, and my job in general.

Raleigh is doing great.  She's growing more everyday.  It's so cool to see her having the mental capacity to form sentences, make decisions, and follow instructions.  She's so damn smart it's crazy.  I think she's going to have a decently outgoing personality.  Considering her parents I think that's normal.  She's very social and doesn't like anyone to be left behind or excluded.  Although I can mostly see her mother in her I think she's going to take after me in some ways as well.  Like totally being okay with the way things are going, very laid back and ""go with the flow"".  Can't wait to see what's next.

Korben is a bit of an enigma.  ""technically"" he's not even a HE yet since we got our ultrasound early and they've been known to be wrong when taken that early.  Kalee has held off from painting the room (which is killing her) for fear that we'll get to the next ultrasound and they'll proclaim ""it's a girl!"".  Don't get me wrong, as long as the baby is healthy I'll be happy, but we are hoping for a little boy.  We just got done putting his crib together so we're as prepared as I think we can get right now.

My job is going pretty good.  I learn something new each day and I think they're happy with how I'm performing.  I've been told on more than one occasion that I've turned the department around very well.  I have a decent budget to overhaul the AV in my theater and people are tapping me for more and more projects.  I like the responsibility and sense of usefulness but it's very draining keeping up with everything.  The higher ups have mentioned that I need to dial down my go-getter attitude and delegate instead of rushing out the door every chance I get to get my hands into a project.  I'm just not good at delegating I guess.

That's about it right now."

It was so easy to get discouraged because I felt I was on the one way track to doing this kind of stuff the rest of my life.  I'll be honest, that depressed the hell out of me.  I was jealous of people (Kalee included) who had offices, respectful duties, and real responsibilities.  Positions that were in some way ""important"" and that you could build a future with.  I always felt guilty asking God for these things because I feel I'm so overly-blessed in others.  I've got the greatest wife and kid a man could hope for.  I got my health and great friends.  

After being here at Student Affairs a few months I can't imagine me liking my job more.  These guys treat me very well.

As much as I loathe smoking I say nay.  I believe that businesses should have the right to prohibit smoking within 30 feet of their doors (which some already have) but walking down the street seems fairly harmless to me.  Smokers sometimes don't realize that smoke travels, and thus I've walked out of a building into a face and lung full of smoke.  Outside is usually a safe place to kill yourself slowly with tobacco as long as you're not hovering at a entrance/exit where it's kind of missing the point of BEING outside."

A few weeks later and PRESTO!  Kalee is with child.  We're very happy but also nervous about having another one and the extra effort involved.  But billions of people have managed having more than one kid so I figure so can we.  We both want a boy so bad because that's just a whole different dynamic we could explore having already had a girl.  Not to say we wouldn't be thankful for whatever gender we get, it's just our preference.  I just want to go get some toy tools and some Gi-Joes for my boy.

The past several weeks I've been working 2 jobs.  I'd work my normal Transportation Services job from 8-5pm and then go do tech support from 5-10pm.  Needless to say this was wearing on my.  I didn't get to see my girls hardly at all.  I basically dropped Kung Fu altogether.  I couldn't hang out with friends, all my home projects were delayed, and I was drop-dead tired all the time.  I figured it was temporary until my temp job decided to poop or get off the pot and hire me or let me go.  Well they decided to bring me on full time as the Tech Support Supervisor at the Ferguson Center.  Truth be told it's a freakin sweet job.  It's mostly a stress free workplace and I like most of my student workers.  It's a good bump in pay (not as much as I'd like) and it opens the door for me to move into higher positions in the future, much like the ticket job was for this one.

Cold or hot, Rain or Shine for 8 hours.  I get off at 5pm and then walk across the plaza and start my IT shift from 5pm 10pm.  Go home, sleep, get up and do it all over again.  And then come the weekend I most likely have to at least do a set up for my Photography job.  I'm exhausted.  I had a conversation when all this first started almost a month ago with Kalee.  It was going to be tough for a while but hopefully by the end of it all I'd come out the other end with a career.  To her credit Kalee has rolled with the punches and picked up the extra slack at home like a champ.  She understands that I'm not doing this for my health.  I'm not doing it so I can buy myself things (because I don't), I'm doing it for them.

It seems the patience has paid off.  Yesterday I had a meeting with my boss and she let me know that my EXACT same job is being being put on the job board with the added benefit of being a full time position.  She made it apparent that she can't just GIVE me the job because that's against policy but she politely let me know that I have a HIGH probability of being chosen.  

I couldn't be happier with the job so far.  I'm a supervisor and my employees seemingly like me (nice ego boost).  And I feel genuinely useful to the management who needs direction and consistency in my new department.  I've expressed that I feel that I could be of much better use to them if I but had more time to do it in while trying to not pressing the FT issue to the point of annoyance.  This was always met with a dodge of the subject and/or dismissal which tended to make me nervous.  It seems they were taking me on a test run before they decided to buy the car.

This job doesn't pay as much as I'd hoped and that's mostly because they've seemed to have dodged the necessity of classifying me as a supervisor, instead classifying me as a simple PC Tech.  This is something I plan on clarifying a few year from now when I'm much more solidified and safe.  So in 2 weeks I will be taking off the summer as previously planned from Transportation Services but I most likely will not be coming back thanks to my brand new shiny (well paying) position as the Ferguson Center Tech Support Manager.

Shiny."

So wow, it's been 3 months since my last update.  I wish I could use the excuse of not a lot happening but that'd be a lie.  Here's the synopsis.

RALEIGH
She's growing up so fast.  Now that I can ask her questions and converse (albeit rudimentary) I love her even more if that's possible.  She gets into everything and wants to know what everything is.  we're trying to instill manners in her young and it seems to be working.  She says please and thank you and tends to help out in her own little way around the house.  She's not even two yet and she's in panties.  granted she has accidents from time to time but she's really good about coming up and saying ""pee pee!"" so we can put her on the potty.  I swear she gets smarter every single day.  

KUNG FU
I'm scooting along in the Green Sash trials and tribulations.  Unfortunately my circle is not with me.  Due to one thing or another it seems most of my circle is preoccupied at best and some are MIA at worst.  I've found an unlikely but welcome training partner in Jon Wilson.  He's the special forces guy from California that is a Siheng but never got a chance to officially go through green sash.  It's been awesome to have him as a training buddy and also to have Luke and Jason come down from Bham every Thursday for some instruction.  My Kung Fu schedule stands a chance of being disrupted big time in the near future, more on that later.

WORK
I've got to break this up between my different jobs.
---UA Transportation Services---
This is my regular 40/hr a week job.  Couldn't ask for a better job.  I have great coworkers and great bosses.  I get all the overtime I want with no pressure what-so-ever.  Pay has always been a drawback but I always saw this job as a way to get my foot in the door to move up the ladder within the University system.

---K&S IMAGES---
Things just picked up here.  Keith Davis (my boss) just purchased a brand new 20K mobile studio so he can print and sell pictures on site before an event even ends.  It's a great idea and he should make a bundle on it.  I wish this opportunity had come around when I didn't have a while back because I could've really dedicated some time and possibly made something of the venture with him.  With my job the way it is and the fact he can't promise me money its hard to put his work as a high priority in the past and it's only going to get busier.  I fear I might have to eventually train a replacement if other areas work out the way I believe they will.

---FedEx---
I worked for FedEx before I came to UA.  They've asked me back a time or two and especially for holiday work.  Truth be told it was a nice little bit of extra money in addition to the paid holidays thanks to UA.  My old boss there called me yesterday and asked if I wanted to be the Saturday relief driver for when another driver calls in sick or has a vacation planned.  I told him I had a lot on my plate right now but that I would get back to him on that. 

---University Programs---
This is the big Tamale.  I applied at this UA department for a position that seems perfect for me.  It took a while for them to call me for an interview but they finally did.  the first one went well and then 2 weeks later they call me for a follow up.  After I did that one two weeks passed and I figured if I didn't get a call before spring break they most likely went with someone else.  Well yesterday I was getting ready to wrap up my work day I got the call and they offered me the job.  Long story short it's an AV/Computer Support Technician and I'd be working with AV equipment in the Ferg here on campus.  What they surprised me with is that it's basically a supervisory position in the fact that I'd be managing almost 40 student workers.  Needless to say this is kind of intimidating but I feel I can adapt and do well.  The reality check is that it's a Temporary position that I'd work after my regular job (which will suck for a while).  This also stands a chance of reducing Kung Fu work to NIL.  They gave me the wink/wink nudge/nudge that this would most likely turn into a permanent one eventually which needless to say would be very nice.  I won't go into the salary of the permanent job but lets just say it'd go a long way to my families financial security.  I'm very excited.

FAMILY
My Nana is getting pretty bad.  I know she's 96 years old but I figured she'd go before anything like Dementia set in, which it has.  It's hard to hear my Aunt talking about how hard it is to explain to her multiple times that her daughter (my mom) is dead and gone.  Dementia is something I don't want anyone to experience.  It's gut wrenching.  We actually drove down and visited her today in Thomasville and it was pretty good.  She knew who we all were (it seemed) and was in good spirits.  I just wish her to have peace one way or another, I love her so much.

Kalee and I are looking to expand the family soon so we decided to pay the ART Fertility a visit to see what the dealio was.  See, we had problems conceiving with Raleigh and after all sorts of hormones and procedures it turned out Kalee needed a simple surgery to clear up some endometriosis which did the trick.  So now the doctor told us we could just do the surgery again and skip all the other treatments, which is what we wanted to hear.  We have her surgery scheduled and I'm getting excited at the thought of little Corbin coming into the world.

That's about it right now.  Please submit your questions in the form of an answer."

"event","So after a very long time the state got back to me and asked me to come take the physical tests for trooper certification.  I went and got all that done and set up a polygraph for the 28th, and we all remember how much <a href=""http://briansterling.livejournal.com/2009/10/08/"">I love polygraphs</a>.  Not holding my breath on the Trooper thing.  Anyway I'm still wrestling with that old problem.  What to do.

It seems a damn shame that I get free classes every semester for working at UA but have no idea what to use them for.  All the freaking degrees here are 4 year degrees and I don't have the time to devote to pursuing another bachelors.  It seems they've designed the degrees in such a way that a graduate cannot come back and take a minimum number of classes in a certain major and obtain another degree because that person already has all the core courses obtained.

I looked online and even at their satellite campuses and UA seems to think it's too good for some associates degrees, certificates, or certifications.  Which are the only ones I can pursue due to my time constraints.  Would it kill UA to offer a welding certification.  I know Shelton offers tons of those kinds of classes down the street but I don't get free classes there not to mention I would have to quite my job to pursue it.

Don't get me wrong, I love my job.  But I see myself just getting by instead of getting ahead like I want.  I'd love nothing more than to put money into our debts, our mortgage(s), our house, or God forbid savings.  I guess there's always FedEx.

What do YOU think I should do?"

"event","So I didn't give a comprehensive vacation update when I got back in to town.  Sue me.  I'm so busy I rarely have time for anything anymore.  But here goes.

Raleigh is getting smarter by the day.  She can identify a cow, dog, cat, elephant, and Michael Jackson (don't ask).  And can do the noises for each.  I'd say her vocabulary is between 25 and 35 words and other communicates.  I say it that way because she also talks through some sign language and Spanish.  She's growing up so fast but she's finally gotten to the point where I can really play with her.  Hide and go seek, chasing, surprising her, rudimentary games, it's just too much fun.  She stayed over at my dads this past weekend and got to spend time with not only him, but my sister, her kids, and my Grandmother from Hartford Alabama who she hasn't seen in forever.  She developing quite the personality and I'm just glad she has a really sunny disposition.

---

The job front is on the straight and narrow.  I've been a ticket nazi for 8 months now and I see no sign of that changing.  It's a really stable job with good perks and good people.  Getting comfortable for a long term stint with this job is making me both at ease and nervous.  I want stability and consistency in my income for the sake of my family.  I also still have ambition to be more than I am.  Not to mention the pay is something I don't think we could have a bigger family with.  Truth be told I could probably get on with FedEx Express which pays very well but I'd be back to square one with an exhausting and draining job that takes away my family weekends.  I'm still waiting on my ranking for UAPD here but I'm not holding my breath considering there are no open positions.  I keep trying to find out ways of making extra cash while still keeping my job but those ways are rare.  I can just see myself at 45 still throwing out parking cones and that makes me a little sad.  

But I've always been a ""silver lining"" kinda guy (pun intended).  I've got a great family a good job and great friends."

I'm sick today so I've got time to explain each one.

<b>Halle Berry/X-men-Catwoman   =   Rosario Dawson </b>
  I know I've had a thing for Rosario Dawson for a while but I really believe that she would've made a better storm.  I mean, it's not hard to beat <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91Dyav1qHt0 #t=02m00s"">lines like these</a>.  She's more physically imposing (taller) and has a stronger face.  Remember Ororo is a badass as well.


<b>Nicholas Cage/Ghost Rider    =   Anyone</b>
  I'm not a huge Cage basher.  I've actually liked him in National Treasure.  But if it's one thing you can say about Cage it's that he's consistent.  Consistent in the way that you get the same damn character in everyone of his movies.  He doesn't have a large acting range with some <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WPZWfp_iM"">exceptions</a>  The character Johnny Blaze has a depth of character and a inner conflict that Cage just cannot bring out with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1hZNHPVVAQ #t=02m10s"">no notable exceptions</a>.


<b>Ben Affleck/Daredevil        =   Michael C. Hall (Dexter)</b>
  Now Affleck has a little more range than Cage but he still falls flat in my book.  Of course no amount of acting can make up for corny writing but I think Hall could bring a certain intimidation factor while keeping with the clean cut look of MM.  Just take care <a href=""http://media.photobucket.com/image/dexter%20gif/lasirene/11k9nh1jpg.gif?o=21"">NOT to piss him off.</a>


<b>Tom Hanks/Da Vinci Code      =   Russel Crowe</b>
  I really hate to write this because I really like Tom Hanks.  Movies like ""Joe vs. The Volcano"", ""Castaway"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are some of the best movies I've ever seen.  For reasons I'm attributing to bad writing this movie is on my list.  Even though Langdon is clearly an intellectual the movie centers around action as much as suspense.  I just think that Crowe could've carried the film better in that respect.  Plus he could've pulled off that <a href=""http://rencher.com/images/20090311a.jpg"">God-awful mullet</a> better.

  
<b>Keanu Reeves/Dracula         =    Will Smith</b>
   Keanu Reeves sucks in anything that doesn't start with the line ""Bill & Ted"".  Period.  Smith was actually being courted for the role initially but he expressed that he had <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1KlzGJw_Gw #t=01m05s "">""more important-serious theatrical exploits to pursue"".</a>


<b>Mark Wahlberg/The Happening  =    Edward Norton</b>
   Wahlberg does a good job of <a href=""http://www.gifbin.com/bin/1238512492_the-happening-wahlberg.gif"">looking confused</a> when killer pollen threatens the human race.  I however believe this look to be honest and geniune.  I believe he really doesn't <a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/37753/saturday-night-live-mark-wahlberg-talks-to-animals"">know what's going on.</a>  Granted, I don't think many people did because the movie was stupid.  But Wahlberg has always looked this way in any movie where he didn't play a hitman, a cop, or a <a href=""http://video.yahoo.com/watch/7040514/18309577"">shirtless guy</a>.  Norton has the acting prowess and vulnerabliity to nail this role.  He might have even saved this film from getting a <a href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10007985-happening/""> 1/5 from Rotten Tomatoes</a>"

"event","Okay, you've heard me bitch and moan about how my degree is useless and how it's SO unfair that I got dealt a bad hand, and all the woe-is-me crap I've been spouting.  So I've decided to try some initiative.  

I'm been in contact with ALSDE, City and County BOE's, and now some online colleges so I can finally nail down just what specifically I need to do (and pay) to be a licensed teacher in Alabama.  I'm pretty sure I only need 4 education classes and they're offered everywhere online.  I just need to know if I need to take additional history classes in order to fulfill a minimum requirement for the certification.  They sure do not make it easy to figure out.

Although I've only been at this job 4.5 months I can already feel myself getting very comfortable.  It's an easy job, with hardly any stress (not counting game days or move-in) plus it can pay well with all the overtime.  I've expressed how this job is a good stable launching point for me to find something better but honestly, I could do worse.  I took my UAPD written exam a few days ago so that might be something in motion.  But I've learned to cast a wide net.  Jobs are tough to come by yet alone careers, and that's just what I need.  I want to have another baby but we don't want to shoot ourselves in the foot financially.  Staying in the black (insert joke) and providing for the family that we have NOW is more a priority than providing for the one we are THINKING about having.  Still, I gotst me some baby fever.  I just hope something works out soon.

This weekend I finished up on it and I gotta say, I'm pretty damn proud of myself (and Kalee).  I managed to plan, cut, arrange, cement, attach, and create without totally messing things up.  There are still a few little things I want to add to the fence to spruce it up.  Here's the pics.

The ongoing drama of me and my job(s) just gained a new dark chapter today.  About 3 weeks ago there was murmuring about a budget blunder in my department and that my head was on the chopping block.  After that it died down and it seemed as though my job had weathered that particular storm.  Now it seems my head is back on the block.

Yesterday I walked into our office and asked a couple of the people a question: ""Hey (insert names), if I chip in a few bucks for toner could I use the copier?"".  They both proceed to laugh at how trivial a thing it was and she comes over and helps me print out some copies to which she saw exactly what I was copying.  I was copying some fliers for my rental house.  Every few days I'll throw up a few fliers while doing my rounds.  It takes all of 30 seconds out of my walking, so it's no big deal right?

Wrong.  I get called into the office where my boss accuses me of using company resources and violating the employee non-solicitation policy.  I explain to him that I offered to chip in for toner and that I didn't realize putting up a flier beside ones that say ""free kittens"" or ""Skateboard for sale"" or ""Room for Rent"" was such an egregious trespass and that I'd take them all down.  He tells me that it's a serious offense and that he doesn't know if I'll have a job by the end of the week after he talks to his boss.

A little overwhelmed and confused I called a lower supervisor, whom I've become quite chummy with.  Turns out that the budget problems have come back with a vengeance and that this whole thing has nothing to do with using a copy machine and putting up a few fliers.  It has everything to do with politics and money.  What pisses me off is that they can't just look me in the eye and tell me the truth.  Because getting laid off sounds a HELL of a lot better than fired for breach of ethics (or whatever).  So now I can't list UA in my job history and have no chance to work at UA in any other position for at least two years because of this ""blunder"" on my file.

So now I'm workin on getting in with Charter Communications (not looking good or bad).

I've applied at tons of places.

If all else fails it's back to the grueling 65 hour a week job at FedEx, ugh."

So my job at UA is now secure.  I'm happily chugging my way through every sweat filled, yet stress-less, day handing out misery to kids who don't obey the parking rules.  It's a decent job.  Pays decent, not well, but decent.  I get teachers retirement and some holidays off because I work for the state (technically).  I get to chill at the computer lab and check my mail for certain amounts of time as long as my ticket count stays up.  Although I don't think they'd notice or care if it did go down.  The job has the possibility of some upwards or diagonal movement up the ladder.  All in all a ""safe"" job.  But the fact remains that I make barely more than I spend a month in my mortgage and it's almost a ""I've given up"" kind of job.  And maybe I have.  

My old boss from FedEx has been calling me trying to get me to come back and deliver for him.  Needless to say that he'd never pay me what I want to do that grueling 65 hour a week job.  But it's nice to be wanted.  It was easy to turn down for my nice, stable job here at UA.

And then God's just GOTTA mess with my head again.  

Pretext:  I've worked off and on for a photographer that also runs a video biz in town for over 3 years.  Him and his partner are great guys, they pay well.  But it also amounts to around 10 hours a month.  Nothing serious.  About 2 weeks ago Scott (the partner who also works at Charter Communications) told me about a temp position at Charter doing what I've been doing for years.  I thank him for the info but quickly dismiss the offer because of the temp status.

He calls me tonight to give me the inside track on the position.  Turns out that they're telling him it will be a temp position at first but that it will turn into a permanent one if the person works out and fits in well.  So now I'm in doubt.  Once again a job is being dangled in front of my face like a carrot in front of the donkey.  So now that begs the debate.  Is it worth the risk?

Pros:
It pays more and is Full time
the job is actually in my field finally
Scott was adamant that they're restaffing since they stupidly cut to many personel last year.

Cons:
No matter what they say it's still a Temp job.
Who's to say there's not another recession and they do layoffs again (see: square 1)
They might not like me and just decide not to keep me even though they could


If I went for it and fell on my face I'd be endangering my family's financial future.  If I pass it up am I going to wonder what if whilst I toil in a medial job handing out parking tickets?  Is it Ego that pushes me to pursue the job or is it positive ambition of wanting for both me AND my family.  I hate being confused."

"event","So earlier this week a little birdy told me that there had been a huge snafu in the Transportation Services budget.  This budget is yearly starting in August.  Apparently they were lined up to be WAY over budget and needed to make up for it somewhere.  Needless to say my job would possibly be on the chopping block for the rest of the summer since I'm brand new have no seniority.

Having a quasi-manager confirm this info (by not denying it) really put a damper on my day.  I kept saying to myself, ""no one's luck is THIS bad"".  I mean this job isn't a career and I do walk all day in the hot sun, but it's a steady job that isn't stressful.  Whilst walking around handing out sadness to unsuspecting motorist I get a call from a number I didn't recognize and I answer...

Her:  ""Is this Brian Sorrells?""
Me:   ""yes it is.""
Her:  ""Hi this is XXXX with Woodland Forest Elementary, are you still interested in the position you applied for a few months back?""
Me:   ""Absolutely, yes ma'am.""
Her:  ""Can you make (Appointment)?
Me:   ""Yes ma'am.""

Call it fate or coincidence but I get a call for an interview on the very same day that I found out I might be getting laid off, albeit for the summer but still.  So I call in sick today and go to the interview.

I show up early and the principle asks me to wait outside.  After a while she brings me in a room where she and the head coach sit and ask me questions.  Questions were pretty standard but I was nervous because technically I had never taught elementary school-age children since Tae-Kwon-Do almost 15 years ago.  Teenagers, young adults, adults, and professors sure, but no kids.  I don't doubt myself I just know I had no real experience to lean on.  

Despite that they seemed genuinely impressed.  So much that after the interview she asked if I'd be interested in doing an after school program if I get hired.  She asked me to accompany her on some rounds and introduced me to the lady that runs the program.  Everything is nice and all but then I mentioned that I had a Bachelors degree.

Princ:  ""Wait, you have a degree?""
Me:     ""Um, yes ma'am.  In Telecommunications.""
Princ:  ""I must have not seen that part on your print out.""
Me:     ""Yeah, don't worry about it.  It's a pretty useless degree around here, lol.""
Princ:  ""Actually.....""

She then goes on to mention that the school has a ""news program"" that they're very proud of and have a lot of fun doing but that they really need help with.  She drags me over to another lady who runs the program.  Turns out they won a grant last year but have no expertise to expand the show.  Needless to say that loved what I told them and had MANY questions to ask.  At the end of my time there a 20 minute interview had turned into a 2 hour conversation.  Made me feel important and that I might have a place where I can be of use in many ways.  They even asked if I'd be interested in teaching some kids ""karate"" classes on occasion.  

The lady in charge of the programs told me that I can expect a call soon and that she'd try her best to get me in.  It's only a PE Teacher position but everyone starts somewhere.

Here's hoping."

"event","Well, I start my new job tomorrow at UA.  I will be roaming around campus bestowing parking fine on my hapless victims.  I'm excited about this job.  It pays decent and I don't have to crush my fingers under boxes or work 65 hours a week.  I will however have to walk a bit and have to be outside in 100+ degree weather.  No job is perfect though.

I starting to get very concerned with how my resume' looks.  It gives off the inkling that I am a ""job jumper"".  One of those people who are never satisfied with their lot in life and always thinks the grass is greener on the other side.  Ironically, all I want is a steady job that I can stay a long time at.  It just seems like bad luck and bad timing are always kickin me in the nuts.  Let's recap

I served tables at the Cypress Inn and worked at the FRC all through college.  I left Cypress because I gave a customer back his 1.75 tip on a $80 ticket (to which he got great service) and management and I agreed I had been serving tables too long.  And I couldn't work at the FRC anymore because I was no longer a student.

After graduation I got a job at The Home Depot.  I really liked working there and was making damn decent money being a specialist.  Unfortunately after a death in the family I went part time with the guarantee that I could come back full time whenever I wanted.  Unfortunately that promise was broken and I was stuck working 8-12 hours a week and had to quit.

After that I tried starting my own business just as the recession was hitting and let just say that it was not a successful venture.

I soon got a job as a PC Technician at Circuit City.  I had to work 2 months as a sales associate before I could be moved up into the ""firedog"" division.  As luck would have it people really like buying things from someone who can tell them how the product was built, how to operate it, and give training.  I soon had the highest sales in the store and in the true spirit of ""no good dead goes unpunished"" I was denied my upward mobility in order to boost numbers.  This way of operating left me unsurprised when Circuit City folded in January of 09.  

I collected unemployment but finally landed in a job I was sure I could make a career out of.  The Tuscaloosa County Sherrifs Office.  I was hired on as a telecommunicator which was basically a dispatcher and operator in one.  Very quickly it became obvious that the one talent necessary for this profession, I just didn't have.  Talking to more than 5 people at once was beyond my scope and we soon parted ways.  I really enjoyed that job and was sad to move on.

In late November I scored a job working holiday temp work at FedEx.  Lots of fun at first but once I was hired on by a contractor I started getting screwed.   *see previous posts.

In fact the ONLY consistent job I've had since graduation has been working for Keith Davis.  I first started for him in April of 2007.  That's three years of editing, photoshop, and filming.  I just wish he could afford to make me full time.  I think I will start to claim this as my main job with the others just being ""making ends meet"" side jobs.

Now it's on to UA. What's pathetic is that I passed the written exam for Northport Police officer and have been scheduled for a Physical Agility test on friday.  So in other words to pursue being an officer I would have to call in sick in my very first week of employment.  I'm pretty sure no dickhead would fire me but it would be a bad impression.  I'm wondering if I should just give up on the whole police thing and accept my ""lot in life"" of handing out parking tickets; or take the chance which could pay off big time.  I hate not knowing what to do."

How much is the bid worth?  35 grand.  It's the first time he's offered me anything close to a concrete agreement.  I told him that if he can pay me 30K a year, he's got me.  If this really happens I'm going to be working at my own pace, on my own schedule, doing what I love.  Who knows, stranger things have happened.

"event","So I put in my two week notice this morning.  My boss was adamant that I would be happier and make better money with him.  His simple reasoning?  I can just post his email:

-------------------

Here is what you will make if you stay...

$560+$40 pickup bonus = $600/week on a 5 day week.  If you work from 6:45 am until 6:15 pm, that is 11.5 hrs/day or 57.5 hrs/week.   $600  divided by 57.5 hrs = 10.43/hr  (avg hourly rate including overtime).   If you can do it in less time, your average hourly rate increases.

The other job will pay $410/week as I calculate it.
-------------------

Problems with this logic.  
1.  You CAN'T physically do it in ""less time"" because of the mandatory pickup at 6pm.  And I can't start any later in the day or I won't get stuff done nor can I reasonably predict a slow day and come in later because of that.  

2.  the rate of pay is still standing at 7.58/hr.  That is NOT an acceptable rate of pay for a job this difficult.  He's acting like getting 60 hours a week is great and that is a good deal.  If I were making a fair $10 an hour (Other drivers make around 14) I could be pulling in 2300 bucks a month and then it MIGHT be worth the pain, long hour, and exhaustion at the end of the day.  

3.  The assumption that I WANT to work 60 hours a week.  I don't.  I can't spend time with Raleigh and barely any time with Kalee.  On the weekend all I want to do is konk out and rest when I should be fixing things or having fun with the family.

So yeah, I'll give him an opportunity to match UA's $10/hr pay (which he won't) and then I'm out.  The traffic monitor job has much better hours, much less physically demanding work, and it gives me time to reinvest in my self.

So now that begs the question; What the hell should I do?  I have a short beginning list and please feel free to say ""you'd suck at that."" or ""No way, try this instead.""  Any and all input would be appreciated.

-----Getting a Masters Degree online (Expensive/Takes Longer Vs. Better Options)
Masters in Education or Criminal Justice

-----Courses and Licenses  (more likely of a Dead End  Vs. Cheaper and plenty of work)
Getting a CDL

-----Certifications  (No guarantee of work  Vs. Affordable and many to choose from)
Home Inspector
HVAC Technician

"event","Not really.  I realized a while back that I only keep up this LJ for the sake of myself.  I have such a abhorrently horrible memory that it's nice to go back and see what was going on in my life at a certain time.

That being said, here...we...GO.

Fedex is shitty.  I have basically had everyone I know in Fedex and outside Fedex tell me I'm getting royally screwed at my job.  I already knew it wasn't great but had no idea it was so bad.  I was extremely desperate for a job when he offered and I know now that he sensed that and took advantage of it.  He lured me in with the promise of making $1800-$2000 bucks a month and that I'd work a very consistent schedule.  What he didn't tell me was that I would be working for $7.25 and working 65 hours a week.  And to note that is NOT an exaggeration like so many people online are prone to do.  I work 60 to 65 HOURS a week, Solid.  I leave at 6am and get home around 7pm or later.  The only good news I have is I get to put in my two week notice tomorrow morning.

Where is my new employer.  It's the good ole' University of Alabama.  It's not one of the positions that I so desperately wanted but it's 40 hours a week and 10 bucks an hour.  I will be a parking monitor.  This job will actually allow me to see my wife and kid as well as devote time to K&S Images which has brought me wonderful side-cash over the past 3 years.  I'm not looking forward to the cut in pay but it was only a matter of time before I either hurt myself or went crazy due to mental and physical exhaustion.  So walking around giving people tickets at UA seems to be a nice change of pace.

I've still got a horse in the race for a Northport Police Officer position.  But per my wife's queries and my unlucky track record has led me to doubt whether or not it's where God wants me in life.  I thought I'd make a good cop (still do) but I can't ignore all the signs pointing me away from this field.  I'm not sure I would pursue it any longer if Northport doesn't work out.

My father always told me a great southern saying ""If you keep doing what you always did, you'll keep getting what you always got.""  And what I've always got was entry level, dead-end jobs despite being a well spoken, out going, college educated young person.  So in true math style I must change one of the variables in the equation in order to procure a different result.  I've pretty much decided to reinvest in some sort of certification, certificate, or re-education in order to make myself more marketable in an already scarce workforce.  The question remains of what to ""reinvest"" myself into in order to find a career.  Guess I'll look more into that as I settle into my new job.

More importantly than all of this; Raleigh is doing GREAT.  Everyday it's like she's doing something new.  I'm so glad I'll be able to spend more time with her coming up soon.  She's already kinda-walking and eating real food.  She can't stand to have someone feed her and likes to take charge and feed herself.  Dada, Mama, Kitty, and clapping of her hands while saying ""yay"" are just a few of the things that make my heart melt.

Well that's it for now.  Till next time."

Christmas was great.  My little girl racked up on the goodies.  I think I successfully avoided embarrasing myself regarding the presents I got Kalee this year.  I really suck at picking out presents.  I got some cool schwag including a multi-fold ladder that I've wanted for forever.  It's really nice to have everyone over for the holidays (family AND friends) and feel that holiday warmth.  I simply cannot wait till Raleigh gets a little older and can appreciate the presents more than the wrapping paper, lol.

On the job front I've been working at FedEx for the holiday rush as a temporary worker.  I really liked running around all day on my own and doing the route the way I want with no one looking over my shoulder.  So I was elated when a contractor came to me and offered me a full time permanent job after the holidays working for the business division of FedEx.  I'll basically be delivering to commercial sites mostly.  Difference between that and Home Deliver (what I have been doing) is that I'll be delivering to less stops but with heavier loads.  But it's M-F and pays decent.  That's not to say I won't keep an eye out for something better.  Namely an A/V technician job at UA which I'm perfect for and the hiring manager contacted me about when the position is re-posted on Jan 4th.

So things are looking up around these parts.  I hope everything is going okay for you guys out there and Happy Holidays."

Apparently the little computer that was on my chest, fingers, and ass says that I steal from employers.  Yeah, it's news to me too.  The guys who did the test didn't want to hear about how annoyingly boyscout I am.  They didn't care that if a cashier misses a stick of gum I go back and pay for it.  They don't care that the people I've already told basically laughed at the mere thought of me stealing.  No, they like their little graphs and numbers and told me that they wouldn't suggest me for employment and to feel free to apply one year from today.  

So pending a small miracle I don't think TPD is going to hire me.  I can't remember a time where I have been this angry.  I can take it if I get booted for failing a test.  I can take it if I crash a car while training.  I can even take it if my trainer says ""This just isn't for you.""  But I'll be damned if some guy behind a laptop is going to get me booted because it says I've got sticky fingers at work.  I've worked very hard in my life for people to not question my integrity, and it's just debilitating to see what I thought was a reputable character assassinated by a damn bar graph."

<b>3.</b>  I had severe under-capitalization.  I'm my conservative quest to cost and risk this family as little as possible I didn't give the company the lifeblood it needed to really expand.  Lack of a storefront and a generous advertising campaign was a death-knell.

<b>4.</b>   I was unaware that videography, however great and professional, cannot stand alone in the wedding market place.  It must be saddled along-side photography as a ""add-on"" for a bride.  It's no secret that photography is probably the number one service brides seek out for their weddings first.  And transversely videography is darn near last, right next to that guy that releases doves.  



The simple fact that if I would have borrowed more money and endeavored to become a great photographer with video in tow, it might have made it.  All is not gloom and doom though.  I have a great new job at the county sheriffs department, we're looking to move into my dream house, and I've already got nibbles on selling my equipment.  You win some, you lose some.  I just wish my biz wasn't making it so hard to sell this house.

"event","You are now looking (figuratively) at the newest employee of the Tuscaloosa County Sheriffs Department.  Went in this morning to have a meeting with the chief (can't help but hear Maxwell Smart saying <i>""Sorry Cheif""</i>) and he gave me the thumbs up which led to an official offer of employment.  

As it stands right now I'm due to start as soon as they determine there are no drugs in my pee pee.  I will be a Dispatcher which means I have to coordinate police, fire, and emergency services for various situations.  It's a very intimidating job to be seen done but I'll give it the ole' College Try.  This job is also a common stepping stone to those who wish to be full blown police officers.  Yay me.

Seems the job fairy heard my prayers and granted my wish 

Both the city jobs looked great until the mayor instituted a hiring freeze till the end of the year.  UA parking actually called me and offered me a job.  Pays around 10 an hour so that's not shabby at all.  I went ahead and accepted since the other job was ""unofficially"" offered to me.  And that's the BIG one.  It's doing dispatch for the county sheriffs department.  It pays very nicely and the guy basically told me I've got the job.

Pros:
   1 Really nice pay (compared to what I HAVE been getting)
   2 Very stable.  Emergency services are rarely trimmed
   3 Two positions open and only five people made the cut
   4 He tells me since I have a degree in a tech field that I'm a shoe-in

Cons:
   1 A small transgression in my past may jeopardize my application (very unlikely)
   2 The burnout rate is unbelievable.  Either you can do this job, or not
   3 The job is INFINITELY more complicated than I had once thought.

I should know some time this week if I got it and then go in and take a polygraph test.  I'm very hopeful, because if I get this job then I'll finally have a career and we can move into a house where Raleigh can have her own room."

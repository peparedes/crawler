When we were dropping off the van this afternoon, we were greeted by a large, Jamaican man in his thirties who would check us in and sign our paperwork for the van rental. 

As I open the door and jump out of the van, the U-Haul man says to me, ""You have great appetite!"" 

""I, uh, what now?"" <i>Do I look really fat today!?</i>
""You have great appetite!"" he says again. ""You have great appetite... in women!""
I look toward Annie. 
""Oh! You think I have a pretty girlfriend!"" I exclaim. 
""Yes yes. Great appetite. Very good"". 

Yeah, well. I think I have pretty good taste in women too."

"event","The most striking aspect of <i>Man On Wire</i>, at least in the beginning, is footage of the twin towers under construction. It is a welcome contrast to the bombardment of destruction we've become so tragically accustomed to over the past 7 years. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3015/2734749158_a560618cf6_o.jpg"" align=""left"">

<i>Man On Wire</i> is the story of how wire walker and performance artist Philippe Petit turned his dream of walking a wire between the World Trade Center into a beautiful reality. 

The film is presented as if it were a bank heist. It's like a real life version of <i>Oceans Eleven</i>, replacing cocky lounge singers with passionate, French romantics. 

There is no mention of the towers inevitable demise, save for a few comments from Petit and his cohorts about how they had accomplished something that could never be accomplished again. 

It would cheapen Petit's unbelievable (not to mention, unfathomably dangerous) work of beauty to throw in some maudlin, quasi-patriotic aside that yes; the twin towers eventually fell. 

By omitting what we all already know, the film serves as a joyful memorial to the stunning architecture that was the twin towers. When Philippe Petit states that he could walk between the towers because he felt as though they belonged to him, he touched on the very essence of what a monument should be. 

The film is emotional only on a personal level, as we are made to understand the weight of what Petit and his accomplices had achieved, and never invites the audience to mourn the absent towers. 

Still, one scene did manage to take ahold of my heart for a moment. A photograph showing Philippe Petit's signature on the south tower is shown during the final epilogue of the film. My immediate reaction was, ""Wow, I wonder if that is still up there today""?

Or course I remembered, it isn't.

To be accurate the <i>network</i> is down. The wifi is working just fine (which is how I am able to post this right now)

However, what this means is dozens of six year old to ten year old kids can't log on to check their Webkins and as a result have been reduced to - do my eyes deceive me? - reading books! 

It's true! The children all exchange quizzical looks, unable to fathom what is transpiring. They become anxious, agitated. One little girl slowly sits down on the floor, her eyes darting wildly, as she looks up asking no one in particular, ""is... is this what's like, to die?""

They wander without aim until, what's this? It's colorful. The words are simple, but somehow clever. Words play with numbers; these fish, they are red, they are blue. 

Some children are still desperate for a fix. One little girl in a hajib, no older than six is at a computer playing with virtual blocks, aided by the guiding voice of Elmo. Another little boy, maybe seven or eight, is playing (I shit you not) MS Solitaire. 

Maybe this is the dawn of a new era. Maybe this is the birth of a new generation of luddites, who will take our society back to a simpler time. Maybe the fat, mustached librarian will learn better spanish, so he can come up with something better to say than, ""Um... aqui, los computadora no... work-o... fuctional-li.."""

"event","Riding shotgun in a Volvo sedan that smells like crayons down Smith street on our way to get Cuban sandwiches and mimosas, we pass a movie shoot. I'm still a bit sore, that the director didn't spring from his little canvas and wood directing chair and exclaim, ""You there! You! With those sparkling eyes and that winning smile. I want you to be the star in my picture!""

In fact this was the second location shoot we passed in Brooklyn, and I am still, as of this moment, not a movie star. 

I can't understand it. I haven't had even one limo stop me as I stroll down the street, the opaque window lowering to reveal an impeccably dressed man, his body somewhat rotund with years of luxury, pointing at me with his imported Cuban cigar, and offering me a once-in-a-lifetime motion picture deal uttering such things as, ""kid"" and ""name in lights"". 

It's possible that I am simply far too good looking, too well dressed that all of these high powered movie types simply believe I am already a movie star. They recognize the undeniable stride of a leading man, and instruct their drivers to carry on.

Maybe I'm being unrealistic. Maybe I should remind myself that I've only been in this town a couple of weeks, and that I am already being watched by many movers and shakers in the movie biz. It's quite possible that any day now I'll receive a phone call with cryptic instructions to meet at a secret location. I'll wind up an a very upscale office, and on the desk before me will be a series of photographs - very flattering photographs - of yours truly! The man behind said desk will say, ""we've been watching you for some time now Mr. Molloy. And we like what we see"".

That should all be happening very soon, so If you don't hear from me after this - ever again - you'll know that I have a new life, and before you know it, you'll be watching a trailer for a new summer blockbuster staring some chiseled faced heartthrob named, ""Brock Huntingston"" but you'll know who Brock really is. 

See you at the premier!"

<blockquote>If you want to get closer to the cutting edge of robotics, so to speak, you're better off looking at a technology that's already well-commercialized: robotic lawn mowers. Today's New York Times salutes a new product, the Kyodo LawnBott LB3500, which mows your lawn by itself. Here's the manufacturer's description:

   <cite> It operates automatically, and autonomously by means of its intelligent computer and a perimeter cable. It can move freely within an enclosed area, detecting the faint signal transmitted by the perimeter cable located on the ground, defining the areas to be mowed; it can also work without a perimeter cable as working area is enclosed by a fence or small border at least 4 inches tall. ... [I]t leaves its docking station and starts mowing your yard in a random direction. It will mow in a straight line until it bumps into an obstacle, such as a tree or flower pot, or until it runs over its perimeter cable, then it stops, backs up, turns and takes off again.</cite>

Well, at least it needs a human to recharge its batteries, right?

Wrong. The company explains:

    When the batteries start running low, or at the end of its cutting cycle, the mower will search out the perimeter cable and follow it back to its docking station to recharge. After charging, it heads back out on its own! ... With the new LawnBott, you have One Less Thing to Worry About. 

Well, yes. But you also have one more thing to worry about: Your lawnmower running amok while you're at the office. No human hassle means no human control.</blockquote>

Strangely enough, I still want a Roomba more than you can imagine. Mainly because I want to name it, and attach a gruesome halloween mask to it. What would be cooler than a little Freddie Kruger head trundling about the apartment?"

It's a lot of effort for a small package, and the exasperation all over the driver's face let me know so much. 

Who cares?! I got my brand new <a href=""http://www.jfold.com"">J. Fold</a> ""magic wallet""! 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3164/2468954257_b34da26e80.jpg"" alt="""" />

More about my switch from a bulky, back pocket wallet, to this slim and sexy dealie, and what makes it so magic, after the jump.

<lj-cut><img align=""left"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2255/2469776526_c37a0ecc59.jpg"" style=""width: 258px; height: 193px;"" alt="""" />









On your left is my old wallet, a big ol' <a href=""http://www.paulfrank.com/"">Paul Frank</a>, that I've used for the past few years now. In addition to being held together primarily with duct tape, secreting an oily film, and being offensive to seniors who  fought against communism in past, foreign wars - it's bulky. Way too bulky for a short, assless, skinny guy. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3180/2468954565_b721688cfd.jpg"" alt="""" />

The thing that makes this so ""magic"", are the little elastic straps that are set up like a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob%27s_ladder_%28toy%29"">jacob's ladder</a>. You simply place the money in the open wallet, close it, open it again and voila! your cash is securely strapped in place. 

<img width=""400"" height=""300"" align=""left"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/2468954423_c9153f3c38.jpg"" alt="""" />

Not only is it easy to throw your cash in your wallet quickly, it's easy to keep it organized, and draw out one bill at a time. 

One of the main reasons I got this wallet, was for riding the subway. Not only can I keep this securely fit in my front pocket -free from the wandering fingers of pick-pocketers- but it makes grabbing my MetroCard a cinch. It also makes it less likely that it's going to bounce around in my suit jacket pocket, ultimately wandering away to MetroCard Island (where cards with money still on them live out the rest of their days in despair) 

As far as embracing the idea that my wallet is not a filing cabinet, it's surprisingly freeing. I really don't need six dozen business cards, pictures, crumpled phone numbers that belong to someone I don't recall ever meeting, or my expired ACLU card. 

I carry a man bag anyway, so I can simply use an Altoids tin, or a small ""accordion style"" pouch for receipts and other miscellanea.

"event","I'm lucky to have a girlfriend who loves Law &amp; Order as much as I do. 

She's more into the SVU, and I'm all about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_McCoy"">Jack McCoy</a>, but it's all around pretty rad. 

I spent the weekend watching both in the glorious city of Worcester, Massachusetts. 

To get to Worcester, I had to to take a bus. <a href=""http://www.concordcoachlines.com/concord_trailways.htm"">Concord Trailways</a> to be specific, and as any New England bus-rider knows, it's the Cadillac of bus services.  My coach was  no exception, for as I was waiting in the cool sea breeze at the Rockland Ferry Terminal, up pulled <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">the bus from the future!</span> I checked. The flux capacitor was in perfect working condition, and I was in for an interstate journey of wonder and magic!

The first thing I noticed on this future bus - the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Busulator 8000</span> - was the fact that this astonishing marvel of engineering came equipped with not just TV screens, but <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">large, flatscreen, plasma displays!</span> So large, and so numerous were these TV screens, that there was literally <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">no way to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">not  </span>view them!</span> Even looking out the window was merely an exercise in watching <a href=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/entertainment/movies/2008/01/11/dan-in-real-life-89520-20280757/""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Dan In Real Life</span></a> in mirror image. 

That's right. Watching <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Dan In Real Life</span> was unavoidable, because in the future <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ALL MEDIOCRE FAMILY COMEDIES WITH TIRED THEMES ARE MANDATORY! </span>

I know many of you are thinking certain insulting things about me in your head. Words like, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">dumb, idiot, pea-brained</span> or even <span style=""font-style: italic;"">suspected rapist</span>,  are flitting trough your superior minds as you think to yourself, ""Let's get serious <span style=""font-style: italic;"">asshole</span> (another word). Clearly you could have simply shut your eyes and imagined that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Dan In Real Life </span>was really about an alien robot (named <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Dan</span> of course) who through some kooky circumstances becomes the drummer for an Icelandic heavy metal band named REEL LIPHE (the proud Icelandic people are known to be accomplished fishermen), and they all set about to conquer planet earth using lasers, chainsaws, and swords forged in hell from the tears of Satan himself (yes, <a href=""http://family.raining.net/blog/photos/20061104-3_crying.jpg"">Satan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">does</span> cry</a>!)""

Well you would think that, and you would be <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">wrong!</span> Who's the smart guy now, big brain? 

You see this time traveling <span style=""font-style: italic;"">wunder-bus</span> played the audio from the DVD player (a mother fucking <span style=""font-style: italic;"">BLU-RAY</span> player!) <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">right through the bus' PA system!</span> Holy shit! Color me delighted, because even when I played some Scandinavian <a href=""http://www.stereokiller.com/newsreviews/newsimage/VsTheWorld03.jpg"">viking metal</a> at a volume that <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">hurt my eardrums</span> through my iPod, I could <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">still </span>hear <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Dan in Real Life</span> echoing off the walls of my mystical, state of the art, tomorrow bus of misery. 

I have never longed more for the the dingy, grey, hepatitis-coated embraced of a Greyhound's seat. <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span></span></span></span></span>"

"event","Spike is airing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</span> right now. I'm feeling under the weather, it's a Friday night, and I have basic cable. I may as well tune in. <br /><br />I was hoping I would be able to watch this movie with a fresh perspective. The crushing disappointment and resulting outrage since George Lucas first plunged a searing lightsaber in to our collective hearts had subsided. Midi-chlorians aside, the beloved original series remained rather unscathed, and in theory <i>The Phantom Menace</i> has a lot going for it. <br /><br />There are Jedis played by Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Sam -fucking- Jackson. It has that white-knuckle pod racing scene. It's got R2 and 3PO. <br /><br />And of course, there's <i>this</i> guy:<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""More after the jump""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/70427945@N00/2388809522/"" title=""Badass by patmolloy, on Flickr""><img width=""169"" height=""240"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2147/2388809522_d8d8868fb0_m.jpg"" alt=""Badass"" /></a><br /><br />So how does <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Phantom Menace</span> hold up nearly a decade later?<br /><br />Sigh. The old wounds may have healed, but the scars remain. Everything begins well enough. The score, the retro-industrial production design of the droids and ships, and the enormous attention to detail given to the props and costumes make me want to believe so badly that I can enjoy this movie. <br /><br />Then Jar Jar comes flopping into the film, and my blood begins to boil all over again. Jar Jar Binks (even his <span style=""font-style: italic;"">name</span> makes me want to beat up a school child) and his sickening, racist , high-pitched babbling single-handedly ruin this film. <br /><br />Yes, there is plenty else to complain about. The plot is full of holes, and much of the acting (notably Natalie Portman and the little kid who plays Anakin) is rather cringe-worthy. <br /><br />But us sci-fi fans can forgive obvious plot holes, and we've all had to reconcile Mark Hamill's acting long ago (Tashi station? Power converters?). <br /><br />But Jar Jar. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">JAR JAR! </span>Oh how I hate him. <br /><br />This is why I have a proposition for George Lucas. Seeing how Mr. Lucas enjoys tinkering with his old movies so much, how about a completely new voice-over for Jar Jar Binks?<br /><br />Think about it. He is a completely <span style=""font-style: italic;"">digital</span> character anyway. It would be no problem to recast Jar Jar Binks with, well, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">anybody</span>! Instead of the bumbling, inane Jar Jar we've all come to loathe, why not say, Chris Rock? He'd still be high energy and bombastic, but at least he'd have a soul. <br /><br />If you wanted to change the whole tone of the movie, you could cast Christopher Walken or better yet <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Law &amp; Order's</span> Sam Waterson as Jar Jar. <br /><br />Hell, you could cast Glen Danzig, or the singer of a Swedish metal band, and really make Jar Jar kick ass. <br /><br />And of course if you wanted to scare everyone shitless, you could always cast Javier Bardem.<br /><br />For all of its faults, I believe the entire <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Star Wars</span> prequel series could be vastly improved with just a few tweaks to the audio tracks. Re-cast Jar Jar Binks, eliminate all the superfluous, silly battle droid banter, and mute 90% of Natalie Portman's dialog, and you have some halfway watchable movies.</div>ab"

As you can imagine, as in nearly every episode, in every incarnation of the series, there's a lot of this happening:

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2102/2363655353_13326b35a6_o.jpg"" alt="""" />

And this, has <i>always</i> baffled me. Every time there is a space battle, the Enterprise is fired upon, and no matter <i>where</i> the ship is hit, control panels on the bridge just start exploding left and right. 

These control panels are essentially giant iPhones, and although Apple has had problems with <a href=""http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,23361721-5014239,00.html"">exploding products</a> lately, I still don't see why a direct photon torpedo hit to the aft shuttle bay would start a chain reaction so great, that it would cause a control panel to explode with <i>such force</i> that it actually propels an adult male <i>15 feet through the air! </i>

That's like running over a squirrel in an 18 wheeler, and instantly having the steering wheel melt in your hands, and the windshield shatter."

"event","Home is where the heart is. In my case, that heart has been torn, still beating from my chest and slowly lowered into a jar of acid as I - and through some arcane use of black magic, my unborn children from the future - watch in horror and misery. 

After nearly three years of living agreeably in the city of Seattle, I have returned here to mid-coast Maine to stage the next phase of my life. This next phase will take me to Brooklyn, New York, and I couldn't be more overcome with excitement and anticipation. 

The interim however, leaves me here. Jobless, penniless, and without even the simple luxury of being able to take a hot shower. If my father of 79 years can shower twice a week in the manner of a Korean War era soldier, then why can't I man up and do the same? 

Most people have to deal with a generation gap between themselves and their parents. I have the pleasure of trying to overcome two. My father is a generally well meaning if slightly cantankerous man, and despite certain extraneous health factors, is in remarkable shape for someone who is nearly 80 years old. 

Though we have an amiable relationship, it goes without saying that we clash constantly over the slightest minutia. From politics to whether or not a dollop of cranberry sauce equals a full serving of vegetables, we bicker and become exasperated with the other perpetually through the day. 

Thankfully I was able to hook up cable television in my bedroom. This is a new concept for me, this cable TV. I'll try not to appear as one of those holier-than-thou, ""I don't watch TV because I am too busy pouring over The Utne Reader and looking down on those base enough to extract some sort of enjoyment from a flickering box of regurgitated schlock"" people. On the contrary. I'm sort of excited to get better acquainted with this endless sea of regurgitated schlock. I finally found out who Hanna Montana is, and with any luck, I'll figure out what this Tina Tequila person is all about. 

What I really need, urgently, is a job. I need money, and I need it now. I need first, last and deposit for a decent apartment near Prospect Park. I need gas money and bus fare so I can visit my girl in Massachusetts. I need to take this opportunity to pick up the pieces of my life that I have dropped along the way, and more than anything else, I need to find a place where I can take a long, hot shower."

"event","Ok, so I guess I got a little bit of the Cloverfield fever. It's a rather haunting movie, and I couldn't stop thinking about it all day. 

So of course when it came time to do the ""specials"" board at work, this was the result:

Yeah, they tend to try and keep me away from the specials board, as I tend to pollute it with my pathetic geekiness:

This doesn't even have <i>anything</i> to do with eating food. It's not even drawn well!

"event","So I just got home from seeing Cloverfield. Here's my review. 

If you're not familiar with the plot, basically it's about this giant monster. The monster is really sad. There's also this kindly old professor named Burgstrom T. Skittlesworth. Skittlesworth has a pregnant chimpanzee named Choo Choo. Choo Choo gives birth and there are baby monkeys EVERYWHERE! Then they all have a party, and everyone eats bananas. Eeep eeep!!

The <b>real</b> news is that there is a teaser trailer for STAR TREK XI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAY YAY!!!

God, seeing movies alone in the afternoon makes me batshit."

This means I have less than <b>TWO WEEKS LEFT IN SEATTLE</b>. This also means that I have to get rid of <b>all</b> my shit ASAP. 

I'll be posting soon what I am getting rid of, and if you're a friend, it's yours for cheap/free. 

Gah! 

Anyway, we should hang out. It may be our last time to do so in awhile."

"event","Daily Kos has a great, <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/5/15/124912/740"">four part series</a> showing a side of presidential candidate Ron Paul that his fervent supporters may not be aware of. 

Such as excerpts from his self published newsletter <i>The Ron Paul Political Report</i>. This, from a 3,700-word racist tirade written by Paul in 1992:

<p style=""margin-left: 80px;"">Regardless of what the media tell us, most white Americans are not going to believe that they are at fault for what blacks have done to cities across America. The professional blacks may have cowed the elites, but good sense survives at the grass roots.  Many more are going to have difficultly avoiding the belief that <strong>our country is being destroyed by a group of actual and potential terrorists -- and they can be identified by the color of their skin</strong>. This conclusion may not be entirely fair, but it is, for many, entirely unavoidable.</p>  <p style=""margin-left: 80px;"">Indeed, it is shocking to consider the uniformity of opinion among blacks in this country. Opinion polls consistently show that <strong>only about 5% of blacks have sensible political opinions</strong>, i.e. support the free market, individual liberty, and the end of welfare and affirmative action.... Given the inefficiencies of what D.C. laughingly calls the ""criminal justice system,"" <strong>I think we can safely assume that 95% of the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal</strong>.</p>If your stomach can handle it, check out the <a href=""http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/g/ftp.py?people/g/gannon.dan/1992/gannon.0793"">entire article.</a>

Though Ron Paul stated for the first time publicly on the PBS program <span style=""font-style: italic;"">NOW</span> that he does <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">not</span> want money from white supremacist groups, he nevertheless <a href=""http://news.mobile.msn.com/en-us/articles.aspx?afid=1&amp;aid=22331091%20"">has no plans on returning donations from hate mongers. </a>

Aside from his barely concealed racism, here are some more issues that should give progressive/liberal/lefty folk pause: 

(<span style=""font-style: italic;"">again, from <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/6/5/193414/2787"">Daily Kos</a></span>)

Ron Paul:

<div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">is pro-life.
is in the pocket of oil companies and voted to drill in ANWR
supports repealing birthright citizenship
voted against reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act of 1965
supports the Defense Of Marriage Act 
supports prayer in school 
</div>
And on and on. Come lefties! Do you really want to throw your time, energy and money away on this guy?"

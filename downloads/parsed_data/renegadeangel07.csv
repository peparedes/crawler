"event","Hey.

I am so bored.  I am here alone... yea, justin went to St. Louis to play magic again.. I hate that game.  I went to a place called Geekerz last night to play some computer games.  
My ex, Dylan is trying to get back together with him.... i want to, but i dont konw if it is just for old time's sake... i can't imagine not being with justin, and i really care for him and love him.  i dont think i love dylan anymore... he is trying to tell me that i do... but i dont think so.  he has hurt me so much that i am numb to him.
there is also craig, my brother guy... i love him so much (best friend), i just wish i could spend more time with him.  i don't get to be around him a lot.  i wish i could spend more time with justin, too... you'd think i would.
i have to do my homework, and some of justin's... so, i will post again later.

I called him and broke up with him earlier, b/c she is flipping out.  I am sick of him going to MetaGames so much.  (metagames is a gaming store, where he plays magic the gathering.)... I am so pissed rightnow, and i am in such a bad mood.  I just wish I never would have got together with him.  this has become such a hassle, and misery. 

     I am so sick right now, I feel miserable.  My allergies have been horrible, because the pollen count has been WAY up.  If you look at all the cars & the asphalt, there is a yellow film on everything.  it is sickening.  I have taken so much medicine, and i feel even worse than i did when i began.  I hate taking medicine. 

     So, I don't know what to do about justin... i want him to choose... but i dont want to be a bitch... i dont know, it hurts me to even think about all of this.  today has been so horrible... I don't even want to know how tomorrow is gonna be. :(

Ok, since then, I hung out with Jody... a LOT... we got it on... i thought we had something, then he got put in a mental ward.... anyways... Dylan came back from mexico... i wish he wouldn't have.  
i am dating a guy named Justin ""tanne"".  he is a sweetheart... he does nice things for me... the things he is familiar with... like... he put RAM in my computer, he stole my watch, and put a battery in it... (cause it died).  
We are going camping this weekend and i am so excited.
my mom yelled at him the other night when he was over here... i am so surprised that he even still wants to talk to me.  that night, i cried on him so much... and before he left, he turned around and said ""I love you""... I don't know if he meant it... i asked him about it later that night when i called him... and he was like "" i hoped you didnt catch that, it was out of habit.... i say it to my mom and all""... sooo... i dunno if he really meant it, or if  he really said it on accident.
when we are together, he always wants to cuddle, or to touch me somehow, and he always plays with my hands... and he looks at me... with this look.... you know the look.
he will always look me in the eye too.... its kinda crazy. 
well, i am gonna get off here and call him.

Tara is finally gonna be down, to stay.  she is gettin scared & nervous... and her friend KC is over here right now... she is trying to cheer both of us up... i am still depressed about Markie.... I REALLY REALLY liked him... it all sucks so bad... i need a boy... i don't think that i am THAT repulsive. am i?
i don't like the person that i am right now, because i am not pleasing to others and that just bothers me. 
Tara is the bestest... she is skinny, pretty, and everyone loves her personality.
me... well, i am chunky, and i would like to think that i am somewhat pretty, maybe...and well, everyone used to love my personality... i dunno what happene though.  i got dull... annoying... something.. im not fun to be with anymore.  I choose country music and classic rock over rap and hip hop, i choose jeopardy and the history channel over cartoons, and i choose not to show off skin.  what is happeneing to me? i am an old lady... i have stopped drinking and smoking pot and all the shit every damn one of my friends does.  
i dunno what my fucking problem is...
oh well... all i want right now is to feel loved and to feel wanted... i feel like tara doesnt want me around right now, either... i understand. i wouldnt want me around either.

Wes told me that Markie is possibly dating a chick named Reba, even though he usually doesn't date... that crushed my world... so now i am so lonely and depressed...  
i can't even get a boyfriend, but tara has two!!! and she could get any guy in the world that she wanted...
i really need someone to just hold me, maybe play with my hair, kiss me, make me smile, you know... i need to feel wanted, and loved...
i dont really know if that will happen anytime soon, however. 
sure, i guess there are guys online, but they aren't here... and well... the guys here... HAHA... you make me laugh, very funny... 
i just feel like the outgoing person i used to be is gone... i can't be funny anymore... it just doesnt work, and when i laugh, tara said it sounds fake... it feels that way too... it feels forced...
i dunno what to do.

I talked to Tara, and she is finally moving down here in a few weeks... i am gonna stay with her up there (St. Louis) next week... FUN!!! hehehe! I'm gonna help her pack. she misses wes so much... and honestly, so do i.. but not for the same reasons... there is nothing better than hanging out at Wes's with him & Tara & just doing nothing & being bored & miserable together!!! 

Yea... I'm still really lonely... I just want a hug, or to cuddle up with someone, hell, even Tara.  I love her so much, she is like my sister, she means the world to me.  I really want to cuddle up with Markie like we did last Saturday... but as I mentioned, well, i really can't... and besides, he's at his mom's right now.  Anyways... yea...

Dylan is still in Mexico.. i don't even know why I still talk about him... he will be there for a LONG time.
Jesse is stalking me....
I haven't talked to Wes, prolly won't til this weekend...
And i can't decide if i like thomas or not... .grrr...

They are like all over each other, but Wes wont go out with Tara, because she is 14, and he is about to turn 18 in like 3 months.  He is one of the greatest guys I have ever met, and they make eac other sooo happy.  I wish they would just get together.  Which then, I like Wes's cousin, Mark... but he doesn't want to ""settle down""... i don't want to get married or anything, i just want to know that he isn't fucking another chick right after me.  you know?  is that too much to ask? sheesh...

You do have some regret for the horrible things you've done, but won't let it interefere with your life.  You respect your opponents, and you generally believe in fair game.</font></font><p><b><a href=http://www.greatestjournal.com/quiz.bml?Q=183><font color=""FFCC00"">Kill Bill:  Which Deadly Viper Assassin Are You?

"event","ok, so I knew my best friend got sent to Mexico, right...  well, turns out he is in a Religious School/Camp thing in guadalajara.  I am so scared of what he is going to be like when he gets back, they are gonna brain wash him and shit.  I miss him so much.  I love him so much that it kills me not knowing if he is ok.  I love HIM, his mind, his soul... if they rip that away from him, if they change him, omg, i can't even imagine not having him around.  it has been torture thus far... even though it has only been a month... almost two.
no one understands.  and the little bitches that are so much ""in love"" with him, they could care less if he died..  they dont even know he is gone... they dont care.
i do... but no one cares..... oh well

I think that Marching Band should count as a P.E. credit... it is so gay! we have to have 2.5 PE credits! ick!
today we marched a mile & yesterday we marched 2... geez... then today i had to run another mile in PE itself. GRR

I found a lot of cool journals on here, and some cool sites.  Thank you to all the people that sent me links.
ok, so in my life, Mcdonalds didn't call... i dont really have a job, nor a chance.
there is nothing on the TV.
i am bored.
I met a really cool guy last night & i was really getting along with him, and he was even cute!  then, he told me he was bi.... nuff said, huh?
I have early band tomorrow, at like 7 AM... icky... i dont wanna get up that early!
I am going to Flordia in like a week.  I can't wait.
I really wish something good would come on tv.
my boyfried now, well, he kinda bugs the shit outta me, and I don't really know what to do.  I wanna break up with him, and there are even some other people that will go out with me... but, he is like all in love & clingy & he is so unstable.  I dont want to hurt him, let alone crush him.  
He used to be so depressed and negative, and now, he has a job & a girl, so he is happy & positive.  He is even more confident.  I really wish that I could do something.  I am miserable.  I am glad that I made him happy, but I just can't take it.  What do i do?"

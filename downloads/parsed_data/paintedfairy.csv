And why do we have so few useful words for it (ah yes, I remember, because we view weather as an inconvenience (usually) and distance ourselves from it. But for those of us engaging with it today, wow! Squeaky balls of shining white; hard, slippery jaggedy slices; floppy slush; shards of grey.... I feel priviledged to be sitting in the warm and dry watching nature in its glory. And as for the variations in the light today....:0)"

"event","Friday evening M and I went wassailing at Scotswood Gardens, a community project in Newcastle. I was interested to learn a little, my understanding being that one of the three wassailing customs involves encouraging apple trees to produce a good harvest by watering the ""tree of trees"" with cider, hanging cakes in its branches, walking thrice clockwise and thrice widdershins (t'other way) banging drums, saucepans etc and shouting ""wassail"" (be well) ""drink hail"" (ale) to deter any unwanted spirits in the coming year. 

M and I arrived with saucepans and wooden spoons (I broke mine with over-enthusiastic banging!), and were delighted to find around 20 others of all ages already there, many adorned with leaves and face-painting :0) One of those enthusiastic wassailers was a friend from choir who has decided to investigate yurt-living...

We also spent time enjoying the local countryside today with a cross-country run around Allen Banks, a National Trust managed woodland just West of Hexham which once belonged to a private estate. It was muddy, warm, and the sky was bright. We enjoyed maples, elms, holly, pines, pheasants, enthusiastic dogs (just a little muddier than ourselves).

Wassail!"

"event","Life has been a bit hurried of late, and Im away I'm still ""digesting"" many happy and positive experiences, which I may expand on in the future.

Following Bicon, i spent a week on work experience working with a neurological rehabilitation team, and an elderly support team. I learnt much about these areas and the needs of the people supported by them, and they are areas I would consider working in when I graduate (not that the career situation is positive right at the moment). 

I have then spent a lovely week in the Lakes playing with an orchestra which included spending some special time with <lj user=""earwigmc""> *smiles and drifts a bit*

In addition to music making, (I was brave enough to do some solo horn playing and it went well, hooray!) I enjoyed many different interactions with a broad range of friends old and new, and developing several acquiantanceships into friendship. I am getting much better at telling people that I appreciate knowing them, and the clarity of that communication really seems to be working...

And now, I head to Durham Summer School to sing for a week....."

"event","I have just spent a weekend at Minsteracres, a monastery set in beautiful woodlands (avenues of giant seqouia trees) close to Hexham, Northumberland. (Hexhamshire, technically, for those who care..) It was a residential weekend with a local choir I have tenous connections with. We sung and sung. Gospels, barbershop, plainsong etc etc.

The days were broken up by sectionals with professional choir trainers based at the SAGE (Newcastle's new music hall, have  I mentioned it??) and I enjoyed their input, enthusiasm and great voices. Last night we sat around with wine, nibbles, guitars and an accordian in addition to our songbooks. We were treated to ""acts"" from amongst the more confident members of the group, including some excellent renditions of Geordie folksongs. We were all hoarse by bedtime. 

The weekend included a song writing workshop where some creative spirits produced some inspired songs, and stretched the already wide variety of music a little further by including punk music about August sausages (?). As always I enjoyed making music with enthusastic others. The choir is open to all regardless of ability but the frustrations of the ensemble perpetually slowing down and the intonation going flat were counterbalanced by the sheer fun of it all.

I increasingly enjoy singing, and hope to seek out a way of joining this merry band on a more regular basis. My Brahm's Requiem in German continues to challenge me, but for sheer enjoyment, this weekend cannot be beaten."

And at New Year M, Dad and I enjoyed a party in which we knew only the host and his partner but had made several new friends by the end of the evening. It was a crowd of people I had herad of through mutual friends, yet never met, so I enjoyed closing the loop."

I have been doing lots of horn playing. Faures requiem was lovely in December, and as I was bought a metronome for christmas, I have been doing lots of practising studies!! Its ""ball-breaking"" work, but feels surprisingly good when I am getting slowly but (with metronome at my hand) perceptably faster and more fluent. Yay! Last night was first rehearsal back at (Monday night) orch and my horn, also known as Huffy, sounded gorgeous. And I don;t mean my playing did, I mean the horn did. I remembered exactly why I wanted to buy her. When she sounds good, its like velvet. When she doesnt the blame is all mine

And I have been playing tenor recorder in recorder trios/quartets with friends. I find playing the recorder a challenge because there are so many more notes than when playing the horn! I love the sound of the tenor recorder. Almost bass flute like, without all the holding horizontally and arms aching-ness!

And last Sunday I went to a sing in a choir for the first time in about 10 years! I sing alto, so find carol singing very frustrating, much as I like (most) carols.. but it was great to sing as a group again (Brahms Requiem) and I was reassured by my ability to sight-sing okay. Not brilliant, but passable."

As always I have questioned why people send empty cards and then been pleased to receive them, especially the ones containing news of peoples lives. And have considered writing a reflective ""2004"" roundup letter myself, having enjoyed several I have been sent.

I have played in some lovely concerts and others which were pure sentimentality overload, but made all important money for charity. And I am looking forward to a tradional (ish) Christmas with M,  Dad and our friends in the village where I spent many years and that was Mum's home before it was Dad's.

It frustrates me how so many people seem to view Christmas as a challenge to overcome, or as a burden that must be born. I'm sure for many people, the loneliness/financial stress that the pressures of Christmas can cause are a true sorrow. For most though, it is ourselves, helped along by the media admittedly, that fall into the trap of making Christmas something that has to be survived.

For me it is about warmth. Being with family and friends and recognising and being thankful for what is good in our lives. Stopping and reflecting for once. I feel I have much to be thankful for."

"event","It has been mentioned recently that I don;t post very much, and this started me thinking about why I have a live journal. I initially got an account after Bicon 2003, when I discovered that new friends I made there used LJ as one of their main communication channels. It then occured to me that I could use an ""anonymous account"" i.e. one not directly connected to my name, to pursue interests I wasn't yet ready to share with the world, and make contacts with others with similar interests.  And I still do, and enjoy LJ like that. So that was the receptive side of LJ

In terms of being expressive, I have generally focused on dialogue stimulated by and with other people rather than initiated by me. When I do post an entry about what I've been up to, I tend to wonder who would be interested and I guess, why. So previously I have tended to use LJ as a sounding board for more philosophical thoughts. I'm talking to me really, but in a stage whisper I guess. I like to work out how I feel, where I stand by using words, always have and always will.

And now I am aware that my constant theorising generally doesnt happen around the time I am sitting in front of a PC with time to spare. So I often ponder what to write about my life (see above). I tend to take there being no comments on what I have written as indicative that either no one has been reading it, (so why write it...) or people are thinking ""well, so what"" and therefore am reluctant to write details things that just clutter people's friends pages. But I do know that I regularly read entries that I dont comment on, but do respond to with a smile, a grimace whatever, but don;t tell the writer that cos I 'm not sure theyd be interested in opening up their comments to find just ""smile"" or whatever. I would, but would they?


But then... the comment has been made that I havent written much recently, and I do have a friend in the US who might one day get an account, and then we could use this as an additional communication over the pond.

Ho Hum. Just thinking aloud here really. Dont feel you need to jump in and say ""I read every entry"" or "" I like reading"" (though you can if you want ;0) ) Just musing and planning. LJ is a funny form of communication where you never know your audience, or how they are responding. Pretty unique really.

Happy contemplative Monday morning to you all."

I woke up feeling more hopeful than I have of late. Mainly due to a good nights sleep (last night with hotwater bottle at my feet and hot chocolate in my belly) and many delicious dreams about swimming (so, sexy) and this time not alone in the water....

and before I slept I had read a long and relaxing, if slightly surreal vampire story aloud, and had spent the evening chatting with bosker, eating yummy food, and reading ""The Bottoming Book"". More about that elsewhere probably.

and during the afternoon before the evening I had spent the afternoon beginning to build bridges back to a friendship that I thought was lost.

So this morning I feel renewed energy, from a lightening/more positive emotion and a physically tough day at the gym. And I feel more confident about my ability to be who I need to/want to be profesionally. I enjoy my course, I love learning, and I like the fact I put myself under pressure to perform at my best, but sometimes I take it to extremes.

""deaf signers (they followed) showed left-hemispheric specialisation for language, just as (like) right-handed oral-language users. It might be expected that if the right hemisphere (normally attributed with spatial processing), was intact, signing would not be impaired. In fact, left-hemisphere damage has the potential to disrupt the use of space to convey syntactic information"".

Well, I thought it was interesting anyway....."

"event","Today I had two short but fulfilling conversations with strangers. In one, I was being asked for help by a guy trying to find his way around the metro system. Unusually for me, it was a logistical question I felt confident in asking, and the guy, who didnt speak much english and had never used the metro before was clearly relieved to get some patient help.

And then I was the one lost (what;s new...) and a friendly chap asked me if he could help, and did indeed manage to get me to my destination. He was evidently as pleased to be able to help as I was pleased to be helped, and it felt like we both went on our way cheered by the encounter.

My destination was the wonderful health/whole food shop (and vegan/vegetarian cafe/take-away) Almonds and raisins. I had had its location described to me many times, but never quite made it. And they had a great range of foods etc. They did not have the Faith in Nature soap I was seeking, but kindly offered to get even a single bar in for me given 48 hours notice. The woman was clearly bemused by how impressed I was with this offer, but I have seldom encountered such keenness to please/flexibility/efficiency in ordering through shops.

yay for nice people."

"event","Yesterday I, along with many (37?) thousand others, completed the 13.1 miles from Newcastle to South Shields that is the Great North Run. 

The atmosphere was tremendous with so many local people all along the route cheering us on, and the participants enjoying the experience. We were accompanied by many fluffy characters: bungle and zippy, scooby doo, big elephants, minnie and mickey mouse.

I was at the back with the motley crew of furry and/or less ""fit"" participants. Having aborted my training plan so many times during the summer, I thought the most sensible option was to aim at fast walking with the odd spot of jogging as I felt able. This plan worked well. The first 9 miles felt like a nice long, brisk walk, in nice weather, albeit in lots of company, spectators and along dual carriageway. After 9 miles, my hips began to hurt and the blisters appeared. And I started to really respect how far 13 miles really is.

I will always be impressed by the fitness and stamina of those who actually jog/run the whole distance, but I wonder just how different their feeling about the event will be from mine. Classmates who achieved sub 2 hour results (very good even for a team runner) were bothered by the sheer congestion of so many participants and it led me to wonder whether the race is an event that has become too competitive, or one that has been ""dumbed/slowed down""  by the participation of elephants, unfit folk and sheer numbers of people. It is indeed strange to think I was part of the same line up as the guys who came in under 50 minutes!!! (my time? 3hours 10)

It is hard to describe how much a part of life in Newcastle the Great North Run is, which is one reason why I took part. The other reason being to raise funds for the North East Trust for Aphasia, which I have indeed done. I am left wondering, as ofetn I am ""what;s it all about"" though. And can it successfully be different things to different people? Every year it gets bigger, so I guess only time will tell. For now, I'm proud of what I and my friends have achieved."

"event","Its a bit over-busy here. I am now into term full time, and realising how much time clinic is going to take aside from timetabled hours. I don;t mind - thats what I'm here for, but its just fitting it all in and not getting too stressed about being busy, and trying to build in some relaxation time too.

My normal routine is to find a way I can do it all, then squeeze more in on the top... like right now I'm planning on swimming 3 times a week and I'm not sure it wont be a bit much. Exercise always gives me more energy, but its counterproductive when I have to rush around so that I can fit it in, then stress about not having time to myself.

At the moment it looks like :
Monday: lectures 0900 - 1700, 2 hr lunchbreak (swim?). Orchestra 1900 - 2130

Tuesday: lectures 0900 - 1700( inclusing clinic) 1 hr lunchbreak. Orch 1830 - 2100 (I think...maybe, if I passed audition...)

Weds ""day off"" - prob swim. 

Thurs: lectures 0900 - 1700, 1 hr lunchbreak, BSL 1900 - 2100

Fri: ""day off"" - prob swim.

Looking at it like that, its not too bad. Just very different to last year when I was in all week, but had time between lectures to do stuff. This year its a famine or a feast. Ho hum, would I have it any other way?

As usual, having to run now. Til the next 5 mins..."

First a long trip to Out of this World, a great healthfood/ethical supermarket, where we stocked up on beans, pulses, nuts, teabags, toiletries, licorice... etc etc. Then a similarly long trip to a supermarket to buy many carrots, oranges etc for lots of juicing. (Tried kiwi and white grape that evening. Yum yum)

So <lj user=""bosker""> and I have been in the kitchen. Making walnut buckwheat bread, chickpea and spices soup, white bean and garlic soup, ginger biscuits, chestnut ""sausage"" rolls. And for later in the week, many treats including celeriac on watercress...

Food is much on my mind at the moment. I find my taste buds much changed, no longer drinking as much tea, drinking very little cow's milk, finding eggs too rich and being less keen on creamy cheeses. And being able to drink as much fruit/veg juice as the machine can muster. And I now have a huge selection of herb teas... 

I eat generally more healthily now, even eating breakfast (shock horror) and am gradually increasing liquid intake, realising the root of many headaches, tirednesses and minor annoyances may be dehydration. 

Amusingly, on the subject of health, the hospital have written to me to say I dont have sufficient Hepatitus B immunity despite my course of vacs. Seems my body has fought the disease a bit too hard... Less amusingly, they have written to remind me I am still hiding form having a smear test. Next week maybe. I look forward to the entertainment of working out how to answer their sexual health questions ;0)

And we've been clearing out books to take to Amnesty as we have so many books collecting dust and no room for new ones.. (<lj user=""scousecat""> I'll bring the Geisha book down to <lj user=""earwigmc""> 's house in a couple of weeks. Hopefully will bring a smile whilst you re-couperate...

It feels like back to school weather, and indeed it is that. There are lots of small people in new uniforms looking neat and chattering away excitedly, and the sun is shining. (ooh, an almost cluckyness happened then - quoshed quickly)

Stool is finished (except for having one leg a bit short..) and the house stinks of linseed oil. Which is apparently highly flammable, and known to spontaneously combust) so all materials soaked and tucked into the bin outside.. Who'd have thought woodworking could be so dangerous. I've lost count of the number of injuries I've sustained making the thing. But it has a use: it is just the right height for sitting on for horn practice, which I will be doing much of, as concert season will be soon upon us...

The garden fences are half painted (forget me not blue - so pretty, it looks like the garden's either in the sky or the sea), the hall is almost painted, but I need to trek out into town for more paint to complete (primrose yellow). I have a stack of photos from Thailand that I intend to arrange artistically in an album. We have 3 bookcases that we have decided to ""rationalise"", and take our excess to the Amnesty bookshop. I have to sand and wax a stool I made (by hand!!!)...

The list goes on... I also want to catch up with a few friends before term starts proper. Orchestra began back last night (some fab music) so that group of friends have been re-connected with, but I want to get my head into Uni mode too.

Meanwhile I'm still putting in mini-shifts (5 hours) at the hospital, and learning all the time. And I've found a BSL stage 1 course localy on a night I can make it. HOORAY!!!

I am learning many practical skills, but more importantly, I am getting the opportunity to observe many experienced clinicians at all ""grades"" interacting with patients.

"event","from all my travels. Spent an enjoyable few days (in two chunks) with <lj user=""earwigmc"">, including watching Shrek 2 at last! and as always talking, discussing, exploring. And in between, found myself in Thailand. Had a fantastic time in Asia - eating local food, trekking in the hills, meeting local people, riding elephants, shopping in night markets, bamboo rafting, learning how to cook, being entertained by young musicians, learning about history and culture.

Thailand is so much more colourful and vibrant than places I've been in Europe. I was thinking about the differences today under a grey sky in the old village/town where I live and it stuck me how muted England is. Its partly the colours - dark reds of brick, greys of concrete, off-white of the sky. And partly the people. I tried so many times to get someone to smile back at me whilst I was walking, and instead got grimaces or suspicious looks. And as for trad English food in comparison, well what is traditional english food? Nobody seems to eat it any more, which says it all really. Thailand struck me as a young country with energy. Everywhere there is a bombardment of smells, of colours, of detail. And everywhere are warm smiles and open hands. England feels more like a restrained, if dignified, old gentleman. 

So the culture shock is working the wrong way for me. Life in Thailand, at least as a tourist experiences it, is so laid back, so easy, so much fun. England seems so much more earnest.

All the same, its good to be back around the people I know and love, which is ultimately what counts."

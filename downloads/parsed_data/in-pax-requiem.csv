as an agnostic atheist, I personally don&#39;t remove myself from the
spiritual or the metaphysical, or from faith. I guess my biggest point
of contention is the Judeo-Christian concept of God, even in its most
basic (read: most removed from biblical texts) and distilled form. It
seems a very human construct, and it seems that most of the universe is
unquestionably alien to the human condition. I have my own beliefs on
topics that typically fall under the scope of religion, which differ
wildly from most established religions. More than anything, I think
science fiction has helped to shape these ideas for me.</span><br id="".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment10151502236764063_25891760}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[1]"" />

I think I am much less of a rationalist, I will agree with Chris in one
respect, in that I feel that the idea of a God can be an
inquiry-stifling thing. More than &quot;the sciences&quot;, I ascribe to Science
as a skeptical mental and philosophical mode of life. Constantly
questioning, developing new explanations, testing them, doubting them,
pitting them against new ones. Even with the things I have faith in, I
try and be open to new, better, more concise, or better-supported ideas.
To me, faith is based on our instinctual reaction to things we can&#39;t
(or at least, don&#39;t currently) know. Even without a theistic mindset,
there are things that resound within me as true, even without proof or
the ability to prove. And there is a profound awe-inspiring beauty to
me in things that seem beyond our knowledge or comprehension.</span><br id="".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment10151502236764063_25891760}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[4]"" />

this sounds like a spiritual view, and I would agree that it is. But
back to the original point, I see no need for a God in any strict or
loose sense to validate it. There are so many more clever and elegant
answers. And to say, how can you answer questions &quot;the sciences&quot; could
never provide evidence for, is to miss the point.&quot;</span></span></span></p><p></p><p><span data-ft=""{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}""><span class=""UFICommentBody""><span>PART TWO:</span></span></span></p><p></p><p><span data-ft=""{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}""><span class=""UFICommentBody""><span>&quot;</span></span></span><span data-ft=""{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"" id="".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment10151502236764063_25892007}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2]""><span class=""UFICommentBody"" id="".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment10151502236764063_25892007}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0""><span id="".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment10151502236764063_25892007}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[0]"">I
am more prone to believe quantum physics than the Bible, mostly because
quantum physics has withstood closer scrutiny. Besides it being
predicated on a solid foundation of a few hundred years of previous
scientific research, it has been extensively tested and revised. Shit,
one of the uncertainty principles reduces elegantly to the formula for
the diffraction of light, a phenomenon which has been observed and
described for a long time now. It&#39;s a well-tested theory that concisely
explains observed phenomena. Conversely, I would argue that the Bible
is a single point of data, and is not just untested but has provoked a
long history of suppressing those who question it. And even conceding
that God did speak to man back in the day, and further that Jesus was
real and the son of God, what evidence do we have that the Bible
provides an accurate account of their stories and decrees? It&#39;s been
shown that there are different versions of the Bible, some books were
included or excluded due to human discretion, some parts lost, etc. And
I can&#39;t think of too many compelling ways in which it explains observed
phenomena. From a purely epistemological standpoint, I have trouble
buying into it.</span><br id="".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment10151502236764063_25892007}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[1]"" />

be clear I&#39;m not trying to bash religious texts of any sort, but I
choose to believe things according to metrics of justification that make
sense to me. And I believe many of these metrics are common to most
humans in some form or another. Your friend claims he can fly? You
look at precedent: you have a lot of evidence to suggest no human has
ever been capable of doing so. You evaluate the evidence at hand: right
now, it&#39;s just his word. You try and verify: can he show you now? You
consult others to help verify: has anyone else seen this guy fly? You
think of alternative explanations for the evidence: perhaps he is lying
to you, as a joke, to impress you, etc. Which hypothesis seems more
likely? Put in formal terms like this it may seem like an unnatural
response, but when confronted with scenarios like this I believe this is
how our brains handle it behind the scenes. I don&#39;t particularly care
which side of the a/theist argument you agree with, I think the
important part is having critical reasons for it.&quot;</span></span></span></p>"

There is only   one thing for it then &mdash; to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is   the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by,   never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you.

"event","Childhood is a tease.&nbsp; All the things you take for granted, all the stuff that is given to you, all the money your parents spend feeding you and grooming you and entertaining you and indulging you and fulfilling you.&nbsp; To be raised in such an environment, I think that was what made the transition to the &quot;real world&quot; the hardest.&nbsp; Year after year there was a growing feeling that things were harder than they used to be, that you got less for free, that the world was slowly getting worse for you."

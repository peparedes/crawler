I was in first period honors choir that morning, I remember leaving for school that morning, Smells like teen spirit was the last video i saw on tv before i left...I had washed my car the evening before...so it was very clean..i remember that I wore a white Hilfiger dress shirt and khakis....We didnt know what happened until second period and i remember that megan gregory was walking with me in the hall and was talking about some stupid shit with some dude of hers and i really didnt care, walked into Mrs Wood's geometry in the ""old new building"" and i walked in and we watched the second plane hit as it happened....the rest of the day was spent in an attempt to hide that we were all watching it on tv because by 4th period the school leadership said we couldnt.....In 6th period we actually had someone on watch near the door to make sure no one made us turn it off......

When I left i went with my sister to clarksville to have dinner....They were selling Extra editions of hte newspaper in the medians of the street, i still have mine....rough day.....the days to follow were cnn on every single channel...because of this, the Keanu Reeves movie that came out that weekend was a number one hit because it was something that was not terrorist related. The months to come actually made me a republican for like 15 minutes.......and the terrorists won.......However that faded, and i think the gargantuan sense of patriotism has faded somewhat as well. The country hates our current leader and the world hates the united states more than ever...so....has anything really changed?????

The event was my pal Mike's birthday....he is leaving for Iraq tuesday and his birthday is 9/11 so he will be gone for it...wow...it must suck to have your birthday on 9/11......Anyways, about 15 of us went to the Mulligans pub in nashville for irish food and a table-banging good time....it was fine...followed by a few hours at Decades...Nashville Tennessee's best dance club rocking only the hits of the 80's and 90s......Afterwhich most of the party...all but 5 of us went back to the Sheraton. The rest of us went looking for trouble in Printers Alley.

Printers Alley, for those of you who might not know, its a bedlam, a Babylon of Nashville of sorts. Every vice you could possibly desire is located in this 200 foot long alleyway in downtown nashville. We walked in as we have many times however this time, I saw the sign of glory...Brass Stables Gentlemens club....and it was ....glorious..

So several hours later, i stumbled out a broken ....horny man.......

Next time i will take alot of single bills....


I got a new laptop..thats always fun.....

So, had a good weekend. Got to work saturday and decided, Fuck this, And I walked out. I decided I deserved a day off... So, I went and bought a bunch of stuff for my party..decorations etc, and some clothes because...i wanted to.....Then I went home...painted ...got some of that parental-bonding stuff out of the way for the week. It was nice,
Got cleaned up, headed out for a night on the town....that town being....Clarksville. 

Went to the blackhorse with Adam, katie, chad, Heather, some dude she knew and some chick she knew, Brooke, Dave, and Tony...It was a good night. While we were in the blachorse there was a big ruckus however, as ty pennington and all his extreme makeover people went walking by as they were leaving. Eh..ive met my share of celebrities in my time..however, I really dont think those guys are that big of a deal...

ANYWAYS,

     I think i may have drank a little much, as i had to crash at adam and tonys apartment last night as I have so many nights before. Wish I lived closer to town..would make drinking and getting home so much easier. I had so much barnstormer red ale and pizza...it was beautiful.... Anyways, we went to the Deli and back up to the tap room. Spent some time with John Winters, perhaps the only 30 year old musician who is actually any good in clarksville. He is probably the best in clarksville right now besdies for Ben Wilson. 

Anyways, when we were at the Deli, we went upstairs to the keg party....I saw so many M. Central people..it was wierd...and too loud and within the hour we were back at the Tap Room. 

So, Good night was had by all. 

Sending out the call again. Party - JULY 16TH...6.P.M. is when the bbq will hit the grill....the pool is cool..the limbo will be rockin........lots of good food, beer, booze, good friends and good times.....

Its wierd, this time last year, I hated both beer and wine. Now, I have at least 1 beer every other day and I have a bottle of Pino in the crisper now....Oddities 

Have to go back about the passport tomorrow afternoon. I dont see why they make getting a passport so hard....


watching Silence of the Lambs.....that was one fucked up movie...""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Khianti. "" .............eww......


I am checkin out. of course, I can check out any time I like...but I can NEVER leave....

A little girl was talking to her teacher about whales. The teacher 
said it was physically impossible for a whale to swallow a human 
because even though it was a very large mammal its throat was very 
small. The little girl stated that Jonah was swallowed by a whale. 

Irritated, the teacher reiterated that a whale could not swallow a 
human; it was physically impossible. 

The little girl said, ""When I get to heaven I will ask Jonah ."" 

The teacher asked, "" What if Jonah went to hell?"" 

The little girl replied, ""Then you ask him""

"event","Well, Thought I had updated again a week ago, as i see now, that never went rhrough...SOOOOO here goes again. 

LAST WEEK, I went to this party on Greenwood at this dude named Myrons house. Everyone was pretty much there...It was a crazy night. HOWEVER, i had already been to Jazz on the Lawn for the last 3 hours and had drunk a bottle of Riesling and  A bottle of Golden Rose so I was already kickin it. Then Tony, Adams roomate, gave me some hooch he had made which was comprised of Hawaiian punch and Everclear. However, I did not know what was in it....it was good...soo good that i kept drinking till i drank nearly a gallon...For a few hours..I was on top of the world and ended up making out with this chick named theresa who was actually named heather but she eventually got into my drunkeness....By the end of the night however, I was in the parking lot back at adams apartment throwing my guts up...the only time I have ever been sick from being drunk....


BY THE WAY, THE HOOCH WILL BE AT MY PARTY THIS COMING SATURDAY - JULY 16TH.....


SO, this saturday, I went to another party...also on Greenwood. Who would have known but also, everyone else, again was there, but this time the dude from Survivor - Ryan - was there...and also later on Viva La Bam..thats right, apparently he had been in nashville shooting some stuff for a future show and was getting mobbed everywhere he went so he knew a guy in clarksville who happeend to be at the party so he came on down .....it was an oddity but really, not a big deal and no one hassled him or gave him issues, and there were like 150 people there....good times by all...

the hot chick from the week before, theresa, well, i found out this week that she has a boyfriend...who goes to west point...and talking to her sober was extremely hard to do cause she doenst have the sense God gave a goose. .....but ashley was there...and i think i want to pursue that.....


SO.....Even though they bombed the hell out of london last week...I am still going ..I dont care.....FUCK THE TERRORISTS AND PASS ME SOME AIRLINE PEANUTS!!!!!!AND A SPOT OF TEA WITH A CRUMPET!!!!!!

And in accordance, My party..again..this coming saturday...will be a great time...You all really need to get down there...Twill be loads of fun and also there will be prizes for the ladies in both the limbo and also the mud wrestling contests ---Southern Secrets Gift Certificates....i think you all could use them.......

Im out of here...you all have a fine evening and a pleasant tomorrow.

So, after i bought everything but sandals and i had lunch with jefferson and had to witness both a person getting extremely sick on the Dippin Dots machine,  and also a fight in the food court i went home.....well i stopped by mothers store then went home........I dont know why i am itemizing things today.......

ANYWAYS, 

I had had plans to go with people to Jazz on the Lawn...and i did......now, i always wear nice clothes to jazz on the lawn.......well we were all there ....like 20 of us........and we were having wine...cheese...and these crackers that didnt seem to go with anything that well...............had been for about 2 hours....haiving a great time...when all of a sudden....we had a Nohas Ark scenarioand it ruined it..by the time i got into my car i was totally soaked..my new clothes covered ...and i fell in mud twice before i got to my car...but it was comforting that when i fell at least 10 fell behind me.......goddamned flip flops

But anyways....

I went with Adam, Katie, Ebey, and Donny to see Farenheit 9/11 at green hills last night. ...........There was some fucked up shit in that movie.......Not as good as Bowling for Columbine......but still great....raises alot of shit up for bush..not the thing he would want in an election year..the images of the war....that are in that movie...Not the Iraqi people pulling down statues....its the whole other spectrum of it....the things we are doing over there..truly horrible.......It shows them dragging burned soldiers through the streets.......but almost....who cannot understand...i dont condone their actions...but if someone came into Tennessee.....which i think is bigger than Iraq...and tried to fuck with us like that...there would probably be similar hell to pay........
The worst was a mama reading a letter her son, a soldier had sent to her ....that she got right before he was killed.....The War department CALLED HER ON THE PHONE....to tell her her son....only son was dead......I thought the chaplain and all had to do that in person....Welcome to the 21st century.........

I tell yall...its some fucked up shit....alot of it is just that Michael moore bluntly hatesd Bush....which is cool...but there is alot more besides that that will appeal to the common sense and realistic point of view......Yall need to see it...Lord knows none of the theatres around here would have the balls to play it so you gotta go all the way to Nashville.....whose theatres are better honestly...to see it......................................................................


Im ok......leaving for vacation in a few weeks.........things are ok...........well, im gonna go and do.....something........

"event","Leave it to Robin Williams to come up with the
perfect plan. What we need now is for our UN
Ambassador to stand up and repeat this message.
Robin Williams' plan...(Hard to argue with this
logic!)

I see a lot of people yelling for peace, but I have
not heard of a plan for peace. So, here's my plan:

The US will apologize to the world for our
""interference"" in the affairs of other countries,
past &present. You know, Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo,
Noriega, Milosovich and the rest of those 'good ole
boys.' We will never ""interfere"" again.

We will withdraw our troops from all over the world,
starting with Germany, South Korea and the
Philippines. They don't want us there anyway. We
would station troops at our borders and allow no one
to sneak through holes in the fence.

We will allow all illegal aliens 90 days to get
their affairs together and leave this country and
will give them a free trip home. After 90 days the
remainder will be gathered up and deported
immediately, regardless of who or where they are.
I'm sure France would welcome them.

All future visitors will be thoroughly checked and
limited to 90 days, unless given a special permit.
No one from a terrorist nation would be allowed in.
If you don't like it there, change it yourself and
don't hide here. Asylum would never be available to
anyone. We don't need any more cab drivers or 7-11
cashiers.

No ""students"" over age 21. The older ones are the
bombers. If they don't attend classes, they get a
""D"" and it's back home, baby.

Energy wise, the US will make a strong effort to
become self-sufficient. This will include developing
non-polluting sources of energy but will require a
temporary drilling of oil in the Alaskan wilderness.
The caribou will have to cope for a while.

Offer Saudi Arabia and other oil producing countries
$10 a barrel for their oil. If they don't like it,
we go some place else. They can go somewhere else to
sell their production. (About a week of the wells
filling up the storage sites would be enough.)

If there is a famine or other natural catastrophe in
the world, we will not ""interfere."" They can pray to
Allah or whomever, for seeds, rain, cement, or
whatever they need. Besides, most of what we give
them is stolen or given to the army. The people who
need it most get little or nothing.

Ship the UN Headquarters to an isolated island some
place. We don't need the spies and fair weather
friends here. Besides, the building would make a
good homeless shelter or lockup for illegal aliens.

All Americans must go to charm and beauty school.
That way, no one can call us ""Ugly Americans"" any
longer.

The Language we speak is ENGLISH.....learn it...or LEAVE...

Now, ain't that a winner of a plan.

""The Statue of Liberty is no longer saying 'Give me
your poor, your tired, your huddled masses."" She's
got a baseball bat and she's yelling, 'You want a
piece of me?'"" -"

I would have to select an entire album...and that would be Coldplay's ""A Rush of Blood to the Head""...it is ...just.....it is just so damned good..thers not a flaw on it.

"event","So...i have started this entry like 3 times...and i have been having my computer doing Illegal Operations.....so...if this bitch does it again...i will just have to say fuck it ......

S..2003 is but a memory....and what a memory...2003 was ...without a doubt...the shittiest year on memory......

Let us hope more for 2004.....

so..year in review...

started out best ever.....

then this happened.....

<img src=""http://www.digitalstar.com/Brothamantn2002/images/271012.JPG"" alt=""TheDeathtrap"" /> 

but we all heard enoughabout that and god knows i could care less if i ever ever ever ever ever think of it again...so....

however....i do have to notate the3months of constant pain, dzzyness and insomnia.....

then i gt my tight ass ride.....and back to work....

bcame a trainer i guess  thats ok......

Had tw breakups in the year...of course before you have a breakup you have a hookup...and usually that seems to average out....

got a new stepfather...i guess thats ok.....

managed over my homebound period to aquire more than 40 dvd;s.....and i feel that should be something i remember.....

Saw the country go to a war that i dont know the reason for.....

and most importantly saw every episode of RENO 911  than 50 times each......

Now, i know that more important things happened.....

but i feel that that had to be noted...

Had a nice new years....went out withKatie and Adam to the party they had at Front Page....howver....most of it was in the tap room upstairs......... the first dance we had of the new year...was playd to ""Lets Get It On"" downstairs howeverwas a shitty band called ""Free Rock""....and we all had to play to hear them.....and they blew....

left font page around 200.....and went to the party and mike and Big Tonys......i managed to stroll in alittleafter 8 this morning and so on that i know i have started 2004 on a great note...."

"event","Happy Thanksgiving to one and all...it is about to be ""Black Friday""...busiest shopping day of the year...where some of us get to be lucky enough to work and hock cell phones....la de da........

Anyways, gonna fill in the gaps on the past like...month..or so since i updated...it was more like 10 days....

Rebecca and i are still...great...i guess...she is just finally starting to warm up to me...i dont know what took so long.....She offered to come up out of a cake for me on my birthday...and when i told her i was taking her out monday evening she ...never mind.....

Um...but we are doing cool..Sarah told me i should get her ""Fatal Attraction"" as one of her christmas gifts to just....well...piss her off....

So, wednesday night.......I got highly pissed off at work as did my entire class and i left at 8 after our potluck.......Which was most likely the best one ever. ...and left with Scott and Mira and went to Amandas house to chill for awhile...had a great time....i ddint get crunked or anything like that since i had family coming in from atlanta of whom i had never met......so i knew that i did not need to be even slightly hung over on Thanksgiving.....

So...after amandas we went to Don;s house and he is all cool ...but there were some dicks there and they were getting on my nerves, so mira asks me if i wanna go, i say, id like to..cause my car was still at convergys so i had to go when they did...and she wanted to go...but she was with scott...and um...she kinda...pushed me to leave..i assumed she would want scott to go to...but she insisted he didnt...and then i felt like shit cause she plans to stay with him only like..one more week...and he loves her so much..and ...she is just cruel..i tried to talk some sense to her...but..no doing....which dont get me wrong, she has lots of good points, one being his...never mind, but i mean, still....if a guy sits outside of your window at night, brings you roses, knocks on your window and all you say is ""Why did you wake me up..."" i told her i would have burned her house down....thats just me....

But, when i left..i went...and did.....most likely the most stupid thing i had ever done and i was insanely embarassed and so mad i was like wanting to duck and cover........But, i digress...cause i am NOT gonna tell yall what i did cause everone else would think it was funny...Sarah is the only one who knows and if someone else finds out i will know whose dog will be wearing concrete shoes tomorrow........:) :) :) :)....

SECRET ASIAN MAN!!!!!!

Thanksgiving rocked turkey and jive ....just so yall know.....

It was groovy.....rebecca should have called me back by now..she said it would only be a min. ah well....

im gonna go and buy like 50 of those 30.00 dvd players tomorrow..i mean..thats a rocking groovy deal....

im gonna be at walmart in a few hours...like....5.....and ive yet to sleep.....

im gonna be dragging....

they are playing the unedited version of the South Park movie on tv....its bitchin.....

Kennys Mom -""Fine, then when you go and miss church and you die and go to Hell you can live    with Satan!!!""   
Kenny -""Mmmmkay""

Kyles moms a bitch, shes a big fat bitch, shes the biggest bitch in the whole wide world...

Its like...19 days till i tun twenty-teen. 

Megan called me and left me a voicemail...i really dont have the time or the intrest in dealing with her...Im tired of her playing wth me and now that im involved, i dont think she will be so interested....or maybe al the more...wo do know her characteristics......

School is great...my grades rock....things are good....if only i didnt work....

Speaking of which..even though i probably should do this...

Candice, her first night on the floor, she well..started weeping and freaked...and quit.......Just so yall know........

Well...in gonna go and make a call and try to get SOME sleep...

Gobble Yall..its now officially the Xmas Rush...

****NOTE, I learned Wednesday that Xmas isnt actually an abbreviation..it ...""X"" Means ""Christ"" in greek...so its still Christmas.......so boo Kevin Kennedy and his massive billboards all over town....which are kinda a staple of the Clarksville Christmas tradition...i cant wait till they turn the lights on...:)...

Great lovin time......


Well..Night yall.

NAME ANALYSIS

Brief summary of your name

Your name of CHRIS gives you a very happy-go-lucky, spontaneous nature. You see the humorous side of many situations and can laugh at yourself as well as at others. This name gives you a musical, artistic nature and you would do well in any occupation in the entertainment field. You have many friends because of your generous, happy nature, but if crossed you have a quick temper, although your annoyance does not last too long. You do enjoy an argument and will at times say things just to get others going and then you sit back and enjoy the debate. You lack system and order and find it very difficult to budget and save money."

ANYWAYS,

Do yall know about rebecca...well if you dont..now you do....she is my newest lady friend....she was in a class i taught a few weeks ago and scott and mira set her up with me at patricks party 2 weeks ago..we were drtinkging so it was easy....but it is more now....She and i are pretty ...pretty close and i think its cool...i have two problems..she is a little ditzy..but she knows thisl....and she smokes....but only like 1 or 2 times a day...so i mean...we all have faults.....i drink too much.....i never sleep and i dont eat right.........we went out last night and it was a really nice time...

But then i was watching ""Fatal Attraction"" tonight.....and well.....yall know about that movie...Glenn Close, Michael Douglas.....He has a really long one night stand with her and she gets pregnant...and she becomes obsessed and over like a week everything goes all wierd.....

""Im not going to be...ignored Peter...."" - Glenn Close, 

Anyways, it just reminded me how PSYCHO yall ladies can be..and i told her and she was all..yeah...i think i would be like that too.....

My costume - Elvis- was the hit of course..it was wonderful...with my gold silk scarves and sequins and all...it was great.......I went to class and work still but left work early, our boy Ty at work who takes care of scheduling errors dressed as ""Connie Lingus""  ...... really goth type chick with breasts and all...he won our costume contest. my costime was great...hard to sit in....VERY HARD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM IN...i had to take the whole thing off if i did for there were no openings in it....So around 3 in the morning...it had to go.....

I got extremely....drunk...or so i was told....No, i remember alot ...some....of it...I tell yall..im a sight to see....Some drunks are mean drunks, Some are emotional....Im a fun drunk..everythings a party and ive got the lampshade on my head.....Only downside is im very loud.  It wasa a rocking good time....lots of people...and i liked most of em...One dude from high school...he left early to go steal a car...no one knows why he was there or who he came with..but he left to go steal a car..Rick Royal...if you remember him...he was one of the ""extras""  some of yall know what im talking about....and someone else bought all the smirnoff and skyy and c. royal and parrot bay and it was a rocking good time..Fun was had by all...

And i went to work the next day...jsut fine....i never have a hangover...
People were throwing up within an hour...i was beside them yelling....
""Can i get you another drink?>??!?!?!?!?!?!""...

They said no...

I dropped bio...fuck it...i wanna keep a good gpa..ill just take astronomy with candice next semester...

Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on

Stacy, can i come over after school? (after school)
We can hang around by the pool (hng by the pool)
Did your mom get back from her business trip? (business trip)
Is she there, or is she trying to give me the slip? (give me the slip)

You know, I'm not the little boy that I used to be
I'm all grown up now, baby can't you see

Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
She's all I want and I;ve waited for so long
Stacy, can't you see you're just not the girl for me

Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn? (mowed your lawn)
Your mom came out with just a towel on (towel on)
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared
And the way she said, ""You missed a spot over there""

And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
But since your dad walked out, your mom could use a guy like me

Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
She's all I want, and I've waited so long
Stacy, can't you see you're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong,
but I'm in love with Stacy's mom

"event","Horrible subject line isnt it.......but true...

The reason will come to yall..

So saturday night i went bowling @ the Pinnacle with patrick and sarah and one of her friends and keith and kendra......and well...it was diffrent..my first set i got like a 130..the next i didnt brreak 90........we were drinking smirnoff from the bar and they werent carding us.....we did like...3 games and left....I LOST NO MONEY..THATS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE..Some of yall remember those many times.

We decided that since it was halloween, it was time to get scared...well it was already like nearly midnight so it was too late to go to nashville or anything...so we decided to go to the statues and then to ghost bridge......
Everyone knows about the statues and they frankly dont creep me out too much..a little but not too much....But ghost bridge i had only heard about....and id did suffice to creep me out...

So ok..we took off out of the pinnacle and it is like 10 minbutes off of Tiny Town rd......well......2 hours later when we see the signs showing we are in Trenton...we kinda got the idea...wait..were not in tennessee anymore....and we werenet...we stopped at a gasstation to revel in the pure spirit of Kentucky and ....to take a leak...I bought a keychain I (HEART) KENTUCKY......hence the subject line.....

We then went to ghost brdge the correct way...
Ok..so heres the lowdown....
Ghost bridge, at one time...was where they used to hold KKK rallys and such and they used to hang lots of people off of it when they had their lynchings....mainly cause it used to have higher water and if they didnt choke or break their necks in the noose they would drown...
The legend is....is that if you park your car at the end of the bridge and go into neutral with your lights off...your car will be pusded back...OVER a steep hill in the middle of the bridge and then to the other side...and then your car will stop automatically at the bridge end.....They say if you put baby powder or something like it on the front of your car you can see the handprints of your car being pusded.......

We ddnt have any powder...but we did have a car and since we werenyt in mine and i wasnt driving i was fine...So..we got to the end...skeptic me...Nothing will happen even though i admitted i was spooked...we sat there for a minute...another minute ...another minute...all of a sudden..a groan from underneath...and our starts moving about 5 or so mph....back over the bridge.. OVER the big hill in the middle and down the other side...then...stopped a\t the end........

at that time i managed to shit myself and we came back to patricks house....

H was showing us his inventions and such..he is about ot graduate from ITT in december and he has lots of those techie gadgets...like the air ram he built and the little camera robot thingie...very neat.

Fnalyl around 4 i managed to get home...and i had a day today but im too tired to mention it....I will later if i care too...well..night yall....dont get spooked......

"event","""Our Secret Song""   aka...""Come What May""
Never knew I could feel like this
Like I've never seen the sky before
I want to vanish inside your kiss
Every day I love more and more
Suddenly the world seems
Such a perfect place
Suddenly it moves with
Such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life
Doesn't seem such a waste
It all revolves around you
And there's no mountain too high
No river too wide
Sing out this song
I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather
And stars may collide
But I love you until
The end of time
Come what may
Come what may
I will love you
Until my dying day"

"event","*in her ultimate happy mode* Kitteh-dono and I were talking last night and she was telling me that she was almost finished with the first part of my birthday present. I was totally clueless as to what this was, but excited too. I love surprises! As long as they're not bad, that is. And this surprise was definitely not bad. X3

The amazing Kitteh-dono composed a song for me.

I would like to mention that after hearing this, and the song, I was squeeing happily, and would be now too except for the fact that my throat is kinda sore. Kitteh-donooooooooooo~!!! Sankyuuuuuu~!!! *glompglompglomp*

In other less exciting news, because few things could top the above, I am starting to create different personalities for all of mon pets on Neopets. I have 9 accounts, and only one of them doesn't have 4 pets, although that might be changing soon. Also, on one account I am about to let a pet go and adopt a different one. The one I have now is at fairly high stats, so she'll get adopted ASAP. But I never felt any sort of connection to her, so I want to get a different pet. Besides, Nothenius would probably like another adopted pet to play with. ^_^

I figure that making personalities for all my pets would be good practice for me, since I have a lot of difficulty making personalities for my own characters. I can always modify these later, so why not test my capabilities?

I figure that I can buy it with my second month's paycheck, on the terms that I work 20 hours a week on minimum wage. I'm planning on spending my first month's paycheck on some more clothes and of course put some away for college. And who knows, I might end up getting more than minimum wage.

It doesn't look like I'll be working at Waldenbooks, or rather, Borders. I checked online, and they aren't hiring.

I think that I'm going to try and get a part-time job even if I don't graduate when I hope to. Or maybe if I give myself time to study for the rest of the month, I can pass at the beginning of October. All of the computer troubles have really set me back in my studying. >_< Please, please, please let this computer be able to handle my math program!!! And let my memory work! I think it'll work for this important time. o_o

I really don't want to start a job until I pass, but I'm starting to feel somewhat desperate for money. v_v I need to get my debt paid off before it becomes huge, I have tons of manga calling to me, there's that PS2, which I'll want games for, and of course, there's college.

"event","*squees* First off, YAY!!! I got my first birthday present today from my friend Theo from the guild I'm in on Neopets. X3 Gift-art!!! Lovely gift-art at that. My first time getting one too! *excited easily*

Here's a link:

http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/22756977/

*continues to squee happily*

Gotta see the new eps of Magical DoReMi, Mew Mew, and Winx this morning. Ooh, that reminds me, I hafta enter that contest. *makes a note to herself to do that after she updates* It'd be cool to win, but I doubt I will, considering the whole one grand prize, millions of entries thing. ^_^; Though I did win a contest once, and I still need to sell that Pokemon Fire Red game... But anyway, this contest would be much nicer to win, because then I could get my PS2 and DMC 1 and 3. <3

I liked DoReMi, even though it does seem to be aimed at a younger audience. Meh, who cares? I like some childish things. X3 I also like Lorelei (Loreley?) a lot, and she reminds me of another character I've seen somewhere but for the life of me I can't figure out who...

Mew Mew seemed to be a bit lagging to me. Perhaps it's cause I've read almost all the manga now, and these type of fillers don't seem exciting. ._.; Also, that Archie Andrews/Mako Tsunami voice annoys me to no end. And I can't remember the English name of that character now. o_o; Stupid memory...

Winx was pretty good. I gagged a lot, due to the lovey-dovey crap. Oh, and the fact that they RUINED Darkar in my opinion. Is it just me, or is his voice also Ussop's voice? I'll have to check that out.

I'm so incredibly excited about Xiaolin Showdown next week. X3 Proof that KidsWB can still air something good. I had a second TV airing Xiaolin Showdown during Winx, because my copy of that ep is temporarily lost. >_<; And also because it's just a good episode in my opinion.

My computer has begun having problems once more. Mozilla isn't working for me. This is incredibly unfortunate due to the fact that on IE, while I'm on Neopets, Flash wants to be installed once or twice per page. Unfortunately, it freezes up everytime it tries to install Flash. A world of ARGH.

Hopefully my computer will be back up and running before my birthday. I'd hate to not be able to spend some time with my friends on that day. I'll be gone for most of the afternoon though, so don't expect any chatting then. ^_^;

I think I'll be going to the DMV on Monday to get my ID. Not my driver's license, because I fear my driving skills. I once drove this small electronic car thing at K-Mart, and I ended up crashing several times. Not what I had hoped for.

Anyway, I just have to double check that I need both my birth certificate and my Social Security card, due to the fact that we seemed to have misplaced the latter. -_-;"

Now for the bad news.

Our TV died. >_< We have a couple others, but smaller. Mine doesn't get stations that well, basically only PBS, Fox, and UPN. We have one out in the living room that works better, but still tiny. But we shall make due with what we have. And seeing as how I'll hopefully be getting a job within a month (scary!), I'll buy us a new one. *determined* Just have to pass that GED test that's coming up soon. *terrified*

God, I can't believe I'm going to be 16 next week. O_O It seems so odd. I still feel like this little kid who's just starting school. Which wasn't that great of an experience, seeing as how I ran from the room. I was only 5. *shifty eyes* And there were only boys in there. I was a sissy. So what. =P

It feels nice to be online again, even with the crappy program known as IE. It doesn't like Neopets because it can't get Flash installed for some reason. Freezes up every time I try to get it installed. But as soon as I get Mozilla back, I'll be happy again.

I can't believe that Winx is having its season premiere next week! Although I won't be happy for a couple months, when Helia shows up. But maybe they'll have some images of him, and of that Black Phoenix, in the opening. That'd be nice.

XS premieres in two weeks, and it looks like it'll be pretty good, from the commercials I've seen. Chase Young using the Sword of the Storm! Yay! That'll be neat. Alhtough I'm not sure if I like the fact that Chase, who says he's so strong that he doesn't need Shen Gong Wu and has proven that time and time again, is now using this Shen Gong Wu. It's cool to me, but still...does this mean that he'll be losing his powers? I don't want him to. ;_;

I've been starting on a new manga idea. I still want to do that web comic though, Kitteh-dono! Anyway, it's going slowly. I have to do some research on stuff before I start plans for it. And they won't be that great of plans either, seeing as how I still have tons to learn. But this is a fun thing for me, a relaxing thing. So I'm happy. -^_^-

I hope everyone's doing well. I haven't checked my Friends page in a couple weeks, and I don't know when I'll be able to. I've barely gotten any computer time in, so I'm trying to feed my addictions right now. So perhaps the next time I'm on this thing, which will probably end up being tomorrow, I'll check on it. I'm lazy. ^_^; And I still need to check the communities I'm in.

Speaking of communities, I'm thinking of leaving the solely Xiaolin Showdown one that I'm in. I don't go there, like ever. I'm a nervous freak, so I basically have no social contact, even online, except with my friends who have somehow shined their way into my heart and soul. How did you guys do that? *tilts head*"

To be fair though, it was cloudy and kind of nice out when we first started. But then the sky cleared. x_x

I've determined that I have a love-hate relationship with summer. I love it because you can lose more weight when exercising. You work out and, because it's so hot out, you sweat more. Good thing. Bad thing about it is the fact that when you aren't working out, it's still hot.

I swear, I am moving somewhere cold one day. Or at least a place with fairly decent temperatures. Maybe Maine...? Although I'd really hate to move that far away... Perhaps somewhere else on the west coast. I must remember to ask Kitteh about the weather in Washington...

I'm a very nostalgic person. Heck, my room screams nostalgic. Everything has meaning and memories. And I'm also a packrat.

Anyway.

I deleted some of my accounts that I had forgotten that I had. It was an odd experience. Now I'm down to 8 accounts, and don't look at me like that.

Next on my to-do list: move the different accounts onto e-mail addresses that I still have. I only have three e-mail addresses now, unlike the dozen I had before. This gives me either an allowed total of 12 or 15 accounts on Neopets, I can't remember.

Therefore, if my guild ever starts another project that has me creating a character with a Neopet, but one that I don't have, I can just create another account. Nooo problem.

The only problem I currently have, besides summer, is that I still can't access my second hardrive. Crap. But I'm getting a new video card sometime, so I'm feeling a little better.

I'm also feeling better because of the fact that I will hopefully be buying a PS2 with my mostly own money around Christmas time. I figured it all out:

I get an average of $50 for my birthday and another $50 for Christmas from my grandparents. They don't know me well so they just give me money. I am so incredibly happy about that fact.

I also get two $25 Target giftcards for my birthday and Christmas from family friends of ours. They adore me for some unknown reason.

So therefore, that's $150. I can also see if my dad will cover the remaining cost, as he wants one too. A world of YAY."

I hope the 4th is a lot cooler than this. I'm going out with some friends of my family to see the fireworks. Last year, we went downtown to see the display, but it sucked, so I'm hoping for a lot more this year. I'm also hoping we don't park too close. Last year we did, and I ending up getting sick from the smoke. x_x

I'm kind of nervous about going out with my friends. I haven't actually seen them in about a year, and I don't know how they've been doing.

Just think, though, about the employee discounts!!! I could buy schoolbooks CHEAPER!!! I could get manga CHEAPER!!! I could get books on my beloved mythology CHEAPER!!! I could get that pretty wall scroll of Sesshoumaru-sama CHEAPER!!! I could get Shonen Jump CHEAPER!!!

I'd also be IN THE MALL. I'd have easy access to Waldens for my books, Suncoast for my DVDs, Penney's for my clothes, and any future eye appointments! Let's just hope that I don't get the same doctor as last time. I think he was leering at me. o_______o And he was about 55. *hides* Why couldn't I have gotten a nice, normal doctor?

Anyway, I'd also be near Macy's, which is wear I got a killer deal once. I hope to get a deal like that again. *nod nod* I got a dress that was originally about $40 for *$12*. Is that a good deal or what? And the dress was gorgeous! I don't wear it anymore because I don't wear dresses and it'd be classified as a mini now, but just think of the future good deals!!!

Plus, I think I've finally gotten as tall as I will ever get, so I can wear these clothes forever!

If I ever get any taller, can someone kill me? LOL I'm about 5'11"" now, so I REALLY don't want to get any taller. It'd be horrible!!!"

So basically:
Me: Teenie Gangsta Wannabe, which makes me wonder what the heck that is...
Kitteh: Punk Band Geek, which makes you wonder if she's punk or loves punk bands...
Roku: Goth Teacher's Pet, which makes you think is he goth or is the teacher...
Eppie: Weird Emo Loner Kid, which I take as an insult...
Seiyaryu: Rich Metalhead Prep, which just leaves me confuzzled...

BUT I HAD FUN!!!

And the teachers, Nancy and Russ, said that I can come back. The message touched me greatly, and with my social issues, this class seems like a bit of heaven. -^_______^-

"event","Okay, realized that I never wrote and told anyone who cares about how everything went. Probably because I myself am greatly confused about my feelings and have self-loathing and memories clouding my vision.

So yeah, can't really tell you.

I think it went well and everyone liked me. I didn't understand why they liked me, cue the self-loathing, but it seemed to go good. I was terrified, but discovered that the adult service is pretty much the same as the one at my old church: long, confusing, and makes my neck hurt.

Interesting thing, I made my hands go numb from clapping during worship. I like worship. It was always my favorite part of service at my old church.

And all that remembering almost made me cry during worship.

I used to go with a friend of mine, before she became an Ice Queen. -_- And I still don't know why, because she wouldn't tell me. She said I knew, but I obviously don't. So XP to you, dude. Though I doubt you'll ever read this...

Yay for confused rambling.

I'm going to the library tomorrow. I'm going to study, and try and get all the information I need from these three books I took out. I found out that they were seven days overdue, but I just renewed them. So hopefully I won't have to pay any late charges.

Also need to remember to make sure dad takes back a movie I took out from Blockbuster. It was due yesterday, but I couldn't of cared less. I was depressed, still am, and I just wanted to die. Or sleep for a very long time. *sigh*

It was a good movie though. 'Peter Pan', the live-action one. I only got it out because I wanted to see Jason Isaacs but it turned out to be a lot better than expected. Might even buy it one day. Who am I kidding, of course I'm going to buy it.

Just as soon as I get that job...

Speaking of that job, which I need to get into shape for, I need to find a new exercise plan. Anyone have any recommendations? I don't want something that makes me feel as bitchy and non-sleepy as my kickboxing, but I still need something that works. Beware, I can't ride a bike, I hate going out in public, and I hate going outside. Challenge! XD

For now, I'm going to stick with weeding and the kickboxing until I find a better program. Weeding is somewhat tiring, and I like to do it only in the early morning because I live in Nevada and it's summer, but it's somewhat fun. When I'm not getting pricked. XP

Well, this has become a lot longer than I expected. Colour me surprised."

Fine, be that way. *pout*

It turns out that this coming visit of my aunt and cousins shall most likely be the last chance to see them ever again. They're moving to Indiana. -___-

So now I have to decide whether or not to go. I guess some people would be yelling at me right now about how it's the last chance, and I'll regret it if I don't go. But wouldn't I feel worse if I found out that I like the little kids and now they'll be gone? It's such a hard decision to make for me.

I hope I don't sound selfish. I don't mean to. But honestly, I have to think a bit about myself at times like these. After what happened to me a couple of years ago, I know that my psyche is very fragile and tender. I don't need any emotionally mind-breaking experiences at this time. I'm about to start on my plans for my future. I have people who I need to look out for and I want to stick around to be there for them.

Times like these, I wish I didn't have any other family besides than my parents."

"event","*paces* I just realized that today is Friday. FRIDAY. That means it's just a few days from Sunday. You don't understand what this means, do you? Well I'll tell you the story.

I'm a Christian, as I think most people know. But ever since my last experience at our old church about three years ago, I haven't been going to church. I was deeply hurt by what happened and somewhat fearful of it happening again.

I made a spur of the moment promise that I would go to my dad's church. This Sunday. The words just tumbled out.

My dad found this church about a year or so ago, and he says that it's really good. Everyone's real nice and asks how I'm doing. I'm just terrified of meeting them though, no matter how nice they are. People can seem nice, but turn out to be horrible. I was treated like some kind of freak by some people, because I prefer to wear black or other dark colours. It's like some form of prejudice. And I don't like feeling like the black sheep of a place where one is supposed to be welcome.

I don't worship the devil, I don't do any freaky rituals, none of the stuff. I just draw and like to talk to people, when they aren't trying to change me. ""Wear a dress"", ""Wear brighter colours"", etc. I like how I dress. It's damn confortable. The only colours I want to add to my wardrobe are hunter green, black, shades of grey, blood red, and navy blue.

I know I'm being somewhat of a bitch, judging these people before I've met them, but I'm terribly defensive. When one gets hurt by something, one becomes nervous about similar experiences.

*sigh* I don't know if I'm going to handle this okay. We're scared. ._."

"event","Finally found something to rant over! And I knew I needed to rant fast since I haven't updated in awhile. XD

X_x; I have newfound respect and admiration for those people out there who can create an OC and not have them be a Mary-Sue or Gary-Stu/Larry-Stu/whatever you call a male Mary-Sue. It is harder than expected, for me at least.

I RPed with my bf once, and did some extremely casual RPing with another friend of mine a couple of times, but have since stopped for fear of making a complete fool of myself.

But now, I have this newfound urge to prove myself. Therefore, I'm trying to create a Pokemon character to RP. I finally figured out what her look is, which took me about 3 days. I'm not used to having to take so long on these sort of things. ._. Makes me feel odd to not be able to think up something off the top of my head.

I figured out one of her Pokemon, and am currently trying to think of a second one. She won't be getting them all at the same time or anything like that, but I want to be prepared.

She's going to be a coordinator, based on the video games, not the always confusing and changing rules of the anime. So I'm trying to determine which Pokemon would be a good Beauty Contest choice, a Smart COntest choice, etc. I only have the Cool Contest one done.

I'm also trying to make sure that she doesn't have any extremely rare Pokemon. The only time I plan on her meeting one is by per accident, as in another RPer having one. After I become more comfortable, I might have her see one, but I don't really plan on it.

I don't want her to have one of the usual starters, because their attacks/looks aren't working for me. Although I may just end up having her start with a Mudkip. I desperately want her to be from Saffron City, Johto though, so I might change that decision.

One day, I want to create an enemy/rival for her as well. I'm still trying to decide on whether or not he'll be part of one of the organizations, another coordinator, or perhaps something else entirely. Maybe someone with one of the same type of Pokemon she has, like her Ampharos. Always trying to see which one was raised better.

I think I'm going to go outside and study for a bit. I need a break from creating. ^________^ And I really need to read that book! This is the second time I've gotten it from the library, and damnit, I'm going to read it this time!

EDIT: It was a very bad idea to go outside to study. While I was sitting under the tree, it became too cold due to the breeze. So I sat under the sun for a while. It then became too hot, because the breeze decided to not blow anymore. I was extremely displeased by the turn of events, and also displeased by my lack of faith in my writing ability, so I came inside. And I'm gonna write however the heck I wanna! XP"

"event","I just found out that it's a definite: my aunt and cousins are coming to visit.

I don't think I'm going to see them though. I have the choice whether or not I want to, and I don't think I'm ready. And one of my cousins has some unfortunate mental problems, and I'm a little scared of her because of it. She can get somewhat violent.

I'm afraid that if I do go and see them at my grandparents' house, I'll break down. Although I know my uncle is dead, it doesn't seem like he is. He was never around before, as he and my aunt and cousins live were located in California. So he's not around, which means that he should be in California, which means that I'll see him when he comes up to visit. But that isn't true, since he's dead.

My grandmother is still very hurt by all of this, and I have no idea how Aunt Susan is handling everything, so I'm afraid that if I break down, they'll break down.

And what about my little cousins? One of them doesn't know his dad, since he was only a couple weeks old when Uncle Bob died, but what about Brianna and Christopher? How are they handling the fact that he's dead? I don't think I'd be able to look at little Christopher without crying. He looks so much like his dad...

*leans back* Another worry is my grandmother being pissed off. The woman needs to lighten up an realize that the world is not going to go to her liking. She can't control everyone.

So I don't think I'm going to go. My choice. If she doesn't like it, who cares. I'm in pain about this too. He was my uncle, after all."

"event","Why must Omi always be the center of attention? I was looking through the future episode titles for the rest of season 2, and it seems that Chase Young's apprentice will be, as I unfortunately suspected, Omi. I wanted  it to be Raimundo, and if not Rai, then someone who WASN'T OMI. *disgusted sigh*

I know it'd be bad writing if Rai turned evil at the end of the season just like last season, but I would've loved it if they had kept him evil for the rest of this season and the next season, at least. He just seemed cooler when he was evil.

Don't get me wrong, he's still cool and one of my two favorite characters, the other being Chase Young. But there was just something special about him when he was evil.

Yes, I'm aware that I'm a weird child. Your point?

*rubs eyes* I think I'm going to get off now. I need to fit a shower and at least 5 hours of sleep in before 9am. I have to take a trip to the library to return most of the 21 books I have out and I need to pick up some holds. I'm finally going to be able to see the entire 1st movie of the LotR trilogy!

And after that the disappointment of having spent all my money settles in and I start cursing things again. -.-; September! Birthday! Why must thou be so far away?!

I made a list of things that I want to get. Some crappily subbed One Piece DVDs, a YGO video game, a Pokemon video game, and a Shaman King video game. Which adds up to about $155. *falls over*

The terrible thing is, I've started wondering if the job that I want to get is actually the right job for me. I know that I don't want to be a cashier, because I always worry, 'What if I mess up and give people the wrong change?' I'd love to just do restocking, but I don't know if that's possible. I also need to think about getting a job somewhere around where I live. Stupid gas prices. >.<

"event","To anyone who cares, sorry that I haven't updated in awhile. I've been busy. Schoolwork, exercise, and some stuff for my guild.

I realized something a little while ago. I don't think that I've ever pushed myself to my limits. If I don't do that, can I truly grow stronger? I work up to things, but I never feel a real rush from it. I really want to feel that rush.

Another thing that's happened is I think I'm beginning to have some troubles with my hands. I know the name of what I think I have, and what my dad thinks I might have too, just don't know how to spell it. I'm looking into finding some exercises to make my hands stronger. I <u>can't</u> have my hands injured. If I'm ever going to be an artist, a paid artist, I have to be able to draw constantly.

I also have to want to draw. I've been feeling really uninspired lately. I think it's because I've realized another thing. Here in the US, I don't think there are many chances for me to do what I want. Anime is only starting to become a big thing. No colleges around here that my dad has checked out for me have any classes centering on anime. The closest one we've found so far is in California.

I used to live in California, but if I lived there now, I might be dead. And not from gangs or other criminals, but from the air. It isn't good for my health. I don't want to die before I reach my dreams.

I'm also terrified of flying, but I might have to overcome that. I mean, there's always the chance of becoming a commercial artist, and that would definitely be a good paying job, but I don't know if they'd want an artist who pretty much only does anime. So perhaps a trip to Japan is in order.

Although if I do become a commercial artist, I could possibly open that anime/manga store someday. Just wouldn't be able to sell manga that were drawn/written by myself. Because I wouldn't have gotten to that level yet.

Writing. *sigh* Another problem. I used to write fan fiction, albeit somewhat crappy fan fiction, but I don't know if I'll be able to write the stories for my manga. I was thinking, 'What if I can team up with someone? Myself as the artist, another as the writer.' I just don't know if anyone wants to pursue that type of career. I couldn't really contribute much to the writing, maybe ideas once in awhile. I'm just not a writer.

Funny thing is, I used to want to be a writer. It was my dream for almost all of my life. I had ideas planned out that seem childish now. But then something happened, I'm not sure what though. Just...BAM! Couldn't find the inspiration to write anymore.

I was in a slump for 2 years. I had no idea what to do with my life. The one person who inspired me to write left me. I felt betrayed, and then I started wondering, 'What am I going to do with my life now?' I didn't want to become one of those people who spends their entire lives working at a job they hate. That would kill me.

Then I got asked to do, what I refer to as, a portrait of my soul. I did it, and it turned out amazing, to myself and others. I started drawing more often, pushing myself a little further each time. That's when I started thinking of becoming an artist.

And that's where I am today. I need to find inspiration in things around me, but as I prefer to stay inside, inspiration isn't often found. I wish that I could have the garden in my dreams to inspire me, but gardening is something associated with my grandmother, and I don't want to ask her for help.

But then, if she found out about my garden, she'd feel betrayed that I didn't come to her, and I don't want to put my parents through that. I'm used to her not liking me or being disappointed with me. I don't really care. But I hate putting my parents through that.

I think that I might try going to a park a couple times. When I'm not busy, of course. Nature is peaceful, if you can find it. Also, the great beauty of it inspires me. But living in Reno, nature is kinda hard to find. This town is well known for its casinos, and that's all I really see. Well, that and death. Depressing.

In my exercising, I haven't been pushed to my limits either. I set a goal for myself and normally complete it. I was set a bit behind by my cold and a swollen ankle, but I'm catching up. My goal doesn't seem that far away. Not with everything that I have to keep me busy.

Schoolwork is going...slowly. I finished writing notes for government, but I still have lots that I need to study, like weather and...math. Always math. *sigh* Unfortunately, due to car troubles, I haven't been able to get to the library. I'll hopefully be going sometime this week, but then I need to find the books I need for studying. It's amazing how hard it is to find the right book in a place with hundreds. For simpler stuff, I might end up trying the children's section.

Getting myself to sit down and concentrate is hard too. Also, with the pain that sometimes appears in my hands, it gets hard to write. I'm trying to get everything written down now and study right before the test, as I worry I'll forget everything if I study now, write notes, study some more, and so forth.

Well, I have stuff to do now. Like exercising for the day, and praying that I might get to the library. Oh yeah, and it's trash day, so I need to bag and drag."

Kinda liked it, kinda didn't. I might try to find the next volume though.

Aqua Knight
XP Two thumbs WAY, WAY down! And I might grab some other people's thumbs to point down too. =/

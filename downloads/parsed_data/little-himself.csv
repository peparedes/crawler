Yesterday was Kare and Nicky's anniversary.

And I NEVER miss an opportunity to wave the ""April 31st"" flag in his face.


Here's to another year that Kare didn't kill Nicky in his sleep, and Nicky didn't strangle Kare with his starched boxers.


Kare really DOES starch his boxers."

<lj-cut text=""Small and Unnoticed"">

One heard many things by being small and unnoticed.  Things like, 'There's no law that says I have to be bottom every time damnit', and 'Did Cuddy finally decide whether or not to have her boobs done?  Because I told her yesterday her nipples were conversing with her navel.'  Very interesting things.  But the ones that interested him the most naturally concerned himself.

 

Things like, 'Where is short-round anyway?  There's a flu vaccine with his name on it' and 'He's four years old for fuck's sake, how long is your mother going to kvetch about not having him circumcised?  We had the bris, just no tiny penis chopping.  We're not going to tie him down now and do it!!'

 

Those tidbits were very interesting.  And they gave him new words to look up.  When he found out just what circumcision entailed, he felt like showing his penis to everyone and telling them that House prevented it from being mutilated in the name of an archaic religious tradition.

 

Being small and unnoticed got him information on Chase's boyfriend which he shared with his father for a quart of chocolate milk and twenty Oreos, information on House's newest hiding place which he sold to Jimmy for a shirt with a pink skull and cross bones on it that said ""Avast me panties!!"" and proof of Lisa's new assistant's sexual orientation gained him a waterslide for the pool in her backyard.

 

It was unfortunate then, what with being small and unnoticed being so lucrative, that he was unable to remain unnoticed without considerable effort and sacrifice.  Otherwise who knows what he may have learned.  And what he may have procured in the wake of such information.

<lj-cut text=""Prompt from Nicky...What exactly were you thinking!!  Were you thinking at all??"">

""What exactly were you thinking? Were you thinking at all?"" Church was pretty certain the principal's voice could be heard well outside the office, but he sat quietly...for a change...just biding his time.

The lecture was furious, and the man was magenta. Really, he was going to stroke out if he wasn't careful. Parents have been called, blah blah blah. Mentally he shrugged. He knew his parents. And he was pretty certain they'd be on the same page he was. Well, House would be for sure. Jimmy was the wild card.

Mr. Henkle (really, what kind of a name was that) had just taken a breath to begin anew when House and Jimmy walked in. There was staring for a few moments as his father assessed the situation, and Jimmy did a few Jimmy-takes. When House sat down, and calmly addressed the principal he was nearly certain the now puce man would pop.

""Why exactly have you called Dr. Wilson and I away from our patients?""

For a change, Jimmy didn't say anything, didn't tell House to shut it, didn't apologise for his husband, nothing. That didn't mean he was fully on their side yet though.

The principal stared at Dad. ""What...I mean...LOOK AT HIM!!""

House turned again to look his son over and then he looked back at the sputtering person who thought he was in control of the situation. ""Looks fine to me. Brat, you do need to learn to accessorize though. A bracelet here, necklace there and maybe if you did something with your hair...but otherwise he looks fine. Jimmy?""

""He's covered, the clothes are well made and tasteful. Where did you get them Church?""

He grinned. ""Dandy."" He'd been over to her house over the weekend for this express purpose. He didn't see the need to inform his parents that Blake dared him to do it, Jillian said he wouldn't have the guts to do it, and that Kaylee paid him ten extra dollars (she got a twenty...TWENTY dollar a week allowance) to wear the underwear too.

But his parents simply nodded and turned back to the principal. The following arguement abuot dress codes and school rules didn't interest him much. He already knew he wasn't in violation. Instead he simply smoothed the pleated skirt with the black and white checked pattern, pulled up a knee sock and amused himself by rocking his foot back and forth in his mary jane. Dandy's feet were a little bigger than his were.

I'm leaving it open, because Nicky will yell at me otherwise."

"event","First of all...let me thank Nicky for my new default icon!!  I am VERY into Bleach right now, and I LOVE Hitsugaya-kun!!!  That's also where I got the idea for my current hair color, though I did put a couple of blue streaks in it.

Second of all...*takes a deep breath* Just made a breakthrough today.  God, I am SO excited abut this!!  Okay.  After church, we came home, and Mama decided she needed some quality time with her dogs, Claudia and Louis.  They were really excited about it too.  She put Evan (since he's their father after all) in charge of the twins, and Evan enlisted Kelly (he's Evan's personal assistant for more than just business, I know I've mentioned him before), and I offered to look after Just.  So Mama took off outside with the dogs, and Just and I stayed in the living room.  He was watching Totoro, and I was messing with my laptop, and keeping an eye on him, because you HAVE to watch Just, you can't just stay in the room with him, but I wasn't really paying attention to him.  After awhile, I'm not sure how long, he came over to me and showed me what he had in his hands.  Mama's combat boots.

So I said, and I was a little puzzled at why he had Mama's boots, ""Yes, those are Mama's boots Just.""  He held them up again, like he brought them down, then back up, showing me again, and I said, yes, those are her boots, still not getting what he was after.  He points at stuff all the time, and he'll bring you a DVD if he wants you to put it in for him (he can't reach), but this was new.  He got a little frustrated and thumped them on the floor, then held them up again, and made that little unh grunting noise he makes when he points at something that he wants, and suddenly it dawned on me.  He wanted MAMA.  She wore her Nike's outside to play with the dogs, and he obviously associates the boots with her, and he missed her and wanted her, and probably wanted to go outside and play with her and the dogs, and he went and found the boots, and made the connection.  This is the FIRST time he's asked for something that he couldn't see or put his hands on.  This is HUGE!!!

So, since I figured out what he wanted, I took him and Gabe outside.  I hadn't noticed Gabe sitting beside Just with his leash in his mouth, and told Mama what he'd done.  She was a little pissed because she really wanted this time with the dogs, but beyond that, she was really really pleased and happy, and it showed.   When Just saw her, he put his arms up, not to be picked up because he doesn't like being picked up, but it's the motion he makes when he sees somebody he likes and recognizes, and hopefully this re-enforced what he did, because he got the message across.  I want Mama.  And he got her.

I cannot TELL you how excited I am about this!!  He has resisted all the kinds of communication help the therepists have offered, sign language, those cards, computers, and it's not really a problem, perse, except as far as training Gabe goes, but that's a seperate problem, and here he goes and makes a connection and figures out how to solve this problem WITHOUT having a screaming fit!!!  He DID get frustrated with me because I didn't understand right away, and I'm usually pretty good at knowing what he wants, but he didn't screech, or throw the boots at me, or spit or bite, and it really didn't take me THAT long to figure it out really.

We are REALLY REALLY excited about this!!!  I called Nicky (he called back finally) and he actually squealed!!!  Evan is bragging to anyone who will listen, Kelly cheered when we told him, and everyone that we've called has been just as excited as we are!!  My entire post is exclimation points, I know, but you can't see my big huge smile or the way I'm just SO happy about this!!

Justin, we're SO PROUD OF YOU!!!


EDIT:  Per Nicky's request, I am unlocking this entry.  Like I said, I want the WORLD to know about this, even if I wouldn't do it my ownself."

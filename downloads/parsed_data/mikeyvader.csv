"event","so alto 45 have called it a day, though only for a year, those little scamps played their farewell show last night and it was an evening for celebration, a couple of friends had birthdays, i gave charlene the shins album and little steve 45 got a nintendo 64 which made him happy, i also gave away the stupid jokey present of signed photos to them both ""to my biggest fan love mikey."" stupid.

the boys were on fire last night, there were mistakes aplenty but they were the right sort of mistakes, noise, joking, jim even looked at his watch whilst singing to check how much time they had left.

they opened with a big old noise jam and then a four click and hey presto they launched straight into hospital song which caused me to grin like a fool, as they played on everyone in the hall was really getting into the show, having a really good time.

towards the end of the set they played the favorites the plan and don't give up giving up, doing a really good job on each, really playing hard, and with a little melodica solo at the of DGUGU they took a bow, and called it a day. but not before coming back on to play a really really (better than we could) cover of evader's clubhouse (slightly re-written to be called sex-club after my sex-club stories from when i was a kid and didn't know what sex was) which just made my day night and morning.

goodbye alto 45, we'll miss you. come back soon. make sure to write.

hey krissy. i like doing this livejournal thing."

"event","well its been a couple of months since i last wrote so..

i guess the biggest news is that evader, they first real band i ever played in has broken up, no bad feelings or anything like that, we were just getting on a bit, c'est la vie, life goes on, tristan is now working full time on grand prix '86, a casiotone orientated splendour, you should check it out, i don't have the link right now though.

giant robot wise, i'm nearly done with the second ep, which will be released as a split with grand prix '86 at some point in hopefully june. howlbackhum and mummy wheres the milkman are releasing a compilation record in may with a couple of tracks by evader and giant robot, oceans apart by evader and pebble by the robot, it will also feature lalia (rob the drummer from evader's new band) and danny's minute. one final one, check out www.mqprojects.co.uk for another compilation featuring the robot and evader plus friends like stuffy and the fuses, magoo and alto 45, entiteled ""npu, treasure party"" its the best comp they've done so far (imho) and well worth a listen, the evader track is maltshake and the giant robot song is getting down.

one final note, abi and i went to iceland in the new year, it was awesome, we rode horses, saw the northern lights, got really drunk really expensively, saw keifer sutherland and got invited to a new years party by a bunch of crazy icelanders, one of which was bjorks cousin, petur. photos will be posted soon.

right. i'm outtie."

"event","so.

after two days, five string breaks, thirty plus beers, one bottle of scotsmac, one single take, eleven dumps in one night and an incredible lack of sleep, the very first giant robot ep is complete, a masterpiece of unreahearsed fun, free to all, and the most proud of something i have ever been in my life.

we caught the bus for the sickroom shortly before half nine in the morning, it had been my birthday the night before so we had only had a few hours sleep each but we were alert, ready for the task at hand, well, we were except for myself who used the opportunity of being on the bus to catch a little shuteye before the hard day ahead.

when we arrived at the sickroom, we set up (slowly) and had a little mess around. we headed to the shops before we did anything to stock up on beer and snacks to get us through the next two days and immediately started on the beer, drinking a few cans each before going anywhere near our instruments.

the recording process went pretty quickly, the basics for most of the songs being recorded in two takes on the first day and the rest of the work being done on the second day, vocals, guitar overdubs etc..

it was pretty nice being in the car on the way home, for all the fun and even though it was for two days only it had felt like we had been away for a long time, we listened to a radio show about the beach boys, glanced out of the windows into the orange night, it felt nice to be going home having done a job well done, back to normality.

good night."

"event","so hello.

i was just sitting around here, just got the internet connected today when it occurred to me that i had this live journal thing i registered to a long time ago. i read through all the old posts and decided i could do much better, so.... i wiped the slate clean so to speak, i'd like to log my life but not that often, all the good stuff comes in small doses, and i don't feel like writing all of the time so this will be to encapsulate all of those moments i don't want to forget (which i guess is what most people use livejournal for.)

tomorrow brings some practice for one of my bands, giant robot, we'll be headed to the sickroom studio in thirteen days time and we're pretty un-rehearsed, my own fault a little, but i seem to have a lot of days off at the moment so taking time to remedy that situation.

my other band, evader, should be playing a show at the arts centre in norwich on the twenty seventy of this month, its going to be a john peel tribute show, he was one of the patrons of the arts centre and a big help to many of the bands around norwich so they all want to contribute to a big shin-dig in his honour.

out."

"event","im vomiting out some sort of angsty rhyme
in hours not meant for people to be awake in
my bed is the dishelved mess that i shed this morning 
or rather this afternoon
i will disembowel my ambition and replace it
with some mechanical urge to repeat the same task
notions of abandonment aside
i shall live vicariously through films with happy endings
i am a movie star,i am in love,i do not break 
i will never run out of ammunition
(because your words are bullets you feed me to fire back)
(and i will shoot shoot shoot them in your ear and let
them ricochet in your head)
the television will offer me love,a perfect body
and happiness, 
can you compete with that?
im still ignorant as to why 
im avoiding sleep like eye contact 
with some candy shop owner
and myself being some boy 
with a guilty conscious"

depressing, over thinking time of night
my mind would be racing but its to tired
and i've got an alarm set to harass me
old 80's rock crackling the lone speaker
""poor some sugar on me""
i will be engulfed in this blackness
some form of dismal night
saturated, baptized, resurrected
a raw infant, fresh and naive

i will scab and scar and see

hold me together
and my heart begins to knock my ribs
as she clutches my shirt,and it all begins
i lose my breathe and myself in the moment
my thoughts are racing and i can't control it
because the simplest things mean the most
like the look in her eyes or having her close
if you read my lips they'll spell out
that this doesn't mean one thing
it means everything
maybe if i don't fall asleep
tonight will never end
maybe then dreams will be real
then real life would be pretend"

a moment of weakness to say the least
my concious has gone numb
left defencless its my defeat
and this headache has become to much
and i'll follow the sunset
to my own detriment
as it gleams down her neck
i'm giving in and i can't belive it
i'm as good as dead
so consider my throat slit
why is it so hard to say no
her skin is so smooth
as are her words too
she was leaning in for a kiss
that's the last i knew
friends don't let friends 
fall for a girl like this"

"event","i'm dying for tomorrow
becuase its the only possible hope 
that i have left
so we'll medicate this mess
and nurse it back to health
get out while you can
and save yourself
but in my defence
i never meant for this
so we'll medicate this mess
and nurse it back to health
because i've been lying on the floor
 for at least one hour
and i'm dying for tomorrow
because its the ony possible hope
that i have left
today has burned me out
and it won't get any better
so breathe in all these words i exhale
you and your truth has become frail
so let  it sink ino your lungs
and flow in  your blood
because i'm dying
i'm dying for tomorrow

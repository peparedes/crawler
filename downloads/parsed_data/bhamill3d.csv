"event","It all started back in 1984. I was 12 years old and the Olympics were coming to my hometown, LA. I didn't know much at all about any of the sports, but the town was in a fervor. It was a very exciting time to live in LA. I just experienced my Los Angeles Raiders win the Super Bowl, and now the Olympics were coming to town. My parents were never into any kind of sports, so this time was a real coming of age time in my sporting life. I just got into football with the Raider win, and now the biggest sports show in the world was in my backyard. I started collecting all kinds of Olympic stuff. I fell in love with diving with Greg Louganis, had a huge crush on Mary Lou and fell in love with gymnastics, Carl Lewis in track, the whole shebang. In fact, I even took gymnastics for a little bit because of it. But I was far too old and uncoordinated to continue for long. I did do track in high school because of Carl Lewis though. And that love has certainly continued on till today.

I love the spirit of competition in the Olympics. That excitement is just incredible. Of course I love to root for the US, but I just love all the underdog stories about the athletes from tiny countries who have no chance at a medal but are just so thrilled to be competing. The opening ceremonies are just awesome, and China just did an incredible job with them. That was truly amazing. And I've already watched some incredible events. Michael Phelps is just an amazing athlete. The relay win last night was one of the best races I've ever seen. Almost ranks up there with the Fiesta Bowl win by the Broncos. The us men's gymnastic team just turned in a great performance when no one thought they had a chance. I can't wait for the rest of the games!!"

"event","Well, I'm just tired. I've gotten to the point where I'm a little tired of doing theater. I've been going for a year straight now, and I really need a break. I'm tired of doing Greater Tuna. I've enjoyed the show, and I enjoy being with the people in it, but I'm just tired of theater at the moment. I will be glad when the show's over and I can concentrate on some other things

I've finally been able to watch some movies. I watched Atonement last night. It was good. I enjoyed it. I'm watching Persepolis right now. It's just awesome. The animation is just incredible. Certainly not in a Disney, Pixar kind of way. If you get a chance, I highly recommend it.

Off to bed. Need to get some sleep. Haven't got much lately."

"event","Here's the video of my demo reel I finished last night at 5am. I had to turn one in to Healthwise for a job I'm applying for there. I've needed to get one done for quite some time, and I'm glad this gave me the impetus to get it done. I really need to get some new stuff done. I'm a little embarrassed by my little animated short. That was my final project for school 6 years ago, and I can't believe how long it took me to do this crappy little animated piece. We're talking a couple of months of work. Embarrassing. I've always liked Riley getting taken by aliens. I don't know if you can see it too well. I shot him on a greenscreen, and that was about the only 10 seconds he was still enough in the 10 minutes of footage. It's not the best reel, but I hope it can serve me well for a while.<br /><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""19""/>"

"event","I had an interesting night tonight. We had the performance of Greater Tuna, which went really well. We had a really good crowd that seemed to enjoy it quite a bit, although everyone shot out of there pretty fast which is usually a sign they didn't like it. But I don't know. Rob and I were pretty on tonight. I did have a couple of bobbles, but nothing anyone would notice so it was good. Katie did forget to get a costume ready for me once so I was a little late coming out once, but I forgive her. She's been doing an awesome job, and I certainly couldn't do the show without her. It's hard to tell with a show like this if people like it. It's been done so many times, and so many people have seen the original guys doing it, that it's hard not to be compared to them. I'm just glad we're doing it before Shakespeare Festival, so I don't have to be compared to the Fool Squad. That's just not fair.

After the show, I really didn't want to go home, so I went downtown to the Reef to listen to a reggae band and have a drink. It was alright. I like the Reef. After a while, this girl came down and sat next to me at the bar. She really was gorgeous, but I didn't say much to her, just hi. I don't ever hit on girls when I go out to bars (which isn't very often). I've never wanted to be that creepy guy hitting on anything that moves. So I usually just sit there and groove to the music. She had some friends there who were celebrating one of the girls birthday. She introduced me to her friends as the guy who was keeping her company. Her friends went off to dance, and me and Dena sat and talked for a while. I told her about the show and such, she told me about herself - she's married, for 11 years, she has a 16 year old son which I never would have guessed in a million years. She doesn't look much older than 16 herself, although she said she was 35. And she's a nurse. It was just a really nice conversation. We danced for a little bit. And then I left. As with all the women I happen to be attracted to, she's completely unattainable. But she was a really sweet person. And really hot, which is a very odd combination. You don't find that hardly at all. We said our goodbyes, I told her to try to come to the show, but I'll probably never see her again. It certainly made for an interesting evening though.

On a personal note, I really need to start working out. I was looking at the pictures Perry took of Greater Tuna, and I just don't realize how big my belly is. It's embarrassing. I guess it's good for comedic effect, but I don't want to play that role anymore. I need to lose my gut! And I'm going to have some time to do it now."

"event","Well, tonight was preview night, and all in all, it went pretty well. It was really good to finally have some people in the audience. I think they enjoyed it. I also got the feeling that they didn't like me very much. Maybe it's just that super-sensitive actor thing, but I got the sense that I didn't really connect. I'm not sure what to do, either. I would really like some true constructive criticism about what I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong, but people don't want to tell you the truth. I know that should be the director's job, but I haven't really got it from him. So if someone comes to the show in the next day or two, please tell me how I am. I did screw up pretty good tonight, which is really good for me. I feel that unless I screw up on the final dress then the run won't go so well. But I screwed up, so it should be a good run.

I also heard that Enchanted April won best show at the BLT picnic. That's cool. I think I was nominated for best supporting actor, but I'm not sure. Of course, I didn't win. I never win these things. It should be interesting to see the Stage Coach picnic and what awards I can lose there. Oh well. Maybe if I was just a better actor I could get some of that much needed attention I crave. Until that happens, I'll just keep doing shows."

Jared and I drove down yesterday.&nbsp; We had a great time and came up with some great ideas for the competition we are having in October at the Halloween party.

Just thought I would share...<br /><br /><blockquote>Quote from John Quincy Adams, 1821 - ""America has abstained from interference in the concerns of others, even when conflict has been for principles to which she clings as to the last vital drop that visits the heart. She goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign independence, she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition. The fundamental maxims of her policy would change from liberty to force.""</blockquote>"

"event","I had a pretty good night tonight. I went to a meeting of the Boise Adobe Users and Graphic Design Group. A couple of cool things happened. One - there was a discussion of creating a collaboration between designers and programmers to create Rich Internet Applications free of charge for local non-profit organizations. First of all, it's something I would really like to take part in. Also, it's something I would really like to see the theater maybe benefit from. I need to get more information, but I'm excited about the possibilities. Then - a local illustrator presented some techniques using Adobe Illustrator that were pretty good. But after the presentation was what was really cool. I met a bunch of people who kind of accosted me after I said I was a video editor and 3d animator. Not in a bad way. I got a couple of business cards, some job possibilities, and I offered to help some people with some video questions. It was great. I think it's just what I need to push me along into doing some freelance work. I've been a little hesitant because I've felt I really need to bone up on my skills before I try doing it for people. One thing I realized was that I need to get some animation done. I think I could get some good stuff going if I get some decent animation going. So I had a really good time. The people were great and I made a lot of good contacts. <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://purrevil.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://purrevil.livejournal.com/""><b>purrevil</b></a></div>, you missed out!<br /><br />And then I got home and watched American Idol with Neil Diamond.

As I've gotten older, I've come to embrace my love for Neil. He just has great songs, and that voice! Nothing like it. He has a new album coming out that I'm sure I'll be getting. The new song, Pretty Amazing Grace, is great.

"event","Oy. Doing Enchanted April has not been good for my health. I'm really enjoying the show. I'm working with some great people, but it's just been hazardous to me. I've never gotten hurt doing a show before, or missed an entrance for that matter. But during this show, I've found out that I have diabetes. I've been on insulin for the past couple of weeks, and my glucose levels have dropped to around normal ranges, which is good. But I'm just about out of the insulin and I have absolutely no money to get more. I still don't know what I'm going to do about that. I guess I can't blame the show for that, but that was just the start.<br /><br />Last Thursday certainly wasn't my night. My stomach was killing me. Sharp shooting pains that would come and go in waves. All day long. It wasn't gaseous, or other disgusting ailments. I still have no idea what was the matter. but not only that, I ran over my foot with the set piece that we have to spin around. And then Michele poked me in the eye at the end of the show. Not a good night.<br /><br />So I think Friday is going to be much better. I didn't wake up feeling great, but my stomach didn't hurt anymore. By the time the show came around I was feeling much better, ready to settle into a good performance. Well, I must have been a little too comfortable. I was sitting talking to Juliet in the dressing room, and I thought I had much longer to go on than I did. Things got strangely quiet and Steven came running back yelling, ""Mellersh!"" and I realized that I was supposed to be on stage at that moment. (If you've seen Juliet, you can't really blame me.) I went tearing to the stage and as I was going through the side hallway, I could see something flying towards me, hit me in the calf and glance off. Nobody can figure out what it was. I know it was the ghosts. Immediately, my leg was throbbing in pain. I limped on stage, got through the scene and immediately collapsed on the couch in back, not able to walk. My calf swelled up huge and just killed me to try and walk on it. Luckily I didn't have to go on for about half an hour, so I put it up and iced it. I limped through the rest of the night in extreme pain. It's still very painful to walk on it in certain ways, and it's still swollen. I have to go see my doctor for the diabetes stuff early in the week, so I guess I'll just add this to the list. I first thought I tore the muscle, but it is feeling much better now. Maybe I just severely strained it. Luckily, nothing happened to me today, and we had a really good show with a great audience.<br /><br />As for the love part, well, I'm just an idiot. I'll never understand it. When I'm on stage, I'm Superman. I can do anything. Not that my talent is that great, but I feel like I can do anything. When I step off stage, I become this silly fool who can't speak in coherent sentences and says stupid things. At least where the opposite sex is concerned. Sometimes it really amazes me that I was actually married when I can't seem to get a date to save my life. Oy vey...<br /><br />So that's been my life recently. I have to figure out a way to make more money. I think I have to get a second job, but I really don't want to wait tables again. I don't think I could handle it physically anymore anyway. <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://purrevil.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://purrevil.livejournal.com/""><b>purrevil</b></a></div> was talking about doing some web design , and I have thought about that as well.

"event","Well, I got some upsetting news yesterday. I was starting to get really worried about my health. I've dropped a lot of weight in the past couple of months, I'm very tired, and I'm always extremely thirsty. So I went to the doctor last week and had some blood tests run. I found out yesterday that I have diabetes. Well that just sucks. I guess the good news is that it isn't something more serious. It is manageable. I'll have to start eating right and exercising, so maybe I can actually get rid of my belly. I really wouldn't recommend diabetes as a weight loss program though. I guess my blood glucose levels were at 330, whatever that means. All I know is that normal is around 90-100. I've never had any health problems my whole life, except for a bit of asthma when I was a kid, so this whole thing is really kind of getting me down.

So, I guess everyone has a slim, trim, healthy Ben to look forward to. Or a dead Ben. Well, it's not that serious, just being a bit melodramatic. I guess my McDonald's and Jack-in-the-Box diet didn't work after all. I was really holding out hope with me losing so much weight. No, just a chronic disease, that's all.

I am really pissed at the health care system, by the way. It really sucks not having decent insurance."

"event","This has been a busy theater weekend for me, and I have to say a good one. Friday night, I saw A Little Time in the Fall. It was directed by a friend of mine, Jared Hallock, and was performed at BCT's place although not a BCT production. It is an original work written by a local playwright. It started off a little rough. The woman playing the wife was pretty bad. She did get better as the show went on, but still not very good. I found out later that she is the playwright, so what are you going to do. Overall, I really enjoyed it after the shaky start. There were some good performances, although I think the second act could have been a little shorter. But I liked it.

Then last night, I saw Spinning Into Butter. I saw a rehearsal several weeks ago when I was figuring out what to write about it for the newsletter, and it was a little rough. I thought it had quite a ways to go, and I really didn't know what to expect last night. It was absolutely wonderful. Kevin did a great job, and the cast from top to bottom was fantastic. Jodi Deerfield was especially good.

After the show, I began thinking about why I love theater so much. And this was it. This is a show that moves you, in some way. If it doesn't, you have issues. And that's why I just love live theater, for those moments when the audience is moved, forced to think, forced to feel. It inspires me to want to be better, a better actor, better director. To have the opportunity to be able to reach people and touch them, through your performance. It's such a rush.

As a theater, I know we have to pay the bills, and people love to come see the comedies. I just wish we could get to the place where we could maybe do 2 dramas a year. Is that too much to ask? Funny story(kind of) - As I was walking out of the auditorium at Butter, I was behind this older couple. The guy says to his wife, ""You're never dragging me to one of these again. If it's not funny, I don't want to see it."" And that's why we only do one drama a year. Because of rubes like that. Rube!! I like the comedies as well, and I'm not a farce-hater like some of the people I know, but it baffles me as to why people wouldn't want to be touched or moved, at least some of the time. Why does everything have to be mindless entertainment for you? I love to laugh as well, but I also like to think and feel and learn and grow. I know that puts me in the minority.

But a congratulations to Kevin and the cast and crew for an excellent show. And for making me love theater again."

I fell down laughing so hard watching that. Well, last night, Jimmy came back with his response. The star's cameos are the best. I'm still trying to figure out who they all are.

I do have to say the creatures themselves weren't very scary. Seems like pretty much all of Stephen King's creatures don't translate well to the screen. They were a little creepy, but the close up shots of the creatures were kind of silly to me. The psychological aspects of the film were a lot more terrifying than seeing the creatures. And I can still feel rope burns on my hands....

So the total for the long weekend - 12 Dexter episodes, 4 movies, and 1 newsletter done. Not a bad weekend. I don't know if I'm ready to get back to work yet though...."

"event","Well, I've spent more time in front of a screen, in one shape or another, these last few days than I probably have in the past year. It started Wednesday night. I had the last two discs of Dexter from Netflix so I decided to watch them, all. I finished the first season, jaw gaping, more in love with this show than ever, at about 4am. I woke up Thanksgiving day at about noon and started downloading the episodes from this season. Thanksgiving duties cut into my Dexter time, and I got home at about 1am, where I proceeded to watch the first two episodes of the current season. Waking up late again Friday watched Ep. 3, I became frustrated with download times, and eventually headed out to the Flicks to watch No Country for Old Men.

This was a great movie. Highly recommended. I haven't been to an actual theater to watch a movie in so long I forgot how much I love movies. The ability to create a world and tell a story just enthralls me. I've been doing so much with theater lately that I forgot the magic of a movie. I still love theater, don't get me wrong. But movies capture my heart. This movie was really good. The ending is a little different than your normal typical movie, as you would expect from a Coen brothers film. Not everything is wrapped tidily as your typical picture. But it's great.

Not having my fill of movies, I then went to Reel theater to see 3:10 to Yuma. Another really good movie. Russell Crowe gave a great performance, as well as Christian Bale. I find myself getting distracted a lot by the technical aspects of the film. I always seem to be examining how a particular scene was shot, the angles used, the lighting and camera placement. There were a lot of beautiful shots in 3:10 and in No Country. Gorgeous cinematography. I guess that's just a hazard of the business. Same thing goes with theater. I can't go see a show without constantly thinking how I would have blocked a scene differently, or made different choices. I got home and watched another episode of Dexter.

Saturday, I woke up late again. It was nice. I've been working on the newsletter for SCT, which should be done today. It should have been done a couple of days ago. I've felt a little bad about not getting it done sooner, but I've definitely needed some time away from everything for a little bit. It's been really good for me. Watched more episodes of Dexter again, up to Ep. 6, becoming even more enthralled and amazed with each episode. It's so fun to be on the edge of my seat, trying to figure out just how Dexter is going to get out of his situation, and it just keeps getting worse for him. Several times, at the end of the episodes, I'll just yell out loud - ""Damn!!!!!!"" It's been a while since I've watched a show that made me do that. I think Heroes may have had me do that, and 24(although not in the last shitty season). The writing is just outstanding.

I was supposed to go see Beowulf on IMAX with a friend, but I was a little late getting there and it was sold out. So I went to see Bourne Ultimatum. I enjoyed that as well. Lots of great action. Fun movie. Downloaded the last two episodes to catch me up for this season. I watched them this morning. Now I'm just disappointed that I have to wait with everyone else to find out what will happen to Dexter. Ugh... but there's a new episode tonight, and I can't wait to get downloading it!!

So to sum up, in the past 4 days I've watched 12 episodes of Dexter and 3 movies, and I'm thinking of seeing another movie today. I've certainly enjoyed myself, even if I've shirked some of my responsibilities. My mental health needed it."

"event","Well, it's official. NBC will own my life on Monday nights. I watched the premieres of Chuck, Heroes, and Journeyman. They were all great. I thought Chuck was really good, and I'm glad. I was looking forward to it from the previews, and I think it lived up to the hype. I loved the huge stack of AstroDiapers in the big box store. Nice touch. Heroes was great, picking up nicely from last season. I love that show, and I hope it will stay at the level of yuminess. Journeyman was also very good, in my opinion. I was very curious about this show, and wondering just how they would handle the whole time travel thing, but I think they did a good job with it. It has a real Quantum Leap vibe, one of my favorite shows. I look forward to see what they do with it. So needless to say, Mondays are taken. I'll have to reschedule my show rehearsals around Mondays. Well, maybe not, I guess that's what recording is for. But I know I won't be getting much sleep.

So tv is taking over my life, and I think I need to get a handle on it. Mondays - as mentioned above. Tuesdays - House. Wednesdays - not much I'm really interested in. I might check out Bionic Woman, but I don't know if I'll stick with it. Thursdays - Earl, The Office, 30 Rock, Scrubs. Must see TV. I love The Office with a passion, and I can't wait to see what happens with the Pam Jim Situation. Steve Carell is pure comedy genius. And Tina Fey is absolutely brilliant. Friday - I don't know, I kind of like Las Vegas, but there's a new show on CBS called Moonlight about vampires. I'm not sure where that will end up, even if it will last. Could be interesting though.

There are a couple of other shows that look very interesting, but I don't know where they will be on. Pushing Daisies on ABC looks very interesting. And I may have to check out Cavemen a couple of times to see if it's any good, but I don't hold out much hope for it.

I'm sure glad I don't have cable, because I don't have time to keep up with these shows as it is. I am glad to see that some quality programming is coming out of network tv again. It got pretty bad for a while. I still have to keep up with Battlestar Galactica by downloading, and whatever else I get hooked on.

Oh vey. I don't have any time to keep up with my Netflix movies with all this tv...."

One note on the whole Senator Craig scandal. I can't be sure, but I really think he did all of this just for me. I have to be sure to send him a thank-you card. I really wish he would have waited for a couple of months closer to the opening of the show, but I guess you can't have everything. But really, it's quite serendipitous, and to be honest, a little eerie to see all the similarities between the show and the Craig Scandal. The show is about a US Senator in the midst of getting caught in a sex scandal. The senator's name is HARRY Douglas (two first names, LARRY Craig). There are lots of references to coming out of the closet. We are performing it in the very state he is from. The story involves an escort in the DC area (the DC madam was just exposed). I'm sure there are more, but I can't think of them. If I wanted to write a better script about all these events, I don't think I could. And this was written in the late 80s. I think Michael Parker is some kind of Nostradamus or something. I'm sure people won't believe that we chose to do this back in March. All I can say is thank you Larry Craig.

Stay tuned for the coming episodes. They are going to be quite fun. I'll be doing an investigative report on myself, complete with all kinds of compromising positions. I'm sure quite a few Craig references will be in there.

Tell all your friends to watch. And, again, click on the ad at the end of the video to give me a few cents.

Sweet dreams, peaches n cream.

New episode just up. I give a brief overview of the characters in the show, with a special appearance by Riley, my dog, getting into things he shouldn't.

So enjoy! If you can, watch the whole video and click on the ad at the end. I get like $.10 whenever it is clicked, and that would really help to pay for the tapes and such.

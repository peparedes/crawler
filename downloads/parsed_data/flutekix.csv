So we are official...although I think we have been for some time now.  On top of that, this morning I got an email from Sylvan Learning Center asking for me to come in for an interview.  This is defintly a job that I've been looking at for a long time and think it would be awesome to work at a place like this.

"event","You know I'm really going through this really weird stage in my life.  Like the whole world is out to get me.  Which I know is not true.  It's just right now life sucks for me.  And I feel like I should really be happy and I'm not.  

School is ok I guess...I'm not doing as bad as I thought I was, I have a D but I have B's and A's for the rest of my classes.  Best of I've ever done.  But am I happy...No.  I don't know why...it's all this pressure I think that is getting to me.  I feel like I am failing and I don't like to fail.  

As far as friends go...I don't know where I stand there.  I know I have officially pissed everyone off at least one point or another in the past month.  I can't help it...and I don't know how to fix it.  On top of that, I have only three people that really know whats going on with me right now.  Micah, Trisha, and Lastrapes...only b/c I basically live with them.  And of course I feel like such a burden and I'm so sorry for it.  

As far as my relationship life.  Yeah not much to say there.  There is a guy...yeah I do like him...but I can't figure him out.  And little does he know he is actually hurting me in the process.  He thinks he knows me but he really doesn't...I keep way to much inside for him to really know who I am.  Sure your not suppose to live in the past and no I don't.  But I can tell you the relationships I've been in have not been the best for me.  But he doesn't know that...we never talk, and if we do get to hang out we are studying...maybe the reason why my grades are so good.  I think Papa Roach puts it best ""The Scars remind us that the past is real.""  Little does this guy know that since we can't talk and I can explain why I am hurting that he is pushing me away...and I am getting hurt.  Not so much cause he is doing it but because of the scars of my past.  

I'm sorry ya'll...I know I'm depressed...I don't know how to get out of it.  So I'm just going to go and hide under my bed until I can figure myself out and stop hurting the ones that care about me."

"event","Although the name  Katie creates the urge to be reliable and responsible, we emphasize that it causes a blunt expression that alienates others. This name, when combined with the last name, can frustrate happiness, contentment, and success, as well as cause health weaknesses through worry, mental tension, and tension or accidents to the head.

Your name of Katie has created a practical, responsible, stable nature, and you desire to direct the efforts of others rather than to take order or ask permission. You have a determined, self-reliant, capable nature and resent any interference, although in your desire to help you are inclined to become involved in the lives and decisions of other people. You like to make your own decisions and to be the master of your domain. You feel a limitation in your own expression when it is necessary to reach another through tact and understanding."

"event","You know in the future I'll sit down and write this long jounal about how I feel.  Right now I can't...it's still too close to home.  And like I've told my friends who aren't here right now.  You have no idea what it is like.  Sitting on the road for 30 minutes just to get in the gas station.  Walking through the grocery store trying to find bread and realizing that you can't, b/c there are to many people in Baton Rouge to keep up with the supply and demand.  One of these days I'm going to take my camera and just take pictures. As soon as I can get to my apt.  But I can't even do that right now.  I'm scared, and even though you know all of these people are in the same position that your in, you still feel all alone.  I at least I still have a house to live in.  I'm one of the lucky ones.  

""The truth of God's Love is not that he lets bad things happen; its that he's there when they do."" 
 Have faith that God is here.  Pray thats all I'm asking.  Already I've been to the shelters.  Tuesday morning I went door to door asking for blankets for the shelters, and Wednesday I went to Wal-Mart and they donated three cart full of clothes for the shelters.  I wish I could do so much more though.  

I still believe everything will be ok in the end.  People will pull through this and because of this we will become a nation and united again as one.  I was listening to cds earlier today and this song came on and it really hit home.  Time Like These by the Foo Fighters.

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again"

"event","I have come to the conclusion that I hate the summer.  You live three months of the year away from everything and then in the end you have to go back to the way things used to be.  

My summer was awesome (not counting the independent study).  I loved my job, played with kids all day.  A lot of these kids I have worked with for over three years, and I've seen them grow up.  I talked openly to them about my problems and in return they did the same back.  And even though they are kids (so to say) they still understand whats going on in my life, and they still can get hurt just as bad as adults.  I miss them a lot.

And then this summer I made a lot of new friends; built the friendships with people I used to have, got to know new people, and grew stronger with the ones I've known forever.  I got to know this one person really well; whats sad about the whole situation is I've never met him.  We would talk to each other every night, compare our days, help each other out if we had a problem, and complain to each other and not feel bad about it.  He became one of the few people I trusted with everything.  And then...

I lived in a fairy tale this summer.  Things would get me down and I wouldn't let them bother me.  I felt like I was on top of the world.  Then the summer job ends, the kids go back to school, friends start worrying about school, and its time to buy books.  And thats when you realize that the fairy tale is over, and reality is back.  

So my conclusion for the summer is: God puts special people in your life and you don't know why, they may be there for years, they may be there for just a summer.  But there was a reason they were there for that time in your life, b/c God put them there.  And when reality kicks in, all you can do is sit there and have faith that maybe one day all this will make sense to you."

I'm not OK - My Chemical Romance
Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say.
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way.
For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
You wear me out.

What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
(I'm not okay)
I told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what they mean
(I'm not okay)
So be a joke and look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!

I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
You wear me out.

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took?
You said you read me like a book, but the pages are all torn and frayed

I'm okay.
I'm okay!
I'm okay, now
(I'm okay, now)

But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay!
(Trust Me)

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
(Okay)


So this is to those who think it is easy to choose between two good friends.  I'm not a fortune teller...I can't see what is going to happen in the future.  And right now I don't really care.  But you know what, if there are people out there who never want to see me happy...screw you.  Screw all of you guys.  Cause just when I find the time to actually be happy and get my life back on track.  I always have someone there to screw me in the end.  So to that person...you can't run my life...I'm not the same person I was in highschool.  So if you want to control whats going on in my life...I give you the last decision you will ever make for me.  I refuse to choose b/t two good friend.  You go ahead and choose."

7. I'll then tell you something that I've always wondered about you.
and then you will put this in your journal."

"event","He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen.
Then he lies awake and wonders
Why can't that be me?
Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions.
He's left a lot of things he'd rather not mention right now.
But just before he says goodnight,
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

If I could be like that
I'd give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes.
If I could be like that, what would I do?
What would I do?

Now and dreams we run.

She spends her days up in the north park,
watching the people as they pass.
And all she wants is just a little piee of this dream, is that too much to ask?
With a safe home, and a warm bed, on a quiet little street.
All she wants is just that something to hold onto, that's all she needs.

Yeah!

If I could be like that, I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes.
If I could be like that, what would I do?

I'm falling into this, in dreams we run away.

"event","Wow...so it's been a while.  Lots gone on in my life.  Broken up with a boyfriend, finished a semster of school, had a brother graduate from high school, and realized that I am halfway done with college (at least I hope so).  

So I guess the reason for this journal is not to update on my life but more to get down on paper (or screen) what i'm really feeling.  You know it's weird.  I can see myself going throught these hard times in my life..but what seems to have been a nightmare in the past only seems like a stepping stone in my life.  Like if my life were a book...and I started chapters of my book when I was little...I am starting to see some of these chapters close or finally find an ending to them.  Like I can put an end on parts of my childhood and make decissions a while lot easier then before.  You know I'm twenty years old now and what I thought life was going to be like is nothing what it is like.  I used to think that it was goign to be easy cause I would know everything, and that it would be fun cause I would make my own decisions.  But if anything thing to me its the same as when I was younger...the only difference is that I have more responsiblity and that I have the ability to make a person have a good day or a bad day.  I've decided I truly want to become a teacher.  I truly believe that I was put on this earth for something and I feel like that is what I am suppose to do.  I mean I always want to be remembered and not so much remembered by name but to be carried on through teaching.  I think that this is best stated by Henry Adams, ""A teacher affects eternity, he can never tell where his influence stops.""  

I'm always questioning why when I get hurt how God could let things happen to me.  I thought God wasn't suppose to let the bad things happen to you.  Am I not a good person.  I have so much faith and I never understood how God could put bad things in my life and I used to feel like he had let me down.  It's weird how God puts these things and people in your life at exactly the right time you need them.  You might not see realize it unless you truly open your heart to it.  I caught one of those today.  I was watching a tv show and I've been going through a really tuff time as far as figuring out why everytime I try to set out and accomplish something a get a set back.  For instance, I've liked this guy for some time now (I'm talking years) and I never told him just for the fact that it was never the right time.  So I finally thought I figured things out with him and confronted him with it...and realized it wasn't right.  I realized that he didn't like me and I was totally cool with it.  I'm glad the way reacted about it and if it hurt sure but I'm not upset with it.  If I've learned anything in the past couple of years its can't get upset with the little things in life because when the big things come there going to pass you up because your too wrapped up in the little things.  But i could not understand why it felt like God was punishing me for something I did.  Then I was watching this movie tonite and one of the characters said something that really inspired me to write all of this.  He said, ""The truth of God's Love is not that he lets bad things happen; its that he's there when they do.""  I have to have faith that God has this plan for me and that I will find the one that he has set out for me.  

I'm not anything special, I try to listen to people when they need a friend, I'm a shoulder to cry on, and I'm (at least I try) to be a good problem solver. For the first time in my life in six year I am single and happy about it.  Although I sit back and wonder when that speical person will find me.  How long am I to wait until God reveals his plan for me.   I feel myself maturing everyday and the only sure thing in my life is my family and the fact that being around children makes me so happy.  You know when I was in 5th grade I bought this key chain from Claires.  I never understood the meaning of it but I liked the way it looked and figured that one day I would understand what it really ment.  Even though the key chain broke years ago...I kept the paper that was in it and put it on my dresser and maybe once or twice a year I'll try to figure out what it means.  Only tonite when I sat down and looked at it again did i truly realize what it ment to me. 
                      A hundred year from now it will not matter what my bank accound was, 
                      the sort of house I lived in, or the kind of car I drove...But the 
                      world may be different because I was important in the life of a child.  
I may not be anything special but I do know that everyday I have an influnce on a child.  And thats how I'm going to leave my mark on the world.  I'm not going to be the smartest person in the world, I'm not going to be the first women president, I won't be an athlete.  But because I smile at a child everyday I can change the outcome of a childs day, week, month, or summer.  

I've been going through a really confussing time in my life.  I'm not depressed, not upset, nothing exciting is happening, but I'm changing.  And I feel it.  I guess thats what they call growing up.  


""Word Of God Speak""

I'm finding myself at a loss for words
And the funny thing is it's okay
The last thing I need is to be heard
But to hear what You would say

Word of God speak
Would You pour down like rain
Washing my eyes to see
Your majesty
To be still and know
That You're in this place
Please let me stay and rest
In Your holiness
Word of God speak

I'm finding myself in the midst of You
Beyond the music, beyond the noise
All that I need is to be with You
And in the quiet hear Your voice

I'm finding myself at a loss for words
And the funny thing is it's okay"

"event","Well I guess I decided that I should probuably start to post again since it has been almost six months since I last posted.  So I guess your wondering how my life is.  It's great.  Well...kinda...my grades aren't as good as I would like them but its the best I can do and thats all that matters to me.  

I finally decided that I am going to go into education.  Teach elementry kids, and then maybe look into getting my masters in teach autistic (spelling) kids.  I also think I am going to minor in history...however I keep going back and forth on it or music.  I don't know yet...maybe I should just do both.  

It's funny I went through a really ruff time last semester (pretty much I was depressed).  And I remember thinking and wondering what I was going to do with my life, what the purpose was, and why everything just was happening the way it was.  I felt like no one cared (even though they did).  I look back at last semester and I a lot of it is a blurr.  But one thing I know from it is I grew up.  I can honestly say that it was closer of a part of my life and the summer opened the next part of my life.  I remember one day during the summer just sitting down and saying ""you know what its time to move, get over everything and start over with your life.""  I am so happy say that I have done exactly that.  I've accomplished goals in my life that I had set.  I learned things last semester and I learned how to be on my own.  I learned how be tuff and to be able to solve problems by myself and not need the support of someone else.  I will always look back on my freshmen year of college and know that I grew up...I learned to be independent.  (That and the fact that LSU football was awesome!)  

A bunch of good things have come into my life or come back into my life.  I have a group of friends that are so awesome to hang out with.  I have Micah...my best friend for life and my only sister...it is only she that I can go to when I have a problem and she'll calm me down, she always knows exactly what to say to make it all better.  Then there's Casey...my baseball buddy...who else would I call after every game to tell him his Astros lost, plus I can always sit down and talk to him and he'll understand.  As long as he always remembers to ... or think before he says something.  Then theres Deigo...my SuperNES buddy...between his knowlodge of Psychology and the game of Mario Kart I will always be prepared when he is around plus he keeps me on my toes with History.  And then there is Chris (Bill)...the only guy I know that will take a nap on the tables in the library.  Plus he always makes me laugh.  There are others of you guys out there these are just the ones that came to mind at the moment.  

As far as school goes I'm pushing myself harder then I ever have with school.  This semester has been one of the best semesters so far.  Nothing bad has come out of it.  Football season is good...well ok.  But I guess you can't win them all.  Plus I can always fall back on LSU Baseball.  

Another thing that has come into my life is I have a boyfriend again.  I'm going out with Troy.  I guess I can say its about time.  He's great guy and he really looks out for me.  We have a great relationship because its souly based on trust.  He's in the army and is stationed at Fort Stewart in Savannah GA.  So we really don't get to hang out too much.  But we talk all the time and have learned to use the nights and weekends on the cell phones.  Because of the distance thing we have learned to trust each other, because we don't feel like we have to be tied down.  It's a great relationship for me because I've learned to deal with problem on my own and learned to push myself to the limits for school and I feel like I don't have to worry about stepping on his toes and sharing time with him and school.  Troy and I have known each other for years and we've been best friends long time, and he knows me and knows how to make me feel better about myself.  Even if we are a couple of states apart, which will soon be countries.  I learn a lot from him and thats just what makes it more interesting everyday that goes by.  Plus he makes me smile.   

OK well I'm outta here now that I have completely bored you.  Plus I have a couple of test I need to study for and I'm running on a couple of hours of sleep from the weekend because of studing.  Gosh, I love college!!!  Post me a message if you want...if not o'well.  
Later!"

This week I start finals for my freshmen year of college.  I can't believe its almost over.  The year feels like it has gone by so fast and still I look back and so much has happened.  And all I have left is two finals...one tuesday (math) and one Saturday (anthropology).  

I'm going to miss all of my friends over the summer.  Especially all of those going to Ohio.  You guys are leaving Micah and me...all we are going to have is each other.  Oh well... I guess thats how it has always been Micah.  Through all the years, and all the things that have happened we still have each other.  

I want to thank all my friends (you know who you guys are) who have helped me get through this past semester.  It might seem like I've been upset with you guys but I'm not.  It just took me a while to figure out some things and to really realize that you guys were just trying to help me.  I love you guys for that.  

Too Trisha, roomie, I'm going to miss you next semester.  We'll have to get a class together and eat lunch everyonce in a while together.  Love you chick. 

Well I'm outta here.  Later you guys."

"event","Ok so i wrote this long message and it got screwed up.  Needless to say i don't feel exactly like writing another one right now.  

I'm out of the hospital...yay....but i am still kinda feeling crapty.  I'd tell you why i was there but none of the docters really new why i was there.  They said that it was either the flu, a viral infection, a bacterial infection.   They said it could have also been a combination of the two.  The reason they kept me for so long was because I had been taking some strong drugs and ran a very high fever with it. They said that the only reason they would really be able to determine what was wrong with me was if they gave me surgery and if they did they weren't exactly sure that they would still be able to figure out what was wrong with me.  

I want to thank Micah and Keith for coming a vistiting me.   And Keith thanks for the flowers and the cd of LOTR and your cd player.  Micah thanks for the puzzle, and the crayons and coloring book(s).  And i don't know if casey got me the snoopy one or not but thanks.  BTW...Casey how are you suppose to color pictures of snoopy if snoopy is white?. Thanks everyone for the prayers.  I love all of you guys."

"event","ok so school is about to start and I'm nervous for some odd reason.  I know your probuably like wait its your second semester, right?!?  I need to be able to bring my G.P.A. up to a 2.75 by the end of this semester in order to get in the college of education.  I have a 2.50 right now and I know I possibly can do it.  It's just really going to be a stressful semester.  Especially since I can't rely on the football season to cut the stress.  

But anyways.  Any words of encouragement is always helpful.  But its cool cause i don't really think anyone ever reads this.  
Later you guys."

"event","Ok so guess who decided to get a website.  Well I know that it really isn't a website but it's close enough.  At least it's good until Keith helps me make a real one. 

So how is everyone.  My life sucks right now.  Probuably cause I have too much on my mind.  Ever feel like you want to talk to someone and you can't and the one person that you know you can always talk to is not there.  That's how I feel right now.  I need to talk to someone but the one person that I can openly talk to is gone.  

We'll I'm going to play Max Payne.  I want to beat the first one again before I start playing the second one."

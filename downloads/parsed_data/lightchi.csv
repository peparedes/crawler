"event","Today has seemed like one of those days when everything was really boring, but at the time it didn't feel boring, but when you reflect on your day, you realized you didn't do squat. That was kind of confusing. I'm not sure if I even understand it...Hmm, I'm going to keep it though. Maybe I'll confuse a genius. 

Anyway...I have developed a new respect for lawn-mower-people. Kindred spirits. I had to mow today and it was painful. I had to use the...pushmower! Then I came back inside and drunk a big class of coke. *sigh* After that, here I am. I've been pestering ppl by leaving comments on random journals. Ppl are neat. I also found three more quizzes...Yeah, and I'm going to post them. I told Griffin about them and he said that I needed a new hobby. Ah, well, for now here are the new quizzes!

"event","I guess I should explain myself first because this journal use to belong to someone else. A girl in a chatroom was talking about livejournal, I said it sounded cool, and she gave me her password; She said I could have it. I'm really glad she did too, because this site turned out to be awesome! So...now you know how I got here! 

Anyway, everyone takes these neat quizzes, so I took a few...

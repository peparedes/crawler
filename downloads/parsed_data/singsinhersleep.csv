I guess I just needed to vent somewhere other than in front of a living being.  Some things are better left unsaid, but that doesn't mean they have to stay in your head.

Now that I'm here I don't know what to say.  I guess I just feel frustrated about certain aspects of my life.  But then again not really.  There are a few people who play different roles in my life and I don't know if I like that.  I don't know if I want those roles to be fulfilled anymore, at least not by them.  Am I brave enough to live without their presence?  I think I am.  I think I am probably much braver than I give myself credit for."

"event","School will be done before I know it.  I only have four more class sessions to attend, and then that's it for a long time.  Graduate school isn't even in my vocabulary right now.

When will life stop transitioning into the next phase?  Wait, is that a useless question?  Will life always be transitioning into something else?  When will there ever be any stability?

I've been having long talks lately with myself and with others on the state of things, and they always put me in these really serious head spaces.  Sometimes it's hard not to feel so tense.

The trip to Europe has been cancelled.  None of us are really all that sad.  Now, I will have to look for work, and start saving for mortgage payments.  That should be fun.  Why did I just type that?  It's not what I meant at all.  It most certainly will not be fun.

Anyway, this past month has been crazy.  School's hectic, but I'm steadily approaching the light at the end of the tunnel.  I've been commuting a lot to record and rehearse with Low Fat, which takes hella long for both.  It's fun, though.  Plus I haven't been getting much sleep lately for talking on the phone to people who don't live nearby.  But I'm still out of the house by 6:45am everyday, regardless.

I really want one of those eye masks that you put in the freezer before you wear it to reduce puffiness.  I used to have one, but I tossed it in the move.  Maybe it's psychosomatic, but a cold cloth doesn't provide the same effect.

"event","Tahoe was fucking sick in the head.  Did not want to leave.  Loved every waking minute of it.

The drive up was alright.  It was really dark, but the moon was eerily present.  It was gorgeous, actually.  Stepped out of the car and realized how cold it actually was up there in the mountains.  Didn't realize how much I took that for granted.

Got to the suite and watched ""An American Werewolf in London,"" which was a propos considering the huge moon outside our window.  Good way to unwind the night.

Saturday we walked around South Tahoe Blvd.  Got a really cool snowboarding jacket.  Even though I don't snowboard. . .it was cool to add it to my collection of coats.

Never occurred to me that Tahoe would be a ""man's town.""  There were men everywhere!  Everywhere. . . I guess it's the rugged individualism of the great outdoors and the machismo factor of extreme sports (relatively speaking,)  but there was definitely an air of male-bonding going on.  Plenty of eye candy, at least.

Played at the pub for three hours.  It's not that long, really, cuz that's usually how long our rehearsals are.  After one night of rehearsal and two consecutive shows, my left thigh is black and blue from me slamming the tamborine into it with all my might.  Didn't even feel the pain while I was performing, though.

Broke massive ground with my mom, too.  Discussed the potential of encountering some herb heshing at an after-party, and she was actually totally cool with it.  She said she wouldn't judge me if there was ""weed being passed around and I took a hit.""  I was very, very, very surprised.  It made me feel wonderful that we could confide in each other about experimenting.  I'm all about respecting that woman, and she deserves all the respect I can give.

Wasn't too nervous in front of the audience.  It was interesting to perform in the day time in front of all ages, where I could see their faces and everything.  Felt more awkward than anything.  Since I like to dance and bounce to the music, sometimes I felt silly, but most times not.  I really like playing with those guys.  Can't wait for the Feb. 25 show."

"event","The SF Ballet Opening Night and Gala were so much fun.  Never been to such a formal event before.  Men and women were dressed to the 9's in ball gowns and tuxedos.  Everyone looked so beautiful.

Didn't realize the gala was such a prestigious affair.  Apparently it was a big fundraiser, so there were a lot of blue-bloods and socialites there.  The biggest socialite of them all, Miss Paris Hilton, was even in attendance.  We totally spied on her in the box seats with some binoculars.  Someone said they saw Sean Hayes from ""Will and Grace"" walking around the lobby, and I wouldn't be surprised if he were there, too.

The performances were gorgeous.  There was a great combination of classical and contemporary pieces, and one from ""In the Middle"" got the most applause.  It closed the first act, and as we semi-jokingly evaluated it, it was ""the new millenium,"" the ""industrial revolution of Metropolis,"" so to speak.  Also really liked the rendition of ""My Funny Valentine,"" and a few other pieces.  Most of them were male-female pairs, solos or trios.  I expected to see more company numbers, but that was reserved for the finale of ""I Got Rhythm.""

Later, the after party was a lot of fun.  It was in City Hall, and filled with people.  Khoi and I got our picture taken for sfsocial.com, so I'll have to check the site to see if we made the cut.  There was an open bar, free food and lots of swanky folks to look at.  As usual, though, we spent the whole night on the dance floor.  At one point, this really cute male ballet dancer came and cut it up with us, but apparently he was still a teenager.  Nonetheless, he was a little cutie, and it was fun to see a classically trained dancer try to get down to 70's disco funk.

All in all, I felt really privileged to be there, and it was a wonderful escape from the duldrums of an average Wednesday night."

"event","Felt melancholy today.  It took forever to get home on the freeway, which left me time to be alone with my thoughts again.  Don't like to do that if I can avoid it, but I never can.  Actually shed a few tears in the car, which is ridiculous.  Can't control that even when my mom is right next to me.  What would have happened if she asked me why I was crying?  What lie would I have made up?  She always knows why, though.

J makes me happy whenever I see him.  His innocence astounds me, but I know he's an introvert.  Most males are.  Being with him made me forget about the things that bother me.  

While I was in the car listening to music, I remembered something Chris said about writing songs.  He said the lyrics you write become your mantra, because you sing them over and over.  So why sing about depressing, angry bullshit all the time?  I think it was a Michael Franti song that made me think about that.  It's true, you know.  Music really does have a way of altering one's moods.  This reminds me that I haven't written song lyrics in about two months.  It will be time to do that again soon."

The only reason for the vomit was this stupid dry cough I've got going on.  If only I'd carried my bag with me the whole time, maybe it wouldn't have happened.  

The contents of my stomach came out surprisingly easily once I just relinquished control of my muscles.  Can see how easy it could be to become bulimic that way.  I've heard for some people, it only takes a tap of the fingertip on the tongue to get ta spewin'.

Been exhausted ever since, though.  Just want to lay down and rest, but now I'm over here at the fam's, cooking dinner and watching kids.  The simple life, indeed.

Deleted my friendster and myspace accounts.  It feels very good.  I do feel bad for some of the great penpals I've made on myspace, though.  It will seem a bit shady that I just up and ditched them without saying goodbye.  In the long run, though, it doesn't really matter.  It never really did."

Got a weave and a gown for the gala this Wednesday.  Can't wait to go.  Just hope I'm not sick then.  Have to be better for Tahoe this weekend.  

It's good to be home with the fam, but sometimes I realize how used I'd gotten to being on my own.  Even though it was lonely and hard to be out there sometimes, I am already starting to feel smothered here.  But we always want what we can't have, don't we?  If I were living alone, even without a roommate, I'd probably still be over here all the time.  

The schedule of a college student has given me this false sense of instability and insecurity.  Had a conversation with someone a while back about that.  It's like, every four months you  have to change your daily routine, and you're always changing your habitat, moving, trying to make ends meet cuz you can't hold down a steady job, etc.  What's it going to be like in four months when all that is over?  Will I feel antsy because things will settle into a longer routine?  Somehow, I'm not so sure of that.  

Had to skip rehearsal tonight to try and rest my voice, but I still went there to pick up some lyric sheets and a disc.  The guys were really nice to me.  They always are.  Sometimes I trip out for being the only girl and being the youngest, but not so much.  One guy in the band was travelling abroad for most of the time that I got to know everyone before, and now that he's back, I'm not really sure how to approach him.  I sense that he feels the same about me.  Won't take it too seriously just yet, though.

The irony is that we weren't even dancing the way we normally do at nightclubs.  We were much tamer than usual.  Hmm...I guess that means my moves are much more elaborate than I thought.

I'm sick again now.  That really bugs me.  I've been sick for practically an entire month, but not sick enough to really incapacitate me.  Just sick enough to make me feel crummy.  I want to feel better so I can drink, dance and partyup the way I usually do.  

The Golden Globes were good this year.  I was thoroughly entertained.  The highlight was when Prince came out to present the viewing of ""Ray"".  He looked great, sounded great and had great facial expressions.  I was very pleased to see him there.  Plus, Jamie Foxx's acceptance speech was very moving.  I can't wait to see it in reruns on Bravo.

Hmm, I'm bored now.  Have to work for 8 hours today.  Just like every other day.  Can't wait for school to start to bring an end to this monotony.  Just four more months and then I'll be able to move on to the next chapter."

Chris is a dope cat to talk about music with.  It takes us, like, three hours to record two songs, and I'm not even talking about full songs, just backing vocals.  This is because we're always digressing about music.  This is a good feeling.

As a side note, my attachment to Madonna is reducing.  She's playing on launchcast right now, and it made me realize I don't pay as much attention to her as I used to.  That makes me feel sad, but I don't care.  She doesn't pay my bills.

"event","Every time I watch a documentary, I bawl my freaking eyes out.  Seriously, it's not even funny.

One day this weekend I watched a documentary about little people called ""Dwarf: Not a Fairy Tale,"" or something like that.  There were all these segments about little people and their life experiences.  I caught the tail end of one where a man in the South was asked to dress up like an elf for a children's Christmas party, and the footage showed him leaving his home in full regalia and then interacting with all these brown-skinned preschoolers.  He kept saying, "" I just wanted to do it for the children.""  This was the beginning of my sentimental response.

What really did it for me was the story of Martha, an unusually little woman of only 3 feet.  She was a teacher for at-risk children (read: Black boys and welfare babies) in Virginia.  She said she hated the ""m-word,"" midget.  She compared it to the n-word.  This increased her rapport with the children, because she felt their plights were similar as outsiders from the mainstream.  

She was shown with her boyfriend, who was considered to be of normal height (not a dwarf,) but he was only 4'10"".  He said he loved feeling like her man whenever she asked him to get something of the shelf, because she was the first person he'd dated that was shorter than him.

A year later, Martha, her boyfriend and family were celebrating her 28th birthday, and there was footage of everyone giving her gifts.  When they asked her boyfriend what he'd gotten her, he said he bought her a haircut.  I was so disappointed.  That's a horribly unromantic gift.  Everyone said outright that he was in the doghouse for that one.  But then he surprised them all by presenting an engagement ring when everything was said and done and asking Martha to marry him. 

This is what really opened up my floodgates.  I was so overjoyed that someone as strong and independent as Martha could find love, even when she admitted she was not attractive to most people in the world.  It was very touching.  Then I got all sappy, because I thought, if Martha can find a little man to fit her needs, then there is hope for us all, isn't there?

The second documentary that made me cry was about middle-aged life-sentence prisoners in a Louisiana penitentiary.  Seeing all these men who are my dad's age and have been in jail since they were 18-25 years old was practically unbearable.  I was presented with institutional racism and oppression, and all I could think about was what life would be like for the Black community if these men, who were now wiser and reformed, God-fearing men, were at that point of personal development on the outside as fathers to generations of young Black people.  What would the state of my community be then?  Much better.  Stronger and more self-reliant.  But when half the population is locked up or emasculated by the patriarchy, it's no wonder that we're having trouble protecting ourselves from oppression.  

I cried very hard at the thought of this and many other things.  In the end, I was thankful for my life and what I was lucky enough to have been given, both physically and socially.  

This is why I want to be famous.  I want to have access to the money and public speaking ground that will allow me to at least get some awareness about something out there somewhere."

Since I'd never seen the movie before, I wasn't sure what to expect.  It turns out that there are not laugh tracks every time Jamie Foxx says something remotely funny.  I had to ask someone I was watching the movie with if this was part of the film.  He said it wasn't, and continued that someone had just taken a camera into a full screening of the movie and rolled tape.  What?  That's crazy talk.  The rest of the movie was filled with the most loud and outrageous Black folks reacting to all the violence and hilarity of this suspense thriller.   The piece de resistance was whenever someone would get up to leave the theater.  Yes, this was caught on film, too. 

This movie would make good fodder for a drinking game.  Anytime the audience laughs or claps, take a drink."

Damn, another wonderfully produced track ruined by her dissonant, tinny voice that has no lower levels.  It just makes me sad that someone with such little vocal talent has put out, what is it now, four albums?  Just goes to show you that talent isn't everything as long as you've got the right team backing you to create an image that sells.  The sad thing is, I buy into it.  If that song comes on in a club, it will make me lose my mind the same way Beyonce's ""Crazy in Love"" does.  At least I know my sister will probably buy J.Lo's cd, and I can burn it and enjoy it secretly.

So when I'm making that hour-long commute to and from school twice a day, I have a lot of time to think.  I like to listen to music so I can drown out all the irritating ambient noise from other people.  Whenever I listen to music this way, I drift off into the vastness(?) of my daydreams.  Depending on how good the song is, it makes me feel amazing.  Literally, it can feel better than an orgasm.  Okay, not on the trains, but that feeling occurs a lot when I'm by myself listening to music.  And don't get me in a club dancing in a room full of strangers when that mood hits.  It's like no one else is around, and I'm having a very fulfilling masturbatory experience while fully clothed.  It's definitely my favorite escape."

"event","Went to the student center for breakfast, and ordered something other than my usual fare.  Sat down to eat it, and about three minutes into the meal, someone asks to join me.  Instinctually, I say yes, and look up to find someone I know more than casually.  Surprised?  Yes, pleasantly.  It was interesting that he asked to sit with me, because there were 50 empty tables surrounding us.  But we know each other, so it wasn't odd.

Ended up talking for an hour, far after the food had been eaten.  The conversation was stimulating as always.  Talking to him reminds me of The Mind Fuck.  

The Mind Fuck is something my friend and I came up with freshman year.  It describes a verbal encounter you have with someone (heterosexist=male+female). Basically, The Mind Fuck is the conversational equivalent of a mad, crazy one night stand. The tricky thing is finding a balance between the The Mind Fuck and The Body Fuck.

Just had a conversation last night with one of my favorite adults about 'existential men,' so it's (not really) coincidental that this morning an existential man found his way into my sphere.  All I can say is it was refreshing to talk to someone and have him hear me and understand me.  It was also nice to have someone else say things I've thought before, too.  There was an air of intensity in the subject matter, though, and I found it ironic that I was telling someone to have more fun and not beat himself up about not having it all figured out by age 22.    

The conversation was cut short as our lives were pulling us in the direction of our obligations.  We will cross paths again, though.  The universe has a way of doing that."

"event","Princess gathered for rehearsal last night.  It was great to see everyone again.  We all fell back into place and got a lot of ground covered.  I had forgotten how good it feels to play those songs with those people in that space.  Throughout the whole rehearsal I had trouble standing still because I was just so happy.  Everything made me smile.  It seems like we're all ready to start some new aspects of the project, though, like adding songs, booking gigs and recording audio.  The next few months could prove to be very busy if everything goes as planned.

When I finally got back home, I was so exhausted.  Commuting may be very taxing, but I need to get used to it.  Even though I know I'm tired after rehearsals, it still takes about an hour to unwind and release all the energy that's been built up for the three hours of work I put in.

While I slept, I had this crazy-ass dream.  In the dream, I was getting text messages from someone, but they weren't texts.  Instead, they were mini clips of pseudo-soft porn films starring b-list celebrities.  It was random.  But the messages were coming so fast that I didn't have time to watch all of one before another came through.  What's more, I didn't want them at all.  I suppose the person sending them just thought it was a kind gesture, in an obsessive-compulsive sort of way.  

Eventually, I woke up in my dark-ass room and found my phone.  Sure enough, it was actually being blown up with a message.  I hate when my phone finds its way into my dreams.  I think I'm going to start turning the phone off at night.  Being exposed and accessible to people 24/7 is starting to lose its appeal."

"event","Something changed. &nbsp;&nbsp; She looks amazing after being away from the company for a few weeks, starting a new job, seeing someone that sounds like a really nice guy, and lord knows what else that is going on in her life.

The difference in her face and her stance was immediately apparent.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked as though she was living in a better world compared to not even a month ago.&nbsp; It can all be summed up with a single word.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looks HAPPY.

I wish everyone that I know could go through such a transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I only wish they didn't have to go through the difficulties that she has experienced over the past few months to get there.



Now I am starting to look at myself in the mirror and I see dark circles under my eyes....&nbsp; more than a few pounds overweight....&nbsp; tired enough that i can't get to sleep....&nbsp;&nbsp; perpetual headaches, and anxiety that fuels nervous energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know a few things, but what else will I need to do to experience such an uplifting change for myself?&nbsp;&nbsp;"

Directed by Ishiro Honda (Godzilla, Rodan, etc.), the Japanese movie with American actors was the very first movie I was allowed to see at the theater - sans parents.&nbsp; A half dozen of my cousins and I went to see the movie at the Strand theater in Kalispell, Montana.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of two theaters in the town, the Strand was geared towards younger crowds.&nbsp; Family oriented films would be shown at the Strand while the adult themed movies were screened at the theater across the street.&nbsp;&nbsp; I honestly can't remember the name of the other theater.&nbsp; It was the Royal, or Grand, or something along those lines.<br /> <br />Latitude Zero was recently released on DVD and I was able to watch it this weekend.&nbsp; I remembered more about the movie than I expected. From the gold outfits to the glove weapons the details were as clear to me as if I had seen it just a few days before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The submarines were even more fantastic than I had remembered though. <br /> <br /> This film was the start of my lifelong love of movies and science fiction in general.&nbsp; Less than a decade later Star Wars was released and I watched it for the first time in the same theater.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, Star Wars was a very important film for all sci-fi fans, but Latitude Zero was my first.&nbsp;&nbsp; You always remember your first."

"event","Every Sunday morning my son runs out for Starbucks coffee and breakfast.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if it can be called a tradition since it started less than a year ago, but it is certainly a regularly scheduled event.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike drives whichever car is lowest on fuel and stops by the gas station to fill it up.&nbsp;&nbsp; The food and drink order is virtually the same every week, but still we have to write it down or we risk getting something completely different.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately I have been trying to change my order towards something a little more healthy, although Burger King Cheesy Tots don't qualify as health food.&nbsp;&nbsp; Small steps I suppose.

Yesterday morning, Mike was startled when he opened the door to leave for the Sunday breakfast run.&nbsp;&nbsp; A small gray striped cat was waiting at the door.&nbsp; Mike stopped and looked at the cat, the cat looked back and with a little mewl walked in as if he owned the place.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

""Who are you?"" Mike asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike was actually smiling when he spoke to the cat.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he actually expected an answer.

""Mew, Meeeew, MEW!"" the cat cried.&nbsp; &nbsp; The lithe body crouched low to the carpet as he reached the middle of the room. &nbsp; Tuxedo had just appeared at the kitchen door, his tail three times thicker than normal, his ears pinned back. &nbsp;&nbsp; 

The gray cat turned and looked at me. &nbsp; I stared back. &nbsp; Just as I started to move the visitor jumped into my lap and rubbed his cheek against my hand. &nbsp; I was startled at how cold his fur was against my hand.&nbsp; As I stroked his back I realized that the cold went deeper than the fur, his skin was like ice. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  

I pulled the cat closer to my chest and tried to warm him while keeping a close watch on the location of his paws.&nbsp; So far he seemed friendly but I wasn't taking any chances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I rubbed his head I tried to turn the collar to read the gold circular tag that dangled there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tag was the size of a dime and the writing was too small for me to read easily.&nbsp;&nbsp; My glasses weren't close enough to grab and the writing was so very tiny.&nbsp;&nbsp; It still surprises me at how many different things make me feel old.

I was finally able to read the phone number and at the same time learned that our visitor's name was Bandit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike grabbed Tuxedo and took him downstairs as Carol called Bandit's family.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bandit had started getting anxious and his hind claws were starting to poke through the denim of my jeans.&nbsp;&nbsp; He started to calm down as soon as Tuxedo was out of sight, and he settled into my chest and reached up to rub his cheek against my face.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Bandit was well fed and seemed more interested in warming himself than anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the cat and keeping him from exploring the house seemed to be the wisest course of action.&nbsp; Meanwhile Carol copied the address down and explained to Bandit's family that we weren't interested in any reward.

Mike set the cat carrier, pulled from the closet, onto the couch and opened the door.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cradled Bandit in my arms, stood and walked over to the carrier.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sounds that Bandit made as I tried to put him into the small plastic cage were nothing short of startling.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were the most un-cat like squeaks and groans that I had ever heard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Squirming and squeaking, writhing and hissing, yet all the while a deep purr emanated from deep within the gray short haired feline.&nbsp; 

When I was able to close and latch the door Bandit turned and looked out at me and with a quiet but firm ""Mew"" he let me know that he was ready to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe he mean to say that he was unhappy with me for putting him the cold unhappy place.&nbsp; I prefer to think the former.

After Mike left the house, carrier and Bandit in hand, I walked downstairs and released Tuxedo from the bathroom prison he endured with such dignity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuxedo lifted his chin and his tail high into the air and exited the bathroom with an affected air of royalty.&nbsp;&nbsp; He climbed the stairs deliberately and without the slightest betrayal of any fear of the intruder.&nbsp;&nbsp; He sniffed around the upstairs and then inspected his food area and after assuring himself that he was again the reigning king of the land he returned to his normal resting place and lay down for a nap.

Mike refused the reward money for returning Bandit to his home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if we will see Bandit again, or if he will stay closer to home.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he does wander off again I hope he is just as polite to the next family he visits."

"event","An akita puppy came to the house on Saturday.&nbsp; It was a test of how well a dog might fit into our household.

The dominant cat in the house, Tuxedo, was immediately traumatized when Tora came into the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tux had just started to head for the door when Tora came in and said hello in the way that puppies do, by reaching out and seeing what happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tux freaked.&nbsp;&nbsp; He hissed, moaned, growled, and ran.&nbsp; Not necessarily in that order.

I tried to force Tux off his perch to disastrous result.&nbsp; He held on to the carpeted landing and my footing was lost on the recliner and as I pulled and he pulled it ended up with me falling.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tux fell in between the recliner and the end table and after a few minutes of chaos he leapt back to his perch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Not being one to leave things alone, I persisted and walked behind the furniture and finally pulled Tux from his vantage point above the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; I took him to the basement where he could relax without having to see Tora.

After a while Tux came back to the main floor and we all sat in the sun room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tux begrudgingly sat on the couch being petted, growling all the while, as Tora continued to explore and play with the cat toys.

Up to that point I think things went as well as was possible given the way the two animals met.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could've controlled that meeting a little better but the first impression was made and can't be undone.

The rest of the weekend wasn't as pleasant.&nbsp; It seems as though Tuxedo has decided to reassert his dominance over the household.&nbsp; The upstairs cat, Lilly, is in fear now as Tux is making it clear that he is in charge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tux has broken through the gate that separates the two cats and Lilly has lost more than a little fur over the last few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Once Tuxedo feels as though he is in control again things will start to return to normal.&nbsp; I hope it doesn't take too long.&nbsp; I like to sleep at night."

"event","After five hours of cleaning the house is finally at a point where I won't be embarrassed to have a delivery person look inside the front door.  The major piles of crap have been redistributed to more appropriate locations.  Dishes that were used almost a week ago have finally been washed and put away.  The dining room table can actually be used to serve a meal, after another pass of disinfectant cleaner.   I can walk from the front door to the kitchen without having to weave left or right around dirty clothes, shopping bags, or empty boxes.   I can sit in my chair and look around without feeling sick to my stomach.   It has been a productive day.

The house is far from clean. &nbsp; The surface has been scratched and&nbsp; although slight, the progress feels good. &nbsp;&nbsp; I can't describe the level of anxiety reached earlier today. &nbsp; The family finally left on the vacation trip around noon, leaving me alone to get some work done for the office.&nbsp; I tried to sit and focus on the computer screen and the level of mess around me filled my vision. &nbsp; I couldn't sit still while surrounded by so much mess. &nbsp; 

To be honest&nbsp; it is all just clutter and about four days worth of dirty dishes and a kitchen floor that needs a serious amount of sweeping and a hot mop.&nbsp; Well, then there are several baskets worth of clothing strewn about the master bedroom, bathrooms that need to be hosed down, and cat boxes that hadn't been changed in waaaay too long.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I focused on things that smelled, and things I could see when trying to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cat boxes have been changed, the dishes are done, and the main floor clutter has been excised.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I can sit down and work without my heart beating in my throat and blood rushing in my ears.&nbsp;&nbsp; The anxiety reached a level that nearly brought tears to my eyes.

I wish I could ignore the other people in the house and just keep it clean.&nbsp; When I am not alone I feel as though I shouldn't be the only one... I shouldn't have to do all the work myself... I try to keep things clean and organized, and then something in me just gives up...&nbsp; I just stop trying to do it all and nothing gets done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rationalize my behavior, telling myself that I am just waiting until someone else pitches in or that I shouldn't bother if no-one else cares.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

In the end though it affects my entire day.&nbsp; When the house is a mess my self esteem drops and I start to doubt everything about myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I feel bad I convince myself that I am not worth taking care of and my diet goes out the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am making it sound like all of my problems stem from living in a dirty house.&nbsp; Not true... I have lots of problems, this is just the one that I am complaining about today.

My family is away for three days.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get the house to myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now I wish it were for a month, I wonder how I will feel in a few days."

The last thing I think about at night is my friend. 

The first thing I think about in the morning is my friend.

Throughout the day I think about her and wish I could ball up everything that is bad and hide it from her even for a short while.

She deserves much better than is happening, but I know that she will make it through because she is also one of the brightest and strongest people I know.

Were it not for her I would probably not be here today.  She has a greater impact for me than she probably knows, and I will do anything for her.

"event","I am feeling very depressed today. &nbsp; It started at the Renaissance Festival.&nbsp; I was at the House of Musical Traditions looking at hand drums.&nbsp; I want to pick up an inexpensive djembe, bongo drums, or similar small hand drum. &nbsp; I want to learn to play some basic rhythms so I can appreciate the cajone that Jay has offered to make.&nbsp;&nbsp; But as I looked and was offered to try them I couldn't bring myself to even try. I felt incapable of playing or even trying in front of people.&nbsp; 

The same thing happened to me when I was looking at the cajone while Jay looked on.&nbsp; I couldn't bring myself to even try.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was embarrassed and felt insignificant in front of those around me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Doug let me try his PRS guitar I had the same reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the same thing that is keeping me from taking my bass guitar to jam with Doug and Jay.

Now I am sitting here and the anxiety is filling my chest and I feel more foolish than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","It was a great day today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best birthday I have had in the last 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't plan to do anything special or anticipate anything in particular.&nbsp; When I woke up this morning I decided that I would have a nice day.&nbsp; I wouldn't let anything bother me since today was my day.&nbsp; I just wanted to have a day where I didn't think badly of myself.&nbsp; I had that day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling food about myself for the entire day was my gift to myself.

Before the morning huddle I was visited by Christine.&nbsp; She had balloons and the largest gift bag I have ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp; After arranging the balloons in my cube so they could be seen by everyone I opened the two gifts that were in the bag.&nbsp; The first was a pair of black Vans shoes with koi designs in white.&nbsp; Very Very cool.&nbsp; I remember her asking about shoe size the other day, and I didn't pick up on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second gift was a purple-ish t-shirt with a fantastic design depicting a kimono clad skeleton clutching a Japanese parasol and standing in a patch of white flowers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again a perfect match for my taste and I love it.

When I tried on the shoes at work I was so tickled that I wore them the entire day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time I looked down and saw them I felt giddy inside.&nbsp; As much as I like the design of the shoes it is the thought and care that went into selecting the shoes, even to the point of asking my shoe size in a way that totally went over my head.&nbsp; It has been a long time since anyone put that much thought into something for me.&nbsp; 

I changed into the shirt after making it home and it fits very well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I plan on heading to the same store to find other shirts by the same manufacturer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again this is a gift that was very well thought out and I am touched.&nbsp;&nbsp; Christine knows me very well.


Today has been a very good day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't imagine it being any better."

"event","I watched two different Highlander movies this week.<br /><br />The first, <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0465657/"">Highlander: The Search for Vengance,</a> is an animated adventure which was actually quite good.&nbsp; The plot was straightforward and the story telling followed the Highlander formula without being too tied down by it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The animation was consistent although not beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp; The story follows Colin MacLeod as he fights through a post-apocalyptic landscape seeking revenge for the murder of a lover.<br /><br />The second movie, <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0299981/"">Highlander: The Source,</a> is a made-for-TV movie starring<a href=""http://imdb.com/name/nm0001600/""> Adrian Paul</a>.&nbsp; I wish I could find something good to say about this movie.&nbsp; The movie is live-action over questionable CGI in a post-apocalyptic world which finds several immortals seeking the source of their immortality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat through the entire movie hoping for some sort of payoff, only to be cheated in the end.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can only hope that the actors were payed well since they will all have to suffer this work on their resume.<br /><br />There can be only one... and&nbsp; <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0102034/"">Highlander II: The Quickening</a> is no longer the worst movie in the series. &nbsp;"

First I have to say that I do not write well and I do not have any illusions to the contrary.  My writing may have improved over the last year due to the inspiration and support of a very good friend.   She, on the other hand, is a fabulous writer and I hope that she continues to write for a long time."

I grew up in an house where both kinds of music was heard...  Country AND Western.   All kidding aside, my parents were fans of country music.  When we would go to the Dixie Inn, a local diner, I would be given a couple of nickels to play seven songs on the jukebox.   Conway Twitty, Pasty Cline, Loretta Lynn and other country music greats were always on the play list.   

Those, of course, were my parent's favorite artists and I liked them through training.  I still enjoy the country classics and always will.

I came into my own musical tastes during the early seventies.   We were at the laundromat and ""Witchy Woman"" started playing on the radio.  The music was country enough that my mom liked it and agreed to buy me the 8-track cassette by The Eagles.    From there I branched out into other soft rock and eventually discovered harder sounds by The Doors, Black Sabbath, Nazareth and more.

When Kiss hit the scene I was immediately hooked.  Although the music wasn't complex the energy and theatrics were just what I was looking for.   I joined the Kiss Army with full knowledge that it would drive my parents crazy.  

As embarrassing as it is today, I admit that my first favorite band was Kiss."

"event","My intuition was correct.  I KNEW the whole audition prospect with The Verdict was too good to be true.  Courtney told me that the lead singer wasn't interested in making music anymore and was planning on moving to Charleston where his G/F was.  I, really, cannot understand how someone can give up a life of music to ""settle down"" at such a young age.  From what I've heard, the band was doing incredibly well and had a very BRIGHT future ahead of them!  This makes me incredibly angry.  I would give anything to be in the shape that they are(were) in.  I mean, I know I have talent.  But I also know that there are many others out there who are much more gifted than I am.  This is understood.  I really need to not think about these things.  I've got to get things done myself.  There can be no room for self-doubt.  I'm very sure that I can accomplish much more than I think I can.  I mean...if I don't live this ""life of music,"" then what life do I have?  Everything I've done up to this point in my life has been the majority of music.  For me to just ""give up?""  Well...uhh.  I really wouldn't have anything left.  Without music, I'm just a living shell devoid of any rhyme or reason.  For those who gave up on music either gave up due to old age, a physical ailment, or simply in vain.  I will only continue to get better, so why stop now?  I've done alot of stupid things in my past, that's given.  But quitting now would just be another one of those ""stupid things.""  Speaking of stupid things, I finally stopped talking to Elle.  In case some of you have forgotten, she has become quite a bit of the ""anchor"" in my life.  The fact that she'd been around for so long was the only reason I had been keeping her in my life.  Oh we had our past, yes.  A complete past of bullshit that I kept on putting up with.  The bottom line is that both of us are COMPLETELY different and I just wouldn't let it go.  Some people just aren't meant to communicate with each other.  Which is why I'm adding her to one of those ""stupid things"" in the past.

I work myself up over everything BUT the important things.  I'm over-indulgent.  And I blame myself for how under the table I've become.  Yes, I know these are all statements.

I know, it's daring, especially since there's no base pay.  But I've suprisingly made an assload lately.  Sure it can be slow sometimes, where I won't make any money in a day.  But then I'll make like $300 in a day and basically make up for some slow days.  It fluctuates, but overall it's a kickass job when you know what you're doing.  Oh, and I also have a new place near UNCC.  It's an actual house and it's nice and big : ).  Plus I can actual walk to class and save on gas..which is great considering gas kicks my budget's ass.  But yeah, I'm gonna cut this short, work is over and I'm heading out.  Cya"

"event","Yes, I know.  Long fucking time, huh?  Alot has been going on which has kinda distracted me from this whole journal deal(i.e.school, work, vacation, and other stupid things...wait, vacations aren't stupid..except that).  Alot of stuff musicwise has been going on.  I'm finally getting on my feet and getting myself known in this damned Charlotte area.  Still working on the whole band deal, but being very patient in the process..'cause it's gotta be perfect this time.  Music has been huge for me lately, I've been listening to alot of new/old shit.  Well, pretty much everything.  Old Piebald has been in my cd player for the past week.  If you haven't checked this band out, you really should.  Before this whole wave of emo-ness came along, they had their feet already cemented in the early foundations of it.  Sure, I like some emo, but this band is raw and grungy and I liiiike it : ).  Don't get me wrong, though.  I don't stay stuck in one genre, I keep my horizons open.  I mean, damn, I've been listening to Monaco lately.  I have a hidden love for cheesy 80's hits.  Sorry, music talk is over for now.  


On a kickass note, the day before yesterday I arrived back from Mexico with my family.  It was seriously the most amazing trip I've ever been on.  I really want to go back sometime soon.  Everything there was cheap and the food there was nothing short of Delicious.  Who would've thought that I would have my most tasty Italian meal in Mexico, lol.  We stayed at 5 different resorts, 2 of which were shoreside.  The towns we stayed in included Chichinitsa(sp?) Tulum, Cancun, and a couple other funky names.  Saw some of the most kickass sunsets which played amazing light shows at night.  Saw alot of Mayan ruins, learned alot about their history, and saw alot of wacky lizards everywhere.  Never before have I used the restroom and had a gecko land on my HEAD.  Yeah, I freaked out, it was funny.  Went to Cancun.  I don't want to make this too long, but just to let you know, I have alot to say about Cancun.  Crystal clear water, beautiful people, great food, great views, great weather, great DRINKS(which were in excess), room fucking service all the damned time...all this= a great way to cap off my trip.  We stayed in Cancun the last couple nights, then left for the airport at 4:30 in the morning.  Ended up leaving on American Airlines at 6:45 arriving in Dallas, TX a couple hours later, then taking another plane to charlotte for another couple hours.  Don't think I'll ever have a better vacation than this one.  


So yeah, I've updated a little.  Lets see if I'll keep it up."

Heather and I have been dating over a month.  The only thing is, I feel like I'm at the same point I was with her when I first met her.  I mean, we see each other alot...and she's so good to me and everything but I just don't find myself waking up in the morning and having her on my mind first thing...I have her on my mind once she calls me or I call her.  It all feels stale, but I don't know what to do.  She has very strong feelings for me but I feel like shit that I can't match hers.  I don't want to hurt her in any way, I have a really, really big heart.  Everyone tells me it's a good thing, but I fucking hate it.  I wish I could be an asshole and have no remorse.  It'd make alot of things easier for me.  I really don't know what to do.  I feel like a dick, but I can't fucking help it."

"event","Well, a little update on things.  I've been going to UNCC for about 3 weeks now, classes are going great.  I've met alot of very cool people here, and alot of them I already know.  So overall, my transition was awesome.  On a much more negative side, last Friday, January 21st, my best friend/our drummer Devin Knupp(17), was killed in a car wreck along with his cousin Bronson Layman(20).  Bronson was driving at night, going about 80 on some unknown roads when they came up on a sharp left turn...he tried to overcompensate for the turn, and ended up swerving into the left lane colliding head-on with an SUV(Bronson was driving a Mazda MR-2).  And, of course, they weren't wearing seatbelts.  There was a mother and kid in the other car.  The kid is fine, but the mother had to be hospitalized, but she will okay.  But the damage is done.

I've never had anyone this close to me pass away.  It hurts in alot of ways, but it also confuses me soo much.  It's almost like my brain refuses to accept the fact that he's gone...so every day, I keep on believing it's a lie.  It was NOT supposed to happen, the kid was only SEVENTEEN.  He was BASICALLY my little brother, we've gone through a whole lot.  He was such a mature kid for his age, Zach and I always hung out with him.  I don't know, this whole past weekend has been the longest weekend EVER.  I'm trying to forget and not forget at the same time.  They were just desensitized, being young kids, to the fragility of life.  It's such a damn shame.  Anyway, I hope everyone's been okay.  I do ask one thing of you guys.  I just wish that everyone will make it their goal to take care of themselves and not be careless.  You really never know when it's your turn...

At the same time, I'm withering away.  As the days go by, I keep seeing how things are getting better and better with her and him.  I'm happy for her, but...it hurts still.

Anyway, I'm gonna go.  See ya guys."

She plays bass in one of our local friendly/rivaling bands Sugar Glyder, and we'll be playing some shows with them pretty soon.

We really wanna see how he does live, so very SOON we'll find out!

It's been a long year 
Since you've been gone 
I've been alone here 
I've grown old 
I fall to pieces, I'm falling 
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling 

Every time I'm falling down 
All alone I fall to pieces 

I keep a journal of memories 
I'm feeling lonely, I can't breathe 
I fall to pieces, I'm falling 
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling 

All the years I've tried 
With more to go 
Will the memories die 
I'm waiting 
Will I find you 
Can I find you 
We're falling down 
I'm falling

I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away 
I keep your photograph and I know it serves me well 
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain 

'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome 
And I don't feel right when you're gone away 

You've gone away, you don't feel me, anymore 

The worst is over now and we can breathe again 
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away 
There's so much left to learn, and no one left to fight 
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain 

'Cause I'm broken when I'm open 
And I don't feel like I am strong enough 
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome 
And I don't feel right when you're gone away 

'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome 
And I don't feel right when you're gone away 

You've gone away 
You don't feel me here anymore 


i love you. and i wanted you to know that i miss you - more than you can comprehend i'm positive. i can't stand being without you. a year is far too long for 2 people who have a single beating heart to be apart. we've always been meant to be - always been one person in two bodies. you're my other half - i can't live without you. please don't make me wait much longer. it hurts so bad to try and breathe when you're nowhere near to remind me theres a reason. i do love you. never forget it. my baby, my love, my heart and soul. forever.

One broken seam
Drifts within a stream
Of tears that fell down
Past a sky of frowns
And what was before
Something she ignored
But as the ground wore deep
That one thing incomplete

But I dont mind, it eventually fades
And everything surrounds her like the tears on her face
I have grown older and I understand
So never again will I leave open hands

Thoughts of old years 
When a comfort was near
And the worry was gone
In such a filled home
Things in the present
Keep her in abscence
As the eyes fill up
Some things are enough

I dont mind, it eventually fades
And everything surrounds her like the tears on her face
I have grown older and I understand
So never again will I live open hands

I hadn't really planned on looking for jobs now...all I wanted to do was get this court shit I have going on out of the way so I can make my way to Missouri...now things have pretty much dissipated between me and Elle.  She acts totally different towards me.  Heh, and the funny thing is, she hasn't changed as a person....just how she acts towards me has changed.  She told me she's maturing, so she's going to be something I don't like?  Has she forgotten how much of an open mind I have?  And then I find out that she did a line(s) of coke the other day....never thought she'd do that, not saying it's the worst thing, but I keep finding something different about her everytime I talk to her.  I'm scared to check up on this livejournal thing anymore...because it never fails, whenever I do, I read something that she posts that makes me sick to my stomach.  I mean, I really love this girl...I always have, and yeah it's fucking hard, but I'm much stronger than most people would be in this situation.  I told her I'd never give up on her...and I won't.  And it takes alot for me to muster up any faith at all...but I get by somehow.  But it just feels like it has slipped her mind how much she really, truly means to me.  I try and be there for her whenever I can...now I just feel limited.  I don't know what I can say or do without making her feel uncomfortable.  And the funny thing is, these stages have come and gone.  This has happened before.  But we always pull through.  Now...I just don't know.  I have a dead and sick feeling in my stomach.

They were fucking amazing...the most amazing metal band I've seen...EVER!  Their new singer is great, and so is their new cd, which you MUST get!  I have the whole cd on my comp, so if anyone wants it, I'll serve it up, yo.  Yeaaaa buddy!  I'm actually rather bored right now, it's a fucking Saturday and no one is around.  I want something to doooo!  Haha, I have no friends. :(  It's sad.  lol  Someone hang out with me or somethinggg.  I'm off to find something to do.  Maybe your mom."

"event","Well, I lost my job last Friday, which is pretty gay.  But on a lighter note, I got my job back at Dairy Queen!  Hey, it's $$, I don't give a shit.  Over the past week or two I've been talking to Elle alot more than usual which is a big plus.  I still miss her like hell...talking to her brings back all the good memories.  She wants me to come visit her, and we've been talking about possibly rooming together...the idea is totally badass, but automatically, my stimulus kicks in...I'm scared of what will happen.  I'm so scared because I wouldn't know what to expect.  I'm still on the defense, but I still want to be with her...and yeah, at least I have the balls to say it in my lj entry UNLIKE some people. Pfft.  Fuckin wimps.  Some people just have problems letting other people know who they want to spend the rest of their life with.  -shrugs-  Anywho.  This bringing up another factor.  I just don't know what she thinks anymore.  She'll tell me one thing, then remind of it again a few weeks later....I mean, that does mean something to me..but it hasn't been enough.  I mean, am I weird for thinking that way?  I doubt it, I really hope some people agree with me.  I mean, I know she has a problem letting people know how she feels about me, because I bet you anything no one she knows or talks to knows about how she ""feels"" about me.  Anyway, I'm not gonna make a big deal about it, this is just one of the reasons why I'm so edgy...it's a normal reaction.  I'm a regular human being with real feelings.  So she loves me.  If words were everything, then I'd be happy.  But they aren't.  And I don't know what to expect.  And I don't know how to think.  I can't just ""believe.""  Reinforcement is ALWAYS needed...with some people, reassurance helps.  With me, in the situation I'm in, reassurance is REQUIRED.  Like, ALOT. LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOADS AND LOADS of...stuff...you get the idea...or do you?...you don't?...fuck you, assmunch.  I'm normal."

"event","Talked with Elle today.  Had an expected outcome of the convo..and it came true.  I'm not gonna work myself up over it anymore.  If she wants to talk to me again, she can.  All I know is I'm not making the effort anymore.  And if she wants to talk to me, I'm not gonna fight about shit anymore.  She HATES the fact that I talk to any chick that I've ever ""done"" something with, whether it be making out, or whatever.  But you know what?  Awhile ago, I was in her same shoes.  I hated the fact that she still talked to David, or Tommy, or James, or whoever else.  It bothered me, VERY bad.  But I got over it...because I don't want to interfere with her life at all.  Michelle, for instance, is a really cool friend of mine.  We had a bad history in the past because of the whole Elle thing, I'm sure most of you know.  I'm past that...she's a really good friend to me...but of course, Elle can't have that.  She keeps telling me that I like her more than a friend and all this bullshit.  Fuck that, I'm not even gonna get caught up in that.  You either take what I say, or leave it.  I told you there's nothing with her. God.  Anyway.  She tells me that I should make sacrifices like that.  Just tell her(Michelle) fuck you, and totally ditch her as a friend.  God, don't you just love her point of view?  It makes me smile...well, it would be a smile if I was hanging upside down.  But, again, I totally know where she comes from, because I was the same way.  I just grew up, sucked it in, and accepted it.  She hates the part of the female race that LAYS EYES UPON ME!  God, man.  I'm so sorry.  I know this isn't the end of anything...but if she wants to talk to me, she's just gonna have to go through the effort of saying ""hey"" to me or something.  Whatever.  There's only so much I can do.  She's not gonna make me give up my friends for her, that's not how a relationship is.  And if she thinks that it's worth it, so be it.  

Anyway, went to Breaking Benjamin tonight, hung out with the band, gave them our band's demo, they were gonna check it out and all :).  Got one of the drummer's drumsticks signed by the whole band, so that was pretty kickass!  Other than that I'm pretty poofed for the night.  Especially since I saw Thrice the other night!!  And that kicked ALOT of ass, too.  Poison the Well rocked, too.  But Vaux sucked, and i didn't get to see Moments in Grace.  Oh well.  They're still good, though.  www.momentsingrace.com

So I'm out for the night.  Yess. Feels good to get shit off of my chest by typing it.  Now I feel better n stuff.  K.  Goin to look for jobs again tomorrow.  G'nite everyone."

I know that you'll never forgive me for this and I don't expect you to, but before I go any further I want you to know that I'm sorry for any pain I've caused or am going to cause and that I'm sorry for ever becoming involved in your life. I've made the decision that I can't talk to you anymore, you shouldn't move down here and yes, you were right, I can't leave david. He's too important to me. He's the only one he's wever REALLY loved me. He's the only one who's ever REALLY been there for me. HE's worth more to me than anything else in this entire world. He's my everything and more. There's never been anyone more perfect for me. He's all I could ever REALLY ask for.  Not too much, but not oo little. He's perfect. What we did while you were down here was a mistake. That should have NEVER happened. It never will again. I'm sorry for ever leading you to think that the things I said about you moving here, me leaving david, or anything else, were true. I said most of that out of anger, hate, pain, sadness and desperation. I'm fucked up. I should have never asked you to come here in the first place. I'm glad we finally got the chance to meet.. I don't regret meeting you, I just wish things wouldn't have happened how they did. We could have never been more than friends anyway, and now I've ruined that too. I know things will never be the same, but Davi'ds too important to me to lose him and I'm going to if I don't straighten up and get my priorities straight. I've got to gain his trust back, I've got to gain his love and respect back, I've got to start from ground zero and try all over again. I fucked up. Until I can get things straight again, ... we just can't talk anymore. Please try and forget I even exist. Good-bye
 
I told you you'd eventually find out how terrible I really am and wish you'd never have met me. I'm sorry for not leaving you alone in the first place.

I'd love to hear of it -smirks-.  It's very soon, though.  Elle has no more patient, so it's kinda hard talking to her about it anymore.  All I have right now is to just talk out this abyss.  The reason I call it an abyss is because all I know of on livejournal is Elle..and a few other of her friends.  But I know she and they would never care to listen to my pointless stories.  Well my mood right now has swayed from happy/sad to sad.  Fuck me.  I'm going through so much right now, that I can't keep up with myself.

I wish someone would understand.  But no one does...except my friends, who don't agree with me going down there.  But now they support me, for some reason.  It's all a fucking weird story.  I know Elle loves me, but she doesn't have any faith in me now........and it hurts to not have my true love's backup.  But it's been all my fault.  So i really shouldn't be complaining...but I am.  Because I have nothing else to do.  I'm so fucked up.  And I'm sorry for the pain I've caused, Elle.

"event","Today was actually pretty awesome...even though I had my piano jury exam today which I sucked ASS at.  Went to a kickass concert and saw Counting the Stars, Recover, From Autumn To Ashes, and Taking Back Sunday.  Oh helll yeah, the ganja is callin' my name tonight, too!  My buddy Jacob just invited me to smoke some dank he got from Georgia...fuck yeah!  That was just like a few moments ago...my night just keeps getting better. :D  There is one thing bad about today...Elle's sick..I really hope she'll get better soon.....I wish I could be there to comfort her in a time like this.  Now I'm hearing that David and her got in a fight....GOD, I HATE how he fucking treats her...the guy has to snoop around in her email all the time because he can't fuckin trust her!  That's rather shitty.  But no matter what happens, they always seem to settle things between each other.  God, the guy is lucky enough to have a chance with her in the first place...how can you blow something like that??  That fuckin confuses the hell out of me.  I just hope he realizes very soon that he's not good enough for her...

Can't wait to get my car back...but for now, I'm out."

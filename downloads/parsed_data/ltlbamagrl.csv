"event","Another amazing day.  Didn't get started til 2, but man.....
2 words. boats and beer. 
me and della cruisin around the lake, every now and then stoppin-- she laid out on the front, i laid out on the back. 
i tell you what.  nothin beats comin home. 
I don't think anyone enjoys it as much as I do.  
This entire weekend was one long vacation.  I played the entire time.  
I dined outside tonight. It wasn't hot, it wasn't humid, no mosquitos... good music, mom and dad.. the boys. gosh...
i know i keep sayin, but seriously
its like I'm on e all the time, I just love everything.
And then tomorrow comes and reality sets back in.
I have to go and train and do paperwork for Gold's and my internship runs til 7. ughhhhhh.
yeah, so anyway. i watched ""In Good Company"" with libs and the fam tonight.. although I should just say the fam, because she is the fam too really. 
Sad movie.... funny, but sad.  

Anyway, Adam told me I could go down to Sharkys and drink for free with him tonight and watch Family Guy....... and i DIDNT GO!!! So you know this puppys tired. so time to crash."

called libby immediately. 
and was out on the lake by 1:30-  not too bad.  
we rode around all day. had a picnic on sandy beach.  i learned to drive the boat, and me and libby took off for about an hour.  
and we took the boat out at about 7:30- and yes, i have a pretty painful sunburn already

anyhow, we got out of the lake, came back to the house, ordered bellacinos, ate at her house... showered and went out to 5 pts tonight.
it was a great day. kind of a weird night.  i had an awesome time, granted i was really really tired from today. but. i realized how much different i am when im at home, and when im at school.  i miss my friends at school.
its tough going back and forth.
there was a lot of tension between me and libs tonight. and i think it was obvious. when i got out of the car to leave she asked me, ""so you think youll settle in the north or the south kat??""
of course i dont know that answer... but the fact that she asked that.well... i dont know.  people are just so different in the south and in the nort.  and to be completely honest im proud of where im from. i love where im from, but i love where i go to school.  
i dunno, it was just a weird night, with a lot of tension in the car ride home.  

i miss you girls. hope all is well in ct."

"event","A lot has happened since I last scribbled-  Try to keep up.  I'll write a ton prob- unless I get tired of typing, definite possibility.

Anyway, I started my internship at WIS.  It's good, pretty nerve racking. You really don't have time to waste, so thats good. 
So I'm answering the phones.  Which doesn't sound like a big deal, but viewers call in with story ideas. And theres a chance that this is urgent information.
Like today, I got a call, answer ""News 10, this is Katrina""
The woman tells me that she may have a story tip:
Police have been told to remain inside Columbia Research Park (huge medical bldg) and police are surrounding it.
So obviously I tell the assignment desk editor.  He pages the Lt. and its a bank robbery.
So you're really on the front lines.  The assignment desk is the crutch of the entire station. 

Thats just one thing I do.  Or have done.  I just so started so I haven't done half of what I will be doing.  I'm trying to learn the software they use for the newsroom.  Thats tough.  So confusing.
The people are good though.  Reporters, anchors, producers, photogs, production- everyone.  I love it!

Onto other business. I went to a movie and Waffle House (YESSSSS) with libby tuesday night. And there was this woman behind me crying.  When libby and i got up to leave, she was still crying....  She was obviously waiting on someone.  So Libby went over to her and asked her if she needed a ride.  I followed.  The woman was going home, about 2 hrs away...  The guy she was with was beating her.  The guy that was supposed to pick her up was real late.  So I gave her my phone to call him... She didn't have anything-  just a plastic bag with some clothes in it.  The number she dialed wouldn't go through.  I felt so bad.  So I gave her the 10 bucks I had on me, we left lib's number.... because its local.  and told her to call if she needed to.
rough stuff.

So i got to thinkin last night.  After this happened. 
I'm so focused on school and summer, and its like you forget about everyone else.  Life isn't just about going along, and learning about quantitative research methods in communication or cramming for a final the night before...  
Really.  I think I forgot that. 
Not everybody has it so easy.
Its about caring for others, and knowing when someone needs your help.
That $10 was the best $10 I've spent in so long.  Because she needed it.  And I didn't.

So I'm working tomorrow night at the Zoo, bartending, haaaaaaaaaa.  
And then Friday I volunteered to cater- They're opening the zoo at night for free, for terminally ill kids.  And Gwen asked me to cater, so I will."

Lots of little good stories.  
I picked up my dad at the airport, at 8:30 Saturday night.  We drove all night, straight through!  I slept 10 minutes the entire night.  
I've never stayed up literally, all night-  I love sleep too much.
And I just want to let you know. I HATE PENNSLYVANIA and I HATE  Virginia!!!!!!!!  Those are the most miserably, longest states ever! EW!  I stayed up so I could talk to Dad all night, and at some point in the night our conversation was pretty dillusional.  
Not uncommon from my typical conversations, but made no sense at all.
Anyway, we made it home.  And yesterday was amazing.  The lake was full-  everyone was out.  I took a 2 hr nap. Then I headed to Best Buy.
It's sooooooooo hot here!

I feel like I'm on vacation 24/7.  The benefits of going to a school a thousand miles away.  Going home is complete euphoria. 
My dogs, Ben and Coop are awesome.  So good to see them.  My Mom.  Libbetha. Even neighbors. Its like being on E, you love everything.  Not that I would know what thats like..........

So its Memorial Day and the rain is movin in.  So me and teh mom are going shoppin, southern style.

home is amazing.  the weather is amazing.  cookouts and lake all summer.  internship starts tomorrow.

everything is packed up, just gotta load it in the car. 
It's amazing how much can happen in a week. Really.. This time last Saturday I was still in class, still had that quiz thing, and my final-- yeah, the one that almost killed me.  Literally.
And in the last few days, I've done a ton, but at the same time, not so much.
Summers finally here.
FINALLY.

I'm super psyched to get home and see my bestest graduate della- but i don't wanna leave britt here. I wouldn't say it to her (sorry britt) but this summer is gonna be a rough one for her...  In more ways than one.
So I'm kinda sad.. On a higher note, lauren visited yesterday- and that was really nice. 
Sorry, this is kind of, boring.  I'm tired. I can't talk, my voice is gone. 

My Dad's leaving for the airport soon. I'll pick him up at bradley, and be on my way- HOME, sweet home.
to see my boys ben and coop- and my amazing mom. and the best friend a girl could have.
what a FREAKIN sap.

ughhhhh
ok, enough of that gushy gush stuff.
onto my latest idea::::  wait.......... wait for it, hahaha/

HOW TO SOLVE OBESITY IN AMERICA.
make everyone take their pictures for their liscense. NAKID.
yep, thats right.  the average size for a woman would no longer be 14 here in the states.  i guarantee it.
because when the cop pulls you over, and is on his way to writing you a 6 point ticket for going 30 over... That pretty much seals the deal.  You're getting a ticket if you're fat. Because theres no way Supertrooper is gonna want anything you have. So favors are outta the question.
There in lies my solution to society's overeating, overindulging whale-like obsession.
welp, lunch time.  Big Mac anyone????"

This weekend was a blast. Chris left yesterday...
We went to a going away thing for Loopy Monday night.. oh geez. I'm not sure what happened, but I do know I was still drunk when I woke up at 8 the next morning.
And I had the spins, bad.

Many, many shots of vodka and limejuice.. whoa. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
""Thats disgustingggggg, what were you thinking???""

It's pretty simple. I wasn't. I think britt told me at one point I wanted to mix malibu and sky, which makes my stomach turn 5 times just thinking about it.
Anyway, needless to say, yesterday was really, really miserable. And today, I'm still pretty gross feeling. So a 2-day hangover.

I definitely rolled out of bed, and just went to class. It took me a couple of minutes just to get settled, and when I started writing I got dizzy.
Meghan, one of my friends in my class told me she had never seen me like that. haha.  And I came up with a great idea. 
You know those donuts that you put on your car when your tire pops? I wish we had another head, that we kept in storage, and we could use it, like a donut, temporarily of course, while our primary head recovered- good idea, huh?

Back to my day. 
I didn't even make it to class on time, I missed an entire hypothesis test, and of course it was the most detailed one we learned since the midterm.
niceeeeee

So today we had a quiz thing, on 2 different tests we learned.
I won't explain how difficult this is, but literally.... and I've never, ever been like this.
When he handed me the paper I couldn't stop visibily stop shaking for the first 10 minutes.
I wanted to break down and cry right there. This CLASS IS MISERABLE.
And I was hung over and totally not there on one of the most important days, of the ""semester""

So now its time for a little ""kat"" nap, before I cram for the worst final ever.

The ""up"" is: Summer is ONE day away!"

Last few days in the big CT, and when I get back, I'm 21. I'm a senior, living in Hilltop Apartments, with my 3 bestest friends....
minus Lauren of course. 
But she'll definitely be snuggling with us a lotttt! 
ha!
Theme parties once a month.  Should be a seriously interesting year, given the current status of a couple of the roommates. I CAN't WAIT. 
But before fall comes, I'm gonna enjoy my last summer.

wow........... 11 months til LIFE britt. whoageez, slow down.
So I will be taking advantage of this right of passage we all hold fast to, if only for a brief period of time---- known as, college apathy. 

So onto even better items, that should be addressed:

As some of you know, those who matter that is, this weekend should be amazing, definitely ready.  Weekend meaning, Saturday until Tuesday. And I can't stopppp smiling!!!!!!
And that's all I'll say. 

This journal is not something I'm going to use to disclose anything that goes beyond daily routines, and that out of the ordinary.
Because the purpose of the journal is so that a few of my favorite girls can keep up with me while I'm a thousand miles away for a couple of months.
And if you know me, you know why- because my life has been a merry-go-round since January.
But not anymore girls. Not after Saturday.

This is it. No more. 


All I have to say is, I did it,
I had my cake, and I ATE IT TOO!

"event","i have encountered today, many people, 
and all of which i hold different feelings toward, or for??

for example:
to start my day, i woke up, not because of an alarm, but because of the stupid janitors washing and waxing the floor in our building. 
i'm partially asleep, so naturally i'm pretty upset. and i can't fully comprehend whats going on... all i know is there are 2 people, mexicans, in my hall YELLING at each other, and obnoxiously laughing at 10 in the morning, way too early.  

I let it go for about 10 minutes, but they keep going soooo, I hit the wall, and yell ""SHUT UP"" as loud as i can.  They fall silent.
*They start up 15 minutes later*
So I finally get out of bed, and find the worst, most annoying music that they definitely don't wanna hear, and I blast it. 
I thought Beach Boys was a sufficient pick. and put the speakers and subwoofer right next to the wall, that they're on the other side of. 
My thought process: 
if they can't talk over the music, or they hate the music they'll clean the FING floor and the the heck out.

Well ladies, it worked. haaaaaaa
Genius I know-

Next, Britt comes in - I get excited, we talk, we eat lunch. It's nice, and I enjoy the conversation. 

I go to class.
And it gets better. 
The only dude in our group is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DUMB. Waste of life. I don't think I've ever felt that way about someone so much in my life.
He just breathes.

He didn't come to class yesterday, so he misses 2 units, which is a ton. and we're doing a  group excercise on what we learned the previous day, and he's telling me and meghan that we're wrong.
YOU WEREN""T HERE YOU MORON, WE WERE. 
And please don't even start to tell me about sweeps months, and promos--- I may set you on fire, thats MY MAJOR. 
He can't talk, he has the thickest new york accent, and like..... hes just dumb. 
He's post football, now hes just fat. A pretty miserable combination.
yeahhhh.

so then i get back from class, and i talk to a guy friend online, dave. and then i wonder why i can have such amazingly awesome guy friends, but i somehow manage to screw myself over when picking guys.
how does that work?
seriously, any advice?????

So a wide range of emotions toward other people today. hahaha. Maybe I sound really pissed, but I'm not. It's actually quite comical."

so on top of being this closet dork that i have become... thus my obsession with reading, and more than just reading, but owning superfluous amounts of books...

I am now a closet freak. well, maybe I'm not closet, depends on who you ask... but anyway, here's the story.

I was sending and receiving texts to a certain someone.
Who I have decided will remain anonymous, we'll call them, 
(hmmmmm....... trying to think of a unisexual name)
ok. Taylor.

So Taylor texts me yesterday with a pretty explicit question.
me, being....... well, me. Texts back, playing along..
Now here's the setting. I'm in the apartment, doing nothing..
And Taylor's at the Phillies game with friends, of both sex.
When Taylor receives this message, a friend peeks over Taylor's shoulder and reads this little note----- and ""dies"" according to Taylor..... probably thinking I'm the biggest WEIRDO, outrageous being ever. 
Because let's be honest...........
If you know me, and you know the people I live with, or plan to live with.  Even better, if you've ever been exposed to this group, the kind of conversation we enage in... is typically. well, normal to us, but i would say, could be read by an average person as-- how do you say??? a little eccentric, a little grotesque, and oddly commonplace.

So, yeah.. you can only imagine what was sent.

All I can do is hope I never meet this friend.... 

On a side note, I just realized today, while I was suffering through a 3-hour long lecture on research study methods and content analysis' that I will be home for Memorial Day, and I think that just made my entire next 2 weeks, bearable.
Because this year is the first year the lake level has been up enough so boats or jet skis can be put, and driven on the lake without the water being too shallow.

I got 4, count em, FOUR new books!
The Secret Life of Bees
Ya Yas in Bloom
The Saving Graces
andddd.
The Mermaid Chair.

I just want to note that the author of The Secret Life of Bees, and The Mermaid Chair is from Charleston, SC. Which is no surprise when everyone tells me what a great book the former is, and how I really need to read it. She's a southern belle, what do you expect?

So it's a Saturday night and I'm about to curl up with my first read. Ya Yas. And I'm way too excited!

nice.

so yeah- we got through one page of slides....

a summer of boating, sun, some work when i have to, interning at the best news station in columbia, and wakeboarding til i cant anymore

did i mention i get to spend it all with my best friend too???!

on that note, time for a nap"

"event","It was a cry-fest in 252 today.  Wow, I wasn't expecting it.  Abear's leaving tomorrow morning, and she's the one first one.  Amy goes Friday, and Britt leaves for a week- then she's back.  Thank God.
It'd probably be the longest month of my life if they were all leaving.
yeah, yeah, yeah.

I hate getting all mushy. I don't do that. I get mad, ha, yeah, more often than maybe I should.  But when I get upset, ewww.   


I get a lot of crap when I go home for turning into this ""yankee"", whatever.  I'm not even sure what it is.  To me it screams ignorance... but, its funny to listen to people at home tell me how i'm so terrible because i didn't come back to USC. Can I just tell you how glad I am I didn't go back???! Yeah, I wish I could go home whenever I wanted, for the weeekend... But GOD, I wonder who I would be if I hadn't stayed in Connecticut. 
People at home look at me like, what were you thinking???  And I laugh... I want to yell, ""ARE YOU KIDDING?! USC BLOWS, wait, all in state schools do"" Storrs isn't the greatest, but my friends in Storrs are.

Its funny how southerner's hate the North, but northerners laugh at us. 
Blah blah blah.  I love where I'm from, home is home, no matter where you're from. And no matter where you go, you always remember where you're from.  But I really think if I had stayed at Carolina I would have been absolutely miserable...  And if you know me, you know why.  I probably wouldn't have moved on with my life, at least for the moment. 

I want to go home so much, but.....  to be completely honest.  Home is depressing.  Everyone's the same.  Home is here now..  I'm not sure how I feel about that, but this is where I am most of the year.   
And this is where I'm happy.  wow..... never thought I'd say that-

OK< ENOUGH GUSH.  I have 2 hrs of the OC waiting on me.
PEACE OUT MOTHA"

"event","I think it's just one of those weeks everyone wishes was over.  I'm in the midst of finals, still have three more.  
And I'm not even excited that I'll be done.  I finish Saturday morning, and I start Research Methods (the worst class ever in COMMS) monday at 1.
hoorah

Overall the school year has been amazing. 
I've been pretty stressed the last couple of weeks, ha.  That's an understatement I guess. The other day I really needed to study, but I was a in a foul mood, and the only thing that cheered me up was packing, so thats what I did.

I'm going to miss a lot of people when I go home for the summer, but I can't wait to get home. a little more than 3 weeks!!!!


Greatest lesson learned this year: just laugh.
He who laughs, lasts."

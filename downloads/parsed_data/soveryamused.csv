"event","I think yes.  I just returned from an amazing five day river rafting trip on the deschuttes river.  I learned how to guide and I might take guiding as a summer job next year.  dum dee dum.  The trip was amazing, I went with LEAD and they are such a family of friends.  It was incredible, no drama, just enjoyment and laughter.  Oh and the day before I left Talon kissed me... we'll see how that works out, it would be nice if it did work out.  LEAD invited me to go on the tuesday group as well, but COUNTRY FAIR.  Oh man I'm excited.  I'm going to Talon's barbecue tonight, I haven't seen him since sunday night.  I feel like a little girl, this is different.  And so life goes."

"event","My life is being almost too amazing.  Last night was summer solstice and the full moon.  But no, that is not enough.  I had an awesome time just hanging out at this party and was one of the last to leave.  It was a small relaxed party where you actually talk to people, my favorite.  So I was about to walk home and I'm just talking with the host when he mentions that he is unusually comfortable around me, which surprised me because it felt as though he wasn't even that comfortable around me.  At any rate some how the conversation led to him awkwardly asking for a massage, so of course I give him one.  He is uptight and won't relax and we are just conversing as I try and coax him to relax a bit.  As the night wore on he slowly grew more and more comfortable and relaxed and we made an incredible connection.  We spent 5 hours, just the two of us, messaging and cuddling and talking.  AND THAT'S ALL!!!  It was incredible, there was no attempt to kiss, no sexual energy, just complete comfort. That's what he kept repeating too, ""I've never felt this comfortable around anyone"", ""you are an incredibly comfortable person"", over and over again he would say the word comfort.  Comfort would be the theme of the night, indescribable comfort."

"event","So this past weekend was not only my Birthday, but it was the rugby Pacific Coast Territorial Tournament.  Which means the Loggers (Oregon-Washington select side team), which I am on, played the Griffens (California select side team).  We arrived on Friday (my birthday) and that night that the coach (who is a scout for the national team) had selected me to be the Captain of the Loggers.  Saturday we did some scrimmaging and I did not play my best because I was feeling insecure and our team was not playing individually because we had never played together before.  That night the coaches gave us a pep talk on what we could do better.  I also talked to the coach separately and she told me that she chose me as captain because in the All-Star game I was intimidating and a threat.  On Saturday I was not a threat and she wanted me to regain that intimidation factor on Sunday for the championship game.

Sunday I was in awe.  We played the most beautiful game of Rugby I had ever played.  I completely stepped up my game, I did everything the coaches suggested and more.   I poached the ball again and again. I got to play 8-Man the whole game and we did some amazing back row plays.  Our team played flawlessly together, it seemed as though we were reading each others minds. I was completely honored to be playing with every single person on my team.

At the awards ceremony three awards were given out, best back, best forward, and MVP.  I didn't think I would win any awards.  They announced best back and best forward and began introducing the MVP awards by saying: ""this award we had to split between two players because you could hardly tell the difference between them on the field, in fact they're practically twins"".  At this point my jaw is totally dropped and my whole team is hitting Marie and I.  ""Number 7 and Number 8 from Loggers: Marie Rochat and Maya Rios"".  I just about shit a brick.  That was the perfect end to and amazing weekend.

For those of you who don't know Marie is my evil Rugby twin who is on the National team and has already broken two world records in dead-lifting, to be placed at the same level as her in rugby is very honoring!  It was so perfect!

To top it all off, the coach comes up to me, hands me the team trophy for winning the tournament and says ""congratulations Maya on leading your team to victory"".  At this point I stupidly mumble ""what?"" and she clarifies ""The trophy is yours to take home""

Sorry for just dictating my entire weekend in detail but it was one of the best weekends of my life.  I almost cried and my coach from South Eugene did actually cry.  I was chosen to be captain and all of the players on my team expressed that they loved me as captain and I won Most Valuable Player for the entire west coast with my evil rugby twin, Marie!"

"event","I puked for the first time in my life!! Three times to be precise.  I was at the Folk Live Festival in Seattle and I ate an elephant ear.  I think I got food poisoning.  It was also the first day of my period so at first I thought it was awful cramps, but then the pain got so severe that I cried.  Thats right folks I, Maya Rios, cried from physical pain.  It was pretty intense.  So I called my grandparents to come pick me up (once again showing exactly how much pain I was in) and I was waiting for grandpa at the corner of fifth and Harrison in Seattle.  For those of you who don't know Fifth and Harrison is the corner that the space needle is on and it is 2:30pm and the folk live festival is going on at the Seattle Center, there was a lot of people to say the least.  So there I am waiting on this busy street corner, doubled over from pain, when all of a sudden I find myself projecting vomit.  I threw up forcefully three times and then I heard a round of applause.  I look up to see a tour bus full of people clapping and cheering for me.  I then turn around to see an M&M man stationed at the corner chuckling to himself.  Everyone is staring at me with that look that obviously says ""man, she's that drunk ALREADY?"".  After that I felt much better, though not wholly so.  Oh and I got to hang out on the corner for another 15 min with the M&M man as my companion.

So, what a story for the first time ever puking in your life, I know Cath and Nicole have to be proud!"

so what happens after Maya has been sitting for 40 minutes stressing out and not being able to move from my seat?
That's right, I write poetry about how much I hate AP tests.

and for your amusement:

Nerves... Pound through me
I just can't stop shaking my knee
A years worth of time
Amounts to three hours of stress
Bitter as a lime, I feel like a mess
My brain and my gut have been blended together
As the sound of pens scribbling goes on forever
A single test meant to judge your intellect
Based on the details you've managed to recollect.

The U19 sectionals game was AWESOME.

I also received so many complements, I swear I'm floating.

I don't do anything attention grabbing the way someone who I would characterize as standing out would.

"event","I promise I will get back about all of the other people I love at some point Kara you know I love you like wow so I hope you're not offended I paused at you, in fact you should take it as compliment that I had faith that you would know how much you rock the world.  

So this is me procrastinating, shocker I know.  Three final papers and a physics final tomorrow.  So anyone else ever notice how beautiful boys are?  For some reason recently I have been noticing how beautiful everyone is, maybe it's the weather.

I can't wait till tomorrow evening, I will be done with all finals and I will be at a Decemberists concert.  Then this saturday my HALEY is coming to town, so pumped we are going to have a blast.  On the 23rd DAVI is coming into town as well, and my excitement is needless to say.  Over break I am going to visit LUKE at aprovecho, wow it's only Tuesday, I have to wait till friday to see him again, hooray for peter pan.  Also last weekend of break it looks like I will be going to Seattle for a frisbee tourny, I also have some kids who want me to join the U of O frisbee team which would be a blast.  Also I am going to try and do a coast trip with Haley and Davi however I really don't want to go on Britt's trip as much as I love her the energy will be horrible with all the people going.  My rugby team rules everyone, but we don't have enough players which is a bit of a bummer, but we are kicking major ass.

HOW I LOVE BEING ALIVE"

"event","Josh.  Josh you have amazing energy, you are one of the few people who can empathize with my extrovertedness.  You have been a close friend of my families for a while now.  You have always been there to support us and listen to our bullshit.  You have wonderful wacky ideas and make everyone feel welcome and worthwhile.  I unfortunately have not seen or talked to you in quite a while which makes me have Josh withdrawls from time to time.  I miss your upbeat energy that has a way of infecting areas with positivity and laughter.  I love how you listen as fervently (if not more so) to six-year-olds as you do adults and can bring out the intelligence in everyone around you.  You are an amazing friend who I always know will be there to hug or cry to and you bring so much warmth into peoples heart.  Though most of all I love your ability to play with everyone and anyone with out a stop."

All I can say is ""what does tapioca look like if you put it under a microscope"".  I was a corrupting little bitch and you still shared your jellies with me, that means a lot.  It was also fun coming back to visit to have you now corrupt me.  What happened to innocent Helen?  It's awesome.  But back to why I friggen love you to pieces.  I love you for your power girl.  You have so much energy and drive that when you direct it you are able to achieve what you set out for, it is so amazingly beautiful.  Once you get into something, no matter what it is, you go all the way.  This is true when it comes to friends as well.  Once we became friends I was able to see that you would back up your friends and support them in whatever their endeavors were until the very end.  You are one of those people I would choose to have by my side in a fight, and you would be there.  You might be a third the size of the guys we would fight but you would take them out if it came down to that.  Helen I guess I'm just trying to say that you are awesome and hardcore in every sense of the words.  I really hope you are having a good time all the way across the world and I had better see you soon!"

You just dance to your own tune and your dance is beautiful.  That's all I can say, everything about is beautiful, you are a truly beautiful person.  Your are all around just a good person, you are kind and helpful and loving and give wonderful hugs.  You just bring your own perspective and mindset to any and every situation and have this ability that forces everyone who talks to you to love you.  You are also an amazing listener.  You have not only sat through my rants but I always know you actually hear what I say as though it is worthwhile.  I love you so much Max and I wish I saw more of you, my Max time is definitely way too sporadic."

Well, I would like to.  

Darcy you have the most interesting combination of cockyness and insecurity.  I love you; I honestly can say, always have always will.  You just allow yourself to go with it, doesn't matter what ""it"" is, you go with it.  You encourage others to give in to their own urges as well.  It's so wonderful.  You truly enjoy yourself doing whatever activity you choose to do and are always willing to have others due what suits them.  I have never heard a judgemental word out of your mouth.  You definitely have opinions though and stick to what you believe and care for.  You are also always willing to share your knowledge and opinions with out fear or care of being judged by others.  You have your opinions, other people have theirs, they can live by their opinions and you live by yours.  There are so few people who truly actually are that way.  You are one of them.  Darcy, I could go on all day trying to explain what it is that I like and love and am attracted to about you, though I doubt I could truly put it into words and certaintly could not narrow it down to one aspect of you.  Though I suppose what I am trying to say is one of the things I appreciate about you the most is your off-beat way of being at peace with who you are and who other people are."

I would have to say that what I miss most about you is your smile and your hug.  With your comfort no one could truly doubt themselves.  I have watched and experienced you pulling so many people through their own shit even though you still have your own to deal with.  You are a true friend.  Sometimes I think to myself ""where is Sally, and why is she no longer in my daily life?"".  This of course makes me sad only for long enough for me to remember the many times I have tortured you by sitting on you when you had to pee, and then I just giggle and remember how much bullshit of mine you put up with and in turn how much I love you and your own unique way of appreciating anyone and everyone for who they are.  I love you Sally."

Since sixth grade everytime I see you I am greeted with love and friendship.  You are always there to tell me the truth and make me see what's going on in the world.  You have amazing perspective and always see things as they are, you have kept me in line more times than I can remember.  You were the one who was a friend even when I was a complete bitch.  I love you so much Haley, you are truly a ""cool"" person, because you are kind to everyone and don't put up with bullshit while still remaining calm and not tweaking out on anyone.

Hey we are going to play ""soccer"" in the gym and beat the crap out of each other, wanna come?  And of course she comes and has an amazing time with us (one of the few prosbies to actually converse with us).  I remember after talking with her and getting to know Rose on the prospective student day I wrote the Admin. and told them they had no choice but to admit her.  So luckily for the Admin. Rose came to Conserve school the next year.  Seeing as we now lived together we just bonded more and more as the year went on.  Rose was always game to laugh and rock out with me and put up with my shenanigans whenever I needed a release.  She always greets me with a smile and a hug and was definitely a big factor in keeping me sane for that year in the frigid north.  I miss you so much Rose I can't even describe and it is mandatory that you come visit me, you will love Oregon I promise.  I also definitely have not received my Rose quota recently, so we need to talk more often!"

I played 8-man which is a loose forward and I scored two tris and assisted two others.  I was astonished at how incredibley nice everyone who plays rugby is.  Our team kicked it with the other team after the game and every single person on both teams were just incredible people.  So many people including of course my coach, players on the other team, the ref, and the boys on our boys team gave me some of the best compliments I've ever recieved for a sport.  My friend Luke watched the game and told me afterwards that ""I don't let my body limit myself""  and one of the girls on the other team was talking to one of my teamates and was saying ""one of your girls tackles hard!  I mean it sucks for me, but damn she's awesome!""  and then as I walked by she pointed at me and said ""her, that's the one"".  So yeah I'm just a bit pumped and rugby is the best sport EVER!"

I'm tempted to say that the best part of my week is the half-hour car ride after capture the flag in which I have the most amazing, inspiring conversations with him.  Every time, even though I live about 6 blocks from where we play capture the flag he takes mike home first who lives in springfield so we have this time to converse.  Monk also asked me to write him a recommendation because he wants to get his masters in education and is applying to the U of O.  I suppose that meant a lot to me that he wanted me to write his recommendation."

"event","<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#006600>Is it enough?&nbsp;A question that that keeps rolling through my head (Thanks to the song I am currently listening to). My best-friend and I use to be curious as to what Reid's best friend looked like &lt;Jo, my b.f., and I use to joke that she would catch my&nbsp;bouquet and Reid's b.f. would catch my garder belt and they would fall in love.&gt; So of course we were a little curious, right? Right, but Reid would never let us see what his b.f. looked like. I had two thoughts for that. A.) He wanted to respect his best-friend's privacy or B.) His best-friend was one hot piece of grade-A meat. When Jo and I talked to friends about it later, my friends agreed with B. I have always wanted to believe A because A would mean that Reid has always trusted me. But as time went on, I started to believe my friend's thoughts because if it was A. why didn't just come out&nbsp;and say it, and I bet you're probally thinking why does it matter so much what his friend looks like. Well that part doesn't matter as much. It's the whole thought that he truely never trusted me, from the start of our relationship.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ff6600>(Quick Note: Reid and I have never actually met. We talk via email, messenger,&nbsp;and snail mail. Most don't believe internet relationships count for sh*t, that they're not real.&nbsp;But I do and to me this relationship was as real as the next, that's all that matters. &lt;plus I know of a lot of people who met through net and alot are happily married, some just happily dating&gt; Just f.y.i.)</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#006600>Back to Reid ---&gt; Happy in love, talking all the time, watching Lord of the Rings together, toughin' out Mariners games together. But it was tough, real tough, and only got tougher as time went by. To hold his hand, snuggle up close with him when the nights weren't so frienldy, to get that long awaited first kiss from him. Little things that matter so much, and not getting to experiance them. Promises of finally getting those small things never kept. We were edging close to our three month anniversairy, then something stupid happend. My ex kissed me. I&nbsp;soo did not want that to happen. Why did it then? I ask myself that same question everyday. Truth is I don't know. I do know one thing. There is never any excuse good enough for cheating on some one you love knowing it will hurt them. Only the thing is the more often I think about it, the more I come to the conclusion that I didn't cheat on Reid. Now hold on before you start throughin' the 'kiss is a kiss' deal at me. I mean, do you consider it kissing back if your lips don't move, if there is&nbsp;no feeling behind it. Yeah, it took a few seconds to realize what my sleize of ex was doing before&nbsp;I shoved his sorry ass away, but there was nothing between those seconds of realization and that shove. (One fond memory I won't forget.&nbsp;It's not&nbsp;every day&nbsp;a girl get's to shove her ex flat on his ass,&nbsp;on a concrete floor&nbsp;I might add. That sure felt good). </FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#006600>Okay well my sister-in-law will be home shortly and I want to make sure everything is how it was before she left, maybe even better lol. More on my love another day. Over &amp; Outies.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#006600><STRONG><EM>&nbsp;There's an annoying buzzing in my ear from the locus outside. Meh, oh well lol. I just finished a book that kept me laughing the entire time. Cleaned up house a bit, you know the usual. Dishes, scrubbing the tub, vacuuming, all the while wearing a really short black skirt ;) kidding...I was wearing my favorite bright blue boy-cut bra and panties set lol. It's not often I get the house to myself, so when&nbsp;I do&nbsp;I take advantage of running free in my knickers. I'm currently looking at a really hot baby doll lingerie that's red and black @ </EM></STRONG><A href=""http://www.my-knickers.com/new_lingerie/babydolls/81014_2pc_mesh_embroidered_babydoll.htm""><STRONG><EM>www.my-knickers.com/new_lingerie/babydolls/81014_2pc_mesh_embroidered_babydoll.htm</EM></STRONG></A><STRONG><EM> okay a little to much of my um ... I guess you could just say&nbsp;kinky side lol. Anyways I promised the complicated story of Reid and I. So where did&nbsp;I leave of .... Oh yeah ... Reid is a complete Nerd, but he's my nerd. I loved him for that. Who doesn't love nerds, right? My sister-n-law loves nerds too. I should know. She married my brother. And like my brother, Reid plays a computer game called Counter-Strike. It's all kind of a&nbsp;blur now, but from what I remember&nbsp;I had just turned eighteen (a few weeks early) and I was talking to him online, Reid that is. He wasn't having a great day, Which really kind of sucked because that morning I decided I was going to tell him how I felt about him. He and some of his C.S. clan members were having an argument over an up coming tournament. I knew he was upset, so I asked him if he could remind me&nbsp;later when he was feeling a bit better that I had something I needed to talk to him about. Of course, being that great friend that he is, he assured me that he would. After an hour or so passed he brought it up. Here it was, the moment I had been dreading (dreading in good way, like the&nbsp;I-hope-the-love-of-my-life-doesn't-reject-me kind of dread.) I was going to be sneaky in telling him, to give me back door to well ...&nbsp;back out if&nbsp;I chickened out. I asked Reid if he knew what ""taim&nbsp;i ngra leat"" meant (that being irish for pretty much, I'm in love with you.) knowing perfectly well that even though he's Irish himself that he wasn't &nbsp;fluent in gaelic. Man was I wrong, well at least about him&nbsp;knowing a major phrase like that. Luckily for me, he felt the same way Yippee right. :) I guess with Reid and I in love and all atm back then I'll leave on that note. It's much too happy, and I like It that way. Over &amp; Outies.</EM></STRONG></FONT></P>"

"event","<STRONG><EM><FONT color=#006600>For my loves own privacy I will only refer to him by his last name, Reid. Call it puppy love or call it what you like, but somewhere deep down inside I have always known that Reid and I should be together. We've been the closest of friends since we were sixteen and still are. I fell in love with him when I was seventeen and didn't tell him until I was eighteen. Some of you might feel it's a major mistake to even consider letting yourself fall in love with your best friend, but I couldn't deny the way I felt, still feel. The story of Reid and I is long and unfinished. But starting tomorrow I will go into the life that is us. Until then...</FONT></EM></STRONG>"

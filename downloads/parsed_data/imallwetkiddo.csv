"event","Yesterday I had an epiphany, and no it had nothing to do with the Seahawks. It has everything to do with how I view myself, and now I feel like I know where to go in my life and nothing is holding me back. I love when you find the root of a problem, and the solution to the problem becomes so clear.

Well I've realized how important football is to everyone in our area as of today. Even though the sun was shining, the mood was of total disappointment.  It was so somber and depressing today, because of yesterday's big game...THE SUPERBOWL. I am not a big football fan, so I could care less what the outcome of the game is...as long as its a fair game, which in my opinion it wasn't...but to everyone that is sad about the Seahawks...CHEER UP!!! They went that far this year...just think about next year.  IT WILL BE OKAY...GO ABOUT YOUR NORMAL LIFE CAPEESH!

I hope everyone feels a bit better after today...

MUCH LOVE!  ~`<3`~"

I've also been busy talking to Kiki about leaving the hell hole that is PaMu and working at her uncles. Sounds like its a definite, so that should be awesome. 

I had an awesome 4th, had a water gun and water ballon fight and ate obdicously good food while watching crazy fireworks.  Hope everyone had a good holiday, and if you are ever bored and want to hang out you know where to find me.  

PS Jason and I bought 12 movies for 80 bucks so we will be having movie fest shortly. Stay tuned...

But after my sleeping in a little I feel much better. I feel even better now that everything I had to do is pretty much finish.  Plus Jason is home and tomorrow is his birthday, so we are going to celebrate w/Roark and Kiki.

However it was kewl when Alexis got drunk and emotional and kicked Kiki and Dani out, over a stupid glass. Anyhoo...there was some crazy England boys there that were really creepy.  Dani and Kiki did body shots off me and Kiki kissed me out of the middle of no where...drunk people are so funny. Lets just say everyone had a great nite, except for minor creepiness it was a blast.

After that we got some food at Dicks and Teriyaki and back to the dorm, where we watched the latest O.C. and CSI, which were both awesome episodes. While we were watching O.C. Jesse went to a party and came back while we were watching CSI. Obviously he had been drinking and he drew up a contract with Jason to wake him up at 11:30 the next morning.  Then we went next door to visit w/some friends and he introduced me as ""Rachel, the coolest girl I know who I'll never be able to do"" :) it was so funny...that kid cracks me up.

"event","Went to a strip club the other nite for my friend Kyrsten or KiKi's birthday. We went to Rick's StripClub on Lake City Way, 15 minutes north of UW. The club was pretty awesome, however it was HELLA smoky and it gave me a migraine. There was some pretty hot girls there, and some pretty...well interesting girls there.  There was this one girl that had a birth control patch on her left shoulder which was pretty hilarious. I told Kiki that if she got a lapdance from her then she wouldn't have to worry about contracting some sort of disease.There was some older, and I mean could be your mother, ladies there...and they were pretty loose and had lots of cellulite on the back of their legs.

When Kiki and I were at the door waiting we got hit on by a stripper. She was like ""are you girls lost?"" and we said ""no we are ok...just waiting for some friends that are coming inside the door""...she said ""do you girls want a dance"" *as she shoved her boobs in our face* we politely declined and shes said "" you know you want some"" to which Kiki replied "" you know it"". So then she told us her name was Pamela and asked Kiki's name while extending her hand. Kiki said ""My name's Kyrsten"" and Pamela said ""can I shake your hand...I promised I washed it"" Man we almost died laughing at her. 

Later that nite Kevin tried to get a lapdance while he was suppose to be on purse watch, but he got rejected. Turns out the girl was his best friend's cousin and she realized she knew him and said it would be too weird to give him a lapdance since he was like family.  Hopefully he got another lapdance...and hopefully so did Roark.  It all ends with Jason and I leaving at 12:33 and Kiki and friends getting kicked out shortly there after for not buying there 2nd round of drinks for their 2nd hour and Roark and Kevin staying in hopes to get a lapdance. Who knows what happened after that...To be continued


Fun was had by all....to say the least!"

I was prepared for the test and was looking forward to get it over with, but then again I didn't have to take it and I don't know how much longer my teacher's going to be out.

Well off to go to walking class, where yes, we have a quiz! I don't understand it but hey how hard can it really be. I hope everyone has a great, fantastic, splendid day like myself.

"event","Last nite was just what I needed. Hanging out with Kayla all day was so much fun. Boy I miss her so much. Jas and I hung out with her until I had to go to work. Work did not go by as fast I had anticipated it to. But 7:30 came soon enough and Jas and Kayla came to save me from the evil clenches of Alice.  Kayla distracted Alice while I clocked off and changed, so we could run to freedom and fun. Our first destination was Sam's Club, so Jas could pick up some pizza and an Icee from the cafe, while Kayla and I picked up pictures, got my free membership and ran around getting free food. After all that we went to Red Robin's so Kayla and I could eat some good ass food, while Jas got dessert...yummy apple crisp.  We ran into Cammie and Lindsay there, and Kayla and Jas decided that I knew everyone and everyone knew me. Our fun ended at my house where we all laid in my bed and talked about the old days and everything we all missed out on since the last time we hung out. The nite ended in sadness when we all had to depart. Jas and I realized how kewl Kayla is and how much we miss her. 

Off to Fred Meyer's to get some Totino pizza that Jas is craving. Laterz..."

So he asked if I was going with him and I said ""are you going to pay?"" all sarcastic like and he said ""yeah of course"". So I said ""Well I have Alex and my sister with me...hold on let me ask"". So we ended up going with him and he paid for all of us to eat. We all ended up getting a dessert, but it was still like $21.

"event","So today I went to my dad's aunts funeral. I didn't think I would be affected so bad because even though she lived 3 houses down from mine, we just didn't see them too much. I saw a whole bunch of family that I hadn't seen since the one and only family reunion. We sat in the little off wing reserved for family only, and it was weird that they would tint the glass, so the other people that were not family couldnt see you. It just seemed odd. I think the memory of my grandmas funeral hit me, and the sad music they played didnt help either.  I just couldnt help but cry. Man funerals really get to me. It's sad...

On a happier note..I took Jason home or back to the dorm. I got to spend the whole rest of the day with him just hanging out. I finally watched ""you got served"" and let me tell you...I have no idea why that movie didn't get an Oscar nomination. That was some damn good acting if I've ever seen it. I felt better when I got to hang out with him, because he makes me laugh and be happy. I'll just miss him because he won't be coming home this weekend, but it will be a fair trade. He'll come home next Monday for 2 weeks...because he only has 1 final. I'm so excited...I just can't hide it...

Some speculations were made...""Maybe they fell and are embarrassed to get up"", ""Maybe they fainted"" or ""Maybe they had a seizure"".  So the librarians came and swarmed the lady on the ground. And then security was called. And then the hunky firemen came. I didnt think anything was serious, until I saw them come. I guess the young lady had dislocated her shoulder or knee, and on the way to the ground hit her head on the chair cutting it open a little bit. 

Thank God for the firemen...but I feel bad for the girl. Hopefully she'll be ok."

"event","So yesterday started out being a fun-filled day. Kayla and Alexis on board for going to UW with me. But of course our party train was delayed because my sister had somewhere to be but she didn't know where. So after driving around Auburn for half an hour we were back on the road, ending up in Seattle at 4:30ish.  Dinner at some Chinese restuarant on the Ave. that wasn't so good. But hey I'm happy I got my rice...Then to Starbucks to get some warm yumminess into our cold bodies. The rest of the night consisted of us hanging upstairs in the room talking about how our ""crack"" aka The O.C. was on in an hour and how we couldn't wait. After we left I sped home to drop off Kayla and Alexis, then  I raced home only missing a minute or two of the beginning. Damn that show is addicting...

Last night overall was a great night and this weekend will be even better...hopefully! I get paid today, going to see a movie probably, going shopping w/sister and Jason, and then getting the spaghetti that I've been craving all week. (oh and the occasional homework, but who wants to talk about that depressing junk anyway). 

Update more later...after I get off work at7...weird I know.

P.S. I'm applying at Sam's with Kayla...hopefully that all works out."

"event","So yesterday at work Kendra was there by herself from 9-2:30 when I could get there. No one would come in for her, not even Candice or Alice. Plus Eric broke both his ankles and was rushed to the hospital. So Kevin had to cover his close shift, so I didn't have to close by myself. Eric called to thank us for covering his shift, and then said that he was going to call and talk to Alice about getting his shifts covered. That means she's probably going to try and get me to cover them, since I'm the only other shift leader. If that happens I quit, because I'm already working 28.5 hours, and I have plans. Plus I cover everyone else's shifts, stay late for others, let everyone leave early for their plans(even if it screws me). I'm sick of being nice and getting screwed over. There are other people at work. So anyone know of any place hiring???? :)

Other than shitty work, everything's been great. Great anniversary with the kewlest and sweetest guy on the planet, and an overall awesome weekend.

O.C. on Thursday at 8, watch it or...you're an idiot! :) lol

"event","Mom's being unreasonable again. Seems like she wants everything her way, or no way at all. My dad agrees with me. He doesn't see any reason why I shouldn't be able to go up to Seattle and visit Jason for a few hours. I mean homework is done, I'm not behind on work, and I have the day off. What else am I going to do? She thinks that I don't spend time with the family, but if I did stay home it's not like we are having a big family night or anything. And I'm going to my great-grandma's 93rd birthday with her Saturday, I even requested the day off for her. What more does she want? 

Anyhooters...Yesterday I got my first writing test back in my English class. He wrote the range of scores on the board before class started. It ranged from 47-91.I thought for sure I was the 47, because I didn't feel like I did all to good. But he gave my paper back, and I was just hoping to see a 73 or something on it, but I got the 91. The highest in the class. I was all smiling really big, which I'm sure gave me away. Thank God he gave them back right at the end of class so I could leave right away, not letting anyone know that I'm the one with the high score. So that made my day...plus I was happy at the end of the night because my mom said ok for going up to UW today.

I bought total random stuff today in the bookstore. Graph paper, hole puncher/ruler, a mini stapler, and a sticky pad for the car so I can put my cell phone on it. 3 of the things I could use and needed, so I suppose they weren't so random. 

Well I suppose I should go to class now. Update later..."

"event","So we lost another person last nite at work. That's two people now in two days. I think that it will be the end of the ""firing"" for awhile, but we are still losing people when Alice returns. Kayla, Kendra, and Kevin all put their two weeks in. A part of me wants to as well, but then I feel bad for leaving them with nothing. At least the perk of losing another person last nite is that I got Saturday off too...in turn for working Monday. I'd rather have Friday and Saturday off rather than Friday and Monday. 

One more day until ULTIMATE EXCITMENT!....:) 


In the library board...class doesn't start for another hour and I have everything done. I hate being an overachiever. I guess it's better than me procrastinating though. Maybe then I can transfer to a school in Seattle so that things would be easier."

"event","So yes, I'm back at GreenRiver and I started to wonder, why am I not going to a four year university like everyone else. Then I remembered...I can't afford to go there. That's right, I can't even afford to go to here, at GreenRiver. Oh well, maybe something will work out where I could go to a community college close to UW, that way I could be in the area. I just want to live somewhere where there is stuff to do within walking distance. 

Anyhoo...Kayla and I went up to UW to visit. Kayla thinks we should go up there more often because there are not just a few, but hoards of hot guys, and girls...but for Kayla...HOT GUYS! It was so funny being up there with Kayla. First off, we had to use the bathroom so bad, but the girls bathroom on Jason's floor was locked, so we had to go downstairs. Since Kayla worked like 8+ hours, standing all day, we decided to use the elevator. Not knowing how to use the id card to use the elevator, we ended up missing the next floor down and just decided to get off on the first floor. Us both being blind, we missed that there was a bathroom right off the elevator, by the entrance and ended up walking all the way down to the other end of the building. It was alright, because we made it to the bathroom and we ended up seeing more hot guys and more of the hall. (Now we know where all the food is, so we can make late nite raids, later!)

So nothing really fascinating has happened with me. School's started. I like all my classes. Yoga only meets 2 days a week, but yesterday was my first day doing some Yoga stuff, and absolutely love my class and teacher. She's so nice and she encourages you to do everything at your own pace, unlike the other Yoga teacher. I actually wish we met more often, because I actually feel awake after Yoga. My science class is pretty kewl. I've never had one big class with two teachers here before. I guess I won't be able to complain about no one on one help, since I have two teachers to help me.  It doesn't seem like that class will be too hard. Last, my english class is good. It goes by so fast, which is good, but mainly because of the teacher. He is pretty funny, although sometimes it seems like he tries to make everything funny when it really should not. On the first day he was giving us explains on how to make the process of taking roll take a long time, so that we can waste time and not have to learn as much. Thereby avoiding as many tests as possible. Anyhow, I'm pretty happy with all my classes, and I've completed/got ahead of all my work so I don't have a reason to put it off to the last minute. 

I miss everyone thats gone off to universities, and even those that have stuck around, just that I havent seen that much. Hopefully I get a chance to catch up with people that I havent kept in contact with, and even those that I have. Email me or what not, I enjoy and talking to everyone. Love and miss everyone."

"event","The house seems so big, and I feel so small. I must say it is rather quiet in here without my family. It's also alot easier to clean, since I just have to clean after myself. I'm so pathetic...I cleaned all the dishes in the sink, and the whole kitchen. Tomorrow I have plans to clean out the fridge, there is a wierd smell. Kayla calls me ""the perfect housewife"" because I love to clean and cook. I don't think thats bad, atleast I know my house will be clean. My mom says I'm ""too organized"" because I organized my clothes by color and the coupons by expiration. It just seems to make things easier. Oh well...my quirkiness will continue...what are you going to do right?

So the weekend is fast approaching and I'm unsure about the pudding wrestling. I still have to see if Kayla's parents are going out of town, otherwise we have to have it somewhere else. I hope that everything works out because I know alot of people who want to come, and we have to do it before everyone leaves for college. Sorry to those who have already gone. Maybe someone will videotape and send you a copy. Remember if we do have the pudding wrestling, then everyone has to bring pudding as there admission. It doesn't matter how many you bring, 1 box is the min. there is no max. If you dont bring the pudding you will be entered into either the wet t-shirt contest (girls only) and the wet boxers contest(boys only). So if you dont want that...then we all know what you are going to bring. 

Well it's getting late and I have obligations to uphold in the morning. I'll update later with further info. on the pudding. 

Hope everyone has a great nite and a fun and safe weekend!

It was so weird because I saw my friend Janie, who I haven't seen since the last day of 8th grade. I remember being really close friends with her...but who knows what happened there. I guess we just grew apart and got busy. Also, Amelia came by and asked if I wanted to go camping with a huge group on the 28th. Seeing how thats next weekend I doube I'll be able to go, unless by some miracle Alice schedules me off. *taps on wood and glass* Amelia also told me something interesting that makes wonder why I had to hear it from her.

After I woke up I made Oatmeal Raisin cookies which I've been craving for this last past week. After baking and showering, I discoverd that my dad was installing my newest purchase. A CD player for my car, which I drove all the way to the Northgate Car Toy's sale for. 

After a on-again-off-again hectic day full of weirdo's at work, I returned home to find my favorite foods cooked and waiting for me. My mom even offered to dish it up for me while I cleaned up from work. My sister and her were even getting along, playing a weird card game. I dont know why they were getting along, but it's a much needed turn of events for this household.  ""This is a house of love not a house of hate"" <---what I said to Dani and Kevin who act like bro/sis at work. 

Unexpected phone call and some very sweet and much needed to hear words coming from the other end of the phone. Made my day feel so complete. I am one lucky girl, and I thank God everyday.

Just another typical day, which a few unexpected surprises along the way.

Which was really odd since I was just thinking about them and ta-da they were at my front door. I didn't know how much I missed hanging out with them everyday, until they came over and we all just hung out (mainly in my room of course). So now we have a game plan...to paint my room (which requires ripping down all the pictures on my wall) and Brian building me a new computer. I don't know if the 2nd one's necessary or definite but the 1st one is definitely going to happen. I'm excited to rearrange my room and paint it because I'm getting a new bed soon, so it will good just to change everything. 

Also, we finally got to have my dad's birthday dinner. I thought it was just going to be my dad, mom, sis, grandpa and myself, but my uncle Lyle and cousin Jeremy came too. I didn't even know they were in town. They are in town because my cousin has a checkup to make sure his leukemia is still in remission. Anyhoo...we ate at Genghis Khan Mongolian Grill at the SeaTac Mall. It was soooooo good. 

Well thats pretty much the highlite of my day. So if anyone has suggestions for room color or design just let me know...even though I have my room decorator Brian to my rescue."

"event","Today was my bud4life's wedding, and it was quite exquisite. It was different that most weddings I have and probably will ever attend. Luda looked angelic and so beautiful. You could tell that she was truly happy and that is all a person, or rather friend, could ever ask from her. I wish her the best of luck. It dawned on me today how soon we are expected to grow up. It just seems like the other day that Luda and I were in middle school with our careless notions on how life will be when we grow up...and here we are 4 years later, recently graduated from highschool and considering the idea of marriage. I cannot believe my little friend from the Ukraine, who was so quiet and polite is now someones wife. Life is a changing...and hopefully it's for the better. The only part of the day I regret is not staying to congratulate you in person and tell you how wonderful you look. 

On a less emotional end of the day, my mother and I had lunch and got a few items from the grocery store to tide us over before Vegas. It seems so surreal that I will be going to Vegas and my mom just decided on a whim to have a family vacation. It is rather exciting, yet unpredictable from my mom. Anyhoo...after coming home from the store we watched, Mona Lisa Smile, which was a good and somewhat refreshingly inspirational movie, contrary to what I heard from some unnamed sources (uhmm...Jason). It was nice to able to spend time with my mom again and catch up on things I've missed while outside the house. (To someone who might not know me and are reading this it would appear that I live on my own, when in fact I live in the same house as my parents:)).

I would say overall I've had a wonderful day, or more of a joyful day. Sure the day could of been better if I had date for the wedding but that is in the past now, so it is rather trivial. I hope that everyone had an equally wonderful day as I, and if not, the day is still young...so make the best of it!"

Alice even made me inspect the back to make sure it was clean, before Kev could go home.  Jeez...people make such a big deal out of nothing. On a side note...no freaky guys came in today, aside from the normal everyday kind of people, but no gun slinging pizza throwers today. On a sad note...we let someone go today. But in all fairness she did have a chance to redeem herself...she just didnt take it. Some people are not too bright. Oh well...maybe the new person will be better.

Less than a week before I go to Vegas...I'm so excited. Time seems to go by so slow, I think its against me. Friday could not come any slower..I think it has something to do with it's payday and I need the cash. 

Still dateless for Luda's wedding but I might have a date with the beautiful Hayley. Arent I one lucky lady? ;) Anyhoo..We'll see how that goes. Speaking of Hayley...we still need to have pudding wrestling...so let me know when is good for you and we'll work something out. Hopefully before school starts...if you know what I mean ;)

  You told me that I havent updated in quite some time...so here it is.  

  Lately I've been working alot, especially now that they want to make me shift leader. Which means a 50 cent raise...woot go me!...any raise is good with me...just means more money in my paycheck. I was hoping that work would help the time go by faster since you left, but it hasnt. It seems to go by slower. Today I thought it was Wednesday but then I realized it was only Tuesday and I still have over a week to see you. Also today, some psycho man flipped out on us at work. He threw pizza at Liana but it almost hit me. I said we should of called the cops...but Liana said she didnt want him to have a reason to come back. Scary shit though...

  So the Vegas trip is coming up shortly. I'm excited for it, although Kayla and Roark tell me its boring when you are underaged. I dont care though, I'm sure that I'll have a blast, because I dont get the opportunity to travel much and when I do...I enjoy it.I cant wait to see all the kewl places and enjoy the warm weather. Tanning alongside the pool in my cute two-piece swimsuit. I havent been able to swim this summer so I cant wait until I'll get the chance to everyday. 

  Luda's getting married on Saturday, I'm so excited. I still need a date. I dont know anyone who knows her that can go. I'll probably just end up taking my sister because she seems to be the only person free. 

  Well there is not much more to share. That's about all thats new with me. Just waiting until Friday when I get paid and have the day off. I hope you read this and I hope you're having fun. Too bad that we couldnt share the trip together...I just cant wait until you return safely back to me. Love and miss you SO much.

We never really get a chance to hang out lately, since I work alot and my family has all their own shit to do. I just feel sometimes like I'm not part of the family anymore. So much happens when I'm gone that sometimes I'm left wondering what my role in the family is. Enough of the emotional ish'...Last nite after work I went out w/Kayla and Alexis and we watched Harry Potter 3. It was such a good movie, and we were surprised by how many lil'kids were at the theater at 10pm. Then today I got to see The Terminal, which a really good movie. It's just nice getting to go to the theater and watch all these movies that I want to watch. (Speaking of...Kuya Porn you still owe me Dodgeball...) I also got some shopping done. Got my friend Luda her wedding gift. Just have to go to the craft store for some gift wrap decor. And I got myself a jacket and shirt for 20 bucks, a wallet and some lotion. 

Well I think it's time for sleep and dreams...(Dont you just hate those random dreams that make you wake up and say ""Where the hell did that dream come from?""...man I had one of those last nite...I still have no idea why I dreamt it...man those are irritating :)...)

"event","You write ""Damnit, you're beautiful!"" and all I can think is ""why are you lying to me..."".  You are too sweet to describe in words...all I can say is you make me happy just being around you. Your presence is infectious.

Spiderman 2 comes out tomorrow...I'm excited even though I have to work. It's a good thing I have Wednesday off...I'll be sleeping! 

I think someone with a pool should invite me over to swim...The day is nice and my bathing suit isn't getting wet by itself...or is it? ;) 

Well I'm feeling crafty or is that fiesty?...oh well I'm off! 

Au revoir mon amis!"

"event","So yeah...I'm graduated! I've learned that people are willing to give up LOADS of money to you when you graduate. I feel bad for taking their money, especially from people that I hardly see. Anyhoo...I'm still adjusting to not having to go to school anymore...it's wierd that I wont see the people that I'm use to seeing on a day to day basis anymore. Hopefully I'll be able to keep in touch with lots of people still...but for those going out of state for college it will be somewhat difficult. It's ok though I enjoy the time to do whatever it is I want to do.

Lunch at Auburn Red Robins for anyone that wants to come. Probably around 11:30ish in the afternoon. 

I miss the people...and hopefully the people miss me!:) 


Much love for everyone!...congratulations to all those to graduated. 

P.S. can you believe he hugged him..thats kind of creepy!"

"event","So everyone from Auburn High...atleast all the seniors...are excited for tomorrow evening. Everyone will be look all jazzed up and ""superfly"". :) I can't wait to see how everyone looks...I know everyone will look pretty.  I can't wait because it shall be so much fun...a time to unwind from the stress of finals and what not...just what the doctor ordered.

However...I still have to do a bunch of work before Monday...but tomorrow that is the least of my worries.

So graduation is just around the corner...can you believe next weekend there will be no more highschool for the rest of our lives?!? It just baffles me how fast time flew by...it just makes me think...Where have I been? Yeah thats right...the drama consumes you! Oh well...its almost over and like the French say it ""C'est la vie!""

"event","It's weird how people get pissed off when you are honest and straight forward with them. I mean they ask you for your honest opinion and really they dont want it. I guess I should be fake like alot of other people...and that will help me not piss anyone off. Sorry I dont know what you are looking for, but I guess its not me!

You were speaking about how you aren't an exhibitionist and I said ""Not like me..."" and you said ""Hi my name is Chad"" :) Silly boy...

So pudding wreastling is on. I think it will be the same day as Grad Nite, but we'll see if that works out. So if you are interested in attending or participating just let me know.

"event","So today's big adventure is a trip to Ikea. Leah and I are going to find bunk beds with slides on them and slide down them.  I proposed that we have a picnic in Ikea...but if that doesnt work than have one in the parking lot. ""here is the doorknob to my heart"". :) ""What?!?""

Hayley and I decided that we shall sell videos of us mud wrestling...it will go to help support the cause. I wonder how many people will actually buy it?

So today feels some what productive and relaxed all at the same time. I actually got to watch that video that I am suppose to watch for class and I caught up with some people I havent seen in a long time. It feels good to talk to people that you haven't seen...and especially when you have a good insightful talk too. 

""can we go sit outside and hang out?""...""No you'll get in trouble...say you are going to the bathroom and I'll let you go""....Isham is awesome~"

Friday...of course i had to go to school which sucked...but i stayed after school with erica to wait for her mom to pick us up but my mommy stopped at the school so i could put some stuff in her car to take home for me...then we pretended to be sneaky secret agent ppl and went to see ms.amos and as she turned to look at us we both dive to the ((dirty and disgustingly gross)) floor pretending she didnt see us...she loves us...were her favorite! woop woop!...then we were all like yeah...amos! what now!...then her mom came to get us and we went got a bagel then waited for the bus to take us to the city....it was cold outsideeee....brrrr...the bus got there blah blah...got to the city where danielle was waiting for us at the bus station! we walked around the city....to get a cab....got a cab and took it to Irving Plaza where we were gonna see HONESTLY in concert! we waited there from about 7-Oclock till about 8-Oclock before they finally let us in while we were waiting...erica stayed in the line while danielle and i went to get coffee...we couldnt find the starbucks so we got incredibly gross lattes that was majorly in need of sugar! then we were at the concert and it started at like 9 and when honestly finally got on stage there were like 5 ppl in the whole room that actually knew of them and knew the words to their songs so ((3 of those being me erica and danielle)) so we were singing and being crazy...erica missed some of the words and Rob laughed at her on stage...it was awesome cuz hes super nice and Matt pointed at me and smiled and was really funny to me...after they went on and we got bored of the other ppl we just kinda hung out around the place and waited for honestly to come out of the back then we took pictures with them and talked to them for a while and erica and i danced around like crazy ppl and they laughed and danced with us...it was awesome..they def thoguht we were mental ppl....then around 12:30 when stupid jordan knight finally stopped singing the rest of the guys came out they were signing autographs and took pictures and stuff and we were like the last ppl to get it done cuz were awesome and their favorites i asked Matt 7 if i could have his shirt cuz i really liked it and he was like well i dont know you that well yet and i was like im willing to trade you and i was gonna give him the ski club shirt i have but he said he didnt know me well enough yet and maybe if you come to one more of our shows i'll give it t you and i was like arright i will come to another one but you have to promise..so ima hold him to that!and ima go to another show! woop woop! well we were with the boys and they were signing our cd's and joe was like wahts your name and i was like sarah and at the same time we both said With and ""h"" so he wrong that on the cd cuz hes a big dork! and hes dirty and i liked it!...Rob wrote ""you rock"" on ericas cd cuz shes a big durrball and i like it shes says it 24-7 its cute! woop woop!...then the security guards were being turd faces so we had to leave...so we were waiting outside for the cabby that we called to come pick us up and like everyone was gone so we were like i  hope they dont come out ehre cuz then they will think we are stalkers...and then all the sudden this police officer comes up and is like did you call and danielle was like i made a call and he was like to the cops and she was like no...we thought that the cop was adam (( our cabby)) but it wasnt...haha...so we were just waiting around...and as we were driving pst the venue i saw joe loading the trailer up! then we went to erica and danielles dads apartment for the night...we made spagetti (( at 2:00 am cuz thats when we finally got home )) then went to sleep!

Saturday: we woke up around 9 and left to go home....drove home and listened to more honestly....and stuff...when we got home erica and i put Gilmore girls on and we fell asleep till about 3ish...then when we woke up we played cards and watched gilmore girls and hten it was all the sudden 10 at night so we went to the basement and watched movies....till about 2..then went to sleep

Sunday: we woke up at 11...watched a movie and ate mashed tatoes....then my daddy came to pick me up (( i wanted to play in the snow at j-moos house but he wouldnt let me cuz i havent been home for like 2 days )) so i came home and now i am here listening to the honestly cd over and over again...i miss the boys...they were so much fun to hang out with! and dance with! and be goofy! and they were soo sweeeeeet! <3

I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside 
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in 
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice 
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry 
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar 
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry 
well Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some music on while I pour 

The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there 
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there 
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now 
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell 
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride 
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out 
baby its cold outside

I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside 
The answer is no - Ooh baby, it's cold outside 
This welcome has been - I'm lucky that you dropped in 
So nice and warm -- Look out the window at that storm 
My sister will be suspicious - Man, your lips look so delicious 
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore 
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips look delicious 
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Never such a blizzard before 

I've got to go home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there 
Say, lend me your comb - It's up to your knees out there 
You've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now 
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me 
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow 
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died 
I really can't stay - Get over that old out 


Baby it's cold outside

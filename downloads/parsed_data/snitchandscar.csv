An update on the status of this Journal-

This journal is no longer used for posting purposes, but for keeping track of LJ communities that I'm interested in.

The Greatest Journal that I have been linking to likely does not work due to Greatest Journal going under.

I currently don't have any public journals to link to here.

Also, I just changed the journal layout due to photo bucket issues."

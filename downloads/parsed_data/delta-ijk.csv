"event","I feel so alone. I know that I'm not. But. I feel so alone. Summer's supposed to be fun, right? Well. Kinda sucks that it's not. Sorry for being such an ass and bringing everyone else down. I know I could make this post private, but hell, this is where I need to get things out. Sorry I'm such a bastard.

I ran up a phone bill... long distance. It was stupid of me to do, but reception for cell phone wasn't great at all. I loved being on the phone. It felt... nice... especially since I haven't heard friends' voices in a while. So, instead of being cut off a lot, I used the land line. Quite stupid of me. So, my dad starts yelling at me, and I'm like, agh. But that was understandable. It just feels like complete shit when he tells me that I'm useless and wasting my summer. Sure. I bought books at the beginning of summer to study. Sure, I did study. Sure, I didn't ""study enough."" I'm worthless as a son, I suppose.

Sorry. I feel that my ambition to learn over the summer has worked against me. My dad takes examples of me going to the library to study as the ONLY times when I ever studied. He says that I wasted my whole summer away. I love how everything works out. I work from 8am-6...sometimes 7pm... some days, I go home, eat, and fall straight asleep. Other days, I study materials for next semester. I do waste time. I do procrastinate. But, I do it for a reason.

I have no friends.

I can't go out and have fun with friends... because I have none. I feel trapped. Confined. I can't live when I'm studying all the damn time. I am online and I enjoy chatting with friends. I met some freshmen for next year... and I'm very happy to meet them. I may seem overly hyper and giddy online... but only because I truly do enjoy socializing with them. I'm sorry if I need to have human contact, dad. Ever since I've moved here, I've been in a shallow depression because there aren't many friends around. Hell. Before I met the freshmen living around here, I only knew 3 other people from the UofR here. They have lives, though. Just the other day, I met Margot at the Jazz festival. She saw me and talked with the freshmen... and said something to the extent of... ""I said I'd take care of Max when he's in Buffalo... but heh, I guess I haven't really been doing a good job of that."" O_o; Thanks for wanting to make me feel at home. I truly do appreciate that. But... I guess it would be awkward for me to really... just hang out with you... or with Miranda... or with Sandra... just for the mere fact that I don't know any of your other friends... and I'd be a burden just to hang out with... randomly.

Plus, since I can remember, I've gotten into arguments with my father about going to friends' houses... about hanging out with them on weekday or weekend nights. Never in my life have I really... gone to a friends' house to ""have fun."" The only time I remember is when I went to Bryan's house to play Halo or Airsoft. And that was because it was in the summer... and my dad would be at work.

So. Back to what I was saying. I'm sorry for not doing work. I'm sorry for wasting my summer. I'm sorry that I don't want to spend every second studying. I'm sorry that I feel depressed. I'm sorry for my rants. I'm sorry for talking about current events. Yes. He even mentioned that... he wonders how I know so much about current events and decides that I waste my time online reading the news and talking to other people instead of studying. How does he know this..? Because he talks with me about the war in Lebanon right now... and I give my opinions and other facts about it. Sorry I ever talk to you. I guess I remember why I never tell you about my friends now. I guess I remember why I never appear to ""have fun"" with anything that I do. Anything ""fun"" that I do is just wasting time. I'm sorry that you never came to a football game to listen and watch me march. I'm sorry that you tried forcing me to quit band because I talked excitedly about it. I'm sorry that you tried forcing me to quit Academic Team because I talked about how much I loved it. I'm sorry that you never came to a concert nor a competition. I'm sorry that I felt awkward whenever I met so many other parents of band kids at the concerts. I'm sorry that I realized that anything I do that I enjoyed should be kept from you so that you wouldn't restrict it.

I'm sorry for being a failure."

"event","I found the source of my depression:

It lies in friendships.

Well, I need to say that first of all, I have quite a few friendships here that are priceless. I could not replace them. But, I think that it's some friendships which I just cannot help but feel left out. Either it's because I have openly expressed that I don't drink (and/or disapprove of drinking) or I'm just not a cool guy, but I am left out of many events by my Asian friends.

Of course, it's not obligatory for them to invite me... but, it just feels kinda sucky when you realize that they're part of this clique that you will never be good enough for. I feel as if friendships that I thought were tight... just weren't so much friendships. I... feel used. Quite a few things happen where... if I don't conform to what they want, I am called ""evil."" I get slapped by this girl for expressing my opinions about the driving habits of this one boy that she likes. I feel disrespected... and yet, I don't do anything about it. I never really have complained. The only person I've really talked to about this is Miranda. She probably knows more about what I feel... than myself. I bury quite a bit of feelings.

But, yeah. I think that I won't be seeing much of many of these people anymore in the upcoming years... so I shouldn't really confront them about how I feel. It'd be useless. No more will I act as friendly to them as I have before. It's just... too taxing to feel like I'm a good friend by offering my services and help or whatever... and not receiving anything in return. God. I'm a horrible person.

Hah. I think I just typed out everything I felt without actually describing what happened.

I feel used by this one person because I always offer help, but she never returns the help. She describes everyone else as competitive, yet, she is extremely competitive herself.
I feel rejected by this one person because no matter what, she has stated that every other guy is better than me. Yet, people around us often feel that we are close... just because I haven't let what she said get to me. I feel that she is a person that would ditch me if she had the chance.
I feel as if this person looks down on me and thinks she has to take care of me as if I were a child. Hmm... I guess it's a good thing that she wants to take care, yet, I feel that it's condescending. The same feeling surfaced way back when with my ex. It's the same notion to which I ultimately disliked about her.
Agh. I can't even form coherent sentences anymore because my mind is in such a messed up state. =(
But it just feels like everything is surreal. I miss my friends. I wish I could be back in Oklahoma where I understand people better. Where I grew up... I miss that feeling of home and familiarity. I guess that is the true root of what causes this depression.
But I do feel left out whenever I see many pictures of fun little get-togethers where everyone is happily tipsy... I wish I could just let go of my fucking morals and lose control.
People outside my window are drunk. One guy was singing for the longest time, and now, there's a group of people laughing hysterically... at 4am. It's fucking Sunday, for fuck's sake.
God. Damn. Will I truly be happier if I sink to their level? If I get drunk for the hell of it?
Fuck.
Why am I so uptight? What is wrong with me? Why can't I enjoy college like a normal person? *sigh*

But, there are very many positive aspects of my life.
I have amazing hallmates. My friendships with all of them have grown. One person loves to describe me as the person who never stops smiling... even when in pain. Haha... thanks. I like that description... even though it isn't true. Wait. Oh fuck. It is true. =_=; But, he uses it in a way such that I am flattered by it. I'm able to make other peoples' lives better by smiling. That makes all the difference to me.
My hallmates joke around with me, but everyone radiates with the utmost respect.
Wow. Is this again about comparing guy friends to girl friends? It seems like, wait.. no. Even that's not it. There's this guy who wants to get one of my friends drunk alone. She says she has heard stories about other girls sleeping with him after being drunk... Although she says she doesn't trust him... and although she is wary... I think that there'll be a time when she isn't able to control herself. That'll be a sad day.

And what the fuck is up with D-day? Getting drunk for absolutely no fucking good reason. I... guess it's fun... but what the hell? The whole campus... ESPECIALLY underage drinkers... all getting drunk. God, fucking, dammmit. The absolute corruption of every individual. I want to slap every person in favor of D-day. But, I can't. Ugh...

Oh yeah. The positive aspects of my life. I forgot. Even though I've lost eboard elections to people who have their entire sorority vote for them... that was fine, because she said, ""I voted for you."" She must've known that I would've lost anyways... but it was a really nice gesture. She's an amazing person. I'm glad I lost to her... just a bit pissed that I had to face a biased crowd... and give it my all. Kinda sucked. I'm doing great in other club organizations... and I think I will be pretty useful for those clubs. That's always a plus. I'm not doing great in classes... but.. but... uhh... and I'm... socially inept... aw fuck.

You know what? There's a point where optimism can't be kept up anymore. My life pretty much sucks right now. It doesn't matter if it's caused by me or not, my life just sucks. I need to ride it out or find a way to change it. Thanks for listening to these horrible ramblings."

This was taken from a Xanga post earlier today. Now, I respect this guy bunches, but... but... that kind of made me feel quite worthless.

Mmm... I don't have much else to say because anything and everything I say about religion can be rebutted... eh."

Well. Not over over, but... you know, over. For a month.

Man. It sucks living in Buffalo... just because I know like, 2 people there. Wait. 3. Lol. I guess I could call them up and ask them to hang... but, ahhh! Too much work. xP

It's been a blur... everything's happening so fast. I don't even believe I'm mature enough to be in college. Coming to college... it probably has some bad psychological effects. hahah. *sigh*

Lol. I think I finally know the names of all my hallmates. Haha. Jeez. Finally. But gah. Memorizing over 200 people... that's caused me to forget a few people back home. *sigh* Home. I'd almost forgotten about that, too. Blargh.

"event","I talked to Holly before the party; she's a sweet girl - went to national leadership summits, sings very well, so much potential. She's at the party and she tries a bit of beer along with Tina. That's fine, I suppose. When we went to the main party, both Tina and Holly are quite shy about dancing. They start getting into it. A guy dances with Holly... they have a ball. She never gets his name, but after a few hours of dancing, she wants to get a drink. A beer is shoved in front of her and she ... decides to drink it. Her reasoning was, ""I was so thirsty, and it was either I drink the beer or be dehydrated."" Alcohol doesn't really hydrate, girl. So as soon as I see that, I just... get freaked out. I was just totally out of there. That was the reason why I told Tina that I was going. She didn't want to be left there alone, so she asks me to wait a while so she can tell her soroity girls that she's leaving. She then leaves with me and then Holly follows us. Holly is afraid that she is drunk. I tell her to not worry because she didn't seem like she drank a lot. But she explains to me that she has a low tolerance for alcohol. Her breath reeks of beer. I could smell it standing just a few feet away from her. If you were worrying about your low tolerance for alcohol, then why were you drinking? Why? I'm really afraid for those girls because they seem to really want to get into the sorority. What if those girls start hazing them? Forcing them to drink? They'll go along with it because they are blinded by their want to join. They're too preoccupied by that... and soon enough, they will consider a few drinks as not a bad thing. They will say that drinking in moderation is fine. ...A bit later, they will start thinking, oh, it won't matter if I get drunk on weekends; I don't have any classes the next day. It's an addiction. Wow. I was offered beer about 9 times at the party in Wilder. Then there was free beer at the party in the quads. So much temptation. Any upperclassman would not care whether or not you were underage - you were able to obtain alcohol anyway. A person who I knew through xanga just posted something about not worrying about the few shots she took, but the bottle of champaigne put her over. She puked in her room. She never mentioned anything bad about the drinking and what it was doing to her body; she mentioned that it was bad to puke when there was a cute guy in her room when she did puke. Maybe she wanted to get drunk so she could fuck? I don't know. Maybe subconsciously, she wanted to get knocked up. She claims that it was sweet that a guy stayed with her all night to make sure she was alright. I've no idea if you can overdose on alcohol, but at least there was someone there to make sure she didn't die. But then again, I'm questioning his motives because she remembers just cuddling with him all night. Hmm. Whatever. Even here, when there are supposedly very smart kids - they aren't. At least... not... with... ack. Whatever. It just frustrates me."

But it all depends on whether or not you want to make a living out of the money you pay. Oh wellz. lol.. I'm winning.. although I have no idea how. Heh. I have the highest number of tokens of the 5 people playing. Now. If I don't bet for a while, then I will still be in the semifinalist. Think, Max, think. Argh. Now I'm thinking about the money. Ugh.

Okay. Well. I'm writing this in notepad right now just because it's easier to type than it is
to write. Hmm.. well.. what should I say? Hm.. okay. Lemme explain so much that's happened to
me during these times. I will try to explain everything. Okay, I said so much about Mike and
all. So I won't say much about him, now. Hm.. I'm thinking about how I should tell my parents.
We should say that. It would save so much trouble and everything will be normal. I think it was
a mistake for me to not say anything to them in the beginning. I didn't want anything being
screwed up. However, it is now very screwed up. You need affection right? You want the affection
that I can't or am too afraid to give right now. Face it, to you, it's become boring. You really
don't love me anymore. I'm afraid that that is what is really happening. I think I may be right.
For you, it hurts not seeing me, or at least holding hands, or going to movies. Argh. You don't
want to tell my parents for fear of them not liking you. They'll deal with it. They can't do
anything. I won't let them. Bah. I want to be able to do stuff with you like anyone that's
normal. Lol.... I'm not normal. Lol.. thanks. Anyways. I guess I am a bit antisocial. Okay. Very
antisocial. I just... well, I don't know how to express my love I guess. Hmm... bah. Um.. lost
train of thought. Hmm.. now, with that in mind, let's go to Neal! Lol. Bah. I'm not jealous of
Neal, but I am jealous of what he can do. Does that make sense? Lol. Probably not. Hmm. I can't
show affection like he can to you. You are happy with him. Every time I see you two together,
you are smiling or laughing or giggling. He knows how to make you happy. Argh. How should I say
this? Bah. Well.. today, when we were looking for you, (Alisha and I) we went to your locker then
Geometry class. You weren't there. I'd figured that you might've gone to Mrs. Rice's class
to look for Alisha since you were getting a ride from her. But Alisha thought that you were in
the library. I asked why. She said that Neal was there. Bah. Well... my surprise when I saw the
library. Hmm. You were so happy. I wish I could just do something like that and keep you happy.
But I can't. I've tried so hard, but I just can't. Argh. How hard is it for me to say this?
Hmm.... well. Anyways. Onto Mike. I think that what I did was wrong. I shouldn't have started
liking you in the first place. It is all my fault. Mike did nothing wrong. I kinda figured
that. Well, I didn't know that you were his first girlfriend. I knew someday that this thing
that I did will come biting me back in the butt. History will repeat itself. I'm serious. I think
that you don't want to be my girlfriend anymore. There are so many reasons for this. First of
all, there are so many other guys out there that are better than me. (i.e. Mike, Neal, Justin)
How did you start liking me anyways? That was pure luck. I don't believe in just true love.
It doesn't exist. By not telling my parents, I can't go out with you. At all. If I tell them,
there might be a chance I could. I'm willing to take that chance. But.. you aren't. For some
reason. Have you told your mom yet? I bet not. Hmm... why not? Is it because you are ashamed of
me? If that's the reason, then I'd have to break up with you. I've seriously thought about just
ending it all by breaking up with you. After a talk with Zech, I realized that I was just being
stupid. He figured out why I was trying to do that. Argh. He gave me good advice also. I'll tell
you that later. Right now, I need to know if you are proud of me, if you do love me, if you do
want to be with me. I know you're still trying to ""pick up the broken pieces of your heart"" but
in that process, you are hurting me. I have no idea what to do. Everytime I try to even talk to
you, you just reject me. You go, I don't know. I have no idea whether to bring it up or not
because I'm afraid just talking about it will hurt you. I am about ready to explode right now.
I have no idea what to do, I'm just too confused. And I'm also afraid that what happened to Mike,
That's going to happen to me. That is just all too likely. If Alisha weren't Neal's girlfriend,
I'm sure you'd dump me right on the spot. *sigh* Of course that's all what I think. If I'm making
you mad, I'm sorry. I've probably hit the truth. I hope I won't ever make you mad again. Hmm..
Also, I overheard Neal asking Alisha ""Is Max coming tonight?"". I'm assuming it was a movie.
I think I heard movie in that sentence somewhere. But I didn't hear the answer. Things like this.
I was just like. Um... did you ask me? No? I see. But that's alright. I don't care. Why should
I care? ....... But I guess I did care. That just pushed me over the edge. I'm losing it.
I'm probably going insane. This is why I'm writing this letter so I don't cry or start destroying
things. Afterschool, right afterschool, guess where I went? I went away from the school by
walking, to get some peace and quiet time to think. Didn't work. Guess what I felt? Nothing.
Absolutely nothing. I just had this hollow feeling. How do I cope with that? How do I do
anything? Zech told me that most high school relationships don't go anywhere. Most people are
just in it for the fun. Alisha told me that high school relationships don't go very far. Why
do I think different? Because I haven't experienced it enough? That's probably why. Neither of
them is thinking high school relationships can be long lasting. Argh. Am I just thinking too
much? Not enjoying what is happening now and worrying about the future? Does it scare you that
I think about the future? What will happen? How everything will go? Like if you graduate with us,
it's not likely that we'll go to the same colleges. Long term relationship. That will just kill
the relationship. What about if you moved to Maine? Killed the relationship. Well... we don't
have to worry about that now do we? I am killing the relationship right now. I have no idea what
to do. I am acting stupid and amateurish. I have no idea what's going on and I cannot show my
affection towards you. Even holding hands with you. You ... just don't want to hold hands with
me anymore? What happened today at lunch... just about drove me nuts. Argh. Not your fault.
It's all my fault. I shouldn't have done any of this in the beginning and I shouldn't have
screwed this all up towards the end. Zech says that you love me for who I am? He tells me not to
change. I want to learn from Neal. How he does things, it just makes you love him. Bah.
*Deep Breath* Argh. I'm so conflicted. I'm sorry about this note, but I have to do something.
I wrote you a note today during lunch, but I just couldn't give it to you. I'm thinking about
trashing this note anyways. Bah. If you hate my guts right now, I don't blame you. I'm hating
myself. A thousand times anyone can ever hate me. Argh.. I don't think that you're online right
now. Hmm.. you're still at the movie? Wow. Long time. I can't say anymore. It.. just hurts too
much. I want you to know that I still love you. I just can't show it all too well. Those are my
thoughts on most everything. Zech told me to tell everything that I think. Maybe you'd understand
then. Or else, maybe I'm just making your life more miserable than it should be. Anyways. I hope
that you can say that you love me back. I really do. I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.
Call me. Please call me and let me explain anything that you need to know.

Love,
Max

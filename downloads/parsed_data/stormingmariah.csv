"event","Well we're back from Amateur.  Despite the fact that Cooper is a man now he still acted like the perfect gentleman at the show.  He was awesome.  Too bad the judge, a very large very gay man, didn't like him, I guess Coop was just too masculine.  Allie was very good for her first show.  And she won the Jr. Horse Classic class.  

Tiger is back to the way he should be this year, jumping 2'9"" like its 18""  - no sweat for him.  We're going to Big Loop this weekend for the most fun horse related events, Hunter Paces the horses love them and the riders too!  Then to Smethport to kiss some ass barrel racing....just for fun (and because we can)!

I didn't want to work at the mall this summer cuz I'd spend too much money on clothes....so I got a job at Farmington Country Max in the Horse department....I've made $200 so far and spent $500  this may have been a bad idea....my horses are even more spoiled every now then they were.

We had a painting of Pris in her youth done...It looks great, I'm glad she still w/ us....I don't know what I'll do w/o her.  

I'm interviewing with Paychex....for a COOP Wish Me Luck, I'll need it.  I really hope I get it. 

Almost Walnut Hill! I have a golf cart to cause trouble w/.  Altho only Miss. Kim would know about that ;-)
Almost my birthday!  21....long in coming got a limo for a night of extensive bar hopping.  Come join me :-D

Just killing time till my baby calls me.  He makes me oh so happy!"

"event","<font color=""#008080"">We have had such a crappy rainy spring and now its 94degrees and too hott to do anything.  I rode Tiger at 9:00 tonight cuz it cooled all the way down to 89.  I raised all my jumps for Tiger, we're back on track.  I think we'll be all the way up to 3' soon, which is good considering he is only 14.3 hands (just over 5' at the withers).  He was good and had a surprizing amount of energy.  AlleyCat got her new shoes on her, like magic she's moving gorgeous.  Bird got her special shoes on too, now she's happy so we can go kick ass at WH.  

I'm still looking for a job.  I'm getting desperate, I'm soooo broke.   I had the perfect COOP lined up for Fall in NYC working for the hottest Ad agency in the world, come to find out they can't pay me.  Arg.  Maybe this Paychex one will come thru.    I hope so.

I've been out on the bike everyday to cool down.  It's not engouh....but its running good.  A little loud though, I've  almost been stopped numerous times for the noise when I blast thru town.

The cops have been everywhere.  I've been incredibly lucky lately, stopped 3 times, no tickets.  Phew</font>"

I actually think I'm doing good in all of my classes for once, we'll see once I get my grades back.  And to celebrate I went nuts w/ a VS catalog and a credit card."

"event","Saturday I spent all day in Cazenovia at a Western horse show.  I was Reserve Champion High Point Rider, I even beat the ""Missy Starr"" of western!  Although Katie isn't a stuck up bitch like Missy.  Joanna and I were also Reserve High Point Team, pretty good for just the two of us.  I had lots of fun reining.
On Sunday Pete and I went to the Shrine Circus.  We saw lots of pretty tigers and elephants and a girl shot of a cannon.  Lots of fun, going back to our youth.  Then we had a great dinner and cuddled all night.  
Judy Murray isn't doing well, we might lease her horse, she wants Dreamy to go to a good home and be used.  Mom really wants a good western horse, and this way Gail can focus on the hunter paces and have fun.  A woman is coming to look at Kat, I hope she buys him.  If we sell Kat we could send Gail to Bryan for training to be a reiner.  Hehe wishful thinking. 
Kim has a new 4Wheeler so we can go ramrodding around WH :-D
My computer is still all screwed up.  I'm getting tired of this :-(

I miss my baby."

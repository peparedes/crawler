"event","Been a while. Ooook maybe more then a while....<br />  <br />  But i have been thinking that if i can keep up with it, it maybe a good idea to start again. Mostly for the fact that it kinda lets me vent and and at the end of the day i feel a bit better about things.<br />  <br />  My relationship with my boyfriend is lacking, I'm not sure in what department but it doesn't feel right anymore. <br />  Break up, make up. Break up, make up. The game is getting <b>VERY </b>old.<br />  <br />  It's like we piss each other off so badly that we get to this point that we don't want to put in the effort anymore but then as soon as one of us says some thing like; ""I cant do this anymore...."" We realise, how much we still want to.<br />  <br />  Needless to say....Tom doesn't know about my LJ. We aren't supposed to have any secrets either, so I'm in the wrong here, but when you don't feel like you can talk to the person you are with because your feeling are being validated -- what do you do?<br />  <br />  Talk to them tel them? Tried that, i was told ""I hear every word you say and the ones you don't say....""<br />  Sure you do sweetie.<br />  <br />  <b>LOL </b>- he doesn't think we should talk on the phone anymore....<b>LMAO </b>-- I'm sorry this is too funny to me. But he says that we only fight if we are on the hone with each other and there fore we shouldn't talk on the phone. OK, one if you cant talk on the phone with your boyfriend because it just leads to arguing....lol doesn't that say some thing there? and two, <u><b>AREYOUFUCKINGKIDDINGME</b></u>?! No phone calls? pleeeease."

I have cancelled two doctors appointment since the last one and havent gone to the nutritionist i have an appointment with today. 

I'm reverting back to how i was not too long ago, but only because i'm so busy now and its just so much easier this way (rightnow)

You'd think taht because i'm working 6 days a week i would loose some thing.

My weight fluxuated SO drasticlly between today and yesterday (10 ponds -- no joke!!) that i have no clue what is going on with it anymore.

It truly seems like a loss cause and would be eaiser to just keep on keepin on"

"event","I haven't posted a real post in a while -- so here it is people -- whats been happening with me in no specific order of importance.<br />  <br />  I L-O-V-E working at the Liquor Store!! It's really one of my most favorite jobs so far. Did i say this already? I'm mainly working weekends, Thursday Friday and Mondays right now -- depending. So the days off really suck cause whats there to do and a Tues or a wed night?? Not too much.<br />  <br />  Kristian had msg's me a few times this week and because of the most recent information that i was given AND shown -- you could say i pretty much never want to talk to him (the dirty cheating fucker)again -- BUT -- in all fairness i read the email he sent me and it was in regards to our cat and how he needs to find a place for him to live.<br />  As much as i want Spaz and would like to take him .... Kristian fought so much to keep him and tell me i couldn't have him when i could take him that now i feel like its his responsibility to take care of his situation one his own. I cant have a cat here, I'm not going to go out of my way to take him, or find someone to take care of him.<br />  <br />  Going back to how he makes me feel every time he comes back in to my life ... jump when he says jump do what he wants me to do when he wants me to do it and leave till the next time he wants me or my help again.<br />  <br />  I decided to email him back. Short and to the point, no wishy washy Tori ""I'll see what i can do for you..."" etc etc etc <br />  I re-wrote, re-read, erased, re-typed it up again and again and again, just trying to get it right so i wasn't leaving any doors open for him to say ""but -- "" and sucker me in to whatever he wanted me to do&nbsp; -- cause you ALL know this would happen again if it could. In the end the email was a simple paragraph long, reading only:<br />  <br />
<div>Kristian, <br /> &nbsp;I'm not in a position to take Spaz. Appreciate the offer -- just cant do anything about it. I'm sure you will figure some thing out.<br /> <br /> Tori<br clear=""all"" /></div>
<span class=""sg""><br /></span>Did i do well? Because i feel like i was very assertive and to the point about it.<br />  <br />  So, on another note i have learned something about my self that I'm not too sure how i feel about it.<br />  <br />  I....TREAT....GUYS....BADLY. <br />  <br />  Not guy-friends, or guy family members but guys who are interested in me. From what i am learning about my self i don't trust them at all ... for no particular reason at all when i first meet a guy who is in to me i will not go out of my way to be nice, I'll be a harsher, more upfront version of my self. Kinda of putting them through these little tests till i feel they have passed them.<br />  <br />  This is fucked right up i think.<br />  <br />  Also if you&nbsp; haven't been through some thing in your life -- some sort of hardship\emotional some thing or other or don't have some sort of shell or walls up -- DON'T EVEN TRY!! <br />  <br />  So i cant figure out if I'm looking for a ""Project"" or a boyfriend.<br />  <br />  Jay -- good guy -- treats girls well, doesn't do drugs, barely drinks, good looking, gets along with his family for the most part, kinda knows what he wants to do with his life, I would never have to worry about him cheating on me or hitting or shoving me, dresses well, doesn't treat my family differently cause there kinda crazy -- BUT -- i don't want to be with him, i have decided this for sure now. I don't feel like i can tell him things about my self cause he hasn't really been through anything himself. I don't want to let him in all the way, he would make a good friend but as a boyfriend i cant handle him.<br />  &nbsp;... ACTUALLY i would set up one of my friends with him if they had been treated badly by guys before.<br />  Anyways i was going to talk to him last night about this but i ended up talking with Tyler a not so perfect guy all night instead.<br />  <br />  Priority's Tori Priority's.<br />  <br />  I have been reading Bree's Blog lately ... ha ha ... defiantly makes for a good read. I actually like her out look on a lot of things.<br />  <br />  I found my cell phone ... well no my mom found my cell phone in my Grampas car when i borrowed it. so its back up and running now that i have sorted everything out with Telus and re hooked it up and blah blah blah.<br />  <br />  I went in a talked with my doctor and we discussed the wicked bad things have been doing to try and loose more weight. So we came to the conclusion i might have a problem again ...&nbsp; I know this, i knew this going in that she was going to tell me that i have gone back to how i was about 5-6 years ago. I told her everything -- honestly it felt like a huge weight was lifted because there is no one who knows EVERYTHING about what i have been up to. <br />  Good thing is i turned in everything i was using and have tired to cut back on some of the other things i do.<br />  So far so good -- she let me keep one set of pills i was taking and I'm trying not to abuse them.<br />  The second of August i meet with a specialist.<br />  <br />  Actually i have been looking at that site www.Postsecret.com a lot again and come across so many post cards that could be mine -- its really sad. I'm not sure where that came from lol.<br />  <br />  I BEEEELIVE Cody and Melissa's Birthday party is this weekend ... and i have to work lol sweet eh? Oh well I'm not terribly upset about this, i do however think if anyone is gong to be buying some booze for this event they should defiantly take the extra 4 minutes and come to my store. End of&nbsp; Austin and corner of Mariner -- the huge new Thrifty foods complex&nbsp; -- you cant miss it honestly.<br /><br />Plain White t's songs Hey There Delilha and A Lonely September are pretty wicked songs!! Also Cut -- by Plumb is a good'er too -- kinda EMO-ish though.<br /><br />Ok, i have been talking to this guy named Mike ... he msg'ed me on Nexopia -- i kinda waited him out a bit though -- like didnt know if he was trust worthy or not etc etc etc being his is from online and i STILL dont know how i feel about meeting up with people from the net. <br />But for about 2 months now i have been talking with him on and off and he seems to like to tell me how much he hates shaddy girls and how he hates the hooking up and hangin out and how if i'm in tot hat kinda stuff and just not saying anything it would be best for me to just tell him now so we can get that out of the way&nbsp; -- BEFORE i even said that to him. <br />Anyways i want to know what people think ... Kristin is telling me DO IT-- let him take me out etc etc etc i'm just not sure. you guys tell me what you think.<br /><br />http://www.ratemybody.com/profile.aspx?id=blu21<br /><br />Anyways that's all for now ...."

I hair was hached off and i mean ""Hached "" in the nicest possible way .. i have cried over it so much its silly really. It SO short and i hate it lots.

I need to say sorry to Amy .. I felt like i was being wierd when i saw you at the beer gardens . I wasnt tryingt o i was the sober lead everyone around gal for the night. Had just been to a funeral in the morning and wasnt really feeling the crazyness of it all at that moment.

I went to the beach ... i even wore a bikini in front of people ... i even wore a bikini in front of Jake ... i ove Jake i think. But its more a silly wow hes cute i like him kinda way -- this will pass.

Jay shaved his head like SHAVED his head like shiny shave ... i hate it i think. But i cant say too much cause my hair is so fucking short now, and he is suppotying me on it.

I saw Rob at the gardens theni heard Rob tel his gf i love you theni heard Rob tell me he couldnt even remember her name then i left Rob because as much as i love him to death i hate those guys who do that. I am REALLYdissapointed by him.

"event","I .... ate .... a whole bag of chips today.

&nbsp;And not a small one ... just saying. 

And where i know i shouldn't have because for 1) the way i'm going to feel about myself for the next few days because of it AND 2) cause you just shouldnt eat a whole HUGE bag of chips to your self in such a small time spand -- it was soooooo worth it.

NOT only did i eat the whole bag myself, i didnt go and be like ""Ok i'm going to eat the whole bag BUT i'm going to eat only the baked, plain, no salt, tastes like carboard type of chips cause its better for me"" 
Hell no i had smokey bacon -- no joke. 

Go big or go home -- if your gonna do it do it right, it a huge effing bag of chips i'm eating i might as well enjoy them right?

I also did it sitting watching TV on the floor in the living room where i had planned on doing some streching -- that didnt happen.

My dad came here today to cut the lawn and walk in while i was down there and kinda looked but then didnt, like he saw what i was doing and took a mental note and was surpised but tried not to act like he saw anything let aloone that he was.

Lmao thats when i kinda clicked in and was like WHOA i ate the whole thing pretty much and decidd to keep going anyways.

Needless to say when he was asking about grocerys he should pick up for us i said PLEASE PLEASE only buy things that are wrapped seprate or in smaller luch kinda packs. He gets me. 

Are my entrys just really retarded?? Haha. I'm not sure what to think here.

Anyways about 4 and a half hours later and i only just thought about it again when i started to type this out, this is pretty much amazing for me.

I have serious food issuse that i need to deal with -- i know this."

"event","I'm having a moment. Like i know i usally have moments but ones like this only come every once in a while. 

It's totally here right now.

Ok so Monday i was sitting on the floor in the middle of my room, just out of the shower, still wraped in my towel, balling my eyes out. 
And it wasnt really anything then, just like stress had finally gotten to me and things i have been putting on a back burner cause its not a good day to deal with them and trying to ignor in hope of it going away instead all came out.
I was kinda just standing in the shower thinking about how i'm not happy right now, and lookit for the possitive in things, has just worn me out totaly. This salon isnt getting anwhere with the school, i'm not sure i i should look for some thing else or not work wise in risk of messing things up for the REAL job i want and have ben given. the waiting game is getting to me really, constantly waiting it feels like and never really moving forward.
Fuck.
&nbsp;i needed to have a big cry. Kristin phonned me around the same time i was balling my eyes out and being my friend since like forever and ever told me to pack up a BIG bag (Big means more then an over night'er bag) cause she was coming to&nbsp; get me  

Things just arent great at my place rightnow either so the exscape was totally welcomed.

So i took off, i told my sister i was leaving i just didnt say whe i was going to be back and i left. i wasnt really sure when i was coming back anyways to why put more guild lines on things that really didnt need any.

i came home today and my dad was here AGAIN. Always here never goes to his own house it feels like. So we pretty much didnt say anything to each other the whole time till Amy got home.

I hate being the bitter girl in the house the one who doesnt want to do things with her family -- i love my family -- really. 

It not even them i guess its just everything.

I have presures from every which way in my life adn i'm not sure what direction i'm going in at this moment and i'm just so fucking stressed out i wantt o comit my self so the nut house ... just saying.

On another note i came home to find my email was over flowing and scrolling down i got to the email from Kristian telling me about some chick named Jenna who he is going out with now.

Hey ... Fuck you.

I'm not sure why this bugs me so much but it does, and it should i know but it does. I had bf's before he had anyone i have gone out with and broken up with people all before he found this girl and STILL it hurts me.

I'm wondering if i should have taken Lisa up on the moving to Kamloops idea.

Please ignor this one its really just for me to vent. 

its like being stuck in the same spot and watching everything go by and wanting to move so badly but you cant."

"event","So Kristin owes me about 240$ at this VERY moment for babysitting she actually really almost screwed me over bad cause i needed that money for the vernon trip and she kept telling me yes yes yes and never came through so i had to borrow 100$ from my dad and go up there with way less money then planned.

Another thing i have to go out out there and sleep there all the time cause its just easier on them, not so easy o me ... i baby sit for her for 4 days and i'm there for like 6 i never sleep in my own bed anymore ... fuck.

&nbsp;Well i made plans to go and do a joint with Bry and Sher and then Kristin calls me and TELLS ME ... doesnt even ask if she can just tells me shes going to be picking me up on her way home instead of later on .... ok ... so i msg Sher and dtich AGAIN!! 

So now i'm grumpy and she comes here and shes telling me how she just bought this portable dvd player for Makayla ... hmmm going for around 250$ 

Weird eh? 

So i get up enough balls to say ""Oh yea and you couldnt pay me for the babysitting though?""

And i cant even rememebr what she said but it was like like this ""ppffffffffft"" so i waslike dude i REALLY need that money i owe everyone some thing and i hate being like this and shes like well i definalty dont have it now Tori in this fuck off tone. 

So we arent talking now and i'm just sitting there and were driving in pure a total awkwardness AND SHE TELLS ME bout these fucking pants shes going to buy tomorrow 

WTF?!?!

REALLY?!?!

So i say you know what i have no problem watching Mac when you can pay me till then i cant ... tak eme home please.

And now i'm home and my bf hates me and i hate her right this second andi'm not sure if i blew it out of porportion or not

"event","Did i mention that i went to the mall with Kristin a few days ago to help my little sister to pick out a grad dress and while i was there and sitting in the food court waiting for Bry and Sher. I saw Colin go up the stairs with his friend Mark. <br /><br />So not gonna lie, i pretty much DIVED under the table haha no joke like full out tuck and hide. <br /><br />So after my sister and Kristin reasured me that it was ok to get out from under the table (i kid i kid)  i needed to explain to them that he was an ex. An evil one at that, who ... hmmmm ... how do i put this nicely -- FUCKING HATES ME!! like blocked me from his msn, took for ever to get my stuff back from him cause he refused to see me, tried to steal MY friends from me after i broke up with him, stares me down if he actually sees me, pretty much makes me feel like the most usless thing on earth hence why i tuck and dive now when i see him.<br /><br />Alright so thats who he is and i thought he hadnt seen me up un till today when i got an email from him that&nbsp; said that i gave him a ""look"" that i guess in his fucked up little buble means ""CALL ME"" cause he was asking for my new cell number ""cause my old one wasnt in service anymore"" -- haha not only that -- he said ""must have been disconected"" just for the added effect of it all - prick i actually moved away. <br /><br />Anyways i sent him an email with my new number STUPID STUPID ME and he must have been sitting right beside his computer cause two seconds later my cell was ringing.<br />&nbsp;<br />So <span class=""cosmoblogpost"">We started off with the ""How are you's"" and ""How's it going's"" -- all that bullshit stuff. Then he gave me rapid questions like, ""Why'd you stop speaking to me?"", ""Why weren't you picking up my calls?"". Then just like that, he went for the punch! ""Why are you such a very high maintenance person?"" Believe me, that wasn't the first time I heard that. I know how to answer this nowt, so, in a very straight up tone I said , ""<strong>Because I can!</strong>"".<br /><br />Yes! It's probably one of the reasons why I cannot maintain a relationship. But, just like everything in my life, I have an excuse. A valid one, too! Yes, I demand things. But that doesn't mean you cannot say ""no"". God did not just give you those balls as decoration for your manhood, right? Sure! I'm a bitch! But is that a reason for you to lie to me <em>just</em> to please me? And then when you get upset, you tell me that I'm high maintenance and I can't always have my way?! Why didn't you just tell me that in the first place? I'm the easiest person to please in the world! On a good day, you didn't even have to explain things to me twice and I'll agree right away. Beneath the bitchy front is actually a very submissive person, believe it or not.</span><br /><br />Anyways theres my rant for the day ... or my second one."

"event","I hate mothers day and i hate my mom right now. Just saying.
&nbsp;
So first of all she wasnt even there when we went there to see her&nbsp; -- did i mention that i didnt want to go in the first place cause we arent getting along at the moment? Annnnd i had Playland plans

She honeslty wouldnt even care if we went there or not as long as we called her -- right?

Its all about making hte effort

This would be why i gave my mothers day card to my sister to give her this morning thinking i could get outta going but no that just lead to a huge fight with my dad.

Why is my dad on her side? he hates her more then me -- if anyone should understand it should be him.

I probably sound really cold hearted here ... but honeslty you would have to understand the retardedness of my mom ...

So yea she wasnt even there when we got there and i wanted to leave so i called her and she was having a ""few"" drinks with her friend ... -- few = 20 or so ...

So yea we wait around for her ... she finally gets home and hte first thing she says to me is ... your gaining weight this is good ... you know what good to you ='s bad for me mom thanks -- fuck.

Then i leave the room waving my hand at her like ""Shut up"" and she tells my sister that i look orange i should stop eating carrotts ...&nbsp; 

UM WHAT?!

Lmao ... its not like i'm rubbing them all over my body ... gawd.

Needless to say my dad gave me and my sis the option to stay and have my mom take us home later or we could leave with him and go home -- we chose to leave with him .. obviously.

Man if she could just sober up a bit we might be able to have something here .. 

Anyways i told her i was leaving for Vernon for a week on wed and she gave me this look of ""oh my god"" haha everytimei go to Vernon she thinks i wont come back ... she told me to stay away from Kristian -- she said DONT go near him Tori -- hes bad for you ... so maybe she knows a thing or two ... just saying though i wasnt planning on being around him ,,, he doesnt even live there - had she listened to me the last time i told her this she might have known this.

I bought a floofie girly white kinda pesent knee length skirt yesterday cause i loved it even though Kristin tol dme that i wouldnt like it today ... she was right i actually cant figure out why i liked it so much yesterday ... 

there goes 30$ i dont have on nothing AGAIN i'm so good at this."

Listen to this SHIT!!

Like i'm doing a good job of ""pretending"" to not care about it. I'm not pulling a total Tori here and obsessing over it. i was actually finding other things to&nbsp; think about durning the day.

But then ..... he msg's me on Msn yesterday and being all cool like and acting VERY natural like nothing happened. 

Then he gets in to the kinda sex stuff that he jokes with me about ... and i'm thinking ok did he just NOT get what i was meaning? or is he not caring about it? or is he just not gonna pay attention to what i said maybe?

Ok, he can play it cool i can too -- this is no biggie at all.

So i'm going with the talk for a bit but hes then saying things like ""So why are you too busy to see me?"" and ""when do i get Tori time"" etc etc etc 

And now i'm like :S oooook .. what does he want from me really? so i just ask him straight up .. best way to be about it i thought and he said ""I want to hangout wtih you .. and if it works out i want a gf&nbsp; out of it""

WHOA!! 

WAIT!!

GIRLFRIEND WHAT?!

I thought i said ... to him .... lol ... the other day ... i cant see this working out&nbsp; No? that was me right? i did say it out side of my head no and type it ou fro you on msn i thought.

Fuck .. so now i'm like GREEEEAT

And now he thinks he has an in -- right. so he tell me how much of an idiot he thinks dave is and how he thinks hes such a tool and all this stupid shit. So i say ""ok be nice and just drop it ok"" and for about umm 15 minutes he does but then its back to the hate-ing on Dave comments so i think ok this is the time ... if theres gonna be anytime to do it this is it ..

And i tell him again -- this is not gonna work out. 

Now he hates me and i tried to text him and say can we be friends still and he told me ""You said this wouldnt work out"" and then i texted back whate er you want then i just hought friends would work and he said ""Cant be friends if you wont hangout with me"" and that was it&nbsp; ... and i cried to Dave about it last night and Dave said he was sorry for whatever his part in it was etc etc etc.
And i told him no it was fine it wasnt him

But then today i guess Nathan looked at Daves nex page and so dave sent him a childish msg saying ""Hey you fucked it up with a good girl and how bout you stop looking at my page buddy"" 

SO NOW Nathan is going to think i am saying HE fucked up some how and it wasnt even that ... 

I need to sit in a drama free zone for a few minutes here ... i'm going to hide in the bath room."

"event","Cupid called ... he said to tell you to give me back my fucking heart!!

I told Nathan yesterday that i didnt see this going anywhere. I was totally lying to him ... i just felt forced in to picking between him and my friend Dave -- whome at the time, Nathan, was calling a ""fucker"" for the most rediculous reason. 
I was trying to stick up for Dave ... he has been my friend since i was 14. He has ""saved"" me so many times from lots of bad situations like my dad's rage, drunk step dad, bad bf's .... even my self some times, and while i kow hes not the greatest person, he still my friend and has been there for me. So at the least i can stick up for him. 
And on top of that -- i'd like to think i'm the kind of person who IF Dave was doing some thing to deserve being called all those shitty names, i would be able to admit to it and i would say so myself. 
Anyways, Nathan pretty much hates me right now ... and i'm pretending it doesnt bother me.

Someones got to be the crazy cat lady no? Might as well be me.

Did i mention i dyed my hair? WELL i sure did ... i cut and colored Kristins hair a few days ago and i mixed WAY too much hair color so after she left i was like ""Hmmmmmm ... i wonder?"" and decided that i need to color my hair too. I really need to stop getting the ""urge"" to do things to my hair like; cut it by my self and color it by my self -- i'm a hair dresser but honeslty not good enough to do my own hair ALL on my own haha. Thats just asking for trouble.
But yes, it's dark -- like -- the darkest brown you could go without being black, haha fuck yea.

Anyways, at this VERY moment ... i look alright with it. Only cause i'm sporting the Cultus Lake tan from a few days ago still.

So i'm a dark haired blue eyed tanned beauty at the moment and loving it.

Say it with me people .... LOOOOOOOOVING it.

So i got these diet pills ... from Super Store .... i talked to the Pharmacist and she told me about what the better ones are and what they do to your body blah blah blah. Problem -- i REALLY hate it when you ask someone about some thing that they obviously DONT think you should be doing and you have to pretty much drag the infomation out of them. Like Fuck off REALLY.
So yea there pretty cheap ... or cheap enough at least. Herbal. Reccomended. Supplement-ing. And proven to work.
Only thing is -- and i'm not totally sure here if its them or my cold but i think they may make me a bit sick, just cause about an hour later i feel kinda dizzy, cant move my head to fast or i get this i'm gonna puke feeling. I'm giving them a chance though.
The bottle says do NOT take more then 4 a day --2 in the morning then 2 more a few hours later and DONT ever take them at night.
I wonder why ....?

HAHAHAHA OK speaking of PUKE ... lol. I was watching Makayla the past week ... shes 3 i LOVE her to death. She was feeling really sick and yea she started to throw up while i was there. So shes crying and she has puked A LOT for her size, and i'm trying to tell her its ok dont worry just puke and then you can have a bath and some meds and i'll wash your bedding. So she calms down a bit and i'm like ""Do you feel better now Mac?"" and she like ""yeeeea ...... "" 

BLEH 

Pukes all over me!! No joke. Let me tell you -- theres really nothing better then getting puked on by a crying 3 year old haha. Yuck.

Another thing -- she really spoilt ... like has everything possibal. So shes in her room watching a DVD on her flat screen -- lol -- no joke. and She says ""i NEEEEEEEEEED a drink"" and i'm kinda like pffft haha ""How do you ask nicely...?"" and she come to the living room and is like ""I need a drink Wood teeth"" 

LMFAO. WOOD TEETH WHAT?! Lol

So called her Hamster Brain. 

Later on when Kristin got home Mac was like ""Tori calls when i throw up -- PUKING"" and then told Kristin ""No thank you Hamster Brain"" and ratted me out for letting her stick her finger in the Nuttella. Hahahaha good times.

So my friends Phill and Chad who i went to elemen. and high school with and havent talked to -- let alone hung out with since the last time i moved home haha asked me if i wanted to go to Roosters last ween some time and i said yes but then didnt go. Well i havent seen these guys in so LONG and Phill sent me some pictures of them from that night and i should kick myself in the ass cause they are smoking now!! and looked like they had so much fun!! Hahaha, not like anything could happen but still ... whoa boys :P. 

I'm going to try and figure out the picture thing for on here again and post the best one of the two of them.

Wish me luck."

Like WHOA!!

I mean i know what i ment but did you guys get it at all? Haha ... obviously Sher did cause she comment'ed me :D 

So new rule no getting baked then writting LJ's and not at least re-reading them before i post..

My mom is REALLY good at being a BITCH some times. Man some times i get this urge to hit her .... i wouldnt really -- i dont act like that haha BUT shes worse then me on the grudge holding. 
Today is my sisters last play night at Best and i really wanted to see her work cause 1). Shes 16 and has pretty much been spending all her free time working on this play and is super proud of her self... 2). She asked me if i would come and see it and 3). When Kristin and i went out to Cultus to sun tan for the day ... we saw a poster for it all the way out there and thats effing cool for sure. AND 4) IT'S GREASE DUDE what would be better then that?! 
Anyways the small part of me thats in a bad mood today will balme it on my moms cause shes stupid. Lol.
I really had to hold back when she said to me ""Can you try and see things from my point of view VICTORIA ...."" in this snotty i'm you mom and have spoken tone. I wanted to say ""Well i WOULD but i cant get my head that far up my ASS mom!!""
Anyways I decided against it ..probably for the best if i ever want to use her truck again.
&nbsp;
Wow so i'm sick .. like i cant breath at all,&nbsp; my voice is gone, i kinda look all pale and creepy sick .... I had to use Kristians trick last night when your trying to sleep and you cant cause you cant breath so you lock yourself in the bathroom and blast the shower with only hot water so it gets super steamy in there and your nosey runs TONS and you can blow it till it hurts but is finally clear -- trick ... Cant breath today though lol.

Ummm talked to so i talked to Nathan last night he msg'd me on msn and he asked me what i wanted a picture of ... lol idiot ... YOU!! Man ... 
He said he fell asleep ...i told him ""oldest one in the book"" (Next to ""Whats you sign of course hahahahahahaha Sher gets me in this) and then he asked me again if i wanted a picture and i said nope i was over it ... all he said was ""ouch"" 

Even Steven buddy -- sucks eh?

However once i stopped the minda games(and i know i need to grow up but its just SO effing hard some times) ... i told him i thought he was boycotting cause i got looser drunk, and called him etc ... he said no it was totally fine -- it didnt bother him at all he laughed at the msg and he thinks we are funny.

OH MY GAAAAAWD!! THIS JUST IN!! TOTALLY FORGOT!!

He asked me for a hair cut last night .... i'm so excited to say what i'm about to say here ... like butterflies excited -- you dont even know&nbsp; ... BUT ... he ... has ... a ... FAUX HAWK!!

Ok ok have i EVER wrote in here before about how much i LOOOOOVE faux hawks? like really? i must have cause i'm obsessed and have been forever&nbsp; man .... 

He better be all i'm building him up to be ... just saying.

I wish he would do a joint with me then he would go from super great to amazing really fast."

"event","Uh, i just got super baked with Dave .. i told him that on the super potentianl of being baked i was only about a 4 out of 10 in comparison to Bry and Sher he said lets smoke out of the Bong ... i'm scared of them again -- i honestly had to talk my self down AGIAN -- like ""Your ok your ok your ok"" 

MAN ... weaksauce.

Ok so my header is retarded .. i know this ...&nbsp; -- i'm ising being baked as a excuse though.

Maple Ridge is good ... Theres too much to write at this moment in time though about it.

I ment (Sher) that you and Bry just remind me of the ""Good"" times with Kristian ... actually ... Bry reminds me of him ... i htinki might have to kill him .. just saying.

OK CREEPY hahahaha sorry.

Erin is dead right about me wanting Kristian to feel how i felt or feel .. like how IS IT that he just cant care as much as me? or even close to as much as me? a little bit? comeon now ...
How is it that he freaks out and cries -- YES KRISTIAN CRIES!! and calls me and wants to talk to me for hours about is f-ing problems and gets all depressed on me and fuck ... crashes his CAR cause i'm having a good time and still he doesnt care.
This sounds bad i know .. i men obviously he cares -- so why is it so hard to see this ... him i mean .. how come he cant see this.
Over all -- i want him to be happy .. just saying no matter how many times i have cried over him or how many relationships he has messed up for me by calling over and over AGAIN (idiot) i want him to be happy in the end of it all.

So get this .. starting about a week ago or so Nathan and i didnt talk ata ll i left it all up to him thinking i was a complet Tequila totin drunking party chick ...&nbsp; texted him once ... then twice ... then threetimes and then texted him the fourth time saying ""I'm upset about this but whatever you want .."" THINKING he was ignoring me. Can i just add in here that i usaly talk to him EVERYDAY so to not toalk to him either online or the phoine or texting is REALLY weird ... so i'm over him as of yesterday .. and i say this cause i didnt think about him more then 2 all day .... TILL ... he texted me saying ""Hey i have been camping for the past week -- whats witht he sad messages?""

I AM AN IDIOT.

So i text him back and tell him exsactly what i though and he doesnt text me theni text him oand ask him what hes doing ... nothin .. then i ext hi and ask him if he gets picturea nd RIGHT AWAY Hes like ""Are you sending me one"" and i say ya and then i send him a pic and i say send me one ... nothing .. FUCK ... text hm again say this is retarded i hate selective texting .. still nothing .. THEN call him .. no answer leave him an msg ... 

Some one tell me what the fuck is going on here -- i mean REALLY -- WHAT IS GOING ONE HERE?!


(oh and just so people dont thinki'm som crazy obsessive texter all thouse texts either happened ver a week spand of time or hours .. not all close together)

I'm giving up .. you dont talk to me your not worth my time just saying.

Theres your warning -- i'm so done with games. 

Ps i'm better by my self anyways.

"event","I going to be in M.R for a bit ... a few days or so. Easier to get to work, which the excit0ment has passed from now and my dad hates so i'm considering not doing it anymore ... but thats a whole diffrent topic.

Anyways i need to get my ass in gear OBVIOUSLY this work out contrapshion my dad bought me is no good ... i'll still use it but i dont notice anything and i have been busting my ass for like 3 and a bit weeks now&nbsp; .. anyways 
I'm so off topic here i should start over ...

So i'm going to Maple Ridge today cause Kristin and i are going rolling blading and my work is right by her house and we want to dye our hair and we want to do a fake tan ... WELL NO -- hahaha she does i'm too scared to try that again&nbsp; -- so i'm not gonna. 

But yea i'll be in M.R for a night or two at the most so miss me bitches

Yesterday i have to say was fun lol .... 

At the end there i was just retarded ... i dont think i have been that baked in ... umm forever ... like i couldnt even think about what i wanted at DQ and i get the same fucking thing ever time i go there!! i blame Sher and Bry ...again lol.

They say dont be weak .... i cant not be weak ...

So side note here -- yesterday Ostafew ( ... hmm sp?) asked me if i liked Vancouver and i said ""I LOVE IT!!"" and Bry said ""Nooo she always says she only likes it cause we are here..""&nbsp; Have to say thats whole the truth -- all my LJ's would probably be about me hating on Van if it wasnt for them lol. Just saying.

Ok but yea so Ostafew ... packs like a girl lol ... and Bry was picking him up from tha airport lol and he had so much big stuff lol that Bry and Sher were cramed up front and there was this huge and i mean HUUUUGE box across the back of the back seat floor lol .. man i cant even explain this properly .. over all me and Ostafew had to sit kinda side ways and bent up and Bry and Sher were smused in the front in order to get all his big shit in the car hahaha.

Went to dinner with Couch and Ostafew Sher adn Bry at Pita Pit ummm probably my new favoreit place to eat .. it was so good, 

I feel like i eat all the time now ... 

Moving on 

But yea they talk aboutt he ""smartest"" shit ever like who talks about lasers for fun .... ?! these guys i guess. I was kinda sitting there trying to focus but it all sounded the same to meso i looked at the dollar store deals out side :P

Man those two smoked me up AGAIN before i got home and my sister was here LMAO and i went in and she was making pizza and i pretty much fought with myself in front of her before she said oh shut up youur RIPPED EAT A PIECE OF PIZZA!i decided i was going to have a peice of pizza

Pita Pit, m&amp;m's, slurpee ... some of Bry fries Blizzard and a piece of pizza -- i should have decided to be bulimic today instead of roller blading.

I was kinda sad last night cause i was thinking that Bry and Sher are JUST how me and Kristian used to be ... hmm no freaking out here you guys :P your better -- but still. 
Like over all they seem like how we used to act and with all his shit and him being away and yea his drama i have kinda maybe been worriing abouth im again and wondering how he has been doing etc ...&nbsp; leading me up to the beginings of missing him agian .. and wondering why he calls me all the time and tells me all his effing problems and why he emails me and tells me all his EFFING PROBLEMS if he hates me so much ...and this is where i punch myself in the box and say YOUR AN IDIOT TORI !! STOP IT!!

Stop caring about him -- RIGHT NOW! 

I havent ever really gon&nbsp; more then a month with out seeing him you know .. not even after he broke up with me and i moved here he still came here and he still told people he had to get me and i still saw him and well whatever right ... its just a weird feeling.

But yea i was thinking there is so much more here in Van why would he have not wanted to move here when i asked him if he would&nbsp; ... ? I think we could be a prety effing cool group me Sher Bry and Kristian had things all worked out -- anyways i'm being retarded agian . So i'm just gonna stop this shit before it gets carried away.

Like who does this really?! who thinks about some one who has treated them so badly just cause they can get what they want from them??? Probably sone one who thought this person was the ""one"" 

Idiot.

I wish things were diffrent thats all&nbsp; ...."

Was supposed to be at work till about 4 but the girl who was going to be showing me the ropes didnt show up haha maybe she had one of ""Those"" nights too -- lol. <br /><br />Ok ok, so it like amazing out today ... it's supposed to be like this for the whole week too. Kristin and i have big plans to go to White Rock on Wed or Thursday, go to the pier there, do some roller blading probably ... some thing like this. <br /><br />Cross your fingers the weather stays nice fr us i want to be a bit of a sun burn -- hahahahaha that makes me think of my fake tanning catastrophy.<br /><br />Also my little sister has been busting her ass for her school play like every night she isnt home till about 1130 12, she goes to school on bot saturday and sunday setting up for this, when your in grade 11 thats pretty intence i'd say. So yea i told her i would get soeoe to go with me to it on Thursday ... its Grease too so like whos not gonna want to go really?<br /><br />I really need to color my hair ... like really fucking bad i'm so torn between buying a box and just doing it or waiting it out and having it done with the professional stuff ... meh. <br /><br />I'm cutting my own hair today i cant stand it anylonger i need more layers and my bangs need to be fixed up lol it just has to be done people and i think i'm the girl to do it &nbsp; ... <br /><br />My sister didnt hide the Tequila too well apparently.I saw the bottle this morning when i walked in to my brothers bed room and i remembered the smell and taste of it all over again and started to feel kinda queasy again.<br /><br />However, i am, feeling quite chipper today ... weird eh .. like i'm kinda pumped today for some unknown reason, ready to go and do some thing .. anything really ... too bad i'm plan-less today :(<br /><br />I should shower and work out ... or work out THEN shower -- better idea.<br /><br />Haha Nathan called me yesterday ... as soon as i answered he was just like ""WEIRD-O"" i THINK he maybe was refering to the long msg Sher and i left him .. or maybe it could have been the second one i left him when i got home telling him i was about to pass out and some thing about having a bucket :S<br /><br />Never .... again .. will ... i ... drink ... THAT .. much .... Tequila!!<br /><br />I called so many people that night. Heres a little list; Nathan i dunno how many times, Colin - same thing, Kristin - too many times to even count lol but shes my bestest buddy so its ok, Jordan twice, my MOM ... dont ask cause i'm not even sure what i was thinking lol, Melissa and aparently HER friend Carriea (?!) and Dave twice. Sweet eh? yup i'm and IDIOT, but then there was the texting -- someone actually texted me today saying ""Who is this you kept texting me saturday night!"" No clue whos number it is. *shrugs* oh well <br /><br />So TWO new rules then .. 1).Tequila is NOT your friend no matter how much fun it is .. and 2). Tori does NOOOOOOT get a phone when shes drunk.<br /><br />All in good fun though right, i mean it doesnt happen very often any more so i dont feel super bad ... more emberassed then anything -- maybe bad for Bry. I do remember asking him some thing about us and then him telling me no we were more annoying then anything. Good thing he is so patcient.<br /><br />Anyways i should head off here try and be productive at least for a little bit today.<br /></div>"

"event","Man i want to tell everyone how incredibaly fun last night was in just about every witty way i can ... but ... i'm feeling exspecially dumb at the moment due to the massive hangover i'm nursing.

Tequila ... i thought was my friend up untill this point but its really not anymore, no matter how much fun it is i might have to cut myself off from it for a while. I even had to get my sister to move it from the floor beside my bed cause everytime i looked at the bottle i could remember how it smells and tastes and uuuuh not good.

Definalty gonna be one of those nights that i'm going to be remembering things from it through out the week.

I woke up this morning with my clothing and one of my shoes still on my purse up on my shoulder my pants undone like i had the right idea about changing my hair in a ponytail and one finger one the bucket so i knew it was close enough to me if i needed it.

Man ... lol THAT would have been a good picture i bet

Anyways it was FUCKING fun!! Over all ... and when i say that i really mean aside from the Tequila spins and the puking in the bath room at the club hahahahaha and the teatering dancing -- damn big shoes and drunk girls ... it was SO much fucking fun. Just what i needed.

There was a guy ... with a bottle lol ... who was walking around and Sher came and got me and was like ""YOU MISSED THE GUY GIVING FREE SHOTS!!"" and then took me over to him. Ummmm also there was a guy ... i thought was a guy ... with a mullet ... who i pointed at and said ""THERES A MULLET!!"" but even though i was so drunk and couldnt focus enough to see Sher saved me and told me it was actually a girl with her hair hafl pulled up ... i was ready to say some ting baout readnecks and mullets i know it.

Fuck.

Oh and i looked at my phone to see all the calls i made or i got or the texts i made\got ... lol and there were a fucking lot i think i called everyone i knew ... i THINK lmfao Sher and i called Nathan and left him a msg in the bathroom too .. actually i know we did.

I texted him and said i'm sorry for how retarded i got and all the texting and phonning ... nothing back from him though :( i'm trying not to read in to this too much 

Man i cant belive i puked at the bar ... 

Ummm Melissa didnt show up .. lol we went out side though to meet her and Sher went out the smoking room fire exit hahahahaha i remember this much caue i was thinking .. were are we going and then was like ""YOU WENT OUT THE FIRE EXIT"" and laughed like an idiot in front of all the bouncers ... oh i just remembered Mel drove by and we waved to her i think ....

I got home last night and Bry yells to me to as i'm walking from the car to ""act natural"" cause my dad was sleeping here and OF COURSE i walk in and he's still awake watching tv and and on the phone with one of his gf's SO i'm the smart one here right? lol so i ask him to get me a bucket and he's like ""Your gooned, i can tell by the stupid smile on your face"" so i tried to NOT smile and he just looked at me as he handed me the bucket and was like ""Yea not working ..."" and shook his head and laughed at me.

Fuck.

I was reading some of the texts i sent ... lol and there this one to Kristin after she asked me if i was drunk and this is EXSACTLY what it said ....""i""ndofdrunjkin drunk"" I'm not sure what it ment lol

ALSO SHER SENT ME ONE WHILE I WAS WITH HER THAT SAID&nbsp; ""your drunk you skank hoe"" !!! 

LMFAO.

Anyways i'm supposed to be at work ... umm my second day at that ... and&nbsp; ... well i'm not haha MAN... this is not a good start. I cant even really remember what i said to Dr.V this morning but it must have been ok because he said ""ohoh no problem at all Tori -- it was kinda short notice anyways""

But yea i'm going back to get in to bed here .. i still have the crappy i could puke at any minute feeling ... i'm so weaksauce its emberassing.

I think i threw my phone alot too last night ... 

I had so much fun though it was awesome."

His options.<br /><br />More arguing .. he tries to scre me a bit with how bad they are for me -- not scaring me buddy i know they work like wicked cool,&nbsp; tells me the other doctors are nuts for prescribing me them etc etc etc <br /><br />HE WONT DO IT!!<br /><br />So i'm pisssssssssssssed now and i'm like ""Ok so if your NOT gonna do that then what CAN you tell me to take?"" and you know what he says?<br /><br />Bastard ... <br /><br />""My advice for you is to loose 10 - 15 pounds, try working out you'll be happier, drink water, i have no ""magic"" pill for you to take""<br /><br />Little does he know that i have been busting my ass working out .. i have boosted up my workout to 2 -- YES people 2 fucking hours a day!! i have stopped eating carbs for the most part again .. i have been doing some other things as well.<br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />Never good enough.<br /><br />So now i go and tell him about my ear ... but i'm already hating him and giving him ""the look"" if you get me here and i say in this tone i know i had .. <br /><br />""OK SO my ear then ... i cant hear out of it"" and he says to me <br /><br />""WEll maybe you just dont want to..."" and smiles this fucking hahai can play your game too smile.<br /><br />I was like ""Yea i'm trying to weed out all the bullshit i hear from now on with NOT being able to hear out of this ONE ear"" <br /><br />So yea i have a hate-HATE relationship with this effing doctor now .. <br /><br />The whole way to Superstore cause we were on the other side of Coquitlam .. my dads trying to cheer me up and i'm telling him -- like forget it ... just fuck off ... stop telling mi'm fine stop telling me he doesnt know cause i know .. you dont know dad -- nothing is going to make me feels better ... just LEAVING IT. <br /><br />I want to be mad abou t his and think about it and work on a&nbsp; diffrent plan and now my dad is trippin off balls thinking whatever he is thinking. <br /><br />Grocery shopping with him afterwards was not fun ... like who wants to buy food when there told they need to loose up to 15 pounds ... THATS ALOT OF POUNDS PEOPLE!! <br /><br />I looked at the pounds of butter while i was waiting or my dad to get milk ... 15 of those fucking blocks would be 15 pounds ... that is so much. How do i do this?<br /><br />Fuck. <br /><br />I'm so mad.<br /><br />Anyways .. i call Kristin and cried to her .. she gets me .. she understat i go through ona daily basis and even though she doesn tlike it she wil help&nbsp; me so we are now on a mission to wal mart and i'm spending all the money ihave left to get these other diet\curb your appy pills. <br /><br />I hate me right now.</strong>"

"event","So ""<strong>TBS</strong>"" time is pretty much my favorite thing EEEEEVA!! I was harbering some really good<em> ""I secretly hate Vancover"" </em>feelings again there for a bit, but hanging out with Sher and Bry makes them go away -- i have <strong>REAL </strong>peeps that i like to chill with!! <br /><br />Fuck yea!!<br /><br />Ok so high point ... lol actually all of it was pretty much a ""high point"" hahaha but was when i said <em>""<strong>THE PARAMOUNT!</strong>""</em> and Bry was like <em>""Oh duals -- on Thursday we should go"" </em>and were all like<em> ""Yea!!""</em> then i said some thing about how its the only place that is under age (MEANING you can be 18 to see naked chicks but have to be 19 to drink there) and then Bry like<em> ""what?""</em> and then he clues in to it being a srippers!! <br /><br />Hahahahahaha oh my god was so funny ... i thought i had Sher with me on the going too -- lol Bry Bry Bry. Too funny.<br /><br />But yea 218 flavors are <strong>REALLY </strong>all that they could have been ... i was really dissapointed with the <strong>HOT PINK</strong> dragon fruit ice cream though .. <strong>HOT PINK</strong> you'd thik it would be like <strong>SO </strong>good no? well yea good thing Sher and Bry said try it first cause it was sick and tasted like mush rotten fruit smells -- buh.<br /><br />
<div align=""center"">Lesson for the night -- <strong>TRY EVERYTHING FIRST.</strong><br /></div>
<br />Ummmm i'm going to Super store today and picking up a application ... i have to get back on the saddle so to say .. this is retarded sitting around thinking about what i want to do and making no action towards it. <strong>GAY</strong>. <br /><br />I need to buy an umbrella haha i just thought about if i get a job there and walking over there in the rain ... :S i hate getting my hair wet -- fuck Vancouver and its rainy days. Booooo.<br /><br />Two nights ago Derek took everything to a <strong>HUGE </strong>extreme, like bitched me out on msn so badly i cried, said the most horibal things to me cause he's a dick, phoned me over and over again till i stoped answering my phone after i blocked and deleted him on my msn, then when i stoped answering my phone he texted me more shitty nasty things ... <br /><br />
<div align=""center""><strong>GUYS....NEED....TO....GROW....UP</strong>. Just Saying.<br /></div>
&nbsp;<br />Some how he took me saying i <strong>DIDNT </strong>want to see him and i <strong>DIDNT </strong>want to <strong>FUCK </strong>him and i <strong>DIDNT </strong>want to go out with him&nbsp; and switched it to  me wanting him and him turning me down ... <br />I pretty much laughed my ass off at him and was like <strong>WHAT</strong>?! causing this whole tidel wave of other shit to happen.<br /><br />
<div align=""center"">Copy and Pasting for you to see some of the wonderful things this ass had to say to me .... <br /></div>
<br />
<div align=""center""><strong><em>Derek says:<br />enjoy your meaningless life oh and by the way if ya dont wanna be broke get a REAL fuking job - you'll make nothing as a hair dresser a wise man told me that one time thought id pass it alone<br />Derek says: <br />haha your sick did you think that ACTUALLY wanted anytihng from you? i said that cause i could and you took it for real and you think YO turned me down?!<br />Derek says:<br />hahhahahahahahahhahahaha ya right<br />Derek says:<br />come on now<br />Derek says:<br />&nbsp;grow up tori and realize really<br />Derek says: <br />you make my day and make me laugh all at the same time </em><br /></strong></div>
<br />What a fuck, like honestly 6-7 years with that guy is more then enough for this girl ... why do i give people so many chances like really? and let them fucking do .... oh i'm rageing right now -- gotta little bit of rage in my right this second.<br /><br />Fuck. Annnnnnnnnd Breath Tori .....<br /><br />So i was really immature, just saying. i know this already no need to point this out to me I KNOW --&nbsp; BUT after 27(!!) phone calls ... 3 voice mails .... 7 texts and the whole conversation on msn i was <strong>PISSED</strong>. <br /><br />Like fuck you. Fuck you.Fuck you. Fuck you.<br /><br />He told me to go and find some alcoholic who wouldnt love me or them self enough but would go and crash there car in to a poll -- if i had a ""shocked face"" i wold put it <strong>RIGHT HERE</strong>!!<br /><br /><strong>LIKE FUUUUUUUUUCK YOU!</strong><br /><br />Breathing again  <br /><br />So i stooped to his level but honeslty -- and i dont know if this makes me a bad person or not, but i dont feel bad at all <strong>AND </strong>i dont care (**<strong>NOTE</strong>** Read above; <strong>FUUUUUUUUUCK YOU DEREK</strong>) <br />I took that conversation, and i took the other conversation about him taking <strong>STERIODS </strong>since he was 17 and how now because of it he needs to use <strong>VIAGRA </strong>every once in a while heh heh heh heh and being that hes such a fucking Nexopia whore (<em>Derek083</em> on it) i copied and pasted to every single girl on his ""Friends"" list&nbsp; With a warning that thats how he treats people that he has know for 7 years and went out with for a year and a half.<br /><br />NOW -- he has a <strong>REAL </strong>reason to hate me ... idiot.<br /><br />I'm kinda funny -- i'd hate me if i didnt just <strong>LOOOOOOOVE</strong> myself so much some times.<br /><br />Dads back, he has a wicked tan too that bugger i'm so jealous -- i need to start tanning again -- anyways he brought me back a stuffed animal and some jewlery. <strong>LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVEIT</strong>!! i think he likes having girls some times. Lol. Crappy for my bro.<br /><br />Nathan, Nathan, Nathan ... i really like this guy, BUT he scares me ... i'm putting off hanging out with him cause hes just so grrrrrrreat. <br />He really likes me, really wants some thing to happen with us, reallykinda wants to out with me, listens to details then remembers them later, <strong>READS </strong>for the fun of it!! Watches the discovery channel some time when hes bored cause he like to know about stuff, going to BCIT, is a diabetic like me!!, when i talk to him i'll think i want to say some tihng them hold off and he says it ... man ...<br />Did i mention i think he pretty good looking too&nbsp; like his nex picutre (<em>n.a.t.h.a.n </em>on Nex for Sher to look at his pic) is not a good one actually he looks really grumpy and mean in it lol but in the flesh hes pretty much amazing.<br />Annnd hes cool like really super cool, but&nbsp; he's not normal for the kinda guys i like or go out with, hes kinda punk\skater ish in the ""clean"" sexy way i dont go for that ... like ever and hes maing me want to so badly. <br />I talked to him on the phone for like 4 hours one night and never ran out of things to say and never had any silent awkward pauses ... i'm smitten for this guy.<br /><br />He lives ike two blocks from Metro ... on his own ... always makes time to talk to me on msn or text or the phone. <br /><br />I have butterflies talking about him ... this doesnt happen. I'm trying to not get my hopes up about him -- <strong>ACTUALLY </strong>-- i said this last night to him and he said ""<em>i wish you wouldnt be so pesimistic about things ...</em>"" i said ""<em>i'm worried your gonna get to know me find out all my little quirks and hate me think you wasted your time etc ...</em> ""<br />all he said was ...<br /><em>""READ what i type&nbsp; -- I LIKE U"".</em><br /><br />Awe. lol.<br /><br />Anyways i should get going before i turn in to a real girly girl here and get even more mushy."

""tori"" thought he was <strong>AT LEAST</strong> half joking ans said <em>""it was a fucking joke fuck off god""</em> and he was like <em>""well your fat ha ha wasnt that funny"" and i cried and blocked him.</em><br /><br />And then it all goes from there.<br /><br />Ok normally i would have dropped it but calling me <strong>FAT</strong> ... when you know it hurts me?! when you know how crazy i am about weight?! who does that?! Stupid exes that's who. <br /><br />So this is how we normally fight -- on msn, then i block him then he emails or some thing, texts me i text back then we call each other yell a bit then its over ... not this time though. <br /><br />I told him <em>""you know what FUCK YOU -- i cant be friends with you, and some times some people just shouldnt be friends anyways and i think we are those people""</em><br /><br />Then i got what i wanted. <br /><br />And now this morning i'm not sure if that what i really wanted or maybe i just wanted to take every thing out else that is going on out on him and then be ok with each other because thats what we do ...<br /><br />Crappy feeling, i'm getting over it though -- its been like 6 years with him comeon now.<br /><br />Made my bed i guess i might as well lay in it ... and sleep in a bit .... and make sure my pillows are in the perfect ""squish"" possition and maybe a little breakfast in bed with me anyone??<br /><br />Yea i'm an ass hole but this is what make you laugh so<br /><br />Moving on now ...<br /><br />Nex(opia) is my bitch! this site is completly an ego boost -- for real .... so many guys so many little dirty and funny things they say to you to get your attention man ...&nbsp; it TOTALLY cracks me up every single day i LOVE it. I now wake up and look forward to seeing the little things people have to say to me. <br /><br />Fuck yea Nex is my bitch!<br /><br />There are a few things coming up that are <strong>REALLY</strong> exciting for me at the moment ... <br /><br />May Long weekend -- Dave and i are going up to Kelowna and Vernon, our hotels are booked and out plans have been made ... this is gonna be once crazy weekend people, Dave and i are on our own for a few days but then HOT Dave is comeing up there to party with us ... and i cant wait. <br /><br />Funtastic!!

Yesterday ... this happened, BUT first let me say i know the ""Rules"" ... you post your life on the internet your fair game, people can ready, they can comment, post there own etc etc etc -- FAIR GAME -- i get this much.
I comment was posted ... a very good comment at that ... to the point and 150% of what i NEED to hear, it was from someone i dont know though&nbsp; ... which makes me worry that people read my LJ and think i'm a .... haha ....&nbsp; to put it blunt ""Whiney little bitch"" or some thing ... when in fact ... ok, not gonna lie ....&nbsp; about 60% of me is that but theres lots more to me (40% more!!) thats fucking awesome!! 
Anyways i went back to this persons page and there wasnt much but i read there posts and well yea i have no clue who this is ... doesnt really matter i guess ... actually not at all ...

Moving on now ....

So who names tehre kid Suri? TOM AND KATIE  OBVIOUSLY!! normally i dont care about this kinda shit but i had to laugh when i read that ...&nbsp; There much be some kinda super great meaning behind it that i dont know about lol , i'll ""Google"" this later. Ok one more question about this though .... did they not research this first do they not know that Surrey here is some kinda crappy town .... guess they dont care -- good for a laugh though.

Last night was fun picked up Mel went to The Shack watched some rippers, had some drinks, went to BP for a bite ... good times good times. Dave was a bit of a dick ... but nothing more than normal, he wants to hook up with Mel i'm sure ... DRAMA!! Lol LOVE it!! Anyways he wants me to work some thing out for him i might be able to do this depending on how ""good"" of a friend hes gonna be to me ... KIDDING--KIDDING.

The three of us are going to head down to Onyx Thursday, because Dave used to bartend there i'm thinkng it should be a good night, no line free drinks good people etc etc etc.

Four days in a row now ... lol this is gonna sound REALLY lame ... but yea four days in a row i have done a hardcore REAL work out ... no fucking around like a REAL gat your ass in gear, sweat like a boy, feel the burn work out AND i am already starting to feel better about myself. This is a good thing no? yea i think so ....

Alright well i have a HUGE day of moving my bedroom shit around ... trying to make space for my self in any possibal way i can, i'm not sure how much longer i'm gonna be able to take livingin the same room with my sister ... BETTER then with the step beast for sure but still .... SO i'm trying to make the best of this shitty situation. I taking the proverbial ""lemons"" and I have decided to throw them away and then make myself a wonderfully strong drink instead!!

I'm a pot smoker, and yes its kinda funny that theres a ""4-20"" day and all but do we REALLY need a WHOLE day for people to just sit around and get high and burn out? 

Really ...?

I'm supposed to head down town and go to Lola tonight this really cute loungy kinda place but i'm scared to drive past the Art gallery or VCC cause god knows what going on down there hahaha.

Crazy pot smokin hippies lol -- kidding.

Alright so my dad is gone ... on his mystery trip that he's taking and not letting anyone kno where hes going. Weirdo ... some where warm and in the states thats all my sister and i know. I told him to bring us back some thing super cool and sparkly!!

Derek ... was supposed to come nad hangout with me BUT i got REALLY worried that he had some kinda ""exspectaions"" of me and so i backed out. He wanted to have a sleep over ... he wanted to have one last night too ... he said he wouldnt come and hangout unless he could sleep over -- he is my ex and he is being good to me rightnow and i DO love him to death (well i&nbsp; dont know about TO death) but yea ... i'm not a hooking up and hanging out kinda girl. i dont want that ... not at all. Not with him -- not with anyone right now. 
Some one shows me a bit of intrest that would be great but about 2 years of hooking up and hanging out ... i'm done with that.

NOTE TAKEN BOYS??

Sooo there s guy ... i'm not sure what i think of him yet ... well no not true .... i think hes a good'er ... i'm just not sure where its going. As per-usual, SO,&nbsp; -- WHOA -- i just got super pesimistic and wanted to say ""Like most things will probably fall through..."" 

I dont wannt think like that. 

Moving on now...

Kyle said some thing weird to me today -- lol. He said some thing about how he thought i had plans ... i said i just got back from working out i was gonna shower -- he said something then i said ""Stop it"" and some thing about how i was gonna take a shower cause i was all sweaty and gross ... then he told me to stop saying that that i needed to learn waht to say to guys or some thing close to that ... and i'm retarded so i'm not sure if he ment the ""stop it"" or the ""sweaty and gross"" thing. I'm not smart ... so i dont know, neither of them sounds bad enough for someone to say not to say that to them anymore...

Dave and i are going to pick up Melissa tonight!! i cant wait i have only seen her once since i have been back to Van... so we're gonna get her from Ridge take her DT go and see whats happening at Lola ... i REALLY want to go to that 1,000 flavors of ice cream -- well not really 1,000 -- place ... i blame this on Bry cause he was the last one to say some thing about it. But yea i cant wait -- good times good times.

My little 16 yr old sister THINKS shes sleeping over at her bf's house tonight ... i will kick her muther fuckin ass if she does ... just saying ... this morning i found a condom -- and its NOT mine -- errrr i should say it was still in the package too ... but yea JUST ONE, not a 12 pack or wahtever they come in JUST ONE.

Ok, moving on now .... 

I'm gonna go and watch Tyra now lol maybe she has some advice for me...

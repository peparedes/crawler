"event","so about the whole french chick thing.  she wasnt there.  i kinda figured, but oh well, it is a new day and its freezing outside.  alas the semester is comeing to a close and the words that come to mind and bring such excitement, such joy, such enthusiasm; ""hell yes!!!""  its time once again for everybody to come aboard the winter break train!!  
      is it good to get involved with people you work with?  how about if they already have boyfriends.  ok it's story time kids.  there's this girl at red lobster and her name is .... just in case you want to know ask me later.  but anyway i'm really attracted to her.  really nice, funny, about 5'6"", amazing smile...  i've been trying to talk to her more.  you know this and that, small talk so far.  but she only mentions that she has a botfriend when i'm around her but she's not talking to me.  Question 1: is that a hint to try harder, or stop trying completly?  Question 2: if i do try, is it a good idea to persue?  ah the many questions for complicated women.  that might be a good movie title.  well if someone takes it, you no who's idea it was.  
      With a little peace
      And some harmony
      We'll take the world together
      We'll take'um by the hand

"event","drawing went really good on monday.  lately i've been working on a one point perspective drawing.  the theme is a serealistic view of the rock and roll hall of fame.  its pretty decent i guess.  my drawing teacher has been giving me props on the work in progress stuff.  and that day in class, there was the french chick, looking as beautiful as ever.  she brought in a cake because it was her mom's birthday and we all had some.  twords the end of the day, i was watching her draw and i remembered that she wanted all of the cake gone.  so i told her ""well...i have three other roommates at home and i'm more than sure that cake will not go to waste.  and in her most beautiful accent she said ""oh please, please take it with you.  just be careful that you dont spill it.  when i was carying it in i got frosting all over me and i was wondering where you were so you could lick it off.....""   OK so i made that last part up, but i did end up taking the cake home and i did almost drop it.  so today i have a plan.  i no its been a while, and i no she has this other guy talking to her now,(timeing was never my thing anyway) i plan on telling her that the guys at the apartment want to meet her and thank her personaly as an excuse for taking her on a date anyway.  of course if she says yes, i'll take her to a movie or something after or before that.  its a long shot, but lately i've been lacking the ""i just dont give a crap"" attitude that i need.  and just so you guys are geared 4 the dissapointment in the next enteree if there is any, i saw her earlier today, and she told me se wasnt feeling so good and she might not stay for class.  i recovered a little and said i hope to see you there anyway.  
         man it's almost the end of the semester.  time goes by really fast.  but hey, at least i can look forword to long nights going till 4 in the morning playing videogames with andrew and glen.  aahhh good times.  well peace out kids.  have a safe trip home.

"event","its really not a manic monday at all, i just thought it was a clever title.  i'm updating now because i have a lot of math to do in between math and drawing.  its been a pretty good weekend.  me and my bro went to yanish tree farm and picked up a gynormus tree.  (spelled with a y)  and work was pretty fun too.  ah yes red lobster...its really fun when its busy, but people that go there are ass holes and dont tip for shit.  4 people sat at the bar that were together and totaled over $75 worth of food.  i got a $2 fucking tip.  and i only got $1 cuz i had to split it with josh.  then greg, nick and geoffery, came over and stayed the night, because greg locked himself out of his apartment.  it was relativly fun except he broke my guitar cord and my amp.  ass hole....that is all i have to say about that.  its ok though dont think that i'm writing this out of anger i'm over it now.  well i guess its off to math class now.

"event","ok kids i'm back again at what is to be my second atempt to write this enteree.  believe it or not we actually had a fire drill at delta college today.  and since in the 1 1/2 years that i have been here there hasn't been a practice one so i'm guessing something happened.  no one was hurt though.  anyway i'm back from thanksgiving break it was a pretty typical thanksgiving day, in fact it was a little more boring perhapps.  my very drunk, but extreamly entertaining uncle wasn't there to make everyone laugh.  also i didnt get to see vanessa as much as i got to see her last year.  saddening...  i suppose the coolest thing was that i got to have a beer with my family for the first time and they all practically encouraged it.  yeah everyone else could probably do that already, but it was a special moment for me so dont ruin it by telling me that please.  and so i come to a close.  i hope you all had a very happy thanksgiving

      why the hell doesn't anyone that i no write on live journal anymore.  (sigh)  if you guys wanna no whats up with me, then you gotta tell me whats up with you....basterds...
      i got another car now and it is f'ing ssssswwweeeeeeeeeeettttt!  a white pontiac Grand AM.  not only does it run smooth, but it came with 2 12"" speakers in the trunk.  i love it when good things happen to good people.  now if i could only get my ticket paid off.  well bye kids.  have fun."

but hey what can you do.  a life at bay video isnt exactly a job in the real world anyway.  its all good though.  i'm not complaining or anything bartending is actually really fun.  of course it will be even more fun when i get use to it and dont have to think as hard like everybody else there.  seriously, i found out that everybody that works there has been there at least 2 years.  minus one of the hostesses.  the most so far is 27 years!  can you believe that crap! 27 years is nearly more than 1/4 of your life.  whatever works i guess.  red lobster is a crazy joint in the alley (where all the cooks are)  it always makes me want to see that movie ""waiting"" because all the cooks we got are absolutly hillarious.  they dont hold back either.  honestly, everything that they tell us not to do, such as sladerous jokes (not to mention ""your momma"" jokes)  are all said and done in the alley.  the smile has only left my face once or twice and that's only because i was too busy thinking about being a bartender. (sigh)  bottom line...give bartending a try.  it is an amazing experiance.

oh yeah...i got in a car accedent a couple of days ago.  nobody worry though, i'm perfectly fine and so was the other person.  all the other person had was a little sorness in her hand.  i will admit responsibilty for it as well.  i was in a hurry.  i just thank god that we are both all right.  well piece out kids until i find a new car to drive."

"event","hideyhoo kids.  im back from WV and i had an absolute blast.  ness and i went to the most kick ass haunted house of all time.  there was a really awsome fat guy that was tying off his arm and eating it or something...you really had to be there.  the next day i went to a gay bar.  oh yes thats right kids, a gay bar.  that was an experiance.  if you ever question your sexuality, go to a gay bar with vanessa.  everyone knew i was straight, but that didnt staop the crazy drag queens.  i got my ass grabbed, spanked, someone rubbed against my balls and i got humped.  and that my friends is an understatment of the century.  i was quite sure that i was straight going into this place, but now there is no question in my mind that i love only women.  however i am a lot more comfortable with my sexuality.  the next day was a pretty good adventurus day.  ness took me to see her house that was 40 min away.  rainy but still a nice drive.  we were there for a while just messing around and shootin the shit...good times. after that we went with mandy, who is the cutest college girl i have ever met, to 1 2 3 pleseant street.  we saw to bands that were pretty decent but the last one can only be described as ""BLAH BLAH BLAH"" (say it like screaming and whining at the same time and pretend your a girl to capture my impression)  i was really sad when i had to go...miss you ness...hope i can come back soon.

      as you can tell by my musical sound effects to that alieah song, i am EXTREAMLY EXCITED!!!!!!!  tomarrow i am goin to ness's and holly crap it's going to be fun.  i have missed that girl like crazy.  i'm going to a gay bar.  it's alright though i'm not worried.  i love gay people.  i think we all should.  damn i'm hungry.  i hate being a poor college kid.  right now tyler proudfoot is sitting accross from me, but i havent said anything yet.  you know that akward feeling when you kind of know someone and you want to say hi, but you dont because usually thats as far as it goes?  thats what i'm feeling right now.  HOLLY CRAP!  there is a really huge guy a couple seats down with a really freaky hair cut and he is listening to stained on his head phones.  its pretty loud.  he has a nose ring.  i would be slightly scared if i didnt just see him laughing just now.  i have a drawing critique today.  i'm a little nervouse to see what other eople have to say about my drawings.  i think i' going to try and break the iceby just saying ""dont worry guys, if you think it sucks just rip me a new ass hole.  i need the criticism.""  hopefully the reverse psycology will make them say nice things anyway.  well, i got a while before my drawing class so i think i'm just going to play games till then so see ya

         so today i was extreamly tired but on  the day of all days i just want to skip bio and sleep in, the lawnmoers are all going at it at the same time.  have you ever seen 2 lawn mowers go at it?  its a lot more interesting in person than it is on the dicovery channel.  today i had an interview at family video.  the lady seemed to like me, but she told me that if i dont get a call by monday to go talk to angie or brian.  wish me luck kids.

"event","hey kids its me again.  had a pretty wierd night last night, it felt like a waste at first, but i wouldn't have enjoyed the ride home as much if it never happened.  so i got out of work and i was suppose to get a call from kim so i could finally meet chantelle.  (another girl i could possibly fall in love with if she didn't have a boyfriend)  anyway that never happened...meeting her anyway.  we did end up doing something though.  me nd greg watched a hillarious episode of family guy and all i have to say about that is ""that's not funny Will Farelle"" and ""Wake me up before you go go...""  i am so incredably sorry for the way your life must suck extreamly bad for not seeing that episode.  after that we went over to Lean's house (another one of kims friends)  extream drama happened as kim and her ex-boyfriend jo were screaming at eachother on the phone.  long story...rather not get into it.  the ride home was absolutely one of the best times i had with greg and all it consisted of was talking about him and kim, blaring loud music, screaming out our own lyrics, and then talking about school....and eating tortilla chips.  
       today i drove to school and ended up parking write next to the french chick in my drawing class.  her name is caroline by the way.  i walked with her all the way up to the school and talked with her.  greg told me that when if i'm going to get this girl, i have to act like i doesn't matter if we hook up or not.  (which it really doesn't)  i'm pretty sure i nailed it because she left smiling, and i'm still wearing a huge one on my face 4 hours later.  pluse i just found out i got a 94 on my bio test and a 92 on my pre calc test.  fuckin A man!  so far so good.  now i just have to write a paper in about 2 hours and i'm set.

     i am now a sophmore in college, and i am single.  i'm having a relly good time so far.  it is a lot funner (more fun) than last year.  living with my brother, jason and matt wright as a freakin blast.  me and matt play video games whenever the fuck we want, and we do homework a lot together as well because it's usually just him and me.  a night when everybody's home we have cute little spontanious talks in the kitchen about whatever.  (its really roomy and carpeted so that makes it possible)  after everyones got there work done we play night tennis at the library.  ness if you thought you liked tennis in the day, you have to try it at night under the lights.  
     greg's apartment is only 2 buildings down from my apartment which is pretty awsome so i just use my skateboard to get there.  i dont relly like his apartment that much.  its always dirty and dark.  and oh god the smell.  i guess there is another upside to living with andy.  he's a cleaning nazi.  so you can imagine how hard he gets on me for the littlest thing.  

     so yeah, things are going really well.  i just saw a nun dressed in blue walk by.  the crazy thing is i also see her in the science wing.  i wonder if she teaches biology.  that would be ironic.  i also ran into justina the other day.  talk about an awkward moment.  i think i said like 5 words of mumbling jibberish to her and said ""i'm tired i got to go to class.  Maybe i'll see ya around.""  someone smack me please.  

i guess thats about it

       to put it all in a nut shell, i work, i've taken a summer class at delta which i dont think i did so hot in, and i have a girlfriend and her name is sara.  from see that last sentence and if you've read my pissed off enteries your probably thinking to yourself...""what the frickin hell!?!?""  
       yeah a lot has happened since i last wrote stuff.  my friends are doin good.  me and ness talk a lot (she is so darn cute sometimes), jessie's awsome, she has fun stories of throwing up on fair rides, eating large chillie dogs.......and throwing up again.  and as for greg...well...not so sure about him.  he has a new girlfriend and her name is kim.  she's cool i guess.  i take back what i said about her reminding me of justina.  she is way less psycho than her.  actually she's quite nice.  breg is a completely different person now.  he gets drunk now...not just drunk...piss faced doing the helicopter with your penis drunk.  (bad visual, i know)  i do not like it one bit.  everyone that knows greg farver, knows that greg runs on greg farver energy.  its so great they should bottle it up and send it to people all over the world.  but now, he's running on alcohol.  i didnt have much fun at the party untill i got a few in me myself, and its pretty said when you have to do that to be able to stand him.  anyway greg if you ever read this, go back to being my hero again when me and you were the only ones that felt we were above having to drink to have a good time.  i think everyone else would agree that we like you better the way you were before.  
        well, i'm pretty tired so i guess i'll hit the hay cause i'm still a little hung over from the other night.  (not cool when you have to work all day the next day.  i wouldn't recomend it)

"event","i dont wright in this journal very often.  i guess i only really use it to bent when i'm angry.  today was a good day though.  i played 9 holes of golf with glen today.   i play golf now by the way.  pretty wierd for a guy like me to play golf.  then i talked to ness for a little bit, then i had to go to work.  i really really miss that girl.  but she wont know that untill she reads this when she gets back to WV.  that will be a sad day as well.  then i went to work and after that i watched wrestling and the home run derby with greg.  
        totaly fucking cool.  mat hardy is back baby....wow nobody else knows or cares about it besides me and greg.  thats ok though, we share something special, in a non homosexual way.  (of course)  we had a good talk today about girls and stuff.  greg is doing better day by day.  he has vowed not to drink pop anymore and he is re-inventing himself.  i think that will be fun.  i want to help him a lot.  
        he told me that i could get any girl that i wanted.  but i think thats only because i told him that he could get any girl that he wanted.  which is true.  he has the charm and the charisma af 500 men.  he sez that it gets tirering starting from scratch everytime.  ""Deege because of the way that i look girls only go out (on dates) with me just as a friend and they make sure to specify that.  so i start out at 0%.  its only after the date gets started that i make a little head way.  because of the way you are (DJ) you are already 15% of the way there.  you are the nicest guy i will ever no, and for that i will never stop being your friend.  all you have to do to get a girl is ask her out and the rest will handle itself.""  
         i love my buddy.  he also said ""Deege, you could even get the 16 year olds that are still in augres if you wanted""  naturaly i said i dont think i would try that.  ""see.....your the nicest guy ever!""  
         and that was pretty much my day except i talked to andrew on messinger about 5 min before i wrote this.  he is such a little vagina.  jk buddy you no i love ya."

My Stupid Mouth

my stupid mouth has got me in trouble
I said too much again
to a date over dinner yesterday
and I could see she was offended
she said ""well anyway""
just dying for a subject change

oh, another social casualty
score one more for me
how could I forget
mama said ""think before speaking""
no filter in my head
oh, what's a boy to do?
I guess he better find one soon

we bit our lips
she looked out the window
rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess 
with the salt and pepper shaker
and I could see clearly
an indelible line was drawn
between what was good, what just slipped out 
and what went wrong

oh, another social casualty
score one more for me
how could I forget
mama said ""think before speaking""
No filter in my head
oh, what's a boy to do?
I guess he better find one soon

I'm never speaking up again
it only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery than she desert me
oh, I'm never speaking up again
starting now

one more thing
why is it my fault?
so maybe I try too hard
but it's all because of this desire
I just want to be liked; I just want to be funny
look like the joke's on me
so call me Captain Backfire

oh, another social casualty
score one more for me

"event","it's been a pissy, crazy, and fun the last few days and thats why i haven't written anything in a while.  my brother's graduation was nice, but extreamly long!!  this one guy in a wheel kept babbling about absolutly nothing and this guy named mr. jennings.  it was for a stupid scholership and all he had to say was ""and the winner is....""  but nope, he was talking like we actually cared about how mr jennings helped him out in baseball.  so at graduation, i sat next to sara.  this is where i get into my pissed off part of the day.  we had a date set up for today.  i know in my last journal i said i was going to tell her off... yeah... didn't work so well.  anyway that date that was supposed to be for today was cancled because cleaning her room was going to take all day.  AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i hate her so much right now.  the love i had for her is officially drained after this 3rd strike.  (rather mot get into the 1st two strikes)  stupid and immature bitch.  thats all she is.  so yeah, wheather if it was her plan or not to piss me off... it worked and even if she doesn't no if we're done, i say we are!  

          Greg helped me get through this time.  he's the coolest basterd alive.  too take our minds off our ex's (which he is still persuing his)  we had a really fun time at hanna's grad party.  he killed me in ping pong.  but i beat him in this wierd game where 2 golf balls were attached to each end of a rope and you had to throw it on this rack with 3 horizontal bars made of PVC pipes.  it was crazy, but i won and thats all that matters.  if anyone knows the name of the game i horribly described please let me know.  i also beat greg's team in volley ball.  i was on the old foggies team because i had the most facial hair.  so i beat greg 2 out of 3 in the triathelon.  that was the fun part of my last few days.  its nice to end it on a good note.  guess i'll talk to you bitches later.



                                     LOVE

"event","hello hello everyone.  pretty good day today.  i got up to go to work today only to find out that the schedual was changed on me without anyone telling me.  so i sat on my ass and played some more video game.  today was my brother's class night for his graduation, but i didn't go.  he didn't seem to care much.  he never really does about stuff like that.  he said it wasn't that cool anyway.  so instead i saw a pretty darn good movie called Madagascare.  it was awsome.  not a very quotable movie, but it had a lot of very funny situational humor parts.  the big surprize of the day was that Andy Olsen is back in town.  he still has the same sence of humor he always had, but he's kind of turned into a litle bit of a druggie.  he kept talking about it too.  NOT COOL ANDY!!  stay off of that grass!  another little twist in the day, for me anyway, is that sara called me on my cell phone while i was in the movie theater.

          i don't think anyone is going to read this in time to give me any advice on this or anything so i think i'm going to have to go with my instincts on this one.  i think tomarrow's the day that i tell her off.  today's excuse for her not communicating with me is that she has been grounded.  at least this excuse was more realistic.  her last one was that she couldn't call me from canada because the phone companies were on strike.  SOMEONE TELL ME THAT THEY THINK THAT IS BULL SHIT TOO.  make me think im not crazy for not believing that. (sarcasm)  so tomarrow's going to be interesting and i'll let you know how that goes.  now i'm going to enjoy my deliciouse egg and cheese sandwich that i made me and watch the three musketeers.

                                        peace"

"event","this kinda sucks.  if every one of my friends isn't there phisically they're not there mentaly either.  

          Jess is gone to DC, which i'm am extreamly happy for her, i just miss her a lot.  ness is always with aaron, which is cool i guess, it just kinda sucks that it seems like he's threatened by me and doesn't really like me when i'm around her.  i think that's bull shit.  i am a good guy.  so what if we used to go out.  i was friends with her long before he even new her and he has no right to take her away from me.  gosh darn it...sorry.....i guess you can see i still have a little pent up anger about all of that.  anyway...as for greg, he's doing really bad with his girlfriend breakin up with him and all.  it's hard to know when to give advice and when to just be there to listen.  especially with him.  Stievie's changing really bad it seems like.  i totally no what thats like to have someone do that to you.  i no what its like because i've done it to someone else too.  i guess what i'm trying to say is that he's the one that's not mentally there.  oh boy...what am i going to do.  i love all of you guys so terribly much an i hope you all come back one way or another.  

                                            Peace"

"event","i feel a lot better today.  sorry about that last entery.  i get a little emotional sometimes.  today was good though.

          i only worked for 4 hours today then i went over to greg's house to watch wrestling.  it hasn't been a very good few days for him.  he just got dumped by his girlfriend stevie.  for any body that knows how these two were when they were together, you next to words were probably ""holy shit!""  i feel for that guy so much.  greg and i have benn through everything together, thick and thin.  he's kind of clinicaly depresed and he also has ADD.  so that means that everytime and at any time he's haveing a feel good streak, his thoughts race and he remembers that he just got dumped.  i think he's gping to be all right though.  she called him today and she said she missed greg.  so i guess thats a good sign.  i hope.  i don't really know what to think unless i can talk to stevie myself.  other than that, it was a good day for me.

           today on wrestling, shelton won in a triple threat match against rob conway and silvan granier if anyone cares.  shelton benjamin is going to be the next wrestler of the century.  also if you ever have time, WATCH THE LANCE KRALL SHOW!! it is funnier than shit!  

                               i guess thats all,
                                     Peace"

"event","it figures... 20 min later after my first journal and i get like this.  i hate when i get like this at night.  i know i'll be fine in the morning so why am i like this right now.  girls suck!!!!!!!  sorry, i meant girls suck sometimes.  

         ok heres my goddamn situation.  she's been out of my life for practically two weeks now and im fine.  thanks to vanessa (god bless that woman!)  then i stupidly go to get ice cream forgetting that she still works at the ice cream shop.  then oh yeah you guessed it, after what seemed like an eternity of her ignoring me, we end up talking for about an hour.  she's sssssssooooo sorry for making me feel bad in any way possible, because she knows that i dont deserved to be treated like that.  (whatever)  so we're talking, and the subject of ""where do we stand"" comes into play.  as if it could be decided right away she asked me ""what do you want us to be?""  well i did know before i told you i loved you and then you just walked away! BBBBBBBBBBIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!  so she apologizes and apologizes and she seems sincere.  i just want to know the truth.  i want to be able to trust her.  why the hell is she so hard to get out of my head.  I JUST WANT TO FUCKIN SCREAM!!!!!!!!  

         i need someone to love.  i need someone to just be there.  

         she tells me that she really wants to hang out with me.  i said yes.  i think i said yes partly because i'm weak and partly because i still think she could still be the one for me.  oh yeah, and to top it all off, that day that we talked, she said that she really wanted to call me the next day.  i wont lie, i was more excited then a pig in shit.  but a pig rolling in shit doesn't know any better.  and sure enough not one fuckin call.  its been a few days after that we talked and still not one fuckin call.  i'm sick of this bull shit.  the next time that we talk, if we talk at all, i can tell you its not going to be a good one.  well...i dont know that for sure.  i might end up being weak again.  but if anyone's going to end it, its gotta be me.  i'm the only one putting myself through this torture.  

                                  i'm done now.  wish me luck.

"event","wow i guess this is pretty cool.  my first entery.  i wonder what people are going to think when they read my crap.  don't judge too harshly if you dont like what i say, i always mean well....most of the time.  and if you still judge, i probably won't care.  that isn't meant to be rude, i just dont let things like that get to me. anyway....

      i had a pretty normal day today.  mostly work.  i work at a video store. its pretty awsome sometimes when i can get away with just watching movies all day.  ""assult on precint 13"" was pretty bad ass.  i recomend it for any action and or ethan halk lovers.  he's pretty hot i guess.  oh yeah by the way, if you don't know me, you might find that sometimes i think its funny to make homosexual comments.  that's just me being comfortable with being myself.  i'm completly straight just to set the record straight.  but yeah...pretty boring day at work.  then i came home and watched the pistons suck today (big fan) and played video games with andrew and glen.  

      have you ever wondered why there are so many ways to kill a person and only one or two ways to kill a bug?  quite profound for hering it on king of the hill the other day.  

       well i hope this is good enough for my first journal entery.  there will be many more to come."

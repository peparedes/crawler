"event","Well...I have not written in my LJ since forever ago! I don't even really enjoy writing in it but tonite I am bored and Keith is the only person online so I decided to write in the ole LJ. 
My summer has been packed with tons of exciting and not so exciting things....I went to Disney World and best three of the best people in the world and then as soon as I returned home I left to go to dance camp in LA. We got a bid to Nationals and that means that we are able to go to Orlando and compete in Feburary.YEAH!!!!
Anyway....school is starting in like four days which I am very excited about! Next weekend my friend, with whom I am a bitch around but on my own I am nice....yeah You know who I am talking about, we are going on a semi-road trip to LSU, baby!! I am so excited about it! And then on September  1st, we are going to go to the Train concert and oh yeah.....matchbox 20 will be there along with seven Mary three(if that is how you spell it) So I am pumped up and excited and actually quite tired right now so I am going to go watch a movie and maybe fall asleep. I will maybe write again in about tree weeks and cath up on school and crap! talk later!!!

"event","Only two words can describe today.......CRAY ZEE! First, I spent the night with Nicole and we watched the best movie, Almost Famous!! It was so cute....anyway, we got up this morning at 7:00 and at 8:28 drove to Pass for our job thing or whatever. Once we arrived, we found out that it was cancelled until Friday, so Cole and I went and ate at McDonald's. Then I came home and relized that I did't have a car so Nicole took me to our little dance workout. After I got home I played monopoly with my brother. After we went to the ""mart"" and did't get me anything, I was a litle mad so I logged on to the computer and guess who was on..PATRICE. She wanted to know if I would like to go see Jamie and Anita at work (65 Flavors, snowball stand). We took a litle adventure down there and of course got a snowball. That is how it has been so far today but it is not over yet....."

"event","Today has been no fun at all. I got up real early by accident and since 9:00 this morning, I have watched Beverly Hills, 90210!!  I mean I like the show and all but still, I can't handle four hours of it!!  I am excited though. Tonite we have church and then on Tuesday I have to go for a job thing, not exactly an interview but confertation type thing. I am excited about that and that in a month I have camp!!! Anyway, I guess my day can only get better, right?? I sure hope so!
OH MY GOSH... I had the most awful dream last nite. It was like this camp thing for people under the age of 20 that the state or country or something made everyone go to and so I went and it started out fun but then it turned in to a Holocast thing and it was horrible. Like people started to starve and nobody would do anythnig about it. It was kinda upsetting and then I realized it was a dream and woke up. Of course I didn't want to fall asleep again but I guess I did because I woke up again around 7:30. Well I guess that is all for right now!!"

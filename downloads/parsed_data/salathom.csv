"event","Hi to all who will read, I have been a bad ljer! practically non existant!

Just for a whirlwind update...

this yr has been blessed thus far for me.

I have started to appreciate every year as I get older and I pledge, with God's help and if he allows, to do something special for my birthday every year.
This year I went to Tobago with 5 friends and stayed in a ""hotel"" far into the forest! they were very annoyed with me cause we were so close to nature that we did not have cell phone reception...I got recommended to that place by another friend and i saw the website which clearly fooled me into believeing it ws top of the line... but as I tell them, there is a first and last time for everything. The trip was great nonethless(my bday was sept 14th)

The hightlights  so far this yr for me was the oppurtunity I had to go to two conventions abroad and experience the magnitude of God's presence together with people of the same faith. Lesquin, France was  a dream come true, as I longed since the day I fell in love with French to visit France. It was a week worth every penny i put out. To make lifelong friends and most importantly to experience and participate in worship all around you in different languages was a breathtaking event that unfolded before my eyes. For the first time in my life, i was in a room where english speakers were the minority. there were representatives from spain, poland, germany to name a few.... I was in heavenly places just to be a witness...
I went to FRance by way of London, andreturned there before my trip back home, thanks to the gracious hospitality of two friends of mine who live there.all this happened 31July to 111th August, 2008. too short

I had to hustle back to trinidad to catch a flight to Canada, just a day and a half later with my family. This was previously arranged becasue it was an occasion to surprise my aunt for her 60th Birthday.In my next post i'll write about the Canada trip!

thats all for now

"event","Mummy and Daddy went on a dream trip to the ""MOTHERLAND"" Africa, Tanzania to be precise. They are there now and they are 7 hours ahead of our local time. I spoke to them and they are having a great time.In a couple days, they will be headed on a three day safari. Yay for them!With them are 12 other people( family and friends) one of whom is my 24 yr old cousin Krista. She was the only""young cousin"" going. I told her to represent for us!

It is only now i realise how hard my parents work. They run a thriving Catering business that is pretty much run by them alone. They have cooks and they outsource wait staff but a lot of the administrative, purchasing and delivery is all on them. So you can imagine now the void that they have left! Thank God for my dearest Auntie Shirley who came all the way from Florida to help us out. You would think that a 24 yr old like me with her 20 yr old brother can handle things. Not really. It is more than i even imagined. We also have our ""day jobs"" that at the moment rob us of giving our full attention to the business like my parents devote to it.
Tonight, invoices to do and maybe even a menu to plan....tomorrow i have an early morning wholesale market run (that my father does at least twice weekly)(5 am!!) with one of the main cooks, drop offs and grocery shopping! My day will be packed so i cant even pencil in a lime till i know how the timing goes.
I love and appreciate my parents even more now. Hurry home!"

"event","It does not happen often,... only when i do not feel in control when i know it is my rightful place to be. It comes on in the place of speaking out for my rights. It comes out in the form of silent screams and kicks on my bed. The last time it happened that i can recall was in the yr 2000 when i was in Harrisburg Hilton and we received a noise complaint after which other people in the room continued to shout to the top of their lungs... but this time is different..

We have renovated our house, and have a total floor, complete with bathroom and bedroom to facilitate guests. We are hosting a family at present, from another Caribbean island. Husband, wife and two boys. It was my idea to let them come and stay. After all, we have the room. I was even upset that my aunt did not want them to come, seeing that my parents would not be there for their entire stay. They are staying for two weeks. They leave on Monday 27th August. Lord shorten the days, lest no flesh be saved!

This morning, as i finished showering, coming out the bathroom in my towel, the husband is waiting to enter the bathroom...why?? i ask myself, there is a bathroom upstairs for him to use! I walk to my room, covering myself properly with a puzzled look on my face. I am in my room changing and I am hearing my bathroom door ( the bathroom me and my brother share.. supposedly..)opening and closing. I walk in the hall, and i hear him SHAVING in MY Bathroom.eeeeeeeeek. I am no Monk, but geez, that is just nasty, as after he is finished i see remnants of moustache on my glass ledge close to the mirror. I grimace, as yesterday, i cleaned some of ""it"" i thought was from my brother! I have a sick feeling in my stomach and it is preventing me from saying anything! Also too, when i was dressed for work, looking in the bathroom mirror, the son comes in. I ask him"" whey dont you brush your teeth upstairs?"" he says"" there is no more toothpaste upstairs"".These people have been shopping in town everyday for more than a week and they could not buy toothpaste? Using mine that i bought and budgeted for? Am i being stingy? 

They enter my brothers room and use his laptop when he is not home, and the elder of the 2 boys jumps on my brothers bed! It is just getting too out of hand and i do not know how to stop them!!

Help!"

"event","I had a fun filled- ultra packed weekend! It was dedicated to family and bonding... and shopping of course.

Surprise surprise, my entire family ( immediate)flew out to Miami for a weekend to be with other relatives to celebrate my aunt's 60th birthday. And boy was she surprised! 

We all stayed in a 5 bedroom beach house in Golden beach miami,florida, complete with swimming pool (that i did not enter.. too much shopping time wasting lol)

My aunty Patsy who is retired and now residing in Florida turned 60 recently and her two daughters orchestrated a surprise party that will reduce anyone to tears.Her relatives from Canada,both Toronto and Winnipeg, NY, Indiana, Trinidad and even her sister who works and lives in Tanzania,Africa came for this special occasion. 

At 5  30 pm last saturday, we assembled to one side of the house while she was escorted in by her daughters who told her it was a set for a production. As she was seated and served a glass of champayne, everyone rushed forward and shouted ""SURPRISE!!"" She was beside herslf with shock! she hugged her daughter sand cried. She walked around the room with her mouth open and as she recognised the different ones she saw, she screamed and hugged them!

My uncle eldon, professional caterer did the dinner for the party. The menu was absolutely out of this world.lamb, salmon, thai chicken just to mention briefly the delights.

This entire weekend made me realise that our family is closer than i thought. Christmas time we ALWAYS get together. Birthdays, we try to do it as well.
There is strength in unity!"

"event","what would you do if all of a sudden you are out in a position that pays more than your supervisor, and the person who is senior to you in service was by passed for you to get a promotion? well right about now, i feel bummy. It does not feel great. I feel a little like the girl on ""The Devil wears Prada"" who was forced to take a position to the detriment of her colleague. I feel  a lot like that girl.

Remember the job that i was lamenting over? well after a 6 month wait, it lays before me on a platter and i am hesitating... not that i dont want it, but i feel like i cheated someone who was supposed to get it... yet i did not make the decision.. it was forced on me!
But, i deserve it! I am well qualified and my manager has given raving reviews about me in my former position, that i carried out with professionalism and precision. It is all about CARING TOO MUCH about what other people think. God has made a way fpr me to be promoted, so why am i not jumping to claim the blessing??
In the government service, people always complain about being victimised and overlooked. I am happy but i just do not like my name to be tarnished in anyway. Th Trini tongue that has no work to do can be quiet scathing! they are not easy. 
I feel the tension... the girl who was in line to get the job i was given, she wont look me in the eye...Oh well, there is nothing i can do to make her feel better.
God knows best and I appreciate all the blessings he has sent my way.
Pray that i can make it through the coming months with my sanity!"

"event","Hey i am back home from Grenada and the trip was very refreshing. I just needed a little time away from it all. 
Getting there was a task... delayed flight and a noisy cabin partner ( who prevented me from sleeping after a long day at work and coming straight to the airport!!)... the man next to me was snoring like he could not breathe... people in front and to the side of us kept turning around to se where the noise was coming from. i shifted as far as possible so people would know that i was not with him. Waiting outside the airport at half past 9 pm, i was approached by a half drunk man who asked if he could sit next to me on the bench. i said yes and turned away. he insisted we converse, asking me where i  going and all that. i had to put him in his place and eventually relocate. geez! i was never so hapy to see my cousin reach

 I was warmly entertained by my cousin Krista  who is on an internship in a top hotel in the island. Also, Bro Redhead, a pastor in the island and his family took me around. The highlights of my visit were Grande Anse Beach, ( clear blue water unlike Trinidad) Nutmeg ice cream ( the smoothest i have ever tasted) and the church service on sunday, a powerful soul searching message by Bro Redhead himself)
As usual the weekend went by too quickly and i did not want to go back....  the ticket agent said i was the last to check in at the counter.
so i am back home..
I think mid august is a trip to miami so i am looking forward to that!!"

"event","I had to stand in the bus all the way home. As a matter of fact i almost got braced at the bus door. Apparantly the bus was full but i really wanted to go with the 5pm bus. 

I reached to the terminus at 4. 50 pm after shopping in POS for some material to make suits for work. The line had snaked so far that i could not even see when the bus arrived. I knew it was there when the line began to move. So third -to -last in line I was and as the bus began to fill it seemed like i would not be able to make it in. Fortunaltely for me, when all the seats were taken, persons at the front of the line opted to wait for the 6pm bus to get seats. There was a call for anyone who wanted to be a standing passenger. i immediately rushed forward. As i put my foot in the driver shouted. ""D bus full!!"" With a look of panic and pleading on my face i said "" i can fit"". Me, along with a granny (who got in cause her niece begged the driver)and a younger guy managed to ""small up"" and be out of the driver's way. An old fresh gentleman offered me his lap to sit on. I politely said no thanks. The nerve of him! I now know why they set limits to the number of standing passengers. With ever lurch and jerk the bus made, i felt i was falling over. I tried to place my feet at a stance where i could brace myself on my left foot but there was not enough room to do so.

When the bus reached a pick up point on Independence Square, it did not stop seeing that we were filled to capacity. It was a sight to see people at that stop flagging down the bus that did not loose momentum. I felt really bad for them but it would not have made sense.
By the time i reached my stop, my feet were killing me so much (heels) i had to take a short drop taxi to reach my door step. That taxi costs $5. So much for cutting transport costs. if i got a seat i would have walked home.  There is always a next time"

"event","I cant believe that my dear cousins played a prank on me... one that was potentially ""character deforming"". They said something that absolutely had NO basis but with strong convincing taken as fact. At first when i heard it i was surprised but not too alarmed... but when i heard that my aunt in Canada heard about it and was so disappointed in ME,  it was only then i realised that the joke was taken TOO  far. SIGHHHHHHHHH But that is our family way of getting a laugh.
I hope one day we realise that our jokes are a little too over the edge and that we must think through what we say about someone before a word is uttered. I am not mad at them cause in some strange way i know that they did not mean to hurt me.. but all the same i wish that they would have thought of me first..

"event","after a long lull in posting, i have found my creative juices again...

who would have thought that i would be taking a bus in city gate to go home? it was a mixture of curiosity, ""brokenness"" and availability that triggered me to do such a thing! the normal means of transport, the maxi taxi and regular taxis have raised their fares to $4. and $5. dollars respecively from POS to diego and i just cant take the hike in the price! i mean my salary is the same and i do quite a bit of commuting daily. ""Uncle Patrick"" as he is called sometimes, (PM of trinidad) has provided a number of  new buses and created new routes to serve the public. I mean airconditioned comfort and a $3 dollar fare is well worth it. The wait however is something that needs to be addressed. 2 buses available on  the hour is not exactly efficient. i find the experience very hilarious and entertaining.


Last week friday, after waiting patiently for my Petit Valley bus, i board, find a comfortable seat, adjust the air condition vent and lean back. we reach another stop and more passengers pack in. I not worried cause i have my seat. When we reach the corner of Edward and Treasury streets, the bus driver decides to make a detour to avoid a TSTT van that is obstructing us. he drives into Treasury street and attempts to go onto the side steet. The bus is too low so we get STUCK IN THE DRAIN! Despite all efforts from TSTT personel and heeding the advice of all the ""expert"" drivers who happen to be bus passengers, we were marooned there for at least an hour!  some ppl vowed never to take any bus that he was driving again.One lady started to sing hymns while another man cursed the poor and visibly ashamed elderly driver. i mean we were 10 minutes away from where we boarded and it took them an hour to send a replacement bus. i refused to go and take a maxi so i chose to wait.

All in all, despite that bad experience on my second bus ride, i have not written them off. With all the teething problems, i embrace the service with open arms. I mean, i took a bus home today."

"event","As promised, the story continues after a long lull....

We were supposed to get ready for 10am on Saturday to go on a bus tour of The Capital City St Georges... we never got up in time. I mean we Hadassah and I) went to bed at 4am after talking all night! We were not too disappointed because my parents lent us the car and we went around by ourselves, carefully keeping land marks so as to not get lost.

We could not find the city! My dad told me that it was one straight road to St. Georges.. yet we missed it. Good ole trinis with no sense of direction. We ended up driving along a road that took us into a rural community. When we realised that  we were on the wrong road, we turned around and headed back where we came from. We eventually got our bearings and were able to see some sights of interest, the most important being the St. Georges University. It was very impressive as we drove up a hill, and the university lie below, well maintained and absolutely foreign looking. It is a vet school that is actually an American college just located there in Grenada.

Lunch was KFC Grenada. Not that impressive. Was not worth breaking my diet for... but the nutmeg ice cream tyhat we bought in a shopping mall however was worth savouring! not too sweet not too milky, just right.

We got back to the hotel, had some time to rest and then it was onto serious business. We got ready for church that was beginning 6.30pm and we had a last practice before we left.

The church was about 20 minutes away from the hotel and up some winding roads. The church was a small wooden structure newly renovated after the devastating hurricane Ivan that ripped through the island three years before. The pastor informed the congregation that the only thing that remained standing in the church literaly was the pulpit.. which was so heart warming to hear.

The service was phenomenal to say the least. Our song came out pretty well. There was a testimony form Bro. Amos that was absolutely soul stirring and powerful. God's ability to deliver should never be questioned or his ability to transform. We do not deserve it.. it is unmeritted Grace that he gives to us. His Dad Bro. Nanton, came into the pulpit and the place exploded with praise and worship. As the word went forth in simplicity, shackles began to fall. The revelation of the true word always brings the same result and no one can question its authenticity.The host pastor Bro Redhead was in seventh heaven and did not want the service to end... but there was another day coming and we had to prepare for it.

On the way home, we stopped off in an open parking lot where there were many bar b que pits going. They had chicken pork and garlic bread and fries on sale. People were standing on the road side eating pork out of foil paper! it reminded me a little of Home, where trinis eat doubles ( an indian delicacy made of flour and flavoured spicy channa) on the road. Tasted the pork when we got back to the hotel when it was cool.. it wasnt that tasty..maybe it was meant to be eaten hot on the side of the road..lol"

Friday Night! Arrival day

Apart from our 8.20pm flight on friday night with Caribbean Star airlines turning into a 9.10pm one, the journey to Grenada was uneventful. (I really wished they would have fed us in compensation for the long wait but all we got was a small 250ml juice.) We arrived close to 10pm and the airport was nearly deserted and outside very windy and rainy. The wind was blowing pretty hard, but i imagine not nearly as hard as it did some 4 yrs ago when  Hurricane Ivan rocked the  island and devastated it. But Grenada has bounced back pretty well! Even through the darkness and the rain, i could see roofs in place and vegetation intact. 

My Uncle's friend Chester met us at the airport and lent us a car. He drove us back to his house where he dropped himself off and a taxi led us to our hotel, Gran View Hotel.
On our arrival slips we put that we were staying at the GREEN view Hotel and the customs officer looked totally puzzled and asked us ""where is that?"" I guess in the Grenadian accent we heard 'green' instead of 'gran' and took down the wrong name!

We were the last group of our contingent to arrive at the hotel. 10.40pm. The check in clerk after gving us our keys turns off her computer and switches off the lights. We kept her waiting pretty long... but it wasnt our fault...but i stilll felt a little bad. She led us to our rooms then went home.
My parents room was far away on the other side of the compound.Room 36. Mine was room 6. My roomate and friend Hadassah has arrived in Grenada since 4pm. She and the rest of the group were at the host pastor's house, Bro. Redhead when we came in. I think i failed to mention that i went to Grenada for a sister church's rededication service. The hotel at that time was very deserted and the rain was drizzling... so being the BRAVE person that I am, i opted to stay in their (parents) room till Hadassah and the others came back.

And when they did I was so happy.Found the courage to go back to MY own room.
I surveyed the room and it was very decent! No 5 star but quite comfy. Air conditioning, cable tv, kitchenette, hot and cold water,balcoy and a spectacular view! There was also a pool on the compound that I did not get time to use! I did not even go to the beach! The time was just too short.

From Trinidad there were believers from both the Curepe and Sangre Grande churches-
Bro and Sis Nanton,Bro Leon Charles, Bro and Sis Kangalee, Bro and Sis Terry Ovid, Bro Ovid, Gideon, Bro Amos, Sis Rosemary J, Sis Cynthia, Hadassah, Keren, Esther and Stephanie Knights, Micheal and Salome Thompson, Leslie, Shane and baby Anna Williams, Bro Mac Mayo from NY, Bro Ecliff, and me.

The group of young people practiced a song to be done the following afternoon in the ""band room"" (Misala and Hadassah's room) using a battery powered keyboard.The practice was quite good consdering the time frame. After practice, we stayed and talked a little and retired around 1am. ie, everyone went to their room. Hadassah and I opted to stay up and talk till 3 which was why we could not make the 10am tour the following day!

I think i will pause there and continue a little later. to be continued... up next is Grenada day 2!"

 With no interuptions, i would surely make it to work at 8am promptly. They always say you must make room for unexpected incidents. True to form, there was an accident on the bus route! This caused a traffic pile up that lasted about 15 minutes, the 15 minutes i needed to be on time. 

It seemed that a person attempting to cross the road in the vicinity of British American Insurance Company in Bartaria, ON THE CROSS WALK , was struck down. The maxi driver stood there looking totally perplexed and stressed out. Shirt out of pants, wiping his brow, in short, he was in a mess... probably seeing the impending charges that would be laid on him for reckless driving. His windscreen was broken, not completely shattered but the front of his vehicle was dented pretty bad.  At this point i do not know if the victim survived, but maybe the/she did cause  an ambulance took them away rather than the DMO. At least i had an explaination for being late... 

After i settled into work very quickly.

While doing some basic tasks, i was given a list of names for the grad trainee programme,of persons who would be coming down from Tobago for orientation.  I am the one who makes domestic flight, hotel and chair rentals for  the room that the training will be in and i am the one who will call the caterer for the food they will be eating and I I I Did not get called! I applied for this programme some months ago, was shortlisted, was interviewed.... i heard nothing since...

 The graduate trainee program is designed for persons with a degree in a specific field and is a two year well paying offer. 

Oh well. What is for me is for me and I will get over it. I must be thankful to God for the job that I have and stop complaining. God forgive me if I come across really selfish. It might be kinda hard to be in the same small building where they will be getting trained while i sit and WATCH! what agony!

Ok! smiles all around now. my contract ends in mid march as i am on for someone who is on maternity leave. By the Grace of God i will get to that point..
Forgive me Lord for my attitude and i bless you and thank you for what  I have. Everything i need, you have already provided.

 I'll start from today and maybe go back in time and jump around a bit.Got up at about 6.30 am and rushed to get ready. left home at about 7.17 am and tried to make it to work on time. got there like about 8.10 which was good considereing the time i left home. Ate breakfast at my desk and started work a little while after. left work at about 4.15 and took a taxi to POS. Saw a friend who lives on my street and she offered me a drop home! i saved lets see... three dollars in transport money! may come in handy tomorrow...

Background-I work at WASA (Water and Sewerage Authority) in the Training Centre. That is where all the employees get training in professional development like teamwork, safety etc.My main task is to make hotel, travel and ground transport arrangements for persons who are coming to training from our sister isle Tobago. That part i like cause it atually demands that i have something constructive to do!. In the quiet times in the office, i do filing and also payment vouchers for the support services like the lecturers who come in and the catering staff etc to get paid.Pretty boring! My office is about an hour away from my home using public transportation(i really want to get a car!)Enough about work.

-I live at home with my parents and I have one brother. (maybe all this info should go inmy profile?)Dont worry i will sooon get the hang of posting!

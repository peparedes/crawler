"event","Apon a sea of a hundred billion dreams floats a island. Perfectly mis-shapen, this island is home to no one and houses many. To the north there is a chair. Resting on this chair there is a man. He sits without moving. He sees without opening his eyes. Breaths without breath. Speaks without words or noise. He knows without any knowledge. This man is becasue he knows he is. Without contradition this man is nothing. Therefore this man is nothing and just doesn't know it. The failure of knowledge on his part spares him inexistence, for how are you to not exist if you truly believe....no, if you know you do exist. The man stands. He puts his small, black hat on his bald head and lets his long hair flow over his coat colar. His boots make no footprints at all, for you see he has no legs. Walking slowly across the beach the man pulls a cigarette from a concealed pocket in his coat. Having no fingers to grab the cigarette the man puts the small stick in his mouth and lights the tip. The smoke floats away with every inhaling breath because the man has no neck or lungs to carry it. Breathing out a thick cloud the man stares out over the horizon, gazing out of empty sockets, for the man has no eyes. Spotting a log nearby the man walks over without any legs and sits, smoking his cigarette without fingers or throat or lungs, for he has none of these things. 

This island is closer than you might think, for it does not exist.....
...but it does not know that.

"event","My eskimo/giant pencil/story thing is gonna have to be put on hold for a bit cose i need to rant and spill the last few weeks onto....a screen i guess.

so my sister got married on the 30th of december which from that created possibly the biggest week of my life, but shouldn't start here....i'll start at very least somewhere in the middle.

Erin, my sis came back from london at the beggining of december with my now brother-in-law Jamie (who i must say is awsome, one of the few humans that could gel so well into the twisted bunch of people i like to call my family.). From about the night before christmas eve till the night after new years we were drinking every night, at least until 3am, doing all sorts of other 'things' that are like alcohol but fuck u up more, if u know what i mean and doing the whole family deal every fucking day. But the big 3 days were the day before the wedding, the 29th we had a pre-wedding party with everyone we knew....then the wedding. My brother Rhys and i were bridesmaids...which was awsome, we had the coolest clothes. Then the next night was new years eve, in which we had booked a private room in the Family which blew everyone away. It was, simply put, fucking huge. anyway they went on their hunnymoon (i know i can't spell, screw u) and just came back the other day. I am writting all this now because erin and jamie have finnally left for good back to london and to be honest i'm at a loss for what to do. These two people, erin especially (on the same token jamie really has become my new brother) are not just family, they are some of my best friends and will trully miss them. Theres not really much more to say, so i'm not going to....some things are just too hard or stupid or both to type or put into words.

"event","Dun Dun DAHHHHHHHHHHHHH ""Cold Drill""

Ok, so let me set the scene from where i left off. Theres a giant, hollowed out pencil sitting in a loungeroon. This pencil is filled with melted chocolate cake, eskimo blood and the unfortunate eskimo himself with a freshly drilled hole in his left leg. I am sitting in the cupboard holding said drill.

and here we go again...

At this stage i'm feeling kinda light-headed. I mean, i just spent about 2 hours carving up a giant pencil, about half an hour filling it with chocolate cake, 5 or so hours waiting in a cupboard with only a drill to keep me company, about 10 to 15 minutes drilling a hole into my eskimo roommate and all on an empty stomach. I mean i've had nothing to eat, i didn't even sneak a bite from one of the cakes. So naturally i'm starving. After 25minutes i notice the eskimo stopped moving so i thought the coast might be clear...maybe get some of that cake finally. I walk out and instantly know theres something wrong. It's nothing i can put my finger on straight away, but something in the room was missing. then it hit me....all the cocktail weenies and cherios that were stuck to the end of the pencil were gone. Just the little toothpicks were left. Very ominous, i thought. As i walk past the pencil, like a flash of lightening out comes the eskimos hand from the cake swamp and grabs me by the ankle. I trip and fall. twist in mid air and land on my back with the drill pointing straight up. The eskimo steps out of the pencil, all chocolatey and stuff and i notice his leg is all healed. How? i thought, i drilled that barstard for 15 solid minutes? then i notice one of the cherio toothpicks extruding from Mr eskimos mouth and it all dawned on me like some voice over narrator type guy gave me the script. The eskimo had, on the brink of death accidentally swallowed one of the cocktail weenies in his little 'drilling accident' and found that the weenies had been genetically modified by the rubber in the pencil and the fact that they had been there about a year and a half. They gave him super-natural powers e.g. uncannily quick ability to heal from drill wounds, the ability to breathe in half-melted chocolate cake and the ability to speak words that i understood. Clearly a formidible foe considering the weapons i had at the time. So, the first word the eskimo says to me are 'what the fuck is with the drill man?' a bit fucking rude i thought. I mean he's finally able to comunicate to me and he chooses to swear. Typical really. Anyway i decide that instead of engaging him in an intriguing conversation i'd drill through his skull. And although i get a lot of satisfaction from this and he recives a lot of pain, due to his mutation the result is sweet fuck all. It's at this point that the eskimo grabbed the drill off me and prceded to drill right through my heart. Now i was thinking....'hmmmmm, i wonder if that chocolate cake is still good' at the time so i don't think i really reacted the way he wanted me to. Then, as luck would have it the battery on the drill finally dies......


gasp!

what? no more? hahahahaha, foolish mortal. Your mere squishy brain cannot fathom any more of this story now. Your pathetic fragile form could not take it. Why another mere punctualtion mark would crush u like a mac truck crushes a sandwich. If u have not died of some horrible disease maybe u will live to see the end of this story and see if the character 'i' survives a drill through the heart. and will little tommy ever walk again? will he discover that his mother is actually his fathers pet dog's uncle? and that he has fingers growing in his appendix? satanic fingers!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! huh? will i ever finish???????

yes

still 9.53.......


ohh wait?...nope 9.53





i wonder if u can die of boredom....ahah!! 9.54

i'm sure it's possible, but i just don't think i'm that lucky....plus a death like that would be way too interesting...spoil all the boredom.....still 9.54.........bugger


9.55, time is moving right now, sure....but it's damn damn slow. 9.55

i don't even have anything remotely interesting to say....except maybe....9.56

ok, here goes

there was this ....eskimo right, and he owned the biggest pencil in the world. Funny thing was, he couldn't read or write, didn't even know what a pencil was, just knew he had the biggest. Not that you could write much with a pencil of that size. So instead of using this giant pencil to write giant letters or even regular sized letters he used to use it as a couch. He lay it on his floor, cut a chunk out of one of the sides and filled it with pillows. Used to stick litte toothpicks with cocktail weenies or cherrios or whatever in the rubber end and just leave them there. Said they were to give the place a more 'cocktail' feeling. Never did understand what the fuck that guy was on about, and not just becasue he spoke a different language than i did, you know? It was like through his mumbling i would pick up these vibes, but i didn't even understand them. Even his vibes were a different language. I tried to ask him about this one day but he just fed me all these lines like ' goobla pook totorech', you know the same old thing. Just blocking the whole conversation, felt like he was hiding something. So came up with a plan to solve this. I got all these powertools and stuff from out the shed one day and just started carving up that giant pencil. So in comes my eskimo freind yelling the same jibberish he had for years but i just ignored him. He gave up after half an hour. So i fully hollowed out this giant pencil and then half filled it with chocolate cake. The eskimo loved the stuff, had no less than 20 of these big muddy chocolate cakes in the fidge at any one time...even had 12 'emergency' ones in the freezer. So heres this giant pencil half filled with chocolate cake, i hide in the nearby cupboard and wait....and wait for like 4 or 5 hours...just watching. In comes this eskimo fellow, takes one look at the pencil and dives, headfirst into the pool of now half-melted chocolate cake. just starts taking random bites everywhere, chocolate splashing the walls, carpet, hair...everywhere....So i jump out from the cupboard holding this electric drill i found in the shed and started to drill right into the eskimos left leg. At first i hear this blood curtling scream which, to be honest throws me into a bit of a panic. But i keep my cool and just keep drilling. After a while the screams subside and make way for this really weird gurgiling sound...but it's really slow cose it's coming through all this chocolate cake/blood mix. 10 minutes go by and my hand is getting a bit sore so i stop. I walk back to the cupborad and close the door....and wait again. I can see the eskimo through a little hole in the door...he's moving alright, but to nowhere inparticular....

ok, in reading this over i don't really know whether i should finish it. so if any of you out there who stumble upon this have any objections about me drilling into this imaginary eskimo, please...tell me, and i'll refer your complaint to the liam-doesn't-give-a-shit complaints service where one of 10 drunken hobos who i kiddnapped last week will insult you till you hang up. however if you are part of the sadistic minority just hold on and i'm sure i'll finish this story in good time...i mean, what else am i gonna do these holidays right?

"event","'sigh', Friday night, a great night to get absolutly trashed and completly forget about everything (sometimes permenantly) and i'm here typing in an online journal.   :( have i really become one of these people who sit on the computer all day and night complaining about being broke and bored off their arse and sick of all the shit day in and day out and.....well, look at me, i've said too much. 

but is it too much to ask for like 50 bucks and a crowded, smoke-filled room once or twice a week to chill in? is it so much to ask to have free alcohol served to me without having to get up? Or even the simple peasures of a monkey knife fight? has the whole world gone nuts and i'm the only one left!?!!!!!! 


the answer is ofcourse....yes. you all don't exsist, or if you do u're insane and i'm the only one left. So, naturally the purging of the human race is iminent.....no offence.

ok, that seems to be a perfectly sane and legible way to start my online entries...with any luck all those monkey knife fight-organisers are reading this and will contact me soon....i need to build my armies before the next full moon...

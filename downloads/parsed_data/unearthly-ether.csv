"event","The dire promise of an 8 hour workday (a characteristic soul-sap of modern livng to which I am as of yet unaccustomed) and the most capricious click of my pointer has brought me back to this disused, disabused, and disenchanted(?) journal. 
I read lately with greater ease, but write with more difficulty.
MEDIAPORT:
Sim City 4: repetitive yet therapeutic, nourishes the sociologist ghost. 7/10
Picross: same as above, change to mathematician ghost. 6/10
Sudoku: not as hip to do anymore since Picross' inception. 5/10
Kingdom Hearts 2: Again repetitive, however beautiful, end is in sight (6 hours minimum) 8/9
Curb Your Enthusiasm: Need season 5 back from sarcasm abroad 10/10
The Wire: Season 2 holds much promise, need watch more faster. 5/5
A Scanner Darkly: better upon review, even masterful 5/5
Taxi Driver: awesome upon finishing. 9/10
Thank you for Smoking: good at midpoint, very dry, slight dislike of its brand of humor. 4/5
Harry Potter 7: Captivating to the very end, wizarding world developed almost to the point of disbelief, rather pleasant ending all things considered. 10/10
Lucifer's Hammer: Good at midpoint, real sci-fi elements begin soon. 7/10

Traveling soon, should be invigorating. Need to unlock my bike somehow, so that I may ride the bike. 
Brief idea:
Given the idea that the grades of all standardized tests are fairly determined within a homogeneous native culture, one can clearly see in their own social circles and communities that, in many ways these grades do predict, and perhaps even affect, many individual's efforts to pursue education. I question whether it is really the duty of the education system, of society, to quantify an individual's mental potential just because they've reached an arbitrary level of education. These testing systems engage in psychological warfare on their subjects, this is not only a limited means of testing one's intelligence, but is a poor substitute for earning the right to higher education through physical efforts. If a student is so inclined, s/he should have the option of applying to any school without any of these test scores, instead offering a strong portfolio or resume for consideration. I believe if standardized tests were done away with, people would feel more free to gain education. Ultimately, everyone would end up in their right place, with out the misery of everyone knowing, in quantifiable terms, where they fall in the human hierarchy."

"event","So I think my live journal will come back, since it would seem that my human contact over the next month is destined to be most minimal. Rochester is a shocking social cold snap in the vineyards of me heart[ies]. I had an idea the other day, for yet another distopic warning novel, in which the dominant culture devotes almost all of its resources to the emulation of some innately ""superior"" foreign culture. Like if the anime craze were to last forever and on 100 times the scale. I suppose it wouldn't even matter if this ""ideal"" culture in reality even resembled the standard that the masses were emulating, or even if the country actually existed. Any of those things can be worked around in a vague enough narrative.

I need to get a haircut, and to see that I shall have summer plans. Perhaps I'll download yet another movie if I'm feeling daring.

so cold in the basement."

"event","I'm unbelieveably, and steretypically pissed off about the total lack of artistic endeavor in the latest Woody Allen vehicle. yes, VEHICLE! I done said it! No likable characters. No characters at all, only lifeless actors reading a script. 
myself: ""I think after that... everyone deserves a candy bar. However, only I shall eat one.""
Audience served as a mallady for my intense nonplussedness. 

Also some of my friends are NEVER online anymore, this is a tragedy for I am no island but I am terrible self-centered.
Come back buds."

"event","Note to self: this will be the last update before I make my LJ look snazzy with a bunch of tripped out shit. 

I will be powering up in the future. The ground will shake and tiny pebbles will float up and hover at about eye level. I'll be screaming a lot like I just don't care and everyone will hear me scream and noone will have a problem with it.
My power level will be incredible that's for sure.
The heavens will part and tiny angels will be sucked into the vortex of the vacuum created, when I power up. The angels might die, or might become something better, either way I will not care.
Almost everyone on the planet will be dead, in the future, where I will power up. So it will be kind of a cool thing when one of the last humans does power up on the desolate earth.
My foe will be important, I will have saved the glorious opportunity to a point where no one will be dissapointed in my decision to power up. My foe will also be easily vanquished, perhaps in the first attack, whatever the form, that I decide to  unleash upon his brow, which will be furrowed in worry. 
I will slump down, satisfied and pass out or die I haven't decided.
They key to this plan will be patience, and the ultimate test to see if I will be truly satisfied with my self."

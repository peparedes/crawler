"event","It rarley happens: trying hard, attempting your best, giving it your all; but these are the things that distinguish you from an average person to a hard-working person. My dad always told me that he didnt care what grades I got as long as I tried my hardest. Whenever it came time for report cards and I had a less than average grade my dad always asked the same question. ""Did you try your best?"" I always had the same answer, ""yes"" Although I always said I tried my best I never really did. I tried hard and I put effort into it but I didnt give it everything I have. I guess the point of this is that last night I feel like I tried my best. I worked as hard as I could, I knew the material the best I could and if my dad asked if I tried my best I would be able to honestly answer yes. So even though I have not recieved the grade of the test (and I might be pissed if I get a bad grade...lol) yet I have the satisfaction in knowing I tried my best. Give it a try sometime, try your hardest and see what happens."

"event","I hate it, the feeling of not knowing whether or not you made the right decision sucks. I hate all the ""what ifs."" People always say things happen for a reason, including myself. However, people really do make wrong choices and decisions every day, I hope I am not one of them. Hopefully, things will pan out sooner or later."

"event","I cant believe that I am getting ready to move out. Many people have done this by the time they are 20 but no matter how old you are, it is a bittersweet moment. I love the luxeries of living with parents yet at the same time I hate the restrictions. It's time to grow up, so thats what I am doing."

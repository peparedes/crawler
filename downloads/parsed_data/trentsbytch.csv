"event","So, we got a kitten today. It wasn't planned but as soon as I saw him, I was in love.
Was at work this morning and I could hear miaowing in our car park. we have wild cats on site so I thought maybe one was hurt but I couldn't see anything under the cars. Then I realised that it was coming from inside one of the cars.
We got the owner, popped the bonnet and a little black and white face was peering up at us from inside the engine. The only reason for it being there was it was one of the wild cars on site had found a warm cozy place for a snooze and got stuck.
We got a box from the office and managed to get him out then Zig (one of the girls I work with) and I popped down the road to the PDSA with him and they had a look at him. He wasn't hurt or anything but pretty grubby. I rang Andy and we decided to adopt him so the PDSA said they'd keep him in for an hour or so to make sure he was eating OK and we went to pick him back up at 11 this morning. We've called him Sebastian and I think he's a couple of months old. There's a pick of him on my facebook and he's a real sweety.
Tiberius has met him and got on fine at first but is trying to play a little bit too roughly with him so Sebastian has gone on the cage where Tiberius was to begin with while his pelvis healed and hopefully, once Tiberius has had his 'gentleman's operation' (tomorrow) things will be a bit easier! I hope."

"event","got a new kitty cat today :)
he'd been dumped with a fractured pelvis at the PDSA near where I work. 
thankfully, one of the girls I work with's sister works there and knew we were on the look-out for a new cat.
we've called him Tiberius after Captain Kirk :) he's a blue and white snuggle-tart! all the nurses in the PDSA were a bit sad to see him go because he's such a flirt.
he's got to have cage-rest for a couple of weeks until his pelvis is better but he's managed to clean himself fine and wiggle about in his cage.
after he's better from the pelvis problem, he's got to go back to the vet because he's still got all his gentleman pieces and I don't want him shagging up the neighbourhood (or spraying all over the house!)
if you'd like to see pics, there's a couple on the Facebook page :)"

"event","Been back to the fracture clinic today about my wrist - fell on black ice before Christmas. A&E suspected it was fractured so put me in a half cast.
Went to the frature clinic two days later and they removed the cast as they didn't think it was fractured so gave me a support that I could take on and off as I pleased.
So, back to the clinic this afternoon, had 4 X-rays taken of my wrist and they *still* can't decide if there's a crack in the bone or not. They asked if I was getting on OK with the support to which I said yes. Consultant said he was happy then to let me go and for me to contact them if it hurts or anything (which it hasn't really been doing).
I do have some lovely bruises on the under-side and right side of my wrist though :)"

I still have SERIOUS issues with Edward's idea of 'romance' (coercion and blackmail do not ride high on my list of things to look for in a partner).
The special effects were really good and the wolves looked great :)
Acting still leaves a lot to be desired, especially from Bella and Edward but I think they have improved slightly from the first two.

"event","went to a place called Renishaw Hall on saturday with mum, was really nice - had a good wander round the gardens and took loads of pics (see my facebook soon). she then took me to a Turkish restaurant and I had *such* tasty food :) Dolma to start (pine nuts and rice in aubergine) then spinach and eggs which was bubbling like lava when it came out to me!!!!!! going to have to take Andy there - reckon he'll love it too!
in other news, have mainly been re-jigging my uni report that I handed in the other day and have re-submitted it in view of Sarah (other supervisor's comments).
Fingers crossed again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","went to see latest Harry Potter yesterday. thought it was really good but really really rushed through in some places - was there a reason WHY they still bothered to call it the half blood prince when all you got was about 3 sentences about it all????
lad that plays Draco was brill I thought, Daniel whatsit annoyed me but then he usually does - will someone please show that boy how to smile and not scare people with that weird as fuck face he pulls???????
ron/hermione was sweet and the girl playing Lavender was also good :)
loved the quidditch match!! God I wish I could play :(
in other news, did lots of uni work and I'll be MIA for a few days from tomorrow as I'm off to Lancaster for a 4 day conference with all the other Gothic type peoples from here there and everywhere!!!!!!!! will be very hard not to fan-girl at some of the people who will be there! :)"

"event","1. NIN at the MEN on Tuesday night - they played for almost 2 hours and the set list included I'm Afraid of Americans, La Mer, Head Like a Hole and LOADS of other brilliant songs!!! It was just amazing seeing them again. Just wish I could go see them again now :(

2. After my crappy exam of last week, I had an 'emergency' meeting at uni today so I could discuss my next step with my supervisors. Turns out, Sue that was my examiner got told some of what she said should not have been done in public and she should have just written some of it on the form they have to fill out! HA!!!!!!
It was a really good meeting and I feel a lot happier again that I know where my thesis is going and what it's going to involve in the future :)"

"event","blimey that's lots of cake suggestions :) thanks guys!!!

now, for a meme pinched from filthgrinder:
5 words that make her think of me and explanations of what they mean to me....if you want me to do similar to you, then just leave a comment saying WORDS!!!

1. Opera
Some of my earliest memories are of going to the University Drama Studio to watch my mum as the soprano lead in Gilbert and Sullivan - we used to go on dress rehearsal night (this was when I was like 3 and 4 years old) with our Grandma in our jimjams and sit and watch. Sometimes Mum would make me a mini-version of her cosutme: when she was Yum-Yum in Mikado she made me a mini-kimono :) in my later years I have undertaken some of the smaller parts myself - Fiametta in Gondoliers par example. It's in my blood and I wouldn't have it any other way. :)

2. Porn
Ah, this takes me back to my wild old uni days where being the sexually frustrated person that I was, I'd while away the hours writing the dirtiest porn that sprang into my brain and letting my friends read it ;)

3. Cats
At the moment I just have the 1 cat (Bob) who will be 17 next week! Alas we lost Baldrick earlier this year and I still miss him *so* much it hurts. People sometimes think cats are snooty, that they don't give affection. I think this is rubbish, cats are so very affectionate in their ways, Baldrick used to come for a snuggle as often as he could and give you a good hearty wallop on the forehead while he was about it (cat kiss), Bob is more sedate so when he gives you a kiss, you know he really means it. While I don't know what I'll do when Bob goes, I know that cats are ace and fantastic!!!!

4. Trent Reznor
Pretty much the most GORGEOUS man on the planet (apart from my Andy of course!!), everything that NIN has ever been lies in his somewhat fucked-up brain :) Is there anything more fine than the Perfect Drug video when he's all about the Victoriana???? Talk about melt in the mouth.......

5. Buffy the Vampire Slayer
While I wasn't too keen on it at first, I soon grew to love the show (personally think Buffy herself is annoying but there we go). Seeing all the characters change from being the dorky school kids to kick-ass witches and builders (?!) was ace. There's always been a bit of jealousy with me thinking why can't there be 'real' magic like Willow has!!!"

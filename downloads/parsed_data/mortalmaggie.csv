Damn him, damn my brother to a fucking sodding hell. If he hadn't told Mother and Father about my stash, I'd have the money I need to buy what I want. I want acid, and I want it <i>now</i>. But, nooooo, dearest Michael had to cover his own tracks by making the parents focus on <i>mine</i>. God, I just hope Tristan's in a willing mood.

Is it raining outside? I really hope it isn't, because it would be a travesty if my hair got wet while I was taking a...er...break. Then again, I suppose I could always do a rain repelling charm, if I can remember it."

This was an actual email sent to all students at my school:

To:     All international students

Date:   10 March 2005
Subj:   Tanuki (raccoon dogs)

There have been some tanuki (raccoon dogs) around the Nakamiya

Please do not feed or touch these animals.  They are wild animals
and may bite.  They also carry parasites, and are dangerous.
Therefore, they should be completely avoided.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Anyway though, since this is a good place to put pictures, and Richard and I took lots and lots of pics because we were dressed up in Shinsaibashi yesterday before the concert, I'm going to be sooooo vain and post some! This is what my new pink loli dress looks like:

"event","I seriously never remember to update this journal. I guess its harder than I thought it would be to keep two ^^; Especially when the other one is so much easier to rant in than this one. 

At any rate, I had a really great weekend! yay! No homesickness or anything. I'm so pleased. 

I ended up seeing 12 bands total over the weekend (1 on Friday and the others in a 7 hour concert on Saturday). The concerts were at Esaka MUSE in ... Esaka obviously... I'd never been in that area so it was good to explore. We also went to Hommachi to Like an Edison's to get PANIC*ch tickets... I'm excited! Only 2 weeks!! Anyway, it was exhausting but really fun and exciting. I love Osaka <3 

Today I dropped my writing class because of the level change, and I know TCU is going to have something snide to say about that... but what can I do? Absolutely nothing, actually. The sensei is really super cool though and says that I can come buy and get the lessons from her and that she'll help me with them if I want. In that case I might be able to study hard and test for credit for the class... even if not, the kanji are things I need to learn anyway, and after studying them so much before now I'm not going to stop now that I'm in Japan >_>

I'm really hungry >o<// Uwah. I even ate today. How uncool.

See? This journal is boring. I guess when it's all over I'll have to revise some of the entries from my personal journal to use as my final project o_x

"event","Yesterday (it seems like it was a lot longer ago than that >_>), we went to Asuka for the ""Onda matsuri"" -- a festival for fertility. Asuka is as far from Hirakata as I've been not counting my landing in Tokyo. To give you an idea of how far, observe the map that won't really give you an idea at all:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v194/alexandrophile/japan/asuka/alljapan.jpg"">
Hirakata is halfway between Kyoto and Osaka ^^
It was really... COLD. And a very small town, quite deserted after the festival. And COLD. Did I mention it was cold??

The festival was certainly...  different. Because it was a festival for fertility, it was bound to be rather odd. It was basically compromised of taiko drumming at the beginning, some barely comprehensible skits by men in various masks, and the most fun part at the end: running from the guys in masks, who chased people with bamboo broom-like whips and hit them on the legs or rears when they caught them. I found out today that it means different things  depending on whom you get hit by, and only the female character is for pregnancy. That's good, because that was the only one I didn't get hit by.

<lj-cut text=""pics of the festival"">
I had a bad spot until Richard made space for me up on a ledge. So anyway, my pics aren't great. I think it may be karma for dropping my camera when we first got to Asuka, but I don't think I broke it.
 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v194/alexandrophile/japan/asuka/Picture034.jpg"">
A shrine maiden-- miko (at least I *think* she was miko)-- did a cool dance in between scenes of the play. I'm not sure why, but her outfit was soooo pretty! *__*

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v194/alexandrophile/japan/asuka/Picture049.jpg"">
Some of the costumed characters from the skits. I couldn't seem to catch pics of them doing anything interesting >_>;

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v194/alexandrophile/japan/asuka/Picture053a.jpg"">
Richard demonstrating what it's like to get hit by one of the demons. It usually didn't hurt, but sometimes... MAN! I got hit 6 or more times. Once I ran and he chased me down ^^; 
</lj-cut>

The 4 people I went with an I were the only foreigners there except for some blonde chick that vanished later on, so its not like we were forgettable or anything. We stuck out and that made us targets ^^;; It was ok, though. There wasn't any antipathy. Just a little bit of fascination I think. And some little girl beat me up (I swear! A tiny little girl hit me in the face three times!) Actually, along with the kid hitting me and getting beaten by the whip things, I also got hit right in the face with a hard-as-a-rock mochi and crushed when all the people around me fell over trying to get said peice of mochi. (Of course that was stupid; a TON of it was thrown out. I ended up with a peice in the end :3)

After that we went to Asuka Dera (Temple), which is said to be the oldest temple in Japan, and houses the oldest Daibutsu (literally ""big Buddha"", a giant statue of Buddha). It's a very pretty place and has a fascinating history-- apparently it was mostly destroyed by lightning at one point, and all that remains is the central area and the Daibutsu. If you're really interested, you can read more about it <a href=""http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/big-buddha-japan.shtml#asuka"">here</a>

<lj-cut text=""pics of the temple"">

Daibutsu. NONE of my pics of it turned out!! I don't know if it was the lighting or my camera was being evil or it was the will of Buddha, but they're all either blurry or have no flash at all >_>;
</lj-cut>

After that all we went to the bus stop and found that the bus wasn't going to be there until 5:36, an hour later, so we wandered around and ended up stumbling over some sort of burial mounds or something... I found them online last night but didn't save them and I don't remember anything ></ We were trying to find a restraunt or something to sit down in out of the freezing cold, but there was only one tiny, super cozy little place that was REALLY expensive. Like, 1500 yen for curry rice >_> I only got hot cocoa, which was really good and warmed me up (and rightfully so at 500 yen ><). One of the guys we were will for some reason wouldn't come into the place with us though, and opted to wait in the cold for the bus. When we left, we couldn't find him anywhere... until he called and told us the bus had come and that he'd LEFT. >O OMG. Rude. Luckily the scheduled bus did come though >_> If it hadn't, I'm not sure what we'd have done since it was 2 or 3 miles to the next stop, in the dark, in the cold, and I don't know about anyone else but I didn't remember how we got there x_x Anyway, we got back home at around 9 and I immediatly took a super hot shower, and it was all good. Quite the adventure.

Anyway. Quizzes and tests and other crap tomorrow. Wah. Oyasumi ^^/"

"event","I got a package from my mom today \^o^/ It was like Christmas! Cookies and salt packets and M&Ms and sweet&low and American ramen and canned chicken o_0 ... XD All good stuff. I was excited. Now I can eat something other than McDonalds :3 

I had to take my laptop back to the computer center at school today because I can't figure out why it won't connect to the net from my room. Of *course* it started doing it's goofy thing where it gets a bunch of lines all through the screen and won't boot up and everything like that ></ Scared the poor computer tech half to death. Luckily I was still in the building checking my mail and he was able to catch me. He kept saying, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I think your computer is broken, I'm sorry~!"" So THAT was fun to fix -_-\ Stupid thing. 
Anyway though, it was cute because on the way to school I passed by a group of kids playing, and a tiny little girl who was having a lot of trouble standing up on her scooter thing stopped and just stared at me. I smiled at her and she suddenly shouted, ""HARRO!"" and grinned really huge, and I said hello back. Then she started off on some incomprehensible Japanese, so I asked her in Japanese if she could repeat herself more slowly. At that she just stopped and stared again. Like this: o_o I imagine the thoughts in her head at that point were something like, ""What the hell is that huge pasty foreigner trying to do?! o_o"" I noticed then that her brother-- at least, she was calling him Oniisan-- and a bunch of people on the street were all looking at me too. That was uncomfortable -_-; But after a second the little girl just burst out laughing and said ""baibai!"" and finally got on her scooter and left. 
I'm not sure why I felt the need to report that, but I did -_-;; 

Right now I'm waiting for my laundry in the dryer, and while I guess I should be studying because I have 2 books to read by next week and a quiz in my writing class and possibly a test in speaking, I'm wasting time online because this is at least similar to some kind of human interaction. I'm just trying not to die of boredom =_="

I think I might have to drop one just out of necessity... either I drop one, or I die, you know? It's just too much. I'm not sure what TCU will think of that... but too bad for TCU...

I'm so glad I don't have to get up as early tomorrow! Even though I will anyway, I don't want to *have* to XD I only have one class, but lots of other busy work to do tomorrow. The says when I have few classes inevitably end up being the days when I have the most to do -_-//

"event","I don't update this journal often enough. I guess because I complain a lot and I don't want to complain to the public so I do it in my private journal instead >_> Are people confused yet? I know I am >_>

My first class starts in about 45 minutes. Nerd that I am, I came to school 2 hours early so that I could make sure to be to class on time. And I had to eat and buy a cable for my laptop. 1500+ yen. 1500!! That's about $15... the one I bought in the states was a third of that. And it's the SAME THING. ARRRGH >< The only reason I didn't bring it was that I was promised it was different T-T What a waste. 

I went to shop for a birthday card for my brother and learned that the Japanese take cards VERY seriously o_o None of this single-fold, picture-on-the-front, ""happy birthday""-inside nonsense. If it doesn't fold out or pop up or explode glitter, it plays music or doubles as an air freshener >_> The one I want to get is like, the uber card. Basically the only thing it doesn't do is boil water. But it also costs 780 yen >_> That's a lot for a card. 
Since I spent so much buying school supplies today, I'm going to have to count my yen before I buy much else. I also still need to cash my travellers checks. Not that I know how to do that or anything ><

So now that the kitchen in the dorms has opened I feel a bit better. I'm also sorta getting used to not eating very much. Which is uncomfortable, but I'm fat so it's not like it's hurting me terribly. Once I find salt, I'll be ok. Just need a little salt.
And laundry detergent. Because I have fabric softener -_-; And not detergent ></ I can always shop tomorrow afternoon though, but that still pisses me off... all because I don't understand Japanese well enough. I have really GOT to get a better handle on this language. If I don't, I'll starve to death and smell horrible to whole time ><//

Ok, its about time to go to class: Issues in Contemporary Japanese society. Wish me luck!"

"event","Yesterday we went to Kyoto! It was soooooooooooooo much fun! XD Not only is it beautiful and just everything you'd expect, travelling around with the group and especially the goofball guides made it a very energetic occasion. And I'm happy because we had Italian food for dinner XD Yey non-Japanese food! \^o^/

Anyway, bunches o' pics! Click on them to see the full size versions, which are really worth it, but they're HUGE so they'll take their sweet time to dl ^^

Look at the treeees! :o!!

Ok. I'm starting to get hungry and I think <lj user=""aintafraid2die""> went to sleep or something, so I'm considering running to the QQ by myself to buy foodstuffs. The days are too short here to get everything done! And I'm so not even joking. It gets dark sooo early o_o I don't really want to walk alone in the dark so I'll wait a bit longer and see if he pops up.
Bai bai ^^/"

"event","Yay! I had my first truly good day in Japan!! \^o^/

First there was class registration, and I got into everything I wanted, so yay! I won't know my official schedule including Japanese level and section until tomorrow, but my electives are set:
Modern Japanese Fiction
Social science method in Japan (I went and talked to the professor and he asked what I was most interested in, and I said VK, and he was pleased :3 He told me I could do my project over it XD)
Modern Japanese culture and society

Also, went to Osaka and saw my first live! As you can tell, it's really late here and I'm TIRED because I've been on my feet for 11 hours straight, but <lj user=""aintafraid2die""> showed me around Osaka today (thaaaaaaank you!). He's really the nicest guy ever. We went and saw Inugami Circus Dan. The show was a lot of fun. Before that though, there was much exploring. Here are a few pics:

From a mall type building that has circular escalators, taken from the balcony in front of the Fotus clothing store.

The entrance to the h.NAOTO shop XD Think THAT'S dorky? I also have pictures of the inside of the bathroom, which is super cool XD It was Richard's idea!! You can't take pics in the store, so that's all I could get XD

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v194/alexandrophile/japan/osaka001.jpg"">
The giant clown head thing in Amerikamura. What's inside? Secret! Just kidding. Its a clothing store :3

Ebisubashi in the dusk. It was very cold and I forgot a coat. But it was pretty and very lively.
</lj-cut>

So, it was exciting and fun :3 And also I ate today. Yay. Some people say that McDonalds should be done away with. I say it keeps me alive in Japan.

Oyasumi!!"

"event","I took some pictures tonight mostly because my roommate got really excited when she found out that I had a digital camera in my pocket. I haven't been taking a lot mostly because I haven't felt much like doing anything. 

First, we went to dinner at a small street side restaraunt like last night, and like last night I spent some 500 yen on something I couldn't manage to make myself swallow. Although, I told a few girls I was eating with my delimma and one of them gave me a different perspective-- I'm trying to hard to BE Japanese. I'm not Japanese though. I just simply might never like Japanese food. It's funny, but I never thought of it that way. I was too busy thinking about how I had to *make* myself like it. I mean... I'm not going to dress like a Japanese girl just because I'm here (believe me, I couldn't pull off the spike heel cowboy boots >_>). I don't have to like it. Tomorrow, I eat at McDonald's, and maybe even go to the market down the main road and buy some food to eat in my room. I still want to go out though, usually. If I stay in my room all the time, I'll just get more depressed. Anyway! The gist is that we took some pictures in the restaraunt.

Don't be fooled. This was nasty tempura. The plastic display food outside had shown it as the shrimp over rice, so I wanted to get it, I like battered shrimp and I like rice. Instead it came over udon-- fat noodles-- and the batter had all come off the shrimp and gotten puffy and mushy. Gross.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v194/alexandrophile/japan/Picture005.jpg"">
This is my roommate beside me. She refused to smile in a picture. I can't spell her name... it's Pascaline. It sounds like the name of a Texas town. She's from an island called Marutia or something in the Indian ocean but goes to school in Australia. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v194/alexandrophile/japan/Picture008.jpg"">
Jill and Adea... I can't spell Adea's name either, I'm just guessing. Jill is from Singapore originally and studies in the US, and Adea is from India, I think, studying in Australia. 
I think maybe these people are having an easier time than me because they've been going to school outside of their home country all this time, and I've never even been out of my state before...
</lj-cut>

I also took some pics of my dorm room. There are three of us in there now, but this weekend Sam will move out and it'll just be Pascaline and me.

Tomorrow I will get up early so that I can go to campus and talk to one of my prospective profs and get permission to be in a certain class, and then I'll register at 9:45. We drew lots, I got 132. That's not too bad. I heard that someone got 404 o_o I'd hate to be them >_> 

I'm so sleepy. I want to sleep for a month. I guess I should run and shower now so that I can be up early enough to do things, although I don't think that'll be a problem since I've been getting up at around 6am. Yick."

"event","I HAVE A BIG SOCCER GAME TOMORROW AND ITS LIKE THE BIGGEST GAME OF MY LIFE BUT I DO NOT HAVE THE MOOD TO GO ANYMORE. ITS EITHER I GO FOR THE SOCCER GAME OR I GO U2 TO BUY PANTS WITH IDAYU. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE ME??? BOTH ARE IMPORTANT TO ME BUT I CAN ONLY CHOOSE 1. ITS HARD WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND MY SITUATION. ALL I ASK IS SOME TIME OFF. BUT YET, SOME STILL THINK THAT WHAT I SAY DOENSNT MAKE ANY SENSE. 

I HATE IT WHEN YOU SAY TAT U WANT TO BUY THIS AND THIS AND ALL THE STUFF YOU WANT..ITS NOT WRONG BUT ITS PAINFULL TO ME THAT YOU WOULD RATHER GET THE STUFF YOU WANT THAN TO BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS. I KNOW WHO I AM TO YOU. ITS TIME TO MAKE A CHOICE. THIS REALLY SUCKS. HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SOMEONE AND SOMETHING I LOVE DOING. MY LIFE IS FUCKTUP!!! WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY WHEN EARLIER YOU SAID U WANTED TO BE WITH ME IN THE END YOU STILL WANT TO GO OUT TO BUY YOUR PANTS??? I TRY TO UNDERSTAND. THERE WILL BE OTHER DAYS TO BUY IT BUT. I JUST DONT LIKE YOU BE GOING HOME ALONE. 



MAYBE I AM JUST STUPID OR WHAT!!!

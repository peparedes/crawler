"event","Wow, two weeks into school and the only homework I have really is to read the 'Epic of Gilgamesh'...it sort of reminds me of Beowulf so I think I'll be fine. That's for later this weekend though, right now it's TGIF time! WOOOT!

I plan to ride my horse, all weekend, it'll be great. For me at least...Pep...might have some other ideas:

In other news: Finding out someone was able to smuggle a stick of dynamite in their CHECKED luggage does not help eleviate my dislike of flying...!! As a matter of fact it does the exact opposite, pictures of this keep going through my head:

Bastards. Knowing my luck that's exactly what would happen too! 

Some lady on her cellphone almost sideswiped my truck with her damn mini-van, thank god for my ""Cat-like Reflexes of Doom"". Otherwise I would probably not have a truck thanks to that looney toon talking on her damn cellphone. However, when I passed her after the fact, I didn't see her cellphone, I think she dropped it when I lay on the horn. Hehe.

Truck: 1

Mini-van: 0

That's about it from me for now, so I guess I'll leave you with today's song: The 8th of November.

The 8th of November - Big and Rich

He said goodbye to his momma..
As he left South Dakota..
To fight for the Red, White, and Blue..
He was 19 in green with a new M-16..
Just doin' what he had to do..

He was dropped in the jungle..
Where the choppers would rumble..
With the smell of napalm in the air..
Then the sargeant said, ""Look up ahead""..

And like a dark, evil cloud..
1,200 came down..
on him and 29 more..
They fought for their lives..
But most of them died..
In the 173rd Airborne..

On the 8th of November..
The angels were cryin'..
As they carried his brothers away..
With the fire rainin' down..
And the Hell all around..
There were few men left standin' that day..
Saw the eagle fly..
Through a clear, blue sky..
1965, the 8th of November..

Now hes 58..
And his ponytails grey..
But the battle still plays in his head..
He limps when he walks..
But hes strong when he talks..
About the shrapnel they left in leg..

He puts on a grey suit..
Over his airborne tattoo..
He ties it on one time a year..
And remembers the fallen..
As he orders a tall one..
And swallows it down with his tears..

On the 8th of November..
The angels were cryin'..
As they carried his brothers away..
With the fire rainin' down..
And the Hell all around..
There were few men left standin' that day..

"event","Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire?
Would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher...
If we roll from town to town and never shut it down...

Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover?
Would we walk even closer until the trip was over?
And would it be okay if I didn't know the way...?

If I gave you my hand would you take it?
And make me the happiest girl in the world?
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, boy...
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea?
Let me know if you're really a dream?
I love you so, so would you go with me?

Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together?
Could you not look down forever...
If you were lighter than a feather?
Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me?

If I gave you my hand would you take it?
And make me the happiest girl in the world?
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, boy...
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea?
Help me tie up the ends of a dream?
I gotta know, would you go with me?
I love you so, so would you go with me?"

Come up to meet you, 
Tell you I'm sorry, 
You don't know how lovely you are. 

I had to find you, 
Tell you I need you, 
Tell you I set you apart. 

Tell me your secrets, 
And ask me your questions, 
Oh, let's go back to the start. 

Runnin' in circles, 
Comin' up tails, 
Its only science apart. 

Nobody said it was easy, 
It's such a shame for us to part. 
Nobody said it was easy, 
No one ever said it would be this hard. 
Oh, take me back to the start. 

I was just guessing, 
At numbers and figures, 
Pulling the puzzles apart. 

Questions of science, 
Science and progress, 
Do not speak as loud as my heart. 

Tell me you love me, 
Come back and haunt me, 
Oh, when I rush to the start. 

Runnin' in circles, 
Chasin' tails, 
Comin' back as we are. 

Nobody said it was easy, 
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part. 
Nobody said it was easy, 
No one ever said it would be so hard. 
I'm goin' back to the start.

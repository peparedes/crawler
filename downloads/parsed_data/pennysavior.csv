"event","I was trolling thefacebook and I came across the profile of someone I've never met before. He sounds like such a great guy; so friendly and bright, and genuine. Maybe I'm just reading out of his profile what I want to, but if he didn't put it there, I wouldn't have even thought about him as existing. 

     And that's the problem. I, much like alot of other people nowadays, forget that others exist sometimes. It's so sad, especially to think that we're all in this (college, etc...) together, and yet......and yet......

     There's no need to be shallow, or shy, or picky, or mean, or too materialistic in all this. We all want to meet new people and have new experiences, and any prejudices should be thrown to the wayside and forgotten. So much could be cultivated from a little straightforwardness and sincerity.

     I lied. I had met the guy from thefacebook. And I judged him prematurely. And now I may never know anything about him other than the nastiness inside of me.

<P><BR><STRONG>(Genie Says</STRONG>: ""I get the impression that the big issue for you right now has something to do with death. Your writing also seems to contain underlying thoughts about security and trust. Is this coming from fear of a new, unknown situation and the ""death"" of an old one? Is there a chance this could also be an exciting new start? As Henry Ford said, ""Life is a series of experiences, each one of which makes us bigger, even though it is hard to realize this. For the world was built to develop character, and we must learn that the setbacks and griefs which we endure help us in our marching onward."")</P>

This summer's been a flying-f*ck and a half. But fun if anything else.

I've basically been offline (unless on my friend's computer) since April 27 b/c my Sony Vaio decided that after 14 months enough was enough and the motherboard failed. (That's right. 2 mos after warranty-expiration, and one day before my Anthro final, which had all the notes etc... online)
So, I got a B. And then I got a Dell. With an extended warranty.&nbsp; Serves me right. I guess. I'm a masochist. Hurt me.


COM-PU-TOR!!!!!! ::shaking fists violently in air:: (I have the most remarkably inane friends. I love you Daniel. And by love I mean I <i>will</i> get your kidneys.....soon......)


Right. Then began (trumpets and thunder-bolts) the Great Gettin'-the-F*uck-Out-Of-Dodge Migration!!&nbsp; Involving most of May and June.....moving truck....'tards.......and lots of debasement from my mother (and consequent crying from me.)
So now I officially have my permanent address in Haile Plantation. And lots of boxes in the attic (save for the one btw my legs.)

 <i>Things I'm gonna miss aboot Tally-ho:</i> 
Cabo's Bar & Grill (best vegi and seafood and burgers at the best college-money prices)
The Beta Bar and Floyd's Music Store. (great concerts)
My buds (but everybodys a'movin, so it ain't that bad)
Nothing else whatsoever.

Speakin' o' my buds and great concerts.....I went back to Tally June 6th for I would have to say the best concert I've ever been to. 
Authority Zero played the Beta Bar. 
I'm still stoked.
The almost- best part about it was that neither Juston or AJ knew who they were, and DT wasn't really sure aboot. Let's just say I am now the head honcho of coolsville.
The BB was so under-crowed that for a place that can hold&nbsp; close to 300 people there were maybe 60 that showed up for AZ. I couldn't believe how lucky we got that it was so intimate. We got to talk to them (and Daniel b/c--he's the nicest guy-- offered to smoke the band out) and found out about more dates and the Warped tour (They're playin in JAX) and ...and.....and.....I left my camera at home (dumbdumbdumbdumbdumb)
Next time. And everytime after that. 

I'm going&nbsp; Warped motherf*ckers!


<i>Other ""fun: parts of that night:</i> 
^Having my nose almost broken in a mosh by the nicest set of titties-in -a-tube-top I've seen...or felt against my nose cartilage...in the longest time. She's now an honorary member of the Titty Brigade. Class D Plus. (Envy that...bitches.)
^Gettin to tell the band <b>Whole Wheat Bread</b> (3 black dudes from Jax who play some kickin' rock and&nbsp; use cultural steriotyping of African Americans to promote themselves (chicken & grits & watermelon etc...) ) that they were in Tallahassee, where every cracker in the joint eats chicken and grits and watermelon.
^Doin' burnouts with my Volvo from The BB....McD....u-turns...etc....
^Gettin' pulled over by a Krispy Kreme Kritter (southern for&nbsp; ""oinker"") and lyin' my way out of a ticket for doin' burn-outs. 
(really...officer....I just got this car...it has a turbo...I don't know how to really handle it.... b/c i'm a sweet innocent sothern gal ......who's driving all her friends home as a favor......bullshit bullshit bullshit....).
 *I hope you know DT & AJ....if that cop had found your weed in my car.......forget what I'd do......my mom would have killed you....literally....painfully*
 ^Bingeing on Waffles@ WH at 2 AM.
 ^Sleeping it all off for the drive back in the mornin'.
 


Now I'm purdy much settled into the new family home. And attending Summer B for Stats. @ 9:30 in the morning. Inthe morning!!!
Ah yes. I really did miss all the judgement & rules & akward fighting-for-no-reason.&nbsp; No. Really. Tense emotional trauma fuels my creative being. (fuels it to fill the chamber of my Deagle.)
But all-in-all......I still live @ home.....for free......and being given my a'space.......that rocks. And I'm back with my puppy, Lady Di. I thought I was gonna fade without her.


I did help Juston and AJ move to a fly apartment in Orlando a couple a' weeks ago. That was fun. But O-do still gives me the heeby-geebies. And I hate I-4. Don't ask why.

Funny Story. (and by funny I mean prolly offensive. Oh well. ;P&nbsp; ) 
While over for a little dippy in my's new (freedom-is-as-easy-as-weighting-yourself-to-the-bottom-of-the) pool, PG ( a'thats a'Peter) asked why we bought the house. I remarked that it was built and owned previously by Jews.&nbsp; 
Yep. 
That was the first thing out of my mouth. 
Not that it wasn't the truth. And not that I don't really feel that way. (And not that the Goldenburgs son wasn't hotter than Hades.) 
Peter just laughed so hard that I kinda feel bad. Bad about not lying. Ain't that somethin'?&nbsp; I really feel like a Cathol now.
So after us a'gettin a'dressed, PG just happened to remark that this house reminded him of something akin to ( for all youse S. FLA-ites)&nbsp; Weston. 
Weston!?! WTF!!! 
What have I gotten myself into?! (sigh). 
I left S. FLA for a reason and here I am now......knee-deep in bad-memories crap.
Dammit Peter. You're gonna get me and my stupid mouth in trouble.&nbsp; And you shot.

And thank you again for inviting me to go to Europe...and NY... and San Fran...... with you. I would die to. I hope you know that. 
Priorities suck.

<i>Overall lessons learned so far this summer:</i>&nbsp; 
1) Weed + Beer = vegatarians (me) eating KFC b/c its the only thing there = hugging the porcelin piss-pot + vomiting for about 30 mins (uh....no more gettin stoned w/ big boys while hungry)1)
2) Titties really <i>can</i> kill.&nbsp; (yes!)
3) I'm not as much of a slacker as everyone thought I was....thinks I am.....I lie.
4) I really need to get down to Key West. I miss her so. Will you come with me?
5) Time flies. And apparently so do pigs. Go figure.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~And now...for something completely different~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


<b>Why</b>? Why? Why do I attract people who go on ""missions""? How in god's name do I do it over the internet? Why? How? 
And why do I bother to be gracious to these people???
And how the hell did she get my screenname???
I never know whats going on. 
It's prolly best that way."

"event","Sometime ago a militant absolutism formed which focused its campaign of revenge against the just punishment of previous crimes. However their retaliation was deliberately misplaced due to the group's timorousness in expressing opposition to larger powers. Thus it focused on the already historically bedeviled and lead to the mass destruction of whole groups of people- seeking to destroy the cultures and  heritages and the individuals themselves. Mass raids-mass graves- mass murder- mass destruction all took place while the world sat back and watched...... until the very edges of hell on earth had unseamed and engrossed most of the empyreal corporeality of our the terra firma.

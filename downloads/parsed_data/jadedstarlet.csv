"event","6 days before I leave for La Verne and i'm hella excited to start this new chapter of my life. I just have this overwhelming feeling of happiness, knowing that i'm going to be meeting amazing people and doing some amazing things. maybe meet the man of my dreams? *sigh* I can only hope. shit, i'm such a girl...

these past 2 weeks have just been non-stop parties every night. me being drunk off my ass each time, hung over and sleeping the next day and partying again. pretty much a toxic cycle. and i don't care. i've cared way too much for way too long. I guess this is just me getting everything off my chest, being free, not having to think about petty shit or being insecure because i'm leaving and won't be seeing 90% of these people ever again. and that's comforting. This desert holds so many memories for me. This summer in particular. i've done a lot of growing up in many ways. this whole year/moving here spawned a lot of self-discovery yet completely hindered my creative energy. maybe because my priorities were wrong, and have been wrong for awhile. it's funny to think of the person i was last year at this time. someone so different in so many ways.

Today I shall go pick up my friend Danielle from Riverside and then Friday I have to go to La Verne to meet with my counselor and get all my classes. I took the placement testing last week and surprisingly scored relatively high in math. pretty good for not dealing with numbers since my Junior Year. And I scored the highest on English possible. Yes! I also made friends with the Placement testing advisor. We just randomly started talking about politics and those who know me know I get really fire up. Well anyway, he theen proceeds to tell me that he is the professor of the peace politics course (which is kind of an environmental/green party centered course) that is already full but he would write me a note because he would be ""honored"" to have me in his class. Needless to say, i was ecstatic. 

Started packing, sorting through pictures, clothes, CD's, old notes from middle school haha. In many ways it is very comfortin to get rid of alot of these things...not to necessarily forget the memories but to move on, knowing that they will still be there. they'll never leave. but by leaving them behind there is now more room for the new memories i will create. 

Wow, this was a long entry. i need to write more often. love to you all."

"event","Here's another speech you wish I'd swallow
Another cue for you to fold your ears
Another train of thought too hard to follow
Chugging along to the song that belongs to
The shifting of gears
Please forgive me for my distance
The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love
I would've warned you, but really, what's the point?
Caution could but rarely ever helps

Don't be down when my demeanor tends to disappoint 
It's hard enough even trying to be civil to myself 

Do you just deal it out, or can you deal with 
What I lay down?

Please forgive me, for my distance
The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love"

"event","do you ever wonder? 

it's 2:05 am. i never know if it's just me, or if it's a universal thing, but it's times like these (often, indeed) that i am always curious about what certain people are doing. i don't know if it's my manifestation of curiosity or rather the dullness of my own day to day life that leads me to this, but i don't really mind it. i wonder what amanda is doing in her cozy little house in florida right now. i wonder if she's sleeping with a smile on her face. i know i've seen actors sleep like that, but i've never seen anyone in deep slumber with a smile on their face. i hope of all people, she is. or that she will one day at least. i wonder how carolyn and tom are doing. tom is such a great person. everytime i see him and care together, and they act like the adorable married couple they are, i can't help but feel so happy for them. because they needed each other. i wonder how my dad is doing. he lives alone, but i hope he doesn't feel alone. but then again, i guess that is one ultimate feeling: to be alone, but not feel alone. or rather, be alone...and happy. this summer i haven't really allowed time to be alone. i wander to liz's house everyday (or almost, anyway) for some small town adventures and a means to waste my summer away. and by waste, i mean spend it freely with no true intention other than the intention to spend it freely. in that sense, it's been a smooth ride. i wonder what scott is doing. just because he's a stranger that knows me. i mean, he really knows me. and that fascinates me. i love meeting people. tonight i was on the phone with an old friend and he was telling me some silly stories about sleeping in front of gas stations and whatnot, and i said, you know what, maybe i'll sleep in front of a gas station one day. i think the strangest place i've ever slept was at the carnival on the grass. i was fourteen then. i know i may be three years older, but right now, i don't really know if i'm that much wiser. i guess it's okay. i guess i still have room to grow up.
i hope i do, anyway."

went job hunting yesterday. (the Natures RX position seemd to already be filled, Nance) no one seems to be hiring AT ALL. ahhh though i'm going to be a camp counselor at the Palm Springs Desert Museum for 6-13 year olds from July 10-20 for 7 something an hour. should be fun, i suppose. as much as those little rascals can annoy me, i sure do love them.

Live music, good ambiance, some cute eye candy, yummy coffee, board games and oodles of books. Cigarette smoke on desert night air is quite soothing. and the stars don't get any more beautiful. some old vietnam veteran was on the corner screaming random obscenities at passing cars. we'd like to think he was the security of some sort. anyway, i've made a list of everything i'd like to do this summer. Highlights include:

Go camping
watch a movie at a drive-in
play at lake arrowhead
hike somewhere
readreadread
work A LOT and save some sort of money
learn a new instrument
organize my writing and officially get rid of this year-long writer's block i've had
educate myself on different religions, particularly buddhism
get those books on tape so i can re-learn spanish
meditate and become more spiritual
go to yoga

much more. but for now, that's ok. oh yes. and i really really want to see 'saved'"

i keep searching for something i'm just not finding. i know what i want and it frustrates me.

the lack of sleep is getting to me. work yesterday was quite funny. i was mixing ice-cream and slowly nodding off.

Grad Nite was fun. although they kept playing the same songs over. and over. and over. ""tipsy"" was a favorite but quite ironic being that NO ONE in the damned park was near tipsy. well maybe from lack of sleep i suppose. Sam, Nance, and i had our own little stalker and we danced with random people and rode the HAUNTED MANSION!! and Indiana Jones and Pirates. when we got off our last ride, the sky was light and was very odd. my sleep pattern is officially fucked."

"event","This is absolutely hilarious. Read the whole thing, i promise you'll get some laughs.

Last year, in the midst of springtime, United States President George W. Bush announced that we would be going to war with Iraq. Starting immediately, troops from the US would be sent to the Middle East to eliminate barbarian dictatorship, and restore a stable government. 

This message sent a shock throughout the good old US of A. Tree-huggers, B-list movie stars, and aging hippies all announced their discontent with the war. Right wing conservatives and their aging parents stood behind their troops, supporting them with every bomb they dropped on Iraq. However, the youth of America, confused by Bush's message of war, were lost in the mixed reactions of what was good and what was bad. 

Lost, alone, and alienated, young people looked far and wide for a leader to guide them through the rain and into a state of pride and encouragement. They finally found what they were looking for with one, simple battle cry that would resonate through the cultural borders of the country. It was almost as if they found their generation's version of ""American Pie."" Whenever they felt like they didn't have anyone to back them up, the youth of America had this proud statement to shout: 

<b>""To the window, to the walls. 
To the sweat drips down my balls. 
To all these bitches crawl."" </b>

So went the lyrics to ""Get Low,"" by Lil' Jon and the Eastside Boyz. Apparently, it has nothing to do with President Bush, the war in Iraq, or much of anything really. However, young people latched on to the song like rainwater to the dear sweet earth. Its slinky bass line, alarming sirens and catchy chorus proved to be infectious to many, dominating hip-hop, pop, and progressive polka stations far and wide. 

The week of Bush's announcement, ""Get Low"" started making a large impression upon the play lists of several nightclubs. A few months later, it turned into the anthem of the nation, climbing up the Billboard charts and placing itself among the most important songs of the twenty-first century. Since then, Lil' Jon has been making quite a few appearances, using is persona to make the world a better place for all. 

What is the appeal of the ""Get Low"" song? Why do so many young people look to these songs for comfort and support? Who the hell is Lil' Jon, anyway? Well, friends, before we talk about the egg, we must first analyze the chicken. 

To some, Lil' Jon may resemble a ghetto, drug-influenced version of Stevie Wonder. This is no coincidence. Like Mr. Wonder, Lil' Jon has long, considerably nappy dreadlocks. The main difference is that Lil' Jon uses his to cover the sides of his face. 

Lil' Jon and Stevie Wonder also share the same interest in eyewear, frequently shielding their eyes with sunglasses. Though Stevie wears his glasses because he is blind, Lil' Jon wears his for another equally important reason. If he took the glasses off, people who made eye contact with him would turn into stone. This, one can understand, would be very bad, because turning into stone is not considered a tax write-off. 

What, then, is this modern-day Jesus to do with his new-found responsibility to the world? Spread the message, of course! Since the emerging presence of ""Get Low,"" Lil' Jon has been making guest appearances on other rappers hits. In the Youngbloodz song ""Damn,"" for instance, Lil' Jon proclaims ""Don't start no stuff, won't be no stuff,"" while his friends chant, ""If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck!""

During his songs, Lil' Jon spews a few random words for no apparent reason. In any given song, you will hear him yell something to the nature of ""YEAH,"" ""OKAY,"" and ""WHAT!"" Often, he regurgitates these words as if he is having leg spasms, perhaps to release tension from the enormous power that he yields to society. 

The payoff for these deep political statements has been tremendous and successful. Lil' Jon's CD, The Kings of Crunk, has been certified platinum, selling a million copies nationwide. His songs have also been mainstays on the Billboard Hot 100, most recently with his guest appearance on Usher's song ""Yeah,"" in which, appropriately, he yells ""YEAH,"" at a frequent pace. 

However, the question of why people are so attracted to the man has yet to be answered. To look for possible solutions, we turn to a member of our very nation's youth. Travis Tally is a college student and football player who is a fan of Lil' Jon's work. Once he heard ""Get Low,"" Tally was immediately hooked. ""When I first heard the song, I was like 'This is some hot shit,'"" Tally said. The best thing about Lil' Jon's music, according to Tally, was its appeal to mainstream nightclubs. ""Once they hear it, people get on the floor.""
Tally even obtained Lil' Jon's lingo, when his football team suddenly started screaming the same words that the rapper does. They scream, Tally says, so that they can get energized. ""It's about being excited about where you are at.""

We have heard what our youth think of their messiah, but what does Lil' Jon himself have to say about his music? Recently, a fan asked Lil' Jon about what inspires him. ""I'm inspired to do my beats off of the artists that are around or really its just a feeling thing I make music by wut feels good,"" he answered. 

It's that kind of response that makes people so faithful to Lil' Jon. His message is so powerful: to answer a question, for instance, there is no urgency for punctuation. And who needs to spell ""what"" correctly anyway, right? We live in America and this is our land! No wonder Lil' Jon leaves such a powerful impact on people."

ya, i know, i'm a selfish bitch. hmph. 

i was just thinking about all the derogatory words you can call a woman. a bitch.cunt.whore.slut.skank. but how many words do we have for ""bitchy"" men? bastard. dick (and other spins on the word, i.e. dick face, dick head, etc.). uhh, anything else? bastard, more or less, refers to a state of being at that place in time. it doesn't necessarily refer to him as a person, whereas ""bitch"" personifies the woman as a whole. if you are labeled a ""bitch"" you aren't just seen as being that way in one isolated incident. you are a bitch til the end of time. well not really, but you catch my drift. i'm not a feminist, f.y.i. although i do believe in feminist ideals, woman's rights, etc.

The Flaming Lips put on an incredible show. but why wouldn't they, descending from outer space in a giant bubble? belle & sebastian, !!!, Elefant, Whitestarr, (Yes! free shirt which i used to soak up sweat!) and many more. One of the best moments of the day was lying on the grass, just as the stars were beinning to come out, listening to AIR. absolutely perfect. i smelled pot practically everywhere i turned, some chick decided to take off her shirt for the flaming lips, and some old hippies were dancing to their own beat. for a moment i thought, ""this is what Woodstock must have been a little like..."" The Sahara tent had this giant rave going later on at night and we had fun acting like we knew what we were doing. Despite the scorching heat, $5 lemonades, and some biatch squirting ketchup all over Nancy, it was a pretty dandy time. i did manage to get in an hour nap before Belle & Sebastian beside some tent. Oh yes, and i waited patiently ALL day for Le Tigre to come on at 11 but by that time, my migraine that i had suffered for 8 hours had begun to incapacitate me. They had the music blaring so excruciatingly loud that it was drowning out The Cure, which i didn't think was very respectful. though i do love Le Tigre. After <i> Metrocard</i> we said goodbye to Coachella and walked for 30 or 40 minutes to the car which seemed like it was parked on the other side of the universe. Upon arrival, wwe saw that someone decided to squirt sweet, cotton-candy smelling goo on the side of Nancy's car. ick.

"event","Ahh almost May. and i'm at a loss for words, again.

But i have a funny story.

There i was last week, walking down the street, minding my own business when some oafish-looking, baby-faced highschool boy approached me. 
oaf: (with his hand out) Hi, what's your name? I'm Bill.
Me: (thinking, who the hell names their child Bill anymore?) uhh, Allie.
oaf: Well Allie, I just had to meet you, being such a beautiful woman and all.
Me: (what a unique line! Bill must be REALLY creative...deciding to toy with his mind, i sit down with the oaf for a little chat, leading to a series of questions from Moi.) So Bill, what car do you drive?
Oaf: A Ford F150. I'm a football player.
Me: (Minus 10.) Ok. Muscal tastes?
Oaf: I'm really into Linkin Park and Slipknot.
Me: (cringing, minus 20.) Hmmm, Democrat or Republican?
Oaf: Republican. Who in their right mind isn't? Bush is my idol.

By this time, I got the hell out of there. Don't talk to boys named Bill. please, it's just not safe.

i've been in one of my moods lately. at first i thought i was just being hormonal, but the bitchiness was <b>way</b> out of hand. oh yes, everyone must love the anti-social, sracastic, near nervous-breakdown me. pulling away from everyone just made me happy, and maybe it still does. i guess you find out who your real friends are at this point. the people who are there for you and genuinely care about your well-being and want to spend time with you. nevertheless, i am constantly surprised by the revelations that arise in people's actions. at this point, i honestly don't care anymore. 

god, now i feel bad about my bitchiness toward poor Bill. 

San Francisco by August. Cool weather, Thank God. Then again, i sleep with socks, pj pants, and hooded sweaters here in Palm Springs. and my hands and feet are freakishly cold. San Fran also means i'll get to spend time with my aunt and uncle. Within the span of my whole life, i've seen them maybe 5 or 6 times which is quite sad. 

oooh. I had a chai frappacino from Starbuck's today and lemme tell you...it's Christmas in a cup. i swear. As i was sipping it, i was <i>this</i> close to whipping out my Santa hat and singing an absolutely smashing rendition of ""Jingle Bells.""

oh ya. Saturday night i ended up in DHS in the middle of some desert with a bunch of drunk people and i had to pee so bad but i wasn't about to pop a squat by some rabbit carcasses so i left. and i started tearing up on the way home listening to my favorite song because i'm sappy like that.  

Ciao, my lovelies."

i'm so fucking paranoid and wouldn't be surprised if i had some sort of psychological disorder. i always feel like there's some sort of insane conspiracy out against me. the world hates me. God hates me. i have this innate need for people to like me and i HATE it. hatehatehatehate. uggggh. i'm a ball of tension right now and my eye has been twitching for a couple weeks now. last time it twitched was when i moved out of my house and my dad moved out too. i think its catalyst could also be my extreme procrastination and fact that i can't even pass my classes anymore and i just want to sleep in. 

I think I've come to a point where I really want to do things in my own company for some time. The kind of things that let my mind flow generally elevating, reflective thoughts, and the kind, frankly, where I won't let people get to me. Where I get to be myself and be genuinely happy under my own rules. Individualism can be as motivating as it is selfish. Do things like watching Paper Moon beacause it has been too long. And taking some time out to re-visit my love for collaging. And creating a present for my best friend. And making myself cinnamon toast. Just like I did when I was six. And taking long walks and ending up under some tree with my journal and some pistachio nuts. and being back in Florida and driving around Southwest Ranches geetting lost in its beauty. Things I do when my mind and heart are two seperate bodies, things I do when I want an escape from life, in general. Or the trivialness of it anyways."

"event","The weekends are NEVER long enough. though i've managed to go through a plethora of emotions in such a short period of time. I spent 2 days in L.A. w/my 'rents and it cost wayyy too much. I think I must have been at 5 makeup counters in matter of days... goes to show what a makeup whore I am. Why oh why don't we have a Sephora here??? went to The Grove, Sunset, Santa Monica, Old Pasadena. had the most divine meal Friday night. sangria, saffron avocado walnut orange salad, portabello and greens, creme brulee. man oh man. I must have gained 5 pounds LOOKING at it. The music was loud and hot and the people were sexy and if my parentals weren't there, it would have been that much better.  I took my driving very seriously because I was trying to imprint the city's grid in my mind so when us girls take a day trip out over break, I won't get lost. although I have a feeling that will probably happen with me behind the wheel anyaway. Anyone up for shopping, dining, and scoping out celebs with moi? (p.s. I saved the silent movie theater for you, Meg)

when we first arrived in the city I eagerly looked for the Hollywood sign as usual. it makes me sad to see it, strangely enough. Hollywood is just this city of dreams...filled with thousands of people hoping and dreaming for a chance. a chance to ""make it big"" or ""get rich fast"" or be somebody and a lot of times their dreams stay just that. dreams. so much disappointment and heartache is embodied in that sign. and the fact that Peg Entwistle jumped to her death from it just makes it all that more clear to me. Not to sound morbid or anything but ya. Wow. I just wish I lived in old Hollywood. rubbing elbows with Douglas Fairbanks and Valentino and Gloria Swanson. F.Y.I., if you've never seen <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>, you should. rent it NOW. It is my absolute favoritest movieee.

oooh! i got the most amazing pair of shiny black BCBG pumps that unfourtanetly KILL my poor feetsies. When I was trying to walk around in them last night at The River, it was almost unbearable. but they looked hot so I guess anything for beauty? I eventually said thehellwithit and walked around barefoot. I got my fix of Japanese grub at Maki Maki and got free drinks and yummy Miso soup from the waiter. yay yay. 

Anyone else notice the large influx of lesbians in our valley? I actually think they are having some sort of convention by my house...when I pulled up today after working a 9-5, (btw MY CAR IS FIXED!!!) Melissa Etheridge was blasting and so was, strangely enough, Usher's ""yeah"" song. Hah. Kayla got a $20 tip from one gal at Ichiban for simply ""being beautiful"" and I got $5 from a group of them at Coldstone who pointed out that it was a ""personal tip."" 

I just love how Portishead, Tori, and Fiona can calm me down from a stressful day. I think it was on Bravo a while back that they aired a live Tori Amos concert. I almost cried when I watched. Her voice is simply angelic and powerful. That flowing red hair and quirky mouth make her that more elf-like. When she sings it's as though she's sprinkling magic dust over her audeience, sending them into a tranquil state. ahhh. what can I say? I love love love Tori.

How incredibly sexy is Chris Isaak's voice? oh wow. I'll play <i>wicked games</i> with you anytime...

I'm a happy girl because I spent my hard earned money on mindless clothes and purses and makeup, got a shift-leader position at Coldstone (an extra quarter, whoop-dee-doo), and am seeing Sleater-Kinney and a load of fab bands at Coachella Fest. Did I mention that MADONNA IS COMING MAY 24TH?!?!?!?! I almost hyperventilated when I found out. Oh, how I love thee.

The hunt is on for a prom date. Ok, that just depressed me. <i> Moving On...</i>

Oh yes. My car is going to be in a coma for awhile. Something to do with the water pump but I don't really understand automechanic language so I could be wrong. My freedom is lost and I absolutely despise bumming rides off of people. Ugggh.

School is wretched as usual. Last week I came to school ready to shoot myself after dealing with my psycho-bitch mother and had to endure mindless work from mindless teachers and found myself throwing my arms into the air dramatically and screaming ""drats!"" Haha. Quite funny considering most people would say ""fuck"" or ""shit"" but no, I said ""drats"". Go figure.

Spring Break is just around the bend and am waiting in extreme anticipation for a whole glorious week of sleeping in early, tanning poolside, staying out late at night, taking day trips out of town and soaking up all the goodness of the lovely people in my life.

Has anyone else ever noticed that little room at the Mary Pickford theater with all her belongings and memorabilia and whatnot? I swear I was in heaven when I saw it all. That made me happy. 

I've always loved the time of day when you climb into bed, let your head hit the pillow and you think about the day or life in general right before going to sleep. That's when all my snazziest notions take form and that's when I think I am most content. I hope and dream for things that make me truly satisfied. It's MY TIME and I know it will always be there. and no one can take that away.

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newpaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes
</lj-cut>


Anywho, I can feel myself ready to break out. There's this spot on my nose that I know is just about ready to bubble up. Wow. That sounds really nasty haha. I think I need another facial although the first one was extremely painful and involved something that looked to me like cheese-cloth and this electric-shocking wand thingy. I guess it worked because I didn't break out for like 3 weeks. 

Tomorrow I go to the dentist. Oh glorious day. And then it's the Gov't pot-luck lunch which I find simply adorable. (like Sam and Meg's new hair!) Saturday I will be debating at the JSA Mini-Con representing Nader on Environmental issues. I really didn't think I was that strong to do it but I guess some people think otherwise which is very reassuring. I'm sure Bingham thought I was mute for a large portion of this year. I still have no clue why I don't really speak up in that class. Maybe because I have so many thoughts going on at once in my head that I can't organize them, and when I do try to speak, it comes out all jumbled. Most of the time, I'm screaming at people in my mind and a smile will grace my lips out of no where and I'll start to chuckle. I wouldn't be surprised if my classmates thought I was utterly insane.

Oooh! My amazing aunt and uncle are coming down from San Francisco Saturday, and I haven't seen them since freshman year. My aunt is absolutely incredible. She still uses ""trippy"" in her daily vocab, is addicted to chapstick, and paints on her little easel each day. I love her to death...

Tonight was gorgeous. No, scratch that. This whole day was gorgeous. It was warm, but not too warm. A slight breeze that allows the day to melt into a cooler night. 

It's funny how seeing my girlies can turn a frown upside-down. Not to mention the coffee and that wonderful little bench in front of Mosaic... These weeknights have been heartwarming.

"event","I'm never satisfied with anything I write anymore...and it scares me to think that I may have lost my knack for the art. It's the one thing that I am truly passionate about...words. Long, elaborate, beautiful words that I find incredibly amazing. (You'd never think someone could have such a love affair with their thesaurus.) I get nervous and fidgety at the fact that the words just don't come out the same anymore...it's as though I'm a bottle, ready to burst, but the cork is on too tight. This whole year has been host to an all-out internal war. My insecurities, disappointments. All hidden because I think it's selfish to bring them upon others. 

But I can feel summer coming and it brings with it a change of emotions. Summer is what comes to mind when I think of Palm Springs, maybe because much of my life spent here was during those three scorching months. In a lot of ways, I find comfort in its dry heat, blowing on my face. The hot, summer nights when my sunburn would be hidden under the moonlight and I would sleep with the windows open, able to hear the secret movements of the nocturnal world. I was always able to understand so much more those summer nights. Everything was right in this world and I was utterly content in my childlike naivete. 

I love when you lay down on the grass and it's so warm and it smells so intense. Or when you're at the beach, laying on your towel, and it sounds like you've just encased yourself in a shell, you don't hear anything the same way. I want to be able to take off my sweater and expose my shoulders and not shudder with cold induced pain. It feels like my bones are only exposed and they're ready to crack. Everywhere i go feels like a hospital room. but, summer.. 

<i>summer. sum-mer. mmm. Just the thought of it makes me dizzy with want. I wonder what summer means. Probably has some Latin root. Everything has a Latin root. But everyone knows what summer really means... sunshine. daffodils. tank tops. sandals. late nights. cool breezes.</i> 

In the summer, the sun ripens the jasmine in my front yard and I swear it smells like the sweetest most delicious thing i've ever smelled. if I could capture that smell, I swear i'd bathe in it. I want to stay up til 3am, inebriated from heat or love and ride my bike to the beach or to an empty intersection and ride in circles. surreal. I want unbearable heat, sunkissed noses, smells of bbq's and coconuts and bananas and cigarette smoke lingering on dry still heat. That feeling of my back being slightly burned and laying on that heavenly haremesque bed covered in that peach yogurt towel comforter. Nothing ever felt so amazing. The sound of summer is only dissidence.

And when we lay beside each other, you comfort me and brush my tears away. I want to be in love. Pure, undying love. I want to be best friends with you. I hurt because of your absence. I'm in pain. I'm hurting, can't you see? I'm lost without you. Everyday is a lie and I cannot see clearly. When I find you, I'll know, and I'll never let go. Everyone else will be a distant memory. I want to go to sleep with and make love with incense burning and candles lit. I want to wake up to you and your hot breath and brew tea and make muffins. We'll walk down the street and I'll have a smile plastered to my face, wanting to share this love with the world. We'll sit on the pier or read books or listen to good music and then we'll make thai food for dinner. But we won't need food, beacause we will be feasting on each other, and there won't be any hunger left. When I look into your eyes, everything is real. I'm finally real."

"event","Ya, so I can't go back to sleep after taking a 4 hour nap. Maybe it's a good thing because I still have a shit-load of homework to do, that of course, I have left to the last minute. Would you expect anything else from me? haha. My hair's still wet and I am too lazy to dry it and I just ate a blueberry Eggo waffle. Leggo my Eggo. Ya, ok, wow I'm a dork. That reminds me of those little baby cinnamon and sugar Eggo's I used to eat in Elementary school. Mmm. 

I need some organization in my life. You take one look at my bookbag or room or my car and you can tell that my life is in complete chaos. I used to know what I was doing. I used to not fail my classes. I used to make my parents proud. Now I am just this big failure. I just can't seem to get the puzzle pieces of my life together. I try, but I'm not able to find those certain pieces and when I get frustrated, I tear the puzzle apart and try to start all over again. Some people just have it together and I wonder why I can't be more like them. I'm never good enough anymore.

In a lot of ways, I don't want to write in this thing anymore. I kind of feel like it has made me really vulnerable and maybe I put to much of myself on here. The thrill is kind of gone for me I suppose. It's not my fault it's so addicting. Knowing me, I'll say this and then you'll see a string of posts from me in a few short days.

I want to take up art classes again. I was never really good at it but they always made me feel important and allowed for my creative juices to flow. I remember always feeling really accomplished when leaving, knowing that I was creating something. Each brushstroke or pasted on picture was done under my power. (Goes to show how much of a control freak I am.) That says a lot more than how school ever made me feel. 

Hmmm, I'm looking over at my bed right now and it looks really good. My pillow is fluffy and my comforter looks very warm and inviting.

"event","So the elections are finally over. All 3 of us Greenies did pretty well. I wrote the speech in 5 minutes, made the posters that morning, and gathered my info together in just a few minutes. Sam provided comic relief, Angel was eloquent as usual, and I'm just glad I got my thoughts out in the open... I never really cared about winning anyway. I think it was more about getting the student body informed on the candidates and their issues. 

I hope Edwards wins the real primaries though, I really fancy him. 
(*Edit* Am very stupid...I KNEW he dropped out but I had a brain fart. Well I liked him best anyway...)

I still need to see ""The Passion"" movie. It looks like it is absolutely beautiful -- the scenes, costume, makeup, script. I am not religious, but I will always respect all kinds of cinema. 

When I saw the Dateline program a while back, I got out my mom's Bible, no joke, and started reading it. (It had been at least 6 years.) I wanted to find all the idiosyncracies in it pertaining to issues we face now, like homosexual marriage. Now that I'm older, I actually understand this book. And with a more un-biased view on it, I am able to see it for what it really is. 

It is so fascinating to me. 

A book, written thousands of years ago that dictates people's lives, actions, and beliefs. I remember my Bio 2 teacher telling me that she had read the whole thing front to back, and actually studied it, for historical and literary purposes. I found this utterly amazing. Many people who do not believe in Christianity write off the whole Bible as a book just because they don't care. I like to think otherwise. There's a wealth of information in it. Though I may not agree with everything it preaches, I am interested in learning these views. In literature, there are so many allusions, and if you are not aware of the Bible's basic stories, it's easy to become lost. I love the chance to challenge these writings and researching what they REALLY mean, and not what white conservatists have interpreted them to be. Interpretation really plays a large part into how you perceive it, or even Christ for that matter. That's why I've waited so long to see this movie. I don't need a horrific, gruesome reminder of how he died. I choose to remember how he lived. Everyone has a different image of this man in their mind, whether they even believed he actually existed or not. Some see him as false while others see him as the definition of truth, the ""Savior"" or ""Messiah"". The Jews are in total disagreement with Christians over his existence.  Africans and Middle Easterners saw him as a man of African or Indian decent, while the Western World saw him as a white man. Buddhists believed he was an enlightened being who studied Yoga. (Christians would oppose this militantly) 

Many times, a movie has the power to change a person's perception of a character, person, etc.  I would read books and have this image of the character in my mind but when I saw the book portrayed in film, my mind began to see another picture of this character. To this day, I cannot change that. I have many different opinions on this biblical man for I have seen both sides of the issue. Raised in the church, I was lead to believe only one side of the issue my whole life. Controlled by my parent's beliefs mainly, I was close-minded. It repulses me. Now I am able to see more clearly and I am not shadowed by anybody else's beliefs. I respect everyone's side of an issue. With a movie that is extremely biased over a sensitive subject, I am planning on watching with a very un-biased view on things. I will try to discard all my opinions, for I think that is what this film calls for.

"event","I haven't left my house for 4 days straight...haven't seen anybody except my crazy family. I've never really talked about my family, have I? 

Well my father is this Argentinian, hot-tempered Latin with an accent as thick as creamed corn. Hmm, strange analogy. He's every stereotype of a Latino, or Argentinian for that matter. He eats more steak and meat than anyone I know, and as a vegetarian, it's disturbing. He has an obsession with his barbeque, I swear. He doesn't really understand American culture, so it takes a long time to explain anything to him. When I went to Argentina to visit that side of my family, it was truly one of the best experiences of my life. The country is absolutely gorgeous. So European for South America. The culture was vibrant and buzzing and always moving. I guess when people eat dinner at 10:00 PM, it has to. Sometimes I wish I could connect with that part of me more. And I wish my father had taught me Spanish. He's also fluent in Italian, but I guess he was just too busy.

My mum grew up outside of Chicago and she was incredibly interesting until she became a conservative Christian. She traveled all over, from Manila to Rome. She was a disco dancing diva, an activist, a writer. An AMAZING sense of humor. But sometimes it's hard to imagine she was ever <i>any</i> of those things. I guess that's why I'm so against organized religion, because it took my mom away from me. What I knew her as...stimulating and amazing. It made her close-minded and bitter and it's hard for me to deal with at times. 

My aunt and uncle are incredibly self-absorbed. My uncle is a chef and artist. Most of his work resembles Pollack so it's debatable whether that should even be considered art. Ehh, I think it looks pretty snazzy. He studied in India as a Yogi and goes to Thailand every summer, collecting art, masks, and statues. His collection is pretty incredible. My aunt is a has-been stage, film, and TV actress who starred in spaghetti westerns as a teen and moved on to soaps later on. The stage suits her best I believe. When she was in her one-woman show about Emily Dickinson, she really blew me away. She is also a yoga teacher and is a bit of a lush. Ok, that's an understatement.

I don't know why I just described my family to you all. Haha. Another pointless post.

It's funny how a smell or a sound or a taste can help you to remember. remember the good and the bad. I wanted to run out and play in the rain but without somebody to enjoy it with, it kind of seemed pointless. Instead, I decided to have a ""dye my hair and burn my scalp with evil ammonia"" party with only one attendee -- myself. Ya, my scalp is pink around my forehead. Yikes. Ehh, it's only hair I suppose. 

School is really pointless these days. I'm hardly ever there anyway. It seems like all I want to do is have fun. Do everything my heart desires. Savor these moments with these people in this place and make that my first priority. It's a constant struggle between what I want and what I <b>should</b> want. I don't think I've done everything I've wanted to do, or said everything I've wanted to say. I think that's important. I don't want to hold myself back anymore, I've done that for too long.

Today brought back memories from 8th grade -- playing mini golf at Boomer's. I still can't get a hole-in-one without cheating! haha now that I think of 8th grade, I am reminded of my many Friday nights spent at the local roller-skating rink, Galaxy Skateway. That place was straight out of the 70's...same decor, same owners. intense cigarette smoke, pre-teens getting high and making out in the bathroom and then dancing the night away out on the rink to ""Barbie Girl"" and the Spice Girls under the giant disco ball. there was even some break-dancing on the side from some very pitiful young boys. Sadly, I remember doing the chicken dance. Wait, the chicken dance was effing great!

Anyone have any favorite roads? In Florida, I used to love Pine Island Road. it seemed to go on forever, merging into other streets. There were really gorgeous trees on it and during the insanely hot, indian summers I remember going down it with my family, sandwiches packed in the back on the way to the beach. My mom used to put them in the backseat so they would get warm and toasty but down at the water, my food never tasted very good. I think it was all that salty air. 

In Palm Springs, I'm obsessed with Gene Autry. At around 5:00 in the evening, passing Oasis Water Park toward DHS, you have this absolutely beautiful view of the whole valley. The sun is setting and it hits the mountains in the distance at different areas, like there are giant spotlights on them. It truly is breathtaking. I sound like a kook when I say this, but I strongly believe this valley is incredibly spiritual. When I used to come here every summer as a child, I remember never wanting to leave. The Santa Anas kicked up their heels and the lemon trees in my grama's backyard intoxicated my every being. I'd be a tanned, freckled baby by August and I'd come back with stories to tell my friends, who would all be green with envy. I'm extremely sensitive to my surroundings and this valley just emanates a warmth, like a mother's womb. It's safe. maybe too safe. people are itching to leave but it's hard to not look back; at least for me."

I'm just so disgusted with myself. I suppose I stopped caring somewhere down the line. I've become such a dreamer...that's all I really am anymore. I used to act upon my ambitions, but I can't help that I've become so uninspired. I used to do it to gain affection but I've gotten to the point where other people just don't affect me as much anymore. My peers disappoint me. I find that everyone is just putting on an act and I wonder if I am just a part of this production as well. What part do I play? What part do we all play? I see people walk down the halls and I feel like I see more than what meets the eye. I keep trying to pick apart the layers and I get tangled up in them. Sometimes I think I see parts of others that they don't even see themselves. I suppose that can be reciprocated as well. I am not speaking as though I am this omniprescent, all-knowing being because I know I probably put up a facade as well, to a certain extent. 

Sometimes I feel like driving and never stopping, to see how far I can go. Sometimes I feel like writing, rambling on and on, and never ceasing. I don't think about it as I write, I just let flow whatever comes to mind and when I look back on it, I am amazed at how much insight I have to learn about myself. Some days I think I've got myself figured out and then I look in the mirror and see another person staring back. I get nervous. Nervous at other people's complacency and I wonder if I'm the oddity. I know I think too much. Maybe that's my downfall. I want too much....maybe something that is too perfect. I get detached from reality and I feel like I have to constantly reel myself back in. It sickens me how I am constantly acting out the part of psychologist to my inner-most, deepest feelings. It sickens me how I trust and give so much of myself to everyone around me. I wear my heart on my sleeve and people takee advantage of that. I can feel myself clam up when I'm uncomfortable, and I don't like it. Maybe I just haven't found my niche. 

I'm tired of always feeling like I've failed. i feel like one day i'll have an epiphany and i'll know what my destiny is and my direction will be set in stone. but right now i feel like i didn't take the road less traveled, or the road always traveled. i feel like i jumped into some bush and i can't see anything, except everyone choosing a road out of here. 

i feel like everyone got some sort of life instruction manual and they forgot to hand one to me."

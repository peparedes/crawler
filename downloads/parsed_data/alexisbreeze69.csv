"event","*! Hey Hey*!

Well.. Stacey gets un grounded tomorrow!! Yes I am so excited!... and then Megan, Matt, Stacey and I have plans to go to the inferno tomorrow night!! We are going to have a blast because when us four get together.. haha its CRAZZYYY! So excited!

Well.. I am not that mad at my grandpa anymore. This Morning he came over and asked my mom if he could talk to me about everything and then he explained to me that if I ever need anything I can talk to him. Apart of me still knows how pussy whipped the man is but I dont know I guess I dont really care because it is not my problem anymore so I am just going to let it go. The only thing I hate is how he mentions shit that Staceys mom finds in her room... like our alcohol bottles... he said we had four of them and he said it right infront of my mom.. I was like "" SHIT"" lol but she didnt even say anything so hopefully she didnt really care. Aslong as he doesnt mention the other shit that her mom found I am good. LOL.. but O well!

  Things are so crazy right now!!! It really sucks because guys are pissing me off so bad! I mean my problems are not really that bad with guys but I still dont know what to do about Stacey and her problems. She is so confused with what she should do about Skyler because she likes him so much!!! I would say go for him but apart of me knows how he would be. I think they would be happy together but then again if some other chick was with sky and Stacey wasnt there I honestly think he would cheat in a second, I would approve of Stacey going out with him cause in order to have a boyfriend the guy has to get along with both of us cause my bestfriend always come first and him and I get along awesome! BUT GUYS STILL SUCK!!
They make me so confused and I hate it. Thats where all my stress comes from.. FRICKEN GUYS!!! 

   I am still really confused with Nick. I dont know what to do or anything. He is working right now! All I know is I really want to hang out with him soon because we have a blast when we get together. Idk maybe he will call tonight so I can talk to him...... and Stacey needs to call me so we can talk about how dumb guys are lol..... 

...Well I am gonna go because I am watching SwimFan and this movie is really fucked up lol.... So I will update it all lata!!..

              Love you all Muah!"

Yea! I know.... I already written today but that wasn't intill I realized something. Its crazy how in just one day everything can turn around and change.
I CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT NICK!! It sucks really really bad... because it's Nicholas, but I like him so much!! Right now he is snowboarding with Mr. David Stone. Hopefully those two fuckers are not killing themselves because I know I really suck at snowboarding.. lol.. but Nick said he would teach me how.. so I am excited about that. Stacey and I are going to learn from Nick and Anus... so they better be good lol. 
 I wish I could tell Nick how I really feel about him but it's hard because I dont know what he is going to say. Eric keeps telling me to tell him how I feel but its still weird because how good of friends we are even though he already knows how much I like him. I * REALLY* hope we end up together though because the thing I really want for Nick is for him to be happy and I know I will treat him right!! ( BUTTERFLIES)

  Anywayz....Enough talking about Nick... I need to let some feelings out about someone that I liked before I liked Nick. I wanna say so much shit about him but I just cant because I dont want to leave off on a bad note with anyone.. even though he is the biggest Jerk because he doesnt care about anybody but himself. He always complains about how bad he has it and BLA BLA BLA... even though I bet if I asked him to his face he couldnt even define the true meaning of a bad life. Being a ass to a girl that poured her heart out to you.. isint exactly a bad life. I would really just love to say "" Sports is the only thing you can fall back on.. well BOO STINKIN WHO... THATS LIFE GET OVER IT!! YOU WIN SOME.. YOU LOSE SOME.. YOU HAVE BAD DAYS.. AND SUCKY DAYS... FRIENDS TURN THEIR BACKS ON YOU... YOU MAKE NEW FRIENDS...PARENTS TREAT YOU LIKE SHIT.. BAM.. DEAL WITH IT! LIFES A BITCH! Sweetie I learned that lesson along time ago.... the way you treated me made my life suck even worse but then I realized I can do so much better then you. I dont need you playing with my head and breaking my heart the next day. I found someone that will actually treat me the way I should be treated...... even though I still have faith that ONE day I could go back to liking you which I dont doubt it.. but intill then.. have a nice life!!..... I still have respect for you.. but doesnt seem like you feel the same.. cuz you really need to get your act together.. and learn how to treat people""... GRRR if I could just tell him that lol....

  STACEY MIGHT GET UNGROUNDED THIS WEEKEND! YES PARTY!! We have so much fun together when we hang out I love it. Maybe we will hang out with Nicholas... :- )    
Well I am gonna go but I will Update!... Muah!

 
                             <3 Much Love <3

There's a melody in my head* 
And I ain't stopped hummin' it since I saw your face 
There's a feeling I can't forget 
It started with you kissing me that way 
And there's no end in sight 
Like an Oklahoma wheat field blowin' 
You've got my heart in motion, and I'm gone 
I'm the pinks and you're the reds 
Just like this sunset, we belong 
And there's no end in sight...... 

How high is the sky 
How long is time 
With you is how I'm spending mine 
Like there is no end in sight 
I wanna laugh 
I wanna live 
I'm gonna love you like there is, like there is no end in sight 

...AHH I love this song! Its my favorite song in the world right now.."" Yea I know its country but country is the SHIT""... ( only music I can actually sing good) LOL... but anywayz...


   

For the past like 2 days I have been over my sisters house. The thing that sucks about home schooling is I have to babysit my nephew every Monday and Thursday but its not that bad because I do get paid for it.     Last night my big sis and I spent time talking about everything. It was actually nice for a change because I got a chance to tell her about everything going on in my life. I miss being able to just talk to her when I had a problem because she doesnt live at home anymore and now that she has her own family now sometimes I feel like I am not that important to her anymore. She tells me that I am but sometimes it just doesnt feel that way. 
 
I had such a hard time sleeping last night because I been thinking so much about everything going on in my life, Tamber had a hard time sleeping too. Lately I been constantly thinking about *Nick* and its so weird because he used to be just a friend to me but now I see him so much more. We been such good friends for like 3 years and I would hate to ruin everything that we have now if something ends up happending between us. He called me last night before I went to bed and thanks to Anus ( ERIC)lol he knows exactly how I feel about him. I been telling Anus everything and of course the moron tells lol even though I know I would tell *Stacey* if anus liked her because she is my bestfriend just like Nick is Anus's bestfriend.
I had a feeling that Nick already knew that I liked him but he still tried getting it out of me. I ended up telling him how I felt. I didnt tell him everything just that I do like him.

 I think if Nick and I did end up together we would make a really good couple because we do have everything in common and I feel so happy and comptorable around him. Normally around guys I dont feel that way, even though when I am with Stacey I do act like myself, but Nick gives me a different feeling. He makes me feel special and thats what I love about him because I can just be myself no problem and he sees me the way I am. Stacey told me she has a feeling that we are going to end up going out and I have a feeling too... and I love being able to talk to Stace about this because she is my bestfriend and she knows when it comes to guys I bring on alot of problems. (For Ex. Kevin and Matt.)
 Matt and I got into a argument yesterday about tons of shit. Sometimes I get so sick of people pretending like they know me and stace. The only person that knows the true me is Stacey and she is the * ONLY* person I trust. Matt got pissed at me for telling him how I really feel and then i told Stacey everything she said and then she got pissed at Matt. LOL.. it was pretty funny at the time because Stace and I dont take shit from guys and him and Sky have confused the piss out of me and stace for the past like month and I finally realized how I just want to be friends with Matt. He is like what you would call ( THE PERFECT GUY TO MAKE THE PERFECT BOYFRIEND) but I dont know him and I just do not * CLICK* I am still more then willing to be friends with him. Hanging out is cool but I just dont want him thinking that i want to be more. I still dont know how Stace feels about Sky but I am always here to help her with her love life.
 I am so sick and tired of *Kevins* shit. I havent been thinking about him but I still feel bad for all the things i said to him because he really didnt deserve to hear those words come out of my mouth. I didnt mean any of them because I used to think he was the most perfect guy and i wanted to be with him so bad, but I dont know something came over me.. there is still a huge part of me that does dont get me wrong but I am so sick of telling him how I feel about him and making him the center of my world and trying to impress him and making him see how awesome he really is because I cant take the chance of him hurting me again. I dont know I look at it this way "" he is like touching the stars...never going to touch them but then again I just have to keep trying"" I used to think I should but now its not even worth it. If he doesnt wanna even give me the time of day then so be it. Its not my problem anymore and if he doesnt except my apoligie then screw it!!
  It sucks that *Stacey* is grounded. It really pisses me off, because she is the only person that makes me have good days. My grandpa pisses me off so much because he is so pussy whipped and he is such a asshole. He loves to just try and get me in trouble I swear that man goes out of his way to try and find things out about Stace and I to rat us out. I would just love to tell that cock to "" leave us the fuck alone and worry about his own damn problems"". FUCKER!!!!
 Well I am finished for now.. but I will update...

"event","*~ Well here I am on this Sunday night*~
I just got back from Staceys not to long ago, and I am tired as hell. The nights me and that girl have are crazy. We have so much fun together and it just makes me think of all the good things in life and not the bad. Last night Stacey and I had Matt and Sky over. It was really occured in away cause I still dont know what is going on with me and Matt. He is such a nice guy but I just dont see myself and him together. I think we are better off and friends and I think we would have a better relationship that way. Things between us changed anyways so its not like its that important to me anymore, but we all still had a blast. We watched Jackass and laughed our asses off and after Sky and I had a Marshmellow fight with the Marshmellow guns Stacey has in her basement and then Stacey and I beat the shit out of Sky with a flute and a rain stick lol. He probably has bruises all over him but it was fun for us lol. Afterwards Stacey and I did our thing like we always do in got into a shit load of trouble. I swear when I am with her she makes me such a retard sometimes lol but then again I dont know what I would do without her she is my bestfriend in the world. 
Everything is just so complicated anymore between guys and everything. I am kinda in the stage where I wanna be with someone, but the people that wanna be with me I just dont wanna be with them. I guess I just dont feel the connection. I am looking for one guy that I feel comptorable around and even if I do feel that way around certain guys it more of a friend way and just when I think I found the guy that I do like I end up changing my mind and it really sucks cuz I wish I could find Mr. Right. In away I am looking for a long term relationship with someone but then I hate being tied down to one person because it always causes so much drama! Dont know what I want!"

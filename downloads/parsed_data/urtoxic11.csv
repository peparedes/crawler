Oh and me and Abbey are going to the Ashlee Simpson concert in March :0 <---SO excited

Yea, so yesterday i tried to clean up my room. It didnt work.
Kaitlyn, Liz, and Sara came over and we hung out <--- always fun!

Yesterday i woke up at like 1:30 so i wasn't very tired when i decided to go to bed at 11 since i had to get up early for volleyball practice.
I think i finally fell asleep at like 3 am then i had to get up at 7:30 <--- not fun

So this morning i didn't feel so hot but it's all good since practice wasnt too bad.
We have 15 people on our team and there were 8 people there so we scrimmaged and such.
But i kept getting really dizzy and i could see straight, sorta like i was REALLY REALLY drunk
Then me and my daddy went to the bagel store and came home and i had to babysit angela
^thats pretty much all i did today 

Possibly going to Liz's tonight to hang out IF SHE EVER CALLS BACK lol

"event","Dear journal,
I forgot you for a few years now. its amazing how tonight of all nights I feel the urge to write again - I'm also amazed that my friends still write in their journals. I'm still not a writer, but I've regressed and become so much more of a .. I don't even know. Seems like these days i feel less human then I was in college. Seems like I spent the better portion of 2009 digging at the past... and something that would never become anything more then it was. I was holding on. The goal of 2010 is to move forward... and find myself again. To find what's real... and stop being a robot... I need to remember what its like to feel, and be real. 
too deep - so I'm sitting in laura's apartment - she pays $550 a month for what has become the best deal i've seen. She has no bugs, its clean, and her heater hasn't exploded - its amazing how my standards have gone down. I love my house - even with the problems i've had... but i'm ready to move on. Everything reminds me of a time in my life that is over. I'm ready for a clean start, something new and exciting. Someone new. Maybe that's why i'm inspired to write tonight. Let the snow wash me clean of my past, and give me the strength to move on to a new future. 
The snow, which is really giving us another 18 inches on top of the 20 or so we got the other day has given me a lighter work load and quality time with my girls. Its falling steadily even at 1am, and the sky looks like daylight as the flakes and coat sticking to the ground reflect the ambient night light back into the sky. its beautiful. I feel whole again. i've forgiven him... not directly, but in my heart. of sorts... i say that with the twinge that i'm not quite there yet - but i hope i will be soon. This time, there is no going back. for the first time in my life, there will be no more chances for anyone who has has a chance, again. Thank you lord, for the group of friends I've found here at PCOM. they've befriended me despite the pain and anger and insecurities i've been fighting with since August. Granted, they're not the usual crowd i dwell with, but i think its time for me to step up my game, for myself. I am not the tiniest, the prettiest, the most sought after, or the smartest in our group. I don't get the most guys, i'm not the most guy crazy, and i'm neither the most immature or the most mature. Thus,allowing every insecurity i've ever had to surface. Since i'm taking time to get over all my past relationships, i may as well get over all my internal conflicts. i can't wait to see who i am when i'm done. i really started out from beyond broken this summer... and i already feel so much stronger, independent and whole. I've learned to cherish my career and my friendships and i'm working on myself, and making connections, and nurturing those connections. Especially the connections of close friends, new friends, and family. I could not have done any of this without my family. I've become so much closer to my brother and my dad then I have ever been over the past months. I love it! Of course i've started listening to jewel again... when do i ever go through a mental growing phase that jewel hasn't been present for? Spirit, every day. I run 2 miles every other day now, and I study like its my job. I'm still depressed on a daily basis, and my demons torture me daily, even in my dreams... but i'll win in the end. 
So, snow... wash me clean, and let me make myself whole... let 2010 bring good change to my life. <3"

"event","therea re two types of transitions... first, and the better type is the kind you are so ready for. you've not enjoyed the situation you've been in, but you made the best of it, you pushed through and now you are beyond ready for change. you accept change with passion and you enjy the new chapters that life brings you to, you actualy rarely compare the past to the present, and you are just enjoying the new change or the transition changes to the new change. 
then there's the type that compares ot the endof college. you came from transition number 1 into a great time. i loved my room, i loved my positions (president, senior, high and mighty in all ways... well of sorts, some of that may be a product of senioritis) having been there, done that whenever someone needs advice... ready to party and you have al of your friends by your side becasue you are on top... the year gues by and you have a great time, so many memories...  some good and amazing, some not so good but you get over that because this you know is the time of your life. then ti ends... you knew it was comming.. but it ended and now what do you do? nothing you do from now on can compare to the best time of your life.... where do you go from here? i have to wonder, what in life can top the best time of your life, and what do you do after its over? 

that's quite the question - another one is ""who am i, and what do i want to do with my life?"" how can i make an impact on the world? 
any help would be great... for now its tequila night on emeril live."

"event","one year ago...
may: finished junior year: (nickelback: savin me)
-wrote costa rica paper from thursday to monday morning around graduation. had my first room party with meg, liz, and some of liz's friends - my room was pretty empty but we finished a lot of booze. then we went to the fountains. nicky slept in my room. brett wanted to be friends, some benefits were involved. i started taking physics - brownlowe is an easy teacher, but he's strange.

june: summer
- continued taking physics one and switched to two. the town flooded the day of my final. amie and i took day visits to the beach on saturdays. 

July: summer
- spent the 4th at aunt pat's, started physcis 2. had a cornea transplant on my left eye. malcolm came to visit and i realized that there is such a thing as liking someone only as a friend, and never any more then that. i remember typing physics reports on my dell laptop - sitting on my porch, video taping a bird, etc etc

August: back to school (jojo - too little too late)
didn't finish physics, but tried, i had exam 3, the final and a few papers to do. i moved back early for RA training. we went away to a high ropes course. i met a lot of people, made some new friends. stayed up til 5am talking to Brandon peer, sarah B, Sabir, and a few others, it was a fun night. i climbed a 30ft tall pole with stakes sticking otu of it, to slide down a zip line. 

September: freedom
- went out with ange and trish to maddies, then finished RA training and began the first week of school - ran into jesse for the first time in over a year... and we had that look up and down thing that happens in wismer. tom, steve, me, meg, martha, jay, aj, etc went out for his b-day to rock bottom - then to the movies (tom steven and me) to see beerfest until after 12 when we went to the trappe. meg and i had our bathroom scene ""i think him"" ""really? i don't think so"" haha a few hours later.. - next, i stole a mug, then steve drove me back to my house so i could put comfy clothes on, went to drink in jesse's room, played cards - ahmad was there, they took pics and i promply passed out in jesse's bed. after i went to the bathroom... walked out and walked up to him and well... you know... i was a bit forward... but so was he. 
- i thought nothing of that night.. i left early the next day... 2 nights later erin dragged me and liz out to sabir's ... we ended up spooning. and i out drank the soccer team... chugged jack daniels. 
-EV was going well, meg and i were getting close. first kdk party a week later: derek introduced me to his friend, i talked to jesse and teigler hung around me for a while. brett came and i ended up going home with him. nothing happened, just a ""wow its been a while"" talk. 
I asked jesse to help me with my physics exams... so he pretty much did them for me - we hung out at meg's one night - then he went out and i missed the ride so i hung out with my sisters. 
- CDel's 21st - EV party in Maples - i social hosted along with amy kiyota and jess rhodes. Jesse came over and helped finish my physics - Del called me to ask if i could get liquor and jesse took me to the store, helped me pick it out, carried it, and the mixers and ice - took it all to maples and helped set up - took me to my house, talked to his dad (2nd time while i was there) while i got ready, and took me back. he went home to study... but not for long, he called me and came back - we danced, and then some kid passed out so i had to take care of him. he was gargling so i flipped him and he threw up all over me - the RAs took care of him - i snapped into doctor mode. it was amazing.. until i got a charge of disorderly conduct, and my social hosting privleges taken away. 
- the fringe fest: we performed the season's at UC - i wore catherine's pink dress, and the pics were taken of me and roger dancing. jesse and brett came to watch... and a lot of my other friends, i had stopped talking to derek's friend, and teigler and i were friends.

more soon..."

"event","the big news is that i'm single... i have been for the past two weeks. we broke up at the sigma dated... i got upset over something stupid and we fought, and he cracked, flipped out on me and ended it there. i spent the remainder of the night crying my eyes out as my friends dragged me to every party on campus after we got back. I really havnt stoped crying since. 

I was immediately traumatized, its as if a flood of emotions had been dammed up for a long time, and suddently the dam was taken away. i realized everything i did wrong that night and all i wanted was to make things right. I tried his method, i wrote him notes that first week and tried to get him to talk to me - it worked well, we established the bad things... and even joked around a bit. I miss that, his joking around... i miss everything about him - when he's with me that is... i dont miss waiting all night for him to not call and leave me alone. Last saturday my whole ideal of the breakup had been turned upside down when i went to a party and found him and another girl together... that was the most painful thing i've ever seen in my life. and my presence had no affect on him. you all know what happened next. memories of all the fun times we've had together keep running through my mind - i just wish for it to be freshman year again, it was so much fun and i loved him so much... and he loved me. Dance was so hard... i'd sit there and think about him, watch the screen while he was on stage... and just dream and be sappy and all that... i've never been like this before...

When james and i broke up all 3 times... the first time i ran around screaming ""i'm free i'm free!!"" the second and third i didnt really care... now? i'm a ball of emotions, i dont eat, i dont sleep, i dont get anything done... i just sit and think about him all day - and i just realized how pathetic i am. This is horrible.... why can't we party every weekend like we did last year so i can keep my mind off of this? Why don't any of the boys on this campus like me? why is this girl so much better then me? Yeah... she is though... because i messed up, over and over and i hurt him with my mean ways and he never told me how he felt, never stoped smoking long enough to understand what was going on... fell out of love, and left me. and a week later here she comes... my favorite part is who he compared her to, and i know his opinions of that person... so i guess i should feel releived? im not sure. he used to tell me that i couldn't get over the past... but this one conversation we had... sounds like he's recreating it... it hurts so much to be in the heart broken position. I know how he feels now, it was no surpize that he told me he just wants to be alone... i did too - but neither would let me - and i dont know about this girl and what she's got planned. 

its so hard to accept that after two years of being with someone they can just stop wanting to try, stop wanting to put the time into making it work -and i mean i know i should be glad that i found this out now instead of later but somehow... i dont think this is who he really is...? i mean when we came to school we both drank a lot and had a lot of fun... and yea he has a sketchy side to him... but i dont know... he's so much better then all of that. he used to be so decent. he used to be so caring, and loving... and now he's so cold... i feel like its my fault, i destroyed him. this hurts so bad...

i'd give anything for him to look at me the way he used to... to say goodnight to me one more time... lay with me... curl up the way we used to... call me honey the way he always did when he was happy to see me... flip me upside down on our way to dinner... watch him sleep, sing ""you're just too good to be true"" to me one more time... let me lay on his stomach to make my headache go away, all the other inapropriate things i can't list that i miss, there's so many things i miss... i just miss him in general... even when things sucked between us, i still miss him. i wish there was something i could do... but he's not in love with me anymore... and he's moving on... leaving me here with my tears, all alone. and it hurts so bad... i keep telling myself i can cry it all out, but the tears never stop. ... he can't see me cry. hell i've seen him cry... i miss that, i miss when he wanted nothing more then to spend an hour talking to me, when we were in the ER and he told me he wanted to marry me, and when i got back together with him that's what i had contemplated out - i had a ring, i was set. too bad i took it off for the show... now i can't wear it again. :(

i went out tonight on an attempt to meet new people and hope to move on... it was ok i guess, bibi dragged me to 302... and i ran into him and it sucked - he was so cold to me, like i didnt even matter. i wonder if i did that to him... i was a horrible person when we were broken up... but i still didnt do half the things he's done in the past 2 weeks. anyways i checked out the guys - bibi says there were 3 after me - one couldn't dance, the second had my zipper pulled down and was working on the button by the time i realized it... thanks ariel for saving me :) and the third got pissed at me b/c i wouldnt hook up (i found him 5 mins later in the corner with another girl). so, clearly i have seen the selection at UC i dont like them, and i hate being single. i feel like a piece of meat, and all these boys want to take a bite.. and nothing more, and brett is turning into one of them with the way he handles girls, drugs, alcohol... emotions, parties... but he's so much better then that!!! UGH!!! why was i so stupid? why did i let him slip away, and spent all my time worrying about all the small stupid shit that doesnt even matter anymore... why??? i want to smack myself, go back in time and fix it. but i cant... and i'm stuck... hopelessly devoted to someone who is completely over me... and it hurts!!

crying myself to sleep, again... hurts"

"event","so, since i ran into him for 5 seconds at the party he's come around... kinda odd? it makes sense to me - he's sort of living what i went through last january, but ten fold in speed and intensity. though i have my doubts... i'm not sure exactly what's going on with this boy but i can tell you after the shit he put me through the past two weeks there will be no kiss and makeup, not that easily, i'm not that stupid. no, i have not gotten the chance to fully enjoy being single, and dammit i will before i decide to get back into a relationship. and if i do decide to go back to him someday, that's it, no more ""i dont know so let me fuck around for a while whil i figure out"" no more dissapearing, no more games, of any kind. 
this boy drives me nuts, i dont understand why he had to do that in front of me... and now wants to talk about things. its like he thinks i'm stupid, and i'll come back whenever he wants me to - yeah i do care about him, love him etc but no, you cannot walk all over me and then expect me to go ""ok we can work things out right now"" no... after the way he made me feel the past two weeks NO i refuse to give in so easily! or at all for that matter, we'll see. i still feel as though i should give the rest of the male population a chance to show me they're decent - though i know there is no one like brett. I can't go back right after all that pain, think of how horrible i was and i just want to say ""ok take me back wee!!"" NO!! that fucker hooked up with a girl in front of me, i dont care how honest he was about it, he did it and that's not fair to me at all. now he wants to talk things out and change and shit, what the fuck? ugh still undecided, that was the point... i'm going to bed, making it through the next 2 days and going home away from all of this drama."

"event","The graduation party turned out to be a success - Nick made 2,310$ off of it. The night before i took him and Pat to Steph's house for a BBQ. The whole crew was there, minus Sean and Christine. &nbsp;We talked about all the good ol' days' memories and ended up burning a hole in the groud.... thats when we found out sprite is flammable - with an attempt to put out the fire by dousing it w/sprite, it shot up into more flames! anyways, so sunday i worked all day, and yesterday was the most boring day in history. Today the family left for JHU for my sister's tri-surgery. She sat on the phone w/me and told me everything that was giong on as if i'd never done it before, it was so cute. :) i heart her.&nbsp;Last night we had a chat and i told her what to expect and how to handle everything... i actually felt like a big sister. Since the family is&nbsp;away, that's the signal for my annual summer gathering and everyone is invited... unless you've punched a wall in my house and left a big bloody mark in my dining room... (Surely not mEntioning Any Names here...) well, time to party-proof the house, do dishes and laundry and then start calling people.... hopefully this wont be as dramatic as last year :)"

"event","If the past week didn't take place i'd say my summer has been rather boring. Watching TV got old, I've run out of things to do online, i finished 2 books, and well, you get the point. Last Thursday Brett came to visit. I didn't tell anyone he was comming because i was 99.9% sure he wouldn't show for one reason or another. I guess holding on to that 0.1% of hope is good sometimes :) So we went out to dinner, and went for a walk. Friday he met my kids (I babysit Brady & Rachel) and their parents, and we all played frisbee for a while, then we went to the movies (Star Wars) and Saturday i dragged him around the mall for 5 hours - only b/c i needed a new bathing suite and i'm really picky. I also ended up w/2 pairs of jeans (a rare find! i'm back in a size 00) Sunday i worked and Brett came to visit me. Then we just kinda hung out at home, watched a movie, Monday was pretty much the same, we had a picnic up in Spring Ford by the river - played more frisbee, bbq'd and  made s'mores. Teusday he went home. he left me with a promise to visit in 3 weeks and a message from his mom telling me to visit them soon. 

Wednesday Kelsey and i drove down the Wildwood for the week. We were so excited on the way down - it was a gorgeous day - little did we know that the clouds would come rolling in the second we reached the shore. It stayed cloudy and cold the whole week. Kristen and Lauren, came down later in the day and after a quick trip to the liquar store the drinking began - lotsa card games and Kristen's drunk dialing. We managed to watch quite a few movies - i finally saw the rest of Fight Club along w/Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs, Law&order, ""Pregnancy for dummies"", The Truth about Cats & Dogs, and...a few others. Thursday the weather was awful and since Kelsey's dad is has connections with this local convent we volunteered to help the nuns set up for a dinner type event. We had to move the chairs.... but they weren't clean, so we cleaned the chairs and then moved them, and some tables. Then the lady working with us thought it would be polite to give us a 2 hour tour of the convent which ended in cookies and soda and carrying electrical supplies to the third floor. (Yippie) it wasn't as bad as it sounds. I found it ironic... most girls come to the beach to pick up a guy, we visited the convent! Caroline and Tamar joined us later in the week. Despite the bad weather, it was a pretty fun trip! 

Lauren and i drove home today and managed to avoid really bad traffic - Tonight i'm taking the time to relax and catch up. Tomorrow i'm taking part in some shady buisness.... not really shady, but someone special can't know what's up until tomorrow @ 2 :) Tootles!

Beach Quotes:

(watching Hannibal) Kristen: I don't know... if I were to date him, he'd have to stop eating people...

(Fear Factor) Guy w/pink shorts: It's all fun and games til' you look like a douche bag on TV!

inner thoughts at the convent :there is no R in ""WASH""

there's 2 more... but i have to find them..."

"event","<P>It eels like orever since i've updated... a lot has happened ut nothing too dramatic - i've been worn thin the past 2 weeks. the new performing arts center opened last thursday - we rehearsed many times the days before and i got no work done that week. we put on a concert at noon with lindy hop, chris' piece and performance project - and another in the evening with the ballet class and partnering class. kdk's last party of the year was friday night, and i managed to sleep through it. i rushedhome after my chem exam w/ange to see my bro off to prom (he was so handsome and his date is a sweetie). after hanging out for a while ange drove me back to campus and i visited the party in my sweats... went back to change and woke up at 3:30am. apparently brett came to check on me at one point but i dont remember it that well. i needed the sleep though, from the lack of sleep the week before and the weekend before... or was that two weeks ago? not sure anymore, the party before that - airband night! april 8th</P>
<P>airband was so much fun! we danced toa michael jackson medly - won best costume, best theme, best choreography and 3rd place over all. then i social hosted our party and that was pretty interesting - a couple of fights and whatnot. then all i wanted to do was go to sleep but nate and his girl at the time were in bretts room and amie was preoccupied in my room - so we sat in my common room for a while-&nbsp;the boy left and we went to bed in my room. apparently he came back and they decided to initiate some stuff that should not have taken place while there were other people trying to sleep in the room - so after debating on what to do we finally made the scene, got up and left. thank god nate and bibby had fallen&nbsp;asleep already or we would have had no where to sleep that night... for the&nbsp;4 hours of sleep we got.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>anyways so we went to the collective soul concert the next night and that was ok, not great but not bad. the next weekend was larry's bday party + his girlfriend was in town - brett andi got into a huge fight but no one heard over the loud music. we're hanging in there though... we celebrated our one month, or 16 month whichever anni on the 18th. we decided to have&nbsp;2 anni's, october 6th (his) and march 18th (mine) which each of us will prepare the evening and such for the other, respectively :) </P>
<P>so the work load is winding down, all my mid semester exams are over but i have a few papers due next week and finals - 4 finals to be exact. the UCDC concert is this week (be there!!) it's great - i'm in two pieces - the first is a lindy hop piece, we're all in random clothing i have an orange dress and there's a lot of us on stage, i dance with Lix (Dave's girl) and Brett - pretty fun! the other piece is amazing - performance project, generated in a class we put together the piece revolving around light - we are all wearing white (dresses/pants) i walk down the stage with my eyes closed to represent birth/innocense/individualism and then victor taps me on the back to spin me arund and then i run at him, to do a gorgeous lift. there's a men's piece, woman's movement chior and two sets of duets - one with 2 women, one with women/men which is mostly choreography from our partnering class. the end, i walk again and everyone runs in criss cross paterns to meet me at the bottom of the stage and a black out. i've seen a few audience members cry over this piece - i'm excited, oh there's also several other lifts (brett gets picked up) and lotsa circle running. nate sings, shane and monica read a poem - we transition from those to music, its a long piece (going on 6 min.) so come see the show!! :) (4/27-4/30 @ 7:30pm in Ritter) </P>
<P>other news... i did my CS house project last weekend, noneof my sister's came but that was expected. i brought 17 people with me, 7 of them were with tau sig and a lot of them were serious runners - it went really well! i'm gonna do it again next year. </P>
<P>so that's all my news, i know ur so glad to hear from me :) i missed the last 2 weeks of gilmore girls, but&nbsp;hopefully trish and i can catch up on that next week! now i'm off to shower and eat before call, and the show :) ciao!</P>"

"event","hiya... its gorgeious out today!!! i wanted to spend the whole day outside but i had class from 10-6:30, dinner and then it got dark around 8 - which is awesome!! 
so last week was a hard week - i had a bio exam wednesday (91%) dance showing wednesday night (went really well), chem exam friday, and friday was april fools day - the anniversary of Steve Ayeres' death = bad day for the class of 2003. Friday night we ended up hanging out with Meghan and Scott (yep my stage manager) so of course ACTF drama got brought up and Brett voiced his opinion of it all very loudly and we fought the whole way home until i sat there and firmly stated over and over that he has nothing to worry about, so now he knows, he's learning more and more every day. I've begun wearing the ring on my left finger - partially because my mom insists that's where its supposed to go and partially because the weather change has made my joints swell up. (i'm right-handed) so that works for him.
i slept all day saturday, litterally - i woke up, went to lunch, slept, ate food, showered and went to see Sin City - good movie! a little confusing but i think i can clear that up by watching it again. They turned my Rory (Alexis Bledel) into a hooker! she did good though, a betraying hooker at that! she did wear the most clothes out of all of them though, which saved her innocent reputation a lil bit lol.
Sunday i worked... Mark Exley is keeping our pay checks until we talk to him about what trainings we owe... so i left a really mean voice mail for him and when andrew called me back (because mark is a little b... and can't reap what he sews, so he has andrew do the dirty work) so andrew appologized and told me i wasnt missing anything (doh) and said he'd mail my check out. drama over nothing, seriously! i'm glad its solved though, i'm just gonna bring ear plugs to the staff meeting this Sunday. 
Room lottery was the other night - so i'll be living in 305 next year which is a single - not the single i wanted but i can deal i guess... it has slanted cealings, very slanted! and only one window which sucks because i love windows. I'm kinda scared of living alone, i'm so used to having someone else in the room with me when i go to sleep - i hate sleeping in a room alone. i hate the bathroom up there too, no windows. I'll deal though i guess. i'll prolly end up moving into reimert, or have brett move in w/me if he gets sick of nate and bibby... bippy... how do u spell that?? Bogdona is her real name, she's nates new girlfriend. Dave also has a love interest named Liz who is my Lindy Hop partner. She's a sweety, she went to the movies w/us saturday. OH and after the movies we broke into the PAC to see the new theaters - ITS HUGE!!! like the one i performed on at ACTF, amazing! but no where near done! the blackbox, thats slightly larger then ours is almost done so we'll have that. but all in all i was amazed! I can't wait to perform there in the fall!
So that's all, my mom's Aunt Ronnie (Veronica) died today - she's been battling cancer since i was little and it was sad to see her go even though my side of the family didnt get along with her (not going into details, big family argument over the past 6 months) 

so that's about all that's new with me, i'll post a more emotional entry sometime later this week - since the week is so light i havnt been motivated to do any work lol so i'm sure i'll get to it, <3 keep commenting! shows me u love me!"

"event","Soooo today... i was approved to do research in the fall w/Dr. Bailey!!! not as exciting for everyone, but its a big thing cos she's the first prof. i really asked :) so i'm going to be working with cardiac function and dysfunction and rabbitts, sad i know but it'll be good experience for my dream job. 
Last week i got rediculously sick, fallowed by saturday night when i got rediculously drunk. Thursday i was in bed all night with a fever,tummy ache, pale skin, high eye & sinus & head pressure, migrane symptoms yadda yadda joint pain, dizziness, everything under the sun except excretion. (yuck) so i went to the dr. friday and the lab work today shows that i have strep throat - amoxicilin will kill it off! (i'm being such a dork right now) anyways but saturday was fun - i didnt expect it to be but it was! i wore my new green & yellow top w/jeans - chugged a screw driver, had another & a rum n coke and that was enough for my small self. i had fun, then later i got tired, and a lil dizzy so brett hid with me in the staircase (amungst some of my friends) and then he coaxed me into going home at 1:30 which made me mad but i was pretty gone. Brett took pretty good care of me :)
Sunday i worked, came back to school and threw together an oral presentation for lit which i KILLED and got an A+ on!!!! (major news of the week, not as great as research though)
i had half an exam weds, and the other half tomorrow, so i've been pretty stressed - next week is a science test week so i'm gonna be pretty stressed until next friday lol. i figure i'll relax a bit tomorrow and then do a lot of studying saturday. maybe go out to dinner w/brett... that would be nice, chinese food! and a movie! good will hunting!! i've wanted to see that forever, anyways hehe. well i'd better eat and get working on something and then get to lindy hop practice. 

Some fun tidbits:
- about 1.5 months ago brett broke his rib... went to PHX hospital... nate, katie and i went to see him after stopping at wellness - as a gift we blew up condoms and turned them into balloons :) left the wrappers in Nate's car. so his father (Dr. Dawley head of bio dept.) returned them to Katie, in the middle of her CIE class!!

Things i learn in dance class:
Sarah and Victor like to grab my boobs
Katie enjoys pulling off my pants, exposing my blue thong to the class
Jason wants my butt. 
*body joke*

so if ur not in my class, these are all accidents, except jason saying ""i want your butt"" when they had to pick me up. body joke is slang for an inside joke in class. just some funny stuff to record in my memory forever :)"

"event","<P>Being home is so boring compared to the life i lead last week lol. I've gotten my hair nails and eyebrows done, teeth cleaned, back alligned, eye zapped, and scholarship taken care of as well as sending out my intro letter to my professors. i'm all set :) </P>
<P>Wednesday i went to Hopkins and had a lasic procedure done, making 39. Mr dr. disected a hole in the massive scar tissue that had been building up in the back of my eye and now i can see! its amazing, i feel like i have a wide screen tv attached to my head. i forget to use the eye often, force of habbit... look i can read this with it!! its amazing!! and my pressure has gone back to normal... oh i'm so happy :) my Dr. also told me to start putting in effort to med school stuff - i told him of my bad grades and whatnot and he confirmed that with a good letter of recomendation and mcat scores, as long as i explain the situation any med school would not judge me based on it as long as i do well from now on. i'm happy, i need to work hard now, get my ass in gear! ha anyways. </P>
<P>last night was fun, went to Ange's to play monopoly with her, hinkle and trish and shawn. it was fun. Hinkle drove me home. i dont think i've seen him that happy before - well he seemed happy, i got a good vibe from him. anyways i'm gonna find something to do until tonight. My family is taking me out to dinner at Olive Garden for my birthday next week!! YaY!!! ta ta for now!</P>
<P>Did i mention that i love this song??? i love it!! i love Green Day!!!</P>"

<P>News of the year: there will be an LIL baby arriving in July! Though kinda scary, its very exciting at the same time. I'm still amazed that time is moving so fast and that things are changing so quickly. it makes me want to turn back time and re-live highschool. Time is the one thing i wish i could understand... how does it work? why do we evolve around it? can it be altered? seems feasable, everything else can be altered. I think my life is divided into chapters based on the year, or my birthday? not sure which one because they're so close together. 2003 was probably the best year so far - there were so many good changes that occured that year, so many memories to look back on that year. I was trying to remember what i did each new year's eve in the past. i cant remember what i did junior year. i know what i did dec. 31st (the morning) and what i did new year's day but i dont know what i was doing as the ball dropped - i'm sure i was with james because the 2 memories surrounding that time invovled him. eh whatever i must have blocked it out for a reason. so here's the list. As the ball dropped on... i was:</P>
<P>2005: in Ange's car, pulling up to see Mike 2004: at Brett's house, kissed :) a group of his friends were there too, and he spilled champagne all over the carpet. 2003: at James' dad's house, on the couch... he fell asleep about 10 mins before, no kiss. 2002 ??? 2001: at Trish's house with her and Ange, we spent the night, i was making a salad and trish was yelling at me to get in the living room. 2000:?? 1999: With my dance Co. @ jessica's house. That's as far back as i can remember. i'm sure i wrote down the 2 i forgot... i'll look it up later. </P>
<P>So lets see, what else is new... i got to see Meet the Fockers and A Series of Unfortunate Events with Ange. both were good,&nbsp;she also had me watch Butterfly Effect which inspired the rant above. &nbsp;I've done a bit more shopping then usual, one trip with my aunt and grandmother which was fun but interesting, and the rest with mom. New Year's day was spent at my aunt's house... sleeping because i was sick... and am... attack of the sinus infection part 2 began on dec. 30th. all in all, 2005 has been a rather relaxing year so far. I'm going to try to be happier this year... and not let things get to me - but try to get a good student still, just a light hearted student... maybe things will be easier for me that way. Something&nbsp;will change with my love life... the shift is right around the corner... i'm not sure how its going to take place though, or what it will bring after it occurs... </P>
<P>On a brighter note... i l eave tomorrow for school - and then tuesday its off to the theater competition! the week will be fun, but Saturday brings 2 performances. Ii hold a very minor role but still just as important as the big ones! Wish me luck! if you want to see the show, give me a call after teusday for directions and tix info. :) </P>"

"event","Today's one of those days that make me want to sleep until the next chapter of my life begins. I'm still debating about what to do New Year's eve, I'm actually a little bitter about the options i've ruled out. Like my dad says, ""expect nothing good from people and you will never be let down."" I forget this too many times, and i count on people too much. I've always strived for independance, i think i'm going to return to that goal. This way, no matter what i do (i'm refering to biology now), when its over i can say i did it by myself, with my own two hands, all my hard work made it happen - whatever ""it"" may be. It may not be the best, or as good as everyone else but whatever.. i did it by myself and that's good enough for me. I'm tired of being compared to everyone else, i'm tired of being told how to act, how to look, and exactly how to go about my goals. ""i will go in this way and find my own way out"" - trish uses that quote... or something like it. I'm tired of thinking about making changes in my life and immediately getting scared. Maybe i'll do something drastic... i'm not sure. I need to change things up a bit...."

"event","<P>So, i bet you thought i dropped off the face of the earth, well you're wrong :) I've been amazingly stressed out, either physically or mentaly. which is kind of weird, how when i pretend i'm not stressed i start to grind my teeth. Oh well.&nbsp;So i got a C on my chem exam and a higher C on my bio exam, dammit, that's ok! now i have an 80 in both classes, and time to make or break that grade, hopefully bring it up a bit. I got a good mid-term review from Cathy and she asked me to partner up with Brett for a piece in the spring :) very exciting, i get to dance with my man! I started this jazz peice, mind you i haven't danced jazz since i was like 13, long time. So i felt completely out of my element and looked retarded, i'm too skinny for it, i need baggy clothes! anywho, she said i looked fine but she always says that lol</P>
<P>OH right, so 2 weeks ago we put on the play, Poe on Poe - if you didnt see it you missed an amazing play. The set, lights, acting, dancing was all incredible. So i got to dance in the bells piece and it was so much fun! it made me realize how much i love performing, wether its on a football field, or a stage, i love performing! even if i'm not the main attraction. I'm so torn, biology, or performance, not like i could actually make a career out of performing, but it is always fun to do and i wonder how i could stay involved in it after college. That's another debate.</P>
<P>Brett and i have had our share of ups and downs during the past 2 weeks, things seem to be smoothing out now and assurance from him over the break will make me feel better about the upcomming breaks and such. *must learn to trust* if i can, i dont want a repeat of this summer. </P>
<P>My eyes have been acting funny, pressure has been increased a lil bit lately, but not too badly, i have had a few headaches. I go to the hospital tuesday for a check up and a visual feild test to see how much damage i've had since before the massive surgeries the past few years. who knows, maybe i'll line up a date for 39..? lol NO! </P>
<P>So i went to the senior night football game tonight, they honored my girls :) i miss them, and HS cheerleading. so much girl-time, so much...sharon lol i dont miss sharon at all. in fact, she talked to me, and i realized that she doesnt try to make me feel inferior, she just doesnt give a shit about me, or probably anyone on the squad. In fact, i dont know why she does it, and if i have time when she quits/retires, i'll take the job :) anywho, those who were my littles when i was a senior, are now captain, and they gave me a football :) </P>
<P>so now i'm at home, alone, everyone's in bed and its only 11, i am tired though, and i miss school, although tomorrow i'll realize how good it is to get away. it felt weird after bio lab to come back and have nobody in the whole house there. Oh well, i'm going to read my LOTR book, for the FIRST TIME SINCE SUMMER!! yeesh! and then fall asleep to discovery health channel (which i dont get at school) aaaand that will be my night. tomorrow i shall begin to read chemistry, or genetics, or brit lit or whateve ri feel like reading i just know i have a lot of studying to do. oh, but i am going shopping with mom tomorrow (free clothes) :-D ok g'nite!</P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#cccccc>what a wave has hit me... today is my last day to semi-rest. the next week is going to be packed with things to do and places to go. firt of all, the updates from the past - that bio test i flipped out about, i got a B on lol i guess i justs overreacted. Then the chem test was another story, but i'm already studying to make up for that one. so last weekend wasn't very evnetfull, we started matng flies in lab so i had to go to the lab every 7 hours to check on them and it was awful, my lab partner isnt much help with it and the flies would run away, the tubes grew mold, it was NOT an easy experiment. It's not done, but the week day has kept me on a better schedule with it. I have flies with </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>Red eyes </FONT>and <FONT color=#00cccc>wings <FONT color=#cccccc>and they are going to be mated with flies that have </FONT><FONT color=#999999>White eyes </FONT>and no wings. </FONT><FONT color=#cccccc>it should be interesting to see what i find tomorrow in lab. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00cccc>So, yesterday was me and Brett's one year anniversary!!! it was great - we exchanged gifts at midnight - i got hom a wallet with a pic of me in it (not a good one though) and lil coupons good for a hug and kiss and cute stuff like that. he got me Alladdin on DVD and Big Fish which was a good movie. So thoughout the movie&nbsp;i had a really good feeling about our relationship... not sure exactly what it was but i was thinking about wether i trust him yet or not and i decided that i dont yet - glad i decided that because a few minutes later i realized his phone works again, so i looked and apparently several femailes have made it to the list who i dont know. whatever. he didnt know who half o them were - whatever. why do i always beleive him? or do i? UGH i hate boys. I honestly dont have time to think about it, maybe thats why i handle our relationship better durring the school year then when i'm at home, i have more time to think about what all this means when i'm home. his line is always ""oh stop it, i wouldnt do that, i love you too much"" which is cute, and seems honest. oh i need to just stop thinking about it - we do have issues with the non-campus time though, because i hate it, i hate not talking to him, i hate him being distant and forgetting me, i hate not being with him, period. I was thinking about going to NYC for fall break... Austin said he'd cover for me at work... so i could take the day off - my bro might kick me for not being home on his birthday. who knows... i hate how when i do visit him i dont get to see all his friends, go to his bars, do whateve rhe does, it sorta makes his life differant when i'm there and well, i dont feel like i'm a part of him. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00cccc>so anywas to the things that are keeping me from thinking too much and the things i should be doing insead of writting this. i have a chem test next wednesday but no time to study so i've started that already. the play is next week! <FONT color=#3366ff><STRONG>Poe on Poe - come see me dance in it from 10/13 to 10/16 at 7:30 in Ritter.</STRONG> </FONT>I get a bio in the program and everything. :) so anyways, that takes up a good 3 hours a day all next week. THEN when i'm done trat... i have&nbsp;a bio test monday! huray! anywho... i'm trying to plan something relaxing friday night - like going to a hayride or something <FONT color=#33ff33>so this is an open invatation because i dont have time to usse a phone, ange trish, sara whoever you are all welcome to come to the haunted hayrides with me and whoever else wants to go friday night! give me a call n let me know!</FONT> love you guys! hm i have an earge to go to a concert, anyone know the feastival line up this year??</FONT></P>"

"event","<P>Life has not been too eventfull lately. its been pretty routine. The work load has picked up a lot, i've officially taken two tests. One of which i'm pissed off about because of a stupid error i made that may cost me the good grade i wanted. Oh well, i'm not perfect. I figured out wha ti did wrong and the way to fix it as soon as i walked out. That made me even more mad. Why is life all about memorization tests? why do we need to memorize stuff? most people justs forget it the instant they walk out of the room. I would rather do something where i have to describe a sequence, or something practical not just spew out random information in a weird format. *interuption* had to open the door, Larry's listening to Dashboard :) I love dashboard, its just the type of music that's perfect to listen to when youre upset. </P>
<P>anyways, back to the weekend. well and before that. the first evpisode of the 5th season of Gilmore Girls came out last Teusday - didn't the community service guy call me right after it started so i missed about 20 minutes of the episode, so trish is brining her tape up on tuesday so i can re-watch it. Thursday was my first chem exam, and i didnt finish it in the time and a half i had, i only finished 20 of the 34 problems. This is not cool, she said 3 people failed it, i'm probably one of them. Friday we had a party, KdK meaning, and it was alright - there were mad freshman so there was no room to dance at all. ran out jello shots before we were supposed to even open and ran out of drinks later on. I got one drink, and none of the jello shots i made. I invited trish and hinkle up for the party, but because it was so crowded we didnt stay long. We tried to visit my house-mates but they were all passed out so we went for a walk/drive to visit one of the houses Hinkle built back in the day. it was a very nice house, from the outside. so then we drove to McDonalds to find Brett and Nate walking on the side of the road. Nate wasn't having a good night, so the boys left me for a while. Anyways, got food and picked them up, went back to my house and bullshitted for a while - then trish and hink went back to the ville and Brett and i and nate crashed in the boys room. </P>
<P>Saturday was fun! We finally went swimming and it was fun. Then we sat around, and i studied some and brett played his game. Then nate left for a wedding so i got all ambitious and asked brett to rearrange the room! now if you know me, you know that i've had issues involving killing myself on all the crap on their floor, including hte cable wire that was blocking the entrance. sooo we pushed the tv n dresser by the window, and put Brett's desk in the closet so now they have lots more space and hte cable doesnt have to go across the doorway!! yay !! Later, Brett started feeling sick and the b oys found a movie to watch so we watched that until cartoons, watched them and went to bed. huray for excitment. </P>
<P>sunday, woke up early and went to work. studied at work, came home, pop-pop's in the hospital... Now this isnt cool, my mom's side of the family has been slowsly dying off lately and it'd starting to upset me. we have no babies but lots of people dying! This is my pop pop though, he's always been there to pick on me for the way i sing, saying that i scare away the birds, and whatnot. I stayed with them for a wek back in 7th grade while my parents went on vacation. It was boring but i dalt with it, i'll always remember it though. Pop Pop &amp; barbra made me a poster with my week on it, a picture of me every day lol so they said, i had the same outfit on in the last 4 pictures so i figure they took them all on the same day. Anyways, so he had a heart attack and is in the hospital. Apparently he's undergoing tests right now but should be fine as long as he quits smoking, taking certain medication and relaxes. We went to visit him, but he was sleeping. Then i went back to school and studied with the boys until late.</P>
<P>Today was the test, and now i'm just not in a good mood so i needed to vent, listen to dashboard and sleep. Goodnight! </P>"

"event","<P>The weekend after week 3... the campus flooded, including our bathroom. It was sooooo cold, i spent the whole time inside. </P>
<P>Friday night, Brett's family came down to visit him for the Jewish holiday. It was nice seeing them, although their visits are always hectic for me because i have to navigate and plan things. We went to the Cheesecake factory, but the wait was about an hour and a half so we walked all over the place until they decided on the Bamboo Club (next door, an asian restraunt) I got to try lots of interesting foods, learn how to use chopsticks the right way, and freeze under the air conditioner. All in all an OK meal. Afterwards we went to Urban Outfitters to look around, nothing was bought but Brett tried on a few hats and such, looked for a rug etc etc... So after almost dying in traffic a few times we made it back to school. (his mom isnt the best driver... she tries though, I give her props for driving such a long way) We hung out in Brett's room, they looked up directions and such for a few local hotels and then they were off! An hour later we got a phone call saying that every hotel in the area was completely booked due to a gun show and family day at villanova and bryn mawr and some other places and such. So Austin was gonna crash on the couch, and i offered out a few places for his mom to stay but she didnt want to stay on campus so she ended up sleeping in the car - i still feel really bad about it because she could have stayed in my room, my common room, or even my house. Whatever, that suited her. While Brett was tucking her in Austin came over to talk to me, i think it was the first time we actually talked without him picking on me. He seemed like a nice person after talking to him - i guess his teasing is out of fun and not to be mean - but i guess i assumed he was mean because the only time i saw him during winter break was when he was picking on me. First impressions can be deceiving. Anyways, we woke up around 8 saturday morning to a phone call and Jesse &amp; Jay's alarm clock going off... the door was locked, and nobody was there!! arg! anyways. Brett's family left - maybe next time i'll make reservations for them. </P>
<P>Saturday we did nothing but homework because it was flooding outside and it was extremely cold. we went to Marzella's for dinner with the boys - the casheire called me a rose amidst 5 thorns :) anyways, the boys had everclear so we drank that night - like 1/4 a shot is good enough for me lol (yes we did shots... not good but oh well) my 1/4 was mixed with lemonade lol. Nate got very sick. Brett and i got in a fight. we stayed up til like 3 to solve it, agreed on something and then the next day we both forgot what we agreed on. I went to work sunday, Got even more sick (adding the sinuses to my fever) did some homework sunday, passed out early and skipped my morning classes monday. I feel a lil better now, but the sinus infection will be here for a while. I went through a whole box of tissues already :(</P>"

"event","<P>So i guess i didnt post about this past weekend... i may as well now :) Friday night Brett was tired and Amie went out with the gymnasts so i was here by myself, but not for long! i went to the movies with Trish and her Pat. It was fun, we saw Garden State - it was a cute n quirky movie. After hearing the insightful quotes about what home is i got home sick, but managed to hang on campus for another day. We went back to UC and i dragged them around to visit Brett &amp; Nate, then back to Hobson to visit Sarah &amp; Jess. I climbed on the roof for the first time! lol After that i went back to visit Brett and we passed out early. Saturday, once again we decided to go swimming while the pool was closed (big dissapointment) so we went to the Phi Kap- rush (frat, for the boys) They had a slip n slide over by the quad and i got to peg the guys with some water balloons, almost got tossed down the slide while fully clothed and such, it was fun :) Then Nate wanted to go to this irish/scottish fair up in Green Lane (very small town outside of Boyertown) so we went, i bought a toe ring and some fudge. Brett bought this pipe that looks like the ones used in the Lord of the Rings... which he used last night lol. Nate bought this tapestry (how do you spell that?) that is now hanging from there cealing to block the light. It was fun, i love the sound of bagpipes in the distance AND i got to eat a shepard's pie! so good!</P>
<P>After the fair we went to Nate's house to have dinner with the Dawley's. Their house is really nice. its set back in the woods, and looks old fashioned on the outside but the inside was beautiful. It was odly shaped, but that gives it character. We had chicken con pesto for dinner, it was very good and the thickest pesto i've seen, i like it that way. Salad, beans, rice etc... It was all good. (Robert cooks, not Ellen, lol) So the adults popped out this soda/whine cooler drink type thing (thats what i could make of it from what they said) and we had cake. </P>
<P>The discusssion was predictable, CIE, bio111, us kids, adult stuff. I got to hear some good costa rica stories - i'm still thinking about going. Then we got to talking about dance, b/c nate &amp; brett dance improv... so Robert (a lil tipsy) gets up and starts walking around, then stands still, lays down, and flauls his hands and leggs around for a while trying to imitate improvisational dancing... do Dr. Stern (philosophy/politics professor who was also there for dinner) stood over him and started to pretend to play drums... it was hilarious!! I'll never look at any of them the same again, i knew they were all human, they had to be lol I couldnt see them acting like they do in class all the time. It was fun, they have a duck that fallows everyone around - Ellen named him Dick the stalker duck... and there's the puppy (not really a puppy, 7 y/o) Chase. </P>
<P>I had a blast. So we went back to campus and the guys watched their TV shows and we hung out and went to bed... Sunday i went home, worked, hung out with my family and came back to campus - i spent quality time with my girls while watching the patriot and doing homework... then passed out rather late... Now we head into week 3 of classes, and the work load is pouring on as the tests and project due dates approach next week! ahhhhhh!</P>"

"event","<P>Once again interupting my homework to present a new thought... actually Dashboard took me back once again to last year. I'm realizing how differant i was from who i am now... and i dont like either person, I wish i could be a mix of both... example </P>
<P><STRONG>Type A:</STRONG> I was free, in the moment, emotional about everything. it seemed to me that i was more social, and i enjoyed meeting new people. I did care about homework but somehow i complained about it so much that it was never finished. however... looking back on some of my more private entries i wrote with ease, emotion, much more emotion then i can put in now. I not only listened to music, but i really heard it. however, i was always stressed out and i felt as though i were flying from place to place and not endulging in the moment, i miss the freshman feel that i had last year and never took pleasure in. I was too busy fleeing from the stressful vibes that my roomate gave off, or just managing to finish that paper half-ass before midnight. I never really partied, in fact i think i'm more comfortable at parties now then i was in type A. I flew everywhere... never had a moment to relax, but i was crazy, i always had something on my mind and not enough time to do it. </P>
<P><STRONG>Type B</STRONG> sophomore year, i know the ropes. Nothing is changing, stability - the thing for which i strived most last year. I longed for stability, in fact i thought i was a stable loving person. How boring i must have wished to be. I have time for everything now, i plan everything. Nothing is changing, I feel comfortable where i am even though i still miss the stillness of home and the woods and my crew from the ville. I was told to take things easy this year... so i have been - and i've been doing a pretty good job with it, but i miss being free.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont know exactly how to describe free because there is no physical cercumstance that makes me free or not free. I'm not entirely sure who i want to be... I need to be busy, but isnt that just a product of society? the need to be doing something at all times. I'm not sure... Who am I anyway? Am I shooting too far out of my league? or will i do something great one day by seeming crazy now? Do opposites really attract or is it a temporary arraingment that will soon falter and fade? For a while i stopped wanting to fly, i thought stepping up the ladder was the right way to go... fly or climb? Thi is so random... </P>
<P><EM>""well this is incredible, starving, unsatiable, yes this is love for the first time - we'd like to think that we were all invincible yeah well didnt we all once... before we felt lost for the first time""</EM> </P>
<P>wasnt i lost last year? lost can be fun, it teaches you who your real friends are... they're the ones who find you. what do i want? i dont want material things, i want to fly, i want to be around people who inspire me to want to fly... perhaps someday i will fly away... but i love home... i would come back after a time... am i an artist or do i fallow the scientific method... i'm so lost... perhaps i'm only pretending to be found... i'm sorry for the confusion and randomness.</P>"

"event","<P>So i give up on that stupid xanga site, it was supposed to be the all public site, but&nbsp;Trisha W. is the only person who reads it and she can just get my livejournal link :-P </P>
<P>Anywho, Classes have been in session for a week now. Starting my day at an early 8:40 am is Brittish Litterature - a fun class filled with classic readings and an artful teacher who sounds just like Robin Williams. He's a cool guy, very flighty though. I like his voice, he reads with perfect cadance. Anywho, then I head off to hell, also known as Chemistry. Chem and i never got along in tenth grade, maybe things will be differant this year. The text books didnt come in until Friday and at that, they cost $200 each. My bank account is officially empty. Anywho, my teacher has a very monotone voice for a girl, but she knows her stuff. After hell (Hot classroom) i take a walk around the corner to the ice palace (freezing class room) also known as Genetics. I really like genetics so far, and i like my professor - who i recently asked to become my advisor when i declare my major in a week or so. She makes science sound human, and she has fun with what she teaches which means a lot to me, last semester my lecture professor was dead as a doornail when he talked about cell bio. (nothing wrong with straight forward information but i'm one of those people who likes to hear things in differant ways.) Anywho, then i have a lunch break and depending on the day i head to bio lab (which is good so far) or Ballet. I had only intended on dancing twice a week however&nbsp;i jumped&nbsp;on the dance bandwagon and went to the UC dance company meeting &amp; signed up... so i danced thursday as well and&nbsp;i'm not sure when i'm going to be dancing now... we'll see. Chem lab sounds dull... but i cant judge it&nbsp;until tomorrow when we do something other then listen to lecture. And that's my week</P>
<P>We had a ""welcome back"" party on friday which went great!&nbsp;I made jell-o shots with the help of my wonderful boyfriend who has been nothing but wonderful since we reunited&nbsp;on campus.&nbsp;Today we&nbsp;reached eleven months together, which is nice, nothing special - i just keep tossing random hints that he should do something REALLY nice for our 1 year in October. Being a sophomore is much easier then beeing a freshman&nbsp;however life was more interesting when i was a freshman, oh well - i dont talk to a lot of the people i knew last year, they've turned from friends to aquaintances, which is fine it just shows who my real friends are (the 4 i chose to live with, and then some) I do enjoy living on&nbsp;Main st., away from the loudness of campus - however i do get to hear the party music now, but its cool because its from Shreiner and that's where we party :) Being&nbsp;in&nbsp;Brett's room on a party night is another thing... its loud! and his room is tiny and odd shaped and they are both too lazy to figure out&nbsp;hwo to make things easily accessed and when&nbsp;they&nbsp;did get motivated, Nate didnt help... and that annoyed me because i'm a small italian girl&nbsp;who beleives in cooperation and good work ethic.&nbsp;Anyways today is beautiful, though slightly breezy outside so i'm going to get ready for class and go to lunch :) ON LABOR DAY!! grrr... i wish we celebrated holidays on campus, oh well.</P>"

"event","Wow it feels like forever since i've written. So much has happened! I'm back at school now, and today is the third day of classes. Amie drove up Friday and picked up a speeding ticket on her way. So Sarah and Jess helped us move in - then i was supposed to get my keys Saturday but they failed to mention that campus safety closed at like 3pm so i showed up at like 6. So after getting insaintly frustrated i gave up and went home. I called Ange &amp; Trish and they along with Hinkle came to visit me. We sat around my house and talked for a while while HInkle had private text message conversations with all of us. Harassed my brother for a while and then we picked up Ange's little brother and went to Geno's for the last time this summer. It was a fun drive down. Split a cheesesteak with trish and then came home... we all remenised about highschool and hwo great it was... and then i went to bed at about 4am... more later time for lunch now!!"

"event","I'm just going to come out and say it this year... i'm scared of going back to school. I can't wait to see all my friends and get back in a routine, but i miss home too. I know, i live 10 minutes away from home but its so differant. I'm afraid of what my classes will bring... hard work, mean teachers, more medical disbeleif, i realized last year how small of a person i am and how little time people are willing to take with me. Most of all, going back to school means another chapter in my life is closed and that we're all growing up... too fast. I wish i could have frozen life last summer. I'll never forget, Steph, Sean and i were out camping - i woke up early as always and i thought that i could die right there and be happy with my life... except my love life which had been traumatic before college. But love wasn't important, friendship was and that i truly had for the first time, or so i thought. The one thing i wished for going into college is that i would have friends to help me along the way - i successfully have friends, and i'm happy. I never once felt lonely living on campus, the only problem was that i felt unsure of myself - who i am, who i want to be, the entire year. I've never had to explain my medical situation to people before without mom there to back me up, the deans office called her and told her that they didnt beleive me - that upset me more then anything. Why wouldnt they beleive me? cant you look itno my eyes and see the stitches, the whiter then white scars from the past? i didnt understand, I think i'm just being oversensative about it, and now that i've been exposed to more adult criticism i'll handle it better. It is kinda odd that my peers accept me but the adults don't... i'm used to things the other way around lol. Oh well, looking back on things i really am glad i went to UC last year, and i'm partially looking forward to going back. I dont think i'll ever be ready to endulge in wismer food for another semester, but freedom from needing a ride everywhere sounds so nice :)  I'm posting some stuff i wrote in Ohio, when Brett came back from the dead - check it out, it should be in the June 20-25 era lol good luck"

"event","This computer, only like 9 months old, has too many viruses on it from my brother... so i cant type in color. this irritates me because i like to take care of things, not destroy them. whatever, i have my own computer. 

so surgery was all i thought it was going to be, painful. seeing other surgeries was fun... but next time i think i'm going to go against my parents and suggest that i am not on the OR list the day i observe. I couldnt eat from 12am to 5:30pm the next day... and it got to me a lil bit. so the first case was a little boy who had what they call ""u.v.itis"" which is short for something... but i dont know the full name. he had 4 surgeries performed in one day, poor kid. His cornea was scrapped (to remove calcium deposits caused by the disease) then he had part of his iris carved out (to increase liquad flow) then he had a cataract extraction, and finaly a tube shunt put in. When i saw him at post-op this morning he seemed less then thrilled. 

the next case was an older lady. she had a cataract extraction as well as a shunt implant. i didnt get to see the whole surgery because i had to register for my surgery... blah

so for me, i couldnt get away without an IV - but this was my first surgery without general anesthesia. so i was wide awake with some numbing eye drops and 2 injections of pain killers. he put in like 10 stitches to cover the leak, and then stitched up the bottom of my eye so that the shunt wouldnt stick out as much (ever see the white bubbley stuff at the bottom of my eye? it should be gone now) he also removed the stitch that surrounded the tube that he implanted in May. so my pressure is a bit low, but things look good so far. 

Tensions: L=7  R=19

I go back in 2 weeks, and i will visit the OR as an observer over winter break. Being awake was strange... they cover EVERYTHING but the eye they're working in. they clamp that eye open - it quickly dries out and your vision is blurred the whole time... the lights are bright, and the last 3 stitches were painful. I had a good grasp on the cords that were laying on my right side because of the pain lol but it all went away, now i just have that normal burning sensation from the stitches. before my surgery, i got to spend some time in the staff room - it was so funny a couple people looked at me like ""what the f... i know her... dont i??"" it was fun meeting all the nurses who've taken care of me over the years. they all picked on me because i couldnt eat - and i got to meet my regular doctor's grandson, he's such a cutie! 

so that's all for now... i've been trying to sleep but that's proving impossible around this house so i'm gonna do some light packing, phone calls are more then welcome!"

<P><FONT color=#66ff99>My right eye finally stabalized at a low pressure. The left eye is doing well too, however the leak has not healed after 2 weeks with a bandage contact. The call is to have my 38th operation to insert a few stitches and remove a stitch from the 37th operation site. This should be happening August 6th - the same day that i will be observing surgeries in the OR. I will just take the place of the last case - since it will be done with topical anesthesia i wont have to go through most of the pre-op procedures. Topical (spelt as it sounds) means that my eye will be numbed through an injection straight to the site of surgery. I will be fully awake and able to move my eye, just not feel the sewing - i hope anyway :) No IV necesarry (YaY!!) Unfortunetly i still have to stay over night for a post-op the next day, which sucks because i wanted Brett to visit that weekend, oh well. I'm exhausted and my eye is irritated so i think i'm going to stay in tonight, going out tomorrow night sounds fun though, any takers? :) g'night!</FONT></P>"

"event","Today I got to play med. student for a day -- it was fun! Dr. Congdon treated me like one of his colleagues. I got to observe patients eye's through a learning scope (a microscope attached to the main slit-lamp, so 2 people can see the same thing) Its amazing how many parts of the eye there are - i mean i had seen all the diagrams and learned about everything but to actually see it was amazing. Everyone's iris is so differant - and i got to see a fair ammount of differant disorders. I saw the effects of basically every surgery that i've had completed. It takes a lot of patience to keep a clinic running - jumping from one patient to another without a break between - keeping all their medical history in the back of your mind and diagnosing &amp; making future plans - it does sound like a lot - but i'm sure when you get to know your patients it gets easier. I also noticed that my doctor takes extra care with my eyes, verses the other patients he saw today. This is the same type of care i've always received, maybe he does see some potential in me. He always explained things a lot more to me then he does to his other patients. Interesting, anyways. Apparently i'm too small for a regular white jacket, so being dressed up had to do. <BR>One patient was having a stitch removed - apparently he had a problem keeping his eye still (his own fault) and ended up with a scratch across his cornea - those arent fun, but he should have held still... or at least not darted his eyes all the way to the other side of his head. <BR>I want to see my own eyes, as weird as that sounds - i'm sure its not impossible - they can set up a monitor or film it or something, maybe i'll ask them to do it someday. My next adventure is to play med. student in the O.R. sometime in August&nbsp; - i'm very excited about that, and i hope i dont get creeped out, i dont think i will. I'll have to stop by the recovery room, all the nurses know me well there lol. It'd be nice to see their faces for once, and say hi without bandages and an IV attached. and that's all for now - back to being a kid!"

<P><FONT color=#99ff99>he poked me with the tono-pen for 10 minutes straight and it HURTS when my pressure is low. then painted my whole eye (twice) with flourecense to see the indents and whatnot, no leaks. so then he dilated me and looked in the back which was difficult so he sent me up to have an ultrasound done to check for retinal detachment, that came back negative so he decided that the stitch around the new tube just disolved early - and that was that. </FONT></P>

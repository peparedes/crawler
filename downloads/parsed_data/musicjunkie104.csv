"event","I know that two hours isn't too far away from home, but it still feels like so far away.  I hate being this far away from my family.  

First, David has his first IM basketball game tonight.  Not a big deal, I know, but I still wish I could be there to cheer him on.  He's been so excited for it all week, and he said that he would make a basket for me.  But I just want to be in the stands so badly.

Second, today is my gramma's 82nd birthday.  Whoa.  This woman has been one of my best friends since I can remember, and I am so sad that I can't be there with her to celebrate.  Realistically, she won't be around too much longer, and I really hope that this birthday isn't her last and that I had to miss it.

Third, my little brother drove a car for the first time today.  He called me all excited as soon as he got home, and I wish I could have been there to experience the excitement in person.  He is growing up so fast, and I miss so much of his life when I'm here.  It sucks.

I know that I'm here for a reason, and that I will be home soon enough, but it's days like today when I really wish I was home now.  Blah."

"event","When was the last time that you actually looked at a snowflake?  One single snowflake.  I bet it's been years since I have.  But today on the way back from chapel (which was also great) Cindy and I spent the walk catching and looking at snowflakes.  They are so beautiful.  God is amazing.  God creates things are so small but so intricate.  It's wonderful.  I wouldn't say that I had a life-changing religious experience or anything, but a nice sense of relaxation came over me as I looked at those small, fragile snowflakes.  

Our lives are kind of like snowflakes.  Compared to the rest of the world, we are so small, and are only on this earth for a short amount of time.  Yet in that time we bless the world with our presence, and we bring joy and peace to those around us.  We are all just as beautiful as snowflakes because we are created in God's image, just as snowflakes are.    

So...if you're feeling down about having to go out and make it through the massive amounts of snow, don't.  Just take the time along the walk to look at the wonder of the snowflakes."

Woot for 16 fabulous new members of Sigma Kappa, including 14 new members and 2 alumnae initiates (one of which is the president's wife!).  Yeah!  And I was so happy to see Mona go through!  Heck yes.

I got to hug the boys tonight at midnight.  It was such a great feeling.  It was sucky seeing all of the happy couples who haven't been able to touch for a week.  I was so jealous.  But oh well.  I got lots of Timmy hugs.

And I do have a date with David tomorrow night.  He doens't have to work, so we're meeting in Mt. Pleasant for dinner and to go shopping.  I can't wait!!

I accomplished a lot this weekend.  I read a 300 page book.  I cut my hair off.  I helped David with papers and homework and such.  And I spent quality time with my family.  What fun.

This week is Sigma Kappa's I-Week, and I'm so excited!  My baby girl Mona is going to go active on Thursday, and I can't wait for her to be an active member of the house!!

"event","1. I'm going to Coe next year.  Woo hoo!

2. Mini-choir tour this weekend = fabulous 85% of the time, sucky 15% of the time.  Here's why:

     GOOD STUFF

     A. I didn't have to ride on the bus and got to have a road trip with four fabulous peeps.  Mad props to Tim, Rosie, Amee, and especially to Mat for driving.  

     B. On the way to Des Moines we saw goats having sex.

     C. I touched a pulpit where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke, and I got the chills.

     D. Rosie and I got to ride in a Jaguar.

     E. Rosie and I got to stay with Amee and Jenny Martin.

     F. The four of us stayed in a flippin mansion, and it was amazing.

     G. When everyone else was annoyed with the freshmen, I got to get back in the truck with the posse and have fun.

     H. I got to see my family: Mom, brother, Dad, girlfriend, daughter, Gramma, Aunt, and DAVID!!

    BAD STUFF

     A. Chinese food for dinner.  Yuk.

     B. Annoying new people on choir tour.  Learn your place, kids!

     C. Watching a deer get mauled down by the car ahead of us on the highway.  Ew.

3. I went to the hospital again after I got back from choir tour - this time it's a severe bladder infection.  Yum.  So let's talley...that's three trips to the ER this semester, two of them being in Quincy.  I vote that I'm done with that for a while.

And that's my life.  Have a nice day. 

Peace Out."

"event","So, I have heard that I have been making a few people worry about me by my last few posts.  I haven't really talked to anyone from home in a long time, and by reading stuff on here without knowing what's going on with me can be really confusing, and I apologize for that.  

 I'm okay.  Really.  I'm just trying to make some really difficult decisions right now.  I guess I will just throw it all out there for people to know - I'm trying to decide whether or not I want to continue my education at Culver.  I've been getting really frustrated with things here, and am working on figuring out what to do.  That's it.  There are no problems with me and David, no thoughts of suicide, or anything of the sort.  Just frustration about my education.  That's all.

I think I am getting closer and closer to making my decision about what I want to do, and as soon as I figure out what the heck I am doing with my life, I will let everyone know.  But I just wanted to say that I am okay - there is no need to worry about me.  Sometimes I may be a little over dramatic, but I'm a girl.  It happens.

So, sorry for all of the confusion.  Really, I am happy!

I love you all, and please talk to me if you have questions!!

""Only Hope""

[Written by Switchfoot]

There's a song that's inside of my soul
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again
I'm awake in the infinite cold
But You sing to me over and over and over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands
and pray to be only Yours
I pray to be only Yours
I know now you're my only hope

Sing to me the song of the stars
Of Your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again
When it feels like my dreams are so far
Sing to me of the plans that You have for me over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray 
To be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope

I give You my destiny
I'm giving You all of me
I want Your symphony
Singing in all that I am
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I pray to be only yours
I know now you're my only hope"

"event","So it's been like a year and a half since I last updated.  I've been busy or just plain lazy, and just haven't gotten around to it.  But here's a quick recap of the most important events of the past month.

Recruitment went fabulously.  We got 18 beautiful new girls in Sigma Kappa, and I am so excited to have each and every one of them here with us.  And we had a ring down tonight and one of them is engaged.  So that's way exciting.

And then I died.  Almost.

I apparently have had bronchitis for a number of weeks, but thought my cough was just from a cold or allergies or something.  Nope.  Bronchitis.  And having bronchitis for a number of weeks leads to pluresy, which is an inflammation of the lining of the lungs.  VERY PAINFUL.  So I waited for weeks to get anything checked out because it's so expensive and such a hastle to go anywhere when I'm at school.  But then I almost died and my hero Megan Carmody took me to the ER in Quincy.  That was a good time.  EKG...12 cc's of blood gone...chest X-rays...heart monitors...   Oh yeah, yippee.  So then I decided to go home.  

I was planning on going home anyway, but I just decided to make it a long weekend and skip out on classes on Friday.  So I got my drugs and went home, and slept all weekend.  And then I slept all week.  The sleep was interrupted, though, by another trip to the ER at home.  Let's just say that I went home on September 22, and I am just now returning to school on October 2.  Yeah.  Being sick sucks.  I missed out on so much stuff here, not to mention over a week of school, which, when you're in college, that's not a good idea.  But I'll be okay.  I hope.  

I did get to spend lots of time with David throughout the past week, though.  He took good care of me, and it was so nice just to be home and be with him and my family.  I definitely needed it.  But now I have to jump right back into college life.  That'll be fun.  But it's okay.  It's an exciting week in the house - Big Sis Week.  Lots of fun!!  

Peace out."

"event","Quick recap of the awesomeness of the past week...

1. Lacey was here last weekend!  We went to the bar and sang karaoke and then to the frats and I took her to the Wheeler to lose her Wheeler virginity.  It was so great!  

2. David's brother Dustin asked me to sing in his wedding in May.  Whoa dang!  I am SO EXCITED!!  I've never sung in a wedding before, and I felt so special that he would ask me, because he's by far the sibling that I know the least.  So that's was freaking amazing.

3. I got a 105% on my Spanish test.  Yeah.  It was good times.

4. Abbey Eicken is pretty much my hero.

5. Tim, Rosie, and Andy found a kitty tonight, and I got to hold it.  It was amazing.

6. I love cookies, especially when they're homemade and given to you for free.

7. I love getting mail almost as much as I love cookies...maybe more even.

8. Rush week is next week!  Woo hoo!

8. DU/Sigma Kappa prank wars are flippin fun and I love it!  Even though I need to clean my car off tomorrow because...

10. DAVID AND I HAVE A DATE TOMORROW!  We're meeting in Mt. Pleasant after Kaptain's birthday shindig for just a couple hours to eat and chill.  I'm so way excited!  I think I'm taking a blanket and we're going to just sit outside and look at the stars or something cheesy like that. But I can't wait!

And that's pretty much the awesomeness of the week.  There has been a lot of negative, too, but it's no fun to focus on the negative when there is so much great stuff to talk about!!

And with that, I'm off.

Peace Out!"

Kutless

My decision can not be put off again
I see the right choice but my heart is filled with dread
It all seems backwards in my head, my head

I know it seems too wrong to be right
This way is so much harder to fight
But in the end I know it is true
This way is better, it's better for you

Choose a little pain and gain a life with joy
Accepting pleasure now will earn a life of pain
It all seems backwards in my head, my head

I know it seems too wrong to be right
This way is so much harder to fight
But in the end I know it is true
This way is better
It's better for you, for you

Sometimes I wonder why it's this way
When it's done the burden is gone
This discomfort will be taken away
As soon as it's over, it's over for me

I know it seems too wrong to be right
This way is so much harder to fight
But in the end I know it is true
This way is better
It's better for you, for you

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just need to make myself happy.  How do I do that?  I just have to pray and wait.  But I'm working on it little by little.  Thanks to everyone who has helped, even though no help can be given but that from above.  I'll get through it.  It'll just take a lot of tear and difficulty."

"event","I went home last night to see Ryleigh Morgan.  It was so great.  But before I saw her I went home and saw my mom for a while and picked up the stuff that I forgot to bring down here.  Then I went and hung out with David at his college for a while - it was so nice.  I bought a pack of cigarettes for Andy.  It was the first one I ever bought, and I was excited to buy it and I wasn't even carded!  Bummer.  Then we went to the hospital.  It was so fun to see the baby.  She snorts when she sleeps, and it's so funny.  So we were there for quite a while.  We ordered pizza and watched a movie and I held the baby...a lot.  It was so great.

Then David and I went back to my house because my mom had presents for us and it was way exciting!  Then we went out driving for a while and had a really good time, but at this point I was really tired, so I decided to stay in CR for the night instead of driving back to Culver.  So I stayed at Coe with David and Ryan, and it was a good time.  I didn't realize how nice it was to sleep in the same bed with him.  Yeah.  I miss that.

So I got up at 5:15 this morning and drove back to Canton.  Blah.  And on top of that I had 5 classes today.  Puke.  I'm so tired.  But I'm on the phone with David so I'm sure I'll still be up for a while.  Bethany's gone, so I have the room to myself, and it's kind of nice.  And Lacey's coming tomorrow!!  Yeah!!

And that's all I've got.

"event","So David's sister Monica had a baby last night.  I'm so excited!  This is the first time that I get to experience the birth of a niece (so I know she's not technically my niece, but pretty much, right?).  Her name is Ryleigh Reeves.  She is 6 pounds 7 ounces and 20 inches long.  She's got a full head of curly dark hair, and huge dark eyes.  I get to go home tomorrow afternoon and see her, and I'm so excited!!  I haven't had a baby in the family for so long, and it'll be nice to have one around again, especially when it's my job to spoil her.  Yay!  
 
So in lew of going home tomorrow I had to get all of my homework done tonight.  This included 20 pages for New Testament and  50 problems and 16 pages of reading for Logic.  Darn you Dr. Walsh!  But I did manage to get it all done.  Woo.
 
So I'm gonna go and get my stuff together to look all cute tomorrow when I go home.  I'm so excited!  Partly to see Ryleigh, and partly to see David, I guess.  Yeah.  I like him a little.
 
And that's it.
 
Peace out!"

"event","Today was the first day of classes.  Here's the breakdown:

World Civilizations II from 9:00 - 10:00...already took a page of notes.

New Testament from 10:00 - 11:00...68 people in that class, but I'm still way excited!

Concert Choir from 12:00 - 1:00...I love singing!

Logic from 2:00 - 3:00...I'm going to hate this class.

Spanish I from 3:00 - 4:00...I'm so glad Michelle is in there to be my friend!

I also auditioned for choir this afternoon, and it went really well.  In between stuff and after classes I worked on my homework.  I was actually kind of excited to do it.  Yeah, I'm a nerd.  

We had the BBQ at el presidente Fox's pad this evening.  It was pretty fun.

And the best part of the semester so far was the impromptu jam session in Abbey and Jessi's room.  Rocking out to worship music for two hours was so fun!!  Thanks girls!

And now I'm watching Fresh Prince and I'll be heading to bed soon.  Gotta get up for math class tomorrow.  Boo!!

Peace Out."

"event","Let me just say how AWESOME it is to have freshmen on campus!  I have been having a great time meeting new people.  I helped them move in all morning yesterday, and I think that I may have possibly carried something for every single person that lives on third floor Wood.  But it's alright.  It was cool to meet people.  And let me also tell you that Shannon Hall looks amazing now.  What a transformation!

There's a girl in my FYE group named Cameo and she may possibly be the coolest person I've ever met.  She graduated early, and she's so smart, but still so flippin cool.  We sat next to each other at the John Rush concert last night (and BTW, if you ever get to hear John Rush, be ready to be amazed - go to www.johnrush.com - he's AMAZING!!) and we had a great time.  Then I took her up to the houses for a while.  She doesn't drink either, so that was fun.  We went to DU first because J-Rod and Richmond were back for the weekend.  It was really nice to see them.  Then we headed over to the Lambda Chi house to see Mike and Kyle.  Mike has possibly the coolest bed/fort ever, and if you ever get a chance to see it, you'll never want to leave.  And I was so happy to see Kyle again.  I missed him a lot over the summer.

Today's been pretty boring.  I hung out with Cameo this morning at the Wildcat Welcome stuff.  She ate lunch with us and then came to hang out at the house for a while.  That was really fun.  Susie Welker surprised me and stopped by the house.  I love that lady!  And that's about it.  We have a banquet at 5, dessert at Deiker's at 6, and then the pool/karaoke party at 8, which I'm so way dang excited for!

Things with David are going much better now.  I'm not so lonely now that everyone's back, and we had a long (and very difficult) discussion about how we're going to handle things this year.  He basically kicked me in the butt and told me that I was acting dumb and made me accept things that I knew were coming but didn't want to accept.  So we're all good now.  And I still like him.  A little.

And that's about it.  I'm so excited for classes tomorrow!  Yeah, I know, I'm a nerd.

Hope everyone has a fantabulous school year!

Peace Out!"

"event","I woke up in a much better mood today.  The rest of the Greeks moved back today, so I got to see Abbey, Rosie, and Tim.  That made me feel much better.  I missed them so much!  Now I really feel like I'm back at Culver.  I didn't feel so lonely today.  I was so excited to be with my friends again.  Ah.  What a relief.

Training went by really fast today, which was nice.  I'm really stoked for the freshman to get here tomorrow.  I'm ready to meet the kids in my FYE group and to be on the other end of the moving in process here at Culver.  Yay!

We went to the Wheeler tonight.  First Wheeler run of the school year - my sophomore year has officially begun.  It was way fun.

So now I really have to get to bed because I have to get up at the buttcrack of dawn to help move the freshies in tomorrow.  Blah.  But it'll be worth it!

"event","The past few days have been the hardest of my life.  I knew all summer that the time would come when I would have to say good-bye to David and move back to school, but that didn't make it any easier.  The summer absolutely flew by and I can't believe that I have already said good-bye.

Yesterday I moved him into his room at Coe.  I got to go to some of his orientation stuff, and I helped him settle into his first day at college.  It was nice to see him off, and I am so glad that I got to help him instead of me having to move first.  But at the same time it was extremely difficult.

There have been lots of tears the past few days, and it all culminated last night.  Dang did I cry.  When you go from living with someone for nearly four months to not being able to see them for weeks at a time, it's horrible.  And I don't know when I'll be going back home, and that makes it that much more difficult.  When I finally left Coe and David brought me home, the last thing I wanted to do was get out of that car.  I've never seen him so upset, and that made it that much worse.  I had to walk into the house where we both spent our entire summer together.  I had to go into the room and look at all the spots where he had his stuff.  I had to pack up my stuff that he helped me get together.  I had to sleep in the bed that we slept in all summer.  And man did I cry.  

I'm doing better today.  I was distracted with moving into my house, and it was a welcome distraction.  Our room is almost all put together, and that's a great feeling.  It looks really good, and I'm relieved to be here now.  If I can't see David I would much rather be two hours away then a few blocks away.  It makes it a lot easier to be apart.  

It's hardly been over 24 hours since I left him, but it feels like it's been forever already.  I miss him so much already.  It really sucks.  When you love someone that much, being apart for a few hours is hard enough, let alone weeks.  But we've done this before, and we can, and will, continue to do it until we're both through with school.  I'm sure it will get easier every time.  At least I hope so.  I'm not sure how many times I can go through this again.

So now that I'm all unpacked and not stinky anymore, I'm going to chill in my room.  I've defenitly earned some lay around and do nothing time.

Peace Out"

"event","I go to college one week from today.  Not sure how excited I am about that.  David and I celebrated our 7 month anniversary yesterday, and he brought me roses and we had a really nice day, and I'm definitely not ready to leave that.  Boo.  But I guess it's inevitable.  I'm excited to see people, though.  But not excited to pack.  I go back and forth all the time.  Once I get there, though, I'll be alright.  It's just the whole leaving process that sucks big balls.

I've been babysitting like a crazy mo-fo lately.  It's been fun, actually.  I know that there is no way that I am ready to be a mom, though.  They wear me out!  I like playing for a while, but by the end of the day I'm really ready to give them back.  But I do enjoy the extra cash...

I'm sick.  I think I just ate too much for lunch, but I took a long nap and am not feeling too much better, so we'll see.

And that's about it.  I guess I'll go bum around or something.  I'm watching ""So You Think You Can Dance"" and it might be the greatest show in the entire world.

Last night Sara Germain and I went on a date to Texas Roadhouse.  It was fun.  I've hardly talked to her since graduation, so that was nice to chat.  Then Sara, Lacey Ho, David and I went to see Sky High.  I thought it would be way dumb, but it wasn't.  It was fun.  I liked it.

Tonight I'm going to Casey Rigdon's for the shindig of the summer, and I'm way stoked.  Everyone's going to be there, and I will probably get to meet some of Casey's cool friends from other schools, which will be cool.  

Everyone's getting ready to leave for school, and it's weird.  Terrance leaves on Tuesday, and Ben leaves next weekend.  Then the high school starts next Wednesday, then the week after that David and I go.  It's weird.  The summer went by so fast.  But it's cool.  School should be fun this year.

And that's about it.  I've got some work to do.  Yup.

"event","So two weeks from today I head back to Culver.  Which means that two weeks from yesterday David goes to college.  Which means that two weeks from yesterday will be the last time that I will see him for quite a while.  Boo.

I got the news yesterday that one of my classmates at school (Drew Schmidt) was killed in a car accident.  I didn't know him too well, but he was a good friend to some of my friends.  It's so sucky.  And it brought back a lot of memories from Sierra, and that was hard to deal with for a while.  Once again it was really sudden and someone so young.  Blah.  

I'm really excited to see people from Culver again, though.  The only ones I've seen are Tim and Rosie, and I've talked to a handful more, but haven't really had contact with much of Culver this summer.  I'm really not looking forward to leaving, but I'm also ready to jump into my sophomore year.  Yay!  No more being a freshman!

I'm sick of being poor.  David's sick of being poor.  College is dumb when it makes you poor.  Yeah.

I'm preaching at the Ely Lutheran Church on Sunday at 8 and 10:30.  Come see me!  It'll be fun. 

And that's it.

On Tuesday night David and I drove 3 hours down to Missouri to see Tim and Rosie in Hello Dolly.  It was so good!  When we got there we hung out at Tim's for a while with him and his sister, Laci.  Good times.  We went to eat at this little local restaurant, and it was so good.  Then we went to the show and watched them warm up a little bit.  We watched his sister during the show, and we fed her so many snacks it was rediculous.  The had to strike the set after wards, so we watched them do that, and then we drove back home.  Or, I guess I should say, I drove back home.  We got back around 2:30 AM, but it was so worth it.  I was really excited to see them, and they did a fabulous job.  



Then yesterday I had the best possible day ever at work.  I showed up to the news that we were taking a spur of the moment trip to the Science Station and the IMAX theater.  How awesome!  So we all went, and since you have to be 21 to drive the kids, the three counselors drove together, and it was so fun.  When we got there the three of us got into one of those photo booths where they give you the strip of four pictures, and it was so fun.  Then we watched the movie ""Wolves"" which wasn't too great, but it was okay.  We got to play around in the Science Station for about 45 minutes, and that was fun.  Then on the way back the three of us decided to stop for Dairy Queen.  When we got back we took a quick group picture, and then were off.  And I got paid to do all of that.  I love my job.



And that's about it.  Nothing's been too exciting today.  But David has the night off, so I'm going to spend some time with him.  Yay!



Peace Out."

"event","Here are some highlights from this weekend:

~I found out that I had West Nile fever.  But it's cool.  It's not horrible - something you just have to get over.  And I'm almost there.

~David and I got our weekend together, and it was great!

~We saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Very weird, but awesome.  

~We ate at Red Lobster and we had a really weird server.  But the food was good.

~We went to the Galaxy Theater and played arcade games.  David won the jackpot in one and we have over 400 tickets.  The games there rock, but the prizes suck, so we got lots of jewelry to dress me up like a princess, including bracelets, light up rings, and a tiara.

~Then we ran into Ben Jones and Ryan Mason while I was dressed up as a princess and carrying two stuffed puppies.  They laughed.

~We then went to see the Devil's Rejects.  Possibly the most satanic movie ever.  And there was a 5 year old kid there.  Horrible parents.  And, by the way, I was dressed as a princess throughout the whole movie.

~When we went back to the hotel, there were people drinking and toking it up outside the doors.  When we went in we walked in after one who turned around and asked if we were following him.  He scared us a lot, and then came back to us and shook our hands, and as we walked off (quite quickly, I may add) he just looked at us and said that we were going for a night of pleasure.  Creepy, eh?

~We had breakfast at Perkin's this morning, and it was so good.

~Work was flippin awesome today.

~Since I got off work, we watched Love Actually, 2ge+her, and now the Wizard of Oz.  Great stuff.  And I'm still wearing my tiara.

And that's all I've got

Peace Out."

"event","I guess I forgot to post on here that while we were in Montreat David got me a promise ring.  It's silver and has a heart with a purple stone in the middle.  It's kind of ghetto, but we got it at a bead store that we were making jewelry in together.  I love it!  And then on the way back (the 16th) we celebrated our 6 month anniversary.  Tell me we're not romantic.  We left Montreat at 5 AM with all of the week's trash in our laps so we could take it to the dumpster.  Yum.  Then we slept most of the way home with our feet all over each other (except for the time where we moved down to the floor and slept in between the seats).  We had a romantic lunch at Waffle House in Louisville, then hit the road some more.  We got back here around 5 PM to realize that his car battery had died.  So we jumped that (and let me tell you, it was so HOT outside, but we didn't want to run the air conditioner).  So we came home and showered and whatnot and then went out to dinner with Joe and Kira at Red Lobster.  When we were finished with that I typed up my sermon, and then we had a little alone time before we went to bed.  And that's it.  Very romantic, eh?

Since then, though, he's been working 12+ hours everyday, so I have hardly been able to spend any time with him.  I don't know what I would do if he didn't live here.  At least I get to see him for a few minutes between jobs, and we get to sleep in the same bed.  If he didn't live here, I would never see him.  Because it's supposed to be flippin HOT the next few days, he's not roofing Monday or Tuesday mornings, so tomorrow my mom is treating us to a hotel room for the night.  We're checking in tomorrow afternoon, probably having a romantic dinner at McDonald's, and we're going to swim and just have some alone time.  I can't wait!

Other than that life has been pretty boring.  I've been sick, so I've just been laying around.  I got bit up like tuna a few nights ago - I got over 40 bug bites.  Apparently my body really doesn't like bug bites, because it reacted horribly.  I got sick, and my lymph node in my left arm pit swelled to almost the size of a golf ball yesterday.  It's a little better today, so that's good.  It's probably nothing...West Nile maybe.  No biggy.  But while I've been laying around for the past few days I was able to finish Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  Pretty good.  Not my favorite HP book, but good none the less.

And that's about it.  I guess I should shower or something.  That would be a good idea.

Peace Out."

"event","Montreat was fun, but here are some grips that I think everyone should hear.

1. If you have to live with other people, don't leave your crap lying around!  When you finish eating, pick up your dishes.  When you eat something with a wrapper on it, throw it away.  When you take the last of something, throw the box away.  Close the chip bag - they go stale.  And when you drop Fruit Loops on the floor and watch it happen, pick them up!  It's not that hard!

2. If someone is ahead of you in line, that means that they got there before you.  This does not mean that you deserve seats in front of them.  If you want good seats, get there an hour early like the people before you.  

3. Take off your hat when you pray.  Gosh!

4. When people are presenting something, don't talk.  It's rude.

5. When you're at a church retreat, don't use profanity.  It offends a lot of people there.

6. If you have a boyfriend, don't make out with another guy, especially one that you haven't even known for a week.  And then, when your youth leader catches you, don't deny it.

Thank you.  But other than all that crap, Montreat was great.  My small group was awesome!!  I loved every person in there.  It rained every day that we were there, but it was kind of nice because then it didn't get so hot.  The only crappy part of the rain was when we tried to go to Sliding Rock, which is over an hour from Montreat, and it was closed because the current was too high.  Oh well.  We still got some good pics.  It was nice to get away to such a beautiful place and get to go to a conference that I love and to get to spend so much time with David.  It was the perfect vacation.

And now I have drugs to make me not crazy.  : )  I got some anti-depressant pills, and I can already tell what a difference they are making.  Thanks to everyone who gave me support.  I'm feeling a ton better!

Today I went back to work and welcomed myself back to the real world.  Blah.  David's got some family problems right now which really suck, and we couldn't get a hold of him to let him know.  But everything's alright now.  His sister Monica picked me up tonight to take me to his niece, Sydney's, tee-ball game.  It was so cute.  And now I'm home eating supper at 9:30 at night.  Yum.  

That's all I've got.

Peace Out!"

"event","Who's tired of me being grumpy and sad ALL the time??  I sure am.  And that's why I'm going to get help.

For years I have wondered if I am depressed.  I can honestly say that only two things have made me truly, 100% happy: The love that David gives me and putting my heart and soul into church.  Everything else may have made me happy to some extent, but never truly happy.  I've known for a long time that I am good at putting on a mask to hide my depression, but I never realized how bad it was until I noticed that I wear that mask nearly all the time, with the exception of when I can completely let my guard down around David.  Whether or not I like to show it or admit it, I care so much about what other people view in me, and that's why I have tried so hard for so long to hide my unhappiness.  Who wants to be friends with someone who is depressed and complains and cries all the time.  I don't.  So I didn't let that side of me show.

I never said anything to anyone because I didn't want to admit that I have a problem.  Saying ""I suffer from depression"" is like admitting that you have a huge fault that no one wants to have.  I didn't want people to think that I was unstable or think that they had to walk on eggshells around me so that I wouldn't ""go into a spell of depression.""  

But I'm not hiding it anymore.  I can't.  I have so many great things in my life, and yet I am still unhappy.  I'm ready to step up and say ""I'M DEPRESSED!""  It's okay.  There's nothing wrong with it.  I know that I have a problem, and I'm getting help first thing tomorrow morning.  

Don't be scared for me; be proud.  I'm stepping up.  I'm getting help.  I'm taking care of myself for once.  I'm tired of living a lie.  I just want to be happy - genuinely happy.  I want to smile and laugh and have a good time and mean it.  I don't want to sit around any more.  I want to get out and have fun.  And hopefully the help that I am getting will help me do that.

So after a trip (hopefully) to the doctor tomorrow I will have what I need to be a happier person.  I'm leaving tomorrow night for North Carolina for a youth retreat, and it couldn't come at a better time.  Hopefully the next time I talk to you all I will be in a much better mood.

I am sorry if I have worried anyone with my upset behavior this summer.  It's something that I've been trying to deal with on my own, but I know now that sometimes I just need to give in and let myself get help.  And that's what I'm doing.

Thank you to all of you who have taken care of me and have given me encouraging words along the way.  They have helped more than you can know.

And with that, I'm out.  Hope you all have a wonderful weekend and week next week, and I'll see you all when I get back.

Good night."

"event","This weekend has been fabulous.  I went to Kamster's house on Saturday night and had the most fun I have had in a long time.  We went ""swimming"" in the pool for a while, which really consisted of floating around for a while.  But it was awesome.  While Lacey, Kamster and I were ""swimming"" the other kids busted out the golf cart.  At one point we had all 8 of us on the cart, and it was so fun.  We drove around the lawn all crazy, and it was so fun.  Did I mention that I had a blast??

Kamster's parents also had a bunch of people over, so we ate lots of food and had a great time.  Then we went back outside and played some more on the golf cart, and then played a good game of four square.  I haven't played it since Prom a year ago, and I forgot how fun it was.  The big kids (a.k.a. the adults) built up a bon fire, and we all went over to sit with them.  Lacey busted out her guitar and we all sang it was was awesome.  

A few of us went to Perkin's, and it was so fabulous to spend time with people that I don't see very often (Antwon, Terrance, Ben, and Ryan Z.)  I loved it.

Sunday was David and Leigh date day.  We went to church, then came back and watching Moulin Rouge.  Man I love that movie.  We took a nap for a while, and then we went to see Bewitched.  Meh.  It was alright.  We went for dinner at Leonardo's.  YUM.  Then we went to Ellis Park and watched the water ski team do their show.  The river was really wavy, so a lot of them were falling down and that was quite entertaining.  We ran into a bunch of the kids and decided to join them at Galvin's mom's boathouse down the river a way.  We watched the fireworks from there.  Then we had to make the 546234 mile trek back to our car (through the ghetto).  We did find $10, which was great.  When we got back the fam watched Alien vs. Predator. Yeah.  Oh well.  

The 4th of July rocked my face off.  We went to the Ely fireman's breakfast and it was awesome as usual.  When we got home David and I watched The Notebook (he got his movie Sunday night, I got mine Monday).  I hadn't seen that before.  Dang that's an awesome movie.  Then we had a neighborhood BBQ and I beat all the boys at Poker.  That's right.  I'm awesome.  We headed back into Ely for the parade, and I helped Cole, Luke, and Jackson get candy.  It was so fun.  We headed back into CR and to my gramma's apartment to watch the fireworks from the suntan deck.  They were great seats, and I got to play with sparklers with Kenny and Nichole.  So fun.  David and I went to Perkin's and had the worst dining experience of our lives...ask about it sometime.  It's quite funny.  And then we came home and went to bed.

Today's been boring.  Cramps like a mo-fo.  Shopping at Wal-Mart.  Lunch at Chik-fil-A.  Good stuff.  And that's it.  

Peace Out."

"event","I think that PMSing may possibly be the worst thing that a person has to go through on a regular basis.  Thank you.

I went over to Lacey Jo's house last night and it was so great.  I haven't been out of here in a while, and I definitely havn't seem most of my friends since graduation season, so it was so nice to see everyone.  Antwon decided to come home for the weekend which was cool.  We all sat around and played Nerts and ate pizza.  It was great.  I love my friends.

Today has just been a grumpy pants kind of day.  Nothing big really.  Just nothing going right.  My upper lip got cut on the inside this morning, and that hurts.  We took Kenny to a farm to work on the youth group float for Ely's 4th of July parade, and David almost missed the driveway, so he decided to turn into another one and go around back.  Little did we know that there were guys painting a barn back there, and when he drove over the paint hose it got caught on his car and broke and white paint splattered all over the ground and his marroon car.  So instead of going out to a nice lunch alone we spent quite a while washing his car and attempting to help the painters and had to have a quick lunch at Perkin's.  Oh well.  I've just come to the conclusion that we are not allowed to spend more than an hour together alone.  

So that's been the major excitement of the day.  I'm heading over to Kamster's in a lil bit to chill.  That'll be fun.  That house always makes me happy.  So, I'll catch you on the flip side.

Peace Out

P.S. Countdown to Montreat: 1 Week!"

"event","Things have been going so great.  Gosh.  And then I start thinking.  I think that I think way too much.  One little thing gets me, and then it's on like Donkey Kong.

Things just kind of snowballed.  Nothing big.  Just little things that piled up on each other.  And I couldn't take it anymore.  Everyone's asleep but I'm not tired, and I didn't feel like sitting around and watching TV, so I just went out for a drive.  And I thought about my Frustration...

Frustration with my innability to be content with what I have.

Frustration because I don't know where I belong anymore, and I thought I was through with that specific decision making process for a while.

Frustration because everyone around me is growing up so fast, and I want things to be like they used to be. 

Frustration that even though I want things to be like they used to be, I am in such a hurry to grow up that I can't enjoy how things are now.

Frustration that I'm poor.

Frustration that I was expecting something and was told that I would get something, and I didn't.

Frustration that I couldn't understand that it was okay that I didn't get it because it was better for someone else.

Frustration for being so selfish.

Frustration for being Frustrated!

Gosh!!

So I just hopped in the car and drove.  I wasn't sure where I was going, but I found my way to 1st Ave and drove to Marion before I turned around and came back.  I calmed down a lot, and came back in a much better mood than I left.  And I realized something...I love Cedar Rapids.  If you're ever in a bad mood, drive down 1st Ave at midnight on a Thursday night.  You'll realize how peaceful this city is.  Even when I drove through the ghetto and right past the ghetto Vee, all I saw was peacefulness.  As I drove past the Irish Democrat and saw a group of 20somethings outside after a night of partying, all I saw was peacefulness.  The best part was driving through downtown and seeing the big huge orange moon peek out from behind the Aliant and Iowa Reality buildings, amongst others.  Talk about peacefulness.  I really like this city, no matter how much I may gripe about it.  Maybe I'll be back here quicker than I thought...  

I drove by Coe, and I was really tempted to turn in and drive around.  But I didn't.  I was scared.  Scared of realizing where I actually do belong.  This decision is eating me alive, but at the same time, I don't want to make that decision.  So I just kept driving.  Maybe another day...

So now that I have a huge headache and haven't really accomplished anything, I think I'm going to head to bed.  It's crazy that part of the problem is also what's making me want to go to bed.  He is the most peaceful thing I have right now.  

Frustration turns to peacefulness."

"event","I had such a great weekend.  On Friday night I went out with friends, and it was so fun.  I went to Leonardo's, and there were around 10 of us there eating and having a good time.  And can I just say that I LOVE Shirley Temples, especially when I get a whole pitcher of it with 213408 billion cherries in it.  YUM!!  

Then we all headed to the Old Creamery Theatre and saw Nunsense.  Whoa dang it was so good.  I loved it.  It brought back awesome memories of when I did that for musical theatre.  I was so glad that Lacey and Kristen were there to reflect and remember with, and even though she wasn't with us physically, I know that Sierra was there reflecting with us.  It was a bittersweet thing to see that show.  It was so funny, and we had a great time remembering all that we did when we performed it, but it was also hard remembering how Sierra was such a vital part of the group then and how she's no longer with us.  But it was a great time!

We hung out at Lacey's for a while afterward, and that was great.  I haven't just sat around and talked for a long time.  And can I just say again how flippin adorable Terrance and Jim are.  I really like Jimmy, and they are just so cute.  David and I are going on a double date with them, and I can't wait!

Yesterday we went to Steph Klein's grad party, and then picked up Bob from the vet.  We had her shaved to look like a lion, and it's so funny.  She was still drugged up when we brought her home, and she was walking around like she was drunk, and it was so funny.  And her fat looks like balls if you watch her walk from the back.  Ha Ha!!  Then we headed to Evelyn's recital (in which she performed awesomely, by the way) and ate root beer floats afterward at the reception.  

Last night we had another rehearsal for the variety show next weekend.  That went pretty well.  We headed out to Walford to watch the fireworks, and then over to Matt's to go swimming.  I had so much fun.  And I adore Clinton Dietrich.  He is such a great guy.  

This morning I went to church at St. John's Lutheran in Ely to be installed as a member of the staff for the summer camp (which starts TOMORROW!!!!).  I'm so excited to finally start working.  I got my notebook with the first week's lessons for my class, and I am so excited!  I can't wait.  

So now I am watching a show about ancient Roman sexual secrets (man I love the history channel) and am going to put together a slide show for the variety show.  

Peace out!

P.S. Amber Ferry is one of the coolest people in the world.  The end."

"event","I'm in a flippin awesome rockin good mood today.    Why you ask?  I'm not really for sure.  But I guess I'm moving out of the depressive slump I've been in and am enjoying life.  

Today David and I went on only the most romantic lunch date ever.  First we went to Goodwill and turned in old clothes.  How precious.  Then we went to Long John Silver's (nothing like fried grease to turn you on) and had a conversation with a random old lonely guy the whole time.  Only in Cedar Rapids can you sit next to a retired police officer with a brother who writes books about fish and went to the school that your boyfriend is going to go to and have a conversation with him during your meal.  Gotta love this town.

We also took a rendezvous to the post office and to the bank.  Dang we're hot.  Then I kicked his butt in Jeopardy.

I just got off the phone with Antwon.  I adore him.  He's in a bad mood, but I still like him.  I'm excited to see him later tonight.  

Tonight I'm going to Nunsense with the gang.  YEAH!!  Only the most funny show ever.  I can't wait.  Thanks to Lacey HO for getting the tickets in order.  And I'm also way excited about going to Leonardo's to eat before-hand.  I love that place, yo.  

And I love Tim Hercules.  And Jill BENTLEY!  Sorry about that, yo.  I was writing quickly and wasn't thinking.  But I still adore you!  

I hope that everyone has a fantastic day like I have been!  And now I'm going to go enjoy it some more.

"event","So last night it all hit me.  I've been really depressed lately, and I don't know why.  I'm sure that PMS is part of it (sorry if that was TMI) but it's never been this bad.  I think I'm just way too sensitive.  I take things very seriously when they are not meant to be taken as such, and I let it get to me for hours on end.  Last night it happened again.  And I cried.  Oh boy did I cry.  I think my problem is that once it starts it leads to me thinking about other things that get me depressed and then it's all out of control.  Last night I didn't know what to do.  David tried to consol me, but he didn't know what to do.  I went for a walk, but since I am scared of the dark, and it was 1 AM, I didn't get too far.  I just gave up.  I went to bed, hoping to sleep it off, but I didn't get too much sleep (it didn't help that David had the blanket and I was cold).

When I got up this morning I did feel a little better.  I spent some good time with David today, and I think that helped.  What helped the most, though, was a talk I have with Kami.  Part of the problem was that I felt like I don't belong with her and Antwon anymore, and the fact that they are two of my best friends really hurt.  We had a good talk tonight, though, and I feel a lot better about that situation.  She told me exactly how she feels, and I did the same.  Everything's out in the open, and I think from here on things will get much better.  I wish I could say the same for Antwon.  Unfortunately he won't talk to me about anything other than general stuff, so I have no idea how he feels.  But I know that he is one to deal with things on his own, and I have to let him do that.  He's been one of my best friends for so long, and I won't let anything come between us.  I just hope that one day we can have the friendship that we used to have.

All in all I am starting to get over my pity party and attempting to fix things.  Before I do anything, though, I need to take a good look in the mirror and figure out what all I am unhappy with in myself, and then work from the inside out to fix the things around me.  Thank you so much to everyone who posted and gave me support.  I wasn't asking for nor was I expecting people to respond they way they did, but I thank you so much for doing so.  Don't worry - I couldn't even fathom leaving Culver.  I love it there, I really do.  I was just in a poopy mood.  Everything seems to be piling up right now, and I guess I just couldn't take it.  I don't know.  But I am feeling better.  Thanks again!

So, I guess I'm gonna go.  David's on his way home!  Woo!!

Peace Out.

"event","Why is it that when I should be extremely happy I end up really upset?  I have been blessed with so many things in my life, yet things keep coming to my attention that cause me to realize that maybe the things I had thought I was blessed with may not have been such a great blessing.

I thought that I had the greatest friends ever.  There are people who I thought were my best friends, who would love me and be with me no matter what.  But I have found out that they have turned away.  Maybe I turned them away.  I know that I have been spending my time with David, and maybe it's my own fault.  I don't know.  Do they not like him?  Or do they not like me when I'm with him?  I don't know.  And they won't tell me.  But when I can't share the most important thing in my life with my best friends, who can I share it with?  It hurts so bad to be stuck in the middle, to be pulled between everyone who I hold so dearly in my heart.  What do I do?  

I guess I'm just not a good friend anymore.  Maybe I never was.  I never really felt completely like I belonged at Culver, and now I don't feel like I belong with the people here anymore, either.  Where do I belong?  I know that David loves me, and he accepts me no matter what, but I can't live my life with just him and only him.  I need friends who will accept me.  Hopefully I can find them again."

"event","The past two weeks have been filled with hanging out and lots and lots of graduation food.  Yippee!!

Congrats to the PHS class of 2005.  I adore you all! 

Two weekends ago we kicked off graduation season with Sam Galloway's party.  Good stuff.  I love the entire Galloway family.

This weekend was graduation weekend.  Oh man.  So much going on.  Saturday I went to celebrate with Katie Lee, Casey Rigdon, and then chilled at Galvin's for a while.  He had a bon fire and lots of fun stuff.  Sunday we went to church, then David and I went to a very romantic lunch at McDonald's before graduation.  Graduation was pretty cool, actually.  I even teared up a little when David walked in.  So maybe I'm a cry baby....get off my back.  There was a bird in the US Cellular Center, and it was flying around and it kept my ADD in check quite well.  Steine spoke, and he did a fabulous job.  Then the party hopping began.  We went to the parties of...Jason Blaha, Cody Dill, Zak, Lacey, Laura Carver, N. Cooper, Melissa Szypoerlkjaboiski, and the ever-fabulous Kate Stallman.  Good stuff.  SO many parties.  

Yesterday we went to a couple parties too - Justin Smith and Christina Jordan.  Whew!!!!

So now this week is going to be spent getting another job (I have an interview tomorrow at Claire's) and putting together everything for David's party next Saturday.  EVERYONE COME!!  SATURDAY, JUNE 4, 5-8 PM, FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NEAR ELY!  It's gonna be a rockin' good time, yo!    

And with that...that's all I've got.  Have a great day.

Peace Out."

"event","For all of you whose lives are not complete until you find out what's been going on in my life...here you go! 

Life here has been great. I love being home. I went to Curtain Call both nights, went to the HS choir concert on Monday, my brother's choir concert on Tuesday, and Kenny's solo contest tonight. I miss fine arts at Prairie. 

We had our annual boy's vs. girl's night out after the final Curtain Call. Instead of doing stealth pranks the girls just went up to Joe's and we had a big fight. We came equipped with silly string and shaving cream and the boys had water balloons, and we just made a huge mess and ran around screaming at 1:00 in the morning. It was so fun. For some reason Evelyn, Hannah, and I decided to take off our shirts and run around the house, and Kemper decided to streak with us. It was so fun. Then we played a game of capture the flag, and the girls lost, of course, but it was still so fun.
So the girls headed back to Kamster's around 3, and Evelyn, Hannah, Leslie, and I did something none of us expected to do. We...drumroll please...went STREAKING!! So there you go. All of you at Culver who have been trying to talk me into streaking...I did it. So now I'm definitely doing it when I get back to school.

Other than that, I've just been hanging out with lots of people. Yesterday was the senior's last day, so I went out to breakfast with a bunch of them. Sam and Jason came back here to hang out with me and David, and we played video games. Then we headed to the movie theatre and saw Kingdom of Heaven. Great movie. 
David and I went on a date last night. We went to Buffalo Wild WIngs (how romantic) and then saw Star Wars 3. It was so good. I lost my Star Wars virginity last night. Fun stuff. 
And that's about all that's been going on. David and I started over. We hit a rough spot (actually a few) and finally decided what we have been doing wrong. So we decided to ""start over"" and he asked me out again, and now we're good. Things are good.

And now he's on his way home from work, so I'm gonna go hang out with him. 

Peace Out!"

"event","Culver graduation was on Saturday.  Boring.  But it was cool to go to a college graduation because I've never been to one.  And I got to see a bunch of my sisters and other friends graduate.  I packed up and said my final good-byes to everyone for the summer, and Cristin, Bethany, Bethany's friend Jessica and I went to Primo's for lunch.  Then I came home.  Saturday night David and I went on a date, and it was so fun.  We went to see Amittyville Horror.  Fabulous movie.  Then we went to, where else, Steak N Shake, and got shakes and fries.  To end our date night we went to Wal-Mart to get gag gifts for Kenny.  Fun stuff.

Yesterday was confirmation Sunday at our church.  My brother, along with 12 other 6, 7, and 8 graders joined the church.  I love it.  It was so great to hear what those kids had to say and to see them genuinely excited to join the church.  Both my grammas, my dad, and my aunt Barb came.  After church we all went out to Texas Roadhouse in honor of Kenny, and David and I gave him his gift.  We spent exactly $10 on him, and bought him a bunch of stupid stuff, including lip gloss, panty hose, a gum ball, and hot dogs.  We wrapped it in a piece of table cloth and safety pins.  It was quite entertaining.  We came back home for a little while, and David headed off to work and I went to the Kamster's to work with her and Antwon on our talent show fundraiser for the Montreat trip.  We did choreography for a couple songs, and it made me really miss Ambassadors.  Speaking of which, I have an extra ticket to Curtain Call.  Anyone want it??  We went to youth group, and that consisted of teaching Joe the choreography for his song, looking at old pictures, and playing DVD Trivial Pursuit SNL Version.  Good stuff.  I came home and read a little Wicked, helped David with his homework, and headed to bed around 3:00.

Today I slept in until 11:45.  I got up, ate some, showered, etc.  I'm in the process of doing laundry and waiting to go pick Kenny up from school.  Boring stuff.  But I love it.  I love not having to do anything.  Summer is awesome.  And with that, I'm off. 

Peace Out.  

P.S. Today is our Four Month Anniversary.  How awesome."

"event","This week has been fabulous!  I moved back home on Monday.  My mom and I moved all of my stuff from my room into the cars and then from the cars into my house all by ourselves.  Yeah.  We're buff.  David didn't work Monday night, so he spent the whole night at my house.  It was fabulous.

Tuesday was the best flippin day I've had in a long time.  I woke up next to David, which is always amazing.  I cleaned my room, which was much needed, so I felt great to be able to move around and not have crap all over the place.  I had a job interview, and little did I know that I had the job before I even went in to interview - it was merely a formality.  So I will be working as a day camp counselor at the Ely Lutheran Church this summer.  Good times.  I have to get another job, but it's ok.  At least I know I have this one.  As I left my interview one of my favorite Jars of Clay songs was playing on the radio, and there were FIVE hot air balloons flying above Cedar Rapids.  For those of you who don't know...I am flippin obsessed with hot air balloons.  I drove right under one, and four of them flew over my house.  Wow.  That was awesome.  When I got home I talked to my neighbor Laurel for a half an hour about prom, school, and other stuff.  I like her!  David came over after work, and we hung out for a while.  He had some homework to do, and he worked on that until we went to pick up the Kamster from musical practice.  She had a horrible day, so Antwon, David and I kidnapped her and took her to Steak N Shake to make her feel better.  It was so fun.

Wednesday I was woken up by my mom at 9:00 asking me if I wanted to go look at a new car.  I've had my old car for four years, and it was just to the point that I needed a new one.  I really didn't want to give it up, though, becuase it was purple, and I really liked it.  But as I walked onto the car lot to look at the car my mom had heard about, I knew that I had to get it right away.  It was purple!  So I spent the whole day working on getting my new car, and I am now the proud owner of a 1995 Buick Skylark.  Yup.  I'm hot.

Wednesday night was also senior presentations.  I went to Lacey's, and it was fabulous.  She played a couple songs that she wrote, and talked about a bunch of stuff that I was a part of.  It was awesome.  I also went to David's.  He was so worried about it being boring, but I laughed the whole time.  He also gave me a special thank you at the end, and I felt really loved.  After those were done, Galvin, Lacey, Leslie, David and I went to Steak N Shake (second night in a row) to hang out.  I miss them!  I am so glad to be home for the summer so that I can see them all.

David didn't have to go to school until nearly 10 on Thursday, so we got to sleep in a little, which was nice.  Of course I went back to bed after he left, and I didn't get up until 1:45.  Oops.  I guess I needed it, though.  Then I got up and bummed around.  He came over after school, but since we got into a fight the night before we didn't get much sleep, so he took a long nap.  I made dinner for the family (Andrew and David included), and I was pretty proud of myself.  Then David and I went on a date to the high school musical ""Into The Woods.""  It was so good!  Kamster and Lacey rock my socks!!  Evelyn did a fabulous job as Cinderella, and as much as I hate to admit it, Ryan Foizey and Jared Bourne played the princes extremely well.  It was a good time.  After the show most of the cast went out to Perkin's.  I sat with David, Antwon, Marcus, and little Joe.  Good times.

Today hasn't been too exciting.  I went back to bed after David left for school, and was woken up at 11:45 by Ms. Hofmockel calling to ask me if I would be a guest speaker at the NHS meeting next Thursday.  Good times.  So I finally got up and made myself some pizza, showered, packed, and what not.  David came over after school and we watched Pocahontas and bummed around for a while.  I left around 4:15 and drove back to Culver for baccalauratte (however you spell that) tonight.  Concert Choir sang a couple songs.  Woo.  Afterwards Rosie, Tim, and I headed into Quincy to eat at, where else, Steak N Shake (that's the fourth time in one week if anyone is counting).  Then we went to Wal-Mart for a little while.  And now I'm sitting in the chapter room utilizing the fast internet and waiting for David to give me a call after he's done eating.  Yup.  

Graduation is tomorrow morning, and then I'm heading back home.  I love it here, but I'm really ready to be home for a while, and I'm glad that I don't have to make the trek back here for a while.  But I am enjoying the time that I'm here.  And with that, I'm out.

Good night."

I got up and went to church this morning.  I love church.  Then I came back and cleaned the kitchen.  Blah.  I hate washing dishes, especially when they are someone else's.  But I did it.  It was worth it.

I took a 3 hour nap today.  It was so wonderful.  Then I got up and finished up packing my stuff.  I'm going home tomorrow!  WOO HOO!

My mom came tonight, and it's so exciting.  I love spending time with her, especially on Mother's Day.  

We went to night church tonight, and that was way fun.  Then we all came back here and us girls made dinner for the church families.  Yay!  I love families, and it was so great to spend some more time with them before we all go home for the summer.

I talked to David for a little while tonight.  He had a long day at work and has to get up at 4 tomorrow to be on the news!  Yeah.  He's awesome.  I know.  You're all jealous.

Then rest of the night has been spent hanging out with my mom.  Just talking and having a grand ole time.  I love her.  And now we're all heading to bed because I have a final in 7 1/2 hours, and then I'm going home!!  YEAH!!

"event","I had three finals today.  Blah.

8 AM for Acting lasted 15 minutes.  Good times.  Then I came back and took a shower and watched cartoons for an hour and a half.

10:30 for Philosophy of Religion wasn't too bad.  Two essay questions.  Took 45 minutes.  Good stuff.  Lunch was alright.  Nothing special.  The time between lunch and my next final was spent talking to David and watching Sister Act II.  I love that movie.  2 for Writing and Lit lasted 15 minutes.  Definitely have an A in there.  Good stuff.

After that I spent the afternoon talking to David.  I love him so much.  Even though we don't have anything special to talk about it's great to just have him on the other line to be there.  I adore him.  I can't wait to see him.

So tonight was a way lot of fun.  We went into Steak N Shake in Quincy for Jill's birthday celebration.  It was me, Jill, Abbey, Carissa, Jenny, Mike, Kyle, and Dave.  Fun stuff.  After eating we went to Wal-Mart and bummed around for a while.  When we were on our way back to campus Abbey got a phone call from one of her friends inviting her to a bon-fire at home, so Abbey, Carissa, and I decided to take a road trip to Camp Point to meet Abbey's friends and family.  That was way fun.  The drive was just as fun as the time there.  So much fun.  I adore these girls.  Then we came back to campus and got Heather Scott, and the four of us headed to the Wheeler.  Heather and Carissa lost their Wheeler virginity, and I was so proud to be there for it.  As we were finishing up Bree, Charlie, Mat, Katie P, Tony, Holly, Walcott, and some others came in because Willy got back tonight from London.  That was nice to see her and to chat with the peeps for a while.

So now I'm back here.  I talked to David for a little while, and he had a great night at work, which was great.  He has to work ALL DAY tomorrow, so I won't get to chat with him very much at all tomorrow.  My mom's coming tomorrow night, and I'm way pumped for that!  I love her!!  

And now I'm heading to bed, because I am exhausted!!

Good night.

"event","I got up for my Greek final this morning, which I think actually went pretty well.  I had to write an essay from a question that Dr. Long posed on a previously written essay, and then write an Aristotelian analysis of the essay that I wrote in class.  I was pretty worried about it, but I think I did a good job.  I'm not too worried about it anymore.  And that was my toughest final, so now that that's out of the way, the rest of final week will be a breeze!

I came back here and attempted to work on my take home final for Leadership, but got distracted by the latest episode of Gilmore Girls.  Great show.  So I worked on it for a while, watched the show, headed to lunch, and gave a tour for a guy from Cedar Rapids.  That was fun.

I came back and finished the take home exam, and then headed down to Kyle's room to watch The Great Escape with him and Mike.  After that I headed to dinner and worked on my paper for the movie.

Rosie, Tim, Nicole and I went down to Canton High to watch the grand march for their prom tonight.  We went out to support Melissa and Sid, but ended up seeing a lot of people that we know from church.  We also saw Danny Prebe and his girlfriend, which was fun!

After that I came back here and finished up my paper while talking to David, watching the 8th season of Friends, and the movie Shag.  Good stuff.  I did finally get the paper done, so now I am done with everything except attending finals!  WOO HOO!!

David and I spent a long time talking tonight, and it was wonderful as usual.  I can never get enough of that boy.  Dang I love him.  And I can't wait until Monday when I get to see him!

So now that my stress level has dropped 1234085% (that's an exaggeration because it really wasn't that high to begin with) I am heading off to bed to sleep before me three finals tomorrow.  Acting at 8 AM, Philosophy of Religion at 10:30, and Writing and Lit at 2.  Yeah.

Good night.

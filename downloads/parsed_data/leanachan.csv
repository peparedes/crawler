I just want to say that:
A) I'm NOT dead
B) I still play the cello
C) I still answer to the name Leana =D=D

I've been so incredibly busy since I started college. I play the cello all the time. I played for six hours today. It was craziness. Actually, I'm on my extended break now because DePaul is insane and is on trimesters. So I don't have to go to school until January 2... that's 2007, my friends!! So I'm home for a while. I actually like school better, much better. Living in my house is stressful... and my break started off uber suckily because I got a kidney stone, and then I had to have emergency surgery last week and NOW I have a kidney infection and other various kidney problems... so, by doctor's orders, I get to lay around the house all day and move as little as I possibly can. Well, I figure playing the cello isn't THAT much movement (hahaha). So yeah, that's been my break so far. I can't promise I'll write in here more, but I will do my very best to try! It's fun to go back and read some of my entries, they're pretty hilarious. I was such a funny kid, haha. I'm actually getting the tube that's holding my kidneys together taken out tomorrow, so hopefully that will help with the pain, and I'll be able to run around like Super Crazy Girl again! Yaaaay! I hope everyone has been doing well during my nearly three-year livejournal absence. Except for the occasional kidney stone and a couple other wacked out problems, my life hasn't been so bad. =) OK, with that said, I'm off. TTYL~"

Ok, so not really. I have a crapload of stuff to do today, like, hmmm, finish my research paper on benefits of music in schools, all my precalc homework (a lot), and I have to do a physics lab, a physics PRElab, and a physics concept development (stupid physucks).... plus try and practice my butt off AND go to church. Maybe I should skip church... but incase I can't, I should get writing my paper and get off line, especially because my mom is with my grandpa in the hospital and she might be trying to call... 

OHHHHH but Turnabout was last night, and I went last-minute. I called Gilmer and was like ""Yeah, lets go to Turnabout in, um, 2.5 hours"" and he said ok! so yay! We went with Laura, Stefan, and Sam as SUPER NERDS (!!!) and we made these awesome shirts.... Man, if I can ever make my pictures work on this LJ, I'll take a picture of me wearing it and post it, because they are the coolest shirts ever. haha. Yeah.

so yeah, have a good day everyone!"

"event","Hiiiii!!!

I know it's been forever and I'm sorry I don't have time to write more, but I just wanted to start writing again. I have a real journal, and trust me, I AMMMMM writing in that, because it's handy because it's with me all the time, you know? So every time I think of something I can just jot it down. It's pretty nice... But yeah! I'm doing pretty ok lately. I've had lots of cello fun lately, like, last week, I only went to school for 1.5 days, the rest of it was mainly spent on cello-related things. Like String Day at NIU and the KSO Children's concert yesterday. Then, Gillian and I went to her house and watched some FRIENDS before returning to school 6th hour... hahaha, I'm truly a truant. 

I have nothing to do today (except possibly record our Beethoven Quartet for Allerton IFFF Kassi ever calls me back...) so I'm looking forward to much cello time to spend on the Haydn D (yaaaay!) I also got the Hindemith Sonata in the mail the other day, so I want to maybe try and learn a movement or two of that today maybe. At any rate, I'm excited. I just got done with my 2ish mile tread-mill run. Usually on weekends I run farther than that, but SHEESH, running on a tread mill is SO boring, I hate it. Even with the TV on, it's just so much better to run outside in the air. It's opener there, in the wide open air..... haha

I think I'm going to shower now, as I'm very sweaty and gross. Have a good Saturday everyone!"

HellenCello: oh, hi!
HappyG125: so hellen
HappyG125: did you have fun last night
HappyG125: ?
HellenCello: well, yeah
HellenCello: I was kinda mad at everyone (except you) at the end of the night
HappyG125: yeah i could kinda tell
HellenCello: that's not why I went home though
HellenCello: I just had to get home
HappyG125: well thats good
HellenCello: I did rant to myself quite a bit on the way home
HappyG125: im glad you didnt leave in anger
HappyG125: lol
HellenCello: well, I did
HellenCello: I guess that was part of the reason
HellenCello: I didn't think I could handle acting presentable much longer, lol
HappyG125: lol 
HappyG125: i dont know what the deal with everyone was
HellenCello: I mean, I know I should be able to handle stuff like that
HellenCello: but sometimes I get so down
HellenCello: because I have a hard enough time feeling accepted by people our age as it is
HappyG125: yeah 
HellenCello: so when things like that happen it just points out to me that, basically, since I can't take jokes well and I act in general idiotic all the time that I'm just not a good socializer and it just makes me mad at everyone
HellenCello: and reminds me of how well I get along with adults
HellenCello: but how adults treat me like a kid
HellenCello: so basically, except for a select few people, I'm in my own little world all by myself
HappyG125: well the good news is that if youre right
HappyG125: you wont be a teenager forever
HellenCello: I kno
HellenCello: *know
HellenCello: but it just sucks now
HellenCello: because only a few people understand
HellenCello: one being you
HellenCello: and Sarah does
HellenCello: Sam does
HellenCello: I think esme does sometimes
HellenCello: everyone else doesn't really get me though
HellenCello: I mean, maybe you guys don't get me either
HellenCello: but at least you are my friend, and that means a whole lot to me
HappyG125: glad to be it too
HellenCello: thanks
HellenCello: do you kinda see why that makes me mad though?
HappyG125: i definatley see your side of everything
HellenCello: I mean, I work so hard to try and fit in as a high school kid, but I just can't honestly do it, because my mind isn't wired that way
HellenCello: I'm either 12 or 20
HellenCello: and actually
HellenCello: i think I'm really  more like 20
HellenCello: and I just act 12 because I'm not sure how else to act when I'm in big groups and stuff
HappyG125: yeah i get it
HappyG125: its soo weird
HellenCello: argh, when will people grow up??
HappyG125: i dunno
HellenCello: It's just like the whole thing with Alex too
HellenCello: I mean, he gets to the point where he thinks he is too mature to hang out with us
HellenCello: but D'OH
HellenCello: HE'S acting 16
HellenCello: because, well, he is
HappyG125: seriously hellen i think youre the most mature teenager i know
HappyG125: you just have this knowing
HappyG125: of all things 
HellenCello: psh
HellenCello: not really
HappyG125: no seriously
HappyG125: you just can put things in perpsective
HellenCello: yes, but that does me no good at the age of 17!
HellenCello: it just makes everyone either a) really scared of me or b) just not like me or c) not want to associate with me because they think I hate them
HellenCello: I see the C one the most
HellenCello: now I""ve figured it out
HellenCello: the reason that people don't really talk to me, like Cassie, Jessie Munz, even Stevie sometimes
HellenCello: and all those people I never got to know
HappyG125: ahh but also there is d) that would be me who is amazed by you
HappyG125: adn i think d is growing
HellenCello: lol, well, thanks
HellenCello: I'm not sure about that
HellenCello: I mean
HellenCello: it's not that I WANT to be different
HellenCello: I like how I am
HellenCello: I just want people to treat me normally
HellenCello: that's all
HellenCello: I don't want people to be scared to talk to me
HellenCello: or basically treat me really different
HellenCello: just like last night
HellenCello: I mean, you'd think they're realize how hard it is for me already
HellenCello: but they don't
HellenCello: that's the problem
HellenCello: people don't THINK
HappyG125: true dat
HappyG125: i think collectivly people are quite dumb
HellenCello: yup
HellenCello: ditttooooed
HellenCello: it's kinda cool to understand things that no one else does
HellenCello: it makes you laugh sometimes
HellenCello: like now
HellenCello: I'm not really mad about it anymore
HellenCello: but I was pretty mad last night
HellenCello: people were like ""smack him!"" and stuff
HellenCello: but honestly
HellenCello: that's not what I wanted to do
HellenCello: I wanted to say what I just said now
HellenCello: but I knew no one (except you) would understand
HellenCello: and then I'd never have a change at having friends
HellenCello: *chance
HappyG125: lol
HellenCello: *sigh* 
HellenCello: I'm done
HellenCello: that was a good rant
HellenCello: a really good rant
HellenCello: thanks for listening
HappyG125: no problem
HappyG125: anytime

"event","I wish I could have updated earlier this week, but I just didn't have time. MAN has it been a crammed week. I hate it when things work out this way. It ended up, by Thursday, that I had a lab due Friday, a paper due Friday, my precalc test on Friday, Madrigal performance on Friday, my recital (with Rococo Variations) on Saturday, a concert on Saturday, and a big gig with the cello group on Sunday. Wow. What do you do when that happens? I couldn't possibly do all of it to the best of my ability! I only had one ngiht to do everything, to prepare for everything!! So I had to make some decisions, I guess some weren't the best decisions I've made. My lab went ok, I think. My paper, eh, coulda been better. My test was terrible. Madrigals went alright, my recital was pretty great, and the concert last night was alright as well, all though I could have used more time on all the stuff. I guess that's just how life is though, right? There's never enough time for anything. I wonder how I'm supposed to get out and LIVE my life when I don't even have time to take care of the things I need to do...

I'm not looking forward to next week, when the results of my schoolwork I did on Thursday night come back. The test is going to be horrific, I'm preparing myself for it now. It's not like I didn't study either, I did. Just, I was so tired when I was studying (it was pretty late by the time I got to precalc). I guess I have to learn to put some of these bad things behind me. I mean, sure, it's good to get good grades and all, but aren't there really more important things in life? Cello is important to me. Out of everything (except for my friends) it ranks number one, so shouldn't I work hardest to succeed at that? It's not like I'm blowing off school or anything; I'm third in my class! But I probably won't be for long, I have a feeling, and then my dad will get mad. Class rank doesn't matter so much to me, ok, it doesn't. Sure staying in the top 3 would be cool, but I won't be that bummed if I'm not. I know what my talents are and what really matters to me, so no one (except my dad) would really care that much anyways. But my dad would care. He always cares about stuff like that, then goes off on me about not being good enough. I hate that about him, how he thinks of me as such a robot and not a person. I wish he'd lay off sometimes and just let me do my thing. I think he'd be surprised how well I'd do, even if everything ISN'T perfect.

Well, today is my favorite performance of the whole year, when the cello ensemble plays at Ellwood house, with the great arrangements Linc does for us. I even made an arrangement this year, of Yesterday by the Beatles, and we're going to play it today! Yay! That's pretty exciting, I think. So I'm going to get ready for that. Have a good next week, mine should be much better (hopefully). Later~"

I just played the second movement of the Francoeur Sonata not only UP TO TEMPO, but ABOVE TEMPO! 152!!! Sweeeeeeet. I was just reading in this book put out for preteen girls by American Girl about emotions, and it was pretty funny. The authors were talking about how you can go from feeling one emotion to another in a matter of seconds. This certainly is a crazy time of life! One of the activities was to circle every emotion on a list that you've felt in the past few days. I circled ALL of them, and it was a big list too. A good couple of pages at least. hehe. I feel very accomplished just now, but nervous at the same time. I've got a HUGE week coming up and I need to do well!! I MUST DO WELL! Madrigals are at the end of the week, rehearsals, my big huge chapter 2 precalc test on Friday, my recital on Saturday, Kish Concert Saturday night, Ellwood House on Sunday.... whew, it's quite a bit going on. I wanted to either go to Pub Quiz with the rents on Tuesday or maybe to go church (for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception) but I don't believe that I'm going to have time to do either. Oh well. 


oooooh I think dad might make some banana shakes. That would make me happy. I think I'll make him now. ahhh zut, nevermind. We don't have any ice-cream. Darn it. Oh well, maybe I'll hit the cello hard again, see how much more I can squeeze into one night. yay. I hope everyone has a good week, I'll be plowing through mine.... until then~"

"event","bit of a short one tonight. I just noticed somethings today, pretty cool actually.


Ben is hilarious (he is the kid I baby-sit for). We were practicing his pieces tonight after their dinner and he would play his piece, and then he would start talking again, but about the randomest things! It was a little annoying to me at first, since this isn't typically how I go about practice (taking a lot of breaks, etc.), but I started to listen to some of the things he was talking about... He asked me (right after he finished Humeresque) ""Why does Sponge-bob have a hairy chest if he's a sponge?"" What do you say to that? What an insightful question. He pays such close attention to detail; it's amazing, really. Another thing is about the snowflakes. I know I wrote last year about how I almost burned their house down. But when I had them outside while I was waiting for the smoke to clear out, Ben was in the back yard and he saw the light reflecting on the newly fallen snow. He shouted out to me and Genna - ""Look at the patterns!"" He was so taken by the shapes of the snowflakes. Then, tonight, he reminded me of that time last year, and he said ""You know what's so cool about snowflakes is they're all different, and no matter what, you'll never find the same two that are the same!"" *jaw drops* wow. What an amazing conclusion for a 7-year-old to come to. I asked him if he could think of anything else that was like a snowflake. He thought for a while, but then became distracted. I told him people. People are like snowflakes. There's billions of us but there's no two people that have the same pattern. That's why people are cool all different and stuff. Because our patterns are different. That's what makes us pretty.

I just thought that was so great. It made my day. Thanks Ben! Have a nice weekend everyone!"

the weekend basically sucked. it was ok, I guess, I mean, there were a few good things, but for the most part, I'm glad to be going to school this week. I guess most of it started yesterday at Barnes and Noble, which really basically screwed up my weekend, but I guess it really shouldn't have. See, I messed up ONE note in the Van Goens Scherzo, just one note. And I got so mad afterward, but after thinking about it for a long time, I realized that it's so stupid of me to get upset over something like that. It really hit me when I was talking to Linc on the phone tonight and I told him that I had basically been brooding over it all of last night, and he gave me one of those HELLEN sort of comments. ""Hellen, <i>that</i> doesn't matter! You played great!"" He's such a great teacher. Really.

I ran this morning and yesterday morning as well. 2 miles yesterday, and a little over a mile today. It's not great, I know, but hey, I'm trying to get in shape for the turkey run. I managed to get in 4.5 hours of practicing today, plus finishing all my homework, plus playing cards at grandmas, PLUS playing in a gig. Whew. And I still have time to do fun things and it's only 9:30. Some days I can be so efficient. Really. It's kind of scary. I'm not sure how I do it.

The gig today was fascinating. My sister just started playing viola last week, and she gigged with me and David and Gillian today, and she did great. Simply outstanding, I mean, she's the best violist I've ever had, AND she's only 13 AND she just started playing last week! I'm so excited about what she's going to become in the next few years. By next year, when she hits high school, she's gonna be one kickin violist. I'm so excited. She's pretty excited too. It's so cool for her to play with me in gigs, I guess she thinks of it as some amazing feat and all her friends are really impressed that she's playing stuff with me. Wow, I feel so old! I guess I am pretty old now, I'm an upperclassman! Woot! =) Hard to believe it, really. Ohhhh, and the best part of the gig was that they fed us after we played! It was another free gig, zut I hate free gigs, but at least they gave us basically all-you-can-eat. yay!

I was listening to 90.5 tonight, and I was so amazed at myself. I was able to identify a piece that I had never ever heard before. I knew it was the Brahms Clarient Quintet in b minor, without having ever heard it before. 

SIMPSONS!! NOW!!! until later~"

"event","Have you ever looked, I mean, really looked into someone's eyes? 


I didn't start doing this until recently, but eyes can say so much about a person. I'm not exactly sure what it is I see in them, but they can almost tell me everything about someone before even speaking with them. I've wondered about this lately. I was discussing the book The Catcher in the Rye with a friend today, and when I said that I was a lot like the main character Holden in the way I think, he was very surprised by my saying that. He asked me if I judged people before I knew them, before I took the chance to talk to them and really find out who they are. I'm not so sure if I do or not. I'm nice to everyone, until they give me a worthwhile reason to dislike them. But as far as judging goes... The older I get, the more I discover about the human race in general, and the different people in it. I can tell if a person will be nice to me or not, even before they are. This doesn't stop me from being nice to them, but I know in the back of my brain that I am not (or are) going to get along with them. It's like the 4th graders that I teach. Sometimes I look at all of them and wonder, who is the Paul Blahnik of their grade? Who is the Lauren Diehl, the Kyle Schultz, the Chris Minert, the Rachel Olson? I know it's not a very nice thing to think, but you can kind of just tell, by how the kid acts, how they play, even how they sit can tell me things about who they are. Am I saying people can't change? no, I'm not saying that at all, which is why I am still open to all people, regardless of what my first impressions are of them. I actually think it's pretty cool how you can tell so much about a person just by how they act. Not even what they say or write or anything. Actions really speak loudly. 

I've just been realizing so much lately, observing so much. Some of the saddest things I've seen in a long time take place in my school every day. The cliques, the rumors, the brand-names, the advertising, the ignorance, the HATE. The people who give up on their chance, who give up on the most wonderful gift a person can be given. The people who say ""forget it! screw high school, screw life."" and then stop trying. I've been feeling real lucky lately to be just the age I am right now. Being 17 is really cool. I'm walking a fine line, this year. Being a kid and being an adult, even more so than last year. My final moments and time of being in high school are ticking away; I'm trying to savor them. Truth is, however screwed up it is most of the time, I like being 17 and I'm glad that I am just like I am. I read a letter in Dear Abby the other day, from a 13-year-old asking when the ""fun times of teenage life would come"". She said: ""I've been a teen for about 3 months, and there's no fun in this at all! I'm usually depressed, confused, and not having all that much fun. When will the good times come?"" Well, my answer to that is, well, they're here! The fun times are those times between the tests you bomb, the friends that screw you over, and the cello competitions you don't quite win. It's the times when you laugh, the times when you're not doing homework, and the times where you look up at the sky and say thank you GOD for putting me here. It can seem like the fun times aren't around a whole lot, but if you look hard enough, sure they are. You bet they are. *shrug* I'm finding these times pretty fun.

I haven't written in so very long, I know, but don't think it's because I haven't had things to say. Quite the contrary, actually. I keep trying to think of the perfect adjective to describe my life lately, and I just can't seem to think of one. I think, I think my life must be like running on a treadmill, but when it is set just a little bit too fast for you to run comfortably on it, so you're keeping up, but sometimes you get a little tired and slide back a ways. Yup, that's pretty good. That's about how it's going right now.

So, news! I got myself second (well, basically tied for first) place in the RAYSO Concerto Competition! yay! This means I get to perform Rococo with that orchestra in June. I'm very excited, Rococo is so fun (and HAAAARD) but fun too! It's worth the hard-ness for the fun-ness. =) I'm working on Francoeur, it's coming along better every night, I suppose. Quarter = 150 is SOOOOO very fast, but I guess I can do it. It'll just take me a little longer than most things have been taking me lately.

I've been mixing myself up quite a lot lately, the whole idea of not being sure what I should do, what I want, etc. Most of it started at the orchestra concert in early October. That was the one where we sounded HORRIBLE, and I accidentally let my feelings slip a little. I wasn't laughing HARD or LOUD or even that badly... but I was still laughing. Tonaki is really mad at me now. I mean, everything I do/say, he seems to contradict. He treats me like I think I'm better than everyone else, which is not true!! I don't think that at all. I'm a firm believer in the idea that everyone does some things better than other people. I'm no exception to this rule. Even put with people who I basically play better than, they still can do things, I'm sure of it, that I would struggle with. I don't know, I don't think I'm an arrogant snobby person... I try my hardest not to be. Oh well. Whatever, I guess what Tonaki thinks doesn't have to matter to me. My classmates aren't at all offended, so I guess it's all good.

Ohhhh, I had another medical emergency Tuesday. I went to the ER during school, I thought it was my other kidney stone moving, but it wasn't... it was something called an ovarian cyst (sp?). and it HURT. Yeah. That's all about that. 

I'm talking to a few friends now on IM, so I'll let you go for now. Lesson tomorrow, yaaaay. I hope Linc is happy with all the work I did on Francoeur this week. I'll keep trying to update more. Until then, all~"

"event","Allerton was AWWWESOME!!! I don't feel like typing the WHOLE thing, but lets just say awesome coachings, and good bonding time with my friends. :-) It was just what I needed.

Life's been eventful. But my REAL journal has been keeping up with that.

Lots of cello work tonight on Bach. I need to play a gig for, eh, 1.5 hours on Thursday, ALL of unaccompanied Bach. So I learned 7 movements tonight of various suites... it's a lot to cram, and I really hate cramming like this. I'll have to go back and learn them the right way later.

Ok, time to head. Later!"

"event","ok, this may not be a pleasant rant, and it involves many aspects of religion and my views on the world. So I hope I don't offend anyone. Thank you.


OK! For the first time in my life, I went to church tonight and I UNDERSTOOD the homily. I understood every single word, and I cried. And I just don't understand people. I just don't understand them. How people can hurt. How people can kill. How people can do these things TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS!! How people can think they are SO INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL that they are better than someone else? What makes people think that just because of some material possesion, family order and family name in general, that they can classify themselves as a ""higher"" class? Father was talking tonight about washing other people's feet. About how Jesus came to the earth to help other people! He came not to be served, but to serve, which is what each person should come here on this earth to do. To SERVE. People care too much about themselves. We need to start caring about other people, and realizing exactly how easy and simple our lives are when some people are dying of starvation and disease and terrible things, every second. And all we care about sometimes are material possessions, or our reputations. Screw reputations! Get down on the floor and scrub. That's what we're here for! 

This probably wouldn't have effected me so much had I not witnessed it, in my very own church. People downsizing other people; people cliquing together and keeping others out. Jesus' goal for the world was to have no cliques. To have everyone equal, to LOVE ONE ANOTHER and help everyone else before yourself. But there are these cliques in church too. Maybe not as prominent, but they still exist. So, my question is, if there is still casting away IN CHURCH, how will we ever manage peace in the WHOLE WORLD??? My church is a tiny building, in a tiny town, in a little state, in a powerful country, in a huge world. If WE can't manage true peace, how the heck is our world going to achieve it? People these days are so caught up in commercial things and their own little lives, they forget about the big picture. About our WORLD. We are just the little people IN the world. We are not the CENTER of it, by any means, and no single person is the center of the world. No person is worthy to be the center. No person is better than another. I know communism tried to solve this problem before. But we need more than a central government to solve it. We don't NEED a LEADER. We just need PEOPLE to cooperate, help, and love. We can totally keep the government out of it. We just need people to get down on their knees and start to serve others. My question is this. What can one person do about it? What can 3 people? or 5, or 100? A million? 2 billion? It's not enough. We need everyone. And tell me, my friends, when will EVERYONE agree? 

I could go into more, but I won't. I think this states my thoughts quite well now. 


All you need is love..... all you need is love.... all you need is love, love. Love is all you need...."

lets see. Last update was making the tape for Allerton? Haha! We got IN to Allerton! Yahoo!!! April 23, my babies (as Nat says)! I'm very excited for that.

I'm high off of orchestra rehearsal. Kish was tonight. I LOVE playing Scherezade. It's so thrilling and it just makes me want to run around. It was a really fun rehearsal night.

Lets see, what else. I got into the Valade Program at Interlochen (yesss!) so I get to study with Eric Kim (Principal Cellist of the Cincinnati Symphony) and Mr. Bjella, when Mr. Kim isn't on campus. Sweet. The 2 best teachers at the camp. I'm so excited!!! I also talked to Morgen today, who got into Juilliard! YAY for Morgen! :-D

Spring Break this week!! That's why I can stay up late and type things in my journal, because I don't really have much to do during the days, except tomorrow morning, I have a lesson at 10AM, which still feels like 9AM because of the time change. So I might actually have to set an alarm, to make sure I don't sleep till 9:30 or so (which still kind of feels like 8:30, which isn't out of my sleeping range)... and that made no sense. But yeah. 

Well, I might actually want to pay a little attention in my lesson tomorrow morning, so I should probably head to bed, then I won't sleep through it. Ahhhh, gotta love spring break! :-) A sign of summer's approach, which means Interlochen, and another round of Hellen Heaven. I can't wait! Everyone, have a good night!"

"event","I have this annoying cut on my lip. One of those ones that runs down the skin, so every time it starts to heal, I forget it's there, and I accidentally pull on in, and it rips the skin down and I start to bleed again, and it starts all over. Grr..

Tonaki informed us this morning 2 minutes after orchestra class started that we're making a quick, random recording for Allerton that's, heh, due in like 2 days! Apparently, when Nat transferred the tape to CD, it screwd up somehow, so we had to make one today, or we wouldn't get in. I didn't have my cello with me today, it was the crap school cello and the crap school cello BOW, which is even worse... but we did our runs anyways. We recorded 25 minutes and 7 seconds worth of stuff, and I'll tell you about the takes. The first one was not good for me at all. I hadn't played a note on a cello all day, plus it was 8:30 in the morning and I was on a school cello that I hadn't played on in over 2 weeks. The neck is shaped slightly different, which makes shifting just a little different, and it always takes me time to adjust. So the first take was just blah, because I hadn't adjusted quite yet. It was all out of tune; I couldn't even believe it was me playing. That just got me more down, that I had messed everyone up so by playing out of tune... so it didn't help our second take much. It was slightly improved by all of us, greatly improved from my standpoint. There were minor technical errors from all 4 of us, but it was overall the most intune of our three hacks. After our second take, we had 10 minutes left in the period. The four of us just sat there and stared at each other. Nat asked if we wanted to try again, or if we should just not bother. We had lost everything we had in it last week. All that great joy, and passion that we had developed was gone, and we just weren't getting the same musical feeling. I said we should try again, just for the heck of it. Why not, right? But this time, maybe not be so careful. Not play like it was our last chance to get this right or we would miss the deadline, just play. This became known as our ""just screw-it"" take. And we played it. We were all pretty bummed after the period. The last take had been the most out of tune of them for the other three, but it was my personal best. I grinned all the way through it and really enjoyed myself, and I played with my quartet, I really PLAYED with them. And you know what happened?

Nat, Kassi, and I went into Tonaki's office right after school to find out the verdict of our CD. Tonaki had said he would listen to the three takes, pick one, and send it overnight tonight. He told me that he picked the third take without hesitation. He said he had no words to describe how amazing we sounded. He put the CD in the player and told us to just listen. We heard the first take. Yuck, gross, out of tune.... but ok. Then we heard a part of the second. Better, and there was even more feeling. But the third... the passion, the feeling was so enormous I didn't even NOTICE intonation. I didn't NOTICE. And for me to not notice something like intonation is a wonder of the world, because that's usually all I concentrate on. From the very first note, the sound was warm, laid-back, and well, for lack of a better term, ""screw-it""! I was so excited. We did it, we made a really good take, and we might actually have another shot at getting into Allerton this year. Yay us!

So I did learn something from today. How your performance sounds really is based on how you're thinking and feeling, and what you WANT out of it. You can't be too careful when playing, even for a recording. Because, when you're careful, you're going to make mistakes anyways. So you might as well just make them, but play while you're doing it. 

So! That was the exciting part of my day. I had a lesson after school. Played the Brahms for Linc, he was quite happy with it. And he gave me some tips on fixing my intonation (even though he insists there's nothing really wrong with it). So I practiced very productively tonight, I was very happy with myself.

Ok, enough about me. I'm going to go watch the Simpsons. I'm really glad today turned out good in the end. I love days like this. Days that prove that things can seem bad, but you never know what's in store for you later. I think I'm going to miss being a teenager when I'm older. It's such a good stage of life. I'm like NPR; I learn something new everyday, about life, I mean, besides school stuff. It's such an exciting time! Anyways. Time to head. Night everyone!"

"event","Sorry for totally NOT updating. Like I said before, I have a real journal now, like, one I keep in my purse. So I write in there a lot...


So.... what's new? With everyone, I mean. I've been pretty busy lately, really busy actually. I did play my Saint-Saens with orchestra, and it was one of the best performances of my life, I kid you not. It was amazing that I could pull something like that off, I think, because I was so nervous. But I did. So that's what matters. Then, I had Mendelssohn Club Competition. I placed 5th, which, eh, isn't too bad. I won $125 for that, which is REALLY nice! :-D Then, I played Solo-Ensemble the next weekend, I got best of day again. It's actually a pretty funny story; the lights kept flickering on and off in the auditorium while I was playing, which is probably why I ended up winning, just because I closed my eyes and played. But I play solo Bach in the dark sometimes anyways, so yeah...

My school quartet made our Allerton recording. It actually isn't too bad; we might have a shot again. Nat took the tape last night and he said he would give it to his friend to put on a CD, then we'll over-night it tomorrow or something. 

School... has been blah-ish. I mean, my grades are still OK, all A's... but lower A's than normal. And I'm totally blowing off everything and saving it all till the last minute. I wonder if it's senioritis already? I dunno, but I wish I could stop this horrible laziness I've been having lately. It's really quite pathetic. I did kinda bad on a chemistry quiz... so I went in this morning early and I retook it, just because I felt so guilty all night last night because I did so bad and I didn't understand, and Mr. Scharlau gave me all the points back after I retook it (THANK YOU MR. SCHARLAU!!) so that should be good.

Laura, Sarah, and I are thinking of starting a band!!! Actually, we're pretty sure we're GOING to start the band, and this isn't any cello-band! This is my first non-cello music related thing. Yeaaaaah. I'm stepping outta the shallow end, and into the 4 foot waters... hehehehe.

There was little kid orchestra today, and we had not one, but TWO kids throw-up. I couldn't believe it, it was absolutely disgusting. The first girl made the toilet, and the second girl threw up, but kept it all in her mouth, and Alicia saw that she was holding it all in there, and grabs her and RUNS to the garbage can and just held her there and waited for her to finish. Alicia's brave. I dunno if I would have courage to do that; throwing up kids kind of scare me. But I guess if I'm going to have kids when I grow up I should get used to it. It's just every time I imagine myself with my children, I always imagine nothing will go wrong, which I know is untrue... but I can dream, can't I?

Ok, it's almost time for the Simpsons, my daily dose of comic relief, which I need by 10PM. Then sleep. ahhh. Tomorrow, we get to sight-read the Thomas-Tallis in orchestra, yay. I can't wait, I'm so excited for that piece. What fun. I'll talk to everyone later!"

I practiced cello for 2.5 hours this morning and early afternoon. 

Then I went out shopping on the town with Laura, Gillian, and Esme. We had SOOO much fun; we so need to do that more often! We went to a ton of places; Borders, Target, Old Navy, Salvation Army, Maurices, just to name a few. I didn't end up buying any clothes, just a bag of gummy worms for myself and Gillian, and then a separate one to send to Morgen, because her birthday is on Tuesday. It was an awesome afternoon, lots of fun.

Then I came home and ate pizza and played cello more. Then I just watched America's Funniest Videos with the family. Yup. That's all; that was my Saturday.

All-State was the BEEEESSST!!!! SOOO much fun. I was 7th chair honors, which is not bad for a sophomore in the state of Illinois. So I'm pretty happy! Playing in honors was so great, it was almost like Interlochen again. Not QUITE, but almost.

We got there on Wednesday after a crazy-long (3 hour) busride on the Happy Bus. it was crammed, and Nat and I had wrestling matches on the way down. It was very enjoyable! :-) Then we got to the hotel... ahhhh... it was a nice hotel, I must say. I mean, it wasn't paradise or anything, but compared to some of the hotels I've experienced, it was nice. Our rehearsals were conviniently (sp) located in the same hotel, so all I had to do was wander downstairs from the second floor and head to rehearsal, it took a total of like 3 minutes. It was pretty sweet. I roomed with Kassi and Ruthie. They were pretty good room-mates. They cooperated most of the time, except when they almost wouldn't be quiet and turn out the lights when I had to get up the next morning at 530 and they didn't... but eventually they were quiet. Hanging out with everyone was fun. Being the only sophomore is always kind of nice too. It can be weird at first, but eventually people started to talk to me a lot, and I made lots of new friends, and got to know lots of people I didn't know too well, or at all, before this trip. It was really fun! The guys weren't allowed in the girl's rooms, and vice versa, so we had ""hallway parties"" at night, until midnight every night, so we could all hang out together. It was great fun. I'm not even going to go into all the stuff that we talked about/did, but it was just an amusing time overall.

OH! And the Syco Orchestra came down on Thursday to play our long-awaited performance for the ENTIRE bunch of music educators in the state of Illinois. BUT no pressure.... :-) It was actually a pretty nice performance. Tonaki told my parents that some of the people watching said the cello soli part in the Beethoven was the most enjoyable part of the entire performance. Woah. I thought we did well, but not THAT well.

Right, I'm going to go finish all my math homework that's all due tomorrow. Missing 2 days of school is rough, but definitely worth it. Ta-ta!"

I won my competition last weekend, you know, the one for Talent Scholarship? I got a good chunk of $$ for lessons and they gave me $50 for myself. Yaaay! :-) That's always nice. And I made my CD yesterday for Interlochen and various competitions, that was pretty nerve-racking leading up to it. But that's all over. And today after school was the school concerto competition. I didn't play as well as I would have liked, but I guess considering the circumstances (I barely warmed up), I didn't play too bad. I guess I'll find out, probably tomorrow or sometime. I'll let you know what happens.

Whatever it is... I don't think I've ever played a competition so strongly before. But the problem is, I don't think I will win, because the accompanist (AHHH!) RUSHED me! In the first presto section (Popper Hungarian Rhapsody), she just TOOK off, she didn't even give me a chance to mark the beats. She just played so darn fast. And I have all these 16th notes, and i can't PLAAAAY that fast! What did she think I was, a robot? I dunno. So I had to play as fast as my arm would allow me, and do some retakes at the ends of measures to keep up with her. But screw that part, the rest was quite nice. :-)

I've had heck of a past couple days.. David and I broke up... Cello hadn't been going too well... But it's coming back now! I'm feeling like I can play again, which is a nice feeling, TRUST me. It's nice to see a few parts of my life going back to normal.

I'm going to Gillian's house on Sunday night to sleepover. yeeeees. I haven't had a sleepover in SO long; it's been TOO long. I have 20 hours of FRIENDS episodes to watch... so we'd better get going!

I'm starting to feel happier. I AM happier. Today was a much better day, even though sooooo many things have gone wrong lately. Maybe I'm finally on my way out. :-D I'd like that. 

The Simpsons will be on in 20 minutes... I LOVE comic relief; don't know what I'd do without it. Yaaaay Simpsons.

We had dinner at Grandma's tonight. She made mashed potatoes and those yummy green beans in that mushroom soups stuff with the crunchy onions. I guess when you mix three foods I can't stand all together, it tastes pretty nice! That's seriously some of the best stuff out there. I love my grandparents. They're great. Then we played cards. Oh Heck, and then Apples-to-Apples, which is GREAT fun. Not to mention the wrestling match with Henry that left me black and blue in random spots on my arms and legs and stomach. Blaaah. Oh well, sometimes, you get beat up in life. But it's all good.

OK, I'm going to go get ready for bed; brush teeth and stuff. Then watch the Simpsons with dad. What a good way to spend a Friday night. I miss David, but hey, he's not TOTALLY gone, right? He's still one of my best friends. Just because we can't be in a relationship together doesn't mean I should hate him. Ok, good night everyone!"

"event","I got a letter in the mail today.... from myself! I wrote on June 24, at Interlochen, during ""cabin time."" My counsuler (Ans) said she would send the letters that we wrote to ourselves right before Christmas. I totally forgot about it, but my mom says ""Hellen, you have a letter addressed to Hellen, the COOLEST cello-girl out here... and it's from 'me'!"" I just laughed, opened it, and this is what it said:

<i>Hi Hellen!
It's Hellen, if you didn't get that, because since I'm you I knew you might not get it right away. I'm sitting here on the sun decker at Interlochen, and you are probably in school, 10th grade, and there's probably snow on the ground outside. I know between where I am and where you are, times might get rough, but you won't give up, because I didn't give up, ever. Me and you, we can do impossible things. I know, because we've done it. I played the Janacek Sinfonietta, and so did you, so lets keep it up. We can do anything! Maybe I'll catch up with you later. Until then!

Your lifelong friend,
Hellen

PS: Just remember, no orchestra music is hard next to the stuff I'M playing. No auditions are scary next to the ones I have to do. So just keep playing, because no matter what, you can do it. Promise.</i>


It's always nice to get letters like that in the mail... even if they are from myself. :-)

Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays everyone! Hope you all enjoy it!"

"event","Did any of you, in the course of growing up, get to a point, where you're just not sure? Like, you feel like a kid, but you're really sure you're not? And you want to be a grown-up, but you just don't feel right being one?

I had an incident today. I just got my lisence a few weeks ago, so the car needed some gas today, so after church, on my family's way home, we stopped at the gas station. Here's basically what happened:

Dad: Hellen, can you put gas in the car?

Hellen: YES! I've done it before! I really do, I can!

Dad: *evil look* Well then, if you're so clever, why don't you go and put it in, all on your own. *hands me the credit card, which, I've never used before EVER*

Hellen: ummm, ok... *goes out of the car and can't figure out how to get the gas cap off the side of the car*

Dad: *comes out of the car* It certainly LOOKS like you know what you're doing, Hellen. Read the directions. Can't you read?

Hellen: Yes, I can read!

Dad: I thought you said you could do this ALL BY YOURSELF?

Hellen: well... I can! Or... I could.... *works harder at getting the cap off* 

Dad: Well.... if you can't even get the CAP off... why don't you try paying for this?

Hellen: Dad, I don't know HOW to use a credit card! I don't HAVE a credit card; you never even let me TOUCH your credit card? How do you expect I would know how to use a credit card?

Dad: So... you CAN'T do this on your own, CAN you? What would you do if I wasn't here?

Hellen:..... I, I don't know... not get gas? I don't KNOW Dad! I'm sorry! I just don't know!!!


.... Aren't parents supposed to HELP me with things like this? I'm not sure what to think. I'm given all these responsibilities, but I don't have enough experience to deal with them? How do you gain experience with life? Doesn't it just take living? 

If I'm not a kid, and I'm not an adult, what am I?"

Schools out, yay!

But now I'm stuck in a house with my FAMILY for two whole weeks. I don't know what I'd do without my dear cello. It saves my life sometimes.

I learned to knit last week, and I started a scarf. It's very nice-looking, so far, for my first time, at least. I'm really excited about knitting more! It's lots of fun! I knitted some when I was baby-sitting Ben and Genna the other night, for SEVEN hours, but I also practiced in Linc's room for a while... I really love that room; the accoustics rock and it's so nice and private. It was 11:15 PM and I could still saw as loud as I wanted and no one would hear me. It was sweeeeet. :-)

I'm really tired lately, dunno why. I got 10 whole hours of sleep last night, and I'm still falling asleep randomly throughout the house. I wonder why. 

Well, this was just a practice break for me. I need to go run a few yicky spots in the Saint-Saens then work on Elgar 4th. Killer, it is. Talk to you all later!"

Bleck, I'm sick... I have yet another chest cold and I feel really icky this morning... and it stinks because I have a lot to do today and a lot to do this week. Between the concerto competition today, Madrigals all week, rehearsals all week, Kish Christmas concert, and my recital... wow, it's a lot. But! I GOT MY LICENSE!!!! HAHAHAHA!!!! I'm FREEEEEEE!!!!! I was so excited when I got it! And I have my new wallet to keep it in too! It is SO COOL; I feel like such a grown-up! =P But we all know that's not true! =)

My concerto competition is today. And it's good, because yesterday I found a penny heads up on the street. ""Find a penny, pick it up, all the day you'll have good luck!"" So, lets hope! All's I have to do, I figure, is just go in there and play the way I've been practicing and it'll all be good. So just think happy thoughts for me today at around 2:45 Central time... I'd be very much obliged! 

Right, I'm going to go back to bed, considering I just took some cough medicine and hopefully I'll be able to sleep now without coughing all the time... TTYL!

Oh! And thanks to Helena for including me in her journal entry! That made me feel so special!!!! =) Thanks!"

"event","Isn't life strange sometimes?

I think it is. Sometimes I think life is like a math equation, you know, like one of those that I solve in Algebra II every day? Mr. Lambdin always says the sides have to balance out. If I have 2 x's on one side, I'd better have 2 x's on the other side, or it just won't work. Life sure has x's on both sides. The second I get one more x on one side, another x comes shooting out and lands on the other side. Sure, there are ""good days"" and ""bad days"", but eventually, won't the x's even out? It amazes me how life works sometimes. How so many great things can happen to me, yet I have an equal amount of bad things crashing on the other side. It's almost like I'm never supposed to be truly happy. Maybe that's why everyone is always wishing for and looking for true happiness, because it never really happens. It's not really possible. But maybe people don't realize that until later, so they wander around their whole life trying to make it perfect, yet it never will be, because people aren't. I guess it all goes back to the x's. All human life equations are equal or you're not human. So it's OK for bad things to happen. It's just life's equation balancing itself out."

I went into Chicago on the 10:05 with David this morning to meet Kara on the other end at the train station. Yes, yes, we made it alright and we didn't get kidnapped or raped or anything scary like that... it was all good! Then, Kara and I dropped off our bows at Bein and Fushi for the rehair and we went to eat. We went to this Italien place (that didn't really have any Italien food..... hmm....) but it was ok! I ordered an appetizer as my entree. It was just basically bread with mozzerella cheese melted on top. It was good, but not much of a lunch. Then we went to Marshall Fields. THAT was fun. :-) Kara and I each bought a wallet... they were matching, actually! Except hers is pink and mine is red. But hey! They still kind of match! It took us almost 1.5 hours to choose our wallets. That probably didn't make for a very interesting day for David.. Poor guy. Oh well! Then, David and I took the train home without Kara, because she was going to the house of Blues tonight, and we can't go... Then I went to David's house and his mom cut my hair...

SHE CUT MY HAIR!!! 


It's SO SHORT! It's very VERY short. Like, we're talking layered, and down to my ears. But I love it! I'm so glad I cut it, I was getting so sick of it! Yaaaay! :-)

Then I came home and practiced for an hour. Ahhhh... overall, a very VERY good day."

I had IMEA yesterday... You know, sitting second chair wasn't too bad. My stand-partner was cool; we had a lot of fun! She and I were comperable players, so that made me feel much better.

Aunt Cindi came in with Hannah and Gracie yesterday! We all met at Aunt Sue's today and played cards and had a Mexican FIESTA for our dinner (That's a new one...). But it was pretty ok food, I guess. A little too spicy for my taste... but ok. It was so good to see Hannah again, and meet Gracie. She's so cute! She has this poofy hair that puffs up so high above her head... and her little hands are so cute! I love baby's hands; I just remember that my hands used to be that little. But now they're not. It's easy to get so nostalgic around babies.

Well, I just got the evil wrath of dad... for not calling my accompanist, so I might want to get on that. TTYL~"

I went to CSO last night with Linc! He had tickets, so he took Gillian and I again, just like last year. That was really fun; I love going to CSO, especially when Linc is playing. More on that later...

Gotta eat my food and get to school."

<b>I placed in the Rockford Concerto Competition!!! I got second!! And won $150!!!</b>

I lost to a pianist... but I placed in front of ALL the other string players, and there were LOTS of us! I really do surprise myself sometimes. :-)

Right, gotta run! Just wanted to mention that!"

"event","Man, cello can be hard sometimes, and VERY frustrating. 

I played at Borders today, it was terrible. I didn't play how I would have liked to, and I don't know why; I was so prepared too! Oh well, I don't care what anyone says, NEXT year, at Borders, I'm playing something FAST ans SHOWY so then I won't look like a crazoid playing all of my slow, lyrical, sad pieces that make me cry while I""m playing them. Audiences of this sort don't like to see the performer cry while she's performing.....

There's no one to talk to right now.... I wish I had someone to talk with on IM... I actually have some news but I will announce it in here tomorrow, because I'm not actually supposed to know yet... so I'll leave you hanging until then, HAHA! ;-D

Right, I have to give a speech on Monday so I'm going to go weed out all the excess crap about Mahler that I don't need to say. I'll tell you my surprise! :-) tomorrow! Till then~"

"event","I got the Elgar in the mail yesterday!!!! So, I only had time to read through the first page before my CSA concert... so I read through it and it excited me so much, I couldn't WAIT to practice it this morning, because we have no school!! hahahaha! So, I decided to make myself play my other pieces first because I wanted to make sure they got practiced today so I wouldn't play just Elgar all day. So I practiced them, and I guess in my mind, I was like ""Hurry up!"" so it was kind of sloppy, so I ended up spending 2 hours on the other stuff, which wasn't my plan. And I'm going to have to go back and do it all again, because it wasn't perfect enough. But it's ok, because I'll work on Elgar first. My goal for practice today is to get all the notes for the 1st and 2nd movements. But not quite up to speed yet is ok. The second movement is quite fast and is going to need a little bit of slow time before I bring it up in some spots. But it's ok! It's still fun anyways!!!

We had a CSA concert last night. We played Chabriel (sp?) Espana, Wagner Die Meistersinger, and Grieg Holberg Suite. I must say, the Holberg was incredible; I think it was the best our youth orchestra's string section has ever sounded. I like that one, because I got solos too! :-) So that was lots of fun. 

Ahhh, I think my lunch is done. I'll write more later about my exciting day practicing Elgar (and other stuff too). Until then~"

"event","There was Halloween! It was fun! I went trick-or-treating with Tonaki and Alicia, and David came too, with some little kids. It was really highly amusing! Then we had a bon-fire here and Sam came for the first part, then she left and David came over, and we sat out by the fire after everyone else left. It was really nice! :-)

Nothing exciting happening really today. Just practicing cello after I eat some lunch and maybe taking a nap because it's rainy and chilly and just the perfect day to practice and nap. And I'll listen to the Elgar. Because I get to play it next, yaaaayyyy!!! Ok, I'm going to head now. TTYL!"

"event","Hello!

I had a concerto competition today! Yay! I played well; very strong, very consistent, that's what Linc said, at least. I'm happy with it, but there were so many good players there today; I don't think I'll win, but I'm still happy with it! This was my first concerto competition too... so next one will be even better, and they'll just keep getting better. So that's good! :-)

I was just wearing dangly earrings my sister made me, but I'm not anymore, because Dad noticed and he made me take them out. Darn. I really liked them too.

I'm going to the movies with David tonight, yay! We're seeing Scary Movie III. Hmmm... I'll let you know how that goes! 

Right, I'm going to go listen to some music before David comes. TTy'allL! ;-)"

"event","Well... we got the results for IMEA in today.... I'm second chair again, just like last year.

But it's ok! I mean. I know that I've gotten better since last year, but the girl who sat in front of me last year maybe got better too. So it's ok! I just wanted to see the visible proof of my betterment, like, moving up a chair would have showed me that I got better. But I DID get better... I just must have been so far behind her last year, but still ahead of everyone else, that they had no choice but to put me second chair, you know? It's ok, I just wish I had gotten a chance to sit principle this year.... but hey....

<b> I'M GOING TO STATE!!!!!!!!! YESSSSSS!!!!!</b>


I've only been waiting forEVER and now it's finally my turn!!!

Ok, well, I have conference running tomorrow and then I have to practice tonight... and tomorrow... and on Sunday too. Yeah. So I'm going to go do that. Ta-ta!"

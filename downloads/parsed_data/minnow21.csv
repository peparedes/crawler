"event","so it's been almost a month since i've updated...

basically all that i've been doing is basketball like crazy. we look good too... damn good. i'm rrrrreal hyped. our first game is thursday out in BFE, but i don't even care - it's about time that we'll have an actual game. we're gonna have a gym too! i can't believe it! this season should be sweet... it better be anyways.

other than basketball... i've just been hanging out with friends -- playing mario kart, going to the movies - saw harold and kumar go to white castle and without a paddle... two GREAT movies! thought they we're absolultely hilarious. speaking of white castle... me and mj went up there the other day with $7.50 in quarters and bought 10 white castles and a large drink lol. that was a good time. 

speaking of a good time... summer has been one hell of a good time and it's a shame that it has to end with school starting on tuesday. :/ ""my last first day of high school..."" i hope this year carries on to be good like the summer was. i'm really getting into taking care of this college stuff. i'm doing all i can as of right now to get the chance to play college softball. anyways, i really have nothing to say, hence the reason i haven't updated in so long, so i'll update sooner than later...




one more thing... everyone left for college. thank you lauren for the voicemail, i still have it saved. once again you brought tears to my eyes. good luck to everybody and don't party tooooo hard ;).

"event","i can finally say that i have come back changed from camp last week. this year isn't like any other one. maybe it's bcuz i'm a senior, bcuz we're all so close, or a combination of all those things and more. i'm liking how things are going with the team already. once we get in shape we are going to be so good it's crazy! so ya, forget basketball... we had to climb the damn two story wall that i absolutely HATE! (thanks to chit and pup for getting me up it!) then we had the high ropes... :-O i can't believe everyone on the team did everything. especially bcuz a few of us are deathly afraid of heights (me, andrea, shannon!) i'm so proud of everyone, and myself! hell who am i kidding? lol. i don't know what all to talk about... if you were there you nkow what all happened lol. way to play pretty decent too ladies! i'm hyped... if we only had a gym... grrr! but ya, i'm glad i've gotten closer with everyone and i'm seeing nothing but good things ahead for all of us.
*yeslek! talk about a turn around from last year! i love you. one more year together -- it's gonna be a good one, i can tell!*

other than all that...

being home and trying to get things back to how they were before i left is proving to be ::emotional:: i guess you could say. i don't know. i'm not worried about it though, things will be fine. =)

well, it's definitely getting closer to quizno's time. i haven't had it in soooo long! yummmm. lol."

"event","so i realized that i haven't really been updating a lot lately. basically bcuz i don't know what to say. you probably won't think that makes any sense but oh well. anyways... my last macomb camp was this passed weekend. we absolutely tore shit up! we went 7-3 and i thought we played great. like pretty much everyone did, which is a good sign bcuz it's early. we leave for camp for a week on monday too. once we get back it'll be 30 days until school starts. :-O i can't believe it! hmm what else to say... softball is over for smith's team. we finished up in 3rd place. our regular season is over for the sharks too. i really don't understand why we don't win. it's sick. well, one more tournament in brighton this weekend. hopefully we do ok. oh by the way -- if you didn't already know, i chopped off my hair. it's realll short, but i like it. so ya, outside of that i've been doing a lot of hanging around. i hope everyone is enjoying their summer cuz i know i am."

<P><EM>Joey: ""How does it surprise you everyday?""<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Jen's dad: ""Good question. A city like New York... where everything's moving all the time, at this constant, driving pace... it's like a living organism. Breathing, changing. Over time, your relationship to it becomes... like this incredible romance. At first, it's intoxicating, irresistable. And then slowly, it becomes comfortable, and safe. You have this cellular connection to it. As if you've known each other forever, like your oldest happiness. And sometimes you're on the outs, and sometimes you're making up, and every now and then, you catch yourself in this trancendent moment... where you think to yourself, ""oh my God, I'm madly in love with you. And I always will be."" And I think that's why it surprises me.""</EM></P>"

"event","well, it's been a week since i've updated... i'm slacking, i know. so this has the potential to be a long one, depending on how much detail i feel like going into. ok here it goes...
last sunday - nothing special... had practice in the a.m. Jill definitely did not throw up in the middle of the coaches little talk. lol. they didn't even notice which was the best part. the only other thing that i remember that day was the pistons game. i'm getting old so a week ago is kinda far off on the radar.
monday - we were supposed to have our first summer ball game for smith's team but it rained for like 5 minutes so it was cancelled. so jill, mj, dayna, and i all went bowling, lol how random. (too bad lazer tag was a no go lol). after bowling there really wasn't much to do so we decided that we would go back to my house and play some cards. well it was a great time! we even went to white castle at like 1:30, good times.
tuesday - tuesday was full of a lot of laying around. but i don't remember what happened durring the day. all i know is i went to gibby's house for the pistons game with melissa. that was fun... hot ass notre dame guys. heyyyy. lol. but ya... Hell yes pistons! NBA champs baby! 
wednesday - for some reason i slept until 2pm on wednesday. which is pretty sad considering after th pistons game i went home and went to bed. so ya, after 2 and a half hours of being awake, i had to leave for our games at sterling heights. we won both games so that was exciting. the most exciting thing that happened on wednesday night was an absolutely hilarious couple of phone calls from MJ.
thursday - after watching almost all of the pistons parade, i went to SIJ and shot around. i went at 1:30 and came home at around 3. while i was there who comes roller blading up, but lindsay chitwood. what are the chances?! lol. she stayed up there and we talked and shot around for almost an hour. considering that was basically the first time i really talked to her all summer, it was nice to see her. good talks too. later on i went over to jill's. we went to taco hut and then to nino's with her mom. omg, i am in love with nino's. i love food! lol. after we got home we got ready, picked up melissa and then went to maggie's. that was fun but then we were getting eaten alive so jill, MJ, and dayna came over. more cards were played and a good time was had by all. it's a shame that MJ and dayna had to be home by 11:30 though. definitely stayed up till 4. =) fun night... =)
friday - who wakes me up in the morning... none other than my 7 year old cousin. oh boy! that was interesting. lol he said jill didn't have any eyebrows, too funny! anyways, went all the way out to battle creek to watch lake shore and regina play even though there was an hour's worth of traffic so we only made it to the lake shore game. they won so that was pretty exciting. friday night was nothin special, didn't get home till real late from battle creek so i just spent the night over jill's. 
saturday - sharks softball tournament at kyte with like half of our team there. thanks to the girls that did come. kara you played awesome... thanks again for being there! we lost our 3 games durring the day, but came up huge in the night game and absolutely rocked the real vipers. all i'm gonna say about that game is... don't make me get my gun back out. lol, becky i love you! welcome back lol.
today - we had one more game and lost 2-0 to the team that killed us 15-0 yesterday. we played pretty well we just didn't really hit the ball. i have to go over my yiayia's for a bit for father's day soon. but hopefully things will go right so something can happen later. we'll see. 
ok. that was reallll long. i'm suprised i remembered as much as i did. i think that will do for now though! later kids."

"event","Where is the proper place to start saying goodbye to a class that you have made such close friends with? I guess saying thank you is good enough. It was you who first took us underclassmen under your wings, and we thank you for that. Some of us have been fortunate enough to remain clase through the trials and tribulations that high school throws in our path. Others have drifted apart for one reason or another. Either way, we could not have made it through without you. Some of you were our best friends, our mentors, our teammates, our fellow record breakers, our 'twins', and some of you, some of you will always have our hearts. If you take one thing out of high school, let it be the friends that you have made through out the years. All that we ask is that you remember us fondly, because underneath the rivalries and the food fights, there was a lot of love. Although today is without a doubt an emotional time, when you walk out of these halls for the last time, let a smile shine through your tears, because you have forever effected all of us. Whether it be college or something else you decide to pursue, we wish you much success in the path you choose. Thank you for the friendships and the memories, class of 2004. Always remember that even if we are miles apart, you will always be in our hearts.

i can remember the days when some of you guys considered me to be a part of your class. i love you all so much... damn you lauren for causing me to lose it back stage, damn you nick for causing me to lose it in line, and damn you speech for causing me to almost lose it on stage! =P i still remember this day freshman year saying to at that time the sophomores... i don't know what i'm going to do with myself when it's you guys leaving. that day finally came, and i just know that i'm going to be lost. this is gonna take a damn long time to get used to... and i know it will never feel right without you guys. oh man... i don't want to start to say anything to anyone individual bcuz this would be wayy too long of an entry. but to those of you who have been there all along, or even for a little bit along the way, i love you and will miss all of you soooo much. thank you all so much for everything... i just hope that i could be half the friend that you all have been to me.

"event","<P>it was a 3 sport weekend for me. and i won't lie, i'm feeling pretty on top of the world. friday, well, i have an entire entry dedicated to what happened in track on friday, lol. saturday, we smoked fitz in both games and i played pretty damn good (even though they were real bad). today at basketball i though i was playing pretty damn good too! lol. awww, on a sad note, tonight was my last open gym... sorry MJ, i had to say it. the list of 'my last...' started today. i'm gettin old. anyways, here's what happened the rest of my weekend...</P>
<P>saturday - after our games i went over to jill's to eat dinner cuz her dad made steak and what not. then we hung out over there for a while. we were gonna go see shrek 2, but chit couldn't go, so we didn't end up going at all. so ya, after a while i went home and watched the pistons game. then, i decided it was time for me to go and buy the new dashboard cd, since i didn't have the actual CD. so i went to meijers all by myself at 11:30 at night. ya, definitely almost got abducted... it was pretty sweet... not! thank you chris salters for saving my life, i appreciate it, lol. after that little adventure i went over to josh threm's for his grad. party. that was a good time, i had a lot of fun. i ended up back at jill's at about 1:30 later on that night. wow, what a night... getting woke up by a huge BAM! at about 3:30. then having jill and the dog jump in my bed bcuz they were both scared, lol. then dayna and crystal came up and everybody passed out upstairs. jill - sorry i'm a roller! lol. i can't help it! :)</P>
<P>sunday - woke up at about 12:30, which is really late for me, even on a weekend. then i went out to eat with my dad and went home to get ready for the senior recital. everyone did soooo great! especially my lauren. omg as soon as you sang the first word, tears were in my eyes. you are truely amazing girl! i love you and you better sing that on your last day!! after that, i went to basketball and it went quite well. up until the whole sunami part! lol sarah... you're trail blazer in the middle of the parking lot all by its lonesome. poor guy! i could not believe it... the water was up to her knees! but ya, went back over to jill's and i just got home a little while ago from there. </P>
<P>so that was my weekend, i hope you enjoyed. i haven't typed this much in a while, but i'm in a typing mood. hmmmm.... i'm done typing now. i leave you with two things...</P>

we were supposed to have a game today at roseville but it got rained out. bummer... i had a good feeling about this one too. weird how a phone call from someone your pissed at can brighten your day. that was huge... and you don't even know it. so ya, melissa and i went to the soccer game since it ended up being nice out a little later on today. they won 3-1... chit scored the second goal, good job linds. after that i went home and ate and now i'm painting my nails and then calling memo. that'll about do it for today.


----> i've decided that i'm gonna do a song of the day for your amusment. it might mean something, it might not, it might just be a song i like! chances are... it'll be the third one. so i hope you enjoy either way...

"event","two things i would like to share with you all...

first, the quote of the night:
smallbeck642: my mom always told me treat people the way you want to be treated...because what goes aroudn comes around
smallbeck642: they must have a lay over in like japan or somethin

lollollol... becky you are hilarious yet full of truth...




second, lyrics of the night:

SAVES THE DAY LYRICS

""Deciding""

And it's not fair-why do I have to be so? 
Oh I feel everything much more- 
much more than you ever will 
and it's too hard when I can't even catch your eye 
so I can't send you messages 
and at night I dream of reasons that I can't let you go 
but I don't know if it's time to crack through your walls so thick that I can't see past you 
and last summer wasn't enough for me 
and now that winter comes the cold beats harder 
and no one is left alone and I'm offering you me right now- 
take me I'm yours 
and I won't have it any other way 
so don't let fools be carried by what I say because the night keeps looking our way 
and you're not seeing what I'm missing 'cause I am missing you 
and I think that we should run as fast as we can into what we don't know- 
it's time to let me in because I feel just fine.

"event","yesterday was the day... my first accident... yes, that's right... james is down... he tried to get an F150 up the ass... 

jill, cait, cimmer and i were on our way to our softball game yesterday. as always the traffic was in full affect. well i went to get over and i didn't see the car in front of me in the lane i was now in had stopped and well... bam! it really wasn't a loud bam though. of all the thing to say as i was making my way into the back of the truck i said... ""oh crap, we're gonna hit it"". so ya, got out and i guess things went quite well. i am just sooooooooooo happy that it wasn't anything bigger and that everyone in the car was ok. i don't know what i would have done if it was anything more than what happened... i talked to my dad today and the total damage was $850. but since he ordered it through his buddy it was $600. he also talked to the guy whose truck it was and the guy said he wanted a new bumper... all that was wrong was his lisence plate so i dunno what he's bitchin about but oh well. i guess that is gonna cost like $300 so there goes the $$ my dad saved from my parts. speaking of my dad... you would think that he would be so0o0o0o0o pissed, but he made fun of me more than anything. in fact, that is how both of my parents are handling this so i guess i got off pretty easy... so far... so ya, i hope you enjoyed the story of my first accident cuz i know i love the fact that i have one of those stories to tell!! grrr...

anyways, we finally won another league game yesterday. i played pretty well too, so that made me feel better. 4-1 vs. marysville. we played really well so i hope that we can keep that up. 

after that, and my whole car thing was taken care of i went to the soccer game with jill and melissa. after that joe drove us to taco hut and then back to jill's. we just hung out there and watched tv. melissa had to leave at 9 :( but i stayed and watched the OC then left at 10:30ish. so ya... that was my day yesterday, quite eventful one might say.





i can't believe i almost forgot this... WARNING DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, EVER LISTEN TO RASCAL FLATTS IN YOUR CAR!!"

"event","i'm okay, but i heard this song on the way home from our game and i really enjoy it. so i thought i would share the lyrics with you...

I feel a little bit left of center 
but then again we've all been there before
Every time I see a lost cause coming 
it's nothing less, nothing more
Every time I get lost in paradise 
I find a way to screw it up somehow
It's not the way it's supposed to be 
but it'll do for now

When you're right, you're right
Everything else in my life just might be wrong
You're wrong all the time

So far so good 'cause no one knows I'm faking
I wish I could show you the toll it's taking
Sometimes I live as if there's no tomorrow
So far so good

I better find a way to cross my fingers
half the luck'll get me twice as far
I'm sick and tired of coming up for air
it shouldn't be this hard
Every little bit'll help I wonder
if it's enough or did I cross the line
The kitchen counter is a bad reminder of a better time

When you're right, you're right
Everything else in my life just might be wrong
You're wrong all the time

So far so good 'cause no one knows I'm faking
I wish I could show you the toll it's taking
Sometimes I live as if there's no tomorrow
So far so good

When you're right
Everything else you messed up just might be wrong
You're wrong all the time

So far so good 'cause no one knows I'm faking
I wish I could show you the toll it's taking
Sometimes I live as if there's no tomorrow
So far so good"

"event","today is the day. the day that high school kids everywhere hate... the last day of spring break. i, like many others i'm sure, will do my share of last minute homework, even though i don't really care how it turns out bcuz my mind is all about softball. after yesterday, how can it not be... as you know, we went 2-1 on friday. that put us in 4th place over all, so we had to play the first place team... milford... the team that killed everyone. long story short... we lost 2-1 in extra innings. we came so0o0o close. had a few bad calls along the way, but against a team like milford one call, one at bat, or one mistake won't win or lose the game. so ya, that put us in the game for 3rd place against stevenson. going into the last inning we were down four runs. i got up with one out and got on base. then there was two outs... then i scored... and then there were bases loaded. who comes up to bat... none other than the bambino herself - CIMMER. she was kinda struggling the whole weekend, but as soon as the ball hit the bat we alllll knew it was gonna be somethin special. can you say over the fence grand slam with two outs to give us a one run lead!?!! how huge is that! they were the home team so they got last bats but we held them and won the game!! oh man... so that brings us to 5-2 overall. we have a scrimmage on monday against grosse pointe south and then we start league play on wednesday against marine city. i'm hyped!!

other than softball, which has taken up a lot of my break, i have basically hung out with my team. (we are so close it's crazy)... specifically jill really. lol we are such losers and need to get more friends! no just kidding. i've had a lot of fun this break after i got healthy bcuz of you babe! my muhahaha... i love you hun!! *4.5.04* lol. oh boy... we are too much. =)

now i guess it's time to start doing this homework. i hope everyone had an awesome break. i'll see you all tomorrow..."

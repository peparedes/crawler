While I was waiting for my mom to get her nails done, I walked into Radio Shack and low and behold, I caught a glimps of Ricky buying a cellular. And Dennis & Mike was there too. SOOO then I came home and I lit about 20 candles and put them ALL on my desk and was like all lit up so I could do HW. So then, right when I go back downstairs in the darkened garage, open the fuckin garage door MANUALLY, I sharpen the pencil, come upstairs, got ALL comfy and the fuckin lights turn back on... I was like ""Wow... that was POINTLESS!""


So now here I am! and I am in an okay mood... going to eat dinner...

I wasn't exhausted and yawming all day and I felt a lot better. Anyway, I am so bored right now. Jeremy said he was working overtime and was getting out at 5:00 and would call me. No call yet & I don't wanna call him because if he is still working then I don't wanna be a pest. So I'll just wait till like 8:00, and call him I guess. I wanted to have a lil fire tonight out back with a bunch of my friends, too bad it is raining and MADD cold. Last night I had SUCH a bad dream.. I was crying in my sleep and woke up with tears like, running down my face. It was so horrible. I am not going to type it out here though because you guys wouldn't know why it is so bad. Only like, Jeremy and Jess would know the hurt behind it. Butttt... I have nothing good to say. SOO I am just gonna go upstairs and finish reading...

I just made some tea and mm mm good. It warms the soul. =] Anyway. I took a test in Drivers Ed today and it was SO EASY! This was EXACTLY one of the questions...

<B>11. If you are aproching a red light and it turns green, but there is a pedestrian walking across the road as it turns green, what do you do:
A) Give the pedestrian the right of way
B) Give the person turning left the right of way
C) Lay on the horn and keep driving
D) Run the pedestrian down</B>

like what the hell? COMMON SENSE! If someone got that wrong, I will SMACK them. mm, what else. I am gonna miss Matt's party tomorrow night. =[ I am SOOO sad! But I told them I will call all of them around midnight and see what they are all up to. Get the cell phone passed around the party. Don't worry, this summer will be different. I will have my license and there will be many parties I am sure. But I am gonna go and find something interesting to do till Jeremy comes over.

everything around her just speeds up.
No one stops to see her there,
cuz no one gives a fuck...

She wants to just let go of it all,
the most important peice of her is gone.
And once again all she can do is cry,
Put on a mask to tell people nothing's wrong.

She doesn't feel like talking to anyone,
she just wants to be alone.
But when she gets her wish,
she wishes again that she would hear the ringing of her phone.

Well now just look what you have done,
the pain eats away at the only strength that she has left.
She spends the sunny days in her room,
and starts wondering of death.

Why not now she will never understand.
She tries to put on her happy face,
But realizes she can't.

the memories replay for her so sound.
Everything happens for a reason,
but why hasn't her reason been found?"

"event","Dude, I just took this quiz and it is JUST like me... omg its freaky.
These are my results:

YOUR EXISTING SCITUATION:
Volatile and outgoing. Needs to feel that events are developing along desired lines, otherwise irritation can lead to changeability or superficial activities.
YOUR STRESS SOURCES:
Wishes to be independent, unhampered, and free from any limitation or restriction, other than those which she imposes of herself or by her own choice and decision.
YOUR RESTRAINED CHARACTERISTICS:
Feels that she is receiving less than her share and that there is no one on whom she can rely for sympathy and understanding. Pent-up emotions and a certain egocentricity make her quick to take offense, but she realizes that she has to make the best of things as they are.
Willing to become emotionally involved and able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity, but tries to avoid conflict.
YOUR DESIRED OBJECTIVE:
Desires a tranquil, peaceful state of harmony offering quiet contentment and a sense of belonging.
YOUR ACTUAL PROBLEM:
Does not wish to be involved in differences of opinion, contention or argument, preferring to be left in peace."

I am leaving for the Gym in about 20 mins so I can lose 5 pounds b4 then. Look STUNNING in my dress. YA right, far from that. My mom said instead of a sweet sixteen b-day party, I can have an American Eagle shopping spree. Yeaaa! I love American Eagle. It is my all time favorite store ever. If I get anything from American Eagle I am like absolutly thrilled! Is that weird? Anyway, I am gonna go and get ready for the gym. I'll update tomorrow. Nothing to really write about anyway.

WELL, I will be real nice this weekend and ask her Sat or Sun and if she says yes then great! But if she says no then this is the plan. I will do my hair and make up at home. THEN I will wait till my mom leaves for work and I will call my dad and tell him I am going to Alyssa's house to get ready and that I will be home around 11:00 or 12:00. I will then call Alyssa and have her pick me up at my house and I will go over to her house. I will put my dress on and we will get picke dup at 6:00 to go to the school, take pics and have FUN! Then leave where me and Jeremy will be able to do anything we want for like, 2 or 3 hours maybe. Then I will go home. Fullproof! Until I get home and get yelled at for going to Alyssa's without permission. haha, oh well. I felt the need to share that with all of you. I can't wait till next Friday. I am gonna be with Jeremy all night and hopefully afterwards everything gets straightened out between us. I really miss him and will miss him terrbily if it doesn't get straightened out.

I don't want him to shut me out of his life forever. I think about everything we have done and everything we have been through and it really sucks that I will never share anything with him again... I never cared about everything Jeremy wasn't. I loved him just the way he was and obviously he doesn't love me enough to keep on talking to me. idk what to do... This is so horrible...

It's all good. SO anyway... I have nothing to talk about. I gained a pound, but I worked out really hard today and got down 2 pounds. Sweet. I am 5 pounds away from hitting my 10 pound goal for this week. I need to order that dress tonight so it can be in soon. I also need to make a hair appointment for that Friday. I think I am gonna straighten my hair and have soft curls at the ends. That should look nice. =) I am really very excited to go with Jeremy to that and be able to be with him all night. =) I wonder when tickets go on sale? idk. Who is everyone else going with?

I was supposed to go to the races with Ricky, Dennis, and Mike but Jeremy was like, ""How about you just ride up with me? We are all going to the same place anyway."" and I was like ""Okay."" But I never saw then after we left Blockbuster. I was very upset. We ended up sitting around in a Krispy Kream parking lot for an hour and 15 minutes waiting for this kid to show up that was supposed to race some hatchback or w/e. I was upset cuz I wanted to chill with MY friends. But Jeremy was right. I did make him feel guilty about him never taking me with his friends and him. So in a way it is kinda my fault. But I had to stand outside and it was freezing. I was shivering like crazy and I had to piss in the woods! Uhhg... I never do that unless I am WICKED drunk or WICKED high. So, it took me like 3 minutes to piss cuz I was all imbarrassed cuz Jeremy was all standing there peeing like 2 feet away. But Dennis, Mike and Ricky decided to meet us at the Krispy Kream pasking lot, but as soon as they were like 5 minutes away, we were taking off again to watch the race. I had to go home after that. But I will call them up tonight and see if they wanna do something. I felt really bad that we just ditched em. I was like crying cuz I felt WICKED bad. I wanted to chill with them really bad. But yea. That was my night. I finished everything I ad to do today so now I have nothing to do but sit around the house in my PJ's and hair wrapped in a fuckin towel.

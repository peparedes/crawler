"event","Okay, well I havent been up to much.  Just doing the parent thing and lovin' my wifey.  Yeah we haven't made it down the aisle yet, but we're getting there.  I'm also working. I'm borderline in debt, but what person on the verge of being in those 30 digits isnt? Oh yeah!! Thank you to everyone who made it an effort to save me as a friend and keep me as one. Not going to point out the ones who did!!! 

I dont post often and probably wont think twice of posting an entry worth reading. My writing sucks now because I focus on things that are major distractions to me.  It's sad, because I used to love writing now I cant even sit down and push myself to even move the cursor. :(

Anyways, like I say, hope all is well.


Yours truly

D. Smith"

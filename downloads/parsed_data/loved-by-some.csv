My sister, like the snotty little dumbass she is, brought up the subject. My dad goes ""Well yeah, I'll kill her."" 
I shake my head. My dad gives me a dirty look.
""If you guys think I'm going through another year of that you've gotta be fuckin' kidding me!""
Then he started ranting about how we didn't do shit, and he did everything. God... I wish he'd leave us. I hate my dad. This only made it worse. 
He's been a bastard lately. A flat-out bastard... If he touches Wobble with intent to do harm... If he hurts my Wobble, I swear to God I'm gonna hit him with a fucking pipe. I don't care if I go to jail for armed assault, or anything. He needs to learn that there is a center to the universe... and that center is NOT HIM! I fucking HATE my dad! I wish he'd just crawl into a hole and die!"

"event","Urgh... Been sick for like, three days. It really sucks, because my parents won't let me stay home. I've missed two, maybe three days. MAYBE. And my mom thinks I'm a hypochondriac or something. This morning the guys shook up my root beer. I knew they did something to it, so when it sprayed my hand I go 'Fuck you... I wanna drink this right now.' So I go get some napkins, and DAVE, dickweed of the universe shakes it again.  WTF!!?

Ugh... I came home today. Sick. Tired. Hungry. I see this paper on the coffe table that says 'KYLE', so I immediately think I have a couple chores. Fine, whatever. Holy shit. I swear, there must be at least two hours worth of shit on here, and half of it should be my sister's jobs! God dammit... I have to:
Clean living room SHOULD BE LIZ'S
Clean ferret cage
Change cat litter
Empty the Hyla (water-using vacuum and air purifier) SHOULD BE LIZ'S
Return table, chairs, and TV to normal spots SHOULD BE LIZ'S
Do dishes
Do laundry (and fold)
Take trash out
Collect recyclables
Pick up the rest of the house

WHAT THE FUCK!!? I hate my dad. He knows I'm sick, and he's piling all this shit on me, PLUS an hour or so of homework at the minimum, and I have to buy a fucking book for Lit. This is bullshit. There's nothing to eat here, either, not much to do... I hate my dad sooooo much. 

At least he isn't that bitch Renee... She's in our P.E. class, and all she does is bith at my group. She's nailed Dave in the balls a few times, yells at us for making mistakes in the game then turns around and fucks up in the same way, she rants at us, and she and a friend go
""God. Dave must have balls of steel""
""Or none at all""
Then they look at poor Stacey, who HAS DONE NOTHING to perturb them, and they go
""Let's kick Stacey there. She's got 'em and SHE'll get hurt""

Fucking bitches... I swear one of these days I'm probably gonna cold-cock one right in the face. I'm 80% gay. I reserve the right to beat the hell out of her!

                                                           Bad. Fucking. Day.

If I do, I wanna bring Cosby, Dean, Lisa, Stacey, Thomas, Greg, and possiblty Ryan. If I do, My sister will play, and we'd have 8 people at once on FarCry or Halo 2. Can you say 'woot?'

So yeah... My grades weren't bad this semester... But they could have been better. I hate Geometry! When, I azsk you, will I use the Quadratic formula as a psychiatrist, or a COP? WTF? This is soooo geeh. I want a pony.

I'm gonna make some HotPockets soon. I havn't eaten in over six hours, so, I might as well.

Kyle C. was gonna host a LAN party at his dad's, but since birthday girl's mom said ""No, stay home"" it migh not happen. Poor Stacey, though... Her birthdays seem cursed! 

So I tried to talk her into having the LAN celebrate her 16th birthday, but like I said before, her mom interfered. So now we're left with an uber-dilemma. WTF do we do!!? Help me decide!!!

We played a freakin'buttload of Halo 2 Multiplayer today! It was generally Cosby and I vs. Ryan, Michael, and Thomas. About halfway through the party, I was burnt-out on Halo, so I suggested my created map on FarCry. Fucking. Awesome. With three people constantly getting Desert Eagles and Devil Juice (Enhances speed, regens health + gives 1-hit melee kill.) Unfortunately, however, Mike was a sissy little bizatch who was afraid of change, so we couldn't System Link it. I got free pizza, though. :3

So anyway... Bored. Cosby and I went to Dean's afterward and played some FarCry on our own. It was them vs. me on ATVs, shooting the crap out of each other for like, 3 hours.
After that, came home, and here I am now, with nothing to do but update my blog and look at more airsoft Guns.

"event","Well... Now that I've had some time to vent and pour my emotions into some drawings... I think I'm all right. I inked my new picture today. It's of a fallen angel whose wings are like a mass of curved tree limbs extrending from his back. I'll upload it if I can get the scanner to work sometime soon... Speaking of which, we really only need a new power cable. Oh well.

   I actually have some self-esteem again! We kicked some ass in soccer today in P.E., so I'm feeling pretty good about myself. Other than that, today was relatively uneventful. For some reason, LJ won't let me post pics at all. I'll plug in the URL for the insert thingie, and it just displays an X. Meh. I'll try again! ... Damn. Not working worth a flying fuck. 

   Oh yeah. Thomas is having another LAN party on Saturday. I'm gonna kick some ass at Halo! Ryan, Michael, Cosby, Thomas, and I'll be having at it with great fisticuffs of DOOM! Anyway, impending doom aside, I think It'll be quite the rousing game of Kill. God knows we don't do enough of it already!

   Oh yeah. I almost forgot. XD    Dean's mom is all pissed off at him for having worse-than-usual grades, and she's had him grounded from anything even remotely fun for almost a month. It really sucks balls for him, but at least when he's with his dad, we get to hang out an' shit... NOT making a list of stuff we do! I'm looking at YOU, Stacey.

   What else... Uhhh... I still havn't beaten FFVII, but I've had it at my fingertips for weeks. I need to level up about 20 or so times before I go assrape Sephiroth. Huh. I don't have a whole lot more to talk about... So yeah. Later."

   My family has been driving me both insane and into depression. I hate them! I want them all to just leave me the fuck alone, but it's not happening... They won't stop. My sister has been singing shitty Christmas songs all month, along with butchering the already bad tunes form Annie. They've all been badgering me about my grades, too. ""Oh God, Kyle! Yo have some C's! It's the end of the fucking world!""

   It's been like this for months now. I'll get decent grades, and they want to schedule conferences with my teachers... It's such bullshit. Just tonight, my mom asked me if I'd talked with my history teacher about my grade, which I'm pretty surei s not in the B range. I told her I forgot (I honestly did) and they both start wailing on me about how I 'Don't care' about my future, and that I'll have some fucky job that nobody likes, and has low pay. They're always going on about how I 'never study' and 'never do my homework'! God, I HATE this! I've had a sore throat lately, but they keep saying ""Oh, you don't have a fever, so you're not sick!"" Try telling me that when I'm on my deathbed with a brain tumor, you bastards.

   I hate them. All three of them. I used to just hate my sister, then I hated my dad, and now my mom is right up in there. I feel awful saying that, but it's the fucking truth! I'm getting depressed, too. Sure, I pull off happiness and hyperactivity at school, but the underlying truth is that I think I'm losing my mind, which only deepens my depression.

   The other night I had a dream. I was strapped into a rusty old chair, and my eyelids had been cut off, forcing my eyes open so that my mind could drown me with all of the most awful, terrifying and grotesque images I'd ever seen and conjured. It was horrible, and the only way to make it stop was to scream as hard as I could. I woke up with a sore throat, and guessed that I'd been screaming in my sleep. I honestly think I might be going insane, so I feel all the worse.

   A few weeks ago, my parents found out that I'm bisexual... You'll never guess what happened. They weren't accepting. My mom went into denial, and my dad... My own FATHER told me that he's kicking me out when I'm 18. Y'know what dad, Fuck you. I cried myself to sleep that night... I hope you're fucking happy, you intolerant bastards! Go to hell! 

   My classmates aren't helping. Half of 'em are total assholes to me for literally no reason... Couple that with the loads of homework and pressures that come with harder classes, and I'm wiped out by the time the day's done. I can't take this much longer. Either I'll end up locking myself in my room, or I'm gonna do something stupid that I'll probably regret later on... In case shit happens, I'm glad I've got friends who've stuck by me this far. If I end up in a nuthouse (Not likely) or in a psychiatrist's office, I won't blame you for leaving me. Practically everyone else is against me, so what's a few more? God damn it... This is a shitty mindset. 

... I just wanna die... Curl up and die in some miserable little corner.
Thanks to Chel Deidre for the picture."

Hmm... I was supposed to mow the lawn today, but the mower didn't sound like 'Bwwwrrrrrrrrrrr!' like normal. It sounded like 'CRUNCH'. I tried to get a hold of my mom by calling her cell, like, 30 times, but no dice. She pretty much just now called me back, and should be home soon. I'll have to check out the mower with my dad, because I tried oiling it up and removing any possible obstruction.
 
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO! I know I complain about boredom a lot, but I'm stumped. Family Video doesn't have any good games in, none of my friends can come over, the pizza instructions were so fucked up, I charred the thing, and not even LEGOs sound fun. GRAGGLE FRAGGLE! Chubby and Wobble are pissing me off right now... They won't leave me alone. T.T

I get to go school supplies shopping tomorrow... Big whoop-de-fuck. At least I get more pencils, and crazy schwag like that. I wanna go to the Disturbed concert in September, but since LISA's group won't have an adult with them, I got the bigass N.O. Rrgh, this sucks."

"event","So I went to Cosby's house yesterday. He got Greg, Thomas and me over for his early birthday party, which was awesome. We went to the mall, played Halo 2 Multi, and even a round of Bullshit at four in the morning. Only thing is... I lost my wallet.

It turned up at home, but I called my mom before we found it, so shit happened.

""Hey mom.""
""Yes?""
""Uhhh... Is my wallet in your car? I don't have it with me.""

And so ensued a long-ass verbal buttkicking infront of the guys about how I'm not responsible, that I lose everything I touch, and that maybe if I earned my OWN money, it'd be more important to me. WTF? I DID earn the $20 she gave me, and I don't see how it's possible to lose evrything I touch. God DAMN, though. So now I'm supposed to be grounded. She didn't give me a specific time on how long, so I'm toast. It could be a day, it could be a month, depending on how bitchy she feels. It's weird because at the moment, my dad is awesome and my mom sucks. What's going on? 

Anyway, I felt like shit in the mall until we left the arcade and parted ways. Greg and I went to Hot Topic, and lucky me, my not-so-secret admirer was working. I bought the Bloodlined Calligraphy CD, and went up to the desk. A different dude ringed me up, but 'Bobbles' hooked me up with a frequent buyer card and several more points than I should have gotten. Maybe being hit on isn't so bad after all?

We got back to Kyle's house around eight and set up our Xboxes and TVs, and the system link/LAN thingie. It was Kyle and me versus Tom and Greg. We were pretty evenly matched, as long as GReg didn't be a cheap bastard and sit in atank the whole time. I shot at Thomas in the Headlong level (City ruins/nifty highway crap), but missed at hit the barrels behind him. There was a huge yellow explosion, and Thomas was no more! XD It was friggin' hilarious! Not a whole lot else happened aside from my mom and sister hijacking MY FUCKING STEREO! She's gonna use it outside in the hot, humid weather... I swear to God if it doesn't work when I get it back, Liz will pay with both cash and pain. >.<  GRAGGLE FRAGGLE!"

I got to upload the oldish Disturbed CD onto my compy! w00t!

But seriously. We went to the mall for a few hours. Checked out Hot Topic, Spencer's, all the usual places. A gay cashier at HT hit on me (WTF?)... It reminds me of the countless other cashiers who comment/hit on me. It's getting annoying, because the really hot goth girls don't know I exst... I guess I'm not depressed enough. XD (Just kiddin'. I dun't bash my kind.) Anyway, only the goth cashier GUYS do. Why, God? Why..?

I bought an awesome shirt though. It's black and reads OTAKU in yellow friggin' letters. I ALMOST bought a kitty hat, but 1: I had no more loaned Greg cash, and 2:... See number 1.

All in all, we had fun. We're half watching InuYasha right now... And Lisa's IMing us. Lisa's kinda cool, but she's being  'gay homo wanker' (Greg said it Lisa! Don't hurt me!)

Other than that, I've been bored out of my mind. Thomas got a new Sirsoft gun the other day... It looked great on the website (Which somehow ran out of business...) But sucked balls.

Not a whole lot else has been happening this side of Lame Town except a storm this morning that drove my Sheltie insane for a few hours. x.x  I was not meant to wake up at 6:00am after going to sleep at four. Ugh... I couldn' get back to sleep, either.

My dad's been cool about stuff lately (especially the airsoft party!) I'm trying to set up a LAN party at my house for Halo 2, but I don't think we have enough TVs.
I guess that's about it.

"event","Holy crap... Recently, a bunch of my firends came over fro some Airsoft (you know. BB wars). Anyway, I got teamed up with my friend Dean. We're both stealthy as hell, and opportune attackers. Kyle, Thomas, and Greg madeup the other team. They were to defend an empty kitty litter box. XD 

The single round lasted from 9:00 pm to 2:00 a.m. It was friggin' amazing! Dean and I dised out loads of punishment with a pistol each, whereas Kyle had an MP5-SD3 and an electric mini-version, Thomas had an assault shotgun and pisol, and Greg had an SD3 and a pistol. I hid in the garage for a certain time and sniped for a bit. They found me out soon enough, so I retreated to the front yard. From there, Dean and I took up tactical postitions at each gate. More asskickery.

Eventually, Thomas had to go home, but the others stayed the night. Kyle brought his Xbox to play Timesplitter 3 on, but the little pissy thing that connects controller to Box was missing. That waso ne idea out the window. We eventually settled on an hour or two of TV before zonking out. I'm still sore!"

I just stayed at Dean's house for two consecutive nights, which was fun. We played multiplayer Splinte Cell: Chaos Theory and beat the game, multiplayer Conker- Live and Reloaded... Don't bother with it. And we went night-swimming. Katie's having a pizza party soon. I THINk I'm invited. I dunno yet, 'cuz she hasn't replied to my private message on MangaPlanet.com (created by LadyNightwish). 

I get to go camping on the 20th! w00ts! It's a 3-4 day trip, and we're going canoeing for two days, or something. Dean's coming with us, and so is my sister's friend Melissa. And my mini-collie, Sage.

"event","Wow. I havn't posted in a while. Good reason, though. I've been too pissed off at my dad! See, my sister's been isck lately--therefore bitchier than ever, my mom's out of town until tonight, and my dad's PMSing or something. 

He asked me to trim around the yard with the weed-whacker. Easy enough. I did, but forgot one LEEETLE patch of crap out front. That was the first thing he looked at, berated me, then I went to bed. I had gotten all nice and comfortable, about to fall asleep when BOOM! HE pops in and tells me that I'm grounded ""You didn't do shit Kyle, so don't make any plans for the week. You're totally grounded!"" What. The. Fuck. It's like he's TRYING to send me over the edge. 

The next morning, everything goes down fine until it's half a minute before the bus usually comes, and I have to go about a block and a half to get there when ""Kyle, I can't trust you! You're not gonna have anyone over today because you never do what I say! You didn't use the weed-whacker,"" by the time he started this, I took on a big I DON'T GIVE A SHIT, I'M GONNA BE LATE! look and started to count off the bullshits in his story. ""you didn't clean up ferret shit, and you didn't scoop out the cat pan!"" He never even ASKED me to do the cat pan! 

I seriously wanted to beat him with a heavy stick right then and there. He asked me if I understood, and just to piss in his cheerios, I go ""Whatever. I'm gone."" I was out of there, down the street, and just barely caught the bus. He was pissed agan TODAY and decided that I have to clean the garage, and he got my ferret the crappiest little pissant bottle he could find, so now I have to change it basically every day. This is such bullshit! And when my sister fucks something up, she cries and he comforts the little bitch. My family (except mom) pisses me off... Soooo much... I hate my sister, and I hate my dad.

"event","WOW! Fun day today! I havn't been feeling well since last night, but I got to ditch school. So, tyhe tables balanced, I returned homse just after first hour (Science with CASEY! BRAAAAGH! He's not a good teacher. Nice guy, bad at teaching.) Aaaanyway- I finished off a 2-liter DEW! HOLY CRAP! I had to pee like crazy, and I'm betting that you just HAD to know that.

I have six finals this semester. Science, Spanish, Health, Algebra (I'm screwed), Broadcasting, and Comp. Yes, Comp. 105. Hard class. Fun class. Penis. That said and done, I hate my Broadcasting final. It's hard to explain for me. I have to be both guest AND host of a five-minute block of TV. It'll be regular loved-kun as the host, then a caffeine-addict Smeagol-type guy for the guest. With some ood timing, luck, and decent film splics, I should get an A+. AS for math... Usual review garbage. The rest I know nothing about. I have one test left in Algebra. I need to ACE it to bring my grade to a C- at the worst. Thankfully it's easy shtuff. Just ask Stacey. Or don't. I don't care. 

MORE STARCRAFT TODAY! I finally figured out how to work the Campaign Editor mode, and uber-powered all of my Hero units. (The ones that are already ultra-powerful to begin with.) Played a few hours of that, mastur- I mean... Mastered MAX300 (<.<   >.>  o.o() ) on DDR MAX, and last, but not least, had my first PBJ in over half a year. Holy friggin' christ, Batman. Speaking of which, we had an interesting convo at lunch the other day. I asked Lisa what her favorite saying was that ended with Batman. She said - 'It's not illegal unless you get caught.' To which I replied 'It's not illegal unless you get caught, BATMAN.' Then Greg spazzed and strted beatign his head on the table, cursing at something he was thinking about. It turned out that he had invisioned Robin bent over, nude, saying in aa gay accent 'It's not illegal unless oyu get caught, Batman'. XD Holy shit, it was funny...

I hate Josh-kun. Lisa does. Greg does. Stacey does. Even Thomas, one crafted from pure, concentrated STUPID does! He's always taking my stuff for kicks (it's more to annoy than be an ass), goes on about how much he loves metal, and that he's gotta work at whichever time... SOMEBODY RUN HIM OVER! GRAGH!

Other than that, not much went on today. I'm gonna go play some more Starcraft later. To the point! If you read demongirl0214's most recent post, you'll find that she has a nemesis. Everybody does. So... RAISE YOUR HANDS IF YOU DO! <>Wields an enchanted +1 hotdog.<> I know this nemesis... and every word of insult is true. I hate her sooooo much. Her name is <.<  >.>   <>Whispers<> Rachel Ingram. She's freaking evil, dude... I hit her with a tennis ball once, though. So that was relieving.

Heh. Starcraft is awesome... Oh yeah. Sorry. Got off-track. Anyway- IT'S HOT IN HERE! AUUUUGH! MY PANTS ARE STICKING TO MY ASS! AND I'M SURE YOU WANTED TO KNOW THAT!

Well... That's all for today. I'm tired.

By the way STACEY. I'm not afraid of storms. Who is? I don't like them because Sage gets... Loud. And thunder freaks me out when I'm all calm and relaxed and don't know it's coming... SHUT UP! Oh hey! I'm gonna buy an Xbox 360 (Lamest. Name. Ever.) and Halo 3 over the summer. w00t. Yeah... <>Is all hyperactive now.<> I like grapes."

"event","Why... I nthe name of God... Did Star Wars: Episode II suck so much? I sure hope III doesn't turn out that way. I mean- II had a great plotline, nice action sequences... But there was an unbalance in the Forces of Plot and GRARGH! 

This sent the movie to the magical land of Shut The Fuck Up. It seemed to drag on in places- I expected a closing after the marriage, but nooooo. They KEPT IT GOING EVEN LONGER! AHHHH! I should be doing my Comp. 105 argumentative essay, but that can wait 'til the last minute! 

A friend and I rented the EP III game for a night. Two words: Blows, and Ass. The lightsaber combos, though few, kicked ass, but the overall gameplay was crappy. You know how on most games there's a long-ass level then a fairly easy boss? They switched it. It's a short, extremely tough level, then a long, extremely hard (No pun intended, you perverts) boss-fight. Sometimes two in a row! JAYSUS! Two-player mode looked promising... Looks can be decieving. There's a lightsaber Versus mode that glitches all the time. Much like a boss-fight, but EVEN FUCKING HARDER! There's also a co-op mode. It reminds me of Splinter-Cell: Chaos Theory. Really short segments. Really CRAPPY short segments. It's ridiculously easy on the first level, but insanely difficult from there on out! I hate that game... Sooo much.

Once again, I hope the movie will be better... If it isn't. Well... <>Cha-chik!<> Lucas WILL pay. 

There's also a big-ass storm... I'm freakin' out."

I was GOING TO call Thomas, Ryan, Dean, Greg, and someone else I neglect to mention (Sorry about that, whoever you are) and all enjoy the wonderful wold of airsoft. But NO. Dean got grounded because his teacher calledh is house. HE had a C or osmething, and his mom went all ""Ooh! Can't have none 'a that! You're grounded! Durka-durr!""

Thomas has a damned ear infection, and Greg's parents feel lazy today. I should talk... Hah. I fell asleep on the couch a while ago. Anyway- Ryan couldn't, either. He's also grounded because he's extremely lazy in theeducation area. He doesn't boher to do his homework. Stupid. Fuck. 

Good news! I have 20 cats. Twenty. Fucking. Cats. Want me to repeat it? We started with a kickass fatass. He was Shadow, and black. For osme odd reason I've had better luck since we got him in '96. Then along came the stray, helpless Momma Bizatch (aptly named, too). She spawned off her first breed about a year ago. Now they're huge. Then she got preggers again, only three or four months later. We got rid o that 'batch'. About two months ago, she had another batch. I'm keeping the one that always looks high... Or has Down Syndrome. XD She's hilarious (Wobble). So then two of Momma's first breed caught the pregnancy virus, and spewed out a total of seven in my dad's closet. The ingrate deserved it, too. ""These aren't MY responsibility. Durka-durr!"" Or something to that effect... So now Dot (one of the originals) is still loaded and ready to pop. Let's review.

"event","I'm still friggin' bored! How can this be, you ask? Why should I care, you ask? BEcause I said so. Simple as that. Since I'm so bored, I'll go over my aforementioned Airsoft Arsenal.

I have the following-

Spring Beretta M92Fs, no mags (Duct Tape mod after it broke... A lot.)
Two Electric Beretta M9 guns. One mag each. 
I have a Browning Hi-Power. It has one thirteen-round magazine.
There's my newest (And best) gun, a UHC 1911 .45 caliber pistol. I have two 23-roung mags.
I have an MP5-SD6, silencer non-removable, tac-light, extend-o stock, some shotgun parts to make it cooler, and nice accuracy. Two 21-round clips.
And of cours,e what arsenal is complete without a SPAS-12 shotgun? It's got a single line of up to 40 (!!!) BBs in one go. Cokcing multiple times gets you a burst-shot. Why do this? 'Cuz it's funny to see people get sprayed by 20 BBs at once.

Non-weapons include a standard Thigh holster, with extra mag pouch, a CD-player hip holder (Now a gun holster) with space for up to three extra mags, and a nice Brass Eagle paintball mask. Now- wanna play?

"event","And so, it seems the need for the great Mystery, has ended, short lived as it was.  Only one legend, which kept the people curious and in awe, to drift away and become forgotten with the passing of time.  And with the end, comes the final words.  Since this will most likely be my last post, and I have so few people on my list anyway, I have decided to make this entry public, instead of friend's only.  However, I have also decided not to seem as though I am trying to draw attention, and have prevented this entry from being seen on any friend's entries.  I have disallowed comments, for they are unneccesary; any who wish to say anything in regards to this, can talk to me under the secret personna that few know me by.

It seems all good things come to an end; and the best of things, are no exception.  What started as one of the best relationships in my life, seemed to turn as we drifted apart.  As time went by, she seemed to want less and less to do with me; what had seemed as though we were so close, began to fall apart as her interests seemed to begin to lie elsewhere.  We spoke less frequently, and she became less direct.  Each time I would ask what she was up to, she'd say nothing, as though she were not idling or like the answer were to be none of my concern.  Whenever we did speak, she seemed like she would rather be off doing something else, or that she did not want to do anything with me.  Her will to even bother with any problems, seemed to slide as well, and with that seemed to come more problems.  She said she was changing; yet, while she claims to have changed, she still acts the same towards everything else.  Perhaps it is only her feelings towards me, that are changing.

With time, she will be over all this and have moved on; the way things are looking, I highly doubt she would return to me.  Perhaps I should get over her as well, before I turn out like many others among her ex's.  Though hope seems to be dying, that part of my heart that belongs to her will never forget, and never stop caring.  Should she come back, I hope things will turn out better than they had before.  If not, I can only wish for her, and myself, the best.  But when the time comes, maybe we will be together again; and maybe, it will be with my true identity.  While many may wonder why I choose to remain known with her as Mystery, I have my reasons, which she has understood.  And as long as she understood, it truly matters not to me what anyone else thinks about it.  I'll not explain myself though, for I haven't the need to.  But when the time comes for the new beginning, we will simply have to see what happens."

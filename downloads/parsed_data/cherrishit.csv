I'm even planning on spending the rest of my life with him. And I am. Ever since november 21, 2006 we've been together. Some problems, but who doesn't have them. I love him.

"event","Lastnight Sam, Connor, Jill, Artur, Dan and I went to the movies. Jill and me kept laughing at the dumbest things because... well I really don't know. And the facial expressions Artur and Dan were giving us weren't helping us calm down. It was soo funny. So Jill and I ended up leaving the movie and just sitting in the hall. Then later this guy who worked there came in to tell us to calm down. We weren't there so he said if we came back, just to tell us to keep it down or we'd have to leave. But it was fun."

"event","Taday I woke to find my whole family chilling out in the living room. Well that was a once in a life time thing. When ever we're all in there together we're either getting yelled at{family meeting}, there's a party at my house, or it's christmas morning. Anyway, we all hung out there for awhile and then I got ready to go to my cousin Amy's baby shower. So my mom, Melissa, Shannon, and I were on our way to Monson. It was ok I guess. I'm not close with that side of my family so it did get alittle boring after awhile, but other then that I have to say it was nice to see everyone. Later I'm going to see Shannon sing with the Dan Kane camp. She has a solo too so I'm really exited to see how she does.

Tomorrow I'm going to see the Soxs in Boston. I haven't really been following since they traded Arroyo but I'm still looking forward to it. I'll keep you posted."

"event","Yesterday: Chris came over from 12 to 4. It was nice. We watched ""When a stranger calls"" with my brother and his friend. It was pretty good. Then we got in a pillow fight with my brother, which led to a game of kill eachother with his nerf guns. It was funny. Then Chris and I just hungout on the couch and talked. {It was awesome} Then my grandparents came over to drop my sister off and we all ended up dancing my the kitchen. Then Chris went home and I went to the gym later and met up with Heather. It was nice. 


Today: It was okay I guess. Kinda boring really. The only thing I really did was talk on the phone with Dan all morning then just watched t.v. Later my sister and I went to go get Shannon at camp in Westfield. It was so funny on the way there. Then Melissa and me ended up crying because we were laughing so hard at Shannon and her friends dancing along with the rest of the camp. Then I went home and took the dock out on the lake with my brother. So then again... I guess my day went pretty well.

Now it's 12:12a.m. and I'm going to bed."

"event","<center>Today was fun. Everyone was at my house by 12. We hungout for an hour. Playing guitar and what not. Even finished watching ""The last Samurai"". Then went swimming at the lake for a good maybe 2 and a half. We put the dock out in the middle of the lake and dove,jumped,and got pushed off of it. Me and Jess started hanging out uned it. It was so cool. Then Chris joined me later haha. Artur would stay on the dock and randomly show his creepy eyes. I'm not kidding. When you don't expect it they can look pretty scary. I hope we all get to do that again soon. It was amazing. hahaha.</center>

"event","Yesterday I went to Maine with my Dad, brother, and my grandparents. We just hungout the whole time. It was fun instead of going to the beach the entire time. Yes we did eventually go to the beach, but I just got a blanket and slept for two hours. Lame? maybe but the night before I went to go see""Pirates of the Carribean II"" and it didn't get out till 12:45a.m. So... yeah. But still it was fun, both events and I had a great time."

"event","It all started yesterday when Jess Szczepanek came over. We called people and were planning on going to the movies in agawam, but no one could come so we hung out at McD's instead. We stopped at the store to see Chris Walters :D because he was working then just kinda hung out at the plaza. We called Corey Pac and Gary Winn too because we were bored. Gary and his friend were going to come over once it got dark and the four of us were going to play ""flashlight tag""! Then we saw Brigette B. across the street so we walked biack home with them. I went home told my mom about flashlight tag then Brigette's  mom took us to go get Gary{his friend ditched him}. Confession: We never ended up playing flashlight tag. We just walked down to the lake and hung out there. It was fun. We staded there till about 10:45 then we all went back to my house and hung out on my porch. We started making stupid phone calls to our friends too. It was SO funny. Then finally they all left at about... 11:30. Then me and Jess went downstairs and hung out with my sisters, then went upstairs. We talked to Gary on Jess's NEW cell phone till his died, went to bed, talked forever, then finally fell asleep. 

TODAY Jess's mom picked us up at 12 and we went to her house. We went swimming and then in the hot tub. Oh mann the hot tub. Jess was wondering what it would be like to have bubbles in there, so she went and got hand soap. {obv.}That didn't do much so she went and got alittle shampoo. WELL... lets just say with the jets going it took us about 2 hours to got out all the bubbles. haha and I don't plan on doing that ever again."

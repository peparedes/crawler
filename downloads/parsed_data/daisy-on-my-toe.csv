"event","I feel like writing.... or having sex... either one.... Maybe I'll stick with writing though. lol.

I wish I had someone I could talk to. It makes me mad that I don't. I want someone who will just sit there and listen. Someone who knows the world better than I do. Someone who's don't going to make mean comments about people I care about. Someone who's not going to yell at me for the things I've done, but instead share stories of similar experiences.

I miss you Kristine *whines*

I could talk to you about anything. But now, I can't even say Hi. *sigh*

I feel compelled to completely open up to someone and just, cry on their shoulder. Don't tell me that you're here for me because most of the people on my friends list have proven at one point or another that they can't help me. And I have serious problems with crying in front of people anyway.
Only, 3 of my friends have ever seen me cry. (Kristine. Gavin. Jon.) There have been occasions when I've cried while on the phone with Miles and Shao, but that's different....

I miss long conversations about things that truly matter. *sigh* I wish, that I could have a boyfriend I could talk to like that..."

"event","<P>I feel the need to write a lot of pointless rants. I apologize to the few people who actually read my lj.</P>
<P>((Have you ever noticed you can't say ""a l.j."" when your talking? It sounds better to say ""an lj"" Why is that?))</P>
<P>Anyway....</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""ex-boyfriend rant""><BR>Sean... I wish I knew whatever became of him... He was my first boyfriend. I adored him. I never actually even touched him. We just, wrote letters to eachother. ha ha. Our relationship lasted about a week. Then he moved to Old Orchard. Sean was an amazing person. For being in 5th/6th grade he was so much more mature than most of the 18 year old I know now. I would have like to stay with him. I wonder what would have happened with our relationship...</P>
<P><BR>I was talking to Eric Overlock last night. About nothing really of intrest. But I had said my usual ""The world hates me"" and he sweetly replied that he didn't hate me. So it got me to thinking about the relationship we had in 6th grade. That time on the bus when we first met and he asked me out like, a million times. &gt;.&lt;;; I kept saying no. But the f***er was persistant as h*ll and a few days later Michelle and Linsey asked him out for me and we started dating. Eric was actually a pretty good boyfriend. We dated during Valentine's day and he bought me flowers and a stuffed dog. ha ha. It was sweet. I actually still have the dog somewhere around here. He'd follow me around the playground like a lost puppy. I ended up breaking up with him. I was in 6th grade. Relationships scared me. I wanted nothing to do with them other than the aspect of just saying that I had a boyfriend. Everything was a game then, nothing had meaning. But I dunno. I was an as*hole to him anyway. I don't know why he would even still want to talk to me.</P>
<P><BR>Alex is still my buddy, always will be. But, I dunno. At the time I didn't want the long distance relationship. I didn't like phone calls. I was still, kinda scared of relationships. I think it works out better with the two of us just being friends.</P>
<P><BR>I love Miles. I truley adore him. We managed to make a long distance relationship work, and work well. We had a lot of stupid problems, a lot of arguments. But, I really did love our relationship.</P>
<P><BR>Then along comes Jon. I don't know... It was like, from the moment I saw him, I wanted to be with him. He gave me a hug at rock-n-bowl at Gavin's birthday. It was almost like, I belonged with him. I felt safe around him. So I convinced Miles that he wanted to break up with me the following thursday. And then I went to rock-n-bowl the next day (just to see Jon). I found out he lived pretty close to me, and so Anita and I walked over there the next day. Jon was on house arrest then, so we spent a lot of time together. We started dating that Sunday. Everyday was perfect. I got to spend forever in his arms. I remember one day, we were hanging around in my kitchen, I was sitting on his lap, and I told him that I wanted the world to end at that moment, so that I could die happy. But the whole relationship, Jon lied, and he cheated. He left me for Clara. He got mad over stupid things. We never talked about anything because he ""didn't talk to people"". That's why I like that we're not dating now. I can't get hurt if we're not dating. It kills me that he can get me to do almost anything. I hate that when I see him, no matter how mad I am, I just.... melt... and I end up using the dreaded ""L"" word. I miss our perfect relationship, even if it was only perfect in my mind. I miss spending hours laying on the couch together. I miss that terribly.</P>

<P>2 min. till the bell rings. I'm done with my stupid rants.</P>"

But yeah. Vegan Cookies = <3

It also makes me want to bake more often. I used to bake all the time, but not so much anymore due to extreme.....laziness...... >.o;; Maybe I should start cooking again.

For any stupid people: You wear them and then if someone breaks it off you have to do whatever the color of the bracelet signifies.

I don't have many colors. I bought, like, every color I could find.
I have blue (blow job)
green (outdoor sex)
pink (flashing)
gold (make out)
orange (kiss)

I had some purple ones (anal sex) but I gave them all to Gavin, lol. And Gavin gave me one of his black ones (sex) but it broke as he was taking it off his wrist, so we're going to super glue it and pretend it didn't break, lol.

I want some red ones (make out) and more orange ones.

I don't know if I'd actually go along with any of this, it just amuses me. *shrug* There are a bunch of people who just wear them for the hell of it.

"event","Concert kicked ass.

Lead Singer of Velvet Revolver has the sexiest hips I have ever seen. I spent the whole time with my eyes glued to them!

Hoobastank was dissapointing. Their sound system sucked.

The energy of the bands was amazing. The way they jumped around and went psycho, it was beautiful.

Sexy Hips guy walks out into the crowd, and says something to the extent of ""I bet you all think I'm fucking stupid for walking out here like this. Well I have faith in humanity. You people are here because you love our music, not because we're fucking rock-n-roll stars"" And as he does this, he's got, like 8 body guards around him. Lol. Gotta protect those sexy hips.

And yes, I took Jon. And yes, I am very glad I took him. Jon is a sweetie, when he wants to be at least. We had a lot of fun.

We argued a lot. Mostly about the fact that we don't argue. And then about who gets mad at who. It was beautiful.

And Jon:
I am head over heals in love with you. And yes, I even love that god-forsaken tounge of yours.

Happy? Lol. Now, what did you spend that money on?
*sigh* 2 weeks right? That's only, 13 more days.
Let's start an official count down.

My mom and I were talking and she was telling me about this lady who came into the petshop she works at. The lady (about 18 years old) walks over to the hamster cages, asks what the cheapest one is, my mom shows her and then the lady says ""okay, I'll take that one, because my husband has a snake and he told me to get something to feed it""
My Mom: ...no. You're not feeding the hamsters to a snake.
Lady: oh, no, no, no, I'm getting the hamster for...my daughter...
My mom: *cough*bullshit*cough*
Lady: I want to get that hamster for my daughter.
My mom: no.
Lady: what?
My Mom: no.
Lady: ....why?
My Mom: I don't believe you.
Lady: But... I want that hamster...
My mom: no.
Lady: Can I see your boss?
My mom: no.
Lady: Fine, then I'll just leave.
My mom: okay.
*lady leaves*

That right there is brilliant.

Then we joked about Emma ratting me out when I snuck out. And about how close she was to calling the cops. Then we talked about Jon and I. And why Jon never comes over anymore. We talked about Chicago, the schools there. We talked about Maine. We talked about my older brother being on tv. We talked about the writing on my hand saying ""Love is suicide"" and the artist meaning of it.

""Art is not to question.
It's do or die.
That's why it's artistic suicide."" (or something like that.)

My mom can be pretty cool sometimes.

*smiles* yeah, good day.

I refused to sit in a desk for most of my classes. And I refused to wear shoes too. I spent all math class painting about love.

Okay, I have an older brother (yeah... I don't mention him much because he's a pain-in-the-ass failure). A while ago he and this guy called Pit, started up a business, Pit Customs, they do the whole ""pimp up the car"" dealie. Some guy came along, liked the guys, liked the work they did, and offered them a job. My brother is going to be on a show on UPN, it'll be like the Pimp My Ride show on MTV. It's awesome though, he lost 80lbs, and he's got blonde spikey hair now. It's fucking crazy.

My failure of a big brother actually did something useful. I'm actually proud of him, that's a first.






And the song, Lonely by Akon, is starting to grow on me. I adore the lyrics.

I'm going to a concert with Jon, The Mother, and David this friday, w00t. Velvet Revolver and Hoobastank. All this main-stream shit is starting to grow on me. Ha ha. I blame you Jon.

Shao. Miles was just being... Miles.... Don't pay him any attention. I adore getting comments from you. And I'd be most upset if you were to stop talking to me due to some dumb thing Miles said. I love you Shao. *clings* You're the bestest father I've ever had."

"event","This is a notice for all who still read my lj rants:

My lj will no longer consist of any meaningful topics or long rants. It will consist basically of pictures/painting/etc. and short rants on the bliss or dismay of the days to come.

My new posts will be public, so I will also not be adding anyone new to my friends list, because I see no need for it.

Luv ya.

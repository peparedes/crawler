"event","Okay, so it has been a while since I've actually wrote anything in this journal. I'd like to point out that I've been having issues. Lol, like it would be the first time, nor will it be the last. For the lack of better words, I am semi homeless, granted I have one parent that still has anything to do with me and I have moved in with my mother. Most of you know the situation, yays for you, for those who don't, I surely don't want to talk about it. I just have my laptop, phone, clothes I left at my mother's house, and my car, luckily I had most of my winter clothes stored at mum's place. I have my health, some sense of sanity, the phrase ""Meh, it was only stuff."" Granted it was almost a lifetime of junk, but it was still mine. Sad thing is, I mourn the loss of my cd collection, games, ps1 and my books. What I miss the most is my books. You people know how much I love to read, and those who had ever been to my apartment knew that the books were piled everywhere, on the floor, countertops, couch, entertainment center... etc. 

Life's a bitch and then we go on... 
I've gotten some donated scrubs and slacks to wear to work, granted they are baggy as hell and I didn't think they made women's pants this long, but I have enough clothes to make it through. I've been waiting on different places to have sales so I can get some more jeans, cause I think I have four pair, a couple pair of track pants, and two pairs of khakis. I've also built my cheap tshirt collection back up. I don't care what you say about walmart tshirts, stfu and have a nice day, I like them, cause they tend to have ""accidents"" if my mother decides grabs clothes from my hamper to make sure the washers have a full load. I do my own laundry thank you very much, but there's times when she doesn't think she has enough clothes of the light colored or dark colored clothes, so she grabs some of mine. I've lost my misfits tshirt cause of that... yeah... it was black with the crimson ghost face on the front, at one point, now it's a dull pink with tinges of grey in it and the white ""crimson ghost"" face on the front. She's lost several tshirts like that, absent minded, adding bleach to the wrong washer... -le sigh- I have to steal her normal shirts and wash them so she won't bleach them, or have bleach spots some how on them, cause she also puts too much of the color safe bleach and some how ruins her shirts as well. Example? She used to have a dark purple shirt, like royal purple, now it's bright ""sherbert"" orange. 

I've made an attempt at drawing a little, but I have no motive, nor inspiration. (No, we're still not doing ""Butcher Knife"" until you figure out what the hell they're doing and you make a script or a outline, Sam.) I also bought a small wacom, a 6x8"" medium Bamboo Fun, just to play around with until I get the feeling for it. (The old tablet was turned into a chew toy by four pain in the butt kittens.) 

So, let's see, cheap used wacom tablet... semi talked about being without a home of my own... What is left? The kittens are still a pain in the ass. I'm reading, ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"", ""The Zombie Survival Guide"", ""World War Z"", ""Swallowing Darkness"", ""Stolen"", ""Darker Angels"", ""Dark Stranger"", ""The Renegade Hunter""... Yeah, blame the A.D.D. for the skipping. The finished pile is a lot worse. Lol. 

 I did back up the desktop a couple of times and kept the hard drive handy at mum's should anything happen, thankfully I did, so I don't have to worry about most of my programs should something happen to the laptop. I'm sleeping on a couch with a hideaway bed, thankfully a queen size bed, so I don't have to worry about my feet hanging over the end, I can just stretch across the darn thing, though the cats don't think I need all that space and sleep around me. I can see my two kittens sleeping next to me, but my mom's two cats drive me up the wall at night by thinking the bed is a trampoline or the underbelly of the bed is their new scratching post.

I started several projects, knitting wise, the usual headband/wrap thingies, just cause everybody is asking for one, and I have to tell them, buy the color(s) you want and I can make it for you, no cost. I may add in a thin scarf with the left over thread if I have enough for it.

I have spent more time out at the casino that what should be possible for a person who gets bored easily by the machines. I get a large, I should say ""venti"" caramel macchiato for the trouble of taking mum out there, or a slice of pizza (mushrooms, italian sausage, black olives, extra cheese and onions, my favorite, yum! I'm hungry now, dammit... ) I did win like two hundred sixty dollars combined, in a few minutes. I was given a five by mum, and I wandered off to a game that had dragons on it (yes I know, stfu) and it gave me one hundred eighty-five  within two spins. I cashed out and put my five back in the machine at another spot and wound up with the money, and wandered off to sit around to wait on mum to finish playing. I haven't won much after that, then again I haven't been playing that much, more or less wandering around the casino for good measure maybe? 

Um, um, movies... I can't think of anything. What I watched lately was, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/"">(500)Days of Summer,</a> <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1031280/""> Splinter,</a> and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0400944/""> Witches Hammer </a>. I'm gonna watch <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1183732/"">Tokyo Gore Police,</a> and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415679/"">Boy Eats Girl</a> again, probably tomorrow or so.

Comics... um, lol the boss would probably disown me if I didn't put <a href=""http://www.shonenpunk.com/""> Shonen Punk </a>, though it just ended, still a good read imho... <a href=""http://unseenllc.com/core.php""> Fragile Gravity </a>, <a href=""http://www.theaterhopper.com/""> Theater Hopper </a>,and yet another one that has run it's course but still fun to look at, <a href=""http://housd.net/index.php""> Housd </a> 

I'm done...

So needless to say I got a new phone and having to return calls to you people who have left voicemails. XD Sad thing is that I still havent finished putting the new futon together, or push the old stuff to the side so i can set up the damn thing. </p> I don't exactly know how to say that I had fun the other thursday, without having to make the excuse that my phone and broadband card was crushed without it sounding too lame after not sending a message or email why I was missing. Its not like I was hiding or anything. Maybe I just creeped him out... -snickers- wouldnt be the first time, but I tell you people that I dont talk that much when I first meet people. <p> um, yeah, i'm gonna go play on youtube or draw now. </p><br> I'm done, I'm out~<br>

"event","I got nothing, I mean interesting. We really dont celebrate holidays except for the nieces and nephews, but the adults just buy crap when its on sale then hand it over unwrapped. I did, however, recieve many wrapped presents from family members... Two skull hoodies, a couple of skull keychains, several skull earrings (since I do have nine piercings in each ear), two DS games (one I've beaten twice since christmas), a pair of boots made from recycle plastic bottles (I like 'em they have buckles!), some more yarn (like a twenty gallon tote, full to the brim wasnt enough yarn), um, lets see, um, a little purse that has skulls on it and $45 sent through other parties from my father... Yeah, that just got put off to the side. I got myself a new messenger bag (it was on sale and it had metal on the loophandles instead of plastic) and a new mp3 player (a four gig and plays video, lol instead of my old one gig that just spazzed out if you tried to restart the song you were listening to, plus the voice record button was on the side, so I had a few clips of my horrid singing, in the middle of a coversation, or the sounds of the chimes, bells, and music that the machines at the casino make.

"event","So, a few things... Have I gotten tired of school yet? Yes, and no. I love learning but they say our class is behind yet they want to feed us to the wolves, so to speak, the second years. Have I hit a point in life where I question every waking moment? Yes, but it's mainly the things I've done or hadnt done in my life, and who doesnt? I just reassure myself that I am a normal person with a passion. I don't regret anything that I have done schoolwise, but I have given up on a normal life for the pursuit of this career up til now and possibly the rest of my life. Have I given up on dating? Kinda for the moment, with school, stress at work, and the usual crap with the family... Have I given up on love? No, not truly... But lust has been a funny subject in my book. I lust after two people and actually like one of them enough to be close to love. At least I think its love, it could be heartburn for all I know, cuz all I know really is lust. I think I'll know love when I get near it, but now i'm sure its just a bad crush...<br>      <b>Edit:</b> <i>A little poem, ""I left to pursue,  i chased, got what i want, but after a few days, i got a pyscho bitch like you."" -bows- screw following what i thought was love cuz it really was heartburn, lol. XD I'm down a person to lust after, so who's next?</i> <br> Anyways, I'm pretty sure none of that made any sense but I dont care cuz it's my journal entry so bite me. -tilts head to the side and smiles- 'k, thanks for the time.

         Waiting on the new episodes of Doctor Who to start and the season finale of Torchwood to end, tho... I still haven't watched the last two episodes yet... I haven't had time or I just rather sleep during the day, by the time it hits night.. we're out milling about, or just plain watching tv. Sounds exciting, no? ZOMFG... the Tudors started up again, and in June, The Secret Diary of a Call Girl, will start, with Billie Piper. XD  One of my brothers, ""Oh Em Gee... Rose -pause- Billie is playing a hooker! I'm in love again."" My reaction, ""Ohmaheefinggawd...wait... it's a girl this time?"" Oh... new episodes of Criminal Minds starts this week and in a few weeks new episodes of Moonlight starts. (I still agree that Moonlight is a knock off of Forever Knight, but hell, XD Mick is way hotter than Nick, and Mick's got way cuter girls than Nick.) Now if the new episodes of Weeds and Dexter would hurry up and start, we get to see what happened to Nancy and the boys, and the rest of the crazy suburb that's known as Majestic and what's next in our lovable vigilantee serial killer's life.<br>
        No comic links up yet till i get everything settle about... which who only knows when at this point in time. I know sometime I either have to look for a house or put up another lease at my complex.. which they're oddly pissing me off a little.. It's been a while back, at least over six months since the waterheater leaked in the apartment above me... There's a crap load of water damage to my ceiling but luckly there wasn't a mold problem... where i live the frigging place is too dry anyhow to mold half the time. -shrugs- Anyways, gonna go see someone about a piercing... X3<br>
        Oh and if anyone finds a copy of Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat... XD i'll love you... forever... i was about to say something else but yeah... I was reminded earlier this week that I didn't have it... OMFG... It's got Bruce Campbell, who is my brothers and my god... XD Vampires and b-rate movie... two of my major obsessions...  
<br>
 XD I also learned I'm gonna an aunt three times over this year... yay!

"event","Okay, so the normal. Nothing new so far... I like classes... papers already, research papers none the less, bleh. Anyways, so this past week has been fun, not really. I updated my crap over on OKCupid, nothing big, I actually put up a small blog explaining myself, sorta. I worked and finished my six papers within two days, which wasn't hard and already sent them in to be graded. I should be told by Monday what I made on them. The biggest fun that I had this week was being woke up at four a.m. Saturday morning, mind you I just got off of work at one a.m., took a shower and crawled under the afgan by two-thirty or so, falling asleep by three a.m.
It was Mum, calling to tell me to bring her a change of clothes, and that she would be in the ER... for those who don't know, both she and I work at the county hospital in my hometown on the weekends. Anywho, back to Mum, well she had stepped outback into the smoking area, where you can see the back of the hospital and the pasture that an old doctor (the doctor who delievered my brothers and our father, who has passed on) owned. Usually if you step out back you can see deer wandering by. (yes, we're pretty much out in the country so leave it be... XD If you haven't heard me talk, I have a ""country drawl"" if I don't pay attention to what I say or enunciate correctly, if I correct myself enough I sadly bring another accent in that I have no clue where it comes from.) Back to Mum yet again, anyways she stepped off the little concrete porch area, and slipped into a little drainage ditch that had formed from the run off from the gutters and years and years of rain. Needless to say that it has been raining for about three days straight before she stepped over in that direction. She would have been fine if she hadn't straightened out one of her legs while trying to catch herself, but she did. She slid, twisted her ankle in a weird direction and broke the lower part of her fibula, just a little above her ankle. She called saying that she didn't know if she had broke it or not but she just wanted some new clothes and for me to pick her up to take her home. Well, I get there, and they say she has broke it, the strap a stabilizer boot on her and we go home, long enough to take a nap then head to the next hospital over, because our hospital doesn't have an orthopedic section. We get there, they look at the films and she's admitted, surgery is the next day and I'm left to go back to Mum's house thirty minutes away, to get clothes and the essentials for an overnight stay, for her. I completely forgot stuff for myself, but after that I stayed with her except when they took her to surgery, when I left to get something to eat. I waited, they brought her back a few hours, being nearly five hours only to observe her because her blood pressure and heartrate was low, but hell those are already low on her as is, plus the anesthesia making it just a little lower than normal, but that's only because she was sleeping. They keep her another night and I just wait for a bit, they let her go the next day after we ended up getting a wheelchair and walker, which now I call Mum ""Hoppalong"" everytime she's moving around. Btw, the ended up putting a plate in on the break, to set it, she's also go eleven staples going down the side of her ankle and lower leg and she's grumpy as hell when I try and do the dressing change, tho it's not from the pain. It's just the usual, I can never do anything right in her eyes, even when I'm taking the time to pause and just breathe before I end up blowing up on her, unlike what she's done to me. I've done my best, I've kept my cool, but hell, eh... for those who know Mum, you know wtf I'm talking about. I think I'm done for the rant other than I think my legs hurt a little, but that's from pushing the damn wheelchair around the casino... lmfao.<br><br>

"event","<p>Okay, so, as usual... I got zip. XD Nada, nothing, empty hands here buddy. Anyways, since I've been on break, I've taken the chance I haven't had in a while to actually just hang out with Mum. Unfortunately that just means a lot of sleeping, eating and hanging around the house except on Monday and Wednesday nights. Those nights we head out to the casino, cuz if not we freeze our asses off stepping outside to smoke a cig, since, yes Mum does smoke... but she doesn't want the smell in the house. -just sits there and stares before shrugging her shoulders- Don't give me that funny look, I know, just kinda like I'm not allowed to smoke in my own car, she doesn't want that smell of stale smoke inside. -shakes her head slowly- Back to what I was saying, we go out to the casino... and stay out there from maybe three in the morning till almost two in the afternoon. So needless to say that I sleep maybe 4 hours then go back to functioning somewhat for the rest of the day till ... when ever she wanted me to go get lunch or dinner, depending on how long she slept. I kept myself preoccupied by just drawing and trying to get used to drawing on this laptop just using the touchpad, which I have to say I've gotten a little better. For those who didn't know I have a lousy spot over at <a href=""http://onnashujin.deviantart.com"">Deviant Art</a>. But those who ask nicely (or I just feel like it) get to see what I've just drawn on pencil and paper which I keep hidden (somewhat) online. I suck at drawing cuz I get influnced by other people's drawings then try it on my own, and I just make it look godawful but still... at least I try.</p><br> 
So yeah for those who haven't seen my hair in a while ... <img src=""http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a371/rannitora/Buh/1200857486.jpg"" border=""0"">. Front half is dark brown/black and semi long. the back half is blonde/platinum in some spots and short. The pigtails are because I can't pull all of my hair into a ponytail and the back and front falling out of the rubberband.<br><br>
I'll be back later to finish this oh so interesting update. and I know somewhere therese someone singing that lambchops song now an it's stuck in there head... -cackle, chokecough, and wanders off to finish work-<br>

"event","Yet another average post as usual... Internship didn't go as well as planned but, she said she wanted to see us around christmas break to let us watch her in court, so that works out... we just have to keep up with the papers and such but that's not so bad once you have your subject and know what the guidelines and what to expect. Meh, not like I'm actually going to use my degree to practice unless I step out of the running for med school, which I won't do since I've gotten this far. So other than working and sleeping, I haven't done much, I started reading, and no... It's not the last two HP books... They're sitting still in the crates of books I have yet to read. Right now I'm reading ""A Few Demons More"" by Kim Harrison, ""The Harlequin"" by Laurell K. Hamilton, ""Cause of Death"" By Patricia Cornwell, ""All Together Dead"" by Charlaine Harris, and ""Undead and Uneasy"" by MaryJanice Davidson.  Yeah yeah, I know a lot of books at once but if anyone knows me well enough, that's just the norm... with the short attention span and such. I did pick up the ""Anita Blake"" comics finally... Much luff there... XD I walked out of the book store that day with my arms all achey cuz I spent two hours darting from one spot to another looking at the new books that had came out and I haven't bought any books in a while. I gotta funny look after carrying those books as well as the last harry potter book, a copy of the portable nietzsche, a handfull of chargers, the chocolate covered espresso beans in a tin in shape of a d-cell battery, two family size boxes of chocolate pocky, a family size box of strawberry cream and a large devil pirate duckie.

"event","Okay, so I took the week off. Granted, I waited till it was my birthday weekend to do it. XD Doesn't mean much, still have a crapload of homework to turn in, catching up on stuff shouldn't be so bad. I didn't do much other than sleep, run errands and well... shop, but still. I paid my electric and net bills for now, still gotta pay the new phone bill when it arrives, pay rent and move the last of my b-day presents from mom's to my apartment. Not much more than the last time, just a new scanner/printer combo thingie... That's about it on the whole new gift frontier, bought some magazines and a couple of books and Mom took me to the movies the day of my birthday. We saw the <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0475944/"">""Covenant""</a>. It was so so, could have done without a few scenes but it was basic plots... Boy meets girl, boy meets rival, boy has powers that eat away at his body if he uses too much, boy gets girl, boy and rival fight. Nuff said. 
 <br>Watched a little weird movie before going to the movies that day, called <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0363269/"">""Once Upon A Wedding""</a>. I missed the first part of it but it kinda got decent from the middle on. Romeo and Juilet style love, cept, he's just a fisherman, a peasant, and she's the daughter of El Comandante~ Dictator of the island. The bad thing is, the water is poisoned so the fishermen are poor as hell because of the dead fish. El Comadante, sits in a bit of a fog through the movie, letting Pineda, his second in command, run just about everything, including Margarita, the daughter of El Comadante, who is already engaged and about to be married in a week or so. I missed the part where Margarita accidently hits Rogelio, the fisherman with her car. It's a decent comedy, but the serious parts actually just can't be taken serious. Though I do like the part where one of the fisherman's friends, Carmelita makes Pineda eat his prized koi.

"event","Okay, So nothing new as always... Exactly a week till my birthday, so blech on that, which means here comes the ""Do you feel a year older"" or "" How old are you now?"" questions start... hell if i know how old i am... I stopped counting at 13... didn't care passed then. So what, year older, yet another year has passed by, next year will still be the same.<br>
 As I was saying, nothing new... I did watch this cute little movie, at least I thought it was cute and all with the happy ending and such, and a guy playing Cary Grant as an imaginary friend to a lonely guy. The movie's called a <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374277/"">Touch of Pink.</a> At the beginning, we start out with seemingly normal guy, a photographer, living his life with his love, and every once in a while talking to his imaginary friend, who by the way, is supposed to be Cary Grant. All's well and happy, till our photographer's mother, fresh from helping her sister plan her nephew's wedding, comes for a surprise visit. Semi-emo wackiness insues, his mom doesn't know he likes guys... just a bit of ups downs, but a cute little romance/comedy. <br>
Mind you, I was watching <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129332/"">Ravenous</a> right before that movie came on. XD and for some odd reason I always remember the line of a wounded Private Toffler screaming ""He was licking me!"" <br><br>

She's so pretty too... And yes my computer is female, even if I've named her Kuroneko the second, the first was a laptop i had for ... 5 years before it broke... XD finally, even after the screen was just hanging on for dear life after Mom dropped it one night on the very very corner, causing it to crack before it spread and my laptop was XD being rigged to keep the screen from falling off on one side. <br> So, two old friends have shown up again, glad to see both of you in my life again. (Yesh, this means you, Beks) too bad i don't know where the hell the rest of my friends are, it's kinda getting creepy when it's just Sam, Mike and the twins, Matt and Chris with me constantly. Everyone seems to have dropped off the face of the earth for the moment. The only reason why I think almost everyone stopped hanging out is because school started up again, and us, the semi geeky kids got all oour homework and papers done that night it was assigned. X3 yesh, yesh we are freaks... Nothing new.<br> Anime: Ouran High School Host Club, Bleach, Nana, Coyote Ragtime Show, Air Gear, xxxHolic TV, Sister Princess RePure, Ray The Animation, Honey & Clover II, Demashitaa!

XD i've done nothing since then, washed clothes, took out trash, watched <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0085450/"">Doctor Detroit</a>. There's nothing more than that, other than I actually had a decent time, though i spent most of the time asleep or just being lazy. I got to see the first arch of the Getbackers tho...

"event","So it's 3am at the moment, and I'm still awake, granted that I have to get up in the morning and get ready to go to work. Sad as this maybe, I had a bit of an odd thought. ""What the hell am I doing?"" This is only caused by looking at friends and such around me. I feel like the odd one out in a lot of sense. I avoid relationships, only because I refuse to deal with other people, that and my personality is taken to be cold and unfeeling to those in a relationship with me. Now those who know me, know better, it's just the way I've basically been treated in my life, everyone cold and not showing that much emotions. Which, either way is still set at me being the weird one because there hasn't been an even hint of a significant other. I mean, I like people, yeah but, not enough to convince me that there won't be some sort of f#$k up somewhere down the road just because I didn't take time out and try and be caring for once. I'm not a touchy feely type and I get a little creeped out when someone I'm dating is, until I finally get used to them. Another problem is, I pick the f#$ked up people to like, people that seemed to be more f#$ked up than me, or I like the people who don't like me in the date-able sort of way, and the ones that are willing to put up with me, I don't like them in the date-able sort of way, if that makes any sense. STFU... It's three am and i've been up two days on 6 hours of sleep. <br> And the creepy thing is, I'm starting to slightly like one of those people I've gotten so used to, one of my honorary brothers -shudders slightly- It's one of those things I don't think I could deal with properly, that and completely f#$ker up our friendship utterly and completely. Conundrums are fun... btw... To say something or not. Say that I like them and completely freak them out, or just keep quiet and possibly keep our friendship for years to come without any(more) sort of weird patches. Buh...?<br><br><br> I'm done, for now... <br><img src=""http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a371/rannitora/siggie%20tries/mymind.png"" border=""0"">"

"event","Somedays, I wonder if what I do is just a way to shield myself from the real world because I was sheltered and spoiled when I was younger. Now I make bad choices in my life. Okay, so school was the only good choice I can think of right now. 
<br> I make friends when ever I don't plan to, but the ones I let get close to me, use me, leave me or turn on me quickly.  Except maybe a handful, a meager number of people but they are my true friends, turned loved ones, my true family. My family's small now, but one by one, year by year, it will grow slowly. I'm happy... That's all that counts. Now I gotta get back to cleaning my apartment before anyone sees this horror.

"event","Okay, three things to discuss here today.
<br>The first thing is, I'm a bad friend. When will you people realize this? I had a friend, who I liked, (the date-able type of like) and I told him I liked him, he just laughed it off and went on his merry little way. this friend finds a little hot girl and decides to go after her. He gets her, she's nice to him but a evil b$#ch who didn't like me hanging out with him, granted the feeling was mutual. She was cheating on her boyfriend at the time with my friend, and tried to keep it secret. Well, apparently she's not the greatest at keeping secrets because the current boyfriend found out and dumped her. Long story short? Friend shuns me for her, believing every little lie out of her mouth and he tells me to get lost basically. Six months later, history repeats itself, except this time she started cheating on him, about a month into their relationship, but he had just found out and broke up with her. He shows up on my porch, he tries to say he's sorry for tossing me aside when I tried to open his eyes. I just looked at him funny, ""I told you so..."" and shut the door to go back to sleep. XD Granted the bastard came to apologize that same night he broke up with his girlfriend, at frigging 3am. 
<br>Second discussion... I don't like being picked on or even talking about why I stay single. I don't wanna deal with a lot of drama that goes on with other people. I mean I'll listen to it, but I don't wanna be wrapped up in the middle of it. Other reason is, I pick some f#$ked up people to have crushes on. XD Two f#$ked up people + Relationship= Insanity. Granted that I would like a significant other sometime, but just not right now.  Plus my life kinda runs like ... Well do you remember a line from The New Guy ""High school is about like prison, the sex you want, you don't get. The sex you do get you don't want."" XD well That's just regular life for me. XD 
<br> third thing here? XD Don't yell at me for corrupting your children! XD I got yelled at last night because my niece (daughter to my oldest brother) got in trouble earlier in the day for hitting a boy. Well, truth be told, the little boy was picking on her and hitting her in the back of the head. She just got fed up with the teacher doing nothing but telling the boy just to stop and she socked the boy right in the face. XD Didn't break anything in the kid's face, but gave him a black eye. I cheered then got scolded too for even telling her ""Good for you, sweety."" XD I was the one that taught her to punch, was the reason why I got yelled at for corrupting. 
<br> Okay, I'm done... XD Annoying, ne?
<br><center><b>Streamline</b></center>

<center><i>I wasn't there for you,
I wasn't there for you.

I know, weather's gonna be fine,
But I can see you cross the streamline,
My love waits for me in daytime,
But I can see you through the snowblind.

You are gone, I wasn't there for,
Goodbyes are long,
I wasn't there for goodbye,

But I wasn't there for goodbye.

I know, time reveals in hindsight,
I can, wrestle with the stormy night,
Because, your love lasts a lifetime,
But I can, see you through the snowblind.

I wasn't there for you, I wasn't there,
I wasn't there for you,
I wasn't there for you.

You are gone, but I wasn't there for
Goodbyes are long,
I wasn't there for goodbye,
Goodbye,
Goodbye.</i></center>
<br>
<br>
 I'm done and signing out, this time I promise,

"event","So if it wasn't such a common thing now, I'm sick once again. Blame Mom and her obsession over Victoria's Secret lotion and perfume stuff. *twitch* 
<br>We left Tuesday to go to my apartment, I ended up with a sore throat by the time we got there, plus it was 3-4 and traffic was blargh, so we didn't go to the mall. We just ordered Chinese, semi ate some of the stuff, watched tv, end of the night basically. 
<br> Wednesday, lounged on the couch since that's where i was sleeping, since mom took over my bed, she slept the mass of the day and i spent most of it lounging between my short comfy chair, or laying on the couch, coughing, sneezing and snotnosed. Wooo... Needless to say, only a sandwich is what i could hold and a small bottle of mt. dew, and we still didn't go to the mall so Mom could get whatever the hell she wanted from victoria's secret. XD 
<br>Thursday rolls around, I tell Mom I feel better, so I get up and get a shower, thinking, ""Well, maybe since I got a shower, SHE'D GET OUT OF MAH BED AND GET ONE HERSELF!"" Yeah... That didn't happen, she stayed in bed all day thursday only getting up long enough to give me money to walk down the road to Braums to get something to eat for her. 
<br>Friday, if any of you know me you can see the problem with Fridays. Fridays, I have to drive back to my hometown to work the weekends. Well, that's the day she decides she wants me to actually take her to the mall so she can get the lotion and body spray and such she wanted from Victoria's Secret. Well, I'm up, took a shower, got ready and had all my stuff gathered at 8am. She's still laying on the bed, only to migrate to the couch until 11:45am... I normally have to leave around noon so I can stop, get something to eat and be at work on time. She doesn't care and wants me to take her to the mall anyways, even though it's almost 12:30 by the time she finally gets ready and out to the car. 
<br> Well f*#$ me, she takes her time, looking around at everything in the store before she decides she wants to go look at the lotion and bodyspray, which is what we were in there for. Weeee... *Dies* we got out of town completely around 2pm. 
  I'm thankful today that I didn't get a ticket speeding because i just barely made it at 4:28... Even though i'm supposed to be here at 4 'o clock. XD I love Mom but she can drive a person nuts sometimes."

"event","So... Being sick after getting my flu shot is a common thing for me. XD But they make me get it anyways... I've managed to infect two of my friends with my cold. I only cackled after they started showing the symptoms I started out with, but I told them to leave me alone because I was sick. So basically it's their own fault. Blargh, being sick isn't my favorite thing, especially when you've ran a 101-102 temp off and on for 4-5 days in a row, plus puking, your head congested like hell, runny nose, upper respitory infection and an inner ear infection all at the same time isn't fun. =_= Basically, I didn't want to get out of bed... I'm not running a fever anymore which is good... Not coughing as much, and not snotnosed. Whoo... Now I just need to stay away from the new sickies. 
<br> My eyes burn, XD and I need to get back to paperwork.

I need to finish boxing up my old room at mom's (a 3/4 way done just need to actually wash my old clothes and box them up), I'd love it if my uncles and such would actually work on my car instead of getting drunk everyday when they're supposed to be working on it, and three, >< Goddammit i remembered why the hell i wanted out of this damn town. >.> being stuck in my hometown kinda sucks, while waiting on someone to actually put the damn fuel pump, filter and god knows what else.

I told him last month, that i had the extra money and i would order the pump if he would fix it... he said okay... >.> well... a day later he said he couldn't do it.

"event","Seriously, don't ask what i'm doing because I don't even know. I know my family is weird, ( gross and insane too) but I'm the one that's insane in the family. XD I won't even go into why I think certain members of my family are complete and utter freaks now. 
It makes me wonder if I'm really related to these insane people. I can't say that I'm relieved to know that if i have kids that I will move as far as I can from these people just to keep them from being any sort of influence to my kids. >.< if that made any sense. 
<br> 
With that being said, I'll move onto another subject. Anime... Nothing... Exactly nothing. I got Saint Luminous Mission High School, Fruit Baskets, and the rest of Onegai Twins and Read or die the tv series. >.> I haven't watched any of it though. XD I did however get the AMV Hell Perfect collection burned to DVD so I can keep it and watch it on my damn tv... dunno... i don't know if to be afraid of it or not. I mean I've already watched it once or twice, I'm talking the entire collection... but i haven't watched the deleted stuff, I'm working on it now. 
<br>
I guess this week i need to actually catch up on everything, either that or just burn everything to a disc and just watch it at work. Which would probably be a bad thing, I never get to watch anything at work because i'm up and running from 8am till 8pm, that is if i'm lucky. XD I work from 7am till when ever they let me the hell go... which is 10pm sometimes. Gah... >.< I don't get paid enough for some of this crap. <br>

"event","So my birthday was a bit of a bust. I guess it was safe to say that if anyone did anything for me it was two days before my birthday. I mean, my older brothers gave me two pairs of boots, ""The Breed"", ""Shriek"", and a few other cheesy movies. I raided the dollar movie bins and bought 8 bucks of movies from there as my own presents to myself. Got a new computer and such, and a new webcam, so I don't have much to complain about. It's just there was no one to spend my birthday with, sam and paul were off to visit paul's grandmother and aunts in Kansas. Matt worked all of today so he was too tired to do anything, Chris wanted to go and do something stupid... Everyone else had to work, so I got to spend time with an ex now best friend today, which wasn't bad, but I wanted everyone to help me celebrate at least one day with me. My brother is the only other person and he doesn't care about his own birthday, so he's no fun. I made sigs, that's about all I did today.

I feel sorry for those who got caught up in Rita, but we got a played out band of rain yesterday in my hometown. Eh, I guess it could've been worse, and I shouldn't complain. ._.; But at work, they did make me have to break out the distaster emergency book, because they called a code black, which means tornado and/or severe thunderstorm warning. Thirty minutes to an hour passed, then they cancelled the warning when the rain started. *shrugs and sits there*

"event","So much for doing anything this week. I've straightened out more stuff in the apartment and been finding crap like an mf'er. XD I'm talking about anime, not things I've lost in this place but I did find a box full of books I didn't remember I had in the back of my closet, but they were books I had bought from the half price bookstore. As usual, it was a bunch of mystery and horror novels, and I also found my copies of the Lord of the Rings combo book and my Gray's Anatomy book. Eh, not like that was a big surprise for anyone. I got my sims semi up and running, now just to add all my goth sim add-ins, and then I'll have my Bettie Page walking around in sim land, possibly being a serial killer... XD I love killing off the other sims for some odd reason but bettie always survives. XD LAST SIM STANDING! *mewls and twitches* Yeah!
 Anyways, The only thing I've really done is see Advent Children, watched Tsubasa Chronicals, Texhnolyze, GitS: SAC 2nd Gig, Key the Metal Idol, and Jubei-chan all over again. The only thing I'm gonna do now is look through the Cutey Honey Live Action movie and a couple episodes of Peach Girl.

"event","So, I've spent most of the day doing nothing really, paperwork, filling the orders as they come, and talking to my boss all day long since it was no one back in our department except for her and me (i wtf ever). XD but anyways, boredom sets in so flip through the computer here at work and click on winamp, letting it go to the bookmarks and I set it for the big band and swing music that I normally let play while i'm working. It's either that or i play classical music, which i like both, but then i turn it to the oldies station, leave it there for 15 minutes, then flip it to the punk station. XD all in the process of this, I have freaked out my boss a little bit by the range of music i was listening to over two hours. XD she was surprised at the music selection, but kinda creeped out I knew the words to some of the big band songs. Oh well, doesn't really matter. XD I also got bored and kept messing around with the brushes on paintshop. beyond that, it's been the normal saturday. 
<br>
after being on the forums and lurking for now, XD i saw that someone had finally saw the horror that is man-faye. XD after reading <a href=""http://www.catsonmars.com/"">cats on mars</a>, and <a href=""http://www.krakowstudios.com/"">krakow</a>, XD i have the great horror and nightmares of seeing the bad jokes about him, then i had to ask the stupid question of <a href=""http://site.man-faye.com/Default.aspx?tabid=128&mid=539&ctl=Photo&ItemID=108"">""Who is this hairy nutjob, cosplaying Faye from Cowboy Beebop?"" </a> Ask and you be answered... <a href=""http://www.man-faye.com""><i>Man-Faye!</a></i> one things for sure, XD this crap is funny as hell but dammit i didn't need to see his ass.

"event","Sadly enough, even though I don't have anything to write about... I can tell you, that one) I am insane, two) my friends are insane. We spent two nights watching the old Batman tv series. ( I'm talking about Adam West and Burt Ward here...) One six hour tape and one eight hour tape of nothing but pure batman entertainment, plus the Batman movie, and yes... we're talking the 1966 version, baby! <b>I blame this on my mother, because she was the one in 1989 recording this for me while I was out doing crap kiddie things</b> (little league,choir, girl scouts, and yes... I was in the girl scouts so STFU) <b>SHE signed me up for. </b>
<br>We watched the movie first then kicked off the episodes with my friend, Chris, is running around with a dark blue towel, two plastic sporks stuffed into two socks sitting on either side of his head, and a shoelace tying it all to his head, screaming ""I AM BATMAN... I AM THE GREATEST... "" until I chased him down and beat him senseless with a yardstick, while I screamed ""I AM YOUR GREATEST ENEMY... now shut up and get in the damn house."" His dog was running around with an old black halloween eyemask over her muzzle and a yellow shirt tucked into the back of her collar. 
<br>
But it's not as bad as while we were watching an episode with the Puzzler in it, and I was making lewd comments about Rocket, my friend Sammie made a comment... a very weird one in the middle of the show, S:""Is it me... or does the Boy Wonder have a bigger package than the Caped Crusader?""  C:""Holy delieveries, Batgirl, I think you're right!""  Me: ""WHY MUST YOU SCREW WITH MY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES!""

"event","Well, it's been an interesting week. XD I found old high school buddies, get squished by one hugging, get groped in the middle of a store by another. Odd enough, I haven't seen these people since one graduated two years before me, and the other since our graduation, 4 years ago. Creepy... but the thing that is creepy, one of them has been living in the same complex as I have for the past two years two buildings down from me, and we never knew it. A few friends and I went to Taco Bell to get something to eat (hey it was either that or we sit at Denny's for three hours) But anyways, we walked in, stood back, letting other people go in front of us, and I just feel someone standing behind me. As usual, I just ignore the person, but they got closer, getting in my personal space, and dammit... I hate it when people get into my personal space. It's a habit of either I move or just ignore them until they move, either way I stood still. My friend looked behind me, nudged me then looked back behind me again as this person was still standing really close. The person tapped on my shoulder, and I turned around, only to be squished against his chest. XD It was just an old partner in crime, one of the guys I used to get into trouble with (just skipping school and getting into fights, nothing too bad...) I'm 5'11"" and I only come up to this guy's armpit... so squishy squish went the Ranni. Needless to say, I spent the rest of the night, being called ""Snugglebunny"" (which was his pet name for me, just to piss me off and embaress me in front of our friends) and catching up, and letting my new friends meet him him too. Eh, I'll semi wrap it up and maybe make a new sig banner cuz I'm bored. Oh! Two of my friends from college got ahold of another friend that i've kept in touch with, and they called my cellphone... XD they're coming up this up coming week with my b-day present from the both of them. Yay... I'm getting presents early.
<br>
<br>
Btw, suggestion if anyone wants to watch a couple of movies: <A HREF=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0138467/""><b><i>""Girl""</a></b></i> and <A HREF=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0112454/""><b><i>""Bandwagon"".</a></b></i>
<br>
<br><b><i>Girl</b></i> is about a girl from West Hills (rich neighborhood) who through so far came off to be a geek, and she hears her friends are in a band. she goes to hear them play, from there she falls into the indie scene, where she falls in love with a up and coming rock singer. From there she goes through a journey of discovering herself. 
<br><b><i>Bandwagon</b></i> is a journey of an unknown band, Circus Monkey. In the beginning, we start with the leader, who has stagefright and can't play or sing when someone looks at him. From there he builds a band of local rejects and trying to build their name up to fame.  
<br>
<br>
They're great movies if you're into unsigned, unknown bands.

"event","Little unknown facts... Most people don't know this. but I did finally finish my degrees. After taking a semi year off (bachelors in forensic science, pre med and pre law done within three years...) so yeah... XD Fun stuff! I can play the sax, clarinet, trumpet, oboe, some violin... but it's been a while since i had my violin... (smashed for reasons i'd like not to talk about) w00t... *smacks self for that* 
<br>
<br>
I can't wait till they finally put out the new Hellsing... I mean more Akucard... yay... Ceres gets on my nerves with her still trying to cling on to her humanity and not drinking blood. Bleh...I can't wait till the next volume comes out so I can happily have them all... XD now for the anime... Gawd, yes there is a god... and he's nice to those fans of Hellsing... I don't remember where but I read that they are coming out with a new series of your favorite vampire and his master... I can't remember but I think it's going to take more of a turn towards manga than the first series... dunno... *starts to pounce on Akucard but bounces back as the eight red eyed demon dog form pops up and chases her off* GAH! I'M SORRY... *twitches as she runs and passes Ceres. stops then points* I only like you because you have big cans! *Takes off running again, yelling ""And Pip... was my manwhore!"" *Ceres pulls out Harkonnen II and fires off two rounds then snaps Vladimir around and fires off a grenade. Goes flying through the air propelled by the backlash of the explosion* All I WANTED WAS TO CUDDLE AKUCARD!

"event","I think I've just been going insane after finding this http://incrediblehulk.blogspot.com/. I don't know, but I would definately classify myself as the sane one here. XD Just for the hell of it while no one's looking now, and I can say I tried to plug... >.> Anime Flix http://www.animeflix.info or http://www.animestreams.com (same people), they have streams over on Shoutcast TV. Most of the direct links to the streams are in the streams list on the page. XD Join the damn forum so I can have more people to talk to on the weekends. XD

   Btw, Go read a damn book. 
     I'm reading  Dead As A Doornail by Charlaine Harris, From Potter's Field by Patricia D. Cornwell, Every Which Way But Dead by Kim Harrison, & Resurrection by Karen E. Taylor. XD Yes, I have A.D.D., it just means I can multitask, sorta. I'm reading them basically at the same time.

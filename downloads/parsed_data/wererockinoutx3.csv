Its just my sorry luck that im a magnet to predators; jerks, players, man-whores, dogs, sweet talkers, anything acoustic, basically the entire male commnunity. All i have to say is boys are thick headed and out for blood. Theres no such thing as playing for keeps, its playing for as long as you can play. You know what they say, don't hate the player hate the game he plays. Well continuing with my life, i had an immensily horrible weekend. My wounded self decided to wallow in self pity and drink enough alcohol to supply a small clan of magical bastard leprichans. I'm paying for it now. P.S thanks to a certain male mongoose who didn't leave me while my stomach poured out into the porcelin godess. I bet this is some sort of punishment from God. If theres any justice in heaven. God won't let me in, he'll lock the gates, and take my weekend pass away. I believe its nap time. I have to be awake for grey's anatomy. ajsdflas;dlf"

Come a little closer baby
I feel like stripping it down
Back to the basics of you and me
And what makes the world go round.
Every inch of you agaisnt my skin
I wanna be stronger then we've ever been.

"event","There comes a time in your life when you realize that when your upset and you fall down, the world keeps going. Everything doesn't stop and wait for you to get back up. So you get up as quickly as you can and keep going. And eventually you fall down so many times you start wondering when someone is going to try and hold you up. And they never do. And you fall down. And you think why in the hell should I get up. No one is waiting for me, no one cares, no one is helping you. And so you stay down. And once your down there, people just walk all over you. Until finally you realize how much energy you've wasted. And so why you are lying there on the ground you think, hey since my own life sucks maybe i'll help other people. And so you do. And they are happy. And the happier they are the shittier you feel about yourself, and your own life. And the only people you have to talk to about this are the people you've spent so long focusing only on them and there problems. So you can't simply bring up how crushed your soul is, no that would be wrong. So you wait for them to notice. And when they do, what else would they do besides bring the attention back to them. Which is fine you dont mind. Until you realize it really is you who needs help, and the attention. Until you realize you are at rock bottom, and you don't want to get up. There comes a time in your life when you realize that your upset and you fall down and the world keeps going."

other variants on the love theme were pie is love, and haiku is love, but I thought brother malcolm was update worthy.

thanksgiving was good. got to go home and lounge with my brother. had a zombie roll and a couple of boats with some friends from high school at the sushi place I used to work at in miami springs. it's now a thai sushi place - don't know how that works.  zombie rolls are good.

also got to climb on my roof a lot, and break things.  got dirty hands from a plumber's snake. took pictures of spiders and bridges with my brother's new digital monster. 

rachel came and visted sunday morning, which was awesome. 

then we got to see some dead people on the highway.

my sister had a quadruple blow-out while we were down too, which is braggable. so she got herself some new tires.  

that's all I got.. this 5 day vacation thing just isn't right.. sufficiently long to let that shielding aura, that numbness you've cultivated over the past however many months at work, in class, wherever, fall apart, but not nearly long enough to puke out all the stressors and toxins that usually go along with it. eh, two more weeks.. 

ted, remember the trashcan. tire pump, laundry, bowstring, library books, rent."

"event","so spring break was fun.. like two weeks ago.

  Went to st. augustine with aaron, where we met up with rachel, friend mia, and teresa from UF.  camped there, went to the beach. my shorts fell off in the surf. it was awesome. later saw the fort and historic downtown. contemplated the rightness of toppling statues of european explorers. stole some kisses in the oldest cathedral in north america. was nice.

from there we went to orange park, where hotel rooms were to be found in abundance, when compared to the situation in st. augustine. saw some cools shops. bought a case of pinot grigio.

from there, we said later dude to captain aaron and the four of us rode down to rachel's in west palm and dropped teresa at her place.  endured a little sitdown dinner with her mom, which was cool. her dad looked at me this time, which was nice. 

rachel and mia stayed in wpb after having dropped me at the tri-rail. rode that down to hialeah. dusted off some very rusty espanish to use on a cab driver. borrowed his cell. got me a ride from my brother.  

spent the next few days lounging with the fam. dad's doing better, staying active with real estate and stuff, with a whole lot of help from my brother.  my fat dog is losing hair in that one spot on her back. my cat is still crazy. 

came back up with jordan austin on thursday to work on a paper. ended up goofing off a whole lot instead, but I did manage a good start on that thing at least. 

since then I've missed going to st. george, made out some, gone to st. george, picked up some hours at work for the jaxx really wants to do a biking tour of europe this summer fund, written some awesome papers, banged out some awesome exams, fallen asleep in class - a lot, written some okay papers, gone underground with rachel, kicked aaron's dog, written and not sent some post cards.. you get the idea. 

anyway party at my place on lipona two fridays from now I think, april 2nd. be there and be square. as soon as roommate katie busts out with the best theme possible, I'll wait two weeks, then post it here."

Your friendly LiveJournal administrators.

              

            dear admins, 

I read a good book and went to a great party. Plus, too, I made a fascinating discovery.

I guess I should say some..  The book was an exaltation of larks. it's a compy of a bunch of older sources on the origins and histories of grouping words in english and french, strung together in an effort to breathe some life back into some dead-ass language. it got me going on all kinds of entymology books. That night of the jingle bell run, I found a cool one at martin's, which is now sitting in my living room up in tally.. yeah, and that got me reading german stuff again. and that's where I am now.

The party part wasn't so much a party, as a bunch of people hanging out at my house, looking at a giant hole where my bathroom used to be.  Drilling pilot holes. laying flooring, tile. even got me a new tub. I wonder if the old one is anywhere near seaworthy. 

oh, and as for fascinating discoveries. I look really good naked it ends up. I finally know now, why I've never felt at ease in even the comfiest of my clothes, any clothes. I was meant to be as I am now. natural. pure. strong. nudi-groovin', livejournal postin', and chompin' away at sloppy joes.

thank you the friendly livejournal administratorers. you guys really know how to rock. and when I say rock, I mean do pretty dang good on the MCATs, even though all you do is study and complain.

my brother started a pop group last week. they're called mike and the tits. they're pretty good. check them out online as www.realultimatepower.net.

"event","2.) The Saddest Songs Of All Time.... these are ok say: post-stroke johnny cash covering NIN's Hurt. david bowie - five years. anything by bob seger.. or that other guy I always mix up with bob seger.. actually, did bob seger have two really big bands way back when?
4.) The lamest band names ..... don't think there are any rules here, it's either good or it's not.. some nots: darwin's waiting room, three doors down, 311, 112, golden earring... also, if you're gonna be named after yourself or your fake name, you'd better be awesome.. like beck, or van morrison.. or busta rhymes.. or even phil collins.. but nothing like trick daddy.. if you're trick daddy and you have half of outkast singing with you, you'd better call yourselves something besides trick daddy feat...
5.) Current Rock Stars Who Look The Way Rock Stars Are Supposed To Look .... two kinds of rock stars.. type one, again, beck. cool, skinny.. you could totally kick his ass, but he dances circles around anyone wish you knew.  type two, henry rollins. you couldn't kick anything on him, and he looks so mean, even with grey hair, that you really don't even wonder how he looks dancing. he's just all hard, and.. muscley.. and.. hard..
6.) Songs So Bad They Totally Destroy The Originals.... the wallflowers version of heroes that got itself famous by making it into an FTD commercial. fiona apple totally sucked what little life across the universe had in it.. sure it's pretty.. but.. yeah, life, sucked. lots of remixes just wreck things too.. people need to stop sampling tom jones and themes from old movies.. an beethoven.. please stop making bach and beethoven dance mixes. 
13.) Things Believed Only by Stoners... that it's like, we're all like, made of like, molecules anyway. nothing matters. dude.

there's a hunger inside you."

"event","new personal record for closeness to lightning striking, wasn't looking when it happened, but it was between 10 or 12 feet judging by the steam at the front steps of the library and the whole violent tremor rocking my chest cavity thing.  the whole side of my head that should be aching from the noise was still anesthesized from the dentist I was coming from.. 
(mentioned that I was shocked at how fast the temporary solution of theirs fell apart, and they (totally) swallowed the bill for that part of that procedure. very cool.)  
I think I meant to scream like a little girl, but my first reflex was to throw my hand out toward where the lightning was hitting.. probably a bad idea, judging by the neato burning sensation I've gotten in my hand each time I've opened a metal-handeled door since then.

gonna go see if I got any more super powers today.

You move to an area and<br>you multiply until every natural resource is<br>consumed. The only way you can survive is to<br>spread to another area.

"event","word on the street is, there's a party going on, and off, this evening, starting up at around 11 and change at 3943 Caldwell.. being billed as the home of the ""best root beer floats in 50 years."" in case you're not a fan of fun things like that, there will also be boozahol of all stuff and other stuffs. feel free to get all gussied up and stop by. there will be bad jazz music, and one-ups-manship going on through the night. 

you can get there from around here by going suoth on mabry past that railroad,

right at the stop sign (roberts)

past the meadows

left on caldwell (caldwell banks right pretty sharp, but yeah, it's still caldwell)

then just about all the way down, in the yellow house with all the hot dudes and babes, that's where the party's at. 

below is the address of another (web) party, at which you will find goofier directions to the same party mentioned above, the one with the killer root beer floats and the dudes and babes. anyway, tell your friends, it'll be fun, and as I've said before, fun is some hot
shit man.. yeah..

bring lube, bring costumes if you wanna, but most importantly, bring the heat, bring the meat, or stay the hell at home brodies.  and none of that rancid stuff you were trying to show off at the beach last summer.. yick!

"event","*knock wood*

We have seen such a HUGE improvement in E since he began the meds to ostensibly help with the tics. He's not having any major side effects *knock wood* and is great at reminding us to give him his pill if we dare think about forgetting.

We need to schedule his first follow up with the neurologist on or around the 15th. I know the doc mentioned going up to a full pill in the a.m. and a full in the evening, whereas now he's at half that, and I wonder if we need to or want to go up. He's not getting a ton of tic relief (that I've seen), but it has helped him behaviorally to be more HIM. I'd forgotten how long it's been since he has been his usual funny/quirky/happy self. I missed that. Oh MAN did I miss that! And he's BACK. He's fragile, mind you, so when things don't go well he dissolves utterly, but I think I can live with that. We need to talk to him and get his take on it all, but that's kind of a hard concept to grasp I think.  

At any rate, I could just cuddle the hell out of him 24/7 right now because I am making up for lost time."

"event","Pick up A from daycare and get her in the car and on our way. Stop at E's school to pick him up. He is challenging to round up, but I manage to do so without losing either kid.&nbsp; Get home, A has a fit in the car over who knows what and is crying her head off. Get both kids in the house, only to find that the dog has pooped in multiple locations in the dining room and bathroom. Open window, refrain from cursing dog at the top of my lungs, clean up poop to the tune of &quot;when can we play star wars? you promised!&nbsp; when!!!&quot;.&nbsp; Take deep breaths AFTER poop is gone as now breathing is not disgusting.

Realize that we have to leave for the TS support group in an hour, and that&nbsp;I need to get moving even faster.&nbsp; Start dinner while listening to E cry incessantly about us going to meetings &quot;all the time&quot; and &quot;why didn't you tell me sooner&quot; and &quot;I don't want you to goooooooooooo&quot; ad nauseum.&nbsp; Scurry downstairs to take sheets from the bedwetting incident the previous night and get them in the dryer. Hope that they'll be dry in time to re-make bed before leaving! 

Continue working on dinner, take the dog out (why???), come back in and realize the bathroom rug now needs washing from the dog and go downstairs with it to put in the washer. Check the dryer, nowhere near done. Clean lint trap to hopefully hurry things along.&nbsp; Choose a vegetable from the downstairs freezer that should, in theory, be acceptable to both children to eat. Trudge upstairs.

Listen to kids fighting loudly as&nbsp;I try to brown meat. D comes in to the chaos, is tired and grouchy from a long day and a bad sore foot. D gets accosted by kids with whining and anger about us leaving. D is not pleased. D takes over the kitchen duties, allowing me to get the dog and the mail. Bills. Ugh. Curse the dog quietly under my breath while kids are not within earshot.

Set the table and feed the dog. A helps me set the table as best she can, which often results in things being spilled on the floor. Deep breaths trying to remain positive about the 'help' I am receiving.&nbsp; Get hands washed, dog fed, dinner on the table. Listen to both kids complain about the dinner option, and continue to complain about why we are going out. Patience dwindling from adults at a RAPID pace.&nbsp; E eats the entree, but not the veggie. A turns her nose up at the entree, but eats the veggie. If they could only be combined into one child! E complains that the portion size of veggie was too big, D&nbsp;snaps, E melts down. That's it for my meal! A then also cries her head off because E is, and heck if she's going to let that opportunity go to waste. A is sent to her room, E to his, I clear the table. 

I go downstairs to check the progress of the sheets, and find them dry. Up two flights of stairs, amid cries of children, to re-make the bed. Realize that re-making the bed involves about 100 stuffed animals. Work very carefully to keep as many as possible in their places under the fitted sheets to make it all easier. Sweat and strain to get the sheet on the bed without knocking everything off and dodging the cat's repeated attempts to help.

Listen to the sounds of my mother arriving to babysit (bless her) and the insane frantic dog barking that goes along with anyone coming in or leaving the house. Know that D is really fed up, E&nbsp;is still crying, and mother is clueless so&nbsp;I scurry downstairs to deflect anything that needs deflecting. Listen to both kids AGAIN complaining about going, and listen to D saying she doesn't want to go EITHER, prompting me to say that I would go on my own, and was promptly discouraged from that.

Get into car, ride to gas station in QUIET, pump gas. Deep breaths. Realize that it has seriously only been one hour since&nbsp;I got home. No freaking WONDER&nbsp;I am so wiped out."

"event","I am weird. I get anxious when we have parent teacher conferences! Even though the teacher is fabulous, I'm always anxious.  Today was the best meeting yet with her. We got E's report card for the 3rd quarter, and he's doing wonderfully in academics (all 3's and 4's, which are meets or exceeds expectations). He's improved in areas like music, which apparently many of the kids are struggling with as they are doing too much sitting down! The biggest plus, however, was in the areas of conduct. At the first quarter review he was getting 1's and 2's, which were basically indicating he was nowhere near where he was supposed to be. This time, however, they're all 3's and 4's. HURRAY!

His teacher told us two great anecdotes about his behavior in the last few weeks (interestingly since we've started his meds). One is that during choice time he got a book on paper airplanes (a favorite thing of his) and was making them. Over the course of a few days, he had a following of several other kids sitting with him and also making airplanes with him. He didn't overtake the activity. He didn't do everything for them. He just sat with them and they all did it together. YAY!

The second thing was that each day there is a 'Super Kid' for the day (that kid brings snack and something for show & tell).  Apparently one of the things the Super Kid gets to do is to choose a friend to go with them to the office and take the attendance sheet. E has never been picked to be the friend to go, until this week.  His response? ""FINALLY"", but he was so excited. I'm not sure I am totally on board with this practice, but I AM glad that E finally got his turn in the sun.  

We also met with the school counselor about his TS. They don't have a ton of experience with it, so we told them what we've learned thus far, and offered to get them information. Both the teacher and counselor were very on board with that, so I have spent the morning buying and printing things from the TS Association, and have a THICK packet prepared for them both. I think we're all feeling better about the entire situation, and I know that this was given to us for a reason. We need to think of the diagnosis as a gift, a chance to help others, and I am working hard on that.

Way to go E!!!"

"event","We had our appointment with the neurologist on Wednesday and when I was filling out the forms listing all the symptoms, it suddenly clicked that YES, he does have some disorder and we're doing the right thing by being here. Once we got in the exam room (after waiting an HOUR in the non-child-friendly waiting room), I started getting anxious.  E was bouncing off the walls because hey, we didn't expect to wait an hour in a room that had nothing for kids to do, but settled down a bit once the doc came in.

He took a pretty thorough history and his questions prompted us to endorse even more things than either of us had remembered and put down on the intake form.  Long story short, our boy has a ""mild"" case of Tourette Syndrome. Mild is good, but having ANY official diagnosis is hard.  It's hard to think of him having something that is bothersome (and it is), but at least he's reported that he has not been teased (I wish it could always stay that way).  The neurologist discussed options with us, including medication, and we opted to try a low level minimal side effect med to see if it would help reduce the frequency of the tics.  He started it last night (at his insistence, we wanted to wait until Fri) as it can cause drowsiness.

I think he is doing fairly okay with the diagnosis (not that he's talking much about it), D is doing more okay than me because now that she knows what it is she knows better how to make it work as best as she can. That leaves me. Basket case, guilt ridden me.  Yes, I _know_ I didn't break him. Really I do. But do I _FEEL_ like I did? HELL YES! This is a dominant disorder, meaning both the donor and I were responsible for that particular gene combo, but of course only *I* am here to take the blame.

I've spent the time since finding out researching and reading and educating myself as I have to admit I knew NOTHING about TS before now. I always thought it only manifested itself in extreme tics/vocalizations, and that's not true. The major 'plus' to this is that many kids grow out of it (or it is much more manageable) by adulthood, but the downside is that it gets worse for many kids at puberty. GREAT! Just when you're most self-conscious anyway, let's heap this on too!

TS is linked with a variety of other disorders, including ADHD, OCD, and learning disabilities. E has displayed several tendencies of the first two, and it is really all clicking and making sense now. Not that this makes it any easier to deal with!  This link hits dead on with so many of the things we are experiencing now and have in the past: http://www.tsa-usa.org/educ_advoc/morethantics.htm

This isn't the worst thing that could have happened. It's not even in the same ballpark as what other kids/families have to go through.  But this is MY family, and it is HARD."

I think I've been putting it off hoping for improvement but we're not seeing it. His behavior in general has taken a HUGE upswing, which is cause for celebration, but the tics are just worsening.

We talked to him about seeing a doctor for it and at first he was really reluctant, but this past weekend he brought up the subject and basically asked when he would be going. I think, after talking with him, that he is also bothered by these and wants to see if he can get some help.

I have no idea what the workup will be, but hope that I am not lying when I said that they wouldn't do anything that hurts. BOY I hope that is true!

I would say it is largely that he has no clue he's doing it.

Today, EVERY half hour with the exception of 2 periods has comments about his behavior. None of them are good. Some of the most distressing:
1. 9-9:30: On bus, name calling (a girl in another class came in crying).  During story, silly silly talk.

2. 9:30-10: silly, bothering others at table during work time and not getting his own work done.

3. 10-10:30: Playing with pencil holder, not working, distracting others with talking and playing.

4. 11-11:40: silly, making noises, bothering others

5.  11:40-12:30: LUNCH DETENTION

On and on it goes...culminating in a long note at the end which stated: ""Yesterday I was sick (absent). I was left a TWO PAGE note from the sub regarding E and his POOR behavior choices all day.  I chose to give he and another student lunch detention for poor behavior choices yesterday.  We discussed appropriate behavior when I am absent. You can see though, today was a hard day.""

I think what is the absolute worst was his behavior on the bus. I don't know what was said, but I do know it pains my heart that he caused another student to cry because of his words. This is not the way he was raised to behave. He knows this is hurtful. Why in the HELL does he do these things?? My soul hurts."

Let's see, quickie update by bullet points:

*E has learned to play blackjack (older kids at a party taught him) and now my dad is obsessed with trying to 'break' him of 'gambling'. Never mind that to E, it was just a card game. Thanks Dad!
*We are one week away from FINALLY getting a big girl bed for A. Not that we haven't tried to convince her she's ready for one for months and months now, but hopefully now she's ramped up and ready to go.
*My house has been invaded by little creatures. My little pony. Littlest pet shop. Little magnet building things. EVERYTHING IS LITTLE!
*We did a neat project with our Xmas tree. We took it outside, dug a small hole in the backyard (to steady it), and decorated the spiky little balls that fall from the sweetgum trees next door with peanut butter & bird seed and hung them up for the birds. Fun, and hopefully a nice place to hang out until spring when we will use the rest of the branches etc as mulch.
*My goal for 2009 is to get A potty trained AND using utensils during meal times on a regular basis. I'm officially sick of diapers, and sick of dining with my wolverine children.
*I dropped the ball on Christmas cards to the masses this year. Normally I send so many more, but this year we've been passing around this same cold for weeks, and I just was worn out. I apologize.
*We have been home with the kids a ton during the past few weeks, and most of it has been really fun. E has learned to play (and beat us!) at Othello, Battle Ship, Checkers (he's BEEN beating me on a regular basis for weeks now), Quirkle (fun game!) and he has been flying through the game ""Rush Hour Junior"". The kid clearly has spatial abilities that I do not!
*A's pretend play involves complicated scenarios and complex language. One recent one involved the littlest pet shop chinchilla and I overheard this statement, ""I would like to play games with you too, said the chinchilla sadly."". Yikes.
*E has seen THREE movies lately at the theater and loved them all. I don't know which was his favorite, but I went to Bolt and that one I really enjoyed!

At any rate, that's enough of an update for now. I'm going to try and get caught up on what is going on with everyone else. Happy 2009; may you have peace, joy, and much love in the coming year."

This has been a really interesting approach and he's come home with books that he wouldn't normally be interested in and we are getting a nice wide sample of literature.  Yesterday he selected this one: http://www.amazon.com/Rosa-Nikki-Giovanni/dp/0312376022/ref=pd_bbs_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1226074788&sr=8-7

I realized when I saw it that we would now be having a detailed conversation about racism, which we've delved into before, but it was really informative. I ended up reading it to he and his sister last night while we waited for D to return home from her late meeting. E was EXHAUSTED, so this may not have been ideal, but he selected it. I had to do some editing (I'm not up to explaining lynching quite yet), but mostly I read it as is.  In the course of reading we covered the following issues:
1. Brown vs. Board of Education, Topeka KS
2. The function of the Supreme Court
3. Racism
4. Segregation
5. ""separate but equal""
6. Civil disobedience
7. Non-violent protest

I was so proud that he really didn't see why people should be treated differently because of their skin color. This is something we've talked about since he was a baby, but his immediate response was ""but WHY did they have to sit in the back of the bus?"" and after I explained only because of skin color, he followed up with ""but I don't get it. WHY?"".

She wasn't nearly as upset or hysterical as I know E would be.  I was also calm, yay me! :)

Long story short, she now is the proud owner of two staples in her head but she took it incredibly well. She is a really amazing kid."

"event","This morning we met with E's teacher for our first conference. Since we've been working with her closely over email, this wasn't our first contact, but the conference itself was very good. We got to see how he is doing with writing numbers and letters, and talk about how he is IMPROVING in terms of his behavior. Hallelujah!!  Very odd to be having a parent/teacher conference somehow. I remember more being the SUBJECT of them and it is just a big mental shift for some reason.

As for yesterday's Halloween party, it was a huge success! The kids were incredibly contained and organized, and our activities went off without a hitch. I have to say I lucked into the best gig there, ""bobbing"" for marshmallows. The parade (around the neighborhood!) was hugely fun to watch and it was just a good time. The teacher told us this morning that the kids being orderly and not out of control at our party was due to the parental involvement and planning. YAY US! :)

Last evening we went trick or treating in our little downtown area. I had no idea it was so popular, but all the local merchants are out for the kids and it was hilarious to see all the costumes on the little ones. Normally at night you only get to see a few, we get usually maybe 20 kids?  This event started at 5 and we got to see lots of cute costumes and kiddos. And ours were, of course, cute AND listened to us, so that was lovely treat for us.

One more side note, karma will come back and bite you on the ass. Last night after we got everything settled down, D decides she will try to enjoy a bit o'honey. D always mocks my um..shall we say extensive dental work, so I told her that she was walking a thin line with those. She comments that she's off to break her one and only crown and puts one in her mouth. You guessed it...she broke her crown! Bahahaha. Got it put back on this morning after the conference, and I have muchly enjoyed chuckling at her. :)

Happy Halloween all!"

We have a few games planned, treats, and a craft to do. Craft involves decorating mini pumpkins, which were available in bags of 5. E has a class of 20 kids. At the craft store E thinks for a moment, then tells D we need 4 bags. I'm impressed! :)

I am bringing my camera to record the insanity that will ensue, and I hope that E controls himself so we can be true hosts of the party and not the 'bad parents'.

"event","This weekend went by in a flash. Saturday we decided, with E's assent, to skip soccer. We had a hugely busy weekend planned, it was COLD, and we hadn't had a morning to ease into things in weeks and weeks.  It was GREAT to not be rushing, though the kids had energy to burn and then some. We had pancakes (yum) and got ready to go to the pumpkin patch.  When we arrived they were bursting to go go go, but there were about 2,000 people there (it seemed) so that was hard. The patch is nice, but EVERYTHING is overpriced. The kids rode ponies ($5 apiece for about 3 turns!) but we declined the hayride ($5 apiece again! $20 for a hayride, HA!). They also rode in the squeaky car things that they loved last year.   We spent about an hour and a half there and got them to run around for a bit which was good.

Came home for naps, and they both (thankfully) slept. I got ready for the next day as we were having A's birthday party and the house was a pigpen! The evening rapidly disintegrated at dinner time, unfortunately, because the kids had gotten cranky, D's wonderful dinner idea of homemade fried chicken took MUCH longer than it should have, and both kids made the large mistake of complaining about one of the dinner components. D lost her mind and made them both cry because she yelled at them. I understand when you bust your butt and people complain, it sucks, but she was in pain and obviously went a little overboard. Enter me to clean up the pieces, but at least we ended the night with everyone being okay.

Sunday we got up for church and prepared for our very busy day. E was going to be performing in the kids handbell choir for the first time ever, and I was quite anxious about what he would do with a loud bell and an audience. Amazingly, he did GREAT! He rang when he was supposed to and made people chuckle because he rings side to side and not front to back like the rest of the crowd. I was SO PROUD of him!  He was amazing in church, shared his snack with his godsister, made clay animals (got that in Sunday school for some reason) for some other kids, and was just delightful. After church A realized she had left her ball of clay in the nursery, and E promptly went down with her to find it. Awww!

Got in the car and headed to the lake for pictures and a picnic lunch. The day was gorgeous, not too hot or cold, and we were all set. We arrived about an hour before our appointment with the photographer, but she had a cancellation so we could jump right in. HURRAY! The kids were fairly cooperative, though both were much more interested in throwing things in the lake than looking at any of us! We'll see how they turn out Friday I hope. We had our picnic lunch, kids got to throw more rocks in the lake, and then headed home to get ready for A's birthday party. D got A down for a nap, hallelujah, and we tried to get E to rest (no such luck). Everything was ready in time for people arriving at 4 pm. We kept it to just grandparents and godparents, so it was a nice group. A got some fun things that she loves, and at one point she had everyone all dolled up in her new play jewelry (even her godfather!). I made sure to take incriminating photos of everyone. :) They were all gone by about 7:30, perfect timing to get the kids bathed and in bed. We're very tired, but it was a GREAT weekend.

*According to the behavioral therapist, E does not meet criteria for ADHD. His teacher ranked him much lower (fewer problems/lower intensity) than we did at home for behaviors, which is reassuring. We have a plan of action on how to mold his behavior.
*Sat was incredibly busy. Soccer at 8:30, Tar*et for a b-day present, b-day party at a bounce place (A included), home for a nap for A and E was picked up by his godfather to do 'guy stuff'. E spent the night and officially tired out his godparents thoroughly, but all had a great time.
*Sun we had church, then home for lunch, nap for A and I took E to another b-day party in a classmate's home. I had decided before that I would not be dropping him off, but every other parent did, and the hosts seemed grounded and I gave them my cell number, so I did it. I dropped him off. EEK. :)
*Used the time while E was at the party to run errands as A was supposed to be (but not really well) napping as was D. I went to Tar*et to get a price adjustment on the booster seat we bought Sat. I took D's prescription to the pharmacy to transfer it. I shopped for groceries. I took them home and put them away, with D sleeping through it all. I picked up the boy, tried to get him a haircut, but they were overly booked so I had no luck.
*Went home, picked up A, took both kids to the park to play while D made dinner.

WHEW! I was looking forward to Monday at work, but at 4 am on Monday E told us his tummy hurt, and there was no helping him. That left me to manage the home front as D has maxed out her sick time already with her surgery. He never did get sick, but just had a persistent tummy ache. He was exhausted, however, and took a 3+ hour nap. WOW. He's feeling better today, but as he says, he is NOT 100%.  I'll settle for a reasonable number that allows us all to sleep through the night tonight. Thanks!"

After dinner, he had his piece of pie (yummy) AND his sister's piece as well, because she declined it after 2 bites. DANG.

She is amazing, she covered every single period of the day, which is so incredibly helpful. He did well on Friday, the only times he didn't get a smiley is recess/lunch, when at some point he and another kid got into a fight and E got a kick/scrape to the FACE. Yesterday he came home with all smiles, and his teacher emailed me that he had a great day. FINALLY, positive email! He is still struggling with impulses and aggressive lashing out, but at least on Sunday he used the phrase ""I am taking deep breaths"" to get control of himself and did not hit his sister. HURRAY!  We are using reinforcement (go little bar pressing rat!) to keep the progress going. If he gets another day of smiles today he gets a reward. What that will be I am unsure, but I'm sure D has a good idea.

Speaking of D, she is scheduled to have the sinus surgery on Thursday. She's been fighting off yet another cold, so this cannot happen soon enough or she'll be headed for yet another round of antibiotics and prednisone. Please think good thoughts for her Thursday morning, and for all the rest of us who will be dealing with the aftermath. :)

The girl has hit the terrible threes early. I am not going to be able to fool myself by calling them the terrific threes, because seriously she is being a monster. It's going to get better, it will. Luckily for her, when she's cute she is VERY cute and snuggly. Oh that is her saving grace."

I picked him up from afterschool care and the director made a point in introducing himself and talking about how E resorts to hitting when frustrated and how they're working with that. I'm noticing this behavior more and more, if anyone encroaches into his physical space or touches him in an ambiguous way, E resorts to using his body in inappropriate ways. I saw it last night with his sister. He's turning into a boy who is more sullen than happy, more bristly than kind, more physical than not, and I am deeply unhappy.

We are most definitely pursuing the child behavior specialist's requests of providing more information. I haven't filled out the questionnaires yet as I need to be as unbiased as I can be and just report an answer to the questions without overthinking and interpreting, and right now I cannot do that. His teacher will fill them out this weekend, so I have until Monday I think to do it.

It is looking more and more like he needs some more of a drastic intervention, and I am having a lot of trouble separating ME from him in this equation. I am grieving his behavior because he is not the boy I know right now, and I just want to hold him and wipe it all away with my love, and that isn't going to work. I need to stop blaming myself for what's going on, because inherently I feel like this is my fault and like I ""broke"" him. Intellectually I may know that isn't true, but in my heart I am screaming that out. It's my fault. My genes. My screwed up family genes. I caused this. And now he's paying the price.

Again, I *know* in my head that is not the case, but getting my heart to understand that is proving more difficult."

We made it to the office just in time for our appointment. There was some toys there and E jumped in and started playing. Dr. R. came to get us and we went back with him, leaving E up front under the watchful eye of the staff.

We talked about what was going on, described him and his behavior patterns, and spent a good hour just addressing all the things we were concerned about. He asked excellent questions and I got the sense that he was wanting to understand the whole picture. He then went to get E and brought him in. E was being fidgety and somewhat shy so he didn't say much. He was asked what type of things he is good at, to which he said ""riding my scooter"" and what he would like to do better at ""riding my bike"". Hm. After a few minutes he walked E back down to the waiting room, and E talked much more on that trip than in the office. Dr. R. noted that E was blinking repeatedly in the office, and also saw the distractibility in the two walks he took with him.

We are going to fill out some questionnaires about E's behavior (as we are the ones who can see it day in/out) and ask his teacher to also fill out some, and we mail them in and have another appointment on 10/10 to evaluate what information we have sent in. 

As if that was not enough for one day, D got a phone call in the meeting from her surgeon's office telling her that the pre-op EKG they did on her for her scheduled sinus surgery on 10/2 came back 'abnormal', but that's all they could tell her. Needless to say when you're told that your heart may not be working right, it definitely adds to the tension. She did a ton of reading last night on the effects of prednisone, as she has been on it most of the summer, and it can cause an irregular EKG. Of course her primary m.d. is out of town until Monday, so D is a ball of stress. I just told her to call her allergist and see if they can read it and tell her if she's okay or not.

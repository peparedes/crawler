"event","I really didn't think this was going to happen anytime soon, but it did: I passed my driving test last Tuesday, so wooo-hooo. About half of the people fail the first time, so it's definitely something to be proud of when you pass the first time, which I did.
The only problem now is that my parents only have got one car... Well I'll have to figure that out later.

HAPPY GRADUATION TO EVERYBODY!
Show me pictures, lots of them!"

"event","The Football Club Zurich won the championship last night! They played against Basel and they had to win, because they had 3 points less than Basel. Not even a tigh would've been enough. I watched the game on TV, the tickets for the stadium were sold out. FCZ played very well, they scored after 30 minutes. Then, in the second half, Basel scored the 1:1. In <em>OVERTIME</em> Zurich's best defender scored the winning goal! GOSH, it was <em>SO</em> exciting! <br /><br />"

On friday it was a friend of mine's birthday, she turned 19. we went to a mexican restaurant (the food was yummy) and to a club afterwards (which was sort of lame 'cause there weren't a lot of people).
Yesterday we had a volleyball game which we lost 3:0, lool. but the fc zurich won 1:0 and they might even win the championship this year :)!

"event","i am becoming addicted to lj, hehee.
my schoolday, it's the most exhausting one in my schedule:


7:30-9:10 - double period english: we talked about formal and informal letters and stuff like that. i am so bad at formal writing, just can't do it in english.

9:20-10:05 - biology. we did (made?) a little experiment with the dna of a kiwi, it was quite fun to mash the kiwi and stuff. and at the end you could actually see the dna!

10:20-12:00 - double period french. absolutely boring! we're having an intern at the moment and she is so annoying. she actually wants us to work, can you believe that^^? we're reading ""monsieur ibrahim et les fleurs du coran"", i've read it before but it's quite good.

01:20-03:00 double period math. awful! the teacher never explains anything and his english is horrible (we're being taught in english in maths, bio and history). he has the hardest swiss accent you could possibly imagine and his grammar is not quite as bad but still horrible. you here things like: ""let's give him an A for his work"" or ""oh, you was here yesterday?"" *rolleyes* i am not saying my english is perfect or anything but he, as a qualified teacher should speak english way better than he does.

03:10-03:55 - physics. even though i didntt use to like physics, i quite enjoy it now. the teacher is nice, she is very young.


then i had a driving lesson. it was okay i guess. the only thing is that i CANNOT drive a stick. i just can't. imagine this situation: i am at a red light and it turns green. now it takes me about 10 seconds to accelerate (spelling??) because i am afraid to kill the motor :D. the driving teacher hates me for that, hehee.

THAT'S what it looks like outside, I can't believe it... It was a relatively mild winter with little snow here in zurich (it was quite cold with a lot of snow up in the mountains) but now that it's march, winter gives a comeback! It's horrible! I got home arount 3 am last night and there was at least 1.5 foot snow on the sidewalk... It took me about 20 minutes to walk home from the train station which usually takes about 5-10 minutes.
And because people here are not used to a lot of snow, there was a total chaos: the public transport in zurich is not working at all today and trees crashed under the heavy snow...
I am hoping for school being cancelled tomorrow, that would be the first time ever! But i don't think it's going to happen.
there is one bad thing about the snow: i started taking driving lessons a few weeks ago and i don't feel comfortable driving on snow...

yes, I have been pretty bored the last couple of days, that's one of the reasons why i am taking all tese funny little quizzes, hehe. i had my physics test on monday and since then there hasn't been ANY hoework... hard to believe, i know. but then i have nothing to do at home. volleyball starts next week but until then all i do is reading, instant messaging and watching tv at home, lol. BUT: from time to time i went for a really quick run, only 2k, but it's pretty nice. 
today school is cancelled because all the 12th graders (here i am only a 11th grader...) are taking the pre-matura (huge test at the end of the swiss grammar schools) in geography and biology. so they somehow don't have enough classrooms, good for all the other students. but i still have to go to my singing class, and i actually gotta go now. maybe i am updating later a little bit more, i am feeling like writing today.

ok, really funny thing happened yesterday. i went to the pool with a friend of mine. she wanted to swim 1km which would be 40 lanes if the pool was 25 meters long (i know, i'm really good at math, heh, heh). so we swam (is that the past form for to swim?? no idea...!!) for about 45 minutes and when we were done we both were like: wow, it took us really long...! so we asked someone how long the pool was, and it was 50!!!! meters, so we swam (still no clue) 2k instead of one!!! it was so funny! and today i'm really sore, lol!

"event","bad day... boring and useless. hot and humid. 

ok, yesterday my mother's cousin came to fix the computer and now it should work (let's ignore the ""should""). that's a good thing. 
but then this morning was bad. really bad. at around 8:30 (during vacation for me in the middle of the night) they started working on the street. great. the made a new pavement which is the most annoying noise you could imagine at 8:30 in the morning. 
then the mail came. great. a letter from the chocolate factory which is actually a good thing. but then i read it. and it was bad. from 7/4 until 8/19 I work monday through friday from 7 am (!!!!!!!!) until 4:30 pm. and i only have 30 minutes lunch break. i think they want to kill me. i am gonna die. great. at least i earn enough money to buy a laptop AND an iPod, woooooooo-hooooo!!!
then the rest of the day was unbelievably boring. it was way too hot to go outside and i didnt find a date for the lake and i am too pathetic to go by myself, haha. so i spent all day inside sitting on my bed and staring at the wall (ok, thats a lie, but it would have been cool). i downloaded a ton of songs and arranged them very neatly into folders. and i made about 4 new hemp bracelets, thats cool. 

going to bed now, otherwise i die of boringness (if thats possible)

@julie: pudding is great, my father loves the white chocolate one!!

"event","Hm, I'm sorry for not updating as much as I actually want to...! but my PC is semi-broken and it's just really annoying because it freezes all the time. A little summary of the last few days:

I arrived at Zurich airport Monday morning 8 am. I was tired, really tired. I didn't sleep at all in the plane because it was so uncomfortable. And there were some good movies on, haha. My parents and sis were there but also a few friends: Celina, Manuela, Anita, Nadja and Julia (I just tell you the names because in the future I will probably tell more about them). Yup, we all said hello, chatted for a while and then me and my family left. We went to my grandparents'. They, too, were really excited and stuff. It was cool to see them again, I am pretty close to them. After that we went home and I spent the rest of the day unpacking and around seven I crashed and fell asleep. I slept for 16 hours straight!

Tuesday was relaxing day. All I did was buying groceries with my mom, the rest of the day I spent watching TV and stuff.

On Wednesday morning I went to school. That meant getting up at 6:15 in order to catch the train at 6:46. That was rough. But it was worth it. It was really cool to see the school and my classmates again. A lot of them didn't recognize me at first because of my haircut, but after a few seconds they knew who I was, haha. The math teacher who doesn't even recognize students after summer break didn't realize who I was so they told him I was an exchange student from the US. And he believed them! It was so funny. When all the others started solving problems he came up to me and said: Sprechen sie deutsch (do you speak German?)? and I started laughing and told him my name and it took him about 10 seconds to realize who I was, it was so funny. Then in physics the teacher didn't even realize that I was there, that was funny, too. And English was the highlight anyway. The teacher talks sort of British English and I just started talking in the (cool) American way. She didn't really like that, but whatever, haha. She made me tell the class everything about beautiful Vermont and about school in the US, I talked for about 10 minutes, haha.

Thursday was another relaxing day, don't really remember what i did... probably sleeping and watching TV.

And Friday I went to school one more time to go to the main office and arrange some things for my next school year and stuff. And at night i met with Raquel, Karin, Sandra, Isabel and Miriam. We went for dinner and in a bar afterwards (woooo-hoooo, that's what I missed most). we had lots of fun talking. I told them about my year and they told me all the school gossip I missed. It was fun.

And today I slept until 11:30, which was very nice. Later I am going to celina's house, we are watching a soccer game on TV and after that we are going downtown. I'm not sure yet what were doing exactly.

 

I totally forgot maayan in the last entry (if you read my lj, maayan, I'm sorry). Here it is: you totally have to come and visit me someday so we can watch a soccer game together. And if they are loosing the game we can tell the coach that we have an American soccer star in the stadium and she should get a chance to play!! Haha, that would be so cool, but I don't think it's possible (haha). It was really great meeting you, maayan, you are such a nice and sweet person!! I loved your (don't know what I should call it... poster maybe?) with all the pictures on it. It's in my room on the wall, so I can see it all the time!

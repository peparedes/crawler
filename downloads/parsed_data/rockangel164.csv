"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=3>I finally decided to get a LiveJournal...hmmm I don't get Katie...she's not talkin to me the same as before. Ever since me and Joey started going out she's been like blah when she's talkin to me. I'm so confused by her right now. Well she just left me and&nbsp;Joey is at work. No one else is online and I don't feel like calling anyone. So I guess it's time I should really start working on my homework. I've put it off long enough. I'm gonna play some HIM and get to working....yea right I'll probably be right back. At least I'm gonna try. </FONT></STRONG></P>"

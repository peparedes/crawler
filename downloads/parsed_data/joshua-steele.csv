Let me see. . . 

home . . . we moved, now we are renting a larger space from my wife's BFF parents.

children . . . Lucas and Asher are doing wonderful.

injury . . . Lindsay slipped today and put her hand through a window, 6 stitches to close it up.

work . . .my current employer is sealing the company, though I think what he is doing is spinning off the stuff he really wants to do and letting the rest go.

that about sums it up. I need to have better stuff to talk about, my last several posts (spanning most of two years) are gripes about employment. 

God, I need a life."

UPDATE Time!

~Physically, I am doing fine.

~Lindsay and I are still happily married.

~Lucas is handsome, and more importantly the fulfillment of everything I wanted.

~Sadly, on Nov 30 I will find myself unemployed as my current employer has decided to replace me with a lesser Engineer who currently has two weeks and three days experience with the grain dryer product.

~I have resumes out all over the country but we all know how the job market is. I have called a half dozen recruiters, I have an application in with Menard's Manufacturing wing, and am currently in the running for a job up in Thurston, NE. Twice I have contacted them to be told they have yet to make the decision, the Engineering Manager has been out in the field testing product for much of the last two (relatively dry) weeks.

~I thought about going back to school and getting my Master degree, but without a full time job lined up to keep us alive going back to school full time is not a solution."

I&nbsp;would be going back to UNL&nbsp;in Lincoln but would love to keep working for NECO.

As&nbsp;I&nbsp;see it I have three options before me&nbsp;(assuming I&nbsp;get in, I&nbsp;have to finish the application this week):

1)&nbsp;Forget it:&nbsp;If NECO&nbsp;will not let me go, and Lindsay and I&nbsp;feel we can not afford to stop working for NECO&nbsp;I&nbsp;will just forget about Grad School.

2)&nbsp;Work Something Out:&nbsp;I&nbsp;would love to go to hourly (currently salaried worker) and then the three days I&nbsp;do not have class I&nbsp;will just work 12 hours a day to make up for being gone on two of the days.

3)&nbsp;F*$k NECO:&nbsp;If they will not let me go, and Lindsay and I&nbsp;feel we can survive. I&nbsp;will leave NECO and, I guess, go back to Menards part time so&nbsp;I can go to Grad School.

Which option do you think is the best one for me at this time?"

I applied to Graduate School  today.

I&nbsp;want to go back, but I&nbsp;want to keep my current job with NECO.

I&nbsp;hope that we can come to a compromise (I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;take classes two days a week) and work 30 hours a week - part time hours).&nbsp;Don't know if it will work, but we can only hope. 

I&nbsp;don't want to have to give up the job, though I&nbsp;am having issues with the boss. I&nbsp;get the impression that he thinks me lazy and unwilling to change. Truthfully for those of you who know me, am I&nbsp;lazy?

. . .by setting a goal that all middle school and high school students do 50 hours of community service a year and 

Read the above paragraph carefully. High School students will <i>have</i> to do 50 hours of community service - I thought that was voluntary unless it was a punishment, does Obama plan to punish high school students?

. . .by developing a plan so that all college students who conduct 100 hours of community service receive a universal and fully refundable tax credit ensuring that the first $4,000 of their college education is completely free. 

College students who do 100 hours of community service get a $4,000 refundable tax credit for college education, so he is going to <i>pay</i> college kids $40 per hour to do volunteer work. That is money that the rest of us will have to pay in <i>taxes</i>."

The cost of the merger: $10,000,000,000 worth of tax payer money, and 25,000 - 35,000 additional jobs.

Add it together, figure each worker will get unemployment for (heck) the full six months (this is Michigan after all and their economy is crumbling), so at $400 a week, and 4 weeks in a month, that means $1,600 a month, 6 months means $9,600 total per person. Let's round it to $10,000 per person for simplicity - so we have a total bailout cost (these stage at least) of $10.25 to $10.35 billion dollars. All because they were unwilling to change with the times as technology changed and are now facing disappearing. Whatever happened to survival of the fittest - capitalism's defining facet against socialism."

Yes I found this from a less than trustworthy site, but then I found it on foxnews.com as well. So have at, the MSM is finally reporting on the Messiah.

"event","Despite what my wife says, I have not seen the 'errors' of my ways. Well, I guess I have I need to explain myself to everyone. I could care less about either candidate, I prefer Ron Paul and belief that we should follow the Constitution.

What I really want is the truth.

Is Obama Kenyan? I doubt it. In the pics of him as a 5 year old, he looks to be almost 10 years old.

Is Obama a muslim? Does it matter on this earth, why am I any better than 'that one'? I just want to know the truth of was he raised a muslim.

My primary concern is, I want to know the truth? 

As for 'my' candidate, supposedly John McCain. Why did he get preferential treatment while in the POW camp in Vietnam? Did he trade state secrets for better treatment (something he alluded to in his autobiography)? Why did he leave his first wife, and do we need another womanizing president?

Do I think that Obama will lead us into a great Socialist country? Well, Bush started us on the way, McCain helped, so if Obama follows, what is the point?

I personally feel that the government has no need to be in issues such as gay marriage, abortion, or health care. I am sure that you can argue both ways on all three points, but that is not the point here, the fact you can argue is protected, thank you God.

I am sorry that I stepped on peoples toes with what I said, I guess I should have prefaced my post more."

"event","With the stroke of a pen, or rather the resounding 'Yea' of Congress driven by fear the Democratic freedoms that we hold so dear, so true are gone. Gone are the days of America the strong, the free, the independent - replaced by America the Socialist, for the Wealthy, the dishonest.

Over two hundred years ago, a group of men got together and wrote 'We hold these trues to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. . .' Only now equality is something held for a select few, equality is something that we give away - to those who did not have and in some cases have not earned it. As this bailout throws another $700 billion dollars (from Mr and Mrs Taxpayer) at Wall Street - in the vain attempt to correct what they willingly and greedily did, the death knell of our freedom sounds. It is sound that few hear, a sound even fewer care about, it is the sound of the greatest Nation of earth becoming a cash register.

Is it little wonder that so much of the world hates us - I know that is a strong word, but it is true. We give so little freely of our hearts, even our charity is written off, and demand everything in return. So remember this, the 28th of September, remember it when they come for you. What little freedom we had will seem like a dream from some long past time."

Work - Work is going pretty good. I went to North Central Iowa yesterday to look at some power sweeps (a product I am currently designing), and hope to have a prototype designed here within the week, and a prototype up and running within the month. I have to have it done in six weeks, since they already have sold the prototype to a farmer for testing, up by Wayne.

School - I know that I have graduated with my Bachelor's degree, but I want to work on getting some more schooling, especially because work will help cover it. The only problem is the fact they will not help pay for Graduate School. I am now thinking about going back and getting a second Bachelor's degree - I say Aerospace Engineering, my wife thinks differently - Mathematics. Both would be relatively easy, well at least once I got back into the swing of going to school they would be. I have to look into it and see if UNL/Metro has a program in Mathematics, and offer the classes I would need in the evening or online.


Other than that, not much going on."

My Uncle is letting us use the beach house in North Carolina. We are looking foward to it greatly, I need a break from work. With that being said, why do I keep thinking about my project at work.

Wish us luck, it is Lindsay's first time flying. We borrowed her sister's DVD player and I debated getting her Snakes on the Plane or Flight of the Living Dead, or go old school and get Airport I & II. I didn't, she will be nervous enough as is.

Barber was in town, haven't seen him since he Graduated from High School like 12 years ago, hasn't really changed though. Never really hung out with him in High School since he was smart and a jock, and I was not really into sports. Zach and Damon spent a lot of time in High School hanging with him, and after he Graduated they found that he was a much a geek as we were when it came to gaming (be it computer, boardgame, or RPG).

The revisionist version of WWII starts with Russia pouring troops back into territory that Germany took at the start of the war. These troops manage to to liberate the captured territories before Germany moves in and retakes them as well as capturing two more territories from Russia. Great Britian pulls off an naval assault into France without the US and captures Western Europe, while in the Pacific they move their naval assets around in an attempt to get the Japanese to concentrate on them instead of America.

I played Japan last night and I think we did pretty good. I destroyed the American Naval forces at Pearl Harbor a second time before getting the task group I sent on the mission destroyed in retailation. I captured territory from Russia, the US (China), and at the end of the game (before we all had to call it and go home) India.

It was fun, though not nearly long enough.

On a side note, I made my wife very mad by going and playing. Well, more by the fact that we ran late and I did not call her. I texted her to tell her we were playing, I figured she would understand. I asked the guys and the consensus from them was 'Barber is in town, and this is the only night he has free.' and '. . .you can spend the rest of the week with Lindsay.'. I should have come home and spent time with Lindsay, and I am sorry that I did not."

But, I have dreams! I want to run, I want to bike, I want to go play paintball and not be the one hiding behind a barricade after fifteen seconds of rush, rush, rush only to have my body feel like it is going to die on me, like my lungs are going to explode, like my limbs will fall off. I dream of charging up that hill, diving behind cover, moving along the edge of the field, racing across the gap, sliding in behind my brother (using him as an example), and lighting him up before he even knows that I flanked him.

So, hold me accountable. We are planning on paintball around the end of April, first part of May. Whenever the field we go to opens, so I need those who know me to tell me to get off my fat arse and get out and move. If you see me eating or drinking something I should not be, tell me to stop, make me stop, slap it out of my hands. This is the favor I ask of you.

Now, who's with me!?!?!?!?!?!?"

I am still in love with LaLa, and we are rather happy together. She puts up with my crap, loves me despite the fact that I feel she is way too forgiving, and loves me for me.

Distance
I still live in Ashland, which puts me 35 or so miles from NECO, I am currently riding into Omaha with my mother, though that means getting up at 5 am every morning, and like today (since I worked at Menards) not getting home till after 10 PM.

Health
I am pretty healthy I feel, I have to see the doctor for my heart in Feb. I still intend to work out, though I have to find the time for a real work out routine, so I am intending to really hit once Menards is gone.

That is about it for now, so how is everyone?

But, that is not the point of this post. This post is about my other job, NECO. I really am enjoying my job, I am learning quite a bit. I now have two, possibly three, different projects in the works. I have to build a tower dryer, basically from concept all the way to a finished project. I have to pick up and finish a belt conveyor serviced dryer (something that was started by a co-worker who has since been let go), and we have a request for an oil-fired dryer for Russia. So, I have a fair amount of work to complete by the end of the year."

2. If you are playing cards for money, and find yourself up sixty percent, cash out that sixty percent, don't let it ride.

3. Tanya (Will's wife) probably shouldn't drink, or should drink more often.

4. I love Lindsay, I really do. When she said she was going to bed it was all I could do not to just tell everyone to let themselves out when done and go join her.

5. If given the chance to do it again, I would start the cards earlier, invite more people, have more rum on hand, but probably have the same amount of fun."

I don't think we need to spend that much money on me. So we thought about it, I kicked around Genji Japanese Steakhouse, Lindsay brought up Lonestar Steakhouse in Lincoln. I had mentioned Kona grill earlier this week, though that idea didn't go anywhere either.

But, we finally settled on something, we are gonna go the the Dundee Dell in Omaha for fish, chips, and pints Friday evening. Other than that, I don't think we have any other real plans set out."

"event","Less than 11 weeks till the wedding. I guess I still have time to run if I want.

I don't, some people at work tell me the worse thing I can do is get married, but I like being part of a pair, instead of a single. It feels good having someone else to love, to worry about, to take care of, to consider.

We still have some issues to finalize before the wedding, mainly paying things off and stuff like that. Since we moved I need to get a new driver's licence. WE are not taking a honeymoon until the spring, since the fall is the busy time of year at my work, being harvest and all. That reminds me, I need to talk with the boss about getting a troubleshooting manuel put together for the dryer product.

ON the subject of work, I have been there just over three months, I believe I should now have a 90 day eval, begin getting insurance, 401k and other benefits. I am a little worried about the few mistakes I have made, but I am new to the industry and mistakes, I am sure, are fairly common.

For a honeymoon we have differing ideas. I want Europe, while Lindsay wants to stay in the US, possible going to Hawaii. Whatever we do, I am sure that we will have fun doing it. She wants someplace warm, I was thinking of either England/Ireland, or going to the Italy/Greece. 

The above plans bring up the subject of money. I found out on Friday that NECO, my full time engineering job offers profit sharing. It is a small percentage of the companies profits, giving based on performance, it comes out in January or so. Therefore, this honeymoon thing I am considering will have the financing of two profit sharing checks (one large, one slightly smaller), and income tax return (from two people) behind it. I believe we will have a wonderful time."

"event","Update of my life

Work: NECO - my main job, at NECO, is going great. I love it, I am learning a lot, I am also working my tush off. On the other hand, I still fell that I am not quite up to the bar for what is needed at this time. Oh well, I am young, and need to work harder.

Work: Menards - my second job, at Menards, sucks. I work too much, need more sleep, don't get to spend enough time with Lindsay. They keep working me too much, and I have came to a conclusion. Unless something changes, by the end of the year, I intend to only have one job.

Life: I work, I sleep, I work, I spend time with Lindsay, but I spend more time at work than with Lindsay and sleeping. I need more time in my days, where do I appeal for longer days?

Exercise: I need to work out, though I can't find enough time in the day to do this. I know this is an excuse, but it is the case. I feel I need the sleep, therefore I stay in bed until I have to get up and get running to get to work on time, thus leaving no time to work out.

Apartment: We now live in Ashland, in William's basement apartment. It is nice, though I guess it could be better, I like it. I believe that we will stay here until such time that we can buy/build our own home. I know that is a lofty goal, but I believe that we can achieve it."

We got a new car. Needed since I have to drive into Omaha everyday now. It is a 2002 Oldsmobile Alero, I really like it. The gas mileage is good, 28 or so. But, it doesn't compare with the Escort at 33 mpg.

We are on track for the wedding, still working on the financing though.

We are moving! Got an apartment in Ashland, living in Will's basement. Nice apartment except for the seven foot tall ceilings which limit our vertical expansion some.

That is about it, job(s) are good. Life is pretty good, need more time in my day."

"event","Thought I would update since it has been a while since I have had a chance to do so. Anyway, work is good. Super busy, or is that all the driving I have been doing - every morning and evening. I probably log 130 miles a day in the damn car, the window time is starting to get to me.

Lindsay and I are thinking of giving the truck back to my father, something we have been talking about for a while. This is being brought on by our desire to get another vehicle, a newer one. We are looking at a 2004 Chrysler Seabring Coupe. The only big problem with it is it is a two-door vehicle and niether of us like two-doors.

Need to look into insurance for the car, since we will have to have full coverage for it since we will be getting a bank loan for it. We are still on track for our upcoming wedding, just need to pay off everything. Less than four months left till the day!!!!!!!!"

"event","It has been a week and I wanted to update everyone on the new job situation.

It rocks, I am quickly (I hope) learning all the commands for the Man Man computer system (runs on HP Reflection software), I am remembering several of the autocad commands that I have forgotten over the past years, and learning the hard fact (as recounted to me by Adam, the guy I am replacing) that you can design it anyway you want, but that don't mean a thing if they can't make it.

The pay is great (approx. $18-20 an hour, depends on how many hours I work) - it is totally salary, so I make the same amount if I work 40 hours or 50 hours a week. Normally I put in 45 or so, but you have to add in a current total of 10 hours a week drive time (since I still live in Lincoln) and the 28-30 hours a week I still work at Menards. I shouldn't complain, I want a house, I know what I have to do to get one with the two years I want it, and therefore I know what is expected of me.

Only problem is, I still haven't convinced my body that I need to be in bed before midnight, thus I am getting between 5 - 6 hours of sleep a night, and am tired by the end of the work day."

"event","Paint balled today for Paul's birthday celebration. Meant to stretch and warm up at the gym in the morning before playing at noon. That didn't happen. Meant to stretch before we played at the field. That didn't happen. Now I am sore, well not right now, truly. The iboprofen is doing a good job keeping the aches at bay. Have a couple of good welts, one on my left arm (close to the armpit), one on my right shoulder (slight, it hit at an angle before splattering), and a couple on my left leg (they didn't break when they hit).

A couple of important goals for the next few weeks. I intend to Paintball for my Bachelor/Bachelorette joint party this summer before the wedding. I am thinking a weekend in August, probably the middle of the month, though I might wait until September, I would like to get together and play another time this summer as well. So this leads to two important questions for this post:

<i>1) Bachelor/bachelorette Party Play:</i> When would be a good time to have this important game? I think something like the third weekend of August would work, but if the weather is a concern we could do like the first week of September (this is as close to the wedding as I want to wait, since we will all need a chance to heal).

<i>2) Another time to play: </i>I don't know if I can get a turn out like Paul did, and I don't even know what my schedule will be like here this summer. I will be working two jobs, I am keeping Menards as a part-time job, mainly want to get profit sharing this year, since I am already up to 600+ hours and it is only April, plus I will have my real during the week job as an entry-level engineer. So, maybe a weekend in July, thinking the weekend after the 4th.

I also have to get my arse into the gym, I remember last year saying that I was gonna get in shape before playing again, but that didn't happen. I am hurting now since I didn't sweat before now. I hope with the move I will be able to work out more, but that is another posting, maybe tomorrow or the next day. Check back to read more about my life.

Don't forget to two important questions."

"event","Still alive. Let me update everyone on a few different areas of my current life.

Roleplaying: We roleplayed on Saturday, last longer than I wanted it to, but we still all had lots of fun.

Wedding: My friend Dave is getting married on Saturday at 4:30 here in Lincoln, though I have been invited I don't know what all is gonna happen at this wedding, or how the reception afterward is gonna go. On top of that I am a little bummed about not being in the wedding, since Dave is in my wedding this coming October.

Work: I still only have one job, and that is at Menards here in Lincoln. I have not heard back from the place in Omaha yet, the manager who I will be reporting to, and whom makes the decision was sick Thursday and Friday last week so he is playing catch-up this first part of the week. I should know something by tonight, I will give him a call at 3:00 if he hasn't contacted me first.

Love: I love Lindsay, I really do. I am happy that we are together, and I hope to spend the rest of my life with her. Though sometimes we fight, and sometimes we argue I still love her and want to make her happy."

"event","Work: Menards has extended its hours for the summer. We are now open until 10 PM Monday - Saturday, and 8 PM on Sunday. This sucks since on the days I work I almost always close, so I will not be able to see Lindsay on those days until after 10:30 or so.

Employment: I had an interveiw with a company in Omaha on Monday. I talked with the HR lady for five minutes and then with the engineering manager for almost an hour. We joked more than interviewed, basically just talked. The job was covered, but he showed me what he did instead of just laying out what is covered in the job, he showed me the computer, showed me the invoices, the requests for difficult designs, and discussed the occassional out of office visits needed. I have a really good feeling about this job, he liked me, we got along, I did not ramble too much (well only a little, and after he did about his job).

Lindsay: Lindsay is now offically an adult, though I can't tell the difference. She has always acted like an adult around me, and one more day does not change that any. I love her more than ever, and look forward to starting our life together, and will remember to inform our children that when it is right, go for it, do not go for the long engagement - it really f**ks with you.

That is about it, got plans to roleplay on Saturday, that should be fun. Might have to work this afternoon, need to call Dale and see if he still wants me at noon."

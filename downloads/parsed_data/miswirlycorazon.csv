We got it in the nick of time, too, because college is just starting on monday! Although I have been extremely excited to go to college I'm actually feeling a bit nervous. I guess it is the new school jitters? I mean . . .I won't know anyone  . . .and I don't know how well I'll do. I guess it is just a scary thing. But, I haven't really tried to think about it as scary . . . moreso as an adventure . . . and I hope it will be just that :]"

"event","This concerns one of my ex friends~ (her name is bleeped out ***** )

i r rayrayrain (10:29:35 PM): i lent ***** this auto magazine at the beginning of summer vacation (on a fri) and told her I needed it back before the end of the weekend
i r rayrayrain (10:29:38 PM): so today
i r rayrayrain (10:29:48 PM): my dad is like we should get this magazine
i r rayrayrain (10:29:52 PM): and im like we have it
i r rayrayrain (10:29:58 PM): but ***** still has it
i r rayrayrain (10:30:04 PM): so i give her a call
i r rayrayrain (10:30:16 PM): and she is out with a guy friend closer to her house
i r rayrayrain (10:30:51 PM): and the first thing she says is that she is sorry she didnt call me earlier to tell me what was going on because i called her to see if she wanted to quick grab a bite with me
i r rayrayrain (10:31:15 PM): and then she is like ok sure just give me a call before you get to my house and ill run over there and grab it for you
i r rayrayrain (10:31:34 PM): and so i told her we would be there in about 45 mins ish
i r rayrayrain (10:31:43 PM): but that time was tenative because i didnt know for sure
i r rayrayrain (10:31:55 PM): and so she said that it was fine and to give her a call whenever
i r rayrayrain (10:32:23 PM): so i call her 5 mins away from her house as planned only to get sent to her voicemail
i r rayrayrain (10:33:05 PM): and i left a voicemail saying how close we were and that i hoped she was equally as close and to give me a call back
i r rayrayrain (10:33:20 PM): then i call her again when we are turning into her neighborhood
i r rayrayrain (10:33:31 PM): and again im sent to voicemail but i dont leave a message
i r rayrayrain (10:33:42 PM): so now we are pulled up on the side of her house
i r rayrayrain (10:34:02 PM): her house is dark so i dont want to call the home phone because 1 or both of her parents might be asleep
i r rayrayrain (10:34:11 PM): and so i keep on calling her
i r rayrayrain (10:34:55 PM): and then her dad pulls into the garage, but i dont think he could tell it was linds, my dad, and i in the car because my dad and i were in our work clothes and in the front seat and stuff
i r rayrayrain (10:35:21 PM): and i get out of the car to see if he left the garage door open so i could go and bug him but he didnt
i r rayrayrain (10:35:32 PM): so i keep calling ***** 
i r rayrayrain (10:35:50 PM): and then my dad is like this is really rude when did you lend this to her?
i r rayrayrain (10:36:13 PM): and i explained it all up to him and he suggested i call her up and tell a piece of my mind
i r rayrayrain (10:36:15 PM): and so i did
Last Abhorsen (10:36:26 PM): .....
i r rayrayrain (10:36:50 PM): and honestly if she had arrived i would have chewed her out so badly  . .. but it was a phone call so i was still polite
i r rayrayrain (10:37:12 PM): and then we left because we had been waiting for like 10-20 mins at her actual house
i r rayrayrain (10:37:26 PM): and then we go to the car dealership and she gives me a call
i r rayrayrain (10:37:38 PM): and i answer coldly and ask what is up
i r rayrayrain (10:38:14 PM): and she tells me ""im sorry i missed your calls there! my cellphone turned off in my purse and i forgot you were going to give me a call""
i r rayrayrain (10:38:18 PM): to which i respond
i r rayrayrain (10:40:15 PM): ""look, ***** , that was really rude what you just did. you had a responsibility to get back this item to me a while ago and the fact that you have not gone out of your way to return it to me really does not show me that you value me very much and i dont appreciate it. so if you would kindly drive over to my dad's house and leave it in the driveway I would appreciate it because i have already left your house because frankly it was outrageous that i had to wait so long""
i r rayrayrain (10:40:42 PM): to which she replied ""ok ill just have one of the guys drop it off at the door""
i r rayrayrain (10:41:47 PM): to which i replied "" no dont drop it off there drop it off in the driveway. and since when did one guy upgrade to guys? now i know why i was ignored. seriously ***** im insulted i hope to see the magazine there when i return""
i r rayrayrain (10:41:52 PM): and then i hung up O____O
i r rayrayrain (10:42:17 PM): and then she called again to ask directions to my dad's house again even though they are simple as hell and she should know them by now
i r rayrayrain (10:42:45 PM): so i told them to her and told her that next time she wants to borrow something from me expect a no, sorry, i'll want it back
Last Abhorsen (10:43:05 PM): dude, the girls got men fever
i r rayrayrain (10:43:23 PM): i swear
i r rayrayrain (10:43:35 PM): if i was anymore angry right now all hell would break loose
i r rayrayrain (10:43:38 PM): just ask lindsey
i r rayrayrain (10:43:55 PM): this is like the calm anger before the storm of crazy shit anger T______T
i r rayrayrain (10:44:07 PM): but im going to try to not even get there X___X
Last Abhorsen (10:45:06 PM): ""what was that ***** ? I cant hear ur apology.. i might want to pull out ur guy friends wiener when ur talking on the damn phone""
Last Abhorsen (10:45:10 PM): i would have pulled that
Last Abhorsen (10:45:14 PM): and felt so bad LOL
Last Abhorsen (10:45:21 PM): You might*
Last Abhorsen (10:45:43 PM): i still think the rumors are true
Last Abhorsen (10:45:44 PM): so i guess
Last Abhorsen (10:45:48 PM): they arnt rumors
Last Abhorsen (10:45:50 PM): just fact
Last Abhorsen (10:45:57 PM): because, i decided so
i r rayrayrain (10:46:00 PM): who did you hear them from?
Last Abhorsen (10:46:19 PM): EVERYONE
Last Abhorsen (10:46:39 PM): everyone just whispers or lightly says somthing after she leaves or if she comes up in a conversation
i r rayrayrain (10:46:47 PM): that it has gone that far?
Last Abhorsen (10:46:59 PM): no, just the ""yeah shes a whore""
i r rayrayrain (10:47:18 PM): yeah
i r rayrayrain (10:47:20 PM): SHE IS
i r rayrayrain (10:47:31 PM): attention whore at the least
i r rayrayrain (10:47:55 PM): i me for christs sake i have been nothing but an amazing friend to her and she treats me like crap!
i r rayrayrain (10:48:12 PM): this year i have finally started showing her my anger and she blows it off!
i r rayrayrain (10:48:47 PM): like when i was on the phone she was acting like i was pissed off to hell probably so as not to kill the mood with the guys she was hanging with
Last Abhorsen (10:49:20 PM): hmmn somebody's SHALLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
i r rayrayrain (10:49:33 PM): yeah
i r rayrayrain (10:50:25 PM): man
i r rayrayrain (10:50:28 PM): so upset
i r rayrayrain (10:50:46 PM): ill probably be upset for a day or two something fierce X_____X
i r rayrayrain (10:50:53 PM): and then ill get on with my life xD;
Last Abhorsen (10:51:13 PM): i dont think shes worth the engery ull use up in this
i r rayrayrain (10:51:22 PM): i dunno
i r rayrayrain (10:51:34 PM): im just pissed off because we have so much history
i r rayrayrain (10:51:36 PM): and really
i r rayrayrain (10:52:10 PM): most of it is her treating me like crap and me still being the nice person and absorbing it for her betterment and im just pissed to hell over it
Last Abhorsen (10:54:14 PM): well, rachel.. remember that psycho kid that sat behind me kicking my chair? - yeah the kid that u were all nice to because ur just so charitable?
yeah. Your nice, but u cant let ppl walk all over u anymore. I mean, i can always beat up ppl that hurt you but problems like this will keep happening if u dont put ur foot in the door and be like ""Bitch, this is MY house""
i r rayrayrain (10:54:28 PM): i dunno i must have issues or something because it always seems like im doing this with people =_____= im getting walked all over
i r rayrayrain (10:54:51 PM): yeah 
i r rayrayrain (10:54:56 PM): you are so right =/

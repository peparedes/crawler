"event","On Sunday, I brought Jackson inside.  His fur was brown striped with black, which is ironic considering he is a black dog.  Obediently, well, for him anyway, he followed me to the bathtub and meekly climbed in.  I proceeded to give him his second bath in twenty four hours.  He kept sticking his head out of the tub.  This was irritating because I needed to wash his face.  At first I thought he was being stubborn, then I realized he was snoring.  For the remainder of the bath, he remained asleep standing up until I dried him.  I finally discovered what it took for this dog to become tired. . .a two hour walk followed by an hour of solid play with a pack of dogs."

"event","It has been an interesting year, a year of change.  In retrospect, I really cannot say it was a good year or a bad year.  All I can say is that it has contained some ultimate highs and ultimate lows that brought me to my knees.  

In the past year, I. . .defended my thesis, got engaged (*grins*), graduated from school, experience the anxiety of job search not once, but twice, landed my first job, landed in the ER because of work-almost got fired because of it, barely survived NCG long enough to quit, had to choose between multiple job offers (I like that feeling), got a puppy, began working at Tech, survived NaNo (barely), found out my sister was pregnant, battled depression (not caused by my sister's pregnancy) and began working on recovery from NCG.  

Every year, I know I say that I learned things about myself and its true.  At times, it leaves me wondering if I can ever say that I truly know who I am and what I really want.  

I won't lie.  I am nervous about the upcoming year, of what new changes (known and unknown) will be coming my way. 

My New Year's Resolution:

- Communicate my needs and wants more effectively by stating them clearly rather then hinting
- Attempt to become more organize by keeping a calender
- Become involved with a new activity (i.e. Girl Scouts)
- Go to the dentist and other doctors now that I have better insurance
- Start Paying off Debt

Writing Resolutions:
- Try to write 500 words a day as a min. and keep track of my progress
- Submit 1 private manuscript to a publisher ready or not
- Finish editing 1 co-written manuscript"

On the plus side, I finished a short story.  Finished as in edit and everything.  I have started brainstorming a second idea."

It is so surreal down here.  Things would improve if they would just stop giving conflicting information and giving facts.  I just can't believe this has happen.

I showed up at my new job site.  Let me tell you, being in shock in a room with two counselors is an interesting thing.  I don't really remember any of the people I met.  However, my boss was very understanding and even surprised that I showed up.  I am going to see if I can run their information to cook counseling center tomorrow, but I have understandable been barred from taking any of VT cases.  Tomorrow I will start filling out that paperwork, and I need to contact the people I am shadowing on Wednesday.  But right now, I am going to see if I can sleep.

I also accepted the job offer for being a counseler.  I am becoming nervous because I sent an email on Wednesday but have not heard anything back.

What is it with people on the bridge not understanding the words ""Please evacuate the building immediately""?  I finally ended saying loudly much the police officer's amusement: ""OKAY FOLKS- OFF THE BRIDGE NOW!  Take your belongings and quickly but calmly leave.  This is not a social event but an evacuation.  We are shutting the bridge down.""

Long day.  Sadly it is tomorrow I enter the 48 hrs of hell.  *shakes head*  I was suppose to leave at 8 but left at 10 pm today after coming in about 4:40. 

At the bridge, I ended up taking a temp job helping this one kid make graphs.  I made 10 dollars for thirty minutes of work.  It really was not hard to make a graph in powerpoint but he could not figure it out for the life of him. 

I then headed to McDonalds for lunch before heading to D'Rose.  *makes a face*  I need to come up with a better meal in the future for my stomach was not pleased with me.

At the floral shop, Stacy again continue to piss off people in the shop.  Especially when she left promptly when her shifted ended and did not finish the order she had been on for over an hour nor give it to anyone nor clean up her station.  Also, it tends to piss off other florists when you daddle on orders and slip them into other people's piles without asking.

Well time to clean the apartment and get some sleep"

In the past few weeks, I have been bouncing from one deadline to another.  It never ceases to amaze me how fast breaks go.  I am slowly catching up on everything that needs to get done.  

Work-wise. . .lately I have been getting irritated.  It is not that the level of annoyance has changed at my workplace, but rather, I am losing patience rapidly.  One more semester.   One more semester.  I feel like the engine from the ""Little Engine that could"".  

Thesis wise. . .*coughs*  The data in now in SPSS.  I was hoping to have a complete draft by Sunday.  Whoops, I missed that deadline.   Well, lets see if I can wrap up this puppy and get it to Shoemaker by the Thursday the latest.  

Surveys:  I need to get those damn things in the mail today.  No more procrastinating.  It needs to get sent out.  I am several days behind on those.

Job-searching:  I am still looking for a job with no luck so far.  Not even an interview.  I am going to try to work a little on the job search everyday.  So far, I have filled out four applications, and I have three more today.  I also need to get my resume out on the online databases.  It would just help if I knew what I wanted to do.  

Writing:  I have fallen behind on quota.  Whoops.  I need to pick that up as well.  

*reviews above list*  I think I know why I am lacking energy.  *frowns*  It is too early in the semester, being the first day and all, to be like this.  

I cannot believe this is my last semester.  I have been running a motley of emotions (shock, rejoicing, petrified).  I am going to be amazed though if I get everything done by when it is suppose to be done.  

Well, time to return to the job applications. . ."

I just feel- I don't know what I feel honestly.  I think I have gone into sensory overload with the events of the past few months.  I am overreacting to somethings while not reacting to others.  I have lost my sense of mental balance and need to find it again.  

To my friends who have been there, I love you guys and thank you for the support.  I appreciate it.  There were several times things were getting too rough.  I appreciate the listening, and I appreciate being told to deal with it.

So here is my resolutions for 2007:
= Adopt a more positive outlook for life  
= Try to cope with stress better
= Take better care of myself- eat three meals, take my meds, go to the doctors etc.
= finish the coding job
= finish my thesis  
= find a full time job
= find a career path
= write 500 words a day- maybe this will help me with the first three resolutions."

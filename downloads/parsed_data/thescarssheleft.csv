"event","hey woop had one of the best days ever yesterday with hani:P  we went to cardiff and even cardiff in the rain is fun with her :P.. went to toys r us and spotted out the gay action man and then we went to the barbie section and saw my barbie,all the little kids keep trying to buy her and fightin over her and they riped the top of the box tut tut suprise suprise yet again hanis barbie is not thare at all. Then went to spillers and  got STRAYLIGHT RUNS AWESOME AMAZING new album, i say that everyone should go out and buy it. Then we started to make fun of people who just had really dodgey coats on haha they deserved it. Then we saw danny awal with his jacket on and even though he said he was going to his ants reception in the hitlon we and hani new he had that jacket on cause he was trying to sell people stuff. Then we saw the man with the spongebob ballons and me being the cool boyfriend that i am :P brought hani one heehee her face lit up so much. Then we had to dodge little kids trying to steal the ballon :|, everyone was jealous of the ballon even the old people! 
Then it was the hard part saying bye at the train station :( i dont like that part cause i never want to leave after a great day all i wanted to do was stay with han at the station or anywhere alsong as i was with her i wouldnt care where we were :P.
well over and out

Straylight Run 
Another Word For Desperate

And oh, the awkward ways,
That you recoil when I get close,
And oh, the awful grin,
That greets me when I know I'm alone,
So down on hands and knees,
Choking, gasping, dripping spit,
I just can't make good on any of these promises,

Then he asked me,
What does that mean?
What's another word for desperate?
Repetition makes an impression,
What's another word for desperate?
I won't be around here for to very long,

So tip the bottle back,
Bubble foam,
And watch it break,
We can all be sure,
Something awful's coming this way,
So take this medicine,
And measure doses,
Take your time,
Cause they'll tear into you!
They will, they will...
They will, they will...

Then he asked me,
What does that mean?
What's another word for desperate?
Repetition makes an impression,
So what's another word for desperate?
I won't be around here for to very long,
I won't be around here for to very long!

And they'll tear into you,
They will, they will...
They will, they will...

Take it apart!
Let it all go!
Holding it back!
It's all just so..!
Why did I care!?
How did it go!?
Wait for awhile!
And I guess that...!
I won't be around here for to very long!
I won't be around here for to very long!"

We were hyper and messin around it ruled. Carrying each other on our back and havin a who can throw a smartie in the air and catch it in their mouth comp. went to toys r us to see my barbie and sorry but i must say she is rottin on the shelf poor girl she deserves so much better than that.

Then we went to the welsh banks and like han said in her journal do we smell or somethin :P heehee met up with emma and the price gun which was awesome...i had hani so may times :P went to coopers feild where i fell down like a small banking thing i didn mean to fall...hani was in stickes when she saw me fall lol.

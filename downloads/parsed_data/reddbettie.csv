"event","My birthday was fantastic. My birthday week was even better. I had 2 dates this week. TWO! Thats more than I've had in years. <lj-cut text=""And now a photo journey of my week"">

Monday night, a bunch of us were sitting around my apartment watching The Incredibles. I realized that at midnight I'd be turning 21 and asked my friends to take me to the bar for ""one beer"". One. Riiiiiiiight.

I'm actually sad to say that my frist legal drink ever was a Miller Light Draught.

But then Emily and I moved on to better, girlier shots.

Jaeger = gross
Redbull = gross
So why would anyone think that combining the two would taste good??

Apparently, by the end of the night I slow danced with Tim to Sexual Healing.

So on my actual birthday I'm hungover and actually manage to drag my self to one of my classes. After class I showered, got dressed and headed off to the Sushi bar. The place was BYOB so we each had our own 40oz.

I really don't like 40s so I bought a quart of Yuengling

After dinner, I did my best impersonation of Special Ed before blowing out my birthday candles.

Then we headed back to the bar. This would be a great picture if my hair wasn't doing some crazy 80s flippy thing.

Most people's friends buy them a birthday hat or a button that says Happy Birthday on it to wear out to the bar on their 21st. I got a WWF champion wrestling belt with pinwheels on it. People like to blow on pinwheels.

I drank my first legal cosmo

And took so many shots that the mere thought of taking another one made me feel like I was going to throw up. So i resorted to using straws.

I got home and passed out as soon as my head hit my pillow. Everyone else stayed up drinking.

The rest of the week was more classes and exams. Wednesday night Emily and I went out with Bobby and Weiss. It was a cute and corny double date. I had fun. I didn't get any though and that makes me sad :(
Friday I took (and bombed) my physics exam and headed back to Baltimore. I met up with my online friend Chris in Canton. He took me bar hopping through a part of the city I had never been out in before. We had a great time and if you're ever in the city, get a pizza from Nacho Mama's at 2am. Its the best pizza ever and its only $8. Saturday Emily came and we went out to dinner with my family at the Macaroni Grill. Its one of those places where the table is covered in paper and they give you crayons to write all over it. My brother wrote ""small balls"" and drew an arrow poiting to my dad. Only in my family.

We came back and had birthday brownies and I acted like a retard again.

Emily and I drove down to Federal Hill and met up with Ian and Nick at Ryleighs. We had a beer and went from there to Thirsty Dog, to Ropewalk and ended up at Mad River. David (my old highschool boyfriend) was there with a bunch of kids I havent seen in years. It was great seeing all of them again. We stayed at Mad River until last call when I ran into my cousin. That couldn't have been more random. He bought me a beer. His mom later told my mom that it made her feel old to know we were out at a bar together.

Heres the final two pictures of my fabulous birthday week.

And if you can't read my shirt, it says ""You have died of dysentery""
And that makes my shirt cooler than yours.



I;m beginning to go through the phase of the breakup where I miss Ryan. I hate it. Its been 3 whole months and I haven't felt this way at all. I figured that I had just made the right decision so there was no need to miss him. And I know I made the right decision but it really sucks how badly things ended. How I could hang out with David on saturday night and things be fine and great and there isn't any weirdness between us. But I know its the exact opposite with Ryan and I hate that. I want to see him again. I want to talk to him and have CLOSURE.

Oh yeah. My layout seems to have thrown up all over itself. Anyone care to help me fix it? And by help me fix it, I mean fix it for me."

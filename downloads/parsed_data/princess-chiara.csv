"event","Well I had a really scary week and its only Wednesday ... On Monday morning a at 5:09 Am a police officer called my house to tell me and my mom that my brother was in a car accident involving 3 cars and hes was in the hospital! We rushed there and he was in a neck brace with a broken nose, bruises all over, blood all over him, and a burnt face from the air bag.It happened at about midnight that night his friend that was driving was drunk and hit 2 cars before hitting a 3rd car head on! He was then knocked out! Im sorry I really havent been around for the past couple of days, but thats why! The people at the hospital are suprised he is still alive .... Hes fine now though thank God! It really put my lifein perspective though and things that I cared so much about before mean nothing to me anymore! Thank you for the support of the peopple that were there for me through it and the people that I know will be for me after this ... Im just thankful kenny is out of the hospital and walking around! I dont wanna leave his side... So far I got the best Christmas persent ever ... My Brother ALIVE! I love you all and I promise to tell you this when ever I see and speak to youo from now on ...

"event","OK so I have had a wacky couple of days ... So on Tuesday I woke up and my stomach was KILLING me ... My throat hurt sooo bad ... I just felt like straight up SHIT! I got already for work, went out to the kitchen poured my coffee and got SOOO dizzy I had to sit down! My mom came into the kitchen looked at me and told me to go back to bed ... She followed me into my room and we started talking and I came to the conclusion that it was Stewarts office! I get so stressed out at work that I was becoming physically ill! So my mother being the wonderful woman she is hired me back (she needed the help anyway). When she called Stewart to tell him he cursed her out, and told her that I needed to go speak to him! So I went to go see him before going into my moms office ... He fed me a bunch of bullshit ... He told me he would miss me and he loved me and how pretty I was blah blah blah .. this coming from the man who would yell at me for the way I dressed, would blame me for things he did (because things were never his fault), would tell me how dumb I was, oh yeah and he would also introduce me to clients as the bitch of the company! nice huh? So I leave his office after our talk and Go to my moms office ... as soon as I was in My stomach ache goes away as the day went on my throat stopped hurting and I was no longer so dizzy! My only problem now is Jessie is so pissed at me shes not talking to me (I think she thinks I abandoned her), My goal is to find her a job that she can go to and not have to stay there! But she wont answer my calls ... and I found out from a mutual friend that shes talking mad shit about the situation! I feel bad now I dont know what to do!I had to do this for me ... I donno maybe I was wrong for leaving! Well I gotta go!

I really dont understand why I get called a slut for doing the same exact things that you have done over and over again ... My friends know how faithful I was to you even when you were with another girl ::cough MICHELLE cough:: ... I didnt speak to you for close to a month ... You were the one who didnt want to be with me remember ... so I hooked up with someone else ... When you called me like 2 days later I was shocked! ... I didnt think I was going to be able to speak to you for 2 months or longer ... In any case I WAS HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT! Even when you wanted to know specific things I gave you honest answers .... And the next day I get called a slut! Lemme ask you this ... How come half of America can hook up with people and have one night stands yet they are by no means a slut or whore? But when I do the same thing I become the biggest slut on the face of the earth .... Why do I have do I have to forgive you for Michelle, Dina, Melissa, Deseree, and God know whos else? But you cant get over Chad, When I didnt even have sex with Chad? ANSWER ME THAT! And please friends gimme your opinion on the situation at hand! Much Love ....

I would be in North Carolina right now ... I may have even been engaged this morning! I donno though ... 3 years is a long time to spend with one person ... We love each other still ... We really truly do ... but I guess it just wasn't worth it anymore and we both kind of gave up ... It weird though ... I have a date tonight ... well kind of ... its just him and I hanging out ... Its not really a date .. but I haven't been with ANYONE besides Matthew in so long I forget what its like ... Holding hands, kissing, having sex with someone else is gonna be weird for me ... not natural ya know? Is it horrible of me to be going out with someone else on what would be my 3 year anniversary? I donno Im soooo confused ... He is a really nice person ... I like him ... he likes me ... so whats the fucking problem? Nothing thats what ... I guess its just nerves ... Why should I sit home tonight and feel bad Matthew is with Michelle now ... he probably will be with her all night ... Hes doesnt feel bad ... why should I ... Ya know what Im not going to ... Im going to go out and experience something NEW! WOW I would make a great Dr. Phil .... I talked to my self through this whole entry ... I think they say that that shows a sign of genius!

"event","I am watching one of those plastic surgery shows, and I am noticing that everytime one of these people go in they start crying hysterically and saying stuff like its gonna hurt so bad!!! OK then why do it? You know its gonna hurt after the2 fact so unless your ready to take the good with the bad dont do it ... I am the first to admit that I am the biggest wuss ever ... I for every piercing I got I kind of cringed and kind of cried a little ... but because plastic surgery is something I have wanted since I was 13 I dont think I would be nervous or cry at all before or even through the pain ... I know its gonna hurt but thats what they make fucking advil and pain killers for ... I donno it was just on mymind right now so I decided to post about it ... Well, im out i'll talk to you guys later ..."

Matthew called me last night to tell me that a few of his best friends from boot camp died in Iraq last night ...

There names were:
Tseller
Schweitzer
Tremblay and
O'Shaughnessy

They were all so young it sucks that they had to die! They had so much ahead of them ... Its really sad! ::le sigh::

I see a flyer of some sort sticking to my window so I take it off to look at it ... when I turned the (what turned out to be a polaroid picture)paper over it was a picture of someones PENIS. I gasped! Some guy took a pic of his penis in the publix parking lot while I was shopping and put in on my car! What the fuck? I really fucking hate people! So I threw it on the floor and left publix OUTRAGED! Tina in your terms it was OOC! well, i'm off to finish making dinner!

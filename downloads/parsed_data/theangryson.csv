He works with kids about volunteering abroad.

Leave September 15th, come home for Winter Break.
Leave for Europe in February for 3 or 4 months. 
Get back end of Summer 2005.

+He said I would choose wherever the hell I wanted to
 go, and spend 2 to 3 weeks at a time there.
Also, I could take a week off whenever the hell I wanted to. This
is good. I could vacation in Flanders in my downtime.

Awesome!

I went to CCD for the first time in like a year and a girl asked me if I'd ever smoked a cigarette before. I thought that was goofy, but the girl was kind of goofy anyway, so I guess it was to be expected. It was weird, but I knew everyone and everyone was nice.

The other day Mr. Connoly got slightly irked at me (I really  can't see that guy getting genuinely mad at kids ever) because there was a group doing a presentation on The Plague in art of the middle ages. They said a bunch of stuff until I raised my hand and started rambling about Christian Art. Stupid girls."

It is believed that he would force his own children to beat him with a nail studded paddle until he bled. He would also stick nails underneath his finger nails,into his groin, his scrotum and his anus. He forced himself to eat feces and would stick alcohol soaked cotton balls up his anus and set them on fire.
<br><br>
Fish believed that God wanted him to castrate boys, which he would do over the course of many years, finally to be caught for kidnapping, murdering and eating a 10 year old girl. Fish claims to have molested over four hundred children. Police charged him with eight but suspect him on fifteen.

Because nobody was making a big deal out of it, I was not caught up in united mourning as previously, but rather, I think I was given some time to reflect personally on the matter at hand. I learned that no sort of loss brings us to deserve any sort of special treatment, because the business of comparing tragedies to tragedies is a foolish one to get into. I learned not to feel jealous when other people talk about how close they were, because any sort of bond we had doesn't need to verified or proven posthumously.

A Silver Mount Zion

"event","Today has been really nice so far. It's raining now and it feels like the first week of school when I hated physics and came home and listened to Christie Front Drive and talked to Amalia online for about a thousand hours. There's something about rain after school where all music hits you about twice as hard, especially if it's nice comforting music. I went to school today, and worked on my St. Athanasius vs. Arius the Archpriest project. Ceramics was good because nobody was being loud or boistrous. Everyone just kind of sat around and nobody cared that I didn't say anything, and people smiled and laughed when I did. I like when that happens, it makes me want to talk less. After that I came down with a horrible headache, so I went to pick up taylor at school and we saw a movie. Nobody was there, so we lay around in the aisles and got to talk during the film without getting yelled at. I had a good time. I went back to physics, and then came home. 

All day I couldn't stop thinking about how teen culture and what's cool is marketed around being rebellious and ""extreme"", so the only real way to rebel against any sort of infrastructure is to revert to a simpler, less extreme lifestyle. It made me want to live in a small house on a big field, and herd sheep and plant seeds  every year. Maybe it wouldn't even be a house. It'd be like a house in first century canaan - various cells and rooms for people on different levels or floors, with a big pod on the bottom for the animals to stay in the middle. I don't know where this could take place, but it'd have to be nice. It'd have to be really nice."

"event","Why is childhood meaningful? Experiences, the second source of meaning in life, according to Viktor Frankl. However, by all means, Childhood shouldn't be a meaningful experience. All we do is seek temporary happiness. I saw Peter Pan the other day, and that's basically what it was about. Wendy wanted to grow up so she could find meaning in her life. Peter didn't want to, because he wanted to dick around and have fun all the time. Why is such a meaningless early-life such a memorable and valuable experience? I don't get it. But I like it alot."

Joel's new machine = celebratory ACTION. We'll talk. 

Winter break started off like the world ending.

NOT WITH A BANG BUT WITH A WHIMPER. 

Me and will sat in my room listening to MC5 and Deep Purple, reading Calvin and Hobbes and Red Meat. This is by far the nerdiest use of a friday night I've made in a long time, but it was also REALLYFUCKINCOOL. 

We lost the debate, but it was just because my team sucked and everyone went in a different direction. Mr. Connoly said I set up a good argument, and it took the other team the entire time to dismantle it. I suspect if my team understood it, they perhaps would have been able to back it up...

I said that although there have been undiscountable advances in fields like technology, medicine, science, all of which make our lives easier and more comfortable, it is self-evident that they do not make our lives any more meaningful. The question is what the goal of life and the goals of civilization are, as obvously a civilization can neither fail nor succeed without having goals. The goal of indiivdual lives is to find a balance between meaning and happiness, and by any means, civilization should not hinder this. Although it is easy to live a long life of an affluent lifestyle, civilization has made it no easier to find meaning in life than ever before. If anything, I suspect it was easier to find meaning in a life of humble and pastoral simplicity than it is in a complex age of technology and communication. Self-sufficience is by no means the end all be all state of happiness - if anything, it is a wall we build around ourselves.

"event","Return of the King was amazing, although I was rather upset that they decided to omit substantial elaboration on the 4th Age, The battle of bywater, the statues at Cirith Ungol, etc... I think that was all acceptable, but thye just didn't get the end. It was too conclusive - a major point in the end was that there <i>is</i> no escaping an atmosphere like the one that seemed pervasive in the journey - an atmosphere of battle, adventure, and <b>meaning</b>. Much like anyone returning from fighting a ""good cause"", entire lives seem drab and anti-climactic, I would imagine particularly such a pastoral life as the one portrayed in the movie. I think this may be the most personal touch Tolkien put on the entire story, undoubtedly drawing from his wartime experience. I hope it makes the extended version. 
On the plus side, the rest RULED."

"event","at first I thought this picture was a fake when I found it though. (the oprah one)
'cause I can't picture her doing something normal and human like praying.
I thought her servants would do it for her haha.
oh man this reminds me. some weirdo in my state has a holiday display of oprah getting married. Like he made his own life size cardboard cut outs of her wedding party and designed it how he thought oprah would, and it's crazy. I don't quite get what it has to do with Christmas, but it is kind of funny. I saw it on the news. And then a few days later by coincidence (since I never caught where it was or anything) my mom and i drove past it when we were in cranston. weeeird."

I actually went to the south shore plaza after getting back to south station from ri.<br />When I got to the braintree station there were alarms going off and a fire engine...weird.<br />Scared the crap outta me. <br />Then, I tried to figure out when the bus to the mall was going to come. I saw someone from city year which was weird. I always want to go ""hey city year!""<br />hahaha.<br />The bus came...I then had to figure out what bus I had to take back to the station. I didn't know where I'd find that. I went to the restaurant near the stop, and they didn't know but told me to go to the help desk. <br />I was nervous 'cause I was so hungry.<br />I found the bus I needed to take would be at 8:20 pm...I then tried to figure out where the hot topic was...I went into pac sun and asked, and felt dumb. It was definitely time for food. So I had johnny rockets. Then went to Hot Topic. It was actually awesome for once.<br />I bought some jewelry, tights, tapers, plugs, skirt, and a pin that says ""rock the arts"" which is a donation to a charity. Which is awesome in my eyes.<br />I had to rush out to the bus, but the hot topic employees were actually friendly, and their store was big and quality. Hahaha it was weird.

"event","So not only were my dreams bizarre, but the rest of my day was too!

I realize I am almost forgetting to go to class, so I hurry and get ready.

I hop on the subway, and start to people watch. And there is this guy that has the hugest nose. It was  like a beak and I kept on staring at it feeling bad for the guy. Haha.

Get off at government center and the escalator to the green line is closed. So I take the stairs. Nothing interesting happens from government (green) to park (red). Once on the red line there I thought we were being hijacked because some dude was spouting weird poetry or something that was really scary. He was really loud and he was saying ""keep driving the train or you'll lose your job.
 Go to college so you can get a better job. Keep driving the train."" and yeah. It was weird. 

Then I walk to my class, stopping to give a homeless man some quarters. I never do that. 

I get to my class only to find one classmate leaving already, and then my teacher leaving as well. But the teacher stays to help me get my stuff together...he is really nice, and cute to boot I must add. haha. Anyhow, I find out that my art has been sabotaged, there is paint alllll over it. :( ! my teacher was like ""I hadn't seen your stuff in a while, I thought you had come by to get it."" and I kept on saying no I hadn't. That I had been busy and couldn't come to class. I totally told him he should go to the zine fair...that I have a table and that it's at some center at massart that I couldn't remember the name of. And the times it was open to the public, and that it was free.I hope he goes and buys my zine haha.
He helped me wrap my paper up.

Then I come OUT of where my class is, and there are like, five fucking fire trucks, etc outside and the cranes are up, and the hoses are out and the street on the harvard side is blocked.  (I take my class at the Cambridge Adult Education Center)

Then I am walking back to the T with my hugeass piece of plexiglass, and some guy was like ""are you going to the T?"" I say yes, and he is like ""can I help you carry anything?"" and omg it was like love but not really. I was like ""yes, please, thank you!!"" he was so nice. talk about the karma of giving money to that homeless guy helping me. 

Then I got home, yadda yadda.
Right now my roommate is giving a lecture to my other roommate for being a slob. Good for him, except that well he really insulted me when he was talking about the possibly of needing to buy all disposable silverware and plates and such, he's like ""but I am a jew and don't want to pay for that, I am a fucking jew"" or something to that effect. <laura inserts angry face here> 
Then he starts talking about hiring ""some brazillian woman"" to clean up for him. Jeez! I never realized how racist he was. Well maybe I did, but didn't want to admit it until he insulted my race.
and although I am only part Jewish, and have never made myself officially Jewish because I am still confused about religion, and whether I actually want to pick one and make it mine, I do really most identify with being Jewish religion wise. Even if I wasn't associating myself with judaism I still think  I would have been offended. I get offended when people call things ""gay"" as in bad, ""retarded"" as in dumb,  so why wouldn't using ""jew"" as in cheap bother me? I dunno but I don't want to speak to him right now, I need to cool down."

"event","So here was my monday. 
I went back to Boston. Made up my mind that I would pierce my septum sunday night. 
So when I got to my apartment I took some pictures of my hair:

then I researched a bit about where to get pierced. Since my first choice wasn't available anymore (went out of business hah) I decided to go to Chameleon in cambridge. Took the T and went straight there. I was nervous. Signed up, I was so nervous that I didn't understand when the girl was asking me for my ID. oi. It sounded like she was saying ""ninety"" ...wtf? I waited a little while as there were two people in front of me. I got change for the tip while I waited. 

Then it was my turn. The guy's name was owen. he was really nice from the start. I put my stuff up and then he explained to me about the piercing and I asked a lot of questions. He was so nice and better than my normal piercers haha. This was mostly due to the fact that he was calling me ""babe"" amd ""sweetheart"" and I am a sucker for that. 
So he said my eyes would definitely water. That I'd be really nervous but it wouldn't be painful at all. That was exactly true. He did it sitting up which was weird but I think it was probably better. When the needle went through a cry escaped my mouth but he calmed me down which was cool. He said I was doing great and that it was done. It was so much better than my nostril peircing. Ir looka hot. It's done with a retainer, and so it can either be invisible or shown off. I am trying to keep it invisible because it heals better, but I want to show it off too. 

I am supposed to sleep with it flipped up. 

here is a pic of it flipped down.

YAY!
then I went to hootenanny that was having a buy two get one free sale item sale. I bought two polo shirts (a penguin one and a soundgirl one) the penguin one is yellow and brown and the soundgirl is purple and bright colors with rainbow and heart pearl snap buttons. I got a pair of work shoes for free. They are black loafers. They look hot.

I woke up really early, have been sleeping terribly lately. 
My grandmother's phone was being screwy but I eventually reached her. I left my apartment at around 9:30 but didn't get to wellesely until around 11. We went to Paper Source. I bought a lot of nifty things. Indian recycled ads, an indian print, lots of big decorative paper, some scrapbook paper that I will not be using in a scrapbook, book board, long white paper, amazingly beautiful thank you cards, printed origami paper, ribbon, maybe a few other things but I don't think so. It came to a lot less than I thought it would which was weird. 

then my grammie took me to lunch.
it was yummy. we went to this new place that opened up where au bon pain was. 

I bought a present for Rebecca's birthday because it was today and I thought I might visit her.bought her a toy dog in a purse. 

Then we went to staples because I needed to find a certain type of knife for cutting the bookboard. I didn't find it. :(

Then I headed back, but stopped in Kenmore in an optometrist office where I got an eye exam and decided to buy some choice vintage frames. I found out that these pair will take a while to adjust to just like my other ones, because of my contacts not being made to fix my stigmatism and my glasses do. I also need to stop wearing my contacts for six months, since I have been wearing them to bed and have developed some kind of disease from cutting off oxygen to my eyes with the contacts...there's something wrong with the blood vessels or something. eep. I might have gone blind if I hadn't admitted it. 

Then I got home, chilled a bit, ate a sandwich, then my aunt called me back and told me I could come over for Becca's b-day. So I did. The bus took forever to come :(
I gave her my present. She was like ""how did you know?"" haha.

And now I am back in my apartment unable to sleep yet again."

I couldn't sleep well at all last night or this morning and it suckkkked.

When I finally got up I got dressed and went to Trader Joe's. For those of you that don't know, Trader Joe's is this natural foods store that's all over massachusetts. I went to the one in back bay. I got my beloved mango tortilla chips, chocolate flavored tea (decaf) organic sugar, artichoke raviolis, and lot's of other stuff all for a very cheap price of under $50 (it was just around that price). Also bought two of their canvas bags to put everything in so their paper bags wouldn't fall apart on me on the way back home on the T.
Das good. 

I am taking the t to wellesely tommorrow to see my grammie and to go to paper source with her. After I arranged that with her, I did some writing, fiddled around trying to make the accordion paper pleat thingy the way I wanted it, and then decided to go to porter square to check out the paper source there so I wouldn't spend hours upon hours when I go with my grammie. While walking to Paper source, I stumbled upon a Japanese mall. Omg I was overwhelmed. I bought all these amazing big sheets of Japanese paper, a vintage geisha postcard that's a hand painted photograph, some goodies for alaric, and origami paper. The paper and postcard were pricey :( ... they also have amazing vintage kimonos and amazing postery prints and such, and they have beautiful kimono fabric that has adhesive on the back, that's pretty pricey too but I may go back and get some sometime. 

yay!"

"event","I signed up for the Boston Zine fair last night. I am going to have a half table. I am working on a zine, one that's far more easy for me to write than my very ambitious and way hyped up A Guide to Life for the Misguided...I am not totally swearing off that zine, I just don't have the inspiration for that one and do have the inspiration for the material I am writing for this one. They are going to be extremely cut and pasted and very limited edition. So much so that they'll actually be cut and pasted onto the actual piece with various different designs and papers and such. I think it's going to be awesome! And they are going to be bound too, not stapled or anything. I haven't quite worked out how all the writings will be in one piece the way I am going to bind them, but I am confident that I'll figure out a way of doing it."

"event","I need help deciding if this still sounds cliche. Even though it's more important for me to like it, I don't want everyone to hate it either, especially since it will be pretty visible.  Some of it is pretty cliche, because it involves a butterfly, however, the whole LIFE CYCLE of one is very symbolic to me. I'd want to include this quote some where:  ""just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, it became a butterfly""-anonymous I'm thinking the images on it would be pretty stylized, though I can't find pictures of the two styles I am considering. I was thinking black and white japanese woodblock print with a few splashes of colors, or stylized like those french antique science text book-y illustrations. If I do decide to do this, I am going to have an artist design it for me.

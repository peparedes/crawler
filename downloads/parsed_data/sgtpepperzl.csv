"event","It was hot yesterday.  Hit 90 I think.  The Mets are just as hot right now.  And so am I, according to a note that was thrown at me at the UCBT with a phone number on it.  Creepy.  Maybe its my haircut?  Yeah, I cut my hair.  Pretty majorly, too.

Work is going well with the exception that I give up weekend nights.  Pizza is so awesome.  I honestly can't think of anything that could ever be as awesome as pizza.  It even beats out bears and improv.  And don't even think about comparing sex to pizza.  Can you put sausage on sex?  Okay, don't answer that.  Bad example.

Here's a fucking meme.

01. Reply with your name  and your breakfast food of preference  and I will write something about you.
02. I will then tell what reminds me of you.
03. If I were to apply an o'clock to you, it would be...
04. I will try to name a single word that best describes you.
05. I'll tell you the most memorable moment I've had with you.
06. I'll then tell you something that I've always wondered about you.
07. Put this in your journal."

"event","Hi, y'all.  Summer has been nice, despite being dismissed from Amazon Cafe within a day and a half of working there.  They seriously screwed me, and I guilt-tripped them majorly.  All's well though, because I've got two potential jobs that are just as good, maybe better.

There's lots going on this summer -- job, the Mets & baseball, UCBT & improv, cool stuff, cool people, etc.  The Mets are an exciting team to watch this year, despite not winning everyday.

The Fountains of Wayne concert in Central Park yesterday was absolutely fantastic.  It's a large outdoor venue, but it had a very intimate feel to it.  There was a small meet & greet area.  As I did last year with Liz, I met Fountains of Wayne, but this time before and not after the show.  And this time, I did indeed know where the guitarist's drummer was.  (see:  <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sgtpepperzl/22768.html#cutid1"">this post.</a>)

There were some drunk hipster dicks next to us who were real assholes during Ben Kweller's set (he was the opener, going solo).  After he opened with his version of Ice Ice Baby called BK Baby, some fuck shouted out ""How did THIS guy get a CONTRACT?!""  When Ben mentioned Fountains of Wayne, one of these guys shouts ""Much better!""  Ben whispers a sarcastic ""thanks"" in the microphone glancing in their direction.  Without trying to cause a fight, I say ""Listen, you don't have to like it, but you don't have to be a dick about it.""  They apologize, and nothing else like that happened.

Also, I got a 17-inch flat screen monitor from Dell, and it's AWESOME.  Makes my computer just so much more pleasing to look at.  Next computer though?  Powerbook.  Definitely.

Bought Yankees vs. Mets Subway Series tickets for late June.  Dave and I are going to wear our Mets caps on the subway up to the Bronx.  It's gonna be brutal.

Uhh.. is there more to say?  Probably."

"event","WARNING:  This entry will ramble, and there will be a lot of stuff I'm leaving out.  I'm doing my best to get all the highlights down.

SATURDAY:  Workshop with Armando Diaz, Ed Herbstman, and Abby Sher.  Awesome.  Saw Samantha.  Awesome.  Met up with Nick, went to Grand Central, Samantha went home, we had lunch at the Oyster Bar.  Went down to Chinatown, had dinner at Joe's Shanghai.  Went up to the UCBT, saw Respecto.  Very disappointing from them, but still a fun show.  It was only Chad Carter and Jackie Clarke, with Amy Rhodes and Chris Gethard filling in for others.  Nick and I made our way to Juvie Hall and saw some decent stuff at The Project.

SUNDAY:  Took the subway downtown with the intention of going to the Statue of Liberty, instead we walked back up through SoHo and Greenwich Village, stopping into the Flying A, the adidas store, among others, and then having a late lunch at French Roast.  But not before running into Marcy Braidman and Natalie Baseman on the street.  Craziness.  I love New York.  Up to the UCBT to see ASSSSCAT.  Benny and Dave met up with us later.  It was great to see them.  It was one of the better 'CATs I've seen.  Amy Poehler, Horatio Sanz, Kevin Dorff, Rachel Dratch, Rachel Hamilton, Miriam Tolin, Seth Meyers, and Brian Huskey were all there.  It was pretty fantastic.

MONDAY:  The drive.  We arrived in Chicago at about 11:00pm Central Time.  It was a really great drive.  This country needs a whole lot less Pennsylvania.  

TUESDAY:  Woke up early to get some keys made and hassled around for like an hour trying to get parking passes we realized we didn't need in the first place.  After some relaxing, it was off to brunch at Orange, which was FANTASTIC.  Nick and I then took a train and bus we shouldn't've taken down to the South Side of Chicago for a trip to the Museum of Science and Industry, which we arrived at while it was closing.  I did manage to catch a bit of the train exhibit, though, which pumped me up.  We took the same scary bus & train combo back to Wrigleyville (where we're staying) with Liz, where she met up with Andy and they went out to dinner.  At some point we made it ImprovOlympic where we saw ""Play"" upstairs at the Del Close Theater, and then ""Bassprov"" followed by Traffic & Weather/The Lottery in the Cabaret.  Needless to say, my first night at IO was a good one.  A bunch of us headed to Misty's for some beers, but I bailed early due to exhaustion.

WEDNESDAY:  Woke up, lazied around for hours, watched ""50 First Dates,"" and became a little frustrated.  Not necessarily in that order.  Nick and I headed downtown to check out the John Hancock Building.  We stood in awe as we looked up 96 stories at one of the coolest buildings I have ever seen.  We took the trip up to the top, but were turned away from the Lounge because of my young age.  Back downstairs we went for dinner at the Cheesecake Factory.  Nick seemed more in awe of the restaurant than the John Hancock building.  Joking.  Took the red line to Addison, and got some nice shots of Wrigley Field.  Wow.  Saw three Harold teams perform at IO:  Sturgis, Mother Russia, and Carl & the Passions.  Each got increasingly better as the show went along, in that order.  Carl & the Passions was closest to NYC improv that I have seen.  We headed to a pizza shop, got kicked out of a pizza shop, and proceeded to watch the best improv show I've ever seen outside of WeirDass (DCM '04).  Messing with a Friend featured Susan Messing and three friends, one of which was ex-husband Joe Canali, and two others whose names I forget right now.  Trainwreck was Dan Bakkedahl and Zachary Thompson (filling in for Ed Furman) doing a half-hour scene in ""real-time,"" which was absolutely brilliant.  As was Messing with a Friend.  We headed to Misty's for a cigarette filled party that made my clothes stink.

THURSDAY:  Woke up, went out to eat and had Crab Cakes Benedict.  Nick went off to see some people and participate in a free impromptu workshop with TJ Jagadowski that I wasn't allowed to go to.  Andy and I took the bus down to Lincoln Park, walked to Old Town, and shopped like MANIACS.  Andy bought an ice cream spade.  I bought jeans and a shirt.  Whoo.  Took the train back to the apartment, Nick met us there and we got picked up by Doug & Jackie Rapp to eat dinner in Hyde Park, the area where University of Chicago is.  Doug was kind enough to give us an absolutely breathtaking tour of the city of Chicago.  This was the best view I've had yet.  Spectacular.  We were dropped off at the Playground, and we saw one of the worst improv shows I've ever seen.  Sciatica, Bevy (six girls), Miss Hawaiin Tropic (2-person improv), Inside Vladimir all disappointed to what I was expecting.  Vladimir was only half-good, and the rest were pretty terrible.  Nick and I walked over to IO, and then back to Jon & Adam's where we took off for Eric Cartier's place in Andersonville.  Fun party, I drank a 2-liter bottle of Coke, and then we took a cab back home to Wrigleyville where I type this.  Nick isn't here, he didn't come with us to the party, I have no idea where he is.  He is a ghost.

<b><u>Death of a Playwright</u>

Arthur Miller passes away at the age of 89.

<img src=""http://us.news1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20050211/s/r1085406776.jpg"">

Milestones:</b><ul>
<li>Wrote ""The Crucible,"" ""All My Sons,"" ""A View From the Bridge,"" and perhaps the greatest American play ""Death of a Salesman,"" among many others.</li>
<li>1999 Lifetime Achievement Tony Award</li>
<li>He was a target of the House of Representatives Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s.</li>
<li>Fucked and married Marilyn Monroe</li>
<li>Pissed off Joe DiMaggio</li>
<li>Smoked a pipe.</li></ul>

<b>In 1949, famed New York Times theatre critic Brooks Atkinson reviewed ""Death of a Salesman.""</b>
""It is so simple in style and so inevitable in theme that it scarcely seems like a thing that has been written and acted,"" Atkinson wrote. ""(He) has looked with compassion into the hearts of some ordinary Americans and quietly transferred their hope and anguish to the theater."""

"event","I was sitting in Astronomy 101 today, which I fondly call ""Planets,"" when a standard cliche entered my mind.  We are all such insignifancies on this planet.  It's really amazing to realize that planet Earth is just merely a hovering sphere constantly moving throughout our galaxy, and ultimately the Universe.  So, in that mindset, I began thinking about how each of the little things we all worry about are even more insignifant than we as human beings are.  Life is just something we go through, then its over, and more life comes along.  The things we encounter throughout our 80-some odd years are meaningless and worthless in the overall course of the substantial Universe.

With that in mind, scratch that shit.  I gave a fucking awesome callback, and I'm fucking pissed off."

"event","Once upon a time..

It was the first day of classes for UMass Amherst's Spring 2005.  But it sure didn't feel like spring.  With the temperature hovering around the ten-degree mark, two feet of snow on the ground and more falling from above, students reluctantly trudged their way to the first of many classes over the next four months.

With the semester beginning anew, however, along with it came a wonderful opportuinity to create new first impressions.  So although the snow was falling, eyes were bleary, and the goofy winter hats were no doubt required, the students of UMass Amherst still tried their darndest to look their best.

After a day of classes and shelling out far too much bread on thick texts, I found myself on a bus from downtown bound for the blizzard roads of campus.  As the bus maneuvered its way up North Pleasant Street, I noticed one such individual on the opposite end of the bus who was obviously using this blustery winter day as an excuse to ""dress to impress.""  Straight out of a Hollister catalog, the individual was wide-eyed as she stared out the window of the vehicle.

Judging by the blank look on her face, I wondered if her mind, like the window she gazed out of, was transparent as well.  It was as if she was either numb to freezing temperatures, or was stunned that her daddy had not called her earlier in the morning to remind her to ""put on pants, it's January.""

I made my way toward to bus door to prepare for my stop, near to where our friend was seated.  I paused, turned, and glanced at her suede light tan boots with an enamored look in my eye.  ""Oh my gosh,"" I announced.  ""I love your boots, where on Earth did you ever find them?""  The Abominable Fauxwoman looked up and down at me, examined my wardobe of warm coat, lumberjack winter cap, gloves, and durable boots.  I did not pass her exam.  She drew her head back, rolled her eyes, and said the one word I dread - ""Yeucch.""

I exited, and walked back to my seclusion wrapped in a fireplace of sherpa.

Maybe she was trying to say the brand of her boots.

<b>Books Available for
COMP-LIT 131:  BRAVE NEW WORLDS</b>

One of the University's most exciting literature courses, with a heavy, but fantastic reading load.  I have the following required novels available.  Read only once, and appear nearly brand new:

<b>LINDEN HILLS by Gloria Naylor
PROPERTY by Valerie Martin
THE TRANSLATOR by John Crowley
THE GANGSTER WE ARE ALL LOOKING FOR by Le Thi Diem Thuy
TEACHER by Mark Edmundson</b>

I do NOT have the other required books for this course available.  Sorry, they're just too good to give up.  These five novels are also amazing, but I'm willing to part with them.  I will sell them individually or as a bunch at the best offer.

"event","I apologize for the lack of updates since the middle of last month.  I know how much all of you look forward to photographs of former Beatles hanging out with giant rodents, or descriptions of my incredibly mundane college-student life.  Needless to say, life has been eventful, fun, depressing, and I have not been deprived of my usual dose of stress and anxiety.  One could say I've been leading a fairly normal life.

I took a train home to New York from school on Saturday morning, the 18th of December.  Just the night before Six-Pack opened for Sketch-22, and it was tons of fun.  We came out and did a solid ten minutes of scenes based on the suggestion of ""Freedom!"" which came from asking for a favorite movie line.  The audience laughed bunches, and that's really all any improviser can ask for.  Long-form improv has found an audience at UMass Amherst.  Based on the success of that quick show, and the performance of the Evente at Ham for the Holidays, Six-Pack will continue to do shows at least once a month closing for Mission: Improvable on certain Saturday nights throughout next semester.

In addition, Toast has officially folded.  The remaining members will be starting a new improv company to debut early next semester.  The basic premise is that there will be a bunch of different teams at any given time each preparing their own individual long-form improv performance.  Friday night shows will include more than one of these teams performing their structure.  Specifics have yet to be decided, but rest assured Amherst improv-lovers, there will be auditions and performances for long-form improv come the Spring 2005 semester.

As you may have already guessed, I miss Massachusetts a lot.  Don't get me wrong, New York is the greatest city in the world.  It's more the people I miss more than anything else.  I think a roadtrip is in order.  Boston, maybe?  Or possibly Fairhaven, MA - Providence, RI?

Last night was fantastic.  I saw the New Year's Eve concert at Madison Square Garden.  Five years ago I saw Billy Joel at the same venue, and this (dare I say) surpassed it.  Sleater-Kinney opened, which majorly disappointed, I was expecting much better from them.  After a brief introduction by Ferecito (SNL's Fred Armisen), The Flaming Lips took the stage and proceeded to steal the fucking show.  The stage was crowded with sun-people, tassel-girls, furry bunnies, and of course the band, all dancing as huge colored balloons bounced throughout the Garden.  Wayne (the lead singer) proclaimed it the best show they will probably ever play.  The Lips put on more of an all-around spectacle than a concert.  They played more than half of their latest record, ""Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.""  Highlights being the title track, ""Fight Test,"" and the finale of ""Do You Realize?"" complete with a naked woman dancing on a screen hung from the top of the arena.  The best moment by far was the performance of ""She Don't Use Jelly,"" one of my all-time favorite rock songs.


Wilco's set was also fantastic, with ""Jesus, Etc."" resonating especially deeply.  ""I'm A Wheel"" was incredibly powerful, ""Hummingbird"" and ""Handshake Drugs"" were both amazing, and the crowd went nuts for the hit ""Heavy Metal Drummer.""  Jeff Tweedy wore pajamas, claiming he just woke up, and also declared his New Year's resolution was to quit playing guitar.  That lasted for about 20 minutes, but also resulted in a great cover of Captain & Tenille's classic ""Love Will Keep Us Together.""  An amazing New Year's Eve by all accounts.

I love New York City, I love the UCB Theatre, I love UMass Amherst, I love my iPod, and I will love 2005.  Happy New Year, everybody.  Keep safe.


P.S.  Fuckin' tsunamis."

"event","Okay, so my friend Shannon had tickets to the SNL dress rehearsal last night (when you request tickets, you either get the dress or the live show).  Knowing this, she had planned to make a scrapbook for Amy Poehler talking about her fans, improv, and the UCB.  On Friday night, she offers me a page in the book.  So I send in a picture of myself doing a Harold, a photo of a sign showing the Mass Pike.  I wrote a letter to her in the style of the Boston-themed improv show ""Wicked Fuckin' Queeya.""

Here's a <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/thefallonius/34974.html#cutid1"">link</a> to Shannon's journal with photos of the scrapbook.

<b>Here's a photo of my page in the book.</b>

This is how Shannon described the presentation of the book to Amy in her journal..

<i>amy walks out and luckily she came to our side. i handed her the book...
Amy: Oh my God!
Me:Its a book filled with fan letters and pictures and things..i can see it might seem cheesy but we really adore you!
Amy: Oh my god, thank you so much!
Me: Oh, no problem it was so much fun making it!
Amy: [opens book] aww, oh my god, thankyou, wait until my mom sees this! [turns to letter pages and flips around quick. lands on megans page] Oh, Megan!
Me: Yeah, she helped make it!
Amy: Are you in here? Where's yours? Have we met?
Me: Yeah! We met really quick at the season premiere, Im right by Megans page. [i turn to my page]
Amy: Is this you? There we are!
[my dad appears from thin air and asks if he could get a picture.]
we take one as shes holding the scrapbook open (i wont have it for a while, its not digital, but ill post it soon enough!)
[he walks away]
Me: Would you mind taking a picture with me for this camera?
Amy: Would I? [sarcastically] no, no, no pictures, please.
Amy: [keeps flipping through.] this is so great, thank you so much! whats your name again?
Me: Shannon.
Amy: Shannon; great! this is so sweet!
People were calling her to the other side and she kept saying thankyou and then said thankyou again before she got into her car. she was so super sweet.</i>


And this is a coversation I just had with her...

R4PT75: did u read my post??
SgtPepperZL: um, YES!
R4PT75: i have something cool to tell you. :-)
SgtPepperZL: you do???
R4PT75: she opened the scrapbook and saw the first few ages and then turns to your page (im not exaggerating) and looks and it and the pics and goes ""Oh my God!!!""  ...so that was cool. :-)
R4PT75: *pages
SgtPepperZL: really???!!!
R4PT75: yes!
SgtPepperZL: i just wet myself.
SgtPepperZL: :-[
SgtPepperZL: what was she ""ohmygoding"" about?  the picture of the mass pike sign?
R4PT75: hahaha its cool.  it happens
R4PT75: im not exactly sure. i think it was the whole thing, she just ran her hands over the page and the pics and ssaid ""Oh my God!  thankyou!!""  i was afraid she might be in a rush and be like ""oh thanks!"" and hop into her twn car but she was sos uper sweet
SgtPepperZL: i can't fucking wait a week from tonight.. i'm SO going to asssscat"

Not the original Stanley Kubrick version with Jack Nicholson & Shelley Duvall, this is the TV remake from a few years ago with Steven Weber and Rebecca DeMornay.  Supposedly this is supposed to be a whole lot more like the book (which I've never read) compared to the original movie.  I don't understand it!!  Somebody explain why this scary shit happens.

The Holiday season in New York City is fantastic.  It doesn't matter how cold it is outside (see: Fitzgerland, Ella), just walking around Rockefeller Center or up and down 5th Avenue.  There's a sense in the air that everybody's blood is made of hot cocoa.....  okay, that didn't come out as pretty as I had planned.

Charlie Brown complains about the overwhelming materialism that he sees everywhere during the Christmas season. Lucy suggests that he become director of the school Christmas pageant, and Charlie Brown accepts, but it proves to be a frustrating struggle. When an attempt to restore the proper spirit with a forlorn little fir Christmas tree fails, Charlie Brown needs Linus' help to learn what the real meaning of Christmas is."

"event","<b>The Stella show</b> in Northampton was fucking amazing.  Not only did I meet two of my idols, but I also got to PERFORM WITH THEM.  I was called up on stage for a bit called ""Zots & Crambles.""  Oh, and I was called a retard.  SWEET!  Also, Alison cried.  Pictures and detailed account to follow.

<b>Ham for the Holidays</b> went amazing.  An all-around fantastic show that featured Mission Improvable, Sketch-22, and my first performance of the semester with the world debut of Six-Pack.  We raised almost $150 for the MSPCC, and collected tons of canned foods.

As Toast continues to hold weekly Tuesday workshops on different topics of long-form improv, the future of the group is unknown.  There are four workshops left until the end of the semester (including Steph's character workshop this Tuesday, which I can't attend).  A proposed show date of December 17th has been scrapped due to Sketch-22's end-of-semester show.

Six-Pack will continue to rehearse new forms, and the possibility for doing monthly shows closing for Mission has become the most likely scenario.  Because I don't like doing homework, and I become obsessed with hobbies far too easily, I've created Mix-Pack Volume 1.  This mix album was created on Saturday afternoon in preparation for the Six-Pack show.  Originally the plan was to just get a Fountains of Wayne and Andrew W.K. song on a disc together, but I like this mix so much, I'm going to do it more often.

The mix is available for download <a href=""http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPublishedPlaylist?id=159573 "">here</a>.  You must have iTunes for the link to work.  If you don't have iTunes, what are you waiting for?  Download it for free <a href=""http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/"">here</a>.

I'm going home on Tuesday.  I'm leaving leaving my dorm on Tuesday afternoon around 2:30pm, and I'll be back on Sunday around 5:00pm.  Those of you in the New York area, I'd love to get together, so drop me a line.

Oh yeah, I bought a video of old Twilight Zone episodes for eight bucks, then realized I don't have a VCR in my dorm, only a DVD player.  Then I found out that you can get the Twilight Zone on DVD.  So I'm really dumb.  Does anybody on campus have a VCR and want to watch some really classic Twilight Zone episodes?

<b>***EDITED**</b>

I've got these.. brand new in perfect condition, with all earpiece sizes and the case & box:

I'd like to trade for these (I don't need the remote, just the earphones):

I might be willing to shell out a few bucks instead of, or in addition to the trade.  Who can help me out?  C'mon.. it HAS A PRETTY LITTLE CASE, PEOPLE!!  I want to avoid the ridiculous store prices and shipping costs for these products."

"event","Yesterday was intense.  Two exams in back-to-back classes.  Comm 121?  BAM!  Psych 100?  POW!  The rest of the week will be a piece 'o cake.  My Wednesdays and Fridays are always light, only two classes, and Thursday is a national holiday mostly for grandmas and grandpas who tell stories about Dubya-Dubya-Two.

Yesterday Domino's Pizza taped a flyer to my door with a bunch of coupons on it.  One of them is called ""WACKY WEDNESDAY.""  The deal is for one medium, 1-topping pizza for $3.99.  WOWZERS!  That sure is WACKY!!

The days leading up to Thanksgiving break are jam-packed.  Tonight I plan on seeing ""Curse of the Starving Class.""  It's one of the semester's plays being presented by the Theater Department, and I've actually been really looking forward to seeing it.  We studied this play in Acting last spring, and its fantastic.  After that's over, we'll inevitably have a number of blitzkrieg rehearsals to prepare for <b>Ham for the Holidays</b> at <b>8:00pm</b> in <b>Campus Center 163</b> on <b>November 20th</b>.

On the 18th I plan to catch a performance of the Guild's ""Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.""  I've heard mixed things, but listening to comments of the cast and E-Board, I've been promised better than expected, but I'm not anticipating a ""Sunday in the Park with George""-type of brilliance.  (Speaking of which, ""Blood Brothers"" was nearly a year ago.  Fuck.)

One day after that is the much anticipated Stella at Pearl Street in Northampton.  This would be my fourth or fifth time seeing Stella, and I am PUMPED.  Exciting new revelations have even suggested that Gabe Millman, Stella fan and old French Woods friend of mine, might be coming to Amherst for that weekend, which would just make things more awesome.

Soon after all of this on the 23rd, I head home for an extended Thanksgiving break.  I hope its relaxing and comforting.  That's what it's supposed to be, right?  I originally was planning to leave around noon, but I changed that yesterday to a 4:00 departure, as I must be sitting at my computer at 2:00pm on that day to try and register for all the classes I want.  I've worked out a pretty good one, although it prevents me from taking some classes I wanted to enroll in.  Anybody have opinions on these classes/professors?

French 120:  Elementary French II with Doug Thompson
Comp-Sci 105:  Computer Literacy with William Verts
Education 524:  Work of the Middle/High School Teacher with Irving Seidman
Communications 118:  Interpersonal Communication with Stephen Olbrys
Communications 287:  Advertising as Social Communication with Sut Jhally
and MAYBE Astronomy 101:  The Solar System with Judith Young

Okay, time for the Picture of the Day.

"event","People really seem to be enjoying the totally random images I've been illegally linking to other sources at the end of my entries.  So, I've decided to institute of PICTURE OF THE DAY program.  This will continue until I get bored with it, or it has to be put on hiatus because of inadequate computer/internet access.  So, without further ado.. I start off the PICTURE OF THE DAY program with a mega-entry.  Not one, not two, but three pictures of devil babies.

"event","Fun weekend after a torturous week.  Things seem to be shaping up.  I taped some train schedules to my wall right next my desk.  Yeah, I would.  But they make me really happy, so BACK OFF.  Choo-fucking-choo.  Next up, Woody Allen and various other posters to make visitors to my room believe me to be supercool.

Looks like I'm officially dropping the darn theater major.  Looking ahead to pre-reg in the near future, it seems as though I won't be taking any theater classes for the first time in about six years.  As one would imagine, that's a big deal.  Tenative classes for next semester:
- Education 524: Work of the Middle and High School Teacher
- French 120:  The Continuing Pursuit of Lowering My GPA
- Communications 118:  Interpersonal Communication
- Astronomy 101: The Solar System
- R2 Requirement (Linguistics 201: Intro to Ling Theory, Math 113: Math for Elementary School Teachers, or Comp-Sci 105: Computer Literacy)

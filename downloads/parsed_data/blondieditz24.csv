"event","<P>I can feel it in my heart that it is not God's will for me to go to Venezuela with my church on a missions trip. At first I was like, ""I really want to go!!"" but I guess that was exactly what it says. It what I wants, not God. Im totally cool with not going, I mean, Ill miss out on some great fun and things like that but I know that I can impact the world just as much here as down there. This weekend has not gone as what I had hoped for, it was long, dreadful and boring just like all the others. Ryan texted me yeseterday morning first bragging about how he loves his new girlfriend (basically saying he never loved/cared for me), then he calls me a stupid bitch and tells me to never text him again when he texted me in the first place. How can I learn to trust and love people when the people who I thought cared for me and thought we were cool goes and does things like this? I just don't get men. Im starting to believe that there is nothing to get, theyre just&nbsp;heartless creatures trying to ruin my life. At least I know there are a small number of men out there that are genuine and caring about someone's feelings. Its just too bad that I don't have a chance with any of them. </P>"

Most people make me feel very stupid and insignificant. I cant think as fast as others, so when people want an answer right away I just say something and its always really stupid. If they would let me have time to think, then maybe it wouldnt be so bad. About half the teachers make me feel that way too, they think that we should know the answer to every question in advance. I dont even know where all this time is going. I feel like Im wasting my life away. Its like having a tea party with teddy bears, no one to really talk to, wasting everything, and its all just pretend. I still have a huge essay for english, I hate writing. I guess I have to go do it now, at least afterwards at 3am my stress level will go down.</FONT> </FONT>"

I feel as I almost have a normal life. Im pretty busy though with all the things going on. The only thing that I can think of is my sister's wedding. Shes rushing into things way to quickly. Shes been engaged for almost a year now, but just last week she chose the date.... January 14th, just in a little over two months!! That is not enough time to plan a wedding. Since her wedding is apostolic, because she is now, everything is really plain. She doesnt even kiss her husband at the end!! Then she expects me to wear a skirt and a sweater as a bridesmaid. Its supposed to be a gown! There arent even any flowers at the wedding, no boquets... its creepy. I just hope that her marriage will go well. She did something really bad too, she didnt even tell my dad they had a date picked out, my mom brought it up and it really surprised my dad. Anyways, its all her problems, all I have to do is pray about it. I hope my wedding is a lot better than that. My mom and I have really been getting along well, its pretty good actually. I don't&nbsp;dislike her very much&nbsp;anymore. I can have a normal conversation. Well I must be getting on to bed, so Ill write more later, if I remember lol.</FONT> </FONT>"

"event","Everything was pretty good up to wednesday night. I went to drop off my dad's girlfriend's daughter at their house and my dad and I finally got another little chance to talk. He took me out to his new truck and we sat in it for warmth and privacy. He pulled out a little box and I opened it up to a simple diamond ring. He told me that he was going to give it to Becky (his girlfriend), so she wouldnt have to worry so much about him always being gone. He just wants her to know that he isnt just keeping her because of the baby. His plan was to ask her on friday and go out to celebrate saturday evening, so he was going to have me babysit. That shook me up, cried a little on the way home, but realized I could do nothing except be happy for him and support him in his decision. Thursday morning I did a little workout by myself on the east side and came back and left for Youth Convention in Rochester. Youth convention just isnt what it used to be. It used to rock people's worlds and give them such a rush of spirituality that lifted them up. Now its more like a concert and a sermon being shoved in front of them. The plus side is that I got to spend some time with old friends - that I wont see for another 10 months. After everything was over, we loaded up our buses and left. I wasn't in a very good mood because of all the things going on and not being able to see my friends for another 10 months. I thought I could always count on my buddy steve to give me some -just friends- affection, but yesterday he didnt. He wouldn't even let me rest my head on his shoulder for the little movie we were watching. This made me feel really lonely and I didnt know what to do. Tears streamed down my face and no one even noticed. When we reached duluth, without another word, I picked up my things and drove off as quick as I could. I was about to leave for my friends birthday party, be there for 2 hours and go babysit my little sister - which I was really looking forward to. My dad called me and said he didnt need me to babysit. They probably got into a fight or something, because he didnt sound all too happy about it. Im so lonely right now, I just want a good friend who can give me hugs without any questions."

Life has thrown a couple more obstacles in my way.&nbsp; If anyone really cares, I got into a car accident yesterday, were both okay but whatever. My insurance will be $100 for me alone, and so I have over $200 in expenses that I have to pay every month, and I only come up with at least half of that guaranteed, so Im pretty much screwed. On top of all this, I always have practice everyday for cross country, except sundays, and then of course I have youth symphony which the music is completely beautiful and chaotic at the same time, so I have hour long concert music to perfect in the next 2 months exactly. Drama also happend over the youth symphony's retreat last weekend, and I just ignored it, but it hurt a lot inside. Then of course Mrs. Walters chooses to do a very complicated piece, Beethoven's 7th, and so that is now also on top of my long list of things to do. On top of all this I have to ace it, get enough sleep, run like hell, and everything else while having a smile on my face during this very stressful time. I hope you all are having a good time and I bid you goodnight.</FONT> </FONT>"

I want to so bad to see my friends sing for joy and raise their hands up to God in one accord. Ive tried ever so desperately to get my best friend, to come to youth group at least. The closest I can get her there is talking about it. I try talking to her with it, but she doesnt even mention God, its about the people. She says shell be too much of a flirt... ?? I dont know what she means by that but Ill have to stay by her side until she needs me, like always. It hurts me to see great people like her fall away from all the good things of this world and wander off in paths that should never be traveled by people. I cant have my friends keep falling, I am their only hope and theyre pulling me down, but I cant bear to let them go so far down. I need a mentor to guide and help me, so I dont fall myself. Camp was the permanent life changer for me. I can stay in God's presence all week, not just sunday/wednesday. Someone must be praying for me out there, God has been truely blessing me.

Today I went to Valleyfair with my youth group and all the other youth groups of minnesota of the assemblies of God were there. It was an awesome time. Kaley and I were together and then we ran into my friend Jason from Fergus Falls and some of his friends and we all hung out for almost the whole time. Jason is a big sweetheart and I wish he didnt live so far. I like him a lot, but the reality of it all kicks in and I know it would be way too hard to have such a distant relationship. I linked arms with him and kaley and I was skipping around doing the wizard of oz skip, and then I let go. He said ""aw, I wanted you to hold on to my arm"" in a sweet and kind way, so I just smiled, grabbed hold and kept skipping a long. It may seem childish, but I would rather have a childish love than an adult one to where you have to worry about what youre going to wear or any sexual tension. Well it was just a sweet guesture, then on the last ride of wild thing he asked if I wanted to sit by him and of course I said yes, and it was all good in the end. The goodbye hugs are never happy, but at least I know I get to see him again in October, but after that it will be until next august at Lake Geneva Christian Camp. I thought it was sweet how he shaved all his facial hair off just for me but let the little thing under his lip go, so that was nice of him. He says 'there is just something about your hair"" - he likes playing with it and touching it. I like doing the same to his, but its sort of hard because he is 6'4 1/2 and has to bend down so I can lol. Well I must be getting to bed, I have an interview in the morning at Bixby's Cafe, so I hope I make a good impression.

For every little happy moment I have had with him, there has been at least 10 moments where I have spent alone, deserted, crying, and disappointed. I dont have much to say I guess, other than my life hasnt had much meaning this summer. No one has called me, no fun little surprises from friends. Nothing but too much running, movies, starting at the cieling while lying in my bed. Memories come to me to taunt me, of all the mistakes and regrets I have hidden away in my mind. When Im with him now and am happy, I am bombarded with the memory of that one night in january. I got pushed off the edge so unexpectedly, he made me feel that bad. He forced me into that deep despair, which now I must pay. I want to cut him off from my life. I just need to figure out a way. Hes such a jerk, he always wants me to squish into his schedule and I cant bear it any longer, I need to end this and start healing, how I was til he came into my life again. Bastard...</FONT></P>"

"event","<FONT color=#ffcc99><FONT size=2>Excuse my language, but Ryan is a little fucker. He is such a mean dumbass, he thinks that I should basically conform to his schedule. UGH GAR!!! Anyway right when I got back from an 8 hour beach day, we finally get to talk on the phone and hes like hey, Ive been at my hockey tournament for 3 days. Im like thats nice.... I didnt know that. He was like, oh really? oops... he didnt even say sorry, what a fucker, and he thinks that we should still be together?? He never does ANYTHING sweet or nice or thoughful for me. Yes, hell buy me a birthday present and bring me to movies, but thats it. Its all about money, I need something thoughtful and nice to come out of his mouth to me. Ugh that really pisses me off. Then I tell him about my wonderful day and hes like oh thats nice, and IM like what are you doing right now and hes like Im fishing with Alex and Brandon and Im like thats cool. Then hes like sorry I gotta let you go because my phone has low battery and I still have to call my mom. So Im like okay, and his phone cut out so I just hung up. WHAT A FUCKER UGH I REALLY DO ALMOST HATE HIM SOMETIMES FOR TREATING ME LIKE THAT!!! ANyways, enough with the bad. Experiences like what I had today make me not like Ryan even more. Anyways Ill start from the beginning, I have nothing to do and I feel talkative so Ill tell just about every detail. Okay, I woke up this morning at like 930, and I knew I had to get up for church, but Im like ""Oh I dont want to go to school, Ill just sleep in and skip it."" then I realized DANG its church, I really need to go. Then I got ready and realized it was at park point today so I got ready for swimming and my mom gave me another little driving lesson about the clutch on a hill and the balance point and crap. SO anywho, I finally get there and its a good service and stuff, soaking up the HOT HOT sun. Then I eat a little and we all go out for a swim and its all gravy. Then on my way back I call up danielle and was like OMG we should go to the icehouse!! Then shes like sure, Ill be over in a little bit. As soon as Becky drops me off, I go inside my house and then look in my kitchen for the time. Then Im like whoa my phone is on silent so I better not miss danielle's call. Then I look at it and as soon as its in my hand, she calls, cool. So I get ready and shes like there like 1 minute after she calls and were off to the ice house. Then when we get there there are 2 guys already there and turns out I know them, but not too well. Basically from when I was little. ANywho... were all jumping off and crap, when danielle and I see these two jet ski people. They were sorta close to the ice house but then left again. I told danielle if they come back I should yell if we can get a ride, so we just laugh and were still up there. Then danielle jumps and they come back Im like sweet, so I yell out, ""hey, can I get a ride??"" and hes like sure, jump off and get on. So Im like OMG SWEET! Ive never gone before... So anywho, his buddy jumps off and gives me his lifejacket and Im on. He and danielle are talking up on the icehouse. Then he gives me a ride and it was so much fun!! He was really good looking too. During the slow spots we would talk and stuff. He said his name was Jeramiah, and I told him mine. Then hes like, do you wanna check out that boat over there?? Im like sure... then hes like what the heck is it, coast guard?? Im like no, it has dive tanks in it so they must be scuba diving. Hes like sweet, thats about the only thing I havent tried. I just laughed and was like' Ive gone snorkling hahaha ': P hes like sweet where, and Im like Belize. Hes like YOUVE BEEN TO BELIZE?! Im like yeah, it was for a missions trip last summer. Hes like more of a vacation than missions trip. I said well it was a good vacation but it was also an awesome missions trip. Then hes like yeah, I went to Kenya last summer with my pastor for a missions trip. I asked him what church he went to and he said Prince of Peace, Im like sweet, do you know Marcus McGill?? Hes like YEAH!! Hes my buddy, hes the guitarist in my band, I play the drums. Im like sweet, I played them for like 2 months hahaha. Then he said he was 17 and was in Superior High School. I said 16 from central. What are the chances of finding a totally awesome guy, and CHRISTIAN who happens to be really good looking and is willing to give me a ride on the jet ski and just about my age?... very UNLIKELY!! But it happend : ) hehe... I need more guys like that in my life. He was really nice and curteous. Anyways... when we came back, danielle and his buddy must have been watching us on top of the icehouse, and then hes like, hey, can we give her a ride? (as he points to danielle) and jeramiah is like sure, but danielle is like NOOO WAY, Im not goin on there. Then shes like you come up here! And hes like Nooo way, and danielle said she wouldnt go on it unless he jumped off the deep end... so we finally coaxed them into it, and his buddy jumped down and sat on the jetski with me and Jeramiah made his way up which took like 5 minutes haha. Then I talked to his buddy and found out his name is Ben, and was going to be a senior at Denfeld High School, Im like cool, the only people I know from there are ELizabeth and Ryan Kent, Rachel Basket and Stephanie Huss, and hes like cool, I know all of them. He plays football with Ryan so that was cool. He said he was the sound guy for their band. That was pretty cool. Then Jeramiah jumped and all was well. Then Ben jumped off, and Jeramiah and Danielle got on. I was in front and Danielle was behind him. He gave us a ride which was really fun, hes like if you fall I got you and Im like (*aw* : )&nbsp; ) lol. Then when we came back, danielle and I switched spots and were going to go out again, but then His parents in the pontoon boat wanted to talk to him, and so he pulled the jetski back to the boat and they said they had to leave, so hes like alright, and then he dropped Danielle and I and we said thank you, and left. I thought that was really really nice. I like Jeramiah!! haha. I know nothing will happen between us, but its nice to know that there are still guys like that out there. Then danielle and I went back in and got dressed and left. Then got home and ate food and then Ryan and I talked and I got pissed hung up and came here. Well thats my story for today.</FONT> </FONT>"

I realized today that Ive basically been on my own for a good part of my life. Even when I was little, my dad would always be working or sleeping or gone somewhere, and then my mom would lock herself in her room for days at a time... then the occasional note from the office saying to walk home that day from school, then just to find out she was put in Miller Dwan again. Ive learned to take care of myself, Im fine this way. When people try to help it does more bad than good. Since my mom is finally over her illness, she actually wants me to obey her every whim and be best buddies. Its just not going to happen. My mom was out of town this weekend, so I stayed overnight at a friends house. We go to the same church, so we all got ready this morning and went. I wish I had a real family, mine has been torn to shreads. Her parents got up and talked in the living room for a while while the kids got ready and cleaned up for church. Then they ate breakfast together, brushed their teeth and left. I dont know if thats how it is in most families, but I would love to have that. Ive grown up thinking that a family dinner, with all the family there (just the parents and the kids), was something really special, even if we only had chicken, potatoes, and salad. It was extra special to be with the whole family, like grandparents, aunts and uncles (I have a really small family), which would only happen really on Christmas or New Years Eve, and Thanksgiving, with maybe a birthday party down in the cities. I wish I could turn back time and never take anything like that for granted. Anyways... Ive signed up for the park point 5-mile race on July 17th.. that should be pretty fun. </P>"

Danielle and I went to the ice house, swam there once, then the next day we went there to swim and the rope had been ripped off so we couldnt get up there. At first I just thought it was silly and blown out of proportion of how my mom would always check her email to see if these men off the online dating services had contacted her, but now I find it quite sad. Here is a grown woman looking for men's attention through the internet because she thinks that if they see her in person, theyll judge her too quickly by her outer appearance. She may be half right, but she also needs patience to wait for the right guy who will prove her wrong. This taught me that I too, need patience. I&nbsp;shouldnt have &nbsp;to settle for something mediocer (sorry for spelling). I got to see my dad on Fathers Day, today. Only for a little while though, I miss being with him. I bought him a nice gift and he was really glad. It pains me to see my poor little sweetheart of a dog limp around as he does. Great Danes are very noble dogs, who always hold their head up with pride. Here is my little great dane, barely able to stand, wearing little booties that make is already massive feet distorted shapes just so he can have a hope of not slipping and falling cross legged or splits on the floors. Bailie is looking a lot like my dad lately. She had to be taken to the doctor because she was getting really dehydrated, but solved by drinking watered down gatorade every ten minutes while awake. I guess my dad wanted to do something with me this week and&nbsp;I know his intentions are good, but Im pretty sure hell never find time before he leaves for the west coast and vegas for more dealings on thursday. I wish people would never ever make plans with me unless they dont intend to keep them. Thats one of the things that hurts me the most, people going back on their word or never fulfilling a promise. So am I too loyal to stick with these old fashion things like promises or am I a fool for trusting in them? </FONT>"

"event","<FONT color=#ff6666 size=2>I have no idea what is going on with my life... Dave and I are <U><EM>just friends</EM></U>, (but Im pretty sure he likes me)&nbsp;and whenever were alone together, actually me with any guy is just too nerve wrecking for me, I hate being alone with guys lately. I dont know whats wrong... I'm pretty sure Im over Ryan, but I absolutely cant date yet. Whenever Im with a guy by myself, I notice I never, ever look at their face, let alone their direction. I want to move on and be happy, but there is no one that I feel comfortable with. Even in a group I feel wierd around some guys. Don't get me wrong, Dave is such a nice guy. He treats me so well, better than any boyfriend I've had. Actually maybe the same as one, but lets not get into that. Actually let's... its somewhat the same situation. They both treated me really well, but theyre just a little too wierd for me. Dave is basically the only person I talk to lately because most my other friends are too busy. Hes a really good friend of mine, we have so much fun talking on the phone, but Im beginning to think it might be bad for me talking to a guy so much who I dont even like, or at least think I dont. I wish I had a boyfriend like Danielle's... theyre very steady, they care about eachother so much, he even quit smoking for her before they started going out and hes been really good, and their care never dies. We ran into him on the road and when we stopped at a stop light, he was behind us and he ran out of his car, came to ours gave her a kiss and went back before the light turned green... she wouldnt stop smiling for about 5 minutes. I really wish I had someone who cared about me that much. My mom is now looking for guys on christian dating pages on the web (ew lets not go into that), Im no longer my daddy's little girl ( he has a girlfriend, 3 of her kids, a new baby, and his business and truck and trailer to worry and care about), my sister is going to be married about January or so with her fiance Bruce, Danielle has leon... the list can go forever. Astro, my dog has no one, I wish I could be there for him in these final days, but my dad doesnt let me come over sometimes, I feel like an invador the few times that I am there. I wish it could just be me and my puppy, how it used to be. I would put in a movie and lay my head on his stomach and trace his swirly hair on his elbows. His breathing would slow and quickly fall asleep. Then something would alert his doggy senses and hed get up quick, sometimes smushing me under his big paws, but he would always still be my little puppy in the end. Well before the movie and all these things going through my mind, today was a tiring day... my mom was gone so I took the car and drove up to central to pick up my chamber binder, and Andrea's because she got some teeth pulled yesterday... then I drove to dave's, gave him a lock for this thing that hes going to all next week, then I drove home, then I ran up to central for a hill workout, and helped Ms. Walters clean out the orchestra room until 4, she gave me a ride home, took a shower, went to work then the movie. I feel a little bit better now because my sister just came in and said she made this cute thing for me. I absolutely love it : )... I think Im going to take a picture of it and stick it on here, but its so cute. It looks like a boquet of flowers, but its actually pens in a little vase. The pens are pretty colors like purple, turqoise, pink, orange, blue, and theyre all sparkle pens too. I thought that was real nice. I want to take a walk right now... I think I will I cant go to sleep. I wish someone would remind me to eat lately... I dont eat in the morning because that is when I run sometimes, and then Im not hungry afterwards, so I forget to eat. Then Ill do something and then all of a sudden Ill just be STARVING and by that time I have no food available to me, so then I finally go home and go straight to bed and so on. Im like anerexic not even on purpose. Dont get me wrong, I LOVE FOOD!!! I can eat so much, I just forget. If I dont eat, or at least good food in the right amount, Im going to run myself to the ground. Im going to really hurt myself... so I really need to remember. Anyways enough about my stupid life, Im going to write or draw something with my pretty pens : )</FONT>"

After it was all done, I spent about 20 minutes looking for everyone, then finally I found someone who said they left right after. So that was great, my family forgot about me and left me at the DECC, but luckily I caught Danielle just in time to give me a ride home. I miss my dad a lot. My mom couldnt pick me up from sections last wednesday and so I had to call my dad for a ride, and just thinking about seeing him makes me cry... I dont know why. It is sad though, if you think about it. I will never get to see my little sister grow up, Ill never be apart of all the close family fun. I've forgotten what a family really is. How it feels like to come home to a family who is all there, ready to eat dinner together and talk about the day. The memories of my old home fading away... even though I have a house now, it is not a home. I dont have a home anymore. Im going to go play sims now, so I can get away from reality."

For pole vaulting I amazingly didn't knock the cross bar over when my whole back scraped it, so I PR'ed and got 6'7... oh well. Anyways sections wasnt too great, it was rainy the whole time. I guess theres nothing really to talk about, I just thought I'd write. Today sorta sucked, it was good because it was the last regular day of school, but afterwards was really boring. All I did was watch a Kent Hovund video and fell asleep. Dave called but he never called back. Then I went for a 5 mile run... since it was the beginning of the week and I didnt run yesterday, I guess I shouldnt have pushed it that hard, but I really need to make sure I get all my miles in for the summer. Actually for the next little over 2 months, my goal was to run 350 miles. My god, in the past 5 days I only have 11 down, sheesh!! But they were sections... so I have to get up to roughly 35 to 40 miles a week. I figure since Im giving up soccer for cross country I better make it worth my while. Anyways thats about it. I think I have to throw up so Im gonna go, peace out."

"event","Why is it that when you finally find something worth dying for, that isnt even enough? Im just a silly girl with worthless hopes and dreams, all at the end to be crushed by society and reality. Love is most persued by people, yet least understood. It can make you high, or it can make you dillusional. I know it is over with Ryan and I, no chance in heaven or hell, yet I still think about him. I thought I was pretty much over him until I was with friends and we drove by that spot out in the east end that my life was forever changed. On that warm, June night, if those actions had never occured, we probably still would have been together. I dont know about him, but I still cringe at the thought of the events of that evening, how if we had just changed one, we could have saved so much trouble. Even though we were damned after that night, we still made attemps to make it work. The endless walking and sneaking around, slowly stirring in my mind and driving me crazy. Words cannot express how it feels to have given so much and recieved so little. I miss his touch and his promises saying it will be alright. Though the touch was soon forgotten and the broken promises etched deep into my heart. We both were so desperate to keep it afloat, but in the end only one remained. The relationship that we worked so hard to maintain was soon given up on and sank to the dreary bottom of this seemingly placid lake of love. Now and again I think about swimming down and pulling it free from all the entangles and weights, but just one little girl can't do it alone. I try to move on, but it hurts so bad. So much of my latest years have been spent occupied with it, and now with it gone, I dont know what to do with myself. What makes it worse is knowing that he lied to me sometimes now. With small things, but a lie is a lie. Even being a jerk to me sometimes, I would always forgive him because he was the only one to make me feel like I served a perpose in this wretched world, though sometimes he made me feel the opposite. Sometimes he would make me feel like Im never good enough, for regaining his parents or any of his standards. So I dont know who to blame for the end of this relationship. My faults or his unwillingness? The answer will never be known. I dont know how to shut him completely out of my mind, but in the mean time all there is to do is wallow in this pain or run through it trying to finish the race I shouldnt have started. Goodnight world, it sure is a beautiful night for love."

I would love to do a 5.34 mile. Im thinking for next year I can get sub 6. I already have 6.19, but someday... anyways enough about track. Danielle and I went out to eat to perkins today and I had a great breakfast, and went about the school day, then after voting for captains for next year's track team, I went to get some money to buy something out of the machine and I looked in my wallet and all my cash was gone. I had about $40-$60 dollars in there. Im not mad that I have no money, Im mad because that was the only money I had to pay my phone bill. What have I done to deserve this? Did I forget to tithe?? I remember sticking my money back in my wallet and stuffing it into my backpack. Im going to report it tomorrow to the school, I hope they can do something about it. Its just money I guess, Im not too worried about it. At least its not like blackmail or something, lol. Anyways, thats my story for the day. Oh yeah, if anyone really even reads this thing, tell me what I should do... this guy at youth group who I dont really even talk to, but Ive known him for a long time likes me and I dont know how to tell him Im not interested... lol let me know, alrighty?

Almost the whole time of chamber to get the stupid thing working, then of course it didnt sound right. Tim and I were messing with the sub the whole 2nd hour, and I kept smiling. I envy Tim, he got away with the excuse ""My bus was late"" for the beginning of 2nd hour with Ms. Jappa. Poor old lady... Track was alright, I found out Im running more stupid 800's... I like the 4x8 but not open 800. I came home with nothing really to do... just more nothingness. I took a walk in chester creek, it felt really good to not hurry and get a good time in something. Im mad at stupid Matt, he pretended to be my friend (his older brother) online and said he got shot and I was all worried. Im goo gullable, but thats only because I care so much about people.

"event","No words can describe how calm and collected I am right now. I love feeling this way, it's so rare for me, and I absolutely never want it to go away. Im normal right now, totally neutral and happy. Last night I was like this. I just listened to some music, but kept waking up. I was very calm, but restless whenever I woke up in the night, like the calm before a storm. Church was somewhat life changing today, I hope it lasts for more than a couple days like it usually does. It was so wonderful. Randy Ruiz had come to our church and spoke beautiful; divine intervention for me. I always knew I was in a rut, the same routine, over and over again. The words he spoke made me come to realize that it was urgent for me to change my ways. He had two alter calls, one for the unsaved and one for the saved who knew God wanted to change something in their life. 14 came up for the first, and almost all our church came up for the second one. Even before I knew all the other church going people were going to go up, God told me he wanted me to go up. I told him I was scared, but I realized this is the breaking point. If I dont change my life soon, I was going to end up like my mother or her mother. On 3 he had us come up and I was relieved to find the whole church go up with me, so I was pretty bold when I went up there. There I was. At the alter on my knees, submitting to God. I gave him everything. My anger, sadness, my troubles, my pain. Randy Ruiz said that we should give up anything that is in the way of our Lord God doing things in our life, even if we love the thing in the way. Ryan was a big blockade in my life. Even though we have been over, I couldnt get my mind off him. God is helping me let him go, along with all the feelings, memories, pictures in my mind, familiar smells and the taste. A totally new slate. I just pray that God will send me a holy man so we could love, encourage, and lift eachother up. I will pull no longer, God lead me home."

So many things consume my life right now, I dont really have time to stop and think, but when I do, its all sort of depressing. My sophomore year is now coming to an end. I'm just about half way done with high school, and now there seems to be a time crunch of 'how am I supposed to accomplish all my goals in just 2 years??' Then of course there is the fact that I cant even remember the last time I saw my little sister. The last time I saw my dad was for not even a minute, I came over to get a card and he wouldnt even let me in and he hurried me out. No one really makes time for me. My old boyfriends never even did that. Im a little put out now because I found out that when I was going out with my last boyfriend, he would always get together with all his girl friends and theyd all have so much fun, when he couldnt even find the time to call me for 5 minutes or write a little email saying hey. Its pretty pathetic how much of a loser I am if my dad or my boyfriend (now ex) dont even want to see me. My grandma died exactly 4 years ago to the day. I miss her a lot. I learned when she died never to take anyone for granted, and I havent, or at least tried not to. I think too many people take me for granted... what are they going to do when Im gone? I guess it wont make too much of a difference, but Ive always tried to cheer up and brighten people's days but all I get are cold shoulders."

It would have been wonderful except for the fact that we broke up almost 3 weeks ago, waiting 8 months for nothing. We had been basically dating on and off for a year and a half, through the good and the rough times, we made it (most more on the rough side though), but now we know for sure that we can never be together again. The track meet sorta sucked today, but oh well. I had a really bad running week, I have too many aches and pains. I think something is wrong with me, I have been unbelievably tired around 8 or 9 every night and I want to sleep all day. I get so stressed out for all this homework and too many things to do.

I get really stressed out when people ask me too many questions at once, and my mom ALWAYS does that. After the symphony concert that I did an 'eh' job in, (at least I was 2nd chair) my mom and I got in a huge fight in the car. I thought people were going to turn their heads and see who was getting killed because it was so loud. My mom ended up calling me a little bitch and all these other names and she was so mad she could barely drive and went at least 20 over the speed limit. The stupid fight was about how I ""answer her"". She makes it such a big deal if I dont know the answer to her questions. Shell ask me something and Ill say I dont know, and shes like WHY NOT?? YES YOU DO you just dont want to tell me!! And she thinks Im totally rebelling which Im not, I just like to be left alone.  Then after all this she expects me not to be annoyed and asks me at least another 10 questions right in a row and when I answer them or say I dont know, I give her 'attitude' and then again, we fight. This also happend when my mom was dropping me off for a chamber gig, I was pointing to the building from 2 blocks away til we got there and shes like where?? where?? where?? and then Im like RIGHT THERE when we were right across the street from it.. 'where??'... and then we were fighting even after I got out of the car and turns out my orch teacher was right there... shes the only one I fight with, at least this much. My sister and I fight, but not that bad. I think she might be just about cracked to kick me out of the house, but sad thing is, I dont even think my dad would let me stay with him, Id have no where to go. I hate this life, I want it all to end."

It just feels like he doesnt really care about me anymore. I know hes a busy guy and all, with a driving job and a new baby, but I wish hed put me on his agenda once in a while. He barely ever calls anymore, were just fading away. It doesnt even feel like I have family anymore. I only live with my mom now and she only feels like a chaupher or however you spell it to me.

"event","Im so tired, I just got back from a track meet from North Branch. They have a phenominal team, they almost always got first in every event, no wonder they host true team, theyre good at EVERYTHING and just want to show off on their own turf. The ride there was alright, I did a tiny bit of math hw, then listened to some music and fell asleep. Then when we got to the track, we set up camp, then they kicked us out of the infield, then about 20 minutes later, they said that we and a couple other teams had to move OUTSIDE the stupid fence, so we had 3 stupid camps today, it was pointless. Then I did about a mile and a half warm up and got yelled at by a couple PMSing team mates when trying to tell them how to do correct handoffs and they took it so personal and they made it into a joke. I take these things VERY seriously, you might think ""Danielle? Take something seriously? HAHAHA"" but really, I do take things very seriously when theyre associated with a team and when I want to do really good. Anyways, I did good on my 4x8, ms, nachbar messed up on my split and said I got 2:55, but 2:55 my butt, Mr. Teresi said I got 2:53 lol. I passed up a proctor girl and that made me very happy, and if I hadnt passed her we would have been in last place lol. Then I had vaulting and that was going fairly well, even though everything was off, like my steps, my grip, all that stuff was completely off and horrible but I kept going over the bar, so it wasnt all that bad. last year I was so much better, this stinks. Then it was PAST FRICKEN LAST CALL for the 2 mile and Mr. Forbert made me attempt the 7' and I literally had to run as fast as I could to do the vault, run super quick back to my step, then do that 3 times and 3 times I struck out, which was pointless, even though I hadnt made 7' before, but have been really close. Then I was really tired, and I got back just in time for the 2 mile. I felt really winded the whole time I was running, so I got a really bad time!! UGH IM PISSED AT FORBERT!!! I should have just scratched PV, anyways... I got 14:48 or something, with my first mile a 7:14, making my 2nd mile a crappy 7:34!!! GEEZ! Im really pissed because I wanted to beat my time of 14:32 SOOO BAD, and I actually thought I was doing alright in the stupid race. I ran hard too... after running really hard with no benefits or achieved goals, I usually cry, I just cant help it. Im not actually that sad, I just cant help it. During practice this one time Coach Angie put all the pressure on me and I was 1/2 second off and so she made us run a whole nother one and I couldnt help but cry, because I couldnt even control my muscles and run, let alone STAND UP... anyways Im writing A LOT holy crap... but long story short, no one even saw that I was sad after the crappy race and so I curled up my blanket and cried for a couple minutes and then cheered on my team. I didnt even feel good enough to talk to people, but after a little game of BIG BOOTY!!!!!!!! I felt better lol. It was pure chaos, but it was pretty fun. Then we stopped for food and I got diary queen and mcdonals (mmm how nutritious) and then begged people for something to drink. We watched Anastasia on the way back and I was sleeping on and off. I dont know how many other girls have wished this, but Disney movies are my absolute favorite. They take ordinary average girls and make their wildest dreams and prayers come true. Ever since I saw my first Disney movie, Ive always wished that would happen to me. I cant really think of something that would happen in reality like that, but Im not saying that I wouldnt like to find out all of a sudden I was of Royal blood and get to move into a palace and marry prince charming lol. To be truthful, at my family reunion my uncle said he was doing a family tree and found out that we are of the REALLY old, not just old but REALLY REALLY old English Heritage and weve had lots of knights in our family and I guess we were apart of the very upperclass, and hes found some clues that we might have Royal english blood, but its not for sure yet. ANyways, I guess it doesnt matter, it was from a long time ago. Weve had dukes and stuff in our family that are english, so I guess thats cool, and my family can be traced in America since 1631, and Ive had family be murdered and theres a Town in Massachusettes or soemthing named after us, like Reedtown, or Readville or Rede or something, or like a river, I dont know.(lots of different spellings and endings lol) Anyways, I dont know how I got from track to my heritage, but I just think its sorta cool. Well after writing all this I woke up a little bit, so I need to study for a final exam tomorrow, that I have NO idea what Im doing lol. I have track pictures tomorrow, I hope they turn out good."

I miss him so much... he was my hug reciever... Id just bend down a little bit and hug his neck when I was sad. I have no emotinal support anymore. Not even people. People tried for a tiny bit, but then they just forget or give up. The only person I can rely on is myself. I can never relate to anyone, Im always an outsider. My friend Heath lives in Duluth, GA, and one of his really good friends was supposed to get married tomorrow, but his Fiance got abducted. Thats so wierd how someone connected to me got abducted. Too bad I wasnt, then maybe someone might have a spec of sympathy for me... that is if they notice Im gone. I need someone who will be commited to me, lift me up. Girl or guy, I just need someone who I can tell everything to and a shoulder to cry on. Ive been thinking about quitting orchestra... I love playing, but when Im really stressed out and tired with people yelling at me, I just cant play. Which reminds me, I have to practice auditions which are in a couple weeks... and I have a big workout tomorrow, 4 miles at a pond thing, I really hope I can find it!! Running relaxes me... I need to get my butt in bed, so I can be awake for tomorrow, lets see, its 1145, so I guess I have to run in like 8 hours or something like that... so I need sleep!!

Running faster and faster just to get it over with, not knowing when its ever going to end. I cant stand my life. I want out. Twisted faces glance my way, not knowing whether to turn and run or find out more. One of the most things that hurts me is people trying to help. This one person tried to help. He was actually doing a good job... he kept on top of things and didnt forget about me. Some things were said, and we started having forbidden feelings, while tied to other people, now everything is just a mess, I feel like Im twirling myself into a bliss of colors just going down the drain. The reason why it hurts the most is because its the feeling of rejection. You get tied to a person, and actuallyt hink they like you and then they just turn their back on you. Im like a pathetic little puppy, you cant leave me alone for long periods of time, otherwise Ill end up messing everything up and tearing up my life.

Hiding under the covers wishing just for one more minute... coming home from school, watching tv with my sister, putting off our homework til after. Then eating a dinner, made by my mom while she was still half sane. Waiting up on the friday night, watching tv, waiting for 11:15 to roll around, waiting to welcome home my dad from work. Hed bring new stories, funny and just news from work. Sometimes bringing my sister and I little knick knacks. The good ol days. Where we would eat dinner and have casual conversations. No one hated eachother, there were no secrets or appointments they had to rush off to. THe casual dinner and after dinner chat, while digesting our food. People dont realize how lucky they are. That was my family. Now I dont even have one. Im completely alone. My dad has his own family now, too busy for me, with his new girlfriend, family, life and child. My sister is off in a couple weeks, to start her own, and her and her Fiance are getting married soon, September 3rd they think. Sadly, she doesnt even want me in her wedding. Hey, what could get worse, huh? But then theres always that one thing... I have to live with my mother who is completely out of this world, mentally. I dont like considering her as family, because family is supposed to be there for you when you need them, and no one has EVER been there for me. My so called friends never call. THey never text or wave to say HI. I make all the effort. My boyfriend is a whole other story. Its like an old crabby married couple, never finding time for eachother. I really dont know why im going out with him right now, its not a good idea. I want to run away. Since Im getting good at distance... maybe I could run back to belize. Douglas cares about me... Ive been keeping in touch with him... its not even the fact that hes a guy... he just really cares about me, but it would probably end up like my recent situation. Ugh, all this is so depressing. I think Ive written enough today. I dont want to, but I guess I should go to bed. Goodnight you cruel world... if you can even hear that... its hard to hear behind your back."

"event","Hey there, this is probably one of the first times Im writing in to say Im alright. Im doin pretty good I guess, I just got really bored so I thought Id write in here. Ive been talking to Nick a lot lately, about really personal stuff which I thought Wed never even think about talking about it with him lol. So that was sorta wierd, but it was sorta fun at the same time. He really listens to me, and he doesnt just forget about all the things I tell him, he takes it to heard and somewhat understands me, and if he doesnt, he just comforts me. That makes me feel really good, considering hes being a better friend to me than my boyfriend is. Ryan is just being an ass sorta... EVERYtime he says its going to be different and hes going to try better and were going to at least talk more because hes always too busy for me... it works good for about MAYBE a week, then he goes back into his old routine. Its really annoying but anyways... Im so used to it, it doesnt matter. I really want to talk to him about it though. Im starting to think the only reason why we keep getting back together is the physical part. If we never did anything like that, would we still like eachother the same? Or would he even give me the little time he throws in here and there, even? I just really dont know about it... anyways this is really wierd... Back to the Nick thing... He said he liked this girl... wont say her name just in case lol... but then he liked another girl but he wouldnt tell me who!! And hes been trying to tell me that Ryan just isnt a great guy for me, which I know he isnt right now... anyways then at the end of our conversation I asked him again who that girl was and hes like... well Ill tell you once she breaks up with her boyfriend... so theres a slight chance he might be talking about me... but we havent really started talking til this week!! And I dont, or at least hope he doesnt make decisions that quick... so either he decided too quick or its not me... thast wierd... anyways... nick is a great guy and I love him to death, but if something does happen between us, I really hope its meant to be, or at least for that time... because I know Id probably hurt him somehow. So hopefully hes not talking about me!! Anyways enough about him... I have to be at work in 2 hours... I curled my hair today lol... its sorta wierd with short hair, I miss my long hair SOOO much!! goodness... I cant even put it up in a messy bun. I wish my hair grew really fast like some people's. So anyways Im just rambling on now so Ill just go. ttul my lil Journal haha ~ Danielle* .:~*Peace Out*`~:."

"event","Dude... Sunday night was HORRBILE... monday night was even worse. Monday I did something good though that helped A LOT!! I was SOO annoyed an SO many feelings were going through my head, I snuck out for an hour and a half and went to chester creek and walked/ran to the dam and back. I layed in the snow under the 9th street bridge. It helped me clear my mind. I was doing SOO good, I didnt even care about Ryan or ANYONE after that!!! I think Im gonna take a quick little walk because Im getting some feelings back right now and I wish they would just go away!! Sure, of course I miss Ryan, Id do almost anything to get him back!! But I just really need to move on right now. I really dont even like any guys... but theres a couple that just seem like super interesting people... but Im trying to keep it strictly friends... even in my mind. I really dont want to date for a while. Im just so MAD, because I really wish I knew the whole truth. grrrrrr. Im gonna go take a walk n stuff now so Ill just talk later. Byebye ~ Danielle (with all the love that I posses - which isnt much anymore...)"

"event","oh lord god.... Why do people have to feel like this?? I feel HORRIBLE!! I did another bad thing again. I havent done it in a while. Just over a year. Except a lot worse. Ive NEVER EVER EVER EVER felt this much for a guy, and everything was going JUST fine, and even though we barely got to see eachother, it was still working out. Then last night he said ""Ive just thought of this today and I just really need a break from us because its too hard to be this busy and then have a girlfriend""... I guess its all fine and stuff... but thats the SAME FUCKING excuse I actually MADE UP for him to tell his girlfriend misty because he was too scared to break up with her!!!! I feel HORRIBLE! I have no idea what the real reason is. Part of me believes him, part of me doesnt. Im PMSing right now and I dont even have my period. Theres way too many emotions in my head. I have jealousy, hatred, crushed love, confusion, its too hard. All I want right now is for someone to just give me a nice long hug. THats ALL I want. I feel totally horrible. I just cant get over it. Why does the first time that I have to get dumped have to be like THIS?! With a guy Id do anything for, and he said hed do anything for me, but obviously not. I was SO proud of myself too because Ive been really good at keeping my emotions stable for him and its lasted twice as long as any other relationship Ive EVER had and now he goes and does it!! He was worried that Id do it when we started going out. Thats just insane. I hate people. I actually really want to transfer to east. Leave ALL my problems at central and denfeld. I dont know what to do. Im so serious, when I get really sad, its like I lose all my brains. Last night all I wanted to do was sleep, so I took 4x the reccomended dosage for the sleeping pills. 8 sleeping pills. Didnt do antyhing. I actually couldnt fall asleep for a while. I was thinking about just taking all my moms medication, she has two half full bottles full of these wierd prescriptions. At least it wouldve done something... Now all that Im left with since last night is a broken heart and some physical pain. Whats wrong with me?! WHy did he do this. Am I not good enough?? Was there another girl? I really dont know... am I not thin enough? or smart enough? or just not good enough for him in some way shape or form. Obviously... I cant even see myself with any other guy. I have no idea what Im gonna do. I know that its too much drama to go through just for a guy, but I seriously thought we had something. Or maybe he just used me for physical stuff, and since we havent seen eachother in a while, hell go to get it somewhere else. I thought we had a really good relationship, why does he want to just go and throw it all away?! Im so CONFUSED!!! Life will always go on, I HATE life! I just wish it would all end. Or hopefully Ill die and/or get hurt really bad and see how many people come to visit me, huh!!? No one probably, know why?? Because no one CARES!! I feel friendless, no one cares, everyone has a really good friend they can tell anything to, and what am I left with?? Im just left in the dust with my little stuffed bunny."

"event","Man, I havent seen Ryan in just about a month, and since then we havent really been able to talk much. Everytime we talk now, its just painful because he ALWAYS has to leave. Im so serious, I dont even know if he likes me anymore. I dont have anyone to talk to. Thats ALL I want! ALl I want is to not be pushed away constantly when all I want is for someone to give me a hug and actually CARE about me. Suicide enters my mind SOO much its not even funny. I think of all these ways I could secretly hurt myself without people knowing because if they cant even see my feelings when I put em out on my sleeve, they wont even notice the physical pain. I dont know exactly where Id do it though, because everyplace someone would most likely notice, and other places wouldnt do anything. My life is basically a meaningless piece of SHIT, why do people always walk over me?!?? Im sick and tired of all this impressing people crap. No one even talks to me unless I talk to them first. And if Im the last one left, and everyone else is like sick or gone from school, they ACTUALLY talk to me... wow... and sometimes it still takes a bit to make them talk. Im sick and tired of trying to live life, maybe I should just find a way out. Seriously... sometimes at youth group they youth leaders would be like... oh how are you... whats goin on in your life? But know what mistake they make... they do it in PUBLIC!! Im not gonna fucking tell about my problems in public for all to hear, lay out my guts on the table for everyone to see. I wish I could have a normal life. My mom is so stupid... I just cant stand her. I wish that she would get so pissed at me, shed hit me and leave welts on my like she did sonjia, that way Id have a GREAT reason to go live with my dad!! But then theres the problem. I love my daddy, but now with everything else going on, he doesnt have much love to give, especially when he has to take care of Bailie and stuff. Then taking care of becky and her 3 kids. I wish I could just fly somewhere out of this stupid country and just relax for a while. Actually just run away. I have no reason to come back. I hate feeling like this. Why does it seem like everyone is just so much happier than I am?? Ive only seen my sister like 4 or 5 times since she was born!! That is so sad, I wanted to be so close to her!! My dad hasnt even fucking asked me ONCE to babysit!! hes just like... oh sony, do you wanna babysit?! Thats not fair, I want to spend time with her. Or at least sony could ask me if I want to come to see me NEW SISTER!! Then sonjia was being a bitch about the her stupid skirt. I need a black skrit for the wedding, and so shes all like... omg danielle, the skirt is even tight on me... she calls me fat and obese!! Thats not even funny, and in front of her BOYFRIEND! Thats really not fair. I feel so rejected when it comes to Sonjia and daddy, and I feel like the most HORRIBLE person when Im with my mom and sister. People say theyll always be there for me. They never are. I wish theyd never say that. I wish NO ONE would EVER say those cursed words to me, because they never amount to anything. All they consist of are sound waves getting lost in this space. This just isnt a good day. Dave has been a really good friend to me. But now Im scared that he might like me. I like Ryan SOO much Im not even kidding, I have NO doubts about it. And its almost our 2 month anniversary!! Goodness... Thats a long time for me, thats why Im so happy. Ive always had this feeling that my 16th birthday is going to suck ass. Or something really bad will happen. I wonder what its going to be... Im positive something will happen, because that day is what Ive been counting down to, Im not even kidding, since I was 6. Probably even earlier. I guess since I just poured my guts out in this stupid box of a computer, Im comfortably numb, enough to make it through another day of all the crap I go through. Ill write more later, tomorrow Im playing in Tara's wedding, and today I went to the wedding rehearsal then her Bachelorette party. It was a very innocent one. Anyways... Im just gonan go to bed or somehting... I have to get up early in the morning. So Ill ttul, byebye ~ Danielle*"

"event","MOTHERFUCKER, YOU STUPID COMPUTER!! NOW Im pissed... I was all calm n crap, now Im REALLY pissed... I was typing a stupid blog and POURING my stupid crippled heart out when the URL changed my fucking computer, ITS NOT FAIR!! ANyways... I need to calm down... but what I was saying in the other one, was I feel like Im not good enough for Ryan. I was POURING my heart out to my journal last night and then it followed me into my dreams, because I had a dream that Ryan broke up with me and then I was in a new school, but it was st scholastica, and I could NEVER find my locker!! like, Id find it, then itd be in a different place everytime. Then I actually wanted to join ROTC n stuff, it was scary, then I had these different classes, with lke 50 people in them, and Taylor Trapp was in one of my classes, that pissed me off... but anyways... then I dont know, it was supposed to be a new central, there were all these floors too. But Ive been feeling this stronger and stronger that all I want is to be saved. It could mean anything. I think it means that Ill just continue what Im doing, even though I know its wrong until someone is brave enough to step out and save me from what Im doing, show me what Im doing is really wrong and set me on the right path. Or it could simply mean that I cant handle it and just commit suicide and someone might save me, thatd be good too. I really dont know. So many things are in my mind right now. I dont feel good enough because I havent been getting the greatest grades, and that REALLY makes me sad, then Im not the thinnest, seriously, my sister who is over 3 inches taller than me is trying to gain weight and shes SO much thinner than I am, its not fair. She actually tries to gain weight... stupid vitamin deficciency... I wish I had that. THen I could just eat whatever I wanted. Plus, what she says doesnt make it any better. BOTH my mom and my sister constantly nag at me about my weight. Theyre like, oh geez, danielle, you ate TWO cookies?? Youre really gonna be rackin up the pounds... and they CONSTANTLY do that to me!! Its not MY fault I like to eat REGULAR!! My sister eats less than a starving african child. She doesnt even have a problem, either. My mom is just trying to lose weight too, then she goes and critisizes me. How can she judge the spec in my eye when she has a log in her own?!? Goodness... things like that when people say those things really bother me. But seriously, Ryan is my size, most likely even thinner, and I think thats just gross if the girl is bigger than the guy, its wierd!! So yeah... I have to go now but Ill talk more later... bybeye ~ Danielle*"

"event","Hey there myself, (its not like anyone who cares really reads this...) Ive been pretty busy with life I guess. Everything has been thrown my way. I do at times, but mostly dont understand why I am supposed to go through all this. I know that Ive heard someone say ""The reason why people go through troublesom times, is that not for God to punish them, but to prepare them for whats coming""... man if something worse is coming, Im screwed. But I know this can also prepare me for good... I can be a role model to young people and I can be a motivational speaker. But I just keep on screwing up!! When is the GOOD part coming?!?!?!?!!! where I realize all the wrongs in my life and totally turn from it... whenever those motivational speakers come, I wish that all the bad stuff thats happend to them would happen to me, so maybe just ONE person would realize the pain I have and just MAYBE, MAYBE pay attention to me and want to help me along the way. With all these bad things going on, I havent stayed close to God... so when Im in church I just feel like its another school.. a place to be... learn facts... and leave. I guess the only reason why theres just a thread or two of me holding on to God is because I know what hes capable of, and at least one point in time of my life, I knew that guy and I know what he could do for me and how awesome he is. I just cant feel any of that. Im numb to all emotion in my heart. My mom doesnt really trust me anymore I guess... anyways I wont get into that, Im really hungry... so I guess Ill write a lil later... goodbye"

"event","Yesterday, the dance was SO fun!! Oh my goodness, even Ducky showed up, he wasnt even supposed to come because he had different plans. We hung out with each other n stuff, sometimes we got separated. What made me really really sad was that every slow song, like a half minute before it started Id get dragged off and I couldnt dance with him because I either couldnt find him or he was dancing with another person. So yeah, that made me really sad. Anyways... so yeah I thought today would be great, I was either going to do something with Ryan or Ducky, then I called Ryan after my dad woke me up with a phone call (Sonjia and I are going to new York the first weekend of December) and he said he didnt know we were going to do something and he had a poker tourny to go to, so then I had other plans with Ducky, well not plans, we were just going to do something, but I couldnt get ahold of him until about 430. I had a chamber gig at Greysolon Plaza at 530, so we couldnt do anything. We just talked on the phone, and then we had to go. This really stinks, I wish we could do more stuff. hes back at his moms on Sunday Night, so maybe monday since he can stay out as late as he wants, we can do something until 10 or something... We should hang out in his car and maybe Ill just stare at him right back ;) lol... he stares at me a lot. So maybe something will become of that. I miss him right now. Oh yeah, what made me even more sad was that.. alright Autumn knows that I like him, and I guess she really likes him still since theyre ex's and then when we both went out for some air, Im like whats wrong? n stuff and she started crying because shes like ""Im so stupid to let a guy like that go"" n stuff. So yeah, and then Ryan still has a girlfriend, so I guess Im screwed. This sucks. Oh yeah, and Abrum kept like being near me and dancing with me (oh yeah and I slow danced with Brent) and like when abrum and I were dirty dancing, he like held my hands n stuff. It was cute but strange at the same time because it was Abrum... ya know?? Anyways Im gonna go because Im really bored so I guess Ill just write later, ta ta ~ Danielle*"

"event","Hey there, I dont know if it was a date or not, but I just went to Hardees with Eric (Ducky) and we had some ice cream stuff and we were talking for quite a bit... I dont know if he likes me or not, but there was this time, where when he was done with his ice cream and I wasnt even CLOSE to finishing mine, he just looked at me with a certain look in his eyes like he wanted to kiss me or something lol, but theres a table in the way and a melting ice cream cone in my hand. Lovely - yes? lol... but yeah then I talked to Ryan for a bit and I still like him a lot, I miss him... I dont know what to do. If Ducky likes me maybe Ill go for him, I dont know. I just miss kisses right now!! its not fair... ANYways Im going to bed Im so tired so Ill ttul, lul ~Danielle*"

"event","Wow, I havent posted or even written in my journal in like weeks, wow. Yesterday was my last soccer game of the season, Im really glad its over. Its fun, but only for an amount of time, ya know?? I was so happy, Daddy came to my game!! The only bad thing was that Becky came.. and so dad called mom to tell her this and shes like ""well Im not going to go then"". I also scored in my game, it wasnt a very good game, I wasnt TOO aggressive, but I at least scored, and daddy saw!! Becky saw too. Yeah, so now there is a due date on the baby. Shes having a planned C-section on November 23rd, and its a girl!! They dont know what to name her yet. Im going to name my first girl ~*Joanna*~ ... anyways... today I went to church, and of course I couldnt go to the mall with Danielle... so Sonjia took me out with some of her friends. We were first all at Pizza hut, then we met at the food court. Sonjia, Bruce, Kevin, and I were walkin around together, and Kevin's sister, and her two friends were walkin around somewhere else in the mall. Us 4 hung out like the whole entire time. Sonjia and Bruce might as well have just made out RIGHT in front of us, cuz they were flirting like SUPER bad (theyre bf gf)... then us 4 went to mcdonalds, then this parking lot party thing, then we went to Caribou, then to Sony's work, were we played games n stuff. This whole time Kevin was like flirting with me n stuff I didnt mind too much I guess, but in the car since we had 20 minutes to blow, sony and Bruce were in  the front, like kissing or whatever, I was playing a game on my cell phone, then Kevin kept on getting closer and closer and like was all touchin my leg and rubbin it and like in my mind Im like ""get away from me"" n stuff, and I didnt know what to say!! I just made sure I was busy or at least he couldnt get to my mouth.... I was SO not gonna kiss him!! He smokes AND CHEWS!! How gross is that?! Then he just dropped out of school, works 47 hours a week, and goes to ALC on wednesdays. I think thats a sad life, dont you? My passion for life is to live it to the extreme fullest. Well, tomorrow I think Im gonna go out for Ice Cream with Ducky(Eric), and I dont know if he likes me or not. I dont know if I want to like him or not, its really annoying. Then theres Brent now. I really dont know if he likes talking to me anymore, hes always so quiet... I DONT KNOW its really annoying. I like Ryan a lot, but that one time when he said he still likes his gf and stuff like he still wants to be with her, that sorta turned me away and I didnt like him as much anymore, I guess it sorat turned something off inside me. I wish it could be the way it used to... we liked each other so much, I miss that. We cared for each other so much, wed do anything for each other. I miss his kisses a lot, they were always lots of fun :) ... so yeah I think Im gonna head off Im really tired! So Ill ttul lul ~ Danielle*"

"event","Oh my goodness, my back hurts SO bad right now. I had to ride home like this and it was horrible, like 3 hours of nonstop annoying pain. I cracked my back and it still didnt go away, AH! Sometimes Im on the verge of crying because it hurts so bad. Anyways, I just wanted to say that, Ryan hasnt emailed me back. Hopefully he checked his mail or he left early, poor guy needs his sleep! ~ Danielle*"

"event","Today I went down to the cities with Dad, Becky and Sonjia. Im really sad because I basically came for no reason, I thought we all were gonna have fun, but it was just stupid. I couldve spent the day with Ryan! Anyways, I did get to see some pictures of the baby, they dont know if its a girl or boy yet, because it was lying in a wierd position. They think its a girl though. Hmm... I dont know what to exactly write right now, Im really bored though. Im starting to really like and miss Ryan again. Whenever something comes up that reminds me of him, I just miss him more, hopeing that we get back together really soon. Well anyways, Im just waiting for Dad and Becky to get back from Jeannies new house, theyre chattin with her, Becky wanted to meet our whole family. Today she wasnt too shy with my sister and I, but with my grandparents she was really shy and basically kept to herself. I guess shes going to have a c-section for the baby. They dont exactly know what they want to name it yet. I guess it wont be a boy, because Dad had two girls, so hes probably going to have another one. Shell be easier to shop for, but she BETTER not be a whiney little brat, otherwise I couldnt stand that. I think Dad is here now so Im just goint to write later. ~ Danielle*"

"event","Hey you- this is Danielle (no duh...) lets see here, today I was supposed to do like so many things with people and they fell through like always. I dont think they realize how important these things are to me. I can understand why some people cant do things, but I mean seriously, they can at least tell me they cant do anything before getting my hopes crushed. I have so many guy problems its not even funny. Things never work out, ya know? My mom told me that my grandma had that problem, thats the one who committed suicide, Grandma Penny. She just always had trouble with that. Mom said shell pray for us that my sister and I wont have that problem. My sister isnt too bad, but I just get really wierd when I date guys... anyways Ill get into that later. But what I really want right now is just a friend who I can trust and really tell everything to. Like, I see so many people with friends theyve had since practically before they were born and they always have all these jokes together and stuff. Danielle has Lacey, theyre like peas and carrots, ya know? I just feel like an outsider to them. Anyways then theres always my situation to consider, I cant believe the baby is due in 10 weeks!! Thats about Late November to December 4th. I hope its December 1st or 2nd. Actually the 2nd, so the baby can have a silver birthday, then its Golden! lol... My 16th birthday is coming up... I dont know why but like for the past like 2 years it feels like somethin bad is gonna happen. Maybe Im just being stupid, but thats just what I think. So anyways... I think Im gonna leave it to that, so Ill write later, luv ya :) ~ Danielle*"

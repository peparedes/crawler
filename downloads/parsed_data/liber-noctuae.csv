"event","Hi all,
It's been a crazy few months, hence my absence from LJ.&nbsp; Between ice storms, my parents retirement, visiting the UK and me moving to new digs I feel like I've barely had time to breathe, let alone write.

As of last week my childhood home, the one that my dad built from scratch, is on the market.&nbsp; I thought I'd feel more defensive and sad about it, but the truth is, I've not really considered it home since I was 17 and left for uni.&nbsp; The house is way too big for just my parents, so I think they're relieved to give up the huge headache it was becoming to keep it up.&nbsp; As it is, we're all in a state of fluctuation.&nbsp; My roomie over the winter moved in with her boyfriend in March, so I set out to find my own place and oddly enough, I found it while on vacation.&nbsp; Actually, my parents found it and helpfully put a retainer on it for me.&nbsp; This is the first time I've lived without roomates, so it's a bit odd.&nbsp; Still, I have my cats and my loom, so I can't complain.&nbsp; I can also be weirdly decadent in my habits.&nbsp; I have a tendency to forget to put on lights at night and a bad habit of playing documentaries as background noise.....&nbsp; Any thoughts on living alone?&nbsp; I find people are quite divided on it and I haven't really decided how I feel about it yet.&nbsp; On the upside, I'm literally across the street from my work so commuting feels very much like being in college again :)

Back in April I finally scrapped up enough money to visit the UK.&nbsp; I'm still in love as ever, and it felt like visiting my paramour.&nbsp; I got to see Frankenstein (Cumberbatch as the Creature)&nbsp; and my friend and I got chatted up by a drunk Belgian from Wimbeldon on the train home because we were knitting....&nbsp; Then we went up to Edinburgh for a week and had the most amazing weather (it only rained once!)&nbsp; I left right before the wedding, mainly because I booked my ticket before they announced their engagement, and I'm kind of glad I missed the madness.&nbsp; I still miss being there though.

We had the last day of classes today, replete with awards and ice cream for the kids.&nbsp; Exams are for the next two weeks and then things get a lot quieter around here.&nbsp; My next goal is to get myself some internet at the flat, start getting Apple certifications and reclaim this town as an adult (I spent most of my childhood plotting on ways of getting away from here).&nbsp; I kind of still am plotting on getting away from here, but I can appreciate that it's a nice place and for living in the wilds of northern New England, it's pretty damn civilized.&nbsp; They also have started offering those live telecasts from the National Theater in London....so it's starting to feel a bit more like home :)

PS.&nbsp; Is anyone else getting antsy for more Doctor Who and Sherlock?&nbsp; I'm not sure 8 out of 10 Cats and News of the Week is going to tide me over.&nbsp; I think I&nbsp;need to draft a plea to the Beeb about selling online tv licenses to overseas customers.&nbsp; Also, I'll post pics of the new flat soon, I just need to unpack the box with my camera....."

"event","It's six weeks on from surgery and I'm feeling much more human now.&nbsp; I've got almost my full range of motion back and I've stopped noticing the scar tissue pressing on my windpipe :)&nbsp; Also, it's autumn.&nbsp; I hate heat and especially any form of humidity, so this lovely crisp weather is the relief I've been looking for all summer.&nbsp; 

The other really good news is a friend from high school, who is also stuck in the area because of the job situation is moving in with me :)&nbsp; We were the dynamic duo of the art room in our teens and never looked back.&nbsp; There was always a joke we'd start a sort of commune (I should mention we hung with the hippies in high school).&nbsp; Now that it's (sort of) coming to pass, I think it's evolved into something more realistic, civilised and beautiful really.&nbsp; We've considered ourselves sisters for a decade now, and the prospect of having the other there again to talk stuff through, collaborate on art with or even just hang around in front of the TV, is fantastic.&nbsp; We're not where we really want to be, but we've got each other to at least make the process of getting there more sane and fun :)

This of course means cooking is going to get more fun.&nbsp; I mainly cook for my parents these days, and they like things pretty bland and unadventurous.&nbsp; Case and point:&nbsp; I brought home indian food and my dad asked if he could put peanut butter on his chapati (yeah, I couldn't stop laughing either).&nbsp; My roomie-to-be and I are hard core lovers of dumplings and anything with mushrooms in it, which leaves several culinary traditions at our disposal.&nbsp; We also love figuring out the logistics of cooking and are already making plans for doing our own sausage making.&nbsp; 

And the best news of all:&nbsp; I'm going back to the UK!&nbsp; Only for two weeks, which for me is a complete tease, as it's the shortest amount of time I'll have been there.&nbsp; Still, I can afford to go, have the time off and I miss it dearly.&nbsp; I'm meeting a friend from Uni in London and we'll be going up to Edinburgh for a week before going back down to London for another.&nbsp; Not nearly enough time, but I'll have to take what I can get, and for now, it's making me incredibly happy"

"event","Hi guys,
Meant to post earlier, but I ended up having part of my thyroid removed instead.&nbsp; There was a node, there were several biopsies with inconclusive results and in the end I got told that regardless of the outcome now, it would most likely turn malignant later, so out it came.&nbsp; Not really being able to talk and having a frankensteinesque scar over my throat hasn't been the best of times, but I imagine this is a hoot compared to going through chemo, so I'll count myself lucky.&nbsp;

 I'd never had surgery before either, so the whole process was rather new.&nbsp; The nurses were great and didn't let my parents visit until I wanted them to (they mean well, but have a tendency to be overbearing at the best of times), and were very nice about answering my questions.&nbsp; I got to go home the same day too, wherein I promptly climbed into bed and slept till the next day.&nbsp; I also learned that me and percoset (sp?)&nbsp; are not good friends.&nbsp; Pain I can deal with, but nausea?&nbsp; Not so much.&nbsp; eugh.&nbsp; Today I'm starting to feel human again, and I was allowed to get my bandage wet so I got to take a shower, whoo!

I've been rewatching Sherlock loads :) (I've preordered the dvd already) and planning out lots of weaving projects, sadly I won't be able to do any actual weaving for another month :(&nbsp; Still, I've got a pair of mittens on my knitting needles so I guess I finally have no excuse to finish those.&nbsp;

Edit/Update:&nbsp; Heard back from surgeon/lab, my node was totally benign, I don't have cancer!&nbsp; whoo!"

"event","In which I ramble, possibly aimlessly about weaving and knitting...<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""click here for slightly epic ramble...."">I think this is the best Sunday I've had in a while.&nbsp; Instead of being at home, faced with all the little chores I didn't get to during the week, I'm over at my uncle's house.&nbsp; He's laid up from some recent surgery and wanted some company, so I brought over some cookies.&nbsp; Being that we're both fiber addicts this is good cause we can stay on the couch and talk about knitting/spinning/weaving/dyeing for hours and not exhaust all conversation possibilities.&nbsp; We've been visiting my grandparents (his parents) every week since I got back from the UK, and he really helped me keep my sanity during the reacclimation/unemployed year.&nbsp; Bringing cookies and talking about the merits of superwash wool is the least I can do.&nbsp; Right now he's taking a nap so I thought I'd put in an entry.<br /><br />So now in the new year, I've got a new job; and with the two week holiday break from it I was able to finish all the knitting/weaving projects I had going which means......I can now go and buy yarn mostly guilt free!&nbsp; My stash for weaving is huge, just ask my mom, who doesn't find the sight of drying skeins of cotton in her house to be that pleasing.&nbsp; Knitting yarn however, is rather scarce.&nbsp; I became a true knitting junkie in high school, but due to my lack of being on the internet and my mom not being crafty, the only yarn I really came in contact with was that arcrylic stuff you can get at wal-mart, I had a huge basket of it.&nbsp; Once I became a fiber snob in college, I gave it all away to a charity that knits things for the homeless. In any case, I've been slow to rebuild the knitting stash cause I just haven't done that much knitting since I started weaving, until now.&nbsp; I find that it's nice to have a project going, cause knitting can where weaving cannot, and it's nice to have something to do with my hands while waiting or even just watching tv.&nbsp; I just found a great source for yarn called <a href=""http://www.knitpicks.com"">knitpicks</a>, and have a baby jacket and some mittens I've been meaning to make, so time to get the wool.&nbsp; The only trouble is that I keep getting seduced by the colors on this site, so I'll have to be careful ;)<br /></lj-cut><br />Here endth my fiber ramblings, I should have some weaving pictures up soon.&nbsp; <br /><br />PS&nbsp; I gave a watercolor to jlrpuck for christmas and promised to show her the source photo so here it is:<br /><br /><img src=""http://i932.photobucket.com/albums/ad162/liber_noctuae/UK%20photos%2006/caegwyn.jpg"" alt="""" />"

This year's OTT-ness I think is a combo of feeling better cause I have a job, but also I have another year of cooking/baking experience under my belt, and I definitely feel more confident to do things in large batches.&nbsp; In any case, I spent more than 12 solid hours of cooking or baking on Thursday, but it was very much worth it.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the end, there were roasted carrots, parsnips and mushrooms, surprisingly light gratined potatoes, broccoli cooked in chicken broth, cinnamon buns for christmas morning and of course the aforeseen cake.&nbsp; It's filled with chocolate mousse, and you should definitely not ask me how much cream is in it.&nbsp; But oh, it was very very tasty.&nbsp; My mother said it was the best thing I've ever made, which means a lot considering I've been cooking most of her dinners for over a year now, and she's more willing to sort of bosh things together and then wonder why the dish didn't come out, whereas I'm all over researching a dish to death before setting foot in the kitchen.

"event","As the title suggests I finally got a job!  So now I'm crawling out of my cave of exile and giving an update:

Turns out I graduated just in time to watch the UK and the US swan dive into a recession, and it's been a struggle since.  So, out of the roller-coaster of applications, interviews, false hopes and hiring freezes, I finally found work.  I will be a technology assistant at my old high school.  While it's not an actual library job, the lab is right next to the library and we work pretty extensively with them, in fact the school librarian was at my interview.  Oddly, technology was the weak part of my masters degree, or at least I felt it was.  Library schools are slowly moving towards new technologies as more schools have started to put their tech offices in their libraries, but we're still in the midst of a sea change and I think it's hard for them to gauge on what's important to teach. 

Regardless, I'm well pleased.  I can stop feeling like a sponge to my parents for starters.  I'm also really pleased that I found work that was related to my field.  I had actually gotten hired to do seasonal work at borders when I heard that I'd gotten this job, and I was not looking forward to that at all.  

I just filled out my paperwork this morning, so now I'm kicking back until monday, when I start.  I can't describe how relieved I am, and just in time for Thanksgiving too!

PS.  sorry for the meme folks, I went into interview overdrive right as you guys commented, so I will get the questions to you soon!"

What possessed you to go to the UK to study ?&lt;/i&gt;<br /><br />It was really a marriage of two loves for me.&nbsp; I was asked what I wanted to be when I grew up in junior high once and the first thing that came out of my mouth was a librarian.&nbsp; I got my first job at a library in high school and never looked back.&nbsp; <br /><br />The UK part has been around for far longer.&nbsp; Until I was a teen my access to media was through PBS, my library and my parent's record collection.&nbsp; Thus by the time I was 9, I had a healthy love for Sgt Pepper, Doctor Who and Monty Python, and was teased mecilessly for it by my Michael Jackson listening and Simpsons watching peers.&nbsp; In college I ended up taking a lot of British history classes and went to study in London for a semester, which was fabulous (our tuition covered going to the theater every week for theater class!). <br /><br />So,&nbsp; when my senior year rolled around I knew that I wanted to be a librarian and I wanted to go back to the UK.&nbsp; I checked it out on the ALA website and just went for it.<br /><br /><br />&lt;i&gt;2. What have you been doing since you finished your degree and came back to the states (you haven't been updating your LJ much so I'm curious :)&lt;/i&gt;<br /><br />Sadly, being jobless I'm afraid.&nbsp; Lots of openings for directorships, but not starting rung librarians, so if anyone out there would like to take an application for a librarian, or even a PA I'm there.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have been doing house sitting, commissioned pieces of weaving, and recently an internship at Dartmouth College.&nbsp; Actually, I've been meaning to post about that, so look out for it soon.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; and I've taken a leap of faith and started writing Harry Potter drabbles.&nbsp; I haven't written fiction since elementary school, but with encouragement and betaing from my friend, whose LJ name is escaping me, I have been really enjoying the drabbles.&nbsp; If I'm feeling brave I'll post them.<br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;i&gt;3. How did you find The Way of Things?&lt;/i&gt;<br /><br />Through Teaspoon, and then out of hope for faster updates I went to jlrpuck's lj site, and I liked it so much I had to leave a comment.&nbsp; I'm glad I did as I've come to really enjoy the &lt;i&gt;Way of Things&lt;/i&gt; community and all the great fic I've discovered from it :)<br /><br /><br />&lt;i&gt;4. You do a lot of crafty stuff like weaving and baking. How did you get into all of that ?&lt;/i&gt;<br /><br />Weaving came from my knitting and knitting....well as a child I was fascinated by textiles and how they were made.&nbsp; I got taught the knit stitch by my grandmother and her aunt one afternoon, but the rest I taught myself out of a book, and then crochet too.&nbsp; Weaving was always an alluring mystery cause no matter how many books I read I couldn't figure it out and I wanted to so much.&nbsp; It actually became a deciding factor in choosing what college I went to, and I ended up majoring in it.&nbsp; Luckily for me my weaving teacher was also my academic advisor and a reference librarian, so she was extremely nice and helpful.<br /><br />Cooking and baking were first out of need and then for pleasure.&nbsp; My brother and I do not like my mother's cooking.&nbsp; Of course, we didn't really have a choice over this as kids, but one day, I must have been about 11, I complained so much that they told me to cook my own dinner.&nbsp; So I did, I'm sure it was pasta and cheese, but I cooked everything myself.&nbsp; It became my chore, so I pretty much do all the cooking, which sounds like a nightmare, but really, I get to make what I want most of the time and cooking has led me to some pretty interesting people and events.&nbsp; Later I discovered Cook's Illustrated and Good Eats and really got an understanding of why things happen and how to control them.&nbsp; Bread making I got from my dad.&nbsp; He made pizza dough when I was growing up, and he used to let me knead small pieces of it.&nbsp; When I really started reading about baking seriously in college he got interested and now we make all our bread at home, and are avid collectors of bread cook books. <br /><br /><br />&lt;i&gt;5. Are you going back to England soon ?&lt;/i&gt;<br /><br />I really wish I was, but until there is a job and some money it looks unlikely.&nbsp; Coming home this last time really decided it for me though, I want to live there.&nbsp; I was so happy there, even on crap days I was happy there.&nbsp; I can't help but love it there, for so many reasons, both profound and completely stupid.&nbsp; For now, I dream, and know that I have a bunch of school mates' couches I can crash on.</lj-cut><br />"

"event","Having lived in a rural area most of my life, wild critters have been a fact of life.&nbsp; Lately though there has been a spate of road kills.&nbsp; It all started when C called me up on his way over for some pizza to say that he'd hit a wild turkey with his car, had it in the back in a plastic bag, and did I know anything about evisceration?&nbsp; At the time the answer to that was no, but now, I guess I can claim to know a bit more.&nbsp; The short and safe answer is to cut out the back bone since all of the major organs are usually attached to it, so you get rid of everything in one process.&nbsp; This is a severe over simplification, but I haven't died yet, so I suppose there's something to be said for that.&nbsp; C's next question was if I knew any good turkey recipes.&nbsp; I think in the end he chose well with braising it (always good for meat you suspect might be tough) with a wine sauce and apples.&nbsp; Pizza was a bit late, but turned out to be fortuitous since I got my hands on a copy of The Joy of Cooking, and we poured over the game section.

This past week a neighbor brought me another dead turkey he had hit, and that is sitting in the freezer.&nbsp; A few days later, my brother hit a rabbit with his car, so he and his friend hacked it's head off and skinned it the best they could.&nbsp; In retrospect, I wish they had let me do it, cause they're both pretty ADD and did a bit of a hack job.&nbsp; For the sake of safety I doused the parts in vinegar, seared everything, and then brought it to a boil for five minutes before stewing it, I'm pretty sure between the acid and high temp that whatever beasties there were are now dead.&nbsp; The next night he managed to bash two porcupines with a shovel (yes, this is as ridiculous as it sounds), technically not road kill, but they were in the drive way, and they were a threat to the dogs.&nbsp; So, at the end of two weeks I find that I have learned a multitude of things about road kill, like how rabbits are a lot of work for not a lot of meat that tastes like chicken (I kind of already knew that, but some lessons are worth repeating), wild turkey is excellent, I'm not as squemish since the last time I saw a wild animal being butchered, and watching a dog throw up porcupine quills is.....harrowing (apparently my brother didn't get rid of them permanently enough).&nbsp;"

She's still nervous around new people, especially men, but she warms up pretty quickly when she figures out you just want to pet her.&nbsp; It breaks my heart to think of what might have been done to her before she was rescued.&nbsp; As you can see, she's super cute too.&nbsp; We have plenty of land and soft couches, so we're hoping she'll get less skittish and be a happy dog here :)<br /><br />"

"event","Hello All,
This will be brief, but just writing to say that I've moved back to the States.&nbsp; I can't deny it's been great to see family and friends again, but I find I still love the UK and am heartbroken every time I leave it.&nbsp; I guess this past year's been good.&nbsp; I was on the fence about a lot of things in my life and living over there was sort of a testing period if you will.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I'd like to live there, I felt so at ease and in tune with the people and how things are run.&nbsp; I know I'll be back, but it still feels somehow like a failure that I had to leave.

My dog also died on Friday.&nbsp; He was 17 and not doing too well at all.&nbsp; He went while laying down in his favorite spot in front of the fire and there had been talk of taking him to the vet to be put down, so I'm infinitely grateful he got to die at home.&nbsp; I'm gutted though, he was such a sweet dog, and we had him for so long it was easy to think he'd just be around forever.&nbsp; We buried him up at my grandparents farm, cause he loved being there chasing the wild turkeys and the land will stay in the family so we can always go visit him.

Yeah, I know this isn't a very cheery entry given that the holidays are coming up.&nbsp; However, there is some good in all this.&nbsp; I got to come home to see my dog before he died, and even though I had to leave the UK, I learned a lot and it's given me some new goals.&nbsp; I'll update soon, as the holidays have given me a lot of opportunity to do a lot of cooking and textiles.

Be well everyone"

If you're using the food processor for the onion, do this in there as well.<br /><br />4 Tbsp Butter, unsalted preferable<br /><br />2 Tbsp Olive oil.&nbsp; If you don't like the idea of using that much butter, you can switch the proportions around.<br /><br />1 Cup white wine.&nbsp; White is tradtional, but if you want a stronger flavor go with red, but your rice will turn purple.<br /><br />5-6 Cups chicken stock.&nbsp; you can substitute vegetable stock if you like, or any kind of stock really.<br /><br />Salt<br /><br />Pepper<br /><br />Grated Parmesan, at least a 1/4 cup, I probably end up using about half a cup.<br /><br />Juice and zest from a lemon.<br /><br />Prepped vegetables or meat<br /><br /><strong><u><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Directions:</span></u></strong><br /><br />1.&nbsp; Chop onion and garlic.&nbsp; Get out the meat and vegetables you want to put in and get them chopped up too and put them off to the side.&nbsp; Measure out the rice, wine and fats.&nbsp; Place the stock in a saucepan over low heat on the back burner, or if you have an electric kettle, put it in that and turn it on.&nbsp; If going down the electric kettle route, once you've brought it to a boil you'll probably only have to reheat it once.&nbsp; The aim is to keep it hot, but not boiling.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Over medium low heat, melt the butter and oil in a saute pan or large frying pan with relatively high sides.&nbsp; Once the butter has melted add the onions and sprinkle with a bit of salt, go easy though cause the parm's going add saltyness at the end.&nbsp; Cook the onions till they're soft and then add the garlic and cook for a further 30 sec.&nbsp; Add the rice to the pan and get the grains coated with oil, then leave it alone for about 4-5 min, or till the grains look opaque.&nbsp; when you first coat the rice with the fat, it will go translucent, but toasting the rice will make it go opaque again and add nuttiness to the party.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Add the wine and turn up the heat to medium.&nbsp; You want most of the alcohol and liquid to burn off, so you can get the creamy factor going and not end up with super boozy rice.&nbsp; Now time for the stock.&nbsp; Add about half the stock to the rice and turn the heat down to low, you want to see a little bit of bubbling, but not much at all.&nbsp; If you're adding dried herbs, now would be the time to put that in so it will get a chance to rehydrate and mingle with the ingredients.&nbsp; Leave the rice to cook for about 10 min, stir every once in a while, till most of the liquid is gone and you can see the bottom of the pan when you draw your spoon or spatula through it.&nbsp; This is when you want to be cooking your veggies and meat if you need to cause you're not really doing much else while the rice cooks.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Add a bit more stock and wait for it to cook off.&nbsp; Repeat this about 3-4 more times till the rice is cooked or you have no stock left, it should take another 10-15 minutes. The rice is done when it's soft, but still has a bit of a bite to the center.&nbsp; You'll see the sauce form as the cooking takes place, this happens cause the starch from the rice comes off and thickens the stock, you want it pretty oozy, but not soupy.&nbsp; <br /><br />5.&nbsp; When the rice is done and you have it at a consistency you like, take it off the heat.&nbsp; Stir in the parm, lemon juice, pepper and give it a taste to see if it needs any more salt.&nbsp; Usually not cause of the parm and stock and salt at the beginning.&nbsp; Then fold in the vegetables and meat.&nbsp; Done.</lj-cut><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Hello All,<br />As promised here is the first of my food focused entries.&nbsp; I know that I've been teaching a few of you to cook, so I thought maybe this would be a good way to show you the process through pictures since I can't be standing next to you all the time.&nbsp; I'm also doing this to document my own progress with cooking, and hopefully capture some triumphs as I explore new territory....<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""this way for the chocolatey goodness....."">I couldn't resist having the first entry be devoted to chocolate.&nbsp; I adore chocolate, but have been intimidated for a long time in actually doing anything interesting with it after years as a young teen reading through cook books and being warned about seizing and tempering.&nbsp; These days, after learning baking and bread making, chocolate doesn't seem that scary at all, but I find my education in the subject to still be lacking.&nbsp; This of course is the perfect excuse to get a new book, but that's another story ;)<br /><br />In lieu of any truly specialized knowledge, I'm starting off with something infinitely simple, truffles.&nbsp; I know what you're thinking, truffles can't be easy, they're so posh and decadent looking.&nbsp; Trust me, truffles are easy, and you look and feel like a million bucks when you serve and eat them to boot.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/liber_noctuae/pic/00011trf/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" align=""right"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/liber_noctuae/pic/00011trf/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/liber_noctuae/pic/00012gph/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" align=""middle"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/liber_noctuae/pic/00012gph/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />all you need is:<br /><br />227 g or 8 oz dark or bittersweet chocolate, if you're feeling very lazy, use chips.<br /><br />240 ml or 8 oz heavy cream<br /><br />cocoa powder<br /><br />you can either do this on the stove or in the microwave.&nbsp; you need to pay more attention with the microwave, but you only mess up one dish this way.&nbsp; For both chop up your chocolate fairly small or dump your chips into a glass or metal bowl.&nbsp; For the stove, heat up the cream till you just see a bare simmer and some steam starts wisping off the top.&nbsp; Pour the cream over the chocolate and let sit for 5 min, then stir till smooth.&nbsp; For the microwave, pour the cream over the chocolate and nuke for 30 sec at a time.&nbsp; the bits of chocolate won't be completely melted, but when you stir it, it'll feel soft and the residual heat will melt the rest.&nbsp; Don't over do it, chocolate burns easily and tastes horrible when burnt, with no real way to repair it.&nbsp;<br /><br /> Now stash the bowl in the fridge for at least two hours.&nbsp; you want the ganache (french word for chocolate and cream mixture) to be pretty firm, you can speed this up by putting it in a wide, flat vessel so the mixture has more surface area.&nbsp; Once it's firm use a melon baller or small spoon to scoop up about a teaspoon's worth of the mixture.&nbsp; Roll this into a ball with your hands quickly and drop into a small bowl of cocoa powder and coat the surface.&nbsp; place the finished truffle on some parchment or wax paper.&nbsp; repeat for the entire batch.&nbsp; you'll want to keep these in the fridge so they stay firm, and I also recommend using gloves when rolling cause this is pretty messy.&nbsp; But oh so tasty :)&nbsp; see?&nbsp; it truly is that simple.<br /><br /><br />I leave you with some photos of the process, hopefully it'll give you an idea of the process.&nbsp; Sorry for the not so good quality of these, I'm still figuring out photographing food, and I kind of left it too late for any natural light.&nbsp; <br />Hope you all enjoy :)<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/liber_noctuae/pic/0000y4sf/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" align=""left"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/liber_noctuae/pic/0000y4sf/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/liber_noctuae/pic/00010eg2/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" align=""right"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/liber_noctuae/pic/00010eg2/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a></lj-cut><br />"

"event","<br />Wow,<br />Nearly Halloween and more than a year on from when I started this trip.&nbsp; No longer am I in my little flat with K and M, but that's the way it was always going to be.&nbsp; This autumn has been what I needed in some ways, and I've done an awful lot of thinking about the future, but I suppose when you're young, that's about all one can do....<br /><lj-cut text=""clickity click.....""><br />My new place is much better in many respects.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I had a great time with my flat mates, but let's face it, that was the smallest flat ever, in not the nicest part of town.&nbsp; It's much quieter here, I don't have semi trucks thundering past my window at all hours and my room is bigger.&nbsp; I used to live with these people, but as my host family and we seem to have picked up where we left off quite easily.&nbsp; They have two very cute dogs, which is also a plus. I love having pets, so even when they sit and beg for food, I still can't regret having them around.<br /><br />There are three other Americans in the house, students living in the same room I was a few years ago.&nbsp; They're friendly enough, but I am befuddled by some of their habits.&nbsp; I'm beginning to wonder how British I've become over this year.&nbsp; They're also my little brother's age, which makes me feel old.&nbsp; They said they'd never really recycled before coming here !?!?!?!&nbsp; my liberal, green living mind is agog at this.&nbsp; no recycling?&nbsp; I've been trained from birth to recycle, it's like breathing at this point.&nbsp; sigh. That and none of them can really cook, they do things culinarily that make me cringe, but I hold my tongue, cooking isn't everyone's forte.&nbsp; <br /><br />Aside from frantically filling out applications I've been going for long walks in the park nearby and knitting mittens, it's quite joyous, especially now that the leaves are turning.&nbsp; Not as beautiful as New England's of course, but then, I am a bit biased in that regard ;)<br /><br />Alright, I'm off to bed, but there shall be new and different posts quite soon I think.&nbsp; too long has this journal been lagging.&nbsp; I may not do fic, but I do cook, so look out for cooking related posts folks.<br /><br />as always, be well.</lj-cut><br />"

"event","Hello Again,<br />I know, my god, I'm posting more than once a month.&nbsp; I did promise a recap of the trip and here it is.&nbsp; I think I'm going to break this down into location or periods of travel, as we were pretty inconsistent in where and how long we stayed.&nbsp; I suppose I should start at the beginning.....<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""clickity click for digressions on the epic quest"">It all began when I picked the Frumpys (the collective name my mother and aunt have given themselves) up from the airport and we got the rental car and drove back to my flat through London traffic.&nbsp; This of course was the first of our fun, but slightly harrowing experiences on the trip.&nbsp; On a good day one is lucky if they remember what you told them in the morning and even luckier if you can hold a five minute conversation without them getting distracted.&nbsp; London traffic is awful, even at off peak times, so it was rather a miracle that the car came out of the whole trip unscathed.&nbsp; That said, we only had a few near misses, and I should concede that my aunt's driving skills, while scary at times, are excellent.&nbsp; So once we got sorted we made our first push north on the M1.&nbsp; I love how the sign for the M1 promises that by taking this road, you shall eventually reach a mysterious place called 'The North'.&nbsp; I'd not been very far north before this trip and while I'm aware that there is a north/south rivalry or sorts, this sign sort of hit the message home a bit more, I'm sure it's not meant that way, but now it's stuck in my head.&nbsp; <br /><br />The first major place we stopped to have a look around was York.&nbsp; I loved York a lot.&nbsp; Didn't get to wander on the walls nearly as much as I wanted to, but I did get to meander across the bridges and through the streets winding our way towards the Minster, which was massive and beautiful, even peeping through the cracks of sky in between the shops.&nbsp; From there we headed towards the coast and Whitby, to camp for the night.&nbsp; We set out the next morning for Edinburgh, but stopped off at New Castle for lunch and wandered around Berrwick Upon Tweed in the afternoon.&nbsp; I ate more fish and chips on this trip than I have the for the entire year, and I think I shall not be having any for a while yet.&nbsp; New Castle, while certainly not as pretty as York, was friendly, if a bit rainy.&nbsp; Berrwick was even more rainy, but I did get to walk on more walls and that is always fun.<br /><br />We ended up staying in Edinburgh the longest cause my aunt has relatives there and free and friendly housing is always a plus.&nbsp; This was my first time to Scotland and I think I might just be a little bit in love with it.&nbsp; It rained most of the time we were there, but despite that, it was still really, very lovely.&nbsp; I could just list off all the sites and museums we went to, but I think then this entry would really just end up being a list and become very dull.&nbsp; Seeing the castle and being able to look down on the city from the cliff was fantastic, and we even got a bit of sun.&nbsp; The parks and gardens were gorgeous as well.&nbsp; I love how easy it was to escape the city and be almost directly in the forest or at least in some rolling fields.&nbsp; I miss this so much by being in London.&nbsp; From Edinburgh we made our way west, through Glasgow and down to the lochs.&nbsp; On the way over we stopped at Stirling Castle.&nbsp; While we visited numerous castles on this trip, this one stuck out cause they had a whole house devoted to tapestry reproduction and my weaving self could not resist having a gander at their techniques and results.&nbsp; The drive south was gorgeous, full of lakes, hills and many many trees.&nbsp; I could really go on and on gushing the pastoral merits of this place.&nbsp; The hostel we stayed at was quite the thing as well.&nbsp; It was a large house built in the 1860s, very fairy talesque.&nbsp; The frumpys were convinced it was an actual castle, and would not listen to my appraisal until all their hopes were dashed by asking the woman at the desk.&nbsp; I might have been a wee bit smug after that ;)<br /><br />Finally we crossed the border back into England.&nbsp; We spent a morning in Mary Port to see their Roman museum and a bit of Hadrian's wall.&nbsp; My mother had confided to me at the beginning of the trip how excited she was to be seeing the wall.&nbsp; I warned her that most of it is just earth works or crumbling away, but she was having none of it.&nbsp; Mary Port of course, proved me right as the only thing left of the original fort and wall, was the earth mounds on which they had once been built.&nbsp; She has an enthusiasm for history, I'll give her that, but it's the grasp of evidence and reality, that escapes her.&nbsp; She's very much tied up in the romance of things.&nbsp; Having seen this we had a jaunt through the lake district, staying near Cockermouth one night, and then working our way through Windemere where we saw the most fantastic garden, so we spent the afternoon wandered through all it's paths.&nbsp; The second night was spent in Kendal, a nice town with a lovely river and pubs.<br /><br />Our next drive brought us to Liverpool.&nbsp; The frumpys were in heaven as I waved them off at Albert dock for the Beatles tour.&nbsp; Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Beatles, a lot.&nbsp; I had the dubious distinction in grade school as being the kid who liked Sgt Pepper over Thriller, but I doing the pilgrimage thing just seems a few steps too close to stalkerish for me.&nbsp; Liverpool held an even greater opportunity for me that afternoon, since there was a massive exhibition of Gustave Klimt works on at the Tate.&nbsp; My student concessions ticket was worth every pence as I made my way through room upon room, of not only his paintings, but furniture, jewelry, clothing and all manner of things that had been designed and created by the man.&nbsp; Unfortunately I was left waiting about for a while since the frumpy's tour was late, but overall, the exhibition was worth it.&nbsp; We stopped that night in Chester and spent most of the next day there checking out the shops and walking along the city walls, before heading south for Wales.<br /><br />Northern Wales, while definitely a very distinct landscape, reminds me the most of home.&nbsp; I'd been camping in Snowdonia a few years ago, and it was lovely to return to the area.&nbsp; The most distinct and amazing feature is the large piles of slate that glaciers have left sitting in amongst the mountains, and mist is always drifting around.&nbsp; I think if I was given free reign over where I could choose to live, I think that area would be in the top 3.&nbsp; We spent a day seeing Caernarfon, both the castle and the town.&nbsp; It's definitely one of the more interesting castles we'd been too, and even though I'm deathly afraid of heights, it was worth overcoming that to climb the towers and look out over the coast and the town below.<br /><br />From there we drove down to Cardigan....well, rather we thought the place we were staying at was near Cardigan.&nbsp; Later we found out that it was in fact much closer to Aberyswyth, about 40 miles back, but by then it was 9, so we ended up crashing at a B&amp;B.&nbsp; Even though we cocked that up pretty bad, overall we did alright considering we went most of the trip by paper map and printed out gogle directions.&nbsp; The frumpys had brought a sat nav, but the thing was techy at best and by the end I think they were sick of the voice and ready to chuck it out.<br /><br />My birthday was spent driving from Cardigan to Oxford.&nbsp; I've not had a ""normal"" birthday since I was about 15, and something mundane or weird invariably ends up happening on the day, so I have come to expect it, and this year delivered by making sure I was on the road for 6+ getting motion sick in the back of the car.&nbsp; We did stop in Cardiff to see the Welsh Assembly and the Bay, the Assembly being the last on my list of UK houses of government to see, and the Bay was just really pretty, plus mum bought me a 99.&nbsp; They also made it up to me by taking me to a really nice pub for dinner.&nbsp; Actually, we were walking down the road looking for pubs and it was the second and more friendly one we bumped into.&nbsp; So, if you're ever in Oxford and happen upon the Cape of Good Hope, I can say with confidence that it is a good place to eat.&nbsp; My aunt had the lamb and squash tagine, and my mom and I got chicken, red wine and bacon pie with mash and leeks.&nbsp; If nothing else I had a good evening sitting back on the bench savoring my pie and sipping on my lager.&nbsp; The frumpy's got a bit tipsy though so I had to slowly heard them back to the hostel, while they stumbled and giggled along.<br /><br />The last day was a bit frantic, waking up early in Oxford and getting on the road so they could catch their flight back.&nbsp; I said goodbye while we were in the grocery store.&nbsp; They wanted to get tea and biscuits to take back and I needed to restock for the week.&nbsp; It was odd, but then, I've never been any good at goodbyes.&nbsp; It was strange enough seeing her in what I have come to know as 'my' Sainsbury, but to be hugging her goodbye in the midst of looking at some rocket was even weirder.&nbsp; Ah well.&nbsp; I was really glad to have taken this trip.&nbsp; The frumpys had their moments of cultural/social gaffes as they always do, but translating for them was kind of fun in it's own way.&nbsp; I'd seen some of southern England before, and my jaunt to Snowdoina, but this was by far the most extensive trip I've taken across the UK.&nbsp; The more I see of here, the more I love it, and at the risk of sounding completely soppy, this trip definitely did nothing but confirm that.<br /><br />phew, a long, dragging post I know, but I had to put it down sometime.&nbsp; Hopefully I didn't bore you all too much.&nbsp; <br />cheers everyone</div>"

"event","Hello All,<br />I know it's been a month and I've been horrible and not updated.&nbsp; I recently traveled pretty extensively across GB and I shall be putting that in my next post cause it really deserves it's own description.&nbsp; In any case, I shall be relating more recent events here.&nbsp; Backwards I know, but hey, when has that ever stopped us before?<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""spoliers for RSC production of Hamlet"">&nbsp;So life has pretty much gone into dissertation/finding somewhere to live in September.&nbsp; I fear the dissertation problem shall not be solved till September, but I do hope to be putting a good dent in it this week.&nbsp; The moving issue seems to be solved however, which is a load off my mind, since I've been slowly freaking out about it since about April.&nbsp; My old host mother from my semester abroad here said she has a room free and will rent it to me.&nbsp; I liked being with them a lot the last time, so I think this shall be a very good thing.&nbsp; They also have dogs, and I miss mine a lot, so at least I can look forward to some surrogates :)<br /><br />Right, so my weekend in Stratford Upon Avon.&nbsp; K has been so stressed from work, that she made her R make arrangements for them and I found my own B&amp;B.&nbsp; Even though we really only met up for the play, I think it was just a lot less stressful this way and heck, we live together so it's not like we don't see each other.&nbsp; right, back to the story.&nbsp; So I caught the train and settled in for a nice ride with my David Sedaris on the ipod and cracked open my Mastering Weave Structures (oh my shameless nerdy ways).&nbsp; it was fairly quiet until we stopped at a station about half an hour away, when the carriage was inundated with teens, clearly on their way to some sort of event, evidenced by their glow sticks, bottles of wine and costume jewelry.&nbsp; Stratford station was also a bit of a surprise as the transport police were out in force to meet the horde of teens.&nbsp; I later learned that there was a rave going on in Stratford.&nbsp; The irony of this makes me grin.<br /><br />Found my B&amp;B, which was lovely and not too far away from the city centre.&nbsp; Found a Bible and bad romance novel next to the bed, and thus ate my curry while laughing at poorly penned lines of cheesetastic passion and devotion with a Christmas theme, written in the mid 90s.&nbsp; I had a few hours to kill so I wandered around town.&nbsp; Stratford is beautiful and I'd really only been there before to go to the museums so it was nice to just walk around and get a feel for the place.&nbsp; I meandered over to the theater, said hello to the ducks and bought a program.&nbsp; Met up with K and R , and discussed our journey's.&nbsp; We got standing seats, cause they are cheap, but we still had decent views of the stage and standing that long was actually not that bad.<br /><br />And as for the play itself.....it was really well done, and the cast was really tight.&nbsp; I've seen Hamlet done on stage at least 4 times before this at varying levels of professionalism, and there are some pretty consistent problems with how it is put on that I think were really well addressed in this production.&nbsp; I think a lot of the problems stem from over acting, or making things very morose cause we all know that so many people die in the end.&nbsp; Hamlet has lots of funny lines, and a wide range of emotions are expressed and I think the idea of it being a tragedy kind of overtakes it when it's being performed.&nbsp; This was definitely not the case on Saturday.&nbsp; Not only Tennant, but everyone really pulled it off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Particularly how they handled the subject of Hamlet's madness.&nbsp; There were funny moments of it between him and Rosencrantz and Guilderstern and especially with Polonius.&nbsp; okay, and there was also the part where they were sending him off to England, had him strapped to an office chair and Tennant said 'wheeee' while being wheeled out.&nbsp; These were countered by really intense scenes, like when he jumped in Ophelia's grave, or was curled up in a fetal position, rocking and crying his eyes out. <br /><br />There are also really dark sides/themes which again, I think get lost in the foreshadowing of death.&nbsp; There is the obvious moral theme of revenge and the torment of that eating at him.&nbsp; Hamlet has had his world let him down, but this is something I think happens to most people at some point in their life, and it can seem like madness.&nbsp; He had a parent die, and that's never easy, you think they're going to be there forever and I can't imagine suddenly losing that source of support in your life.&nbsp; He's also discovered that people he thought he knew, things he felt sure of in the world were not as pure or what he thought they were.&nbsp; He discovered his uncle was a murderer, that people he thought to be his friends could be bought into performing tasks against his interest, and he found out his mother was willing to sleep around and marry quickly to assure her position of power.&nbsp; When your world view alters that much, I imagine you'd start questioning yourself a lot too...In any case, I have a degree in history and studio art and cannot claim to be well learned of theater or plays, but I did enjoy this production a great deal and how they decided to handle the material.<br /><br />And now for a paragraph that I shall probably be blushing and slightly regretting committing to....well not paper, but you get the picture.&nbsp; This is my paragraph of shameless tennant oogling.&nbsp; what can I say?&nbsp; I adore pale skinny men in suits and he likes to deliver on those factors a lot, especially in this play with the suit (I prefer suits to tuxes, so this was a particular treat), the tux, and the t-shirt with the buff man chest on it.&nbsp; Whoever was doing costuming was sympathetic to the hetero female eye, and whoever decided that he should untie his bowtie and start unbuttoning his shirt has my thanks ;)&nbsp; I was definitely of two minds during the play, one trying to enjoy it for the theatrical production and the other shamelessly enjoying the view, though in my defense I got distracted by the weave structure of one of Ophelia's dresses and started trying to figure out how to recreate it in the back of my head.&nbsp; Of course, that only exposes the true extent of my weaving nerdyness.&nbsp; So in the end, I got drawn into the plot, but also managed to do a lot of drooling, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Post play I parted ways with K and R and wandered out of town and back to the B&amp;B with Jeff Buckley on the ipod and feeling that post theater buzz.&nbsp; Rode home the next morning with a carriage full of quieter, hung over teens and enjoyed the rest of my Sunday.&nbsp; While I wish the US would have better theater culture, I'll just have to enjoy it for as long as I'm here and savor it :)<br /><br />Peace Everyone</div>"

"event","Hello all,<br />yeah, it's been a really long time.&nbsp; sorry bout that.&nbsp; April was a bit crap, for various reasons.&nbsp; In any case, I've just noticed it's spring so I've been taking in the green and hopefully am on my way to getting over April.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""click this way "">My main gripe with April was my hard drive failing and having a ton of work due at the same time.&nbsp; That said, I did get the problem fixed by some very nice and helpful people and I did get my work in, albeit not in the manner I had hoped to.&nbsp; sigh.&nbsp; Now the crunch time begins for the dissertation....eeep!&nbsp; I really should have more confidence, but I think I'll have to build up to it.<br /><br />I went to Greenwich park the other day, and found it to be fantastically lovely.&nbsp; It was raining (typical) but it was just so green and trees were blooming and it was just the right place to be.&nbsp; Went to the maritime museum and saw the coat that Lord Nelson was shot in.&nbsp; There was some lovely nautical equipment, but I'll be honest, I was more into the coat and the other textile artifacts they had on display.&nbsp; E and I oogled the historical bits and caught up over tea.&nbsp; After that we walked up to the Observatory to see the prime meridian line.&nbsp; So, I stood in queue to stand on a line, a british experience if ever I've had one.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Doctor Who is finally back on the screens and I'm yet again able to get my fix.&nbsp; I'll not talk plot cause people are either not into it or have some decisive opinion on spoilers, so it's safer just to keep silent on it.&nbsp; Still, it's all very lovely to know it's there.&nbsp; Doctor Who's been an entertainment staple since my childhood and I suspect I'll be a semi closeted whovian/sci fi nerd forever.&nbsp; <br /><br />The flat's been pretty empty these days.&nbsp; M went home for a bit, and K has been over at the boyfriends or also going back home.&nbsp; I've noticed I've been baking more in response to that, mainly cause I know I'll have the kitchen to myself, except for the mouse that's taken residence there (he's been dubbed Jerry).&nbsp; Our oven is odd in that the heating element is on top, so essentially it is a very adjustable broiler as opposed to an oven and I burn the top of things a lot, so it's been a lot of fiddling and testing.&nbsp; Is it crazy of me to fantasize about my dream kitchen?&nbsp; someone left an Ikea catalog on the bus the other day and totally got sucked in.&nbsp; For some bizarre reason Ikea seems to fuel my uber domestic side, a dangerous prospect considering I have the smallest kitchen ever and not that much money to spend.&nbsp; ah well, one day.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a reward for turning in my work, I got a new cookbook, a nice Cook's Illustrated one, I've tried some of the curry dishes and they've all turned out really nicely.&nbsp; I accidentally bought self rising flour at the shop last week so I've been making biscuts.&nbsp; I do have a recipe for cinnamon buns.....hmmmm.<br /><br />I know I've said it before and I'll probably mess up again, but truly, I'll try to update more.&nbsp; honest :)<br />night all</div>"

"event","So I've started the new year by throwing myself into this internship and back into the city.&nbsp; Both seem to be going well, but overcoming jet lag is still an issue.&nbsp; I have a much harder time adjusting when going from the US to the UK, cause I lose five hours instead of gaining.&nbsp; It has made for a very sleep deprived week, but still, I'm doing okay.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""step this way for digressions on various items including chicken, books and man children...."">The institute has been great.&nbsp; It's a small, specialized library, so it's very quiet and has loads of cool or random books.&nbsp; They're in the process of reclassifying all their books, so I'm getting to help out with that.&nbsp; It's probably dull to most, but I'm getting to gain some experience with MARC (a way of typing in item information so it can be computer read) and general cataloging.&nbsp; All the staff have been super friendly and some of them went to UCL for the library program, so we swap stories.&nbsp; <br /><br />I've been doing a lot in the Dutch section and came across this lovely book yesterday.&nbsp; It was from the 1660s and had these gorgeous wood block prints of scenes of Amsterdam.&nbsp; They only collect primary documents so they end up getting a very unique assortment of odd or wonderful things.&nbsp; They also have this stack of books that were donated by Himmler before the Second World War, it's a bit insane looking at them and thinking of the concept of that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Though it has been very cool, I have been extremely tired cause of the jet lag thing.&nbsp; This is not helped by the fact that I wake up at 6:30, arrive there at 8 when it is just getting light, and then go home just as the sun is going down.&nbsp; Despite the depressing thought of that, I think it's actually helping me get over it quicker cause I have some sort of regular schedule, instead of just sleeping and waking up at odd hours.&nbsp; I do feel better today, but I did sleep in till 10, so that probably has a lot to do with it.&nbsp; The sun shone today too, and though I must be the one weird person on earth who actually enjoys an overcast sky, I do like it here when the sun comes out.&nbsp; Especially in winter, as it is a rare thing that should be treasured.<br /><br />I kicked my weekend off by making squash and mushroom risotto and watching some telly.&nbsp; Notably, a documentary by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Lo7Cw7o1Q"">Jamie Oliver</a> about chicken and egg production was on.&nbsp; It was pretty horrific, but also well done and Oliver was very professional and reasonable with the whole thing.&nbsp; It's made me more committed to buying free range eggs and better treated birds.&nbsp; Everyone I've talked to about it has been impressed by the show and its message.<br /><br />On the lighter side of entertainment, I found a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq-kK7GEb7M"">Top Gear</a> clip that at the very least, all my American friends will enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Sean so succinctly put, the hosts of Top Gear are man children with cars.&nbsp; This only goes to prop up that claim, and does nothing to dispell any stereotype we may have had about the southern US.<br /><br />Today has been tiring, but nice.&nbsp; Went into school to do some research, and got to sleep in yay!&nbsp; Then went grocery shopping.&nbsp; Grocery shopping is my favorite errand, and is actually a ritual that I enjoy.&nbsp; Due to watching the afore mentioned documentary, with idealism and hunger I bought an ethically indoor raised chicken, which wasn't that expensive.&nbsp; Now I need to figure out what I want to make with it.&nbsp; I suppose I should roast it.&nbsp; I might end up hacking it up a bit so it will cook faster though, maybe braise it with pan sauce.....hmmm time to do some research.<br /><br />Well, I'm off to look up some chicken recipes.&nbsp; I hope you're all having excellent weekends, mine hasn't been too shabby.&nbsp; Next week: internship part two, coursework freak out and Torchwood.<br />cheers<br />Cavewoman<br /></div>"

It added to the whole experience of feeling like I had landed on a different planet, which continued for the duration of my visit to America.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we holed ourselves up in her room, had Pimms o' clock and watched all of Life on Mars series 2.&nbsp; It was fantastic, thanks Carolyn, for easing my rentry into the the States.<br /><br />Almost missed the bus back home, but my lack of sleep and vacation/travel mode helped me to not worry about it too much.&nbsp; Came home to a more snow, two fuzzy dogs and a critical mother.&nbsp; Nothing new there, but it still felt like being on another planet.&nbsp; With the exception of seeing friends, this was quite possibly the most depressing Christmas.&nbsp; It didn't even feel like Christmas, and I'm still working out that it's a new year.&nbsp; I suppose it should have felt like Christmas, there were decorations, I made two whole Christmas dinners, and even horrible Christmas music, but I just wasn't feeling festive.<br /><br />Despite this, I was proud of my cooking, and I'm going to be a boastful sod and talk about it.&nbsp; I finally successfully roasted a hunk of animal that wasn't a bird.&nbsp; I am a lover of chicken.&nbsp; Red meat does not generally get me going unless something interesting is done with it, or it is a really good burger.&nbsp; However this Christmas, I was informed by my mother that we would be cooking beef.&nbsp; The rest of the meal was left up to me.&nbsp; It was actually a nice culinary challenge, and I poured over my meat-centric cookbooks for a few days before deciding on how to roast the two top rounds my mother had bought, and making a mustard, garlic, sage and honey paste to go over the meat before shoving it in the oven.&nbsp; Red meat still isn't my favorite, but this turned out quite nicely and I scarred my aunt by heating up the pyrex roasting pan on the hob to make the gravy.&nbsp; The pyrex didn't explode and the gravy went down well.&nbsp; I got my cousin to help me chop up some traditional English winter veg: leeks, parsnips, turnips and carrots.&nbsp; We also made mash, and the night before I turned out twenty-four popovers (yorkshire puddings for any brits reading this).&nbsp; My grandparents were supposed to bring dessert, but ended up not coming.&nbsp; Luckily I had made three pies to pad out their usual offering of cookies.&nbsp; The pear pie was the runaway favorite, surprisingly.&nbsp; There was also pumpkin, the usual fave, and mincemeat, my father's favorite.<br /><br />That was merely the first Christmas dinner, which actually took place on the 23rd, since my whole family admitted to each other one year that they were basically selfish, lazy and didn't want to actually go anywhere on Christmas day.&nbsp; It's worked out pretty well since then.&nbsp; My mom's friends came over on Christmas day, and I found ways of using some leftovers.&nbsp; The smaller roast got hacked up into smaller pieces and tossed in the food processor to make mince.&nbsp; From that and some of the roasted veg I made a bolongese sauce.&nbsp; With this, some bechemel and fresh pasta dad rolled out, I constructed a massive lasagna.&nbsp; This was served with some ciabatta I had made earlier, a salad, and leftover pie.&nbsp; Basically I cooked for 72 hours straight.&nbsp; Actually, I don't think my parents cooked at all while I was there.&nbsp; It was good though, it kept them out of the kitchen, which made it a nice space for me to be in.&nbsp; I also got to use all their nice kitchen equipment, a nice change from the kitchen in the flat which doesn't even have a microwave (I like to imagine that it is what people in the 70's would have dealt with, snorfle.)<br /><br /><br />Got to see oodles of friends, very very nice.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know when I shall be seeing many of you again, one of my biggest regrets of going abroad.&nbsp; Still, we're all wayward and drifting things.&nbsp; Going to uni and beyond didn't stop us, so I imagine that this obstacle shall be overcome as well.&nbsp; Rory came over a fair bit and made me many ginger things, namely candied ginger and ginger syrup, that when mixed with seltzer makes a fine ginger ale.&nbsp; While we were doing that, my mother had Graham Norton on, with Russell Brand as a guest.&nbsp; Now for those not in the know, Russell Brand is a slightly obnoxious, but humorous comedian, who dresses like someone from the 1880s with Amy Winehouse's hair, and loads of mascara, and is a self confessed nymphomaniac.&nbsp; My mother loved him.&nbsp; I'm still stumped.&nbsp; She should be annoyed with that beyond reason, and yet she finds him fascinating.&nbsp; Maybe I'll send her a copy of his book for her birthday and see what happens.&nbsp; snort.&nbsp; <br /><br />New Year's was also spent with Rory, but again, wasn't feeling festive, but very relaxed.&nbsp; I made dinner, and then we watched The Chatterly Affair, while drinking some cider.&nbsp; The movie was excellent, it's about the trial that sought to ban Lady Chatterly's Lover from being sold in the UK in 1960.&nbsp; The family sort of trickled in before midnight, and we watched more Top Gear, one of the few shows unanimously liked by every member of my family.&nbsp; Also saw a few minutes of Dick Clark, who we concluded must have been swapped out for a cyborg.&nbsp; Rory gave me a copy of Frankenstien for my Christmas gift with writing prompts, so there may be some attempts at writing fiction posted in the near future...wish me luck!<br /><br />Packing was a bit frantic, I forgot to bring my maple candy.&nbsp; Luckily Carl came over and helped me to shove everything in the bags and drove me to the bus station.&nbsp; Saying goodbye to everyone was a bit of a rushed affair, but I guess it's easier that way.&nbsp; I got to the airport super early cause of the bus schedules, but I had my copy of Frankenstien and dug in.&nbsp; The flight back was good, sat between two American students.&nbsp; Sort of slept, but not really.&nbsp; Watched Across the Universe, an interesting interpretation of Beatles songs.&nbsp; Glad I watched it, but would ultimately recommend not watching while in a sleepless state on an airplane, it's a bit like watching Rocky Horror in a dark room by yourself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Getting out of Heathrow and onto the Tube was a relief, even with my heavy bags.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I slumped into a seat after everyone cleared off at Hatton Cross, I felt very much at peace as we sailed up from under the ground.&nbsp; Oddly, it was pleasant to see rows of brick housing with back gardens, roundabout signs, red buses, pubs, even an overcast sky.&nbsp; I know that when I landed in September, I felt a kick of normalcy, but this was something else.&nbsp; I'm still working it out, but it felt very good, even in a semi delirious state dragging heavy bags up to my flat.&nbsp; I've spent most of my time now overcoming jet lag, still not sure how successful, but we'll see.&nbsp; Now that I'm back the full reality of school work and my internship can hit me.&nbsp; Oh well, better to be busy. <br /><br />As for 2008?&nbsp; I think that this year is going to be great, but also very unpredictable.&nbsp; I have a lot of choices to make.&nbsp; Some days it's absolutely terrifying and I don't want to even get out of bed.&nbsp; Mostly, I try to take a optimistic look at it, and that makes it positively fantastic.&nbsp; I'm over the moon that some of you will be coming to visit me.&nbsp; I can't stress enough how wonderful this city is and I really want to show it to you.&nbsp; So, to the new year, may it be full of adventure and new things to learn.&nbsp; Hell, even my cynical self is feeling giddy right now, so I might as well enjoy it.<br />cheers everyone<br />Liber</div>"

"event","hello all,
I'm supposed to be doing course work, but instead I'm stonewalling a bit by writing here and watching rain from my window.&nbsp; Does anyone even read this anymore?&nbsp; Oh, yes you....*waves to the lone person in the back* Thanks.&nbsp; Anyways......

Pretty good week.&nbsp; We got a tour of the Royal Society library, which was pretty awesome.&nbsp; The Royal Society was founded in the 1660s as a group where scientific ideas could be exchanged and now it's one of the most prestigious groups you can belong to as a scientist.&nbsp; Their library and building was gorgeous.&nbsp; It was originally four separate buildings, we only saw two sections of it.&nbsp; One was an 18th century residence that had been completely refurbished in the 19th century, it's got loads of paintings and carvings and gilding up the wahzoo.&nbsp; The other part we saw was the German embassy before the Second World War, and apparently Himmler used to walk the hallways while the Nazis were in power.&nbsp; Not only did we get to see the reading room, but also the archives and journal storage room...both of which are basically networks of rooms underground that have shelves and shelves of books, maps and pamphlets.&nbsp; And, like the library geeks that we were, we all breathed in the dusty smell that only massive amounts of old paper products can bring.&nbsp; We got to see the book of meeting minutes from the first meeting, as well as a chair that was owned by Isaac Newton, and a beautiful book of fish species and anatomy, that had beautifully engraved illustrations.&nbsp; all in all a good tour, and I'm glad I went.

Just frantically trying to get work done really.&nbsp; I'll be going home soon and it feels a bit weird.&nbsp; I've been here for about as long as I was for my semester abroad, and it's gone much quicker this time.&nbsp; No worries though, I'll be back soon enough.&nbsp; I am looking forward to being state side for a bit, to see everyone, and some trees that aren't surrounded by pavement.&nbsp; I've been watching this great cooking/farming series called River Cottage.&nbsp; It's set in Dorset, which is in a rural part of southern England, not too far from the coast.&nbsp; The utter pastoralness of it has made me a bit wistful for a less urban area.&nbsp; I have however, set out a goal to do some camping when it gets warmer, which goes along with my plan of seeing more of this gorgeous island.&nbsp; I've thought about compensating a bit in the flat by getting some pots of herbs, but I think I'd best wait till I get back from holidays or they'll probably be dead by the time I get back.

And people are starting to talk of visiting, hurrah!&nbsp; I'll definitely feed you if you show up and drag you around the city.&nbsp; It'll be great *probably looks a bit desperate*&nbsp; I'm not lonely here, per say.&nbsp; I've met loads of lovely people and everyone has been very friendly on the whole.&nbsp; However I miss you all, and want to share this place with you.&nbsp; sigh.&nbsp; I know, it's going to be some rough and wayward times ahead of us for the next few years, but if we all just hang in for a bit, it's going to be absolutely fantastic.
I'll write soon, I swear.....
cheers,

"event","Hi all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I meant to post earlier, but this week's been a bit of a pain.&nbsp; I spent three afternoons in the bank this week getting stuff sorted.&nbsp; I love this country and this island, but the banks and their service are another matter entirely.&nbsp; That said, most of it is sorted and once I got done waiting in the queue they were quite friendly and helpful.&nbsp; I will note that the British seem to have a more personable and humorous approach to something as boring as waiting in line.&nbsp; In my bank and in many other places where waiting in line is inevitable, there will often be a cheeky little sign making a joke about how horrible it is to wait in line.&nbsp; I'm not sure what this means from an ethnological or anthropological stand point, but I rather like it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanksgiving was an odd affair.&nbsp; Really despite all the happenings of the day, Thursday was rather normal.&nbsp; Overcast, a bit rainy, a bit windy and cold.&nbsp; A typical London day, and yet a continent away it was Thanksgiving.&nbsp; The school did host a Thanksgiving lunch for all the American students, which was rather nice of them.&nbsp; It was odd to be in a room full of American accents, my ears have gotten so used to British that is jarring to hear anything else.&nbsp; The president gave a nice speech, glossing over 'that spot of international bother 250 years ago'.&nbsp; I guess it is a bit awkward even though centuries have passed.&nbsp; In any case, they were sincere so I just enjoyed myself.&nbsp; We got turkey of course, with potatoes, carrots, parsnips, balls(yes balls) of stuffing, and the choice of either pumpkin pie tartlet things or cheesecake.&nbsp; They did look a bit confused and annoyed when we all took the pumpkin pie.&nbsp; I was told by a girl who sat across from me that this was a step up from last year when they tried to serve cream of shrimp soup.&nbsp; ha.&nbsp; I guess they looked more into authenticity this year.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They did booze us up well and good.&nbsp; I got offered champagne, two kinds of wine, and hard cider.&nbsp; After being in the temperance oriented midwest for four years, I think that European drinking habits are still a bit of a shock.&nbsp; of course, they are always a bit shocked to hear that there are entire counties and states in America that don't sell alcohol at all.&nbsp; I've never really joined the fray on this as I can live without alcohol, but am not opposed to it.&nbsp; I do notice that I drink more here, and definitely at social functions.&nbsp; I also love pubs, even if I don't have an alcoholic drink, it's great to go down to the pub with friends and just talk over a meal or drink.&nbsp; No where else I've been has managed to capture completely the atmosphere and energy of an English pub.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; a unique creature that must be enjoyed and savored here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a bit taken aback about how fast time has gone.&nbsp; Is it really almost December?&nbsp; It feels like there isn't enough time to do everything.&nbsp; That said, I think that I'm going to like next term better.&nbsp; There are less classes and I'm more into the topics on offer.&nbsp; However it will be when we have to choose a dissertation topic and that will be the beginning of that.&nbsp; eeep.&nbsp; Nah, I'll manage.&nbsp; I get to pick what to write about after all.&nbsp; I'm definitely going to go for a historical subject.&nbsp; I do wonder though if I pick something about the history of American libraries if there will be enough research material over here.&nbsp; We'll see.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must be off and start my reading about collection management policy so I can write one of my own.&nbsp; Fun fun.&nbsp; Be well, and to those of you who will be around at Christmas, I'll see you in a few weeks.

"event","THE PAPER IS DONE!!!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; okay, had to get that out of the way.&nbsp; That said, I now have to write and publish a web page about it......grrrrr.&nbsp; I am actually liking this writing web page thing, it's not so bad, might even go as far to say quite fun.&nbsp; I'll talk about that later though.&nbsp; I guess I should say happy Halloween; I kind of forgot with this paper thing going on.&nbsp; meh.&nbsp; Well, aside from the paper it's been an alright week.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classes are good.&nbsp; Learning HTML in computer class.&nbsp; Not as hard as I thought it would be.&nbsp; Our lecturer also showed us this <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkg2of--c-c"">video </a>in class.&nbsp; The humor is questionable, but it seemed funny at 9 am with no sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're learning how to do physical descriptions in cataloging, which includes things like page numbers.&nbsp; We also learned how to make an entry for a book for which a spirit claims responsibility of the contents.&nbsp; Apparently the spirit gets the main heading, and the medium who wrote&nbsp; everything down has to be second.&nbsp; who knew?&nbsp; Learning Library of Congress in classification where the LOC's thought process was condensed to one very humorous sentence "" It's no good, we'll just have to make a heading: Dog Scootering.""&nbsp; I was also apologized to by my British lecturer for the Brits burning down our national library in 1814.&nbsp; I'd like to see what an etiquette book has to say about the correct response for your former colonizer apologizing for burning down your library 200 years ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historical Bibliography was spent at the Type museum in Lambeth.&nbsp; Type, in the sense of printing equipment.&nbsp; We got to see hand molds for letters from the 1450s onwards, it was pretty amazing.&nbsp; Well, the most amazing part was seeing a working monotype machine.&nbsp; It has a container of molten lead, which gets pushed up into the molds.&nbsp; The letter is detirmined by a series of holes in a roll of paper being fed through the machine, which moves the <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Monotype_matrix.JPG"">block of letter molds</a> to the correct position.&nbsp; All the letters, pop up in rows of text and the whole piece of writing is ready to go to press.&nbsp; The woman who ran the museum was not as fun.&nbsp; She had a lot of knowledge, but kept wandering around in her digressions to us and at one point confided that ""Men are only good for two things: taking care of women and lifting""&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I snorfled too.&nbsp; Some of us made a run for it at 4pm, otherwise we never would have gotten out.&nbsp; Ooh, I forgot to mention, in class the week before, we got to see original copies of Hobbes Leviathan from the 1650s.&nbsp; These were printed by Andrew and William Crooke.&nbsp; The significance of this is that the book was banned during that period because of Civil War (the English one) monarchy/parliament issues, which also got Hobbes exiled.&nbsp; The Crooke inventory ledgers show none of these books however, because they were printed and sold for the black market.&nbsp; Thought I'd share, it's pretty exciting for the historian and librarian in me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I celebrated getting the paper done by making risotto and having a gin and tonic.&nbsp; Our reading week break is next week, but tomorrow is my last class, so really, break starts tomorrow.&nbsp; I got my internship placement for January.&nbsp; I'll be working at the <a href=""http://www.history.ac.uk/"">Institute for Historical Research</a>.&nbsp; It's pretty close to school and I have a class in the Senate House library, which is also right there.<br /><br />Well, that's all I can think of for now.&nbsp; I'll probably post more in a few days, now that I'll have more time.&nbsp; Have a good Halloween.&nbsp; <br /><br />cheers<br /><br />"

"event","Hi again
yeah, I know I said once a week. well...I'm getting better.&nbsp; Anyways the really big and good news is that there is internet at the flat! yay!!!! The downside is that I surf when I should be writing a paper on the digitization of libraries.&nbsp; October moves on and I suppose there's lots of little stuff to discuss since I've been a bit crap at updating.

Classes have been good.&nbsp; I'm actually enjoying cataloging and classification.&nbsp; I know, how could anyone possibly enjoy something that would make boredom look like a good idea?&nbsp; well, as my professor pointed out, the trick is that ""you have to convince yourself that it all really matters, getting the exact punctuation, because, of course, compared to global warming it doesn't really matter at all.""&nbsp; er, well that's a bit paraphrased, but the sentiment is the same. &nbsp; we have a giant book on Anglo American Cataloging Rules 2nd edition, it weighs a ton and pretty much tells you what info goes where and with what punctuation and what abbreviations are allowed.&nbsp; Historical bibliography is amazing and we get to handle books from the 14th and 15th century.&nbsp; 

The flat has been pretty excellent too, aside from some leaks.&nbsp; We've had two leaky sinks so far and a few nights ago we noticed the boiler leaking.&nbsp; we have a pan under it now and the land lord has been pretty prompt about fixing stuff so it should get sorted soon.&nbsp; Monika has been making us martinis this week and we've been grocery shopping a few times.&nbsp; yeah, we are definitely part of the jet set social life...ha.&nbsp; It's all good though.&nbsp; Right now I'm making chicken pot pie.&nbsp; over here they just call it chicken pie.&nbsp; One of Kate's dog's is called pot pie so it was quite humorous when I told her I was making pot pie for dinner.&nbsp; I also discovered that Monika had never had clotted cream before so we showed her the delightful sin that is clotted cream on scones with jam and tea.&nbsp; If you ever come across it in a supermarket in the states, I urge you to buy it, because it is fantastic.&nbsp; I have heard people talk about it in an almost forbidden and orgasmic fashion, and there IS a reason for that.

I've definitely gotten into a routine here, which is very nice.&nbsp; I have classes for three and a half days a week and try to get homework done on the days off.&nbsp; This will probably get muddled up soon, since I am starting to search for part time work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ended up going to a French movie, called The Dancer, with one of my class mates.&nbsp; we went to the 3:45 showing since we got out of class at three and there were only 2-3 other people there besides us.&nbsp; It felt weird going to see a movie on a Thursday afternoon, when for most of my life I would normally be in class or at work.&nbsp; It was also the first time I've been to a cinema in this country so the whole experience was pretty surreal, though that could have been the French  existentialism rubbing off on me.&nbsp; It was about an old guy who did gigs at dance halls and discotheques.&nbsp; He falls in love with a much younger woman and they spend a lot of time sitting in sparsely furnished rooms, smoking and talking about life.&nbsp; That said, I actually enjoyed it.&nbsp; I think I'm kind of rubbish when it comes to movies.&nbsp; I usually just let people say ""hey, this is good, let's watch it."" and just go with that.&nbsp; I do however put my foot down to horror movies and those of you who tricked me into watching the Exorcist on my birthday... well, you have subsequently given me chocolate on various occasions so I suppose I can forgive that transgression.

okay, well my pie is nearly ready to come out of the oven, so I'll have to dash.&nbsp; But I'm going to try and update more....honest!&nbsp; 
cheers
Cave Woman,&nbsp; as Kate has dubbed me .

PS I looooove comments."

"event","Hi everyone,
um, so yeah it's been a month since I last posted.&nbsp; many many apologies, I've only been having regular web access for about a week now in my defense.&nbsp; anyways, here I am across the sea.&nbsp; My flat is very very small, but my flat mates are lovely so the lack of room for even a kitchen table is overlooked.

London itself is fantastic, as always.&nbsp; I've been riding the bus into school everyday, which is both annoying and nice.&nbsp; Annoying because crazy or disgruntled people are more likely to take the bus and it also takes longer to get where you want to go because of traffic and road works.&nbsp; Nice because you can look out the window and connect different areas of the city.&nbsp; Particularly nice when I cross Waterloo bridge because I can see St. Paul's cathedral, the London Eye, Parliament and a bunch of other landmarks.&nbsp; You cannot deny being in London when you are sitting on a double decker red bus seeing all of this.&nbsp; My bus rides however, are going to be cut down because I just got my student oyster card and now I can buy an annual pass for the tube.&nbsp; An oyster card for my state side friends looks like a credit card, but is programmed with whatever travel pass or cash you have paid to travel, either on the bus, tube, train or tram.&nbsp; By entry or exit points there are yellow circles that you touch the card to and it deducts the cash or accepts your pass.&nbsp; It can even read the card through a wallet or holder.&nbsp; In any case, once I buy my pass, I won't have to worry about getting from point A to B too much.

Before school started I mostly got things for the flat, or went to museums.&nbsp; I'm really glad I came early because it let me ease back into the country and the city on my own terms.&nbsp; I was so sure I was going to forget fundamental things and have some sort of culture shock, but in all honesty I have been more shocked by how normal it feels.&nbsp; I am glad that class has started though.&nbsp; I do like to have a routine to my day.&nbsp; Right now I have Fridays off and next term I think I will have Mondays and Fridays off, but I can't get too excited cause I'll probably be writing my dissertation.

So far classes have been nice, we're going through our first week still, but we got introductions last week during orientation.&nbsp; Most of the week is taken up by cataloguing and classification.&nbsp; Now I know that some of you have teased me for this, but it is actually fun and the two professors that teach it are amongst the&nbsp; nicest.&nbsp; They're all very nice really.&nbsp; I find that to be generally true of most people involved in library work, it tends to attract non confrontational and somewhat relaxed people, even if we like doing tedious things like cataloguing.&nbsp; Americans pretty much set the standard for a lot of these systems so I'm learning what I would have learned in an American program.&nbsp; I knew this when I was signing up, but it seems more real and in some ways validating, now that I am here.&nbsp; Validating in the sense that I will be qualified to get a job in the US with the skills that I learn here.

My experience so far has been different from the last time I was here.&nbsp; I suppose it is logical that it would be.&nbsp; I'm living in&nbsp; a flat, I'm paying my own way, and I'm directly part of a British educational institution.&nbsp; I have found that there are more languague barriers this time around.&nbsp; Since I am not in contact with Americans all the time, or in fact most of the time, there is more room for confusion with certain words or subjects.&nbsp; I've been pretty good about it so far, and it's become somewhat of a fun personal challenge.&nbsp; It is complicated by the fact that I live with two people who use english as their second language so I am also spelling or defining a lot of terms too.&nbsp; It's all good though and I'm constantly amazed and humbled by their language skills.&nbsp; I don't think I could ever attempt higher education in another language.&nbsp; 

Well, I'm off to lunch, but I do promise to try and post more regularly from now on.&nbsp; This will probably get easier once we get internet in the flat.
Cheers,
Liber"

"event","Right, so progress so far.
Got entry clearance, so that's a load off my mind.&nbsp; It's a sticker!&nbsp; I couldn't quite believe that something so official would come in sticker form, but there it is, stuck in my passport.&nbsp; Very official looking too, with holograhic seals and embossed bits.&nbsp; It's possibly the most official and fancy looking sticker I have ever seen.&nbsp; Mostly, I have paperwork side of things ready to go and not so much on the packing side. hmmmmm.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of my procrastinating tendencies come out in full force for packing.&nbsp; I sort of stand speculatively over the empty duffle bag about a week before hand and tell myself it's okay cause I still need to wear clothes that I would pack, so I should wait and do laundry just before.&nbsp; Then I sort of make a pile of things that I don't use regularly, but will pack, like the toiletries bag.&nbsp; That pile is a bit bigger this time, maybe I'm getting better at this packing thing.&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; I have to pack for a year really and for a different continent/island to boot.&nbsp; I have a box of plug converter things, my oyster card, battery powered alarm clock (which has been damn useful in several situations, traveling or at home), and a few stray euros and pounds.&nbsp; My biggest challenge at this point is what clothing to bring and what books.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the books aspect might actually be harder.&nbsp; They are considerably heavier and I have a harder time giving them up.&nbsp; Silly me, I'm going to be surrounded by libraries and am worried about leaving books behind.&nbsp; I have allowed myself to take two cookbooks and have not determined how many on textiles I will allow myself.&nbsp; It will largely depend on weight, namely will it be under the airplane limit and can I drag this around the tube system by myself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite all my worries, I am getting a little bit excited.&nbsp; I say a little bit cause I am worried and as silly as that is to people, it's there and I need to acknowledge it.&nbsp; For good reasons too.&nbsp; mostly money, I don't really want to air that out here, but I think everyone can at least to some level understand that aspect of stuff.&nbsp; Also, I've kind of been living out at the edge of my village in the middle of nowhere since May and am now throwing myself into London.&nbsp; It happened this way last time and I did alright so I have few worries there.&nbsp; in fact, that is the part I am looking forward to the most.&nbsp; When I see London on the TV or in the news I feel connected to it, as well I should, it's going to be my home for a year.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event that any Londoners or Britons in general stumble on this, I just want to say that I love London.&nbsp; It is my favorite city.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So yesterday, I called Babbs for the sole purpose of figuring out which tube route to take from Heathrow to my flat.&nbsp; I think I've reached either a high point in my ability to find entertainment in seemingly dull activities or some sort of new personal low.&nbsp; meh.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently I'm awaiting the arrival of my mother and some yogurt so I can start making some chicken tikka masala.&nbsp; I suppose I should clear off a counter in here and start making some naan to go along with it. mmmm.&nbsp; I've tried out about three different versions of this recipe and though they all were slightly different, were all good.&nbsp; the real key seems to be how tomatoey and spicy you want it to be.&nbsp; If anyone has anything to say about the wonderfulness of indian food then feel free to comment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alright, I'm going to get over my lethargy here and start dinner.
later everyone,

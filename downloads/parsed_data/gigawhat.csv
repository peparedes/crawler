so yeah i am gaining back everything that i lost back in feb. because i am actually eating and am getting my appitite back. not to happy about that one, but i am finally able to eat! YAY!!!

okay gotta get to clas, just wanted to share about what my dad said. (and apparently he wants me to go back to not eating)"

"event","okay, so, i know i haven't posted in awhile. but i didn't realize it had been 15 weeks! the reason i know this is because buttons sent me a nudge, which is cool, but it let me know that i suck at keeping this thing up.

soooooooo......yeah, A LOT has been going on in the life-o-step-on-me. or at least it is about to get even more hectic!!! between the drinking, classes, concerts, and camp that is going to be happening within the next month...i don't know what to do. i'm starting to get into one of my yearly moods where i isolate myself from everyone and avoid my phone. i just don't feel like talking to anyone. so if anything important is going on or ya just feel like calling.....leave me a message and i'll eventually call you back. oh, and not to mention that i am starting to smoke. it is starting to be my way of releaving myself from stress. i know, not good. 

just in case you haven't heard, yes, i will be back at camp this summer as the....dun dun dun....pool director. i am SUPER nervous and VERY excited. i have to take about 3 classes before June 3rd and i am getting SUPER frustrated because i can't find one of them when i need/am able to take it. UGH!!!!! 

okay, i have to end the update ther because i have to get up at 7am to sit in on a classroom. i will try and update some more when i get the chance!"

"event","wow, major back-pain-age going on over here!!! and my parents are missing. i leave my room after waking up to say hi, and there is no sign of them. but ah well.....they are probably at the gym.

yesterday was my most favoritest day ever!!! i pretty much spent it all with billybob. if only everytime we were together was like last night. 

with every holiday, i always want to send people things or cards, just to say hey how are you, even though we really haven't talked for a year or two. so i buy the cards (a lot of them), write them out, and never send the damn things. or i buy the cards and that is it. so after i get off of the comuter (which is difficult for me to do for some odd reason), i am goning to get busy with it. i even named today do cards and homework day. i love naming the days (ex. be productive day), and not actually do what i say i'll do. a huge ARG! goes out to procrastination.

uruguay is in a little over 3 weeks. i am dreading it. being in a country where i am the only one that doesn't speak the language is going to SUCK SOME MAJOR ASS!!! if it were for maybe, one week, that would be different because that would come and go, no problem! BUT 3 WEEKS!!!!! what am i to do......oh just to add on a bit more of complaining....3 weeks of no cell phone or internet, being cut off from EVERYONE! and i'll be with my sister. shesh, i have a feeling i will be on my own a lot in the month of january. i asked billybob to come, but he can't take off for 3 weeks straight annndddd he doesn't fly (because he's never done it before). 
Billybob asked me last night ""what am i going to do without you for 3 weeks?"", i thought that was cute, but i was thinking the same thing about him.

okay, i'm going to get to the cards.homework before this entry turns into a novel. (i know i can find something else to complain about)

ARG!!!

this past week, i''ve been subbing at Matthew Henson Middle Scool. it isn't my fav. place, but it pays. they NEVER know where they are going to put me unil about 10 minutes after the bell rings and i am frantically running EVERYWHERE. i'm thinking i might not go back. but i dunno. seems like i ONLY work with the special ed kids, which i don't mind, but it gets difficult.

turns out, she called one of those phone sex hotlines!!!! it was hilarious. i asked her what they said because i didn't her anything, and she just said all she remembered was they said something about ""speading eagle"".

for my history class, all we do are group presentations. although i am burned out in the presentations department. this time, i was in charge of doing the powerpoint and the handouts, OH and WAIT!!! i also have to do a section in the talking bit, which i totally understand. i'm just frustrated, which is why i'm making a bog deal out of this. so much to do by tomorrow, because I LOVE TO PROCRASTINATE!!! FUN FUN!!! 

i think procrastination should be a disease and be treated! 

i am s....l....o...w...l...y starting to realize that i need to chill out about things. and i am trying to change. or at least go back to the way i used to be, before i started to easily freak out about things. i'm happy that ash-lay is 100% honest with me, because if she weren't, i wouldn't realize how i'm acting. yes i'm trying to get around something without actually saying it. Muahahahaha! so a chilled out less worrysome steph is on the way (hopefully). you just have to give me a bit of time to get used to it. 

OHHH how funny is this! i found out the other day that cliff apparently is either expecting a child soon, or has a new one. so that equals 2 (one is i believe 7 or 8 and the other is a youngin). which means that the entire time he's been calling me, trying to get back with me, he knocked up some girl. i was upset, but since i'm TRYING to start my new ways, i just laugh it off now. it freaks me out in a way, because that could have been me. yuck, but freaky.

my dad is looking for condos in the area. once again, i think this is funny too. (just thought i'd share that random comment.......hell, i am just one big random comment!) :) 
Burger, you have experienced the randomness and survived!!

toay i went to the saturn dealership for an oil change. that was an experience.....i waited for 2 hours!!! WHO DOES THAT?!? ah well, so i was waiting in the ""lounge"" when this lady came in and started bitching about how the people that worked there were treating her. once again, i thought it was funny, but wanted to be courteous. i listened to what she had to say, shook my head, and thought that would be enough so that i could go back to watching ellen and reading my magazine. but nope, she was a talker. 

i love it! ah well, will update latro!

Burger came to the dorf which was a blast. i got caught up on her and she got caught up on me. i think i finally got her to say that guys were assy. we went up to bowie to eat, shop, watch a movie, and eat again. the funniest thing happened while we were at the movies! we got there a bit early and were just chatting, well i called billybob and got pissy because he was assy then one of the people that worked at the movies came in and started spraying airfreshener all over the place. it was crazy! she walked in front of us spraying. something i never would have expected, but i had to remember that we were still in pg county. 
Burger.....thanks a ton for coming down! anytime your free again let me know!
on sunday, i was by myself until about 545pm-ish. but when he was here it was amazing! he did things that he had never done before. and it was WOW!

My mom and I think that the diet pills he's taking is effecting him in some way. Because he's been acting weird since he started taking them. He actually sent me a text message the other day saying that he found a teaching job in Iraq. WHAT IS HE THINKING?!?
I'm just trying to get A job so that i can get some money coming in. Then once I get it, i can start looking for a perminant job. I just need that green stuff (which is the stuff I LOATH!!) I also want to move out asap, and that is the only way i can do it.
Besides that, the board of ed. lost my reference forms. They say that they haven't recieved them. I think that is bull because one of my refs sent hers in 2 weeks ago! WHAT THE HEY!! is all that i can say. (hey that rhymed)
I can't say this enough......I LOVE BILLYBOB!!! More now than ever. He's amazing! Its almost been a year which is amazing in itself.

the ride up there wasn't all that bad when the driver FINALLY decided to get some air moving through the bus. apparently the air conditioning broke. once in new york, it was awesome. well, kind of. billybob loves just laying in bed and doing nothing. it doesn't matter when he is at. so we got our money's worth out of our hotel room. room service was good, not great, but tolerable. 
after a couple of hours, we realize that there is a firehouse right accross the street from our room. oh joy!! EVERY SINGLE time the truck left the place, he would jump up and watch it go. i have to admit that it was VERY cute the first coupld of times it happened because he was like an excited little boy. ah well, he's obsessed. it felt like we were stalking them in a way.
friday night, we meet up with splash, freckles, kenken, and poppins in Times Square. it was awesome to see them again. after eating kenken and poppins had to leave, so splash, freckles, billybob, and i go to toys r us. it was massive. once we had our little kid, get excited, look at toy,s play time end, the four of us went out seperate ways.
on saturday, billybob and i went to ground zero. he liked it. we walked around the entire area!!! they already have one of the buildings built! while we were there, there was apparently a bomb scare, so a huge part of the area was blocked off. it gave billybob time to take pictures of firetrucks. we stood there for a bit, staring at the firetrucks, of course i wanted to see the ambulances. but no, it was all about tose gosh darn firetrucks. after that whole thing we took a taxi back to the hotel cause his feet were hurting. he's too cute, i couldn't say no. we stayed there until sunday.
the bus ride back was great. he was my pillow, there was a movie that played, more leg room, and the airconditioning WORKED!!! YAY!!! (if you ever travel by bus, go by Peter Pan......NOT Greyhound!!!)

"event","So, ever since i got back from camp, sleeping has been difficult. I just don't do it much. It is worse now, than ever. I get to bed at about 2am, wake up about 4 times and would be perfectly fine with staying up, but since there isn't anything to do, i go back to sleep. I can't sleep past 10am. When i wake up, it feels as if I never went to sleep to begin with. I'm actually getting less and less sleep, and my body seems to be okay with it. The only time, it seems, that i am able to sleep ""normal"" is when i'm sleeping with Billybob. It just doesn't make sense to me. 
A lot of things have been running through my head recently. Some good, some not so good. I guess we'll have to see what happens with that.
My parents are worried that i might have diabetes. WHAT THE HEY!!! When they told me that, I almost flipped. BUT it does run on both mom's and pop's side. 
I'm getting worried about Jeremy. The last I heard was that he was going to Iraq, but that was back in umm....i think June. He's supposed to be there for a year. The thing that worries me, is that he didn't pop into my head until recently. Although when i say pop, i mean pop. Out of no where. I just said to myself,""I want him here."" Ugh!! I'm hoping that things are good and that there isn't anything to worry about.
The substitute job is still and i don't know. I'm going to call them tomorrow to see if my file is complete. (aka to see if they got all of my references)
Billybob is good. Or at least a lot better then i would be if i were in his situation. A friend of his that he practically grew up with passed away in a car accident, i think monday night. The viewing is tomorrow and the funeral is friday. If something like that happened to him, I don't know what i would do with myself. My heart goes out to that guys family. I've never had someone I knew/know pass away (knock on wood). But I can only imagine what it feels like. 
Today a guy came to take out a squirrel from our fireplace. It smelt DISCUSTING!!!! I'm not going to get into any details about it, but it wasn't pretty.
Classes are as good as they are going to get. I've got some pretty cool teachers this semester, which is a first. 
I'm tired of being home, so my goal is to save up money so that i can move my butt on out of here! ASAP! (might take some time, but at least its a goal)

Alrighty, I think that is all that is going on right now. Hope ya'll are doing great out in computer land!!!


Oh yeah, before I forget.......HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATY!!!!

Today is such a special one
Its Birthday time for you!
I'd really like to celebrate this happy day with you, 
SO, zippity ay and hidey ho there's something I can do

So today was cool!! I met up with Crystal to look at some miniature horses!! I REALLY WANT ONE NOW! They are so cute. She is going to get another one and hasn't decided on which one. she's stuck between a female that has one blue eye and one brown or a male that is sooooooo cute. he's the one that i want! he has short legs! and for those of you that know about my animal with short legs thing, then you know what i mean! The guy is selling the horses for $800, but he wasn't sure. I seriously CANNOT afford that, so i will try and convince crystal to get the male so that i can pretend he's mine and help her out. BUT before we went to look at the mini's, we went to Target! We saw this huge firetruck there that was i think 15 bucks. We debated on getting it for the guys at the firehouse, but nah. THEN, we saw these shoes that we both loved.....but of course, there was only one pair!!! WHO DOES THAT?!? (obviously target does) Crystal and I in Target are dangerous! We wanted to buy everything we put our hands on!!!
SO.....that was today. Billybob was supposed to come over tonight, BUT he ended up having to move hay for the second day in a row! He works himself too hard sometimes (both at work and at home). I love him to death! I think as each day passes i love him even more. he just amazes me more and more. I am actually getting SUPER excited about this weekend.

"event","hellooooooo all!! just wanted to post a lil sompin sompin!!

soooo school has started and it seems okay. my bio teacher needs some ass cause thats all that he talks about.
 
On the 9th i'm going with billybob to NY. Its his first OFFICIAL trip out of the state of maryland. (virginia doesn't count in my book.) So i'm hoping it turns out to be a good experience for him. I also get to see Splash, so I am super super excited!!! Oh and Freckles. (maybe KenKen, Poppins, and Tigger)

Money seems to be an issue, but when is it not? I hate the stuff with a passion. And i'm looking for a job, which is no fun. Might do some substituting.

hmm......just issues in general, but it'll all be good.

I had a ""talk"" with billybob last night about him joining Bel Alton. I don't like it, but he loves it down there. Just when i thought Cliff was out of my life, he comes right back in. Billybob and I are yet again a secret, and i hate it. Apparently everyone at bel alton knows about me and ugh......why?!?  WHATEVER!"

Billybob called around 2 being an ass and telling me that he was outside, so i went to look and of course, he wasn't. We talk for a bit cause he's at the firehouse in Bel Alton. At about 430ish he calls me again and is being annoying. All he would say is why. The next thing i know, my doorbell rings. So i go downstairs to see who it was.......it was him!!! How cute is he?!? I love him to pieces!!!!! Athough he smelt like crab.
I'm listening to Seal. And I am addicted!! Last summer it was Luther, now its Seal. Pooh and Money got me hooked. This summer was slammed packed with drama. But it wouldn't be camp without it. The things that were told to me were shocking. But thats about it that i can share. I do miss it in a way, but then not. I have to admit that session 8 was awesome (besides the stress). We stole the extention cord and the fans from waterfront and put them in our glen shelter. We just plugged the cord into Ridge Lodge. 
Alrighty gotta go, but i'll try and update this thingy soon!"

Things are good so far. There is one more day of classes so i can't complain. AND its only going to be about 30 minutes long so thats even better!!! After class Ashley and I are going to Sakura which is awesome, but then not cause that means tomorrow's the last day i'll ever have a class with her. Which makes me sad, but i think we will live. (Hopefully)

OHHHH! So i'm laying in my room watching tv and at 12:15am someone calls my house from a private line. WHO DOES THAT?!?!

Anywho, today was the last day er ummm.....night for my Integrating the Special Ed Student class. It was a fun class! The teacher is AWESOME!!!! I learned a lot from this class too. I wish that all of the teachers i had/will have were all like her. Turns out i got an A in the class!!! WOO HOO!!!!! My first official A at CSM! (Because lifeguarding really doesn't count) Now i can add that with all of the B's and C's.

Billybob and I are doing good. I think we needed the weekend that we had, where it was just him and i. Everytime i'm with him, it seems that i love him so much more. Even though he has a gas problem, but you kind of get used to it after awhile. (thought you all would like to know :)

I'm STILL nervous about camp and am still drawing blanks. I got my staff manual from last summer and highlighted stuff, but i just don't know. It's easy for people to say ""You went through it so just use what you learned when you were a CIT"" BUT that was 6 years ago. OY!!! I can barely remember what i did a few days ago and they want me to go back 6 years?!? I'll figure something out though. It seems i do my best at the last minute, which is scary, but its going to have to do for now. (side note: I have to start packing for camp next week!! Ahhh!!)

I am super nervous about flying to Hawaii, and have a lot of anxiety about it. If the flight wasn't 10 hours, i might be able to handle it. I've flown a ton, but i still don't like to do it, and have had bad expierences. So i guess we will see what happens in about a week. 

okay, i think i'll end my babbling here. now that i read through it, all of this is really random, but its 1am.....WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT?!?!

Night!! Sweetdreams!!!"

I have a very busy 3-4 months ahead of me. Not only is there school and a trip to Hawaii in the near future.....BUT i also have to plan right now for 8 weeks. I am nervous about it, and i hope it all works out. So that means 10 weeks in the woods, and yes folks, i am officially the CIT Director for Camp Potomac Woods this summer!! I saw Sparky at the GS office in DC and she congratulated me and said that she thought i'd do great, which adds a bit more pressure. Now I have a HUGE expectation to live up to besides Pooh and Dizzy. (Redbug.....are you definetly coming back?!?!?!)
I had gone to the office to see if they had anything on a presentation i had to do for class, but it ended up being a little camp reunion!! I saw Sparky, Plucky, Pooh, and Spots. It was cool because i was a bit nervous, well, i still am. So if you guys have any ideas that i could use or should do with the CIT's this summer, please let me know. I am going to need help with some ideas!

Things between me and billybob seem to be changing, and i am not liking it one bit. He's acting weird and says that nothing is wrong. There's nothing i can do, which is what is bothering me the most.

"event","To Kill an American 

You probably missed it in the rush of news last week, but there was actually 
a report that someone in Pakistan had published in a newspaper an offer of a 
reward to anyone who killed an American, any American. 

So an Australian dentist wrote the following to let everyone know what an 
American is... so they would know when they found one. (Good on ya, 
mate!!!!) 

An American is English, or French, or Italian, Irish, German, Spanish, 
Polish, Russian or Greek. 

An American may also be Canadian, Mexican, African, Indian, Chinese, 
Japanese, Korean, Australian, Iranian, Asian, or Arab, or Pakistani, or 
Afghan. 

An American may also be a Cherokee, Osage, Blackfoot, Navaho, Apache, 
Seminole or one of the many other tribes known as native Americans. 

An American is Christian, or he could be Jewish, or Buddhist, or Muslim. 

In fact, there are more Muslims in America than in Afghanistan. The only 
difference is that in America they are free to worship as each of them 
chooses. 

An American is also free to believe in no religion. For that he will answer 
only to God, not to the government, or to armed thugs claiming to speak for 
the government and for God. 

An American lives in the most prosperous land in the history of the world. 

The root of that prosperity can be found in the Declaration of Independence, 
which recognizes the God given right of each person to the pursuit of 
happiness. 

An American is generous. Americans have helped out just about every other 
nation in the world in their time of need. 

When the Soviet army overran Afghanistan 20 years ago, Americans came with 
arms and supplies to enable the people to win back their country! 

As of the morning of September 11, Americans had given more than any other 
nation to the poor in Afghanistan. 

Americans welcome the best, the best products, the best books, the best 
music, the best food, the best athletes. But they also welcome the least. 

The national symbol of America, The Statue of Liberty, welcomes your tired 
and your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, the homeless, 
tempest tossed. These in fact are the people who built America. 

Some of them were working in the Twin Towers the morning of September 11, 
2001 earning a better life for their families. I've been told that the World 
Trade Center victims were from at least 30 other countries, cultures, and 
first languages, including those that aided and abetted the terrorists. 

So you can try to kill an American if you must. 

Hitler did. 

So did General Tojo, and Stalin, and Mao Tse-Tung, and every bloodthirsty 
tyrant in the history of the world. 

But, in doing so you would just be killing yourself. Because Americans are 
not a particular people from a particular place. They are the embodiment of 
the human spirit of freedom. Everyone who holds to that spirit, everywhere, 
is an American.

So i've been talking to Cliff a lot recently. Apparently he's cleaned up his life a lot, but i don't believe a word he's said to me because of what happened last year. He says he's going to pay me back super soon because he went to court on the 18th and that went well, so all he has to do is pay his lawyer and then its my turn. I hate money!! I honestly do. 
Billybob....wow! i love him soooo much! He and I are constantly talking about our future, and it feels right. So some of ya'll better be ready to recieve wedding invitations in about uh....5 or so years ;). Its hard to see me without him. My parents like him too....which is a mahor plus!

WOW!! Is all i can say about last night! All I can say id that i like shots!!! They get you more intoxicated at a fast rate!!!! I went to Cornerstone in College Park. It was alright. There were too many pretty people there...mainly the boys. (Katy, you know what i mean!) So last night Deena bought me a Vodka and Cranberry..I highly DO NOT reccomend it! SOOOOOO nasty! As i was drinking it iwanted to throw it up, ut she bought it so i dunno. Then this lady from Budweiser was passing out free beers, so i got a Bud Select free of charge. After that I suggested shots, and boy were they a crowd favorite! We started of with a tequilla shot, then went to an italian surfer, and then 2 shots of electric lemonade! the last 3 were good but it all went to the head super quick! 
AFTER all of that, we went to some Pita place in CP and i got free food!!! How about that?!? Deena and Kiki went ahead of me cause i didn't know what i wanted, but then i finally picked someting and the guy at the register said it was on him. I asked if he was sure, and he said yeah so i saved about 8 bucks! I was boosted but really didn't show it cause of the intoxication. BUTTTTT i dunno. The whole night was fun, and i get to go out again tonight with Ashley, Crystal, and Kiki to bars in Charles County (which mean they are iffy nes). One is even a bier bar! How fun is that gonna be?!? I'll be sure to tell ya'll about it!  I AM STARVING AND KIKI WON""T HURRY UP!!! YOU SHOULDN'T KEEP A BIG GIRL WAITING WHEN SHE'S HUNGRY!!! I DON'T THINK SHE GOT THE MEMO!!!

School is going pretty well, so far, there's only 2 classes that i can't stand which are History and Geography. Both of the professors are monotone so falling asleep is an option but i have to fight that one for the moment. Money is still a damn issue since i'm paying for my own bills. I'm slowly learning how to spend less on credit cards because i eventually have to pay for them. And work isn't helping since i get paid next to nothing and make next to nothing on tips.
I seriously can't wait til Valentine's Day. This is the very first year that i can actually say that. Wooty woot!!! This is actually the first time that i am this happy in a realtionship. I love him with EVERY inch of my body and soul and its super freaky, but we will see where this leads. I don't know if there is anything else that i can say.....
Krystal's new dog is sooo cute, but is really annoying. It yells over everything, kind of hilarious, but VERY annoying.  
I have decided that i'm going to take a break from camp this summer. I might join on the bandwagon and come back in 2006. But we will have to see about that one. BUT no worries....i will visit this summer, i can't just leave all together :)

I got power back on Friday at night, went out, had to get up early(7:00am=( )to build set till 9:30pm and then i was suppossed to go to a party, but I was too darn tired. Next morning woke up at 7 again =( and had to move the set to Plantation High School, because our auditorium is no longer usable, which by the way sucks (donkey)! So yeah, it was a fun weekend! 

As I read journal entries i notice how many people had power before I did, and I get very jealous. I had rehersal all week at cast members houses, and then as I was building set and moving it I got called Butch and Home Depot lesbian the whole time. Fun! Fun! Fun! GRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!! I'm so over it right now, But the show MUST GO ON!!!! no matter what. So now its at Plantation High playing Nov. 17-19 at 7pm and on Nov. 20 at 2pm.

I hope that lots of people come!!!"

I get that its to protect against HIV/AIDS however, straight people and girls get HIV/AIDS too. Its just such an outrage. If they are going to try and have clean blood in that sense then it should be anyone who has had sex, But then nobody would show up (or close to nobody). ARRRRGHHHHHHHHH!!!"

"event","Labor Day weekend was fun. I had a Meet the Directors night on Friday. That was interesting (good food), except at the end when people were supposed to ask questions and be all involved...........well it was like in Ferris Bueller's day off where Ben Stein is like ""anyone.......anyone......anyone......anyone.......anyone.........anyone."" Yeah that was kind of a downer for the evening, but people signed up for doing things and so i hope parents become involved in the upcoming play, which is for those of you that don't know, it's called You Can't Take It With You. and it is playing November 10-12 and 18-20. I'm in it, and yes this time I have more than two lines =), and I'm also the costume designer so thats fun and exciting. Anyway I hope people come and enjoy it because it is a funny and quirky comedy with a meet the parents vibe. On Saturday, it was a pretty lazy day, except that at night I had Ronnie and Sean over and we all just hung out. Then Sunday my mom and Sterling and I went thrift store shopping for costumes and I think it was a good productive trip. We found suspenders, gloves, and bow ties and this really cool rich gown thats 1930's style. OHHHH! let me tell you about my lovely cat named April. Lately, she has developed this nasty habit of piddling on things, like Rachel's brand new purse that was on the floor for just seconds, and then on sunday that brat got right in the sofa and pissed on the thrift store bag and the new dress and my sweater. grrrrrrr I chased that cat around with a stick and locked her in the bathroom where she remains today until she can stop pissing everywhere!!!! 
Well I'd say thats the extent of my weekend."

Your birth on the 19th day of the month adds a tone of independence and extra energy to your life path. 

But at the same time, it poses a number of obstacles to overcome before you are able to be as independent as you would like. The number 1 energy suggests more executive ability and leadership qualities than your path may have indicated. 



A birthday on the 19th of any month gives greater will power and self-confidence, and very often a rather original approach. However, a somewhat self-centered approach to life that may be in conflict with some of the other influences in your life. 

This 1 energy may diminish your ability and desire to handle details, preferring instead to paint with a broad brush. 



You are sensitive, but your feeling stay somewhat repressed. 

You have a compelling manner that can be dominating in many situations. 

You do not tend to follow convention or take advice very well. 



Consequently, you tend to learn through experience; sometimes hard experiences. 

The 19/1 is a loner number and you may experience feelings of being alone even if you are married. 

You may take on a tendency to be nervous and angry.</td>

You seem to be straight forward, but you keep a lot inside.

You tend to avoid confrontation and stay away from sticky situations.

You're open to new people and friends, which makes you a pretty popular person.

You tend to dream big, but you worry that your dreams aren't attainable.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howdoyouliveyourlifequiz/"">How Do You Live Your Life?</a></div>"

You're a kissing pro, but it's all about quality and not quantity
							  You've perfected your kissing technique and can knock anyone's socks off
							  And you're adaptable, giving each partner what they crave
							  When it comes down to it, your kisses are truly unforgettable</td></tr><tr><td align=""center"" bgcolor=""#FFA5B2""><h3 style=""margin: 0; border: 0;"">Part Freaky Kisser</h3></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=""#FFDBE0""><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.quizdiva.net/kindkisser/freaky.jpg""></div>
When you kiss, you want to experience something new
							  A new technique, a new partner, a new piercing...
							  And your own personal kissing style is very unpredictable
							  There's no saying where your tongue or hands will go</td></tr></table>

"event","<STRONG>After power came back on at my beloved abode, my family decided that we were going to celebrate by going out to sushi. We first tried our favorite sushi buffet, it has the baby octopus that we so love. It was closed. We then went to our other all-you-can eat place but that was also closed. So we tried the last of our good sushi places and that was also closed. Keep in mind that we were HUNGRY!!! and we were very excited about having sushi! We decided to try <EM>Buco De Beppo</EM> which is a very tasty italian place, but the wait was like over 45 minutes! We bot back in the car and headed to a chinese buffet, and our standards had greatly lowered by that time, and this place smelled and had screaming kids and the wait was about 1 hour. We then walked to the japanese bar/grill but that wait was unbearable plus it smelled as well. On our last hope we went to the McDonalds of sushi restaurants. It was not remarkable and to put the icing on the cake, the special meal we were hoping for seaweed salad.........they ran out of it! Later that night it turned out that my poor mother got sick from the meal. So that was our hurricanes over, powers back on celebration. It was soooooo much fun.</STRONG>"

"event","I Hate Hurricanes. I think the only good thing was that i was able to stay home from school for 2 days and well all of Thursday was fun and party like. I had no power at the end of that day and then none the next day and on Saturday when I finally got power back we were soooooooooo hot and angry it was a huge relief. I hope that no more come because otherwise I'm throwing a big shit fit at the weather."

"event","So yesterday i was minding my own business at the computer when i feel a slight tickle on my foot, I look down and i see a big cockroach, So I let out the biggest scream i've ever heard myself do and my protector(mommy) was not coming so i had to kill it myself. It was very terrifying. Then my friend comes over and im crying at the door. He comes into my room and picks up the bug (I'm going to name him Randall) and I'm crying, he holds Randall right up to my face and says ""yep hes dead"" so i get more upset. To top this all off my protector, who did not show up as she is supposed to is yelling at me for making to big of a fuss. That happened all yesterday and that was why i was pissed off."

"event","well my weekend went very well. on friday i went out with kaleo.he blindfolded me and we went to a rest. called sweet water. it was very nice. we talked about everything. and apparently he felt as if we have been dating since the beginning of time (the summer). but nothing was truly official. so i asked him the smart question of so am i your girlfriend now and he looked at me like a dee-dee-dee and said we are dating. so i'm a girlfriend. he said it if looks like a duck, smells like a duck... there for we have been an item for a minute in his eyes. since june by his opinion. so i'm a girlfriend. although nothing really feels different. i mean he totally went through the line that we went on vaycay together (homecoming), he met my friends, see each other just about every weekend. so logically one could think that. so i felt like a dum-dum, but he understood my logic. i think that he understood my feelings too. but regardless of the technicality we are courting. lol! 
work is work. i wish i were home just chillin. arrg!"

"event","well lets see it's been practically a month since i have spoken to him. and i just can't believe how things just turned into shit, because he was weak. that he was dishonest and has really yet to realize the pain he caused me or fix the situation. that my heart is torn as he goes on believing that he will be some famous recording engineer, when i wanted him to be a loving boyfriend and possibly more. but it's almost a week before it makes month #2 and i found myself looking through my old box.

reading through letters of ""i love you"" and ""lets have a family one day."" all his dreams included me, but i guess i wasn't what he really wanted in the end. he wanted to turn a 7 year friendship into shit and abandon the one person who would have stayed by his side... who stood by his side. so i just have to do something else. not give myself totally to a person. to believe in them when everyone doubts him. that at least i kept true to myself and i didn't move there. i think he always hated me for that. but now he won't have to deal with my ideas and he won't have to worry about me climbing into his arms again. goodbye the old drea: the dreamer, the mother, the wife, the therapist... hello new drea!

i cannot thank my friends enough. that i didn't lose ya'll. i just wish that he would have loved me more. loved me in the way that i used to love him. but you can't make someone love you."

"event","well i take in all the comments that are left by ya'll and i appreciate every one. truth is i did my best and he couldn't compromise even when i gave alot. truthfully that isn't right, most girls wouldn't did what i did for him. and he just punked out when it was time for him to really stand by my side. i wish that he would mature and figure out what he wants. i knew that family and friends were very important in my life and i wouldn't trade them for anything. once i have a bond with you it takes hell to get me from your side. and that is how i felt. i would have keept trying until i just couldn't anymore. i am that kind of person and friend. i don't give up, i guess that is why i have so many friends. things get difficult, you talk about it and try to agree. never abandon your fellow man, be selfless in life. my faith has taught me to sacrifice. and i followed my heart and did just that. when i look back i had no regrets, i kept every promise. i meant every kiss and every word. i wanted to be his wife, i wanted to be his support. and now i will never be those things. not because i cheated, or thought that he was worthless. it was because he didn't have the strength... something i thought that our love had.
everyone says give your heart some time and you will see where it leads you. maybe this is just a temporary seperation and maybe it is more than just that. i just can't wait, my heart cannot wait for him one more minute. he must want me, i cannot chase him. which is why i won't call, my heart can't bare to be rejected. to hear him not regret one thing that he said. i don't regret not going to f.l. every day i pride myself on it. i just really miss my old friend. the guy who was honest and caring, that last thing that friend would have done was abandon the one person who tried to believe in him the most. and i tried to believe, because i thought that he believed in me.
well enough of the blues i am gonna go to lunch with my gf-tia. it will give me some insight of the world and well it's great to see a friend. i just thank god for the strength he gives me every morning."

recently i have been thinking about him, i don't want to, but i do. i think what if some how he ends up in md again. what would i say what would i do? then i realise that he never wanted to come back, even if it was for me. i don't think that i will see him again. that makes me sad. i used to believe that our love was so strong, that it was meant to be, but maybe i was just a dreamer. maybe the whole thing was in my head. it's just strange looking back at my feelings i would have done many things for him. but i just wish that he could have done the same for me."

"event","today i have my interview and i am excited. i've prayed on it and that's it! althought it is a drag having to show up for work. but here i am putting on a smile and i shall get through the day. last night vince and i actually talked and it was so nice. it felt like things were getting better. i am trying to plan a picnic for he and i when he comes home. something quiet and romantic, something we haven't done before. speaking of vince SUSHI i want to do a double or triple date thing on april 14th. is anyone in for Kaz Bistro in D.C.? if i don't do the date now well it won't happen in a long time. i am just glad that things are getting better. i lost another pound too!

so phi mu formal happened already *tear* i miss those days. but ha i have more great moments to go. i really want to have a phi mu reunion though every year. like during the summmer so alums and sisters can actually hang out since sister+alums+alcohol=bad in some cases. but if it's not a sponsered event then HEY a good time. maybe cee and i should work on it together since we disucssed it like ""years"" ago.

i am working on my jewelry sketch book still i bought some materials weeks ago, so i am totally on a jewelry kick, but i don't have a torch or all of my supplies. but i know that things will get kickin during the summer.

kayla is WAY BETTER! she is jumping around and being loving again. i really love that puppy. she is my everything and i feel that vince and her may not get along. well that is between them to figure it out.

i am thinking about dying my hair to surprize V. i think that he will be shocked well if i can ever figure out a color. well that is all."

"event","well i went to h&m during my lunch break and i bought a cream skirt designed by madonna. i bought a cream cardigan and another pair of black pants. of course the skirt costed the most. i didn't even get a chance to try it on. i bought a size 12 and well if my hips were an inch smaller it would have worked, so had to get a 14 :(, but in the regular stuff a 12 and even that wasn't skin tight, i have ROOM. but i am sad i tried to call vince again and his phone is off. i am just not going to call him anymore. i just hate that i try to phone him and NOTHING. i talk to his answering machine more than i talk to him these days. i just want to go home now. it's been a long day, not bad, just long. i just want to wash my hair and play the sims or to just drive around with the windows down. 

thank you liz for caring and i really hope that things get better. *sigh*"

"event","well i write this because my girls will understand. recently vince has been well out of it, like not the same and i know it's probably stress and everything, but i miss my old boyfriend, the one who didn't act like a 1,000 year old man. the guy who could talk to me on the phone and actually be excited about virgin fest 2007. i miss my rocker not this old man river he has turned into. first thing vince says is it's gonna be expensive. WHO CARES we are young and it's the POLICE and SMASHING FUCKIN' PUMPKINS. recently things really haven't been great between he and i. vince says he's sick and stressed and well i hope that is the case. all i know is i miss my boyfriend. the guy that would love the idea to spend two days rockin out in the summer, he used to be so exciting and that's what i loved about him. vince was the one that got me all punked out and helped me ""free"" myself. and i just want him to be free too. this is frustrating and there isn't anything that any of ya'll can do. i'm not goin throgh a pms rant, i just want vince to be vince and not well his ""dad."" since my depression i've really wanted to begin living life. to enjoy my youth instead of living under a rock. i just want to enjoy the warm weather, dance in the rain, eat all the sushi i can, make out, and freakin rock out. i just want to smile these days... i just want to smile. i dunno i think that he is just stressed i love him, but i just want him to be happy again to be my little wing."

"event","well kayla's operation was successful, but last night i didn't get much sleep since she was crying. she didn't like the anest. that was putting her to sleep and she was in discomfort. i just felt so bad and a part of me regrets getting her fixed i took away her ability to have babies, but i had to. i couldn't take care of her and her pups. and i wouldn't want to sell them to strangers. it would break my heart. right now she is still mad at me and she won't be back to normal until 2 weeks from now. i miss my kayla boo i miss her being happy.

well lack of sleep due to her cries has made it for an interesting day. i am just sleepy and i just want to crash. my day is better than yesterday, but i still don't feel like myself. maybe a nice hot bath will do me some good."

"event","well today i just want to go home crawl up in a ball and cry. the culprit PMS, but it is brought on by other issues. work sucked today, wish i would have stayed home and i am worried about kayla and her surgery. i just wish that i could be there for her. that i could hold her little paw. instead i sit at a desk doing meaningless work. and when that work stresses me out i turn to vince who could not be reached by phone. i am kirk out. when he finally calls i just start crying and say that ""i'm not happy"" and ""i'm tried of this."" truthfully i just want to be a normal couple that sees each other, that can go to the movies and hold hands. the most action i've seen is from my dog. and even she gets fed up with me, so i am left feeling alone. in a office full of people i feel alone and i know that it's the hormones that make me engulf all sweets in sight and soon it will be over, but i am a little fed up with not being able to see someone you love. all the cute i miss yous have an underlying belly cry just waiting for alcohol to release them. i spend my life doing what's ""right"" when sometimes the wrong things will make me happy. just getting on a plane with kayla to see vince is what i want to do. but i don't do that planning is more important than happiness. and i don't just leave work for lunch and never come back although that is what i really want to do sometimes.
my life is full of regrets of not doing the bad things. not skipping classes in high school, not calling out sick when i wasn't. i think sometimes i do things that are too good. i never really buy designer clothes when i can't afford them or deface public property. i am the nice girl that everyone knows won't do messed up things. and that isn't true. i hide her, but she lives deep inside. and right now she just wants to get a lighter place it near a sprinkler and have them go off all over the building; just because i saw it done in a movie. but i don't i just stare at the sprinkler and imagine what would happen if i did that. so i'll imagine many things from this desk and i will be the good girl."

"event","well today has begun quite interesting, i spilled milk in my car, the milk i was going to eat my cereal with. i bought some more at cvs. but my weekend went well i gave the dog a bath, went to church, ate lunch/dinner with a co-worker at gracie's. they have great sushi and it was just nice to hang out with someone new. vince passed an important test, his certification for ProTools. So he will be graduating with a ""b.a."" that makes him very happy and i am proud of him. vince and i still aren't perfect, but no one is that. it is just hard being apart and having the normal issues in your relationship. that most fight would be avoided if i could actually look into his eyes to know what he was saying. that sometimes i just get tired of talking i just want to lay in bed and do nothing at all; just lay and enjoy the moment. sometimes talking can be so overrated."

"event","I have such papal cred.&nbsp; My favorite for title of De Gloria Olivae
was Carlo Cardinal Martini.&nbsp; I was campaigning for Martini who is
an intellectual (linguist, jousted with Umberto Eco, respected New
Testament scholar) and a liberal (though not Kung level) firebrand.
Unfortunately, Martini has as much chance as Cardinal Law being elected
(even that seems more likely) because he's also an eeeeeeeevill
jebbesuit. Long story short, the Vatican has never liked the Society of
Jesus and it won't start liking them now. He's also retired his from
post as Archbishop of Milan and is a bajillion years old. However, on <a href=""http://www.paddypower.com/bet?action=show_type_by_main_market&amp;category=SPECIALS&amp;ev_class_id=45&amp;id=520"">PaddyPower</a>,
Martini has gone from being a 20-1 shot to being tied for first place
with Cardinal Lustiger 4-1.&nbsp; Ratzinger has dropped to third, with
Hummes and Arinze following. The only thing I can think of is that I
have special King-making skillz when it comes to papabile.&nbsp; For
the record I was wrong about the last election too, but let's hope that
they won't make the Grand Inquistor infallible.<br>

With a tree branch you reach out and hit five or six more students with more
intelligence, ambition, and and/or talent than me.&nbsp; The world doesn't
fucking want another mediocre writer with conventional bland tastes shaped by
forces already making better dreamers, writers, artists.&nbsp; The issues I
care about are already being covered thoroughly and by people much better than
me (morally and intellectually).&nbsp; To be bluntly honest, I'm finding it
hard why people should even bother with another shrug of a personality like
myself.&nbsp; Angry young woman trapped by bourgeoisie values of the American
middle class?&nbsp; Read Prep, Elizabeth Wurtzel, or just look under Bitches on
the Barnes and Noble shelves.&nbsp; I have nothing to offer to the world that
hasn't already been done to death, and I am sorry for everyone
who gave their best to me thinking that I could have.</p>

<br>
<strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">Things haven't changed all that much where George W. Bush comes
from. Houston is a cruel and crazy town on a filthy river in East Texas
with no zoning laws and a culture of sex, money and violence. It's a
shabby sprawling metropolis ruled by brazen women, crooked cops and
super-rich pansexual cowboys who live by the code of the West -- which
can mean just about anything you need it to mean, in a pinch.<br>
<br>
Thompson distills all the evil, ugliness, and </strong>cholesterol <strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">soaked </strong>obesity <strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">of Houston into three sentences.&nbsp; Welcome to the home of Tom DeLay
(via Sugar Land AKA the #2 </strong>destination<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> for white flight from
Southwest Houston), Halliburton, and Enron.&nbsp; Sometimes I wonder if
this will be last we will see of any major pop culture iconoclasts like
Thompson and BBC One icon John Peel, and if our generation (according
to BoBo Brooks) ""The Organization Kids"" have enough character to fill
their shoes.&nbsp; Those Krazy Kaplan Kids simply don't have enough
weird, courage, or fucking heart to care.<br>

"event","Yes, folks. It happened.&nbsp; THE Doc Williams from Hope College.&nbsp; THE infamous chemistry professor that can't rant and rave enough about Ohio State and Nuclear Power Plants.

When: March 17th
What: MSTA (MIchigan Science Teachers Association) Conference
Where: Grand Rapids, MI
How I felt: Somewhat mortified, yet very amused

Why:&nbsp; My co-workers and I are sitting down to much on some snacks.&nbsp; Dr. Williams, who I had a short conversation with just minutes prior, decides to introduce himself to my co-workers and proceeds to tell a story, which goes a bit like this:
""You know, your one of many previous students I've run into.&nbsp; I never know if it's going to be a good encounter or not.&nbsp; See, I used to teach this chemistry nursing class.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, anyway I had an appendectomy (I think that's what he said, I'm not sure) and I was supposed to get this shot.&nbsp; Well, a nurse comes up from behind me saying (something along the lines of)&nbsp;'Hello Dr. Williams; Do you remember me from your chemistry class?', with a needle about this big [showing me with his hands about a distance of a foot]."" Since then, he says he never knows what to expect.

Haha.&nbsp; Good 'ole Doc Williams.&nbsp; Thought some of you might get a laugh out of that.&nbsp; Although, it might be one of those things where you just had to be there."

"event","Yes, the cruise was fantastic.&nbsp; From Miami, Fl to Grand Cayman to Jamaica and back.&nbsp; Only 5 days, but such a wonderful chance to get some sun and relax.&nbsp;

Highlights:
*Climbing Dunes River Falls - you really climb this somewhat mild waterfall - fabulous and beautiful!
*Swimming with a Dolphin - She was absolutely amazing.&nbsp; An experience I'll never forget.
*Hanging out with Mark, his family, and MANY of his extended family (there were around 50!)
*Stuffing myself with so much wonderful ""FREE"" food on the trip.&nbsp; Warm Chocolate Melting Cake, need I say more?
*Learning how to walk on a moving boat (Then, relearning how to walk on land!&nbsp; Talk about some laughs!)
*Going to Miami beach- waiting&nbsp;till it was time to&nbsp;catch the plane&nbsp;- I had never been to Florida!

Overall, I was really glad that I had a chance to experience traveling like that.&nbsp; I don't know if I would cruise again, but I definitely recommend it at least once for everyone!"

"event","The apartment shakes.  I feel myself thrown out of a dream.  Voices start filtering into my consciousness.    They grow louder.  I glance at the clock and notice that it's about 3 A.M.  The apartment shakes again and I notice that it came from the apartment above us.  It sounded like something hard hit the floor. The chaos continues. Stomping. Screaming. Swearing.  Crying.  Sobbing. I realize Mark is awake and we debate as to what to do.  Our upstairs neighbors have fought before, but this was entirely different.  We cringe with each minute passing, hoping it will stop and they will leave each other alone.  Mark wonders if he should go up there and stop it.  I worry that the guy will come after him.  Quite a dilemma. We decide to call the apartment complex administration.  The guy at the front desk replies, ""I'm not getting in the middle of that.  Just call the police.""  We think about what will happen if we call the police... if the guy finds out it was us... but then we think about what happens if we don't call the police.  As we take another moment to figure out what to do, we hear loud knocks on the neighbors apartment.  It's the police.  Someone else must have called.  We find out that the guy and the girl are 18, he's a drunk, and he also gets busted for weed.  We also find out that it's the girl's apartment.  We then realize that she can't leave to get away from him, she's locked in by the lease.  Mark has thought about talking to her when we know he's gone, and offering her support.  I'm afraid to get in the middle of it.  It's not my business, but at the same time, my heart goes out to her.

I am excited about the wedding though, really.  I still don't know if I'm the maid of honor or not.  Hmmm.  Do I write a speech just in case?  Probably.  We'll see how it goes.  I've got a few cute stories to share.  I was ""innocent"" till she came along.  Oh the stories she told in the 6th grade lunchroom.  I clung to her every word.  Haha.  Needless to say, I learned a lot that year.  I still can't believe she's getting married though.  She wasn't looking for love, she stumbled across it, wait... feel tumbling and diving all the way down a cliff into it.  I'm so happy for her.  I just talked to her last night too, and she's not even a bit nervous (at least not yet).  She's going to look like a princess Saturday."

The gigantic event we had at the nature center this weekend was fabulous, and emphasized my job choice.  The staff asked me to be in charge of the Nature Nook and Children's Tent.  SWEET.  I created displays, fun crafts, and even a bird migration obstacle course.  We had over 2100 people attend the event, and I pulled it off without a hitch!  And somewhat calmly too!  I also have to share the story of the absolutely adorable baby turtles too.  Just today I helped a mom and daughter release baby painted turtles that had just hatched in the last three days.  What a touching moment.  The nature center where I work is such an amazing place.  I think I might actually stay put for awhile.

While at the fair, I certainly got my money's worth. I had never fully appreciated the ""Zipper"" ride until last night.  With my sister as my companion during this caged in fiasco, we spun this crazy ride ourselves in addition to the spins it gives you as the machine performs its magic.  The fourth time we rode the ""Zipper"" we thought we were done for.  Never had that little cage spun so fast or so much...we kept seeing the ground, sky, and lights from other rides in a rapid rotating fashion way too many times.  At first, we both freaked out.  I then realized, there was nothing I could do, so I decided to enjoy what I thought could have been the last remaining seconds of my life.  As soon as we stopped spinning so much, the whole ride stopped, and people were being let off a few cages at a time.  My sister and I wonder if there was really something wrong with the ride, and if so, how close were we to something happening?  Crazy.

I can't help but make this ride a comparison to life.  Often times life spins out of control.  Of course the initial reaction is to freak out, but really, if there's nothing I can do about it, then I just chill till the chaos is over.  To make best of the situation seems the essence of life and enjoying it. Yay for moral of the day."

I think I really like change, or at least doing new and interesting things.  This has led to a plethora of jobs working with students.  I have such a diverse background with kids now, that when I'm thrown into a situation with them, I tend to do okay.  For example, my week thus far has consisted of teaching these classes, many of them with only a short while to prep for: fire making with flint and steel, cord making with the dogbane, Lego Robotics, beavers (and all you ever wanted to know about them), and team building activities like PA and low ropes.  Yeah.  That's right.  I'm one mean, nature-hugging, lego-loving machine.

My relationship with my sister has changed too, and for the better.  We hang out like friends now, which is an amazing accomplishment for us.  In fact, I'm the only other person with a key to her apartment.  I think we finally understand each other now, which is crazy considering we are COMPLETELY different.  

I got a call from an friend in New York the other day.  I found out that because of our past relationship, he has started to see the world in a bit of a happier light.  I created change in him...  it's so amazing that it's hard to comprehend that I could help do such a thing.  It gives me hope.  Perhaps I really can make a difference in lives of not just kids, but all the people I meet.  

Change. What an amazingly simple yet awesome concept."

Sunday we're going to a huge tattoo exhibit.  I'm going to be moral support for Maria while she gets the phoenix she's always wanted.  I know what you're thinking, and no, I'm not getting a tattoo...but it doesn't hurt to look at the cool patterns."

I hadn't spent a significant amount of time there till today, so I really had a chance to get to know the staff members.   They talked about real environmental issues in the area (and are actually doing something about it!) and are very funny people.  I had the opportunity to help them skin and stuff birds for their collection, and I hopped on the band wagon to join them.  Not only was it great to socialize with some super nice people, but I also got to skin my first bird, an Eastern Screech Owl.  I love these little guys!  I've handled these types before (live) at other jobs, so I have quite a fondness for them.  Thankfully, I wasn't mortified doing the procedure, and I actually found it incredibly fascinating.  For my first bird, they said I did pretty well too!"

So, this whole afterschool programming is a go.  I just have to create the programs, meet with all the school officials, and get the programs out there.  It's not that it's hard, just time consuming and I work from home.  Thank goodness I'm somewhat self-disciplined to get my butt out of bed by 9am.  Great part is I can stay in my pjs till noon.  Bad part is I only get paid for actual class time. (Which means not much right now). 

The whole nature day job thing is for sure.  That interview went well!  I heard through the grapevine that I ""fit the bill perfectly"" for the assistant they wanted.  I get my schedule tomorrow hopefully.  I'm so nervous though. I don't know how much I'm going to get paid (I didn't really think of that, as it was the interview, and the whole hiring thing was tacked on in the last 5 minutes).  I also don't think I'm starting this job full fledged till April.  So again, no money. 

I was thinking about subbing, but if I apply for subbing and to teach afterschool programs, they might get mixed messages.  Such a dilemma.

So no money = I live at home for the next couple weeks because I can't afford an apartment.  I planned on 2-3 weeks, but it looks like it may be more.  So much for a social/dating life.

In the end, I know it'll work out.  Just take a deep breath.  There is logic at the end of the tunnel."

I will miss the lovely social gatherings, the massive bonfire in our front yard (complete with burning of the Christmas tree), the college like decorations including road signs and such, the costumes staff come up with, and the inappropriate dancing between co-workers.  For just friends, every one sure had a good time dancing and in general too.

I realized the past few days that Frost Valley has it's own family.  I've gotten to know so many staff members outside of the program staff that it's harder to leave than I thought it would be.  Heck, I teared up when I went to say good-bye to Steve our Electrician yesterday.  FV is like a big family and everyone comes to depend on each other.  I'll miss them very much, but I know it's time to move on.

Now for packing.  Oh, let's hope I can fit it all in my car.  I tried to ship a huge box of blankets and clothes, thinking it would save me space, but the cheapo parcel post has a size limit...my box was to big by 7 inches!!!  Grrr.  This is bad 1) because I don't have smaller boxes to ship it in and 2) By the time I got smaller boxes from someone, the post office would be closed and I'm leaving tomorrow. 

Tonight I think I'm going to go chill at a friends house, then leave super early in the morning.  I've got a 12+ hour drive ahead of me (through Canada, how fun!).  If you haven't called me in a while, and would like to, I'll have my cell on me.  I could use the company!

So when power goes out in the Catskill Mountains, does anyone come to fix it?  

On the same note, when a tree falls in the middle of a road in the Catskills, does anyone hear it and come take care of it?

The unfortunate answer is no, which leaves my house with generator power that only gives us lights in half the house.  No heat.  No warm water.  This also leaves me with a tree in the middle of the road that is impassable.  I spent 10 minutes Saturday morning pulling apart a tree just to make it to work.  My first instinct is to go out and buy a chainsaw to keep in the back of my trunk (and get lessons on how to use it).

Hmm, this year may be more challenging than I thought.  


Haunted House/Walk Update:

The haunted house on Saturday was a success.  After lots of hard work for the past few weeks, and lots of make-up and costumes the night of, our staff pulled off a spectacular haunted house/walk.  I was elected to be a dead receptionist for our haunted asylum.  After much consideration, it was determined that the phone cord was the source of my murder.  Lots of fake blood and interesting fake bruises made me look pretty wicked.  The only downfall of all this was the semi-permanent red color left on my face from where the fake blood was.  Oh well, it was fun explaining to guests what it was from.  



I feel like my life is now full of more 'events'.  There's just so much to process, and I work about 44 hours a week, plus I eat all my meals at our Dining Hall, and I use the PC on camp after hours, so I really don't feel like I have the much down time.  It's quite a change of life style.  While working at Anita Purves Nature Center and DeGraaf Nature Center, I felt like I had too much time to myself.  Now, it's not quite enough, but close.  Hopefully I'll find my balance soon."

All of the program instructors, plus a few friends and Frost Valley Alumni, participated in the beer scavenger hunt.  Typically, it's a compitition to be the first to the party at the group home.  Well, our team decided having fun along the way was more important.  We walked all over Frost Valley finding our beer stations, taking pictures after each station (or as one of our memembers called them, progress reports), and having a good ole time. 

Highlights:

*""Breaking"" into a friend's room and everyone climbing onto his bed for pictures
  
*Singing Disney and other tunes at the top of our lungs

*Crossing a cable bridge (a wire that is connected to two trees over water)

*Visiting the Associate Executive Director's house for more drinks 

*Having a team member go skinny dipping

*Having another team member steal the clothes of the team memeber that went skinny dipping :-)

*Watching the crazy staff members at the group home party play beer pong and wrestle each other


Note:  I did have a few drinks, but no worries; I skipped a few beer orienteering stations and sobered up at the party.  It was a good thing I did.  One of my housemates drank a bit too much and needed to go home early."

I found her this morning in the bottom of her flask.  She was probably the best fish I've ever had.  Meyer was actually interactive with me.  I knew when she was hungary (she'd make a bubbly sound at the top of the water).  She liked to chase my finger when I passed it along the outside of the flask.  When I walked into a room she 'danced' in her flask.  I'll miss her.  For all of you that had a chance to meet her, I'm sure you knew how much of a special fish she was to me.

For those of you that didn't meet my fish, you might be wondering about the name.  Well, once upon a time I inherited an Erlenmeyer flask.  The only thing logical to do with it, but two fish.  One was named Erl, the other Meyer, hence Erl and Meyer living in an Erlenmeyer flask.

Pirate party details (As requested by Leah):  We had the party at a group home off camp, so we could be crazy.  Lots of people had scandalous pirate costumes.  There were pirate jokes posted everywhere.  Dancing in the living room.  Some people watching a movie in the background.  Others in the kitchen playing drinking games and doing other stupid stuff.  Good times.  I had the infamous black pants and a black top (tied on the ends 80's style) over a white tank top.  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to put together an eye patch.  One of my housemates and I got a pic of us.  Once I get my film developed, and figure out how to share pics, I'll post it.

"event","Well, it could be worse.

Our phone use to work, but it was ridiculously fuzzy and you had to shout to the person on the other line.  Now, it doesn't work at all.  No dial tone, nothing.  GRRRR!  It wouldn't be that bad, except our cell phones don't work out here.  What if there's an emergency?  So frustrated.

In other news, the job is going well.  So far, I've only missed one Satuday morning meeting (thought it was in a different building) and missed set-up for breakfast once (Phone: ""Ring, ring"", Groggy Layne: ""Hello"", Phone: ""Layne, are you coming in for set-up this morning?"", Layne: ""What?  I'm on set-up?"".  Considering how much there is to remember, and how well my classes are going, I think I'm doing okay.  

The odd thing about this job is how much time I spend at work and how much I actually get paid for.  For example, yesturday I clocked in at 8:30 (that's mandatory).  All staff clocks out for lunch and dinner, 12-12:45 and 5.  I played ultimate frisbee with the gang after dinner in one of our fields.  Then I helped one of my friends Jenn, inventory for the haunted house we do.  Finally, at 8:30, I clock back in for Astronomy with the kids.  I didn't leave work till 10pm, but I only worked 9.25 hours yesturday.  Ah, life at Frost Valley."

I'm in the New York Catskill Mountains!  Woot Woot!  It's beautiful out here!

My cell phone no longer works, I have access to a pc maybe once a week; now I'm not so attached to technology so I focus on other more important things in life.  But, you can call me, it's through a landline.  845-985-2291.  This is the number for the WHOLE camp.  Ask the receptionist for me, or if you remember, extention 247.

I'm single, and staying that way till next year.  It's great!  I get to learn and grow around lots of incredible people and not worry about the relationship thing!

Yet, I miss you all!  Keep in touch somehow!  

Address at camp:
2000 Frost Valley Road
Claryville, NY 12725

Sorry this is short, 29 people + 3 pcs = not much time

Love you all!"

"event","My parents are in the dark.  Apparently a giant storm came through with 60 mph winds and knocked quite a few power lines down.  So, they've had to make do in the heat today and take showers at the relative's houses.  Today the high in Illinois was 100 degrees F, with a heat index of 115.  Matt and I didn't go to our normal church cause it didn't have AC, we went to a smaller church in Urbana with AC.  We stayed inside the rest of the day.   We think we are in control, but we're not.  Our lives still revolve around nature.  

Remember the spider Matt found it the apartment, and furthermore conquered?  I think I met it's scarier, larger brother in the kitchen yesterday.   Guess who won.  :-)  I know, I'm supposed to be into nature and living things...well...not on my turf.  It's one thing that they live in the apartment.  It's another that they show their creepy, gangly selves when I'm up.  That's right.  Their nocturnal.  I'm not.  We can share the apartment.  BUT DON'T CROSS THE LINE.

So, Matt and I aren't taking any trips together this summer cause of his adviser and research.  Sad day.  

I like to run, but not in the heat.  I came across this awesome workout when I was in Holland.  My housemate Lena owned some Jennifer Kries pilates workout dvds.  Their awesome, really.  My just bought my fav where she mixes ballet, yoga, pilates, and classic workouts for a fun, excellent workout.  Seriously, it's great.  (Leah, I think this is right up your alley!  When we get together in August I'll bring it with so you can have a look).

Matt is now addicted to his new Star Wars pc game.  It's got a wookie named Big Z, too.  At least I've got Harry Potter.  :-)

Tomorrow I'm a camp counselor again, and will be for two weeks.  This is weird going back and forth between camp counselor, substitute counselor, and seasonal naturalist.  I have to admit though, it is fun.  When I'm a camp counselor, I get to pass on a couple un-welcomed duties like special tours and animal care.  Three cheers for my co-worker still taking care of the black rat snake for me too.

The theme is Splish Splash these next two weeks at camp.  Tomorrow, is shark day!"

"event","Riddle for you.  Why does the nature center I work at have a black rat snake?  So it can BITE me and every one else who tries to take care of it.  I was the 'lucky' one though.  Not only did this giant snake bite my hand, but is also didn't let go, and it continued to wrap around my arm, AND it had to be pulled off by a co-worker.  Sheeesh.   I think it was more emotionally disturbing than physically damaging.  I'm alright now, just not willing to go near that snake, EVER.  At least one person at the nature center is willing to take care of him still, cause I'm NOT.  

In other news, I'm thinking about substitute teaching while I'm in New York.  At the YMCA, I get two days off every week.  Perhaps I can sub on those days at the local schools.  I think it would be good to get more experience in the classroom if I do ever decide to continue in the teaching profession, plus added income.  It might be a good idea to talk to the YMCA about it first, to make sure it's okay with them.

Today I was a substitute camp counselor.  We had a field trip to a local park.  Geez, it was HOT.  I thought for sure the kids were going to complain more.  They were surprisingly good.  Something to note though.  There are a few kids from out the of the country...OH MY GOSH they behave like angels.  Nicole, from Germany, was the sweetest girl.  She's so smart too, she won the scavenger hunt all by herself!  Natalia, from Spain?, also a sweetie (she wasn't in my group though, so I wasn't with her as much).  Are the majority of European kids nicer than U.S. kids?

About a month till New York.  It's creeping closer!"

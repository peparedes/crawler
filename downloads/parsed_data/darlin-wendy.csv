"event","i swear, one thing goes right, 10,000 things will always go wrong, i can't keep enough memory in my head to write all my thoughts that have been going on for the past few days, but they are harsh, loving, hurt, caring, dissipointed, ect.ect. no body said it was easy, but no one said itd be hard,. i guess that works for everything, life ,relationships, friends... i dont know, im too scatter brained to even think about what i was going to write,well okay, uhm,.. so thing have been going well, quit drugs and blad de blah, going back to school,in a few months but since im not going untill dec.- jan. i dont really have a damn thing to do anymore, i dont have the motovation to get a job, ( like anyone wants me) and, well today i really found out who ( or lack of ) my friend(s) are, today, well my life has been a complete failure. everthing that i had going 8 months ago, i never thought id be here, doing not a fucking thing, i have been fighting with people all night, about age, and lying, and that what a horrible person i am , and that i cant be trusted because someone found outmy age and started telling some people, ( which ill hunt down ans shoot) some one i really really liked is pretty much afraid to touch me now, ( but i guess its for the best) but my heart feels like its been steped on, spit on, thrown in to traffic, pissed on ect. so okay,well theres 2 reasons not to live, GREAT! oh yeah,my life is the BEST! you know whati should never get my hopes up, im just setting my self up for failure, i always have, i cant imagine having a child and how much their lifes would be shit, 
As well, i figured out that i can never have a relationship ever,... one, i always date someone out of my leauge or someone who just likes me and i dont really like them,    two, while datingthat person, 2+ people deide to tell me that they like me,.... three,i can never talk to someone when really need to say something important, or even a simple fight they think its all over and that 'were never gonna be friends because i hate them' yeah right, no one ever wants to work out their problems, EVER, they just want the quick way out, i just want someone who wants to stay in the long haul, even a fucking friend over a year would be nice! i dont even know if i can have that! i swear. oh yeah and my age! oh dear me dear me!
god forbid that you talk with someone a little older than you, ( okay, some people you know who you are, you have treated me great, even when you know my age, but this ones for the dumb shit shallow motherfuckers out there) jesus harmony christ!  i get soo much shit for my age its not even funny, so i usally lie about my age, and when they do find out there even more creeped out and/or  pissed off, i dont get it, why is age such a taboo? i know that the fuzz is cracking down on a lot of stuff, but shit, is it really gonna kill you for talking to me? pokay yes i dont look my age, i take advantage of it, okay, im smarter than most people my age, yes i take advantage of it, okay im a really great person to hang around, i listen, i talk i have a decent convo. and im not a dumb shit, YES I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT, i swear all i get these days are single serving friends, THIS IS WHY I END UP IN A MENTAL HOUSE, i cant fucking stnad myself,. its drives me crazy that people hate me so much, but i try so hard for that not to be the case, i just want everything to be okay, and who can i talk to this about,.. well lest see, right ow all i can talk to is a computer, way to go! i think things will go better this weekend,.. i hope, a gram and a game of croquet should make me feel a little better, well im hoping so,. its kinda late and ive got to get up before noon tomorrow, so i think if things get worse ill tell you all about it, hahaha yeah fucking right, i know  something gonna go wrong i fucking know it, and i cant fucking wait, because if it does i better be  locked up in the crazy bin or dead. i dont know what will happen,

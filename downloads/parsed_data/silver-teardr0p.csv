NO MORE SUMMERSCHOOL!!! yep, me and katie passed .. we're cool =] the fourth of july was soo funn, saw the fireworks 2 x's .. once with my family and the other with steve. went to a cookout at my aunts house and went swimming with my cousins bobby, gary, melissa, brianna, andrew and caitlyn. we played chicken lmao .. interesting .. i had brianna on my shoulders and gary had cait on his and they're like 4 and 6 so it was great. me and gary started fighting too (even though that's against the rules) and he's bigger than me so .. they won :( then we went on the trampoline .. oh god big mistake. gary kept flipping and knocking everybody over and he wanted me to flip but i wouldn't cuz i was scared .. buuuuut i ended up doing it :D gone to see a lot of movies in the past couple weeks with steve. '50 first dates', 'van helsing' <--ew bad movie .. leads to bad things ;x right steve? haha .. umm 'breakin all the rules' and finally ... 'THE NOTEBOOK!' omg it was suuuuch a cute movie :) :) :) now i'm at shannon's but my dad's coming to get me in a few mins but i had to come see her because she's going to new hampshire for a week and idk what i'm gonna do :( lol but we'll chill lots when she comes back :D umm not much else has happened.

"event","<P>soooo definately in need of an update..no time right now though. all i shall say is summerschool blows but at least i have katie in my class so it's not quite as bad as it could be. going to see spiderman 2 with steve and my brother tonight :D it should be grand. i have a massive sunburn on the back of my neck (ouch indeed) i hate my new job. sweeping streets + picking up trash for 6 hours a day is definately not my ideal summer but hey it's $7 and hour 30 hours a week so at least the money is good. made some new friends..yes ones that actually live in central falls--rich, rj, kayla, alyssa and normand...all pretty cool. rich + kayla are gonna be seniors, rj's gonna be a sophmore and alyssa + normand are gonna be juniors. haven't hung out with too many people--definately needs to change but there's no time right now cuz i work 8-2:30 then have summerschool 6-8:30 but that will end july 16th. my patsy is on her way to california right now as i type :( extremely sad. that's all for now.</P>

"event","well here i am, first period ... keyboarding - oh the fun. i finished my powerpoint so i have nothing to do so here i am updating the journal (woo hoo) ummm what happened yesterday? not much at all, i came home from school and hung around..steve called me before he went to work then i fell asleep...for 2 hours! lol i guess i needed it though, i woke up when steve called on his break =) hung around with the family--me and mom fought again..we fight over every little stupid thing lately and i don't know why, we've always had a pretty good relationship but oh well..i guess it's normal? i decided to call miss shannon around 9 because i hadn't talked to her since i left school and we talked for a lil then steve called again =) so i hung up with her to talk to him and then called her back. helped mom make invitations on the computer for my brother's graduation party then i went online for a lil and went to bed. fell asleep around 12:30 and then woke up at 2 because there was a ThUnDeRsToRm!!!!! omg i hate them so much and a loud bang woke me up so i ran into my mom's room and jumped in her bed (lmao yes, i'm 15 years old and i ran into my mommy's room) it was me, my mom, the dog and my dad in one bed until like 3:30 when i went back in my room. me and mom talked a lot about different things so it was probably a good thing. fell back to sleep around 4 and got up at 6 cuz we had to leave the house at 7 cuz my bro had to be to school for 7:15 cuz his class was going on a trip so i got to school at 7:30 and hung out with all the cool people as always, cait gave me some of her strawberry coolata and now all i can taste is strawberries lol. now i'm so0o exhausted but i'll get over it. i have lunch with shannon today :D haha there's only like 2 days this happens so it's a big deal :) religion long block next....oooh the fun. i'll update later if anything happens."

"event","<P>^ ""i could not ask for more"" -- i think that quote fits my life so well lately (don't get me wrong i love the song too but..just that one part fits me right now) i always write in this thing when i'm mad or upset about something, but never when i'm happy..so here's something new. i have the best friends anybody could ever ask for, seriously..all of you are great and i don't know what i would do without you. shannon, you're the best my friend--always there no matter what.....even if it's at 2am lol. bribri, you+me=inseperable, you're my sister by heart and i love ya like a fat kid loves cake =). laura, you're the sweetest person i know and we have some great talks. chris r, we got wicked close recently and i'm happy because you make me laugh so much...another one whose always there..manny, *son loves ralph* lol you're the coolest person i know. there's so many more of you that i didn't mention but those are the few who i feel closest to..thanks for putting up with me guys :). i've also realized how lucky i am to have steve (yep, i know it's only been like 3 days but shhh and listen errr read? lol) steve i only met you .... a month and a half ago ... maybe? but something between us just clicked and i'm so glad because i don't know what i would ever do without you. we were bestfriends within a couple of weeks&nbsp;and now you're my&nbsp;boyfriend which makes things even better but it's really weird that we started talking that day at the pepsi machine (lol) because i'm usually shy and don't talk to new people, nevermind get close to them quick so it was something rare with you. even though i make fun of you sometimes....well okay....a lot of the time--it's only out of love. you mean so much to me :) &lt;3 you </P>
<P><lj-cut text=""my day""> </P>
<P>school today was extra boring (as always)..well it wasn't that bad, i'm just getting sick of it because it's soo friggen close to the end of the year but summer seems so far because we're locked in classrooms 6 hours a day =\ okay i'm done complaining. hung out with the *morning crew* this morning before homeroom as always then had religion 1st..did absolutely NO work, i mean usually me and bri slack in that class but today all we wrote on the papers were our names! lmao idk it was just too early and we spent the whole period talking about boys and how silly/weird/stupid they are =)bio long block omg we made these DNA models (well that's what they're supposed to be but mine looks like a truck ran over it or something) lol i just couldn't do it and i kept stabbing myself with the pipe cleaners =( not fun. spanish went by quick..because mrs. van WASN'T THERE :D :D :D :D so we just had a free in the caf. so i sat with michelle, chris r, kayla, rich and katelyn..fun times you guys. english next..that's an easy class--lunch--walked to west to find john for bribri and katie and john ended up leaving art to talk to us so that was cool. algebra..well let me put it this way, i didn't take any notes today, i know that sounds really bad but i just don't get it..even when i take notes and pay attention i'm like retarded in math. so i goofed off and the product of my math class was a note between me and dave (it was a funny note though so =) lol) western civ. last..we had a quiz but i know i did good so that's cool. saw steve afterschool ;] and then hung with shannon, zac, jen, kayla, cait and jt...the funniest thing happened...you guys know how much i love it when a guy smells good (and if you didn't..you do now) but jt alwayssss smells soo good...so he comes over and hugs me and i was like aww you no smell good :( so he took his cologne out and sprayed it right there just for me haha. so i'm standing there hugging him as MR GIRARD walks by lmaooooo he sees me with a different guy every 3 days i can't even imagine what he thinks. but then....it gets funnier---half the tennis team drives by and manny's in the backseat of one of the cars shaking his finger at me and yelling ""SON YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND!! BAD GIRL!!"" lol aww manny. mom came to get me and i came home and had some soup :) yup that's my day </P>"

"event","so i've been slacking on updating this thing lately, i guess i'm just too lazy lol. friday night i went to see shrek 2 with steve & kayla w but we ended up meeting chris, patsy, nichole, katie c and jay there, we had to sit in the front row so we could all sit together because the theater was sooo full. the movie was so cute. saturday i worked from 10-3, came home and hung around for a lil then started getting ready for the mardi gras dance. steve got to my house at 6:45ish and he gave me pretty flowers =) he looked spiffy lol. we got to the dance a little after 7 and met up with shannon, kayla, zac, nichole, chris, jay, katie and a bunch of others. the dance kinda sucked at the beginning because everyone was just standing there talking because we didn't know what else to do. spent most of the night hanging around with chris & patsy and jay & jenn and of course the loverly shannon. took some pictures (prof. + ones on my camera) didn't dance much...mostly just the slow songs. left at 10:30 to go to gregg's, we fit 6 yes 6 people in steve's little car. patsy, me, shannon and katie all squished in the back seat and chris and steve up front. jay, jenn, caserra, her date matt? and jaime came in a lil after us. (and i had sex last night! omg<--rich) lol yeah i'm on free, at the library with nicole and rich. left gregg's around 11:45 and brought shannon home...then i went home, went online for a lil and went to bed. the dance wasn't the best it could have been but it was still fun..i love my friends.woke up around 10:30 on sunday and went to work from 12-4..then to church at 5 with mom and gram then just hung around the house the rest of the night. steve asked me out =) even though most of the school already knows lol. talked to shannon on the phone and went to bed. well i'm sick of typing and i need to go find kasey because she was supposed to be in here...but she's not and she has a story for me. i'll write later if anything happens.

today was pretty boring .. mom woke me and shannon up at 9 so i could get ready for work. shannon's mom picked her up, i went to work. left to go to my cuzin's 1st communion at 12 and then went back to work til like 5. came home and just hung around. i gotta go to the tailor tomorrow afterschool to get my dress hemmed =/ cuz it drags like a mile behind cuz im so damn short lol other than that its gonna be pretty boring.

i think i sprained my ankle or something..when i hung shower curtains yesterday i lost my footing and fell (luckily my cousin was there to catch me) but my ankle wacked the tub and now it hurts like a bitch .. i limp when i walk and it keeps cracking .. not good.

"event","today was a pretty good day, woke up at 9:30 and started to get ready for work .. didnt go to work til 11 so me n my mom were really late but it was her fault (good thing we were for my grama cuz we'd be fired if we worked for anyone else) i had to work with my 2 cousins (dave + bobby) all day hanging shower curtains on the floor that got re-done .. funny times .. i hada stand on the toilets cuz i was too short to reach so they were making fun of me. got outta work around 4:30 and came home to get ready to go to my cousin's graduation party (she graduated from college) so we headed to spumoni's .. my WHOLE family was there and her fiances family was there so there was tons of people. this kid patrick that i was BESTfriends with from like 1st-6th grade is my cousin's fiances cousin so that was cool to see him. (he changed a lot..he used to be..well..ugly lol) so we talked a lil, he's so funny. my uncle kept making comments to my mom like 'oh pat you should go talk to patrick's mom you never know what could happen with the two of them' hung with my cousin gary for a while and his girlfriend erika--he told me when i graduate i have to go to RIC no matter what cuz he'll be a senior n i'll be a lil frosh and he didn't get to bother me in highschool cuz i went to saints (oops? lol) i told him maybe. maybe not. called shannon n talked to her for a few..patrick left =[ n then we went to pick shannon up so she could sleepover and here i am .. watching mtv and hanging with shannon. tomorrow i have to work and go to my cousin jessica's first communion so it's gonna be a busy day.

"event","this entry is dedicated to kelli bradley + kelly feeney..these 2 girls were my BESTfriends and now we barely talk anymore, and i don't know what happened-but i've been thinking about all the good times/memories and this is what i got.


--kelli bradley--
my summer buddy. summer 2003 was definately one to remember..the trip to block island with my mom, dad, brother, grama, aunt, uncle and 2 cousins was definately insane. i miss how we used to live right across the street from eachother. i miss the walks around central falls and walking to the scoop to split a bananna split and visit jaime and i miss walking to the skatepark to check out the skaters. i miss hanging out at your house with brittany and just being retarded, our movie nights where we would just lounge around, talk and eat. i miss you making those really nasty smoothies that i pretended to like because i didn't want to hurt your feelings but you ended up not liking it too and just acted like you did cuz you thought i did. i miss you coming over and helping my babysit my cousin. most of all..i miss you being my bestfriend. i don't know what happened kel, we went back to school and just stopped talking-we don't have any classes together and barely see eachother around. we always say we need to get together but it never happens because i work on the weekends. i just want you to know that i miss you and we need to hang out real soon. <3

--kelly feeney--
omg. you..i can't even describe how much i miss hanging out with you. we were BESTfriends since that icecream social thing the beg. of frosh year and we did EVERYTHING together. i miss our trips to cape cod. remember the 1st one? those boyscouts at that thing we went to and my ""lover"" mark..how i made you talk to him cuz i was too chicken and how i made him bang his head when i walked by and those creepy puppets..and getting splashed in the boat and walking thru the disgusting muck. and then the 2nd trip..watching movies all night and just talking..and all the sleepovers when we'd just go online and hang out. the good charlotte concert...that was insane. i miss you practically living at my house and being a part of my family. i miss your mom blasting music at like 9 in the morning and waking us up. i miss eating ""ho ho's and oodles and noodles"" or whatever the hell it was for breakfast that morning. i miss being in the same house..but different rooms just so we could BOTH use computers. kelly...i don't know what happened, we didn't fight about anything, we just drifted and we talked on the phone that night last week for like an hour and a half and everything was cool but i miss you-you were my bestfriend..my ""sister by heart"" and i need you back because i'm going crazy without you..nobody can take your place. <3*

...now that i got that out...idk today was kinda boring. a lot of my family came over since my aunt and uncle were up from virginia so i spent most of the night hanging with my cousins donnie and gary and their girlfriends ... and andrew, briana and caitlyn who are all under the age of 8 lol so it was a silly night. work today was .. interesting .. worked with my cousins dave and bobby all day *shakes head* i pray my grama never does that to me again because all i heard all day was how short i am and how short people have no purpose in life so i was very insulted...but i kicked them and they shut up :) i don't feel like typing anymore.

"event","i'm bored. so i figured i'd write again. my aunt and uncle came over, went downstairs and my aunt started like crying because she hadn't seen me in such a long time..weird but i think the last time she saw me was when we went down to virginia for jamie's funeral a year and a half ago. she pulled me out of the room and wanted to know allll about what was going on at school: with friends, grades..everything so i told her some but left most out because i didn't feel like getting into it. then..then she made me laugh because she said ""so how's jeff doing?"" because the last thing she knew was that i looooooved a kid named jeff..wow she missed a lot - my grama started telling her that i had had a boyfriend and all that crap but i changed the subject quickly lol. i love my aunt so much, she's so cool-we're so close...she never had a daughter so i'm the closest thing to it for her and she's like a mom to me so i tell her things i don't tell other people and i know i don't have to worry about it because she'll never tell a soul, so we talked about some other things that i won't mention and this is what she got out of it. i have no self esteem or self confidence ... and that's bad because in her words ""you're a pretty, funny, kind and caring young lady and you should feel better about yourself"" don't get me wrong i don't want self pity from that, i don't know i just don't like myself lately and i don't know why. i've also figured out that i'm a chicken, i don't tell people how i feel about them - whether it's good or bad and i need to change that. so as you can see i have quite a few things to work on changing.

..oh yeah, in the midst of talking all about myself-i forgot to mention one thing ..
HAPPY BIRTHDAY RICH!!!

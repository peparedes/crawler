I'll Start by saying that I've overcome my addiction with Loratab. I've was on them for almost 2 year's. A Very Expensive habit. I craved them everyday. I was buying about at least 10 to 15 a day. I would lie to my family and friend's to get money to buy them. I made sure my addition was taken care of before my bills were even paid. I didn't care who I hurt to get what I wanted. I would lie to my Boss/Aunt to get a pay out to just get them. My mom has tried helping me get off them and I just wasn't hearing any of it. I felt I had to have it to function. But It's been 3 day's now, and I can't say that I'm not craving one cause I am. But I don't want to waste my money on them. Cause one day there's going to be a time when you have to do without and you will go through the with drawls and you won't like it believe me. I've been through it twice now and I don't want to go back. You Loose Friend's over it. It's not worth it. So if your on them take my advise It will Destroy your life if you let it......CrYsTaL</b></i></font></font>"

"event","Well after a long ass hiatus from livejournal I have made my return...I have been very busy as of late and as of this past Sunday I am about to start training to become a valet/manager....Im really excited....Julie (sister) and I are about to start doing some local gigs for VCW and possibly CCW before going down south to alabama and tennesee sp?  Anyways since the last time Ive wrote in my journal I have met a great looking and up and coming wrestler by the name of Scott Sullivan....He is very talented and has improved 110 percent since the first time I saw him work in Madisonville for KWA....I have developed a crush on him and at times he feels the same but he did date Julie and I am sure that has a lot to do with why we arent together...Right now we have a non blood related sister/brother relationship and I know I can depend on him for anything...I really hope that he makes it because for a 21 year old he has a great look and build and charisma...Reminds me alot of a mix between Chase Stevens, Chris Michaels and Alex Shelley....Not bad company huh?  Anyways I have had some problems lately but I am turning my life around.  Went to VCW last in Bowling Green Kentucky and they had a decent show and of course my favorite wrestler Scott Sullivan wrestled like 3 times :) Im really looking foward to breaking into the wrestling business once again and this time I am going to stay with it and see where it leads me...For the record those who doubted me FUCK you and for those who stuck behind me thank you....I am going to be something hell I already am and if you dont believe me or dont really care then fuck off who needs ya anyways....Later

"event","Hey Everyone!!!!! It's been a little bit since I've updated this thing.So that's why I'm here...To tell everyone what's been going on with me.
Let's start off with Wrestling! I've been at Vcw for a couple of months now.I've managed to valet for the *Wild Eyed Southern Boy* Tracy Smothers! He's a great guy. I've been managing the One And Only Billy Ray Hickerson.The Shows up there have been great.I've met so many new people.These Are The People...The NaturaLs Chris Micheals John Ceaser Eddie Browning Big E.Last Sunday Night was our last night at the old Bowling Green Building.Were moving up to another building with a better location and also a better building.I'm hoping to get trained to the fullest sometime soon.I was on a show In Provedence Kentucky for CWA.They are no longer running up here in Madisonville Kentucky for the fact being not a good enough Crowd.I've been to a couple of NAWE shows.I've really liked them too.Terry BuLL is really awesome.He come back from retirement.I hope his Knee holds up for him.I hope to take this wrestling career to the fullest.I bet I can if I'm with the right people.I'm supose to get on at a couple of fair shows this summer...
Alright enough about wrestling.MY birthday is next Wednesday!! I'll be 20 years old...Damn Am I getting old or What (LoL) My sister seems to be doing good.She got her a New car a couple of weeks ago...HeLL it might even be a month since she got it..But guess what I got her old car...WeLL I guess you could say when she had it...It was really both of ours..I had to give her 800 dollars for it...So far i've gave her 300..I still ole her 500 which sucks..Julianna is doing good...Ray seems to be coming around more often.But really he can't come around as much as julie wants him to cause the fact being he works way to much on the railroad. RAY IF YOU READ THIS I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING BAD ABOUT YOU!!!!!
My brother has been in jail since May 3...But he seems to be taking it alright.They moved him to the Mulenburg Detention Center.It Seems to be a whole lot better than the one he use to be at..I went and seen him last Saturday..He's doing good.
I get my car outta the shop hopefully tomorrow.I can't wait either!!!!
But I guess thats all for now....Much Love People

WeLL first thing is first..I made my DREAM come a REALITY....I'm a valet for VCW wrestling And CWA wrestling...I never thought in a million years that I would be doing what this..I always wanted to be a babyface in the wrestling business,but I found out being a heel ain't such a bad thing after all.I've only been in it for a month now...I've met some really great people..So far some of the wrestlers I've managed to meet was KOKO Beware JW Wildfire DeathWish...I'm meeting Tracy Smothers this weekend.I hope to take this as far as it can go...As of right now I'm managing Billy Ray Hickerson...My ring name is Queen CrYsTaL...But enough on that!
I haven't really being doing to much...Just hanging out with my friends riding around and going to watch some of my other friends bowl.My friend Tiffany and I have been hanging out alot here lately..I never thought that I would really have any close friends but I really consider her a close friend...
On to the next thing...My friend Jason finally go outta jail...This is so weird to..I mean I knew the boy was going to jail but I didn't go say bye to him before he left,he was gone for like 13 months...The other day My sister and I got a phone call from him asking if he could come visit us...Of course we said yes...We all just talked and everything....I'm Just glad to see him out ya know....The bad part about it is,someone gets out and someone goes back in...Ask of today my brother has 1 month and 2 days left before he goes and serves 7 years...I'm hopin they move him somewhere different because I don't want him staying here by no means...He spent 3 years in the jail up here and all the guards gave him hell...So I'm really hoping they ship him off somewhere,but not to far because I still wanna be able to go see him....
MY sister and her baby is doing great...Rays sisters baby died...I feel really bad cause I didn't go to the funeral..I know how much she wanted to have this baby...I just feel really bad for her I really do...
WeLL People I guess thats really all for now until next time!!!!!!!

"event","Hey Everyone! (LoL) Like anyone ever reads this thing anyways.
I haven't been doing a whole lot lately.
I've been going to alot of wrestling,should I say Janice and I have been.I now go to VCW in Bowling Green Kentucky,It seems to be very good and entertaining.Execpt for the fact that half the time I see them talking why trying to wrestle.LoL since I've been going there I've been called a ""BITCH"", by the one and only TRACY SMOTHERS.Which doesn't really bother me much.He plays a great HEEL in the wrestling business.I would rather see him playing the babyface.While I was there the one and only Billy Ray Hickerson ask me if I wanted to try out managing wrestlers! So I took the offer as it came and said HELL YEA! I filled out the application and sent it off.So I should be getting it back really soon! Oh I also have to tell you about me finally meeting KOKO BEWARE!!!!It was a great pleasure to finally meet someone like him! I even danced with him when he made his way to the ring...Seems like a really sweet person indeed...So I have to say its a great wrestling indeed....
On to CWA!!!!!! I went to Cadiz Kentucky to watch it last Saturday! It also was a great show indeed...All expect it seems like every show I go to people always has to stare at me for some reason...(LoL) am I that ugly HAHA! I talked with the promoter afterwards..We talked about me managing wrestlers..I think that it's going to be really fun! It's always been my dream and I hope to live and meet bigger and better people! Their show is coming to Madisonville this Friday so I have a fun weekend of wrestling!
Friday Night~CWA
Saturday Night~ The new NAWE
Sunday Night~VCW
Alright on to something else I wanna write about...Why is it gurls always like to start shit with me? I mean alright this one girl name JESSE...She's messed up in the head really bad..She try to tell me this and that guy likes me! I think it's really all a set up if you ask me. She's dating J.D Thunder.HAHA He told Billy Ray that if he got me in the wrestling business I could manage him.BUDDY THINK AGAIN..I try to refrain from all the drama that happens around wrestling.Jesse would really be one pissed bitch if she was to find out he said that.But who cares she can call 1-800-Get A Life and stop revolving hers around mine!
So I bet ya'll are wondering how my favorite neice Julianna Is? WeLL she's great she 5 and a half months old now! Her Mom,My sister is doing great! Tonight she went and stayed allnight with her boyfriend or her babysdaddy in Henderson Kentucky!
My brother goes to jail May,3..But other than all that he's doin wonderful..His girlfriend Laura Is doin good too..Everyones going to the Prom except for me (LoL) but who cares.
April 2 I Plan to go to KentuckyKingdom! My Dad and his girlfriend My brother and his girlfriend and me and someone (LoL) I haven't figured that one out yet!
WeLL I guess thats all for now people. I'm going to try to start updating this everyday!! But I'm out for now ByE

My mom is a very sick women and suffers from a panic disorder,And can't be left alone by herself at anytime.So I guess you can say that it's very hard living at my house.My sister and I does nothing together anymore.Cause me or her always stays with my mom.My stepdad is in bad shape.After he had his surgrey he hasn't been the same since,like hes a whole different person.Also with my brother going to jail for 10 years Febuary 17 makes everything even worse on me.I'm to the point where I just don't know what to do. Life is hard.I try and try to be happy but it's so hard when you got alot of things on your mind.I have nobody to talk to.So I just let my feelings go on my Livejournal.
Alright enough about that.I've been going to wrestling and it's great! 2004 is doing so good.
Ya know I question myself everyday *How can you like someone you don't even know* Me and this guy named Trevor has been talking since December 15,2003 and things have been going good..I feel as if this guy is Mr. Right. I mean just the way he acts and everything. But he says, ""You Should'nt Doubt Me So Much"". I don't know this dude enough not to doubt him. Ya'll think I'm right don't you? While we was talking he was in an accident. His friend told me that he was on his way home coming to see me and was in a car accident? I Have no reason but to beleive him I guess. I Just don't know about the situation...
My brother and his girlfriend was in a car accident about a week ago. They wasn't hurt. But it was just scary,cause I was right behind them and slammed on my breaks from hittin her back end..
WeLL I guess thats it for now. I don't have anything else to talk about

All day staring at the ceiling
Making friends with shadows on my wall
All night hearing voices telling me
That I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for something

Hold on
Feeling like I'm headed for a breakdown
And I don't know why

[Chorus]

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be...me

I'm talking to myself in public
Dodging glances on the train
And I know, I know they've all been talking about me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be something wrong with me
Out of all the hours thinking
Somehow I've lost my mind

[Chorus]"

<h2>Your Sex Sign is <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/sagittarius.html"">Sagittarius</a>!</h2>
""Fuck and run"" is your motto.<br>
You're into almost anything, as long as it doesn't involve violence.<br>
Sex with a new person is what gets you off most - so much so that you have a new lover every week!<br>
<br>
Sagittarius, you are completely irresistible.<br>
And you fling yourself into >one thrilling affair after another.<br> 
You need constant sexual diversion.<br>
<br>
You are comfortable with a one-night stand.<br> 
You'll walk out a lover's door without a second thought, and you can't be pinned down by anyone.<br> 
You are sexually high strung, and you are likely to seek sexual gratification before establishing emotional intimacy.<br>
<br>
Sex is a game for you.<br>
Unsurprisingly, you are drawn to athletic types - you like your lovers to sweat.<br>
Sex for you is an animal experience.<br> 
You like anything and everything - oral sex, anal sex, threesomes, mutual masturbation.<br> 
Though you love energetic sex, you don't like it rough.<br>
<br>
Far from being jealous of lover's old flames, you get aroused just hearing about them.<br> 
You press for all the juicy details.<br>
You either marry often or never, but you rarely settle down.

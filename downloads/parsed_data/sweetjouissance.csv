"event",":( schoolies is over. BUt :) schoolies was awesomely fun and crazy.
so many memories and unexpected occurrances but ill let rach recall them since she has the list.
It was complteley different to what i expected but so incredably amazing.
'Its times like these we learn to love again'
I think some of the best times i had on schoolies was sitting around slowly getting drunk and chilling with the girls discussing the previous nights events paying people out and pondering what that night would bring. that and breaking and enetering some guys apartment on our floor to watch their porn while they weren't there lol actually there are too many best times so ui wont keep on going...
as rach mentoined our hotel was amazingly good soo convienient dispite the not so good facilities which didnt matter in the end on account of our friendship with the 5star marists lol
i think this trip really showed me alot about the poeple that surround me (myself included) both the good and the bad (mainly good) so in that sense i feel like it was a learning experience. 
but now i am so very very tired and must get some shut eye so i dont do a wrong and can wake up ready to get toey lol (too much whittemore influence)
cheers"

"event","Its a weird feeling at the moment
its like i have so much to do but nothing at the same time. 
I cant believe it i went to school today to hand in the two ancient essays i wrote and stupid garrad's still in bloody istanbul! anyhew handed it in to Mr Wood (such a nice man) and felt guilty for having a break. only three weeks guys!!! omg my heart skips when i think about it. I miss people soo much  and i think maybe i should tell them so they dont think im ignoring them cause i dont care about them. I cant wait to be able to spend lots of time with lots of people i never spend time with atm i just hope i still have friends who want to spend time with me lol
i just want to lie in and lie in the sun and lie on the beach and lie in a beautiful grassy field somewhere and lie lots everywhere...
and sleep i want to sleep whenever and wherever i want. and shop lots and lots and not feel guilty about wasting time walking round shops when i could be studying...
and having time to get fit. i kno thats a poor excuse for why im not but heres hoping it is the reason. 
anyways enough of the 'i wants' just 3 more weeks!!! and they'll be a reality"

"event","A wasted youth is such a terrible thing
so why do i see mine flying by?
Whats the point of all this when im probably gonna end up being lonely and miserable anyway
i cant believe i've spent the last two weeks without leaving my house (barr wimbledon) except to vote today...
Hell what am i even going to do? 
and then ive got the three months of 'holiday', i need to get a job, fast and then my best friends moving to another state for 4 years and then who knows...
Labour didnt even get in so now im gonna be paying off HECS for the rest of my life.
Why?
One consulation- Big article on The Darkness in the Good Weekend with lots of pics...im starting to think being a rock star might be my calling, at least then if life's shit at least you can pass out in some anonymous hotel room.."

"event","wow i have quite possibily done the least (schoolwork that is) this weekend than ever before (in the last couple of months anyway lol). it feels great but guilty. 
I really wanna go to janas tonight!! but i feel like shit and look even worse so its probably a good thing...i doubt id make it alive anyway, probably fall asleep at the wheel lol. Ill just satisfy myself with a 'sex on the beach' and watching the sunday night movie.
Gee Whiz i hate scholarship applications!!! you have to write all that pompous stuff about yourself and your competeing against ppl who write even more pompous stuff!!!
This weekend has been pretty good...dancing with the girls on fri night hehe oh except agony aunt bron lol i think ive done more exercise wat between that, walking up and down the length of broadway in heels and walking home barefoot than ive squeezed in the last couple of months.
SEE!!! its not my faulkt i havent been excersing, its inversely proportional to the amt of schoolwork i do!!
Oh BTW, thanx rach for the cakes despite the fact ill not get to eat them and for putting me onto this blog thing, your a champ and the only friend ive got registered on this journal so far so the only one i have to suck up to lol
luv ya darls"

"event","Fufufu I adore days like&nbsp;today so much&nbsp;:D.&nbsp;A very dear friend of mine took me&nbsp;to this delightful little cafe... the food&nbsp;is delicious and I adored the relaxed atmosphere, really there&acute;s no one rushing you at all, but the best part is that is <em>FULL</em> of books, and you can&nbsp;exchange your own books for any of the&nbsp;one's that they&nbsp;have...&nbsp;I was in heaven :&quot;D&nbsp;

<lj-cut text=""a little book rant..."">

Hahahaha, thankfully I went prepared and&nbsp;got me a few new books YAY!!! \o\\o//o/ 


1. <em>Stephen King,</em> <em>The Eyes of the Dragon:</em> lucky!!! I love Stephen King and this one is a classic =w= 

2. <em>Tana French, In the Woods</em>: It's suppose to be psychological suspense,&nbsp;at least it sounded interesting&nbsp;:) 

3. <em>Lucia St. Clair Robson,</em> <em>The Tokaido Road</em>: hehehe It was about feudal Japan, I could<em> not &nbsp;</em>take it with me /o/ 

4. <em>Mindy L. Klasky, The Glasswight's Apprentice</em>: Sounded like a nice fantasy... let's see XD 

5.<em>The QPB Companion to The Lord of the Rings</em>:&nbsp;Lol I had to, it called meeee XDDD 


I had to leave behind <em>The Kite Runner</em> by Khaled Hosseini <strike>SOB ;A;</strike> , but I figured that I could buy this one anywhere, the others... errr, not so much XP 

But well, If I don't like them I can always exchange them back mwahahaha&nbsp;&nbsp;BD"

She's supposed to be Lynn, a character from a story I made sooo long ago :D 
<strike>Lol though she's kinda shy, so I'm not that sure that she would pose like that normaly XD</strike> 

</lj-cut>

On another note, I already finished all the available chapters for Glass Mask... I want to cry ;A;, I'm so desperate that I razed trough all the available summaries, watched the 2005 series and even started watching the old series in italian for God's sake!!!!...<strike> though their voices are pretty nice :'D... It's a dub made with love ^^</strike>. But the manga is much better, hands down... right now I'm debating if I should order the japanese manga <strike>because I'm a purist and I really need to practice my rusty non-existant japanese skills</strike> or if I should order the italian version ^^; <strike>because it would be easier to translate</strike>... 
Just... I have no words... there were just to many things to count that I absolutely adored... :'D 

<lj-cut text=""AJSDKAJ!!! REASONS WHY I LOVE YOU GLASS MASK!!!!"">

REASONS WHY I LOVE YOU GLASS MASK!!! 

1- The whole Hellen Keller play and <strike>insane</strike> training XD 

2- Maya's Satoko is love :D... at this point I also adored her relationship with Shigeru, it was so so sweet <strike> Even if I'm a Masumi x Maya shipper to the core XD </strike>

3- Uuuuuu T_T Maya's mother death... it made me cry and cry... it was all so sad... also Masumi-san, I root for you and I love you, but this one was totally a bed of your own making :'( 

4- ARGGGG!!!! I hate Norie <strike>DIEDIEDIE</strike> but Ayumi's GLORIOUS REVENGE on Maya's behalf made all of it worth it *0*. My love for Ayumi knows no bounds <strike>for all her family actually ^^ </strike>

5- Midsummer night's dream :DDDD 

6- The two sisters play!!!! OMG from the auditions to the play itself, all of it was wonderful. To see Maya and Ayumi getting closer and acting like friends was the best ^^ <strike>by the way... poor puppy XD</strike>; 

7- Forgotten wilderness and Masumi san battling a typhoon to get to the play 

8- To finally see the crimsom goddess play !!!!! 

9- MAYA AND MASUMI SAN'S STAR CROSSED LOVE STORY &hearts;!!!!!! 

10- <span style=""font-size: large"">ALL OF IT!!!!!</span>. Arrrg now I'm craving GM fanfics but I can't find new ones ANYWHERE /sob. 

Also I heard somewhere that the author said she would write a happy ending, I don't know if it's true but I hope so from the bottom of my heart ;A; 

Here a sweet little video I found for those two... I don't think there is in the world a more appropriate song to describe their relationship &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;

<center> <cite>
A Zurich court has granted bail to Oscar-winning film director Roman Polanski while he fights extradition to the United States over a 1970s staturory rape case, but he will remain behind bars pending an appeal.</cite></center> 


Thank you Switzerland... just when I was starting to believe that justice would be granted you go and remind me that &quot;justice&quot;  is a joke applicable only to those without money and connections, no matter how serious the crime... thank you for killing my faith in humanity a little bit more...

I... I have no words... I'm just so mad and disappointed... here's a man who drugged and <big>raped</big> a 13 years old young girl (and she was not only victimized by him, but again and again by the media and the fans of the man who treated her like a seducer... as if this was her fault)... who that when realized  would have gone to jail ran like a coward to a country he knew he couldn't be extradited to the United Stated and evaded the courts for 30 years...  

<big><b>Any other mortal would be rotting in jail...  a bail of any kind should be out of the question.</big></b>

It doesn't matter if he's now an old man or even that the victim forgave him (that's part of her personal healing process... and the fact that every time the case is on the news again she get's accosed by the media... really people, she want's it to stop), a crime is a crime and if you commited it you should pay for it.

I think that what galls me the most it's how his supporters minimize what he did. He didn't stole a candy bar, he raped a child, <b> he planned it</b>, and if he did that to her who says he didn't do the same to other young girls who dared not to talk in fear that his influence would have more power than justice ... and you know what... they were right."

"event","This is it, I must really be a masochist because how comes that I always end reading things that I know will make me bleed? Last night I started reading Sakura Gari (The Hunt for Cherry Blossoms), the latest story by Watase Yuu, and probably her only official incursion in the realm of Yaoi.
 
My heart is still breaking, but I think that now I'm feeling emotionaly detached enough to write something coherent withouth tearing up... I'ts painful and beautiful... and above everything so sad...

Sakura Gari is placed in the Taisho Era ( around 1924?), and tells the twisted love story between Tagami Masataka, a 16 years old young man who goes to the city as a working student with the aim of getting into a prestigious university, and Saiki Souma an aristocrat's son of mixed heritage, so beautiful that is often refered as &quot;the western doll&quot;, and with a family full of dark secrets...

It IS melodramatic, but anyways my heart can't stop going to those two: Masataka, being betrayed by the person he admired SO much and getting stuck in a situation that it's not his fault AT ALL and that it's tearing him apart... and Souma, who's every action (no matter how hateful) makes sense plotwise, and so broken and starved for love that, although he does mind,  ends hurting the person he loves the most again and again because hate is better than indiference, but being ultimately aware that it's useless because his love will never smile at him again... /sob ;A;

I think that chapter eight haven't been scanlated yet (double sob), and it will probably end in january with chapter 9.  I'll keep hoping for a, if not happy, a not so sad ending... but something tells me I shouldn't hold my breath... <br type=""_moz"" />"

<center><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""10"" width=""500"" border=""1"" cellborder=""1""><tbody><tr><td bgcolor=""#faf6f6""><font face=""arial"" color=""#646364"">
<center><b>CHRISTMAS WISHLIST MEME</b> 

<b>Step One</b> 

- Make a post (public, friends locked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fun (&quot;I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me&quot;) to medium (&quot;I wish for _____ on DVD&quot;) to really big (&quot;All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV.&quot;) The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want. 

- If you wish for real possible things, make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves)could get in touch with you. 

- Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ, or link to this post (it'll be public) so that the holiday joy will spread. 


<b>Step Two</b> 

- Surf around your friends list (or friends friends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list. And now here's the important part: 

- If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use--or even know where you could get someone's dream purebred Basset Hound for free--do it. 

You needn't spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out, it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf--to spread the joy. Gifts can be made anonymously or not--it's your call. 

There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Just...wish, and it might come true. Give, and you might receive. And you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special.

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""on to the wishes \o/"">On to the Wishes \o/

</strike>3. A more fulfilling job... 

4. To start taking japanese classes again <strike>miss them so much ;A; 
</strike>
5. To draw a lot more and improve myself, and to start more doujinshi's and original stories AND FINISH THEM!!!!<strike> 

</strike>6. To finally find Stephen King's The Dark Tower III. <span style=""font-size: xx-small"">I've had book IV since I was in high school and I still can't read it because I can't find book III ANYWHERE /sniff 
</span>

<strong>On Fandom</strong> 

<strong><span style=""font-size: large"">7. <span>FANFICS!!!! </span></span></strong><span style=""font-size: large"">
</span>I would love to read more fanfics for popular couples I love like Abe/Miha, Hika/Aki and D18.

Edit: Thinking retrospectively, this feels a lot more like the kind of self promises you do when starting a new year... I think I'm going to print this and put it in a  place where I can see it all the time to remind myself and not let them be only wishes...

"event","What is this of posting things so long after the fact ^^; . The Japan Embassy, with the help of Jspot ( the largest anime fan organization here) organized a Kushida Akira concert last sunday. He's the singer for old anime and tokusatsu series like Kinnikuman and Uchuu Keiji Gavan (known as Jiban on these shores).<br /><br />IT WAS A BLAST!!! It didn't mattered that most of us didn't even know the Lyrics of the songs, heck or even the series they came from, none of that mattered at all, the energy levels were high and just so much fun!!! I'm very glad that I went. Kushi-san is such a nice person, very funny too, and even if the years are starting to get on him, very very talented and full of energy. At one point he asked some fans to get on the stage and started to sing covers for classics like Saint Seiya and Dragon Ball Z (he even sang half of it in Spanish *0*). Lol, I was&nbsp;afraid that fans would accidentaly&nbsp;throw him down&nbsp;the stage XDDDD<br /><br />I can't help getting excited, the organization of anime conventions here is still pretty new, but they keep getting better and better every time, and since last year the Japan Embassy is starting to have a more active role in their organization. I have the hope that if things keep running as smoothly as this one did, they'll help in bringing more artists, mangaka's or seiyuus like in other bigger conventions around the world... 8D<br />"

"event","Hahahaha, the joys of being in &nbsp;multiple fandoms XD. On wednesday night I found a very pretty picture in DA of a series that I had never hear before, but after inquiring a bit and a marathon of 17 chapters in a day I can say that now I'm a hardcore fan of Ookiku Furikabutte XDDDDDD. &nbsp;<br /><br />OMG I just love it so much!!! It's fun, interesting and all the characters are very likable, plus the presence of a very strong, confident and capable female coach in the middle of a shonen series <strike>I love her&hearts;</strike>. And there's also Mihashi!!! Mihashi Ren must be the most adorkable character in the world, and even if his extreme shyness can be a little bit too much some times, I can't stop adoring him and wanting to squish him &gt;w&lt; .This series &nbsp;also has the ability to put my yaoi senses in overdrive because:<br /><br />1- Abe and Mihashi's relationship is made of love. This one actually reminds me &nbsp;a lot of Hikaru and a Akira's relationship in Hikaru no go, in the sense that they can only be at their very best when playing each other, or in this case, playing side by side.<br />2- The random hand-holdings!!! (and one even included a mutual declaration of &quot;I like you&quot; X&quot;DDD)<br />3- Mihashi's hero worship of his Abe-kun, and Abe-kun's always being secretly pleased of it ( and in some cases even getting overly emotional and trying to hide it 8D)<br />4- Mihashi always acting like a puppy and Abe-kun always acting&nbsp;like his mom XDDD<br /><br />And here a pretty amv I found of them &gt;w&lt;<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""6""/><br /><br />In short I adore them, even if they are a pretty obvious couple, and as I'm still in the middle of a very deep D18 obsession I don't know how my brain is going to have space for anything else ;D<br /><br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

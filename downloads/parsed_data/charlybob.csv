what to say. 
okay so i went over to noahs after school and realized that harry potter has some of the worst acting EVER. nothing makes sense. and if you pause the second one on the spellbook, it says the most random shit ever. like there's a lady with a fat spider on her head. and hermione's like 'this spell is complicated!' and on the page next to it is something for a laxative. XD 
we have waaay too much time on our hands. why did i not realize the terrible acting before? i usually cry about it the second i see it. hmm."

"event","right! exciting weekend! 

on saturday i went to sharon's for a singing lesson and i'm getting super much better i actually like the way i sound now! and we picked out a song from Jeckel and Hyde, which is apparently a musical (>_>) and it's pretty but i forget it now. 

then i got new contacts. that has got to be the most exciting part of my weekend. 

then it was kata's play, so my parents drove me and noah down to sonoma to see her. we got there about an hour and a half too early, so we went to subway while my parents moseyed off to go visit friends. i called kata and she came to see me at subway, and by see i mean tackle violently. and i saw tisha also and met other people who i now completely forget. then kata had to go back to get ready and i went into the changing room and got kicked out. but not before i got my hiccama! so noah and i meandered down to the park, where i dropped my awsome hat in the sand by the swings. halfway back to the play, 15 minutes before it was going to start, i realized that i had left my hat there. so we walked back in a quick fashion and found mister Lost Hat, waiting there with a marigold in his belt. and then we ran back and made it just in time. the play was fantastic, and really sad and funny at the same time. the bad part was when the director was sitting right next to noah and i and during every scene change he would turn on his little flashlight and glance at the script, for no reason at all. after intermission noah made me sit right next to him. and the director promptly took mister Hat, who was lying right next to my feet. apparently he thought it was his. >< that's twice i had lost mister Hat. yeah so then the play ended and noah and i went to frollick backstage with the sonomians and tisha's boyfriend let me try on his awsome trenchcoat/dress. and i looked like a fantastic stalker. >=D then everyone left and we had to go wait out front of the school and try to call my dad on his cellphone, which he had lost.... and noah killed a sign. and tried to walk on it. i can you, that did not work out very well, for noah or for mister sign. and that was saturday. 

oh-ho-HO! but what about sunday, you ask?

weeeeellll

sunday morning was breakfast club, and i woke up at about eight thirty and realized SHIT IT'S BREAKFAST CLUB so i got up real quick-like and tried to call serena. didn't work out. but eventually i got to serena's in my pajamas and had much fun stealing bacon and ruining her nice clean floor. silly serena. oh yeah, and somewhere in there bridget confessed her undying hatred for me. ^_^ then we started to watch sixteen candles, and noah materialized by the couch about five minutes into it. much fun was had. then it was off to rillas, and hopefully to noah's, in order to film the macbeth satire peice of crap we hadn't yet written. yeah i'm just going to make a list now because sentences are much too hard to write before dinner:

1. i kicked ass at tetris

2. serena loves too much. in more ways than three. 

3. hot tubs + pajamas + obnoxious british accent= one happy but cold charlene

4. fingers make very good hoes (HAHAHAHAHa) 

5. jesse is a very cute little child unless he is weilding a stick

6. noah's backyard is the perfect setting for a disney movie, unless a sarcastic kevin is involved

7. rilla's dad is quite anal

8. noah does not like it when you kick him in the balls or slap him with a sleeve 

9. i can't think of nine

10. nothing yet

11. nope, that's all. eight. 

i'll tell you about today's fantastic monday fiasco later."

""i am aware now that everything's gonna be fine""
and i just don't care anymore.
well i care.
but i'm happy. 
it's like a diluted sense of nirvana. i'm happy, ok with things, and laughing at the world.
not like haha you suck laughing. 
like god you're silly you don't even exist! laughing. 
wow. that song californication. it's so crazy. i listened to it and looked up the definition of fornication. it's to cheat on your spouse. that fits so well, in a symbolic and literal sorta way. 
seriously. nobody's ever actually friends. we all cheat on eachother. in the end we realize that we truly love everybody. but until then, we're just mindlessly adulterating our friends. 
and i think about that, and i laugh. because in ten years, none of this will matter. and it makes me happy to believe in that. 
yes it's arguable that life sucks, everything's wrong with this world
but what's the point of that? isn't it just unhealthy to focus on negative things? what about the beautiful things in this world? like the way you feel when you realize you love someone unconditionally? or the sense of euphoria that comes from watching the waves rolling, knowing that even though you can't see it, the moon is making the sea into waves and it won't ever stop? or when you look up at the hills, and you see that even those hills that are so close are so removed from everything, from everything that seems to matter so much in that second? 
the strange part is, these feelings never last. they always shift, and you find them later, but it's never the same. 
i have become melancholic. 
i love everyone."

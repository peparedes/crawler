"event","Devin and Manda slept over.  Yes we did have another sleepover, and we are having another one on friday

The Relay meeting at Rachael's house was one hectic out of control party.  Manda, Devin, Rachael, Liana, Lauren D. Lauren M, Meagan, Sam, Andrew and me were there.  Unfortunately the only thing we got done was the banner, and I made the pretty pirate letters that say ""PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN"" and then everyone's hand print is on it.  Yes it it an amazing banner.  Other then that we just fooled around the whole time.  Andrew and Sam were playing on the computer on this weird phone site, where you call people up and have the computer voice talk instead of you.  It was really gay and annoying.  Meagan had to supervise us all, and i felt really bad for her because she really couldn't anything.  Gosh, it was just out of control.  

Well I'm off because I gotta go straighten my hair then shopping

"event","Alright i havn't been writing as much becuase i am so frickin busy...well alright..

I slept over Amanda's house with Devin last night.  It was so funny, we were online and we did the funniest things...(things that can not be spoken of) sorry... then in the afternoon we went to the movies and we saw beautyshop

    Before we went to see the moive, we went to Wendy's for lunch, but i didnt get anything.  So since i didnt eat anything in the car amanda and Devin were stuffing chickin into my mouth, but i didnt want to eat it so i threw it out the window and it hit the car next to us.  But in the car there was a crack in the window in the passengers seat, so devin goes: ""10 bucks for anyone who can get the chickin into the car."" and so Devin tried it and on her first time she got the chickin in the car.  It was so funny we were almost peeing out pants.  Gosh that was great

Alright so the movies, at first we were the only ones in the theater, and we were in the back row, so we were crazy.  I was throwing candy everywhere.  At first we were throwing it at the projecter, but there is a glass screen infront of it, so that didn't work.  Then i was throwing it at the screen and i was the only one that could get it to hit the screen.  
   Then Devin says to me, ""hey try and get it into the lights"" 
so Devin and i were throwing the candy, to get into the lights but  it never worked.
Then this old lady came in all by her self in the middle of the starting commericals, and just sat there like she was almost dead.  So unfortunally we had to stop.  
    The movie was good.  But it would have been better if we could scream and be loud (if that frickin lady had never came!)
    Then at the end she just got up and walked right out...it was really wierd.  

Then amanda and devin and maybe kate are sleeping over on tuesday.  And then we are sleeping over devins on friday...

And i got the best shoes when i went shopping, and lots of shirts...

"event","Heidi's shower is this weekend and our phones have been ringing off the hook with all the RSVP calls.  My mom is mad cleaning, lysoling everything and dusting every god forsakin inch of the house.  She even vacumed my room, which was a terror.  I volenteered to do it for her but she just said i dont trust you to do a good enough job. 

My doctor appointment is tomorrow and i get to get out of school early!!!! i dont know what they are going to say honstly.  When i went to the Emergancy room the night it happend, they just took X-rays of my wrist, and said that nothing was broken, then a few days later my elbow was all swelled up, and my mom wanted it X-rayed so then when we went to Baystate to check that they said that i had a hairline fracture in my elbow, and a hairline fracture is small but still bad.  So then they sent me to New England Orthapeedix which im going to tomorrow, so we'll see how that goes.

"event","It was one of those rare weekends that I didn&#39;t have to work so I decided to head down to good ole Columbus this past Friday night. My only real plans for the weekend were to attend the Distant Worlds concert and drink with friends. I suspected we&#39;d end up at Suzi Cues one or both nights and mostly stick to the campus area.

Anywho, I swung by Mike&#39;s place and picked him up before meeting up with Travis. Of course everyone was heading down to Matsuricon for the night to just chill. I honestly wasn&#39;t super stoked on the idea since there were more than a few people I would have liked to have avoided, but nobody likes a party pooper so I kept everything to myself. Thankfully, the con was more fun than I thought, probably because I finally managed to get buzzed drinking tons of shitty beer. I saw a bunch of people I hadn&#39;t seen in forever like Brittany and Collin. Stuff like that is pretty much the main reason for me to go to cons anymore since I don&#39;t cosplay or really keep up with current anime. Garrett saw me and made sure to comment on how good I look since I started working out and told me if I was Asain he&#39;d be all over me. Yeah, he was pretty drunk too. I bumped into Justin as well and we talked about why I was pissed at him. I told him why and he apologized. Honestly, things felt a lot easier when I was just angry at the kid and hated him. When someone does something like that it kinda sucks becuase it takes away your right to be pissed at them. I guess all those times I tried to hangout with him and he never returned my calls it was just apathy and not anything personal. I really wish life was black and white sometimes.

The few hours I spent at the con were enjoyable in the ways that being drunk and goofing around with friends always are. Of course this lead to me feeling less than stellar the next morning so I spent the first few hours pounding gatorade, eating greasy food and popping tylenol. Thankfully, by the time the concert rolled around I was just about functionable again. I had planned on getting all dressed up for it since it was held at the Ohio Theater which is super ritzy, but it was 90 fucking degrees out and a bit of a walk from where we could park so I copped out for shorts and a v-neck instead of dress pants and a button up.

But yeah, Distant Worlds. Holy. Fucking. Shit. It was an amazing nostalgia shotgun blast to the dick. I&#39;ve always enjoyed Final Fantasy music, but I never really went out of my way to buy or download the soundtracks. Yet somehow in person, with a full orchestra playing all the classic songs from every game, it was absolutely incredible. They had a big screen behind the orchestra showing scenes from all the games as the music played. It was seriously beautiful. Granted, I will never admit this in person for I am a manly man who only expresses his emotions through his fists (or the occasional table flip), but parts of it made me tear up a bit. Especially the FFVIII footage. VIII was probably the first one I ever played back in 4th grade and will always be held dear to me. And damn, I hate to admit it but some of the cutscene footage even hold up today. Its really crazy how cinematic it was considering it was 2 consoles ago. The footage/music from XIII was also super good. Really, they all were amazing in their own way. It was really great to see Nobuo Uematsu come out and actually play on stage for Dark Realm and then lead the chorus in One Winged Angel during the encore. It was honestly the best $60 I have spent in a loooooong time.

After the show Mike and I got some food, watched some Gundam UC, and then headed over to Cassandra&#39;s place. I figured we&#39;d just stop in and say &quot;hey&quot; real quick and chill for a bit before heading out but we ended up staying there all night because she had a bunch of awesome people over and cherry flavored vodka.

It ended up being a pretty awesome weekend. Usually I worry about not being social enough at parties or around people but I honestly never felt that way once. It was pretty damn nice."

"event","I had an epiphany at work today: I&#39;ve done more stuff in the past 8 months than I have in the past 3 years. I never really thought about it this way before, but it really puts certain things in perspective.

Since last November I&#39;ve gone to a shit ton more concerts, flown to Las Angeles to see my best friend and favorite band play, gone to Chicago for a week to see friends and explore a city I&#39;ve never really gotten the chance to see before, gotten to know my coworkers a lot more, spent a weekend at the Lake Erie islands, spent an immeasurably larger amount of time hanging out with friends, and tried a few new things I probably shouldn&#39;t post about on a public blog.

Things really aren&#39;t as bad as they may seem. Now if only I got a better job and didn&#39;t have to deal with this whole &quot;sexual frustration&quot; thing, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have any right to complain about much of anything."

"event","Well I've got some down time between class and meeting my friend James so I figured what better way to spend it than dusting off the old LJ and splattering down some random thoughts on it. 

First I guess I should talk about Ohayocon. Honestly there isn't a whole lot to talk about. It was the same old con it has been every year. I did enjoy it more than I thought I would, but that was only because my standards before getting there were pretty much in the basement. There weren't any real memorable stories or shenanigans to be had aside from talking to the one girl at the artist alley booth with all the jrock stuff and watching her freak when she saw Alex in her Daisuke outfit. Maybe I'm just exercising more self control at cons these days. I haven't kicked anyone in the nuts or spent all night Saturday hugging porcelain in quite a while. I guess we all have to grow up and get boring a some point,huh? 

...I'm sure I'll take back that whole ""maturity"" state after the next Jrock concert I go to >.>

Speaking of rocks of the J variety, I just so happened to stumble on a few indy bands that have once again lit a fire under my ass and finally given me something new to love and put on repeat for the next 3 months. D'lore and Di3sirae are both proving to be fun aggressive little bands. The real diamond in the rough though is Eat You Alive. Call me a tool for liking rap metal, but I don't care. This band gets the mix just right by throwing in a little screamo and hardcore flair making them more then just a Limp Bizkit wannabe guilty pleasure. Its the first legitimate ray of originality I've found worth listening to in the VK scene in I don't know how long. If your in the mood for listening to something new then I'd say check out their myspace and give them a shot. http://www.myspace.com/eatyoualive0307

It seems like forever since I've seen a good new movie. I really hope Wolfman will change all that. Then there's Shutter Island the week after that! Finally the movie season is picking up! I've been keeping myself distracted by watching all the special editions of the Alien films. I haven't seen them in so long that I forgot what most of them were even about. I have to say the first one is still by far my favorite. The third film had so much potential in the first half but it seemed like the plot started stumbling over itself halfway through. Aliens is a pretty solid action flick but definitely needs less Bill Paxton. And of course Resurrection never actually happened xP

Its looking like March is going to be an incredibly expensive month for me. Between a bunch of blu rays and amazing games coming out it might just break the bank. Gundam Unicorn, Red Cliff and the first Eva movie all come out that month and of course Final Fantasy XIII, and Yakuza 3 will be released too. I can't wait to piss off my roommate by hogging the TV 24/7 by playing Jrpgs. Fuck yes. And Resonance of Fate comes out pretty soon too. Fuck, there goes from being nothing but cookie cutter action games being released for months to this maelstrom of epic rpgs in such a short amount of time."

Now I'm back in Columbus counting down the minutes until I have to get to my first class. Yippie.  

Instead of bitching about how much I hate snow, driving through snow, and everything else about it aside from the mere pleasing aesthetic of it, I figure I'll just post some winter metal instead. Christmas metal is hella lame afterall.

"event","In an attempt to spark interest in this blog, not necessarily from those reading it but mostly from myself, I've decided to do something here I haven't done in quite a while; jabber on about a movie. 

Sure, I could shit out a few paragraphs about all the disposable high budget popcorn flicks that are currently clogging the local cinemas (not to say I don't enjoy said ""disposable high budge popcorn flicks"" as much as the next red blooded American) but what would be the point of that? You already have newspapers, message boards, and probably a lot of your friends mouth fapping about blue aliens or Team Jacob already so why beat a dead horse?

Instead I'll talk about a film I'm sure most of you have never heard of and possibly never will; Antichrist.

<lj-cut text=""No its not a fucking prequel to The Omen or any of that shite"">
First things first. Yes, the movie poster is a couple having sex at the base of a dead tree those are arms coming out from between the roots. Hopefully that gives you some faint idea of what your getting yourself into if by any chance you decide to go see this movie. 

There's only two actors in the entire film. Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg star as He and She respectively. Their a married couple who lose their baby after he falls from their loft window while the couple are having sex. She ends up taking it a lot worse then He and blames herself for the whole incident. Dafoe's character, being a therapist believes medical treatment isn't the proper way for dealing with grief and that She must face her fears directly in order to overcome them. The summer before She took their child to a cabin deep in the woods called Eden to finish her thesis. He finds that this place seems to be the root of her fears and takes her back there in hopes of helping her overcome her grief. As one might expect, shit starts going pretty nuts once their in the woods and secluded from real civilization.

Perhaps I should clarify what I mean when I say ""shit starts going pretty nuts."" While the film is entirely in English this shouldn't by any means mean that the film should be automatically categorized as any sort of mainstream contemporary American horror film. For one, I don't think there's one jump scare the entire movie. The terror is built up entirely through psychological effect. One scene in particular that struck me was when the couple were on their way to the cabin in the woods. He wanders off by himself while their taking a break and sees a deer in a meadow. For some reason I thought of The Unborn, an American horror film that came out a year or so ago and somehow managed to blame the Nazis for all the supernatural torment that happens in the film. But I digress, while it would seem in any other film the deer's head would have turned upside down or it would have started vomiting blood or something as equally creepy yet in-your-face surreal, it didn't. Instead it just stood there starring at Dafoe's character, but when it turned to walk away it revealed half of a dead baby deer hanging from its rear. That scene alone managed to be genuinely discomforting while still managing to keep things grounded in the real world. And that's why this film works so well. Its no great feet trying to sympathize with She's overpowering despair for losing her child by sheer neglect. But the film doesn't stop there, it just keeps pounding away at the nihilism, chaos, and misogyny of it all until it just leaves you feeling drained.  

This film didn't obtain an R rating and for good reason. There's graphic nudity and sex, varying degrees of sexual violence, and normal stomach churning violence as well. That's not to say it descends into ""torture porn"" in attempts to gross out the audience a la the Saw franchise. While there are a couple extremely graphic and haunting scenes that make one want to turn away from the screen, it all manages adds to the emotional impact and never crosses over into raw exploitation. But be warned, this film is definitely not for the squeamish. It has some of the most jarring violence I've seen on film that I can remember. 

But alas, a horror film that scares is still nothing more than a film that might keep you up at night. This film really is more than that. There are so many layers to explore in the story and interpret that its really a film that forces you to think about it a great deal once the credits have already rolled by.

Even though I've been heaping vast amounts of praise on this film, I can by absolutely no means call it entertaining. The main reason I decided to see it was because it has been causing a great stir at film festivals and among critics, some even going so far as to call it the most despairing film ever made. While I don't agree with that statement, its still an artistic study on the darkest parts of human nature. Watch at your own discretion. </lj-cut>

"event","Another gigantic gap between LJ posts! I wish I had an excuse for it but I've just been lazy. The main reason I'm updating this now is because I've been staring at my computer screen for the past 4 hours trying to type up a 10 page paper about the war on drugs and need a little bit of a break from it. 

Even though the people that will actually read through this entry can probably be counted on one hand I still feel like throwing some random thoughts down here for nostalgia's sake. 

The end of the quarter is rapidly approaching and I'm kinda almost ready for it. The Mirror Lake Jump was last night and I'm pleased to say I had absolutely no part in that fucktarded event. Unfortunately the ""blood money"" I've been living off of by selling OSU football tickets has run out since their aren't any more home games so I've resorted to having to pickup more shifts at my shitty shitty shitty on campus job. I never thought working as a pizza delivery boy could ever be so stressful. Business at the PAD has more than tripled since last year so we're always crazy busy and everyone is stressing out. Needless to say the job has almost completely stopped being fun anymore. I talked to a bunch of people that have been working there for as long as me or longer and they all agree that the PAD is just one giant life sucking leech. The best people working their have long since quit and all the new hires seem to be too busy trying to keep afloat amidst the never ending stream of pizza orders. The closing shift has become the worst nightmare since we rarely get out before 1:45 am anymore. We used to be out around 1:15 almost all the time, but I have yet to work a shift where that has happened yet this quarter. I know I'm ranting a lot here, but 20 hours a week at this job allows me to vent a little I think. Actually I'm gonna end up working 30 hours this week. At least $400 biweekly paychecks are nice even if their barely keeping my checking account afloat. 

I feel like I've been playing too many video games lately. I know I've already spent somewhere close to 30 hours on Persona 4 already. That game is easily one of the most entertaining RPGs I have ever played. I haven't been this addicted to a longer game like this in a long time. I also hopped on the Modern Warfare 2 bandwagon like so many other people. Its the first time I've actually really gotten into playing multiplayer online. If any of you kids play it on PS3 then send me a friend request so we can kill each other online. My handle is BiologicalSlicer.

I guess I should talk about Jrock for a while too. It seems most of my favorite bands have been keeping it on the DL or haven't been doing anything I want to be a part of. I used to buy all Girugamesh's albums but now I couldn't care less about their new one because their last few singles were really repetitive. That and I hate how their releasing 3 different versions of NOW, each with its own exclusive material. Even if its the record label's fault I'm still sick and tired of seeing the fans get raped for every penny they have by ridiculously expensive merchandise and sales gimmicks. Bleh, the only band I'm really stoked for right now is Merry since I just downloaded their new concert DVD and it is fucking amazing. Their playing in some tiny little shithole live house but the performance is just so powerful. The editing gives it an awesome raw punk feel that makes it really entertaining to watch. It wasn't until their last album Underworld that I realized how fucking awesome this band really is. I really hope they stick with the crazy, raw live sound.

Anyways, since this post is in danger of becoming too long I should wrap it up. I'll be coming home Thanksgiving weekend to be forced to eat a meal with my family. Thankfully I'll be with Alex too so that will make it all worthwhile. Not sure what else is going on that weekend, but if anyone from back home wants to hang then you know the number to dial. 

Hopefully it won't be another 7 weeks until my next entry..."

Anyways, I suppose I should fill you kids on the goins-ons of the life of your friendly neighborhood Danimation. I spent most of the summer either working, at the movies, or going to see my girlfriend. Yeah, I finally got one of those. Its kinda fucking awesome being happy since your with someone that makes you happy all the time. Being in love is pretty awesome. Although I apparently inadvertently pissed off a few people by being happy, but they can go shove a pineapple up their cootch for all I care =D

As far as school goes I've made a few more changes with whats going on before I graduate. I gave up on trying to get into the business school here since it just wasn't going to happy so I now I'm firmly settled in the prospect of graduating with a bachelors in International Studies. Not that glamorous of a major, but at least with a bachelors degree I'll have a lot more job opportunities open when I graduate. I stopped taking Japanese too since it wouldn't fit into my schedule this year. I'm kinda bummed but I keep telling myself I'll keep studying it on my own even though I doubt how much I'll actually keep up with it. It will be nice though actually getting to focus on my classes since when I was taking Japanese that always seemed like the priority class and everything else just came second to it. I should actually be able to raise my grades this quarter. I'm still really nervous about being able to find an internship before I graduate. My adviser also told me I should have a resume together and start applying to businesses that I'm interested in by Spring quarter which sucks for me since I still have no idea what I want to do after college and just switched to this major a few months ago. School pressure is not fun. 

I'm hoping this quarter doesn't have too many problems. I'm in class all day Monday and Wednesday, but then I have the rest of the week off. Well, mostly off since I still work like 20+ hours a week at the PAD. My classes don't seem too terrible except for my ""Latin American Studies from a Business Prospective."" That class is going to bore me to fucking tears. 

My roommate has been a pretty big fuckface since I got back too. He thinks he's special since he actually cleaned up the apartment a little bit before I came back so now he's just bitching about the smallest things. If I put a doughnut down on our table with a napkin under it he says ""you better not get that damn table sticky."" He's 90% of the reason this place was a fucking mess last year and he never lifted a finger before to clean anything up. It just gets me when people try to throw stuff in your face that they themselves are completely guilty of. Fucking disgusting hypocrites. I really hope to god he mellows out some otherwise its going to be a looooooong fucking year. Good thing I'm not around the apt 24/7 like that waste of space is. Oh yeah, and I'm sure Ralph accidentally walking in on him naked, beating off in his chair the other night didn't help things either. Holy shit I'm happy he was the one that saw it and not me. 

Anyways, I have to start getting ready for a really fun shift at work during a really fun football game going on now. 

Oh yeah, and watch this music video since its terrible.

Anyways, class has been soul crushingly depressing like always. Maybe not that bad, but its a giant pain in the ass to bring myself to care about studying or anything with summer so close. With two weeks of class left before finals the end is so damn close I can taste it. Unfortunately my CSE final is the very last day of finals week so that dashes any hope of going back home and going to work early. Guess I'll have to work a few extra shifts at the PAD to make up for it. *vomits up colon*

Speaking of CSE, the other day in lecture I was struggling to stay awake like usual when some dude in a gorilla suit came running down the main aisle while yelling monkey noises. It was probably the coolest thing I've ever seen happen on this campus ever. 

<lj-cut text=""Jrock Stuff""> I figure I'll toss this stuff behind a cut since maybe 5 people give a damn about this music on my f-list. 

But yeah, have I talked about how much I fucking love Pay Money To My Pain? I am seriously all over this band's dick. Their really influenced by American music because, uh their a hardcore band and all their lyrics are in English. And they record all their stuff in LA... But of course they aren't signed to an American label and pretty much never play shows over here. Anyways, I bought their two albums when I was in Tokyo because they had a display that was playing their videos at Tower Records. I pretty much fell in love with them after the first song. I ordered their two singles off cdjapan too since the songs on them aren't on the albums and they both came with dvds. Their first single was the last one I got in the mail and the PVs it came with were pretty surprising. All their other music is typical screamo, LA style hardcore with some more slower and melodic songs thrown in here and there. I expected their first release to be pretty hardcore to show what style the band was shooting for and all, but holy shit was I surprised when I saw the Black Sheep video. Its really dark and you can't even tell its a PTP song until about a minute and a half into it. The video has a cryptic looking church, a zombie, devil, and anti-religious lyrics. Oh yeah, and one evil fucking looking Jesus.

See! Fucking crazy stuff! Never saw that one coming. I'm happy they changed their style and don't try to make such an intense statement with the rest of their music. Not to say I don't like this video either. It is pretty badass >.>

Aside from P.T.P I've been having fun delving deeper into the realm of aggressive indy VK. VanessA is amazing as shit and helps fill the void UnsraW in my heart left when they went on hiatus. OZ is sexy as ever and I can't wait for their new album (I'll be fucking pissed though if it ends up being nothing but a bunch of re-recordings). And then there's Nega. Oh god Nega. This band tries their damnedest to be as dark and shocking as possible and I love them for it even if they kinda fail lol. Their Muddy Cult PV is pretty much a trashier version of Obscure, complete with female dismemberment and their guitarist vomiting up worms. Good stuff, right? And then they have a song called Labia. I'm pretty sure the band looked up a diagram of the female genitalia in English and then took a random word from it to name a song. Still, its a pretty kickass song.

Then the new studs album just came out. With a name like alansmithee I was wondering where they were coming from with it. A quick google search later I realized it was actually a person's name, Alan Smithee. It was a pseudonym that movie directors would use when they made a film they were ashamed of and didn't want people to know they were involved with the project. Interesting, or at least I think so. Titles aside, I had really high hopes for this album since I love the studs so very very much, yet was worried about the group when they announced their drummer would be leaving after their last tour. Thankfully the album didn't disappoint. Just like their last album, and hate, I find I can listen to this over and over again and not get tired of it. I've listened to it at least 4 times since I got it Friday which is surprising since I usually can't stand listening to certain songs over and over since I have a short attention spans. This songs are just really enduring to me. I was really happy to find they included english translations of all their songs in the lyric booklet too. I had been wondering what Diasuke's ""straightforward"" lyrics were like and I'm finally happy to get actual translations. I hope someone scans the normal versions booklet so I can see the lyrics for Creepy Crawly as well. </lj-cut>

Its so nice having the apartment to myself this weekend. I can play music as loud as I want and sit around in my boxers building Gundam models all day. Now if only the fucking AC would work..."

In retrospect, I actually feel better about things today (minus the hangover). Seems like once I crash and burn I can sink comfortably back into apathy for a while longer before the whole process starts over again. I'll enjoy this mindset while I have it now I guess. 

My roommate wanted to watch The Wrestler tonight so I agreed to chill and watch it with him. Its a great movie, but holy fuck is it depressing. Its a little too much like real life for its own good. Movies like that are nice every once and a while, but damn. I don't watch movies just to be reminded of how shitty real life actually is. Watching Monkeybone with my other friend earlier was a much better choice. 

I honestly want to praddle on more about crap, but I'm in dire need of sleep so watch this video instead. And in case your wondering, no its not fucking jrock related.

"event","I realized its been way too long since I've had any awesome memories to look back on and make myself feel better. Monday during math class I was struggling to stay awake like usual when I noticed something fall out of my notebook. It was the mini Merry calendar I got free at Tower Records. My notebook was still in my backpack while I was in Japan so I tossed the mini calendar in there so it wouldn't get bent up. Just seeing that sent a rush of memories flooding back. 

Sure, it hasn't been long at all since I was in Japan, but still. Its so nice to just escape for a second back into my memories of an awesome trip. There were so many moments that really effected me while I was there. Pretty much all of those moments were at the concerts. One of the biggest ones was at the Dir en grey show. People in the audience were doing the headbang move where you put your arms on the shoulders of the person in front of you to steady yourself while you thrash your head around like there's no tomorrow. I decided to give it a try when I was getting sore from the moshpit, and to my surprise someone put their hands on my back and started doing the same thing. I know it sounds stupid, but it made me feel accepted. Leading up to the show I was expecting to be treated differently cuz of that whole gaijin business. It was really something to feel like a part of a group and not be ostracized or anything. 

The other memory that really stuck with me was the Sadie concert. That was probably one of the most personal shows I've ever been to just because I was so incredibly close to the band and the members genuinely cared about their fans. I rarely get emotional at shows, but I was on the verge of tears during Swallow Rain. Mao was just so fucking intense that show. The music was so much more powerful than just listening to it on CD. I'm so thankful I had the opportunity to see them at a venue like that because I highly doubt I would have been able to have a similar experience anywhere else. 

As always, I feel like I should say more in these entries. Today though, I think this is all that really needs to be said."

"event","These concerts are really starting to take their toll on me. Im almost happy that their all over now.

Today was the Sadie live which was all the fuck ways out in Saitama. It was a good hour train ride from our hostel just to get to the fucking place. There wasnt much there either aside from the giant Saitama stadium. 

We ate a late lunch from one of the random shops by the venue. The curry was fucking magic even if it was out of a bag. After eating we got in line for merch. I was gonna buy a t-shirt but they only had smalls so I bought a hoodie instead. We bummed around for a couple more hours until they started lining people up to get into the venue. The started letting people in right on time which was nice. I had ticket 29 so I was in the second row right in front of the mic stand. It was funny how much taller I was than everyone else. I had a perfect view of everything on stage.

The fans seemed kinda relaxed and not too crazy until the members started walking out and began the first song. Immediately the fans all pushed forward as hard as they could while shrieking the band members names in the most high pitched shrill voice you could imagine. I cant recall the exact name of the opening song since it was a new one off their latest album. They played almost every song off MoR. They also played Meisei, Children of Despair, and Rock n Roll Stinky People during the main set. They were so fucking amazing live. Swallow Rain and Crimson Tear were both especially intense. Maos growling was pretty damn impressive in person. I hadnt been too crazy about their new album, but hearing the songs live makes me appreciate them a whole lot more. I cant remember which one, but for one of the songs Mizuki was having guitar trouble so he just picked up a microphone and started to growl alongside Mao. It was pretty entertaining to see xD

Oh yeah, did I mention how close I was to the band? When Mao got up on the box and thrust his arms into the air his crotch was literally less than two feet away from my face. I could have easily touched his boots. Its just nuts being that close where you can actually look the members in the eye. Its almost creepy. Sure beats the shit out of large stadium shows.

For the encore the band came back wearing tour t-shirts, except for Mizuki who was wearing a Girugamesh shirt xD They hopped right back into it with two more tracks from MoR. Then they called out last song and started playing an older one off the Trend Killer.  Im so bad with song names, sorry! It was amazing and everyone went wild. The band started throwing a bunch of crap into the audience. Mizuki and Tsurugi hung around the longest shaking peoples hands in the audience and throwing water bottles out. Mizuki even picked up the mic and thanked everyone for coming out before finally leaving. 

When they were all gone the lights in the veneu came back on and the BGM started again even though fans kept cheering for another encore. I headed back to find Ralph and leave, but right as we were heading for the exit all the members came back on stage again. At first I thought they were just going to talk some more but then they started picking up their instruments again. I was pretty surprised they were actually going to do an un planned encore. Mao said something to the about how we were so loud that they had to come back out. The audience kept cheering and Mao tried to quit them, even saying shut up at one point xD Finally, they just stared playing A Holy Terrors. I was more towards the back for this song, but at least I had room to headbang now. Up front it was so incredibly cramped I coudlnt move my arms for most of the show. The final song was really great though because you could tell the band was really enjoying themselves and that they actually cared about the fans. Mao let the audience sing most of the lyrics which was nice. At the end of it they marched off stage again. Mizuki was last to leave once more and told people to go home since theyd miss the last train other wise xD

Ralph managed to get Mizukis pic at the end, but the show didnt go so smoothely for him. Some of the girls next to him wanted him to move to the right and when he didnt get the hint they started punching him in the side xD We ran into two girls from the show on the way back to the train station who said otsukare to us. I managed to meek out a response to them in my hoarse voice and they started laughing and ran off. It was nice to know some of the fans thought we were cute xD

It was one hell of a satisfying end to a week of crazy concerts."

"event","So you know that song Child Prey? Yeah, it sounds even better live.

We got to Kawasaki early in the morning and found the venue. We still had around 6 hours til the show started so we just bummed around La Citadel for a while. When we went back to the venue after an hour or so we saw that they had set up a line for merch so we got into that. By some magical stroke of luck the person behind us was reading a book in English so we asked him all the little questions like if they have lockers inside the venue or not. He was a really nice guy too so it was incredibly lucky we met him. 

Blah blah blah we bought merch blah blah blah we got in the main line blah blah blah they let us into the venue incredibly efficiently. Oh yeah, we saw another gaijin there but he looked like a douche and it made us sad that Ralph and I werent special anymore. Anyways, we tossed our crap in a coin locker and then ran into the hall. We got a pretty decent spot in the center and waited for the show to start. They had a DJ spinning tracks which was pretty crazy. He played everything from the Beastie Boys to Limp Bizkit. The last song before the show was scheduled to start was some Slipknot one and people actually started moshing to it. 

It wasnt long until Sa bir came on and the band walked out. Kyo was rocking a red Adidas track suit with black stripes while the rest of the band looked like they usually did. Toshi had a dumb headband on though so you couldnt see his dumb haircut. 

Right after Sa bir ended Vinushika started. The song was like a countdown to the aggressive parts because I was really curious to see how the Japanese fans would react. But they reacted like every other concert Ive been to. Mosh! Mosh! Mosh! It was just crazy and amazing. Red Soil started up next and it was just as good, if not better than on CD. They ended up playing every song off Uroboros except for Inconvenient Ideal and Ware. They also tossed down Agitated, Obscure, Hydra 666, Repetition of Hatred, and Clever Sleazoid before wrapping up the main set. I was pretty surprised they played Glass Skin, but the performance was so incredibly intense. Kyos voice was so much more pained than on the single. It sent fucking shivers down my spine. And the acapellas were a far cry from the agitated unplugged growl fest. It was a slow distorted mix of chanting, mumbling and praying. It was eerily serene. 

Kyo did his usual stage routine, but it was Toshiya that was trying his damndest to steal the show. Every second he could hed spend it up at the edge of the stage rocking out. Even when he didnt have a part in the song he was swaying back and fourth trying to get more attention. He even spun his bass around at one point and stood on Shinyas drums towards the end of the main set. 

When the band left the stage after the main set we all started calling for them to return. The chanting went from En-co-re to Dir-en-grey and to god knows what else. Amongst the audience everything was in harmony yet total chaos at the same time.

GDS started up after 10 or 15 minutes and everyone started freaking out again. Once all the members were back out on stage they jumped right into Child Prey. Thats right, mother fucking Child Prey. Needless to say the audience went fucking crazy. I pulled together my remaining strength and threw myself into the moshing. I started doing the headbang/mule kick thing because Im a bad person and just dont care. It was funny since everyone backed off too lol. Gaika was right after that and was just as sexy as you could hope. Saku followed and was another excuse to headbang as hard as you could. Rasetsukoku was next and you could tell the band loved getting up close and interacting with the audience. This was about when people decided to ignore the no crowd surfing signs. Anyone who says Diru doesnt approve of crowd surfing has a bloody tampon in their ear. Kyo pointed at a few people he saw doing it and waved them on. It was fucking magical. 

Just when I thought the show was over Kyo called out Last Song and the intro to Zan started. More freaking out and anger ensued. It was ridiculous how relentless that song is. Towards the end I decided to join everyone who was hopping on the bar to crowd surf. Unfortunately I jumped where there werent enough people and stayed up for like 3 seconds before being let down on my feet. The song ended shortly after and Kaoru threw his guitar into the audience before leaving. It was a damn good thing that I didnt get carried to the front because after the song ended and the band started throwing shit out into the audience Shinyas drumstick landed right at my fucking feet and I was able to get to it before anyone else. Thats right, no one even fought me for it. After the show a few kids saw me with and came up to shake my hand and congratulate me for getting it. 

Holy fucking shit tit dicks I love this country."

"event","So last night we found out the Exist Trace show was today instead of tomorrow. Ralph and I spent pretty much the entire day messing around in Shinjuku waiting for the show to start. Hit up a bunch of arcades and got my Gundam vs. Gundam on. Oh yeah, and we saw the Dragonball movie too. It was mindless fun. Nothing more, nothing less. If it was in Cantonese and you didnt know it was Dragonball than everyone would love it.

We went to a few more video game and manga shops before we headed to the venue. The show was at a real tiny hole in the wall place called ANTIKNOCK which specialized in indy punk and metal shows. I still have no idea why Exist Trace was playing there. The first band was called Infected and was literally a bunch of high school kids in Iron Maiden and other metal shirts just going crazy on stage. Its something youd see at a battle of the bands over here or something. The bassist jumped off the drum set and accidentaly unplugged his guitar, one of the guitarists ran into the crowd, and the vocalist kept jumping up on the barrier and doing the demon horns. It was entertaining to say the least.

After they were done Exist Trace came on and they were pretty much the stone cold opposite. Cool and calm, while posing a lot in their Vanguard outfits. Oh yeah, and they had a smoke machine. Theyve really matured a lot as a band. From their stage presence to their music, they seemed really polished at this show. They played Infection, Liquid, Vanguard, and a couple other songs I cant recall the name of. It was an intense but short set. Oh yeah, and the guitarist gave us the finger before walking off stage xD

After they wrapped up we decided to stand off to the side and see if we could get them to sign one of their photosets they bought at the merch booth. While we were waiting for them the members of Infected came out and start hanging out with us. They were really funny guys and we joked around for a while. It was awesome actually being able to chill with those guys at such an underground venue. Apparently the whiskey bottle sitting on the table next to where we were standing was filled with one of the bands piss. The bassist pointed to it and said it was filled with pee xD 

After joking around for a while more we went outside and saw all the members of Exist Trace loading their stuff into the van so we asked if we could get their autographs which they graciously obliged. Ralph and I, as well as the band were both pretty nervous but I still managed to thank them and tell them they had a kickass set. 

When we got their autographs we decided to head back to the station since nothing else that night could really top hanging out with Infected and getting to meet Exist Trace. This day ended up being pretty freaking awesome and a great warm up for the Dir en grey show in two days."

Oh yeah, and we somehow found the place where Girugamesh is playing tonight by complete accident. We couldnt get tickets because they sold out, but that didnt stop me from buying a shirt from the merch stand outside the venue. I felt really dirty doing it. Might have to sell that thing for double what I bought it for online just to make myself feel better about not going >.>

Might have to go see the Dragonball movie tonight since its playing here. That movie is gonna be freaking lolz tastic. Saving it for tomorrow might be better though since thats the last free day before the ridiculous 4 straight days of angry metal shows."

The fact that Yuana is their guitarist is pretty much the only reason I cared about them. Well, after finally seeing New World I have to say its kind of what I expected. Its pretty catchy although you can't really feel much of Yuana's influence except for his guitar solo. I wonder if he's the band leader? The PV is pretty cool, especially for being their very first. Its probably gonna take me a while to warm up to their vocalist's voice, but I'm still really looking forward to finding out what the rest of their mini album sounds like. For now I'll just be stoked on the fact that I get to see Yuana look all VK again (even if that means he shows his thighs and wears a cape xD)

But yeah, both my panels are on Saturday. ""The Jmusic Experience"" is at 2:00pm and ""Jrock: Hardcore"" is at 5:00pm. We are going to have so much fun with these damn things! The first one is just going to be me and James talking about Koda Kumi and the Teriyaki Boyz for an hour xD The other one is going to be even more nuts since I'm hosting it with Ralph. We're so talking about lynch, deathgaze, -oz-, Born, Dio, Deluhi, KLACK, Antifeminism, kagerou, old 12012, the gazerock, sadie, unsraw and too many more I can't think of right now. I don't even care, the panel is opening with gazette's Discharge video from their RCE DVD. I wish they would have given me the two hours I requested, but I guess I'll just have to make do with just one.

I'm pretty excited for this! I can't wait to get started on making a powerpoint and figuring out what all we're going to show and talk about.  If you guys are free that day then you should totally come check them out, unless of course you hate Jmusic!

And since I don't have the attention span to type up the whole trip in one sitting, this will be the Chicago leg of the journey.

<lj-cut text=""Everything up to the Chicago show""> I worked until 4pm on Tuesday. Of course the bus to take me back to my apartment afterwards was a half hour late. When I got back I took a shower and threw all the crap I thought I needed into my backpack and set out to Ralph's place in Akron. Of course right when I got there it started snowing hardcore. I almost spun out a few times before I made it to his house. When I did manage to get there Ralph was farting around with some friends so we ended up leaving 2 hours later than expected. Lots of boring driving later and we somehow managed to find Crystal in Pontiac and set off on our journey to Chicago. Of course I did all the driving since Ralph likes to fall asleep at the wheel and he was feeling tired that night >.>

I think it was around 6 or 7 am that we finally managed to make it to House of Blues Chicago. It was pretty miraculous I was able to drive the whole night without having to sleep. We decided to save the hassle of finding parking on the streets and pay the $42 for valet parking. Yep, $42 for one day. Go Chicago. 

Since we were all pretty exhausted we tried to find someplace we could crash for a little bit since the valet took the car away and we didn't have to worry about getting in line just yet. Ralph led us to this hotel right by the venue and we headed up to the 6th floor where we found a couch in the corner to crash on. I drifted in an out of sleep for a few hours, but I woke up at around 9:30ish to see a guy in a suit standing over us with his hands on his hips. He asked if we had a room here and we all just kinda stared at him blankly. Finally I told him we'd be leaving so we headed towards the elevator and he escorted us out of the building. *sigh* At least he didn't call the cops or anything.

I thought we were gonna go get food afterwards but I guess everyone else wanted to go to Caribou so Grace led us there and bought us drinks so we chilled there for over an hour. I was feeling pretty sick by now since the only source of nourishment to enter my body in the past 12 hours came in the form of a 20 oz bottle of Vault and a small hot coco. It was pretty torturous waiting around for our 11:30 lunch reservation at HoB. 

We headed back to the venue and waited around inside for it to be 11:30. If you ate at the restaurant there then they'd let you into the venue before everyone else that was already lined up outside. Of course word of this got out and a bunch of people went inside to do the same. Shannon and Shelly were there so I talked to them for a little bit. Also, 2 of Crystal's friends showed up and joined our group about then. I totally didn't remember their names so I just called them ""The Tall One"" and ""The Short One"" since uh, one was tall and one was short xD They were pretty awesome though and it was a lot of fun hanging out with them in line. When it was finally time for the food I got the chicken fingers (of course!) and cleared off the plate in a matter of minutes. They weren't the best but I was still overjoyed to be eating a warm meal. 

When we were done eating it was finally time to wait in line for the doors to open at 5:30. Typical line shenanigans ensued to pass the time. We sang off key to any and every song we knew the words. It probably annoyed a lot of people, but fuck 'em xD Around 4:00 security decided to move our entire line outside since it was getting too crowded inside. This was super awesome since all of us had already put our jackets inside our cars. I was wearing long sleeves and doing my best to look scene-as-fuck so it wasn't too bad, but I felt pretty bad for the girl with pink hair that was only wearing a corset thingy. Time moved by so much slower outside in the cold but we ended up telling a bunch of offensive jokes for like a half hour straight so that helped xD 

When the time finally came to let us into the venue they divided the boys and girls into two lines to get frisked. This was pretty awesome for me since there couldn't have been more than 5 guys ahead of me in line. Guess having a penis at a jrock concert isn't that bad afterall. I managed to get a spot one person back from the bar just slightly right of the vocalist's spot on stage. It felt so damn good to be out of the cold and finally have a spot in the crowd. The inside of the Chicago House of Blues was so much ridiculously nicer than Cleveland's. The stage was bigger and everything was decked out in fancy decorations. Dir en grey's gigantic banner was fully visible in the back and was fucking awe inspiring. 

The people I ended up being around with were pretty cool for the most part. The fact that they were all rather cute girls made it all the better when everyone started pushing like crazy trying to get up front. I talked to this one girl next to me that reminded me a little bit of Amber. Her name was Brianna and we joked around about the bands and stuff and made fake orgasm noises when everyone started pushing hard xD I really should have tried to get her number or something but I couldn't get to my phone since my hands were pinned at my side since everyone was packed in so tight. Fail, I know D:</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Dir en grey with The Human Abstract at The House of Blues, Chicago"">I had never listened to anything from the first band, The Human Abstract so I had no expectations for them. I was honestly expecting them to suck a big fat one, as was most other people in the audience. However, with their opening song my opinion of them totally changed and I was blown away. They rocked the shit out of that bitch. Their vocalist was freaking awesome. He swung his mic stand around like a madman. He accidentally hit a girl in the front row right in the head with it xD Oh yeah, and he stage dived. A lot. In case you don't know, that's incredibly ballsy for a band in their position. Bands that open for Dir en grey here are pretty much lambs being sent to slaughter. The audience hates them since they are only making their wait for Dir en grey all the longer. The fact that the vocalist would jump into this crowd of people is just mind boggling. Whats awesome though was the first time he jumped into the audience he broke this one guy's glasses so he grabbed the vocalist and started ripping his shirt and fishhooked him. The vocalist had to punch him in the face just to get away xD It was one of the funniest damn things I've seen in a long time xD Oh yeah, and he kept stage diving after it too lol. Although they didn't get the respect from the audience they deserved, they still put on a totally kickass set and managed to win me over.

Once The Human Abstract wrapped with their set they left the stage while the roadies setup Diru's equipment. It wasn't soon after that the BGM of Sa Bir kicked in and signaled the start of Dir en grey's set. The band members walked out in normal clothing except Kyo who was decked out head to toe in Adidas gear. Can we say endorsement? They hopped right into Obscure as their first song which made everyone in the audience, myself included, go fucking crazy. It was the perfect opening song. They kept up the ferocious pace with Grief and Agitated. My neck was already sore as fuck by the fourth song from all the ridiculous headbanging xD They continued to rock that bitch with songs from Marrow and Withering. The highlight of the show though was when Kyo performed Agitated unplugged. Seeing a grown man huddle down around a microphone and make the most ungodly distorted shrieking noises you can possibly imagine was nothing short of haunting. It was truly a sight to behold. Afterwards they seamlessly transitioned into Conceived Sorrow which was just amazing live. They played some more songs and wrapped their main set up with Repetition of Hatred but returned shortly for the encore. After four more songs they ended the night with IIID Empire and then proceeded to throw pics, drumsticks, and water bottles into the audience.  

The show itself was just amazing. I was pretty bummed at first when I heard they wouldn't be playing many tracks off their new album, but by the end of their set I didn't care in the least bit. Kyo actually sang pretty much all the lyrics and really put his all into the performance. He had the fiercest stage presence throughout the whole set. The rest of the band also looked legitimately happy to be playing there. All of them, Toshiya especially, headbanged like crazy and ran up to the front of the stage so all the audience could see them. It was really different from the last times I saw them live where it seemed like they were just distant and not really into it. Toshiya and Die had the biggest smiles on their faces when they threw stuff into the audience at the end. It added so much to the show to see that the band was enjoying themselves just as much as we were.

The audience was pretty awesome too, at least where I was. Everyone was pretty respectful and didn't start too much shit. Plus we all knew the words to most of the songs and screamed along to the parts we were supposed to. There was this one muffin behind me though who kept screaming out ""Kyo-sama!"" about every 5 seconds. Thankfully some guy next to hear yelled ""Shut the fuck up you stupid weaboo bitch!"" It was fucking magical. And by some miracle I managed to stay in the same spot the whole show without being pushed back. It sure as fuck wasn't easy though, especially with a pit forming not too far behind where I was. Since the show began so early it wrapped up before 10 pm. It took forever to gather everyone together and get the car. When we were all set we started on the 6+ hour drive to Minneapolis.</lj-cut>"

If all the songs on it ended up being terrible then I wouldn't be upset but it was worth every penny and I seriously love all the songs on it. I went ahead and pre-ordered their greatest hits album as well. Out of all the bands in the Jmusic scene that are around right now I hate to see such an amazing group call it quits.  

Today James introduced me to one of the Japanese exchange students. His name was Shuichi and his English was very good which was awesome since my Japanese is really terrible. He was a cool guy, I was telling him about how I wanted to visit Japan and that I'm really fond of Jmusic so we talked about that for a while. He's a fan of Maximum the Hormone and Ellegarden which is fucking awesome. Oh yeah, and during dinner James and I did our best to explain to him what sororities and fraternities are but we probably just ended up confusing him more xD I hope I get the chance to hang out with him again though.

I have a feeling this weekend is gonna be absolutely boring. There's nothing going on at all and if there is then I'll probably be working during it. I kinda wanna head over to Easton to pick up a CD but I don't know if anyone else would be up for it. If anyone wants to hang or something then for fucks sake hit me up. Ah well, I should use this weekend as an opportunity to catch up on my studies even though I know that won't happen. Hopefully I'll end up doing more than sitting around like a useless piece of shit like my roommate does all day lol. Then again theres always Gundam models. Now that my MG Impulse is complete I suppose I should start my Overflag or finish up my Gouf Custom. Decisions, decisions...

"event","<lj-cut text=""this one is just all over the place"">I was afraid this weekend was gonna suck since everyone and their fucking cousin was out of town for it. Of course Halloween night was a bust since I had to work from 9pm to 1:30am. I didn't mind so much at first but when I went on a delivery run and saw everyone in their costumes heading out to parties (especially the incredibly hot girls in skanky ones) it started to annoy me. Moreover it reinforced how much I hate being single and not being part of the whole ""college in crowd."" 

I had to work Saturday as well but thankfully it was during the day so that left the night free. My one friend from freshman year who I hadn't seen in a while invited me over to a costume party at his place. I was hesitant at first since I thought it'd be awkward if I showed up by myself but Greg had nothing else to do that night and ended up going with me. We had to search for outfits first though. We searched used clothing shops on high street until we found the right stuff. He ended up going as the Great Gatsby and I was gonna go as a samurai but I realized that is way too me. It totally wouldn't have worked at a party anyways so I just grabbed my leather coat and sunglasses and went as a greaser. It was funny though since people kept trying to guess who exactly I was going as. I got everything from The Fonz to Christian Slater xD Obviously I agreed with each person's guess just because I was too lazy to explain that I was too lazy to actually model the outfit after anyone. I'm happy that no one thought I was Shia LeBeouf from the new Indiana Jones movie though >.>

The party itself was a blast. I saw all my old friends from freshman and thankfully didn't feel out of place once since Greg was there too. There weren't that many people at first but a bunch more showed up as the night went on. Thankfully I got enough beer before the kegs went dry lol. Oh yeah, and Bert and Erny beat Greg and me at beer pong lol.

Sunday I was supposed to hangout with Ingrid but my mom called and told me she was heading down for the day. That kinda killed my plans but I was happy since my mom was bringing down a lot of crap I had left home. 

Before I had to go to work I ended up seeing RocknRolla, the new Guy Ritchie film. It was similar to Snatch and Lock Stock since it featured the whole branching plot about British gangsters, yet it still felt different and somewhat more mature than his previous films. Jesus fucking christ I love his directional style. The scene where the Wild Bunch steals the money from the two Russian war criminals was flat out awesome. Goddamn that man knows how to use his montages. I'm sad the film only got a limited release though since more people need to see the damn thing!

Unfortunately work last night got in the way of writing my bio paper. It had to be 3 pages on intelligent design and evolution. Writing it was such a giant fucking bore. I knew all the points I had to make in it, it was just such a chore writing it since I didn't give a fuck about it at all. Re-reading it and editing was hard enough since I didn't even care about what all I had written. Whatever, it should get me at least a B so there's nothing to worry about.

My Japanese book finally came in the mail today! I can finally study for that class before I go to it lol. </lj-cut>

"event","Tuesday night I went with Ingrid to go see the Shiny Toy Guns concert at The Basement. You'd think by now I would have learned to always buy tickets in advance, especially with a venue like The Basement since it literally is just a basement. Of course things are never as easy as what we hope for...

<lj-cut text=""Wow, I actually wrote something more than 2 paragraphs this time x_x"">Ingrid's dad picked us up a little bit before 7 and dropped us off at the venue. Of course they didn't let anyone in until an hour after the posted time. Oh, and there was an ICP concert literally next door so that meant there was a line of fat metal kids with shitty face paint on. And I'm not exaggerating when I say they were all fat. Out of the 300 or so people that they let into the venue while we were waiting in line I could count the skinny kids in the crowd on both hands. It was a pretty stark contrast to all the anorexic scene kids waiting for STG. I'm pretty surprised a fight didn't break out or anything since some of those douchebags started throwing water and grape soda onto people in line. Definitely not a fun idea when its 36 degrees outside. I wanted to talk shit so badly to some of those assholes but I held back. Seeing the ICP fans though did show me that maybe, just maybe Jrock doesn't have the worst fanbase in the world...

I was under the impression that I'd buy my ticket inside the venue. It wasn't until after the line started moving that I saw a kiosk outside that was selling tickets for the ICP concert. I checked it out on the off chance that they handled the stuff for The Basement too. They did and they informed me that the show was sold out. Not exactly good news. Ingrid was almost inside the venue at this point so I run over and apologize about 80 times for being a dumb fuck and not buying tickets beforehand. She was smart and already had a ticket so she got in fine. 

I tried to find someone else that had an extra ticket but it was to no avail. I met up with a group of 5 other guys without tickets. They were a pretty cool bunch of guys even though it was obvious they were still in high school. We tried to think of a way to sneak in or something but nothing yielded results. After maybe 20 minutes or so they gave up and went home. I thought about calling a cab but decided I should see if Greg could pick me up instead. Literally right when I called him a kid came out of the venue and said ""Hey man, do you need a ticket?"" Of course I nonchalantly said yes even though in my head I was saying ""SKLGHLIWEJHILKSHahslkjglKLGSKDJ8ui4jEGdYESSSSHHHHHH!!!!!!!111111ONEONEELEVENTYONE"" He had to make sure his other friend wasn't gonna show up so we waited for about ten minutes and then he let me have it for $30. It was twice as much as it would have cost retail but I was just happy to get out of the cold and into the venue. Oh yeah, and right when I was about to give him the money 2 guys came over and were like ""How 'bout you sell that to a real fan? I'll give ya $40 for it."" Thankfully the kid was awesome and said he already told me I could have it so as soon as I paid him and got the ticket I ran straight down to the sanctity of the venue. 

The first band, The Delta Fiasco, was already halfway through their set. It was a shame that I missed their first few songs since they were pretty fucking awesome. Definitely my favorite act of the night. After them some other band I forget the name of went on. They weren't particularly entertaining since nothing they did really stood out in my mind. I pushed forward and tried to find Ingrid in the crowd. She was in the front row and there was pretty much no way I was getting there so I just chilled a few people back. 

After their set wrapped up the techies spent a good half hour setting up the equipment for STG. It was insane, they had four separate keyboards. Goddamn thats a lot of fucking synthing x_x The band came out and launched into their set once everything was tested and in place. 

I'm not a fan of STG since I never listened to them, but I did hear Richochet on their myspace and it was pretty catchy. Ingrid invited me to the concert so I agreed to going since I haven't seen her since colossalcon and it was an excuse to get away from the campus area for awhile (which I was incredibly thankful for). They put on a solid, energetic performance overall. Unfortunately I was feeling sorta sick by the end of their set, probably due to standing outside in the cold for so long with only a hoodie. Thankfully their main set lasted maybe a little longer than a half hour. 5 minutes later they did a 3 song encore and then left the stage for good. It was an entertaining show, but not being a fan and being in poor health made it less enjoyable for me. Still, I got to hangout with Ingrid for a night and it got me away from campus as well as my roommate so I guess thats all that matters. </lj-cut>"

Its locked and none of my fucking keys work. I tried calling my one friend who did his laundry there the other day but he didn't pick up. Fuck, my supply of boxer briefs are running critically low >.> 

This weekend ended up being even more dull than previous ones. James went home and everyone else I called didn't return my call. Oh yeah, and all my fucking roommate does is sit around and watch college sports and bitch about dumb shit all day. Jesus Christ he's the same as Shaun, only twice his weight. Goddammit I'm fucking sweet at picking roommates. 

I talked to Ralph yesterday and it sounds like he's in the same shape I am. He just sits around and does nothing all day too. Its sad that both of us actually look forward to work since there's nothing else to do. The last thing he needs to do is act like me though. Thats just not good for you.

The bad news? Well I suppose its only bad news for me, but its on November 19th, the same day as Dir en grey's Chicago show, the only stop on their US tour I planned on attending. This is so upsetting. I've wanted to meet ""The Man"" ever since I saw Army of Darkness way back when in middleschool. I could attempt to sell my Chicago ticket and go to the Michigan show the day before, but that'd require me having to drive my car all the way there when Ralph was just gonna give me a ride to Chicago and back. Plus I'm just straight up sick of going to Detroit for shows. It looks like meeting the king of b-movies will have to wait til some other time. 

In other news, I stumbled across this band called Austrian Death Machine. Its a solo project from As I Lay Dying's vocalist, Tim Lambesis. The whole band is based off Arnold Schwarzenegger and his movies. Its pretty fucking funny hearing death metal with someone impersonating Ahnuld's voice. Hmm, I kinda wanna go download some AILD and Family Force Five. Ugh, if I'm not careful I might actually start liking more American music again >.>

In case anyone gives a damn I'm taking Japanese 104, Econ 200 (microecon) and Bio 101 this quarter. None of those classes are math or chemistry so I'm not struggling on a daily basis to stay afloat in them. They sure as fuck don't warrant the price tag of tuition, but what the fuck else is new. 

<lj-cut text=""Jrock talk"">As far as Jrock goes I'm slowly starting to become obsessed with Deadman. I started listening to them because the guitarist for the studs, Aie, was in Deadman before they disbanded. You can really feel his influence in Deadman, even if it isn't quite the same thing. The majority of the songs I've listened to are the kind that don't stick in your head right away, but the more you listen to them the more you fall in love. Kinda like the studs >.> Their PVs are really fucking good for an indy band too. Additional Cause for Sorrow is by far my favorite *points to icon* Its pretty laid back compared to their other videos, but the imagery is by far my favorite. Their other videos are good too even if the vocalist, Mako, just spazzes around like a crazy Marilyn Manson reject in them. 

Speaking of the studs, their PV for Creepy Crawly just came out. I totally wasn't expecting a new video but I fully welcome it. I never really thought of them as a VK band until I saw some promo pics of the band for the new single. 
<a href=""http://imageshack.us""><img src=""http://img123.imageshack.us/img123/4097/studsfe3jq5.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Image Hosted by ImageShack.us""/></a>

Lately I've been on a giant Gazette kick too. I've been listening to them a lot and been falling in love with them all over agian. I'm gonna attribute this current fixation to watching their new concert DVD. I got a copy for like $25 from amazon.co.uk which makes me so happy since PSC charges way too fucking much for their DVDs. But yeah, its totally one of the best concert DVDs I've ever bought. I still can't bring myself to listen to most of their earlier mini albums since the recording sounds so unpolished compared to their recent live performances, but basically everything after (and including) Madara I fucking love. Sugar Pain and Carry are both terrible addictions. Disorder has to be my favorite album, followed by Stacked Rubbish. I know everyone loves Nil, and I do too but I can't call it my favorite just because it doesn't have any surprises like their other two albums. Their pretty much my favorite band ever right now.</lj-cut>

My whole job situation is pretty ambiguous since I haven't met with the one manager yet, but I honestly don't think its looking all that good. I'm probably gonna have to cut out pretty much all extraneous spending so I can have enough to just pay off my bills and make it to dir en grey Chicago. Thats it. Its gonna make for one hell of a boring Autumn quarter, but what else is new?

"event","I was supposed to move into my apartment today, but obviously that didn't work out. Between me being lazy and not being able to get out to the store to buy crap to pack stuff in I had to hold off until today to pack. I'm still not even that close to being done x_x For some reason I had it in my head that I needed to bring down everything I own to my new apartment, but thats just not how its gonna work. I don't have anywhere near enough time, space, or energy to do any of that. I tell myself that I'll be out the door and on the road by 10 am tomorrow but I know thats just not gonna happen. Things always have a way of happening that push back my original deadline by at least an hour or two. I'll be lucky to be out the door before noon. I did wait to the absolute last minute so I guess I really shouldn't complain >.> If I'm in my new place and am somewhat unpacked by 3 pm then I'll be happy. Packing up all my gundam models and supplies is gonna take fucking forever. Damn you gunpla for taking up so much of my life! I can't wait to get settled in and put all this moving crap behind me. 

After I found out there was no way I'd be making it down to c-bus today I found out there was some ridiculous black metal band playing at Peabodys tonight. I was gonna go to it with Ralph but then we realized neither of us had money. Plus getting my ass kicked all night at a metal show definitely would not have made packing any easier. Instead we were gonna go see Lakeview Terrace. Now I had no interest in seeing this movie on my own but thought it would actually be entertaining to see it with Ralph and just bullshit the whole time. Then we realized neither of us had money so we decided to just get food at a Chinese buffet instead. They had all you can eat shrimp tempura rolls so I fucking gorged myself on that like the fat kid I am. I got a bunch of other crap that was all pretty good. I even had a piece of apple pie which was strangely delicous for it being a ""chinese"" buffet. 

After we ate Ralph came over and decided to pillage my hard drive with his external. He took basically all my jrock plus a few good gigs of porn (a few read 20 or some). It was pretty funny because by the end of it all he was almost out of room on it.

I must've slept for 10 hours last night since I was so exhausted from work. I didn't wake up until 11 today. Sure, I did spend the day packing and helping out with a little yard work, but I'm already really fucking tired. Ugh, I need to will my body to get back to packing before I pass out. 

Minus all the ghey that came with having to pack, this day actually turned out to be pretty good."

"event","Well, I had to take my car back to the mechanic yesterday. It wasn't starting on the first try and it was making a lot more noise than usual when I drove it. Hopefully I don't have to get a new muffler. My starter should be under warranty since I got that shit fixed a few months ago, but we all know how mechanics like to suck the life out of you every chance they get. I fucking hate cars. I seriously do. This is probably gonna drain every last fucking penny in my account. God fucking dammit I hate bullshit expenses like this. 

I hear theres a place to donate plasma down in Akron. Apparently they give you $40 for each time you donate for the first four times. I think I might have to check that out >.> I wonder how much the sperm bank pays? I should look that shit up and see if there's one by me. Its a closeout sale on bodily fluids! Act now and get 35% off spinal fluid! EVERYTHING MUST GO!

I hate everything."

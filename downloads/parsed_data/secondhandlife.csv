well tessica. i got your post card , which made me extremely happy. but when i decided i wanted to write you back... I COULDNT. how  ome you didnt put a return address.. loser... but thank you so much i really liked it. i love you

i dont know how many times i said this.. but i love my room.

i miss marisa so much. i rented gone with the wind, because it reminded me of her... im too scared to call you because you might be out with your ""other"" friends... and nothing hurts more, than to call someone and them tell you they are out with other people and they will call you back.... because you know that meand that they are choosing the other people over you.

it doesnt seem like it has only been 3 weeks.  ive been gone for 3 weeks, but it seems so much longer when youre alone. 
im comming home.  seriously. im so lonely. i asked my brother to have a sleepover in my room tonight... he will sleep on the spare couch. i came to my senses later and regreted it. because its about time i spend time with my boyfriend BOB.  i havent seen him since i packed him.  so thank god my brother forgot and decided to watch DEXTERS LAB. or starfox advemtures,

lunch tomorrow with michelle and STEVE.  i cant wait to see what he looks like and what he is like. i think i might be working him up to be something greater than he is.... 

i hope we will be friends. =) i could use more.

one more month until i am 18. fuck yeah.  i dont know what i want to get yet. but on my 18th bithday my uncle is going to take me to get a tatoo. were getting one together.. not the same thing... because as cool as that would be... to share the same tatoo with my uncle....... but im not thinking the hawaiian islands... and i changed my mind on the whole kangi idea..  1. i cant spell it. 2. i would show everyone my tatoo , so that defeats the purpose.

so in a month i will have to decide on something i will want forever."

"event","so i just got done watching euro trip.  cool movie.
really. nothing is going on. 
i picked out the color for my room today and got the paint.
its a pale yellow. which i think shannon will appreciate. since yellow makes her happy and all.
yellow and blue are my favorite colors together.
must be because the yellow is the sunshine and the blue is the ocean... or atleast thats what marisa seems to think..
either way. i miss you.

i color organized my clothes. im really that bored.
my cat wont even lay down with me. i have to force him.and even then he wont stay on my bed for very long. there is always something cooler.. like a dust ball.... or a noise.

ok. have a great trip shannon. enjoy the hell out of your summer. i love you be safe okay?"

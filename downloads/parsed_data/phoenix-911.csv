But I can't sleep at night
Everything I think about
Makes me feel like a version of myself

They tell, their lies
And we all synchronize
Look to, the sky
Because it's almost over

We want, the truth
Give us the absolute
We need, your help
Cause we've got nothing

We want, the truth
Give us the absolute
We need, your help
Cause we've got nothing left to lose
I know, we've tried
This thing a million times
But put me out
Cause I'm on fire

Don't talk, if you
Are going to tell me the truth
Don't tell me you know
You've got everything under control

We can't have it all
But we can break the fall
This time I'm letting go
Cause I can't take it anymore

We want, the truth
Give us the absolute
We need, your help

"event","I have no clue what's going on right now. 

I try talking to her, but I only make wise cracks and act like a complete idiot who doesn't even know what ""Leave me alone."" means.

I try talking to her online and I can't even cut it. I still act dumb. 

I get nervous whenever I see her. I don't get a couple butterflies, I get more than I know what to do with.

Most of all, I miss her.

But I doubt I'm going to get a second chance. Either way, 'suppose I should move on. People are getting frustrated with me about it.

She knows I still like her and that probably doesn't help, though I find the word 'like' is too weak a word. 

The question I want to know the answer to more than anything is this: ""How the hell does she put up with me?""

Cheers,

"event","Man, been a few days since I updated this baby. XD

Yeah, hope y'all had an awesome Christmas or whatever the hell you celebrate so I don't offend you and be condemned to the dark depths of heck. I know I had a great time.

On Christmas Eve, I went over my dad's and got this stuff-

+ iPod Nano (W00T!)

+ Digital Camera (kinda sucks, though)

+ LAZER TAG!!! ZOMG!!!111

+ Light sabers XD

+ A bunch of Axe body products (are they trying to tell me something? >.<)

I loved the presents he gave me. 'Specially the Nano. I will cherish it forever. . .until it breaks or something. . .then I'll probably throw it away. XD Anyway, these are the ones my mommeh got me-

+ Nintendo DS!!!!! Yes, that's right, I wanted a DS, not a frickin' PSP. >.>

+ Nintendogs!!! lol, w00t w00t!

+ MASSIVE sketching kit. 

I made out pretty well this year, I believe.

Also, the reason I'm updating now is that I just woke up because I had to barf. v.v I did, in the toilet, so that's a good thing. I'm drinking Mt. Dew now so that probably isn't too smart, but it's all good. I think it might be because TwitCh hit me a couple times in the stomach area when we were sparring. . .but I did own his ass most of the time. XD Seriously. . .I did.

Anyway, g'morning and have a good rest of your life until I update this thing once more."

I love this band. They always put me into a good mood. Their music is more of an acquired taste, but I do love them. Very good. Take a listen."

"event","Yeah, I know I already said stuff today, but I honestly don't care. This is pretty much for advertisement, but it is definitely worth your while. 

Anyway, there is this online community that I LOVE to visit just about every minute of every day. >.< It's called ""G101 Design"". It's a great place to be. Like seriously. The place is basically for those who are interested in coding or graphic design. I've joined up because I'm into the whole design thing. 

The place is also good for just hanging out and conversing.

If you have no life, this is the place to not have it. ^_^

You can find the link in my profile.

Also, I'd like to share with you some of my graphics. I'm not usually very open about it, but I'd still like to show you because I'm going to be in the Scholastic Arts competition BECAUSE of my work. It makes me feel proud. But yeah, here are some quick things I've made-


<img src=""http://imageknockout.com/uploads/goplay196959.jpg"" />
With that one I took two photos and manipulated them. I took the kid from one picture and added it into that nice little background.

<img src=""http://imageknockout.com/uploads/sigbattle675507.jpg"" />
Just effing around with the effects on that one.

<img src=""http://imageknockout.com/uploads/gamesig62341.jpg"" />
I kinda like this one. . .

That's all for now. Hope you like my graphics. XD

Most people don't. I don't know why. They just aren't creative and are very naive and just ew. . .

"event","Yupyup, I got a new LJ. I kind of find them annoying as all heck, but TwitCh said that his relieves stress because he can go and get stuff off his chest, so I'm going to try that lil technique out for a while and see if I like it. =)

Well, not much has been happening as of late. . .except it's CHRISTMAS!!!! ZOMG!!!111!!!!1eleven!!!!!!1 

Yeah, I have no money, so I can't get you guys stuff. I'm sorry about that. Sort of. XD Not getting people gifts saves me the time and energy as well as cash (if I had any). So, I'm going to feel really guilty if people around the school give me things. I doubt they will. I don't have rich friends.

But yeah, EVERYONE is getting is getting on my case about this stupid computer. Garrett needs to get on so that he can go to FunnyJunk.com and watch those stupid as heck movies/games/pictures that he's seen 100 times over. It's so annoying. The whole time I've been using Photoshop, the program I'll be using when I get a career. 

I just got yelled at by my sister, too. It's sweet. No one around here likes me much. I do anything and my brother gets annoyed, I use anything electronic and my sister gets pissed off. I ask to get off the computer and apparently I turn into a jerk. Well, maybe it's because my brother tells me to get off EVERY 30 SECONDS. They both piss me off so much.

I can't wait until I have my iMac and I can just stay in my room the whole day and stay away from them. It'll probably save them the stress and anger and I'll be out of the way, so I believe that everyone wins.

Now, I'm out. I might hit stuff or something. I don't know. They just really pulled the trigger on me tonight.

Cheers.

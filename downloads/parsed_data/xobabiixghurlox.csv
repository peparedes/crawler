Don't worry.

Lets see..things that have happened since Daria dumped Jared.

-I think I'm still obsessed with Jared.
-There was a dance last Friday
-I slowdanced with Craig twice
-Everyone wanted Craig to ask me out.
-I slept over Megan's after the dance, went around Smithfield, Lincoln, and Attleboro, with her most of Saturday, then went to her half-sister, Hanah's, second birthday party. (Which was fun.)
-Craig barely talked to me this week.
-Amanda said she was going out with Derek. But then I find out Derek is going out with Krystal. (WTF?)
-Megan wants to dump Paul (ssshhh!!)
-Paul supposedly is 'obsessed' with Megan. (Or so she heard.)
-Ashley and her friends started to fight again. She sat with us at lunch. Was lots of fun.
-I want to change the name of my website to 'Animated Reality' (Take that idea and die bitches.)
-I got a 45/50 on one of my Math Quizzes, a 105 on my History Quiz, andddd a 4/4 on my ending paragraph to 'The Tell Tale Heart' 
- Today I bought things for my Shoe-box project for English, I worked on the CoverPage for Sarah's biography also for English, and I think I finished my Salem Witch Trial drawing. I just need to write like a 750 word thing to go with it or something like that. I also bought 'Shopoholic Takes Manhatten' since I finished my other Shopaholic book. =)

Yeah I think that's it.

Oh and Daria is like some 7th grade slut. I can't wait until he dumps her. It'll be one of the best moments of my life. It really will. And if you say that's mean. Try liking a guy for three years and then having them go out with someone younger than you. And get back to me on that."

especially with jackie. i mean thats all she does is pout and crap. but when we were in limited too..and omg it like pains to type this...she actually SHOPPED! and we spent $160 dollars there. on 4 pairs of jeans and 2 shirts.

which is totally stupid but i found jeans that fit me because im inbetween a size 12 and 14..xD so i can barely ever find anything that fits x_X

..so anyway..yeah in Rave Girl..there was this lady that talked to us for about an hour..got she scares people out of the store because she talks to much. she was telling my mother how my mom looks like a movie star and crap. and how she had 7 kids..and got re-married and shit.. ask yourself this before you speak ""do you really think that a married woman with two kids that are school shopping and just want to get it over with ACTUALLY want to talk about this crap?"" 

..hah i can answer that!

no.

So yeah. then at Rave Girl..they didn't take checks so my mom flipped out and started getting all angry and shit at me and Jackie, so she put the clothes on hold. And then as we were going down the elevator..to the second floor..when we thought we were going to the first to go back into the car..as we got off the elevator jackie stepped on my flip-flop and it felt like i stepped on glass. matter of fact it still feels like it now. then we went into sears..the clothes..just suck. i tried on a pair of jeans..that looked okay but i didn't buy them. Then we went into Limited Too, then  we went to Aeropostale..i liked a few shirts..but then Jackie expired and my mom didn't want to pay for lunch so we just left. 

My mom said she'll take me shopping when Jackie goes to school on the first.

"event","A Nemo Girl 03: i love sarah.
sarah is a banana worshipper.
If i were alone in a room with sarah, i would stick spaghetti up her nose.
i think sarah should grow another arm.
sarah needs 2 front teeth for christmas.
sarah will never fly to the planet mars and live the remainder of her life with a small colony of space gerbils.
i want to squish sarah.
When I think about sarah, i do an irish jig and pick my nose while singing the national anthem.
Someday sarah will have a pet bunny named sue.
sarah reminds me of a piece of limp broccoli.
Without sarah i would surely die of carbon monoxide inhalation.

A Nemo Girl 03: Memories of sarah are including the time we took a train ride to alaska and planted a tree.
sarah can be a typewriter missing the keys ""k"" & ""w"".
blah is how i describe meeting sarah.
Worst thing about sarah is confetti.
Best thing about sarah is arizona.
sarah licks me."

"event","omg last period was so awesome..while mrs. mailcan was outside talking to peepz we were writing things on the board like ""4 1/2 fingers"" and ""MYM krista <3 joe"" and also krista and joey are now going out!!! can you believe that? that's something i never saw coming...okay i think i still like WHO a little bit lmfao...yeah like 1 day of not thinking about him was well...different. really different. 

anyway at lunch me n megan went up to the food buying area and saw that there was like NOTHING literally...so we went to the ice cream machine with amanda and it wouldn't take our dollarz so we went up to the line again..got quarters..came back...waited in a long line..and finally we got our food lmao...so it was a pretty funny lunch time chelsea wasn't there...and lauren is still taking my seat >_< she's so evil now!!"

OMFG like get a clue!! but yeah...it's so weird not liking jared like not obsessing..or seeing him in the hallway it's just like..oh yeah whatever..it's like STRANGE! and everyone's reaction to ""i dont like jared anymore"" was like ""YOU DON'T?!!"" brian's was more shocked than it was when he found out i liked him back in september! it was sorta odd >_< but i think i still like him still like a lil bit but not as much... oh well lol...more latuhz..

"event","okay i'm like upset because caitlyn said that jared will never like me and he's just getting tired of it all...and now i just don't know if I should just give up..or continue..and if i continue i have to tell people i DON`T like him..and that`s going to be oh-so-hard...maybe i can tell a few people but i don't know..maybe i should jsut get over him..after all of this..i wished and hoped and dreamed that he'd like me the way i liked him and i guess it just didn't happen as well as i had planned...oh well...i don't really know what else to say now.. -tear-"

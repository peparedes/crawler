"event","so yeah i was just sitting at home thinking about the stuff i used to do last year. like what people i hung out with and what i did for fun and wow i've changed. this little flashback happened because a couple days ago i went to a movie with my ex-  and i dont really know why, but i did. in the process i kinda hurt some of the people around me and i got to thinking about why i dont hang out with nathan now, or even like adam and charlie. i guess i just grew up some. maybe? i'm not sure but i sure feel older, i do the stuff that i always said i wouldnt like go out to parties and lie to my parents about where i am...i usually dont do that unless i'm with emily, but it's happened. i'm not saying that it's all bad i guess, just that it's different. i mean why am i the way i am? why am i still the only one of my friends who has just been best friends with almost every guy in school? why do i seem to screw everything up between all my friends? its all confusing. i dont think its a bad thing maybe i'm wrong but i guess i have doubts about my friends sometimes, thats bad i know, but it seems like the ones i trust, or used to dont trust me as much as i do/did them. why is that? or why even do my friends all of a sudden when they get a g/f or b/f seem to leave me out of their life? i really want to find a guy to settle down with till graduation but it seems so hard, like who am i gonna find in this town? i mean like i thought whitney and sean would go on forever, she talked like it was going to last forever but then now it isnt. weird. and then emily and jason? what happened there? she said that she just fell head over heels for ben and she is talking about marriage! its not even been a year! this is ben's first serious relationship does he know what love is? then there are people like amber and robert who i think it will eventually work out in the end, maybe not, but it seems like it will. then there is carly and will...that well...it jsut confuses me sometimes so i dont even want to get started. and then there are my other single friends like drew and alex and i guess you could say amber and whitney too...but the guys...alex is just a guy that i can hang out with and not be worried about what people are saying more than anything. he doesnt listen to what others say and we just hang out care free with no intentions of anything. then there's drew, i used to like drew, he knew it, but now we are just really close we love to hang out and be random. thats just sorta what we do, but then he told me that we needed to stop hanging out b/c of sydney, she told him we were together too much and so he gave me the boot? i was confused and then i found out that he and syd aren't gonna be anything, but then he's all ""sammy likes me, we might hook up"" what do i say to that? honestly? why can't he just be single and my friend till i go to college and get the ""f"" out of this ding dang town? ambie, well we arent as close as she is with all the rest of the girls, but we still hang out sometimes and do random things...but then whit...wow i dont know what i would do without her...we seem to be there for each other when the other gets hurt and i dont know what i'm going to do without her next year if she goes to milikin. she was there when i bawled over stupid guys, i was there when she and sean broke up, and for some reason it helps she makes me feel good knowing that she is strong enough to go through that break up gives me hope for when it happens to me and garunteed she'll be the first one i call when it does happen. oh man i almost forgot about dan cox. where would i be without him, he keeps me in the loop of my own life it seems...he always knows what is up with my life when we dont see, talk, or hang out for months at a time...i dont know what i'll do without him either. guess next year will just be an expierence that i cant wait for...its something that i'll never be able to explain in this, 1. because i dont have the time to type it and 2. b/c i cant describe the feeling its great and scary and wonderful all at the same time with a hint of nerves, fear, and worry...what ever happens, i guess will be the right thing.

*Merry Christmas & Happy New Year*

"event","well i've decided that next year is basicly going to suck...emily is moving away to butler, my brother will be in chambana, whitney is going to be with sean all the time, and nathan well i dont know what to think about nathan. i guess i was counting on finding a good friend this year and keep him till next year, but that definetally didnt/isnt working. i really thought that i'd at least have nathan or maybe adam to hang out with, but that idea is totally gone. both of them are really mad at me, well least for sure nathan is, adam just likes to be mean to me so i'm not really sure. i always thought i'd at least have carly to hang out with but she's still head over heels for adam so that idea is completely gone too! and then i wish i didnt have morals so i could just find some random people to go party with but i'm not like that. i wish i was, i could go hang out with all the stoy boys and get trashed all the time with them this summer! but no of course not! maybe thats a good thing, right now its not...i feel so left out and i dont know why! i always thought i was liked among my peers, but recently i've felt other wise. i've thought about calling up mary, maybe we'll end up friends next year...i'll always have someone to hang out with at least. sure i might get arrested, but least i'd be having fun right? honestly i wouldnt care if i moved away for my senior year! especially to a big school, i could find a wide variety of friends, man it could be awesome! college is going to have to be awesome compared to this! least i sure hope so...well its late and i know this was short, but i just needed to get it out"

"event","alright well to finish from last night (i fell asleep that's why i couldnt finish it) anyways...i bout made myself sick b/c i couldnt stop thinking about what happened last night...so here's the run-down...1. there was a quadruple date (robert & amber, caleb &amy, lee & katie, and nate & carly) at amber's house and i was invited so it could've been 5 couples but i didnt want to go there with robert being there so i needed to find plans well emily was obviously with J.W. so all my buddies were out with their guys and i was stuck no plans well i got on to see if nathan was on and he wasnt but willie was so i asked him if he wanted to do soemthing and he said sure but first i wanted to see what was up with dustin so i tried calling him well the cell phones were being gay and the call wouldnt go through so i picked up willie we drove around for a bit and then decided we'd try and find dustin so i could talk to him, ya know see what was up...well he was at the bowling alley with his parents and patrick well we went in and talked for a bit but not about hwat i wanted to b/c i had never met his parents so i didnt want to be all serious my first time meeting them so we decided to leave ad he said he'd call me later and i was like ""okie dokie smokie"" (not really ;)) so we left went to wal*mart and bought cough drops and then went driving again and then called up nathan. he and nate aydt were hanging out and omg he sounds just like justin!! anywho...asked if he wanted to go steal stuff again and he was all for it cept nate didnt want to come b/c of willie well i had hot chocolate and was driving really crazy b/c i was hyper then after i hung up on him dustin called and said he and pat were at monicals so we went out there and i was drinking my hot chocolate again being all crazy when dusin got this call from some girl and willie thought it was allison and called her. well he was on the phone with her and erinn for like 20 min. and basicly invited them to come along with us to steal stuff. well i stayed inside (he went out side to talk to them) and talked with dustin and pat and they invited me to come over and watch a movie with them and i said ok...well then willie came back and was saying that we needed to go pick up the girls but i didnt know why then he told me that they were coming and i'm like ok i guess? well we left and were sitting in their driveway for like 20 min while they decided whether or not they were even going to come! well they were...so we then went to nathans to pick up him and his bro and take nate home. so i had a full car and we went off to steal stuff again! well we were there for about 45 min? mabye? and then we dropped the girls off and i took nathan and his bro home and after they got out they are like ""lets go get koale"" and iwas all confused then they told me that they were going to make a big snow ball and put it in his driveway so he couldnt get out. i was all EXCITED about doing it cept i had already told dustin and patrick i would come over so i couldnt go and i had to tell nathan i couldnt, b/c there it was...that feeling i wasnt ready to let go of creeping up on me again....so i dropped willie off b/c he had to be home by 11 and it was like 10:45 then i went to pat's...called my parents to see if i could stay out and wathc the whole movie and not be home in an hour and they agreed and i was happy! so i watched swordfish with patrick and dustin and they made fun of me, joking i know but still...then the movie got over and i went home by 1:00 when willie told me that he and nathan wanted to tlak to me but he wouldnt tell me about what then he got off and thats about the time i fell asleep last night...wow...i hate this, my life is so screwed up but thats about it

The Most Functional English Word

Well, it's s***...that's right, s***!s*** may just be the most functional word in the English language.

Consider:You can get s***-faced,Be s*** out of luck,or have s*** for brains.

With a little effort, you can get your s*** together,Find a place for your s***, Or be asked to s*** or get off the pot.

You can smoke s***,buy s***,sell s***,lose s***,find s***,forget s***,and tell others to eat s***.

Some people know their s***, while others can't tell the difference between s*** and Shineola.

There are lucky s***s,dumb s***s,crazy s***s,There is bull s***,horse s*** and chicken s***.

You can throw s***,sling s***,catch s***,shoot the s***,or duck when the s*** hits the fan.

You can give a s*** or serve s*** on a shingle.

You can find yourself in deep s***or be happier than a pig in s***.

Some days are colder than s***,some days are hotter than s***,and some days are just plain s***ty.

Some music sounds like s***,things can look like s***,and there are times when you feel like s***.

You can have too much s***,not enough s***,the right s***,the wrong s*** or a lot of weird s***.

You can carry s***,have a mountain of s***, or find yourself up s***s creek without a paddle. Sometimes everything you touch turns to s*** and other times you fall in a bucket of s*** and come out smelling like a rose.

When you stop to consider all the facts,it's the basic building block of the English language.

And remember, once you know your s***,you don't need to know anything else!

You could pass this along, if you give a s***.  Or not do so, If you don't give a s***! 

Well s***, it's time for me to go.  Just wanted you to know that I do Give A s*** and hope you had a nice day, without a bunch of s***.  But if you happened to catch a load of s*** from some s*** head........

Well, s*** happens!"

now to friday...it was our spring fling but this year it was county-wide, which wasnt that bad but not to many of the other school's students came...so it wasnt too bad but kinda a lil bit boring tara performed tho...and she's really good its just i dont really think her personality fits her music but i mean hey it sounds good and she'll probalby make some $$ so why not stick w/ it! then yesterday, sat., was yet another dance and wasnt really that bad b/c most of my boys came...but i feel really stupid b/c i'm supposedly really out-going but i cant even ask the guy i like to dance how sad is that!! yeah and its been on my mind all weekenda and i cant stop thinking about it!! then after the dance i hung out w/ him and his buds and that made it even worse...but i had fun so it was all good...umm i've got a track meet tomorrow so i think i'm gonna close this out.

"event","Well if you haven't heard what happened in our school today you're gonna find a lil out bout it today. It all started on Thur. when we didn't have school (actually kinda b4 that but the big stuff started here) so i'm bored and get online to talk to dan (if you didnt know thats the guy that liked me) and he was really mad b/c i hadnt talked to him all week and my friend and i hadnt sat w/ him at lunch anymore...which what is the big deal...its food! who cares where you sit!! so my friend and i sit w/ our other friends (sorry i'm getting tired of going around names so here they are) dan, BA, robert, carter, and logan. well dan (cox) doesnt like them and basicly he goes off on me and all my friends that sit at the table cept carter and logan...well my family had left to go to terre haute and i was alone crying at my computer with no one to talk to...i was crazy confused...so when my family got home i let my bro read what he had said...and he was furious b/c cox was saying crap about him and dan and ba...so the guys got this idea that they would go talk to him at lunch one day just to hear his side of the story...well i guess things got ugly and now everyone is talking about it...i wasnt there listening i was down at my table w/ all my friends just chatting away...of course we knew what was goin down but we were trying not to make it obvious...well anyway i get home tonite and its like 10:00 and i've got nothing to do so i get online (of course) and i just start to get on my icq and charlie sends me a message about why i told my brother and his friends to do what they did! but i dont see why he asked b/c i didnt!! that was totally their idea! well charlie wont listen to me and adam c. wont even talk to me...i know he hates me! he always does! so i'm there talking to one guy that doesnt have his story straight and trying to tell my side to another guy that wont talk back...then i start talking to adam a. and he understands that i wouldnt do something like that b/c i dont want to hurt cox i mean if i wanted that i'm sure he would've been hurt long before...but anyway he is telling me that its all ok and not to worry but to try and get the guys to back down...which i'm sure wont happen b/c today after they all got up and left cox started smiling which really made all the guys mad...then i heard today that he was saying he wasnt scared at all!! OMG!! he wanted me to apologize to all of them b/c he was SCARED of them!! yah thats the other thing...he wanted me to apologize to dan, whit, ba, and robert for him...i didnt quite get why but yeah?! i told him i wouldnt b/c that was his job but also that i forgave him its just i couldnt not forget what he said to me that morning...well anyway thats just about it...my life is a total mess and i dont know what to do...oh yeah the JIZZUMS (aka COMANDOS) won on sunday against the FAIRIES! it was a good game but i think both teams actually had fun this time and werent all serious like last time against the GONZOS

"event","Why does it seem that no matter how many times a guy says he undertands he never really does...he will flat out say yeah sure just friends or i understand your flirty we can be friends...why do they lie and expect us (the girls) to be the strong ones? we break down too...we have our problems and we are always tryin to help out our friends goin through the same shit even though neither one of us know what we are doin...its always hard for us and guys either dont get it or dont care...yeah you have some that are just too perfect aka sean, jacob, matt, adam...i think everyone knows at least two or three...i am lucky enough to know 4...they are just the ones that no matter what they say either they make you feel good or make you look completly stupid in a good way, just so you understand what you had done wrong...Back to the why...i mean honestly...if you dont understand just come out and say it we will try and explain again...and also once we say it we mean it...there usually arent the give it time i'll change my mind...our minds dont change its our hearts that have to change...so think of that next time...and after you've either broken our hearts or made us feel completely retarded all the time our hearts dont like that...we tend to go toward the nice, perfect guys that wont do that crap to us...just remember that sure its probably hard to understand that but read this a couple time more...maybe it will eventually sink in...maybe

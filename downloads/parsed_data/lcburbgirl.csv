You focus on what's in front of you (the foreground) and how that fits into the larger picture.  You are also particularly drawn towards the colors around you.  Because of the value you place on nature, you tend to find comfort in more subdued settings and find energy in solitude.  You like to deal directly with whatever comes your way without dealing with speculating possibilities or outcomes you can't control.  You are in tune with all that is around you and understand your life as part of a larger whole.  You are a down-to-earth person who enjoys going with the flow.</p>

"event","List seven songs you are into right now. No matter what the genre, whether they have words, or even if they're not any good, but they must be songs you're really enjoying now, shaping your spring. Post these instructions in your LJ along with your 7 songs.

1. ""Walking on a Thin Line"" by Huey Lewis and the News.  I am a social worker in a homelessness program, this song reminds me of my clients on Lancaster.  

2. ""When I'm Away From You"" Bellamy Brothers.  I have been kicking it old school lately and this reminds me of  ninth grade.  

3. ""Vacation"" by the Go-Gos.  I need a vacation.  Nuff said.

4.""Los vs. SPM"" by South Park Mexican.  I am never far away from an SPM CD.

5. ""Anyone Else But You"" by The Moldy Peaches.  Love the movie Juno and this song grew on me.

6. ""Touch of Grey"" - Grateful Dead.  This song makes me feel better.

7. ""Small Town"" John Mellancamp.  This song is so me."

For you, the holidays are about emotional connections and bonds. You are happiest being around those you love.

You celebrate the holidays in a minimalist style. You are likely to only give one great present and decorate your house with a few special items.

During the holidays, you feel magical. You love all of the decorations and how happy people are. You like to sit back and take it all in.

You think the holidays should be nostalgic and sweet. The holidays bring out your inner child.

Your favorite holiday memories strongly evoke your senses. You are vividly aware of all the tastes, smells, and sounds of the holidays.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdotheholidaysmeantoyouquiz/"">What Do the Holidays Mean to You?</a></div>"

A Very Simple Wish

i want to write an image
like a log-cabin quilt pattern
and stretch it across all the lonely 
people who just don't fit in
we might make a world
if i do that

i want to boil a stew 
with all the leftover folk
whose bodies are full
of empty lives
we might feed a world
if i do that

twice in our lives
we need direction
when we are young and innocent
when we are old and cynical
but since the old refused 
to discipline us
we now refuse 
to discipline them
which is a comtemptuous way
for us to respond 
to each other

i'm always surprised
that it's easier to stick
a gun in someone's face
or a knife in someone's back
than to touch skin to skin
anyone whom we like 

i should imagine if nature holds true
one day we will lose our hands
since we do no work nor make 
any love
if nature is true
we shall all lose our eyes
since we cannot even now distinguish 
the good from the evil

i should imagine we shall lose our souls
since we have so blatently put them up
for sale and glutted the marketplace
thereby depressing the price

i wonder why we don't love
not some people way on
the other side of the world with strange 
customs and habits
not some folk from whom we were sold
hundreds of years ago
but people who look like us
who think like us
who want to love us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why
don't we love them

i want to make a quilt 
of all the patches and find
one long strong pole
to lift it up

i've a mind to build
a whole new world

want to play"

I'm through with standing in line
To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be

(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me

(So what you need?)

I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet

(Been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and
James Dean is fine for me

(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

[Chorus:]
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free
(I'll have the quesadilla, ha, ha)
I'm gonna dress my ass
With the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to
Blow my money for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

[Chorus]

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna sing those songs
That offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser

I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

[Chorus]

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar"

I honestly was not expecting to have such a great time, but let me tell you, those Argentine acrobats are soooo mesmerizing, not to mention easy on the eyes.  There was this one guy who did this balancing thing and this other one who was doing this really cool trapeze like thing, but with these things that looked like bed sheets and he was suspended from the ceiling.  Wow... and guess who forgot her camera?  Me.  G and A enjoyed the animals and stuff.  I know, I know, circuses are so not p.c., but oh well... We had a blast and were thoroughly entertained:)"

So, it will be interesting to see how Hollywood spins her life story.  I am sure it won't be a box office thriller since all the not so literate masses want to see big budget media empire crap where stuff gets blown up and whatnot.  But, I digress.   One I am yet to read is ""Persuasion"", but I bought a copy last night at Hastings and cannot wait to immerse myself in it.  

I am finally going to watch ""Catch and Release.""  I am going to have my own movie marathon this weekend since it is supposed to rain again, ""Science of Sleep"" starring my man Gael (le sigh), ""The Messengers"", and some Deepak Chopra thing that looked interesting.  Have I mentioned that I loathe rainy weekends?"

DESCRIPTION:
(from VH1's web site) VH1 has a new scripted half-hour ensemble series, ""I Hate My 30's,"" an irreverent comedy about struggling with the end of prolonged adolescence while facing the realities and responsibilities of what happens when your 20's end and your 30's begin. VH1 has picked up 8 episodes of the series. Set in a non-descript office and hosted by Dr. Rod, the unflappable guide, who introduces each episode then comments on the events as the episode unfolds. This modern day Rod Steiger takes the viewer on a tour of widely identifiable cultural phenomenon -- your biological clock is ticking and you're running out of time or your dream of being a rock star is crushed by the weight of reality AND approaches them through the skewed (and occasionally ridiculous) perspective of our characters."

I hate to tell you this, but Im very, very happy
And I know thats not what youd expect from me at all
Im not the kind to smile and bow out gracefully
I always wanted to take it to the wall

But I found somebody with a heart as big as texas
I found an angel with the golden wings
She saw me down here in the dark somehow
And everything is different now

Yeah, I miss the old crowd sometimes
And the wild, wild nights of running
You know, a starving soul cant live like that for long
You go around in circles that just keep getting smaller
You wake up one morning and half your life is gone
I got so tired of that; I got so lonely
I dropped down and I called out to heaven
send me someone to love.
And heaven shot back, you get the love that you allow.
And everything is different now

Oh, and its sweet to know
The wisdom that living brings
Since I got a telegram from the God of simple things
She said, i dont care what you do for a living.
She said, i dont care what kind of car you drive.
all I want to know right now is what do you believe in
And what it means to you to be alive
Will you stand here in this fire with me? 
Are you ready for another life? 
So I bit that bullet and I took that vow
And everything is different now
Everything is different now"

The foundation, if not the cornerstone, of my existence is built upon all that I have suffered. As I will spend eternity from this day forward as a creature filled with pain. Too full of pride to complain.

It is hurtful to realize the truth, ""Sometimes life doesn't go as planned until you truly take the time to plan life. All things taken in hurt become all things begotten in strife. Existence and Destiny spin around one another in a seething yet effortless arc. If you spend too much time watching you shall become dizzy. Those times that you searched for the perfect someone... How many times were you talking to that someone perfect?

I have no idea who wrote this brilliant quote, but it was strange that I stumbled upon it at a time when I needed it.  Hmmm..."

Like with any other addiction, some had hit rock bottom and were ready and committed to change while others continued to gorge themselves.  It was definitely a good documentary.  It pulled you in, so much so, that you were rooting  for them to succeed.

"event","Here's a prime example of ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" offered by an English professor from the University of Colorado for an actual class assignment:  

 The professor told his class one day:  ""Today we will experiment with a new form called the tandem story. The process is simple. Each person will pair off with the person sitting to his or her immediate right. As homework tonight, one of you will write the first paragraph of a short story. You will e-mail your partner that paragraph and send another copy to me. The partner will read the first paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story and send it back, also sending another copy to me. The first person will then add a third paragraph, and so on back-and-forth. Remember to re-read what has been written each time in order to keep the story coherent. There is to be absolutely NO talking outside of the e-mails and anything you wish to say must be written in the e-mail. The story is over when both agree a conclusion has been reached.""  

The following was actually turned in by two of his English students.


Rebecca and Gary:

THE STORY: (first paragraph by Rebecca) At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted. The chamomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he liked chamomile. But she felt she must now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl. His possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again. So chamomile was out of
the question.

(second paragraph by Gary)

Meanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things to think about than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago. ""A. S. Harris to Geostation 17,"" he said into his transgalactic communicator. ""Polar orbit established. No sign of resistance so far..."" But before he could sign off a bluish particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo bay. The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across the cockpit.

(Rebecca)

He bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before he felt one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who had ever had feelings for him. Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4. ""Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel,"" Laurie read in her newspaper one morning. The news simultaneously excited her and bored her. She stared out the window, dreaming of her youth, when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree, with no newspaper to read, no television to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her. ""Why must one lose one's innocence to become a woman?"" she pondered wistfully.

(Gary)

Little did she know, but she had less than 10 seconds to live. Thousands of miles above the city, the Anu'udrian mothership launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles. The dimwitted wimpy peaceniks that pushed the Unilateral Aerospace disarmament Treaty through the congress had left Earth a defenseless target for the hostile alien empires that were determined to destroy the human race.  Within two Hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth, carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet. With No one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan. The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded. The President, in his top-secret mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion, which vaporized poor, stupid Laurie.

(Rebecca)

This is absurd. I refuse to continue this mockery of literature. My writing partner is a violent, chauvinistic semi-literate adolescent.

(Gary)

Yeah? Well, my writing partner is a self-centered tedious neurotic whose attempts at writing are the literary equivalent of pablum.  ""Oh, shall I have chamomile tea? Or shall I have some other sort of F-KING TEA??? Oh no, what am I to do? I'm such an air headed bimbo who reads too many Danielle Steele novels!""

(Rebecca)

As*h@le.

(Gary)

B*tch!

(Rebecca)

F**K YOU - YOU NEANDERTHAL!!

(Gary)

In your dreams, Ho. Go drink some tea.

(TEACHER)

A+ - I really liked this one."

I am so saddened and utterly in shock.  I learned so much from Frank Madla about Texas politics.  That 74th Legislative Session was one of the best times of my life.  I was introduced to the world of lobbyist, sentate committees, proposed legislation, bills, research, behind the scenes banter,  late night filibusters, and Rick Perry.  (he wasn't the governor back then, he was just the lowly commissioner of agriculture)  Frank was a brilliant and learned man.  The world and the state of Texas is poorer for his loss.

"event","This weekend I was watching VH1's ""One Hit Wonders"" and making the list was T'Pau.  They had a song in the 80s called ""Heart and Soul.""  I had totally forgotten that I used to love that song.  The lyrics are pretty...



SPOKEN:                                              SUNG:
Something in the moonlight catches my eye
The shadow of a lover goes dancing by
Looking for a little bit of love to grow,
so give me love, give me heart and soul.
You never let me cross the other side now
I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Hard on the heels of something more,
but I lost your love, heart and soul.

The tear in my heart as you walk on by.              More than an ocean
I feel so low and your head is high.
Everything you do convinces me more                  Keeps us apart
Please give me love, give me heart and soul
Looking to the day when I saw your face              I feel a tearing
Wasn't in the running, I wasn't in the race          in half of my heart
You moved in a way that I'd known before,
Now I want your love, heart and soul

Tired eyes, tears that dried                         Leaving you ain't easy now,
on the bed on the pillow where you told your lies    but loving you's the harder part
A turn of the key, my blood runs cold                You never want me for myself
Don't look back to hurt me more                      And I've needed you right from the

Everything you said was to the point                 very start
                                                     Oh won't you even try to...

CHORUS (sung):

Give a little bit of heart and soul
give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul
and don't you make me beg for more
Give a sign I need to know
a little bit of heart and soul

Walking on the water, walking on the air             A walk on the water, ooh,
That was the heart of the love we shared
Do you keep a secret left untold                     Is all that I need,
So you can't give love heart and soul?
I sued to have a lover with the midas touch,         But miracles are not happening.
I turned to gold but he turned to dust.
Left me for another, I turned to stone.
Now give me love, heart and soul.

Tired eyes, tears that dried                         Living in a fantasy,
On the bed on the pillow where the love has died     There's never any room to breathe.
A turn of the key through the door you go.           Hoping every waking hour
Don't look back to hurt me more.                     You'll turn around and say that we can start
Everything you said just said it all.
Can't you try to...                                  Oh won't you even try to...

CHORUS

Somehow, I lost my way
looking to see something in your eyes
but love will never compromise
Now this is the politics of life, yeah"

He's admitted his guilt, but his defense is that he was on alcohol and taking drugs so he doesn't remember doing it and he can't be held accountable beccause he was ""confused.""  So, instead of murder, they want ""reckless manslaughter.""  WTF??  Where the heck is the accountability??  He committed a horrible crime, but it's okay because he was drunk and high.  Okay.  Whatever.  He took the stand today and he absolutely disgusts me.  He answered the questions (which were gruesome) so matter of factly with no remorse.  It makes me sick.  

I hate when people don't have accountability... Let's hope those jurors see thru that lame ass defense."

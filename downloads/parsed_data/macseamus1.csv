So strange to be so numb, to be awake and aware of what is going on and yet they might as well have been working on the chair I was sitting in thanks to the effects of the novacaine.  It occurred to me later that I always begin my 8th grade art history class with a brief discussion on the word ""aesthetics"" and because most do not recognize  the word I point to ""anesthesia"" and what it means.  On the one side numbness.  On the other art, life."

Last time I had an IV and it was timeless, literally -- last thing I remembered was counting backwards from 100 and trying to make a joke that combined the drugs they were giving me and the Beatles music that was playing in the background.  I remember thinking I should explain and then they were waking me up.  Well, the IV is too expensive now.  So I'll go the conscious, but numb, route instead.  Thankfully, I have about half of my vicodin prescription left and I only have one class to teach that day at 345 pm.  Pray for me."

There is one 7-day emergency   dental office in town, but they didn't return my call right away.  So I went ahead and called the oral surgeon originally recommended to me who called me back from the annual statewide meeting of dentists and oral surgeons.  He said as far as he knew all 94 oral surgeons in the state were there so tough luck til monday.  I then called my dentist who placed two prescriptions for me at the pharmacy:  penicillin and vicodin.  Well, several horse pills later i feel just fine.  Hopefully, this will keep things tolerable until next week when I can get ol' #17 tooth taken out.

The dimensions of A4 are 8.26 X 11.69 inches (210x297 mm).  Compare that to vulgar cartridge paper at 8.5 X 11 inches.  The elegance of A4 is apparent without comparison with any other paper, but in comparison it's absolutely princely.  Please consider not using the ugly stuff. Switch to A4!

"event","Other than the Jesus prayer the prayer of St Ephraim is the one I'm most likely to pray.  I purchased a card with the prayer on it about a year or two ago at the Orthodox bookstore in town (alas, it closed this month) and have carried it in my jacket pocket ever since.  I often read from the card before mass or after communion.  It sums up my petitions.  It speaks what my heart wants, but is never articulate enough to say.  I was not aware of the degree to which it forms Orthodox prayer during Lent. 
 Today I read an interesting analysis of the prayer in its greek form here (http://bekkos.wordpress.com/2008/03/31/the-prayer-of-st-ephraim-the-syrian/).  The author of the post concludes with a brief reflection on the danger of understanding Christianity as being identical with the moral law and how St Ephraim's prayer helps to guide us toward the real thing."

Here is some Chesterton for your post Palm Sunday reading:

The Donkey

When fishes flew and forests walked 
And figs grew upon thorn, 
Some moment when the moon was blood 
Then surely I was born; 

With monstrous head and sickening cry 
And ears like errant wings, 
The devil's walking parody 
On all four-footed things. 

The tattered outlaw of the earth, 
Of ancient crooked will; 
Starve, scourge, deride me: I am dumb, 
I keep my secret still. 

Fools! For I also had my hour; 
One far fierce hour and sweet: 
There was a shout about my ears, 
And palms before my feet.


This reminds me of the great film Au Hasard Balthazar, by Bresson.  It might inspire proper penitential thoughts.  http://imdb.com/title/tt0060138/ -- but seriously, it's a film worth watching.

Also, there is a copy of the address given by Fr Heller subsequent to his winning the Templeton prize over at First Things (http://www.firstthings.com/)."

"event","Do you know about Mars Hill Audio?  I gather it is a subscription service that allows you to download a periodic journal that is comprised of audio lectures and interviews.  There is a collection of FREE mp3s available here:  http://www.marshillaudio.org/cdbonus/default.asp and there is a complete sample issue for download here:  http://www.marshillaudio.org/resources/mp3/MHA-Journal-Special.zip.  The most recent free download is Diana Pavlac Glyer, on Owen Barfield; and Michael J. Lewis, on the meaning of the body in Western Art.  The interviews are fairly brief, so nothing in depth, but enjoyable.  I listened to several while I was painting yesterday."

"event","Haven't posted much lately.  Not feeling very talkative or especially bright lately.

Going through some old papers I found this poem by Mark Strand that I always liked.  Reading it again I found myself not liking it as much.  I liked the zen flavor of the poem, the positive and negative spaces that are invoked with himself being the negative space.  But there is too much ""I"" in the poem for that to really work, it seems.   

Keeping Things Whole 

In a field 
I am the absence 
of field. 
This is 
always the case. 
Wherever I am 
I am what is missing. 

When I walk 
I part the air 
and always 
the air moves in 
to fill the spaces 
where my body's been. 

We all have reasons 
for moving. 
I move 
to keep things whole. 


- Mark Strand

What else?  Have met twice with the local Communion and Liberation (CL) School of Community (SOC).  On the one hand it seems like a group of fine folks who I would benefit from knowing.  They seem like generous and humble spirits.  On the other hand, the discussions (centered on the writings of Father Giussani) have been tedious.  I say this as someone who dearly loves digression and tangent (I mean if all you got out of a conversation was information what's the use?), but you have to return to the text from time to time otherwise your truly begins to feel like he has become trapped in an absurdist play.  I like CL, but there seems to be a lot of lingo and I still don't entirely comprehend their school of thought.

We are entertaining moving back to the midwest.  A friend recently told us she was moving back to Indiana (I'm from Ohio) and this got my wife interested in the idea and suddenly she's emailing house listings from Indianapolis.  Then her interest shifted to Cincinnati, which for some reason I have never liked.  But now that spring is evident here I expect the ardour to cool somewhat.  Still, you can get a lot of home for cheap back there.

Am going to begin a new icon of Christ healing the blind man because I feel blind so often.  

Have joined a gardening group and will have the first meeting next Sunday.  In exchange for working in someone else's yard you get one or two sessions with a group of folks in your yard.  I'm the only guy -- the brawn, as I have been called (for the first time in my life), but that just goes to show that it's a relative term.  Anyway, I'll be making the ladies dig up the juniper bushes in my front yard (I have got a mean streak a mile wide)."

"event","I just found out that George MacDonald Fraser died January 2.  If you haven't heard of him you can read about his books here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_MacDonald_Fraser).  The wikipedia entry isn't that informative.  He was a screenwriter as well as a novelist.  One set of novels, the Flashman series, is the one I am familiar with.  The novels are historical fiction.  Flashman is a cad and a Zelig-like figure who appears here and there in the 19th century world, both in Brittania and out, stumbling, lying, and cheating his way to fame (for example, he is credited with bravery for initiating the charge of the light brigade when actually he, suffering flatulence, was stuck riding backwards in his saddle and couldn't control his bolting horse).  In every way he is an extremely dislikable fellow except that he is utterly truthful in recounting the facts on which his unmerited fame is based (the books are written as if from discovered manuscripts that his family would rather have suppressed).  One or two movies were made with malcolm mcdowell as flashman and that didn't strike me as an apt casting.  Anyway, I'm sorry to learn that there will be no more Flashman books."

Near the Wall of a House

by Yehuda Amichai

Near the wall of a house painted
to look like stone,
I saw visions of God.

A sleepless night that gives others a headache
gave me flowers
opening beautifully inside my brain.

And he who was lost like a dog
will be found like a human being
and brought back home again.

Love is not the last room: there are others
after it, the whole length of the corridor
that has no end."

It sometimes takes me a long time to make decisions about insignificant things.  Too many examples to list, but use your imagination and you're probably not far off.  Anyway, I made a spur of the moment decision to fly back to OH to see my high school buddies.  There is a surprise birthday for two of them and out of the blue the organizer of the party, my best friend from high school, called to see if I would be in town for the holidays.  We haven't spoken in about 8 or 9 years.  I mentioned it to my wife and said wouldn't it be nice and then forgot about it all.  Later she calls up and says she has found a Priceline ticket real cheap and do I want to go.  Again, not good at fast decisions, but somehow I said yes and so tomorrow I'm gone.  For a couple of hours afterwards I actually felt kind of depressed.  I thought maybe it was the money.  Or maybe I wouldn't know those guys anymore.  Then I realized that I just don't like making decisions on the spur of the moment.  Yeesh.  Somehow the beer made those feelings go away (Arrogant Bastard Ale by Stone Brewing works like a charm).  See, proof God wants us to be happy (unless you're German in which case it makes you want to conquer Poland).

I have been working on an icon of Christ.  It has been a long process, but chop wood carry water you know.  So here's what I've done so far:  carved the icon board with a recess into a solid piece of quartersawn fir (not ideal wood), cut long dovetails across the grain on the back of the board and inserted oak braces, two coats of rabbit skin glue, one layer of muslin, multiple layers of traditional chalk gesso, sanded and scraped the surface until ivory smooth (I usually don't want to paint on these because they're so beautiful at this point), drew the intended image, applied traditional bole in multiple layers where the gold leaf will go, applied gold leaf and burnished it with an agate (not perfect, but it kind of has an antiquey look -- it's real gold leaf by the way and it makes a difference over that fake stuff you get at art supply stores), applied the skin undertone (sankir), and painted the skin of the face and hands, screwed it up royally and scraped it all off with a razor blade and did it all again; have begun the hair, maroon undergarment, and blue robe.  At this point, I must say, I am happy with the results.  I don't quite understand the system for rendering the garments, but I'm going with the flow.  It's probably good that I'm leaving town for several days or I'd be tempted to go at it some more when I need to step back and assess and plot my next move.  

Simultaneously, I am working on my own artwork -- a painting for a group show at the gallery in Feb.  It's touch and go whether I can get it done (see! I shouldn't be going on this stupid trip -- this is why I have to take so much time making decisions!), but so far so good.  I painted in some english laurel leaves, but I made them darker and shinier than they are and I like the way it looks very much.  The painting shows a woman sticking her hand into some water while a catfish comes up for some air.  Right now the catfish looks like a small shark so gotta fix that.

Last, I found in my pocket something I copied down while reading Hauerwas.  From a chapter called Sinsick in a book whose title I'm too lazy to get just now:  

""the project of modernity has been to produce people who believe they should have no other story other than the story they choose when they have no story.  Of course what such a story cannot explain is how that story became our story.  In short, modernity names those social orders in which freedom becomes our fate....As a result, we suffer from those forms of life we believe necessary to make us free.  We desire to be free from illness, and illness is now understood as any condition that limits my choices.""

Well, that's it then.  I'm happy on planes, but nervous ahead of time.  Pray for me.

Sean"

It is a part of Slate.com and don't recall how I stumbled on it (sorry if I saw it on one of your journals and forgot).  There is an interview with John Polkinghorne, Msgr. Albacete, Karen Armstrong, Huston Smith, etc.  I'm kind of a fan of Albacete, so it was nice to listen to him.  Also watched excerpts from the Armstrong interview.  She's a little overwrought for my taste.  I was intrigued by something she said.  Well, not intrigued.  She said that the Orthodox churches had a more Buddhist Jesus, a more Buddhist christianity.  There's something sort of pandering sounding about that -- as if her audience consisted of college kids or Unitarians.  But anyway, what might she mean by that?"

This calls to mind Milton Avery, an early favorite of mine, perhaps doing a piece about Odysseus at rosy fingered dawn.

A Susan Rothenberg maybe?

today my sixth grade art class is silent as they complete their artworks based on the golden section.  on my computer some internet radio station is playing what sounds like bach, now something choral sounding vaguely russian.  the students are absorbed in their work and being careful and purposeful in their work, my hearts delight.  I happened to glance at the hand of one young student as she filled in the corner of a part of her work with red paint and noticed the competent handling of the brush and the deft way she filled in the space and how her entire posture showed her intention towards her work.  I suddenly feel intensely happy."

"event","From last year.  This painting was to be the last image in a series of paintings based on a quote from Chesterton's Father Brown (which Waugh famously made use of in ""Brideshead Revisited):  ""I caught him, with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough to let him wander to the ends of the world, and still to bring him back with a twitch upon the thread.""
I didn't intend so much to illustrate the quote as to suggest moments in the life of a person undergoing conversion.  Above the figure in this image is the foliage of the forest.  To the above left is a dead branch and to the right of that a live branch.  Get it!  Well, so much for the mystery of making paintings.  There's more to it than that, of course...but it's no fun laying it all out.  I repainted the frame to nearly black after it had been in the gallery some weeks. and it looks better.

"event","Looking at Nativity images I came across a number that I like and I thought I'd post them here.  Those northern european ones are probably most compelling to me.  Here are Bouts, Chagall, Gaugin, della Francesca, and van der Goes.

I went through a della Francesca phase in college.  His vision seemed to me to be ambivalent -- as in ambi-valent -- and that seemed about right to me.

"event","My 6th and 8th graders have been experimenting with the golden section (1:1.618) in compositions.  The goal was to have the students make thoughtful use of that ratio -- someway, somehow, they had to use it in a work of art.  I tend to work alongside the students and make my own experiments.  It's fun for me and it helps them to understand what I'm asking for.  Anyway, I'll show you three of mine and then one (the uncolored one) by one of the 6th graders which is better than mine.  I found that to be kind of funny and that's why I'm posting them.  Here they are:

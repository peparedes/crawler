Ill be getting a pass for big white next year for sure. <BR><BR>I was amazed at how good things were looking. <BR>But of course, things began to fall down again, as usual. <BR><BR>It seems Jessie (My sister) had a allergy overload, and had to go to the hospital<BR>they don't know what's wrong with her, or why she suddenly bloated up. <BR>But the swelling just wont go down. <BR>She phoned me a few moments ago..i could barely hear her. But she just wanted to show me she could still talk.<BR>Id never admit it, but im so proud of her, and my brother trevor. <BR>They do act alot like me, like the strength they have and loyalty. <BR>But they're so much better off, and thats what i admire. <BR>So i really hope ill be able to get up there, see them again. <BR><BR>I feel so...conflicted. <BR>I don't know what to do anymore. <BR>Its like i've been split in two<BR>One wants it this way, and the other that. <BR>Its allmost as if my older and younger self have become different beings, and both try to rule my soul. <BR>I don't know who to side with or let win. <BR>I could go back to the way i was before, the small child who desperately wants to fit in, be loved, and has someone there for her. <BR>On the other hand<BR>To be mature<BR>To have ideas and aspects to share with the world..to be able to move on indepentantly. <BR>All of this i would love<BR>But i know i could never have both. <BR>I've tried before. <BR><BR>Im really liking the song ""You are the one"" By Whyte shadows. <BR>I've never heard of her before, but the piano and her voice are simply breathtaking. <BR><BR>There's not too much else to bitch about. <BR>The scars are still present. <BR>I think this time they're there to stay. <BR>There is about 3 that are fairly visible. <BR>Lucky me huh?<BR><BR>Oh well. <BR>Later days</FONT>"

Not them. <BR>They're so kind and caring...and they mean so much to me. <BR>How could they be at fault...for being much too kind for me? <BR>No..<BR>I didn't think so. <BR><BR>It sucks...i didn't think the scars on my wrist would still be around. I didn't mean to press that hard..but i guess i was in too much rage to notice. <BR>Added a few more...but ill be sure to cover then this time. <BR>I know i promised...<BR>but&nbsp;what&nbsp;do they care anyways. <BR>They're going to be mad at me anyways, so what's the use. <BR>I really wish my grandma was here...god...she would know what to do. <BR>I long to see the lights on next door where she lived, just to wake up and see this was all just a bad dream, that she was still here. <BR>But i wouldn't ask her to&nbsp;return, not to the way she was. <BR>She used to be tall, strong, independant<BR>and then from cancer she was reduced to such a tiny woman, frail, swollen limbs...just a empty body on which her&nbsp;soul had&nbsp;left.<BR>I wouldn't ask her to come back to that in a million years<BR>No matter how bad i suffered<BR>She was in way too much pain...now she's free. And thats good enough for me.&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;It seems that my ex-boyfriend chris might have a girlfriend allready, and im very happy for him. <BR>It'll be good that he sees someone else and have a good time with her, sure, we had fun too, and ill never forget it<BR>But i did nothing for him. <BR>Allways worrying, allways suffering..i guess distant relationships just didn't work out for me in the end. <BR>I feel bad for putting him through all that shit...but it only would have gotten worse in time<BR>Because day after day i seem to just get more fucked up as is. <BR>No need to bring others down with me. <BR><BR>Jon...i don't know what to say. You told me to stop saying sorry...but I can't. I seem to just keep abusing the kindness you give me..<BR>I just seem to fuck that up as well.<BR>god...i can't take much more of me bringing people down...its too hard to see them suffer from a stupid reason like me...<BR>Soon enough i can go wallow in the depths of hell where i belong...&nbsp;</FONT>"

"event","<P><FONT size=1>Wow...so what's new. <BR>Well, <BR>I have my first Exam tomorrow, and frankly, im down right stressed/panic/anything along those lines. <BR>Its my English written, then on thursday i have Biology and french Exams, followed on friday by English question and Math. <BR>La de da...kill me now..<BR><BR>I know im going to do horrible...this sucks. I suck at tests period. Oh, and more great news, i have a appointment next tuesday i believe to see if i have to get my wisdom teeth pulled out. Joy. And soon i should get some of my moles removed, last time i burst into tears because i was too scared to go through with it. Sad huh? I don't know why, im just too terrified of cutting/ stitches. Even though i have cut myself before, quite frequently when i did *coughs* but not lately i havn't <BR><BR>Oh! I nearly forgot, more Joy in my life, megan hates me or so it seems. I have been hinted that she blames herself, but doesn't the other person have to hate you for you to blame yourself? I'm not sure. I guess it's because i don't show my feelings like others do. All when i was growing up i was always alone, either in my room or outside. I never interacted with children unless i knew them, like jenna. i didn't talk to anyone else untill grade 4 when i had to since jenna wasn't in my class. I've allways kept my emotions inside, hid behind this mask of care-free happiness. I dunno...emotions to me is a sign of weakness, and i've been hurt too much in my life, so that weak little girl i used to be; the one who cried, the one who was emotional, the one who trusted everyone, i buried deep inside.<BR>I had to shelter that little girl from the harsh reality. <BR>She wouldn't have survived past grade 6. <BR>So i grew into who i am today, the cold woman/girl who puts on a mask of happiness when she wakes up, who goes about her day fooling the people around her, who think nothing's wrong, they arn't even aware that about 95% of the time i am really deep in depression. Alas, thats not who they want me to be. They need a listener, a shoulder, a cold slate of stone to carve their problems into and then hide it so no one else is able to see. To every friend i have, i've had to become what they needed of me, its how i have been regarded as 'Such a valuable friend' because i rarely ever tell anyone's secrets unless i was given permission. <BR>I could be wrong, but it just seems like no one is interested in how i am. They ask, but they don't care. Of course, i'm allways fine. Thats what i allways say, because of my mask, thats all i can feel. I've been called 'real' too. But how can someone be real when all they&nbsp;are fake? True self never shown? I don't get it. I don't think i will either. &nbsp;<BR>There has been only but 2 who has discovered some hidden things about me. <BR>Well...one now. <BR>My grandma passed on, the one relative who actually knew who i was inside, not my mask. <BR>Oh great, here comes the tears. <BR>Fuck. <BR>It hurts so much...even the thought of her alone brings me to tears, that little girl who misses her grandma emerging for a few moment. <BR>I hate crying, its the ultimate weakness, and yet, nearly every night im reduced to this weakness untill my tears lull me to sleep.<BR>Of course, this is all inside. <BR>I would never inform anyone of my pains, i wouldn't want to suck them down to hell with me. Im independant that way, <BR>If its my problem, i'll fix it. &nbsp;<BR>I wish i could just kill that little girl, then i would just be a empty shell, uncaring and without those painful childhood memories. <BR>Well one thing i know, that i am in love with this song, it describes everything that i am. Its 'Bother' by Stone sour<BR><BR>Wish I was too dead to cry<BR>My self-affliction fades<BR>Stones to throw at my creator<BR>Masochists to which I cater<BR>You don't need to bother;<BR>I don't need to be <BR>I'll keep slipping farther<BR>But once I hold on,<BR>I won't let go 'til it bleeds<BR><BR>Wish I was too dead to care<BR>If indeed I cared at all<BR>Never had a voice to protest<BR>So you fed me shit to digest<BR>I wish I had a reason;<BR>my flaws are open season<BR>For this, I gave up trying<BR>One good turn deserves my dying<BR><BR>You don't need to bother;<BR>I don't need to be<BR>I'll keep slipping farther<BR>But once I hold on,<BR>I won't let go 'til it bleeds<BR><BR>Wish I'd died instead of lived<BR>A zombie hides my face<BR>Shell forgotten<BR>with its memories<BR>Diaries left<BR>with cryptic entries<BR><BR>And you don't need to bother;<BR>I don't need to be<BR>I'll keep slipping farther<BR>But once I hold on,<BR>I won't let go 'til it bleeds<BR><BR>You don't need to bother;<BR>I don't need to be<BR>I'll keep slipping farther<BR>But once I hold on...<BR>I'll never live down my deceit<BR><BR></FONT><FONT size=1>Im so messed up.

I don't think i've ever been this so in my entire life. Well...maybe not..i was a year or so back when my dad's&nbsp;father (my grandpa)&nbsp;and my greatgrandma died in the same week, and when my mom's mother (my very special grandma) died back in october.&nbsp; Then i was stressed as i am now, but this time it isn't over a death.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>I'll probably be staring my job at Gormans soon (local wood mill) for a weekend cleanup duty. Normally i would detest, but its only on the weekend for like 5am-2pm. And for $16 a hour thats pretty danm good. So im going to be stressed and tired. woo. </FONT></P>

Ones of which i have not figured out yet.<BR><BR>I would love to listen to some new music...but our&nbsp;soundcard for the comp is busted..has been for nearly a month now. I want to listen to muuuusssiiiccc...i have so many i want to download..expecially 'Drown in my Love'&nbsp;by HIM. I love that song with a passion. <BR><BR>I have to finish my Math review..which was due yesterday, aswell as finish the test i took yesterday. Maybe then ill pass, but i highly dought it&nbsp; I did good on my english Macbeth Act I booklet, 105/115, highest mark yet. I wish i could get that kind of marks on tests -_-;; But then again thats just how scewed i am.

<P><FONT size=1>Fun no? <BR>I'm so tired, my brain hurts and my hand hurts. <BR>I can't stop because its all due tomorrow. Ill have to skip Math because i just wont have time. <BR>and of course im being dragged to the Jan Arden concert with my mom. Joy. It starts at 8pm tomorrow&nbsp;and with my luck it'll take a hour to get there <BR>because of all the snow and ice on the roads so ill have to leave at 7 and miss my computer time *le sigh*<BR>It'll probably go till 12-1am and i wont be getting to bed till at least 1am or so. <BR>Thank god it will be friday after that...i need some sleep, badly. <BR>And i havn't been getting good sleeps as it is, my spine hurts so much and it keeps me up most of the night. <BR>Only 20 more days till next semester where i have:<BR>Beginners Japanese 11<BR>Socials Honours<BR>Art 12<BR>Foods 12<BR><BR>Basically its going to be sooo easy! I can't wait. <BR>and then, it will be only a year and a half before im out of school and out of this hell hole. Im planning to go to either UBC in vancouver if im accepted (very unlikely, but worth a shot anyways) if not ill move up to my dad's in Prince george and take the college up there for a year then transfer over to UBC, or go to the college in Kamloops and dorm with Jenna and Amanda who i believe want to go there, and transfer to UBC. Of course im going to take a very much anticipated trip on the grad summer, so that will make the rest of the year just great ^__^</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Wow, its only about a month and a bit untill the Bamfeild trip, im quite excited, going to get away for a weekend and be in my true home town, Vancouver. I dunno...i love the big city...the countryside is ok..but i would&nbsp;get too lonely being the only person for 4km =P But overall i want to go to Japan, cause there city or countryside wouldn't matter to me...everything is so beautiful there anyways *sighs softly, wolfin ears drooping to the side* but thats a forgotten dream..ill probably end up staying here on this contenent all my life. but i will make a effort to at least take a vacation over there ^^ so i'll be ok that way.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Oh my gosh, it was adorable, today there was a mother talking with another about their babies, and they were all bundled up in such adorable outfits! I was ready to start swooning on the bus but caught myself and descided against it. I don't know why but all of a sudden im seeing so many things to do with babies! I thought i would never want a baby, but now im starting to reconsider. I would love to have a child, I would name the boy Vaun. I absolutely love that name. Its strong, but soft in a way. I just know i wouldn't want to name it a normal name like John or Tyler or something like that, im all for the uniquness. Definately want to get away from the 'Smith' thing -_-;; Im even starting to warm up to a baby girl even, still want a boy overall, but a girl wouldn't be -so- bad. Maybe name her something like..hehe. Mariiah. Such a pretty girl's name. But i dunno...it would depend on what the father would want the kid to be named, cause it might have to be something else. But i would definately wait till im older...20 at -least-, and that would even depend if i had a steady job and a secure place to live.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>heh, it's funny how a year or two can change a opinion about something ^^&nbsp;<BR>well enough ranting, i better get to my homework or ill never finish. </FONT></P>

Luckily i was wearing new jamies (Silk cargo like bottoms and a tanktop) so i wasn't about to venture out into the cold to kill them.

<P><FONT size=1>Well, my hand hurts, ive been drawing -all- day. Drew 5 pictures, more then i've done in two months xD Mostly Inu-Yasha, from my wide collection of Manga's on that anime ^__^ Some which were rather good, but im kinda pissed as i don't know the name to a really cute demon in Koga's Demon wolf clan.

<P><FONT size=1>Hmm...seems like my dad and Uncle darren are playing their guitars, they're country boy's...so thats all you'd ever hear from them.

When i get home too, my mom said i was about ready to rive by myself there too, just maybe one more time to see how im doing on a standard (i drive a automatic here, so its so much easier) I'll have to learn quickly if i start my job soon, since i have to go at 5:30 am on saturdays, but im not sure what days i work, could br friday night, sat morning, or sunday morning.

<P><FONT size=1>So we were sitting there and being bored while the awarded the Senior Boys Volleyball team their medals (they on the provincial championships last weekend). Then my back hurt and i wanted to talk to Julia who sitting on the other side of joel so i moved behind him and talked to her. For once im glad i have boney shins because when&nbsp;he went to lay back on my lap i guess they&nbsp;dug into his back..so ha on that lazy bum :P so then i talked with julia and the assembly was over, but on the whole way back he clung to my coat (its all really soft fake suade and furry around the arms and bottom and in the inside and hood) so all the way down the hall he was clinging onto me so that was kinda funny. Ahh well. kept me warm.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Biology was uneventful. Ate Nuts and Bolts with Julia while watching a movie on Algae. Thats all we did and then class was over.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Math...we got icecream! It was only a little cup but oh well. icecream is icecream. And i even got a second one because the teacher miscounted and we had a tournament to see who would get it by playing 'Rock, Paper, scissors' and I won xD But we also started advanced trigonometry so that wasn't good &gt;.&lt;;;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Then came English. Mrs. Daniels is hillarious. She loves Shakespear and allways calls him 'Shakey-poo', but i am more excited for tomorrow, when Sex Ed starts xD yes...its one of my fave units, allthough its odd that it's taught during english classes this year..but it must be because everyone has to have a English 12 to graduate, so its a course everyone is taking. I dunno, i enjoy learning about that stuff, im not a porn addict, i just like knowledge and its a interesting subject because it <STRONG><EM>is </EM></STRONG>something that will happen.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Hmm...lately i've been having quite a bit of energy. It must be because im taking my Birth controll pills at the same time everyday now instead of whenever i remember to take them (which isn't very often ^^;;). But im not taking the pills to prevent babies..its for length controll of my monthly visitor..it was quite long -_-;; heh. But i guess it is a added bonus :P</FONT></P>

"event","<FONT size=1>Today we disected a rat.
It was -awesome-.
Me and Julia named ours Tinkerbell, even though it was a guy. Someone took Squeakers (the rat we had on monday, we just drew the outside body) before we could get there ;__;
Other then that Biology was cool, allthough i have quite a bit of homework there.
French was ok. I forgot a project that was due at home..so ill have to hand that in tomorrow. 
Math...had a test. didn't know what the hell i was doing. All this taxes and morgages...thats where my husband will come in handy and he will be doing this all xD har har..
Then English. It was ok...were starting Macbeth tomorrow, then on thursday its Family life (or Sex ed as the simple call it). Can't wait..i allways find it so funny to see the teacher explain all that kind of stuff. 

Hmmm...Yay i get to leave in 9 days to go to Prince george! I can't wait..it'll be nice to see my family up there. And then have Jessie and Trevor (my two younger siblings) worship me while im there -snickers- They have the coolest rec pool there. Thats where ill be most of the time..i allways make it a thing to go swimming in their cool whirly pool and the wave pool and the many hot tubs and sauna's :3

"event","<FONT size=1>Wow, finally I got a LJ! Thank you so much Katie! -snuggleclings- Hmmm...so what's new today.

Well Joel came over last night, he amuses me. We hand to go over to my grandma's house so that me and my 4 cousins (Jessie, Rachel, Spencer, and Nathan) could divide up her kid movies since my aunt Tammy who's currently staying at the house while we clean it out can go home. I believe they're leaving on monday to go back to their house. So i got lots of cool disney movies, and then when we got home we watched, i still laugh at this, The Care Bears movie II. It was great. We sat there saying who was married and whatnot. Did you know there is a lot of interbreeding. Like the two old ones (Nobleheart the horse and Trueheart the bear) who made allll the little other guys. Don't ask me how a Horse and a Bear can make a Elephant and lion..its beyond us xD

Later on today i think i have to go help pack the big furniture up. My aunt terry gave me one of her furniture picks, its a large cabinet, which i can finnally get my room cleaned from all the Beanie Babies which my grandma had collected. I swear i have a good 150 or so, and since i had to split them up with my four cousins, there must have been over 800. Then i can put my movies and dvd's in there aswell. -sighs at a clean room for once in a few months-

Hmm. Christmas is comming soon. Ill be leaving for christmas, going to my dad's who lives in Prince George (a good 10 hour drive, ill be taking the bus)But i get to leave on the 18th, at 8 in the evening so ill get to Prince gorge at 8am the next day. Its there ill hopefully be meeting up with Jon, a college guy i met on this Canadian Were site. Its cool, we have a lot in common aswell as our interest about were wolves ^__^ so hopefully ill get to see him. 

Hmm..tomorrow i think im going shopping with my cousin Jenna, i need to get mine done before i go O__o; well I'm off, catch ya all later -waves-</FONT>"

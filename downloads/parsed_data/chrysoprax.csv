"event","Mousepad has just discovered yet one more limitation of the ""free"" LJ option. Mistakes will live forever; one cannot edit posts. Perhaps it is fortunate that readership is at an all-time low--no snide comments have been made about the many syntactical errors in the previous entry.[Note: it was written in a fit of theological passion, which state does not conform to 'best practices' in programming]. In counterpoint, the anisotropy algorithm now works beautifully. Sometimes disorder is quantifiable; sometimes it may be useful.  It  seems possible that transient patterns of disorder in biological systems may play a significant role in maintaining order at  a higher structural level. In this case, we can never completely ""elucidate the underlying mechanisms"". Can we accept the possibility that mapping the boundaries of these lacunae--that littoral washed by the waves of anisotropy--is all that we can know?  
     Edge, interface, ""l'esprit d'escalier"" [cf Sandman]: if significance lies in the pattern of the boundaries themselves, rather than in what such boundaries enclose--then we have brought knowledge back under our control. How tempting..as always...to define what is ""useful"" in such a way that it can be obtained after all. Who is to say that the pearl of great price cannot be wrested from an oyster in the shallows?

"event","So, why am I surprised?  One cannot stride across platforms and expect that the outputtted textfile from a PC Matlab program will, with any grace, submit to fopen, fread, fwrite or any other I/O manoeuvre in my C algorithm in the CW IDE  that seemed (evidently prematurely)  to offer a flexible, customizable approach for quantifying anisotropy in any given region of  scanned tissue.  The scan itself is novel: nonlinear properties of connective tissue allow us to determine aspects of molecular architecture in soft tissues.  from these data we can express the degree of disorder either locally or globally. Gabor transforms potentially  open those Huxleyan doors of perception--and what a great name! the implied mystery and tackiness of Zsa Zsa, for example, may have intrigued me more than necessary, especially since the referent did win a Nobel prize for his work in signal processing--but such transforms don't give us what our collaborators need , which thus makes it our need, since we--symbionts now--must be able to subject our respective reeking mounds of data to correlative analysis.  The jury's out on much of this: parametric? nonparametric?  these terms are not useful.  Hey, I'll push the button for  a Wald-Wolfowitz or Kolmogorov-Smirnov run--if Statview Sez it's Ok, why not look for that arbitrarian will'o'the wisp:p<0.05.  (""Significance  was set at  p<0.05."" ; ""representative analyses are shown..."", ""....it is anticipated that...""   ""mechanistic insights...""   ,  ""..although precise mechanisms are not known, it is tempting to speculate that..."")  We all know how to sing the  RO1 theme song.

  This is all ..what? not exactly procrastination...I spent far too long trying to troubleshoot something that is likely a problem that lies far outside any box currently available to my perceptions.   My demo matrices work fine---any form of data inputting (int, floats doubles, etc).--but there are presumably hidden  sappers at the Gates in the data outputs from the PCs.  I should know this by now: one suspects some degree of malevolence is at work...why, for example, should there be an incompatibily between WinDUZNT Xtra Putrefied and Panther such that Word docs  of a grant that was ever more imminently due seemed to experience something like a temporal lobe seizure when moving across platforms; suddenly, the 45 page doc showed an ominously rapid scrolling at the bottom, with the unhelpful message, ""Word is repaginating this document"".  SAY WHAT???   we're up to 1500 pages now for this document, and the ticker--as in any bad sci fi movie--seems to be increasing exponentially in its countdown rate.  We do live in a nonlinear world after all.  
   The unforgivable thing, here, is that one is lulled into thinking  that there is, as in the MacLink Plus v. 15 utopian vision, a seamless transition across the borders of our respective empires.  ...and the dos shall dwell with the mac, and the XP shall lie down with the Panther...NOT!!, news of this  Peaceable Kingdom is brought by false prophets, those who, like the Wendigo, sate themselves on that marvelous delicacy: the great lumps of greed embedded in human flesh.

You could look it up (another unattributed quote). How many of ""you"" { (in our uninflected language I could after all, be using the singular 2nd person, since ""thou"" is --""i think, but i just don't know""  [Lou Reed, from my Red Ribbon Week favorite song]  considered archaic} remember anythig about the Wendigo... a chilling mythos retold by algernon Blackwood?     But you know 'zactly what I mean...just google it.  More than you could ever want to know, right there...information is, after all, not only free, but probably henceforth devalued.  My original meme--that information degrades over time--seems inevitably to flow into this far greater stream: 

MOUSEPAD-one LIVES!!    

come on you alter ego....remember the prophecy... someone needs to bring balance to the force (of that effluvial stream,  Mousepad-one's  late night logorrhea). I remain, as always, prfoundly disenchanted by the needless complications wrought by Greed, Avarice, and their other companions.  As Isaiah said...it's 'a stone of stumbling... a rock of offence.'

later, y'all.

"event","My alter ego has remained curiously silent: perhaps this explains a certain one-sided aspect to the personality extant here.  Hope everyone of our 1 X 10 0 (that is a superscript) readers has noted the bold new icon: it's MR ATOM!  The icon of boomers of a certain age--the ""friendly atom"" of a 100 filmstrips showing how we were going to beat ICBMs beaten into plowshares.  Of course we were gullible: we were given to believe that we would be saved from nuclear holocaust if we just hid under our desks.  Those of us in kindergarten had to walk across a large exposed blacktop to get to the elementary school  (guess we didn't have any desks inour bulding) and were assigned desks lined up along the hallways.

  The mephitic fumes of NIH once more are blowin' in the wind: its grant resubmission time!  (Nov.1).  Luckily many of the demonic forms are done (cf last whining post).  I've been given a heads-up by one of my EE&CS colleagues: the diodes on our femtosecond laser are entering their golden age, and have perhaps a few more months until it's time for their retirement..straight to the dustbin of history, as Marx (possibly) said. Thus, a thousand purple proses will bloom to justifiy some major equipment purchases on this go-round.

"event","This year's charity drive is for The Children's Neuroblastoma Cancer Foundation.  It's a cancer of the nerves that typically effects enfants.  The average child is diagnosed at two years old.  It's the third most common cancer found in children.  There is a 10% survival rate.

The children appear normal, but will typically complain about aches or pains in a random location of the body one day.  After diagnosed, these children have about six months to live. 

There is no known cure.  The funding for the Children's Neuroblastoma Cancer Foundation is ridiculously low.  Without proper funding, we will never find a cure for these children.

I'm asking you to please check out the website for <a href=""http://www.cncf-childcancer.org/"">The Children's Neuroblastoma Cancer Foundation</a>.  

Any small amount of donations would greatly benefit these children.  I heard three heartbreaking stories from the parents of children who died from Neuroblastoma and heard a child speak that is ill with the disease.  This little boy will mostly likely die in a couple of months.  

Thanks for reading this.  I just wanted to raise awareness of this cancer.  It's not well known and underfunded.  We were told today that if we raised the same amount of money we raised last year (123 thousand dollars) we will DOUBLE the amount of money that they currently have for research this year. 

MUCH LOVE. I'm making this public, because I really want to let people know about this."

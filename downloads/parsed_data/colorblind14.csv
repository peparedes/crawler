"event","hokay. So the last few days have ben the worst this summer at least
funwise.&nbsp; I've been so bored it sucks.&nbsp; I saw Napolean
Dynomite on Monday with Doug Brandon and John, I will kill doug and
john for dragging me into that gay movie.&nbsp; IT SUCKED!!!&nbsp;
There was no plot line to it,&nbsp; no point to the movie It must have
been made by a group of computer nerds who had alot of money and way
too much free time.&nbsp; Then on the way home John blasted Nelly and
screamed stuff out the window to people.&nbsp; It was quite
funny.&nbsp; Yesterday I did absoloutly nothing except for video games
and basketball.&nbsp; HOPEFULLY today will be better but as of now
there seems no such luck. <br>
I Love you Ashley Blair<br>"

few days.&nbsp; I don't know what to say about the last few days except
for they've been fun.&nbsp; I am bored at this moment.&nbsp; Over the
past few days I've been trying to beat the game Splinter Cell Pandora
Tomorrow.&nbsp; That game is hard to beat it takes like 20 frickin trys
until eventually I throw the controler across the room in anger.&nbsp;
Wednesday I went to charlie's he got us all in trouble that
idiot.&nbsp; Then I went to Doug's on thursday.&nbsp; Friday I went to
the movies and the mall with Nick it was ok could&nbsp; have been
better.&nbsp; Yesterday i had my family graduation party.&nbsp; It was
fun always great to see my cousins funny kids I must say.&nbsp; Today I
am doing nothing as of now as I said earlier.&nbsp; I want to go to
great adventure some time next weak and have it not get screwed up. bye

"event","Ya I am bored as of now and this is the onyl thing to do.&nbsp; Also my
journal seems a topic of alot of contraversy so I'll try and not put
anything offensive or whatever in it.&nbsp; I saw dodgeball again
yesterday.&nbsp; That movie has to be one ot the greatest movies of all
time. and if you disagree than you're wrong.&nbsp; While we are on the
topic of the boxoffice&nbsp; I have the displeasure of hearing more
bullshlong about the hippie liberal propaganda movie Ferenhiet
9/11.&nbsp; It was proven that over 85% of that movie is Fiction and
only 10% is true the other 5% is unknown.&nbsp; So if you are so
cynical and stupid to believe the word of a lowly educated 350 pound
fat man ( and no I don't mean budda) then you can waste $8 and 2 hours
of you life to see something that almost makes me laugh at it's random
assumptions and irelevant talk.&nbsp; Now back to what most of you all
care about MY LIFE!&nbsp; By the way doug thanks for breaking my cell
phone I love you. My band seems to be going slower than a slug stuck in
molasis. But I have started writing lyrics.&nbsp; Today I am going to
Charlie's to hang with all my G's this should be fun.&nbsp; by the way
if you would like to visit the best and funniest site on the internet
go to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">www.maddox.xmission.com&nbsp; </span>please
if you are going to eb offended by volgar language and
sexaul/racial&nbsp; comments than please don't visit this site.&nbsp;
But if you like to laugh at yourself and others than please visit for a
good laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp; now it's time to end it up.&nbsp; <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">I love you Ashley Taylor Blair</span></span><br>"

"event","WOW!!! How would I explain these past few days.&nbsp; Too many memories
in this summer so far to contain.&nbsp; In 7 days of summer this summer
has already beaten past ones. Doug pulled a funny. I mena who goes to
Great Adventure and right at the gate says "" I forgot my pass""&nbsp;
well the Great Adventure story is very long and in detail so I don't
feel like writing it. By the way Thank you for coming Brandon.(
not)&nbsp; Then last night was too great to explain on this page.&nbsp;
Just me and the girl I love hiding from Kristina Doug and Chaz aka
Chuckie aka clay aka Charlie as we played manhunt.&nbsp; I chose some
good spots so me and Ash could just have some time alone to talk.&nbsp;
They gave up looking for us after 5 minutes.&nbsp; Then ya it was
AWSOME.&nbsp; <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I&nbsp; LOVE YOU ASHLEY TAYLOR BLAIR.</span></span></span></span><br>

"event","<FONT color=#330099>Today was boring at first.&nbsp;At church for once I didn't fall asleep because the new priest is cool.&nbsp; Then I sat home for like 4 hours. I had to pass up almost 4 offers to do something because my mom wouldn't have let me go, because I was going to my aunt's for Father's day at 4.&nbsp; When I went to my cousin's it was cool.&nbsp;Alex did&nbsp; a huge back flop off the diving board.&nbsp; Then we played some baseball.&nbsp;They think I'm going to be the next Roger Clemens ( obviously they don't watch or play alot of baseball).&nbsp; Then we played basketball, I stuffed my cousin's 6 times. Alex thinks my band should do a cover of Slipnot, (he has no taste in music)&nbsp; I just laughed. Then he was tryign to give me love advice.&nbsp; Don't worry I think Ashley can account for me when I say I know how to love. </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>I love you Ashley</FONT>"

"event","Incased you haven't noticed, or you have a slowly processing brain, I really don't care about Graduation.&nbsp; I hated Middle School it sucked, but I have to admit it wasn't as bad as my old school (let's not get into that).&nbsp; Can you believe today I wore an Adopt a Beach shirt. I must be the only Republican in the world to ever do that.&nbsp; I'm trying to write some music for my band but it is hard.&nbsp; Almost every phrase I write is already in a song!!!( or it's just gay).&nbsp; And just for the record <FONT color=#ff0000><EM><U>I love Ashley Taylor Blair</U></EM></FONT>"

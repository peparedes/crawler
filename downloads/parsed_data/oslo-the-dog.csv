"event","Oslo went to the vet today to get checked up.  The vet said his ears and belly and eyes and tail are all perfect.  He weighs 15.9 pounds, which means he has lost weight.  He was so well-behaved he got treats.  Oslo is the best dog ever."

"event","Yesterday was Oslo's 2nd birthday.  He's such a grown-up dog now.  He even has a mustache - little white hairs over his lip.  His mom made him a birthday cake out of dog biscuits and liver paste.  Yum.  Then he chewed on a bone for the rest of the night."

"event","Hey everyone!  Oslo and his mom and dad are having fun at their new pad.  Oslo loves being able to sleep in a bed every night and establishing his dominance over all the other dogs.  He loves playing with the kids in the neighborhood.  New things mean new stuff to chew on.  Oslo has been eating paint, trash and grass from the yard.  He can't wait to see his Aunt Pam next weekend at her graduation."

"event","Hello...Oslo hopes everyone is enjoying the spring weather.  He has been rambunctious lately.  He escaped from the house the other day and ran around the neighborhood for 30 minutes before being caught.  He has also been storing contraband in his crate for later - food wrappers and clothes he should not be chewing on.  But is still too adorable to be mad at for too long."

"event","Hello...Oslo wishes everyone a happy new year!  His resolution this year is to be twice as adorable and keep his website (http://oslothedog.tripod.com) and his webjournal updated so everyone who can't see him can know how he is doing.  Right now he is at his dad's house, where everyone is excited to have him around.  Lately he has been a troublemaker...he ate a bunch of Christmas cookies that were on top of a table, then he ate 15 pieces of chocolate and got sick.  But he is better now and romping around as always.  After eating the cookies and the chocolate he feels a little heavy, so he also resolves to lose some weight this year.  (Actually, his resolution is to eat as much of everything as possible, but his mom and dad are planning to foil him whenever they can).  Have a nice new year everyone!"

"event","While his mom is visiting a friend, Oslo is staying with his grandparents and his uncle Scott.  He has been up to a lot of mischief.  Because he is so cute, people tend not to notice when he eats trash out of the kitchen and bathroom.  He also starts trouble with all the dogs in the neighborhood.  Yesterday he whined at the door all day long because he wanted to explore all the things on the ground.  He also chased the squirrels and contemplated chasing the geese, who were flying overhead.  Everyone has loved hanging out with the pup."

"event","Hey everyone.  Thanks for reading!  Oslo's homepage is no longer the top site for googling 'pugeranian,' but this page is.  Oslo has been acting all crazy when people come to see him.  He also now likes to stick his nose against the air vents when he rides in the car.  He is excited because his cousin Whitney is coming to stay with him for a while.  Stay tuned for more pictures on the homepage, including never-before-seen shots of Oslo as a young pup."

"event","Olso had a great time visiting his dad over the last few days.  He hung out with his uncle Scott and barked at all the noisy dogs in the neighborhood.  He also went to a creek nearby and walked on the rocks and went swimming in the deeper parts.  He doesn't like to get wet but he is a good swimmer when he's in the water.  He also met Chuck, who is a bulldog.  Oslo and Chuck did not get along well, because Chuck is big and slobbery and Olso didn't like the looks of him.  Oslo likes to visit because he can sit on the couches and lay in the sun like a cat."

"event","Olso is up in Harford County on a visit at his dad's house.  He likes to hid under the chairs in the basement with just his head, or his behind, sticking out.  Before he came up here he went to the beach in Delaware.  He chased birds around and jumped into the water.  We have also been looking at old pictures of him when he was a puppy.  Soon they'll be on his website.  He has been doing better at taking his medicine."

"event","Oslo likes to chew on pointy plants and tall blades of grass.  Usually he will just take a nibble when walking by, but the other day he found a particularly tasty blade of grass.  Using his teeth, he pulled it out of the ground and proceeded to walk around chewing on it for the next ten minutes.  He looked like he was right of the set of Green Acres.  He's only been in the country for two weeks and he's already gone back to his country ways."

"event","Previously Olso has been good about taking his medicine, but recently he has been trying to avoid it.  Usually it is hidden in a treat and he eats it fine.  Today, he ate the treat but spit out the pill sneakily so no one would see.  Also today Oslo and his mom were laying in the hammock.  Oslo likes to lay on the hammock, but only if he is laying on his mom.  When she gets up, he can't sit on the hammock because his paws are too small."

"event","Oslo has been a little crazy this week. He likes to put things that he finds around the house underneath the dining room table. His own little treasure trove. Right now his pile of treasures is bigger than ever.

As many of you know, last week Oslo got into some rat poison and gave us a scare. Luckily we were able to get him to the vet quickly so that the antidote could be administered. Oslo is going to be fine. We have to give him Vitamin K twice a day for two weeks and then go for a followup check up, but the vets have assured me that he is going to be okay. In the meantime, he is acting completely normal and is as spunky as ever. Thanks for all of your hope and prayers!!"

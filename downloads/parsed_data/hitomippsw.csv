"event","Well, I finally scored the first volume of the legal Bandai edition of the Love Hina anime series! It's so funny! I tried several times since my original post, and have not been able to get a copy for less than $20. Well, thanx to an unchallenged bid on EBay, I got a brand new, freshly sealed copy! My true heartfelt thanx goes out to 12king@Ebay for selling it to me, and to everyone who didn't challenge my bid for it!"

"event","One thing I did not previously mentioned was I am the OIC (Officer In Charge) of the 308th MSG (Marine Strike Group) ""Crimson Raiders"" in our charter in Starfleet. Today, after my work, the Crimson Raiders went out into the boonies of Las Cruces, NM and fired several weapons, dating from the Civil War up to the Vietnam War. 

Three members of my MSG are Civil War reenactors, who owns a combined substancial arsenal. Amongst the weapons supplied for firing were a few percussion cap muzzle-loaded rifles, a pair of 7.62X54 Russian rifles, a German 8MM Mauser (which kicked like a mule), a Colt 45 revolver, a pair of Colt 45s, and a small canon which shot 2LB canonballs.

The muzzleloaders, the Mauser, the Colt 45 revolver, and the canon were fired to get familiar with the weapons. The Russian rifles and the Colt 45s were fired for actual weapons qualification. Once the qualification results come in, each shooter will be presented with official bottlecap qualification badges, which will be made by one of the reenactors. 

As soon as I find out how I did, I'll update my jorunal. I feel pretty good about it, though. Oh course, my medal(s) will be worn on my dress uniform."

"event","I am a member of Stafleet Internation, the Offical Star Trek Fan Association. The following is an excert from the log entry I sent the commander of the Shuttlecraft Hapsburg, the Starfleet charter in El Paso, TX.

Here is my report on the activities in Roswell over the weekend of the 4th to the 6th of July 2003.

I arrived in Roswell at 4:30PM, and rendezvoused with ADM. John ""Gumby"" Simmons (the Starfleet Region 17 commander) and three crewmen from the USS Stormbringer at the Fairfield Inn hotel, which was within 4 blocks of downtown. After toasting my successful arrival to Roswell with a shot of Tarantula Tequila, we proceeded to Walmart and a couple of liquor stores for supplies. 

He was very inspired by my XAct FRS wrist communicator, so he decided to buy himself and his fiance a pair. I also located a supply of mini Tarantula Tequila bottles for him to use on a personal bandoleer for special occasions. He also picked up two cases of Alien Amber Ale, and scored a free Alien Amber Ale T-shirt.

After getting the supplies, we joined the commander and crew of the USS Pioneer, as well as their mascot, Riker Bear at the hotel. The commander of the Pioneer presented me with a SFI-Roswell T-shirt, which was designated as the relaxed duty uniform for the weekend. We proceeded to Whataburger for evening chow, then promptly attended a spectacular fireworks display. Afterwards, we adjourned to the hotel for some needed ""cool-down"" refreshments before retiring for the night at midnight.

The next morning, Gumby dressed up as a Battlestar Galactica Colonial Warrior, complete with boots, blaster, and cigar, for a costume contest at the East New Mexico Fairgrounds, the base of operations for the UFO Festival. I escorted him, wearing my Starfleet Marine Aviator's flightsuit, although I did not intend to enter the contest (didn't want to give the admiral additional competition). Unfortunately, the judges preferred two bigheaded alien ambassadors, a dachshund with a small alien riding his back, a group of three sisters dressed in blue spandex with whiffleball-filled ""tentacles"" attached, and a bizarre creature and his trainer over Gumby-Starbuck.

After the costume contest, COL. John Roberts and the crew of the USS Anasazi arrived, followed shortly after by Commodore Nancy Lynch and the crew of the USS Mir. The Anasazi proceeded to have lunch at Denny's, while the others went to the Eastlake Chinese Buffet. No further contact from the Anasazi's crew was made.

After lunch, everyone returned to the fairgrounds, where a recruiting table was set up, complete with referral cards, information CDs, and other goodies. The table was manned until 4:00PM.

We returned to the hotel to change into some relaxed clothes. The Mir crew arrived at the hotel for 1/2 an hour of socializing before returning to Las Cruces that afternoon. Since they did not remain the weekend, I considered myself fortunate I did not travel with them else I had to return with them. At 7PM, we joined the Pioneer's crew to see a good presentation at the Goddard ""Planet-arium"" (SouthPark reference). Afterwards, we adjourned to the Pioneer's quarters at the Ramada Inn for sandwiches and drinks before retiring for the night at 12:30AM.

After checking out from both hotels at noon Sunday, we had lunch at the CrashDown Cafe, within a block of the UFO Museum. After lunch, we explored several gift shops, before touring the museum. Inside, we got some information about the UFO crash incident in Roswell on July 4th, 1947. We were also introduced to the cofounder of the museum, who was the PA officer at RoswellAAB until 1974. After touring one last gift shop, we were forced to part ways. I left Roswell at 4:30PM, after refueling my car.

Overall, I had a great time with Gumby and the other members of Region 17. I highly encourage other members to join me next year, when we will return to recruit more members. 

End of Report."

"event","Well, I had a very close call yesterday.

My dad hired me a year ago to be a licensed chauffeur for a sightseeing company he owns called Border Sights Shuttle. I was running a tour of historic downtown, which was going ok (a tad slow, but acceptable).

I was driving through Concordia Cemetery, the final resting place of famed gunslinger John Wesley Harden. My mom (the tour guide) and our passenger stepped out to look at his grave, when the engine stall. I turned the key, but the engine wouldn't start! Ohh man! Talk about the worst place for something to die - at the cemetery!!! My mind was having visions of a story about someone's car left at the same cemetery overnight because it broke down, and was destroyed the following day (every tire flat, every piece of glass broken, radio gone, etc.) and was very worried about the same thing happening to the company van. Thankfully, some kind folks offered me a jump-start and got us going again.

Unfortunately, this adventure into disaster is not over. Mom and our passenger went to a nearby restaurant to get out of the heat, so I take the van there after the jump. We had some good greasy nachos and plenty of water for lunch. After lunch, I went to get the van and took it up to the door. Unfortunately, a big truck, which is about the size of a semi, backs up right into me and crunches a fiberglass panel in the back corner!!! Oh no!!! What a day....

Needless to say, I was *very* tired when I got home..."

I was amazed at how funny Andy is, and how much furthermore he doesnt realize it. Dan was sick, which isn't good. Juliana seemed happy.. somehow.. Justin was kind of out of it all day, John ate a lot. Katie loved Dan, then again some more, and then three times. Hmm ASHLEY ditched STEVE(me) to go away from me.. with someone else. Derek seems to have had a blast, but after 10, could not keep his eyes open. I don't care about Jalaina.. Drew and Chanel had fun :).

All my dreams, pass before my eyes, of curiosity.

Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind.

Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea;
All we do, crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see.

Dust in the wind, All we are is dust in the wind.

Don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky;
It slips away, all your money won't another minute buy.

Dust in the wind, Everything is dust in the wind."

"event","Today, was my first day of school.... I signed up last year, for 0-5 periods, instead of the normal 1-6. Today I got to school, at home room and I realized that I was dropped from my 0 period class, and was moved to 6th period Drama? This is a burden, because I get to school at 7 A.M. anyway, because my parents take me to school. I think it's more efficient if I just take a 0 period class. I am now seeking a Teachers Aide position for my 0 period class. I wish to TA for Mr. Alvarez. He's a cool cat and I know the most I would have to do is enter grades and what not. Maybe grade a few spelling tests. I think that if I get into that class to TA, then this year will blow by smoothly."

"event","Today is Monday, the 1st of September. Yesterday, I had rehersal from 2 o'clock to 5 o'clock PM. After rehersal, I went to my great friend Tiffanys house. Me and my handy leather napsack, Leandro, played a lot of guitar. After jammin for about an hour, we all went to church, and a lot of tiffanys friends are hot, but not like Tiff ;). After the mass there was a sock-hop type thing at the hall. And a weird thing happened; Derek's church St. Lawrence used to have a priest named ""Father Chris."" Anyway, the weird thing is, that he was doing the mass at Tiff's church, and that was just weird seeing him again, he remembered me too, from like 4 years ago.. So he said. Well after that, Tiff brought a couple friends over. Her friends Becky, and Natalie. Leandro got it on with Natalie. GO LEO!!... A lot of great things happened that I'm glad did. But; I was about to have the time of my life (about 4 o'clock in the morning.) Went to sleep at about like 6 o'clock... And then after all that jazz, we woke up at 10 o'clock about, and had pancakes (Like always.) Then we went to rehersal, it was an extremely great night for me, I made new friends who I'll never talk to ever again! And I expanded my friendship with Tiff a lot. It is definetly a weekend to remember."

He has to put a stop to his childish attraction toward her (so he thinks.) His perception on other people has become hackneyed. There you go Sooz. From Steve to you."

We decided I needed to finally get off of my fucking crushed ass.. I really need to move on, im going to resort to extreme precautions! I will not talk to her, or visit, look, wave, acknowledge. It's going to be hard, give me input.."

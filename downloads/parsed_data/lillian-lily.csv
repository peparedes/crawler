"event","I felt like i should update, seeing as how i haven't in a while. Also i needed to rant because i am royaly pissed off at my mom. 

  Our annual fair at lancaster is here and i want to go to this concert on wednesday, mom says i can go, but i can't drive myself. Although i'm PERFECTLY capable of driving myself! It frecking pisses me off!! i am 16 years old and i deserve to go an hour away to a concert. I don't want to be in a bubble anymore, (i'm currently in the i'm-the-youngest-so-mom-is-sheltering-me bubble, and i'm sick of it! I demand the freedom that is giving to someone who is previlaged to drive. If the DMV thinks i'm ok to drive, i don't see why my own mother won't! 

 That's really all i have at the momment, as i am too mad to think of anything else. I'll update again when i'm in a better mood. Thank you for your time. 



P.S DARRYL!!!  YOU NEED TO COME BACK!! I NEED A SHOULDER TO CRY ON! (WHEN KEALA IS IN THE BATHROOM)"

"event","I feel like i should update. I haven't in a while so i think I should. Well, my friend Aub is leaving tomorrow, i don't know when but hopefully it's after i give her her stuff. (BTW Aub i have your phone, it's at my house) and i few other things that i won't tell you about. 
 On saterday i went to the show with Keala, Aubry and Keith to see the Fantastic 4, it was a pretty cool movie. But before we went to the movie, Keith gave us all 60$ each! I was shocked, not even my parents would do that just for the hell of it. After the movie we went to Outback, it was alright, the food wasn't that great, the server wasn't very good at her job, and i didn't feel all that well during dinner. Yeah, it basically sucked. After dinner we went to Walmart and spent out remaining money. I ended up not getting much, but enough for me. 
  
Yesterday i went over to Keala's to help him with a project, but the project is strictly a need-to-know things to i won't discuss it. :)

And today...well i don't really know what i'm doing, i deffinatly need to shower, i feel icky. And don't anyone say anything! I shower almost every day, i didn't shower yesterday cause i didn't feel like it. But anyway i think i told you everything you need to know. I'll go now a wallow in my filth. See you all later

I have the early signs; obsessive cleaning, moodyness, and the sudden urge to find work. It might not be too late to save me, but just in case it is i'll leave my most prized pocessions to my closest friends-

Aubry: I leave you my savings, spend it as i would like it to be spent.

Keala: I leave you my stuff, but only the ones you hold most dear to you, like Fred...and your shirt

To everyone else: Go nuts. I can't take most of these things with me where i'm going.

Yup, you guessed it...i'm going to Wisconsin, and not the good place either, it's the Western Part of Wisconsin, where they're Viking Fans. Wish me luck friends, remember me as a peacemaker, and a laugh. I shall miss you all terribly. The Goat will ride again!!!

NOTE; This is to inform everyone who reads that this patient can not be held responsible for her action as she is ill with the disease Boredomus Mostest Or plainly, Boredom. If any one comes by the house looking for the things that the patient has giving you then you will be escorted off the property. If you do not choose to cooperate we will have no choice but to shoot you down, or have a dozen 5 year old sicked on you. Which ever one you want.

Yep. This is one of those moments that has it's ups and downs. 

On the upside; I don't have to worrying about many wedding plans because i'm just a bridesmaid. 
The downside; I'm in BOTH my sister's weddings, BOTH a bridesmaid, and i'm sure knowing my luck, i will have more to do with both weddings than i would like. 

I'm just glade i don't have to worry about this stuff for like another 5, 10, 20 years. Sry Keala, I'm taking my good old time tieing the knot.

Besides i'm trying to think about my dad, he has to deal with 2 weddings in the next 2 years, I don't want to overwhelm him with this kind of stuff, also i don't want to kill my mother with outrages wedding prices.

I have bad Karma, or at least that's what my boyfriends says, told me i'm going to come back to life as a sales person. Ha! it is to laugh. I'd much rather be a princess, or someone famous, but i don't think my karma is good enough. Oh well. I don't dig the whole karma thing, i'm not all the superstious either, I mean i'll get edgy if something weird happens, but other than that... but get me in a conversation on the supernatural, you just gave up half your day.
I diffinitly belive there is more than just human beings on this earth. Besides beliving in this sort of stuff makes life more interesting. I think i've been wacthing too much Charmed and Buffy. almost makes me think that there actually real. Hey maybe they are you never know.

"event","You take the Path of Least Resistance. 

Why make things hard for yourself? You are a go-with-flow sort of person and little gets to you. Why? Because it's all good, right? They say the path of least resistance is a straight line and that's where you go, ever forward and never looking back. It's good to keep the past behind you, a quality far too little people have these days. You know the past is the past, but don't let yourself forget it. You can't learn from your mistakes if you don't remember them. You're probably loved for your laid-back frame of mind and easy-going qualities , but you tend take the easy way out in life and verge on lazy. 

  Great character is found through great challenges. You most likely have the abilities in you to succeed and over-come what life throws at you. You just got get up and face that challenge. You tend to lose your head in bad situations because you aren't used to them. And by the time you've found the easiest way to master a problem, you could've already taken care of it.

 Bad things happen, difficult situations come up, that's life. What matters is that you rise to face those challenges and you can do it. Never lose your laid-back qualities as they will help you greatly. Just step onto that hard road every once in awhile and you'll discover that with each stretch it becomes easier and easier to over-come life's hurdles.

"event","Sry i didn't write. I guess i'll tell you about it now. 

Friday; went to school, got some Taco bell, when we got home we went to the last game of the season and to the dance. Had some fun *wink*

Saterday; went to school, got some Wendy's, went to the show and saw the incredibles, cool movie. 

Sunday; went to school, got some Shakeys (Yea shakeys!!) and took a final test, we had to take like 3 test before we took a final one, my scores were minus 11, 16, 8, and 5 on the final one. I was exctied. 

Now i can finally get my permit. i'm not sure when i'm going to the DMV but i'm guessing it's soon.  so i guess that's my exprience at driving school. all in all i don't want to go back if i don't have to.

Well c-ya."

"event","And have you ever looked at dirt? it's pretty dull. Anyway i guess it wasn't too bad. Oh wait! i didn't tell you; I'M GOING TO DRIVING CLASSES!!

 It's cool at guess, one step closer to driving. The best part about it was wacthing this disney cartoon about goofy, that was cool! I had Burger King for lunch, it was pretty good, i get to be with Keala for 7 and a half hours (BIG plus there!!!! :) and i get to do it all over again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day. till sunday. I'm going to be so pooped. So i guess i'll go and do...something i guess...i don't know.  EVIL HAMSTERS WILL CONQURE THIS PATHETIC TOWN!! (it's something like that i can't remember)


Bye Bye!!

"event","Welcome one and all. 

So this thursday i went into town with my mom, it was ok. Went to the skin doctor and got stuff to fix my face, and it will only take 3 types of medication!! i'm not that bad looking really. 

Then after a few shopping trips i went to College. I know what you all are thinking. How can a 10th grader go to college? and in the middle of school no less! Well i didn't REALLY go to college, I went to my sister college, for college days. It's just a few days where high schoolers get to go and check out the school. Well this is where it get's ugly, the school that my sister goes to is a Christian College, you should be able to guess the rest. I go to classes, play the whole dress up skirt thing, and all that time i felt like i was such and outsider. 
  I never thought that i would feel so low in a place like that, but i do almost everytime i'm over there. And the worst thing is that most of them expect me to go when it's time for me to go to college. I don't have any plans yet but if i keep going where i'm going, which is nowhere, i might not have a choice. 
                                     Ok i'll c-ya all later


P.S i'm going to driving classes this week! i'm excited. I can't wait."

"event","Have you ever had dinner on a street island? I did last night, quite fun. I went to the Barrel (the local burger joint) with my cousin Krista to get some food. While we were waiting for our food i looked over to the middle of the street were the island was. So i thought...why not wait for the food on the island? So did. We also had dinner on the Island.  So that was my adventure for the day. I have alot of adventures, just most of them are not very interesting. So i guess i'll talk to you all later.



                           I LOVE YOU ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","I decided to restart my blogging. It's been a long time since I wrote. At the moment, I find myself having a lot of useless time. I amlways thought that It was fun to bum, but apparently it is tyring as well, you constantly have to find something new to do. I know that I shouldn't be complaining, not many people are given the chance to just just relax. I guess it is just that I am not used to this. I dont like that this time envokes thoughts that drive me insane.

I just got home from dinner with my barkada. It's nice to see the girls and how our lives have taken different turns. I have a friend that's married and is pregnant. The other is living in the states already. And the other one is in the dance of love. How we gossip and question the directions that we see. I mean I often wonder what do we want for each other? Happiness? Love? Or ever after? I don't want to be cheesy and say that I want it all for them. All I know is that they are the best bunch of ladies."

That hurts.

It's not that I believed that we are soulmates, or other beliefs similar to that, but I thought we were good friends, almost the best of them. And to be replaced by a ""boy"" that you've only known a year. That hurts.

These are the times when I loose my faith in friendship, in the end someone will always be more important to you than me. But tonight... tonight is for the old times. It is for that time in my life when you had played your card - and won a companion. 

And after you leave and go back to your soulmate - I am going to get so totally wasted. 

. yes I am bitter."

"event","Spent almost the entire weekend with my friends. I had so much fun, I spent hours playing monopoly, watching anime and the 10th kingdom. I also spent hours talking and listening and laughing.. pure laughter... There was a never ending hail storm of laughter. I was also supposed to stay up and watch the meteor shower (which is supposedly the only one for the next 90 years). But some how, we never got around to do it.
I had so much fun despite my horrible cold and sore throat ( I sounded really bad and had to drag a throat ( I sounded really bad and had to drag a tissue box where ever I went) There were moments in this extremely joyous celebration that reminded me of my high school days. The time when things were so much simpler, when it was so much more innocent. 

--> But life goes on, things change and dreams just seem to grow. Life now is sometimes easier and sometimes harder. But it is certainly more complicated. And somehow, weirdly enough I am anticipating the changes to come... I guess, this is because I know that maybe even twenty years from now, we will still be laughing, together, still playing monopoly; still never giving up our time together

Because no matter what, in this few seconds, in the fewer moments of that laughter or just ""togetherness"", lives more than our high school days, it's all the days that we have together."

by: Angela Manalang-Gloria

It was a sacrilege, the neighbor cried, 
The way she shattered every mullioned pane
To let a firebrand in. They tried in vain
To question how one so carved in pride
And glassed in dream could have so flung aside
Her graven days, or why she dared profane
The bread and wine of line for one insane
Moment with him. The scandal never died.

Bot no one guessed that loveliness would claim
Her souls cathedral burned by his desires,
or that he left her aureoled in flame...
And seeing nothing but her blackened spires,
The town condemed this girl who loved too well
And found her heaven in the depths of hell.

I was reading this on my way home from her house. I had a lot of fun there, more than I had in awhile. On the way home this though kept on floating in my head. <i> 
And she found her heaven in the depths of hell </i>

It reminded me of the Japanese for some odd reason. My friend was telling me that the Japanese find their women or even men (bishounen) beautiful when they undergo much suffering. 

Well, it's just an odd thought that haunted me on my way home... It was a thought that got louder and louder in my head  - a thought that meshed with the others."

Innuendo (1991)
The Show Must Go On 

Empty spaces - what are we living for 
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score 
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for... 
Another hero, another mindless crime 
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime 
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore 
The show must go on, 
The show must go on 
Inside my heart is breaking 
My make-up may be flaking 
But my smile still stays on. 
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance 
Another heartache, another failed romance 
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for? 
I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now 
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now 
Outside the dawn is breaking 
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free 
The show must go on 
The show must go on 
Inside my heart is breaking 
My make-up may be flaking 
But my smile still stays on 
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies 
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die 
I can fly - my friends 
The show must go on 
The show must go on 
I'll face it with a grin 
I'm never giving in 
On - with the show - 
I'll top the bill, I'll overkill 
I have to find the will to carry on 
On with the - 
On with the show - 
The show must go on..."

"event","""I am dying"" I quietly told my friend, while we were both sitting on the edge of the cliff. My head was laid on her shoulder. We were both just sitting there staring at the ocean, her arms around mine.  You looked at me, smiled and said, ""yeah right!"" 

""YES!"" I wanted to scream at you. ""I am dying!""  My soul is slowly rotting and my mind is in a place where dreams cannot breath. But instead of screaming my pain, this intense destruction, I feel. I just looked away. I looked towards the sun. The beautiful sky in it's glorious colours. All the mixing hues, the bleeding tones, that mate. The sun was setting. And what made the painful throb of my heart stop was the way the land of the shaddow crept up and ate the colours, step by step.  Blue -  a myrad of colours that was subdued  by  the grayish blueness of night. It's silence still manages to mystify me. And I really thought for a few seconds I found peace. But I was wrong, because you asked, ""seriously, your not dying right?""

I looked back at my life, my unsavory past. I could see all the pain that I tried to hide. The pain that I inflicted on others. The pain that they left me with. I close my eyes against this sudden overriding pain! I could not feel the gentle wind show her wild wanton breath. I could not hear the seductive tones of the waves, while it longs and begs for his lover. to come back. I cannot feel anything, because these voices in my head are crying to me - these constant words of hate that seem to explode in my head.

Yes, I am almost dead."

The peacuful hues of blue that contrast with the wild screams of red. I love the way the different tones of orange brightens when mated with the tones of  vibrant yellow.

I love the dark finality of black, the way it screams against the loneliness it must bear. I love the way it pouts like whore waiting to be colored.

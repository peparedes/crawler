"event","I am listening to ""colorblind"" I love this song it is one of my favorite songs. i really wish i could play the piano from this song it is so pretty. Now i am listening to one sweet day. this song reminds me of my aunt marlene. lately i have missed her alot. she was the best aunt anyone could ever have wished for she was soo nice to me. 

You know my cousin liked this guy and they broke up and she was still in love with him. And she talked to me on the phone for hours about him and how sad he made her and i tried to help her in anyway i could. then they went thruogh a bunch more stuff and she talked about him again and again on the phone internet, in person. i dont think even one time i have talked to her without hearing about him. i call her my best friend and she calls me her best friend and i think its because i listen to her without contest. i contradict her on certain things but for the most part we have had a very shallow friendship i mean she is not a bad person i just think she unloads on me like if i say i had a crappy day she would say im sry and then be like well geuss what he did today and not that i need all the attention its just that i dont get any attention from anywhere at all and i think that i look for the least bit of attention from her and she doesnt realize it and please do not think of her as a bad person if you read this because i love her to death its just me i need more out of our friendship than she realizes i need. and it sounds mushy or whatever its just all i want is a true friendship with her. and everyother sentence is he did this and he did that and i dont wanna hear it anymore i mean i have been overloaded not that i dont want her to be able to come to me but its all him and sometimes i think that the only reason she talks to me is because i am the only one that listens and i do want to be here for her cause thats what friends are supposed to do but i just cant take it. and she really lets him walk all over her whether she realizes it or acknowlegdes it but its there. so hey i have to go listen.

What happens to a fallen hero?  Does he live on in our hearts, or die like a fading dream?

Kindness is the ability to sacrifice and suffer for another.

My Heroic Oath I am the hero.  I fight for truth, justice, and honor.  Until the day death shines its dim light upon me, my fight will never end.

One measure of leadership is the caliber of people who choose to follow you.

Success is never final, but failure can be.

No one tries to fail, but many fail to try.

Where there is great love, there are always miracles.

Great love and great achievement often involve great risk.

"event","i can see myself standing on a rock floating through pitch black darkness,
 hearing nothing but the sound of wind howling around me, and my internal heart
 screams begging for all life to stop...the last thing i remember is the tears
in her eyes as our dreams were broken only for hers to begin again; the unbroken
silence of my non-existent defiance and the cold stares of love's unkindled flame 
spread over me like this blanket of loneliness that won't keep me warm in the vastness of space, 
now lightyears away from the contentment that being wrapped in her arms could bring even on the 
worst of days...and now i feel myself fading out of existance...and now i know i was born of her
love and fighting for her would have been fighting for myself but my strength is gone and my love 
alone is never enough to make her need me to be."

"event","Okay...I've abandoned my huge core audience. hahaha.

Lately, my life has been impacted by two new obsessions, which are the following: my first ever MMORPG, City of Heroes; and (surprise!) a TV show, Lost.

I say surprise because the last thing I watched on TV was the moon landing (and I wasn't even alive for that one...)  I recommend it to anyone who likes a good story.

AS far as CoH goes, I have a level 28 technology tanker on the freedom server named Chip.  (that period doesn't end the sentence, it's actually part of his name; so if ya wanna look me up there ya go...)

Well, that's been my life for the past two months...interesting, huh.

P. S.  I've also read White Oleander by Janet Fitch and The Princess Bride:  The Good Parts Version by William Goldman, both great...
I'll also be 26 in two weeks....erg...argh..."

"event","I've been trying to ""expand my horizons"" lately.  Trying to reawaken my dormant intelligence.  Grow as an individual.  It's good to know my mind hasn't completely athrophied into a useless mass.  I've started reading again, and I've found that I've missed it.

Moving on, the purpose of this entry is sort of a request for mental stimulation through suggestions of interesting/clever music, books, movies, news articles, etc...working at a job a mindless drone could do for the past 5 and a half years has taken its toll on my mental fortitude.

I would like to see myself go back to school (someday) when I can afford it, which is hopefully within 6 months to a year (yeah, right); rather than waste my intelligence clerkin'.

Oh well, Later..."

Vampiric Rebirth 

Death is what happens when you accept that your life is over...
And falling in love is what happens when you can't hold on to yourself...Imagine if you couldn't remember what is real...Who you are, what you think, or how you feel...All is lost except for one thing........Your hunger....for blood...

If blood-stained hands can never be pure...then you are truly damned...for the sins you commit course eternally through your veins...Life everlasting doesn't mean as much with out someone to hold...and you're dead inside....

Can a beast as dark and as cruel as you be capable of even tasting love...You've tasted life and death...but there are certain things even you have grown numb to...Is one of those things your soul?


Invisible Sunshine

She had an inner brilliance no one ever saw--
No one ever saw but you and me
Never really given the chance to truly shine
We taught her how to find herself
The power deep inside
We showed her the invisible sunshine 
That gleamed inside of her
At first she took us with a grain of salt
But then she finally began to see
That all her life she'd been living in the shade
Never knowing the latent greatness 
That exists inside her heart--
The only true power she ever needed
She saw inside herself
Now we're blinded by her invisible sunshine
Who could have known it would shine so bright?


So every body tell me what ya think...Later"

what changed his mind? will this start up our weekly breakups?do i care?"

I miss you all so much!!!  life is taking an a pattern here, the routine is strange, but i like it, sometimes. i'm working in the theatre here, we just had jay leno come by and the full monty. i'm sort of supposed to be ""seeing"" this prior service guy here, but neither of us takes it seriously. 

funny how life works out.  

funny how a place can consume you.

i sat on an honor board the other day. i sat in a room and circled the fate of my classmate on a sheet of paper. honor violations mean you're gone from the academy, we won't speak your name, we won't remember you and if we do, it will be with disgust. You're a traitor to west point, to us, to america.  if you are not found guilty of a violation, it doesn't matter to the cadets. they will treat you like a leper and will always see you as guilty.

everyday as the sun goes down, a cannon is fired off and a bugle plays as the flag is lowered. everyone outside stops, faces the flag, salutes and waits until the flag is down. sometimes i've seen the squirrels stand still. 

they give rings to the graduates. there is a lot of tradition surrounding these rings. you can order minatures and use them as engagement rings. another tradition is the spoony button. it's a small silver button worn on the full dress uniform and cadets give them to their girlfriends. 

I can go be airborne, air assault, close quarters combat, sapper, aviation, scuba... any other miads...  exciting? sort of. 

i'm not sure i like having so much expected of me. it's getting to where it'll be too easy to disappoint people.

but oh my god, i'm at WEST POINT. The freakin' military academy. patton, macarthur, ike...  they went here. centuries ago, soldiers went here. this place is steeped in tradition and stories.   standing up at the old chapel, at night, smoking and talking quietly, you can really feel the past around you. 


this isn't an academy i attend, or a school i got to and live at. it's a life that will change everything from here on. i'll always be a west pointer. it's a way of life here...  i think i love it."

I shot well, i guess. didn't win anything, really. came in first for teams, but whatever. the beautiful part: Josh Albright. he is so sweet...  and so opposite me, he says we cancel each other out...
""I fall down a lot."" 
 ""Well, I'll hold up you. I move too slowly to be taken by surprise."" 
he wrote me segments of songs, then gave me the cd that must have been written by me in all my moods. 
Then I saw Robert Rivard again, and he was fun and light hearted and silly. And Matt Rawlings, for being the flirt that he's supposed to be, was alone a lot. He and I hung out some, but it was like hanging out with Rcky Alessi (i guess, never tried, actually). I played Cranium, which is the game of the year, and had to act out Shirley Temple, so i did a tap dance and sang ""on the Good ship, lollipop..."", and all Matt could do was stare blankly. So i said ""I'm a drink, you can order in most restaurants."" and then he guessed it. 
Cruel: Some one who doesn't know me suggested I might be a slut, only to have it more or less confirmed by Bruce, my coach, whom I thought knew me better than that.  Oh my GOD I'm not a slut! how could he even think that?! I know i hang out with guys, but i don't dress in anything skimpy or revealing or suggestive! and I don't run around like half the girls in shooting making bets with the pay off being oral sex! christ!!! Bruce and I can't recover from perry, i don't think. He stood aside when he should have intervined and intervined when he should have backed away. he cost me precious time and points in the matches, and stood by and let Tod, this crazy son of a bitch force me down and hold my face to the ground by the back of my neck (yeah, i have finger print bruises on the back of my neck from it) and i've never been scared of someone before, but i was then and it hurt so bad, and bruce just stood there and didnt stop him.   and now i'm home.

I hate war. who doesn't? but at this point, nothing else is working. we've been peaceful for over two decades with saddam hussein, giving him more than ample chance to disarm and he hasn't. he is a terror to his people. it's beyond time for him to be taken out of power, for our saefty, for his people's safety. Bush gets made fun of a lot for his accent and vocabulary, but you know what? everyone has an accent and specific speaking style, lay off!  some critic today called him a ""cowboy"" and meant it in a demeaning way. maybe i'm mistaken, but who doesn't like cowboys? every little kid played ""cowboys and indians"" when they were young, and the cowboys were the good guys. john wayne was a cowboy. 
Clinton cannot be called a great president. he sat on this iraq disaster for 8years and tap danced around the issue. he'll go down in history for monica Lewinsky. Bush, on the other hand, sets down a firm foot and tells saddam he has 48hrs to leave. a country offers him exile. he doesn't take it. so bush does the inevitable. in a timely, smooth fashion. he'll go down in history for freeing iraq from saddam and re-establishing america as a country that don't play.

"event","I went to my brother's graduation in SC from Basic combat training for the army this week.  It was happy, some parts, but sad for others. these boys, and yes they were boys, were training themselves and going through absolute hell to do so, to fight for our country. And when they graduated, some of them were national guard anf got to go to a NG station close to home, some were reserve who went home and some were regualr army who went on the another unknown place for 21 weeks without leave for advanced training. 
I met some of these boys, Medrano, Tomassi and Smith. and got some sad sad stories from them.
One boy in Charlie Company committed suicide.  Half of the ones that went in with girlfreinds got Dear John letters...   Tomassi said how disheartening it was to see them all excited to get a letter, then see the excitement build as they realized it was from their girl, but then to see them began to actually cry because this girl ""couldn't wait around forever"" and left them...   Geez...
and some of them had parents that didnt come to see them graduate. Tomassi was one of them . his dad hates his mom and vice versa, so neither was going to come because they thought the other might. so he hung out with us for the two days. I really got to know him. he's supposed to write me so i can send him letters and such (he doesn't know where he'll be till he gets there) but in the mean time, i'm going crazy with happiness to get his letter. i like him. those boys were all different. they were respectful, fun...  
Medrano was from new york, manhattan. he wants me to come visit. He's NG.  they were all so happy to have some one to write them. I feel like it's the least i can do, they are fighting for us. it's nothing to make them feel thought about, cared for. I would do it for any of my freinds, why not for someone as patriotic as them?

on a lighter note, it was a great time because there were 800 of them, and only one girl their age that was single and attractive and not in the service (they can't talk/touch the girls in the service, it's 15 day confinement)ME!  plus, they all knew who i was because evidently it's unwritten law that any sisters of the cadets must send a pciture and breif bio, which of course my brother did. geez... i like those boys. 'specially tomassi...   i like america. 

but oh god....   if we go to war...  oh god...  it terrifies me to think they might go, they're so young!  they aren't like our freinds, they are our freinds, they are so young, and want to same things we all do, to grow up, learn, love...   please don't let them be taken."

"event","i spent the better part of my day teaching little Mary, a mormon, that dying my hair is not sacrilige, and that god will not kill me for going to a prom in a spaghetti strap dress. i also taught her important life lessons:
china is not, and will never be, our freind.
wearing a bikini is not the same as having sex.
wearing make-up is not a crime, god really doesn't mind. 
catholics fall under the christian category
i won't go to hell for corrupting her. 

all i tried to do is make her think. i think i may have undone years of religious training.

"event","had an awful dream last night. It started out so great...  we were on a trip, it was like honeycreek only with the theatre department and prettier scenery. somewhere in new england. and the day for my family to go back, we all pile in the van and the terror begins. first of all, i'm frightened to death of spiders. and there was a huge black one in the van with me that i couldn't seem to kill. it kinda came and went. then, we were driving through the middle of nowhere when that info-radio station came on and told it's listeners that the town up ahead was extremely dangerous and bad. It said somehting along the lines of ""we sent our troops in to regain law and order in that town, but the only thing that came out was a man have burned to death with large peices of flesh missing, aparently eaten. so we all get nervous and decide to follow the directions of this radio to not stop, or slow down, lock our doors and don't let the young or attractive be seen. 

We reach the town and it looks kinda deserted, the only thing out of the ordinary is a bad smell and the world's population of bums. big, dangerous, rabid bums. with pipes ands weapons and such. for some god-knows-why reason, my dad stops the car and gets out, leaving the keys in the ignition. I think he must have seen someone in distress on the side of the road. the town looked a bit like every rural town, but had a very evil feel to it. while we all wait and wonder why on earth he stopped, a scruffy man runs up, reaches into the car and takes the keys. no one freaks out, cuz my mom has her set, so we're still able to drive. Heading out of town, we round a bend and notice two things, 1. they've set fire to the train station and everything else in site, 2. we were stuck in a line of cars trying to get over a bridge, the only way out of town, while this fire burned two feet from us on either side. it was amazingly hot, especially for a dream. we looked around and saw all these criminal-esque men coming out of the woods, like children of the corn. The only thing i can think of to describe it was it was a modern day Sodom and Gemorrah, mixed with Atlanta as it burned in Gone with the Wind (all the exploding depots).  I was scared to death, there was so much destruction.  God had truly turned his eyes from that town...  
along the side of this bridge were abandoned, gutted cars, leaving you to wonder what had happened to the original owners. as we got over the bridge, we could seee through the trees to our left and right and realized that the entire town was burning, there was panic and looting and crime everywhere...  then our windshield exploded. i woke up. completely understanding the too-scared-to-go-to-sleep-again feeling.  I think i dreamt of the end of the world."

I saw daniel hastings at blockbuster. he told me to call him, but he now lives in an apartment with carly helgren who evidently hates me, i'm not quite sure why, so i probably won't be calling him. he is kinda good looking though. it's not that i'm scared of carly or anything, it's just my dire resistance to the bullshit i'd probably have to put up with. aaahhhh...  i like my freinds so much more than everyone else.  why? because they're better. smarter, better looking, faster, funnier, stronger, more dangerous and nicer. everyone should be jealous."

"event","Walmart. With Sarah Braddy, whom many dislike, but i don't mind her, except for that ability to eat nothing but pizza and french fries and remain a size 00.  We shopped, it was fun, and while waiting on my parents to pick us up, we watched a guy storm out of walmart saying ""fuck this shit, fuck your shit, fuck my shit, fuck our shit, etc. "" you get the picture. And he headed up[ the center aisle of the parking lot, in plain veiw of everyone watched amusedly. Running after him were ten bald white guys with walkie-talkies. they headed out in a sort of star shape, at diagonals, away from the man, who was walking about angrily yelling loudly. Sarah and I watched as these ten guys ran around and looked for him, one at a time found him and gave up, then finally, ten minutes later, apprehended him after holding a convention in the ""park your cart here"" lot. c'mon walmart, use your brain.  it was funny. ahhh... the holidays. 

I baked cookies!!! lots of them:
white chocolate chip,
chocolate chip/pecan
wedding cookies (powdered sugar cookies shaped into little balls)
spice cookies
seven layer cookies
macaroons. 

if you want some, lemme know!!  I deliver!

I'll be at the landing tomorrow wrapping gifts, too, if anyone wants to get free gift wrapping."

on a happier note, tonight is amelia's party, bound to be the rockin'est thing all season. her peice in coffee house was awesome, but the book throwing was better in theatre history. it made contact."

"event","is almost here. this makes for mixed feelings. on one hand, i think i'm depressed. on the other, i like christmas and don't want to be down on christmas, i was once before and it's terrible.  this performance art thing is gonna be bad, for my group, anyway...  but never fear, ryanne ""is soooo awesome at this."" coffee house is friday, from what i've heard, it's gonna be pretty good.  

things like coffee house, when we get to see our classmates perform and be creative, things like that make me proud of our school. we have some kids with amazing talents. On another track, sort of, i never cease to be amazed by some of the technicians. they know so much about so many aspects of the theatre...  i want to know that much... 
but on the other hand, i'm tired of the ""you're stupid, why don't you know that"" attitude that i get when i work on something out of my element. That's really discouraging. I don't like to volunteer for jobs because i hate feeling like a failure when i don't do things right. i should be more bold."

then my mom looked really upset.  she liked my long hair. i kinda like it like this.  you'll all see tomorrow.

"event","my weekend was spent camping. very relaxing, but maybe a little too introvert. i think we should all go camping one weekend at Anastasia state park. it's in st. augustine, not too far to be a travel problem, but very much fun and on the water...  nicenice. and close to all the antique shops and strip joints. a well thought out location. 

so, if anyone agrees, lemme know and we can start with the planning. smores, and sleeping bags and relaxation. and of course, fire. and by fire, i mean, very little wood, very much kerosene, which seems to be the way fire runs with you guys anyway.   

on another note, i'm considering being a clothes designer. i would say fashion, but i really don't know what possesses some of them.   but anyway, i've started realizing that i look at people and see them in certain styles, and them i draw up these styles and in one case plan on making this dress for that person, though i haven't told them yet. i'm worried that if i give it to them, and it would be pointless not to, and they don't like it, or it doesn't look the way i wanted, this somehing i created, i'd be kinda sad. let down with myself, you know? so...  i'm still not sure what i'm gonna do."

the worst part is my aunt, emilee. his wife. she was heartbroken. i've never seen my aunt like that. she hadn't eaten in about three days, couldn't sleep, just cried or stared off. my mom had to give her zanax to keep her from getting hysterical, try to get her to sleep. i've never seen someone look so much in pain.

"event","Yesterday...ugh. Screw it. I hate even thinking about it. The whole day sucked. I failed that SS quiz because I didn't read the sections..I only read the one on mercantalism..and that didn't help. Then in bio..I kind of broke in half. It wasn't because of my quiz grade. I would be the stupidest person in the world to get upset over an 85 that she's probably going to drop anyway. (Although I told everyone it was that.) It was just life in general. I barely get 2 hours of sleep every night..and the work load is sometimes too much to handle. It was all building up inside of me..and getting my bio quiz back just made me crack. And then off to english..which made my day 100 TIMES WORSE. I think that I did good on the vocab quiz. It was easier than I thought. But that speech. I was already shrinking in my seat..crying because of my bad day..and she calls my name. So I just rose up slowly..took a deep breath..and told myself that I'll do the best I can. And I got up there...and of course she had to say something about how I wasn't smiling..and I wasn't in the mood to deal with that. Anyway..I did really bad on my speech...but what hurt me the most was when I was having a lot of trouble...and I looked up at Mrs. Searle..she wasn't even paying attention. She was looking out the fucking window. So I just said some bullshit and ran back to my seat. I barely wrote two lines for my exit pass..and when the bell rang I shoved it in her face and ran into Mr.F's room and broke out crying. We talked about it..then when I finally calmed down..there was 15 minutes left of the period. He asked me if I wanted to go back to math..and I said not really...and he said ""Yeah. Who needs math anyway,"" and let me stay. We watched a movie trailer...and then he went to tell Mr.Seipp that I was with him and I wasn't skipping. I don't know what I would have done if I had to sit through a period of math. I would have probably started crying in front of everyone and then I would have made an even BIGGER fool out of myself. Mr.F rocks like whoa. No exaggeration.  

And then 8th period..Shahzad cheered me up a lot.. We were on our way to the library..when he confessed that he was sick of going to the library..and he went up to Yanoti and told him that he was having a bad day..and so was I..and we just needed to go anywhere but the library..so Yanoti was awesome and gave us a pass to go to our ""locker""..and we wandered for the rest of 8th. We went into AP Stats for a bit. It was so funny. We just walked in and Mr.Cann didn't even notice. And everyone was talking the whole time..Me and Raashi and Sumanth were talking about Indian food..and weird words that sound funny when American people try to pronounce them.....and Sumanth and Raashi were boycotting doing the work until they found out from Shahzad (who isn't even in the class) that Cann was collecting it. Haha..then we walked out..and Cann still didn't notice. Oh man. That made my day. So I actually ""skipped"" two periods. I'm such a rebel.

Then I stayed after for film. And Mr. F was in a bad mood. I wonder if I was the cause of it. Soorryy if I was. 

Then I went to Tiramisu..and had dinner with Caroline, Marie, Vanessa, Debbie, Alex, Kelly, Lauren. Jade, Danna, and Johanna. And we missed the parade because Tiramisu doesn't understand the concept of speedy service. And the bonfire wasn't that good. Idk if it was just me..but it wasn't as fun as I thought it would be..anyway..I left early and just went home. I was really tired.. I fell asleep on the chase at 10 30! Guess all my tiredness caught up to me. 

And now..it's really lonely. My mom went to see my sister because she was in the hospital. Fucking people should know what they put in their shit. She even asked if the food had peanuts and they said no. And they were indians too. Fuck them. I would sue. Anyway..time to get a jump start on my SS dbq so I don't kill my self over it tomorrow."

I did bad on my math test. The question with all the limits? Yeah..that killed me. Everything else was easy. And in amnesty, Shahzad embarrassed me..just like he said he would. Because last night...I was freaking out because I thought I wasn't going to get my English essay done in time..and I wasn't going to come to school today...because I hadn't prepared a speech for English..or studied for math..so I asked Shahzad if i could still join amnesty if I didn't come to this meeting..and of course that was a stupid question..but anyway..he told me that I could..but in fact..he didn't want me to go...he wanted me to go home and sleep. And he said if I went, he would embarrass me! And I didn't take him seriously...but he really did! oy! Oh well. It was kind of funny actually.

I got my first 100 in bio today! Woo hoo!! And I went to ask her if she was going ot hold a review session for the test? And she took it in the sense that I definitely wanted to go, so I'm apparently going in at 6:30 AM on Monday. How dandy is that. Someone else please come. Being alone with teachers scare me...even though she is totally, awesomely nice. Yeah. Today I successfully failed the english vocab test, and the math quiz. Wonderful. I did ok on the Douglass test. Not as good as I wanted to though. And I gave the pic of Adam Smith to Mack today. I don't really know if he appreciated it or not. Maybe he did..but he didn't really show it. It seemed like he was in a bad mood today or something. But he did say that he was going to tell his father in law to blow it up. I was like..uhh ok..

I saw Mr. F twice today. The first time..I told him that I just finished failing my vocab test..and he said ""It's ok. All smart people fail Mrs. Searle's vocab tests."" Great. But then he said that I'll get used to the format and kick ass later on. I'm kinda doubtful about that. Then the second time, I told him that I just finished failing my math quiz as well...and he said that that was ok..everyone fails math. Ha! Idk if that was supposed to make me feel better or not. Oh well. 

This whole Bio lover thing is soo weird. He totally doesn't like me. That's just weird. I apparently think he likes James Kim. He is obsessed with sitting next to him all the time. And I have concluded that Jackson has a thing for Christine. But then Alex brought to light the fact that ""EVERYONE has a thing for Christine."" Hahaha

Woooo!! It's friday! Time to sit on my ass and do SAT homework??"

 So I think that this year is the one year so far that my schedule ALMOST worked out the way I wanted it to. I first had 2 electives...but I had to drop both because I didn't have a science...and then they put me in french 4? I was like..ok..that's one class I'm gonna fail. But anyway..my guidence councelor called and it's fixed..so here it is!

2-Spanish 4
3-Band

I know a few people in each class except Spanish! I don't know ANYONE in Spanish 2nd period. Please tell me someone has it with me! I don't wanna face Das alone!!

Yeah..so yesterday..I immed Sumanth out of the blue..and apparently he was in London the same time we were. And it was so weird..I was looking at his pictures..and I saw a pic of that kool millenium bridge we walked on..and I was like 
""hey! I walked on that bridge!..Went to the globe alot..we saw a play there.""
Sumanth: ""Oh me too.""
Me: Which one?
Sumanth: Much Ado About Nothing
Me: Whooaa me too..when did you see it?
SUmanth: uhhh 28th?
Me: Oh we saw it the 27th.
Sumanth: What day was that?
Me: Tuesday
Sumanth: omg. That's when I went...what show did you go to?
Me: Uhh..the evening one?
Sumanth: holy shit me too!
Me: what!

Yeah so apparently he was at the same show as us..at the exact same time...halfway around the world! I was like whooaaa... And he was sitting all the way to the left? And he never saw any of us! I was like come on now..how could you miss Ms. H...and all of us! I mean..we freakin took over every single place we went to! Haha. But anyway..I thought that was really funny. Argh! I soo wanna go back. Being home is no fun. And I still have to write my day by day account of the trip in here...hahaha! I was too lazy to do it before. Yeah..and I kinda still am.

I've been so overwhelmed ever since I got back. I still have so much summer reading to do..I haven't even started Social Studies. And I was reading it today..and it doesn't make sense..the theme part? And what are those numbers in the parenthesis? They don't go with anything. It seems like there is supposed to be another sheet with it..like maybe a study guide or something? Am I right? Did everyone else get more than one sheet? Damn..I'll be so screwed if that's the case. And English...ugh. I've been reading my book..and marking down quotes..and I've started looking for editorials..but that's about it. Just thinking about next year..totally sucks. I'm going to die...no joke. 4 AP's..Piano class...and now SAT classes two times a week...3 hours each...and they give shitloads of homework every time. And one of the days is a Saturday..right in the middle of the day...3-6 or something like that...so one whole day of my weekend is gone for 10 weeks. 

People who graduated earlier had it so easy. We're the first class that has to deal with all this new SAT crap...and all the tests are alot harder..so we have to work twice as hard to overcome the same thing that earlier people did by winging it. The new SAT includes an essay..that we have to right in 25 minutes apparently? I'm wondering if I'll even have my first body paragraph done by then. Blerg.

BUt I can't wait until Monday. The party will help me relax..alot. Even though I don't know how to swim...and I'm going to look like a complete idiot...oh well. At least I'll have all my pictures and we can all trade pics. That should be fun. 

Yeah, well I have to go take a shower and read more of my book. Oh the joy."

And I was looking at my duffle bag, and apparently there is no way to lock it? So that's wonderful. Now Europe junkies have open access to my bag and it's crap. And I was watching this thing on tv..I think it was on the news? But anyway, it was this whole think on hotel hygiene..and it totally grossed me out. Ew ew ew!! It was so disgusting.

It was sickening. They aren't THAT hott that there should be THAT many shirts about them. 

I hope everyone had fun on Wednesday!! Spider-Man 2 was AWESOME! So awesome, that I want go see it again! And again...and again...and again....and again. Oh man, I forgot how freaken hott Toby is. OMG he is my man. Along with Elijah. :) Haha. Then talking to Mr. F at odd hours in the night. That was funny. I really think he thought we were drunk. Ha. That's funny. Why would anyone think that!

I'm gonna use it to buy LOTR - The Return of the King extended edition..and then the rest will be used to buy Spider-Man 2 when it comes out!!! Woo-hoo!!! Yeah, I'm excited.

Thanks Kel! :) Yea, and it was really funny, because I forgot how to say ""to know"" in spanish, so I was sitting there in silence for like 2 minutes..and I was starting to get nervous, but then Catie Lambert came and started talking to Senora Clough, so that gave me more time to think! And then I finally said conozco, which means to know someone, and I was trying to say that my parents wanted to know what there was to do in Queretaro, which is saber, but anyway, she probably didn't even notice. She kept cutting me off in the middle of my sentence saying "" Bien!! Bien!!"" And even though she didn't give me my grade, I peeked at the paper while she was writing it. I got a 24/24! woot!

Social Studies was really empty today. It was weird not having Caroline there. It was lonely :( AT least I had Caitlin! I don't know what I would do without Caitlin :)

Oy. I have to go fix my english paper, and then study my ass off for chem tomorrow. I totally don't get it. I mean, I get some of it, but some of it is really hard.

On a better note, English totally made my day. We all sang the Yellow Submarine song! Ha! That was so great!

I will probably end up watching all the episodes I taped from last year. I also taped the Friends finale, but I haven't had time to watch it. 

So my sister is home from college now. She graduated on Saturday. And truthfully, its weird having her home. I'm so used to being alone at home, and its hard to share the house again.

In SS, I practically watched Big Mack grade my outline(because I sit right in front of his desk) and I got a 15/15 and I was really happy, because I had stayed up till 2:30 A.M doing it. Then Mr. Seipp wasn't there so we had this really weird sub. She was so stupid. She didn't know how to pronounce my name so she spelled it out. Shes like, ""Is S-H-I-K-H-A here today?"" She didn't even take a stab at it. And she did the same thing to Tarun. It was funny though. Then gym was fun because Kelly, Alex, Debbie, and me actually got to CATCH the damn frisbee. And then in chem, I got a 100 on that pop quiz we had. In health, we had this really easy test. Then, 7th period hits and BOOM, my day is ruined. This damn final is ruining me, ruining me I tell you. And then 8th period was boring. 

Man, you know how teachers make you feel like a complete and total idiot when you ask them for help? Yea, well that's how I felt at the end of the day, like a complete MORON.

Omarosa, man, that girl is one hell of an ass. But he picked her! Its not even like he got stuck with her. He PICKED her on his 2nd pick when he could have easily picked someone better. I mean, she lied to him twice, and I really believe that she was the main thing that brought him down. But on the whole, I agree that Bill was better. Isn't it funny how we can get so obsessed with TV shows? Like basically run our lives around their timings? I think thats so weird. 

So today, I was completely useless. The high point of my day was when this janitor at school started yelling his brains out at me. And the funny thing is, I didn't even do anything wrong. I just went to school to get my SS binder because I have a test on Monday and I needed to study, and somehow, I forgot it (God forbid). I just approached the freaken door and he went off on me about how the school is a closed building on the weekends and how this is the last time I will ever be allowed to enter the school on a weekend. So, since when did this rule take effect? Does anyone else know about this, or am I the only clueless one here? Anyway, after I got past the yelling, it took me about 10 minutes to open my damn locker, because the whole hallway was completely dark and the only source of light I had was the little bit of sunlight streaming through the closed classroom in front of my locker. So first I had to wait until my eyes got adjusted to the darkness, and then I finally got it open around the 10th try. Then it took me like 5 minutes to find my freaken binder. And when I walked back, another janitor had appeared out of nowhere and all I could could hear of their conversation was ""That's Bullshit!"" blah blah blah ""That's Bullshit!"" So anyway, I ran outta there as fast as I could, then me and my mom went to Walmart, and then I went home, and that was basically my day.

Its not that exciting to go there anymore since I've been there a couple of times. They added a couple of new rides though. Thats always fun. I just got two skirts. 

Anyway, in case you were wondering if I made a fool of myself at the show, I didn't. Phew. :) It was really good though. We all got to participate, Shelly, Lani, Rupa and me. But Lani got picked on the most. This guy was trying to act like an ape, and he came into the audience and like attacked her, then pulled a mouse out of her ear (it was fake, duh). It was so funny. Then this guy threw me this rope and told me to check it out because he was doing some magic thing. Then I had to throw it back and I was afraid I couldn't because the stage was higher, and I thought I was going to throw it and it was going to go like, two feet. BUT! I'm a better thrower than I thought. But holy crap. There was an intermission, and I went to go to the bathroom...alone....and all three guys were standing in the bathroom area playing funky music. It was so odd. There was this big line, and they were standing right in front of me the whole time. They all kept staring at me. lol. And then when people were coming out, this one guy had a paper towel dispenser in his acordian or something and he was handing them out. It was so funny. Overall, the show was hilarious. Its always good to laugh. I love comidies. Theres nothing better than a good laugh. I took a picture of the stage. So you all can see when I get back! (If anyone even cares) Its a very different kind of stage. Its cool. 

I saw Intolerable Cruelty. It was ok. I didn't really know what was going on at some parts, but overall it was...eh. I am going to watch Mona Lisa Smile tomorrow then go back to the movie store on Thursday to refill my stock. :) Do you guys have any good suggestions? I need a really good movie to see. Something that will blow my socks off. :D So if you guys know of any, spill the beans!

OOO I think I might be going to a Twins game! I'm so excited! This is going to be my first live baseball game ever! I hope I catch a ball! But since my sister doesn't have a mitt, it'll probably end up hitting me in the face. lol. They had one yesterday and they won. I think it was their first game of the season because they had fireworks at the end. Or maybe they do that everytime they win. 

SO I was listening to this radio station, and they were talking aboout some dream doctor crap, and it made me think of this dream that won't go away! I NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS! Its really bothering me. Its reoccuring. Are any of you good at interpreting dreams?

Diane Keaton was really good. It had a different sort of vibe. And Honey, I am kinda feeling that its not gonna be that great, but thats just a thought.

Man, I haven't updated in awhile. Lets see...oh yea, on Tuesday, I went to the library with Caroline and Caitlin. It was so funny. I have no clue what we were doing, but all of a sudden Fletch goes, ""I have a hankering for Olive Garden."" And then Caroline says, ""WHAT! You had a hangover at Olive Garden??"" Holy crap that was so funny. And then Fletch responded by saying ""No! But if I was to have a hangover, it sure as hell wouldn't be at Olive Garden!!."" That was so great. Yea, and then we got lost, because I told Fletch that we knew where we were going, but I later found out that we didn't. And so we got scared and started to sing, in the hope that our bad singing would ward off all the bad people. hehe. And it worked, because we weren't attacked! 

So today was like the first day all week that BIG Mack was in a good mood. He told me that the freshmen played an april fools joke on him, and he fell for it. Thats funny. I wouldn't have thought that he was the gullable type. hehe. 

I'm sooo happy! Spring break is here!!!! I just did like 50 loads of laundry. And I still have to pack, which is the reason I couldn't stay for film today. Apologies Fletch! But I have to leave my house at 4:30 in the freaken morning tomorrow!!!And then I have to find my gate all by myself. Scary. Damn, I'll probably get on the wrong plane and end up flying half way around the world knowing me. Ha!

ALL BECAUSE JOSH JINXED IT! BUTTMUNCH! My day was much worse than it sounds. Its hard to explain in words. All you need to know is that it sucked, MAJORLY."

"event","Today was kinda icky. I mean nice weather and all, just, sort of a bad day I guess. Started out good, then went totally downhill in 7th and 8th. In English, I got my essay back. Not my usual grade. I guess it wasn't the best I could have done with it. And 8th, Clough assigned us teams for this stupid game and of coarse, I was stuck with the idiots. (most of em) But, things started to look up later on. Film society was good. 

And I just came back from seeing Secret Window. It was pretty good. Unpredictable. But I kind of expected more out of it. I don't know why. I guess beause it was so highly praised. But overall, it was ok. 

So today was really nice weather. Part of me wants the snow back. I don't know why, but there is just something about snow that I like. Yet, the other part of me totally wants Spring to stay. 

Ok, so I'm finally doin it. Gettin my hair cut in a new kinda way. And since no one cared to give me their OPINIONS, I guess it will solely be based on mine. Can't wait to see how that turns out. 

Oh well. I have nothing more to say today. Oh wait, maybe I do. This week has gone by really slow, and next week is going to be very very bittersweet. A hell of alotta tests, yet, Spring break inchin closer every day. Ok, now I'm done."

"event","So, today was fairly interesting. I got up late, as usual, and I took a shower, then I plugged in my straightener, and then I started getting ready, and then I had breakfast, and then the bus came so I ran out. Then we had a Social Studies test(which was way easier than I expected). And I was in the middle of answering a short answer question when I suddenly stopped, looked up and said ""HOLY SHIT"" in a fairly loud whisper. BIG Mack just gave me a weird look, then went on saying some curse word or another.  So anyway! After second period, I found Kayla and used her phone to call my dad. Then my dad had to go all the way home to close it, and the whole day I was freaking out because I thought the carpet had caught on fire. But! It didn't. It just left a very small mark, but its hardly noticible. But Holy Crap!! It was very scary. Then the whole day, everyone (cough cough Caroline) kept saying how I had burned my house down. It was funny. 

So today in SS, BIG Mack called me obsessive compulsive. I thought that he went way overboard with that. And when I said that I wasn't, he said, ""Yea ok. Who are you trying to fool?"" I was just like  WHOA there buddy! Calm yourself! But I don't think its right that he judged me like that. If he wanted to he could have, just don't say it to my face! Its not like I say my thoughts about him to his face!!! And then! I was just looking at something on his desk, and hes like, ""I know Shikha, I'll have your paper by the end of the day. Calm down."" What the hell! Did I say anything? NOO! And then I said that I didn't say anything! And hes like, ""Yea well I know you were thinking it."" ARGH! No one knows what I'm thinking but ME! ME!!!!!! NOT YOU!!!! ME!!!!!!!!!! 

BUT! Other than that, today was a fairly good, extremely slow day."

"event","This has been a long week. And frankly, it sucked some major ass. All the field trips were cancelled, and the freaken science fair. I won 2nd. But 1st was totally within my grasp, if it wasn't for my first judge. God I hate that ass. I am seriously going to post alotta complaints, first about the judges. A judge should have qualifications to live up to. If the presentor is talking and the judge isn't interested in the project, at least pretend to be! God! My first judge started looking at the floor, and the ceiling, and everywhere but my project in the first 5 minutes of my speech. I wanted to punch the crap outta him! What the hell was I supposed to do? Its not my fault that my project wasn't of any interest to him. It shouldn't affect what I win, yet it did. The second judge was ok. Yet if both have them had stuck together, like they were supposed to, things would have been much, MUCH better. The person who won 1st in my category didn't deserve it. Not one bit. So basically, the science fair is no longer something that people do to simply learn science. It turns into a competition. And for all those who did their projects the night before, and still won first, don't worry, your luck will wear off soon enough. 

But! there is an upside to my crap of a week. I am still going to my sisters on the day I was supposed to! I'm not going to the regional science fair, even though I totally kicked ass in it last year. It now costs even more to change flights from morning to evening, so we're leaving it the way it is. :) And I am kinda mad that I can't go, but also, I am happy to get away from the competition."

"event","Gese luise. I have so much crap to do. Everyone I know has no crap and they probably enjoyed their day today. Me? I have been working on my Social Studies paper, and my science fair. I can't help it. I'm a born procrastinator. And I really have to change that if I am thinking of having a life next year with 4 AP's. (Is spanish an AP next year? If so, then 5) Oh gese, that sucks. 

So our field trip was cancelled today. I was really mad, even though I don't seem to be right now. That's because I already let out all my anger. Poor pillow. 

I missed piano today due to inclement weather. She always gets mad at me when I cancel. Today wasn't too bad though. But I'm still doing Sonatinas. They are getting annoying. There are about 5 variations for each key. It gets boring after awhile. 

Today, we watched this movie in Social Studies, and BIG  Mack told us how his favprite part is when this woman runs into barbed wire and almost gets decapatated. It was really funny.  

Yea, so I went to that website for English, and there is only one book on my author, and no books on my book. That SUCKS. It REALLY REALLY SUCKS! Now I have about 4 sources? 5 if I'm lucky. ARGH! Ok well now I have to go eat, and then study for chem, and then do Social Studies homework. Oh gese. Life sucks. (I say that alot)"

"event","Today is a good day. I have absolutely nothing pressing to do. If feels good. I don't have to do any of my homework because of the totally AWESOME fieldtrip we're going on tomorrow. Its nice to come home and do nothing instead of pulling my hair out because I have so much crap to do. 

Anyway, I'm thinking of getting my hair cut differently this time. I kinda want bangs.(Side bangs that is) They will probably go to my..nose? Idk. What do you guys think!? Bangs? No bangs? 

Ok I'm starving, I'm gonna go raid the kitchen."

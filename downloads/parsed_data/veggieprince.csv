"event","Hey guys. 

I leave Wednesday, and I haven't really said goodbye to most of you. It's been a ""i'll see ya before I go"" and I don't want things to drop off there. I'm going to be kinda busy tomorrow, so Monday may be the best day to gather as many of us as we can somewhere at least for a little while. Tuesday I may be gone with family, don't know. 

I do have an address that you'll be able to reach me at during Basic Training. We won't have computer or phone access during those about 42 days. If anyone wants to shoot me a letter, you can give it to my family or Hannah to send. It can only be on a plain white envelope with address, return address, and (preferably patriotic) stamp just like normal mail. You're not allowed to send anything with ""cute"" stickers on it, I get in trouble :). You can also send multiple letters in the same envelope if you want. I'd love to hear from you guys as often as possible, although my time to respond to mail is very limited. Once I'm out of Basic Training, I will have computer access and maybe cell phone and all those fun things. We'll see."

"event","Being faced with decisions you know will impact very directly the rest of your life, or at least your immediate future, is interesting. 

Contrary to my firm beliefs and to statistical chance, I have not only gotten a nomination from Representative Lynn Wesmoreland to attend the Air Force Academy, but I have gotten a Letter of Assurance from the Academy. This letter states that if I get a nomination, which I did, I am in the Academy for sure. 

I figured this would all be made easy when I got turned down. 

If I do go, I get probably the best education I could ever get, access to any resource I could need, and have it all for free (in fact they pay me.) However, it also comes with the four years of no freedom, constantly pushing myself to my physical limits, and being academically challenged (At the academy I'll be taking many many more hours of classes per week, over 20 I think. Makes the equivalent of earning like four minors.) 

On the other hand, I could go to UGA or GT. Plenty of freedom (maybe free time even). Do what I want (fo shizzle). But I'd feel lost in the crowd too, and the paying. Going into debt for me and/or my parents would be no fun. And I don't have the job safety, benefits, so on. Plus I would be able to maintain real life contact with friends and such. 

I am thus left to decide this monumental life choice, and it's no fun. I feel a lot more certain about how my years at a normal college would turn out. I think I could easily be one of the people that drop out of the Academy. 

I pray I am led to a path I won't regret."

"event","More attacks in London. Is the world going to wake up now? Is the world going to start to unite? When are people going to get by their little political differences in the name of the fight against global terrorism? 

If this country was united behind the war, wouldn't it be so much easier? If only those that never stop attacking our leader because of a political label would simply stop for now and support what we are doing. It's way too late to stop now, and you know if we pulled out the Democrats would never end the jeers and attacks. They want an 'end' to the war, but like hell they'd let Bush just pull out. 

It's kind of sad that when you go down the street or a parking lot and see a car with a ""Support our troops"" label, you pretty much know it's a Republican. I've only heard democrats make fun of those things. It's just like in the global scheme of things though, as people like Hillary Clinton will go over to the troops in Iraq and tell them they are fighting for nothing. Of course the AJC wouldn't cover that one. But media is a very large issue I will try not to go into yet. 

What are the democrats doing now? If you're a democrat and reading this and do not support the war, what are you POSSIBLY hoping to accomplish by attacking our leader and our global position? Why do you want to see us fall just to shove it in Bush's face? Stop blaming it all on the people that lay it on the line! Stop promoting this dissension! We're at war, support YOUR BLOODY COUNTRY!

I don't know why I suddenly got so tired of all this. It's all these desperate attacks I see on Bush and such on the news. ""OOOO OOO BUSH IS ONLY NOMINATING THAT D00D CUZ HE DOESN'T WANT US TO SEE KARL ROVE!!! OMGZ0R WTFMATE?"""

This video was made using a video game called Star Wars: Galaxies. It's just like World of Warcraft. All the 'moves' and such were in game capabilities. All the characters shown (besides the 'famous' ones like vader) are controlled by players. So yes, all the other dancers are real people controlling them. To dance all you would have to do is type /dance, so they organized this really really well. 

I think it's pretty cool some of the stuff people make in their spare time. This is really entertaining especially to me since I know how little they have to work with to make such a thing out of the game."

Still sitting around feeling drugged up. Happy gas stuff was cool. Put the mask on over my nose and after 5 or 10 minutes I was just kinda smiling at stuff. Then the doctor turned up the gas all the way and the next thing I know I'm vaguely feeling being put into a wheelchair, next I'm in bed. I don't remember much of yesterday besides Hannah coming over and giving me some magazines. Today I actually feel aware now, very bored. 

Oh yeah, I remember seeing that Sandra Day O'Conner is retiring. Let the political hellfire begin. I remember one news reporter saying this debate is gonna make the presidential race look like it was on Valium."

"event","So I feel that need to post again. However not one of those crappy ""post a quiz"" posts like I have been for almost every post on here :P. 

Where do I even start? I guess a self analysis would be good first. One quality I've noticed of myself is that I think a lot, perhaps way too much. I analyze some things to death. When I lie down to bed for the night I spend at least an hour just lying there thinking of things and making up things. Making up things like situations in my head where, for instance, my parents die and what I would be doing then. Or I get into a fight or something. It's bizarre and scary too. I make up these horrific realities in my head, like a daydream but it's always a nightmare. As I type this I'm realize that these times that I make up my own ""scenarios"" or ""realities"" It's always negative and...bloody? I mean, sometimes I lie awake thinking of this ""reality"" for at least 30 minutes. I get completely lost in it. As I said, horrible scenarios like all of my family dying or friends dying, or even going to something like the school under attack or something. That one might sound funny, it's just weird though. I imagine myself in each one of these scenarios as some kind of hero or victim. It happens every night too. I've really begun (is that a word? oh well who cares how I'm writing) to think things are really mentally wrong with me. Sometimes when I'm driving and approaching a stop sign I see images in my mind of me just...not stopping and running right through and crashing. I'm not suicidal, I promise. I've kinda digressed from the feeling of thinking I think too much, but this kinda has to do with it anyway. 

What else though? That wasn't a very fun topic. I've ranted about how I think most things we do in school are useless. Especially stuff like math. Yay, I get to figure out what the graph of a sine function is like. All this crap I've had to learn would apply to about 5 careers at most. Yet I am forced to do it. And I can't wait until next year. Since I got fucked over in 5th grade by someone that decided I shouldn't be in the upper level of math I can't take AP Calculus next year unless I get a 100 in Adv Alg/Trig which is impossible. Thus, I get to be one of the seniors in AP stat that everybody made fun of. Hell yeah. I might not even fit into AP Stat and go to Stat/Discreet. Even better. I bet that'll look wonderful on a college resume. Thanks Board of Education for screwing over my Math course path. I really appreciate it. I think it's great to throw in this completely useless form of Math to screw up EVERYONE'S pattern of math courses. 

School dominates too much thought though. Pah. It's time to let me decide and let me go my way to learning what I need for my future. I have to stop posting now, more probably on the way. If I still feel this...open. Rare time kids."

"event","I think if I won the lottery or something and I got really rich, I would try becoming nocturnal. Wouldn't that be kinda neat? Have a house that blocks out all sunlight and sleep during the day, then come out at night. It would be really random since there aren't many places you could go and stuff. If you could get several friends to do it with you it would be much more fun. It would be nice and quiet though, no stupid kids in your neighborhood outside or dogs barking and crap. Plus people would think you were really weird because your lights would be in all the time in the middle of the night.

"event","HAVANA (AP) - Cuban President Fidel Castro's advancing age - and ultimately his mortality - were brought home Thursday after he fractured a knee and arm when he tripped and fell at a public event.

In a communist society where the 78-year-old leader has played a larger-than-life role for more than four decades, the tumble was the latest reminder that Cuba's commander in chief is an aging man who will not live forever - with an elderly brother as his designated successor.

""I'm all in one piece,"" Castro declared on state television Wednesday night after tripping on a concrete step while returning to his seat after an hour-long speech in the central city of Santa Clara.

A medical examination early Thursday confirmed Castro suffered a broken left knee and a hairline fracture in his upper right arm, said an official notice carried by state media.

""His general health is good, and he is in excellent spirits,"" it said, adding that Castro hoped to be ""back in place"" soon.

""He asked that it be made known he is in condition to keep overseeing fundamental questions in close cooperation with government and party leaders,"" the statement said.

Parliament speaker Ricardo Alarcon, who has been by Castro's side more than four decades, said Thursday he was confident the president would recover quickly.

""He is a man of much strength,"" Alarcon told international journalists in Havana.

Nevertheless, Castro's tumble - captured by Associated Press Television News, but not shown by state television cameras - was sure to cause speculation about the communist leader's health after 45 years of ruling this island of 11.2 million people.

Castro's health has long been closely watched - particularly by his political enemies in Miami, home to a large Cuban exile community.

""Sometimes, people have this idea that he's some sort of god, that he's omnipotent,"" said Yanisset Rivero, spokeswoman for the Cuban Democratic Directorate, a Miami group that supports dissidents on the island. ""It's a sign ... that he's human.""

Rights activist Elizardo Sanchez of Havana predicted the incident would not immediately affect government policies, but it ""does put on the agenda the theme of the advanced age of various leaders.""

In the last several years, Castro's knees have seemed more wobbly, his step less steady. Nevertheless, he maintains a busy schedule that frequently includes all-night meetings with aides and visitors.

Average Cubans did not seem as alarmed Thursday as they were three years ago, when Castro fainted in the scorching Caribbean sun during a live televised speech before a crowd of thousands.

""He needs to get well soon,"" Georgina Hernandez said Thursday as she walked on the streets of Old Havana. ""The Cuban people need him and need him to last a long time.""

Taxi driver Emilio Lagos said, ""I hope he will have good health for at least 20 more years.""

""He's our guide,"" added Fermina Pino, a middle-aged Cuban woman.

In Washington, the State Department declined to wish a speedy recovery to Castro, who has remained in power during 10 American administrations.

""We, obviously, have expressed our views about what's broken in Cuba,"" said spokesman Richard Boucher.

The June 23, 2001, incident in which Castro collapsed behind the podium several hours into a speech prompted many Cubans for the first time to reflect on, and openly discuss, Castro's mortality and their country's future.

Castro's designated successor has long been his brother, 73-year-old Defense Minister Raul Castro, who fought with him in the Cuban revolution that overthrew President Fulgencio Batista on Jan. 1, 1959.

Raul Castro is first vice president of both the government's ruling Council of State and of the Communist Party - directly after his brother. The constitution does not specify a No. 3 in the presidential succession.

Also mentioned as possible successors have been Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque, 39, a former personal secretary to Castro, and Vice President Carlos Lage, 53, who as Cabinet secretary has broad experience in helping oversee the economy and government.

Exclusive APTN footage of Castro's fall on Wednesday showed the Cuban leader tripped on a concrete step after descending the stairs from the stage after a speech and fell forward, hard on his right side.

Cubans watching on state television did not see the fall, only several security men running off to the side.

Aides and security agents immediately surrounded the president and helped him to a folding chair.

""I will do what is possible to recover as fast as possible, but as you can see I can still talk,"" Castro told television viewers, sweating profusely into his olive green uniform from the pain. ""Even if they put me in a cast, I can continue in my work.""



And the picture you've been waiting for!

Ronald Reagan died today. He holds the record for the longest living president being age 93. Maybe this is just my conservative side speaking out here, but this news made me kind of sad in a way. Thinking about how corrupt our government is and all the crap that we go through with it all. Reagan is listed as one of the greatest presidents every easily. That is very surprising considering most of the media, the ones who post such lists, is die hard liberal. It tells you something when the ""symbol"" of the republican canidates is considered so great. 

It makes me really mad sometimes when I'm surrounded by people ignorant of what's happening with our country. Like in my spanish class I had to tell everyone who the people running for president were. Some of these people were of voting age! 17 of the last 23 or so presidents were taller than the other canidate, and if they weren't taller it is admitted their hair was ""nicer"", like Nixon :P. The leaders of our country are being voted in by an overwhelming majority of idiots. Plain and simple ignorant idiots. There are very few people that vote that really have a good, unbiased clue of what's going on. I won't even get started about the media. Good lord...

How do countries survive like this for so long? It's amazing to me really. How have we not collapsed yet? Our government is seperated by this great schism. Democrats vs. Republicans. Each one is die hard against the other. God forbid they work together to make our country better. No, because they are a democrat/republican they are apparently the enemy. We laugh at thinking of the past where they had the ""primitive"" government of a monarchy. We laugh at the ""primitive"" ways of ruling without a government (communism) or by a group of people and not just one person (consuls). But is this really better? To have almost the entire country voting for one person because he is the leader of the party they might as well have chosen by flipping a coin? Take one of my friends, for instance, that happens to be a democrat. He would never on his life vote for a republican. If the democratic party made some random drunk guy off the street the presidential canidate while the republican party ressurected Ronald Reagan, he would vote for the drunk guy just because he's a democrat. Sounds stupid right? No logic right? Sadly I would say at least 80% of the voters out there are like that. 

One of these days it's going to hit us and hit us hard."

I GOT A SWORD!!!

It's hard to describe the hilt design, some cool animal with wings like a dragon. The blade is about 2'4"" and a little more than an inch wide at the widest part. The scabbard has these cool designs on it also. My dad dulled it so I won't chop a limb off or something, but it's nifty anyway. 

I also went 3-2 at the districts debate. If I had my real evidence and Hannah was my partner I probably could have gotten to nationals! Oh well...I did something in a round that has made me a kind of debate god. Can't explain it since no one would understand, but 10 minutes after the round I heard groups of people talking about what ""this one guy"" pulled off in a round :)."

I guess I'm unbanned from the computer now. Got a fun new game, mass killing of course. *Wishes he had a sword*

What else??? Superbowl was okay. I'm very disgusted with the half time show. It's sad humanity has sunk to the level of celebrities ripping off their clothes, ESPECIALLY at the one (probably) most watched event of television. All those families with their kids getting exposed to that junk...it's truly horrible. I'm embarrassed to be of the same SPECIES of scum like that. That's not the only bad part of it though, all of what they might call dancing was bad. I would say it was closer to sex standing up. *sigh* Humans are stupid. Or is it just in America? 

Oh well, life is crazy. Trying to deal with everything I go through, take things easier. Got the state debate tournament to work at this weekend, shouldn't be too bad to do. Until next time!"

"event","&nbsp;I honestly never thought I'd be such a laggard in my own wedding and renovation plans!<br /><br />I mean, when it comes to school/work, it's full steam ahead. So I naturally assumed that when it came to my own ""Big Day"" and ""Personal Space"" plans, I'd devote my undying passion to planning every micro-detail to the <em>n</em>th degree. Especially considering I have a deep love for home decor.<br /><br />Well, even I surprise myself.<br /><br />Not much has moved since we made up our minds in April to purchase the house. It's like exercise.... ""I'll do it next weekend....and next weekend....and next weekend."" Which amounts to, like, never. We haven't even decided on a date yet!<br /><br />Not that we don't try. We do! But it's a real pain juggling work and planning. I mean, after a long day of slogging in the office, all I want to do is go home, watch TV and sleep.<br /><br />I truly admire those who successfully juggle career, family, baby, and elders. I can't imagine doing it.<br /><br />Guess penning all these down ain't gonna help move mountains and get my home beautifully renovated like a showflat, nor get the church and dinner venue booked.<br /><br />Just gotta get our collective arse moving."

No reason why really. It's just one of those rare passing moments where you feel all serene and peaceful...and the mind and spirit are momentarily freed from the everyday burdens of life.

Just thinking positive thoughts, enjoying a soft breeze and calm ambient music, and simply enjoying the peace within.

This moment won't last long. But I'm savouring every second of it while it lasts."

"event","Sitting in a movie theatre and not knowing what show you're gonna watch is pretty fun! I think it was the first time I've ever experienced that. Mark had planned out the whole of yesterday, so I didn't have to do anything except relax and just enjoy a day that has been mapped out for me.<br /><br />Turns out the movie was <em>27 Dresses</em>, a movie that I had been thinking of catching. Despite some poor reviews, I thought it was kinda fun to watch...and I felt that Katherine Heigl (did I spell it right?) and James Marsden had great on-screen chemistry, and the dialogue wasn't cheesy. So I felt that the movie was a good choice for an easy Saturday afternoon.<br /><br />Did some shopping at Orchard, which was quite productive. Bought a CD, and Mark bought me a book and some herb vitamin that is supposed to improve sleep. And then he took me on a very short bus ride to I didn't know where for dinner, which turned out to be Dempsey Hill Green. Ate at RedDot, which had a nice casual ambience and rather good brew (according to Mark anyway, 'cos I don't drink at all). The food wasn't very memorable though...but still, it's a nice place to have a relaxed meal.<br /><br />And then he brought me to this wonderful place for dessert, which was just a short walk away. La Fondue!!! The service was excellent, and the nutty chocolate fondue pot that we ordered was fabulous. It tasted like liquid peanut M&amp;Ms, with small chunks of peanuts, pistachios and hazelnuts mixed in. A platter of fruits (oranges, grapes, kiwis, pineapples&nbsp;and strawberries), marshmallows, small chocolate brownie pieces, custard puffs, small pieces of bread, and&nbsp;two scoops of vanilla ice-cream. Sinful decadence!!<br /><br />The service at La Fondue was downright excellent, which is so refreshing in&nbsp;a quality service-starved country like ours.<br /><br />Mission: to try the cheese fondue for main course next time we go there!"

"event","<p>Just watch it. Seriously.<br /><br />After spending yesterday morning at the spa in Pan Pacific (which was nothing great), Mark and I zipped off to Cineleisure to catch <em>The Kite Runner</em>. We are huge fans of the novel by Khaled Hosseini, and were looking forward to the show. It did not disappoint one bit.<br /><br />The movie kept so close to the movie, it really felt like you were reading the book all over again. And I love that...I'm guess I'm a purist kinda person...if I love a book, I want the movie to follow the book exactly!<br /><br />I think practically the entire theatre was weeping during the particularly emotional scenes. And we left the cinema feeling thoroughly satisfied, our emotions all in a turmoil. But in a good way.<br /><br />After shopping around Orchard, we finished off the day with a beautiful dinner at Samy's at the Civil Service Club on Tessensohn Road. Fans of Indian food will enjoy the yummy grub at Samy's! Delicious naan, fish curry, chicken curry, tika chicken and cauliflower....gobsmacking!!</p>"

"event","<p>I love this time of the year where it almost feels like the world is winding down together with the year. It's almost as if one has run a lengthy marathon, clutching a stitch at one's side, and can finally actually see the finishing line.<br /><br />The cold and wet weather, albeit being troublesome at times, is a real treat as well. No more sweaty and sticky shirts, frowning against sunrays, headaches, and irritable moods. It's now all steaming hot cocoa, warm blankets, great novels, gift-wrapping, holiday-dreaming, and the scent of wet grass. Unfortunately, it also comes with clogged-up air passages, nose-blowing, and a general reluctance (read: laziness) to go to work (like today!). Somehow the weather in Singapore seems to always be at extremes.<br /><br />I find myself at a point in life where I keep looking back to the past....like the biblical story of Lot's wife who looked back over her shoulder although she was instructed not to. I yearn for the relative freedom of youth, yet I know it is time to let it go and move on. Yet, I realize that I have no dream, no goal, no ambition...nothing that spurs me on to move forward. I'm learning over time that one&nbsp;of the hardest things in life is having a dream. Isn't it almost counter-intuitive? I'm not referring to simple wishes...but real dreams that while difficult to attain are not humanly impossible. For example, some people dream of being a professional musician, an artist, a teacher, or they dream of <em>doing something grand.&nbsp;</em>Yet I find I have none...and it's like being stuck in a time warp; one cannot move back, yet one does not want to move forward. And yet the clock ticks and the tail end of youth is slipping by...like the last dregs of tea in a cup...at 24, it somehow really feels like it's time to be an adult. Yet, I do not feel any older or smarter or wiser than I felt when I was 19. The seductive equation between Age and Wisdom is indeed fallacious.<br /><br />I was commenting to Mark about how we have a sad tendency to get so wrapped up and engrossed in being moody and miserable, that on hindsight, you realize that these are the very happy moments in your life that create fond memories. In a very odd, strange way...this is so. How as a student, I used to bemoan studying, rant and rave about the academic work, whinge about being poor as a church mouse. Yet now, when I look back, I recall those days fondly...and I remember only the good things about the student life.&nbsp;Wil I look back at&nbsp;this current state of unhappiness five years later and reminisce fondly too?<br /><br />As I entertain such (silly?) thoughts, it is precisely why I always love this time of the year. The time to review, take stock, think, and perhaps...<em>just perhaps</em>...be brave enough to grow up.</p>"

"event","Indeed. It's been quite some time since my last post, and lots has happened since. So much so that it feels somewhat surreal. I feel almost like a spectator of my own life; or rather, I feel like a spectator of other people's dynamic lives. Any drama or happenings in my life are very much by proxy; I am not the centre of them.

Yes. As I look back at the last 14 months at my company, I have to admit that I am growing very cynical and jaded. Much to my alarm. I do not like being this way, and I will try not to become this way. But it is growing increasingly difficult not to become&nbsp;a horrible person when people I encounter don't give two-hoots about being horrible to me. And I'm constantly amazed at how terrible people can really be!! From mildly inconsiderate to downright rude to your face. Does basic courtesy even exist anymore?

Hmm,&nbsp; I guess it's not very nice to make my first post in a long time such a whiney and sombre one. Sad to say, I have no energy to expend to cook up something more palatable. Maybe tomorrow. Or not."

"event","Mark and I just came back from a 7-day trip to Bangkok. And once again, BKK never disappoints!<br /><br />This trip was made even more enjoyable as this time, Mark's friend who is a Thai, brought us to dinner twice. The first dinner was truly memorable - we took a water taxi down Chao Phraya river to a quiet local restaurant by the river. After a yummy meal, he took us to a quaint little dessert place where we wolved down three cakes. And boy was the hot chocolate delicious!<br /><br />The trip felt like a decadent break from work - everyday do nothing but eat, shop, sleep, watch TV, and go for massages. We are, sadly, very broke people now. But it was worth it. And the Bangkok Sale was now on! Of course, sales don't apply to Mahboonkrong - but they certainly were aplenty at Central World Plaza! Mark and I love Central World Plaza like crazy - the gorgeously designed shops with amazing visual merchandising was a feast for the senses! And interesting events are scattered throughout the mall, from dance performances to tennis competitions. It was just wonderful to just walk the mall and see what else was there to explore.<br /><br />And I bought a pair of Geox shoes which turned out to be a life saver for the whole trip! I've always wanted a pair of Geox due to their supreme comfort. However, it costs about $300 per pair in Singapore. The prices of Geox are so much cheaper in Bangkok. Coupled with&nbsp;a 30% discount due to the Bangkok sale, I got a pair for just $100.<br /><br />One of the best things we did was to visit the Sea World. Cheesy and touristy as it may sound, it was really spectacular. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing, but one that we'd never regret doing. Somehow these places bring out the children in us, but it was so damn fun. The coolest displays there include a Chevy that was converted into a fish tank. So you see a real Chevy car with red fish swimming inside. Other similar displays include refrigerators, washing machines, and microwave ovens all converted into fish tanks. Super cool. The whole Sea World was so well-designed and beautifully maintained, that it can surely give our Underwater World a run for its money.<br /><br />Mark and I binged on a lot of ice-cream. And I mean a lot. We ate ice-cream everyday. We had Haagan-Daaz, Baskin Robbins, Cream &amp; Fudge Factory and iBerry. IBerry was a recommendation from Mark's friend, and it's apparently the latest fad. The outlets are gorgeously designed. The Cream &amp; Fudge Factory was quite interesting too - you get to pick mixes (e.g. brownies, Kit-Kats, cookies, nuts, sprinkles, etc etc), which the guy/gal will mix into the ice-cream on an ice-cold metal table.<br /><br />And what's a trip to my beloved Bangkok without my mango sticky rice? That alone is enough to put a smile on my face all day.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Mark and I have invested in a brand new DIY desktop! YES!!!!!!!!!!! We are so in love with our spanking black CPU-and-monitor combo. Quite proud of our little accomplishment as well. His pal, Nick, accompanied us to Sim Lim Square where, with his great advice, we picked out different hardware components to create a real juggernaut of a computer that can handle any computer game with ease. As tech idiots, we were somewhat intimidated about having to format the computer ourselves. But it was surprisingly quite smooth, and we learnt a lot from it. So no regrets there despite putting in the extra effort. It kinda makes the computer more of your own rather than something entirely store-bought.<br /><br />The computer is so fast! 2GB of RAM, the latest model ATI Radeon graphics card which has 1GB of dedicated RAM, 320GB of harddisk space, etc etc. What a beauty.<br /><br />When I installed my SIMS and saw it...really saw it for the first time, my jaw dropped. Literally. I could see my rivers and ponds <em>reflecting</em> the sky. I could see the tiny boats on the coastline actually <em>sailing</em>, and they too were reflected in the oceans. The gameplay speed is breathtaking, the graphic details awesome. The same goes for Mark's strategy games like Command &amp; Conquer.<br /><br />We topped it all off by buying a brand new Samsung LCD 19"" monitor.<br /><br />Totally worth the $1,600!"

Also spent the morning recounting portions of the book, re-reading selected chapters together, and basically raving about it.<br /><br />We will be re-watching <em>Order of the Phoenix</em> later this afternoon, simply because the book made us inspired to want to watch our favourite characters all over again. Despite what the reviews may say and how a lot of people feel about the show being ""too dark"", ""too dreary"", ""too boring"", ""a disappointment"", I loved it.

Two days one night of happiness!&nbsp; We arrived at our hotel at about 10am Batam time. Couldn't check in, but it didn't matter as we didn't bring any luggage apart from a a couple of backpacks. We took a quick tour of the medium-sized resort, and were extremely impressed with the range of facilities, level of service, as well as layout of the whole place. Perfect!<br /><br />A beautiful free-form swimming pool was the centrepiece of the resort, complete with a water slide, jacuzzi, and fountains. It was so inviting we just wanted to jump right in! The air was fresh, the people friendly, the decor charming. The staff were extremely helpful. One of them even spent 10 minutes explaining to us about all the facilities available, which was quite exhaustive. There is an indoor swimming pool as well! Nowhere near as nice as the outdoor one, but great for rainy days. Other facilities include tennis, ATV dirt biking, bicycling, a free gym, games room, lounge, KTV, library (where you can rent DVDs, PS2, etc), etc etc. Lotsa things to do! Best thing of all? There was a huge area dedicated to the award-winning Tea Tree Spa! It was beautiful.<br /><br />First thing we did? Book ourselves a spa package for the evening!!!!!!!!!! Wasn't cheap....about $120 per person. But how could we go there and <em>not </em>enjoy a spa? We then&nbsp;went straight for lunch as we were starving. After which, we hit the games room to kill some time before check-in time. Mark and I were the only one in the entire room! So we had all the privacy in the world to laugh, play, shout, and just run around like kids. We played pool, which is something we always enjoy immensely. We tried our hand at darts, but we both sucked haha! And we played a bit of electronic games.....those are pretty outdated though. After which, we rented the table tennis table. We were damn lousy, but after a while, we got the hang of it and it got really fun! We spent most of the time picking up the ball though......but we laughed so much and just enjoyed ourselves.<br /><br />The moment we checked in, we changed into our swimming attire, slathered on sunblock,&nbsp;and ran straight for the pool! Woo hoo! The sun was pretty strong by then, but the pool area was still quite empty. Borrowed towels from the pool counter and chose a couple pool recliners under a nice big umbrella. Spread our towels on it, lay down on it for a while, and then jumped into the pool. The jacuzzi was pretty strong, which Mark absolutely loves. He's a jacuzzi person. We had a smashing time at the pool slide!! It's really quite cool! And can get pretty scary especially as you pick up speed towards the end. =) We were like kids!<br /><br />I did a few laps before joining him at our seats. We ordered a couple of thick milkshakes to sip as we suntanned. Oddly enough, although the sun was quite scorching, neither of us turned remotely darker! No suntan, no sunburn, nothing. I was quite surprised. Nevertheless, the 3 hours we spent at the pool were dynamite! We also reserved seats for the BBQ buffet dinner. That was quite pricey too, at $31.90+++ per person. Didn't care...we just wanted to enjoy.<br /><br />Back at the hotel, we took our baths and called room service for a salad to share. Ate and watched a bit of TV. Oh yes, there's cable TV. They even show Channels 5, 8 and U there!<br /><br />Close to evening, we headed downstairs to the Tea Tree Spa for our wonderful pampering session! Body scrub, floral bath and aromatherapy massage! There's a silly grin on my face just thinking about it! The aromatherapy massage was the best man. It was even better than the one in Thailand!!! Both of us fell totally asleep in the middle of it...that's how relaxing it was! And I'm the kind who seldom ever feels relaxed! I was just completely knocked out and slept like a baby. Didn't want the massage to end.<br /><br />What better way to end off the night than with a sumptuous meal? The buffet was okay...not spectacular. But the service was excellent, the ambience fantastic, and best of all, the place was quiet. Had freshly cooked steak, large sausages, chicken wings, etc etc. Very very serene. Very very happy.<br /><br /><strong><u>Sunday</u><br /><br /></strong>We woke up early and went for breakfast at the cafe. Unfortunately, the crowd surfaced then. In a sense we were lucky. We reckoned most of the crowd had gone shopping on Saturday, which would explain why the place was so empty then. Most people probably chose to stay in on Sunday, which was ok for us, given that we were checking out that day. After a leisurely breakfast, we went to our room, where Mark turned on the TV and to our surprise, one of our favourite Korean dramas, <em>Story of a Bright Young Girl</em>, was on Channel U! This time, Mark enjoyed it even more as there were English subtitles =)<br /><br />Checked out at 11am, and took a shuttle bus to Mega Mall at Batam Centre. Nothing much to do there. But Singaporeans were flocking to the donut shop! It was a pretty cool donut shop with a large array of donuts and really nice decor. We bought a dozen. there were Singaporeans who snapped up boxes after boxes! On the ferry back, we saw a lot of those boxes of donuts hahaha.<br /><br />Arrived in Singapore at about 5pm. Quite tired by then....but very satisfied =)<br /><br /><strong>Next trip: BINTAN!</strong>"

"event","Based on the drawing and the 10 answers they gave this is a summary of their personality: 

Your house tells the world that you ought to be a leader. You are a freedom lover and a strong person. You are shy and reserved. If you've drawn a cross on each of windows, you always want to live alone. You are very tidy person. There's nothing wrong with that because you're pretty popular among friends. Your life is always full of changes. 

You will avoid being alone and seek the company of others whenever possible. You love excitement and create it wherever you go. You have a strong personality and you like to command, influence and control people. 

You added a flower into your drawing. The flower signifies that you long for love. It also safe to say that others don't see you as a flirt. You don't think much about yourself.

Yesterday was really nice. The morning started off on a sian note 'cos I woke up early at 8am to write papers for work. Did my work all the way till lunch. But I was glad I did it because it allowed me to spend the rest of the day enjoying myself without having to think anymore about work.

Mark and I went to my granny's house in the afternoon. Cousins L and E and their husband and boyfriend respectively were there. We played mahjong....so fun! My luck was really good....I won the most. I realize that playing mahjong really took away my stress as I focused all my thoughts on the games at hand. So happy. Even better was being able to spend time with my granny and see her enjoy our company. We ordered pizza, and everyone tucked in. Granny loves pizza. Mark and I also bought a tub of chocolate ice-cream for everyone to gorge on for dessert =) So happy.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Today, I was determined to leave work early, i.e. before 7pm. And I did it! I left office at 6.50! I was quite disoriented for a while when I walked out of the office to see the sky actually still bright. It's usually nightfall by the time I leave office. Bought some curry puffs for Mark's family and headed to his home, where his mum was whipping up a yummy dinner for us.

She fed us with punggol mee goreng and sichuan soup until we were so full we couldn't walk. After hanging about a bit, I came home.

I realize that it's the ltitle things like these - dinners, games, etc - that make one look forward to each day after work.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Going to play Feeding Frenzy now....CHOMP CHOMP!"

"event","<p>The Chinese New Year holidays have been a great break from work. A much needed break indeed!<br /><br />A lot of feasting, sleeping, merry-making, shopping. Loadsa fun.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Saturday was family day. My mum, sis and I woke up bright and early (8.30am!) to go to Cartel for breakfast. Somehow my mum really loves Cartel breakfasts. So we ate until we were all too full to have lunch! Picked dad up at 9 plus and we headed to Vivocity. Going out with my sister is hazardous to my bank account. Somehow you can't go out with her and not buy anything. I ended up splurging $120 at Marks &amp; Spencer, and would have splurged even more if I hadn't put my foot down and insisted I don't grab the clothes I had initially reserved at Principles.<br /><br />In the afternoon, my sis, mum and I made chocolate. It was a super simple thing lah. Just mix and mix a whole pot of melted chocolate, stir in some butter, throw in some toasted almonds, and pour everything into mini cups. Voila! Instant sugar fix for all!<br /><br />Reunion dinner was the usual small but nice affair. Eating, chatting. Spent the night watching <em>The Incredibles</em> with my cousin C in my room. The night was topped off when I received a bite from the dreadful Maltese. The bruise on my leg is now bigger than the size of my palm. It looks dead awful and I doubt I can wear skirts or shorts for at least a week more.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Sunday was an extremely lazy day. I did nothing but sleep and sleep and sleep. I played my Sims!!! YES! First time I've played Sims since starting work! And it was my first time trying out Sims 2 Pets. I made a Jack Russell for my new Sim =) Still not as beautiful as Sundae!!<br /><br />I drove out to Mark's place in the evening. Picked him up and headed for his Aunt's house, where his parents and brother were visiting. Very simple end to a very simple day.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Yesterday was the main CNY celebration day. As usual, everybody (aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents) gathers at my place for mega feasting and gambling. We had a new activity as well - Bingo! It was quite fun, especially since I won a few rounds. You can win quite a lot with Bingo!<br /><br />Mark's brother came as well. Quite a surprise actually, especially since he was the one who brought up the whole issue of wanting to join us. My family's the open kind....anyone can come if he/she wants to. And he fit in quite well. I guess gambling does that hahahaha. Just plopped down some cash and you're part of the family!<br /><br />I lost money as usual. But it's okay. We only do this once a year, and it's all in the name of fun. We don't gamble for the sake of it. It's just a really good bonding activity.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my damn sinus kept acting up and&nbsp;I was so physically drained from all the honking and blowing and sniffing that I K-O-ed at the end of the whole day.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Today was nice. My parents headed for Batam, so we had full use of the car. Mark and I woke up early to go to the beach for some bowling. We're really lousy, but it was so fun! We then visited his friend's H's house. It was a nice, short visit. Good to just catch up.<br /><br />We joined my sister at Centrepoint for lunch and some shopping. Mark was so sweet. After sis left, we shopped around. He bought me a pair of In Line pants at Robinson's. It's originally price at $139, but there was a 70% discount. I bought myself an In Line skirt. And then he bought me a pair of Nine West shoes because I couldn't decide between two pairs that I liked. So I bought the other pair. Both were at 50% off, so each cost $77.50 after discount. Quite good buys I must say. And so pretty. But I still feel guilty that he paid for the stuff. Must stop spending!<br /><br />We went to Casuarina for dinner. Yummy prata!! But parking was a nightmare....so packed!<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's back to the grind tomorrow. It's too depressing for my poor heart to contemplate. Time for Sims!</p>"

"event","MERRY, MERRY, MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY!<br /><br />Go eat, drink, and be <em>really</em> merry!<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />The annual family Christmas held last night went well. Lotsa people. Lotsa food. Lotsa PRESSIES!<br /><br />The games segment (newly introduced) went unexpectedly well too! I think my aunt's neighbours must have been wondering where all that screaming, cheering, and claping were coming from! Never has my aunt's home seen such excitement! I thought everyone was very participative in the Pictionary and Taboo games. They were enthusiastically shouting out words, drawing pictures, describing words, booing other teams, cheering their own teams. Thank God for that, or else Mark and I would have been very sian hosting Pictionary. Made the long hours I spent preparing the game the night before the party all worth it. I do like my family; we're a pretty young, spontaneous and fun-loving family.<br /><br />Of course, the highlight of the night was present-opening! As usual, there was a humongous pile of hundreds and hundreds of presents, which took a full 15 minutes for 5 people to distribute! And altogether, everybody starting ripping packages, tearing paper, and marvelling at our individual hauls of gifts.<br /><br />I had a good haul again! I always get a good haul because it's usually a 2-in-1 celebration. I received 2 really cool watches! One from mum and one from L&amp;S. Gorgeous, they are! And other stuff like shoes, a Mango handbag, a Chomel handbag, a prettily hand-painted clothes rack, a pink Tommy Hilfiger polo tee, earrings, handphone charms, Body Shop moonflower set (my favourite scent!), a very unique magnetic paper holder (great for the office), etc. AND a number of ANG POWs!!!<br /><br />Also received nice gifts from friends and colleagues. They include necklaces, earrings, chocolates, cookies, key chains, hand creams, a shawl, vouchers, a notice board, lamps, socks, tealight holders, a photo frame, lip gloss, hand wash, a crystal-studded pen, a pouch, and a fabulous book on interior decor! Thank you all!<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />I'm flying off to Bangkok in about 5 hours! 7 days 6 nights in Bangkok! It's like a dream come true.<br /><br />I'm going off to finish my packing. Take care, people. Hope you have a sweet Christmas full of fun, love, and joy. And a happy, fruitful, and healthy new year ahead!"

WHOOPPEE!!! Hallelujah!<br /><br />I need to recharge recharge recharge, so that come 2007, I'll be raring to go! 2007 promises to be painful for all of us in The Organization. We need all the energy in the world.<br /><br />Mark and I are planning to go for a 6 day trip to....where else! Our favourite Bangkok. Not enough dough to go anywhere further, really. BUT! Bangkok is our absolute favourite place, and we'll go for massages <em>everyday</em>.<br /><br />But that is IF and ONLY IF his boss gives the green light for him to take leave.<br /><br />We're fervently praying said green light will be given by tomorrow morning!! Tickets are selling like hotcakes, and it's pretty scary when you see the price of the same ticket rise within 15 minutes.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />I think I would be pauper-broke if not for the year-end bonus! Mark and I bought so many additional presents today! Luckily we started Christmas shopping over a month ago. I think this year has the biggest haul, all because we have more spending power now than ever before. It's taking all my willpower not to spend all my income!<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />I'm hungry for waffles."

Had a really rough Monday. High stress, low spirits. Thank God I have a good friend in my colleague...we can just rant together. Will be really sad when she leaves....and she will! It's just a matter of time.

Tomorrow's gonna be another rough day.

Can't wait for Wed night when Mark will be home again.

Will go shopping by myself tomorrow after work. Am really looking forward to it! My colleague (the abovementioned one) has given me a 50% discount voucher for G2000 and U2 for up to 10 pieces of clothing. Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I enjoy shopping alone sometimes...although I'm not looking forward to the crowd.

"event","<p>It's sooo important to catch your boss (immediate one or BIG one) when he/she is in a GOOD MOOD!<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Mark and I had a superb weekend. As in S.U.P.E.R.B.<br /><br /><br /><strong><u>Friday</u></strong><br /><br />After coming home from work, I took the car, picked Mark up, and then we went to Bedok South market for dinner. It's been ages since we've gone there to eat!!&nbsp; So happy. Reminds me of those days where we had so much time to just go everywhere to eat lunch or dinner.<br /><br />We decided to try our luck with Ikea Tampines, but bypassed it when we saw the long snaking queue that began from the TPE into Tampines. So we decided instead to go to Tampines St. 32 to buy toiletries. Toiletries there are damn cheap! And we bought 3 DVDs, including <em>Happy Feet</em>&nbsp;and <em>Step Up.<br /></em><br />We watched <em>Step Up</em> on Friday night but both of us got seriously bored. It was so dull! Should have watched <em>Happy Feet</em> instead.<br /><br /><br /><strong><u>Saturday<br /><br /></u></strong>We had a Din Tai Fung craving. We both used to dislike Din Tai Fung because their soup la mian and xiao long bao are not as good as Crystal Jade's and the menu is slightly more expensive. But ever since my colleague insisted that I try the fried rice and other dishes, we gave it another chance. And presto! We fell in love with the food!<br /><br />So we headed to TM, where we had a yummy lunch. I love the dan dan mian!! So peanuty! And their pork chop is fantastic.<br /><br />We walked off our full stomachs and ended up emptying not our stomachs, but our wallets! Went to Springfield, where we bought tops for my dad, Ed, and Mark's brother. Super burnt pockets. Mark bought a Springfield top and a Dockers pants for himself. So he spent even more than I did! Having bought so much stuff, we brought them back to my place. Spent a couple of hours at home, where I wrapped the presents as we watched <em>Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest</em> on VCD.<br /><br />We headed to Parkway Parade, simply because we missed the place! Had Swensen's for dinner because I had $30 voucher. We walked&nbsp;around but didn't have much time to shop. I dropped him off at Simpang Bedok where he met his friend to watch soccer together over a prata supper. I went home and relaxed.<br /><br />At almost 11pm, I drove out, picked him up, and we went to Dempsey Road. Went to this cool place overlooking a hillock where he had wine, I had fizz, and we had a tall chocolate cake. It was so wonderful, especially with the cool night wind under the stars and facing nature. It was truly blissful. I think the car is soooooo damn useful to a couple.<br /><br /><br /><strong><u>Sunday<br /><br /></u></strong>Sunday was good too. We had a simple lunch at the coffee shop, and then headed to Marina Square. Blew money again!!!!!!!!!! I bought myself a BYSI purple top, while Mark bought me a skirt. He's been over-pampering me. He even paid for one of my two new pairs of shoes! One cost $79 and the other cost $99. I'm so poor. *sob sob* He bought himself a Zara shirt........that guy is becoming mad about Zara. You can tell he's been really buying lotsa clothes. He even wanted to buy a pair of Geox shoes which cost way over $100.<br /><br />We had zhi char dinner with my maid. Came home, dumped stuff, relaxed a bit, and then we took a night drive to Ikea Tampines...just to try our luck again. Managed to get in without a hitch! Parking was free too.....but I bet they'll start charging some time next year.<br /><br />Ikea Tampines was like a blown-up version of Ikea Alexandra. Exact same layout and concept....I felt like I was in Alexandra! Just browsed and receed about. Was tempted to get a quilt cover for only $15 but resisted the urge.<br /><br /><br /><strong><u>Today<br /><br /></u></strong>Super bad case of Monday blues. Damn sian.</p>"

"event","Mark and I took our leave in lieu of Deepavali today.<br /><br />Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful day.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />We played badminton last night with my cousin E and her boyfriend W at the CC opposite my house. It was really fun! Without a shadow of a doubt, I was the weakest player there. But Mark was so sweet about it. It's a demonstration of how patient and sweet a boyfriend he is when he pushed aside his naturally competitive spirit to simply smile or give me words of encouragement whenever I lost the shuttle (which was 75% of the time). And he spent most of the two hours doing most of the running and hitting for our team, covering me the entire time. Best of all, he didn't complain at all when we lost the second match. Although it really was a miracle we even won the first one muahaha! Not that it was even a real competition in the first place. It was all in the name of fun and exercise. I'd much rather get my exercise via playing a game than doing something like running, for which I totally lack the requisite discipline.<br /><br />And I finally bought a new pair of sports shoes (a grey and yellow Reebok)!<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />We went to Marina Square and Suntec&nbsp;today. I just love Marina Square. It's so much more dynamic and better designed than Vivocity is. Somehow I don't get sick of the new Marina Square.<br /><br />Had a great lunch at Kenny Rogers too. Being the first customers, all the sides were served piping hot! And lunch deals are always good.<br /><br />We each also&nbsp;bought a pair of work shoes. His was already disintegrating, and every single pair of footwear I own hurts like the devil. Unfortunately, my left foot is an entire size bigger than my right foot, which makes walking really painful because either my left foot is scrunched up in a too-tight shoe, or the arch of my right foot is aching from having to hold on to a too-loose shoe. I found a good, solid pair today, and Mark ingeniously suggested adding a sole padding to just the right side! What a simple and logical solution, and I'd never even thought about it! How stupid of me!<br /><br />We've also concluded that stores that sell pricier goods tend to have very snobbish sales staff. It's deplorable. It's not like we demand first class service or anything like that! All we want is to be treated equally to the next customer, regardless of how ""rich"" we may look. That's also just basic courtesy. All that sycophantic pandering towards ang mohs and Japanese just made me feel so irritated especially when we were served with the same salespeople with lacklustre attitude.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />We've booked tickets to <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm over the moon! We blew $162 in each of our pockets, but I don't care! I've been dying to watch it for ages!"

"event","First off... <br /><br />Happy 25th Birthday to my darling!!!! <br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br /><br />We celebrated Mark's birthday yesterday. By a stroke of fortune, he returned from his business trip at 12 am yesterday. <em>Just</em> in time for our small celebration, which had been planned way in advance.<br /><br />Mark bought me a few goodies. Foodstuff included green tea cookies and green tea leaves. I believe I mentioned before that Hangzhou is famous for its tea, silk, and West Lake. But the two things I absolutely loved was 1) a small hanging ornament with my Chinese characters finely written onto it, and 2) A beautiful Chinese fan with a fine painting on it. I'm starting to get very curious about China, and would love to visit it.<br /><br />He had a fruitful trip. It was just a short trip, but already I can sense a very subtle difference in him. All that interaction with foreign delegates has made him even more curious about foreign lands and people, more open, and more network savvy. I think it's wonderful.<br /><br />We celebrated his birthday by having a sumptious buffet dinner at Straits Kitchen. I've blogged about this restaurant in Hyatt hotel some months back. We booked a table about 3 weeks in advance, simply because you can't get in without a reservation. It's so popular because the diversty is excellent, it offers a widespread variety of Asian/local food, the decor is charming, and the service is impeccable. The waiters were so prompt, efficient, and warm. They even took the time to stop and chat with us, asking us whether we enjoyed our dinner, making special recommendations, and even going into details about how some of the food was prepared.<br /><br />By 8pm, the whole place was jammed pack. But still, the service continued to be good. Always polite, always with a smile. It makes me feel proud, especially since this was in a hotel, which hosts foreigners on a daily basis. It's so important, good service. If only companies just invested a little more in producing quality service; the long term rewards far supercede the cost of building up a service-oriented organizational culture.<br /><br />We ate for over two hours until we couldn't walk anymore! Between the two of us, we had prawn mee soup, laksa, chicken satay, char kway teow, fried rice, oyster omelette, man tou, rojak, Indian food (naan, prata, murtabak,&nbsp;tandoori chicken&nbsp;and a range of delicious curries), sambal goreng, goreng pisang, bo bo cha cha, grass jelly, sago in coconut milk, durian ice-cream, ice kacang, pandan kaya cake, mee jiang kueh, sugee cake, kueh lapis, egg tart, and fruits.<br /><br />Yes, we ate a lot, but we didn't even manage to eat everything that was available!! There were just far too many choices! We skipped most of the Malay rice and dishes. If I go back next time, I'll try that as well as the chicken rice. Very satisfying. Well worth the $38+++ (i.e. $44.30) we paid per person. I highly recommend the Indian food. The chef and waiter recommended the butter curry chicken. It was divine!!!! So tasty! It's apparently their specialty that must be served everyday. The fish curry was also very good.<br /><br />But, as with all good buffets, one cannot go back very often. Not only would one be broke, one would also put on weight in no time. Not to mention get sick of the food. Once or twice a year is enough.<br /><br />And what's a small birthday celebration without a glass of wine? We topped the night off with just a glass&nbsp;each of&nbsp;sparkling wine that Mark bought from Duty-Free =)"

It's exactly 1 month since I started working!<br /><br />A month on from the beginning of my working life, I must say that I'm no less green than I was a month ago. Still wet behind the ears, feeling my way around blindly. But I can't complain much. I like this job and what it entails.&nbsp;I like the fact that it isn't too deskbound, nor is it too mobile. Just nice for someone like me. I also feel some sense of ownership because I possess my own portfolio. That's the good thing about my division: everyone has his/her own unique portfolio. And I must say that I inherited quite an interesting one. And&nbsp;I absolutely love my working environment.<br /><br />I'm super lucky to have two very good support staff who have, together with my supervisor, held my hand along the way. I'm starting to appreciate just how important it is to have good subordinates. Whenever one of them is on leave, I feel like I have no hands and no feet. Or rather, I feel as if my hands and feet are bound together. That's how the other managers feel as well. Our support staff are our legs and hands. They do a lot of the minute operations for us which make them immensely valuable.<br /><br />My supervisor has been good as well. She's strong-willed and I do feel somewhat intimidated by her. But she's a nice lady who knows what is going on. And she isn't the kind to come breathing down your neck either, which is&nbsp;wonderful.<br /><br />~~~~~~<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'm so glad it's Friday tomorrow.

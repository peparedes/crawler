Well I will start with friday because thats basically the farthest back that i remember. Friday right after school i go to my car and hop in ready to drive home right... WRONG it wouldnt start. I tried to jump start it i tried everything nothing worked i was soooo pissed. Alex tried to help but o no it still didnt work. Lindsey Kemmsies my love tried to help me and&nbsp;whatever it was broke! so she took me home instead and since the plan got screwed up Allisons grandma had to come pick me her and Mal up at my house all the way from grossmont and takeus up to her aunts house in Lemon Grove. SO we thanked her for the ride and then we started helping get ready for the party!!! We all really were tired and so we were out by 1030 but my mom called me at 230 in the morning and so i talked to her for a lil... yeah were odd. Then Saturday we went shopping and i found the cutest purse o yeah way cuter then all the rest what now BiTCH! haha so i didnt spend NE money which was really hard for me. Allisons aunt, the sweetest person ever, bought me a lip gloss from mac and i love it its hott. then the party was that night so we were all getting ready, and what did i&nbsp;do? well allison and mallorie invited their boyfriends so i had to bring some1 and the person i really liked was unavailable so i asked... u guessed it MANNY. hmm what a mistake? o yeah so i dont really want to talk about the party like at all it was fun when all the guys left and we were dancing with no inhibitions (((ooo big word go me))) we all made about 58 dollars so it worked out pretty good... sunday was relax day yeah and today at school was cool i love michelle and sarah spanish is my favorite class after math even though i think that the teacher could jump off a cliff... o and apusg is my 2nd fave so spanish is really 3rd but whatever. But right now im just thinkin bout the boy who is on my mind lately and hes real fun so yeah love all of you!</P>

AHHH hanging out with Nick and CHris and Jorel and all them well i never ever get to see them considering they graduated... the last one of them i saw was nick when i went with pete to his house.

But anyways <FONT color=#ff99ff size=4>Mallorie and Allison</FONT> mean the world to me. I think that i would go psycho without them telling me that ""shes"" a bitch and who cares about her and ""hes"" stupid dont like him they save me and everytime i dont listen to them something shitty happens i.e. JOSH and MANNY lol but whatever they like who i like now and thats all that matters right?</P>

Haha we are goin to look so hott this friday i cant freakin wait!!</P>
<P>SaturDAY---slept in then i went to my best friend Lexxis house. She's a different kind of best friend shes like the one u have all thru lil kids till middle school then she gets the nerve to move all the way to el cajon and i dont get to see her that often but i still love her to death So we watched the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and just hung out for like 6 hours. She was on Vicadin because she just got her wisdom teeth removed. We had long talks about her college and my high school crap lol then i came home to get ready for Justins took a shower at like 5 and went to get Allison at 7 and we came back to my house and i said FUck my hair because it still wasnt dry so it went up into a HOTT messy bun lol We went to Justins I danced my lil heart out and omg I freakin love SARAH GIRTY AND KRISTI BROWN o and BRANDON and JESSALYN cuz i got to hang out with all those awesome people for a whole night it was great then me and allison came back to my house had a talk about some certain boys and watched the sisterhood of the traveling pants I &lt;3 that movie!</P>
<P>Today--- was boring because all i did was wake up take allison home&nbsp;[[we got dippin dots on the way even tho its no where near her house]] and came home and relaxed all day so i got bored and decided to do this.</P>

"event","So you wrote it down
I'm supposed to care
Even though it's never there
Sorry if I'm not prepared
Is it hard to see the things you substitute
For me and all my thoughts of you
It's eating me alive to leave you

Maybe it's childish and maybe it's wrong
But so is your blank stare in lieu of this song
Maybe it's childish and maybe it's wrong

Don't wanna be, don't wanna be wrong
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this song
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be wrong
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this song

I'm breathing in your skin tonight
Quiet is my loudest cry
Wouldn't wanna wake the eyes that make me melt inside
And if it's healthier to leave you be
May a sickness come and set me free
Kill me while I still believe that you were meant for me

I'm finding my own words, my own little stage
My own epic drama, my own scripted page
I'll send you the rough draft, I'll seal it with tears
Maybe you'll read it and I'll reappear
From the start it was shaky and the characters rash,
A nice setting for heartache where emotions come last
All I have deep inside, to overcome this desire
Are friendly intentions and fairweather smiles

And I don't wanna be, don't wanna be wrong
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this song
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be wrong
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this song

Like Saturday night I'll be gone
Like Saturday night I'll be gone
Like Saturday night I'll be gone
Like Saturday night I'll be gone before you knew that I was there 
 
thats totally how i feel today i got dresscoded already had a horrible morning started crying b4 school got in a fight with my mom and got my teeth filed so much they got part oh my gums and then it started bleeding and my stupid ortho's like  ur crying soes it hurt.... no fuckin shit sherlock ur gashing into my gums duh its gunna hurt fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lo siento por la mala lengua pero eso es como me siento. shizzy"

Taylor kept stealin my beanie which i stole from my bro and so we were wrestling and i won by a lot i fricken pushed him off the bed and sat on him lol then we had a pillow fight and it was me and kristin versus sharla and taylor and sharla was sitting on the floor laughing so i was hitting taylor and he had a body pillow so he was cheating and then he tackled me on the bed and we tipped it over and the sodas all fell on the floor!!!! woops it was all his fault. lol then i felt kinda bad cuz it seemed like i was flirting with him but i promise i wasnt so i went with kristin and sharla to go get ice cream i dorve kristins car and it was raining and i was accidentally wink wink goin a lil fast lol it was soooooo funny to watch kristin so we went to the drive thru dairy queen ... in el cajon my brilliant idea and the guy was like arabic and we couldnt understand him funny! then we were on our way home and sharla saw joshs truck at sombreros so we decided to stop in and say hi. Well when we were getting out of the car sharlas like its manny josh and sam well when we went in there there was no sam but there was this other guy and we though sharla thought the guy was sam so we started laughin and sharlas like i swear that she was here so we think maybe shes in the bathroom and i go over that way and i twist the knob and it was loCked then all the sudden she came out and we started cracking up they musta thought we were sooooooo&nbsp; high but we werent lol so we laugh then we left and we were halfway to lindseys and were like do u noe whatd be hilarious if we went back soo.... we did and when we went in this guys like i didnt know it was my birhtday to us and we started bustin up again lol then u hear sam go ughhhhh cuz she realized we were back hahaha stalker girl must hate me now more then ever hehe so sharla gets a churro and kristin goes pee and we go and talk to josh and we walked with manny to the bathroom and sharla went in there with him (stalker girl was not to pleased) then sharla came out and manny locked the door lol so me and josh were playin pin ball and the stupid hitty thingys kept getting stuck so we were kinda hittin it and the lady yelled at us . SHarla was gunna have sum of joshs burrito but sam threw it away so she couldnt so then we leave and i honked at them. SO we get back to lindseys and it was time for me and kristin to leave so we told our story then lefted and went home and i talked to brandon till 230 and then he hit on my mommy!!!! ewwwwwwwww but me and kristin told him that we would go visit him at work when chris was workin and we juss wouldnt acknowledge chris.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>so sunday--- we woke up and it was 1130-ish so we decided to get ready to go visit brandon so we did and then we drove up there in the rain and walked all around viejas to get to nautica and then we saw him and gave him hugs and then we tried to ignore chris bvut when sum1 gives u a hug its hard to ignore them so we were talkin to brandon and askin when he got his break and he said in a while and chris is like i get mine sooon too and we can go to lunch then he asked if we had our phones and we said yeah so we went shoppin fo my bro and then&nbsp;chris called my cell and told us he was at rubios and if we went hed buy us lunch. Neither of us like rubios but we dropped in to say hi to brandon and decided not to be total bitches and ditch chris since id told him wed go. So we went and sat down at a table and chris came and sat next to kristin and this guy idk sat next to me and like 2 min into lunch chris gets a phone call ... i wonder who. So hes talkin to his girlfriend for 15-20 minutes and me and kristin juss keep lookin at each other and laughin. Then i was juss lookin at him and hes like why are you giving me a dirty look well if i was i had perfectly good reasons but i wasnt and hes like ur no fun so whatever and kristin says something bout how he asked us to go to lunch wit him yet hes on the phone the whole time and hes no fun so he gets off and hes like there is that better and me and kristin both said no at the same time lol so he finishes and gets up and hugs kristin and she kinda hugged him back and he came over and hugged me and i juss sat there cuz i was pissed hes like i hate u blah blah blah so then we walked them back to their work and we went shoppin and brandon said hed have his break at 2 when chris got off so we went back at like 2 and us and brandon went to subway and he offered to buy us sandwhiches but we juss wanted drinks so he got that for us and we had sooooooooo much more fun with brandon and i got up to&nbsp; get him and drink and he hit his hand on the lamp over our table so we started laughing and all the people looked at us twas soooo much fun and we sent chris a loving text saying we had an awesome time thanx for asking us to go to lunch wit im and thanx for talkin on the phone the whole time we luved staring at ur hickey... i mean ""burn"" So then we walked brandon back to his job and went to the car then went to submarina lol we had three lunches today it was cool but then we came home and she left to go chill wit her mom and i stayed home took a nap and watched some of the game overall the weekend was way confusin fun pissy and sucky but im glad now cuz writing all this just makes me laugh at how dumb this drama crap is lolol and how funny it was when sam said ughhhhh when she realized wwe were there again</FONT></STRONG></P>"

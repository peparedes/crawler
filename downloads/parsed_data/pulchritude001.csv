"event","""You've Got A Way""
     Shania Twain

You've got a way with me
Somehow you got me to believe
In everything that I could be
I've gotta say-you really got a way 
You've got a way it seems
You gave me faith to find my dreams
You'll never know just what that means
Can't you see... you got a way with me 

It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love 

You've got a way with words
You get me smiling even when it hurts
There's no way to measure what your love is worth
I can't believe the way you get through to me 

It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love 

Oh, how I adore you
Like no one before you
I love you just the way you are 

It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love 

It's just the way you are
   

moving on sucks...."

"event","Things havn't been going to well. I need to change my group of friends. I don't want friends that talk about me behind my back and than act like everythings okay. I don't see why friends would do that to eachother. and then they think you don't know there talking about you. and I need to get things back together. I have a bunny now. Shes so adorable and her name is chloe!  I also want to stop going to towson and no more drinking. I have two years of high school left and i really need to do good in them so I can actually do somthing with my life. I'm going to take these kick boxing classes with Shelly when she comes back again because she's coming back to towson. I need some kinda excercise since I'm not going to school all day. and that was always fun and I can go swimming:) tehe.

"event","well some shit has happened.. kinda sucks. well today I went to the school for meet for a recomendation of expulsion. At the meeting we discused what I did wrong and shit. It sucked. and if you dont know the story its basically I went to school they said I smelled like pot and decided I was stoned and like examined me and did testing and searched me and I hid everything but a tin thing with res in it and some metamorphine or whatever the fuck it is. So I have to night school now on monday and wendesday, and I start 11th grade back in towson in september:) but I might have to stop smoking because I might need to get yurinated loln thats icky. but ohh well.. I'm kinda happy I dont have like expulsion on my record lol. there just putting on there that for excused reasons I was issued to night school. but yea that all kinda cool I get to sleep everyday till like 11 or 12 and still go to school:) I am going to be with a bunch of dumbasses who got expelled well I cant say much because yea, but they'll all probaly have big mouths and shit because this is at kenwood (white trash) so the only difference between them and me Is I'm not going to talk to any of them. tehe ;) unless there really nice tehe!!well I felt a update was nessacary so peace out!


by the way.. I'm trying to give myself a possitive optimistic outlook on this because I fucked up and all I can do is try and straighten out so please dont leave any negative comments because I dont give a fuck lol I've probaly already heard it :)

It was all like we both did a little.. like the time we got snowed in at sweeties and had to lick videogames to make them work and we memorized the skit to lilo and stitch and now that is my favorite movie... we were stuck their in a snow storm, with the little annoying kids, licking freaking video games and getting scratced by cats!!! lol heres the cat that scratched us

James came home with me after that because he decided fuck school I guess. After that James my mom and I did some shopping at target. It was all so fun. we came back to my house smoked some and chilled together for a while. Then we decorated my christmas tree and after that we did the big tree in the living room with robby and brea. That was alot of fun. Then we watched a movie. Robby came in with the Idea of going to this gas station that sells pieces so I was like cool and we went but couldn't find it and then decided to go to pasta mista. So we did and then we came back to my hosue and watched the rest of the movie.. After the movie we went to take James home and his stomach was hurting...

"event","Today was an okay day, but saturday was definatly one of the best days in my life. I woke up (at sweeties) and cleaned the upstairs with Diane. After that we took Diane to get her hair done, while she was getting it done me and india walked around the shopping center. We went into rite aid and she got a book and crayons. Then we went to 7 eleven and she got a slurpee some chips and I got some playing cards. Then we went back to the hair saloon and played cards until Diane was done. Afterwards, we stopped by my house to get some things, then we picked up James!! so I had my two favorite people to spend time with. James and India. We went to towson mall to get India two books. We left the mall and went to taco bell, India was swinging on things and fell I felt so bad but I held her and she eventually stopped crying. James kept doing the sweetest little things like holding the doors open and throwing away my trash and being such a gentlemen. well after that we went to the park. I chased around india and pushed her on the swings while James talked with Diane. after that we went back to sweeties. James Diane and myself smoked in the garage and played with the cat a lot lol. James is really scared of the cat. It was cute though. Diane went to buy a shirt and James and myself watched India. then the rest of the kids got home. James played video Games with Baby B and India and myself played library and then me and Dainelle sat in her room and palyed with the hampster, It was fun. James came upstairs and I wouldn't let him leave or go away from me. I wanted him around for the rest of the night. by then it was 8:30 and Diane was about to leave to take him home and I was like ohhh noo!!! Then Billy was like I'll take him home so Diane can just leave. So James got to stay until like 11:15, but I couldnt take him home with Billy because I had to stay and watch India plus Billy was going somehwere after he took him home... I felt really bad. All of saturday I kept thinking ""wow I definatly have the best boyfriend ever, I never would of though one year ago that this was were I was going to be, with James hendricks at my grandmoms cuddling with him never wanting to let go ever, no matter what got in my way I would find a way to stay with him and not let him go"" everyday I like him more and more. Well now after talking to him this much I want to cal him so am going to. well okie that didn't work he wasn't home. tear! but his mommy said she would have him call me. well I'm going to go and watch some tv or something.

"event","I had a cool weekend I guess. Friday I tripped with James Becki and Justin and the beginning of it was great we went to the woods and becki wrapped herself around a tree and I thought it was the funniest thing ever, but right before that James and Justin went exploring... and be and becki chilled and then she had to use the bathroon so I was in the woods by myself starring at leaves. everything had faces, it was cool. Then we walked back to my house and it was the longest walk of my life because, It seemed like it was forever.  when we got back to my house we all layed down. james kept asking what time it was every minute literally and he didn't look like he was okay I was so worried. afterwards I guess I passed out but next thing I knew I was in my mom's room laying on her bed with becki next to me crying and laughing at the same time telling me it was just a bad trip. and I kept asking when it would be over and becki said  dont worry its going to be alright and I kept saying ""you promise?"" my vision was blurry and when I wanted to talk only half of what I wanted to say came out right or even came out at all. for some reason the thought that I was dieing kept hitting me because my mom kept saying shes burning up.. I remember repeating James's name and wanting him to come to me.. he did eventually but my mom told him to go back into the room and when he walked away I started crying. I eventually got up and went into my room with everyone else, James was in there which made me happy. I layed down next to him and we layed there for a while and I kept repeating his name quietly most of the times he didn't here me and when he did he looked at me, which was all I wanted I just wanted to see him. I was so scared the whole time I was worried and paniced but James was there so I felt fine while I was with him, but the expierence was a horrible one. I really did not like it... after the shrooms wore off we went to towson. I felt depressed and horrible, like I was the ugliest person alive and I just wanted to cry for no reason but I was with James so I held back. About two hours later I alot better. Mrs. Katie picked me up from towson at 10:30 but I was alone from 9:30 till 10:30 but I phoned with Jamie and then I found some people to talk to... I was really scared being in towson without James for some reason? I went back to mrs. Katies and went to sleep around 2, and woke up around 6 because I had to go babysit Regina's baby while Mrs. Katie helped Regina clean her house. The baby was so precious and I love watching her, she kept looking at me and Regina said she liked me because she usually cry's when people try to hold her. That made me very happy. I got to feed her and stuff and then when I burped her she spit up on my brothers hoodie (which I was wearing) but oh well lol I washed it. after that I went back to Mrs. Katies and James's mom picked me up. I was so happy to see my baby. We went back to his house and chileld up in his room for most of the day.. I loved it. it was so much fun. We layed down and I went to sleep while he was rubbing my back and then he put his hand on my face and held it there I felt so comforted. and I don't know if he just layed there while I slept on him or if he slept to? I know after he got up and came back I was laying down and he layed with his elbow on my mid back and his head on my back and I was like yay! We played some tony hawk lol. Later it started storming and we layed down through that to then I fell asleep again. I wonder if he minded me sleeping? I doubt it but I was probaly a bor to him. >_< I hope not though. when I woke up we went downstairs and sat in the living room waiting for it to stop raining and it rained a little and we figured it was safe and well when we got to towson it started pooring but it was chill anyway. we hung around with David and Pat, that was fun to. later that night we went onto the library rooftop and smoked some. it was fun. David pointed out how pretty the sky was and I was loving it. James and I started dancing which made me happy, I thought it was adorable. then we both went out and looked at the sky together. I loved it. Just standing there with him was great. then he went back in and I stayed out there looking. We then went back to to the spot and sat there for a little while.. everything was wet and I froze the whole time but it was okie James hugged me alot. ::BODY HEAT::! which was cool. Kate walked over to talk to me and I was talking to her for a little while. I love her! later on Mrs. Katie picked us up dropped off James and then I went back to Mrs. Katies with Justin and got onlnie a little then went to sleep. this morning I was awoken by mrs. Katie screaming and I didn't want to be involved so I called my mom and she came and picked me up. I went home and talked to James on the phone a little then had to go to work. Work was cool though. I got off at 3 and then came back home and well I'm here now. and thats all I'm doing probaly for the rest of the day. I'll updat again another day. chao!"

I sat on the computer with Katlyn on the phone and It was so funny, first I burnt my tongue with my soup, and after that I found the big spider in my room and it scared me because it's so big! I didn't kill it though that would be mean. so I sat at my computer talking on the phone with my glasses on and my soup at hand, also listening to country really loud. Out of nowhere like 30 minutes later James came up behind me and bent over infront of me and scared me shitless, I didn't even hear the door open or anything. It was scary! but I was like yay James! 20 minutes after that he had to go home, which made me quite sad, because I wanted to chill with him alone a little before he left, but It was chill anyway. He is going to come over tommorow If he can and we can hang out. I love it being just him and I. He is such a sweetheart to me. So respectful, caring, nice and I could go on forever but I'll stop. well maybe forever? but whats forever for if love never lasts? It's so rare for two people to spend their whole lifes together, and I guess I have a long time to decide who I want to spend the rest of my life with. Who knows? but for right now and hopefully a long time I've very content with James. He is such a polite, caring, lovely, adorable, sweet and all around awesome gentleman. He has his own uniquness that no one would ever think he had unless they got to know him the way I do. I feel so special being someone he is comfterable with and feels he can talk to. At a first glance I doubt James would think of me the way I am and I wouldn't think of him the way he is. I'm so happy that I have a chance to get to know him outside of that equantence stage. I think the reason I am so comforted with him is because in the beginning of our relationship was him being somenoe I wanted to have so bad but jsut couldn't and I would never want to feel like that again, never to feel that I can't have him, because I want to always have him and I always want him by my side there for me whenever I need him... well I'm done now because my sweety just got online so toodles!"

I've slept a lot though. I really want to talk to James tonight, but it's 11 and I doubt he is going to get online or call me tonight, which makes me quite sad. I don't want to go to school monday, and even though its still a day away I'm already dreading it. Aquashia is currently laying on my lap eating a medicine pop with me and red is laying on the floor with his head on my face. well I'm done buhbye."

"event","I guess I'm just a typical teenage girl. I have a stepfather and I hate him so much. He is the biggest ass and turns my mom into a complete fool. Today we were in Victoria secret... and I hate buying bra's, when I try them on they make me feel so horrible about myself for some reason. I feel like the ugliest person alive. yet, who has a body they want? or thinks they look good? no one. every girl wants the hair they dont have, the eyes they dont have, the nose they dont have, the boobs they dont have or anything they just don't have. I guess being a typical teenage girl I don't have anything I want... except my James. well anyway, In Victoria Secret I felt comfortable with the stuff I got and I bought some Rikaki and stuff, my mom was like ""wow! you look great in those bra's"" and ""they look great on you"" and blah blah blah about how beautiful I looked when I thought I looked so bad it made me cry. So my mom and myself go up to pay and she brings Sotiri in and of course him being an ass takes the bra's and goes she 15 years old and wants to wear these kind of things. because my bra had lace on it, so my mom gets all pissed off and what not and I got even more upset and my mom and me were on good terms. and then she starts saying I can't take this I hate both of you and shit like that and you shouldn't be wearing bra's with lace on them when she was just sitting there saying they looked good and helping me pick them out! I got soo pissed off I walked home. So she bought them and sotiri bitched the whole time. why the fuck he is even with me buying rikaki I don't know! or maybe because my mom is a baby and needs him everywhere. That could be it, yea that's it. Well and now I'm just really upset about that and I want James to come give me a hug or be home for me to talk to. He makes me feels better than anyone in the world ever could.. and It's not like he says anything different than anyone else, he just says stuff like you're so beautiful, and stuff that other people tell me. When they tell me I don't care and I guess I feel like I need to look pretty for James and I want to be beautiful just for him and when he tells me I am I feel like I accomplished that goal."

I went to ren fest with everyone It was great! and so much fun! we were all like elephant riding! and it was Katlyn, Jamie, Chris and myself on a elephant it was soo great...yesterday I chilled after school with James, waiting around for someone until like 3:30 and then he was suppose to go home but quick change of plan he came over my house instead. he could only stay until like 5 though it made me sad when he had to leave but okay. today wasn't that great first in the morning I forgot to take my medicine and my mom had to bring me it in school, but her being a genius came to school but forgot the medicine at home and had to take me home to take it. Then I went back and everything was cool until lunch... it was horrible, a horrible lunch period It really sucked I got really pissed off, and was maybe a little over dramatic about somthing that happenend that I don't want to talk about .. science was chill and so was tech ed but then Reading was great because megan was there! but then some guy was like oooh you have a nice rack and went on and grabbed me but I jumped and he missed me boobs. yea I was like what is your problem god I hate most towson guys. but anywayyy everything else today was cool haha. At the end of the day I walked to mark's with James and it was pooring and then I walked back cause I had to meet my mom at a certain time so I had to leave my baby! so I walked back phoning with kayla! when I got up to school, I was wearing a tank top and was soaking wet and what not so me and christy hucik walked by the football field with all the gus on it lol soaked and they started whistling!! and yelling wet girl in a tank top! and I was like uhhh??? because I look over and chritsty is blowing kisses going god guys always flirt with me (she was wearing a sweatshirt) that was the highlight of my day! well thats all that happenend so I'ma go find somthing to do now besides jam to birtany spears."

"event","well I just updated but I wanted to again.. today wasn't a very good day.. it kinda sucked a lot first I went to school and received yet another love letter... they bother me and make me feel bad. after that my mom got pissed because I called her about the letter and she came to school to talk to the guidance to make him stop writing those and then my mom asked me if I wanted to go get breakfast so I did.. I got back just in time for 2nd period. (which happens to be with Sean) and he wouldn't stop trying to make conversation. then when we went out into the hall he wouldn't leave me alone and automatically super james (duh duh duhhhh) came to the rescue and just nicely asked him to leave me alone and sean relpied I was just talking and then James was like nice sweet bro keep walking. and so he did. after that I went to tech ed which was fun. I guess... we have the best table it's Liz, Robby, Breanna and Myself. after that was Mrs. morrow shes a dumb hoe. try to tell me blond was spelled without a e and couldnt be spelled with a E as a matter of fact it can be spelled either way dumb bitch! garsh It wasn't a big deal till she made a humungous deal about it and I had to prove to her that it was a word and had to freaking look it up in the dictionary for her to prove that I was write. than lunch was boring. then after that I all happily walked nice and daintfully into the senior cafe and went to open the door to find a freaking condom on the door handle.. how discusting... ew what assholes towson is filled with. then I went to Gym.. It was hot outside. after that I went to Mr. Hsu's class he's stupid. Then to Mrs. Mc Issac. she's nice and that class was pretty cool. then I went with James and Mike to James's house and while we were walking James and Mike were talking about making fun of someone which kind of or really upset me considering its somthing people have made fun of me for before and It not only upset me because I didn't like when people said that stuff to me but I wouldnt want someone to say it to anybody else because stuff like that is really mean. but I got over that real fast and we were chillen at James house.. smoked a lil, and then chilled I was erally giggly and stuff because I get like that.. James was telling Mike abnout how I get because he has never been around me and he was explaining it as it was somthing really obnoxious and annoying or somthing he was like we learn to live with it. I wonder if he thinks I'm annoying or somthing when I smoke? I can't really act straight but if I'm not around parents why should I have to? and if I was around parents and really needed to I would be able to, but whatever. after that me and my mom took Mike home.. we argued the whole way and I did dumb stoner shit and he was laughing at me the whole time lol. I went home and uh made a straw that reached to me when I was lying down so I didn't have to move to get a drink.. after that I decided I missed James and wanted to call him, but things on the phone didn't exactly work well he kept saying this conversation was going really far and being sarcastic and I wasn't in the mood for sarcasm.. I called him because I wanted someone to talk to but he didn't want to talk. didn't see him making any conversation. and now I am typing and there is nothing welse to write about so buhbye. call me? right now? I'm still lonely."

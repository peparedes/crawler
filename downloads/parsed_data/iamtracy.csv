"event","So today I'm staying in to nurse my sprained ankle.
 
I'm mighty pissed about it coz my boss made me go into the office yesterday to settle some stuff before she flew off for her 1.5 week vacay. I had to do all that unnecessary walking so imagine my horror and anger when I came back home and after dinner, I removed the cold compress to see it all purple. It was only a slight shade of red the day after but now its PURPLE and veiny and I'M SO ANGRY. *ROAR*

In other happier news, I traded in my Samsung Omnia for the Blackberry Bold last Monday for a sweet deal of only $188. And I even got reimbursed $25 for my trade-in for my one-year old phone. I was literally BEAMING when I stepped out because prior to going to the mobile shop I calculated it to be $388. Fantastic 'miscalculation' on the part of M1 website/customer service staff? Whatever I'm keeping mum to myself on that one.

Also I made myself Almond Soya French Toast smoothered with Tahiti Vanilla Milk Jam and sprinkled with Cinnamon Sugar for breakfast this morn. I took photos with my Bold but it turned out fuzzy and pixelated. While I need to figure out the camera, breakfast has since been gobbled 40mins before and I have nothing to show for. *ahahaha*

Gonna try my hand at Braised Bacon Cabbage Jamie-style and Steamed Tofu with Chinese Sausage &amp; Fried Garlic later. Better luck on this one!

I always love when you visit in the Summertime!), here&nbsp;are a few&nbsp;bitesized nuggets&nbsp;to summarize:<br /><br /><br />1) Love - My brother &amp;&nbsp;Djudju had their&nbsp;Chinese customary&nbsp;and wedding dinner&nbsp;at end-Feb. Everything was great, the bride looked lovely in her dress, my brother dapper in his tux. All pictures&nbsp;are&nbsp;on Facebook.<br /><br />2) Recreate - I&nbsp;felt that something could'ave happened between Him and I especially from the beginning of this year. It was always simmering for the last year. In the last few months, it sparked and flamed, instances of so close yet so far.<br /><br />3) Fleeting -&nbsp;There were too many instances of getting too close to fire. Now that feeling's&nbsp;gone.&nbsp;He's stayed out of the hunting/dating field for almost 2 years&nbsp;but suddenly, he&nbsp;knew as I&nbsp;did, that anytime soon something might happen. So, when the next available prey came along, he jumped at it just so that&nbsp;he don't get in to another tangle with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the old adage goes, a leopard never changes its spots.<br /><br />4)&nbsp;Sadness - I&nbsp;couldn't stand living with my Mom. Turning point was before Euge's wedding. I&nbsp;stopped talking more than 5 sentences a day to her since Feb.<br /><br />5) Weight - I've lost 16.8kg in 9 months.<br /><br />6) Breakfree - Early June, I moved out of the house&nbsp;and am currently staying with my Aunt J. <br /><br />7)&nbsp;New home&nbsp;- My life is waaaay less stressful (work aside), and I like staying here,&nbsp;next to the canal, taking&nbsp;walks, having good 'ol homecooked food, helping with housework and being taken care of.&nbsp;From my first days of being here, I get breakfast laid out for me on the table and in the first 3 days;&nbsp; walked to the busstop with my Aunt . I&nbsp;remember my very first thought was- even my mom never did these for me before. I&nbsp;felt like I was in Kindergarten. Swear, it was&nbsp;the best feeling ever. :)<br />&nbsp;<br />8) Change - I've become (more) of a girly girl. My hair is at its longest and am wearing more dresses (coz I&nbsp;dun wanna iron pants ever again!). I've changed all my ElJay userpics, I think they pretty much reflect&nbsp;how I&nbsp;am now.&nbsp;<br /><br />9) Meetups - Spending quite a bit of time on Facebook now than befre *bashful* Met some IRC friends that I've not met in 9 years. So we change, and then again not so much. But sharing the&nbsp;updates and laughter = &nbsp;:)<br /><br />10)&nbsp;Joy - Body &amp;&nbsp;Mind are more at peace.&nbsp;Enjoying my canal walks&nbsp;in the mornings and on weekends. Simple yet yummy home cooked food.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its almost becoming easy to find fun and joy in simple things. <br /><br /><br />Feels downright wonderful."

I realised I've-&nbsp;almost-come-to-hate my two favourite most holidays&nbsp;because of&nbsp;estrangement between my parents because I need to make excuses to either one why I'm celebrating with one or the other and on no account am I&nbsp;being preferential&nbsp;nor do I&nbsp;need to give&nbsp;either one of you guys&nbsp;any reason or excuse. *frustrated*<br />7) Chatting to my cousins online on Christmas Day makes me really warm &amp;&nbsp;fuzzy happy, coz I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;in a way its an extension of our childhood get-togethers when we used to celebrate Christmas together as kids with&nbsp;yummy dinners, giggly carolling and&nbsp;fun-filled gift exchanges in fancy christmas clothes, happy laughter and heaps of torn gift-wrapping &amp; ribbons.<br />8) In a completely oblique verbal bluster, I&nbsp;declare WBros a selfish bitch coz I&nbsp;just wasted 2 hours of my life&nbsp;searching for&nbsp;the last 3 installments of GG&nbsp;to watch online (while totally forgetting that&nbsp;Warner Bros has banned all file-sharing&nbsp;of their works, I&nbsp;read&nbsp;in a recent ONTD post).<br />9) With the cold breeze coming into my study room (comp says its 26degs out), it feels way colder and I could really do with a tall cuppa Starbucks lowfat less whip extra sprinkles toffee-nut latte. Sipping it while snuggling under covers and watching my 1 of&nbsp;2 favourite Christmas movies Serendipity.<br />10) Love Actually is my other favourite movie,&nbsp;I watched it 3 nights ago and I&nbsp;fell asleep with a smile on my face.<br /><br />I just laid eyes on the <a href=""http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/computer_can_series.do?storeName=computer_store&amp;category=notebooks&amp;a1=Category&amp;v1=Mini&amp;series_name=mini1000vt_series"">HP&nbsp;Mini 1000 Vivienne Tam edition</a> notebook and I think it is a SEXY&nbsp;BEAST. I&nbsp;want it. *sigh* I&nbsp;already have a pink VAIO and no I can't really afford it, but yea sure I&nbsp;want it. It's pretty, it's red and sexy as hell, it even has&nbsp;friggin pink-painted flowers&nbsp;on&nbsp;it. OK&nbsp;EXACTLY&nbsp;WHAT&nbsp;IS&nbsp;THERE NOT&nbsp;TO&nbsp;SALIVATE&nbsp;AFTER? Oh yea- the price point. That's always the kicker. More bucks for brand name always. It is also times like these that I&nbsp;hate working in marketing AND&nbsp;retail. *moueeeeeeeeee*<br /><br />Ok enough with this nonsense, I'm going to do #9, sans the Starbucks! *pads off to bed merrily*"

"event","<br />And I'm still having the sniffles!!! *icky, leaky nose!*<br /><br />I'm almost done with all my&nbsp;Christmas shopping, and tomorrow I MUST complete all my Christmas wrapping! *whee at Christmas wrappers, ribbons, miniature ornaments, stickers&nbsp;and tape!* And yes Maine, it was safe to say on Friday night that I&nbsp;wouldn't do up the wrapping today (Saturday)- <em>as you and I both know it.</em> *moue*<br /><br />I&nbsp;also must write a list of names of Christmas cards to write- I&nbsp;am so late!!! (And I&nbsp;hope I don't skip it like last year due to tardiness&nbsp;:(&nbsp; )<br /><br />Watched Jim Carrey's YesMan yesterday with E&nbsp;and I&nbsp;received my first Christmas present- a coffee table book of graffiti artist Banksy's works. *SWEET!*<br /><br />Today, I&nbsp;met up with Melissa at VivoCity for dinner after my haircut and she also passed me my Christmas present. Which I was confused- because we always exchange presents only on Christmas Eve midnight mass. So I&nbsp;asked &quot;Errr why so early hur?!&quot; She said coz I&nbsp;need to clear the house&nbsp;and disseminate all my presents&nbsp;early this year. Immediately I&nbsp;realised the cause of this- Bridezilla must be rampaging through!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes Mel's sister&nbsp;will be&nbsp;getting married on Monday and it sounds like its going to be so freaking nutso. A quick run-through of the Queen M's drama antics: <em>Grand Venue</em> is at the Fullerton Hotel, 'special invitees'- 3 Mediacorp actresses: KN, IL and YL +&nbsp;<em>his</em> dad's Minister friends, <em>entertainment</em>: the MCs are a sissy stylist + makeup/wardrobe&nbsp;artist from Mediacorp, CLASS&nbsp;ACT: a 'cortillion-like' dance where Daddy&nbsp;will waltz with Queen M&nbsp;and then give her away to the husband and they will waltz together (WTF!!!), younger cousin to serenade to the couple, <strike>(MORE&nbsp;WTF!!!) Vienna Choir Boys to sing at their wedding <strike>(retracts MORE WTF!!!&nbsp;statement because the Boys are not available due to schedule clash)</strike></strike>, <em>dinner</em>: Chinese cuisine sit-down affair with individual plate servings (har??? I thought only Western cuisine dinners are individually served?! O_o)<br /><br />I'm afraid my head might implode on Monday night, or I&nbsp;might be treated to #1 wedding dinner ever attended in my lifetime. She sounds like GG's Blair, and TRUST&nbsp;ME she bloody well IS!&nbsp;Mel on the other hand, insists that she will elope just so that she doesn't have to go through&nbsp;all these&nbsp;rubbish of a hassle. I&nbsp;laughed. A lot.<br /><br />In other news, my Christmas wishlist this year mainly centred around books: Tales of Beetle the Bard, Jamie's Ministry of Food, The One Hundred, CIG to Tarot, Watching the English. <em>Anyone? Please??</em><em> </em><span style=""font-size: smaller""><span><span><em>*sad puppy dog eyes*<br /><br /></em></span></span></span>My leaky nose is annoying me again. I will thus take my leave to blow my nose as daintily as possible, and catch the last two episodes of GG that I&nbsp;have missed.<br /><br />*airkisses you*"

I&nbsp;mean SERIOUSLY <em>flat-out stupid and dumb-ass crazy</em>. I&nbsp;have proof of&nbsp;her idiocy.&nbsp;Like when I&nbsp;questioned her if she's called her lawyer regarding the letter or if she went down to HDB&nbsp;to check but instead she asks me: &quot;How will they lock up the house?&quot;, thats when I screamed at her on the phone: &quot;WAT- WOULD&nbsp;YOU LIKE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;WAIT TILL&nbsp;THE 15th TO&nbsp;FIND&nbsp;OUT?!?!&quot;</p><p>Damn her and that&nbsp;ridonkulous warped divorce plans she has. fux, Fux, FUX!!!<br /><br />On Saturday I&nbsp;freaked out&nbsp;that&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn't have a place to stay in 4 working days, that&nbsp;all&nbsp;my belongings, clothes,&nbsp;laptop and even&nbsp;favourite furniture will get taken away from me. I&nbsp;almost needed a paperbag to&nbsp;breathe into. I&nbsp;tested my brother and sis-in-law. They've always said that they&nbsp;were all up to take me in- but when it comes to the crunch, <em>will they</em>? Probably unfair but I&nbsp;had to make them think it through seriously...</p><p>Met Charmaine, Regina and Corine for dinner and had Teochew Porridge. It was fun, it was hilarious, it was outrageous. Also it kept my mind off things. <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=72738&amp;id=727697473"">Oui,&nbsp;Fantastic Four!</a><br /><br />To keep things short, I&nbsp;chatted with Daddy some on Sunday and update him of&nbsp;the rubbish my mom was sprouting and spewing- he then decided that he will transfer the house to my name 100%,&nbsp;and not the 50/50% as agreed in the divorce proceedings since she's obviously latching onto the idea of owning it 100%&nbsp;for leverage means, and to try her grabby hands on everything else my dad has- even though she has no money to pay for the house's monthly payment, thinks&nbsp;that renting out the entire house to stay will be a 'good' source of income (I&nbsp;blew up and shouted-&nbsp; &quot;AND&nbsp;RENTING&nbsp;OUT&nbsp;THE&nbsp;ENTIRE&nbsp;HOUSE&nbsp;WHILE&nbsp;RENTING&nbsp;A&nbsp;ROOM&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;OURSELVES&nbsp;ELSEWHERE&nbsp;SEEMS&nbsp;LIKE&nbsp;A&nbsp;SMART&nbsp;IDEA&nbsp;TO&nbsp;<em>'KEEP' THE&nbsp;HOUSE</em>?!?!&quot;), and, that is not even to say that there isn't anything to&nbsp;her 'name' to pay up the remaining $190k for the house!!!<br /><br />Thankfully for the&nbsp;chat with Daddy to resolve the ridiculous issue and chatting the remaining of the night with N, as a sounding board and afterwhich to keep my mind off things. Put a smile on my face with a silly song before I&nbsp;went to bed he did, after that turmultous weekend.<br /><br />*hearts all for the love*</p>"

I was totally bummed out, but then again as N says it- perhaps it is our fault coz Nev&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;couldn't make it due to colleague's parties (farewell for him, birthday for me)&nbsp;and also El (then again she couldn't show support&nbsp;since she didn't&nbsp;know about it&nbsp;coz she MIA for exam preparations *hehe*). In Nev's words:&nbsp;&quot;KELONG!!!&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;whoever said that&nbsp;1 vote dun count?!&quot; , Mim's on the other hand said- that's like having sex for 6 hours but still not getting an orgasm. Succintly said dear friends, but&nbsp;my brother says it best: &quot;All in good fun.&quot;&nbsp;in&nbsp;his&nbsp;update to me on the phone just minutes after the results were out. Ah yes... that's my Favourite Brother. *beams proudly*<br /><br />I graduated from SIM&nbsp;University on 26 October 08 with my Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies &amp;&nbsp;English Language, and&nbsp;invited to my convocation was&nbsp;Daddio and Auntie&nbsp;LF who was&nbsp;back from Vancouver&nbsp;to look after Auntie J whilst she was in hospital. Pretty damn happy to finish my 3.5 year course, but now am kinda at a loss-&nbsp;deliberating&nbsp;between&nbsp;taking a Masters, learning French, Japanese or driving, picking up a new hobby and going back to the gym.&nbsp;It's kinda like shopping for something new to do :X&nbsp;or plan&nbsp;my steps to working overseas. Thisi is going to take a while.&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v169/iamtracy/DSC02664.jpg""><img alt="""" style=""width: 549px; height: 419px"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v169/iamtracy/DSC02664.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />The US&nbsp;financial crisis kept me on my toes and I was really worried for Nev who works in ML and Mel in Goldman.&nbsp;Still am. :( Am crossing my fingers that Nev will be fine, especially since he just recently told us that&nbsp;BOA wants to merge both companies to&nbsp;operate&nbsp;as one starting Jan 09 and with so many of his colleagues quitting in the last few weeks and him recently&nbsp;handing in his work performance accessment, the next few weeks must be extremely stressful on top of the depression&nbsp;swamping the office since&nbsp;the takeover. Mel's&nbsp;dept in Goldman was due for a retrenchment exercise 2 weeks back, since she called me last week and sounded fine, I'm guessing she's cleared.&nbsp;<br /><br />On 7-9 Nov, I went to Bangkok for a short vacay&nbsp;with my colleague buddy Cindy and just S$435 worth of Thai baht to&nbsp;my name, I&nbsp;managed to shop and bring back the whole of Bangkok. 11 tops and dresses, 3 scarfs, 3 necklaces, 2 hairbands, 2 bags, 3 pussybow neckties ala Gossp Girl, 2 Blythe picture frames, cutesy notebooks &amp;&nbsp;stationary gifts, puppy-printed tissues, and&nbsp;almost 1/4 luggage space of snacks&nbsp;as gifts- and somehow managed to squeeze 17kg of luggage in a span of 60 hours&nbsp;of shopping thereabouts with that measly budget- pretty darn proud of myself tbh. *ROARS*<br /><br />Which brings me to the whole crazy Thailand anti-government protests. Prior to&nbsp;my&nbsp;Nov vacay, we've already postponed&nbsp;it once as my original&nbsp;flight was scheduled in Sep but&nbsp;protestors bombed the Government&nbsp;House on&nbsp;Sep 1st and took fighting to the streets.&nbsp;Right now reports of the insane Suvarnabhumi Airport takeover by the protestors_ well&nbsp;no words can express how relieved I&nbsp;am to be back before it happened and I am totally in awe of how huge this whole thing has gotten. Because despite my initial fears of safety, in&nbsp;my 3 days there, life and the Bangkok streets and malls were extremely normal. I also remember standing in the middle of the Airport before checking-in, almost gleefully dancing around at how spacious and modern it is in comparison to the old crappy one.<br /><br />The Mumbai terrorist attacks also depresses me greatly. All the reports of the attacks, especially&nbsp;the 'unbiased' mass shooting at the train station and their 2 grandest hotels make me shudder.&nbsp;So does&nbsp;the death of the 1 Singaporean hostage- she looks so young, successful and pretty and&nbsp;geniunely&nbsp;seems like such a great person&nbsp;and&nbsp;only just celebrated her 1st yr wedding anniversary recently. Good grief, she was only to be there for a 2 day worktrip like WTF&nbsp;are the odds?! So damn depressing and unbelievable...<br /><br />In more uplifting highlights, Brenda jiejie- my best pal during my three years in Singapore Polytechnic, came back to Singapore for a 3-week off from work to get married with her hubby Jeffrey; also based in Melbourne after graduating. Their wedding took place last Sunday at Hyatt Hotel and almost all our classmates turned up to congratulate the happy couple. :) *YAY&nbsp;Brenda!*<br /><br /></span><a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v169/iamtracy/BrendaWeddingGroupPhoto2.jpg""><img alt="""" style=""width: 520px; height: 385px"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v169/iamtracy/BrendaWeddingGroupPhoto2.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />Also in other news, my 6-bus and 1 Harbourfront NEL&nbsp;train station wall mural advertising campaign will be up islandwide starting tomorrow for the next 3 months. After 4 months of ridiculous stress and tooth-pulling pain with both my HK&nbsp;Regional Office and Moove Media, I'm pretty darn excited about seeing my 7x2.5m large mural decorating the front of the HBF station faregates. <br /><br />It's Dec 1st and Christmas is round the corner, while it is always exciting to see my 6 shops decorated so festively, sales in stores and my roadshow is beyond worrisome and I really don't want to think about 2009- yet I've already planned my entire marketing calender to <em>Dec 2009</em>. I fear the budget and target for the 2009 new fiscal year in April.<br /><br />Mel will be back from London for 3 weeks from the 17th for her sister's wedding at The Fullerton on the 22nd of Dec. While of course I'm happy for her sis, am actually quite blah about attending. Am just glad Mel's back in town for quite a while and that I get to sit next to her at the dinner. *chuckles* <br /><br />Cozzie <a href=""http://yueni.livejournal.com/profile""><img height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" style=""border-right: 0px; padding-right: 1px; border-top: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://yueni.livejournal.com/""><b>yueni</b></a>&nbsp;also just informed me that she will be back in Singapore for 2 weeks from the 14th to&nbsp;celebrate&nbsp;CNY- I&nbsp;haven't seen her in almost 5/6&nbsp;years so naturally I&nbsp;am extremely&nbsp;happy and excited. Hopefully Auntie LF&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cozzie&nbsp;Nee&nbsp;will also come back during the same period- CNY will be a BLAST! I havent seen Nee in more than 12 years so *omgomgomg*.<br /><br />Lastly,&nbsp;Obama winning the US elections was pretty smashin and the&nbsp;campaign leading up to the win&nbsp;was probably the most exciting and active in comparison to any other in my 28 years of existence. I hope (and feel) that he can do a good job to raise the spirits of the Americans and also rebuild their reputation and the damned economy.<br /><br />All in all, a darned stressful last 4 months&nbsp;of 2008. Just remember: <em>Chin up, chest out, cheer up!</em></lj-cut>"

"event","<br />Out of sorts today.<br /><br />Met Mel today who is back for the week. That, I'm happy about. We spent the day together, mostly of shopping and getting a dress for her sister's wedding in&nbsp;December at the St Regis SIngapore. Oh yes you heard me baybeh- the ST&nbsp;REGIS alright. O.o<br /><br />Was going a little loopy and I thought all hope was lost until she showed me <a href=""http://www.bcbg.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3149410&amp;cp=2769162.2768981&amp;clickid=cat_leftnav_txt&amp;parentPage=family"">The Dress</a>, Said dress is DIVINE- gorgeous and so goddess-like. Honestly and all that fuss about if she should enter before the room first or the bridesmaid then her sister because she was terrifed the dress she picked in the end would look like shit. With this dress she should definitely go first (but of course at the risk of her looking like the bride&nbsp;*lol*), but then again, its $600+ for a probably worn-one-time-only-dress *wolf whistles*<br /><br />Which reminds me that I&nbsp;shoud get&nbsp;a dress for my own brother's wedding which is in Feb 29 &amp; Mar 1. Umm Joelle yea I finally got the dates from Euge, will u be able to make it? But I think you mentioned your vacay is in early Feb? How about Michelle and th rest of your folks? Blasted Euge really should be getting the invites out&nbsp;to you guys soon to let u guys prepare- oooh&nbsp;that bugger boy.<br /><br />Mostly my feeling out of sorts is coz Auntie J is in the hospital. She was warded on Friday due to a sudden blood clot in&nbsp;her brain which had to be immediately operated on at the risk of the blood vessel bursting and flooding the brain. Her op was from 9pm-2am but it went well, we went down yesterday afternoon where she was still in ICU but fast asleep.&nbsp;My eyes watered when I first saw her coz her&nbsp;hair&nbsp;on the&nbsp;right side was completely shaved off- I dunno why I&nbsp;wasn't really expecting that and it&nbsp;was pretty scary to be honest. <br /><br />She's out of ICU today&nbsp;and now put in a neurosurgery special ward, she was asleep when&nbsp;I visited her at 8ish. I rang Euge and he told me he reached at 4 but she was also asleep. Told me he bought her &quot;a Get Well Soon balloon *hehe*&quot;, I smiled and I said I saw. I'd probably&nbsp;call my dad to pick me up and visit her again immediately after work&nbsp;tomorrow so&nbsp;that I&nbsp;can try to&nbsp;catch her awake. *crosses fingers*<br /><br />It's been a long day and I'm going to&nbsp;bed now.&nbsp;Goodnight and *hugs you tight*."

"event","Hi Guys, how's it going?

I think I saw you, Joelle for a spot, online earlier in the evenng. How's settling in and Beijing so far?? Do tell!

I&nbsp;met up with Els &amp;&nbsp;N on Saturday. Never knew a Diavola and&nbsp;Vongole&nbsp;dinner could&nbsp;cook up such fire and sparks but boy was there antagonizing and hilarity involved.&nbsp; We also laughed much reminiscing over ELs' &quot;Let's take up synchronized swimming&quot; comment to Mimi. That.. that is Solid Gold that will go&nbsp;down in history,my friend. And Yes I&nbsp;know you are perfectly serious- which really only makes it more hilarious. :P

Went to&nbsp;Comex on Sunday and with Charmaine's help, bought a Maxtor 320g HDD for $129- cheap as hell but&nbsp;NEVER&nbsp;WILL&nbsp;I&nbsp;GO&nbsp;TO&nbsp;COMEX&nbsp;IN&nbsp;MY&nbsp;LIFE&nbsp;AGAIN-&nbsp;EVER. I swear the whole of Suntec, Marina, City Hall area looks like what a prison camp would look like if it suddenly let out all its prisoners. FRIGGIN&nbsp;OVERRUN &amp;&nbsp;AMOK.

In other more 'Oh-kill-me-now-news', I spent the whole the whole of today and yesterday engaged in meetings with my boss E, and tomorrow will be MORE&nbsp;meetings with my Ops and GM. So much for that meeting last month on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Marketing&nbsp;team&nbsp;not communicating. *PFFFHT!!!*&nbsp;

Now we're meeting every other day I&nbsp;really dun even have time to do anything else- and YES I&nbsp;DO&nbsp;have mountains of urgent outstanding shit with additional promotions/activities/events every 2 weeks to the marketing calender from August 08 till Feb 09, so much so that all those silly meetings are making me lost at work. *is damn lost grumpasaurus in the office* *ROARS*

And what with hoping my upcoming vacation in Bangkok next week will wind me down some, IT&nbsp;DECLARES&nbsp;ITSELF&nbsp;IN&nbsp;A&nbsp;STATE&nbsp;OF&nbsp;EMERGENCY. *Dammit and I say the same for myself!!!* Why did it have to riot/strike/go into berserker mode as a nation, now? Seriously at this rate,&nbsp;*my heart will NOT&nbsp;go on*.

I rushed home after work at 8 today so that I can&nbsp;watch&nbsp;the season premiere of Gossip&nbsp;Girls Seas 2. And YESSSS I managed to catch it 26 hours the US&nbsp;telecast- I&nbsp;amaze myself sometimes. 

Withat great bimbotic accomplishment, I shall take my leave for bed now.

Xoxo,
T"

"event","so bored. so&nbsp;moody. I need an outlet to spill my frustrations.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Click for texty updates..."">Left the new workplace back for the old. Realised that Beauty may be Beauty but Cosmetics don't interest me like shower gels &amp; body lotions do.&nbsp;Blusher in tube, pan, cream or powder is just bloody blusher to me. Maybe it's just&nbsp;because I'm a sensorial person, but I'll never go back into cosmetics in my life ever again even though my secret dream job was to be a cosmetic counter girl. Most girls want to be an SIA girl, I just wanted to be a cosmetic counter girl- must be the perfectly made up face,&nbsp;the bright lights and the 300 different shades of pink that made it look oh so wonderful.&nbsp;<br /><br />Unsurprisingly I still love my old workplace and the things I do. Maybe I should never have left, but then again if I didn't I wouldn't know what it is like to leave my comfort zone or to be managerial- albeit only for a month.<br /><br />Speaking of managers- I kind of got my boss of this said 'new' workplace kicked out coz she is lousy boss and I thought she was stupid and inefficient. I honestly don't know if she quit or she got fired. I heard she&nbsp;tendered&nbsp;on the same day as I did. I said&nbsp;a lot of honest things that I didn't think she understood&nbsp;but when&nbsp;your marcomm team of 3 quit all within&nbsp;4 weeks- you know you're shit. I don't regret saying them nor&nbsp;trying out the new place. The people were nice, the office was swank and the ambience great.<br /><br />Now I&nbsp;still have a new boss in my workplace, same&nbsp;work (but more)&nbsp;and a&nbsp;new boss. She's&nbsp;ok,&nbsp;except that she doesn't step up to be the&nbsp;Asst Mktg Mgr appointment when she needs to. Sometimes I wonder if she's the boss or I am. I may be more&nbsp;senior but I honestly think that&nbsp;when&nbsp;it calls for you to&nbsp;pull your position especially when it comes to approval or talking to management- wtf do I have to do&nbsp;your job? If we really just needed another executive, why are u here? Quit the nitty gritty, plan more and step up when u need to. *pfft*<br /><br />School's over for me. I finished my last paper and I got a A- grade for it, the way I see it if I didn't score between an A-B, I really might as well quit my full-time job since it was a Marketing Communications module.<br /><br />WIth school out and a mounting workload with multiple projects on hand and more to come, my life just revolves around work. I'm damn tired and stressed. Thinking of picking up something new... everyone tells me I should really take up driving. So that's first on my list.<br /><br />Went to Malacca&nbsp;for a short 3 day trip with best pals Els and Nev. Had chicken rice balls, finally bought myself a Congak board and came home with a sunburn and a Chuck addiction. (Chuck on PSP-TV was our bedtime entertainment every night). Those two lucky didn't kill themselves on the trip and Els admitted she njoys irritating Nev and I. I'm sure Nev enjoys irritating Els too not that he'd voice that out. Woe is me.<br /><br />Loved SATC the movie and even more so about Gossip Girls.&nbsp; Am in love with Lonelyboy and S. IRL and on-screen. Chuck is great too. Can't wait for Season 2 of both serials.<br /><br />Mom and Dad got divorced 2 months ago but M is contesting the divorce. More money, more property. Am honestly very sick of her bullshit. So much so that aside from Dad and Euge, I don't even want to talk about it. At all. But it cracks me up with each court session when my&nbsp;D tells me how the Judge questions&nbsp;M and the stupid illogical answers she gives.&nbsp;She honestly thinks she is very intelligent and she&nbsp;has every right to&nbsp;EVERYTHING she asks for when everything about her is illogical and just downright stupid.&nbsp;And I live with this woman. Just too depressing, tiring and&nbsp;irritated.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sometimes I get to thinking that some people don't&nbsp;realise the blessings they have and it makes me pissed. They have the money to buy anything they want, loving family and&nbsp;relatives relations, people that love them and shower them with genuine emotions, vacations, yet they take it all for granted. I'd be thankful if just for a home-cooked meal- you just haven't got a&nbsp;clue.&nbsp;I know some of my closest friends think I ask stupid inane questions when I&nbsp;say: so what&nbsp;did you have for dinner yesterday? But just hearing the listed dishes makes me envy, you know? I have a job I love and it isn't like I'm lacking on a lot of things but it's the simple things and the genuine emotions they are showered with that I wish people could be more thankful for, that's all I'm saying.&nbsp;<br /><br />Birthday's round the corner but am completely not in the mood for anything. No plans, too tired and unbothered to organize anything, I just want to sleep in on my birthday- now THAT is a great plan. Best bud&nbsp;M is going to LA for her bdae, now that's a wonderful bdae vacation to have. *grin* Hope she has fun. <br /><br />I straightened out my crazy twisted curls and my hair is straightened with a long straight fringe. Everyone who's seen me thinks its a fabulous hair makeover from wild to little nice girl. Wacked first comments are: Dora the Explorer, looks just&nbsp;like&nbsp;a naughty kid!, Edna Mode with longer hair, so <em>kuai!<br /></em><br />I just have to say this but Mariah Carey's song Touch My Body just makes me laugh. Very hard. It sounds so damn stupidly lame and what bloody crazy person would&nbsp;sing&nbsp;a song like that?</div><br /><br />Just some instances in the last few months of my self-diagnosis on why I am developing a low tolerance to bullshit."

"event","I will be&nbsp;getting my pc replacement tomorrow, and most likely it will be the pink Sony Vaio notebook. This is where I confess my bimbo self takes over when it comes to my tech toys, 'sadly' as in this case. 

And I will be moving onto greener pastures. Starting next week, I will be taking up the position of Asst Mktg Mgr, Global Marcomms in another cosmetics/beauty co. which is pretty darn exciting but it also terrifies me at the same time. 

So psyched but sometimes I just think I'm stark raving mad: stepping up and doing global markets instead of just domestic. What with my two years of experience, there'll be tonnes to learn and while I've had a junior exec under me the last 6 mths, being a manager is in a totally different ballgame altogether. 

Yet my heart is racing at all the possibilities. 

Maybe my motto in life is the same as EA Games. 

Challenge everything."

"event","This week will be my last week of work with L'Occitane.

What an odd feeling.

Looking back, it's amazing how long I've managed to stay considering my first 6 months was pure hell with a OCD, workaholic boss and close to zero knowledge on marketing, PR and advertising in an fmcg retail environment. 

Since then, learning the ropes and how to manage the boss, my ridiculous head office, 6 retail shops, as well as the expansion of my office has been nothing short of an amazing journey. 

Hell, it's been good 2 years and I know I'm gonna miss this place."

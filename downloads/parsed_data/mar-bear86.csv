garrett moved in on monday.  i can easily say that the atmosphere in the apartment is definitely bettter than it has been all quarter.  

i just got back from disneyland.  it was such a great weekend.  on saturday, i spent the day with my neighbors.  it was so nice to see them.  we explored california adventure, and then got over to disneyland just in time to line up for the christmas parade.  we sat there for over an hour waiting for it to begin.  normally, i wouldn't do that, but this was an exception.  my old dance studio had recieved an invitation to dance in a special parade.  i was so proud of them as they danced down main street.  after the dancers' parade, we stayed to watch the christmas parade.  i loved the look on my little cousin's face as she saw all the characters.  after the parade, it started to pour.  after more rides (in the rain), i met my dance teacher at the hotel.  this morning, we had breakfast, and then it was back to the park for more rides.  i had so much fun, especially since i hadn't seen genia since september.  i really felt like we bonded even more this trip.  i let her into aspects of my life that i had never wanted to tell her before.  at the same time, she updated me on her life.  i really like how we have a really close friendship and how our student-teacher realationship is starting to disappear.  i really hated saying goodbye to her today.

on a side note, genia invited me to dance with the studio if they go to disneyland next year.  so come next december, you all may be coming to disneyland to cheer me on as i dance in the parade"

"event","ok guys...time for the recap for my summer...its been forever since i posted, so bear with me...i know you all want to know every detail of my life....haha

So I think the last time I seriously posted I was mad at the world.  Well, I'm over that now, probably because I've been too busy to think about it....

As soon as I got home from school, I started work.  I literally got only a day to rest.  I forgot how tiring it was to spend my day with a bunch of preschoolers.  And my kids definitey did not let me enter the realms of summer camps slowly.  The very first day, I had a kid shit his pants, literally.  And he continued to do so, for the next 3 days (and lucky for me, I got to clean him up).  And the first week I had a lovely boy who only spoke Chinese.  In fact he actually lived in China and his parents thought that it would be a good idea for him to spend some time with some American kids while they were visiting the country.  Bad idea.  Twice the kid turned on us, beating up myself, some of my coworkers, and my boss.  Needless to say, I was glad to see him leave.  During the week, I also took the opportunity to bond with all my coworkers.  We went to the Giants game and hung out at Rachel's where we all played murder(typical of camp counselors).

My first weekend home, I went to my old studio's dance recital.  It was so wierd seeing how much all the girls have grown since I left.  After the show, I went with Lindsay to San Rafael to party with some of her friends from Dominican.  It was a lot of fun, especially since I hadn't hung out with Lindsay in a long time, and I had never seen her drunk.

The second weekend of camp was pretty uneventful, except that it was Pat's 21st birthday.  A bunch of us all went to Friday's  to buy him shots and watch him get trashed.  That Friday, I hung out with Lindsay (the other one).  Everytime we hang out I have a good time, especially since she is one of my best friends.  On Saturday, I drove up to El. Dorado Hills to spend the rest of the weekend with Melissa.  It took me over 3 hours to get there because of traffic.  We went to dinner in Old Town Sacramento, and the next day, we painted big mugs for our apartment.  It was so nice seeing her and I didn't want to leave.  

4th of July was my dad's birthday.  We had a huge bbq, and even my family from Alaska and Chicago came.

The next week, I was looking for the annual Rec Staff vs Pool Staff Challenge.  As usual, each team planned to taunt the other a little too much before the competition actually began so it was cancelled.  Instead we went to Steph's house for a bbq and then to my house to go in the hot tub.

That weekend, six of us from work went up to Steph's trailer in Clear Lake.  We spent the days tubing and the nights drinking.  We even drank with Steph's grandma.  Too bad there was drama that came with all the fun.

The following week, there was the bbq at Pat's house.  It was just the usual bbq, except that I had to drive an extremely drunk Pat to the airport at 11pm to pick a friend and then Steph got attacked by Billy, Pat's fish.  It's hard to explain what happened, you just had to be there to see it.

Last week, I went to Kauai with my family.  It was so nice just laying out on the beach and not worrying about a bunch of kids.

That's pretty much my whole summer so far.  Let me just leave you with some quotes from my kids.

""Teacher, if 2 boys got married that would be hecka funny!"" --Andy
""What's that poopy smell?"" --Nino
""I don't like celery.  It's gross."" --Koby, as he's eating celery with peanut butter
""Marian, movies scare me."" --Eugenia
Andy: Knock Knock
Me: Who's there?
Andy: Head
Me: Head who?
Andy: BEETLE!
""Shhh! You can't let the teachers know!"" --Andrew
""Andrew kissed me on the lips."" --Gianna
""Do you like my string?"" --Kendall
""Would you like to use my sweater?"" --Kendall, referring to a paper towel that she was using to wipe the sweat from her face

"event","This has been such an amazing weekend.  I flew home on Friday night, and went directly to my aunt and uncle's 25th wedding anniversary party.  Aside from answering the same questions and hearing the same comments over and over (""How's college?"" and ""I haven't seen you since you were a baby!""), it was a lot of fun.  In the end, my aunt, uncle and I had a tap off.  And it was cool, since we not only honored my aunt and uncle, but also 3 of my cousins who are graduating this year (we have 1 of every type, college, high school, and eighth grade) and my other uncle, who just got engaged.  Kinda wierd though, because my new aunt is only like 8 years older than me (my uncle is only 31, so its not like he's robbing the cradle).

On Saturday, we went back to my aunt and uncle's house for brunch.  When we got home, I proceeded to fall down the stairs, and I now have a bump on my arm and a bruise on my ass.  Later that day, I went shopping with my mom and then I met up with Lindsay.  It was business as usual.  We saw Just My Luck, which was cute but I don't recommend unless you are 14 years old, and then had dinner at the Ramen House as usual.  Afterwards, we decided not to break tradition, and went to Max's for dessert.  She got her usual chocolate eclair, but I took a chance and decided to try the macaroon sundae, so yummy.

Sunday was my favorite day of the weekend.  Courtney got married!!!!! She is one of my best friend's sisters, and when I was younger I really looked up to her, so it was important to me that I be there for her special day.  Actually, even though I don't see her too often, I still look up to her.  She is the big sister I never had.  The wedding was so much fun, and after a delicious dinner, we all danced like crazy.  I don't want to get into all the details, but I will tell you my favorite parts.  The first part was the father of the bride's toast.  I have known Tim for years, and never have I seen him get so emotional.  He was so happy for Courtney.  Next was the bouquet toss.  It actually fell to the floor the first time.  And now let me turn to the dance floor.  First, there was the groomsman Trevor.  Lindsay (my friend's sister and not the same Lindsay as above) had him ask me to dance. We had a lot of fun, considering he actually could dance.  And then, I was dancing with my 3rd grade teacher Mrs. Sigillo.  I was sancing with these kids I baby-sit, and she decided to join us.  The best part overall was Courtney's cousin Andrea.  She got a little too drunk and started making out with one of the groomsmen on the dance floor.  Most of us tried to ignore it, but her poor mother kept trying to distract her so that she wouldn't make a fool of herself.

This morning I went to brunch with my parents and grandma.  There, I happened to run into my eighth grade teacher whom I haven't seen in over 2 years.  Then I went shopping with my mom and grandma and we spent over $400 at Nordstrom.  Then it was time for my flight back down, and I can truthfully say that I didn't want to come back because I knew that the only thing I had to look forward to was finals."

"event","Today marks 2 years since an extraordinary person left us.  Kelly Shea Gallo died on May 3, 2004 of breast cancer at the age of 35.  she left behind 2 daughters, Mia, now 9, and Chloe, now 5.  She was truly an inspiration to everyone.
As a teacher at Taylor Middle School, she prepared all the teenagers of Millbrae, CA for high school and beyond.  She taught there through her illness, only stopping when she could no longer get out of bed.
As a basketball coach at Mills High School, she truly bonded with her team.  Those girls adored her, she was not just their coach; she was part of their families.
As a lifeguard at the Millbrae Meadows Swim Club, Kelly was truly an inspiration to me.  I met her when I was almost 6 years old.  Back then I was intimidated by her because she taught the ""big kids"".  When I was in her class, I was one of the ""chosen ones"", forced to stand at the edge of the pool dripping wet, as she called everyone one by one ( I was always the last one called).  Later on, as I started working there, Kelly became more than just my boss.  We had a very special relationship.  I was her personal slave, running every errand imaginable at the pool.  I was a baby-sitter, watching Mia and Chloe, often with last minute's notice.  But most importantly we were friends.  After work I usually stayed at the pool.  If she was still there, we'd talk and I'd do her hair.  My relationship was like this with her sister as well, but Kelly and I shared a special bond.  I was her ""Toothless"", a nickname given to me when I was 8 years old that stuck.  Even as one of her teaching assistants, I was referred to as Toothless instead of Marian.  I loved that nickname.
Even today, it's hard to believe she's been gone this long.  I remember the day in September 2003 that I found out she was sick.  I remember walking for her in a breast cancer walk that October.  I remember praying for her, wanting her to get better.  I remember the day I learned she wasn't expected to make it through the week.  I remember the minute I heard she had passed.  I remember her funeral, the look in her daughters' eyes, her mother's grief, the whole families' grief.  I remember all the children, there to honor their teacher.  I remember the slide show, featuring all the happy moments in her life, sad yet funny because she was wearing a dress in 75% of the pictures. (She hated dresses).  I remember crying in her sister's arms.
Now, I see her children, and I can't help but think about her.  Mia wants to do everything that her mom did.  And Chloe still doesn't really know what is going on.  She was only 3 when Kelly died, and all she knows is that her Mommy died and is now in heaven.
That's all I have to say right now.  And while I still want her to be with me today, I know Kelly's watching over me, that's all I need."

*Because Im not a Dodgers fan * he replied.

"event","I have to say that I am definitely looking forward to this quarter.  Although I was not ready to come back to school after a very short spring break, I must say that things are looking better.  For once, I actually enjoy going to my classes.  My Math 163 class is really interesting.  Aside from being at 8 in the morning, I love the fact that I now know the ancient Egyptian number system.  How cool is that? Math 20F is going to be interesting solely for the fact that my professor has an awesome accent.  Hum 5 is cool too.  I love how the professor doesn't worry about sharing his bias with the class.  For once, I'm glad to have a professor that is openly liberal(even though I am conservative).  And my TA is studying archeology and I'm convinced he wants to be the next Indiana Jones.  Dance is class as usual.  I don't know how I could not like that class.  TEP 118 seems to be pretty cool.  I haven't really had any lectures so far, but the professor seems cool, and hopefully my research project will be on the effectiveness of single gender education (something I am very familar with).

Oh and this quarter, I am actually involved!  I am on the Welcome Week Committee just to prove that (somewhat) normal people are in Revelle. And over the next two weeks I am interviewing candidates for the new director of Student Business Services.   That job makes me feel really important.  And the best news, I am going to be in the Spring Dance Showcase.  If the piece I'm in is chosen, I get to be in the performance, which is the weekend before finals.  And regardless, I get 3 units for it.  Plus its tap, my favorite type of dance ever.  So I'm not gonna have a life this quarter, especially towards the end, but I don't care life is good!!!

I guess I'm just really content with where I am in life.  I have the best friends in the world, and I'm realizing that friends can be found in the most unexpected of places.  I know this sounds vague, but some of you know what I am talking about.

Well, thats all for now.  I have to get up in less than 6 hours to work Admit Day"

"event","How many UC students does it take to change a lightbulb?

UCLA: Two. 1 to change the bulb, and another to call their friends at USC and tell them how they changed it just as well and for much cheaper.

CAL: Three. 1 to change the bulb and two to debate about the metaphysical state of the bulb and how its invention has impacted human development.

UCSD: Five. 1 to hold the bulb and 4 to start smoking weed until the room spins.

UCI: Eleven. 1 to change the bulb and ten to sit around watching because honestly, what else is there to do at Irvine past 10pm??

UCR: Three. 1 to steal the bulb, another to drive the getaway car, and the last to call all his friends to throw the celebration party on a Tuesday night. (not just tuesday, maybe on thursday too!)

UCSB: Seven. 1 to screw the bulb and 6 to screw each other.

UC Davis: Zero. There is no electricity in Davis.

UC Merced: Two. One to hold the bulb while the other calls his friend asking for help in figuring out this ""new college thing.""

UCSC: None. Living in the forest, they see at night by moonlight and torches. Damn hippies!"

"event","WOMAN'S PERFECT BREAKFAST
She's sitting at the table with her gourmet coffee.
Her son is on the cover of the Wheaties box.
Her daughter is on the cover of Business Week.
Her boyfriend is on the cover of Playgirl.
And her husband is on the back of the milk carton.

WOMEN'S REVENGE

> As she fumbled for her wallet I noticed a remote control for a television

UNDERSTANDING WOMEN (A MAN'S PERSPECTIVE)
I know I'm not going to understand women.
I'll never understand how you can take boiling hot wax,
pour it onto your upper thigh, rip the hair out by the root,
and still be afraid of a spider.

MARRIAGE SEMINAR
While attending a Marriage Seminar dealing with communication,
Tom and his wife Grace listened to the instructor,
""It is essential that husbands and wives know each other's likes and
dislikes.""
He addressed the man,
""Can you name your wife's favorite flower?""
Tom leaned over, touched his wife's arm gently and whispered, ""It's
Pillsbury, isn't it?

CIGARETTES AND TAMPONS
A man walks into a pharmacy and wanders up and down the aisles.
The sales girl notices him and asks him if she can help him.
He answers that he is looking for a box of tampons for his wife.
She directs him down the correct aisle.
A few minutes later, he deposits a huge bag of cotton
balls and a ball of string on the counter.
She says, confused, ""Sir, I thought you were looking for some tampons
for your wife?
He answers, "" You see, it's like this,
yesterday, I sent my wife to the store to get me a carton of cigarettes,
and she came back with a tin of tobacco and some rolling
papers; cause it's sooo-ooo--oo-ooo much cheaper.
So, I figure if I have to roll my own .......... so does she.
( I figure this guy is the one on the milk carton! )

WIFE VS. HUSBAND
A couple drove down a country road for several miles, not saying a word.
An earlier discussion had led to an argument and
neither of them wanted to concede their position.
As they passed a barnyard of mules, goats, and pigs,
the husband asked sarcastically, ""Relatives of yours?""
""Yep,"" the wife replied, ""in-laws.""

W O R D S
A husband read an article to his wife about how many words women use a
day...
30,000 to a man's 15,000.
The wife replied, ""The reason has to be because we have to repeat everything
to men...
The husband then turned to his wife and asked, ""What?""

CREATION
A man said to his wife one day, ""I don't know how you can be
so stupid and so beautiful all at the same time.
"" The wife responded, ""Allow me to explain.
God made me beautiful so you would be attracted to me;
God made me stupid so I would be attracted to you!

WHO DOES WHAT
A man and his wife were having an argument about who
should brew the coffee each morning.
The wife said, ""You should do it, because you get up first,
and then we don't have to wait as long to get our coffee.""
The husband said, "" You are in charge of cooking around here and
you should do it, because that is your job, and I can just wait for my
coffee.""
Wife replies, ""No, you should do it, and besides, it is in the Bible that the man should do the coffee.""
Husband replies, ""I can't believe that, show me.""
So she fetched the Bible, and opened the New Testament
and showed him at the top of several pages, that it indeed
says..........""HEBREWS""

THE SILENT TREATMENT
A man and his wife were having some problems at home and were giving each
other the silent treatment. Suddenly, the man realized that the next day,
he would need his wife to wake him at 5:00 AM for an early morning business
flight.
Not wanting to be the first to break the silence (and LOSE), he wrote on a
piece of paper,
""Please wake me at 5:00 AM."" He left it where he knew she would find it.
The next morning, the man woke up, only to discover it was 9:00 AM
and he had missed his flight. Furious, he was about to go and
see why his wife hadn't wakened him, when he noticed a piece of paper by
the bed. The paper said, ""It is 5:00 AM. Wake up.""

***Men are not equipped for these kinds of contests.
God may have created man before woman,
but there is always a rough draft before the masterpiece.***"

"event","Can I just say that this weekend was great.  I'm gonna start the recap on Saturday, because that's when the fun began.  I spent Saturday afternoon down in Melissa's playing hairstyler.  Her and Chliana were going to the Warren Semiformal, and I had a lot of fun helping them get ready.  After that, I met up with the rest of the girls.  Me, Ashley, Lindsay, Nicole, Naz, Justine (Naz's friend), and Laura (Nicole's friend from work) all went to the Mae concert.  It was so much fun.  The Audition and Lovedrug opened.  After an awesome performance by The Audition and a somewhat boring (in my opinion) one by Lovedrug, Mae came out.  They were so much better than when we saw them in Pomona last May despite the fact that they were sick.  Afterwards, we got autographs from all the guys in The Audition.  They were some of the coolest guys I have ever met! We were just talking to them and it was just really chill because they are all 19 and 20.  We wanted to meet Mae, especially because it was Nicole's b-day, but they left as soon as their performance was over.  Before we left, we actually gave The Audition one of our phone numbers...they didn't call though.  After the concert, we started back in Nicole and Lindsay's room.  We had a margarita night and watched the best of Will Farrell.  But then, we ended up at the guys apartment, where there is always a party.  Adam's girlfriend Sonya and I had a lot of fun laughing at this girl who was chasing after Adam's friend Sean.
Today was even better than yesterday.  Melissa and I went to California Adventure because we had free passes.  On the way there, we hit the worst traffic I have ever seen.  Highway 5 was stopped.  It was basically a parking lot.  We stood at the same spot for like 20 minutes.  It was pretty funny though, because people ended up sitting on the tops of their cars and running around.  Once the traffic started moving, we saw a bunch of cop cars, and Melissa even saw feet sticking out of a body bag. Note: I later found out that a Marine was killed in a motorcycle accident.  We finally made it to Disneyland at like 1.  The 2 of us had so much fun.  As we were going to the House of Blues for dinner, we decided to act like idiots (which we do best) and skip through Downtown Disney with our arms linked.  After dinner, we headed home.  The ride was filled woth the 2 of us singing at the top of our lungs (so fun!).  Once we got back to campus, we were still hyper, and continued to skip and jump from Gilman all the way to our building.  What can I say, we are wierdos, but I love that girl.  Now, I should be reading, but of course I decided to update my live journal instead."

"event","i haven't updated this since forever, so let me start with the end of finals.  once finals ended, i went to the airport to pick up my cousin marco.  he stayed with me in san diego for a couple of days, partying and shopping.  on sunday, we drove home with veronica.  the first few days of break were fun...i spent a lot of time with veronica, showing her around the area where i live.  on tuesday, i drove up to folsom (near sac) to visit my aunt, dropping veronica off on the way up.  that was a hectic 4 days filled with shopping, baking, and chasing around my cousins, but i got to visit melissa one night, which was fun.  on saturday, i drove the 3 hours home in the pouring rain and had to baby-sit, and thankfully earning more shopping money.  the next whole week of break was horrible, considering i spent most of it in bed or on the couch...i hate being sick.  christmas was fun. i was given the task of dessert, so i baked apple pie and biscotti.  i spent christmas eve going to church and having dinner with my dad's side of the family, which completely revolved around my 3-year old cousin.  christmas day started with breakfast at the neighbors, and off to my grandma's house for dinner with my mom's side of the family, again crazy because there were 5 kids between the ages of 5 and 9.  i didn't care though, i was just excited that i got a new computer.  the week after christmas was pretty busy.  i went to see the family stone with my mom on monday.  on tuesday was the day of christmas exchanges. wednesday was my day to relax.  on thursday i went out to dinner with lindsay and we exchanged christmas presents.  on friday, i went out to lunch with my dance teacher and then saw the producers with my cousin, which is not as good as the stage version, and then experienced one of the worst dinners, considering a 45min wait turned into 2 hours.  on saturday, i went into the city with marco and had lunch with my aunt and uncle.  then the 2 of us went to union square so he could return some christmas presents.  we also had fun yelling at tourists.  later that night, i went to lindsay's house for new year's eve.  it was a pretty mellow night.  we got drunk with her mom and her mom's boyfriend while playing boardgames and listening to everthing that happened to her sister at the bars that night.  the next day, i had to get up early to baby-sit my cousin.  then, we all went up to my grandma's for the new year's day tradition: my grandpa's homemade mexican dinner...yum.  monday was really fun.  we all went up into the city and went shopping at h&m and zara, made even better since my mom payed for everything.  on tuesday, my grandma came over, and she taught me how to make clam chowder, red of course, since its my favorite.  on wednesday, i went shopping, again, and met steph at starbucks.  i was so glad that i got a chance to see her and we talked for hours.  i jsut wish i got to see stephanie lorenzo, but she had family stuff to deal with.  on thursday, lindsay and i left for southern california.  we stopped in disneyland, staying over thursday and friday night.  we had a bunch of fun even though it was packed.  on saturday, the 2 of us drove down to san diego.  once i was unpacked, we went to dinner at islands and saw rumor has it.  on sunday, i met my new roommie taylor, she's really nice, but i still don't know why chanae left, and then lindsay and i went to brunch, and then to fashion valley.  lindsay got her second holes.  then we went to corvette diner and then back home to watch a movie.  on monday classes started.  all of them seem doable.  i can't help but laugh at my mae  9 professor, he doesn't seem to know much about computers.  afterwards, lindsay and i watched another movie and made polenta for dinner, my favorite.  then we watched another movie.  this morning lindsay went home, i was sad to see her leave because i haven't seen her this much since we were like 12.  i had no classes today, so i just ran errands.  and then nicole and i went to roy's for a chocolate souffle, so good.  now, i need to do hum reading and download some program for my computer class."

"event","Today I was just exploring on myspace, and I decided to look at my group profiles.  One of the groups I am in is in memory of Kelly Shea Gallo, and amazing woman who left this earth way before her time.  One of the other members had posted a link to a video clip of Kelly decribing her battle.  Upon watching this vido, I started thinking about Kelly and how much I miss her every day.
I met Kelly when I was almost 6 years old.  She was one of the lifeguards and swim instructors at the pool where I took swimming lessons.  Truth be told, I was rather intimidated by her at first.  She always spoke her mind, and always challenged you.  I didn't join her class until 2 years later.  During the year, Kelly taught 6th grade Englishl and History at a local middle school.  She also played softball with the Marges, a team that never won, considering most of the players, including my mom, were more concerned with going to a bar after the game than actually playing.  Kelly also coached girls varsity basketball at a high school, the favorite coach.  As the years went on, I watched Kelly get married and have two daughters, the adorable Mia and Chloe.  In the summer of 1997, Kelly was no longer a swim instructor to me, but my boss.  I became one of the lackeys at Meadows Swim Club where Kelly, her sister Tracey, brothers Kevin and Brian, and mom Caroline all were lifeguards.  It was the family business.  I worked at that pool for six summers.  They were some of the best summers of my life.  I soon became the favored lackey, known as Kelly's ""personal slave,"" doing her hair, getting her food, and always supplying her with Coke, her drink of choice.  I even taught her classes for her on occasion.  When I wasn't in the pool, I could usually be found baby-sitting the girls, usually praying that  Chloe didn't hurt me.  In the summer of 2003, I decided not to work at the pool.  I only saw Kelly once, when I was picking my brother up from the pool.  That August, she was diagnosed with advance-stage breast cancer.  She was 35.  Despite this hurdle, she decided to continue teaching and coaching.  That year, I attended breast cancer walks in her memory, and prayed for her constantly.  But I never saw her again.  On May 3, 2004, Kelly passed away, just two weeks shy of her 36th bithday.  Her daughters were 7 and 3.  That funeral was the saddest one I have been to in my life.  Since then I have thought about her often, almost every day, mostly regretting the fact that I never saw her again.  

This link takes you directly to a video clip of her.  I want to all to watch it.  It will truly inspire you to never give up, because she never did.  The video is titled ""The Fight for Her Life""

"event","So, I've been back at school for about 1 week now, and let me say it has been interesting.  After moving in on Sunday, the girls and I went to Soup Plantation for dinner.  There, Lindsay told some wierd waiter named Henry that it was my birthday, and he kept serenading me...wierd, I know.  It was so great to be back together with everyone after being home for the summer.  Monday was pretty boring, since I had to buy books, get my parking permit, etc., but I did get to have lunch with Veronica.  I didn't realize how much I had missed her over the summer.
Now comes Tuesday night, the highlight of my 1st week.  All us girls went to Rosaritom and it was awesome.  First, we ate dinner at Iggy's Corner, and the drinking began.  After dinner, we went to the hotel bar, where there was a 5 drinks for $11 special.  I definitely got my money's worth.  The bartender Jorge was so cool, he even let Ashley, Liz, and Nicole go behind the bar.  After that, these 3 guys we met wanted to go to Papas n Beer, and they offered to buy our drinks there.  Well...at least that's what we told the bartenders.  These guys didn't speak a word of Spanish, so we were making fun of them, especially the short one (El Corto), with the bartender.  The next morning, we went horseback riding on the beach, and then it was back across the border to recover.  
On Thursday, classes started again, pretty boring, but that night, Ashley, Nicole, and I  made chicken teriyaki bowls.  After classes on Friday, Liz, Ashley, Lindsay, Brandon, and I went to the Men's H2O Polo game against LMU.  Then I went to BJs for dinner with Julia.  Later that night was pretty chill, and I even saw Nick, which was nice since I haven't talked to him in awhile.
Saturday was a pretty busy day.  Veronica and I went to Target, Ralph's, and Islands.  It was there that I realized that I lost my ID card.  That night, Ashley made dinner for me and her parents, and I spent the rest of the night talking with Anna and her friend Tim about Sea World.  Sunday, I stayed in, doing homework and baking biscotti.  Tonight, I'm cooking my spaghetti with homemade sauce for some friends.  I hope it turns out good."

"event","So today I said goodbye to my dance teacher Genia.  I know it may sound wierd that that is a big deal, but it is.  Genia is like my second mom, and at times I tend to tell her more than I actually tell my real mom.  Last year, I was in tears as I said goodbye to her.  This time, I was sad, but it wasn't so emotional. 
Saying goodbye to her made the fact that my summer is over seem real.  This has been one of the best summers of my life, and I almost wish that it would never end.  I've had so much fun with all my friends, from 3 hour conversations at Starbucks, to random, disjointed ones via 2:00 am drunk phone calls.  
The one thing I can't come to terms with is the fact that in 4 short days, I am leaving the comforts of my home for a campus apartment.  Life has been great with my mom cooking most of my meals and doing my laundry. I've been so spoiled.
But what can I say? I am also ready to get back to my life independent from my parents where I can do what I want when I want.  I am also ready to get back to chilling with my friends that I haven't seen all summer.
Well....to all my friends up here, goodbye.  And all my friends in San Diego, I will see you in a few days"

"event","7 reasons why you never mess with kids


A little girl was talking to her teacher about whales.
The teacher said it was physically impossible for a whale to swallow a human because even though it was a very large mammal, its throat was very small. The little girl stated that Jonah was swallowed by a whale. Irritated, the teacher reiterated that a whale could not swallow a human; it was physically impossible. The little girl said, ""When I get to heaven I will ask Jonah."" The teacher asked, "" What if Jonah went to hell?"" The little girl replied, ""Then you ask him.""


* * *
A Kindergarten teacher: was observing her classroom of children while they were drawing. She would occasionally walk around to see each child's work. As she got to one little girl who was working diligently, she asked what the drawing was. The girl replied, ""I'm drawing God."" The teacher paused and said, ""But no one knows what God looks like."" Without missing a beat, or looking up from her drawing, the girl replied, ""They will in a minute.""


* * *
A Sunday school teacher was discussing the Ten Commandments with her five and six year olds. After explaining the commandment to ""honor"" thy Father and thy Mother, she asked, ""Is there a commandment that teaches us how to treat our brothers and sisters?"" Without missing a beat one little boy (the oldest of a family) answered, ""Thou shall not kill.""


* * *
One day a little girl was sitting and watching her mother do the dishes at the kitchen sink. She suddenly noticed that her mother had several strands of white hair sticking out in contrast on her brunette head. She looked at her mother and inquisitively asked, ""Why are some of your hairs white, Mom?"" Her mother replied, ""Well, every time that you do something wrong and make me cry or unhappy, one of my hairs turns white."" The little girl thought about this revelation for a while and then said, ""Momma, how come ALL of grandma's hairs are white?""


* * *
The children had all been photographed, and the teacher was trying to persuade them each to buy a copy of the group picture. ""Just think how nice it will be to look at it when you are all grown up and say, ""There's Jennifer, she's a lawyer."" or ""There's Michael, he's a doctor."" A small voice at the back of the room rang out, ""And there's the teacher... She's dead. ""


* * *
A teacher was giving a lesson on the circulation of the blood. Trying to make the matter clearer, she said, ""Now, class, if I stood on my head, the blood, as you know, would run into it, and I would turn red in the face."" ""Yes."" the class said. ""Then why is it that while I am standing upright, in the ordinary position, the blood doesn't run into my feet?"" A little fellow shouted, ""Cause your feet ain't empty.""


* * *
The children were lined up in the cafeteria of a Catholic elementary school for lunch. At the head of the table was a large pile of apples. The nun wrote a note and posted it on the apple tray: ""Take only ONE. God is watching."" Moving further along the lunch line, at the other end of the table was a large pile of chocolate chip cookies. A child had written a note, ""Take all you want. God is watching the apples."""

"event","Today a girl that goes to my high school was found murdered with her parents and sister.  The news says that they think the father killed everyone and then himself, making it a murder-suicide.  She was only 17.  While I didn't know her personally, one of my closest friends knew her well, and actually spoke to her today.  It's so frightening how some one can be so alive, and then boom, you find out she's dead.  My heart and prayers go out to her family, friends, and my school community.  This really makes me realize how short life can be, and I know now how lucky I am to be alive each and every day."

"event","so....I haven't been on this thing for over a month, so lets start from the beginning.
After Clear Lake, work turned into an endless series of inside jokes.  Even now, 1 month later, they are still funny.  The week I got back, I started dancing again.  It felt so great to be back in my old dance studio with so many of my friends.  Also, at work, it was finally time for the Rec Staff vs. Pool Staff Challenge.  After many stupid games, we (the Rec Staff) dominated in a game of Prison Ball to win the challenge once again.
The highlight of my summer so far has to be my trip to Maui.  It was so gorgeous.  I almost didn't want to leave.  We went to the beach, snorkeled, visited a volcano, saw the sunrise, and went to the nearby island of Molokai.  It was the best trip of my life.
After Maui, it was back to work as usual.  I was once again thrust into the exciting lives of 4 and 5 year olds.  It was nice to be back and see all my work friends, though.
Last Tuesday, I went to Malibu Golf with my friends from work.  It was an interesting experience, considering everyone besides myself and the other driver were drunk.  Definitely fun though.
So, last week we had our staff appreciation dinner.  Camp doesn't end for 2 more weeks, but my boss wanted to have it before everyone left for school.  Before it started, Steph, Pat, Justin, Tommy, and I met at Josie's house.  After a slide show and awards ( I got the ""Early Bird""), it was back to  Josie's for some fun.  Steph and I ended up running to Jack-in-the-Box for a late-night snack.
The next day was hell, after staying at Josie's til 1, I had to work a 9 hour shift ( 7-4).  I spent the rest of Friday sleeping.
On Saturday, I went to PF Chang, and then to see Wedding Crashers with Lindsay.  It was hilarious.  Sunday, I worked for my other job.  For those of you that don't know, I work for a marketing company that represents Wienerschnitzel.  I basically get paid to go to county fairs, concerts, and radio promotions.  This one was interesting though.  I had to go to Newark to some car junkyard where a radio station was doing a live broadcast.  Quite an interesting place.  The best part was that for once, I didn't have to wear the dog costume.  After that, I went to dinner at Leah's house.
So that's all for now.  I have the Tap Festival this weekend and Clear Lake again next weekend.  This summer has been a blast so far, but I am still counting down the days until I am back in San Diego."

"event","So I just got back from Clear Lake, and it was tons of fun!!!!  It was for everyone from my work, but only 9 of us went.  It was so awesome!!! We stayed at Stephanie's trailer, and we had more fun than I've had in a long time.  Friday night was pretty tame.  After that some of us (me, Adri, Josie, Ray, and Chris) slept inside, while Tommy, Steph, Pat aka DQ aka Drama Queen, and Rachel slept on the trampoline.  The next morning, Tommy thought it would be a good idea to wake us all up at 7:30 with the six-week old puppies that belong to Steph's aunt.  It would have been fine if one of the puppies hadn't pissed on Pat's sleeping bag (I felt so bad for him).  That day was awesome tubing.  I flipped like 3 times, and some people attempted to do tricks.  Last night was awesome.  We had fun times playing King's cup, and there was the great drama that we all love....especially when it involves talking crap about the other people at work.  That's all I have time for now....I'm so tired considering I only got about 7 hours of sleep total.  If you want more details, just ask!!"

The most exciting things are the staff weekend away in Clear Lake next week, and the family trip to Hawaii in a month.  The Lake is going to be so crazy!!!!! I can't wait!!!

On one hand, I'm glad to be able to see some of my other friends and eat actual food instead of Plaza crap, but on the other hand, I am going to miss San Diego.  This past year has been awesome.  I've made some great friends, been to some fun parties, and pulled interesting pranks.  I am never going to forget this year and all the memories.
Last night, I got a drunken phone call from 3 of my friends.  They were all still on campus, and I was glad to hear from them, but I wished I were with them.  I'm not used to going more than a day or two without seeing to ar talking to them.
Well...that's all I have time to write now.  I'll be back soon."

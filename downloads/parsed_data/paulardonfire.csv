How peculiar, how peculiar it is... Look into my eyes, you see me. I look in my eyes. I see the same face, body, eyes. But i am not familiar, i do not feel myself looking back.. What once used to be comforting to know that i am i, is no longer something that i can have for myself.
I cannot be this , but it seems like its not an illusion,then again, who ever knows when they are seeing something illusory. People are, and become, while i just watch, i control and am in complete chaos, i need to manifest I, i need to instill the ego, and become the controller of my life, i will.

This is life, life is living, not seeing , ceoming, i am. I EXIST.

This is the point."

"event","entry begin:
to all those who THINK they are smart, i have some words. If you THINK that you are smarter than other people you shouldnt try and throw it in peoples faces or attempt to prove ur so called smartness by bringing up useless trivia that proves nothing but a 5 second look at a computer screen or a stupid bottle cap or sumthin. Stupid people cannot become smart overnight, stupid people will try and say they are smart to defend themselves when doubted, and get into arguments when denied of belief towards their bs. someone in a class of mine believes he is smart.. and tries to act it... but just makes a fool of himself, he is still ignorant, and has no intelligence past the simple picking up of thoughts.. people like this disgust me..
fuckit, this person will realize they are just as stupid as all the other stupidasses in my class.

This, is to all of my friends whom i often take for granted. I think i treat you all shittier than you deserve, and this bothers me. i dislike that i throw my problems upon you at times, and cause you to do things in my favor when you have other plans, im sorry for hampering you in succeeding by introducing you to certain drugs or alcohol. I never realized how much i need close friends until i began to see them less than i was used to. I have trouble, still, trying to adjust to the changes in few years past. i miss the time when everything was so easy everyone was happy , the days were filled with color, laughter, smiles, mischief... careless living, without a price. I miss the days when all i wanted to do when i got home was go right out and see my friends who i spent most of my best times with, now i come home and sleep, or do nothing productive.. homework and then nothing. I want to achive something, but i never do. I want to involve myself in my school more, but i could care less. i would rather stay with the close friends i have than make new ones, i feel all other people i met and became friends with are still very second rate compared to the people i spent all of my good old days with. No offense to those this concerns, there are other very close to me, but cannot become what my best friends are. Nowadays people seem to be too inconsistent and i cannot hold on to a good friendship more than one person at most. I dont like being at kennedy, i dont like sinking to the low, low ,low ,low level of my peers,mainly those who i am classmates with. I dont like having a second rate education when i know if i tried harder i could achieve a better one at a better place, college  oppritunities are greatly lowered by attending this school. 

i am not happy that i sit here at 11:30 fucking bithcing about life.
its not worth the trouble.
i should really head to sleep, i havent indulged in my six hour sleepathon as i usually do..

i cant wait to drink friday.. its always a good lift.
i rest now.
more to say, but ill save it for another time."

why do people find it necasarry to say hello to every aquantance that passes their direction, when a single look could do just fine and acknowledge them. i dont know. im just spitting out some tyhings that have been plagung my mind recently.

They look up in terror for their sanity begins to run low as they desperately try to justify their existence before it ends ever so suddenly. 

About a third of an hour remains, and they no longer are motivated to struggle again. ""relax, there is only one moment more.. one moment more..."" moment after moment , the windows start to close , the various waves of light from the large glass globe of electical currents can no longer pass into the black holes deep into the mind.

Finally, at rest a slew of memories, hopes, dreams, aspirations, fears, wants, needs, and imagery blast into the air in a beam so powerful it pierces the sky and displays on a dark planet not far from pluto, where the strange will sit atop a large stone while watching the projection of their souls and attempt to understand once more waht it means to be alive.

Just as every being , the strange will be taken off of  their stones and thrown into a new existence just as they had believed an epiphany was in their grasp at last.

"event","your past will always exist as long as you are conscious of it.
Sometimes i wonder why i always start off these journal blogs with some deep weird question... the past two night people have dreamt of me. one was positive, the other was extremely negative...i have some things i'd like to tell some people, most of them are people whom i had left un resolved, some people i would like to make amends with.
MAny issues are cluttering my mind and i cant figure which to type first or even to type at all due to the open-ness of my journal, i almost find it strange to have people i dont know reading my deeper feelings, but then no one would know about it to read anyway so i publicate these entries, it is saturday night, i have done nothing at all.. i am overcome with a huge wave of what can only be called 
""downing or mood decline""
i ahve that kind of feeling where you wish to be anything but sober and be with that person who matters most, so for once you can be in that perfect state of completion..( circa survive really revvs up your writing abilities by flowing your ideas).. i keep looking at the screen, at the half of a page or so that i have just written and completely loose my train of thought... no nevermind, my train of though gains about 80 more mph and i cant concentrate on anything other than it. ( matt says goodbye to me and leaves, while at the time i had happen to make a perfect tree out of a split incense stick stuck into a candle.. i want to burn it.) i lit another incense..i have nothing prominent on my mind at the moment and it pretty much is a let down, because im just in one of those weird ass moods
smoke is perfect. it looks amazing, it is silky, then violently uniform and rigid, or perfect repetitions of a pattern more complex than the words i wish i could use.
the incense is travelling past my screen and reflevted light makes it light up a bluish grey as it continues waht is only described as intriguing.
i wish  could be as the smoke is. just light, constantly changing, just a wisp in the air. two silky ribbons of smoke pass my eyes as i look over them with eyes filled with joy, the ribbons twist and turn and fade away before my meyes, i am obsessing over this insence smoke but it really is amazing.
maybe iu should write something with a meaning tonight, maybe i should get fucked up on something , i a m not sure, i really need something to intoxicate my mind. this hasnt had one solid direction of thought since i have started..
i think this should really gain one by now... but not in this entry ... the next one."

"event","much is well.
i was pleased to see my report card for the first semester i hope i can keep myself on the right track until the end of the year, possible achieve the new bass i have been hoping for. it is difficult though when the third comes around you feel this lack of will power. i dont understand why. i think there should be a big break in between the semesters and call off the spring break therefor making it easier for people to get their shit together and then be ready to complete the year successfully, i think that there really isnt too much to succeeding especially in kennedy. if you are not lazy and careless the year goes by quick and really simply. i learned that this year so far.
i have picked up an old friend who i wish not to bring with me any longer, although its hard i really do not like the after effect. i am choosing to quit smokin the good stuff for a loooooong time, maybe on special occasions, probably not. Its really hard though when u go to a school crawling with pot smoking peers, and they are your friends also, i feel doing this is a step towards an improved will power and discipline.. anyway, i have to go to the driving range tomorrow, woo hoo, too bad i wont be drivin until im 18 ha.

"event","impending doom, it creeps up your spine doesnt it?
You know, that feeling you get just as something is coming your way , and you cant make it stop.
You know, when you sit in a chair facing the other way and at any moment someone or someting can be creeping up behind you, and with the element of surprise on their side, suceed at taking whichever action they please.
(i looked over my shoulder)
Have you ever noticed those eerie things that just dont make sense?, things that bother you but you cannot find out what haunts you about them?
For example..-i am sitting by the computer in my basement, and i look over my shouldr to see a single wooden chair which is not in any way eerie, but for some reason this chair facing in your direction bothers you,it sends a slight chill up your spine. why does it bother you that this chair completely innocent and lacking any sort of meaning or frightening quialities, just annerves you so?
Does the mind give the illusion of disorder as something to fear? does the mind expect that seat to be filled? 
ive just come to the conclusion that with humans, order is peace. I believe that a vast empty atmosphere where there is never a visible end is the most relaxing scene for the human mind, Although an empty room with four walls visible  and plain, is annerving  because according the principle of oder=peace all spaces where possible, and equally distributed should be filled to some extent. If an open space is present it must be harmonious and equal on the space it takes up. a slightly more disturbing example one may see in horror films would be a person with an eye missing and just an open hole where the eye should have been, often scary characters in films will have things missing so subtle that your mind notices it and it bothers it, but you are looking at the image as a whole, which prohibits you from noticing said small details.
 Before I get too off track here, i would like to finish my example with the chair. Now certain actions can sometimes slightly improve the situation by simply re arragning the direction or manner of which the object is currently in. With my chair facing me empty as it is, i can simply turn it so that it faces the wall but on an un even angle, therefore making it register with my mind that this situation is just plain dishevelment of objects in my surroundings.. althought this does not completely solve the problem it will make it easier for the human mind to dismiss it.  

---Another situations that proves the point  of order=peace is when the mind cannot concentrate or function fully when there is an array of misplaced things visible to the eye in the rooms you may be in. This may be because the mind might be sending messages saying ""this is crowded, fix it"". or possibly it may trigger off a feeling of unsureness because the mess in the room seems uneven, like the feeling you get on a slanted fragile bridge or when upside down on a carnival ride or when walking a narrow path with many people.

my thoughts are running dry on this topic now."

NO  no fucking more .... i am not pleading a straight edge thing... but i am no longer going to fry my brain with chemicals... NO MORE GOD DAMN MEDICINE...
marijuana is ok in moderation...alcohol is harmless haha... so im not worried about htis.. but i feel like i have a new mindset at this time... i think its from thinkin i always am fucking with myself and im not even finished developing yet... i have so much better potential in me.! why cant i embrace i for once... i feel like i push it away to be what i am not..
but why i dfont fit in anyway...DO you want to know who i want to be?
i want to be who my brother is... the successful son, the smarter son.. the son with a strong sense of goals and knows where he wants to go in life.. who am i...
I am the son who feels like he should live to discover be what he isnt and then dies knowing he failed... i have goals... i have ambitions, i have things i wish for... but do i strive as i should for them..NO i  instead waste away these things with everthing i am not to be... i kill away the person i want... i take stabs at this mystery man, who i wish i was... but you know what... i cant not be who i think i am... the truth is.. i am who i see myself to be... i just havent become them yet... i keep living in the future, but im not quite there yet... i should let my life unfold as it should... the thing about trying to fugure ureself out is thatere are so many fucking different complexities you dont know where to start or begin... you feel like yo have it and then you realize the whole other part of the spectrum of human emotions..so now i stop at this point because i am exhausted and cannot think to straight anymore.... it is not worth it to take advantage of myself when i have such a wonderful gift at birth.. with these words i still feel my point hasnt been givin the justice it deserves but it has been staed somewhere in these lines of bullshit no one is going to read... i feel i said what i said... i got what i wasnted oput of this...therefore im fuckin done."

Lets say that one day someone is thrown over a bridge or sumthing... and their body is floating in the water... (a low bridge) then as im passing by a gust of wind blows adn some of my hairs fly off of me along with any other loose peice of dna.... then as the wind setteles the remnants of what hasnt fallen into the water lands on the dead body, just so perfectly that it would still be there when the officer or civilian finds and the inspection goes underway...my identity is now linked to this crime which i never knew, and so one day as im sittin at home prolly sleeping or eating i have some detectives arrive at my door and arrest me.. now im being questioned in a small dim room... they show me pictures of the suspect.. it is my co worker at my job... i often come by this person to pick up documents and what not..i am also loinked to a piece of evidence dropped nearby , which happened to be a glove i had lost a few weeks before while reachin out the window to adjust my side mirror. they tell me that i am the only dna on the body which i am suspected for murdring... but i never knew ... now i have no true way to show i am innocent beacuse the officers are so insistant... they lock me up for the night..., as im in the cell with another frail dying looking man, he turns to me and grrabs my neck twists pulls. DEAD i fall to the floor with a dull thump, The next day an officer comes to the cell and says ur free to go...but it was too late the man who killed my co worker was the same man who had just killed me.."

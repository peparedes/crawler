"event","I haven't updated in almost a month. I haven't felt like it. A lot has gone on, but it all seems irrelevant. It's like everything in my life just goes aroung in circles and it seems kind of redundant to keep writing about it. I feel like everything is so chaotic and I have all of these unanswered questions, but it seems like there's never anyone here to even listen to my fears. Maybe they've all heard enough. I don't know. But sometimes I wish that someone cared. Not just anyone, someone I love. I have a lot of friends, but I feel like they don't really know ME. I that the ones who really understood me weren't so distant now. I don't know what happened, but I feel like I've lost everybody that really meant something to me. The people I care about never tell me what's going on. They don't seem to care what's going on with me either. I guess I'm just bad at letting people go. But I don't understand why those that mean so much to me are just drifting away... 

Thrown away, a new one came 
in the mail from a far off oriental land,
a metal heart that won't fall apart
when a casket sinks into the sand,
and time ticks away the youth in me
and makes sure that I grow old and bland,
a clocks springs and metal wind up,
parts explode within my hand.
I hold my heart that ticks for you
as it spasms in my chest,
Fall to my knees; drown in blood red seas, 
which pour endlessly from wrists,
This metal heart stops short
and I attempt to fill my lungs with air,
I close my eyes, I drift away- 
I finally see things clear.


I feel so caught up in the fluttering chariots of obsession.
I feel so stuck in the colorful cheeks of boredom.
I feel as though I am not able to leave the harsh pools of death.
I feel so dull to the doorways of denial.
I feel myself staring into the shy eyes of doubt.
And yet i know I'm on the dancing clouds of Love.
But I feel unprotected to the crawling bruises of my heart.


When a tear rolls down your cheek
a clear drop of liquid
you start to weep
its called sadness
you've seen it before
it just comes knocking at your front door
knock
knock
knock
you say whose there
it never really answers
it tries to scare you
so you'll scream then you wake up
to realize life's a dream."

"event","1. Bush Jr. deserted his unit during Vietnam and was reportedly AWOL for over a year from his assigned unit: The Texas Air National Guard, or as it's referred to by other military outfits, the ""Champagne Division"".
2. First president in US history to refuse United Nations election inspectors.
3. All-time US and world record holder for most corporate campaign donations.
4. The Bush administration had twice as many FBI agents fighting the drug war than fighting terrorism prior to 9/11.
5. John Ashcroft.
6. Failed to fulfill promise to get Osama Bin Laden ""dead or alive"".
7. Wasted federal resources on a PR trip to Baghdad where he staged a Thanksgiving meal at 6 AM with troops that were screed based on political affiliation. And the Turkey? It was a prop.
8. His refusal to fire- or even reprimand- Lt. General Jerry ""Our God is bigger than their God"" Boykin. Perhaps it's because Boykin said of the president, ""George Bush was not elected by a majority of voters in the United States. He was appointed by God. He's in the white house because God put him there"". Is that what they're calling a rigged election these days?
9. After sending troops to die in an unjust and unprovoked war, he still has yet to attend any soldiers' funerals. 
10. He is the first president in US history to enter office with a criminal record.
11. Bush Jr. has set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously protest a leader, shattering the record for protests against ANY person in the history of mankind.
12. He slashed funding to the Violence Against Women Act.
13. Under his Clear Skies Initiative, power plants are now allowed to emit triple the amount of highly-toxic mercury into the environment. 
14. He has taken more vacation time than any president in US history, including a 28-day vacation right before 9/11.
15. He pulled out of the Kyoto agreement on global warming, which had been agreed upon by 178 other countries.
16. He set the record for most executions by any governor in American history. 152 in total; some of whom were mentally disabled.
17. Choked on a pretzel and nearly lost his life while seated in front of the TV.
18. He has donated a whopping 35 million dollars to the nations nearly destroyed by the Tsunami. He is spending 40 million on his inauguration ceremony and parade, the same amount that is spent in four hours of fighting in Iraq. 35 million doesn't seem like so much anymore does it?
19. He refused to buy adequate body armor for our troops in Iraq. 25% of battle casualties could have been prevented by better armor.
20. Responsible for the highest US trade deficit EVER: $43.1 billion dollars.

Okay, I lied. I have more than 20 reasons....

21. He approved the sale of $20 million dollars worth of shackles, electro-shock technology and other torture devices to countries that have been condemned for torture.
22. His administration illegally produced fake pro-Bush ""news"" spots for the Dept. of Health and Human Services. They went as far as to include phony journalists who praise Dubya's controversial Medicare Bill and the added a fake crowd to cheer the whole things on.
23. he is a religious fanatic that believes in the apocalypse and that ONLY Evangelical Christians are eligible for the afterlife. Catholics, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and everyone that isn't in Bush's flock are all doomed to Hell. 
24. He dropped his dog on its head."

I guess I don't really don't have that much to talk about...I just felt like writing something. Me and my mom just got in a big fight. I got mad at her because I feel like I am the only one that ever does anything around here and it is really starting to piss me off. She is home twice as much as I am and I'm the one that has to find time to get everything done, between being in school and doing homework and doing all this work for my dad. It's stupid, but sometimes it just really bugs me and I get really stressed. Well, things with James are...confusing again. Well not really confusing, I just can't think of the right word. When Robert broke up with me, he was really there for me and he was being such a sweetheart, so we started to hang out again. Now he comes over almost every weekend. But the thing is, we started having sex again. I guess I'm just not one of those people that can fuck a guy that I have know for so long and not have it mean anything. I have started to really like him again. And it feels really weird like sometimes when we're hanging out he'll tell me how much he loves Allysa. I just so jelous. I feel like the only thing we have is sex, and he gets what he needs in a realtionship when he is with her. I just want to be the only one I guess. It's not that I feel like h's using me, because I'm not saying no or anything. I just feel sort of empty. I know that's cliche but I don't know how else to describe it...I told me that he isn't going to break up with her, and I never expected him to, I just wish he would acknowledge the fact that he doesn't really love her if he is cheating on her. But whatever I got myself into it...I just want a normal relationship with a nice guy..."

"event","Love is for the weak-minded, 
In my opinion. 
What is love anyway? 
Constant heartbreak and sorrow? 
A figment of the imagination is what it is. 
Created to give the lonely, weak-minded people.
A sense of belonging, security, and most of all hope. 

Or is it just a feeling the heart wishes for. 
A feeling that would make people feel like there is
something unknown and exciting to live for. 
Love is like a dream I guess. 
You always think about it. 
You always wonder what it means. 
And sometimes you even think it's real."

Im just sort of dragging myself out of bed and going through the motions everyday. I guess I haven't been really depressed, just sort numb and...blah. It's not because of Robert though...I am starting to like being single because I can flirt with whoever I want whenever I want and not have to worry about making someone else happy, but at the same time I kind of miss having a boyfriend. I just miss feeling like someone really cares about me, and having someone that I can talk to whenever I need to get something off of my chest. It doesn't really upset me as much anymore when I see Robert with Sam. I still wonder how he could just forget about me so easily, and I wonder if he ever really cared at all. And deep down I wish that things wouldn't work out between them. They just seem so happy together and it just looks so natural when he is holding her. Its something that we only had for a couple of weeks and then it didn't even seem like we were going out. It pisses me off that he can just be like that with her and not even think about me. I know it's fucked up to want thing to mess up, but he hurt me and I'm mad about it. JESUS I need to stop writing about Robert...I'm never gonna get over him this way...but actually, I'm not really sad about it anymore, just mad, so that's a start right?"

She was my friend but I really wouldn't feel bad if he did that to her. She is acting like such a bitch now to everyone, not just me. Although she is talking shit about me behind my back.

He was the best guy I could've asked for. He treated me so good and he was funny and hot and sometimes he even showed me that sensitive side that he was so secretive about and he made me feel special. Part of me thought that my luck with guys finally changed and I finally found the right one. It's not that I thought we were gonna get married or anything like that, but I just really cared about him. Too bad I was wrong. I guess it started a month ago. He just stopped acting like he cared very much. He never showed me any affection and he pretty much acted like I wasn't important at all.It wasn't that bad though, so I didn't talk to him about it, I knew he was busy, but I guess it sort of pushed me away from him. The last couple of weeks were really bad he never called me or returned any of my calls, he barely even touched me, and it hurt. I had all this stuff going on in my life that I wanted to tell him, but it was so hard because of how he was acting, so I didn't. I just let us get farther apart. Then whe I finally decided that I had to talk to him before it was too late, he beat me to it. He just said ""I don't think we should go out anymore"". No explanation. But I was too shocked to ask for one. So I acted strong, like I didn't care and I let him walk away without explaning. And that's it. I feel like shit becasue I cared about him so much and he doesn't care about me anymore obviously. It hurts so bad to see him all over other girls like he never cared about me. I am so upset and he is having so much fun...he just toatally moved on and never looked back. I wish I could make him care. I wish I could make him hurt like I am...I know that sounds really cliche...but I don't know what to do."

I don't understand him anymore; I went out with him for over a year, but I feel like I don't even know him. Not only has he turned into such a whore, he says these things to me that are so incredibly fucked up, and he acts like it is this innocent little game. He tells me how bad I treated him and how he's glad I'm with someone I finally care about. I didn't actually realize how much I miss him until I talked to him last night. He went on and on about this new girlfriend he has and how much he loves her and how she is so much better than I was, and I actually cried. I didn't think he meant that much to me anymore...Or maybe it's just the thought that I went through so much for him the whole time we went out and I loved him so much, but now it seems like I didn't mean shit to him. I want him to be happy...but there is this selfish part of me that wishes he was a little more upset about this. Well, maybe not upset...I just wish it wasn't so easy for him to move on. I know that sounds so fucked up, but it really hurts. I don't know if he is just pretending he is so happy so that I will get jelous and realize I want him back, or if he relly is happier. I have never seen him like this, though. He isn't so quiet and serious and depressed all of the time. I don't know...maybe I did screw up his life. But I guess he kinda screwed up mine in a way, so we're even then. No matter how upset I am about this, I still don't regret my decision. Especially when James says things to me that make him sound like a total asshole...I don't understand how he could love me so much and within 2 weeks treat me like shit and make me miserable. Oh well. I guess I should be thinking about my relationship with Robert instead. Not that I don't...I think about it a lot, I just feel bad about this whole thing. It isn't fair to Robert to let James do this to me whether it is intentional or not. I talked to Robert for so long last night...and he told me so much...it was rally cool. He hardly ever shows me that side of him. Everytime I see him or talk to him I like him even more. The feeling I have with him is so different than anything I felt with another guy. It's close to how I felt with James at the beginning, but I things with James were too rushed so I guess it's different. I couldn't tell Robert that I am in love with him right now and actually mean it, but if we stay together I definatly think I will love him one day. I have been looking for a guy like him for so long, and I really don't want to screw things up. I have all these problems from other relationships that usually ruin things with my boyfriends. But I am trying so hard to make sure that doesn't happen this time. I want to take things slow with him, but at the same time part of me wants to jump into it all at once. I guess that would ruin the fun though."

I guess it's a good thing though; I mean I wouldn't want him being as obsessed with me in the beginning as James was, and I wouldn't want him to tell me he loves me if he didn't mean it. At first it was frustrating, though...just because I'm not used to it. I really care about him, and I don't want to lose him anytime soon. I guess I just look ahead too much. Like sometimes I think about how he's graduating next year and going to college...and I won't get to see him very much, and what if he gets tired of me? But I guess I shouldn't even be looking that far ahead. I should just be happy with him now and not worry about what's going to happen a year from now. I am trying to do that, but I am so used to thinking about the future (with James) that it's kind of hard not to. But whatever happens will happen whether I waste my time trying to figure it out or not. For now, I am really happy that I took a risk and chose Robert. I haven't been this happy in so long...and it feels really good. lol he would be so excited if he knew I made a whole entry just about him...."

I do love him still, and I think I always will. A first love isn't that easy to forget. I just don't think that I could ever feel the same about him afer what he did to me. I wanted to forgive him and forget about it, but I only managed to do the forgiving part. I have spent so long being unhappy, pretending that everything was working out, that I forgot what it was like to actually be happy. I was just dragging things out with James, trying to pretend like we could still have a realtionship because I am so attached to him. SO afraid of being without him that I couldn't even imagine myself without him. If it weren't for Robert I don't think I would have ever realized that things between me and James were hopeless. I started to care about him so much, which made me question my realtionship with James. How could he be right for me if I have such strong feelings for this other guy? I think that if you really love someone, there wouldn't be that issue of liking other people...if you're really meant to be, then why would you want someone else? Well, I want Robert. And it's not just one of those little ""what if..."" things. I could've gotten over that, stayed with James, been ""happy"". I gave it time, too. I wanted it to be one of those little innocent crushes that fade as fast as they appear. I wanted to realize that I couldn't be with Robert. I even wanted to be able to look back on this and think ""how could I have been so stupid? Robert didn't mean anything to me"". But it didn't work out that way. The thing is, it wasn't an innocent crush...It wasn't just one of those passing phases of wanting something different. Now that things are over with James, I'm actually relieved. I am crushed, but relieved. I finally got the courage to do something that I've know in my heart was right for so long. I love James, but I wasn't happy. And I have Robert to thank for making me see that."

I felt crushed, but I decided that he wasn't worth it and he never would be...once a cheater always a cheater, remember? Of course, that state of mind lasted for about a day. Then I decided I should forgive him...he didn't mean to. I read this quote...""Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all that they have."" and then I thought that he just made a mistake...people are entitled to make mistakes, right? I told him that I couldn't do anything phisically for a while, but that I'll eventually forgive him. I made it clear that he was gonna have to work hard to fix our relationship. I thought I would never forgive him, but it's only been a couple weeks since I found out, and I already forgave him. I saw that it was tearing him apart...I know that he didn't mean to hurt me...I know that he loves me. ""You can fogive someone, but you can never forget the way they made you feel""...I knew I wouldn't be able to trust him for awhile, and he knew that too. But now I am starting to feel like our relationship is in too many pieces to put back together. I have been hurt too many times before, and he sounded so sincere when he told me that he would be the one guy who treated me right...and that he would never hurt me. I truly believe that he meant what he said...I know he didn't intend to betray me from the start. But I have built the wall around my heart again, only this time I don't think he can tear it down. I am trying, I really am, I just don't think it's possible anymore. When I am with him, I feel like I couldn't live without him, but when we are apart, I don't miss him quite as much as I used too. I am even starting to feel like it's not even worth bothering to fix things. When he isn't with me, I already feel like I am free to do what I want...I am talking to guys and making plans with them without even bothering to tell him. Before he did this, I wouldn't have even let another guy look at me the wrong way without feeling guilty. I could never keep a secret from him because I felt like I loved him to much to do that...I told him everything, and he told me everything. Now I don't find it quite so hard to just not tell him something that I know would upset him. June 5th will be a year for us, and I used to be so excited, I used to feel like that was so important and that we had to be together and do something special on that day. Now, it means nothing to me...I just don't care anymore. I do love him still. I love him with all of my heart, but deep down I know it's over. I don't know if I'm willing to admit that to him yet, I'm not sure that I'm ready to live without him. He has been my world for a year...this is coming from a girl that used to get bored with the same guy after a week. I truly love him. I just don't feel like I can ever trust him again. I don't feel like I can get close to him like we used to be. And without that, we don't have anything. After what we had, I can't just go one with him, starting over from scratch. He has always put me through so much stress, but I love him and that's part of being in a relationship...I think...but I just can't deal with it anymore...I'm too tired emotionally to be put through this anymore."

or girls wearing combat boots and apathy
but who cares anymore?
smile and nod
quietly conform
no disaffected youth here...
or so they thought"

"event","Inside I don't live here
not in this pink shuttered house,
with the basement that floods,
with the ""home is where the heart is"" on the mantle
my heart is dead,
my home means nothing to me,
there's no hope left inside
only open cuts and old scars.
They hurt too much...
I can't do this anymore"

"event","the faithless stars kissing black blankets
of the night sky, falling into lusts.
forgotten whispers
cries dripping into the void
of what once was
reaching up at the cold gray moon each night
suffocated by the inevitable
their incurable sadness eating away at their soul
beneath her shell of timid strength 
and fake smiles covering her bruises,
she smiles of broken swings and mud pies
inside she dies
little girl within, weeping willow
the disappearing princess
where have her diamonds gone?
where is mommy to kiss away the tears?
battered baby's crying arms reaching up
to the night sky
the devil within, hold me tight
help her to forget
lost in the lavender
gazing up at her gasoline rainbow
baby's arms are scarred, tattered and torn
ghosts of tomorrow laced with believe-me knots
glued on her holocaust ride
she smiles,
she pretends,
seeing through her teary-eyed kisses,
of no name visits
and late night passion"

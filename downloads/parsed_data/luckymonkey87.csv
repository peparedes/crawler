"event","I was just sitting here thinking of summers I have had and I was remembering a really good summer and taking a music quiz and Britney Spear's lucky was on the music quiz and it reminded me of the summer I spent in Texas with Tina. I miss her so much I realized. We used to be inseperable and best friends and now we barely talk. I used to always call her when something was wrong and she would do the same. so I guess this entry is just really because I miss her so much and I miss that summer. 


Its weird how quickly things can change"

"event","Greeley was so much fun yesterday! I went up for orientation and well lets just say I thought I would completely dislike it due to leaving most of my friends behind here. To my surprise I honestly loved it... completely 100%... i just feel like I can fit in there or as my uncle puts it ""It feels just right""! I got my UNC Card and I honestly am still sad to be leaving friends here but I will see them I know!! I am very very very excited for August and moving to Greeley though!!!"

"event","So I am officially done with drinking because last night reminded me of how I hate being out of control and believe last night I was. I am not saying those who drink are bad or whatever I am just saying its not for me. This is not just because I was hungover this morning its also because I now get why some people choose not to drink and well I don't really like the taste of most alcohol so I am officially not drinking until one glass of wine on my 21st birthday... I know I can hold out because I dunno last night even though while fun because I hung out with my friends proved to be a learning lesson that drinking is just not for me."

"event","So taking Psychology was the best thing I ever did this semester because it's helped me determine my major and taught me soooooo much. We also have the best class ever because everyone is so nice and it's awesome. Everyone gets along really well and we have become friends and like a little family..it's going to be sad to leave all of them behind. I know I will see some of them again but I know I am not going to stay in touch with everyone. I am def. going to keep in touch with Markelle... she's been such an amazing friend this semester... she is fun to talk to and she always gives the greatest advice. I can tell her almost everything and I know she won't judge me. She's one of the nicest girls I have ever met. 

Hopes for next semester: 
I will meet some more cool people and hopefully have a class with T, Markelle, Katie, Paige, Abbey, or Nicolle! I am soooo happy I have a class with Melody!!!

Missing the girlys!! Can't wait to see T tomorrow!!

It's nice that T, Emily, Melody and Nicolle are in this class but seriously the only thing I am being taught is how to socialize and that would be fine if I wasn't paying for it. I missed everyone in this class except the teacher... I mean the people in the class are pretty awesome except the dynamic duo who sit in the front row who act like valley girls. It's sooooooo annoying...Bio next yay!!! Abbey and Nicolle chatting time hehe and well I actually learn in that class well thats if I pay attention.

I try to look back to two weeks ago and remember exactly what it was like but it all seems like one big dream followed by one long nightmare with some good parts to it.  I don't know it feels like the world has stopped spinning or that time is going faster.  I feel so numb sometimes and I wish I didn't.  I also feel empty sometimes... I don't cry but I will sit and stare at something for a long time and just feel nothing but emptiness... like a part of me is gone.  I wrote a little today but the idea of the story is too plain... it needs more creativity but I can't seem to put that in.  I want to be back to my normal dreamer self but I am afraid I haven't been like that for a little bit now."

It feels like a complete blur-- last week was just one long day seemed and then the weekend was finally seperate days.  I am starting to get over last monday's events but a part of me misses the one I hurt.  Everyone tells me that hes a jerk and all this rude stuff about him but yet I still miss him and don't see it.  I guess thats what I have done with most guys I have liked.  My friends and other people will say he's a jerk.. he did this and that and I will be like oh no thats rude but still be like I like him and he's cool and then the guy will rip out my heart and stomp on it.. I should listen before that happens again and before this guy is added to the list of guys that that has happened with. Well I am off to school."

"event","So I take it a lot of people might be wondering why the sudden I am giving up drinking at least for the most part. I mean drinking maybe once a month isn't giving it up completely but anyways so I guess here's why.
THE REASONS:
1. I have realized I am becoming a bad influence on my niece and I don't want that.  I was talking to Katie and telling her how if I had drank to numb my pain for monday's events and then years down the road my niece would ask what to do in a similar situation and what I did in one telling her not to drink would be hypocritcal and telling her to drink would teach her that everytime she has pain she can drink and it will make the pain feel better. 
2. I realized that all I was trying to do was drink to have fun and I have realized that I can have fun sober when I will actually remember it all... I am not saying drinking to be social is bad I am just saying its become not for me at least for a little while... I guess eventually I will drink again but right now like I said in my last entry alcohol doesn't sound good or appealing."

"event","Wow so last night was amazing.. exactly what I needed.. a funny movie, an Izze, sleepover, and Ice cream!! I thank Katie for everything last night... we had fun laughing at Man of the Year! I came home and did hw today--- dullsville but I played with my niece so that was fun! I am going out to dinner with my mom so thats cooly.  This weekend has actually been really good so far!! YAY!!! Katie and I have had a texting war on how annoying boys are which is really cool hehe No drinking this weekend which is def. for the best... I have decided that if I drink again that I will probably only drink once a month or something... I don't know alcohol just doesn't seem very appealing anymore! I know... weird its just I am not quite sure why I feel like this.. I mean I think of drinking but the sound of it just sounds bad to me.  Maybe I will get over that but in the mean time I guess I will be my little sober self and hang out with family once again... which is fun! Need to go and fill at transfer applications soon! Need to Call T and Markelle!"

"event","Today was a really good day.... I woke up this morning and found a comment from Tony on my myspace. This made my day start off well since it meant he actually listened to me when I ranted the other day so that was a good thing for me.  Then I did homework which wasn't so fun but then I got to go to my uncle's house for my aunt's birthday. It was sooooo much fun we had pizza and just sat around and laughed... its nice to have family close... something I will miss if I go away next year.  Then Katie came and picked me up which was awesome because I hadn't seen her in awhile.  Then we headed over and got my bag from my house and went to the mall. We walked around at the mall and ran into Abbey at work, and we went in a bunch of clothing stores and we just talked and laughed so it was cool.  Katie also got me lip butter that is soooo good. Then we went to Starbucks and I got an IZZE--- Soooo good even though the top killed Katie's hand and then we decided we wanted ice cream so we went and got ice cream and Katie bought it for me which was really nice of her!!! Then we went into Borders and looked around and finally went to the movie.  We went to see Man of the Year with Robin Williams in it and it was sooooooo fucking funny not to mention a cute guy sat next to me lol  The movie took my mind off a lot of things that have been bugging me lately.  
Things I have decided: I am moving on from Monday's events and if I talk about them its only to feel a big release. I have also decided that it was a good idea that I decided not to drink to get over the problems I am having right now... drinking would have only numbed it.  I have also officially realized that I need to narrow down the choices of where I want to go next year and apply soon. 
Things I have to do tomorrow: Write the rest of my paper for humanities and study for biology and research for biology.  I also have to babysit my niece.  
Things I am looking forward to next week: Seeing Markelle, Emily, Nicolle, Abbey, and Tony
Things I must do soon: Go see a show at the Boulder Dinner Theatre with Katie, Build a Bear with Katie lol Hang out with Markelle! Go to a concert
I am watching this meth addict show on MTV which is really good I think its one of those true life things."

"event","So I usually get ideas for a script if I just sit and think for awhile and brainstorm or if I read, watch tv, or listen to music. Well its not like I have writers block because I can write about everything real but when it comes to making something creative up for script its like I can't do it anymore. It's so weird... Nicolle said yesterday that she felt something was wrong with her and she didn't know what and now I feel the same way.  This so isn't me at all.. I usually have a good idea and I am usually really creative especially when it comes to coming up with different meanings with what my humanities teacher says or at least something funny in that class or science but these last few days I haven't been able to do that. It's like I have changed and it feels like my world has changed but my family has stayed the same. I feel like a different person.. I feel less creative and I am not quite sure why. I mean this never happened before when I liked a guy and lost him... usually I am still my creative self.  What makes him so different? What makes him so special? Why did my creativity run wild when I was talking to him? If this was a week ago or even before monday I could have written something creative but now its gone. 

Everyone tells me that I will be ok and I guess in time I will be.  He changed me though... in those 2 or so weeks he changed me. He made me more of a dreamer and more creative it seems and now thats been crushed... that sounds so stupid I know but really he did that. He had such an impact on me and I don't think he will ever get that.  I miss him like crazy and I know I probably sound lame but I don't really care.  I hurt someone I cared about and someone that I would have loved to get to know. I am sorry if I am driving people crazy.

We did this relaxing exercise in psychology where we closed our eyes and relaxed our muscles and at first we were supposed to visualize a calm, peaceful lake and then we were supposed to count our breathing well notice it.  Well when we were told to visualize the lake we were also told to imagine ourselves on the bank and the sun was hitting us just right and there was a slight breeze and we could hear birds and feel sand and he popped up next to me.  Then we were supposed to go closer to the bank and well I would move and he would get further away but still walk a little towards me... it was really weird.  Visualizing stuff is weird but it was weird that I couldn't get him out of my relaxing exercise. I tried to but I couldn't.  I am sorry he is all I think about.  I shouldn't dwell and I really have tried not too but I just can't seem to put him behind me like I should because seriously what if he never forgives me or calls again or anything then what? I should be moving on but I feel so stuck... I feel like the world is moving around me and I am numb to it but at the same time I feel changed.. its weird and hard to explain."

"event","Ok well maybe its not exactly aha insight but I have come to my own solution with my own problem. After a lot of thinking I finally drew a conclusion.  I have had the most amazing friends telling me things and helping me figure out just what to do along the way.  All of their opinions and comments have led me to the conclusion that the guy is no better than me.  We both expected different things from each other and well we both lied in a way. Sure maybe I lied more than he did but we both let each other down.  I have also determined that I am not going to wait for him to cool off and forgive me and even possibly come around because if I do then I will be in this sad mopey state for longer than I really should be.  Life goes on and I need to go on with it. Maybe he will miss me and come around and maybe he won't... what happens happens... I just know this one thing.. is that everything happens for a reason and we learn from everything we do. I guess in time I will realize what the purpose of him was. Right now I can't really think of it... I miss him and of course I will.. I talked to him so much on the phone and the net but it will get easier as time passes and who knows maybe he will surprise me and come around but truthfully I am not holding my breath. I never told him he couldn't call me or talk to me so if he decides to then he decides to and if not he wasn't worth it.   There are many nice guys out there and even more important than the nice guys are the friends who come to your rescue when you are sad and in a tough spot... to those who came to my rescue, I thank you.  You guys are the ones who have been there through a lot and I am glad that you are my friends."

I knew what I did was wrong 
Why couldn't I have stopped lying
It feels like the same old song

The missing piece was filled with him
Now its empty all over again
I left my heart hanging on a wimb 
Now its been broken again 

The world stands still
The only thing that moves is time
no more joking about the phrase with kill
I feel like I am stuck in this rhyme

No more five hour calls
No more late hour fun
No more life with him at all
I wish it didn't have to be so but whats done is done


I hurt someone I really cared about and now I feel empty.  Time seems to have stopped but I know thats not true because with my life experiences I have learned time stops for nothing.  It doesn't matter how much pain you are in time keeps going, life keeps changing, you keep growing.  I wish i could turn back the clock and have told him the truth from the beginning. I cared for him so much and I still do."

Shirts in the closet, shoes in the hall
Mama's in the kitchen, baby and all
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
But you're missing

Coffee cups on the counter, jackets on the chair
Papers on the doorstep, you're not there
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
But you're missing

Pictures on the nightstand, TV's on in the den
Your house is waiting, your house is waiting
For you to walk in, for you to walk in
But you're missing, you're missing
You're missing when I shut out the lights
You're missing when I close my eyes
You're missing when I see the sun rise
You're missing

Children are asking if it's alright
Will you be in our arms tonight?

Morning is morning, the evening falls I have
Too much room in my bed, too many phone calls
How's everything, everything?
Everything, everything
You're missing, you're missing

God's drifting in heaven, devil's in the mailbox
I got dust on my shoes, nothing but teardrops

I love this song and this one

How I go- Yellowcard!

I could tell you the wildest of tales
My friend the giant and traveling sales
Tell you all the times that I failed
The years all behind me
The stories excelled.
And I'm drying out
Crying out
This isn't how I go

I could tell you of a man not so tall
Who said life's a circus and so we are small
Tell you of a girl that I saw
I froze in the moment and she changed it all

And I'm drying out
Crying out
This isn't how I go
Hurry now
Lay me down
And let these waters flow
Flow...

Son I am not everything you thought that I would be
But every story I have told is part of me

And you keep the air in my lungs
Floating along as a melody comes
And my heart beats like timpani drums
Keeping the time while a symphony strums
And I'm drying out
Crying out
This isn't how I go
Hurry now
Lay me down
And let these waters flow...
Flow....
Let it flow
Let it flow

Son I am not everything you thought that I would be
But every story I have told is part of me
Son I leave you now but you have so much more to do
And every story I have told is part of you"

"event","Life: I am working on another screenplay... it's like I start writing something and I get bored and I leave it and write something else... but I like this screenplay sooo far! I really should learn how to stay on one and end them... I just never can seem to end one of them.  I am going to Fall Out Boy! I am excited and I have knee surgery next friday!  I move tuesday... so not ready to move yet! I don't want to leave this house I mean it has a couple things wrong with it but what house doesn't? lol anyways its almost empty except for the mess of boxes!

School:  This semester started off bad but I like it now and I actually like some of the people in my classes!

Classes: History- it's so boring but the guy I sit next to is nice. I don't think anyone stays awake during this class though.  The teacher lives in his own little passionate love for History world thingy that he wants to like pass onto us when he hardly makes any sense at all.  He writes a word on the bored and jumps to a completey unrelated topic to what's written.  This is my least favorite class!

Business-  This is an actually pretty interesting class and I learn a lot.  The only thing about this class that annoys me is the fact that the girl next to me lets her cell phone ring like all the time during class and she will check her voice mail during class and its really loud lol! My teacher for this class is pretty cool... he like knows so much and he basically answers his own questions!

Psychology-  This class is awesome!! There is a lot of information to take in but its so interesting and I love it! The teacher is really nice... she actually keeps you interested which is a definite plus! The people in my class are pretty nice too!

Creative Writing- The Best Class!! My favorite class semester is this one!! The teacher is awesome and so funny!! He also gives us really cooly assignments! We had to write this poem where we went out in like 5 minutes and wrote down ten lines or quotes or words we saw from signs, bumper stickers and posters and stuff and then we had to come back and write a poem that rhymed... we did this in groups and we had to include each group member in the poem!! It was really fun! The people are also really cool... like Sarah who I have talked to more than like any other person in any of my classes! I wrote a poem in class the other day about moving and had to share it with my ""writing buddies""... I hate sharing so I was so nervous but they were really cooly! 

Anyways besides school, moving, and hanging with friends I have really not been up to anything else"

"event","I will remember the way you played guitar 
you broke my heart and left a scar
I got over you the best I could 
I never thought that I would
Life doesn't seem to change the way
you cut me deep and now I keep guys far away
good things happen and time goes by
you always made me cry
I tell myself it will happen again
maybe thats why I am the way I have been
I don't get close to guys
I think they only bring secrets and lies
Now there is one that seems not that way 
maybe I should ask him to stay
I don't want him to turn out like you
because then I will be sad and blue
I thought I loved you more than I did
you were just that one bright kid
life goes on day by day
through all the months even may
its over and what I felt is done
though this scar is far from gone
no one likes to be hurt
guys only bring up dirt
maybe not so true anymore
I guess I will never know if I go through life as a bore
I should let him stay
its silly to push him away

I got my first kiss from the guy I don't need to push away but as usual I find myself not wanting to get hurt... this guy is worth it though.  I will take a risk and hopefully I won't regret it"

Goodbye

I gave you that one final hug
You walked away before we spoke
The redness of your gown mixed
The sea of redness opened and closed
I couldn't see you anymore
You are one of them now
I haven't seen you since that day
All the tears I cried have been washed away
I will remember the way you played guitar
You broke my heart and you left a scar
Time heals slowly and everyday is brighter
You made me stronger in the long run
For that I thank you but cry
I thought losing you would make me die
So it's now over and I won't see you anymore
no time for coffee,life won't be a bore
This train is going fast
We must say goodbye and make it last
Goodbye the one boy that started it all 
Goodbye to all the times I called 
Goodbye the greatness of red
You were one of them instead"

"event","Ok So this entry is going to be me just rambling on and on about josh and how I came to realize that I need to stop but this i promise is hopefully the last rant!

SO here it goes: I liked him so much and I knew that him saying anything but yes I will date you would hurt but I never knew that he could hurt me worse than that.  I mean reading the myspace messages just made me feel like maybe I never really knew him like I thought I did and that really hurts... I told him things that I would have told a friend and now to feel like maybe he never considered us friends is just crappy because of the things I told him.... I should have listened to Aj but I know why I didn't... it's because I thought I knew Josh and I was so sure that I did that I ran out and got myself hurt but thats how we learn is from our mistakes


SO Josh and I not being friends anymore isn't the only thing that has changed... my dad's getting remarried... yep thats right the man that for all the years emotionally abused my mom is remarrying... this lady is really nice and he actually is a whole different person with her... hes a human being and not some monster or some preaching scary person hes actually a person.  Shes really nice and my mom doesn't like the fact that I like her but I were in my mom's shoes I wouldn't either... I can't imagine how it would feel knowing that your ex husband is happy with another person and you're not dating at all... and the fact that oen of your daughters has just moved to florida with your grand-daughter and your other daughter has graduated high school.  My mom is such a strong person... I love her soo much and no one will ever replace her.... I really think she feels that by me liking my soon to be stepmother that I am replacing her but truthfully no one could ever replace my mom because shes always there for me. They are getting married on February 18th... thats soooooo far away!! 

it's so weird how after I type one entry I find more to write!!



Here's a song to close out this entry though:

What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
""Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?""
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
""Welcome back to the age of jive.
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.""
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
""Can't you tell that it's out of style?""
Should I get a set of while wall tires?
""Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.""
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene.
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
""You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance.
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers,
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.""
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
""Don't you know that they're out of touch?""
Should I try to be a straight `A' student?
""If you are then you think too much.
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.""
It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me



I Just randomly picked this song if anyone was wondering.... ok so I decided to listen to it lol... but that was randomly!!!"

My friend, Mikhela, came into town and I hung out with her a couple times.  I am sad shes leaving because shes really cool!! My friend, Diana is also in town and shes here til next thursday... I get to see her monday which will be fun because I haven't seen her for like 3 or 4 months... I have missed her sooo much.  What else has happened? Josh and I aren't friends anymore... I guess that was coming eventually and I am kind of glad it came at the beginning of the summer instead of towards the end that way I will have the rest of the summer to get over it.


TO Tina: I miss you soooooo much girly and you won't believe when you get home just how many times I have stalked your phone!  Wow that kind of rhymed and wow I am random... but truthfully the only reason I have stalked your phone is because I have missed you so much!!! 

Summer is funnn except for it seems like school has been out forever... I miss people lol!!

I remember being so scared yet excited to finally go to school when kindergarten started.. but starting school wasn't enough I wanted to be with my sister in high school... I was a crazy little kid from the start!!!  I miss those days sometimes... the days when you have no worries and your big sister is home (sometimes, unless she is with her friends) and you just get to be her best friend.  I met Gen in kindergarten!!! After Kindergarten I was so excited to be in first grade!!! First grade was where I met Eung-mi and Elizabeth!! Then came second where I really didn't have my friends in my class and I was lonely... third I had Eung-mi in my class... 4th I met Tina... and 5th grade Tina and I became best friends!!! I hardly remember 5th grade graduation!!! Then came middle school, that went past so fast.... and then 9th grade!! I was so glad my 9th grade to be going to school with some of my friends and then 10th was horrible and then 11th I switched schools and then this year wow I am at Fairview!! it's weird being at Fairview... its also weird having to say goodbye to another school after just 2 years!!!! The last day of real school wow.... what good memories have come with the days of elementary school and innocence and the hetic and hormone filled middle school... and yet great memories have come in high school!!!! SO many things I won't forget and it makes me sad to say goodbye but I am also excited to see what is ahead!!!!"

Then I thought about Cailin, Tina, Eung-Mi, Brandy, Jen, Aj, Liz, Jenny, Katie, Krysta, Julia, Britney, and Megan.  You all have been a good support system too and thank you all for being so amazing!!!

"event","There is a song I want you guys to all here because its really awesome and one of the best!
Here are the lyrics:

Borrowed Angels- Kristin Chenoweth


They shine a little brighter, they feel a little more 
They touch your life in ways no one has ever done before 
They love a little stronger, they live to give their best 
They make our lives so blest, so why do they go so soon? 
The ones with souls so beautiful 
I heard someone say-- 

There must be Borrowed Angels, here in this life 
They come along, into this world, and make this world bright 
But they can't stay forever 
Cause they're heaven sent 
And sometimes, heaven needs them back again 

They reach a little deeper, they see what's in your soul 
And even when they leave you know, you'll never let them go 
The world's a little richer, just cause they came along 
Their love goes on and on, so why do they go so soon? 
The ones with souls so beautiful. I heard someone say-- 

There must be Borrowed Angels, here in this life 
They come along, into this world, and make this world bright 
They can't stay forever, cause they're heaven sent 
And sometimes, heaven needs them back again 

How else can you explain why they're here and not here to stay? 
I believe there must be, must be 

Borrowed Angels, here in this life 
They come along, into this world, and make this world bright 
But they can't stay forever, cause there heaven sent 
And sometimes heaven needs them back again. 
And sometimes heaven needs them back again. 


This song is dedicated to people who are still alive but have made my life completely bearable and have helped me through each day!!! Those people should know who they are!!!!"

You're still taken in by love poems and sunsets
You just don't fall for every dreamy pick up line!</font></td></tr></table>

Sit down and buckle up cuz it might be a bumpy ride hehe..oh and keep all hands and legs inside the memory train at all times. LOL.. so sit back and enjoy the ride. LOL I woke up this morning and I was like super tired lol and I like got to school and I like kind of forgot my combo and I finally remembered it and I went to photography and then I went to Early Childhood Education and we got to play with the kids and one of the kids decided instead of painting the paper blue with the paintbrush that she would paint her hand blue. ANd then she wiped it on her face and so she blue on her face too lol it was so cutee and funny.  NExt I went to gym and on the way I ran into ALi!!! I was happy because I missed her alot--- she's a good friend of mine and then after gym I saw Jamie-- who is another good friend of mine and after that I went to lunch and got to see Jen, Elizabeth, and Krysta. Jen had to study and yeah so she was like reciting stuff out loud to us and Tina called lol. It was cooly and after that I went to my locker grabbed my math book, saw josh and he waved and smiled and I said hi and then after the sub who couldn't explain anything at all about math confused me it was time for 7th period and during that period, after doing my hw, I saw Josh and we talked and it was cooly and I also saw AJ during the day but it sucked cuz we only had the chance to say hi to each other...I'll see him tomorrow though.  Anyway finals are soon and 8th period nothing really happened so yeah... my day was pretty boring so I hope you aren't all asleep and if you are you can all wake up now and exit the memory train... LOL I know I am weird"

I am betting you're sitting their reading this and being like what did she do now--- that's only if you know me and are friends with me that you would be sitting their wondering this but if you totally don't know me well than your probably thinking what I am about to tell you is just a little scary. Ok so here's my story: I have been really bored this weekend so I started looking at last year's year book more and more and I have discovered that this guy I like looks like this guy who was a sophmore last year and see I don't know the guy I like's last name but his first name is A.J-- well thats what he goes by and the guy in the yearbook's name was Andrew and I went to the index looked up the guy in the pictures name and turned to the other two pages listed that had pictures of this guy on them. Well the guy goes by Aj according to the caption(not the exact one but it was something like) A.J in the band Something to Prove-- which is a band that has kids from my highschool in it--- well anyway in that picture Aj was playing the drums and the guy Aj I like plays the drums so I thought it has to be him so I look up his name in the directory and I find his email address, house and phone number and so I email him days after I find it and then I got bored today and I asked my mom if we could go find his house and we did... ok I am a stalker officially and he has a really big house lol and yeah if he ever stumbled across this he would think I was a total freak and I probably am.   The only problem is that I like his best friend too.... yeah you guessed it hes best friend's with Josh... cute sweet innocent Josh who makes my heartbeat fast everytime I see him and who gives me butterflies in my stomach and who I get so speechless or dumb sounding talking to.  LOL yeah u can tell I have issues making up my mind of who I like more. LOL"

                 She will be loved


                
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[in the background]
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

Yeah
[softly]
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain

Try so hard to say goodbye

Ok well thats the only song I listen to right now lol!!!! well basically the only one!!!"

"event","YAY!!! Extravagnza tomorrow night-- its one of fairviews music things it has our marching knights, 4 jazz bands, our like 5 choirs, the orchestra, and some people from our musical, Guys and Dolls. The guy I like is in extravangza and it's no big secret he knows I like him, the thing he doesn't know is that I am gonna ask him out for this weekend.  He makes me nervous and then when I start talking to him it's like I've known him for years... I am starting to get completely comfortable around him.. which is the true great thing. I know I talk about him a lot... its because hes just so different from everyother guy I've ever liked... I mean don't get me wrong the other guys I've like were nice too but they lack the creativity and the genuine kindness that this guy has.  Take Billy for example.. he is a friend of mine now but I mean he used to annoy me because I told him I loved him and instead of saying I don't feel the same way he started talking about anime or a video game.. I am not interested in video games.. I guess him and me were too different.  Then there was Tanner... him and I could have worked but I think he used to try to be something he wasn't and I love a guy who knows who he is and is not afraid to let it be known and who doesn't care what others think of him. And don't let me forgot Kyle... while Kyle and I could have probably worked.. I think we would have been better friends because we talked like we were friends and anything else would have screwed that up.  Oh and the other Kyle.. he lives in Texas and him and I well we are great friends and thats all I think of him as.  Josh... dear sweet Josh who right now is all I am looking for in a guy... well I like him and its not just because he is cute and creative its also because he doesn't care what people think about him.. he is kind and has an amazing personality.. he is the greatest guy I've ever met.
               Well besides the guy I like I have a couple very special friends in my life and my niece. 
Alecs- well while she is annoying she is also the cutest little kid and shes so smart for her age.
Eung-Mi- I've known her for an extremely long time lol and she is so sweet, kind, talented, funny, and always there.
Gen- she is awesome.. she is sweet, funny,and she is great at a lot of things. I've known her so long and she has the most incriminating video of me. LOL 
Jamie- Well i haven't known her too long but I know she is one of the nicest people I've ever met.. she is also kind, smart, and she always encourages me to go for my dreams.
Jen- She is amazing... she is sweet, funny, creative, thoughtful, smart and she is always making people feel welcome..shes great at doing that..she is very outgoing
Jenny- Wow she is funny, hyper, sweet, and did I mention funny!!
Jules- Where do I start.. she is cool, talented, follows her dreams, smart, kind, never gives up and is always there for me and I could say a whole lot more
Kate- Where do I begin... she is awesome.. great to talk to, adventurous, a great negotiater, smart, talented, funny,nice and always there for me too and I really could go on for a while 
Kyle- Texas Kyle lol.. I know I have never met u but when I talk to u it's like you always tell me it will get better and you always encourage me to do things I want to do and your nice, talented, smart, and I am really glad I was introduced to you even though it was online through Tina lol!! You're awesome!!
Lauren- I can't forgot her... shes outgoing, always including people, kind, adventurous, stubborn.. no just kidding and she won.. she knows what that means LOL
Tina- Where do I begin...she always been there through thick and thin and through so many years.. she is kind, funny, smart, talented and much more... I could go on forever..
Well this is my life and most of the key people in it... there are some others too and to everybody on this list or anyone who is my friend.. I am glad I met you because you have all changed my life for the best!!!!"

I don't want to take my math final or French 3 final.

Though the people in it were really weird!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            I am now gonna tell u about the first time I saw the movie ""It"".  Jules, Kate, and I were doing a sleepover at my house , and we decided to rent ""IT"", we were watching the movie that night and we were sooooooo scared, that night my brother scared us by moving a chair and scrathing on the walls near my bed, the wall in the living room.  It was scary , we screamed most of the night, and the next day my brother kept hiding and popping up and we kept screaming. The night we saw ""IT"" was the night I started being scared of clown and I am still scared of clowns. ""IT"" is a good movie!!!!! I recommend seeing that movie with your friends!!!!!!

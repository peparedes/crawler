"event","The sound of the tap running hot. The sight of the steam rising from the sink. He splashed the water on his face, then brought the razors edge to his neck.<lj-cut> He paused, and then dragged it across his skin, removing the hair one line at a time. The mirror has fogged so he couldn't make out his reflection. He quickly used the towel to wipe the condensation from it, revealing his visage.
<i>Why are you you?</i>
He continued to shave, stopping after each stroke to clean the razor with the running tap.
<i>Why is it you see what you see? That you know what you know? Why are you different?</i>
Months of growth fell into the sink with each stroke; what could be considered at cathartic experience if he cared an iota about his facial hair.
<i>Why can't you be like everyone else? Why can't you be reassured like everyone else? Why can't you be advised like everyone else?</i>
He hadn't seen the skin of his face for what felt like his entire life, and then upon seeing his face it was like it had never been covered.
<i>I hate being you</i>
He finished and then splashed more water on his face, clearing the last remnants off. He was a different man.
<i>Why can't you change? Why can't you be someone I can like? That others can love?</i>
The aftershave no longer stung. That or he had become used to the pain.
<i>You never get used to the pain, you never let go. Your doomed to live with it the rest of your life because you want to protect others from it.
Self righteous fuck</i>
He wanted to smash the mirror at that moment. If he had been anyone else he probably would have. He was not. He was who he was, and because of that it was all kept inside. Not even the release found in the bottle exploding was allowed to him. Where he kept himself, the room was limitless.</lj-cut>"

"event","My mind does not seem to be either here nor there tonight. Attempts at intelligent dialogue and constructive thought seem to be all but impossible. 
<lj-cut>Sadly, Jung's <i>Answer to Job</i> seems out of my mental reach this evening. Indeed, anything practical is all but impossible. Oddly, memories seem to be arising from out of my unconscious. Memories of people I've known, of mild acts of affection, of little flirtations, of girls I've liked and people I've admired. A memory of singing the repetitious lines of a song with someone I later found was depressed; of another whose accent made serious ""I will miss you"" even though I'd only be going to the toilet; of a teacher who is a better student then any I would know, and who has inspired me to continue learning myself; a lonely person, shy and reserved, boyfriend several thousand miles away, opening up and showing a desire for physical affection that one would never guess was there.
Doubts are creeping in, about my abilities, my potential, my direction. I've been told I'm smart, that I'm good at what I do, that if I were to apply myself I could be great. But what if I cannot apply myself? What if the desire and motivation I possess is not and will never be in the directions which my potential seems to be for? What if I can never find anything to motivate me beyond that which I can do passively? Will I fall into the trap of a career that does not interest me purely to pay the bills?
Someones talking to me on msn, I bare no particular love or hate for this person, in fact their someone i have no real desire to interact with either way, but I'm talking to them none the less.
Perhaps what I'm doing now is my real skill. An opening up of the gates internal allowing for an externalisation of what is there. Writing. It is effortless, seeming almost to be like breathing. How can anyone be bad at it? Something i've often wondered. Sometimes i find it painful to read others works, sometimes for lack of originality, sometimes for inability to verbalise, sometimes for just plain crapness. And then, having raised myself above them in a hidden show of arrogance, I turn to my own work in disgust. How can anyone read it and honestly find anything good there? My last story for WRF which I had planned on burning seemed to do quite abit better then the previous work which I not only enjoyed writing but also reading afterwards.
Perhaps I am a hack, one who can never really master a skill but can use it sporatically. My writings never been structured or disciplined, my attempts to do so seem to normally be failures (even though you all seemed to enjoy my story, it wasn't that great). In philosophy too, my inability to focus on and sometimes to even take in what I'm learning has been stopping me from really getting into it in recent times. If I make a concerted effort to try harder, will it come back? I have uneasy feelings thats not the case, but it seems the only thing I can really do.
More memories, far more recent, sleeping on a couch with someone else, opening my eyes and seeing them huddled up under the blanket on their side, almost seeming to try and avoid contact. But why then are they there? Their own bed is only seconds walk away, and despite their claims that they don't want to leave the room because of the heater, I know their bed is far warmer then this couch. Perhaps there is something to my questions about her behaviour, perhaps I should listen to my feelings, but then again my instincts tell me otherwise.
There is some desire I think to answer these questions, to follow up these memories, to find some meaning, but as with all else, no energy to pursue.</lj-cut> Think I'm gonna do something else."

Three weeks later, bank account looking fairly pathetic, I wander back in and ask the accounts officer whats happened. ""Oh yes, before I can do that, there was something I needed to ask you involving the fact that you get free internet and that I forgot that so when I saw that you had negative internet credit I thought you owed us money but you don't so thats cleared and now you can expect the bond in next two weeks"" ""You know, I'm fairly desperate for that money, I was expecting it a few weeks ago and need it for bills etc."" ""Oh, in that case I'll get it all organised today so that it can be processed immediately, and the money will be in your account next Monday""

"event","<P>It occurs to me, sitting here with my story, getting more melancholy as the evening goes by, that any good piece of prose, much like poetry, should be as difficult on the writer as it is for the reader. </P>
<P><lj-cut> </P>
<P>By this I do not mean that the writer should be stretching is ability by&nbsp;attempting to write everything in the most grandiose and stylistic manner possible, I believe strongly that writing should be a relaxed natural flow untouched by pretense. Neither do I mean that the reader should have to sit with the unabridged Oxford English Dictionary besides his seat, ready to look up meanings at the turn of a glance, nor should they have to spend several hours contemplating the meaning of a single word. The piece should be transparent in this sense, it should offer itself with ease to the reader to be read. Sitting here, writing, I find that with every line that gets entered in Word, I'm asking myself where inside is it coming from. Having completed a paragraph, I ask myself, why did I write that? As the story takes shape, I read and try and understand the shape it takes, I do not mold it as if from clay. True, in order to write I have to have an idea of where I want to go with the piece, have some idea of whats going to happen, but the process of getting there is not simply throwing words at the page until something coherent comes out. Its a process of liberating whats held in the unconscious. So while I may be relaxed, I am in fact only relaxed because through relaxation the doors into the unconscious are open. Reaching through those doors on the otherhand, is both difficult and painful. For one, the door isn't very large, you can barely fit your arm through, and the tightness of it impedes your ability to reach around for material. And it becomes painful because what you drag out isn't often sweetness and joy. More often then not it's truths about yourself you may have hidden from yourself intentionally, or unconsciously. And when forced with these truths, then what? Do you put it straight onto paper or do you try and make it cryptic enough that only you can read and understand it? And when you've opened yourself to the implications of that your writing, do you take it on board, do you process it, do you change? Do you, in a manner of speaking, let the story write you? Sitting here, having let myself get into a state where writing is possible, I find myself overwhelmed with truth about myself. Of course, I'm not shocked by it, this truth has always been there and I've chosen to deny it to myself. But in allowing myself to be relaxed I am forced to allow myself to also see what i have chosen to hide from myself. I suppose I could just write and ignore what I see, but what then is the point of writing? It's certainly not easy, rarely enjoyable, and I'm not going to make any monetarprofit whatsoever from it. So the only way I can get anything out of what i write is by struggling with it. By forcing myself to write only what is difficult, and then myself coming to terms with what I've written. Much like the reader must to an extent let themselves be read by what they read, the writer must let themselves be written by what they write.</P>

<P>I think, ultimately, vodka was invented to help with this dilemma</P>"

"event","So you recline there, no-one else in the room, except there is someone else there, but of course they refuse to acknowledge you. What then? Are you alone? Perhaps you are, but is it because of you or of them? Let's say its because of you, where does that leave you? No where really. Your room offers no consolation, neither does your home. Those who could possibly, well, to them you're but an another adornment for the bleak landscape you now inhabit. What then? Go back to your room, with no hope, or remain, with some. So you remain. Do you gain anything? No, if anything you lose something because you realise what this does to you. So why do you remain.? Have you honestly got that little to do with your time? You yourself know you don't, but the alternative, albeit something you can adjust to, you know is only further down the path your dreading to tread along. Yet this path is a river, remain stationary will only mean you drift slower then if you were to swim with the current. And a strong current it is, otherwise you'd be making some leeway. So you drift, aware yet not denying. Someone else is there with you, so you stay. Leave them, you say to yourself. But you can't. They're the only ones there, and while your invisible to them at least you can see them. So you sit there, hopeless, drifting, going no where useful."

"event","Is that how you'll stop me? from just switching off my computer? do you fear what I will achieve in what I write? I sit here, searching for inspiration, uncovering the reasons why I write andn what I hope to achieve, and you seek to stop that? DON'T!!! It builds and builds and when I let the beast out you seek to return it to its shackles and lock it away. for what purpose? what will I achieve through my mediocre attempts at creating something meaningful that you so desperatly desire to stop from arising? this is my release, my true release. When I talk, it cannot come out. I can't play guitar for shit and I can't sing for crap, so musics not gonna do much. My visual mind is about as mature as a three year old, so any drawings I create are retarded at best. Writing, the one thing I can seem to do with freely, that while mediocre at best is still the only thing I can seem to do, and when I do it you stop me? I'm not going to find a good looking picture of Janis Joplin, the one I glimpsed previously must have been a mirage. And when I sit down to write, and I seem to be getting close to something, what do you do? Rip it from my hands!!! Or perhaps it is not that I am not supposed to write, perhaps you are not supposed to read. Why do you read? What voyeristic pleasure do you derive from delving the depths of something elses pathetic psyche? Does it distract you from your own life for a little? What is the point of reading, writing, composing, anything, if all your going to do is passively take it in? Why do I do it you ask? Because I am weak, I have not the strength to go through with what I desire for myself. Perhaps that is why I write, because in writing I do not actually have to DO anything, I can just write it, let someone else do it for me, abstract myself from it, and together we can sit and sagely discuss what is being said without actually acknowledging where it has come from and what it truely reflects on ourselves. Pft, you've even written to let people know your feelings for them before, and laughed as they didn't realise, or lie when they do. Oh the power of the writer. Look at you, sitting there, reading my rant. Can you but do anything else? You can of course leave this page right now and never return, but then you miss out on what I say next, and so I can always say you missed the most important part. Or you could read on and be disappointed by the lack of anything, and then I can laugh at you for having done so. And look at me, I too am a slave to this drivel. How can I stop? no ending will present itself, only another opening. There can be no answers, only more questions. What a fucking pretentious thing to say. Possibly the only insightful thing you've said all night, albeit so fucking obvious to anyone whose thought about it. And you writing, how it reflects this. You couldn't stop even if you wanted to. How could you? Only an answer will cause an end, why do you think kafka could never complete his novels. Sure, he came up with endings for them, but he never finished writing them. The search for whatever it is you might want to call it, be it meaning, or truth, or even ""The Law"", you'll never go anywhere with it. You'll remain at the very first gate, gazing inwards and realising how pathetic you are to not even beable to move past that. And in the end the gate keeper never stopped you, he just never said you could enter and so you sat there and did nothing. You waited for permission to what was yours to begin with. And then, as you lay there dieing, the truth is revealed and because you could never grasp it in life, the doors is closed on you forever. So how do I grasp it? Better yet, how do I move past that gate? Even better still, how do I distill what I see there, put it on paper, and call it an assignment? No answers, only more questions. Fuck it."

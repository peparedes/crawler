"event","so this is probably like the 523490 lj i have made.  I always make them and then stop posting.  Then when i decide to post again it's really outdated and gayyy so i delete it and make a new one.  yea.  So i guess since i'm in a typing mood i will talk about my life right now.  I'm lame like that. okayyy

A)i don't trust anyone anymore.  In the past month i've been lied to by people i would never ever in my wildest dreams expect to be dishonest with me.  I've been stabbed in the back by people who i told things to and counted as friends.  But those people can kiss my ass.  I don't need people like that in my life anymore.  People who say they don't love me as much as they used to and don't ever call me again until it's convient for them.  Well, don't be surprised if i stop answering and you have to speak to my voicemail as much as i have spoken to yours.

B) strangely enough what i have just typed in A doesnt effect me anymore.  I have become numb to my heartbreak.  I laugh now, I smile now & i'm not faking it.  I think this recent laughter is due to a couple of things.  #1 being myself.  I've decided that i'm stronger then that, and that i can find someone who will love me ALWAYS {the same way he did before} even when ""all you've been doing is fighting with me""  EVEN THOUGH you know i have a justified reason to be upset.  
#2 i have amazing friends.  I have friends who came and stayed like a week at my house just to make sure i was okay, just so i could get a decent nights sleep.  Friends who cried with me instead of just telling me things would be okay.  Friends who joke and force me to smile even when i don't want to. Friends who sat with me on street curbs and let me cry on their shoulder. Thank you.

C)i'm not depressed.  I was i guess but i'm over it now.  Everyone has problems and i'm getting over mine.  I'm becomeing who i used to be.  A happy free spirit with an honest love for life.  Everytime i see him i will get sad, and my heart might beat a little less but that's okay.  That's life.  People grow up and that often means growing apart.  But it some cases it means growing closer and i've made new friends and i've become even closer to the ones i already have. So when you think things can't get much worse they start to get better.

D) i have my warped tour tickets; all is right with the world.

E) i want love and affection.  So come kiss me boys =)
hahaha oh god i love myself.

this is a really homo entry & i love every second of it.  don't comment if you have nothing nice to say because i'll just delete it and you will have wasted your sweet time trying to insult me and doing a horrible job.  I'm not letting you get me down anymore.  kthxbye"

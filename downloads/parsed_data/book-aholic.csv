"event","I have started the sequel to <b>Fade to Black</b>, called <b>Blood Moon</b>. It takes place about six months after <b>F2B</b> ends. It's starting off rough, since Sarah really doesn't feel like chatting right now, but it'll smooth out by page ten or so. If not, well then I guess I'll have to go back through and see what's wrong.

"event","I've finsihed Fade to Black!!! It's 113 pages, about 28,500 words long. I am so happy. It's the first one I have finished since The Quest to Twin Towers back in 2000. *sigh* Now I get to go through edit it. I've gotten to page 40 in the editing, then Brian, my mom, and then my brother have to read through it. It all makes sense to me, so I'm probably missing something. Wish me luck!


Now all I have to do it write that short story for the SC Fiction Poject that's due on the 16th."

"event","I just started my rewrite for The Quest to Twin Towers. It's funny. Originally it was third person and now it is first. I think Starlette has more to say now. After all, she has been locked away for 7 years. It's about time to break her out again.

Side note: The Quest to Twin Towers was started in 1998 and finished in 1999/2000. For those of you who looked at my profile and did the math I started it when I was a freshmen at SHS and finished when I was a sophomore.

Ok, maybe it hasn't been 7 years. But it's damn close enough.

I have only one paragraph written. I hope to have atleast another tonight. It's hard converting third person into first (because she doesn't know exactly what happened with Rojo and May) and adding new things. I'm thinking that it'll start out slow and pick up once I find a pace.

"event","I need to figure out a way to rewrite The Quest to Twin Towers. I have all of these great ideas to make it work, but I have no idea where to start. I also need to figure out what to do about The Seasons. So far I have gotten 9 regection letters for it. Not too good. That is 9/15 letters I have gotten back so far."

"event","And no, it is not for school. I am working on a story right now. It's coming off to a decent start, even though I am only about 12 pages into it. But it involves hefty research, so I keep pausing along the way to look stuff up. It bugs me if I can't describe what Ancient Egypt looks like. It bugs me so much that I am not able to go on with the story. I can't make a little note like <b>(Description of Cairo here)</b> and move on. I did that with some of the character descriptions. I know what my characters look like. I do not know what Ancient Cairo looked like.

And BTW; I would like to thank Brian for being a sweetie and letting me borrow his National Geographics about Egypt and Aztecs. He has them from 1958 up to present along with the maps. And that includes a map of an Anicent Epyptian city. Muchas Gracias, Brian.

If any who reads this journal are interested in reading the first part of the story (the first 4 pages I think), it is posted in the Files part of my Yahoo! Group called The Written Circle. You kinda hafta join to read it though. *shruggs*

<lj-cut text=""General plot for story"">
My story, as of right now because I can change it if I want, is about a Faerie named Amythist Dyier. Amy is a fey who is a member of the Unseelie Court. Queen Morgan orders Amy, her friend Jonas Bohain, and sihde Dalamar Shola, to go find the Crystal Gifts and return them to her. To make a long story short, the Crystal Gifts are 7 powers (example: necromancer) that can be harnessed by immortals. Queen Morgan wants them so that she can combine the Seelie and Unseelie Courts and be the ruler ove both. What Amy doens't know is that Morgan wants the powers so that she can be a dictator. Please imagine Hitler, but immortal and with supernatural powers. That image is Morgan. Amy finds out about the Queens true plans and decides to keep the powers for herself and do whatever she can to prevent the Queen from getting them. Their journey to find the Crystal Gifts bring them to Egypt, Aztec S.America, Midieval England, Versailles, Nazi Germany, and (of course, because it makes it easy for me) modern day SC.</lj-cut>

Well, I gotta go. I have to go to work soon. I also have to study for my English Lit final. It'll be assigned to us Thrus. (4/22) and due Tues. (4/27) Not that bad, eh? I'll have a weekend to work on it. I guess it's a pity them that I have to work 9-5 on Saturday, huh? 5 papers in 4 days. This weekend will not be fun. (oh, and might I mention the Spanish test Friday (4/23) and Spanish Final on Wed. (4/28). And my Math final on Friday (4/30).)

Laters!"

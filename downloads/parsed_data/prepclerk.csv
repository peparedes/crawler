"event","I'm just sitting here staring off into space and I can't help but wonder about everything. With the news I got yesterday it puts my own mortality into question. Do only the good die young? Should I look for the greater good in his death? I didn't know him all that well but it still hurts. I haven't cried since I don't know if I should where I didn't know him all that well. How is his brother going to hold up? Him and his brother were like the best of friends.. they looked out for each other.. but now its just up in the air. 

Just a friendly reminder to everyone... please please please make sure you tell the ones you care about that you do care because you never know... you might not have them tomorrow.

Yesterday is in the past... tomorrow is a mystery and today is a gift thats why they call it the present."

"event","All donations go to The Jimmy Fund...

here's the info:

What: Chix With Stix vs. Boston Bruins Alumni

When: Friday, April 3, 2009 7:00pm - 9:00pm

Where: New England Sports Center
121 Donald Lynch Blvd.
Marlborough, MA

Cost: Adults $10
Children $5



About Chix with Stix

When Deb Rowe lost her fourteen-year-old cousin to leukemia, the idea for Chix with Stix began. Why not organize a team of female hockey players to take on the Bruins alums as a benefit for the Jimmy Fund? So that's just what she did, and it was a tremendous success.


Tragically, Deb's beloved grandmother died of breast cancer a short while later.


Now, Deb and the Chix with Stix team, skate, not only in memory of her cousin and Nana, but for everyone out there, who is fighting, surviving, aiding someone with cancer or mourning a loss from it.


The Chix with Stix games are now played to help raise money for breast cancer research.


Tickets are only $10 (adults) and $5 (children) and can be purchased through team members or at the door, on the evening of the event.


The bulk of the money raised is done with ads placed in the Boston Bruin's program book, which is available the evening of the event. If you would like to place an ad or simply make a donation, please contact Deb Rowe at: ChixwithStix2009@aol.com.


Please help the Chix with Stix in the fight against Cancer."

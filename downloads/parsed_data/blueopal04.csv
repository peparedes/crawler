Dead center.
Front row.
3ft from stage.
It was amazing. I have honestly been waiting for 8yrs for those seats. I loved it. So glad I went last night. It was definitely worth it.
All in all, it was a good weekend - but that actually kind of hinges upon whether or not I passed my accounting midterm that was this afternoon. A little worried about that one actually. 
Bah."

"event","I saw RENT last night - it was awesome. I have to say I love that muscial. It is my favorite one, hands down, and I don't care that there are so many wonderful muscials out there, none have more of an emotional impact on me than that one. RENT is the musical that I listened to all through high school, it's the one our speech team used to sing on our way to tournements, and it's the one that will quite possibly always be my favorite.
The appreciation of the audience for it was amazing - everyone was laughing at the funny parts, and cheering for the soloist - everyone just seemed to be totally wrapped up in the show. It must be an amazing high to be on stage and have such a large audience respond like that. I'm seriously tempted to go again tonight if I can get the $20 rush tickets. 

Anyway...after that I went to the bar w/ some friends because our friend's band was playing (more specifically, my friend's boyfriend's band). It was...good times...dum de dum de dum.
It was actually another college first - making out w/ random guy in bar. He was so random, I didn't even introduce myself till about 20 minutes later o_O  - btw, turns out he was also a frat boy.
And as leener asked - how do you not know his name???
Well it's cause we were dancing when we met, and still dancing when he started kissing me =P He got my number, hasn't called, not even sure I really want him to - that might ruin the whole random making out in a bar mystique. It was a good night. 

I enjoyed it. RENT and random make out. I think I needed a night like that."

"event","So I saw my friend's away message today - apparently there are only 99 days left until graduation. That's actually a little creepy.
I stole a girl's laundry today.
It was a total accident, I swear.

Basically what happened was that I was running late, very late. Class at 1, it was 12;55 and I still had to get my laundry and turn print out a paper. Because I was so far behind, I asked my friend Abby if she could go get my laundry for me. I told her it was in the top right dryer and it was really in the top left. Argh.
On my way to class I was in the basement so I decided to just double check and make sure I'd told her the correct dryer. Good thing I did that - I saw my clothes in my dryer and realized what had happened. I left the poor girl a note, which she thankfully got, and eventually ended up getting her clothes back to her around 7 p.m. this evening. Very nice freshman, didn't yell at me at all - even seemed surprised that I'd folded her shirts. Of course I would fold her shirts - if I didn't it would be my fault they got wrinkled after sitting around in my laundry basket all day. That would've been just additional meanness after already stealing her laundry. She was very nice to me. I actually was horribly amused by the whole thing. It's about the funniest thing that's happened in the past few weeks.
Tired now, going to sleep."

All their literature said Feb. 15.

Unfortunately, while filling out the online app. this evening, it informed me it was due Jan. 15. Excuse me? That's just not right. Don't play those games w/ my head. It's so mean! So after a good dose of panicking that semiexpat was nice enough to allow herself to be dragged into, I sent off the application and have decided to hand deliver the personal statement and transcripts tomorrow. 

Why am I having so many problems w/ things lately? Have I just become more incompetant or is it because prior to this I never really had to deal w/ these types of issues before. First the huge debacle w/ the payment for the powerbook (2hrs45min on the phone w/ Apple) then RPS messed up my meal points, and now this deadline mix-up. All in the course of 2 weeks. How does this happen? Putain! Je ne comprenne pas!

It's mostly set up - all the major stuff is set up on it and everything - just a few kinks left to work out. I'm really excited about it. It's so shiny and pretty and yay! Now if only I could get the other stuff totally installed on it everything would be great.
It's also easy to type on - which is something I was worried about. My right wrists has a tendancy to think it has carpel tunnel every once in awhile, so I'm glad the keyboard seems like it'll work out. 
As for the rest of this week - eh. 
That guy never called or emailed, and I was too sick yesterday to go out to the bar that we went last Thurs, so I have no idea if he was there. Sad. I guess if he'd wanted to he would've called though, because I think I made it fairly obvious I was interested. Since he didn't, I'm just going to walk away w/ my pride mostly intact. Yay for me. Bah and humbug.
But hey, I got a new computer, this week was not a total waste."

"event","So my friends talked me into seeing Big Fish today. It was actually really good. I enjoyed it. I really do like big, epic, violent, romantic blockbusters best, but this was still extremely good.
However, this meant that I never made it to the journalism school this afternoon like I'd planned on doing. So I had Julia drop me off there on our way back from the movie...at 6 p.m. on a Saturday...when there's no one in the building...and all the lights in the hallways and offices are off...and I'm wandering around alone in the dark. I basically walked through the jschool, locked myself in the office, sat down, checked my email, and walked out and went home w/o doing anything. I learned today that I have a severe paranoia of being in a building supposedly alone at a time when there's no one else around. That's probably a very good, safe and practical response, but I still feel wimpy. It's not so much that I mind being in a place when I'm alone so much as I mind the thought of there possibly being one other person in there with me. Fear of the unknown is a powerful motivator.

I also now feel like a stalker. I emailed that guy from the other night, he emailed me back, I emailed him again and then was bored this evening and (at the urging of semiexpat) called him to see if he wanted to go get a drink. Unfortunately, another friend from out of town was visiting so he was busy. Sad. And of course there's this whole stalker feeling I now have. Sigh...we did talk for about 4 minutes though, which is good. I figure I've probably confused enough guys in the past w/ overly subtle signals, I might as well hit this one over the head w/ the ""Yes, I'm interested"" mallet - maybe it'll actually get me somewhere =/
Looks like I'll just have to wait and see. Either he'll think I'm a stalker and run away, or he'll respond. At this point I think it's his turn.

So instead of going out drinking, I went out w/ a friend and we got Bailey's and Smirnoff Rasberry Vodka and then went and watched the Jane Austen movie Mansfield Park. Fun times. I now have a rather large bottle of Bailey's - or more accurately, she has it, since my dorm does not allow me to keep my alcoholic beverages in my room even though I'm 21. Bah. It was still fun."

"event","Yeah, so I went iceskating last night w/ a bunch of people (and by bunch I mean about 15 sophomores, it was great). I fell over sooooo much. About 10 minutes before the ice closed I even took a nose dive, landed hard on my left knee, and that was the end of my iceskating for the night. The knee is now kind of bruised and swollen, but no major or lasting damage. It just hurts when I bend it. Bah. The reason I kept falling was that on my new skates (that I got for Christmas! yay!) the toe pick is much closer to the ice than any other pair I've used. I kept catching my toe on the ice and then I'd fall over. I didn't even fall that much the first time I ever went iceskating! It was still fun. My knee just hurts.
I tried to get ahold of the guy from last night to go ice skating, but I kind of chickened out. I didn't have his number and didn't want to call our mutual friend who had gone back to Indy simply to ask for it. I did email him when we got back and made sure to add my cell # into the signature line. Hopefully I won't have to beat him over the head w/ this. If nothing else, he wanted us all to go to Bear's next Thursday for Karaoke again, so I will see him then. 
Ha, mickle's right. We really all do seem to be getting out of our dry spells right now. This is why I like second semester better - only silliness, boringness, and bastardness seems to occur first semester, but second semesters have always been fun (well, mostly, we will overlook their little...um...quirks for the sake of my argument).
Anyway, now I'm just going to be chicken and sit around and wait to hear back from him...behavior which could explain the lack of dates I seem to incur. Hehe, silly me.

"event","Can I just state that I had a wonderful night tonight?
I really really did. 
Roommate and I went out w/ some old friends of ours - by old I mean from freshman year. We were going to go to Bear's for Karaoke, but it was way too crowded, so we ended up at Kilroy's instead. It was so much fun! We got to see two of our friends whom we hadn't really gotten to see this past year and a couple of their friends, and it was an enlightening experience. This is really the first time we'd gone out to the bar w/ polite and respectful guys. The difference between these guys and those whom we normally go to the bars w/ was very prominent. The guys we usually end up at the bars w/ - C and C - are rude, obnoxious, and arrogant. These guys were none of those things, and it was wonderful. It ended up being me, roommate, and the four of them. We eventually did make it back to karaoke, but we were almost the only ones there. Interestingly enough, one of the guys whom I hadn't seen in awhile seemed to be making it very clear that he was interested in me. I was wondering if it was because he was drunk, but roommate assured me he'd started before he'd even had anything to drink. I can see this as having some potential. In the four years I've known him, I've always thought he was by far one of the better guys on campus. Heck, I've even been jealous of girls that he's dated because I know what a great guy he is. Intelligent, handsome, fun, polite. This sounds...hopeful. He kept smelling my hair, which was a little odd, but I did use some nice smelling hairspray today to keep my hair from falling out of the ponytail. Ho hum. Good day. Happy now.

Side note - ethics cases came out today for competition - there's a case on photojournalism ethics! Yay! Excited! Woohoo!

"event","first week was good. i think i like all my classes. i even am taking a cool history class where the professor is going to force me to learn footnotes - something i've been too lazy to do in my happy world of paranthetical references, but if he's forcing me, i gotta learn.
i'm still not sure what i think of the rock and roll history class. obviously this guy doesn't know as much as my dad, but the class is kind of fun. i think i'm just too much of a snob to be able to sit there and not be disappointed in the lack of actual historical substance. history of rock shouldn't just be names and dates and music, it should also be a look at the counter-culture that was gaining speed, and how rock music was a reflection of the times.
yes, i am my father's daughter sometimes =P

other than that, the week was pretty good. went to the bird the other night for 0.15 draft night. it was fun, and interesting. i've discovered that i really hate to have any physical contact w/ people who qualify in my book as sexual predators - even if it's as little as having him put his hand on my shoulder as a line of us are trying to weave our way through the very crowded room. i can't count the number of times i'd catch myself making a face. blech. blech blech. but he's friends w/ my friends, and what he did was in an entirely different social circle and many years ago, so it probably isn't known by my friends. at least the only time he ever touched me was when we were walking through the crowds. i've dropped semiexpat's name enough that i've got a feeling he knows i know what he is (this is that ex-coach you told me about. the one that got the no coach/team member dating rule in place) he's polite to me, but keeps his distance, which is all i ask. bah. bah bah.

I think this plans to be an interesting year. For one thing, I finally get my BA in journalism. No more journalism schools for me...EVER. 
And I turn 22.
And I go to graduate school (pending admission....)
And I will learn to play the guitar.
And I am going to go ice skating more.
And...I dunno what else, but I'm sure something interesting will happen.

Today seemed very appropriate for the start of the new year. When I woke up, my voice was so low and messed up that I knew it was going to be a day of coughing. Yay for coughs. So I spent the day on the couch reading the book my mom got for Christmas - The Da Vinci Code. It was pretty cool. Part of the fun of reading it was that I'd made it my mission to read the whole thing today. I love marathon reading sessions. Took me less than 12 hours. Now why can't I read that fast when I'm at school? So yeah, t'was a decent day.
I guess tomorrow I really need to start my applications to graduate school. I'm running out of time.

Web tv sucks. I ended up sending an email 8 times to my boss and another email 17 times to an adviser in the business school. All of that was because webtv decided not to be compatible w/ webmail. Bah.

All in all, I've had a fairly interesting week and a half since the semester ended - which means that this is either going to be a very long post, or a series of posts.

Anyway, going back to Friday, Dec 19, my semester ended. FINALLY. Saturday I left w/ one of my friends to go to Indy before going home. The getting there in itself was an adventure. My friend had offered me a ride earlier in the week because she was driving up to the airport. I gratefully took her up on the offer. Friday, she came by and told me she didn't have any place to park her car because she didn't want to leave it in longterm parking at the airport. She wanted me to take the car back home with me, which I immediately refused to do. I'm sorry, but there's no way I want to be driving her 2002 Honda CR-V w/o any insurance and keep it for 3 wks. No. That's way too much liability on my part. Not doing it. I told her I'd see if any of my friends would babysit her car for her and that she should also ask around.
Saturday morning, 8:30 a.m. (we get kicked out of the dorms at 10:00 a.m.) she knocks on my door and tells me she still doesn't know what to do w/ her car. She's panicking so I said I'd call around and that she should come back in a little while. I call about 5 or 6 different people, none of whom are home. I go take a shower, pack the rest of my stuff, and then she knocks again. This time she tells me that since she couldn't find a place for her car, we're going to take a cab to Indy. Since there are three of us (another girl came w/ us) there shouldn't be any problem paying the $67 cab fare (plus tip = ~$80). I am NOT happy. I'm sorry, but I really don't have thirty some dollars to be spending on cab fare. I mean, I guess I do...but I was too annoyed w/ her to give in to that suggestion. Had she mentioned this earlier, I'm sure I could've found another ride. Instead, she's trying to stick me w/ a rather expensive cab fare. Very annoyed. So I make one last phone call, that I had considered making, but wasn't sure if it'd be proper. I called up my friend, Dan, and made his roommate wake him up. I knew that Dan had a friend who lived in Indy, because we had stopped there after a concert once. He offered to call his friend for me to see if we could leave the car there. He called, got his friend's roommate (whom he had woken up), and the roommate said it would be no problem. We were all set. So...we then began our mad dash to get to Indy on time because it was late and the flight she had to catch was at 12:50. We were running really late, and didn't get to the guys' house until about 11:45. We h ad bought donuts along the way, and so I pounded on the door a couple of times, and finally someone answered. I just kind of threw the donuts at him, thanked him, and established that yes, it was okay if the car live there for three weeks. We then had to get my two friends to the airport. Luckily for me, Amy, the woman I was staying w/ Saturday (which is an entirely different story) was very nice, and had offered to drive my friends from the car to the airport. Everyone made their flights on time and there were no problems, but I was still very annoyed at the lack of planning that had gone into the whole thing. 
I also heard from Dan a few days ago - apparently the guy I had given the donuts to and arranged things with had no idea what was going on. He wasn't the one who had talked to Dan and the guy who did know what was going on had gone out for a run. Instead, donutguy had just woken up (because I was knocking) and had expected that it was his girlfriend at the door. That must've been very confusing for him. I guess between Dan and his friend and the other two roommates they eventually worked out what had happened. 

Anyway, that's it for adventure #1 of last Saturday. I'm still a little annoyed, but oh well. 

Still to come:
Amy's family reunion

J'ai fini et Je suis finie.
Pas le meme chose, mais les deux sont vrai.

And yes, my brain does occasionally start stating simple sentences in french.

My finals ended the way most of my finals seem to end - with me LITERALLY running to Ballantine to turn in a paper before the professor leaves her office.
Ridiculous, but it's all finished.
That was 21 pages in about 48 hrs. That might be my new record.
Woohoo.
And I think I might even get an A- in the class. 

Now if only I'd have had the time to finish that incomplete...dum de dum de dum.

I went ice skating tonight. This is about the second time I've ever gone in my whole life. Except for the pain caused by ill-fitting skates, it was a lot of fun. I like to ice skate (I just wish it didn't make my arches and shins hurt so much!) By the end of the hour I was flying around out there and had one of the guys with us who'd played hockey for 10 yrs ask me how long I'd been skating. Response: um...once when I was 7 and once last semester. I like not sucking at things. And I also like the feeling of flying around on the ice, with my feet moving faster than I can actually manage - meaning my options are to either keep going as fast as I can, or fall over. When in doubt, go faster...go faster till you fly.

I then went to the irish place w/ some friends from work. T'was amusing and relaxing - plus it included meade. Gotta love it. The night ended with everyone making fun of me for leaving early to go play a game of chess.

Which I lost.
But I don't care. It was fun. Besides, I'd already beaten him both times we played. Him actually winning one makes it more interesting. Chessboy and I are pretty evenly matched when it comes to chess.

When I finally went back to my room, I finished my ""Christmas cd""  The Christmas cd isn't really about Christmas - it's just whatever I happen to be listening to when it's time for me to pack up and go home. It's always interesting to figure out my mood based on the musical choice.
Here was this year's cd:

Jeff Buckley - Hallelujah
Linkin Park - My December
Sideburn Mike - Abigail
Angelo Venuto; The Sicilians - Laura Non C'E'
New Order-True faith
Tonic - You Wanted More
no doubt - don't speak
Ben Folds Five - Brick
Angelo Venuto; Reina; The Sicilians - Vivo Per Lei
outkast - ms. jackson
tupac - life goes on
Sideburn Mike and the Lawsuite - Shadowridge
evangelion-end of evangelion

Fun stuff. 

And now, I go sleep. G'night to all. I'm leaving town tomorrow, so g'bye. Who knows when you'll hear from me. Have fun for the next few weeks."

"event","So my Tuesday morning, 8 a.m. final. I almost slept through it. My alarm was set for 6:30, but I'd gone to bed at 5:00 and had barely had any sleep the night before either. I very much slept through that alarm. I hadn't meant to, but I did. If I hadn't jokingly told someone Monday night that he should pound on my door before he left at 7:30 for his final, I never would've woken up. He actually took me seriously and pounded on my door around 7:15, which is the only reason I woke up and made it to the final. Very very good. 

Other than that...all three professors I asked this week are writing me letters of rec. Although my history prof whom I asked thought they were due this Friday, and therefore when I walked into her office today she sailed into me. Very scary. The first thing out of her mouth before she even said hello was something along the lines of, ""Oh, it's you. I'm rather annoyed with you right now! You've shattered all the expectations I had of you."" Not the sort of thing you want to hear from your letter writer. Noting the look of panic and fear that must've appeared on my face, she assured me she was joking and that she would be pleased to write a letter for me and would never dream of turning me down even if she was busy (HA, take that professor satan!). She was also pleased to learn that the first letter wasn't due until January 2nd, which would give her plenty of time.
Whew. For a mild-looking Scottish lady she sure is scary.

That being said, where's sane and how do I stay there again?

Current update - it's 4 a.m. Tuesday morning and I've only studied for 1/3 of my final, which is in four hours.

I have not written my 6-8pg final due at 5 p.m.
Haven't even started on the history crap.

I did, however, print out all the forms I needed to get letters of rec from people. Now I just have to...um...get them to write them and send everything where it needs to go.

Not a happy camper. I'm not even sure one of them will agree. Still pissed off about prof.p telling me Saturday she wouldn't write the letter.

So what does this leave me to do before leaving? Um...too much? Yes. Of course. It always is.

New plan though - instead of filling out the stupid applications for grad school online, I can scan in the application, save it as a jpeg or tiff, then use paint shop pro to add the text. It makes me happy because I can see it all on the application.

I emailed my parents and brother about 10 minutes ago and asked them that question - although I phrased it much much much better so as not to scare them. It's always a good thing to know beforehand so you can tell the doctor what your relative wants. That way they won't start any procedures (in cases of Non Heart Beating Donors) before they ask the family.

And the end. Back to work. Must write and write.

Countdown to Lord of the Rings, Return of the King: 19hr8min.

Yes, I am going to the 12:01 showing. Aren't you happy for me???"

"event","It snowed tonight. It started snowing around 3pm when I was out at the theatre watching my friend's dance recital. I've ended up watching the snow on and off all day. There really is something soothing about it. Everything just seems quieter and less harsh than normal. That's what I like the best about snow - the softening effect it seems to have on everything and everyone (except the drivers who keep sliding off the roads....). And honestly, that's what I need right now - for all the roughness to simply take a break for awhile. I flipped my sleep schedule again - hence the fact that it's 5 a.m. and I'm still awake. Probably not a good thing considering my 8 a.m. final on Tuesday. I'll have to work on that. I think the worst thing about the past week and sleep has been that my life is invading my dreams. I can barely even fall asleep because my brain is going to fast, but then when I do sleep, I dream of everything that needs to get finished before next friday. There was even a very vivid dream about editing yearbook spreads. I'm feeling rather overwhelmed at this point - and if another person asks me what I'm doing after graduation I might just scream. It's a simple, innocuous question, unless you're the one being asked to answer it. I think the only way to maintain sanity might be to become sleep deprived (already started). If I'm sleep deprived, then I can walk around in a zombie-like state and when I do try to sleep, I won't be dreaming about graduate school applications and the yearbook. For some reason the snow helps though. Like I said, it softens everything. I think I want to go play snow frisbee tomorrow night. And now, no more thinking, just bed - or maybe to stare out the window some more at the snow. I like doing that."

Although this time they were legitimate alarms - apparently both involved cooking incidents. Grrrrrrr.

This is honestly getting ridiculous. I can't remember the last time I actually got to sleep through a Saturday night in peace (and I'm talking about getting woken up, I'm not talking about not getting to sleep for more amusing reasons). What was worse was that I've been holed up in the journalism school working on the yearbook for 27 of the past 56 hours and my mind was starting to go numb. I couldn't even remember the world for blanket for awhile there. That conversation went something like:

me: That's why you should always have a...uh...um...what's this called? (pointing to what was wrapped around my shoulders as I was speaking)
J: A blanket. You're delirious.

And now I really am kinda delirious.
I think I'm going to go to sleep and get up and write my big ole paper that's due tomorrow.

Once again, thank you semiexpat!"

"event","My throat hates me. I hadn't planned on updating this tonight because I had too much to do and needed to go to sleep. Oh, I went to sleep. I went to sleep 4 hours ago. Did I sleep? No. Am I tired? Yes, exhausted. What's the problem? Oh, well let's see, every time I lie down I start coughing. A lot. So far since midnight I've taken allergy medication, 2 teaspons of Codimal DH, a robitussin cough drop, and a full dose of Nyquil. I also had some throat comfort tea that usually works really well. Is anything working? No. I just drank some pineapple juice in hopes that it'll break up whatever is having a party in my lungs. This is getting painful. At first the cough was only annoying. Yes, I've woken myself up coughing twice every night since last Wednesday, but I figured it was going away since I only woke myself up once last night, and that was at around 8am so I figured I might as well get up and do some work. Unfortunately, tonight there has been no waking up, because there has been no sleeping. And there should be sleeping, because the way I look at it I'm medicated enough for there to be a LOT of sleeping. But is there? Nope. No sleep for me. Here's my philosophy on the subject:
i'm sick and and i'm coughing.
i need sleep to get better and stop coughing.
i'm coughing so much that i can't sleep.
if i can't sleep, i won't get better.
if i won't get better, i won't stop coughing.
if i won't stop coughing, i can't sleep.
See the pattern? See how very wrong this whole situation is? Can you tell I'm pissed? Cause I'm pissed. Very pissed. And this is painful, did I mention that? Not only is my throat feeling like a potato peeler has been scraped from lungs to tonsils, but this isn't just a regular, polite cough. Nope, this is the full body, spasm cough. The side effects being abdominal pain (although my abs are getting a great workout, I'm sure of it) and a massive headache from the pressure that comes when I cough. The headache really sucks. A lot. This whole situation sucks in fact. Have I mentioned how seriously pissed I am in the past three sentences? Because I mustn't forget to leave that part out. I don't think I can repeat it enough times.
Actually, I probably have said it quite enough. Even though I'm not going to be able to go to sleep, I should at least stop rambling and do something useful, like work. I have much too much to do for the next 3 wks to get sick at this point. Grrrrrr...methinks no class for me tomorrow. I might just go brave the deathcenter and see what they have to say about my little cough. I figure if there's something wrong w/ me, they might as well figure it out now so if there's something they can do to fix it it'll get fixed sooner. Screw classes. These cough suppressants, which aren't working all that well, will probably start kicking in by then and I'll be out like a light. And if I'm asleep, what good is class?
I quit."

"event","Hmm...I really didn't get as much done as I needed to. And by that statement I mean almost nothing got accomplished. In all fairness to myself, I did spend half the break sick on the couch and am now enjoying coughing fits. Yay rah! This whole sick for breaks thing is really starting to get old. My body needs to start realizing that just because I'm going home for awhile, that is not a license to simply shut down. It is still needed ~_~ Bah.

Now I need to figure out how to get everything done before winter break. If I were smart I'd be panicking right about now. Lucky for me, I'm not smart and I'm also extremely good at repressing things I'd rather not deal with. Actually, that's probably not a good thing. Is there such a thing as good repression? Eh, I'm sure there is. Life floats along smoother when you repress...at least that's what I'll keep telling myself =P

I ran into my roommate and her mother today at the grocery store. It was pretty funny, that always seems to happen when we're home (yes, my roommate/suitemate of the past four years is...er...kind of from my home city - well, she's claiming two home cities, the other one being Paris. One is cool, one gets her in-state fees. whatever works I guess.) But anyway, the roommate was very excited at the fact that I was buying eye makeup. I pointed this out to her because I knew she'd get a kick out of it. I don't know why, but I continually seem to amuse my friends by doing things that are normal for most other people. I honestly don't think my behavior is all that abnormal, yet many people that have known me are shocked to find out I go to bars, shocked to learn that do happen to know what alcohol tastes like.... Yes, I do happen to have the good little Catholic girl image. I rarely have to do anything to consciously maintain that image (it kinda just happens automatically). However, the image people perceive should not negate the reality of the situation. I think the best example of this is probably two weeks ago when I ran into an ex-boyfriend at the bar. He was quite shocked to see me there. And later IM'd me to let me know it really threw him because he'd never thought I'd be the type to go to bars. =P So there has to be a type now? You know, maybe if he'd have figured stuff like that out about me while we were dating I wouldn't have broken up with him...er...nah...prolly still would've. I think what is confusing people that have known me for the past few years is that I refused to drink until I was 21, except for the 2 months I was in Europe - but it was legal there. They don't seem to understand the whole legality thing bothering me because it's never bothered them. They seem to have this mindset that because I wouldn't drink before 21, I wouldn't drink after I was 21. Morons. My policy on drinking has always been that I wouldn't drink when it was illegal, and once it was legal, I'd figure something else out, which is what I'm doing now. So now why is my behavior so odd to these people? I really just don't understand. 

People really need to just see what's in front of them instead of looking at what they've always seen.

"event","it's been a long semester w/o a break. unfortunately, i get to spend the majority of mine writing an amazing amount of papers. i'm just oh-so-excited. see me grinning? oh, wait, no, i'm standing on my head, that's actually a frown. sorry for the confusion. you'd think you would've realized by now that when my feet are in the air, i'm not standing on them! 
dumb people are everywhere.

so other than the amazing amount of work and the fact that there really are no interesting males around at the moment, i actually realized today that i really am enjoying myself right now. life is good. that's always a pleasant realization. usually i'm too wrapped up in being stressed or dealing with stupid drama for life to be good. but somehow, despite the past week's drama, life is good (perhaps it's because that drama wasn't mine.)

yeah, one of the editors i was working for (the one for the newsmagazine, not my yearbook editor) was doing such a bad job that she offered to resign. unfortunately, she didn't realize the EIC of the daily would take her up on the offer. well, he did. so now for the next two issues there is no editor (and no features editor either actually, same situation). note me not be sad. there were a lot of bad editorial decisions coming out of the magazine. i'm sorry it had to come down to this, but it was not the wrong decision. it's caused some major drama at work though. it's also caused me to  rescind my own resignation (i've been designing for them all semester) because the design editor quit out of protest, and only three of us had been designing the magazine. sooooo...i said i'd come back to do some pages, and the design editor for the daily is stepping in to do some pages (which is cool, cause he's awesome) and the third designer is staying on also, so we should be all set. 

by the way, methinks i'm giving up on the guy from the daily that i was dancing w/ at halloween. nothing ever really came of that, and lately there's just been nothing there at all. bored now. time to move on. unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be anyone to move on *to* - which is fine i guess, since i've got deadline and finals to deal with once i get back from break. bah. i may think life is good right now, but it could also stand to be a little more interesting on the male front.

and now i'm going to sleep. have a good break everyone.

the class ended up being rather interesting. we had a guest prof who started off class by asking us all to give our names and something interesting about us. i decided to say that i've done yearbook for 6 years and design for both the book and the weekly newsmagazine, to which he responds, ""oh really? let's talk during break.""
basically he wants my help in looking over his most recent book and figuring out what he needs to put in his next two contracts to get everything he wants. fascinating task. not sure i'm up for it, but i think i have more than the general knowledge of book publishing. better yet, i know how to find out more. i'm kind of curious to see where this ends up going. could be kind of cool. 


hm, now my exRA friend is trying to get me to come downstairs and drink white russians w/ him. this is a bad idea on all sorts of levels - A)he has a girlfriend. B)we have a tendancy to flirt shamelessly when we're SOBER. C)there are certain rules i won't break, and drinking in the dorms is one of them. so basically, bad idea all around, not gonna play. why cause myself more trouble and annoyance? besides, i don't really want to be that girl. and on that note, i think i'm going to go to sleep."

but now i've gotten away from the whole photo debacle of this morning. stupid, lazy people ~_~ grrrrr.....


i'm also sad because i'm sincerely missing my karmically linked buddy. =(  not kidding, we're practically living each others lives. it makes having conversations so much easier - there's much less to explain when you're starting off on the same page. of course, the whole 5 hour difference is a little bit of a bummer. what sucks is that on nights like tonight, when i have two huge projects due tomorrow, i could always count on her to be awake at some point during the evening to take a break with me. she was always up studying bio or chem or biochem - and i guess that paid off, literally and figuratively. good for her ^_^  i'm still going to miss her though.


all right. methinks I might go take a nap before getting back to my history paper. that's actually the one i'm most worried about. i appear to have missed the point of the assignment the first time around - not something i'm used to doing. sigh. oh well.

have a wonderful evening folks - and just a warning, i'm still very cranky. if there's anyone you'd like me to yell at, just point me in the correct direction. semiexpat has already recommended going after the apprentice, but as i told her, i simply haven't the time to delve into that issue. not that it wouldn't be amusing.... mwahahahaha.

i'm also really annoyed w/ lazy people at work. they wanted me to run photos on my page from spring of 2000 even though there are perfectly good photos from spring of 2003. the difference was that spring of 2003 photos would've taken the photo editor 10 more minutes to find. i'm gauging this on the fact that it took me a total of 20 minutes to find and having never done this before i had no clue where to even begin looking and had to be walked through it every step of the way.

laziness is fine. laziness that makes the quality go down is NOT fine. stupid people doing stupid things. what's worse is this got past the EIC and photo editor. i kept asking and they kept saying ""oh, it's fine"" - well, no, it actually isn't. second rate publication. bah."

I take that back. I do care, but I care about all the people that are pissing me off right now. I honestly got so annoyed w/ a stupid prick the other day that I yelled at him in the middle of the lounge area because he was being rude to one of my friends. Part of that was because he was pissing me off. The other part of it was frustration over not being able to do anything in the situation where my best friend's ex is being a total moron. I wish I could just yell at him, but I can't, it's not my place. I had a rant about it up on my away message and got a ton of responses. It was great. 


Check it out:
my rant: Auto respons (12:06:40):i am indignant for my friend, therefore:
for most guys, except the ones w/ really healthy egos, there are two types of girls - those they see as above them, and those they see as below them. if your ego can't handle dating an accomplished woman, then don't. you're obviously not mature enough to realize that people excel in different things and you shouldn't see yourself as unworthy of the person you're dating. you're an idiot and obviously need to find yourself someone to date who you think is below you so you can step on her and kick her around and feel superior. that seems to be what you're looking for, and i'm sorry, but you certainly aren't going to find that where you keep looking.
and if you think this is directed at you, it probably is.

Maybe I'm being too harsh on everyone, but all I'm asking for is that people show a little bit of consideration and compassion for others. Is that too much? Seriously folks. It's NOT THAT HARD. Just don't act like a jerk. 

And yes, I am bitter. And no, I don't know why. It's been a long semester, and yet not nearly long enough.





Oh well, fun with quizzila.

Which<br>means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're<br>the kind of chick that can hang out with your<br>boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't<br>care about presents or about going to fancy<br>placed. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy<br>being around your boyfriend.

kind of makes me wonder why I don't have one...oh, wait, nevermind, I scare them all away by my bitterness and apathetic approach to life."

"event","Okay, so I just got back from the The Juliana Theory concert w/ my friend. IT WAS AMAZING. That was the best concert I've ever been to. I love their music. They sounded awesome. I got Brett Deter and the drummer, Chip, to sign my Pictures Stars and Dreams cd. And I also got pictures w/ them. YAY! This is one of the few times in my life that I am actually going to be giddy and girly about seeing an incredibly talented and absolutely wonderful band. I've been wanting to see them in concert for the past 3 years, and now I finally have! I'm SO HAPPY! YAY!!!!!!!! My good friend, Dan, w/ whom I went to see the show was amused. He'd never seen me get this excited over anything before - and he's my very good friend. I'm definitely excited.
And now I'm going to bed, so I can wake up in the morning and have reality not just come back to my life, but come back to my life swinging punches. Ouch.
g'night."

"event","Oh yeah, and the reason why I'm melancholy is that my friend is leaving for Oxford tomorrow and she'll be gone for two years doing graduate studies. 
You know how there are certain friends that are for different reasons? Like one person gets to know all your work troubles, one person all your home problems, another all your friend problems, another relationship problems. And often these categories overlap into one friend, but almost know one ever gets to hear all the problems and all the issues because most people don't get everything? Well she got everything. Our lives have run parallel to each other in so many different ways that it's honestly amazing. The reason we know so much about each other is simply because in many ways, we are each other. I'm going to miss this woman so much. It's going to be hard not having her here to help me. Her advice on life has gotten me through the past three years and saved me from making a few mistakes. Then again, there are some mistakes I made that I should have learned by example not to make.... Celloboy was one of those. The first time he tried to kiss me, he was technically still hooking up with her, my best friend, for the past two months. That was the week before finals of spring semester freshman year. I to this day don't know what he was trying to pull. And yes, there was brief contact before I told him to knock it off. So here is officially cheating on my best friend. Needless to say, I told her immediately. I think she was a little hurt, but things had been going downhill for her with him (let's just say he hasn't changed much in 3 years) and so she didn't blame me, which was good. Why did I bring this up? Argh, I don't remember, oh yeah, I was going over the mistakes I made that I should have learned from her not to make. Then again, had I learned from her mistakes, I wouldn't have made some very important mistakes of my own. Then again, there have definitely been some of her mistakes that I have learned from. I miss her already.... I want to analyze life for hours on end when we're both supposed to be studying! Sigh...good luck and come home safe someday."

"event","So when I woke up this morning (after I created this little livejournal thingie), I went to make myself a sandwich. What did I find but that my bread, which I BOUGHT 2 days ago, was already moldy. ARGH! ARGH ARGH ARGH! I realize that bread molds...I just wish that I could've had my sandwich.
Other than that my Tuesday went pretty much the same as all other Tuesdays - meaning that I left at 11 in the morning and came back around 10 in the evening. Oh well, at least I got stuff accomplished - like buying random IU presents for family that I'm going to see in Chicago this weekend that I haven't seen in 6 years. I figure I might as well bring presents. 
And now that I've had coffee I'm extremely twitchy. I should probably go use this extra energy to go finish some reading for tomorrow."

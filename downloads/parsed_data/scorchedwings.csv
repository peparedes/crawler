"event","I think we need to have a new TV channel. We called it ""Baked"", or maybe ""Sloth"". It would show nothing but reruns of ""Bob Ross"" paintings, ""How It's Made"", ""New Yankee Workshop"", and anything else that has a narrator with a soothing voice. Those shows hypnotize me. It's the logical answer to ""Versus"" TV.

""How It's Made"" has to be the best nerd TV show ever created. I have to admit that I'm a little excited when TiVo has a new episode to watch.

I hate the food co-op. There, I said it.

I keep going back. I keep trying to be a good little hippie. I do enjoy their ginger cookies at the co-op, but it's about a 50% chance that they are stale. So... I'm taking that out of the ""positive"" category. 

I stopped there at the co-op again on my way home to get some groceries. I wanted some ice cream and chocolate sauce, bread, and bananas. I gather up everything, and go to search for the chocolate sauce. They have:

1. Fat free chocolate sauce (ick at all the chemicals)
2. Dairy free chocolate sauce (full of soy and chemicals)
3. Chocolate free chocolate sauce. (Why? Really? how can that be healthy?)

Is it too much to have a couple cans of Hershey's on the shelf?

And why do all the people that shop there look so unhealthy?

I'm embracing my inner redneck again, aren't I?

"event","Last Thursday I was riding a bike to to grocery store (I need to write that story down, it's funny), and I took a really awkward tumble and tweaked my left knee. I went to the doctor today to have it checked out. Torn MCL, but my meniscus appears to be intact. I may torn  the MCL/meniscus connection. I got the OK to begin rehab, and I'm very, very excited. If I don't continue to heal in the next couple of weeks I'll go for MRIs then. In the mean time, I think I'm going to also go buy a set of Asterisk knee braces, may as well, super burly.

While I was there at the doctor's office, he drained a cyst in my hand as well. It was actually pretty funny.

""I'm going to use a needle to drain it, and then inject steroids. This is going to hurt quite a bit""
""OK""
""How's that? That was probably the worst, wait, once more it'll hurt""
""It's OK, stab away. The endorphins are nice, it's kinda calming really.""
""Craig, you know that's not normal, right? I never can tell with you.""

Again, I can relate to the tattoo addicts, and the SI cutters of the world. If I wasn't the adrenaline addict that I am to regulate my mood, I'd find something else."

I miss the bold punctuation from Proggy, but this Vera is so very very pretty. The perfectly round c's. The hinting is perfect for keeping vertical lines from anti-aliasing. It's monospace, and yet somehow the kerning is pleasing. The microserif on the lower case L, beauty. Perfect leading for programming.

"event","I saw Borat last week. I reserved judgment on it for a long time. I didn't make any quick judgments. An overwhelming majority of the reviewers and the audience seemed to like it. I admit that I laughed.

This morning, I read that Sasha Cohen had been assaulted outside of a club while pretending to be Borat. My first thought was ""he deserves it"". That's when I realized I'd made my decision about the movie. It was mean spirited, unoriginal, and took the easy way cheap laugh at every opportunity. It was two hours of the same stupid joke. The movie repeatedly attacks and satires the weak and the poor, while avoiding those who are worthy of satire. It could have been a clever and subtle movie, but instead it turned into an interminably long SNL skit. But, I suppose that I since it's so popular, he made the right choices, the movie has made a lot of money. At the end of the movie, I felt a little insulted. I felt that I had been served another helping of dumb media, another bit of lackluster and lazy entertainment. 

It's been interesting reading about the lawsuits. I think he probably deserves every one of them. Mean spirited...  One bit of comedy comes from the lawsuit from the frat brothers. They allege that they were given alcohol and then prompted to say the things that they did. I find the thought of a frat boy being fed alcohol and then being taken advantage of to be very ironic. Do unto others...  (Wow, my foul mood is just spilling out all over this morning)

Yesterday I went to Vancouver and saw the <A href=""http://www.bodyworlds.com"">Body Worlds</a> exhibit. I'm conflicted right now about it. It's a beautiful exhibit, but there is a medieval, almost sensationalist vibe to it all that I can't quite decide how I feel about. I'll think about it some and decide later.

and... my new bike parts are almost all installed, and the new bmx racing series starts next week *woo*!"

He looks at me and says ""Do you know why I stopped you?""
""For turning left on red from the middle lane.""
He pauses for a minute, trying to decide what to do with honesty. ""Yes sir. Why did you do that?""
""I'm lost, it's one a.m., and I'm trying to follow the car in front of me.""

He let me go, and asked me to drive safely. The RCMP are so much cooler than American cops. Sidenote, all you can eat sushi... this is a concept that I'm not entirely sure is a good thing."

gridlove - A delusional fantasy that occurs when you glance at the person in the car next to you in a traffic jam and are momentarily convinced that they are the answer to all your hopes and dreams. <i>Were her feelings real, or were they just gridlove? She didn't care. She just prayed that her lane would catch up to his lane.</i>"

"event","I hope that the solo album from <a href=""http://www.taraslone.com/"">Tara Slone</a> comes out soon. She's the lead singer from Joydrop. She's a classically trained opera singer that changed careers to be in a rock band, the girl has talent. It's always cool to hear her sing. She never struggles with her voice, and she's got a serious set of pipes. I don't know anything about her band this time around, but it's pretty full and extremely well produced.

<strong>Edit:</strong> It's available on iTunes under the title ""Just Look Pretty and Sing"", and it's great. It's got a version of American Dreamgirl from the last Joydrop album, and a version of My Little Secret in French. As a sidenote, an ex-gf of mine spoke french, and I really only heard it when she was upset with me. But her scolding me in French was actually really sexy, so she pretty much got whatever she wanted."

So I'll tell a story. Last night I stopped at Panda Express for dinner. It's the McDonalds of the asian fast food world, but who else serves tofu at 9pm? They cooked some tasty veggies and tofu for me, and got a soda. I filled up my soda cup with ice, and filled it with tea from the Lipton tea canister. I stabbed my cup with a straw and drank... It was cleaning fluid. There is no graceful way to deal with a mouthful of hot cleaning fluid. And nothing goes with tofu like a chemical burn on your uvula. Somebody should really put a warning label up..."

"event","I've been deep inside a new product for the last couple of months at work. It's going to be a nice little app when it's done, and I'm relatively proud of it. For the last 2 weeks, we've been bug hunting. I don't know why, but this time around has been the most demoralizing bummer of an experience that I've dealt with at work in a long time. It's just been brutal, and has robbed all of the fun out of my job. 

So, I've presented something that is some of my best work ever, and then it just gets torn apart and handed back to me with these horrible quotes like ""It can't possibly go to beta until this button is put in a different place""

Now, just wait. I'm good at my job, and I thought about each and every button, and I put it there on purpose. I don't just spread things about randomly. I had a specific set of reasons and design parameters that dictated that placement. So, unless somebody brings me new DATA, some new information, I'm not moving it, because you've not changed my understanding of the system in any way.  ""It just has to be moved"" is not an acceptable reason, and brings nothing to the table.

And the sad part is that I know where it's coming from. The marketing crew didn't have much to do with this project. And so now I have to deal with ""just change it so that my existence is validated and I feel important"". WELL YOU AREN'T SO SHUT UP AND STAY OUT OF MY WAY.

I know it's been a very long time since I've posted anything other than comments in the mountain biking groups, so this is sort of to say hello again to anybody that might have added me as a friend once. So, umm... Hello.

So, I'm sort of crawling out of my hole that I dug for myself this winter... Last night I posted some new photos from this weekend. A couple of friend and I were pit crew for a friend's <a href=""http://www.nsunderground.com/wp-gallery2.php?g2_itemId=288"">rally car</a>. They were in the Oregon Trail rally race, and they finished 2nd in class, 6th overall (and that includes time lost when they rolled the car)

Last night, I replaced all the driveline components on my Bullit, and am very excited to have it in working order again. Tonight, it might even get a front derailiuer for it. It'll be the first time I've had one of those in years.

As far as the bikes go, I'm officially declaring 'freeriding' dead. I think downhill is actually going to step up to replace freeriding as more people get involved. We're all just getting ourselves hurt too much. I think it's time to quit hucking my bike off stuff and do some real adventure riding, some road trips to new places, and to quit building road gap jumps. Oh, and I should get my little boat ready for the summer too.

This week it's seemed like the sun has suddenly come back from a winter nap. I can't explain to you all how nice it is to have the sun setting at 8pm. It's so so wonderful to welcome the sun back, to be able to ride without headlamps after friends are done at work, and to have it be out long enough to dry out some of the puddles around here.

It takes a while to change from a brain state that thinks this is logical to a brain state that will allow for casual conversation about the weather and where to have dinner. It just takes time to change gears. Honestly, sometimes it almost hurts. Hearing words, and having to shift out of a visual and symbolic view of the world is so disconcerting that I feel dizzy. So... anyway... I'm sorry, sometimes it's just hard."

"event","Today...I had to wake up at 10 to go to my doctor's appointment...Sadly, The doc wasn't there...=.= I woke up for nothing! Anyway, I watched Viva La Bam all day until they put the new episode of MADE! But it was boring....it was about a kid that wanted to be a rapper....what a waste. Well my mom tells me that I have to stay at my step-aunts house cuz she's leaving out of town....but I don't mind cuz my step-aunt is 17 and we're like sisters. Plus she has a computer! Ha Ha Ha!

"event","The movies that I saw today was awsome! I watched ""Bewitched"" and ""Herbie:fully loaded"" It was so cute! ^.^ My favorite part in ""Bewitched"" was when Will Ferell said, ""Where out thou dog!"" and ""You shall lick my face and I shall lick your snout!"" <---I think that's how it goes....Anyway it was hilarious! I liked ""Herbie: Fully Loaded"" because Herbie looked so cute beating everyone in the race track! LOL! Well, My best friend in the world couldn't come with me cuz she had Church today....10:00 AM to 4:00 PM! It's cuz she goes to like 3 different churches! But hey, I don't blame her....She just loves God, and I respect that. Well I saw Inuyasha yesterday! Turns out they moved the time to 11:00 PM instead of 10:00 PM. I loved it when Shippo cried in the top of his lungs when he told Inuyasha that Kagome,Miroku,Sango stopped breathing. It ....*snif* was so touching....*wipes tear* Well I gues that's all that happend today...Oh ""La Academia"" is on right now! I wonder whwo's gonna leave this time! I'm pretty sure it's gonna be Silvia....or Adrian...but I'm pretty sure it's Silvia....Well I gotta go! My step uncle is bragging to get off of the computer cuz he likes to talk to girls online! LOL! HOW PATHETIC! NO OFFENSE JR! LOL!

"event","I don't really mind that I cut my really long hair to a very short cut!! But my mom is complaining and worrying how is she going to fix my hair for my 15! >< Ugh! I don't know what to do!.....Oh well. The reason I cut my hair is because I want a new look for high school (freshman) and also because I hate it that I allways have knots in my long hair....so I cut it....Right now I'm in some kind of Princess house demonstration. I don't care much for crystal plates....Well I'm gonna leave now!

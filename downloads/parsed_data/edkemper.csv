"event","Well well well. It seems everybody's found their calling in this dank little corner of cyberspace. Let's see if I can find mine. Since no one plays fair and every seems to fucking want a piece of you, I suppose we'll call this ""friends only"" for the time being. Friends. I like that. No more, no less, and no overstepping bounds. Oh, God, I almost sounded like mother there. Careful, careful Ed. It goes without saying (or should, at least) that I'd be more inclined to talk to a nice, pretty, hometown girl rather than some shady character that wants to mindfuck me, but who wouldn't, right? I don't think I'm <i>completely</i> alone in this."

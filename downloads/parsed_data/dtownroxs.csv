"event","i need a new hair color!! i know what i want but i dont want to mess with beach. Beach dries and damages my hair nasty and it only keeps getting because i flat iron it.  But i want it so bad!! i want just the top beached blond but i dont know if its going to look good on me because im so damn dark. any ways. i ran into a friend of mine on thurs at ross*she works there* and it turns out that most of the girls that we hung out with back in high school that are now married and with kids have worthless lifes, including her.  i always kind of envy them because they had their shit together and a family but now i think im better off alone. Im getting my shit done alone and i like it that way. I dont even party as much as i used to.I really like the classes im taking. i like my math teacher, i like his teaching style but he talks so damn much. Sometimes i feel like if im in a history class!. i didnt like the  math porf i had last semester. i hated it so much i had to drop that class, i wasnt getting anything out of it. My writting teach is good mary*my last semester prof* recomended me to her. i wish i was a better writter but all i can do is keep trying. Its so hard for me to write papers i dont think i have good ideas and to top it off i t hink my english isnt good enuff. i cant spell for shit......oh well im going to school and i hope, no i better learn to write better.


I should of been asleep right now, i got so much shit to do tomorrow. buying a house is hard. getting papers together, meeting with the real state person and all that shit but im glad my moms wish is going to come true. she has always wanted to own a house and it might happen soon. now that my parents are getting a house i dont t hink ill be moving out soon. they need my financial help now more than ever..... it would be nice to have my own place but im such a mommas girl i would go crazy the 1st week i would be away from my MOther.

"event","Well today was the 1st day of school and it wasnt bad but i must admit i didnt want to go. I had sooo many plans for this semester. i was suppost to take a class with lina, carlos and nayeli but lina took a break nayeli changed her mind and by the time i register the class with carlos was full. I still see carlos after class. i met some cool people already. And im all exided that i have home work. im such a dork enjoy school and school work. i was sooo bored and tired in my math class that teacher talks alot but he is funny. i have to pass that class is my 2nd time taking it and i have to make it. i was disapointed and felt like a loser taking the same class again but it turns out im not the only one, some people are taking the class for the 3rd time. half of the people in my math class are  retaking  the same class, witch sadly makes me feel better haahah. I LOVE 1301! its on a comp and we do everything in the comp. i like it cuz its my last class and its late but the comp keeps me awake. oh yeah and mario is in my class, i hadnt seen him in a while. he looks diff everytime i run into him. YAY omar is in town. we are going to the movies tonight! i missed that punk!"

"event","I hate feeling this way. Its 2:30 am and i have to be at work at 8. Im so tired and sleeping but when i lay down i cant sleep. i need to do something about my sleeping disorder but i dont want to take pills any more, i think thats what messed me up.  i used to take pills almost everyday when i was in high school.  I have to take sleeping pills in order to fall asleep. Im always tired during the day and with no energy to do anything. I would perform so much better at my job if i had energy. I always plan to sleep early but it never happens  oh well.......
hmmm
ely is going to be in chi-town on feb 20something and i would love to go see her! Last time we made plans to go see her in vegas it didnt happen......

"event","<font size=""-2"">i had the best Christmas ever this year...we had dinner, open gifts and dranked and danced and sang...in the past we always went to some ones house and i hated but this year it was just MY family. My mom was a sad but she didnt let it show...first christmas with out grandma...New Years was a totally diff story we had family come from out of town. It was fun i hadnt seen my uncle for years. Tio Chali raised me, my dad was always over here in the US and my tio used to take me to school and look over my mom and me. Ive always felt like my dad was never there for me and i hate him(? such a strong word and i cant, hate him but im so mad at him for not being for me throught out my child hood) him. That is something that i could never tell him and eveytime im with him or around him i feel like just asking him why? why werent you there for me?  i know he was over here working but i  think thats not a good nuff excuse. He could of gotten a job in mexico and be with us. its not like him being over here benefited us at all, we were still poor.....i made him cry on new years eve because i finally told him how i felt but i feel bad that i hurted him.....

im sick as a dog...im going to die....i cant even sallow....."

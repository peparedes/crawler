"event","well, apparently,my worst fears have come to surface... remember how special andrew used to tell me i was, and how he asked me to marry him, and all of that bullshit? well, apparently he asked the ""her"" to do the same after a very short time period, being as "" he was only with her after he dumped me""... how he made me promise i wouldn't tell his sister about our plans, how he was going to marry me, have my kids, and we were going to grow old together, but he tells his sister how in love he is with her, and how he asked her to marry him...i knew it meant nothing, and i was just lying to myself when i told myself it did... i knew it was impossible for him to mean one thing he said to me... everything he said to me, he has more than likely said to ""her""...  and by me putting all of this in the open, it just means that andrews probably not going to talk to me anymore, and he's going to go back to hating me like he did before... but thats my fault for ""always trashing him""((me trashing him was saying he wont talk to me and i missed him and saying how depressed i was))... maybe this time, i am trashing him... and im ay deserve for him to not want to tlak ot me, but thats fine... the friendship thing wasn't going to last too much longer anyways.. he leaves soon, and things will go back to how they were... whatever, i dont give a shit... fuck it... im not going to talk about this anymore, with anyone else... i've said what i needed to say, no less, no more... its out of my system now, im going to go finish up the whole crying thing, and forget about all those gawddamned LINES he used on me.... i should be over this... fuck, that was fucking 6 months ago... i should have never gotten into it... fuck it all to hell, it never meant anything... just as i had always feared..."

"event","im finding it harder and harder to trust people as i grow older and wiser... lately, ive been seeing the world in a totally different view from what i has previously viewed it before...  as a lot of you know, there has been a lot going on in the trailer park lately... and half the time, im too scared to even go outside, or go to sleep at night... things have always been bad here, with drugs, break ins... meth labs... but about a week ago, people started involving guns... ((see previous entry))... long story short, one guy tried to shoot another, didn't succeed, 2 days later, he shot himself... today they had the funeral...  some guy showed up, and a lot of people didn't want him there... i don't know what the deal was exactly... well, he ended up coming to the cliffside... and he got into it with the people who live directly next door to me... like 10 feet from my room... well they start fighting, and the guy whips out  gun, and all kinds of crap went down, and my neighbor ended up macing the guy.... the cops come, and do nothing but take the chicks statement who maced him... instead of doing the smart thing and leaving, the guy goes acrossed the street from me, in the trailer behind the A-frame.. and chills there... well, by 6 pm, all the rednecks were shit faced drunk off their asses... plus doing whatever drugs they were doing... we call the cops, and they never show... most of these people are under 21... well, about half.... as the night goes on thy keep getting louder, and more violent.... i keep hearing them screaming... im afraid to leave chance outside... i don't want them to poison him or something like they did my neighbor's dogs...  as we speak they are fighting, and im afraid, so im getting off of here"

"event","<FONT size=2>my last entry didnt give much detail... but this one will... frida night i heard a bunch of gunshotds...sad thing is, im used to it, so i rolled ovre and went back to sleep... on saturday, about 5 or so, i heard some guys outside creaming at each ohter... sad hing is, im used to it, so it didnt bother me... then the screaming got louder, and my puppy started to freak out... the hair raised up on his back, and he was barkinglike crazy out hte window... so at this point, i realize something is probably wrong, so i go to look out the window, and there is about 7guys, and about 5 or 6 girls outsidetryign to keep these two guys from fighting... john and rob... well, frday night, john&nbsp; got drunk and shot his finger off, while trying to scare rob... that was the gunshots i was hearing... well, all of the sudden, john starts screaming "" im gona kill you, im gona kill you"" at htis point people start standing in front of rob... i couldnt tell then, bu john had pulled a gun outa his pocket... they move from in front of my house, to in frnt of the house next door, and john is waving the gun around, and i hear soemoen scream, ""what about your daughter john? huh? what about her, she needs you!"" and more peopel start to stand in front of rob... they end up actually fist fighting a lil bit, and move back, directly in fron of my house... john starts waving the gun around... we had our blinds closed peaking through them... at one point his gun was pointed straigh at me... then people start to back up... john squats down on the ground, and points his gun... at this point there is foad pouring from his mouth... the others said he was drunk, but i ithnk he was on meth also, or crack or soemhting... the he screamed ""rob, i got you in my sites im gona kill you mother fucker, im gona kill you!"", then his cousin tackeled him from hedind, got him on the ground, and crouched over him so john couldnt get a clear shot...&nbsp; ""jeremy get outa the fucking way, im gona kill him, get outa the fucking way!"" about this time, a nother guy speeds downt he road and attepts to run john over... but ended up stopping literally 2 inches from him... around this time, 25 minutes after we had called 911, police sirens start to be heard... so everyone piles into cars, and thats all we could se fromt he safety of my house... about an hour and a half later, jim came home from work, and said there was 5 police cars at te entrance of cliff side... we went outside to let chance out, and rob comes over and apologizes to us fo this happening in our fron yard... he said if some guy was going to come after him with a gun, he was gona let him shoot him, and let him go to jail... about that time, we found some bullets in my driveway&nbsp; so rob went ot go get one of the cops... the cop picked them up with his bare hands, which realy made me mad.. then said he would come by sunday to get our statments... i was gona give my statement...&nbsp; but i also knew that would make me a target for future shootings, and break ins, and stuff like that... so rob, and his best friend knew i was scared, and they gave me their phone numbers and told me if anyone even looked at me wrong to all them, and they would take care of it... sunday morning, when i came home from church, we saw john walking around, the released him about 10minutes after they picked him up on saturday, said he didnt actually shoot anyone, so they couldnt hold him... so at this point, im scared as hell, i started shaking, and when i got in the house i went o my room and cried...i mean i was deathly afriad this guy would come after me... later on, mom saw him, and being the brave/crazy lady she is, she asked him if he felt better today, and he said yea, that he was sorry for causing so much trouble, and reached to shake my moms hand and she hugged him... that could of ended very badly... this morning i woke up, and jim was outside... he came back in, and johns wife ((very very young, like 20, as was john)) told jim, that last night John killed himself... neighbors heard a gunshot, and called the police.. they all knew what had happened.... but the police wouldnt come out... this moring, johns wife came home from her mothers, with their baby, and found him dead... i blame the kanawha county police for this one... if they woulda came sooner, when he was trying to shoot rob, they coulda got him for attempted murder, or posssesiono f a deadly weapon with entent to kill, or something random, just to hold him at least over night... and he coulda came down from the drugs e was on, long enough to be ok...</FONT>"

"event","<P><FONT size=1>Danielle and i had sooo sooo much fun yesterday!!... well, the car wash was quite tiring, but it was worth all of the money we raised, i think we got $625 for our trips.... that's so exciting... i cant wait for cedar point! ((you guys really should come))... just 4 more days, yay.... after the car wash, mom took us to cozumel, and we ate enchiladas.. so so yummy... then we went to pat's and had lots-o-fun!... we watched the notebook, which was soo sooo amazing!.. its now in my top 10 favorite movie... but i guessed everything that was going to happen... i knew they were gona have sex.. that he would get the house... that she would get a new guy, that he would paint the house they way he told her, that she would find him and leave the other guy... that her mom was gona ruin it, that her mom would give her the letters, and that they would both die.... i rule... at least at guessing movies... we stayed up most of the night watching channels i don't get in alum creek... we watched a lot of fuse, and MTV 2... i don't think we got to bed till about 3 or 4, then my mom woke us up at like 7:17...ugh...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>went to church for the first time in 2 weeks.. missed last Sunday because i was on vacation... every time I'm away from church for a while, when i come back, it always hits me hard... as normal, it did... jt really made em think... I'm really not the Christian that i should be... i haven't been as forgiving as i should to some people... i mean lately i have done well, but in general, i haven't... i almost actually called my dad... i didn't.. but i think i will soon... i may actually go to Texas for a few days... but I'm not sure if I'm ready for that one or not yet... i know he's my dad, and his heath sucks so bad he probably doesn't have much time left... he always makes me so upset... and from what i hear, his drinking is worse than it was when i ran away to live with mom... i hear he's more violent now... apparently my half brother whom i don't really know, is living with him now.. and he got mad and just straight up punched Billy for mentioning my moms name?... i dono... but I've got a lot of stuff to work on this summer... i don't read my Bible even close to enough.. truthfully, i actually cant remember the last time i opened it up on my own outside of church or youth group functions... i need to work on getting closer to God.... I've gotten so far away this past year or so... lately, I've gone to church because i knew it was best, and that i kind of had to... but that's not how it is supposed to be... i need to go because i want to... I'm excited about VBS and camp... i know it will help a lot.. I'm going to try to cut back on cussing, and eventually try to quit... i bet half the people i know don't even know I'm saved... and that's really sad on my part... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>this upcoming year is my senior year.. do you know how crazy that is... it till feels like it was just last week that i moved here... and met tank and Todd outside the building underneath the overhang, singing Jay and Silent Bob's rap.. and met becca in homeroom... met Nathan on the bus... met Britt&amp;nbsp; and Logan in history class.. mrs.moir was so freakin crazy... i don't know, its just all happened so far to me.. 9th grade was amazing... 10th grade was ok... 11th grade sucked, but 12th has to be amazing.. it just has to be... i wont let it be anything else... i will enjoy the year... im not letting anyone or anything get in the way of making my senior year my most memorable year at GW, for good reasons, not bad... i want my last memories with my friends, to be good ones... i want to look back and say, wow i really had a good time, and had great friends... this will be the first year that i haven't had a boyfriend by my side,but i actually think i want it that way for now... i seem to have always gave my boyfriends priority, and put my friends second, and that was really messed up of me... i want to enjoy the friends that i have... i want to get closer tot hem than i have ever been before... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>i am in the process of reinventing myself... making myself into a better person... trying my hardest to be the best Christian i can be, and the best friend i can&amp;nbsp;be as well... these are the greatest days of our lives... we should enjoy them....</FONT></P>"

"event","OMG! i just had the greatest time ever!! china buffet was great, I heart sushi.. except that nasty kind.... eew... i spit like 2 of them out... so so gross... i did like the brown ones though.... o gawd that was great... then i got white sticky-ness all over me and Britt... if you only know.... gota love rice ball fights... then it got all over Katie's chair, and she got pissed... damn Chinese lady gave me and Britt dirty looks, then there was talk about man nipples, I'm still confused... then Katie found out ""schtinky"" works there.... VanBibber, Black Josh, and Trish showed up to give us a ride... and there kinda wasn't that much room... so me and Britt rode in the trunk, 69 style, with her head up my ass, and my neck squished against the trunk... that sucked so bad... yet it was a lot of fun at the same time... while we were in there we heard something about Travis and Katie touching each others asses or something, I don't understand... when we finally got there, VanBibber did a lot of goofing around in the parking lot, causing Britt's head to go straight up my ass...  when we hoped out, like 56432857325 people were standing there, laughing there asses off... it was great... the movie was really good too.. a bit long for some's attention spans, but really good... I don't know what was better the movie, or Black Josh's lil side comments... half the time I couldn't tell what he was saying, but I knew it was funny as hell... then people thought the movie was over, so they stood up, but really there was like 10 minutes left...grr at them... after the movie we just kinda chilled in the parking lot for a while myke and josh bitch fought, and myke slapped Katie, I got a picture... yay.... then I de-pants myself.... on purpose...it was great... I enjoyed it... and you know you did too!.... I so wore my super man undies to see batman, hahah...  over all , tonight kicked ass... I had a great time.. me and Britt patched everything up, and we're good again... I missed her a lot... last night, or the night before, I cant remember, Lacey and I also patched things up...  wooo for making a mends... I feel a lot better now that I'm making things right with you guys again...  I've been a bitch to a lot of you for a while... I haven't been myself for a while in general.. but I'm coming out of that.. and it feels really good... gawddmanit, I wasn't good enough to tell Black Josh about.. he didn't know who I was, but I knew who he was... I feel so unloved you guys ::shakes fist::... but from what I hear he was a black version of myke.. and yea, its true.. lol... I just wish Danielle wasn't sick! she was gona come too... I really want her to meet you guys... she's really cool, I like her a lot... but she is shy, so I may have to force VanBibber on her to open her up a lil... that will be a fun day...lol as soon as I get some money, we should see a movie and play laser tag.... we have to plan it on one of Mitchell's days off or something.. I miss him a lot too... OMG you guys, I'm starting to get a tan for the first time ever! I've been laying out in the sun about an hour a day, and its starting to pay off!! I'm so excited!... maybe, just maybe, one day I wont be the pastiest person you know... we shall see... well, I take that back JJ is the pastiest person we know.. but I'm the second for now.... my face is clearing up really well, I heart what the sun can do for acne... wow, I've been ranting for a while...

"event","<P><FONT size=1><STRONG>for those of you who dont know the situtation too well, me and my dad dont get a long... at all... i kinda hate him a lil bit... ( not going into details).... well hes back in the US now... he quit his job in Asbechestan or how-the-hell-ever you spell it... he was tired of doing allt he work for half the pay or some shit, i dont know... but he wants to see me.. this summer.. i this has made me quite pissy... i hate him so damned much... but he is my dad... and his health is super shitty, and for all i know he could die in his sleep... he lives off of beer, and occasionaly some peanuts... if he runs outa beer, he will drink iced tea untill the local liquor store opens, but thats very rare... and only on sundays... aparently grandma weeks is in bad shape.. and my brother billy and sister shelly have been visiting my dad a lot lately, and billy lived with/near him now.... im not sure.... i dont really know either of them.. i know billy was around a little bit when i was really little... but hes in his 30's and so is shelly.. (my dad is 55 or so)... i think ricky is wanting to take me down there to teexas to see them... i really really dont want to go.. but i know mom will make me feel bad untill i do.... if in fact he decides to go... </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><STRONG>no i wasnt ""trashing"" andrew in any way shape or form in my last entry... i was telling how&nbsp; felt, at that exact moment in time... venting, and getting my thoughts together... i see nothing wrong with anything i said, and see no exaggerations... ... maybe i took his actions wrong, but thats how the situation apeared to me at the time... &nbsp;i was (cearly) upset at the time, and had no one to talk to... so as i normaly do when im upset, i turned to my journal... my journal is the one thing that keeps me sain... i've stopped writing in the one i keep under my bed because i think my mom has been reading it.. shes been acting fishy lately... so this is all ive got... im contemplating going freinds only again... but im not sure yet...&nbsp; i know there are a few people who dont have ljs that read this...</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><STRONG>finals are nearing soon, and&nbsp;most of my freinds are leaving me... ive been distancing myself form them for the past couple of weeks, so hopefully it isnt so hard...&nbsp;im goignt o miss them all so damned much... ive started trying to get closer to those in myown grade lately... im still not feeling totaly&nbsp;comfortable at the table, but im workin on it...&nbsp;ill sit over there mostly on day C... im getting closer to a few... im sur things will be alil easier next year when im at GW all day, and have more classes and off periods with every body...</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><STRONG>carver.. i love my girls but im hatingt he class... its becaoming such bullshit... we've doing busy work and thats about it... ive gotten so close to a lot of people there.. but when you spend almost 3 hours with a small group of people 5 days a week, that happens... susan is really starting to show, shes only 3 months, but shes already got that cute lil tummy.. she gets married in a few weeks... at least she is doing wat she feels is right for her... jennifer and i hve gotten a lot closer lately, i think we may chill soemtime.. and the ashleys are a trip, i love them both... i have decided im going to give them all my number and force hem to spend time with me this summer.. i think those who i get long with in the class and i should meet up like once a week, or every couple of weeks, and just chill...</STRONG></FONT></P>

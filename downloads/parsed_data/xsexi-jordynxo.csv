"event","Wow people really suck, they like to ruin my whole weekend over stupid bullshit! Look get a fucking life...I shouldn't matter to you....I'm so sick of arguing with people and I want it to stop and if you don't like me good don't talk to me! Don't play it off like you do.If the people who didn't care left I'd have a alot more room for the people who do. The people who are just there treat me like shit amyways so I'm better off with out them.
 I have a question why does life seem to get better and then run it self off a cliff. Yesterday I was just fine, I was having fun until someone tried to ruin it. So maybe I'm better off just moving to a new school somewhere far where no one knows me.It seems as if no one over here would give to shits if I left. I know someone reading this will say I do but look, think about it for a minute..........
.
.
.

okay now do you really care? Didnt think so.. 


 Another thing I'm not tring to get attention by writing this I'm just saying what's on my mind because I don't like to speak my mind usually but I'm just about to blow up if I don't..But thanks to the people who really care and notice everyday because those people are really my friends.If you hate me don't talk to me don't think about me don't have anything to do with me or my exsictance I'd rather rot in hell then be friends with people who don't care about other people. They only care about themselves.Maybe you should think about that. Everytime someone says hi in the hallway to you they are probally also saying something under their breath or to someone else like man I hate them or something like that.
  I have something for everyone to do take like a few minute out of your day and just listen and observe how everyone is I'm not talking about your friends I'm talking about everyone, their everymove you'll see there are people out there who scream from the inside but don't get noticed they're ultimate dream might be to die and they would much rather not to be here then live here Because maybe your not always the ones making it horrible but your friends might be. Someone is making them not want to be here and to hate their life which no person should do. No person should want to die and hate their life. It's just not fair. I know what your thinking now well this girl is pyscho she's like tring to tell me it's my fault these peoeple hate themselves...NOT TRUE I'm telling you that these people feel this way because of someone and the way their treated and maybe you shuold instead of making fun of them or instead of treating them like shit say hi to them and really mean it. Don't care what others think about how loserish it would be to talk to someone different then you. I'm just so sick of how people treat other people. So just think about what I said maybe leave a few comments I don't care if you critisize what I just said or you say something else just dont tell me how you think I'm ugly or you think I'm discusting because look it dont really matter to me what you say. I don't care if you think I'm ugly if you do great don't look at me and don't talk to me keep it to yourself.


Well I'm done...I hope someone actually realizes what i just said...

"event","okay so last night and this whole weekend pretty much sucked i have nothing to do at all. well theres this person and i think i like him. But i know he doesnt like me liek that. and it kinda sucks cuz instead of drifting together were drifting apart and it sucks. Hmm omgsh i was up at like 4am this morning for no reason and i was wide awake. i got liek no sleep last night.prolly because i couldnt stop thinking about everything. It seems like it just keeps gettin worse.It all builds up inside of me and i go crazy and shit i think i have a problem or something, who knoes I wish i would know and i could get help. Because maybe the next time this happens ill do something sycotic and i wont be here anymore. But i get so nutas that I dont wanna be here and if your one of my close friends then you know what i did, well i did it again yesterday. Everyone always says my life Is fine and its great but its not. I mean yeah i dont get bea at home but still At school its like everyone hates me and shit after what i hear from these So CAlled friends. I mean my teachers dont even know my name always calling me something different most of the time when there passing out papers im right in front of them and they say oh shes in the other class or something liek that. It aint that hard to keep track of 50 students names. my gosh! so yeah And my mom hates me Always yelling like i can take it. and i have one bad grade and my faamily flips its liek im not gonna be perfect. I just wish I could go some place far away from here like with my dads family in canada. I just wanna go any place but here. BUt that wont happen so w.e i guess i can make my life last for a while until i can get away. who knows wtf is going on.... 

oh yeah and then i got theses guys who keep talkin to me like im not a person hello i am. Im not just some property you can do whatever you want with me. 



I just want someone to hold me.. cuz things dont look that great..."

"event","well hmm lifes great... not erally wtf is life anyways i mean some poelpe have a great one others it jsut sux whats the point. I mean your born you go through schooling which is either great or it sux. You have so much to worry about i mean first your grades keep them up so you dont fail second Is your friends, You could have kool ones and have a great time or you can be in a loser group and get picked on all the time. You have to worry what everyone thinks.after your done with 12 years of schooling. then you have a choice you can be nothing and work at a gay job with no money, and still be miserable. Or you have to go back to school for anywhere to like 1 yeahr to like 10 years of schooling and by time your done there you either find the one or you havent.If you ahvent then your 30 years old and have no children. But say you do find the one and your lets say 25 or 26 and you get pregnant(if your a woman) and you have a wonderful job and a wonderful house adn everythings great. well then what you have to raise a child to come into this world that sucks. OKay so now your gettin older and your about like 66(retiremnt age) well  if you dont have tht much money youll b working for the rest of your life. but after this long hard life time of working your ass off to havge cars and houses and shit liek tht well then you die. ALl tht hard work well it gets sold again and your stuck 6 feet under and thats all there is. So whats the point of it all?WHat happens if your nothing. liek you have bad grades and you dont get noticed by anyone then what then your just gonna live your life crying yourself to sleep. I think our lives are experiments and there testing the strong and the weak. But who knows. I maen if you really think about it whats the point?
 hm wow that was really scary i dont know where that came from.

but anyways its snowing and i hate today i have liek nothing to do and my best friend hates me for no reason and everyone else wont talk to me.. hmm i guess i should proly move somewhere else and these people here wont even notice im gone. Maybe then everyone would be happy.


Leave me something if you feel like it..."

Well Guess what I am I'm here foreal and I'm not going anywhere so either get along with me or fuck off!!! I'm tired of all this drama bullshit. It's fucking retarded I just wanna live.... I dont need your fucking shit. 


I'm prolly be single for awhile and I don't really care it's not my priority. I mean it would be nice to have someone to hold on too when I'm feeling down. When I'm feeling lonly someone to be around other then my friends. I just want someone that will be there for me and someone who actualy cares cuz every guy I've had either didn't care or was too busy for me....But I'm not gonna worry about it I'm gonna take *his* advice I'm not gonna rush for a relationship I'm gonna let it come to me if it's really suposed to be it will happen.. 


well I'm out

I want what's yours and i want what's mine,
I want you,

My uncle,aunt and me ended up watching the notebook its like one of the best movies ive seen in a while.but yeha i was thinking the whole time about who i actaully like and yeah i know. After teh movie it was like 130 am and i was tired not really but i went in my room and watched tv. And i got like 50 million calls tht night i was like mother fucker!!! lol jk

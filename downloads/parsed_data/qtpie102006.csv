<br>
i had a game tonight...we lost against stockbridge. again. i mean..i
dont really care if we win, i just hate being behind 30 points and like
having no chance at winning. the team just gives up and i feel bad for
them. i mean..i know they are still trying. but.&nbsp; idk.&nbsp; <br>
anyways..so me, aaron and kara went to eat at china king...then me and
aaron stayed and talked for awhile. it was good..until he threw chinese
food everywhere...lol. nah. it was fun. <br>
<br>
well..josh had refuge tonight. :( i saw him earlier today at davids
party. which was fun. but i could only stay for like 2 hours. he came
to my game tuesday...:D..he's great.<br>
<br>
kara got a car. its so cute...but she doesnt get her license for
another two weeks...which sucks. BUT..next sunday i will be able to
have people in my car...finally. the stupid 6 month thing is over! heck
yes.<br>
<br>
i signed up to take the ACT feb. 12.<br>

with a bad knee...one in hollywood? idk. we had 10 girls tonight
cheering. i dont even know whats going on? whatever. im tired of

<br>
well. ive been sorta busy the past few days. monday...school..my sisters chorus concert...<br>
<br>
tuesday...cheerleading at 6:45am. of course..i set my alarm clock
wrong. i hear my phone ringing..didnt want to pick it up cuz im like
asleep..then im thinking...why is my phone ringing so early? looked at
the clock. 6:45.&nbsp; went to look at who called...of course it was
the greatest guy ever, josh.&nbsp; i called him back. he helped me thru
my mild panic attack cuz i was like half asleep still and practice had
already started.. so i just went and took a shower, and got to practice
at like 7:30. school was alright...then we had a game against fayette
county. girls won, boys lost. like always. the boys tried hard
tho...just lost it in the end. :(&nbsp; <br>
<br>
today..school went by slowly as usual..i had a test in anatomy. i think
i did pretty good. review game in U.S. 1st place. oh yes. those bonus
points will help tomorrow. i went to kroger after school...then came
home..had some homework. and went to the nail place. that took forever
and i was late to church by about 20 min. but they had just started. so
it was alright. church was good...then like everyone went to shanes.
except for my my girls..kara and sarah. sad, too much homework. but
anyways shanes was fun...lol. all the guys are so funny. and the food
was really good tonight..i guess cuz i hadnt eatin since like 1. but it
was still great as usual.<br>
im really glad ive met all those guys and become good friends. :)<br>
they all went to see blade 3 tonight after shanes..but of course. i
couldnt go. but i think like 10 guys went...male bonding. thats always
good.<br>
<br>
aw i got a new purse tonight. jacob 'owed' me one from like 2 years
ago. and he got me a reversable one from aeropostale. its so cute...the
inside is green, and the outside is white. then u can flip it and i can
have a green purse. <br>
<br>
exams are coming up...:\. <br>
i have 2 games this weekend...at lovejoy friday night, and newnan saturday night. -sigh- <br>
i just remembered i have practice tomorrow....ugh..<br>
<br>

<P>well..today...school was boring...then i had cheerleading...layed in the tanning bed..and then i went to get some gas. over by kroger. i need to get my nails done really badly. they are like...ugh looking from the tanning bed. but i only have like&nbsp;2 more visits...so i figure ill get them done around friday. </P>
<P>i have all this reading i need to do for school...im behind on last weeks reading for fletchers class...and i have 4 more chapters to read for this week...so..thats about 100+ pages. due friday. i guess i'll read thursday night. the book is so unbelievably boring..and i fall asleep everytime i try to read it. <BR>i also have to read huckleberry finn for nettles class...that book isnt too bad tho...i have 4 chapters to read before friday. i'll read those either before or after church tomorrow. it shouldnt take long.<BR>i also have to say my story for spanish thursday or friday...ugh. this whole year ive been really good about doing things early so im not procrastinating. yeah. all that went down the drain about 2 weeks ago. im getting lazy. :/<BR>friday i have to wear my 'skeleton' shirt all day. its gonna suck...i have to get a paper signed every class period saying i wore it without wearing a jacket or sweatshirt over it....uuugh. <BR>we got our progress reports today...3 a's and 3 b's. not too bad i guess.</P>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993300 size=2>friday- school...then went to Golden Buddha with kara and her family.&nbsp; had some good food...took pics with buddha. lol..i have them on my computer if anyone wants to see....but anyways. i went home, got some clothes, then drove over to karas house and spent the night...we talked for a long time...i love talkin to kara. she understands pretty much everything i go through. and we go through a lot of the same stuff. so its good to have someone there to listen and understand completely. i can confide in her about anything..and i know it will stay between us only. i hope everyone has a friend like that. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993300 size=2>saturday- got up...we watched 'two weeks notice' then i went home cuz people were comin over to watch the uga game around 3. so&nbsp;i watched the game...played cards..i beat harrison in ping-pong. haha. me and sarah went thru some photos that mrs linda had....haha sarah. soo while we were lookin at photos i realized it was 6:30. which was bad. cuz i was gonna leave the house around 7 and go to Refuge to see josh play with kara and kristen. but i forgot to put my jeans in the dryer...cuz i did laundry that day. and i had to wait for them to dry..which means i didnt the leave house till about 7:45. and it started at 8..but i had wanted to get there a little early. oh well i guess.<BR></FONT></STRONG><STRONG><FONT color=#993300 size=2>Refuge was really good..and josh did a great job. he has an awesome voice... it was really fun. but i had to be home at 10:30 :(. so i talked for awhile and had to leave. went home... stayed on the phone till 4 in the morning.&nbsp; haha. its ok tho...very worth it. :) hehe</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993300 size=2>sunday- church. came home watched tv for awhile...josh, jacob and kristen came over around 4 and we watched the Falcons game and played ping-pong. but kristen had to leave at 6...which was sad.&nbsp; so we watched the rest of the falcons game..and played like 50 games of ping-pong.&nbsp; it was alotta fun...:) after jacob and josh left around 9..i was supposed to have talked to kara about something that was bothering her at church..but since i didnt go i met her and sarah at mcdonalds and we chatted a bit. and i hope things will be better....cuz i love u kara! *kisses* lol</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#993300 size=2>today- woke up around 10 and drove up to the school to do some newspaper stuff..which was pointless cuz i only layed out like 3 stories. but me and lindsey made clyde's picture for his review look good..pretty awesome talent right there. haha. but it was fun anyways. <BR>i went home...went to the movies with my mom and dad and we saw 'Ladder 49'. it was really good. i hated the ending. cuz it wasnt supposed to end like that. but it was still a good movie. ate at the Atlanta Bread Company...then we went shoppin at Ross and Kohls. i got some cute shirts and other stuff. stopped by Eckards on the way home....then beat my dad in ping-pong when i got home. haha. i beat him twice...and he beat me once. oh yes. soo now im here watching 7th heaven. </FONT></STRONG></P>

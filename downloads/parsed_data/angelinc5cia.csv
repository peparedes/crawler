"event","Im finally 17 and im so fucking happy that 18 will come sooner than later now!Last night me,Sandra and Monique hung out it was pretty fucking awsome.All we did was get fucked up though.Sean i think is mad because Monique told him to stop being rude or never to call me again.I started talking to Cody also so im kinda in a bind and i dont know who to pick.Im just fucking chilling right now with it all.Next weekend me and sandra are going to go to Monique's house and im going to tell sean to go over there.It should be pretty fucking funny.Cody is a sweet guy and Sean is not lol but im still fucking confused.On my birthday me and my family and Sandra went out to eat.It was Ok.But it wasnt all that fun.Tomorrow i gotta go to school and that fucking sucks balls.Oh well i hope the weekend comes pretty fucking fast cause im ready for it.Everyone that was in the hospital is out now and there doing Ok so i feel better about that.LMAO me and Sandra started crying last night for some stupid ass reason.She thought i was mad at her because i thought she was tryin to get Cody to think i like Sean more so she could hook up with him lol and that wasnt even what happend.But anyways she started crying because she thought i was mad at her.Lol then i started crying cause i was like I love you blah blah blah....lmao Monique was like ""what the hell is going on?"".omg THATS fuckin hell-arius well theres not much else to say .....Everything that has a begining has an end-Faith Durden

"event","Hmm... I havent written in here in a long motherfucking time! Alot of shit has happend since.Im a lil bit diffrent, but onlu my outlook on life.My cousin died and 10 days later his mom died.Both of overdoses, supposeably...both were prabably suicide.When you live with those kind of deamons, you just want to be taked away from all of the suffering.I think that has what made me feel things a little diffrently now.But all of that,Jafers mom is in the hospital,Dylan was in the hospital, for some reason all at once it feels like either someone is dead,dieing or sick.It fucking blows.But I dunno.Sandra and I are doing good we hang out all the time.Last weekend me and Katie hung out , and i went and picked up Sean.Hes so hot,and i dunno if were gonna go out or not,cause he wants to,but i dont know what will happen yet.Im afraid cause i have no time for anyone,i have lotz and lotz to do in my time.Sandra's the only lucky 1 that actually gets some of my time!So, i dont know if i can handle that right now.Aside of that, i went to school instead of homeschool. Its pretty Kool,Im actually doing shit and making it work.But, my sister will have her baby in December and shes havin another Boy so thats kool.I dunno what good to say is happening in my life besides that.But then again not much good ever greets me.I dont really hang out with jafer anymore because of his mom and school and work for him.But i love my friends, like today me and sandra went to Laura Data's house, shes so kool, i love her.I know some of my friends dont like her but I DO! lol well i dunno what else happend lemme think.I went to Ozzfest and it was kick ass! And tomorrow is my birthday so that is also kool!lol.I talked to monty a couple of weeks ago and hes workin at Gringo's in san leon.But hes hiring some1 for his boat.I dont know what went wrong there,and believe it or not he still believes were still gonna get married and all that bullshit.lol its not happening unfourtanitly hes 24 and still hasnt grown up.Im suppose to start 2 bands here soon.So that will be kool. 1 is already together called Absence of Angels and the other im forming.i dunno what the fuck else 2 say so i guess im out.Everything that has a begingin has an end-Faith Durden (Scary shadows of my past are alive-Lacuna coil)

"event","Its kinda late right now but i dont really sleep until the day time.Adam came back over at like 11 and he just barely left at 1:30 or so.lol he calls my window ""the secret window"" cause people come there late at night.right now im watching Bevis and Butthead,pretty intreging.Anyways i dont really know what im thinking about i guess im thinking about everything.Hmmmmm.......I might go back over to my other house tomorrow (Jay's house).Its pretty boring here.I really want to have another party with Agim,Feriz,Valintin,Monty and all them.But i think Monty wont be back for like 2 months.Hes fucking crazy,I love him and everything but i cant give him what he wants,not right now anyways.Hes the 2nd guy i've ever loved and i dont want to mess that up,but its too much for me to handle.I dont really know what to think or say about it.I kinda like Feriz right now for some reason and i have been thinking about it a little bit.I dont know if thats good or bad.I live in the world of darkness and i need someone who can take the burden enough to live in it with me.I have yet to find who that is.I hope i find them soon though sometimes i think i will never find it.Though its true that Adam has that burden as i do,maybe not in the same way but,I cant think of him like that again,i think its because he drowns himself in it the opposit way that i would.Its kinda weird how that happens.I really need to get my life together because 18 is cominng up kinda fast and i havent got nothing to show for it.Just alot of pain and heartache.I think the only time i was ever truely happy was with robby.And i know that thats dead and gone.So where do i turn to now,Monty,for a few years i thought that was the plan but now im not so sure.Im ready for my life to begin and i wish i had someone like me to share it with.I know there is more to life than this,what i am,who i've become,is nothing to what i thought i would be when i was 10 or 11.Who i am is a big turn around.I think there was always darkness and mysteriousness.But,i never knew it would go this far.I guess we all have destinys and who we are is actually set in our hearts before we even know it.....Live the day like its your last ....because it prabably is-Angel

"event","Today was a pretty boring day except Adam came over for the 1st time in like 2 months and me and Mat went to the movies,but we are hangin out alot hes like my best guy friend besides Jay.Hmmm...i used to have a dead journal but that expired and i cant get it again without a account number,so i guess i have to have a live one even though im not a very LIVE person.I guess i should right about mine and jays little ""Sex"" plan cause it seems to be interesting.I really think we both are stressed out and we need some relef ,so i decided to help him get laid for his 1st time and me well i got someone in mind and that someone is Feriz,lol i dont know why i think its because we made out at the party we had and it made me kinda like him a little bit.But its weird cause that is Montys cousin.Monty is makin me mad lately,cause he called and told me that we ARE gettin married and having a kid within the next year and it pissed me off cause i have now come to the conclusion that im WAY too young and WAY to wild.Not only that i have responsibilits i have to consume.But needless to say imma get Jay to have sex with Ann or Cherel,and imma get it on with Feriz.I think were in need or something.Anyways we used to hang out with Dylan alot but he is acting weird cause of his new girlfriend. but it happens.Anyways im talking to Adam on the phone right now. I dont like it when he talks about the people he hangs around cause they talk shit too much.lol but i guess that happens Lita went through it with my friends so i guess the whole Karma thing comes to mind.So what else,me and Jay are thinkin about goin to Numbers this week,but we dont really know who to take cause it would be weird for the albanians ,i think they would freak out,even though i would really like to take Feriz kind of a ..""forplay"" area.I dont really know though,school is goin to start soon for everyone but not me,cause imma got to home school,well i hope so anyways.If my dad dosent let me then im goin to drop out,and he might kick me out of the house but o well.Hmm..Robby came to my window the other  night telling me hes been thinkin about me alot and that he still loves me and we kissed and all that  but the next night he sent me a text message telling me that hes thankful for me talking to him but we shouldnt have kissed.I havent talked to him since.But it made me really upset because he brought back alot of old memorys.And i got depressed again,but im trying to deal with it,between seeing him again,and all of Monty's ""lets have a baby"" statments,everything suxx for me,again thats kinda why were on a sexcapade.I mean i dont know....for some reason i just feel like partying..getting drunk,smoking pot and messing around with a couple of guys seems to be the way i have been doing it lately.But the night calls to me everytime the sun sets.All my darkness had grown....To be a real hero,you have to give up the things you want most--Everything that has a begining has an end----fAITH dURDEN

"event","Well got back from the US last night.  On the way there the border people stopped me to check the kindereggs. It really freaked me out cause I had 3 bottles of Ma Huang (that diet suppliment) in my bag that I was sending off to some buyers in the states.  However all they looked at was the eggs...
Later to find out in the mall in GF that the stuff IS ILLEGAL now.  I wasn't sure if it was outright illegal anymore...but it is...I""m just lucky they didn't rip the car apart.
We stayed at the Ramada..which was nice.  Bought a gift set of cucumber melon stuff from Body and Bath works, A bunch of crazy cereals at target, canned cheese haha, and other bullshit you can't get in Canada.
We got back last night at 7ish.
This week I took work off Applebees to work respite.  So I expect it to be a somewhat tiring week...blah. Oh yeah we were in pacsun and got a great Paul Frank poster/wall promo. ITs mounted. This summer Dave and my posters are going in the back porch...so it will look cool. I like the monkey...weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"

"event","The paradox of our time in history is that 
we have taller buildings but shorter tempers,
wider freeways,but narrower viewpoints.
We spend more,but have less,
we buy more,but enjoy less.
We have bigger houses and smaller families,
more conveniences,but less time.
We have more degrees but less sense,
more knowledge,but less judgment,
more experts,yet more problems,
more medicine,but less wellness.
We drink too much,
smoke too much,
spend too recklessly,
laugh too little,
drive too fast,
get too angry,
stay up too late,
get up too tired,
read too little,
watchTV too much,and pray too seldom.
We have multiplied our possessions,but reduced our values.
We talk too much,love too seldom,and hate too often.
We've learned how to make a living,but not a life.
We've added years to life but not life to years,
We've been all the way to the moon and back,but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor.
We conquered outer space but not inner space.
We've done larger things,but not better things.
We've cleaned up the air,but polluted the soul. 
We've conquered the atom,but not our prejudice,
We write more,but learn less.
We plan more,but accomplish less.
We've learned to rush,but not to wait.
We build more computers to hold more information,to produce more copies than ever,but we communicate less and less.

These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion,big men and small character,steep profits and shallow relationships. 
These are the days of two incomes but more divorce,fancier houses,but broken homes.
These are days of quick trips,disposable diapers,throwaway morality,one night stands,overweight bodies,and pills that do everything from cheer,to,quiet,to kill.
It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom.
A time when technology can bring this letter to you,and a time when you can choose to share this insight,or to just hit delete.

Remember,spend some time with your loved ones,because they are not going to
be around forever.
Remember,say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe,because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. 
Remember to give a warm hug to the one next to you,because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.
Remember to say 'I love you' to your partner and your loved ones,but most of all,mean it.
A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.
Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment,for someday that person will not be there again.

Give time to love,give time to speak,and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath."

I didn't really get much pictures. We took photo booth ones but they sucked so we ripped them up. I just have a couple of him driving my car ...he took the pics of our painting ... so I won't see them until he's back. I got a shitload of Consolidated stuff...and a new dillinger 4 Live CD that was put out by LSD..it's really funny. 
Dave and I are thinking of going to Grand Forks on SUnday for the day. Leaving about 11ish and getting back whenever. We both have to work the next day and stuff. We will just go there to shop and get the hell outta the city for a day.

There hasn't been to much thats been happening in my life but I'll let ya know the highlights...

I know longer live in Haysi I moved to richlands a month ago, I LOVE living over here its great...whenever I get bored I just run to walmart or Goodies...Its great to only take 10 minutes to get to school instead of over an hour..

Student Government sucks this year its crap we haven't really done anything and to me its just a waste of time...but I'm take over President next semester and things are going to change.,. so i'm excited.

I""M SOOOO EXCITED....yesterday I got a call from the job I had been wanting for a while now....I AM NOW AN EMPLOYEE AT WAL-MART!!!!!! so everyone wish me luck...

I went to watch the Volleyball girls last night for there regional game...It made me want to play again sooo bad but its was great to get to watch a good game...HAYSI man they had to clue what COMMUNICATION meant last night. 

Right now I'm just procrastinating I don't want to finish my Western Civ report its just dumb and so is my teacher.

I'm going to Miami for spring break so i'm counting down the days!~! and I refuse to go until I lose the FRESHMAN 15   LOLOLOL\

It's sooooo good to be home!!! I got back to council yesterday and about got ran off the road so I knew it meant I was HOME...LOL
My trip home was VERY interesting!!!!
I got my very first TICKET...I cried!!!!    I was driving through Georgia and got pulled over on the interstate now that was scary, try slowing down to come to a stop when the people behind you are going like 85mph.  It was 86 in a 70 but I was sooo pissed off because the cop clocked the BMW that was in front of me but couldn't catch him so he pulled me over.....

Anyway just a quick update  i'm very happy to be home and see my friends and family..........hope to see everyone at the fair tonight

And to Ashley....I might be joining you back at the Breaks soon.......=(

I'm excited to be coming home in about a week, I miss everyone.  I think I've spent WAY to much time with Jeremys mom and dad they have drove me up the wall!!! Its hard to believe that summer is almost over and I have to go back to school but in a way i'm ready to go back, its going to be a hard but good year the most exciting part about going back is that i'm the Pres of SGA so I can boss everyone around...lol....  I didn't get to spend very much time with my family or friends before we left so i'm hoping that will change when I get home.  I'm excited about the fair just to get to see everyone and coming home to my new job so I hope things keep going great for me.....

The highlight of my summer was mine and Jeremys two year anniversary it was an amazing day!! and on the 28th of this month i'm having the Eye Surgery done!!!  =)
i'm soooo excited about it just because contacts SUCK and i'll be able to see better than i ever have.

My Birthday is in 4 DAYS!!!!   i'm getting old  

well thats about all for now I'm taking Jeremy out to eat for lunch.

Terry asked me one of my friends from college Kristin and one of her friends from Grundy if we would be interested in modeling at a studio in West Virginia.  Kristin and Jeremy talked me into it and I've never had more fun, I think I could get used to wind in my hair and camera flashes all around me were supposed to get our pictures wednesday!! can't wait to see them

Saturday was my first day back at work it was a good day kinda slow but was good to get back into the swing of things.  When I got home every bone in my legs hurt =( i'm so out of shape but it was Jeremy to the rescue he put lotion on my legs and feet and cooked me dinner hes so sweet

Sunday was surprisingly slow at work it kinda sucked at first because I found out that I was going to be the only one there that knew what they were doing but it ended up being good cause I got to tell ppl what to do.....lol......one person stands out in my mind more than others and shes knows who she is I truly think she will get her butt kicked by someone before the park closes.  Came home and laided around, Jeremy went to ride his dirtbike with AJ and mike so I finished up some homework and now I'm updating this

"event","My weekend was great!!  Jeremy had class Friday morning till 11:00 so I waited for him while doing work study hours then we were off to Atlanta to watch a Supercross race.  Over christmas break when we went to Florida I drove to the North Carolina welcome center that was bad enough considering I had never drove past Bristol well this time Jeremy made me drive all the way to Charlotte!!!!! (not fun) from now on I am putting a sign in the back window that says ""FOR ANYONE WHO RIDES MY ASS I WILL HIT MY BREAKS AND SUE YOUR ASS"" then maybe I won't get so nervous. The race was GREAT never thought it would be as much fun as it was.  Our seats were right in front of the finish line!! (Great Seats) well we left Sunday morning to come home!!

**I love snow days sooo much**
**No History and Biology in the same week =)**
**Searching for colleges in Florida is very tiring**
**Might have a job at Peebles!! if not Breaks here I come**
** Only 9 days and Spring Break in Florida here I come**
**I'm very proud of myself I have lost 6 pounds**
**Found a beautiful Prom dress yesterday but if I had the chance I don't think I would go back its very overrated especially if you have already graduated and the person isn't your boyfriend/girlfriend**
**Love all night pizza and games with mandie and josh**
**Ebay is soo much fun I think i'm getting my new D70 digital camera with 28-300 zoom lens i've found it on ebay for only 400.00 dollars its orginally 999.00**

Sadly I have to go back to school tomorrow being off 3 days as spoiled me!!

"event","This week has been great!!

Saturday morning at like 4 AM I head someone knocking on the front door, needless to say I was scared then all of a sudden I heard someone start walking around the house on the back porch so by that time I was trying to find a baseball bat so I yelled for Jeremy to see who it was then they started not knocking but beating on the door..........it ended up being Jeremys mom and dad and his brother (we didn't know they were coming in) well they scared the shit out of me. But we stayed at the house and hung out with them for a while and then went to see Jeremys papaw they found out the he has cancer again.......pray for him please

Sunday I got my NEW CAR!!!!! finally and just stayed around with his mom all day

Monday- his mom and dad left to take dustin back to Florida he was off monday but had to go back to school tuesday.  I went to college with Jeremy we decided not to go to history because 460 is STILL closed and we would have to come all the way back to haysi and then over to grundy and up some back road just to get to Twin Valley.

Tuesday- Went to school finished my speech to public speaking but found out the class was canceled so that made my day.....went to work out in the gym them to Small Business Management. Came home and had to go to Biology, there was only like 8 ppl left in the class cause everyone went to the game and he still made us stay until 8:40!!!! it was horrible then went to show nina my new car and see how things were with her.................Nina call me today I want to know what you said when I left last night!!

Wednesday- went to the gym this morning and getting ready to spend the rest of the day in the photo lab our deadline for the catalog is today..........and were not finished!!

"event","Happy Valentine's Day!!!!

This was the most WONDERFUL day I have ever had.....

I woke up and went In the kitchen to fix Jeremy his favorite breakfast laying on the table was 20 long stem roses!! They were beautiful the bottoms were yellow and the tops were tipped in orange I had never seen any like that before.  He also had roses petals all around them and a bottle of Hollister perfume, the most comfortable flip flop house shoes from old navy, bubbles, Strawberry Shortcake bag with cute little toys in it that made me fell like a kid again and Strawberry Shortcake stickers.  My favorite was the card he sent me!!  Jeremy had class that morning so as I was getting dressed there was a note laying on my dresser asking if i would check the mail he was expecting something so i left and went to the post office and he had left me another rose with a note in the mail box i left to hurry and meet him at the college we left and he took me to Red Lobster to eat and surprise the wait was only 20 minutes, but I found out that they had called someone else's last name and Jeremy pretended to be them.....but I dont mind at least I didn't have to wait an hour just to be seated!! We ran by the mall so I could get my hair cut (Johnson city mall is a great place to get your hair cut) came home and I had a surprise for Jeremy.....I had ballons all over the room each one of them had a secret message in them so he was only allowed to have 2 balloons, the balloons had hints about where his next present was...it was a blast but with all the candles and flower petals everywhere it was the most romantic day we have had!!



Since my last update it seems the just maybe some of my so called friends got the message but some didn't but I have now came to realize that life is very precious and to forget about the past and live for the future,  some people will always set around a wine about there life and how everything is so hard or that they can only be a friend and not a girlfriend but you only have one life so my advice is to live it and quit wondering ""what if""........

highlights during my week
* nina it was great being able to just hang out again even if it is the video store!! 
* Jeremy getting his mini bike......he going to get hurt racing yet I am now prepared
* Student Government planing out Valentines free food thing!!
* Jeremys baseball pratices........
* Praying for Jeremys poor brother that in my opinion    ""cannot drive"" 
* skipping biology for the homecoming game
****well thats about all i can remember........byebye"

"event","Today I come clean about what I think about this place and most Importantly the people in it.

Its bad enough that I can't walk into church or should I say splashdam church without feeling like the lowest person there.  But I left high school thinking I was still considered a friend to some people.  I don't think I have ever been more WRONG in my life. 

For the VERY FEW people that doesn't know that 3 weeks ago I was in a SERIOUS car accident, both Jeremy and I were hit head on by a car that was trying to pass a tractor trailer in a curve and they were drunk.  The passenger of the other car is dead and the driver is still in ICU so i'm very thankful to even alive.      But its very funny that over three weeks has went by and only TWO of my so called friends has called ME!!!! to see if i'm okay......hell not even a e-mail or a card from anyone HOW PATHETIC IS THAT!!!

Everyone I have ever talked to always told me that once you leave high school nothing will ever be the same, well I beg to differ because there was always that ""circle"" of people that had there head stuck up everyones ass and that ""circle"" will always be there to think there better than everyone and most importantly they will always be there to JUDGE each and every person they meet in there lives.  I will give credit to a few people although they were and still are in the ""circle"" they were nice enough to befriend people that were different from them or who wasn't as popular. Now that everyone has graduated and moved on in there own direction it seems they have forgotten what got them as far as they are now.....................and thats FRIENDSHIP.....and I mean true friendship....(not backstabbers that act like your friend)

Now that I have that off my chest I would just like to say to the people that called and checked on me (Rheannon, & Nina) THANKS........thats what a true friend is........"

"event","what a great day!!!  goverenment was good were watching Air Force One its been a while since i've watched it and its actully very good.  After class I went to Wally world I had to get stuff for our Senior trip and get shoes for ""Press Day"" got back and we had a game against Honaker today!!!!!! 

I wasn't looking forward to it cause everyone had made Honaker out to be the best, we got there and to my suprise I won my singles 7-5  *SMILES* and *MORE SMILES* Ashley came out and we had our ""moment"" she won as well, later Sabrina came over and told me I made the girl I played cry so that just made my day!!!  After she quit crying it was time for Sara and I to play doubles we were tied all the way to 4-4 then we won to make us 5-4 it was the last game and I was serving it was tied 30 all when Sara had a awsome hit to make us 40-30 the girl from Honaker hit the ball back and it was out which gave us the win   *SMILES* and of course Honaker couldn't believe we had beat them so they through a fit and called us liers but I didn't care we won fair!!!!  My sweetheart was their so he took me for ice cream afterward.  We ended up losing the complete game 4-5 but we sure gave them a run for there money...................Good Night Everyone!!!"

"event","Today started off awful I finally woke up still very tired, then my parents started yelling at me for something I didn't even know what it was over so i just went back to bed for a while.  Got to work and it wasn't any better i had one table that was nothing but RUDDE!!! but after they set at their table for 3 hours they ended up leaving me 16 bucks so i guess it was worth it.  I got off early so i went to see if my sweetheart was home about 10 minutes after i got to his house he came home...(SMILES)  and of course he hurt his foot again so i babyed him put biofreeze on his back and he was all better....came home and ate my favorite Spaghetti.  well that was my day hope yours was better.........only 17 days left of school!!!!!!!!!1   byebye"

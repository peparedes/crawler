"event","Things are calming down, and my sanity is slowly returning. A few weeks ago, Jess went into labor a month early. Now her C-section was scheduled for May 31st, so i had scheduled all of June off at work so that i could spend the first half of the month helping her, and the second half in Colorado, but no, life cant be that easy. so for the last few weeks ive been going crazy living at her apartment and trying to find help for her at nights while I was at work, and TRYING my damdest to still see Sean. Mind you, my mother had JUST left for a two week vacation in London, and My oldest sister was in the process of being evicted and forced back into our moms house, where she hasnt lived in for seven years... with her husband and three kids... in one room. My house has been a madhouse to say the least. In the middle of all this one good thing did happen ( other than the obvious new baby Zoe who turned out just fine ), I got my kitty back! Some bitch actually caught Baily. This was good, but also unfortunatly just another stress factor trying to find even more sitters so that I could get Baily to the vet and what not, getting her all back to normal. But she is doing great as well now. Jessica is starting to be able to handle things on her own now, so i am now back at my house where the insanity is just a little less than it was over there. David comes in on his two week leave on Thursday, so he can take over the whole daddy thing for a little while before he goes off to Iraq for a year. Throughout this whole thing, I have come to learn just how good of friends Kris and Jasmine really are to me. I would have probably been sent to the hospital for multiple heart attacks if it hadnt been for them :-) Did I mention Im not good with kids? er.. babies anyways. thats right, i'm getting my tubes tied whenever I can. woo, ive only been typing for five minutes and Ive rambeled way more than I meant to. Uhm, I saw star wars opening night, twas great, i now only have til Sunday at Sonic, then Im off till July 1st, woohoo! Now i have an entire month to relax. Lets see what life will try to throw at me then :-) Just kidding. Goodnight you or yall or myself."

She's lving in the gutters at the end of the street, but no one can catch her. hmm, Jessica's 3rd baby is due next month, i dropped my history class about two weeks ago but math is still going alright. ( oh yeah, im in college now, ACC, woot). uuuuhm... Im still at Sonic which is going alright, Sean and I are still doing good, I'll be going on my fourth trip to Colorado with him this June and I cannot wait! Between School, work, Jess and the kids, I am more than anxious to get away with my Kitty for a while. Just thinking about it makes me so happy. But yeah, thats pretty much all thats going on in my life, I'm sure I'll post again in a few days, weeks, or months.  I dont think anyone checks this out anymore but yeah. -peace-"

"event","Well, as ussual, its been a while. I have yet another nephew as of the 23rd of March (Robert Thomas McMicheal, 10 pds ). I dont know if I really have much else to say, but we shall see. I'm really bored right now and in a kind of awkward mellowed out mood. I've been feeling so lazy since Jessy moved away. I'm 18, out of school, without a job, and I live at home watching t.v. If it wasnt for sean, i'd feel almost completely useless. I really do need to get a job and stop relying on everybody else. I use Seans car to get me to and from his house, and if i want to do anything else, i have to hope that one of my 3-5 friends is available. I'm waiting to hear about this post office job that my mothers husband told me about. I know i should be out there getting applications, since the other one most likely wont work out, but I think I'm kind of scared. I like being a lazy spoiled brat and being able to spend as much time with Sean as I want. But at the same time, again, I hate being so god damned dependent on everyone else, like I'm everyone elses responsability. Ugh, i dont know. Pointless and bored rants really. I think I'll go read, not much else to do at 3 am. So yeah, Im out

But on our way , and ICE CREAM TRUCK drove by! i see them all the time down by my school but NEVER by my house, so sean and i got ice cream, drove down there, Jay took back over driving and we went inside to eat lots o' pizza and salad, and we watched Wheel of fortune. We play LOTS of games and got nearly 2,000 points!! Sean got a slinky and a black light lamp and we got 3 Huge plastic pixy stick tubes! (just so happens that i also got one today, how odd) and anyhoo we started heading home after a few hours and saw a shopping basket so we pushed eachother around for a bit and then ditched it in a random yard. Anyways, after all the pushing, we needed energy fixes so it was PIXY STICK time! num num nummy! Anyhoo... end of story really, i got way too hyper and Sean decided no more pixy stick for me. Hmm... Im about to go over there (hooray!!!) :-) okay, well my mind is overly hyper right now and im basically just trying to stay preoccupied with the computer until its time to go to Sean's house. perhaps i shall just go play some pool or somthing? anways, so sorry for rambeling, ta-ta!"

Winds howl harshly
quivering body in mid night
this silent language of grief is incessant
cringing, thrashing, convulsing
all adue my infamous torment
morbid contemplation
of a decievingly flawless life
anguish sinking fast
drowning,suffocating,perrished
churning into my eternal afternight
my dauntless heart has faded
and I am left undone
here to rot in my own quarry
here... in my own aftermath
lost among the many
I have bombed my OWN army
Became the enemy to many
and now stand stranded...
with one way out"

That is always good. I really cant wait till Im done with Highschool, but i just really dont want to have to deal with college and figuring out what i want to do with my life. People always say i have such a bright future... but it really is so dim, Im even dissapointing my parents lately becuase im not sticking with my original plan, but ya know ... fuck it. 
Anyways, David was ""analyzing"" me today outside with everyone there. He said that Im basically a person who doesnt complain but speaks her mind and otherwise just tries to stay nuetral with everyone. Everyone out there agreed and it just showed that they only know me half way. I mean, look at alot of my past entries in here, its filled with random bitchings of complete crap that no one wants to hear in the first place. Sometimes I miss being hateful. It was so much easier to just be able to look at the world so blindly and just hate so many things. There was definatly alot less drama becuase i just didnt give a fuck. But my blindfold was painfully torn off a few years ago, and now i just look at everyone as a friend in waiting. 
I dont know.. Im just bored... and you people ( all 2 or 3 of you) never respond anymore! C'mmon, respond with somthing.. even if its just telling me to shut the fuck up! :-P Love ya'll

"event","So uhm, yeah. I was walking down the hall past the library when this guy looks at me and says ""whats up?"" I was was just like uuuhm, not much. He gave me a hug and so i asked ""Do I know you?"" .. ""Oh yeah man, I'm AJ"" (i call him mummbling dude, cuz i couldnt understand him) so anyways .. Mummbley Dude: ya wanna ride wit' me?  Me: What? Mummbley dude: you wanna ride wit me to get some K.B.? me: uuuuhm... no .. thanx. So yea, I walk off down the hall to where Chad and some people were standing and tell them about him, just ya know, non-chalant conversation. And as I'm describing him he comes walking past us, and asks some other guy if he wants some KB. the guy looks at him funny then walks off. The guy walks outside  and Chad follows as mummbley dude continues harrassing some other chick. SOOO Chad gets his liscence plate number as the guy drives off, tells mr. watson, the guy comes back later, mr. watson bans him from this school, cuz apparently he graduated from here 3 years ago. So yea, later, the other girl (Tasha) her friend (Melissa), Chad and I have to talk to the cops becuase the mummbly dude continually tried to get Tasha in the car and just a bunch of BS. Cops scare me (eep) anyhoo, at the end of the meeting the cop informs us that he's gonna get tasha, and my adress, school id, phone number, and some other stuff from the school, this guy is gonna have a warrant and we are gonna be apart of the police report as witnesses. Blah, school is boring."

The weather is quite unkind today but i dont care, id rather be inside asleep. Id rather just shut down my mind and let everything go. I want to pretend that certain things never happened and I want everything to make sence again. I learned that eventually everything disappears .. eventually.. everything and everyone. I learned that its okay to have people hate me, even if i'll never be able to hate them. I learned that I shouldnt be so jealous and I should just let people have fun who want to have fun, with or without me. I learned that People really do just come and go and that the best acting is the acting that goes on everyday with everyone we know. The truth is you never really do know whats going on inside another persons head, no matter how well you know them.  I learned that I  ... I dont know."

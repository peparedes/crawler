OH! and yes, we got report cards today, he worst ones yet. 3 A's 1 B and 2 C's. ohhhhh well. so the ride from school today was fun, we were jamming out in m car man. haha. i had to get home and change to go to swim with Ash. we had a hot dog for lunch! woohoo. swim was awesome! coach brahman told me to go in the front of the line cause i was a faster one. oh yeah go jas! my legs were dead at the end of practice, but nothing i'll get into. everything after swim well... let's just call it RANDOM! holy crap i looooooooooooove Ash. we had so much fun after swim. so... we saw Sara (not my lover, another Sara, lol, Paul's sister and i, once again being random, intro'd myself and made a complete ass out of it. it was peachy. anyways, so we see Paul (Ash's asshole Ex) pull up in his daddy's range rover. I was like holy crap Ash, we've got to follow him, so we did. i was going 50 down the library streets and had to slam on my brakes in order not to hit the kid! geez. that was fun stuff, my tires drifted... fun fun. so we decide to go right behind this kids ass and when we were stopped at Paseo Verde i did my Chinese fire drill!!!!!! it was hilarious! everyone was staring, fun fun. and i think i embarrassed Ash a little, haha, i know she didn't mind. Wow does this paul kid drive sloooooow. even slower than my folks. wow. blah blah blah, we just went on our way and ignored him the rest of the way. When we were stopped on St. Rose, some asshole tried to race me, but i idn't go for it. bad mistake on his part. this shit was going AT LEAST 70 on St. Rose. Yeah, try imagining being able to make a dead stop within like 2 seconds of time. this retard hit another car, totally T-boned. HOLY HELL this dood was only 2 lanes away from me!!!! when that was all over me and Ash went hysterical! we were terrified, next thing i knew i wasnt going over 30. dead scared. then on Maryland prwy. some other retard went into oncoming traffic. um...hulloh... just in case you didn't know... thats a hige NO NO. lol anyways....... i dropped off Ash at her house after our amazing 15 minute drive. lol i love that girl... we let Sara (yes, this time it's my lover. haha)and Gab know about everything, and i think we got them scared shitless too. hehe. blah blah hw. blah blah food. at 6ish i went to Kay's to hang out. i had a terrific dinner. complements to the chef. and then we just hung out, that girl is awesome, she always makes me laugh. we talked about our trip that we're gonna take to Tokyo in 2 years, no matter what our folks say. OMG I CAN'T WAIT. ohhhh and i finally found the song i was obsessed over the other day. it's called, well i don't know what it's called. anyways ts byt this guy named Jin, some rapper dood. holy crap i looooove it. haha.

"event","Why hello there. You can say this past week has been very dramatic. I honestly hope people can get over this ""causing drama for no shit reason"". It's really starting to bother me. Well Gab's bf's in town and I feel really alone. Some dude comes into town for 10 days, and I get thrown aside, like I was nothing but a rag doll. I mean I know I'm not the best friend, or best person for that matter, but at least have a good reason to ditch me at a concert that we've had planned for a few weeks now. Ok, that's hopefully out of my system. Holy poop! Yellowcard's in town in 3 FREAKING days! I'm so excited. I can't wait to have a great time with Ashley, she is such a sweet girl. I'm also hoping that Sara can get her mom to let her go again. It would be tons of fun. AHHHH can't wait. The only bad thing I guess, is that I'm gonna have to drive there, oh well. I'll be blasting the music in my car. WOOHOO! I need to start concentrating in school again. My grades are beginning to slip, 'cause of my procrastination problem. I really wish I could stop doing that, but who knows maybe I'll get some sense knocked into me. So next week is homecoming week. I'm honestly gonna make an ass out of myself. For superhero day, I'm gonna be Quailman!! All i need now is my trusty Porkchop. Ramadan's in 3 days, can't wait to lose the weight! Oh yeah, go Jas. Byeeeee."

"event","I think I'm beginning to get this whole updating frequently kind of thing. So if you all haven't noticed already, i pierced my lip again. I know. It's nifty. I had this huge craving to do it last night at about 11:30 while everyone was asleep. It was so euphoric, no one would ever understand. I didn't feel a single sheer of pain. I'm glad too, 'cause I can't exactly handle pain, blodd too for that matter. I found that out the hard way. Earlier in the day I accidentally lstepped on a wire in the garage. the wire dug 2 inches into my heel. I began bleeding profusely, I couldn't help it, i began to fel very queasy and dizzy. I toppled over. There goes my dream of ever becoming a doctor. Now I can't even play DDR let alone walk. At school I got so much critisism on my lip. I hated it. I wish everyone would've just left me alone. I also gave Randy my awesome CB wallscroll. It was such a waste that there wasn't any room in my room. I know it has gone on to a far better place with Randy. haha. Now my lip is swelling up. Ouch. I hope it doesn't get infected. In the meanwhiles I took it out of my lip. I'm hoping that later on I can go and buy a hoop. SHIT I've got tons of homework to do. I'm afraid that this year I'm going to be so drained. K, well I'm out."

"event","It's been a while since I've writtne in this thing. i guess there's a lot to say, but then again there isn't. I dont know how to explain it. This week school has been taking up a lot of my free time. I have about  3 or 4 clubs that I'm doing this year. At least im not going to be doing any sports this year. The whole softball team at school is rigged. For all I care, they can just sit on my damn finger and rotate. It never meant too much to me anyway. My social side isn't really doing me all that justice so far. Nothing's new with the friends. Glad to hear that all my X-country friends are doing great. I'm proud of all of you guys. Gabby's finally cutting her hair. Just same 'ol junk. The weekends suck too. I think the only thing that actually gets me going is playing DDR with Gabby. I have to admit that it's an awesome game. I'm hooked. Great stuff. My life's a little depressing right now. I need some uplifting, something to get me off on my natural high I guess. Oh well I can't really do much about it can I. Ok if I keep blabbing I'm just gonna bore everyone out of their minds. Adios kids."

"event","<P>Wow, i haven't written in this thing in about 2 months. i have a lot to say. this summer hasnt exactly been the best, but on the other hand it hasnt been too bad either. haven't gone anywhere since my week in mexico 2+ months ago. oh well. soooooo, i guess for everyone who hasnt seen me since school, expect a whole entire different look. jet black hair with platinum blonde tips. haha. i know doenst fit me does it? you can also add some black framed glasses and a lip ring to that look. yeah, can't wait to see everyone else too. am i the only one nervous for school to start again?? its insane! this summer has been WAY too short. but hey on the plus side, i wont have to ride the goddamn bus again. i finally have my own car!! thank god. its&nbsp;a 97 silver honda civic. pretty nifty car if i do say so myself. :). lol. so this year i have to drag along my brother Kareem. he's a cool kid so i dont have too much to worry about. pain in the ass, but still cool. ANYONE INTERESTED IN POMERANIAN PUPS? we have 3 girls, white, brown, and a grey. interested then call me, you should all know my number. umm thats about the gist of it, so i guess comment if you want. also, i'd like to apologize to the people who i was a bitch too. i love you all.</P>"

"event","This is a classic BR quote. Wow I loved that book, not to mention the movie. So I guess you can say that this is my first real ""journal"" entry. Oh, there I said it already! So what is there to say about my summer so far. Umm, i don't think it's been too great. Nothing extra special. Promises were made and broken, thats about it. haha. OH! So I got my lip pierced! ha! Everyone I know, freaked! I think it adds to a  new look, black hair and red tips'll do that to you. So today I test drove my new car, well that is it'll be my new car once i find a job. Its the 2004 Jeep Liberty. Gorgeous, Gorgeous car. Wow can't wait 'til it's all mine. OH! FOR ALL YOU OUT THERE WHO KNOW WHAT BR IS... have you ever imagined what it'd be like to actually live that horrific situation? OH!, I did. it was so amazing! haha. i know, go figure but i went berserk on everyone cause i thought everyone was out to get me. but it was insane i mean it was EXACTLY LIKE THE BOOK. whoa ok im over it now...umm other than that not too much goin on in life. umm sorry about the randomness, haha. So post a comment!"

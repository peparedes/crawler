"event","Hey all... a short update here for the public. Just to let everyone know, I did win the tournament at Dragon*Con, with my beautiful girlfriend Nikki there cheering me on during the last hour and a half :-) Also, I'm starting a band, <i>Allowance of Hate</i>, which is gonna be kinda metal/industrial... I have great aspirations for us! We don't have a site yet, but we will soon... Already we have a lead singer and bassist (me) and a guitarist, and we're looking for a drummer and possibly one or two back-up singers. If you're interested, drop me an e-mail: my addresses are listed in my LiveJournal user information. Lastly, I'm still running Nano-Scopic Technologies - if anyone needs any software developed for their personal use or for a small business, contact me. I design programs in C++, C, and VB6.

Some people may have noticed, some may not have, that my journal is now on friends only. The reason for this is that some people have been reading my journal, and they are people from my past that I would be best to forget and move on from.  Why these people tried to find my new journal or have anything to do with me, I don't know, nor do I wish to know. Either way, it is the simplest and easiest solution for me to just make my journal accessible to friends only. If you're not on my friends list, and would like to be, leave a comment on this journal with your name/information (if I don't know you already) and I'll more than likely add you. If you're a non-LJ-user reader, then leave a comment with your name and contact information (once again, only if I don't already know you) and I'll see about hooking you up with an LJ code so that you can start your own journal <i>and</i> read mine.

Dragon out.

Everybody, this guy beat PsychoStriker, who if you recall, was the only person capable of beating Matt McCoy, our Champion for five years. This guy beat Psycho by a 20 point lead in the FragFest tournament, and to top it all off, he has a girlfriend, who was there cheering him on! A life, a good-looking girlfriend, and he's leet!

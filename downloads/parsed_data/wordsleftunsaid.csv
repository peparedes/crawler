People need to learn that if you're drunk off your ass making a fool out of yourself, you're going to get picked on.  That simple.  Don't flip out and get all paranoid and pissed.  I'm a nice person, I just enjoy expressing what I think about people and i'll tell them straight to their faces.  Is that so bad?  I don't think so.  But other people do.. ah well.

And I feel terrific about knocking some kid in the face.  Especially when he wishes death upon my son.  Grant it, it was awhile ago but I never showed him what I thought about it and him.  And pushing my sister only makes it worse haha.  I think it's hilarious, and anyone that wants to hate me and be pissed off can go stick their thumbs up their asses and go on thinking their awesome.

I hate doing this to myself, but I guess life comes with a lot of stupid shit like this, and they are just life lessons.  I hate it.  Why can't everything be certain, why can't you just know things like this right off the bat. 


  Tomorrow is going to suck.  I have to go in and get pre-cancerous cells destroyed, and I have no idea if it's going to hurt or not.  But it's something that has to be done or else things can progress into much serious matters.  My life is full of fucking surprises and let downs.  I wonder when things will start looking up for me. I really hope soon.

 So I guess i'm just going to go ahead and get my GED.  I'm 18 and too far behind to even graduate this year.  I rather just get my GED get started with college and get a career going.  I deserve that, and so does Connor.  He deserves every good thing.  I want to give him a life that he will never regret.  I want to give him happiness and joy.


 I want happiness too.  In a romantic sort of way.  Haha, gay.  But it's true, i'm sure it's what every girl wants though.  I'm still young, but mentally i'm old.  I really want a stable relationship, somebody to look after me (just me, Connor has a father) I want someone that will at least accept the fact that I have a son, by another person.  I want someone that will accept Connor, as a person. GOD i'm so gay.

"event","A hippie gets onto a bus and sits next to a nun in the front seat. The hippie looks over and asks the nun if she would have sex with him. The nun surprised by the question politely declines and gets off the at the next stop.

When the bus starts on it's way the driver says to the hippie, ""I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you."" The hippie says that he'd love to know, so the bus driver tells him that every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery and prays to God. ""If you went dressed in a robe and glow in the dark paint mask she would think you are God and you could command her to have sex with you.""

The hippie decides this is a great idea, so that Tuesday he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun to show up. At midnight sure enough the nun shows up and begins praying the hippie jumped out from hiding and says. ""I AM GOD! I have heard your prayers and I will answer them, BUT ... first you must have sex with me."" The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity because she is married to the church. The hippie agrees to this and has his way with the nun.


 After the hippie finishes he stands up and rips off the mask and shouts,""Ha! Ha! Ha! I'm the hippie!!""

Then the nun jumps up and shouts, ""Ha! Ha! Ha! I'm the bus driver!!"""

If i'm your friend and I love you dearly, i'm the nicest person you could ever meet, I'd do anything for you.   But somehow my friends don't consider that and just use me, well, I feel like i'm being used.  But how can I not.  I take people to work without hesitation I run people around all over because they're drunk and i'm the pregnant sober one, a good reason to have me around, eh?  It's like all my friends do is disrespect me. ( not saying i have never disrespected any of you) with the exception of maybe 1 or 2 friends.  It's like they're thinking ""Oh she's the young pregnant one, we wont take her feelings into consideration, all she has to worry about is her baby, poor little girl.""  I may be young and pregnant, but im not stupid, I see what goes on around me I hear things that shouldn't (but do,cause well hey, im pregnant) hurt my feelings.  I wonder what people will do when im not pregnant.

Another thing that has me upset, which I don't know why is when people call me ""the pregnant one"" or ""mom"" or whatever name that implies that im a pregnant loser.  It just upsets me incredibly, like I dont already know that im pregnant, like i dont already know im going to be a mom.  I know they're not doing it to upset me.  But it makes me feel like i have to grow up even faster than what I have.   I try to have fun when I hang out, but i just get so bummed about everything,  no one wants to come sit by me and have fun uplifting conversations with me.  Everytime I go hang out i just get upset.  

I just don't know if i'm ready for this whole parenting thing.  I mean i have no choice, connor will be here anytime now.  But I was in a relationship since i was 14, with the same guy.  And by the time i had the guts to cut it off with him I was already pregnant.  Honestly, i dont think i'll ever be in a relationship again, at least not til im 30 because lets face it, who wants to be with a pregnant chick, or a girl that has a kid?  Maybe when i move away i might find someone that makes me happy and will except the fact that i have a kid with another, and not take it like i want them to be the father.   Just maybe I will.   

I dont know, im just babbling now, and im extremely upset.  I didn't mean to make people feel bad or guilty (if anyone even read this)  I just had to get it off my cest before i exploded."

It's quite possibly the hardest thing I have to do.  To sit here and try not to give a shit anymore, to let people make their choices, good or bad.  But at least I now know who my true friends are and who  I can rely on.  It's sad though, to know that a person you've been friends with for longer than 5 years and dated for 2-3 years.. if that 3rd year even ment anything.  And did anything for just totally up and blew you away, like you were nothing to them.  And being pregnant with their child doesn't make the situation better.  But like I said, i'm just going to sit back and keep myself or at least try to keep myself from being stressed, from thinking too much negativity.  For me and my son.

He can go right ahead, i'm just not going to communicate with him until our son is born and to get my money, but I have people that can do that for me.  Unless he hits a growth spurt and becomes a man.  I doubt it though.  I just wish people would understand.   ..  i probably shouldn't say what i was going to say, just to keep me from stressing.  OOHH but how I want to.  

Could people make a promise to themselves to stay out of MY business, and MY business is my son, my problems, and whatever brandon has to say about me.  I would really appreciate it.  And if you hate me why would you want to get into my business anyway?  I tell my close CLOSE friends my problems.  But they don't get involved, the tell me that everything will work out for the better, they don't try to stick their nose in my business, they respect that.  And i think everyone should.  This is between me and brandon.  Not you amanda, not you jason.  Just stay out of it.  You have your OWN kids to worrry about.  Don't get into my life and believe everything you hear, cause we live in a town that likes to lie and start a lot of shit.  And not everything you hear out there is true. 




If you have problems with what I have just said, tell me.  Don't run off and tell everyone else and tell lies.  DONT assume things cause you heard it from this person who heard it from who the fuck ever.  thanks."

"event","MY sins are being accounted for.  You know, i'm not perfect I have made plenty of mistakes in my day, and more are yet to come.  But at least I can admit it.  Being pregnant with someones kid that completely ignores you and hangs out CONSTANTLY with a girl that happened to be my friend, who also HAS A KID OF HER OWN, really really sucks.  I could care less if Amanda wasn't my friend.  If he went after someone else who was kid free and didn't ignore me or spend ANY time with me.  I would be fine and dandy.  HE makes me look like i'm such a piece of shit.  I'm not hanging out with or have feelings for any of his friends.  You guys are so commited to this rule that a guys ex can't date any of their friends.  But they can date the exes friends.  What the fuck?  I'm sorry, but I find this wrong.  And really heart breaking, ESPECIALLY to see the father of my child bring a toy over for someone elses kid, knowing that he only bought ONE..ONE thing for his own. RIGHT in front of me, gave it to her RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  I wanted to die right then and there.  Why am I the one getting shit on, why does everyone believe everything that comes out of Brandons mouth?  I've said a few choice words to Brandon, things like ""I hate you"" or ""You're a piece of shit""  but nothing like he is saying.  Like i'm going to keep him from seeing his son.  PLEASE.  I grew up without a dad, I wouldn't put my child through the pain I went through and still going through.  It's just not fair.  I want Brandon to be a part of the pregnancy, but it's hard for me to know that he has feelings for MY friend (grant it, shes not much of a friend now) who has a kid and rather hang out with her than me.  It's not fair AT ALL that I have to sit here alone, knowing my babys father is not around.  He got me pregnant.. and now hes not around.   IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.  You guys can hate me all you want, but I know what I see, I know what I hear.  Call me liar, call me a hypocrite.. whatever. You people don't know me enough to tell me my sins are being accounted for.  You people don't know Brandon enough to think he is a truthful stand-up guy.  I understand hes a friend to people.  But what I say to Brandon, what I say about Brandon to the people I trust.  Should be between Brandon and I, and those view trustworthy people and I.  

If certain people can't at least UNDERSTAND my point of view, stay out of it. PLEASE."

It would be better if you guys just told me the truth.. and prove how good of a friend you weren't.. and just to make my point bigger about YOU being a moron.  And I don't want you in the delivery room because I feel there should be trust  between the people in the room and me, there should be love thats unbelievably stong and commited.  And to tell you the truth I get that more from the doctors and nurses already more than I get it from you.  It's not like I don't want you in there for our baby, I don't want you in there because of me.  It will be about me for a while, the pain, the irritablity.. and you will probably just put me in more pain.  You can see him the second they clean him up and wrap him up.  Just not as soon as I do.  

You have a lot of growing up to do, and im not saying that I don't need too.  I do.   But you seem to still be stuck in that immature 16 year old body.  You think you don't have to go through this pregnancy with me.   You were involved in the process of making this baby. I think you should be here in the process of the development of this baby and watch it grow in me.  Feel him move.  See how happy he makes me.  Instead your with her, and her child.. your giving her child stuffed animals infront of me.  Not many people would think that is a big deal.  But it hurts me a lot.   You choose to be with her over the mother of your child.  And that distrubes me.. incredibly.  It makes me sick.  And if you continue this much longer.   I don't want you in MY life ever again.  The only communication will have between each other is this baby.  That's it.  No relationship, no friendship.. n o t h i n g.  And if thats the way you want it, you'll continue this childish act.  I have a feeling that you will.   so goodbye."

I will do it on here.  For one, if you dont want people talking shit on the internet, shut the hell up.  For two, and probably about the billionth time, GOSHEN GIRLS, DO NOT HATE ""OTHER"" or ""NEW"" GIRLS JUST BECAUSE THEY AREN'T FROM GOSHEN OR THEY'RE NEW.

(sorry alicia, but you conffuuuusee me.) anyway, what are we supposed to think,  thats ONE reason, the other reason is, you guys don't understand that being a slut and sleeping with people one day after another isn't a very SMART thing to do neither is sleeping with the same people your friends slept with, deny that shit all you want , we know its true. You disrespect yourselves and make us look like we're in the wrong for thinking of you in such ways, when you and everyone else knows that you people are just being slutty.

"event","I've came to the conclusion that I am no longer hanging out with the same people anymore.. well there is an exception with a few, like Meagan, Brandon, Joe, and Niki.. and of course those of you I don't see on a regular basis.

You're asking yourself why.  Well, I see how my ""close"" friends react when ""new"" people come along, not the kind of friends I want.  
Yes I did something stupid, buttt uhh helllooo,  I can name off millions of things you guys did, that was hell of a lot more stupid then what I did,( me being a good friend that i am, i didn't give you shit at all, like you did me and i didn't send people over to your territory and start yelling and trying to be a stuck up bitch, now did i?) but i wont name off any of those incredibly smart manuvers you guys pulld off.  So after you guys get your heads out of the dumb broads asses, wait nevermind, I dont want any sort of social relations with you assholes.   

have fun with your totally cool friends.

byebye now.


that was a little cheesy, but its the truth."

"event","So, I just got called stupid.. buy someone who is supposed to care about me.  My brother, fuck him.  He's telling me what I should do with my money, how I should by a car, why me moving to florida in a year isn't going to work.  Excuse me, you only think you're looking out for me,  ever since dad died, i've been looking out for myself.  Yea, I have put myself in some bad situations, but I managed fine, BY MYSELF.  If you want to look out for me, look out for me the right way.  Don't tell me how to live my life."

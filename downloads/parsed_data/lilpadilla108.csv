"event","Well today I woke up around 10 or so to crystal screaming shoot!! because she remembered that it was her best friends b-day party and so she was running around getting ready and stuff, and then when she left i fell back asleep. Then around 12-1 me and Elicia woke up and went home. Then me and Elicia sat in my living room for a couple hours talking. And then I got online for a lil while and talked to justin and found out everything was kool between us. Finally I got ready and went to my horse lessos. There I learned how to post three differnent ways... and man im sore!! That sure was a work out to the butt! haha anyways I guess im gonna go love you bye bye!"

"event","After the party Justin tells me that he has been lying to me since day one.. that hurt so much to know. then we got in a huge arguement about him smoking pot and lying to me and me giving him a second chance and stupid me giving into everybody, gave him a second chance...but i love him so much i cant not give him another chance... now im over here with elicia nad crystal feeling so stupid because they automatically think there cool because they smoke dan dididnt... i dunno hard to explain maybe it's just me being selfish, although me and elicia promised eachother we'd go through everything together.... but people have been lying to me and making life worse for me alot latley. so im very use to it... egh i seriously think killing myself would make things so much better! but i wont considering i love my mom and dad more then i love myself.. and i love my friend so much even if they have been being jerks to me latley. their only human...i guess. and i would  rather have them be happy then me well i guess i will go and be depressed even more.hopefully my confusion and stress-wears-off.-well-goodnight and wish me luck i guess...

"event","Well... today I woke up at 3:00pm and got in the shower and did the dishes. Yippy. Then I talked to everyone that was going to the party, and figure out how I was getting there. Then I got ready, and went with Elicia to Rite Aid (She got to drive because she got her permit). After that we went to Crystal's party and we sat on the trapoline and talked to people, and got to know people. Then Josh showed up and had some pot and Justin had some to and he got all my best friends high.... I never took the hit because I care about all my friends and I would never want to get in trouble or have one of my friends get in trouble. so i stayed sober so I could back them up, and they have no idea why I didn't do it with them. All they know is that I was being a pussy and chickened out... they asked if I would be mad if they did it but stupid me said no it's fine. damnit I feel so stupid right now because I'm staying the night at Crystal's house, and they are explaing everything that happened when they were high and saying how it felt. I feel like a dumb ass. egh man..."

-Elicia's problems
-Misquitos bites all over my body
-me being grounded
-Me not being able to tell my sister anything without her preeching to me
-cold sore on my mouth
-period

so lately things have been ehhh. I wish i could just move away somewhere and start all over. Not becuase so many people hate me or make fun of me or somthing (even though there is a lot of people who dont like me...many with no reasoning.)but because im unhappy with eveyrthing here. Lately, my friends dont seem exactly like they used to, which ive been bummed out about for a while now. And if they ever read this than they probably wouldnt help fix things, or make it better, but instead im willing to guess they would talk amongst themselves(without me) about how im being gay or somthing. Ugh. whatever. One of my friends, i dont want to mention names, i have been best friends with since like..what? 6th grade..and its seems like shes sort of ""drifting"" away..i dont know if she realizes it or not. But i do, and even other people have mentioned somthing to me about it..i duno, maybe she just doesnt care as much as i do, or thought she did?..it sucks either way.
:(
also, i confessed somthing to somebody which i sort of wish i hadent said. Not because it wasnt true, but because i think they dont want to talk to me or hangout with me anymore, or as much. I hope thats not the case and they are just busy right now or somthing..ha. Well i do hope. I can be fine with the fact that they didnt think what i thoguht...but i still want to be able to hangout with them and talk to them. I would miss it if i couldnt. But what else can i do...

I wanted to tell mike thanks for the cd's...i loved them. And i hope you liked the ones i made for you... ha. A couple of my favorite bands i gave you. Yeah yeah.. even though i was thinking haha...that had ot be one of the gayest looking things ever in the hallway the other day, when we like swapped ziploc baggies. lol..if i was someone else(other than me and u, cuz we were involved in it) i woudl have been like what the hell? haha, and laughed about it. Oh well. -thanks!

i am goiing to end this here i think, because the last paragraph got me in a sort of more ""chipper"" mood..they say its good to ""end on a good note"".


And that ill do.."

I mean, i can go on and on and on about stuff, soo much goes on here but i feel like when i write it out, it sounds like some big sob story or something.I dont want my journal entries to turn into like a book of a cry for help. The last thing i need is like someone to tell me i need help ha. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Yesterday i came home from school and got literally attacked by my parents. I hads no clue what-so-ever what the hell was going on and i walk in the door to be left speechless. My little brother did somthing and my parents like drilled me about it and i didnt know what it even was. They want to tell me how much i disrespect them all the time, and how i dont love them, and whatever else comes into my moms fucking mind...well i think i have a right to think what i think about them, and feel how i feel. They arent exactly the best parents towards us. Half the stuff they do or have they hide from us because of some odd reason..well wtf. So yeah my mom was like yelling at me and bringing up all this shit that has by far passed already,and saying how much me and my sisters and brothers make her life so hard, and how she ""fucking hates us kids for the things we do to her""..well none of us asked to be brought here. And half the time she makes me feel like i should just leave here, because she obviously wants nothing to do with me. She thinks we put her through so much and she is SUCH a hypocrit for saying that. She wasnt exactly the best mom towards us, i mean if she thinks leaving us when we were kids with my dad while she goes and falls in love with my step dad (not that i dont love him)is being a good mom..i dont even know. I spent more than half of last night in my room crying because of everything she said to me and then she tells me to fold laundry. Isnt it bad enough for her to see how much pain she like puts me through so often with the thingds she says.. and then she wants me to FOLD laundry! fucking crazy. She has the nerve to ask me whats wrong to top it off. I coudlnt tell her what goiing through my mind..i just said eveyrthing. Which it basically is everything because nothing lately is good for me..</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=1>FYI-I think i liike someone. haha. Well i do, but i dont know if its worth it because they always seem to think i dont. I dont know, i guess im just lucking out on a lot of things lately huh... i love it </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=1>I just want to tell you, mike, that even though we dont talk a lot lately, i still love talking to you when we do. You are sucha great friend and you always help me see things better.

"event","wow...ao many things have changed so much this past year. I didnt even realize it until i thought about everything that went on. Not only over the whole year, but just in the last 6 months i think i have become sort of a different person maybe. A lot of problems and harder times, old and new friendships, situations and other things have helped me realize more who i am maybe? and also made me realize who my friends are/arent and so much more. It really all just sounds kinda corny but in a way or two i think its right. 
 Since january of last year, well alllooott has happened. Starting with friends..my whole group of friends hasnt totally shifted, but all in all..i have started hanging out with different people than before, and to say that im having fun and not upset about the changes totally..it cant be a bad thing..it doesnt feel bad either. There are times maybe once in a while when im not too happy with all of my friends and stuff that goes on with us, or them, or me even..who knows. well, people change.
 Family..well i dont know for sure what goes on there, it changes often hah. But right now i guess its alright..better than it was a few months ago..or even one month ago. A few of you know what has been goiing on in ""the family"" or what did happen,and i think maybe if you knew, that u could tell a little difference in how things with my parents are now. I mean they arent great like id like, but i dont really care right now because thats only like the 4th thing mostly on my mind lately..and the first 3 are probably driving me crazy enough..
 


Well besides all that crap up there and more i didnt bother to talk about..New Years was a blast. haha it was actually very awesome...
My stepbrothers friend(Jeff)had a party and we went over there. We got goiing at like..i dont even know.. but by like 1 a.m., everyone was passsed the fuck out. It was great. even though everyone fell asleep so early haha, we got enough done while it lasted.. it was jsut fun. 
We hungout with the jeff kid like everyday...hes cool. I cant wait to come back out here and hangout again with everyone..it was sweet..


yeah i dont know what else i want to write...nobody even reads this anyways haha...oh well."

"event","...i never thought you could actually learn so much from one person just by talking to them and them not even knowing how much you actually care..
its so great to be able to like talk to someone and say anything you want and they dont dislike you for it at all. I dont know, maybe im crazy...but i actually am starting to like this person so much and for once it has absolutely nothing to do with how attractive they are physically...its simply just the person they are that makes me want them so incredibly much. not that they are not attractive or whatever, but im looking just totally passed that...and i like it. To say that i like someone and have a million more reasons to why i do without haveing to say that they are hot, as one. i dont know, its just cool i guess. But somthing that sucks is that you cant tell the person you are so into them because of a fear of losing a friendship, or just changing it dramatically...i dont know what to do. Ill most likely just sit back and wait, which usually isnt really me...im kinda a go getter when it comes to telling people how i feel about them, haha, some people already knows this. yeah anyways, whatever....

im incredibly bored here so far..tomorrow morning a nice little present is suppose to come for me...am i excited? you bet. Most excitement ive had all break i think...i guess we'll find out just how good this was tomorrow after it comes..if it does. 

Ahhhh....

Ha haha...i had this really great conversation with my friend Kenny tonight. He i guess was a little ""tipsy"", so i messed with him a little. Well kinda a little. He was talking about how he liked naked girls..and i thought to myself *perfect opportunity to make something up...* so i convinced him i was bisexual. Well it wasnt actually hard to convince him..but still. He was like asking when i discovered this and stuff..it was great. And then he was like, well tell me ONE at LEAST experience youve had!! and i was like nahh, thats alright (cuz i ddint know what to make up..i had nothing goiing through my head)..so it took about 3 minutes to come up with this whole plot, and i typed it all out..and it was jsut hilarious. He believed it all. But then he said he was gonna go to bed cuz hes about to pass out...


....yeah ill bet. ha


hey i have a my space thingy set up now too..if anybody has one tell me so i can add u to my friends on there...alright, goodnight.


jim morrison is dead sexy by the way...or was."

I mean, from eveyrthing in life, ive learned that somthing you REALLY would like to happen almost never will, ever. Either that or itll happen all too late. Bummer, huh. Just leaves me sad after the thoughts, but i guess i could say that since i dont stop myself of thinking about them, that the 5 minutes of happiness that lasts while i daydream about it is far worth having the sadness over.

I only tried not to sound interested because i know that if that other person were to have been there, their wouldnt be a conversation that lasted even half a second between us.

"event","Yeah so what is this? The 2nd..3rd..week of school? Who could possibly be keeping track of how many days weve been in school when all it is is a living hell hole this year. Homework-Way too fucking much for me to do in one night. Im sick of it already, and theres about a million days left. I yi yi. ha, i dont even know how to spell that word. And also i might just be talking about useless shit cuz im only doing this tonight on the account of Mike..cuz we allll kknow i love him sooo much..
Yeah, thats right, so much that on account of looking at him make funny faces and headbanging in the the other classroom through the window in mrs.bocks room, i get threatened to have my seat changed..for liek the 5th time this year. ANd it makes me mad, its one thing to say your going to change my seat, thats fine, do it already, But to say it 5 times..and not act on it once..bullshit. Complete and utter bullshit. She is by far the bitchiest teacher ive had in highschool. Whats up her ass? and i hope that whatever it is didnt crawl up there and die because we all really are hoping for it to crawl back OUT. GOd. enough.
As for the friends..who even knows. I hate when you think you are sure of who your real friends are, or who you can trust and what not- and then it all jsut comes back around and slaps you in the face. Seriously, im not saying names, and its not everyone, but i think i have found a few people who really dont care at all. ANd then i say fuck it, why should i care and try to be the one who keeps the friendship ""alive"" haha. no. I dont know why i get so mad about this, i guess anyone would..but its dissapointing when you hear things people have said or did behind your back who are suppose to be good friends to you. 
Its a whole other story if you find out someone who doesnt even know you well enough to talk shit, talks shit. Thats just funny. Because i always wondered if they actually think it would make someone mad to say crap about them, if they didnt talk to you ever anywyas...i mean, are you really losing a friend by some asswipe making shit up about? Nah, not in my view ur not. Oh well..(that had no point? maybe.)

Hmmm...

Yeah so now what? 
Bed kind of sounds great. I mean great, right now.
Cept i have to read the other half of this book, which ill probly fall asleep to anywyas. AHhh. And im getting a sore throat i think, to make matters worse..

I think im agreeing with alyssa(and jim?) about wanting to die, In a calm way of course, right now. hah"

"event","I dont know the last time i wrote in here, but im sure that i know it wasnt too long ago...
So things have been going better than before,overall. Theres still somethings im upset about, but it can only get better a little at a time..i mean for all of it would be asking too much,right.?

School..what is there to say. Mrs. Bock is like the biggest bitch ever. I can already tell that her class is going to be a living hell for me all year. Who needs Physics anyways? Really i mean what good is it... Mr. Lanning is pretty cool so far, a little crazy,maybe, but ill live haha. He funny at least. I dont know i think my schedule is pretty easy as far as the classes...cept physics. Ehhh.

So, comso? anybody read that? haha..best magazine ever. Im reading it now actually, or i would have never brung(yes, brung) this topic up. I love reading all these wierd sex stories and stuff, its interesting. And like things guys say that they like girls to do and viseversa..haha, i duno, jsut somthing that actually keeps me reading..since we all know that doesnt usually happen when i read books. Magazines are far more intersting though. 

Went to dairy queen with tonight. He almost killed us. Not totally, but i can exagerate.. We were like turning on yellow(cuz it wasnt red yet) and this car was coming and it didnt stop for their red light and flew like right by us and john slammed the brakes and we stopped i swear like 6 inches away from it..haha. But were fine..i put my seat belt on after that.

Im gona go..i picked up somthing to do. :)"

"event","yeah so here i am again..surprise surprise. Whatever, it seems like i have too much going on that i could write in here, but when i start doing it, i cant think of a single thing. Well i hungout with my sister all day today, which is always fun. We have great talks all the time about anything you could imagine, we tell each other everything so its pretty cool..at least i dont have to hide anything from her, which it seems i have to hide a lot of things from some people...soo many people overreact to the gayest things and it makes me soo mad sometimes. I mean yeah i know i can overreact to a few things too once in a while..but when i dont react enough it seems someone out there gets mad at me for that too. Whatever i dont even know what im rambling on about, or what i got into...ha. I think i do that a lot. 

Well...ever since ive worked at quiznos(thats right, i make subs..) i have met alll sorts of people..either i work with them or i met them through people i work with. Ha,yeah..that was pointless to say..but hey..

I think ive started liking someone...i dont want to be sure about that yet though..not until im positive. Haha i dont think that makes sense?? Hm. Well i jsut dont want to fall to fast i guess because whenever that happens it never works out..and im always the one who gets hurt more i think..ahh whats new huh?

Also to let anybody know who doesnt already know...Cyra is coming back out here on december 20..i cant wait haha, it should be fun hanging out with her again...havent in a lonng time(obviously..)

i think i want to get more friends..not because my ones now suck(they dont) but because i want more. It would jsut be better to have all sorts of people to hangout with rather than stick to my little crowd..but the more i think about that, the more i think i dont have a crowd really. I mean i did at times i really do, but then now it seems everyone doesnt consider me the same as i would consider them,or maybe im wrong...they dont let me know what they consider me, unless i maybe would ask??

Also recently things happened with my friends and none of them are talking to me really..either they say they arent aloud to or they are just pissed at me. But i also think that its pretty gay that because one person started saying that i told on everyone..that they all just decide to turn their back on me and say i did too. It makes me feel like im not even a friend to themat all,or else they wouldnt do this. I mean, without even hearing what i have to say about the whole thing..and when i try talking to some of them,they say they dont want to talk about it right now..alright thats fine, but when DO you want you...beats me?. I mean sarah is the only who has really listened to what i have to say, i doubt that helps me out any though because it doesnt seem liek she belives me really, or else shed talk more to me like she did before all this shit happened. Whatever..i shouldnt be the one who has to beg for forgiveness when im not the one who did anything to start with...the person who did it knows they did it, because they admitted it to me twice already..but they dont have the balls to tell everyone else...probly because they dont want what is happening to me to happen to them..but for some reason..i think that if she did tell everyone that it was her, that nobody would be mad at her, they would just forgive me(or not..) and everything would be okay..

I dont know why i even stress out about this..anybody i talk  to about it always tells me that someone isnt worth having as a friend if they are going to get mad about stupid things. I dont know..this whole thing will probably jsut never end and nobody will be effected by it but me..and a few others maybe depending on what our friendship meant to them..

Ahhh i really have to get things together better..i hate how one minute everything will be okay and then the next i start thinking about my life and my friends and boyfriends and whatever i call them..and then all of a sudden im bummed and feel like doing nothing but laying down in my room with some sort of music blasting...

i yi yi."

last night was pretty wierd..me candice and jess went out to this party in north ridgeville and then back to this house where candices friend greg is like babysitting some dog? haha i duno but he had the house to himself for a couple days so we slept there..and i duno we just hungout all night..i left them all at leik 330 and hung out with kyle..*(which wasnt boring kyle..)*at his house with some of his friends..i duno what time i went back to gregs house at but i came home at 8 am this morning..it was a long,long night haha. Fun, but long. And now im soo tired because i was up all night on friday too and worked all day saturday 2-like 10..ahh, i jsut wanna go to bed now..haha. But no i cant...

I hate when you like somebody and they like you, but you have no clue what the hell you guys are..like what do you call that person? If someone were to ask me what i called him..i honestly woudlnt know what to say, but when i ask him about it, it seems like he doesnt wanna talk about it, so im too scared to bring it up again.. And now everything is just so different..i dont think im into this anymore, its all just so confusing and it makes me feel so DUMB talking to him about it..i shoudlnt feel like that? Ahh i dont know what else i can do though, it makes me so sad thinking about it, lets end that.

On the other end, theres somthing else that makes me happy..or someone..haha. But i love talking to them cuz they are funny and really nice..and i dont know what im thinking because i swore i had my heart set on one person for the longest time, but things happened and stuff changed..im not quite sure whats going to come of it..probably nothing, and ill keep getting treated like crap by the first person..and i dont want to use names just because, well because theres is no need..haha, i guess. Ohhh it never ends..

If there is one thing that i have definetly noticed about myself, it would be that im so UNsure of everything. I really cant stand it sometimes, people make up their minds so easily and im still stuck on like what the hell skirt i want to wear or somthing..it drives me crazy sometimes, but i cant fix it. haha and belive it or not ive tried to make my mind up faster about things, but my thinking process makes me go back and like requestion everything..its insane. haha, im probly boring the hell out of whoever reads this garbage..ill stop. haha, until next time..."

"event","Well on sunday the volleyball team went to michigan state for a volleyball camp there. Well it actually was a like four day tournament, we finished in 2nd.Thats good, out of 15... We had to stay in these gross dorms and they were frickin hot as a crotch. No joke. We had to bring our own fans and only one per room, even with that it was still burning hot. Like literally i think if everyone had there own rooms, and werent with people, we'd have walked around butt ass naked or somthing.. If only you knew haha. Then, the food. One word to describe that- FUcking GROSS. (by the way, GROSS is the word..i jsut added the other cuz it was defintely necessary).. SO we had these chicken nuggets for lunch the one day, me and ann didnt think they were bad..sarah did tho, but sarah doesnt like a lot of foods...cuz ""her grandma makes it better"" lol. But yeah anyways, the next day or somthing at dinner, they had this chicken terryaki stuff, and sarahs like OHH i want that, so she goes to get it but then she changed her mind. haha, and Al was behind us in line and she didnt hear me and sarah talking about it, so she gets it. She almost like puked she said, it was the chicken nuggets form the other day! who the hell would try to pull a stunt using nuggets as teryaki, its just not possible..haha..i mean maybe it could have worked if they would cut the nuggets up or somthing b4 mixing it with the other stuff, but no, it was just whole nuggets haha. sick if you ask me...ask tyson how it tasted tho.she ate every last bite of hers..(cuz she got it too) haa.. Yeah i think thats about all, besides some other stuff i would love to share and cant, one because i dont want to embarass anyone, and two, some of it you might of had to be there for..haha ohh, wait one more thing..haha on the way home me sarah lisa al and ann decided to put this condom in paydocks stereo becasue she was in the other car(the thing that opens to put cds in) haha, and today she IMed me and was like...  
ApChiq22 (1:27:18 PM): ok who put the condom in my radio?
xtina1307 (1:28:03 PM): hahahaha
-funny stuff huh..-

When i get back, me and sarah went to mikes to go swimming, and John Ben candice and jane were there too. It was fun, we got some snap[shots of mike doing the freaky thing behind candices back haha...dont worry mike your the first to see them..promise. Haha, and i duno, i found out a couple other things that kinda made me a little mad, but ill deal, im not gonna go make a huge thing over it cuz i doubt it would actually change anyways..but ohh well..ill just let it bother me and stay quiet about it, which if you didnt know, is NOT me to be quiet about somthing i dont like..might be hard.ha

i guess i have nothing else to say that people would care to read so im done..



this is to somebody..
I hate the way you talk to me And the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb tennis shoes And the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick -- It even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh -- Even worse when you make me cry. I hate it when you're not around And the fact that you didn't call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you -- Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all..."

i have question for everyone who reads this also..haha so please answer it..
If you liked somebody and they liked you back a lot, and you guys were together but not boyfriend and girlfriend..if you found out everyone they have done stuff with before you(including just a peck on the cheek..), lets say there were like 18(kinda random..)other people but not all of them were anything that would continue at any time..
Would you still like the person the same way? Or would you just stop and forget about them because you didnt want to know who theyve been with b4 you??

Yeah hahaha thats my question...kinda long, but youll survive..just answer it for me..lol

So i leave for Michigan tomorrow morning with the volleyball team, it should be somewhat fun, depending on what kind of deathdafying? haha activities we have for practice..who knows though..but having 8 hours of practice a day doesnt exactly sound easy now does it..? hmm

ahhh i cant get my mind off of this and its killing me..i dont even feel like doing anything at all tonight.."

yeah im really bored because there is nothing to do in olmsted falls. actually was suppose to have volleyball this morning, but i didnt go..hah oh well i guess.lst night i went up to panara with sarah to visit sam and then mike ben matt and addison came up there..it was alright, not boring. But after me and sarah tried to fnd somewhere to go and theres nowhere, everything closes at 9..how gay is that..theres millions of people out after those hours that would go to the places..haha they should stay open..but thats just me. So we went over to jessicunts house for a little bit and got tortured by becca, because shes a brat. Pouring water on us and throwing chicken..who does that? Well jess lets her sisters boss her aorund haha, its kinda funny soemtimes tho..herlittle sister was flicking her off, and shes liek 5.

"event","Yeah well i know i havent been in here for a long ass time..i think im gona change that tho and start doing it again. So much has happened since i used to write all the time, its wierd, because everything is going by soo fast and you dont even realize it til you stop to think, and i think maybe i should do more of that hah. Or maybe its because i think too much, who knows..i sure as hell dont.
and here it goes...
  SOO,summer has been pretty fun so fay. I mean all i really do is hangout with friends and stuff, and do absolutely nothing sometimes, but for some reason its always kinda fun. Yeah and candice got her license, and then a couple weeks later sarah got hers...so i have atleast been hanging out with them more often, its fun. And this past week  ive been hanging out with ashley and kristen a lot...
  You know its always the littlest things that amuse me, and everybody always makes fun of me for it haha, i dont know why imlike that, my sister is the same way, we both are easily amused..  So the other day i was at Target wityh sarah and we fgound this MINI tape dispenser and stuff, its awesome so got it..but sarah thought i was wierd i guess haha. Yeah whatever, shes jealous..lol
  Ohhh today i went running this morning, 1.3 miles with sarah and ashley, and then we ate popcorn haha..and woke kristen up at 845 by honking the horn and driving around her coldesac..cuz we wanted to go swimming, and we did. In our ""penis caps"". hah. they were ridiculous..
  also ive been thinking alot lately..(haha yeah thats right, IVE been thinking..alot.) and ive came to the conclusion, that im a lesbian. no not really..but guys suck. Most guys anyways. They alwayts make big deals about stupid things and turn it into this huge feascul?(big word hah)and start assuming things that probly most often arent true, Im sick of it. I give up on trying...jsut to let you know. and im guessing ""you"" probly know who you are..maybe not, but then this whole thing is pointless, so im gona stop.haha...
yeah im done..
  wait i need to find some cool thing for my icon, i think chad michael murray is soo hot, but its getting old..any ideas tell me, post it. hah"

anwyays, yeah lately i have been sorta busy. Actually i havent really had time to talk or hangout with all the people ive wanted to, and some people i miss so much...even though it doesnt seem like i ever think about my friends i really do.Just lately ive been kinda working on not letting all my feelings show, because something always goes wrong when i let them out too early..so yeah, i guess you would probably say i have changed a little bit. I mean you could say that if you know me well enough..well you know what i mean. Im sorry if i have changed in a bad way, but right now im actually happier than i usually was. But thats beyond the point...

So...spring court? it was awesome!! i had so much fun haha. I actually hung out with juts about everyone i wanted to. hahah sorry sam about that, we know what im talking about..haha it was a total accident. hah.

hmmm...i have been doing all these things but yet i cant think of one thing to write. oh okay here is somthing..for jessica: 
Im sorry that i havent been talking to you much lately, ive just been preoccupied. But i dontthink its only my fault so i dont want you to be mad at me or anything for it. You have been hanging out with other people lately too.And neither of us has called as often as we used to..but i want that to change, and go back to how it was. haha, I MISS YOU!!! and i wasnt too happy about the ""news"" you told me at lunch, but it wasnt because of who it was..it because of what you did. i guess i could say i was just dissapointed that you would do somthing liek that, it didnt even matter that he was involved. it was just that i didnt think you would ever in a million years do that..i dont know, it was just kinda a shock.and also i wasl eik the last person to find out just because you were too scared to tell me..you shodulnt worry about that..oh well its over theres ntohing we could do..

"event","yea im tired and i dont even know what else. mad maybe, sad? im all of it. Its like i dont even know what i feel anymore, and at some times, its like i dont even care, other times i just get upset about it, and try to talk to someone..which is usually jess, but not often. i always keep all my true feelings and stuff to myself, and no one really knows what i feel most of the time. Im either hiding it or showing it barely but no one notices..which is good somtimes..cuz somtimes i cant hide it.. it just annoys me most of the time how i can be feeling sooo many things at one time and have no one to tel them all too..i cant talk to anyone in my own home, because they are pshycho, and i dont associate with my ""parentals"" unless i absolutely have to..
other times ill be telling my friends stuff that goes on, but i turn it into a laughing matter, so they dont know how i feel about it...but thats also what i do..i always laugh. i can make almost anything a laughing matter, most of the time its a good thing...unless im trying to be serious and then end up not being able to..ahhh i dont know. 
im going to bed because i dont want to do this anymore...
good night."

"event","ALRIGHT YES ITs OVER AND DONE WITH. 

I have accomplished writing my poem for english! I dont know if its considered good or not, i mostly just feel concieted about it. Not that i tried to be, because i know im not concieted(and if u think i am...tell me haha cuz id wannaknow!!)But seriously. a teacher cant tell you to write a poem about your self, its just not good.I mean its okay if its about you, just not if it has to point out your best feature and describe it in ""vivid details"". I just feel weird saying what i like about myself most. I duno, maybe im the only one. 

Yea so anyways..if everwood is a repeat tomrrow..im going down to the station and strangling the person who played it..because it has been a repeat the past liek 4 weeks, i swear. That and one tree hill. and im sick of it. i just want to watch a new one!!!! haha..but it also sucks cuz ive got volleyball til 8 30 tomrrow..maybe i could tape it.Butidont know how to lol. 

I always want to say stuff in here, but then when i type it i also erase it, cuz some things i juts dont like saying when i know EVEYRONE AND ANYONE can just read it online..so i hold some stuff back. Im going to try not to from now on..i think. HAH.
Im going. Cya

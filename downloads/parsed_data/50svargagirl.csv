"event","Its been so long sicne ive updated my journal. Yeah myspace, i remember the first time i looked that shit up lol the only reasen i wanted to be in it was because sum of my friends were and i thought it looked fun.



Lately ive been feeling really left out from my friends. 


The other day i was supposed to go out with sum friends to main street we planned to all go the day before. And so i call my friend and im at school and she says theyre leaving in a half an hour, hint im still at school.


So im like whoa u kno what either way if i wouldnt had called her they still would had went u kno? and i wouldnt had known. Even tho it was planned for me to go also.


So she said call me when u get out of school and well see what we can do? first u dont see what u can do for a friend. Its not like ure doing them a favour when u hang out with them theyre ure fucking friends


So i call after school and ask if shes going to the show that night, and shes liek yes, another thing that we all planned to go to .


So ""I"" had to ask if i could go. she didnt say anything. So she said shed call me later before they left. So when do i get a phone call??? the show starts at 7 and she calls at 730 and shes already on her way


""im so sorry i feel bad for not calling you, were on our way right now and ashley already left!""


""oh well thats ok i didnt feel liek going out anyway""


...................... am i the only one who thinks thats fucked up??


i mean i dunno and i always feel that im the one who has to call and make plans to do stuff. I dunno sumtimes i just wish i lived sumwhere bymyself.


and eveyday my feelings for this guy never stop growing, i like him so much, hes the sweetest most awesomest guy int he world.


I could never get a guy like that.


Im gonna start to write in my journal more, i never realized how much it made me feel better, even tho no one might read it, i still feel better


Im gonna go :)"

Star on Walk of Fame

In an article about how the Walk of Fame in Hollywood has been languishing, doing poorly, etc. I found the conclusion very interesting. 

This is a bit long, but well worth the read!! 

Excerpts:
I stayed outside under the shade of the palm trees to watch the crowd. I noticed a homeless man with withered legs lower himself out of his wheelchair and on to the ground. 

He took a plastic tray from underneath the chair loaded with rags, sponges, two spray bottles and a battered metal one. 

He took one of the bottles and a rag, pressed his face almost into the pavement and began to clean Stephanie Powers' star. Once finished, he dragged himself along the ground to the next star, belonging to Luna Humberto, and cleaned it, too. 

Done with Luna, he then pulled himself along to the next star, which was right outside the doors to McDonald's. He regarded the star for a moment before spraying it with the bottle and wiping it with the rag. 

Then he went back to the tray and selected a different rag and a battered metal bottle. Carefully, as if it were liquid gold, he poured a thick polish on to the rag and diligently applied it to the brass elements of the star. 

He waited patiently for it to dry, then wiped it clean. The brass was gleaming. He then put the bottle and rags back in their tray and moved onto the next star. 

I walked over to [see] what sort of name could command such special treatment. It was, of course, Marilyn Monroe.

Ive decided that i hate journals completely and that im taking a break from mine.

so fuck journals and im not reading anyone's either.im deleting everyone elses journal that i might have.

and i disabled comment's. not like it matters n e way huh? Im so sick of being so active with everyones elses journal but no one else can even take the time to leave a comment or comment back to the comment i left in their journal.

so fuck it....... i love cali except u uve always left comments and made me happy about my journal. o and to all my wonderfull friends that ive found from my marilyn monro community u guys have been awesome to.sorry i couldnt join the johnny depp community i love cali. maybe i will when i decide to come back :)

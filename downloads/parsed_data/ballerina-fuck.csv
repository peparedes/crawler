I need a camera
To my eye
To my eye, reminding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong

I've counted out 
Days to see how far
I've driven in the dark
With echoes in my heart

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no it's not okay

"event","<div style=""text-align: center;"">It's so strange. i've upped my medication dosage and i feel even worse? how can that be. i doubled the intake. ech. that right there makes me feel even worse. the san diego trip  was awesome but i cant get over this ""casie's dad's girlfriend"" thing. i just WISH there was SOMETHING i could do. i was around the woman for 2 days and that night i hoped the woman would die in her sleep. I just want to help Casie soooooo bad. she's seriously one of the best people with the biggest hearts i know. my mom and i talked about this refusal to face reality thing lastnight. my conclusion: its defenitely time to grow up. wether it makes me a bitter old woman someday, atleast i will be a woman and not the little girl that i feel like. 

my grandparents are in town for my brothers graduation. he's 18 you know? he's getting SOOO old. anyways, this is depressing, him and i are going to be starting our freshmen years of college together. dammit. and i'm supposed to call tommorow to see if i got the job at Ruby's. if i didnt... does anyone have any suggestions for a cool place to work? 

i've got to clean. my room is embarassingly dirty right now. i could shoot my mother for going through things while i was gone.

OH! and remind me to make an appointment with my optometrist. 

thanks!

"event","woo hoo. i'm going to san diego tommorow. Casie and her ""family?"" invited me out to the gaslight quarter in south san diego. were going to stay the night in an awsome hotel.. and its going to be fabulous! im so excited! casie and her dad are freakin awesome. plus.. dude, its casie, how can i have a bad time? im going to bring some embroidery to work on in the car. but im going to be gone saturday and sunday. yay. 

tonight my Dads friend Didi gave me a little chinese silk purse. and i love that even more! woo hoo! 
i wanted to get one for casie but she only had one = (
and im going to be hanging out with Erika on monday. 
things are going good...

my mom thinks im homicidal and depressed. but the truth is im just dissapointed. getting out of high school and not having someone tell me what to do with my day isn't as great as i thought it would be. but i find myself thinking more independently, i just need to work on trying to make everyone but myself happy. i feel like half of the things i do (except quitting my job) are for everyone else.
but the truth is, my cousin, Danielle, who is 2 weeks older than me, is having her second baby and has no where but with her bum fuck parents. her dad is an idiot and her mom is a fat slob drug addict.. so, the truth is... i have more going for me than i think. i have a wonderful boyfriend, beautiful friends, jeremy, caitlin, my family who loves me no matter how stupid i think.. and i still have air in my lungs. so.. everything will be ok.

im in davids sweatshirt tonight, so its kinda like him holding onto me while i sleep. he's so warm and his kisses are like lemon drops. sweet and calming. 

im off to bed, my cell will be on all weekend! so im sure ill talk to y'all later!

DAMMIT! im not preagnant! one would have to have sex to get preagnant!!! i'm irregular! always have been! seriously, he's been my doctor for three years and he still hasnt figured this out. 

anyways, ive got to go shower and get ready.

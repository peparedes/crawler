"event","*Well Hey*! Sorry I haven't updated in well....*FOREVER*....but I havent really had much time..and then my computer also decides to mess up on me for a lil bit...so that kinda put a damper on things too**! but ah! oh well*~! Im back now*!~! well atleast for this time! who knows if i'll make it back again*~! haha*!~ but well in the time i've been gone** I guess I can say life has been pretty decent I suppose*!~ had some fun** i think...maybe a lil too much sometimes! haha! ~!  but well...i've met alot of new ppl...thats definatley good*~! =) Okay...*one* that I actually am really glad I met right now*~! hehe*! but well anyway**!!
and....well...whats new in my life?? umm...I'm moving out**~! hehe*! got my own apartment now...its still close to home....I'll always be a moma's girl..hehe**
but well...hey....atleast im by myself and can finally do basically what i want** =) which i hope it will be nice....i should be in Thursday....that's when my phone line is gettin' put in and the internet and all that good stuff*!~ well I've done got everything cleaned up*! and now all I lack is gettin' my stuff in and puttin up a few decorations so it wont be so bare*!! i'm sure i'll be lonely** so everyone feel free to drop by*!~ =)
Well in the past month....I had a birthday*!! hehe*! I'm *FINALLY* 18*~*! My bday was a good one**~! =) so thanks to you all who made it that way*! =)

*just a few thoughts going through my head...*
you know....its kinda weird...how ppl change......i've just been thinkin' a lil tonight.....its weird how someone you know your whole life....just sorta...fades away...and you reallly dont know what happens to them.....you know??? like one day...they just dont talk to ya no more...or anyone else in their family for that matter...haha... its just like one minute they are there...then the next...they are gone....?? weird huh?? 
and you know another thing...that i find a lil weird...while im sittin here thinkin.....it's how easy...someone you care bout...and really think that will never leave your side...seem to maybe ditch you over...not sure if thats the correct word...or phrase...or whatever....or i guess just sorta seem like they dont even know you...kinda as if they are mad...and you've killed their dog or something??? but when you sit and think you cannot think of anything you've done wrong...?? and its like...they just sorta forget about you just outta the blue....and then...like...care more for someone they have barely even known...rather than sticking by you??? heck..i dont know...i dont even know if i'm makin sense**but i've just been thinkin' a lil lately.....and dont get me wrong....dont think i'm like all depressed....and crap....haha...im fine* =) i was just sittin here thinkin' tonight...and thought i'd write it down in here...well type it out...what im thinkin' that is..hehe...even though im sure alot of you are like...what is she talkin bout......haha...sorry!! 
and well....I wanna say thanks to a *special* friend*~! Thanks for being here for me*!! and helping me out** you might not realize it....but you have really helped so much** and I love you for that*!*! and I'm sure you know who you are**!~ =)  (*HONK*....hehehe) Luv ya**!

and shew! please dont think i'm crazy! or depressed or anyting cause i wrote that! haha*! I was just thinkin*!!*~! =) thinkin' can be good sometimes! I guess**~! and sorry if this made no sense** but that shouldn't be too suprising** hehe**~! =)
But well until the next time*! haha! who knows when that will be**! I'm out*!! Much Luv for ya*~! =)"

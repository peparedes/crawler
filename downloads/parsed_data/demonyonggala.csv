i remember having a craving for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobo"">adobo</a> and no one was home. i was so hungry for it that i decided to open my mom's cookbook and follow the recipe. that was the first time i ever cooked an entree, other than breakfast. teehee! and i have to say that cooking has been one of my favorite things to do. 

now, i usually get recipes from friends, family, or from magazines like Martha Stewart's ""Living"", which my mom gets every month."

"event","My heart is heavy right now. Dysphoria raining ever so hard that I just want to sit here for a moment, and let it drench me out of the apathy that has chilled me to the bones. I shudder for a moment and think about what my mom always tells us when we were kids.

<i><b>""Strike while the iron is hot!""</b></i>

Or looking back at a time in college when I submitted my final term paper in my Developmental Psychology class, a day late, and reading what my professor had written.

<i><b>""Mitch, it doesn't have to be perfect, it just have to be on time.""</b></i>

Need I say more that I got a low grade on that paper because I submitted it late?

Now as I type this, those words haunt me with such reverberating intensity that is making me feel sick to my stomach right now. I cannot help but think about the last thing that Laura said to me yesterday, as I was leaving the mail room.

<i><b>""Mitch, 5 minutes? Cut me some slack here...""</b></i>

That's exactly what is running through my head right now. The 22nd, yesterday, was the last day to apply and I still had 5 minutes before the deadline, damn it! (sorry, had to get that out of my chest)

It wouldn't have made a difference to talk to her sooner. I needed to be sure that it is what I want to do. Although, as my mentor, it would've made sense to actually voice my interest in the position to her at the very beginning, yet I still needed to have that conviction within--sure of myself, of what I want, and what I can offer. 

The reason for my waiting to the very last minute to apply was not because I did not think I was right for the job, on the contrary, I know I am the best qualified candidate for the position. 

I had to carefully consider what Alicia, our Executive Director, had asked of me-- to reconsider and stay on when I expressed my desire to resign a few weeks ago. I will forever cherish what she had said to me that day. It really made me feel good to know, and it is the best pat on the back of my career yet. 

However, I have to think what is best for me too.

D. Chopra wrote that <i><b>""Success can be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progressive realization of worthy goals.""</b></i>  

Moreover, he wrote that <i><b>""Success is a journey, not a destination. Material abundance, in all it's expression, happens to make the journey more enjoyable, but success includes good health, energy and enthusiasm for life, fulfilling relationship, creative freedom, and a sense of well-being.""  </b></i>

I felt that my opportunity was there to be able to extend myself upward and outward. To reach out eagerly and without fear for a newer and richer experience. 

I can probably still talk to Laura and the rest of the gods of SC of Rochester, and plead my case and maybe she'll reconsider and hire me instead of whoever she has prematurely offered the position to.

Right. *grunts* (asa ka pa, mitch)

Maybe this will prove to be a learning experience for me...

""To not wait too long, and strike while the iron is still indeed hot.""
""That sometimes it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be on time,""
""To wait at the last minute, maybe too late.""

Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here. I have to believe there is. 

Okay Paul, now <a href=""http://youtu.be/pIKqFbycJgY"">SING</a> for me.

<p><font size=""5""><strong>A full breathing exercise</strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Step 1: Lie prone on the floor. Loosen your belt and restrictive clothing. </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Step 2: Relax and exhale as completely as possible. Begin to inhale slowly making your belly rise. Now move your rib cage. Now your chest. Hold it for a second. Now, exhale completely, all the air out of your lungs. Try it again. This is complete breathing. Breathe normally for a while, and in the next minute take at least one more complete breath. Pause one minute. </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Step 3: You are still lying prone. As you lie there you will begin stretching muscles to achieve unblocked circulation. Bring your arms above your head and stretch them away from you fully. Now stretch your legs and feet downward, away from you, take a deep breath, let go and relax. Pause ten seconds. Feel the effects of the stretch on your body and on your breathing. Pause 15 seconds. Now sit up very slowly. </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Step 4: Stand up for this part of the exercise. There are three very basic stretching postures to increase flexibility. </font></p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <div><font size=""3"">backward bend </font></div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <div><font size=""3"">forward bend </font></div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <div><font size=""3"">side-to-side bend </font></div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><font size=""3"">As you do your backward bend pay attention to stretching your abdomen and back muscles. </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Important: Go only as far as you can. Don't push yourself. Bend slowly. As you do your forward bend, pay attention to the stretch of your back muscles and backs of legs; blood in head and arms. As you do your side stretch, pay attention to stretching in your chest, sides and neck. </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Step 5: Assume a comfortable sitting posture, one you can hold for 15 to 20 minutes. This could be in a chair. Get comfortable and close your eyes when you are ready. </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Please note everything you are aware of: outside sounds, your bodily awareness, thoughts; note this awareness and do not change it. Then, notice shifting from outside sounds to thoughts of bodily awareness. </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">After approximately five minutes of this, notice that breathing is occurring; again, not to change it but only to notice it. One can enhance this noticing by attaching the words ``breathing out'' to the breath as it leaves the nostrils and ``breathing in'' as the breath reenters. As awareness shifts from breathing to thoughts of external sounds, allow that to happen and the return to ``breathing out-breathing in'' (following the breath). </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Continue this for five to seven minutes. At this point, try to incorporate some visual imagery in the form of a golden light with the in-breath. See yourself breathing in this golden light and watching it fill the inside of your body. This could be in a particle, vapor, smoke, or mist like form, whatever is comfortable for you. Visualize this light in your head, shoulders, chest and breath out any tensions in the form of a black color. Continue until you visually experience your whole body as being filled with this golden light. Experience that feeling. </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Stay with this experience for another minute or two. Then, become aware of your breath again, with your body sitting on the floor or chair (feeling grounded). When ready, open your eyes. </font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Step 6: Try this breathing exercise for 15 to 20 minutes daily until you are able to achieve full breathing and stress reduction in a progressively shorter period of time.</font></p>

<p><font size=""5""><strong>""Do's and don'ts'' of relaxation:</strong></font> </p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Do:</strong> Make sure you have comfortable, loose clothing and proper back support </font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Don't:</strong> Put your self in an awkward position or in a position that will make it easy to fall asleep </font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Do:</strong> Allow your mind to quiet down. If tense thoughts enter while you are relaxing, let them pass out of your head. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Don't:</strong> Think your way into tension. If you can't clear your mind, take a long, deep breath and let it out slowly. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Do:</strong> Stay alert and conscious while you are relaxing. Pay close attention and note any changes in your body (feelings that stand out for you). </font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Don't:</strong> Allow yourself to become groggy and sleepy. If you start falling asleep, open your eyes and sit up. When you are ready, return to relaxation posture. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Do:</strong> Go at your own pace and let go of your muscles as your body decides to give up tension. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Don't:</strong> Expect yourself to relax all at one. Like any other physical exercise, you must practice letting go step by step. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Do:</strong> Give your body messages of appreciation for relaxing as you notice these feelings going through your body. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Don't:</strong> Get down on your self for not relaxing. Your body should be trusted to go at its own pace. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Do:</strong> Stay award of your breathing. Observe how much air you're taking in full breaths at regular rhythms. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Don't:</strong> Smoke before, during or after relaxation as it tightens lung tissue and blood vessels. Let your body breathe.<br /><br /><br /><strong><font size=""5"">Record these directions for yourself by reading them slowly. Use the tape daily to practice the relaxation response:</font></strong><br /><br /><br /></font><font size=""5""><font size=""3""><strong>Settle back as comfortably as you can and close your eyes. Let your self relax to the best of your ability. Now, as you relax like that, clench your right fist. Just clench your fist tighter and tighter and study the tension as you do so. Keep it clenched and feel the tension in your right fist, hand, forearm. Now relax. Let the fingers of your right hand become loose, and observe the contrast in your feelings. Now, let yourself go and try to become more relaxed all over. Once more, clench your right fist really tight Y hold it, and notice the tension again. Now let go, relax; your fingers straighten out and you notice the difference once more. Repeat that with your left fist. Clench your left fist while the rest of your body relaxes; clench that fist tighter and feel the tension. Now relax. Again, enjoy the contrast. Repeat that once more. Clench the left fist, tight and tense. Now do the opposite of tension: relax and feel the difference. Continue relaxing like that for a while. Clench both fists tighter and tighter, both fists tense, forearms tense. Study the sensations. Relax; straighten out your fingers and feel the relaxation. Continue relaxing your hands and forearms more and more. </strong></font></font></p>
<p align=""left""><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>Now bend your elbows and tense your biceps, tense them harder and study the tension feelings. All right. Straighten out your arms, let them relax and feel that difference again. Let the relaxation develop. Once more, tense your biceps; hold the tension and observe it carefully. Straighten the arms and relax; relax to the best of your ability. Each time, pay close attention to your feelings when you tense up and when you relax. Now straighten your arms. Straighten them so that you feel the most tension in the triceps muscles along the backs of your arms; stretch your arms and feel that tension. Now relax. Get your arms back into a comfortable position. Let the relaxation proceed on its own. The arms should feel comfortably heavy as you allow them to relax. Straighten the arms once more so that you feel the tension in the triceps muscles; straighten them. Feel that tension Y relax. Now concentrate on pure relaxation in the arms without any tension. Get your arms comfortable and let them relax further and further. Continue relaxing your arms even further. Even when your arms seem fully relaxed, try to go that extra bit further; try to achieve deeper and deeper levels of relaxation. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>Let all your muscles go loose and heavy. Just settle back quietly and comfortably. Wrinkle up your forehead now; wrinkle it tighter. Now, stop wrinkling your forehead; relax and smooth it out. Picture the entire forehead and scalp becoming smoother as the relaxation increased. Now, frown and crease your brows and study the tension. Let go of the tension again. Smooth out the forehead once more. Now, close your eyes tighter and tighter. Feel the tension. Relax your eyes. Keep your eyes closed, gently and comfortably, and notice the relaxation. Now clench your jaws, bite your teeth together; study the tension throughout the jaws. Relax your jaws now. Let your lips part slightly. Appreciate the relaxation. Now press your tongue hard against the roof of your mouth. Look for the tension. All right. Let your tongue return to a comfortable and relaxed position. Now purse your lips. Press your lips together tighter and tighter. Relax the lips. Note the contrast between tension and relaxation. Feel the relaxation all over your face, all over your forehead and scalp, eyes, jaws, lips, tongue and throat. The relaxation progresses further and further. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>Now attend to your neck muscles. Press your head back as far as it can go and feel the tension in the neck now roll it to the left. Straighten your head and bring it forward. Press your chin against your chest. Let your head return to a comfortable position and study the relaxation. Let the relaxation develop. Shrug your shoulders. Hold the tension. Drop your shoulders and feel the relaxation. Neck and shoulders relaxed. Shrug your shoulders again and move them around. Bring your shoulders up and forward and back. Feel the tension in your shoulders and in your upper back. Drop your shoulders once more and relax. Let the relaxation spread deep into the shoulders, right into your back muscles; relax your neck and throat, and your jaws and other facial areas as the pure relaxation takes over and grows deeper, deeper, ever deeper. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>Relax your entire body to the best of your ability. Feel that comfortable heaviness that accompanies relaxation. Breathe easily and freely in and out. Notice how the relaxation increase as you exhale. As you breathe out, just feel that relaxation. Now breathe right in and fill your lungs inhale deeply and hold your breathe. Study the tension. Now exhale, let the walls of your chest grow loose and push the air out automatically. Continue relaxing and breathe freely, gently. Feel the relaxation and enjoy it. With the rest of your body as relaxed as possible, fill your lungs again. Breathe in deeply and hold it again. That's fine, breathe out and appreciate the relief. Just breathe normally. Continue relaxing your chest and let the relaxation spread to your back, shoulders, neck and arms. Merely let go. Enjoy the relaxation. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>Now let's pay attention to your abdominal muscles; your stomach area. Tighten your stomach muscles, make your abdomen hard. Notice the tension. And relax. Let the muscles loosen and notice the contrast. Once more, press and tighten your stomach muscles, make your abdomen hard. Notice the tension. And relax. Let the muscles loosen and notice the contrast. Once more, press and tighten your stomach muscles. Hold the tension and study it, relax. Notice the general well being that comes with relaxing your stomach. Now draw your stomach in, pull the muscles in and feel the tension this way. Relax again, let your stomach out. Continue breathing normally and easily. Feel the gentle massaging action all over your chest and stomach. Now pull your stomach in again and hold the tension. Push out and tense like that; hold the tension. Once more, pull in and feel the tension. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>Now relax your stomach fully. Let the tension dissolve as the relaxation grows deeper. Each time your breathe out, notice the rhythmic relaxation both in your lungs and in your stomach. Try and let go of all contractions anywhere in your body. Now direct your attention to your lower back. Arch your back, making your lower back quite hollow, and feel the tension along your spine. Settle down comfortably again, relaxing the lower back. Just arch your back and feel the tension as you do so. Try to keep the ready of your body as relaxed as possible. Try to localize the tension throughout your lower back area. Relax once more, relaxing further and further. Relax your lower back, relax your upper back. Spread the relaxation to your stomach, chest, shoulders, arms and facial area, these parts relaxing further, further, further, ever deeper. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>Let go of all tensions and relax. Now flex your buttocks and thighs. Flex your thighs by pressing down your heels as hard as you can. Relax and note the difference. Straighten your knees and flex your thigh muscles again. Hold the tension. Relax your hips and thighs. Allow the relaxation to proceed on its own. Press your feet and toes downward, away from your face, so that your calf muscles become tense. Study the tension. Relax your feet and calves. This time, bend your feet toward your face so that you feel tension along your shins. Bring your toes right up. Relax again. Keep relaxing for a while. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>Now let your self relax further all over. Relax your feet, ankles, calves and shins, knees, thighs, buttocks and hips. Feel the heaviness of your lower body as you relax still further. Now spread the relaxation to your stomach, waist, lower back. Let go more and more. Feel that relaxation all over. Let it proceed to your upper back, chest, shoulders and arms, right to the tips of your fingers. Keep relaxing more and more deeply. Make sure that no tension has crept into your throat; relax your neck and your jaws and all your facial muscles. Keep relaxing your whole body like that for a while. Let yourself relax all over. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>Now you can become twice as relaxed as you are merely by taking in a deep breath and exhaling slowly. With your eyes closed you become less aware of objects and movements around you, thus preventing any surface tensions from developing. Breathe in deeply and feel yourself becoming heavier. Take in a long, deep breath and let it out very slowly. Feel how heavy and relaxed you have become. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>In a state of perfect relaxation you should feel unwilling to move a single muscle in your body. Think about the effort that would be required to raise your right arm. As you think about raising your right arm, see if you can notice any tensions that might have crept into your shoulder and arm. You decide not to lift the arm but to continue relaxing. Observe the relief and the disappearance of tension. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>Just carry on relaxing like that. When you wish to get up, count backward from four to one. You should then feel fine, refreshed, wide awake and calm.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size=""5""><strong>Suggested uses for personal Life Events analysis</strong></font>: </p>
<p><font size=""4"">1. Become familiar with the different events and the amounts of stress they promote. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4"">2. Put the list of events where your family can easily refer to it several times a day. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4"">3. Practice recognizing the stress level when one of these events happens. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4"">4. Think about the meaning of the event for you and identify your feelings. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4"">5. Think about the different ways you can adjust to the event. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4"">6. Take your time in arriving at decisions. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4"">7. Anticipate life changes and plan for them well in advance whenever possible. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4"">8. Pace yourself. It can be done even if you are in a hurry. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4"">9. Look at the accomplishment of a task as a part of ongoing daily living; avoid looking at such an achievement as a stopping point. Congratulate yourself and push ahead. </font></p>
<p><font size=""4"">10. Recognize that your internal mechanism of coping with stress is directly tied to how your health and well being will be influenced by it.<br /><br /><br /><font size=""2""></font></font></p>
<p><font size=""5""><strong>STRESS REDUCTION TECHNIQUES </strong></font></p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Progressive Relaxation</strong></font>:</p>
<p>Progressive relaxation of your muscles reduces pulse rate and blood pressure as well as decreasing perspiration and respiration rates. Deep muscle relaxation can be used as an anti-anxiety pill. The body responds to anxiety-producing thoughts and events with muscle tension which in turn increases the anxiety. Muscle relaxation reduces tension and is incompatible with anxiety. Typically, it involves tensing individual muscle groups for several seconds and releasing the tension -- allowing the muscles to gradually relax.</p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Deep Breathing:</strong></font></p>
<p>Proper breathing is essential for good mental and physical health. The next time you feel a surge of stress, try a few moments of deep breathing. Sit in a comfortable position and take deep, measured breaths, e.g., inhaling while counting up from 1 to 4; exhaling while counting down from 4 to 1. Do this 20-30 times and you=re sure to feel refreshed. Deep breathing assists in relaxation by increasing the amount of oxygen in the body. </p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Visualization:</strong></font></p>
<p>If you think anxious thoughts, you become tense. In order to overcome negative feelings, you can use the power of your imagination to refocus your mind on positive, healing images. Get into a comfortable position, close your eyes and visualize a scene or place that you associate with safety and relaxation. It doesn't matter what you visualize, as long as it's calming to you. As you relax your mind, your body also relaxes.</p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Thought Stopping:</strong></font></p>
<p>Thought stopping helps you overcome excessive worry, repetitive thoughts, and negative thinking, which may take the form of self-doubt, fear, and avoidance of stressful situations. Thought stopping involves concentrating on the unwanted thoughts and after a short time, suddenly stopping and emptying your mind, by using the mental command ""stop"" or a loud noise to interrupt negative thinking. Then, you may use thought substitution to focus on positive thoughts and outcomes. If the thoughts can be controlled, stress levels can be significantly reduced.</p>
<p><font size=""4""><strong>Assertive Skills:</strong></font></p>
<p>Being assertive can reduce stress as you express personal thoughts and feelings. You are behaving assertively when you stand up for yourself, express your true feelings, and do not let others take advantage of you. Be specific and clear about what you want, think, and feel; deliver your message in a clear and non-blaming manner; make personal statements such as, ""I want ... , I think ... , I feel ..."" etc; Ask for feedback and cooperation. Being assertive means being able to express yourself openly, honestly, and directly, while being considerate of others' feelings. Being assertive increases self-satisfaction, respect from others, self-esteem and confidence.</p>

I will post the stress redux techniques as well</font>.</font><br /><br /><br /><font size=""3"">I worked over the weekend, and i'm glad that I had last night and tonight off. I feel I need to recuperate. It wasn't terribly busy but I just feel awfuly tired lately. It almost seems like I am exhausted at the cellular level. It could be <em>STRESS</em>. Yes, it could very well be. I am reminded of the score I got of 821 on the stress test (life event analysis) I took at our management conference a few weeks back. That number didn't even mean anything to me until I showed it to the facilitator. I remember Cheryl Klinkhammer, the ED (executive director) of Sunrise-Buffalo, who did the topic on Stress Reduction, painfully reiterated to me that I needed to bring that number down to at least ""299"". I can still see the look on her face as I type this. I found it amusing then and laughed it off because I had no idea that I was apparently under A LOT of stress. Who, in their right frame of mind, would? Come on, are you kidding me? I don't even have the time to think about it. I'm Superman. And like all of you Superheroes out there, we have a million and one other thing to worry about, so WE JUST DO. Simple as that. Multi-task, multi-task, multi-task! It's an important life skill we all do. But so does R &amp; R. It's not a life skill but it's vital that we do rest and find time for relaxation in order to remain healthy and thus have the energy to do the million and one other thing we need to accomplish.<br /></font><br /><font size=""5""><strong><br />How Stressed are you?<br /><br /></strong><font size=""4"">Below is a test you can take to find out.<br /><br /><em>This is a Life Event Analysis by Thomas H.<br />Holmes, M.D. Dept.

<center><b>Wait
by RUSSELL KELFER


Desperately, helplessly, longingly, I cried;
Quietly, patiently, lovingly, God replied.
I pled and I wept for a clue to my fate...
and the Master so gently said, ""Wait.""

""Wait? you say wait?"" my indignant reply.
""Lord, I need answers, I need to know why!
Is your hand shortened? Or have you not heard?
By faith I have asked, and I'm claiming your Word.

My future and all to which I relate
hangs in a balance, and you tell me to 'Wait?'
I'm needing a 'yes,' a go-ahead sign.
Or even a 'no' to which I'll resign.

You promised, dear Lord, that if we believe,
we need but to ask, and we shall receive.
Lord, I've been asking, and this is my cry:
I'm weary of asking! I need a reply.""

Then quietly, softly, I learned of my fate
as my Master replied again, ""Wait.""
So I slumped in my chair, defeated and taut,
and grumbled to God, ""So, I'm waiting... for what?""

He seemed then to kneel, and His eyes met with mine...
and He tenderly said, ""I could give you a sign.
I could shake the heavens and darken the sun.
I could raise the dead and cause mountains to run.

I could give all you seek and pleased you would be.
You'd have what you want, but you wouldn't know Me.
You'd not know the depth of My love for each saint.
You'd not know the power that I give to the faint.

You'd not learn to see through clouds of despair.
You'd not learn to trust just by knowing I'm there.
You'd not know the joy of resting in Me
when darkness and silence are all you can see.

You'd never experience the fullness of love
when the peace of My spirit descends like a dove.
You would know that I give, and I save, for a start,
but you'd not know the depth of the beat of My heart.

The glow of My comfort late into the night,
the faith that I give when you walk without sight.
The depth that's beyond getting just what you ask
from an infinite God who makes what you have last.

You'd never know should your pain quickly flee,
what it means that 'My grace is sufficient for thee.'
Yes, your dearest dreams overnight would come true,
but, oh, the loss, if I lost what I'm doing in you.

So, be silent, my child, and in time you will see
that the greatest of gifts is to truly know Me.
And though oft' My answers seem terribly late,
My most precious answer of all is still, 'WAIT'.""</b></center>"

"event","I sit here, staring and seemingly hypnotized by the constant flicker of the cursor--courting, commanding, beseeching a testimony of a love story that will not have its happily-ever-after ending.

Love's scorn beckoned me not to trust, while it summoned her not to be true.
Both unable to let go.
Both <i>afraid</i> to let go.
And thus, how could we ever be?

I wipe away the tears, take a drag off my cigarette, and wonder if I'll ever see her again.

NO.
I wouldn't want to right now, or tomorrow, or 5 years from now.
NEVER.
Because it would be too painful. Still.

Her promises,
My dreams.
Hers, broken,
Mine, shattered.
Like shards of glass,
Crimson tinged--

I'm glad that my computer is finally fixed. I can surf again in the comforts of my own home and not have to pay for internet usage and parking. The cafe that I go to charges a whopping $5/hr. And with my thumb+index+mid finger typing combo it gets to be quite costly. teehee. Also, Tizza, my sister had been kind enough to let me add some of my picture files to her webspace account so that I'm able to post it. Thanks, Chame! Speaking of which, she now has a livejournal as well. <lj user=""eccentric_woman""> .

<b>TELETUBBY</b>

I was watching  a rerun of ""Attack Of The Show"" the other day and thought I'd share a few of the tips that Kevin R. provided on avoiding spam mails.

I know we all get weary of filling out those web forms, mostly because we either become targets  for unwanted pop ads, or worse, our inbox inundated by several junk mails. 

So, here's what you do. If you have a Gmail acount, try inserting  <b>""+ spam""</b> in your e-mail address when you fill out a web form,  i.e.  <i>name+spam@gmail.com</i>, and Gmail will sort your incoming spam using that address into that folder for you.  Of course, you have to create one or two folders and rename them however you wish and just don't forget to add the <b>plus sign</b> before it. i.e. <i>+basura, </i> or <i>+not-so-lame-a-duck!</i> teehee. 

Another thing you can do is to create another e-mail. The host suggested a couple of sites...

<a href=""http://www.dodgeit.com"">DodgeIt.com</a>  allows you to make up an anonymous e-mail address. <i>name@dodgeit.com</i>

<a href=""http://www.hushmail.com"">HushMail.com</a> is a free encrypted e-mail service. Make sure you write down your password though because according to the host, there is no way for you to retrieve it if you forget it. Apparently they won't send it to you. Ever.


Also, Brandon, from the same show,  featured a few of the 2005 winners of the South By SouthWest Web Awards. I'm pretty sure you'll get a kick out of it, so go and check it out. It's truly FLASHtopia!

In the immutability of our surroundings, we live only in a flicker. Each spun thread is a beginning or an end of something which is slowly weaved in the process into a promise, perhaps, of finally unveiling the naked face of fate - the mistress of your existence.

So, there are days like today when all you want to do is to keep moving. It doesn't really matter what it is - running errands, cleaning, organizing, re-organizing, picking up laundry and making sure that everything is washed and dried on the same day - because you hate <i>that</i> smell on your clothes when you forget and leave a load sitting in the washer for a couple of days and not to mention the wrinkles on your shirt and pants - because you hate ironing your clothes. 

The impetus gives you the fortitude that you need and somehow a sense of... balance. Stillness in motion. What a concept! Yes, a sort of tight rope act where on one side you carry a load of a couple of thoughts running heavily in your mind, and to avoid the burden of altogether tipping you over, you work it off with chores and other things you can think of doing. At dead center, you bear the weight with some ounce of placidity hoping against hope that you are able to librate yourself with ease, as you make that brave step forward as steady as possible. For you, it's not necessarily ""Nirvana"" you are aiming for  but a certain sense of quiet conviction that assures you all will be well today.

I miss lola.
I miss dad.
I miss <i>me</i> when I was with them - yesterday.
I miss the days before that visit at the doctor's office 2 weeks ago.

I know that things will never ever be the same again. I do not hope it would be for that would only mean.... well, a kind of suicide. Yes, exactly. The propensity to play out a beautiful intermezzo captured in the exquisite rhapsody of the moment is forever lost, and the secret of that moment awaiting to be unraveled is lost with it. And what about everything you absolutely love? Chocolate, cuddles, kisses, arguing, conversations, delicious transgressions, laughter, books, films, from ever holding her hand again, and JAZZ. Ah, yes! I don't think there's Jazz in hell.

So you go on. You keep moving. Go, going, gone with each passing of the season. One day you'll answer your door and you'll see <i>you</i> again - a bit more older, maybe a bit more wiser, perhaps a bit more happier and at peace. You'll invite yourself over for a cocktail and say, <i>""Drink, my friend. That was one helluva ride! Salud!"""

"event","It must have been around three in the morning when I went to bed. I was glad that I did not have to worry about waking up in a few hours to get ready for work, tired as I was yesterday. 

Over the past year, I noticed that I have acquired a number of new quirks - idiosyncrasies that have mingled with my existing temperament. One, specifically, is that I find it quite odd that I have this strong need to leave the lamplight on all night while I sleep. I am not likely to be won over the subject of ghosts and goblins lurking in the dark now that I'm all grown up, and at my age, that does not constitute as a valid fear factor. Now something like... my credit card statement next month, DOES. (oh! what horrible imaginings! *laughs*). 

Perhaps then, it is because I seem to grow acutely aware of the swift passage of time as I grow older. Even before I go to bed at night my consciousness has already shifted and set to tomorrow's workload and activities, and sleep becomes more and more like a chore, another activity -the first item to check off from my things-to-do list for the next day. 

In her published journal, Sylvia Plath wrote, <i>""And so it is that childlike sensitivity to new experiences and sensations seems to diminish in an inverse proportion to the growth of technical ability. As we become polished, so do we become hardened and guilty of accepting eating, sleeping, seeing, and hearing too easily and lazily, without question. We become blunt and callous and blissfully passive as each day adds another drop to the stagnant well of our years.""</i>

I can relate to what she wrote but I think.... I am getting old.

In its pure form, capitalism is a social system characterized by individual freedom, diversity, and dynamism. It is a system that treats people as individuals, with no ethnic, religious, or other collective principle enshrined in the law. It is the system under which each of us makes his own choices and must take responsibility for his own life and happiness. It is the system in which long-term peace and unbounded prosperity are possible, if people will work for them. As Ayn Rand said, <i>""Economically, humans flourish through production and trade, as is evident from the fact that the freest countries are either the richest countries or are getting rich most quickly.""</i> She goes on to say that <i>"" it is the system of separation of economy and state, just as there is separation of church and state, and for the same essential reason: because each person has a right to think and to live as his own conscience dictates, and because we all benefit from everyone having that freedom.""</i>

Since the dawn of the Enlightenment, liberty in America has rested on the political philosophy of John Locke to a degree unequaled in any other country, even Great Britain. (By contrast, liberty in continental Europe has rested on a political philosophy rooted in medieval Christendom, secularized by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and radicalized by romanticism and socialism.)

Anyway.

According to Locke's political philosophy, each person has three purposes built into his nature: (1) to survive; (2) to survive by means of society; and (3) to promote that society by which he survives. Liberty is thus based on the attempt to live and to do this together, socially. That is what establishes the need for, and the limits to, freedom.

Locke, held that production and trade are what government and liberty are for. It is an extremely bourgeois concept of liberty. Each person's survival is an end in itself-but only to himself, not to others. It is from the collaborative pursuit of individual survival via production and trade that there arises a system of mutually respected rights. 

Even if that means the death of many, including our own? And how many more lives need be sacrificed in this <i>collaborative pursuit</i>? I may not be an expert but I think that the moral realm which embodies these very basic principles and action 
<b>IS</b> 
ALTOGETHER 
LOST 
IN 
IT'S 
OWN 
IRONY.

<b>There shouldn't be and there can be no compromise on the nature of rights because they are based on the conditions of human life, and ultimately, any government that does not recognize them no longer serves its own purpose.</b> 

Richard Kahn writes, <i>""While the Western legal system cloaks itself in the trappings of rationality and enlightened justice, the simple truth is that law, of its own will and dynamic, does not generally evolve in order to better accord with ethics. Rather, the legislative system constantly changes within a contested terrain, where a wide range of interested parties struggle for power and position. The battle over policy is hardly evenly matched or wholly fair, for as dictated by the Golden Rule of capitalism, those with the gold make the rules. Increasingly, the powerful factions who drive the direction of legislation in this country are the secretive, well-protected, massive corporate entities that Noam Chomsky characterizes as 'private tyrannies'...""</i>

Just a thought."

"event","Sitting here right now and musing over what to write... since this is my first public entry in over a year or so... I'm compelled to write something witty or significant. But to tell you the truth, a would be narrative of recollections of my so called life these past several months doesn't even compare to the engrossing articles of, say Chomsky or Zinn about current events and important issues facing us now. You're really better off reading the news. It is History in it's most readable and enjoyable form, folks. Don't worry about me, I'm doing alright. I'm still neurotic as the next person roughing it out in the post i-can't-believe-bush-won-the-friggin'-election world we live in.

OK, on to ""The day at the movies""....

Earlier this afternoon, I called S and asked her if she wanted to watch a movie with me. I wanted to see ""Ray"" and she wanted to see ""After The Sunset"". I told her that I've already seen it and she replied that the one I wanted to see was too long. She was correct. ""Ray"" runs about 2 hrs and 45 mins. Yeah, okay! I give her that but I wasn't ready to back down that easily. 

<i>""But I've seen it already! Can we watch something else that we both have not seen yet?""</i> 

Hah! having said that, I knew I had it in the bag! That fastball was smooth and rhythmically delivered with maximum velocity and control. And just as I was about to gloat over the killer pitch,  the oncoming onslaught she hits me with was a counter strike Barry Bonds would be dreaming of for eternity. And, like all the women in history before her, she had to pull that ""i-wanna-watch-it-honey-pretty-please?-i-wuv-you"" stunt. Geez! Pathetic attempt to make anyone watch a movie twice. Haha! But that did it, of course. And let me tell you this fellas..she should be glad she's cute...to say the least. *winks*  

So, we met at the theater, and when we got to the stand to pay for the tickets, the attendant said that ""A.T.S"" wasn't available at the moment, they were having problems with the film earlier and gave us free passes to any movie we want to see and free popcorn. 

<i><b>I won't trade for anything the look on her face,</b> as I bursted out laughing at the seeming twist we found ourselves in and it's immediate aftermath. It was ""priceless"". She couldn't possibly make herself more adorable then, and come to think of it now, I'll watch ATS with her over and over again kung gusto nya. </i> 

Anyway, we opted to just watch the next movie scheduled for viewing at that time and ended up watching ""Saw"". It was good. We both liked it. It's a suspense thriller, and if you liked ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Seven"", or ""The Usual Suspects"",  you'ld probably like this one too. It's not as good as the former, but to quote Ebert, <i>""Saw"" is well made and acted, and does what it does about as well as it could be expected to.</i>

Cheerio!"

<u>First Log - 12:05 PM :</u> 

I didn't think too much of it until I gave KD a quick squeeze and muttered to her, <i>""it's going to be okay,""</i> before I handed her over to the staff. ( I must've been subconsciously telling myself that as well.) With an empathic look, perhaps sensing my nervousness,  Dr. Myrhom reassured me not to worry and said that they will take good care of her. And so I left and went back home.

KD is undergoing an ovario-hysterectomy* at the moment. 



Realizing it now, I think I was more anxious than I thought.  I found myself jumping on the treadmill and sprinting, as thoughts of a hundred and one things ran through my head with equal speed, if not more. And so I ran. And ran. And ran some more. Oblivious to time; if only to bridle the growing tide of anxiety that seemed to have overcome me. Oftentimes, the ""fear of the unknown"" throws you in a state of disequilibrium, leaving you trapped, not knowing what to do or not do, feeling completely out of your element. 

Afterwards, I dedided to get more information. I figured that that was something I could do and somehow compensate for that paralyzing ""lack of control"" feeling.  

----------

I found a couple of sites. The <a href=""http://www.canismajor.com/dog/spayneut.html""> first one</a> explains the surgical procedure in great detail. The <a href=""http://www.hsus.org/ace/11879""> second one's</a> from the American Humane Society, and the next is a <a href=""http://www.hsus.org/11823""> link </a> from the same site which lists some of the myths and facts that you might find interesting to read.

-------------


No calls yet from the clinic so far. God, I hope KD is okay. I have to say that it feels awfully strange not seeing her run around the house or hear that stupid, constant squeaking of her toy. Oh geez, I can't even begin to imagine not having her around <i>at all</i>. 




<u>Second And Final Log Of The Day - 11:57 PM:</u>

KD is alright. The surgery went well. We have to come back to the clinic, however, on the 10th  for the post-surgical check up and the removal of the sutures. 

I took a peek at her incision and it's about an inch and a half long. Ouch! 

 She is resting right now and I thought I'd sneak away for a few minutes to finish writing this entry. I picked her up at 4 pm and the poor thing looked as if she was aching all over and has hence been lying down most of the night. She has managed to have a bowel movement and has urinated twice already....which is always a good sign that she hasn't developed paralytic ileus from the anesthesia.  She has, however, only been drinking water and doesn't appear to have worked up an appetite quite yet. I'm just afraid that she may grow weaker since she has not had anything to eat since 10 pm last night. 

Hmmm, maybe i could entice her with a slice of cheese. She can have as many as she wants. Heck, she can have all of it.

1.  You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and

2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you
    feel irresistable is creative, never let you feel bored.

3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is flexible.

4.  You don't like it when your partner is insecure.

5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your
    partner is that both of you can talk about everything and
    anything, no secret is kept.

6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything
    wrong after marriage.

7.  You think of marriage as a precious thing.  Once you get married,
    you'll treasure it and your partner very much.

"event","I stood out of view as I watched her lying fast asleep on the sofa. My first thought was how I almost decided against taking her in. 

I can remember how anxious I was in the beginning. Much so that I postponed the hour long trip to Chester, Iowa  for one more day. I figured I could easily convince mom that the McKenna's  weren't available that day and besides it would be wise to get everything we needed in preparation for the homecoming. So after making a call to mom and the breeders, I proceeded to print out pages and pages of expository information, read and re-read everything while digesting the reality of the adoption and what it entailed.

<i>""It's a commitment.""</i>  I remember E saying over the phone.
<i>""Christ! Am I ready for this?""</i> I wondered.
<i>""Well, how bad could it be? It's almost a year now and Zeus is still alive!""</i> 

I started to laugh at the seeming antiphon and realized that my growing reluctance was merely stemming from pure indolence. Zeus, my pet Betta, never really did require much handling and care - apart from his daily feedings and water treatments. He's all set after that, looking all regal and pretty without a care in the world, gliding exquisitely with each velvet ripple in the small confines of his glass universe. Ahhh... I'm afraid I'm going out on a tangent here. I just love that lil' bugger too!  *chuckles  Heniwey.

So, after muddling through human and animal traffic at a local pet store, I got everything on the list. From her puppy chow to her toys (got a lil' bit carried away with her toys though. tee hee I wasn't quite sure exactly what to get so I got her a motley of rubber ones that squeaks, vinyl, canvas, and tennis balls.) When mom arrived, she also brought home some more puppy chow, a pillow bed, which is perfect for the kennel I got her; another collar, another set of food and water bowls, and more toys! =)  She found a Vet. for her too, recommended by Sandy, mom's co-worker and a close friend. 

Together we set up her kennel at the other living room downstairs and puppy-proofed the whole house.  

Over dinner, mom and I had a nice talk and I briefed her as well about a few things regarding the adoption and care. She asked if I already had a name in mind and I nodded in confirmation. <b>""Kaddua,""</b> I said. It means <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/demonyonggala/day/2002/09/29""><b>""Companion""</b></a>

<i>""Kaddua...I like it,""</i> she said. And went on to say that we could call her ""KD"" for short. I smiled and nodded in approval. <i>""Sounds good, mom!</i> She then headed off to lola's and reminded me to stop by at her work the following day, as soon as I get back to town.

 Before I went to bed that night, I took one more glance at her kennel with all her toys in place, and smiled. 

Here she is, guys.

<center><b><font size=""+3"" color=""pink"" face="" Garamond, Times New Roman"">Kaddua</b></font></center>

It's been 2 weeks since we've had her. She's been quite a handful but definitely a burst of sushine for both mom and I. She's the most adorable lil' thing I've ever laid my eyes on and mom and I have been in love with her ever since her arrival.  

<center><img src=""http://webpages.charter.net/eccentric_woman74/kadduanmom""></center>


KD is a tri-colored (black, tan, and white) female Beagle and she'll be 14 weeks old tomorrow. She loves Doritos and cheese and always loves to play. ( God, i swear she's tireless!) She doesn't like car rides though. But that will change. She just needs to get used to it. Same goes for her baths. haha! 
 Her favorite toy is a pink rubber ball that squeaks when pressed and  ""Ube,"" a small stuffed bunny, which I'm afraid has borne the brunt of her chewing spree. (the bunny's nose is hanging by a few threads. hell, it might not even be there anymore! *LOL) 
She makes this puppy grunts everytime she's cuddled and her belly rubbed, and does this head tilt when you call her name or talk to her. sooo cute! She's had quite a few accidents ( pooch poops ) already but that is to be expected. Not encouraged inside the house, of course, but expected. We're just waiting for her last vaccination to be completed and then she's off to puppy pre-school ( which is mostly socializing with other dogs and learning basic commands) and then later on, obedience school, where she'll get more rigid training."

<font color=""silver"" face=""Garamond, Courier""><blockquote>REAL LIFE TEETERS between comedy and drama, so it's no surprise that Woody Allen's best films - the ones that confront serious truths with wisecracks and whimsy - tap into the rhythm of the everyday. Annie Hall focuses on the tortured relationship between two terminally neurotic New Yorkers, Alvy Singer (Allen) and Annie Hall (Keaton). Perhaps it's so real because the cycle of emotions that Alvy and Annie experience, as they change and drift apart and withdraw back into their insecurities, is something that we've all experienced. With his unique brand of sharply observed and wistful dramedy, Allen perfectly captures the pain of a fractured relationship. </blockquote>

There's a line that Alvy says in the end of the movie. It's actually another joke he relays to explain the turbulence of his relationship:

<b><i>""This guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, 'Doc, uh, my brother's crazy, he thinks he's a chicken,' and uh, the doctor says, 'Well why don't you turn him in?' And the guy says, 'I would, but I need the eggs.' Well, I guess that's pretty much now how I feel about relationships. You know, they're totally irrational and crazy and absurd and, but uh, I guess we keep going through it...because...most of us need the eggs.""</i></b>

it's so nice to know that Joy's doing okay, apart from her postpartum pains and all (ouwee yon! shucks), and that she finally had Mico. the kid was such in a hurry to get out and see the world  that poor Joy had to have an emergency c-section. <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=manangjoy&itemid=41608""><i>click here to read a brief account.</i></a>   i'm really so happy for her. =)

so far,  this year,  2 of my friends are mommies now.  Happy and <lj user=""manangjoy"">, while Debbie is due naman on august. 

i can only imagine how it would feel like to have a child of your own. i've actually thought about it in the past,   and lately,  it seems that whenever  i see Kayla,  dunno,  just can't seem to help steal her away from her mom or whoever is carrying her. I get a kick out of seeing  her tiny hand wrapped around my finger, and oddly enough i catch myself making that funny-googoo-babytalk just to see her smile and giggle. Hahaha... at grabe din umiyak! she belts out this loud cry, matataranta ka.  i remember all five of us (barkada), unanimous in our votes and teasing Happy... ""like mother like daughter.""  parehong spoiled brats paglaki!  LOL  pero, you know what though? it's really something to see how great she is with K. we're all so proud of her.

i don't know if i'll ever have one of my own. i think the closest thing i'll ever get to being a mommy would probably be as a godmother, an aunt to my nephews and nieces, or sharing the responsibility of raising a child/children with my partner  --granted, of course,  she decides to have one or she already has a kid from a previous marriage or relationship. it's cool. works for me! <i>*chuckles </i> although, down the road i may change my mind and decide to have one anyway. who knows really? and if  ever i do,  i'd like to have a boy and  i'd name him  <i>""Sidney.""</i> Sidney... hmmm,i've always liked that name.

there is a song playing in my head right now....

<blockquote><i>"" hey you, 
you're a child in my head
you haven't walked yet
your first words have yet to be said...

i know you're still just a dream
your eyes might be green
or the bluest that I've ever seen...

i'll pick a star from the sky
pull your name from a hat...
and you, 
you'll have the best
i promise you 
i promise you that....you'll be blessed""</i></blockquote>"

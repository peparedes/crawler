"event","""I know the pieces fit cause I watched them fall away""&nbsp; - Tool

We witness pieces that fall out of the puzzle everyday.&nbsp; We see friendships fall apart, broken families, poverty-stricken areas, and an HIV/AIDS epidemic claim the lives of millions. But do the pieces all indeed fit? Did they at one point fit together? I mean, it's easy to imagine broken friendships and families that were once harmonious, but the pieces of impoverished countries and the AIDS epidemic...did those ever fit together to create one giant peaceful whole? And just because we 'watched [the pieces] fall away', does that mean that they can be made to fit back together so that they won't fall? Is everything connected in world? Is there one underlying cause beneath all the pain, anger, and strife in the world? Some say money, some say egos, some say greed...do we really know what we're up against? I read in the papers that the two Bill's...Bill Clinton and Bill Gates...are pushing to put the AIDS epidemic at the top priority for governments and the UN funding. What are they intending to fund? Any funding will only temporarily MAYBE put a tiny DENT in the number of HIV+ people in third world countries. What these people with lots of money and power are forgetting to see, is the bigger picture - a giant puzzle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Authority&nbsp;issues,&nbsp;disease outbreaks, societal 'norms', behavioural problems...all of these things are mere pieces that make up one grand scheme - rooted in&nbsp;corporations,&nbsp;the ego, avarice, and above all, thirst for money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I don't know, maybe i'm just...over-analyzing things...cause we all know that happens a lot *heh*&nbsp;

buuuuuuttt...then again...maybe things need to be over-analyzed dumdumdum (but then it fact it wouldn't be called ""over""-analyzed because if that's what needed to be done then it'd just be plain ol' analyzing...but that's another story =D)"

"event","People who are cynical have a reason for being that way.&nbsp; There is always something behind peoples' behaviours.&nbsp; Think about it. Someone is mannerly because their parents taught them how to be; a person is a rapist because they were molested as a child...the examples are endless.&nbsp; People can't just be cynical for no reason.&nbsp; There's no logic to it. Either something annoys them about the thing being criticized, or something has made them not like it...a past experience maybe.&nbsp; Don't hate those who hate. Those who hate have a reason for it.&nbsp; This gets into the whole capital punishment argument.&nbsp;Do people who kill&nbsp;have a reason for it? If they do, then is it right to let them be killed for their actions? What if the man who killed another was subjected to abuse when he was young? Sure he decides his own actions, but if his father abused him when he was younger, and made him the way he was today...then isn't the father to blame just as much as the man who killed?&nbsp; Why shouldn't the father be&nbsp;undergo&nbsp;capital&nbsp;punishment for making the killer who&nbsp;he is? Why&nbsp;aren't there stricter laws against abuse, and neglect?&nbsp;If we got rid of these things, then I&nbsp;will be willing to bet my bottom dollar that&nbsp;crime rates will&nbsp;decrease drastically.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&nbsp;criminals&nbsp;are&nbsp;criminals for three general reasons: 1)&nbsp;Someone else&nbsp;has affected their life in such a negative way, that their morality and&nbsp;conscience becomes warped...making them think and&nbsp;behave outside the norm; 2) They&nbsp;are desperate; 3) They truly are insane.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although abuse can be&nbsp;a hard thing to prove in the court of law, if substantial evidence is provided, then the abuser should be subjected to stricter punishment than they receive.&nbsp; After all,&nbsp;they are responsible for the birth of a potential criminal...not to mention that it's wrong on so many levels.

"event","I went through a whole lot of quotes for to go underneath my grad picture in the yearbook.  All of them had to do with success and life and happiness and kindness...all of them were cheesy.  Some unbearably cheesy.  As I was reading them I was getting more and more frustrated.  Who are these people to tell me how to live my life? ""Only though action will one succeed"", ""A thought that stays a thought is not intelligent""...who cares? A thought is a thought.  It's my choice whether to leave it a thought or not.  Just because a thought remains a thought does not reflect any bit of my intelligence...maybe my thought was meant to stay a thought.  Maybe my thought shouldn't become an action, for if it does it will reflect stupidity and not intelligence.  Sure success does not come through money, it comes through legitimate happiness...but what if happiness is brought about through money? Go ask a poor guy if he's happy...see what he says.  If the poor guy says he's happy, then the maybe he needs some mental help, for it is not normal for anyone in that drab of a situation to be elated. Everybody needs money to live and to succeed whether they like it or not.  Again, what is success? Social success obviously involves an income, but what about spiritual success? Is that brought about through money? After all, the bible does recommend that Christians tithe, and give, (what is it, 10%?) of their income to the church.  So you don't have money do donate...does that make you any less of a Christian? But you're not following the bible! Is that committing a sin? Can Christians only tithe with money, or can they donate other services to the Church instead? 
In the end, everybody needs money to acheive success. Yes, yes, it's a horrible thought and notion, but it's also reality.  Without money, people will be unhappy. So don't tell me, fricken grad quote, that success is brought about through action! No money = no action! No action = no success! It's that simple."

Isn't it weird how things change? One minute everything is going right, and then the next...it's like, ""where'd it go?"" What are we supposed to do in a situation like that? Are we supposed to roll with the punches? Are we supposed to long for what was there, but never will be again? Is there any harm in missing what you had? Is there any harm in finding the good in what's to come? 

Why is it that when people are faced with a sudden change in their lives, they automatically think the worst? Sure the glass is half empty...but don't forget that it's half full too. Shit happens. The only thing left to do is to deal. One of the best pieces of advice that I have ever heard came from the movie ""Frida"".  Frida says to her husband, ""Everybody is stronger than they think"", and how true she is! I never really realized how true she was until I witnessed others go through hardships and see them pick themselves up even when I thought it was impossible for them to do so.  People, myself included,  have one common perception: when something comes along and puts a bump in our road, the only thing to do is to close our eyes and hope for the best. I say: jump over it for God's sake! Pick yourself up! Life isn't so bad! It could be worse! We aren't starving, poor, and homeless like those kids in the third world countries! We are damn lucky!

"event","<P><EM>The old Roman Catholic missal contained a prayer which begged for tears.&nbsp; That must strike us as strange, especially if we are males who were told as children that ""big boys don't cry."" And here is the Church praying for the gift of tears! Why?</EM></P>
<P><EM>What the ancient prayer did was ask God to strike at the hardness of our unfeeling hearts and bring forth a flood of saving tears.&nbsp; The tearless are the hard of heart who will not see God.&nbsp; One of the most striking and moving comments about Jesus in the Gospel was: ""He wept"" (Luke 19:41).&nbsp; He felt the pain of other human beings as he felt his own, and he cried.&nbsp; A grown man, a courageous and strong-willed man, and he wept.&nbsp; This weeping Jesus bears witness against us. The point here, of course, is not the literal volume of tears shed, but the degree of caring in one's heart.&nbsp; </EM></P>
<P><EM>Our sin at times is the ability to stand amid evil with dry eyes.&nbsp; Through no fault of theirs, black women in the United States are three times more likely to die in childbirth and twice as likely to see their babies die during the first year of life, and the eyes of many Americans are dry.&nbsp; Eight hundred million people go to bed hungry every night - most of these children - and we slumber peacefully with no tears upon our pillows.&nbsp; More than a billion dollars a day are spent on weapons...while children starve, and we are not moved to tears. </EM></P>
<P><EM>...The purpose of my grim comments is not to overwhelm anyone with a terrible sense of guilt for not ""saving"" the worldor to saddle any individual with exclusive responsibility for all its massive problems. Even Jesus did not succeed in wiping out all the social evils of his day.&nbsp; But he cared and did whatever he could - helping and speaking out for the needy whenever possible - in a spirit of love and joy.&nbsp; The reason for sharpening our sense of social guilt is not to paralyze ourselves with self-condemnation but to prompt us to care - and do what we can in view of our station in life and other responsibilites. </EM></P>

<P>Christmas is approaching soon.&nbsp; Kids are applying their newly-found writing skills, and every bit of intellect they have in their undeveloped brains....all to write a ""What I Want For Christmas"" list, or to write a letter to Santa.&nbsp; Siblings and parents are rushing around to buy thier brother/sister/kids the ""perfect"" gift.&nbsp; It's a season of ""giving."" Prices don't matter - as long as the receiver of the gift is happy.&nbsp; Gotta buy something for the grandparents, the cousins, the aunts, the uncles,&nbsp;the friends, the parents, the siblings,&nbsp;the co-workers, the guy at Starbucks who knows your&nbsp;""usual"" drink, the bus&nbsp;driver....anybody and everybody.&nbsp; ""I want a digital&nbsp;camera"", ""I want a new hockey stick"",&nbsp;""I want a t.v.""&nbsp;""I want a computer"", ""I want a cell phone"".&nbsp; &nbsp; </P>
<P>In the midst of our busy lives right now, we all should stop and think, and I mean REALLY think....outside the box.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are families whose kids wake up and find no gifts underneath the tree.&nbsp; There are parents who&nbsp;don't even bother going to the mall because they know that if they go, their hopelessness will be brought&nbsp;down to&nbsp;a whole new level since they can't&nbsp;afford anything.&nbsp; There are kids who don't&nbsp;even have a tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some kids are not even&nbsp;priviledged to&nbsp;comprehend the ""reality"" of Santa, since some parents don't want to disappoint their kids when Santa doesn't come.&nbsp;So they don't bother to tell them.&nbsp; That may be considered ""thinking outside the box"", but I ask of you to think on an even wider scale.&nbsp; People in China, Japan, Russia, Germany, Italy, Egypt, Iraq, Iran...they all celebrate Christmas, or some other form of ""gift-giving"".&nbsp; But in South Africa, South America, and other places, they don't even know what Christmas is.&nbsp; They don't know what Hannukah is.&nbsp; They don't know anything but working for 12 cents a day, eating next to nothing, and drinking dirty water.&nbsp; These third world countries don't have anything.&nbsp; By anything I mean NOTHING.&nbsp; They barely have clothes.&nbsp; There is no Santa.&nbsp; No elves.&nbsp; No Frosty the Snowman. Nothing.&nbsp; December 24 is just another day.&nbsp; In fact, when you look at Christmas at this level, the people in Canada who have no money for Christmas are doing pretty good.&nbsp; That's how sad it is.&nbsp; &nbsp; </P>
<P>I write this not to bring feelings of guilt when buying or receiving gifts.&nbsp; I write this so that we all can really appreciate and thank the Good Lord just for being born in such good families, with good lives, and the fact that we were live in Canada, a first world country.&nbsp; I do not write this so that you return all of your gifts because they were too expensive, or because you feel bad.&nbsp; We are fortunate to live in such good circumstances, I feel that we should take advantage of all that we have, and do purchase gifts for each other. But I ask you to do so with consideration.&nbsp; Don't rub it in.&nbsp; Don't overdo it.&nbsp; Don't spoil.&nbsp; Spoiling is a form of greed...avarice...selfishness...because when you spoil another person, you rub it in everybody else's faces.&nbsp; Not just other friends and family members, but it is an insult to those who have nothing.&nbsp; ""Who cares? They won't know!""&nbsp;But I know.&nbsp; But other people know.&nbsp;The people in third world countries know.&nbsp; Kids who live in underdeveloped countries go to bed and tell their parents how they dream of a far-away land where almost everybody has money.&nbsp; Do you really think that if parents who live in underdeveloped countries knew that a places like Canada, the US, and other developed - or overdeveloped for that matter- countries existed...do you think that they would tell their children?&nbsp; Would you tell your child and fill them with hope, only to be disappointed and resentful that they can't live in a place like we do? </P>
<P>So please, I ask of everybody...this Christmas, really be aware.&nbsp; Don't feel guilty, as Christmas is a time that you spend with family and friends, celebrating the birth of Christ, and just the fact that you are all together.&nbsp; Be generous, kind, and don't think twice about giving.&nbsp; I ask you to think about those who are poor in Hamilton, Ontario, and Canada for that matter, but please don't forget about those outside of Canada who have it even worse.&nbsp; We must not forget about these people...too many people are beginning to forget.&nbsp; Too many people are not paying attention to the world outside of their own,&nbsp;and in doing so, cause the victims of inaction even more suffering and progress an already drab living condition to one that is almost impossible to live in.&nbsp;As Christians, as humans, it is our responsibility -obligation for some- to think of the other...especially this Christmas.&nbsp;Not to weep for those poor, dying, starving people is a sin. Do more than weep. </P>"

"event","Every aspect of grade 12 is different from any other year of highschool. Suddenly things change.  The tables turn.  Doing homework is no longer on a ""how bored am I"" basis, it's now on a ""I need to get into university"" basis.  The homework isn't just homework.  It's assignment after assignment after test after quiz after assignment.  Reading a lab over the night before suddenly becomes very important this year.  Actually working on things ahead of time is key to remaining relatively stress-free this year.  There IS stress this year.  Marks count now.  I have to try. No more slacking.  What scares me is that the years to come are not going to be any easier. Those days are OVER. I can't NOT do anything anymore. There really is always homework. 

This is going to be a hell of a year. I can tell."

"event","We live in a society ruled by superficiality, power, and most of all, lies.  The 70's was the hippie generation.  The 80s rock n roll.  The 90s...I'm not too sure.  What will our generation be known as?  Suddenly words like, ""terrorism"", ""vengeance"", ""hate"", ""crime"", and ""belligerence"" all enter my mind.  Have these violent times influenced our culture in ways, which we are still coming to realize?  Are the behaviours of the North American society fuelled by these changing times? Is the media responsible for our angst-filled teenagers?  

Something must be wrong.  Generations before ours rarely dealt with the issue we deal with regularly today - high school shootings, suicide bombings, terrorist threats - will it ever end?  Will we ever stop and finally realize what we are doing to ourselves, or are we just going to keep on slowly destroying each other until all life reaches its own demise? Scary thought isn't it?  Why is it that we are so quick to act on emotions such as anger, revenge, and hate, but act so slowly when it comes to emotions like love, compassion, and empathy?  Are these positive emotions not just as strong as the others? In fact, aren't they in a higher demand?  Why are we so eager to hurt ourselves? I'm not just talking a general picture, but even individually...does it not seem that everyone is just out to hurt themselves?  Does it not seem that people too, are turning a blind eye to fierce realities that hit them right square in the head? Why is it that issues such as world hunger, homelessness, and poverty take so long to acted upon, but issues such as bombing other countries, and killing those of a foreign religion are acted upon almost immediately?  

What has the world come to today?  Whatever happened to peace, love, and prosperity?  What happened to feeding the hungry, curing the sick, clothing the naked, and sheltering the homeless?  We are a people who act on impulse, and emotion. We act before we think.  When we do think, it's only about how I can benefit from my decision, not caring about anyone else.  

No matter how much money we donate, or how much food we offer, the poverty, hunger, and homelessness will never go away. Unless we all act TOGETHER.  As a community.  

And I am led back to Cain's famous words, ""Am I my brother's keeper?"" (Genesis 4.9)"

"event","I read somewhere that we should all listen to music in which makes us feel happy, makes us smile and upbeat...and that all other music that makes us angry, sad, upset, anxious, or any other negative feelings is bad music and should not be listened to.  I beg to differ.  Sure, it's good to listen to music with a catchy beat and makes us dance; but what kind of music is music that doesn't stir our emotions? Sometimes we need music to get out our anger, fears, and well...tears.  If someone isn't letting their emotions out otherwise, then is this music not a blessing to them rather than a curse?  

Then again, the book is also true in some cases.  I think that if your music influences your behaviours, then you definitely should not be listening to that music (unless of course, you're dancing =D).

Does your music define you?  

or

Does it add to what you already are?

So, identical twins are genetic copies of each other.  Right? Let's say that the twins are two girls.  If one girl is married and has kids, then do her kids also have another mother....the other twin?  They have the same genetic makeup.  Yes yes I realize that the biological mother obviously helped raise the kid, and the kid also has a different father, but still...isn't that a bit weird how the kid could actually have two moms?  According to Psychology Today, an identical twin sister feels like the other sister's kids are her own, whereas fraternal twins don't feel the same way.  Pretty weird huh?

"event","<P>Highschool in itself is like one giant soap opera.&nbsp; I don't mean with everything that goes on between the students, but I mean just with the whole&nbsp;social structure of the school in itself.&nbsp; Here, let me&nbsp;show you what&nbsp;I mean.&nbsp;</P>
<P>First, we have most of the grade nines, divided into two main groups. </P>
<P>1) The first group of grade nines is the one which most SHOULD fall into (but of course we always have to have those who don't fall into this category), and this include those who are very nervous, since they are going into a new school where things are run very differently.&nbsp; They realize that they are at the bottom of the barrell, and try to stay out of the way of the older kids.&nbsp; We like these kids. haha!</P>
<P>2) The second group of the grade nines are the ones that almost nobody can stand.&nbsp; That's right. The cocky, self-absorbed, I-just-graduated-from-grade-8-and-I-own-the-school kids.&nbsp; Now these kids, they walk around with their heads high, and try so hard to fit in.&nbsp; They literally act like they own the school.&nbsp; They try to be cool, because I mean really, cool is the only way to be *rolls eyes*.&nbsp; These grade nines just graduated from grade 8 where they were at the top of the school, and they still haven't gotten off their high horses yet.&nbsp; I think it's all a sharade to mask their own insecurities.&nbsp; </P>
<P>*sigh* - gotta love those grade nines.</P>
<P>Then, we have the grade tens.</P>
<P>Ohh the grade tens.&nbsp; You see, they just graduated from grade 9, where they were looked down upon.&nbsp; Since they got through the first year, and everyone seemed to ridicule them, now they think it's THEIR turn to ridicule the new grade nines.&nbsp;They act like they own the school too. Maybe even more than the grade nines.&nbsp; There are some smart grade 10s though, that realize how they felt in grade nine, and empathize with the new-comers of the school.&nbsp; I find that grade 10s are more relaxed academically, and socially.&nbsp; Everyone's individuality seems to come out in grade ten.</P>
<P>Haha grade elevens.</P>
<P>Grade eleven was the BEST year ever!! Most grade elevens just don't care. They don't go shopping the day before a civies day, and don't care about what other people think about their hair, or whether they wear sweatpants or skin-tight jeans on civies days.&nbsp; Grade elevens just look at the grade nines and shake their heads saying, ""I was never like that!"" (suuure we weren't ;) ) I find that grade elevens are pretty stable.&nbsp; Most know who they are, what they stand for, and what they want to do with their life (there are many exceptions though!!).&nbsp; I like grade elevens. </P>
<P>Last but certainly not least, the grade twelves.</P>
<P>The grade twelves literally own the school.&nbsp; Their way or the highway.&nbsp; They,&nbsp;(well I guess I should say We) are all interested in having the greatest time ever in their last year.&nbsp; We are all buckling down and focusing on school, because let's face it...if we don't do well, then some of us won't get into the university/college of choice.</P>
<P>So there it is.&nbsp; STM in a nutshell.&nbsp; A very big, broad nutshell may I add.&nbsp; You know, even though all of the different grades act so differently, and you can tell who is in which grade by just looking at them, we all still manage to work together.&nbsp; Sure there are many quarrells between kids of different grades, but all in all, we all tend to get along and adapt, accept, and live with each other.&nbsp; Kind of like a big fan-dam-ly (that was family in Wegner lingo). </P>
<P>That's all for today.</P>
<P>[into the corner]</P>
<P>p.s. - I'm just warning everybody, that these are generalizations of the grade levels, there are obviously those who do not apply to any of the...preconceived notions. </P>"

"event","You know what the problem is with society today? ""No but I have a feeling you're going to tell me."" Damn straight I'm going to tell you! It's like people don't know how to react anymore.  Like people are confused as to whether they can or can't control the outcome of a situation.  I think that everybody needs a HUGE reality check.  I'm not saying I'm not one of the people who needs it...I find myself guilty of being a victim of my emotions from time to time too.

Okay, here's an example of what I'm talking about.  So...you're at your friend's house, and it turns out that your friend is totally pissing you off. She keeps on bugging you, bringing up past arguments, and is just picking fights every which way. You come home steaming mad because really, how could your friend be so cruel? So, you hop on the phone ASAP and call one of your other friends and vent to them saying, ""They made me soooo mad, and now I'm just so grumpy I don't know what to do with myself.""  

There's the problem right there.  ""They made me soooo mad..."" How can someone MAKE you mad?  Sure they piss you off, but is it not, essentially your decision on how you react to their insults?  

We have to stop blaming other people for our moods.  Someone else cannot make you mad, sad, or even happy.  If you are angry, it's YOUR fault, and only yours.  It is you in the morning who determines whether you will have a bad or a good day.  You are responsible for your mood. Nobody else is.  

This is called PROACTIVITY, people! It means focusing only on things in which you CAN control, like your own morals and principles, and letting THEM be at the core of your being.  It means realizing your crappy moods, and flipping them around.  It means living your life in accordance to what YOU believe, not what someone else makes you believe.

On the flip side, there are those who are REACTIVE.  They think with their emotions.  They will fly off the handle if something happens.  They let other things - things in which they can't control - make up the core of their being.  They are grumpy if you are grumpy.  

Okay, so this proactive and reactive stuff sounds a little cheesy, and I can't take all the credit because I got it from a brilliant book by Sean Covey. But the first part was mine! haha! Anyway, I thought I'd enlighten you all with a good piece of reading.

Think about it.&nbsp; If everyone strives to be ""normal"", then aren't they essentially conforming to something else? </P>
<P>I remember having a conversation, or an argument rather, with a friend who labels himself as a goth about conformity.&nbsp; He said that because of the way he dressed, and because of the music he listened to, he was different from society.&nbsp; He claimed to be rebelling against all those who are considered ""normal"".&nbsp; Okay, so he's right.&nbsp; He is different from everybody else. BUT (and there's always a but) in rebelling against simplicty, is he not, in turn, conforming with another group in society - that is the goths?&nbsp;We argued about this for about a good half hour, and really, both our arguments were so strong we got absolutely nowhere.&nbsp; I have not talked to him since then.&nbsp; </P>

Working with all of these different people and dealing with different personality types has taught me many things, but everything roots from this one thing that I discovered.  I found that sometimes, people really just need someone to listen to them.  I'm not talking selective listening (listening only to what I want to hear), pretend listening (saying, 'yeah, okay' and not meaning it), i'm talking the real thing.  I cannot begin to count the number of times mothers have come to me, and just sat and talked. I don't say much, I just nod and ask questions about what they're talking about.  It's like they sit and tell me their whole life story for the half an hour they're there...almost as if they've never told it before. It's like they tell me things because nobody else will listen.

You could be up and about going shopping with your mom (does anybody else's mom go shopping at like 9am? haha), or going for a nice morning walk (i love morning walks), or maybe just getting up and chilling in front of the TV.  It's better than sleeping.

I know I haven't bothered to post anything for the longest time, so I thought that I might as well say something just for old time's sake.  The subject of this post, is:   (drum roll please)   a story!! I wrote it while at work when I was all alone =(  It's really cheesy, but the kids seemed to love it.  So here it is.  It's called, ""A DARK TALE FROM THE DEEP JUNGLE""  - by THE WEGNER

     There I was.  Left all alone on an unknown island.  Why did the plane crash?  What made it descend 50 000 feet in almost 2 minutes?  Whatever the case, I'm glad that I'm alive.  I crawl out of my ever so familiar cabin - or at least what's left of it - and step into the hot sand.  No sign of any other survivors.  Where am I?  We seemed to have crashed on an island somewhere in the vicinity of Japan.  Or at least I hope so.  I walk across the white sand, scared, confused, and not knowing what to do.  My stomach grumbles.  Food!  I realize that I should start with the thing that I know best - food!  I make my way into the vast forest before me, grabbiung a long stick for protection on my way.  I carefully enter through a small opening in the brush, placing my every footstep with utmost care - I don't want to disturb anything in this huge jungle.  As I'm looking for and hint of fruit some of these mysterious trees might hinder, I notice something rustle in the trees behind me.  I jerk around quickly and my fear has taken control of all my movements.  I hear the rustling again, but this time it's louder.  Stick at the ready, I step closer to the now violently shaking bush.  I poke through the leaves with the end of my stick , and I feel it touch something.  Something big.  The rustling stops, and I hear cracking twigs as the ""thing"" turns around to face me.  When I get a good look at the creature, my breath escapes me, and it feels as if my insides were turned inside out.  I step back while keeping my eyes on the giant creature.  It is about 7 feet tall with huge sharp teeth, and it has what appears to be the head of a lion, but the body of a tiger.  I have heard of these rare creatures before on the news.  They are called ""ligers"" and apparently aren't very friendly to humans.  Stepping out of the bush, the giant liger sticks it enormous nose in the air and sniffs around.  It looks at me with an agressive look in its eye.  It circles around me keeping both eyes locked upon my own.  When it comes back around in front of me, it stops.  The liger moves closer.  1 step. 2 steps. 3 steps.  Until I can smell the horrific stench of its strong breath.  Neither of us move for what seems an eternity.  The liger slowly, surely, raises its intimidating paw, and I cower down before it.  I see my life flash before my eyes.  It moves to strike, when suddenly, I hear a loud yelping from somewhere deep in the forest.  The liger turns around, completely forgetting about its prior engagement.  The liger had an almost scared look on his face as a man dressed in loin cloth comes swinging through the jungle yelling and yelping.  With a swift move, he swings from the highest tree, and kicks the liger out of the way.  That's enough inspiration for me! I take the opportunity to run away.  I run as fast as I can and leave the wild man to the liger.  I run back across the hot white sand, and jump into the salty ocean.  Realizing that being at the mercy of the dark sea water would be a safer choice than staying on this island, I hastily decide to attempt to swim back home.  I am swimming only for a few short minutes when suddenly, a thunderous voice barked from the heavens, ""Tommy! Come back into the house! You have spent enough time in the pool!"" 

The end.

=D I hope you all enjoyed my *short* story...and I hope you all have a good summer :D"

and she saw her mother.
Sally the Snail wanted to go sailing,
She slid on the boat,
She sat on the railing.
Sally the Snail decided to go home,
She was tired,
She felt so alone
So Sally the Snail had to go all the way back,
Back through the bay,
Back over the tracks.

She was going across the sidewalk

I haven't really been exposed to him enough to critique him.  People are all complaining about having a German Pope, when the former Pope John Paul II was Polish.  What's wrong with a German Pope? Who knows, maybe he'll make some changes for the better.  People are scared of change, and now Catholics are scared that this new authority will make lots of changes to the church.  I hope he does.  We need to change a lot of things - outlooks on women's role in the church, euthanasia, gay marriages for example.  

So, good luck Pope Benedict 16(?)! Glad to have ya!

"event","I wonder how some people could possibly be SO naive of the world around them.  I mean, not only the world around them, but the other people around them.  I'm no expert at reading other people, but sometimes their actions and words so obviously show how they feel...it's like a freaking sign saying, ""I LIKE YOU, BUT I'M ONLY SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE AND I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS"".  How can people not catch things like that? I mean, everybody does it.  Everybody tells somebody something -tells them a white lie- just to make them feel good.  Why is it so hard for us to accept when somebody is doing that to us? People are quick to tell white lies to others, but are so ignorant to figure out when others are doing it to them.  

Are white lies a good thing?  If you look like shit one day, do you want to be told that you look like shit, or do you want to be told you look amazing?  If your hair is a mess because you just woke up from a nap, do you want people say, ""fix your hair"" or do you want them to not say anything?  If you're wearing an outfit that makes you look fat, and you ask a friend, ""Does this make me look fat?"", do you want them to tell you the truth? If you're dying, but don't know about it, do you want your family to tell you that you are dying? 

It's funny how the world decides to take on the big controversies -abortion, euthanasia, the death penalty- but forget about the simple little ones that we experience every day.  The fact of the matter is that telling white lies are just as much a moral issue as abortion.  As euthanasia. As war.  Why are white lies looked upon as so little in society? With little meaning? They have the ability to ruin friendships, kill self-confidence, but then again, they also have the ability to secure friendships and self-confidence.  White lies are more powerful than people make them out to be.  Sometimes we have to open our eyes and ears and just listen to the daily ""normal"" things said in a conversation...you'll be surprised at how much stuff you hear everyday, but pay no REAL attention to.

"event","People ask me what kind of music I listen to.  I hesitate in answering ""progressive rock"".  Then I mention Dream Theater and Liquid Tension Experiment. I get the old, ""Riiiiight you're messed"" look. 

Listening to, and appreciating Dream Theater and LTE takes a very open minded listener. One that will not just listen to it and label it ""noise"" right off the bat.  One that will REALLY listen to the music. One that can recognize talent when they hear it. 

When people listen to DT or LTE and immediately label it ""noise"" or ""crap""...I usually ignore them, and immediately label them ""ignorant"" in return.  

Having an open mind while listening to music does not only pertain to DT, but also to every other band. I know I am sounding very hypocritical right now, but first let me explain myself.  If I have listened to ""your"" music, and immediately labelled it as something, then I suppose I am just as ignorant as everyone else.  Do bare in mind that I am used to the talent in DT and LTE, which makes all other music seem superficial compared to them =P lol! 

Alright, so, what exactly is the point of this journal entry?  There is none.  Just spreading the word about Dream Theater and Liquid Tension Experiment.  Trying to let you all in the secret of their music.

"event","Did anybody hear about the controversy going on in the States?  If you didn't, I'll fill you in...

An older woman was left in a vegetative state after some sort of an accident (I think so...or disease or something...). Anyway, she was breathing on her own without a ventilator, but she still had to be fed through a feeding tube.  Her husband argued that she verbally told him that she did not want to live like that, and that she would rather die. So, he took it to court and permisson was granted by the judge to allow the feeding tube to be removed.  Basically, the husband is slowly but ""lovingly"" (note the bunny ears) killing his wife.  Her mother is fighting to get the tube back in.

What the hell kind of country allows someone to starve to death under the watch of their loved ones? Do they have any morals? Does the husband have morals? They don't even allow animals -dogs and cats- to be starved to death. Think about it.  How twisted is that? Why are they allowing this woman to suffer a fate that not even animals are subjected to? Okay, so she would rather die then live like that. Understandable. Should it not be up to the courts to grant some human dignity to at least commit euthanasia through a quick, painless means? 

AND not to mention....the husband isn't even married to her anymore. He has kids with another woman. Why does HE have the right to make this decision?

*sigh* The world is one twisted place. Just when things appear to be straightening up...they turn around and get all twisted again. What a place.

"event","Oh! Look at that it's working! 
My mother read somewhere that most immigrants from Africa or other third world countries are astounded at how lucky we are here in Canada - our access to food in particular.  She read that newly immigrated people from third world countries cannot believe how much processed food we Canadians eat.  They cannot believe how fat our society is.  After hearing this, I immediately responded, ""Ma, (in that Italian accent I apparently speak with) it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that our society is fat compared to the starving and impoverished people in third world countries!"" It was as if it was the first time my mom has ever heard of an African admitting how fat people are in first world countries (i.e. Canada).  How can people be so naive? We are very lucky to be born and living in Canada, where even the homeless have a better life than those in third world countries. Society, myself included, does not understand nor comprehend the luck of the dice that was rolled.  We are lucky just be be BORN in Canada, and not in a third world country where about half the world's population subsides.  I'm no Ghandi, nor am I the Pope.  But I DO have the mental capability to actually REALIZE and appreciate all that I have.  I have a roof over my head, food in my stomach, and a good loving family. I'm happy. That's all there is to it. I am lucky. I hope you all realize that as well.  And No, I don't just mean to SAY you appreciate what you have and then forget about it. I mean understand it. Comprehend it. Feel it. Live each day like it. It really will change you. I speak from experience.

"event","For instance, you might fantasize about murdering your boss, the thrill of pounding his head on the filing cabinet with such impact his nose will leave an imprint on the steel. You can imagine how powerful that would make you feel, like a horse, or a V-8 engine. Imagine your arms, your thin, girlish arms that have only ever been used to support your manual labor-free hands typing on a soft-touch keyboard, capable of such violence. Something inside you released like a leopard, springing out of its cage in the blind light of day. With a snarl! Causing everyone in the vicinity to flee in terror! You will bask in how your coworkers will finally notice you, gaze at you with some sort of respect, or fear, or barely-hidden disdain. Anything, but what you're getting now. Which is, barely meeting your eyes. Almost no acknowledgment. Unless they need something from you, then their voices are laced with sugar, honey, if you were a diabetic you would die.

So, when you look up from your cubicle, from the lines and lines of data you just entered, you notice your boss is walking in your direction. In the short walkway where the filing cabinets are, he is waddling paunch first. You walk quickly towards him, murderous thoughts in your head, a stack of just-in-case folders in your hand. When he is about two feet away, you start seeing the weak fuzz on his head highlighted by the florescent lights. Then you notice the wrinkles on his face, the sheen on his jowls, and the grease stain on his tie. He does not even meet your eye. He is almost close enough to grab, his tie is swinging towards you, look, like it <i>wants</i> you to strangle him. Your arms move imperceptibly forward. Your hand is in front of you, still holding the folders. You reach out, one hand open, he is a foot away, then six inches, then three, then he is gone. He hasn't done anything special, he just passed you. As people tend to do when they walk in the opposite direction...Two people start walking towards each other at time X, where person A starts walking at X m/ hr and person B starts walking at Y m/ hr...

You swivel towards the Mur-Not filing cabinet like you were headed there in the first place. You haven't even dropped the folders. You open the drawer, start filing the folders, which are a little creased where you grasped them hard. That's all the proof you have of your fantasy. All the evidence available. That's all there is. No one will dare convict you on crease basis alone.

Of course nothing happens. Of course he's still alive, and you still work at your shit job. What did you expect?"

"event","a curious melange of the feminine and the masculine. dresses first in loose pants like a boy and tops it off with a pink blouse with a ribbon, or lace. walks with feet aimed straight always, sometimes with a happy bounce, moving the pony tail like a pendulum. and sometimes trudges along as if the whole world was stuffed in the backpack. eyes are deep, from lack of sleep, or from some unknown thought that strangles. once in a while the head would slowly rise from its intense gaze of the pavement, and then would bow again as if telling the world to keep its opinions to itself. other times the head is upright and straightforward, gaze a heliotrope following the orbit of every soul in the street. short and small. doesnt seem to realize how small. fingernails clean and usually cut to workable length. does not bite nails. hair wavy and dark, not too thick, not too long, usually clean and tied back. waist small, hips not child bearing. shoulders and calves round, breasts unremarkable. voice pleasant and clear with an accent that is difficult to pinpoint. face sometimes open though more often aloof. but overall safe-looking. overall unthreatening."

"event","they have been constructing this building on liberty street since this summer and theyve almost completed it. it's already my favorite building on the block because on its right side there is this giant round window in the shape of a peace sign. the sills are metal. it's glorious--oh the possibilities! i have this cool idea that it should be a sort of relaxing spa with a blue theme. they will have these one person tile bath tubs filled to the brim of different size blue beads that burst! when they come in contact with your sweat or your specific body heat or something. they look like the burst beads you find in your facial wash or even chewing gum. and they would be different shades and grades of blue and some white and gray: aquamarine, cerulean, sky, navy blue, ash gray, jean grey (haha), light blue fading into almost nothing, and the darkest blue of insistence. and when you lie on it, the feeling is described by one word: ""aaaahhhh"". it would be like stepping onto a nice warm perfume bath but squishier, gigglier. and you can sleep on it, we'll have special pillows that won't dissolve and you can just melt into the blue beads and be one with the blue beads and then you can become like that window on the right, you can become peace.

also around the building there are these grasses and rushes in bloom in the fall chill. they are so pretty swaying in the breeze and when i touched it, i thought it would be deceptive and actually be spiky but it wasn't at all. it was really soft like a cat's tail. they are pretty too, sort of silvery and yellow on top and dark green in the middle. i want those on the floor like carpet so that when you walk on it it's alive but soft, a living thing. so i guess ppl with allergies can't come into the relaxing spa, so sorry."

"event","wtf im in despair that i havent written anything worthy these days. i feel burnt and useless like when u suck too fast on the quick butt of the cigarette and u get heat centered on one part of ur lip. i dont want to be crying my heart out--who gives the fuck rite? i hate those ppl. i want steel edginess. i want metal. i read my second michelle tea book it's called rose of no man's land and the main character doesnt really have much of an inner life, i mean she's a homebody like i used to be but she has so much character, i love that. also it made me want to try crystal meth. she glorifies the drug life for sure but i mean im done with the good girl stint, the one where im supposed to follow some stricture about what and what not to do. i was raised a Catholic. i wholeheartedly believed that shit about marrying Jesus and shit--for like, a half day. it seemed so glorious to be wholeheartedly for one thing that youwould marry it. i spout shit like that all the time. like ""i love tape so much i want to marry it"" when i was obsessed with the idea of keeping myself together through artificial means, to tape me up messily like a porcelain doll u accidentally dropped. see i think that would be a good imagery, if someone can take a picture of that that would be awesome--maybe i will buy one from kiwanis and tape it. my aunt has lots and lots of tape at home, thick masking tape and clear packing tape--a treasury of tape. but anyway. one time my religion teacher (i went to a catholic school, religion did not have to be defined, because all religion is catholic religion) gave this long talk about st. theresa of avila and how she loved jesus. those fucking martyrs knock me out. theyre kind of pathological, i think, special. it has a certain allure for me that scares me. i dont want to be a fucking martyr, i dont want to be a masochist...except i think in some ways, i already am. i know it, and ive been accused of it. and i hate that it might be right. it's nothing overt like cutting or doing excessive drugs. it's more a mental thing. i like thinking bad things because it gives me a special feeling in my chest, like my heart really hurts. i dont know how to describe it, but the thing is im the only person who can make me feel like that. it's delicious. but also--its not a good feeling. its really negative. except i cant seem to stop myself.

also i want to finish reading this book called games ppl play i dont know who i heard it from. but the idea is that we have this need for intimacy that is rooted in infantile needs to be stroked. as we get older and this need is unfulfilled, we sort of sublimate this need through other forms of contact and social interaction such as when someone says hi to u on the street and even when u read about the lives of other ppl in books or something. so all u ppl who read my journals, u just want me to stroke u. hahahah. 

i have other things to say, im thinking of them but i dont wnat to write them down because even tho a writer must not be afraid of writing anything down, i do have vulnerabilities--well fuck that. so someone invited me out for friday to take pictures--of what? there is a certain dangerous and exciting prospect that it is of me. naked. how is that for lol> and the thing is im seriously considering it. the thing is tho i have taken all these classes that tell me that for someone to be viewed, painted, photographed means one is speechless, and powerless. everything is a marxist struggle for power. did you know that? yeah, apparently. everythign can be interpreted as the constant struggle for power between the oppressed and oppressor, the powerful and the powerless, the rich and the poor. im sure there's an alternative POV where to allow urself to be photographed in a certain way or somethign is a reversal of hte power grid. in teh same way that dominatrix games is actually about the dominatrix having power over the weak men who pay to be humiliated.

fuck, i think too much."

i thought i'd go home and get ready for bed at eight. i envisioned myself lying eagle spread on the futon, in the dark. it seemed exactly what i needed, like a cold beer on a hot day. but after i did my ablutions and changed into my sleeping clothes (how odd that we wear clothes just to sleep, in the same way we put on clothes when we head out to meet the world) i couldn't. instead i lay on the carpet and did sit-ups, until my abs felt like spring, until i felt myself weakening. then i faced the venitian blinds and reached for my toes over and over until my legs started shaking and my heart beat furiously. i wasn't sure if my eyes were closed, everything looks exactly the same when the lights are out.

i broke a plastic pen in half.

"event","on sunday it was blue and light and i flew a kite. franz heard i never did before so he found the one stored in the garage back from when he was five. we brought it out on the driveway and taped all the ripped parts together. it was so grimy and old. it was a plastic one that had a picture of a blue and red airplane and had a frame made of bamboo. he told me, u gotta wear sneakers because you have to run. so i did. we went to the park and i ran pulling it behind me and the kite went bouncing up and down, up and down but it wouldnt fly. there was no breeze. i wanted to stop but he said run, run faster. i ran and a strange wind blew and the kite took flight, it went up and up and up. 

it was so nice, it felt like i was the one flying, it felt like i was soaring and i was looking down at all the orange and yellow and golden leaves and waving to them, leaving them behind. franz lit a cigarette and passed another one to me and then when the kite was high enough i took the tip of my cigarette and touched it to the kite string, and then it flew away, untied and free and laughing."

"event","i wish we could wear comfort like goosefeathers, wrap our arms tight and warm with tape, to keep us in check, to hold us together. all the old things i used to do to keep me here don't work no more. why when i am surrounded by so much do i feel like im nowhere at all? i know a lot of people would care if i disappeared. i know this. but still 

nevermind,

I'm not trying to cause a fuss
I just wanna make my own fuck-ups

I'm just trying not to fall apart

"event","for some reason today
i had this awful black feeling walking to class
and i felt like going to a cubicle somewhere to throw up
and i couldnt think of what to do
finally i decided to buy fruit
i thought fruit would make me better
and the small convenience store on campus had this very dingy fresh foods counter at the back
and they had plums that were practically prunes they were so wrinkly and refrigerated
and peaches big ones and so tough
and they were so pathetic
but i got them anyway
and it made me feel better
i dunno

we had my aunt's friends come over and cook, 
and ricky too, came to cook, 
for ricky's birthday. i was really happy for a while, it reminded me of christmas



i wish i had an older brother growing up. i think things would've been better--different."

"event","The weight of the world
is love.
Under the burden
of solitude,
under the burden
of dissatisfaction

the weight,
the weight we carry
is love.

Who can deny?
In dreams
it touches
the body,
in thought
constructs
a miracle,
in imagination
anguishes
till born
in human--
looks out of the heart
burning with purity--
for the burden of life
is love,

but we carry the weight
wearily,
and so must rest
in the arms of love
at last,
must rest in the arms
of love.

No rest
without love,
no sleep
without dreams
of love--
be mad or chill
obsessed with angels
or machines,
the final wish
is love
--cannot be bitter,
cannot deny,
cannot withhold
if denied:

the weight is too heavy

--must give
for no return
as thought
is given
in solitude
in all the excellence
of its excess.

The warm bodies
shine together
in the darkness,
the hand moves
to the center
of the flesh,
the skin trembles
in happiness
and the soul comes
joyful to the eye--

yes, yes,
that's what
I wanted,
I always wanted,
I always wanted,
to return
to the body
where I was born.

i dunno, im happy.
not that things have been easy lately. i do sometimes get the fear and loathing. i get so sad sometimes i just want to sleep. and when i sleep i dream. i dream of many things i cannot resolve in waking life. 

it's hard, yes. i feel like i'm losing pieces of myself. yes, i want to give up sometimes.

but i also feel kind of excited. i am pitted against these metal drills and i feel like some sort of precious stone that has to be shaped into something beautiful and awe-inspiring. there are all these facets of myself that need to be worked on, even if i just want the grinding to stop sometimes. 

i just want to be honest and happy. im sad ppl don't get it, that i have to explain in so many words somethings i myself am just learning. ""humans are the great explainers"" - slaughter house five. sometimes i just start losing faith in being able to communicate at all. of course im sad that i seem to be losing those i care for. its not very easy to let go of those who have been like saviors in the night.

but i dont know. i have to make peace with myself. in the end it is me with whom i must be happy. it's i who has to grow. i still have a lot i haven't said, (i miss what used to be like you don't even know!) but words have done enough, i think, for now. even the most well intentioned ones can not mend what has been shattered.

i have lived a lot and now i must think about all of it. i just wish i can sustain this sense of wonderment. i wish people the same, but in the end, it isn't up to me whether they decide they want to grow or not.

this summer i had this theory that if i didnt persuade ppl to play a more immediate role in my life, i would leave them behind. we would no longer be on the same wavelength and ultimately, i was afraid i would lose them. after things got complicated i thought about the concept of losing--what is it that i'm really losing? is it me who would lose? is it even really losing? don't i gain something too, in the end? i thought maybe i could have both myself and others, but at the moment it seems like a battle that's still being played out. maybe it's true, i cant have both, and i could only get one. 

but here it is finally: what i am in the process of losing is the attachment i have with others, the attachment with those who have helped me grow. i was lost and weak and without, but i had (have?) really great souls around to help. and i was frequently grateful, because i thought it was much more than i deserved. i am still thankful for their help but now im strong(er) and i realize, i gave a lot too. and what i thought they gave i had it in me all along. they just helped me realize im good and now i am a growing power, and eventually im going to surpass the ones who helped. so it goes. 

i can only offer the same things they did: companionship and friendship. but perhaps they are not so needy as i was. 

so--that era is passing. that time, ultimately, has passed. and we must allow grieving time, pay our respects, try to honor that memory in this new time. it is not so often that we have such connections with ppl. it is not often that we find those who seem to be kindred spirits. but ultimately, we must move on. we must pick up ourselves and take our leave. 

we must learn to be bold in order that we might become mighty. because only in becoming strong ourselves do we allow others to be strong on their own. 

dissolution is a risk we take. grieve, but don't grieve too long. leave the weeping to the dead, there is still much we have to accomplish."

"event","The art of losing isn't hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.

Lose something every day.  Accept the fluster
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.

Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
places, and names, and where it was you meant
to travel.  None of these will bring disaster.

I lost my mother's watch.  And look! my last, or
next-to-last, of three loved houses went.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.

I lost two cities, lovely ones.  And, vaster,
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.

---Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
I love) I shan't have lied.  It's evident
the art of losing's not too hard to master
though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.

People can take me for granted again, my mother can continue ignoring me sometimes and making up unfair stories about me other times. But I just want that one opportunity to show the world, I really, violently hate it sometimes, that I sometimes just want it to DIE."

"event","i have a new friend named ricky. the most unusual thing about him is his unusal smell, like antiseptic or iodine. i sometimes catch a whiff of it when he's talking and then i feel like im in a clinic. it probably has to do with the fact that he's waiting for a dentist's appointment and in the meantime he's taking a bunch of painkillers to tide him over. first i didnt know how the smell made me feel. it isn't revolting, but it's very distinctive. once you smell it, it's like..what is that?

do you sometimes get a memory of a smell in your head, and then it brings up a flood of other non-olfactory memories? while walking in the hallway, a molecule of the iodine/ricky entered my nose and it brought up all sorts of thoughts in my head. and then i realized that i think fondly of ricky, because he smells like that. he smells, well, clean. and clean people seem so trustworthy, you know? they have good hygiene, and so they are probably decent people.

there's this research where they discovered people might be attracted to other people based on their smells. if another person's smell is attractive to you, it's because they probably have antibodies, hormones, etc. that you don't have and will therefore complement the ones that you have so that when you mate, your offspring will have increased fitness. that is, you'll make good, healthy babies.

i don't know how true this research is, or if i believe it. it might have a grain of truth. altho, im not really interested in having ricky's babies. i mean, really."

"event","the crocodile hunter died from a ray's stab wound to the heart

there were only 17 other cases of this particular ray killing human beings. how did that one ray know to aim for the heart? its aim was so true. 

the only explanation possible is that this was a special ray, a ray with the particular mission to cut off the machine that runs steve irwin. 

i wonder if it was a messy death. probably not. did he feel a special pain, or was it instant? did his lips turn blue, did he drown first and then die? 

did steve irwin know that it was going to be his last dance with death but had too much of a reputation to turn it down?

or was he just not equipped with people's natural fear of the wild? 

he was foolish, but brave. he was just waiting to die the whole time, but he did it with such character, such zest.

i admire him for that. and i worry for the future of his progeny. what if theyre just as fearless as he is? if natural selection is true, his genes are not long for this red tooth and claw world."

"event","The classical Japanese poets have an aesthetic ideal that finds beauty in the ends and beginnings of things. What they understand is that beauty is transient (or transience beauty). You complain about the sun's heat one day and the next worry where it's away. So much of what's in front of you can slip away without forewarning. It will seem like that to you, but it's not true. <i>You just didn't look hard enough.</i> Every minute the second hand ticks, a multitude of things has happened around you. Things are not the same as yesterday, same as the day before. We are being drawn inevitably to our futures like a river running into the sea. Open your ears please, there are layers of sounds coloring your world and it tells you so much than you would even realize. Open your eyes, look up at the sky, the ground, places you normally take for granted. There is a sweet and subtle pattern to things that becomes complete only through you, your very presence. 

Of course there is sadness. We know that. But this sadness is essential to the beauty. The classical poets did not celebrate summer as much as they did spring. They lost their minds trying to describe the perfect Autumn Moon and almost forgot there is one, too, for Winter, and for every season. In the peak of friendships, one is oblivious to <b>how good life is</b>. One thinks this is how life ought to be, how it always is. But it is the latter days, these latter days, upon which we must reflect. Savor this, we'll never quite fly as high as we do now.

Do not be wary of introspection. It does the soul good."

Soon, she will return, and I will lose myself. Soon, these days of endless sunshine will end, and I shall go back to the first and last, to myself. No one will know me or own me or remember me and I will hope again for that eternal oblivion. White will be the favorite. 

Desire is suffering, but I keep on desiring anyway. Don't you know, this too shall pass. People leave, people die, people are oblivious. Everyone will leave, for if they don't, then I will. (This is the way of the world, try not to be saddened by it.) And another thing: feelings are futile and words are combustible pieces of paper that I want to burn burn burn, even if they are all I have left to keep me. 

Now I've done it. I've fallen and I don't want to get up. I'm not strong enough for this, and whatever faith I've had has always been so shaky.

Irony is waking up in the morning grinding my teeth. Irony is the hollow in my stomach. Irony is the onion smell of my sweat. I want an iron beam against my skull.

"event","The floors of the House beside Summit on Main buckling under the weight of a crunked, sweaty populace out to party like there's no tomorrow, I am jumping in my heels wearing a purple sparkly dress. There is this Ann Arbor Hiphop Rock band, Belikos, which set the house  on fire. Happy Birthday, please! Ahmina, Unmesh, Emma, Ginni& John were with me, as well as an impossible number of lovely, lovely sweat and salt people (who nevertheless managed to keep their allure). Outside was humid, and inside was sticky, several degrees hotter and the air torrid (in all senses of the word) with the smell of cigarettes, MJ, et al. The guitarist was a Bob Marley incarnate, standing on the amp eyes all closed-like, light brown dreads tied back. The drummer, lean, bald, and stripped to his khaki pants-- hotdamn. Sizzle me Sonny! Afterwards, I saw him at the porch and traded a few words, his name was Justin, and I was ""the girl in the sparkly dress"". 

They always say, leave at the peak of your game, so in a few minutes we were on our way to a quite well known pool in town. Six people in one car, we jumped the fence and stripped to our bareness, decorating the tree in the shadows with our dresses and heels, and then--splash! The water is cool and inviting, just the prescription we need, Herr Doctor. Someone is coming, Shhh! Two more join us, and then another, and then another. I'm on the side of the big kids pool, learning how to dive. The deep end ain't so bad. I lost all the swimming races, but at least belly flops no longer define me.

And then the usual: Fleetwod Mac to satiate this hunger. Pancakes and sausages, ham and bacon. My ""stomach arteries"" are quivering with...err... happiness. We sit chatting and drying in the warm breeze of 5 am, no thoughts at all of what tomorrow may bring.

"event","<i>ay, walang arches yung paa.</i> 

i have heard this criticism from him before, spoken in a more biting tone. <i>flat-footed,</i> he said. <i>madaling madapa.</i> i was younger, my sense of self less-developed. back then i took this to heart and allowed it to form the picture of a girl who was not naturally inclined to athleticism and so, somehow, innately inadequate. but when he repeated his observation, tracing the pads of my feet with a forefinger, i understood that there was something deeper behind this taunt. i asked him if his feet had arches, whether he were free of my twin sin. he replied, matter of factly, that he didn't. his feet were as flat as mine, the pads slapping against the ground like raw meat, and he's older--he's had more chances to make them mountain rather than plane. and then he said, with some sort of longing, <i>ang magandang paa yung mataas.</i>  

but then i thought of the barefeet of the girl cyclist who sat beside me in driving class, their unnaturally high arches and long toes, the pads of her feet thick as the leather of a gorilla's buttocks. i didn't find them attractive. they looked mangled and manly. my feet seemed fine to me--i even sometimes thought them pretty. hers were gross and fully calloused, and obscene in their nakedness. and suddenly i understood. i understood that my father's sense of beauty were rooted in his own self-confidence. i understood that his careless words which hurt me were aimed not so much at me but against himself, against his flawed genes which would not bend toward his aesthetic ideals and which made him less of a man, and made me a mirror of his self-disappointment.  

in the end, the reason my father could not love me for who i am is that he could not forgive his own imperfections. here is the paradox of the man: the primal, animal need to reproduce and live forever gave him the urge to father offspring, but his sense of self-worth and the flaws in his very anatomy--which he is powerless to change--prevents him from loving his own. it's narcissism versus shame, and because he doesn't completely accept himself, my father cannot/ dare not claim me.

i feel out of touch with myself so i try to touch myself instead but i have been nursing a headache for days, so not tonight, dear.  apparently i do not really like to be engaged, i only like watching other people."

you can't make alliances with your opponent when there are only two of you left

you can die and pass on your property and wealth to your allies

you still have to pay rent to your allies

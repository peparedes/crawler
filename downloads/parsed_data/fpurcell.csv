A crowded house worked out surprisingly well.  Weather was typical Oregon (cloudy with some rain,  and of course beautiful on the day we had to leave).  <br /><br />It's been 9 years since my first Memorial Day in Oregon.  Wild how much can happen in 9 years.  Even more wild how fast it all did happen.  Scary to think that in another 9 years, I'll be Middle-Aged Man (Hey, I'm working on it).  <br /><br />Just the fam headed up to Pacific City on Monday.  Weather and waves were great.  Took the new Kayak into the surf, and had a great time.  I'm in a lot of pain today though...I did get hammered by some 8' waves a couple of times.  It was amazing as one big wave after another came barreling down within seconds of each other.  But it was great to surf (when I had a chance to get back on the yak), and I'm getting to know and like the new kayak.  Can't wait to go again this summer.</p>"

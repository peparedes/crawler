I was trying to describe the awesomeness to the girls, but you can't describe is, can you? Pee Wee must be EXPERIENCED. It was off to YouTube we went, looking for clips. They didn't really ""get it"" until we came across the BEST CLIP EVAH!!!

So now we've been randomly shouting <i>""GIANT UNDERPANTS!!""</i> for the past two days, then laughing and laughing afterward. This is why being a parent is so much fun!

Wanna know what's even better?? Our local library has the DVDs! We've been working our way through them, and the girls love them. James doesn't really get it (I guess he was TOO OLD for Pee Wee) but we don't care. Pee Wee is polarious!"

"event","I've been thinking a lot about the <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_lesbian_prom_date;_ylt=AjkdLyILLKzjgwPX8.XB.OVsaMYA"">Lesbian student who is suing her school because they canceled the prom</a> ever since I read the story yesterday. 

I feel badly for the poor girl, considering she is getting a lot of blame for the school canceling the prom, which I suppose the school has the right to do, regardless of what the ACLU says. Don't get me wrong- I COMPLETELY, TOTALLY DISAGREE with the school's decision. But there are lots of schools that don't have proms, for whatever reason. 

It's says a lot about this teen girl, that she is already out and proud and comfortable with who she is. God only knows how hard it must be for her. I can't help but wonder, though, if a modicum of discretion might have been the better part of valor here. I'm sure part of their thinking is that they want to be treated like a heterosexual couple would be treated, without having to hide their relationship. But at my own prom, outside of my circle of friends, I couldn't have told you who was there with whom, date-wise. And there were plenty people of the same sex who took pictures together, and no one thought anything of it. 

Wouldn't it have made a stronger statement if from the beginning the girls (both the girl suing and her girlfriend in question) had just decided to put on some pretty dresses and go to the prom like it was a normal part of life? Looking at the big picture, isn't being there together (even if they didn't arrive together and the girlfriend had to wear a dress) better than suing the school district, getting the prom canceled (again, bad decision on the school's part) and most likely losing the appeal anyway?

But then again, I don't know what it's like to be a lesbian teenager who wants to go to the prom with her girlfriend, so what do I know?"

The girls had dress rehersal for OZ yesterday. It lasted from 12:00 until 9:30. o_O They warned us it would be a long day, and they weren't kidding! This is the last week of rehersals (all going until at least 7:30 or later), with performances starting on Friday.

2. Some sort of crazy pandemic swept through the two 4 yr old classes at preschool. I was out Monday and Tuesday myself. The two classes averaged 3-5 kids each day. On Friday I had a grand total of ONE child in my class. (Of course, he was the one who requires the most attention, but it was a lot of fun to work with him one-on-one, and he loved it.) We had kiddos out with the flu, bronchitis, stomach viruses- you  name it, they had. I went through a whole can of Lysol. 

3. The girls continue to work their little hearts out singing and dancing in preparation for OZ. Practices are up to four days a week now, including Saturday. Oy vey. 

4. Valentine parties are NEXT WEEK. Umm, what? 

5. Madeline went to New Beginnings last week. She was invited as an up-and-coming <a href=""http://www.lds.org/pa/display/0,17884,6822-1,00.html"">Beehive</a> this year. UMM, WHAT!!??!??!?

6. *looks in the living room*
No worries, yet. She and her sister and currently playing with a bumch of Fisher Price Little People I brought home from school today. I guess she's not all grown up *yet*.

7. I've had to buy highlighters in order to color-code my planner just so I can keep up with schedules/activites of four different people. *shakes head* When did I become this person? Doesn't the world realize I LIKE being in my jammies by 6:30pm? Sheesh.

8. I've decided that there are three specific bills I want to pay off before the end of the school year, and if I do, then I will give myself permission to buy a digital SLR camera. My pocket digital only takes so-so pictures, and I miss the clarity that SLR pictures have. Any suggestions on what to buy are appreciated. As are donations. ;) (I prefer Canon brand, since I already have some Canon lens from my regular SLR.) 

9. I am VERY excited that the Winter Olympics start next week. Please do yourself a favor and watch Johnny Weir skate to Lady Gaga's ""Poker Face"". There are no words to describe the experience.

<strong>Name a TV show series in which you have seen every episode at least twice:</strong> 
Firefly (It helps that there are only 13 episodes. But what great episodes they are!)
Gavin and Stacey- a Brit com that is just brilliant. I can't wait for the final series to start showing on BBCA. (And when will they release the second series and Christmas special on DVD??)

<strong>Name a (current) show you can't miss:</strong> 
The Big Bang Theory- It starts of my week with laughter and geekery.

<strong>Name an actor that would make you more inclined to watch a show: </strong>
Nathan Fillion- He's the reason I checked out (and love!) Castle.

<strong>Name an actor who would make you less likely to watch a show:</strong> 
Sarah Michelle Gellar- She just grates on my nerves SO MUCH. I'd probably like Buffy if it weren't for her.

<strong>Name a show you can, and do, quote from.</strong> 
Firefly, Top Gear, How I Met Your Mother, Gavin and Stacey

<strong>Name a show you like that no one else enjoys:</strong> 
Hmmm...Maybe Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives? Guy Fieri is a terrible host, and I don;t watch any of his other shows, but the places he visits on DDD usually are interesting and the food almost always looks good.

<strong>Name a TV show which you've been known to sing the theme song:</strong> 
The Big Bang Theory (It's Barenaked Ladies! It's catchy!) 

<strong>Name a show you would recommend everyone to watch:</strong> 
Castle- Nathan Fillion is sweet and chraming as a writer who shadows an NYPD Detective names Kate Beckett. She's the muse for his latest crime series. Their unresolved sexual tension is through the roof! The show is funny and charming and the mysteries are never too heavy. 

<strong>Name a TV series you own:</strong> 
Friday Night Lights

<strong>What is your favourite episode of your favourite series? </strong>
Urgh. So hard to pick!! Probably ""State"" from Season One of Friday Night Lights (I still cry every. single. time. I watch it) or ""Out of Gas"" from Firefly. And I love, love, love the Gavin and Stacey pilot.  

<strong>A show you mean to watch, but you just haven't gotten around to yet: </strong>
Veronica Mars, Glee

<strong>Ever quit watching a show because it was so bad?</strong> 
Grey's Anatomy. No one on the show is allowed to be happy, and I can't deal with that much dysfunction so late in the week. 

<strong>Name a show you aren't interested in watching, not in the least:</strong> 
24

<strong>Name a show that's made you cry multiple times: </strong>
Friday Night Lights. I've cried at some part during every episode. This show is amazing, amazing, amazing. I've also cried more than once at Doctor Who. 

<strong>What was the first TV show you were obsessed with?</strong> 
The Young Riders

<strong>How often do you watch TV? </strong>
Every day of the week.

<strong>Which do you think is the best TV series ever made?</strong> 
Friday Night Lights is so good and it doesn't get the recognition it deserves. As far as comedies go, I think 30 Rock is as good as it gets. Tina Fey is a genius."

Are any of you Amazon Prime members? I needed something quick a few weeks ago, and I signed up for their trial membership. Yowza! I ordered it late on Saturday and it was here by Monday afternoon. The $75 pricetag is steep, but if I add up the $20 I pay yearly for my Books-A-Million discount card thingy, plus all the times I've added something to my Amazon cart to get it past $25 and therefore qualify for ""free"" shipping, I figure I'd be pretty close to spending $75 a year anyway. 

Thoughts? Opinions?"

"event","Obviously. 

All joking aside, I need some advice. 

Back in December I order a necklace from <a href=""http://www.thevintagepearl.com/"">this website</a>. It was a Christmas present from ""the DH"" to ""me"" (i.e. I bought it and told Jaws <I>""Thank you for my present!""</I>. :P) I didn't order it before their Christmas deadline, so I knew it wouldn't arrive until sometime in January.

On January 5th, I received an email saying that it had shipped via USPS Priority mail, along with a tracking number. According to the USPS website, on January 7th the package was processed and left Macon GA. Nothing has happened since then.

Macon is only 1.5 hours north of where we live, and where we live is one of the larger sorting facilities for mail in SW Georgia. Since Priority Mail says it takes about 2-3 business days, the package should be here by now.

Yesterday, I went to check on the tracking at the USPS site, and my tracking number couldn't be found. I went to the order stub at the original website and couldn't track it from there, either.

I sent an email to the website owner to see if (as the shipper) she could track my package. She emailed me back saying, <I>""Yes! It's in Macon GA.""</I> I sent her another email today saying that it had been in/left Macon since the 7th, and as the shipper, was she able to get more info from USPS than myself? She hasn't replied yet. 

So here's my problem. I think the package is lost (although I'm willing to give it a few more days). On the website it states that the shipper isn't responsible for lost packages, and that purchasing shipping insurance is recommended. I don't remember seeing an option to purchase insurance when I was checking out- in fact, I went back yesterday to check. I went all the way through the purchase procedure up till the part where you ""click here to send payment"" and there was no where to add on insurance. 

I paid through PayPal, and I *think* I can file a claim if the package doesn't show up. The only problem is that I have to do it within 45 days of making the payment- that was December 8th, which means the 45 days is up on January 22nd. 

So what- if any- are my options if my package doesn't show up by next week? Does anyone know what the process is like to file a calim through Paypal? The Paypal site isn't exactly clear when it comes to the buyer. There was a lot of ""try and work with the seller first""- seeing as how the seller says they aren't responsible once it ships, I'm not to hopeful that they will either send a new necklace or give me a refund. 

I would love to be a repeat customer at this site. I just don't know what I should do going forward. Any ideas? Thoughts? Suggestions????"

While <i>The Incredibles</i> remains my favorite Disney/Pixar movie, <i>Up</i> almost nudged it out of the top spot on the strength of the first nine minutes of the movie. The montage of Carl and Ellie Fredrickson's life together had me laughing and crying and then laughing and crying even harder. The rest of the film is just as good, and if this movie doesn't win a Best Animation Oscar, then I will seriously be upset.

Nordstrom was an editor for Harpers from the 1930's-1970's. She is considered a pioneer in the area of children's books. She edited many of the children's books we have come to regard as 'classics'. She worked with the likes of Laura Ingalls Wilder, Garth Williams, E.B. White, Maurice Sendak, Margaret Wise Brown, Shel Silverstein, Clement Hurd- the list goes on and on. 

This book is full of letters she wrote to various people within the publishing industry (authors, illustrators, librarians, other publishers, etc). She was brilliant and enormously funny. I loved seeing just how committed she was to her authors and illustrators. I know a collection of letters (especially hundreds of letters) sounds like it will be enormously dry and boring, but I'm telling you IT'S NOT. I borrowed this book from the local library, but I'm *seriously* considering purchasing a copy for my own personal use. 

In my opinion, this book is an education for anyone who 1) wants to be involved in any way with the creation and distribution of quality children's books or 2) anyone who simply loves children's books

SO THAT'S IT!! My picks for 2009! On to 2010!"

"event","I've been thinking about my word for quite awhile, and I keep coming back to the same word over and over again. Perhaps it's just a reaction to last year's word, but I am thinking it's more than that. What it is exactly I have yet to find out, but my word for 2010 is 

<B>PEACE</B> 

What about you? What are you going to choose to focus on this year??"

"event","With <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/"">Goodreads</a> making it so easy to keep track of my reading, I didn't keep a month-by-month word document like I have <a href=""http://divinemum.livejournal.com/276978.html"">in the past</a>. For five years, my only New Year's Resolution was to read 50 New-To-Me books over the course of the year.

If you check out my <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/662039-jennifer?shelf=50-in-2009"">2009 Goodreads Bookshelf</a> you'll see that I read 98 new books! I'm satisfied that I exceeded my goal, but I think I probably could have done better. I really thought I would at least get to 100. Of course, this doesn't count all of the books I re-read or the hundreds of books I read at preschool over the course of the school year! 

But in the spirit of the new decade, I've decided to up my goal to 100 New-To-Me books over the course of 2010. I think I can do it, even though it will be a bit of a challenge. But *this* is the type of challenge that one can look forward to, yes? ;)

"event","1. I put up <S>Jules'</S> my SEC userpic at the beginning of the college football season. I didn't update for awhile, and so I didn't change it like I usually would for the holidays. In the meantime, UF keeps winning. I can't help but think the two things are related. So I won't be changing it until after UF kicks some Bama tail tomorrow, and then beats whatever subpar team happens to make it into the BCS Championship game! /trash talk

2. In other news, it got COLD here this week. I finally turned on the heater when the thermostat read 61 degrees inside the house. 

3. In many ways I love where we live, but more and more I'm feeling like a stranger in a strange land. I'm surrounded by so much prejudice and mistrust and ignorance that it really takes the shine off life, you know? 

And if I'm honest, it's not just people where I live. It's people that I've know how live elsewhere and can't help but post their political rantings on Facebook then get offended when people 1)point out factually incorrect information and/or 2)reply with a differing opinion. 

So the option I'm left with is to be me and work within my own sphere of influence and not worry about what other people say and/or think. Otherwise I think I'll just go crazy.

4. Speaking of going crazy, my mental health is pretty good these days. I'm so glad I don't live in ""the good old days"" where people who were suffering mentally just had to grin and bear it. Thank you God for anti-anxiety and anti-depression medications!

5. Speaking of being thankful, out Thanksgiving was lovely. We didn't do a big family thing this year because my parents are in the process of remodelling their kitchen. So my brother Jed came and stayed with us for a few days. I made a very tasty Thanksgiving dinner, which we ate after we saw a movie (as per our Thanksgiving tradition). We saw <I>New Moon</I>, which was entertaining. That night we watched <I>Star Trek</I> and then introduced Jed to <I>The Big Bang Theory</I> which he loved. We spent the rest of our vacation staying up late and sleeping in, for which we paid *dearly* this week.

6. Tomorrow, my extended family will be in the Tifton Christmas Parade. There will be 30 of us. This has been my grandfather's wish for I don't know how long. It's going to be something, I can tell you that. Pictures will follow!"

"event","The DH and I are slowly coming off our high from this week's awesomeness. We both agree that it was the MOST FUN we've ever had together, including our honeymoon, so that's saying something. 

With our run of luck this year I kept waiting for something to spoil our plans but really, things couldn't have been more perfect. Our hotel was lovely and confortable, MARTA got us where we needed to be when we needed to be there, the Cheesecake factory was yummy (Even though we had to walk 2 miles to get there- The MARTA train let us off on the right street, and we didn't realize how far away from the station the restaurant was or that a bus could have dropped us off practically in front of it! We made sure we road the bus *back* to the station!).

Of course, the best part of all was the concert. We got there about 6:30 for a 7:00 start, but Muse (the opening act) didn't go on until almost 7:30, and U2 didn't go on until 9:00. We had a fun time watching all the drunk people (including one lady in super high heels who had five beers before the show even started- we were sure she was going to go over the railing at some point when her ""dancing"" got a little out of control.) 

U2 definitely needs to be seen live to be fully appreciated. Bono's voice sounded amazing, and the show itself was pretty incredible. You could see the band from all points in the arena (hence this being the 360 Degrees tour) and they had HUMONGOUS video screens so you didn't miss a thing. Technologically it is pretty dadgum impressive!

U2 played for a little over two hours, and the time just flew by. We didn't want it to end! The best part was the encore where they played <I>With or Without You</I>, and the DH put his arms around me and we danced together. *sniffs*

We ended up walking back to our hotel from the Georgia Dome (just a little over a mile). The night was just gorgeous the skyline was beautiful, and it was so much fun to be walking with probably 1000+ people up International Blvd to various hotels. All in all we had the time of our lives, and it's something we'll never forget."

Three days after I met the DH, he told me he loved me. 

Fours days after I met the DH, he told me that he wanted to marry me. 

At this point I wasn't even sure I wanted to date him, let alone *marry* him.

Five days after I met the DH, he fixed my car for me. 

It was at this point I seriously began to consider the marriage potential. After all, a man who can FIX THINGS is very, very handy. 

Yesterday my sound judgment was reaffirmed (not for the first time!) as he was able to replace the EGR Valve in my van in under 30 minutes, something that a mechanic would have charged us hundreds of dollars to do, mind you. It's not the first time he's worked mechanical miracles, and I'm sure it won't be the last time.

It makes up for the unfortunate incident that happened on Sunday when he thought it would be fine to move this bookcase.

This bookcase that is full of my preschool books. This bookcase that I spent a WEEK over the summer organizing alphabetically and by theme. This bookcase that is a cheap, not-at-all-well-made Target bookcase.

This bookcase that proceeded to have one whole side fall off of it when he tried to scootch it across the carpet. This is what happened.

*sigh*

200+ books in a big pile on the floor. 

At least he was able to put his handyman skills to use and repair the bookcase and REINFORCE IT WITH MONSTER SCREWS. All is forgiven."

2. After searching and searching and deliberating (ack! spending money!) I bought myself a new, quality handbag today. <a href=""http://www.verabradley.com/Site/Store/ProductDetail.aspx?colorid=30&sku=152%3a30"">It's this one right here</a>. I needed something that was big but not huge, with lots of pockets on the inside, and with straps long enough that I could carry it on my shoulder. 

My cousin had a bag similar to this one at my grandmother's birthday party a few weeks  ago (which I don't think I wrote about- must rectify that situation!) and I really, really liked it. I've been buying cheap bags from Target and Old Navy in hopes of making something work and they just haven't. So I ponied up the cash and bought something that I *know* will work! 

3. The DH was invited to watch SEC football all day with a few guys from church. He's headed over in an hour or so, but it's funny because even though he likes football, he's not one to plan his life around a game (whereas I would- if it were an SEC game, that is!). He's going for the male bonding. I will watch the game in peace and quiet here at home while I work on preschool stuff and organize my new handbag! Good times. 

4. We are headed to Tifton tomorrow for the blessing at church of my niece, Meghan, followed by a family lunch. My assignment was to bring a Spincah Salad. I will have to restrain myself to keep from eating it all tonight!

5. Our Labor Day plans consist of doing NOTHING but reading, watching movies/TV and eating hamburgers at some point. YAYx2!"

In other news, the first two weeks of school are done, and we're adjusting. The girls are happy at school, and I really, really like my new aide. (She's calm, cool and collected, and she has a great sense of humor. God knows what we need when we need it, yes?) My class is bigger this year, which has been a challenge. I know it doesn't seem  like twelve would be a bigger deal than nine, but it really does at this age. But I'm figuring out how to teach *this* class, and that's half the battle, really. 

My sister found out she doesn't have a brain tumor, just a ""mass"". On one hand, a sigh of relief, on the other hand some further investigation will be done at some point. But as long as she's feeling good her doctor is just going to watch and wait. 

Gentleman, you may want to avert your eyes for this next TMI discussion of girly bits.

*waits*

After putting up with years of crazy heavy periods, my mom is having a hysterectomy in two weeks. She and her doctor decided on this course of treatment rather than just the Uterine Ablation because of my grandmother's recent history with Uterine Cancer (she was diagnosed last fall and just finished up her radiation treatments over the summer). My own periods are changing as I get older, so this is definitely something for me to ruminate over. It's another thing I need to get into the doctor for so we can talk about it! (One thing at a time, right?) 

*Guys, you can continue reading now!*

The DH is doing good, working hard as usual. He's still temporarily assigned to to a different area doing all sorts of safety/OSHA projects through the special program he's apart of. We're not quite sure when it's going to end (the original time table was six moths to a year, and it's been right at five months), as the supervisor seems to keep changing the DH's task because he's trying to keep the DH around! (The supervisor won't get anyone to replace him when he's done.) The DH doesn't particularly want to work for this guy for the long term, so he's just trying to keep his nose clean and do what needs to be done. So we'll see what happens. 

I think that's it. For now, at least. YAY!"

All the school supplies have been purchased and sorted into backpacks, and we're already thinking of First Day of School outifts. 

2. Despite the fact that I've been out in the sun regularly all summer, somehow I still managed to get a sunburn yesterday. What's up with that, Mother Nature? 

3. Ginny has become (somewhat) enamored of the word 'bitch'. It started a few weeks ago when we were listening to DH in the car, and she said that Molly's line to Bellatrix was her favorite part of the story, and then she proceeded to scream out said line. (It was seriously polarious.) 

So the DH and I explained that it wasn't a nice word to say and that she shouldn't go around saying it, but we tried to explain why Molly Weasley would have used that word. She thought about it for a moment and said, <I>""Oh, okay. But I thought Molly had just combined the words ""Bellatrix"" and ""witch"" and then called her a 'bitch'. I thought it was pretty funny.""</I> To which the DH and I had to give her props for such clever thinking.

4. <a href=""http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2009/07/i-saw-gwar-and-lived-to-tell-about-it/1"">This Pop Candy post</a> had me LOL-ing all over the place, and now I kinda-sorta want to go to a Gwar concert, just to say that I have. 

5. For the third month in a row, our power bill has stayed below $200! YAY!!! That has never happened the whole time we have lived in Albany, and that's also *with* the Georgia Power rate hike that happened earlier in the year. We've been careful with the electricity, but not overly so. The only thing we can chalk it up to is our new roof, so YAY for that. We have just one more month to get through before the rates drop after the summer, and typically our August bill is lower than May, June or July's so I'm feeling optimistic."

I mean, this isn't the first post where people are confessing that they are breaking down and *sobbing* at just the trailer. While I absolutely love the book (it was the first children's picture book I ever bought for myself) I'm not feeling the love for the movie.

I think my biggest problem is that the Wild Things look about as real as the costumed characters at Disney World. It doesn't matter how awesome the costume is if you still see it was nothing but a costume. :\

However, the girls want to see it, so see it we (most likely) will.

I don't know what to think, but I'm not 100% feeling the love. There are some things that I really loved (Hallo thar Dumbledore!) but the overall tone of the movie was...off in some ways. They absolutely *nailed* the humorous bits, and Jim Broadbent's Slughorn was absolutely perfect. And even though we knew it was coming, the entire theatre screamed when the Inferi grabbed Harry. I was *terrified*! LOL

The Pensieve bits felt rushed to me. And I'm usually a movie apologist, willing to accept that the movies and the books are not the same, but I really didn't like the added attack at the Burrow (it felt extranious) and Ginny and Harry's kiss was, well, I'll just say it- AWFUL. It got absolutely NO reaction from the audience I was with (and the crowd had been very pro Harry/Ginny up to that point).

I think I'm just a little let-down at the moment. I'll wait to make a final judgment until after I've seen the film again. (That's another thing, though. Usually I'm ready to run back in for another showing immediatly, but not this time. Hmmm.)"

My day started at 7:00 am when my niece woke me up to tell me she had wet the bed again. Later, I spent a good hour and a half (over the course of three phone calls) getting shirty with my cable/internet/phone provider regarding a DVR that won't record and an outrageous increase in rates. In the afternoon we went swimming out at the base pool where the DH met us after work and we all got ever-so-slightly pink-ish. We came home around 7:00 pm to the ringing telephone- it was my sister asking me if I had heard that Michael Jackson had died (I hadn't. How crazy is his death??) Then it was dinner and baths and bedtime and then- blessed silence. 

Two of my nieces have been here since Monday. They are good, sweet girls (for the most part ;D), ages 7 and 5. But they are more <I>labor-intensive</I> than my own children, who are running on auto-pilot at this point. All four girls have also been together for almost two weeks now (my girls spent last week over in Tifton, visiting between my parent's house -which is where the nieces live with the rest of my brother's family - and my sister's house) so their tolerance of each other is starting to wear a little thin. 

We were going to take them home on Sunday, but my SIL called today and said she had to come over this way tomorrow anyway, so she would just take them home then. I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little bit relieved. 

In other news, after a bit of navel-gazing, I think my life might be at a cross-roads of a sort. More on that later."

2. Why is Three Dog Night only remembered for ""Joy to the World"" when ""Shambala"" is CLEARLY the superior song?

3. Mendel was right about the whole genetics thing. Case in point- my family.

- The DH was raised in a household with decidedly non-geeky roots, but he loved Doctor Who as a kid, even though he only watched a handful of episodes. Given the chance, he probably would have been a full-on geek.

- I was raised in a moderately geeky household. My dad was totally into Star Trek (although it didn't go as far as him being a Trekkie). Since I grew up in the Dark Ages and we only had one TV, on Saturday nights from 1987 on if you wanted to watch TV you were watching ST:TNG. I usually watched the episodes with *some* interest, but I wasn't heavily into it. 

It was more of a matter of self-preservation, really. We had moved to Pennsylvania a few months into the school year. I was assigned to the only open spot at a table with four boys. All of whom watched Star Trek and discussed it. They even assigned themselves characters! They they were all very, very nice to me, I figured I should join in the conversation. Eventually I was able to impress them with my knowledge enough that I was assigned the character of Dr. Beverly Crusher. (Not bad, right? It was better than being Tasha Yar.) However, I was more excited about writing my secret <I>Anne of Green Gables</I> fanfiction, but I didn't even know what fanfiction was at the time. 

- As we've gotten older, our recessive Geeky genes have started coming to the fore front, especially when Harry Potter came around. As a result, our two recessive genes have combined to produce two children with dominant geeky genes. 

I suppose one could argue a Nurture VS Nature thing here, but that would be crossing over from geeky to nerdy, which is not really where I want to go. ;)   

4. I will never have everything perfectly organized for preschool (as much as I would like it to be) so I should work on a few little projects for another week or so and then STOP! If I work on preschool stuff all summer, then I will be burned out before the school year even begins."

<lj-cut text=""A few explanations"">
1. With or Without You: Of *course* U2 is going to be at the top of the list. I CANNOT WAIT to hear this song in person in October. Do you know what thought? I was talking to 15 year old girl the other day, and she had didn't know who U2 was! SHE HAD NEVER HEARD THIS SONG. What is this generation coming to??!!?!??!?
2. Elevator Love Letter: Even though this song isn't exactly happy, I've loved it ever since I heard it for the first time.
3. 59th Street Bridge Song: You can't listen to this song and not be happy. It's impossible.
4. Bad Moon Rising: This song reminds me of my dad. 
5. The Way You Look Tonight: It's a classic.
6. Wicked Game: I wonder if this song would have been as popular without the classic video?? At any rate, it's a downright sexy song.
7. Everywhere: Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie kill the harmonies. Amazing.
8. Fields of Gold: Sting at his best
9. I'll Fly Away: Anothing song with amazing harmonies. And I accidentally deleted my copy from iTunes, so if anyone wants to send it to me?? *is hopeful*
10. Fools Rush In: The DH says this is ""our song"". 
11. Come On Get Higher: Let me tell you how obsessed I have been with this song the past week. TOTALLY OBSESSED. It's the ultimate sexytime song. GUH GUH GUH
12. Love Me do: This was the first Beatles song I really loved
13. Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around The World: This U2 song is a gem that is underappreciated. 
14. Daughter: The girls play this on iTunes all the time. I love that it has meaning for them.
15. If I Had a $1,000,00: This is probably our family's ""theme song"". We love it so much we took the name of our family blog from it. 
16. Heart of the Matter: Longing and regret and missed opportunities 
17. Gotta Have You: Another duo with lovely harmonies
18. The Sweetest Thing: I love that Bono wrote this for his wife Ali as an apology for missing her birthday.
19. Sweet Home Alabama: You can't be from the south and not love this song. It's in our DNA. 
20. Wonderwall: I couldn't decide between the Oasis and the Ryan Adams version. In the end Oasis wins, just because the idea of Liam or Noel Gallagher being devoted enough to someone to write this song is a miracle in and of itself. 
21. By Your Side: Dude. It's Sade. 'Nuff said.
22. Photograph: It's bombastic and over the top and I love it. 
23. Yellow: I'm now realizing this list is heavy on the slow emotional jams. :P
24. Regret: I literally can not NOT dance when this song comes up on iTunes.
25. One: This song is genius. Pure genius. I didn't appreciate it until I got older. 
26. Here Comes the Sun: George Harrison doesn't get enough credit for his contributions
27. Birdhouse in Your Soul: Another ""family"" song. I love to hear Ginny sing it.
28. Easy Silence: Natalie Maines kills it. 
29. I'm On Fire: I like Bruce, and I can appreciate his contribution to music and all that, but his music isn't really my thing. That being said, I love this song.
30. Whatever It Is: A new favorite that will stick around for a very long time.

If this doesn't scream classic trashy romance novel, then I don't know what does! <i>The Playboy Takes A Wife</i>...awesome. The blurb on the back says <i><b>""From Billionaire Bachelor...to Dedicated Daddy?""</b></i> Ooh, note the question mark! Intriguing.

Ah yes. The historical trashy romance novel! <i><b>""A woman alone, yet determined to fulfill her dying father's golden dream, Kerry Gallivan heeded to siren call of pioneering and set out on 'the sea of grass'. But how was she to know that while she sailed her prarie schooner, Jed Hunter would become captain of her fate?""</b></i> I love it when an author uses mixed metaphors! It gives you hope that the qulaity of writing inside the novel will be simply spectacular.

Oh my. So many things to say! The title- what does that even mean? And the teaser on the front: <i><b>""A shocking secret...""</b></i> I think the shocking secret it that the scary kid on the cover is really a serial killer, and the two people on the front are her latest victims.

You know, the summary on the back of this one was too good not to share in its entirity. Take a look for yourself, peeps.

<i>""Gypsy Clothing""?</i> <i>""Feline Fan club""</i>? And the fact that the whole plot of the book seems to resolve around <i>""lucrative lavender fields""</i>?? I'm speechless. 

And finally...
<a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Oh_Z0EBje2s/SiVRmqPYpHI/AAAAAAAAAuw/8wXOTkWHiD8/s1600-h/IMG_1935.JPG""><img /=""/"" alt="""" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Oh_Z0EBje2s/SiVRmqPYpHI/AAAAAAAAAuw/8wXOTkWHiD8/s400/IMG_1935.JPG"" style=""display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;"" id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5342766257560659058"" border=""0""></a>

Judging by this cover art, I was sure this book had been published in the early 80's, at the ""heigth"" of the BIG HAIR trend (hee! Puns!). But no. This book was published in 1992. 

It looks like we have some good (and I use that word pejoratively) choices this year, folks. So help me decide which of these enduring pieces of literature for the full-on review-with-snarky-observations. I'll keep the poll up for the next few days, and then I'll annouce the winner after I combine the votes from both here and my blog. 

May the ""best"" book win!

"event","A wise person (I think it was <lj user=""coquillagement""> or <lj user=""Miss_Daizy""> or <lj user=""russian_ivy"">) that being on LJ was kind of like being in a sorority (of the very best kind)- during the school year we're all busy, but we check in on a regular basis. When the summer hits, we all scatter our seperate ways, occasionally letting everyone know about fun vacations, good books, etc. I like that. 

Anyway, I'm teaching the girls to cook this summer. Heaven grant me patience, please! They can already do basics like scrambled eggs and grilled cheese, but it's time I did my duty as a mother and *really* let them loose in the kitchen and master some baking skills. They made brownies today (each with their own batch, from a mix, but still!). The brownies are baking right now, so we'll see how they turn out. The fact that we went through four extra eggs and had to throw out a egg/water/oil mixture because of a spill will NOT deter me this early in the game!

In other news, I swore I wouldn't stress about preschool until *at least* July, but it's not meant to be, I guess. I ran into my director the other day who asked me if I would be terribly upset if she moved my aide to another class for next year. The director wants to put my aide's son in my class (rather than the other 4 year old class) because she thinks it will be a better fit. And the son can't be in a class with his mother. 

I don't disagree with my director (I think the son will respond better to my teaching style) but I will hate not working with my aide, who is also my friend! We had all last year to work out our kinks and find a good rhythm, and now I'll have to start over with someone new. I hate change. :\ And I hate not knowing who I'll be working with. The director called me this morning and asked if I would mind working with a person who used to work there and has subbed for the past couple of years. I told her I thought I would either kill myself or the other person before the school year was out. To say we wouldn't be a good personality match would be an understatement. So I was proud of myself for saying ""NO"" and not automatically trying to be a people pleaser!

And lastly, I finished reading an AWESOME book over the weekend, called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Dear-Genius-Letters-Ursula-Nordstrom/dp/0064462358/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1243893148&sr=8-1"">Dear Genius: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom</a>. You can read my full review over on <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40145.Dear_Genius_The_Letters_of_Ursula_Nordstrom"">Goodreads</a>. If you have any desire of being a writer, working in the publishing industry, are a librarian or just love children's books, then this book is a MUST READ. I will probably purchase my own copy just so I can underline that particularly witty and hilarious lines and passages in Nordstrom's letters. I predict most of the book will be marked. 

Thus endeth the longest LJ post ever."

"event","Summer officially begins today! School ended for me on Friday (thank you, parents, for the lovely monogrammed purse, the gift card to Target and the gift certificate to our favorite Mexican restaurant!) and the girls have a half day today and then *they* are done! I look forward to sleeping in tomorrow. 

Sneaky Hermione surprised me yesterday at her Honors Day. Turns out she *knew* she was getting the award for being the TOP AR reader in her grade, and she kept it a secret! Her teacher pulled me aside afterward and said how excited she and the rest of the team teachers were when they found out she would be getting the award. Suffice it to say, we are VERY proud of her! Ginny didn't get any awards, but we are proud of her too. Her spelling grade kept her from making Honor Roll, and I know she was disappointed. But I told her it just gave her a goal to work on for next year. 

I've been busy rearranging the house, and so far I haven't spent any money. :P I'm trying to be more frugal. I'd like to make it through the summer with most of my last paycheck left. We'll see, I guess. At any rate, moving things around always makes me feel like I have new stuff, and I'm pretty happy with the changes. For now. ;)

Our big summer fun is a trip to <a href=""http://www.spacecamp.com/museum/"">U.S. Space and Rocket Musuem</a> in Huntsville, AL. This means we'll also get to see <lj user=""nundu_art"">!! I'd be lying if I said I wasn't really, really excited about this. ;) 

The girlies should be home momentarily. When they get here we'll clean out the backpacks and lunchboxes and then hide them away until AUGUST!!! Woo-Hoo!!"

"event","1. Who knew that reading Spock/Uhura fanfiction could be so much fun? I'm particularly enjoying <a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5051526/1/The_Opposite_of_Logic"">this</a> story. Even better, the author seems to be updating every day! And it's not crap! Sweet! In other news, the girls are bugging me to see the movie. I told them next week, when school is out. 

2. The weather here is CRAZY! It's been in the 40's at night, 60's during the day, and crazy wind. The rain is supposed to arrive on Friday, right in time for our Last Day of School Swim Party at preschool. Luckily the party moms have a Plan B. 

3. I can't decide what I think about <a href=""http://theworstreviewever.blogspot.com/"">this blog</a>. It's where authors can submit their worst review in the chance to win sympathy and prizes. Honestly, it kind of makes me want to either 1) never read any of the author's books or 2) read them and and hope I dislike them in order to leave a bad review. 

For the record, in spite of what some of the authors say (that the reviewers would NEVER leave bad reviews if they had to say them to the authhor in person), I would TOTALLY tell <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4067103.Ransom_My_Heart"">Meg Cabot that she and her ghostwriter jumped the shark with Ransom My Heart</a>. I would also tell <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/47466999."">Diana Gabaldon that Outlander made my eyes bleed</a>. I would also ask <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140094.A_Fool_and_His_Honey"">Charlaine Harris if she was smoking CRAX when she wrote A Fool and His Honey</a>. And finally, I would ask <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/27009757."">Katie Crouch to give me back the hours I spent reading her book</a>.

But you know, I'm just mean and snarky in that way. Call me, ladies! :P"

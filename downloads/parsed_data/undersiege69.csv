Sorry for my long abscence. Again, it was the password thing. I apoligize for my carelessness.

Oh, who am I kidding? How long can I keep using that lame excuse? Fact of the matter is...while in Asia for that film festival I got addicted to white opium.

Today I tried to purchase a cellular phone but something went awry.

See, I had no idea that there was this thing called ""credit"" and that when I bought Deloreans just to crash into swamps during the 1980s that I was ""ruining"" it.

I still got my cordless phone though...and they can't take that away...

"event","Where have I been?

Buried under an avalanche?
Stranded on a deserted island?
Stuck to my couch like that fat lady who died?
Dead in a ditch somewhere?

No, my friends, the answer is a simple one.

One that I will share with you now.

The truth of the matter is that I lost my limbs in a poker match with a Korean shop owner in a shack out in the Nevada desert. The limbs were shipped to an Asian fusion restuarant in Hawaii. I paid a German man to build me a full body robotic suit with arms and legs so that I may walk and function like a normal member of society.

With my strange robot suit (think Woody Allen in ""Sleeper""), I hopped the first fan-boat to Honolulu.

Once I arrived, I was greeted by some tough guys posing as Cabana boys at the Marriot resort. My super-human-German-made-Robot-like strength made quick work of the hoodlums and I made my noisy, beep filled way to ""Miso Sowy's Noodle Haus and Grill"". After being held up in a long and pointless conversation with a waiter (who looked suspiciously like Tom Arnold), I kung-fooed my way into the kitchen where I karate chopped some chink who was about to turn my toes into soup.

And it's simple as that, really. I swam back to L.A. Sold my robot body for scrap, used that money to get my limbs surgically re-attached and then told the good people at Earthlink that I would be able to pay them for their services this month.

Ta DA! I'm back!"

Dear Steven,
Me and my wife are expecting our first son in August. I insist we name it after my Grandfather (""James""), she wants to name it ""Gerald"". What should be done about this? Outside of marriage counseling? Or a court of law? Or reality t.v?

-Troube In Topeka.

Dear TIT,
This is a common problem. I say you name the child something completely neutral, like ""Steven"" or ""Seagal"".

XOXO, Steven.

Yeah, it's not so much a fan letter as it is an advice column but it's the first time I've gotten mail not addressed to ""The Pizza Lover @ 12550 Racho Dr"" in a long time.

Dear Mr. Seagal,

I think you are wonderful. I've seen all of your movies. I really enjoy hearing your views on the world's problems. I especially agree about the fact that AIDs is a man made virus. Preach on, Steven! But there is more to this letter than simple compliments. I am fat...just like you. And you have inspired me to do something with my life! I could grow a ponytail, inspire people, wear fringe or make bad movies! Thank you for that! I hope you keep up your horseback riding and here's to turning pro!

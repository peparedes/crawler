"event","the top ten reasons home work (hw) is bad! and other stuff

1) u cant spend a lot more time w/ ur friends
2) u have other things what get in the way 
3) u cant shop more
4) its boring
5) jail is cheaper and probly more fun
6) the only good thing is having cute pens and book covers
7) teachers dont have anything better 2 do... which is sad really sad
8) once again its boring
9) theres a thing called a life
10) teachers should get hobbies
luv ya like all ways! Chantelle"

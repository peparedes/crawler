Cedar Point- I woke up at 6 and got ready. Then we got there at the EXACT same time as Amber.. it was creepy.... So we left and we got paired with Ms.**S** ((we couldnt say her last name)).. and she was pretty cool. She had a daughter( I cant remember her name) and her daughters friend, lauren, was there. She had 2 sons too, Danny and Johnathon. So we got there and we went on the raptor,the MELENIUM FORCE...which was awesomely awesome..., the mantis, the magnum, erm.. other stuff,yeah. We waited like and hour and a half for the force. SO FUN! Then we went home and i asked amber if she thought Danny was sorta kinda cute... she was like ""Cute? HE WAS SMOKING!!!!"" and i was like i know.. he was hoooottttt. 
Rockies- THEY WONT THE PLAY-OFFS!!! THEY ARE AWESOME! I LOVE THEM! I got a trophy that looks like a pie... lol...

good thing about this is nobody reads this...the bad thing is that
...nobody reads this.&nbsp; It's weird.&nbsp; This journal used to be a
place where I could run...where I could just vent when there was no one
else to vent to.&nbsp; The last time I wrote an entry in this was
exactly 4 months ago right after I graduated high school.. a great end
to a great 4 years followed by a great summer....and the beginning of a
great start to college.&nbsp; Now...here I am again...writing and
venting. I guess thats what happens tho...you get throw into a fabulous
new chaos of life where everything ...and I mean everything is
new.&nbsp; I love it here...the people, the atmosphere, the classes,
the teachers...everything.&nbsp; But sometimes I feel alone.&nbsp; And
Im not talking about the two girls hold hands in kindergarden alone and
youre the odd one out, Im talking about the growing up, everyones got a
boyfriend and had sex kind of alone.&nbsp; In reality this really
shouldnt bother me so much because I have some close friends that are
in the same position so in that way Im not alone.&nbsp; But here...the
people that I spend everyday with those are the ones surrounding me in
sex and boyfriends and best friendships...and Im constantly the odd one
out.&nbsp; Maybe theyre right sometimes...maybe I do it to myself
by&nbsp; putting myself in such a position that i set myself out among
the rest.&nbsp; But can you blame me?&nbsp; When my roomate is always
running across the bathroom to hang out with crazy Jamie and talk about
well...everything...or shes on the phone talking to the boyfriend..what
do I have to connect with? I wish I had better confrontational
skills..like when Liz, Jamie and Meg decided to notify Katie and I
quite matter of factly that theyll be tripling next year...which is
fine whatever but I guess it was awkward.&nbsp; Maybe thats how I was
brought up...my mom put me down alot so I learned to just confide in
myself ...and maybe a few other people once in a while.&nbsp; But as
you grow some friends leave...thank god for Jenna...I love having her
close...and Im ecstatic that she came up for the weekend.&nbsp; Even if
I threw up friday and was DD saturday but whatever ...she was happy so
I was happy.&nbsp; And Wendy, maybe Ed and the grents are coming Sunday
to take me for dinner...so thatll be nice.&nbsp; I think I just need a
break.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Or Matt.&nbsp; I miss him.&nbsp; Im extremely happy that he got what he
always wanted tho : Japan.&nbsp; He deserves it ...especially after so
much shit we've dealt with.&nbsp; But I still wish hed email me or
something.&nbsp; I always used to get so pissed at him for not having
time to talk for me...but I understand why...he had a gf and
school...college takes up sooo much time.&nbsp; Hopefully when (i wont
say if) my dad goes down to see him in december he'll take lots of
pictures and things; maybe bring back stuff. My dad deserves a vacation
too.&nbsp; Poor parents...theyre all alone, even Dad said he was
getting lonely and its really quite. Change is hard.<br>
<br>
I dont know what it is I want now, or whats wrong really, and why I
cant sit and talk with the people I live with.&nbsp; I have so much
trouble expressing myself and it sucks.&nbsp;&nbsp; But no one reads
this anyway so its really just random thoughts floating through some
space on teh internet no one will ever read or see...which is good
enough for me.&nbsp; I figure no matter when I write again ....Ill be
single....a virgin...and hopefully still in the PA program.&nbsp; Least
I have friends and family to lean back on.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Ah to
life.<br>
<br>
<br>
I miss you Grandma, Matt, Mel......so many...<br>

<span style=""color: rgb(204, 51, 204);"">So I figured that since the
last time I actually updated this thing was halfway through June, and
its now already July...I guess it was time to update especially since
one very important event fell in that time span.&nbsp; I, along with
the rest of my senior class, am now a GMHS alumni.&nbsp; That's right
guys, WE DID IT!! <br>
<br>
Graduation was AMAZING, especially since it was actually outside for
the first time in the four years we've all been a part of that high
school...and no faculty could completely keep track of any and all
silly string, confetti, confetti bombs, air horns, beach balls, etc.
which we made <span style=""font-style: italic;"">perfectly</span> clear
when we decorated the courtyard, or the penis once we officially
recieved our diplomas.&nbsp; Nick Venn's clever addition of pretending
to fall when he walked across the stage on his crutches was also a very
nice touch...I cant believe how many people asked if he was okay
haha.&nbsp; Nice one Venn. The speeches were also great, Schroe you
rocked and I love you!!...same with Ms. Bastiannse and the rest.&nbsp; <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">CONGRATULATIONS CLASS OF '05</span>...we've
been through so much together and its been great.&nbsp; Especially once
the police actually call and say I can get my purse back! :-) oh
Malcolm.<br>
<br>
..of course, graduating was only the beginning...the partys that
followed were endless as well haha. I've come to realize that
attempting to put in an appearance at about 5 grad parties in one day
is near impossible, especially when one is your own.&nbsp; I'm so glad
so many people made it to mine; family and friends alike my cutting the
cake skills, my uncle's asking if they could come with me to other
parties o man....Marg &amp; Jen's was great too...good times on the
drive there and back with Dan, Pie and Jenn haha&nbsp; Then there was
Watkin's, Schroe's which I really wish I made it to, and Pie's.&nbsp;
The slip n slide really made the day lol...especially when it
increasingly got bigger...and when me and Margee managed to chase down
the ice cream man...love it!<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then Pie had to be all cool and leave us Tuesday the 28th for the USNA...<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I LOVE YOU AND I'LL MISS YOU!</span> ahh the Lindsay's have been split,&nbsp; so many good memories,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with EVERYONE.<br>
<br>
Jenna went for her surgery the day Linds left...and all seems to be
going well; she's due back next wednesday and I'm being updated.&nbsp;
Jenna I love you tons too and we'll see you soon hopefully :-)<br>
<br>
...And with that said, summer's gotten off to an incredible start,
WVA's going pretty well, once I get the nerve to actually take control
of a call...but you know...I'm getting there haha.&nbsp; Work...all I
have to say is another month and I'm done; YES! haha&nbsp; Even Papa
put in his 2 weeks.&nbsp; And orientation was yesterday which went
really well...I met a fair amount of people and despite the whole
catholic deal I think its going to be a good 5 years, considering I
make it through in that amount of time.&nbsp; Then the rents and I went
to dinner and a play at Desales, which turned out to be really funny
and we even managed to make it home by...4 AM...yes. haha <br>
<br>
Let's hope this summer ends the high school chapter of my life in an
amazing way...:-)&nbsp; I love you GMHS...or at least the people and
the memories.&nbsp; God Bless You MG.<br>

<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"">Okay, so it has definitely been
a while since I last updated...woops, sry my life doesn't revolve
around online journals and typing about nothing to no one everyday
haha.&nbsp; So the past couple weeks have definitely been the more
memorable ones...I went to Benny's prom May 21st, and saw those that
are almost strangers now ...and took a prom pic in front of a racecar
haha...gotta remember to get a copy of that:-) Our prom was June
3rd...that was SOOO much fun.&nbsp; Ash, Jen, me Marg, Ally and Bill
all met at my house for pictures and car packing...after hours (or what
seemed like it haha) of endless pictures we got to prom slightly
earlier then planned and bothered Bik for a while, then ate some
amazing food...esp for a prom, and worked it off on the dance
floor.&nbsp; The DJ even got us to play a couple games...I swear there
wasn't a frowning face in there..cept maybe when Hartford's prom tried
to sneak in....hmmm sry theres a slight difference between our
schools...just a slight one.&nbsp;&nbsp; After that craziness..we
somehow managed to get our asses down to Lake Hayward at 1am and
continue the party..with a nice visit from Margees dad in the
morning...haha then Mosquamicut!!! Ahh I love people...mmm coke and
watermelon smirnoff...least Jack and I liked it, who knows why haha.<br>
<br>
That weekened was only the beginning.&nbsp; This week...lets see,
Monday - left school at 10:30 with Pie, Martin and Marg for the state
open to watch Val throw the disc, to find that the meet didnt actually
start til 2 so we had to make a pit stop at Wendy's and 7-11 for some
food, slurpies and to waste some time....only to lie on the bleachers
for 3 hours watching the crazy amazing runners, jumpers etc...and get
burnt.&nbsp; Burn # 2 for Lindsay. haha then I called out of work, AND
couldnt go to windsor to do ambulance hours cuz senior awards were that
night....least I got a scholarship out of it....and took part in Pie's
standing ovation hha GO NAVY!<br>
<br>
Tuesday-amazingly a fairly regular, sweltering day of school complete
with a two hour trip to walmart afterwards with Pie and Margs for
coaches gifts and literally walking down EVERY aisle haha! sooo much
fun.<br>
<br>
Wed-school, got out at 12:50 due to underclassman awards, and went to
Meegan's for a while to swing and catch some more sun with Ash, Amanda,
Jeff, Preddy, Nico and Eva...funtimes...kinda reminded me of his pool
party in 8th grade when ""funny"" included a bucket full of ice dumped on
me and then trying to trap me in it...HAHAHAH. (sarcasm) (angry face).
lol<br>
<br>
Thurs-SENIOR SKIP DAY!...toooo guess where? haha the beach! with Pie
and Hil...soo much fun too...definitely worth it.&nbsp; Our huge cooler
of.....food and ...condiments haha least we had a Navy girl with big
strong arms to carry it right? lol love it.&nbsp; Some nice talks and
dips in the icy water...and frisbeeeee! hehe Love ya girls!<br>
<br>
Friday..hahah well school wasnt so bad minus our last physics quiz
...that doesn't look so promising haha and experiencing yet another day
at school with no air conditioning...yaaa...&nbsp; Then came home, did
some chores, got the paycheck and visited Ash, Colleen and Dave
Suzenski at good ol Gpharm. ...and by 7 the night had begun.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Hmm...pretty sure Nick's away message says it all. lol<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Auto response from <span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 153);"">Bouch (8:29:46 AM)</span>: Let's see, </span><br style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">
<br style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">After evading the police numerous
times, having to ditch my beer and recover it once or twice, slicing my
hand open on a piece of glass and anything else I forgot, the pool was
a nice end to the night ladies lol</span><br style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">
<br style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">And thanks Linds for Nursin me lol<br>
<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"">Yea, it was quality.&nbsp; Good
lil reunion lol and realizing I CAN jump a fence. :-)&nbsp; I guess
losing my beer was one small sacrifice and light up flip flops are
DEFINITELY the best invention ever! lol<br>
<br>
And with that said...today's Saturday and I'm working 11-7
apparently...then talking myself out of going out tonight because as
much as I've lost all motivation for studying and high school in
general...my physics and civics exams are Tuesday and Wednesday of next
week and listening to my mom yell at me for another bad grade isn't
exactly at the top of my list...but then after Wed. high school's
pretty much over, and the Wed. after the Class of '05 will be alumni of
Granby Memorial High School. FUCK YEA KIDS!<br>

so I was told to update this, even though it has only been about a week
since I last did, and I can assure you my life is not <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">that</span>
interesting.&nbsp; But for you dearest Sam and shower buddy, I shall.
lol. So hmm last week wasn't very interesting besides the fact that it
was stressful and upsetting, but you know you live and you lose and in
the end you can only really come out stronger...&nbsp; So last friday
night, Sam and I went to a bball game with Ash, Amanda and Nico in
windsor then headed to Danny Blair's for some chill time...and to say
the least, that night definitely went to shit...sometimes its the good
people that don't get the credit.&nbsp; Fuck that...<br>
<br>
...Saturday was Benny's prom...and Definitely some good times once my
hair was done and I could breathe without completely swallowing hair
spray..lol&nbsp; Dinner, mugs, dancing, random people, random ppl in
Darth Vador masks, Luch...or no Luch? hahhaa o man I'm sure there are
plenty of random pictures of me...definitely good times, and twas nice
to see people I havent seen since middle school (those were the
days...) (haha Kev, Ricky, Pete...weird)<br>
<br>
Sunday...work (big frown) I'm so sick of TJMaxx yet I need more hours.
Dammit.&nbsp; Then Star Wars Episode 3 with Margs, Jen, Ashhole and NO
Celina, Ally, Bill OR Sean (jerks haha)&nbsp; good times...tooo much
soda, and TICKLING!! haha and the weird guy that conned us into buying
that huge thing....RAR hahahah! I love you all!<br>
<br>
Monday - school and all that fun stuff....then my first hours as an
EMT! yaay...too bad I didnt really get any calls haha.&nbsp; But I did
stretcher stuff and all that jazz...still need boots and a uniform but
ya know...I'm getting there.&nbsp; I'm so happy...haha and seeing John
Wilcox as he was getting outa his car and I was getting out of the
ambulance with the two Medics and another EmtB...haha He must have been
so confused.&nbsp; Funny how people move and things change. *big sigh*<br>
<br>
Speaking of change...I've come to the conclusion that Granby High
School is going to hell. In the past week, someones gotten suspended
for drinking, someone overdosed, a cherry bomb was thrown in a toilet
and ...something else I forget...and thats just one week.&nbsp; And I
wondered why I havent gotten any emails about SADD
meetings...hmmm.&nbsp; Its sad how glorified and respected our school
used to be and now its getting uncontrollable....as soon as the
underclassman move up who knows how itll be.&nbsp; I have a&nbsp;
feeling that new track in 2008 or whatever will be pushed waaayyy down
on the priorities list..but oh well I'm graduating.&nbsp; YAY class of
2005, only one more month : )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Friday's our senior
outing (please dont raiiiinnn) then a 3 day weekend (Memorial Day) yay!<br>
<br>
PS ...NCCCs got cancelled today ....outa school early to drive to
Ellington and back haha...least we got ...a javelin and ..half a set of
blocks back from Tolland haha.&nbsp; What a nice day off.<br>

Everyone always laughs about Friday the 13th, joking about the vast
array of unluckiness that overshadows the next 24 hours that you're
forced to face with once thursday's are over.&nbsp; Personally, I never
really had any Friday the 13th stories, its always been just another
day, more time just passing by.&nbsp; Friday May 13th however just isnt
the same.&nbsp; Friday was the day my Grandpa Tomeck passed away.&nbsp;
And of course no matter how close you are or aren't to the individual
whose left you....somewhere inside you you're still filled with this
redundant kind of emptiness.&nbsp; I <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">loved</span>
my Grandparents on my mother's side.&nbsp; My Grandpa unfortunately had
alzheimers or some form of bad dementia for the later part of his life
so I was gone from all his memories, and it was rather difficult or
seemingly meaningless to visit him because he wouldn't remember
that...actually subtract the meaningless and add difficult.&nbsp; I was
scared, and uncomfortable...those ""old folks homes"" never seemed homey
to me, I could never really understand how a person could be happy
there, but fortunately enough I'm not at that point in my life
yet.&nbsp; But I must admit I do remember a lot of things about my
Grandpa from when I was little, when he was just another Grandpa,
yelling at my Grandma to get him food in the regular ""Marty!"" fashion
and always letting us have whatever we wanted...which was generally the
case with my Grandmother as well.&nbsp; However, despite the fact that
I have fewer memories than I may have liked with my Grandpa, his death
makes me think of my Grandma and her passing away several years
ago.&nbsp; I was there beside my Mom until the end of&nbsp; it all; my
Grandma actually joked about who weighed more between me and her right
before she <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">really</span> got
sick.&nbsp; Besides the young memories I have like when my parents
would go on trips and leave my brother and I at my Mom's parents and
theyd feed us til our stomachs we're about to explode,&nbsp; I have
memories right up to when she died which was not long before my cousins
wedding which was another heartbreak...she couldnt be there, though
maybe she was...in spirit.&nbsp; I remember being the mediator.&nbsp;
Every time Id go down to Saratoga with my mother and visit my
Grandmother (my Grandpa was in the nursing home) there was always a
point in which some arguement would start ...whether it was about
something important like my Grandmothers health as she gets older or
what were eatting..there was always an arguement.&nbsp; And I always
knew when.&nbsp; It was like a script in some crap drama that never
quite made it to the set.&nbsp; Almost like it still needed to be
perfected.&nbsp; But it was, because it made me love them more in some
silly way.&nbsp; Of all the times my Mom and my Grandma have been there
for me throughout my life, that was my chance to be there for them,
both of them.&nbsp; And as much as I hated it, when we were on our way
home, I was never upset about it, it was normal.&nbsp; It was
family.&nbsp; And now that time has passed....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its funny when you think about it, life is almost
like a story that doesn't seem to exist until it ends because its then
that you really look back and analyze the memories as well as cherish
them; no matter how good nor how bad..there's no limit to a
memory.&nbsp; However, you're writing your life's story every second of
every minute of every hour of each and every single day with the
choices you make and the paths you take....and the obstacles you make
it through.&nbsp; You write it with adventures, with heartaches, with
pictures, with notes, with stupid mistakes...either way its all in
there.&nbsp; It's when an individual passes on that their story truly
presents itself, because it seems that there is now a beginning a
middle and an end and the saga is finally complete.&nbsp; Death,
however is not an end except for maybe what we see which is our loved
one walking and talking ...but there is no end to their existance
whatsoever.&nbsp; After death they only exist in a new respect, maybe
even a more pleasant one.&nbsp; Unfortunatly we can never really know
until we get there ourselves.&nbsp; But though it may be hard to reach
a major part of your life and have a loved one not be there, the
mistake is in failing to realize that they are there...theyre there
watching every second and their pride is what gives you strength to
face your fears.&nbsp; Of course this is all my thoughts pouring out as
I go because I just needed to get things out...but its also what I feel
is true.&nbsp; I didn't go out last night after work to end up bawling
on the couch of one of the few true amazing friends I have for
nothing.&nbsp; But it was hard to sit there and enjoy myself...I
couldn't even explain it if I tried.&nbsp; I felt the same emptiness I
felt when other loved ones have passed...maybe in a different way but
it was definitely there, and I wanted to just hug someone and hold on
for hours...though I know thatd get a little old, but I did...I wanted
to fill the pain and emptiness even for a minute. And I did...for a
minute or two, but itd come back..sometimes twice as hard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People probably think I'm crazy crying about a
Grandpa...but it wasnt just another Grandpa...I was close..and am still
extremely close to my Mom's side of the family...my Dad's side makes me
feel like some unappreciative outcast that they're obligated to
love.&nbsp; Well, at least my Grandparents on that side, my Aunt's and
Uncle's are great...blah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess I've babbled enough...no one really reads
this anyway...so its time for me to put food in my system and get
through the day.&nbsp; Breakfast, School stuff, work, NY...funeral
tomorrow..then who knows. Ambulance ride time tomorrow?
hmmm....great.&nbsp; I love you.<br>
<br>
Ash, Jeff, Dan...thank you so much. : )<br>

Ok so it's actually not quite summer, but I'd say with a couple 80
degree days we're getting pretty damn close.&nbsp; Two more months
until graduation!!! C.r.a.z.y. Yet soooo exciting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I
must say with the beautiful weather, how I managed to get freaking
walking pnemonia is beyond me....damn colds that leave me vulnerable
for other crazy things to get into my body and turn my lungs
into....what was Ashley's analogy? Oh right, water balloons lol.&nbsp;
It's okay though I suppose I'll let it slide because I'm beating this
freaking thing dammit! ...Let's see I've been some kinda sick for about
two weeks and (over vacation)...so since last Sunday, I've; worked,
hung out with the boys, went to Caitlin's to make dirt and watch Mulan
(""Let's kick some HUNNY buns!"") hahaha, umm got sent home from track
Monday so I went shopping with Jen in Avon, then went to see Guess Who?
with Ash and Amanda...haha funny times. Hmm Tuesday...once I was
officially diagnosed at the Dr.'s office, the craziest beach trip <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ever</span>
began, complete with a trunk full of ...refreshments, lol some rocks, a
bbq, random people lying next to us after we fell asleep on the rocks,
hmm yea fun times. :) Thus I spose it's unecessary to say I went to
track Tuesday either...or yesterday for that matter.&nbsp; So moving
on...Wednesday, I went to the neurologist (yes more doctor's) about my
migraine...haha she was great, thick accent, went to medical school in
South Africa...yea, all that good stuff lol...to be told that I was
most likely having rebound headaches from taking ibuprofen everyday
...so I got more drugs to replace that.&nbsp; Lovely.&nbsp; Then the
madre and I completed about 3 more hours worth of errands...came home
and I got some more sun while she ran even more errands.&nbsp; Probably
was good tho because we actually managed to run the car on empty so we
could fill it up for cheap.&nbsp; And when I say cheap, I mean
cheap..err. There's no such thing as cheap when it comes to gas anymore
really but oh well it was Wednesday so we got that extra 5 cents off
every gallon or whatever.&nbsp; Good deal.&nbsp; Then yesterday,
Thursday...that was my complete and utter lazy Lindsay day.&nbsp; I got
up early...Mom went to Northhampton for the day with friends, Dad went
to work so I slept, watched tv, got mac and cheese mmmmm, slept more
watched more tv....was sleeping til the madre came home even lol and
made her get me Mulan II....which was pretty good but as in most cases,
I preferred the original.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then yeah, my night was
complete with the OC, Gone in 60 Seconds and Rush Hour. schweet.&nbsp;
Sry babes no going out for me last night.<br>
<br>
Then we reached this morning...where I realized not only fuck vacations 
almost over!! but I still feel the same dissappointment in myself and 
anger towards...well yeah, as I did after it all happened..I hate falling
into the same traps I always do, which is why I can't wait to get out of 
here.&nbsp; Some people I really do need to leave behind.<br>
<br>
That's all folks! haha I love you.<br>

its finally Friday the first night of spring break...school took
forever to get over with (but the pepsi/coke taste test in anatomy was
a good end to the day) , then came track and a&nbsp; bit of the
softball game against Tolland, then home for about an hour, Steve's to
eat and chill with ""Mommy and Daddy"" lol then the school again for the
volleyball tournament which made me cough more, get stressed over the
loss of Mr. Livsey's master key, and eyes burn cuz of the dryness of
the air...then me and Sam left and headed for the woods which of course
didnt work out cuz well its eg and somehow I always tend to have bad
luck with that town, so after getting there and getting hung up on
twice and no one picking up their phones we headed to Amanda's and
Scott's. Mi favoritos!! haha Drank, played cards, made fun of ppl,
Scott threw&nbsp; bottle caps down my shirt,&nbsp; I wrestled
Chris...good times...minus me&nbsp; being called a bitch again but
eh...work tomorrow will handle that(blah) stupid TJMaxx...cant WAIT to
hand in my 2 weeks notice now especiallyy since they changed the breaks
and are most likely promoting Alison...stupid dumbasses...she fricken
wanted to make a fake hold so a customer couldnt have some ugly
purse...yet I get called discriminitive because I didnt ask some lady
of a darker color to donate a dollar for autism. Now one&nbsp;
question. WHY would I discriminate for charity? I dont
understand.&nbsp; And why do guys who tell me they wanna hang out hang
up on me or&nbsp; not answer their phones? Whatever, 4 months and
Desales here&nbsp; I&nbsp; come lol. ""She is beautiful but she don't
mean a thing to me""&nbsp; -maybe thats me towards like everyone...minus
the beauty..but looks dont matter to me anyways.&nbsp; Least Sam and
the crew &lt;3 me!! haha Can't believe how fast time flies!!!<br>
<br>
Ok well since I'm still smuggling coughs so my mom doesn't wake up I'm going to head to beddd..ssslllleeeeeppp. I &lt;3 YOU!<br>

<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"">So I know it's been awhile, but
what can I say, I've been busy.&nbsp; I'm not real sure I can sum up
everything thats happened in the past month or so&nbsp; since I last
updated this thing...but I can try!!&nbsp; First of all, track started
a couple weeks ago which is nice...though it makes me even busier it
keeps me in shape and gives me something to do after school.&nbsp; Our
first meet was last Tuesday and our 4x1 team WON! I was ecstatic! I
heart my girls -&gt; Leah, Emma and Vicki YAY!&nbsp; Then I pulled
third in the 100 and Leah got first and the 200 eh.....we wont go there
lol&nbsp; Even though Ellington ended up kicking our asses it was still
a pretty good meet despite the fact that it was freeezing.&nbsp;
Unfortunately I think the cold broke me down so now I have a
cold...errrgg no track for me today.&nbsp; But since Im one of the
captains I figured Id stay and sit and watch/help.&nbsp; Plus, it gave
me another chance to yell at Sarah Fischer aka cargo pants because
thats ALL she wears to practice...Dont even ask how that could be
comfortable.&nbsp; Plus her only event is the 100m hurdles and at the
meet she quit...she jogged to the first one stopped and walked off, yea
ok so no matter what your in basically the last heat so you're not
gonna place but can you at least have the respect and stamina to finish
the damn race...grrr.&nbsp; Some people.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Hmm so lets see, what else has happened?...I finally got my EMT
certification and the cards came in the mail today so I was absolutely
stoked about that.&nbsp; I can save peoples lives!! ...Gonna have to
get on that for this summer applying to places and such.&nbsp; Pie's
officially going to the naval academy...crazy, she has to cut her hair
for the first two months short enough that it wont touch the top of her

You all know <br>who you are :-D So yeah this past week sucked major balls, and I cant even completely explain why, <br>part of it I guess is that I know that if timing had been better I could have something potentially<br>very happy with someone but hey instead I get the same old ""its not worth it schpeel"" Yeah, lemme tell<br>you about whats not worth it. Its not worth going through what Ive gone through with guys all for the <br>same outcome. Poo. The next time I hear the ""its not worth it"" the sentence better be something like <br>""losing you is not worth it"" haha or something mildly happy at least. But whatever my week was crappy<br>for more then that...I think Ive mostly been extra stressed lately thinking about the upcoming months <br>and everything, its crazy.  That and my mom bugs me alot, as much as she tries to help I really just<br>need lots of alone time to think and everything because really there arent a great deal of people I can<br>sit and have long talks about things with. :-( Unfortunately. Matt was up for the week on spring break<br>which was kind of nice though I didnt see him an extra lot, but I dont expect to so it was fine.  Ma, <br>Matt, Dad and I went out to the Japanese place in Bloomfield, yum to sushi then saw Hostage with Bruce<br>Willis at the theatre...and crossed paths with Chels, Sean Klein and Clint of all people. Fun stuff.<br>So that was nice. Got home round 9:30 ..didnt feel like goin out so I slept. YAY!.  Saturday was eh. <br>Work, which consisted of smashing my finger in the sliding jewelry doors and hearing about Papa's <br>Friday night. (So happy for ya! I heart you!) Then put some stuff on layaway, went home and changed, <br>stopped by Scotties and got my car stuck lol which was eh alright, not a great deal of ppl so I <br>chilled, had a smirnoff and went to Als...con Sammy dear. lol  That lead to more shittiness....Justins<br>an asshole and blah I have to much history with EG.  But <span style=""font-style: italic;"">some</span> people still made it <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">a lot</span> better ;-)<br>Ah well, you live and you learn.<br><br>Off to do some calc and relax so I dont get another migraine...I &lt;3 you.<br></pre>"

"event","Nothin' bout love is less than confusing
You can win when you're losing, stand when you're falling
I can't figure it out.
Nothin' bout love can make an equation nothin' short of amazing
Wish I could explain it
But I don't know how.
~Leann Rimes

Recently, a friend wrote a big long entry in his xanga about friends; what they are, who they are, what 
they mean to a person..etc. And yesterday when I first read it I thought, ""I know all this, I love my 
friends to death and are what I value the most."" But then, me being...me learned alot more last night.  
I managed to turn a hilarious night full of stupid dancing, beer pong, jello shots, heart to hearts lol
 and just plain good times into me fighting and crying about driving home.  All this didnt go without bailing on another friend mind you...(sry! :-/) But yeah, seeing as how I was too retarded (in all senses 
of the word) to calm down for two minutes and try to explain what the hell was wrong, I definitely caused 
a rather large comotion and, well personally, I woulda been mad at me.  I knew underneath all the whining
and crying and fighting that I couldnt drive, and Nick was right when he said Id thank him after...I truly
 do appreciate that they cared enough to literally fight me on it.  But Im not sure I  even wanted to 
drive, mostly I knew I just HAD to get home and soon. And about 90% of myself was mad and upset that I lost
so much control of the situation. I was a complete moron and for that I reaaallly want to call out of work
today so that I dont have to face people.  Yeah Im a chicken like that. And I hate it.  So yeah about friends, I really wouldnt be anywhere without them, I mean I was drinking like 5 seconds down the road and
I couldnt even freakin stay straight enough to drive that far home. Thank god for people that take keys.
I love you all really I do even if Im dumb.  I love that I can feel completely safe with my friends and
completely comfortable with myself when Im around them... even when Im silly and random and probably 
stupidly embarrassing to be around.  Thats what makes life living for...not the food, not the successes in
money and jobs, though those help you build confidence and be proud and they are a major element, not the 
dating relationships except for those where youre boyfriend/girlfriend is youre best friend, but the 
relationships with friends ..they truly mean the world to me, and probably most people.  

Its crazy what we put people through to kind of subconsciously prove their friendship to us and visa versa.
  You dont mean to make them fight you for youre own safety, but they do because they love you and they 
care about you and if they didnt they wouldnt truly be a good friend because they didnt look out for you.
 Which is rather twisted because when youre caught up in something you just want things to happen the way
you want them to and when they dont you get angry, but youre not really angry at anyone...mostly youre just
angry with yourself for being so stupidly naive.  Its a crazy world but weve all been there and were still
growing up and pushing ourselves to be that perfect person and through it all we'll constantly make our 
mistakes and learn from them...some more than once.  But we'll always have someone there whose ballsy (sp?) enough to tell us we're being idiots and we'd do the same for them...and then when its all over hug them 
and tell them that its okay.  And thats the best part, the forgiveness and leeway you have to be yourself.

Thats all for now I think, I love you and I'm sorry, but I definitely had fun and hopefully I didn't 
completely ruin anyones night. This weekend has been a wide world of unexpected..friday night dinner and 
then suffield wha? lol Ah the people in my life..."

SUCH a good mood right now and I don't even know why...maybe because I
have the best friends EVER...or maybe because I'm seriously considering
having a jello shot cake at my wedding...though getting a guy first
might be a good idea, but ya know its just a good thing for my
imaginary wish list. So hmm a lot of people seem to be praying for a
snow day tomorrow and though part of me feels like it would be
incredibly nice...I still don't want to be in school in July, though as
a senior I figure I'll skip like the last weekof school anyway for the
beach and such so hey bring on the snow! ....Thank god I didnt have a
crazy amount of hmwk tonight...or the SADD meetings...theyre moved to
thursday but ahh I have to work, which means no OC either *sigh* such

mostly do to the fact that Neil called out (big angry face) so twas me
at the service desk with Alison...which on good days, I can
handle..well guess my luck ran low today cuz I was close to taking the
tag attacher and putting it through her eye.&nbsp; Okay no not really,
Im not that hostile but still....Then theres Carol the fitting room
Nazi...okay yeah we have a whole Revolution going on at Tjmaxx
lol.&nbsp; And I still can't decide if I like Mr Gaudette...maybe hes
too quiet for me I dont know...but anywho..yay for more hours during
the week which means BIGGER PAYCHECKS! lol&nbsp; o well..okay lets
see...last night I chilled with Samm and her friend Krimp who seemed
pretty cool...haha shower buddies for life &lt;3&nbsp; We basically
started our own granby party at Al's too with Kym, Ash, Em,
Katie....and John and the bestest boys! haha (that made me sound about
2 years old but hey)&nbsp; Eg girls are really retarded too...who talks
shit when we didnt even do anything except oh wait take the handful of
quality guys you have in youre town? ha my bad ...guess we're just real
and yeah...just better in general sry really i am. lol<br>
<br>
And as far as boys go theyre getting dumb...there really are always two
sides to a story...then they get hippocritical and lie...yeah not
cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh well though.&nbsp; My house was fun the two
days I had people over...yea jello shots rock ...especially when we
make them cuz we're skilled ;-)&nbsp; Good times!&nbsp; And a Special
thanks to Nick for well...yeah. lol I HEART YOU!<br>

<br>
Well, for starters I must say that this weekend was an <span style=""font-style: italic;"">incredible</span>
beginning to vacation. So school got out friday, Jenn picked me up to
get our paychecks, then I came home and waited for the wonderful
parents to leave...yaayy haha. Then Sam and I went to Cosis with, no
gas and my impaired directionalism lol if thats even a correct way to
say&nbsp; it.&nbsp; Then to the bball game (Granby vs Canton) which of
course, the boys rocked! Then my bestest Stevie and Nick stopped by to
bring....what my paycheck went to basically, lots and lots of
bottles.&nbsp; Steve stayed for a while and we made a S&amp;S run for
limes and jello...which made for a delicious desert and a crazy night
haha.&nbsp; Steve left at like 1230, and&nbsp; Sam slept over...then
the real craziness begun.&nbsp; Worked 12-6 Saturday, came home for a
bit, and then slowly my house turned into something of a zoo...except
of people, very non sober people lol.&nbsp; Pong, random
conversations...people eatting catfood, Posk's egged car, me...well
yeah I'm a whole story by myself lol. *angel face* Quite the
night...which made for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">quite </span>the cleanup. But most definitely worth it...even if the madre was a little suspicious seeing as how theres always <span style=""font-style: italic;"">something</span>
thats gonna be missed...fortunately enough it was a cup of beer and I
managed to say it was mine and be fine.&nbsp; Unfortunately however,
work sucked yesterday mostly cuz I was dead tired so I didnt go out
after with Jen and Des :-(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (NEXT TIME THO!) El
stopped in too to return a blanket? lol I probably wouldnt even have
known it was gone. oops. Jen and Des came in too...non showered...hmm
kinda like hippies huh?... haha JUST KIDDING&nbsp; Definitely a great
weekend tho ""LINNNNNDSAY""-Des,&nbsp; ""NO SEXX!"" - me lol....and much

<span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">This
is my tribute to the nice girls. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">To the nice girls who are overlooked,
who become friends and nothing more, who spend hours fixating upon
their looks and their personalities and their actions because it must
be they that are doing something wrong. This is for the girls who don't
give it up on the first date, who don't want to play mind games, who
provide a comforting hug and a supportive audience for a story they've
heard a thousand times. This is for the girls who understand that they
aren't perfect and that the guys they're interested in aren't either,
for the girls who flirt and laugh and worry and obsess over the
slightest glance, whisper, touch, because somehow they are able to keep
alive that hope that maybe... maybe this time he'll have understood.
This is an homage to the girls who laugh loud and often, who are
comfortable in skirts and sweats and combat boots, who care more than
they should for guys who don't deserve their attention.</span> This is for
those girls who have been in the trenches, who have watched other girls
time and time again fake up and make up and fuck up the guys in their
lives without saying a word. This is for the girls who have been there
from the beginning and have heard the trite words of advice, from
""there are plenty of fish in the sea,"" to ""time heals all wounds."" This
is to honor those girls who know that guys are just as scared as they
are, who know that they deserve better, who are seeking to find it.</span><br style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">
<br style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">This
is for the girls who have never been in love, but know that it's an
experience that they don't want to miss out on. For the girls who have
sought a night with friends and been greeted by a night of catcalling,
rude comments and explicit invitations that they'd rather not have
experienced. This is for the girls who have spent their weekends
sitting on the sidelines of a beer pong tournament or a case race, or
playing Florence Nightingale for a vomiting guy friend or a comatose
crush, who have received a drunk phone call just before dawn from
someone who doesn't care enough to invite them over but is still
willing to pass out in their bed. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">This is for the girls who have left
sad song lyrics in their away messages, who have tried to make someone
understand through a subliminally appealing profile, who have time and
time again dropped their male friend hint after hint after hint only to
watch him chase after the first blonde girl in a skirt. This is for the
girls who have been told that they're too good or too smart or too
pretty, who have been given compliments as a way of breaking off a
relationship, who have ever been told they are only wanted as a friend.</span></span><br style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">
<br style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">This
one's for the girls who you can take home to mom, but won't because
it's easier to sleep with a whore than foster a relationship; this is
for the girls who have been led on by words and kisses and touches, all
of which were either only true for the moment, or never real to begin
with. This is for the girls who have allowed a guy into their head and
heart and bed, only to discover that he's just not ready, he's just not
over her, he's just not looking to be tied down; this is for the girls
who believe the excuses because it's easier to believe that it's not
that they don't want you, it's that they don't want anyone. This is for
the girls who have had their hearts broken and their hopes dashed by
someone too cavalier to have cared in the first place; this is for the
nights spent dissecting every word and syllable and inflection in his
speech, for the nights when you've returned home alone, for the nights
when you've seen from across the room him leaning a little too close,
or standing a little too near, or talking a little too softly for the
girl he's with to be a random hookup. This is for the girls who have
endured party after party in his presence, finally having realized that
it wasn't that he didn't want a relationship: it was that he didn't
want you. I honor you for the night his dog died or his grandmother
died or his little brother crashed his car and you held him, thinking
that if you only comforted him just right, or said the right words, or
rubbed his back in the right way then perhaps he'd realize what it was

never happen, and the sunrise you saw the next morning after failing to
sleep.</span><br style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">

friends"" comment after you read more into a situation than he ever
intended; this is for never realizing that when you choose friends, you
seldom choose those which make you cry yourself to sleep. This is for
the hugs you've received from your female friends, for the nights
they've reassured you that you are beautiful and intelligent and
amazing and loyal and truly worthy of a great guy;</span> this is for the
despair you all felt as you sat in the aftermath of your tears, knowing
that that night the only companionship you'd have was with a pillow and
your teddy bear. This is for the girls who have been used and abused,
who have endured what he was giving because at least he was giving
something; this is for the stupidity of the nights we've believed that
something was better than nothing, though his something was nothing
we'd have ever wanted. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">This is for the girls who have been satisified
with too little and who have learned never to expect anything more: for
the girls who don't think that they deserve more, because they've been
conditioned for so long to accept the scraps thrown to them by guys.</span></span><br style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">
<br style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">This
is what I don't understand. Men sit and question and whine that girls
are only attracted to the mean guys, the guys who berate them and
belittle them and don't appreciate them and don't want them; who use
them for sex and think of little else than where their next conquest
will be made. Men complain that they never meet nice girls, girls who
are genuinely interested and compelling, who are intelligent and sweet
and smart and beautiful; men despair that no good women want to share
in their lives, that girls play mindgames, that girls love to keep them
hanging. Yet, men, I ask you: were you to meet one of these genuinely
interested, thrillingly compelling, interesting and intelligent and
sweet and beautiful and smart girls, were you to give her your number
and wait for her to call... and if you were to receive a call from her
the next day and she, in her truthful, loyal, intelligent and
straightforward nice girl fashion, were to tell you that she finds you
intriguing and attractive and interesting and worth her time and
perhaps material from which she could fashion a boyfriend, would you or
would you not immediately call your friends to tell them of the
""stalker chick"" you'd met the night prior, who called you and wore her
heart on her sleeve and told the truth? And would you, or would you
not, refuse to make plans with her, speak with her, see her again, and
once again return to the bar or club or party scene and search once
more for this ""nice girl"" who you just cannot seem to find? Because
therein lies the truth, guys: we nice girls are everywhere. But you're
not looking for a nice girl. You're not looking for someone genuinely
interested in your intermural basketball game, or your anatomy midterm
grade, or that argument you keep having with your father; you're
looking for a quick fix, a night when you can pretend to have a
connection with another human being which is just as disposable as the
condom you were using during it.</span><br style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">
<br style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">So don't say you're on the
lookout for nice girls, guys, when you pass us up on every step you
take. Sometimes we go undercover; sometimes we go in disguise:
sometimes when that girl in the low cut shirt or the too tight
miniskirt won't answer your catcalls, sometimes you're looking at a
nice girl in whore's clothing - - we might say we like the attention,
we might blush and giggle and turn back to our friends, but we're all
thinking the same thing: ""This isn't me. Tomorrow morning, I'll be
wearing a teeshirt and flannel shorts, I'll have slept alone and I'll
be making my hungover best friend breakfast. See through the disguise.
See me."" You never do. Why? Because you only see the exterior, you only
see the slutty girl who welcomes those advances. You don't want the
nice girl.. so don't say you're looking for a relationship:
relationships take time and energy and intent, three things we're
willing to extend - - but in return, we're looking for compassion and
loyalty and trust, three things you never seem willing to express.
Maybe nice guys finish last, but in the race they're running they're
chasing after the whores and the sluts and the easy-targets... the nice
girls are waiting at the finish line with water and towels and a
congradulatory hug (and yes, if she's a nice girl and she likes you,
the sweatiness probably won't matter), hoping against hope that maybe
you'll realize that they're the ones that you want at the end of that
silly race.</span><br style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">
<br style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">
<span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">So maybe it won't last forever. Maybe some of those
guys in that race will turn in their running shoes and make their way
to the concession stand where we're waiting; however, until that
happens, we still have each other, that silly race to watch, and all
the chocolate we can eat (because what's a concession stand at a race
without some chocolate?)</span>"

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">Yeah. Its official - I'm single
again, 6 months ish was enough of me I guess. (ha) ...but oh well life
goes on..and amazingly my mom was actually kinda cute about it.&nbsp;
...So I'm upstairs showering and getting work done and sorting out
final thoughts in my head and whats she do? She creates a Rules to live
by list on guess what? Boys.&nbsp; haha<br>
<br>
So here it is: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.
Never let a guy feel totally confident. (You are his girlfriend.) <span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">(eh...never really thought bout that one)</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Never</span> spend more on him than he does on you. (Its a macho thing) <span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">(PS i hate people paying for me with the exception of gifts lol)</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Never let a guy know you are hurt. (That is girlfriend talk.) <span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">(yeah..I tend to need them to know how they made me feel...which usually makes me feel worse but o well)</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.
Always choose a guy a bit older than you. (Girls are 2-3 years more
mature than boys.) <span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">(Apparently thats a statistic lol)<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5. Always put your college goals ahead of any guy (When you are 27ish
if the guy is older and has a good job you can relax this one a little)
<span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">(I need to be more realistic I guess...)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">6. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">MOST IMPORTANT: </span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Always</span> keep a small circle or 1-2 <span style=""font-style: italic;"">close</span> girlfriends (Be loyal, get loyalty back) <span style=""color: rgb(204, 102, 204);"">(I love my close friends to the end)<br>
<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">Haha so yeah...sometimes
parents are amazing! or at least nice enough to calm down the constant
yelling to study and do homework and care about the fact that I haven't
eaten and cant appreciate a huge lobster dinner cuz I'm exhausted and
tired and hurt.&nbsp; I just might miss them when I go to pennsylvania.
(notice I dont have to sign my name to that lol)&nbsp; And of course,
Steveoh and Papa and Jenn and Sam and Jenna and Margs and Bethany and
Ali and ahhh the list goes onn....</span><br>

Alison's car to go home and search for a spare or another keypad (thank

the fact that I was standing, yet there were NOO seats cuz Avon sat on
our side...SON OF A SLUT! lol! Ok yeah so we didnt win, but it was a
good game...especially with Ally Maynard and Ash Bascetta screaming at
the other team constantly haha...""whered you get your hair done 45!?""
lol o wow...then back to Margs for pizza and the notebook....aww such
an emotional movie..but it was fun, even if Nick, Stevie and Papa had

<span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"">Well, I can honestly say that
I've just experienced (well acutally its not gonna end until after this
weekend but thats ok) the worst week since sophomore year....I
seriously have nooo idea what happened, where it all came from and why
it was all not brought up until last night.&nbsp; I know it was a risk
to try something that really didnt look very promising seeing as how
itd be and is still incredibly difficult to see him when we go to
different schools, but for some reason, from some random place I had
complete faith that if we tried hard enough it could work.&nbsp; I
didnt need it to last forever, just to last without...well without
this.&nbsp; I just wanted someone I knew I could go to, someone that
cared about me as much as I did about them.&nbsp; Unfortunately, like
most things I think I was pretty wrong. An hour and a half of talking
last night and I got nothing but a stomach ache, a sleepless night and
the same things rolling over and over in my head trying to figure out
why I was so oblivious and naive.&nbsp; I mean yeah I knew things
havent even been close what a relationship should be, but somehow I
overlooked alot.&nbsp; Call me a hopeless romantic....cuz at the moment
thats all I really feel like....maybe even incredibly blind and
stupid...yeah that too.&nbsp; Even kind of alone.&nbsp; I mean yeah
people say they're there if you need to talk, but come one what person
with an awesome relationship going for them really wants to know about
someone elses going to shambles besides maybe to make them feel better
but thats no help to the person whose world just got blown away.&nbsp;
Well actually,&nbsp; I shouldnt say that, cuz I cant say it was a
complete surprise...it was just a lot in one night.&nbsp; I mean I
tried to analyze every part of our conversation about 5 times and
everything just leaves me exhausted and dizzy and confused.&nbsp;
Almost like everythings been pretty fake...I mean ""i should have
brought this up sooner but hey i procrastinate"" doesnt exactly make me
feel better...I'm sorry that I'm something you feel you can put off and
deal with later. Not that I'm blaming him, I mean he is right...even if
it sucks.&nbsp; But I wish I had known sooo much sooner and not have
allowed myself to get caught up in something that was going to make me
feel....like this.&nbsp; Yeah okay I get to talk to you about this
probably Saturday, but I can tell you now that I'm not going to know
anymore about what to say or how this is all going to end than I do
now.&nbsp; But I do now that I'm going to start dreading going to work,
something that I actually liked for a while because I get along with
every single person there basically and yeah.&nbsp; I need that for one
more summer til college.&nbsp; Whats worse is all this time I've wanted
to see him again and I've missed him, now...I dread the next time I see
him because not only do I not know where things are going but I don't
even know how I'm going to react to seeing him.&nbsp; Blah.<br>
<br>
Funny though, thats probably the worst part of this week, but
definitely not the only thing wrong.&nbsp; First of all, yesterday
started off bad even before all that....when god damn Mr. O'Neil
FLIPPED out on me because I said I copy - pasted a bunch of picture
boxes for the yearbook spreads I did and apparently that makes them
show up blank in the proofs (according to him).&nbsp; So I feel like
shit because I'm the only god damn person that took control of the
whole thing and started putting them together - I mean Jenna was
definitely right there helping too but for the what? 8 people in our
group? 2 of us are doing everything and then getting treated like
there's no hope of us pulling through and putting it all together? well
fuck. I'm sorry that I've been using two of my three studyhalls every
damn day to get this done when I could easily be doing something else.
haha like playing cards and screaming cuz I get all into it (you know
you love me guys!) o man its rediculous.&nbsp; That and I actually
think civics makes me dumber...what a waste of a class.&nbsp; Then
yeah, I cant keep great grades in physics, and this fucking emt shit
.....yeah I'm sucha failure...least I'm good at it.<br>
<br>
Ahh fuck it all. I just need all this to end. That and a hug maybe. a
real big hug.&nbsp; That might help.&nbsp; Blah...off to try and learn
more stuff and probably force feed some food into me cause yeah
definitely not hungry - see this really does suck, cant even appreciate
food anymore.<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span></span><br>"

be no sex in my car, on my car, or.....with...my car...lol ...PAPA!!
...haha yea poor chris...always settin himself up for these things,
haha Ice cream + salt = &lt;3 hhaha! Funniest thing EVER!&nbsp; Too bad
Neil and Brian missed that one..&nbsp; hehe but Neil came to Stevies
later so its all good...lol.&nbsp; He makes me so happy :-D (my
car...too be continued lol hun)&nbsp; And I finally gave him his
present yesterday after forgetting ....how many times? lol&nbsp; woops.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
....I realized last night how much Ive changed and how much my friends
have changed in basically the past year....like last week I realized
why I dont hang out in EG anymore, unless its a Jenn Hann connection
lol, I dont chill with Ash much anymore, when I party I like to
stay...untouched ha and I dont drink much, everythings changing yet I
like it....is crazy.&nbsp; People Ive literally grown up with and been
friends with forever and though its sad in a general perspective...no
ones crying over it.&nbsp; Yeah sometimes opposites attract, even with
friendships, but when 2 people can barely find one thing in common its
hard to remain close.&nbsp; Its crazy to think that this time next year
Ill be in college busy as ever and my friends will probably consist of
a small handful of granby people and a few others and other then that
itll be people I dont even know exist right now.....I cant wait!<br>
<br>
I dunno....too much on my mind hfsehiesfiy....hehe work in an hour...I love you all.<br>

<span style=""color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"">Okay so...first of all the week
back after vacation was busy, but not too deadly.&nbsp; We got our
Yearbook shirts which arent that bad despite the fact that I can make
mine into a short dress if i wanted to...hmm I could even use that to
my advantage, theres a yearbook advertisement for ya lol.&nbsp;
Wednesday and Thursday we were treated with a early release and a
wonderful day off due to the Snow/freezing rain storm, but not without
of course having a full physics double period wed...unfortunately long
enough to take that quiz...yuck.&nbsp; Well I must admit I did spend
probably about 90% of my time this week looking forward to the weekend,
mostly cuz there's someone I can't wait to see and mostly cuz school
kills me sometimes..though I guess after last night I'm not too sure
whats so great about this whole weekend thing.&nbsp; First of all I
probably could have hung out with Neil or something but no I decided I
had barely talked to Ash and that crew in forever so I might as well
give that a shot - well now I know why I havent.&nbsp; Blah sucks when
you think you know people but then ya realize time changes everything
and sometimes people dont really care about throwing their lives away
while others think they have the right to touch whomever whereever just
because theyve had a few to many; yeah okay no.&nbsp; I'm not even mad
at anyone really....well except touchy man but I guess I shoulda
expected that from him seein as how I entered the room and he picked me
up and threw me on the couch....I'm just annoyed that I put myself in
that position where I didnt feel safe...I coulda been with someone sooo
much better even if to him it was ""just another school night"" and ""we
always have saturday night""...not that he seemed mad but blah I feel
like such a whiner.&nbsp; The only two people that really listened to
me where ones I barely see but I love em lol....funny how that works
out.<br>
<br>
Guess Papa was right when he sent me that im last night, and guess I
was right about what I thought all along....Sucks being right
sometimes...<br>
<br>
But, on a happier note, I hung out with the brother when I got back
last night til like 3am and talked and watched Kill Bill 2, so that was
kinda nice considering hes leaving tomorrow...crazy it feels like he
just got here.<br>
<br>
That and the madre went skiing with Bruce Allen today after having the
Havens Mcolgans (sp?) over for dinner last night...yet its like
freezing rain outside but hey who knows bout up north I guess lol<br>
<br>
Now Im off to chill and possibly do some homework before work at 5...wootwoot...Love you all.&nbsp; Happy <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Late</span> Birthday Jenn Hann!<br>

there ya go, goodbye 2004! Ahh this vacation has been so great, so
incredibly short but still very great.&nbsp; First of all the week of
Christmas and the start of vacation we had 2 snow days in a row....so
we ended up with a day and a half of school...yes! Then Christmas was
fun...normal family time complete with movies, drinking and lots of
good food that does nothing but give you a stomach much like Santa
Claus himself - <span style=""font-style: italic;"">very</span> good
times.&nbsp; Then me Matt and the Rents took a trip to Lake Placid for
a couple days...that was also a great time despite the icy skiing and
the freeezing cold temperatures - its ok though cuz Ma had the
Digonnero to keep us warm right? lol Then hmm came home, worked and
unpacked, skiied Thursday with Jeff, John and Ryan...good times..Ry
flying through the trees haha yep new method of boarding....I hadnt
seen them in the longest time....4 people and their ski equipment in
Johns car ...hell yes lol Then hmm New years eve day wasnt all that
exciting....tried physics, failed horribly, spent my last real day of
complete laziness very well....in my bed napping lol figuring out what
exactly was up for the night.&nbsp; Then Steveoh came around 5ish, met
the mommy hehe (vodka martinis? ..diet soda..hmm haha) and we went to
get the pizza and yumminess....<br>
<br>
...yeah very crazy night...very drunken crazy night.....bonfire next
door...coyote ugly haha I dont even know, just happy someone drove me
home and when I got there I could still stand lol and then pass on in
my bed to wake up this morning with the worst case of the hiccups
ever...haha good times!...as always:-D I love you all!&nbsp; Now I get
to work all day and get paid time and a half for it....yay! lol<br>
<br>
2005's gonna be excellent!<br>

Then Ash and I ran away and chilled with Jeff, John and Danny, ran to friendlys for some ice cream and hung out with Jose and Phil a bit then went back...twas a good night.&nbsp; Then Saturday was the Field Hockey finals at Trinity at 11 am....and Granby takes the Gold again!!! We killed Canton...kinda makes ya wish soccer went farther but still.....it was great, and cold lol Then us cool girls (Me, Jenna, Jenn, Margs and Ash hole) went to Wendys...cuz theres nothing better then Wendys. : ) Then I went to good old work with the gang and we all took a trip to chilis after (Me, Papa, Neil, Steve and Nick) hahah ""youre id looks like its been in a fire..."" aww poor nick lol ""Ahhh wouldnt it be weird if i got turned on by a ...""ahhaha!

Not too bad...had a couple interviews on Veterans day at Desales (for the PA program) and Philidelphia....and they truly couldnt have gone better....I'm so excited for college and a new life!...Shitty that the girls lost to Somers that day and I wasnt there to partake in the shedding of the tears...but I guess we all have to make sacrifices sometime ay? and hey the Soccer dinner/ awards night its tomorrow so itll all be worth it..and hopefully the field hockey team will take states again saturday against canton...we'll i of course will be working....sooo fun.&nbsp; Speaking of the field hockey team, My attempts along with Jenna (vote her for president! haha) and Ashley Y to go to their semifinal game failed due to the fact that it was postponed and we didnt know til we got there...so hey a fun ride to UCONN, 2 hours at wendys, a trial run of the glow in the dark escape latch thing in jennas trunk and hey one fun night hahaa ...Megga yearbook pics of clubs going on too....Varsity and jv computer club...and Rons on the A-list...how cool! haha Ronald ...working at Mcdonalds...coincidence? I think not! haha</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff>Speaking of boys....some days ya love em and some days you just wanna walk away and wish ya didnt know em....some will always like certain girls, haha some will always lie to keep their options open and some youll spend time with just to have fun even though you both no its not going anywhere....so I thought about it and realized that this time next year I wont be talkin to half the people I do now, nor will I want to.&nbsp; Its rather silly, somewhat sad and somewhat exciting all at the same time....cant wait to have a whole new life.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff>Then theres work....which brought a whole group of the best of friends into my life....mostly guys...but hey girls suck sometimes (sry ladies ya know i love ya but the drama shits gotta be cut off of our rep lol) only could they make me Chubaca one week cuz I hadnt shaven my legs recently...and barbie the next haha Yes I live in Chris' bed...we have nighttime bowling competitions with his dog....as the bowling ball hahaha o man goood times....CHINESE!!! ...god writing my senior mems was hard and def didnt include HALF the best times but the ones that matter know it. hehe</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff>And with that said....and the world being not sucha bad place right now...til maybe tomorrow when report cards get sent and my physics problems become a true reality...im gonna go shreak with excitement about the OC and laugh at how incredibly rediculous my kitten is and sleep and yeah who really knows what....but there ya go story of my life...until next time..</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#330099>Lots of lyrics seem to describe my feelings or life or whatever right now...yet Im so confused ...o well though...this weeks been full of the same busy-ness as the past couple with work and everything, though its been exciting cause Posk, Jose, Phil and even&nbsp;Flynn have stopped by to visit me after work a couple times...though its annoyin cause ever since my ma&nbsp; heard about brians party shes been sketchy about EG kids again...i hate judgemental people, they make things so much shittier.&nbsp; Yesterday I went on Chris's boat with him for a couple hours, it was good to spend some time with him again...its been awhile but I really dont know whats to come later...especially after last night im not really sure what i want...i wish people could just be friends with you and let things happen..and if time goes by and nothings changed then nothing probably will...people can love eachother and not be in love...but its so much harder being friends with someone when they have expectations or something...people need to just let fate run its&nbsp; course.&nbsp; Matt almost started to bring up the kinda guys i hang out with alot or like or w.e...and being the big brother and i have to protect lindsay kinda guy that he is...hes a lil judgemental sometimes too, but part of me understands where hes coming from...i dont look for perfect people, i look for people i can really get along with, connect with or just spend a large amount of time with without even considering walking away.&nbsp; I dont have a boyfriend now because frankly i havent been looking for one, i have plenty of incredible friends both girls and guys alike and i dont necesarily have the time or the freedom for a boyfriend..cant drive and mom gives matts gf enough crap when matt does somethin dumb n ppl shouldnt have to deal with her shit.&nbsp; Last year i was close to rock bottom ...and im never goin there again.&nbsp; Last night was kinda crappy ne way...partly cuz i was forced to think about my feelings for and about people and because technically my dad caught me with a cig tho i didnt smoke it (truthfully)...or he at least smelt it..but it seems he assumed someone was over smoking...and gah i didnt have the balls to talk to him like i wanted to...so i woke up with a guilty conscience...but w.e</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>O man and yesterday at emt class i became the donut girll...amongst the munchkin men haha cuz all the silly firemen that sit behind me and meag made us finish theyre donut holes that were slowly gettin staler lol so then i got a case of the giggles later and said they forced me to eat em and our instructor couldnt even ask me questions due to the fact that&nbsp;i was laughin so hard and couldnt answer...so i apologized for disruptin class at the end and he just looked at me surprised and hes like ""are you kidding? that was hilarious!"" hahaha o man...so now i took a vow of silence with...myself...and no one has faith...hmmmm lol fun times...me and meag always together never hang out lol</FONT></P>

"event","No now but it's all too Furious NOT to write all about all over everything and believe me I HAVE. Books and scraps of paper, my forearms, my forehead, my poor feet, the scrawls on the bathroom walls! I have WRITTEN IT DOWN! Lordie have I ever. All this singing makes me want to write, all this writing makes me wonder what the hell I am doing here; when I write 'what the hell' I mean it like one word that really only means ""?!"" like ""I don't know what's going on, but REALLY!"" which isn't very serious. <br /><br />I 'ave got to be a little child for a while, before I can grow up again. <br />Likewize, I've got to die again, old man that I am. <br /><br />Here's to my friends! <br />My glorious reason for living! <br />Here's to the Greatest Wealth in all the World! <br /><br />A Fine Fantastic story. First we Pause for the Prose: <br /><br />Mike and I in Hawaii <br />flew an airplane to San Diego <br />Slept in the AeroPort <br />Took a Greyhound bus (after sending Mike's Knives through the mail) <br />Stayed with Grandma and Grandpa in the City of Angels <br />Met with Maesyn and Kim <br />Kim who gave me a Harp <br />Maesyn who gave us her car <br />Which we drove North to San Fransisco <br />Spent the weekend with my cousins <br />Then tripped to the Evolution Fest <br />where we danced to Singing Bear's Music&nbsp;(www.myspace.com/sacredsongbear)<br />and&nbsp;wore angel wings&nbsp;and sang our songs<br />Met Greg and Hannah and Eden there who invited us to their barn<br /><br />where I am now<br /><br />Then up to the Mothership (a great Art House on a Great High Hill near Santa Rosa)<br />And all of this is another story...<br />We sang with the Cello Man who is beautiful<br />And Benji!<br />And the great man Greg on the Mountain (different from the one in the barn)<br />Let us go with a great many books and I loaded up with SandMan Comic books<br />And all of that is another story too<br />But by and by we were at the barn<br />Playing Knights and Ladies of Camelot and Avalon<br />Which is a good game I invite you all to join<br />(you all as in everyone)<br />and then Mike got up and left and I drove to Bear's House (singing bear!)<br />and played with INDIA and MOON (the beautiful and crazy creatures that dwell with him<br />until the Email said it was time to find Maesyn<br /><br />So I picked up this super-hero goddess in Downtown San Fransisco, I was wearing angel wings of course, and we two sang our way to the barn where she met these fine folk I've been with two weeks now.&nbsp; The thing is heavy here, we are EVOLVING and quickly and every waking moment is to further that cause.&nbsp; I had been on a Quest to gather a Priestess which I did.&nbsp; I have glossed over just about everything in this quick retelling but so goes it.&nbsp; Glossy.<br /><br />The Lord and Lady of the Barn happily recieved the Priestess Maesyn and we two jammed in the tower in the evening, the King squeaked ""MAMU!"" and threw his spoon on the floor.&nbsp; The Lady of the Barn cleans him, changes his diaper, and allows him the boobie.&nbsp; He is 17 months plus 9 months.&nbsp; He is Eden.<br /><br />Maesyn wrote a song about him in the morning and we then went on an adventure.&nbsp; Two nights at the Mister Bear's house, we jammed on the porch and ate wonderous food for days.&nbsp; Then picked up Human from the Airport and had no place to stay except for the stranger who rode up on his bike Just at that Moment.&nbsp; He was Mister Fox.&nbsp; We slept at his home that night and played grand songs with his roommate Russel.&nbsp; The next morning set Human off then on a quest to Petaluma for no reason...<br /><br />We played on the street for a brother called Joshua.&nbsp; We met so many people all the dream!&nbsp; Words and Faces Tangle to the Reader I suppose, but speak in tungs and we'll find a common ground.&nbsp; HALLELUIAH!&nbsp; PEOPLE!<br /><br />We had to pee.&nbsp; Ducked into a black doorway off the sidewalk.&nbsp; There was a stage and lights.&nbsp; Maesyn talked the sound guy into letting us a play a song.&nbsp; He allowed it on the condition that we do it quick cause David Wilcox was coming and he had a show that night.&nbsp; David Wilcox came in the middle of Maesyn and My performance of Mike Mcginnis's Shooting Star to an entirely empty theater.&nbsp; Afterwards he came onto stage laughing and played for us some songs.&nbsp; We shared and it was beautiful.&nbsp; His Manager was there, and Maesyn rubbed his head and we sang ""hAzeltwien!&nbsp; Kingdom Come!"" and ""words words words"".&nbsp; They invited us to stay for the show that evening, which we did and it was a fabulous show.&nbsp; Here is the site of David <a href=""http://www.davidwilcox.com"">www.davidwilcox.com</a> .&nbsp; They blessed us with wisdom and music and cookies&nbsp;and we were on our way!<br /><br />Back to the barn in Cotati but the Barn in Cotati could not recieve us just at that moment, which was 11 P Emish, so we called Singing Bear who was going to a 'moving floor party' in the City.&nbsp; We drove to the city.&nbsp; Okay so here is the good part.<br /><br />Mike do you remember Po?&nbsp; Of course you do!<br /><br />Po...I would write a thousand words about her and not come close to what she is so...<br /><br />Let it suffice to say that Po is a Girl who I Love and a dear Sister and a Stunning Reflection.<br />I met her in song in the Dark and that is a good place.<br /><br />Mike and I never found Po together, though we looked.&nbsp; I looked when he was gone too, but could not track her.&nbsp; Then at this party, just seconds before Maesyn told me that she was leaving for LA immediately, I saw Po in the kitchen and she chased me to the Black-light room and we rolled on the floor and sang until I was rather speachless and Maesyn told me she was leaving for LA.&nbsp; I got my things out of her car and stacked them in a pile with Po's.&nbsp; Singing Bear was there and he had a little pile there too, all our stuff in piles.&nbsp; San Fransisco Community was fun and nice and we sang songs under the moon and danced.&nbsp; There was a girl with a feather, I had a fine time dancing with her.&nbsp; I met a Lass Sarah who went to school at I U and told me there had been an earthquake.&nbsp; Woah Mamma!&nbsp; All this at once!<br /><br />Po drove me in a her Green Space Ship to the top of a Hill called Patrick and we slept in the blue light of morning and dreampt and read 'the dark crystal' and listened to old records and in the morning Po got kicked out of her apartment and we climbed a great HIll over looking the whooole city and the wind almost blew us over it.&nbsp; We Lived on the Edge of the world for a while in Love and that was nice.<br /><br />Then she put me on the City Side of the Golden Gate Bridge and I walked it as the sun set and the wind plastered me against the red railing and the phones that read ""THERE IS HOPE.&nbsp; PLEASE MAKE THE CALL."" that are spaced across the bridge.&nbsp; I thought of people who were depressed and sang at the top of my lungs.&nbsp; I sang across the bridge and I sang at the Rest stop on the other side of it.&nbsp; I sang SOUL music until it was time for bed, I slept on a pillow I found in the woods that smelled very clean and looked very white.&nbsp; I slept and had horrific dreams and some very good ones.<br /><br />""all of these are bones"" she said, and I looked and they all were bones but so was EVERYTHING and the whole world leered at me with half-shapen eyes and guts and organs exposed and I woke up GASPING in the drizzle and I went pee and the drizzle stopped and I slept until the sun was up.&nbsp; I woke up to the sound of TAPS being played across the San Fransisco Bay and began my day.<br /><br />That day consisted of SINGING and playing my harp on a mountain.&nbsp; I couldn't find my way through the tunnel outside of San Fran, so I hiked OVER It across the Marin Headlands.&nbsp; That took me to an artist community and a hostel by the Beach some miles into a state park.&nbsp; There was, fortunately, a grand art show happening in the middle of the mountain wilderness.&nbsp; Some friends called Audrey and Billie shared their Bread and Cheese with me, the best bread and cheese.&nbsp; I met Nolan from Crawfordsville, Indiana.&nbsp; I met friends (this was on four twenty) who offered to smoke and let me hold their dog and then we built a Kite and tried to fly it in the roaring wind.&nbsp; It had a paper tail that said I.AM.NOT.AFRAID and a boy called Miles looked at us struggling with our paper kite and said ""None of them Fly"" and it was true, none of the paper ones flew.&nbsp; Not very high at least.<br /><br />My friends dropped me off almost were I had started the day, with the bridge still in sight.&nbsp; I caught a ride after the sun went down over the mountains to a place where the sun hadn't gone down yet and that was nice.&nbsp; Two sunsets!&nbsp; I caught another ride and guess where that one was going?<br /><br />To a barn in Cotati.<br />Where I am now."

Mae and I drove her SHIPPY (the car fish) to San Fransisco after a magic and fantastical night with David Wilcox.  Who is he?  He is a shooting star.  He sang songs and we sang songs too.  We rode a cloud down to San Fransisco City and parked and got out and went to a party where the floor was made of VIBRATION and the walls moved.  Beautiful people everywhere, dancing, making energy with their hands eyes and mouths.  I unlocked a Lindy Keyhole Painting and it came to life and suddenly Po was there!

PO!

She was most awe fully real and we found each other on the floor and my voice went away somewhere for a while and came back the next morning in the afternoon when the wind was still roaring through the houses and hills.  We were on the hill called Patrick and we shared some songs together.  Here is one I had from old...

And Micheal Moon taught it too me after he was dead, only he isn't dead any more he's alive and writing poetry and dancing all over the place.  He's ten steps ahead of us, around every corner and curve.  Still smiling, shining, glory golden headed halo hanging off of his baggy pants.

The councellors were debating.  Should they or shouldn't they?
If they should then the decree was inevitable, it must must must be done.
If they shouldn't then the alternative was unavoidable.
Progress must be made, so hesitation was hurried.

All of the children waited impatiently, each one nursing his own ADHD.
One of them had to pee.
One of them had to go for a walk.
One of them had to shout.
One of them had to sing.
One of them had an itch in his pants.
One of them had a booger in her nose.
One of them had a sniffle.
One of them was hungry.
One of them was so so tired.
One of them was a dog, running through the rafters.

I was the dog. Yes I was the dog.

I was running through the rafters.

The councellors were hardly even real.  They were a figment of the dog's imagination.  The dog had a hyperactive imagination.  It was this way because I named it so.  I was a clever bastard."

a practiced knight
a quiet resolve.

I keep my eyes just open
my body sinks into
my body.

The sun is most welcome in fact, it graces me and blesses me.
it is the perfect distance away.
I will always write beautiful things.
I will always say too much.
We will look back and remember singing together
No one will remember my greatest blunders
Some one will remember my little follies
This will make us laugh quietly and sigh.

Some days I will be melancholy
laying down the distant dreams
in favor of the blessed present
in favor of the blessed number 2008.

Some days I will be violent with my apathy, I'll knock it down and spit on it
and then apologize ""no no, I'm sorry, I Love you, be sweet""

Some days I will sit down in a chair and burn the battery acid of the idea of excersize
until I fall asleep sitting up.

But this will only happen once, maybe twice

I am a simple child.
I am too old to be an adult
I am too young to stop calling myself 'baby'
I am old enough to know about babies.

But not old enough to know what they really look like

That one was for the court."

"event","Shelly, I wanted to write you to let you know.  Everything is getting along fine down here.  We're writing words no one will read, we're drinking tea, sometimes more cups then we need.  We are taking naps on the floor after we've slept all night.  I for one am dreaming that it is the evening.  What a suprise then, isn't it. to wake up in the early noon.  There is still things to do all day long.  Things to fill the day with.

I am waiting for food, but I am not hungry.

Finally, after all these months I feel like writing you.  I've been away a while, I know.  One day I shall leave the land of the Dead forever you know, and even your pleas that I should come home will not reach me, I will not hear, I will be gone.  You can keep my hats and stickers, my clothes.  You can even keep my books, and you can read all of them if you want to.  I was not attached, and I am not attached now.  You can read my books now if you like.

I can tell you all about the dreams.  The rest of the story is pure nonsense, and I can tell you of all that too, but it's useless.  The dreams is where we find the keys to doors we're standing on wondering 'what the hell is this great thing that looks like a doorknob but it's coming out of the floor?'  'No, you idiot!  It is a doorknob, you're just standing on the wall!'  We'll learn eventually, I am sure of it.  The dreams though:

There is a great rusting metal barge floating through the ether of conciousness.  The Great Pie Seas, perhaps.  All night I had been avoiding sex.  It followed me even to here, where Mannequins were leaping from the barge and doing fantastic things in the air around it.  They were playing tennis, volleyball, tying shoes, giving blow jobs...Great Mannequin phallus's, floating out there.  The barge was being fired upon, and cannon-balls like small astroids were blasting through the atmosphere, tearing the Mannequins into colorful bloody chunks and blowing their skin off in all directions.  The blood was like Peter Pan Paint, it was all colors and magical.

And now there is blood on my hands, I don't know how it got there.  Perhaps it's paint.

Anywho, Shelly, I thought you should know.  Or I found the opportunity to tell you.  I don't remember where I got your name, nor do I know how to reach you, so I figure just getting the word out is good enough.  I am so happy Arting that it matters very little, the path of the arrow.  We're shooting them all directions now, as a matter of course, they're fluffy-tipped anyway, made by Cupid's Fletcher himself, the man is a genius.

Well, have a wonderful day Shell, It's a blessing to have connected with you."

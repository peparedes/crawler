YEA OK HA HA HA HILARIOUS REX WE'RE ALL LAUGHING HERE.  and justin g disgustingly flirted with me.. eew and he doesnt even like me. lunch was fun.. we talked about how much of a slut michelle jordan was acting like this weekend when they decided to pull a terrific stunt ( her and sarah stannard) by getting 2 ppl drunk and making out with them i gues... and its funny cuz they are both grounded as fuck... HA HA. 5th period is always gay. spanish SUCKS ASS.. we watched fucken marry poppins in spanish... who the fuck does that? yea well i guess we do. and then i actually.. the entire class tried to ignore nick morin ( or MORON) but it was entirely fucken impossible. as usual. 6th period we had a student council meeting so i got to get out of science which is awesome. me and nikki were drawing pictures (scary ones) of mr ewan at a luau... with a grass skirt and cocunut bra... we had bryan histerical... it was funny.. then we tried to come up with all the ppl in lord of the rings names.. we were partially successful.. all in all that meeting was fun because we didnt listen aand we didnt have to go to science but i did have to sit near keith who hates me for absolutely no reason.. o wait! yes there is! he just doesnt like me because someone ELSE doesnt.. and the reason she doesnt is because someone opened their big fat retarded mouth and sat there and lied through their fucken teeth. so yea anyways.. 7th with mrs. najarian garb... or narge garb or nargey or garb or watever... was fun... me chels... sam.. and bryan all made a poem out of words that were cut from a poem and we made a angry poem talking about the green death and rage...it was great.. then bryan was sitting there playing with my cell phone saying how he wanted it and he kept taking pictures with it of nargey when she wassnt looking, it was funny. so after skool nikki caled me n invited me to go to see lord of the rings with erh and her mom... and they saw it like 6 times and this is my 3rd.. i lvoe that movei. i love BILLY!! i recorded him singing on my cell phone so now im gonan play it back al the time to make me think of my pippin.. omg it was really funny when pippin n gandalf were riding on shadowfax.. i was like yea nikki i bet pippin is like gandalf... is that ur staff??  cuz gandalf is gay and all and then when merry was riding w/ eowyn i was like well atleast merry knows that its acutally her sword... unlike gandalfs stafff!!!teh best part in lord of the rings was wehn merry and pip <3 were on the table completely smashed dancing and sinign about the beer at the green dragon.. i LOVE THAT PART!!!nd as usual in lord of hte rings i cried like a freaking baby.. and so did some guy.. and me n nikki were laughing hystericaly because he was like dabbing his eyes with a tissue.. ha ha it was sooooooooo funny. and we tried taking pictures with our phones but they were too dark.. i did get one of galadriel.... but it sucks... and then this guys phone went off and nikki was like answer it!!!! wat a faggot... i hate that guy... whoever he is.. lol nikki.then we went to farrels where we like todl her mom how fucked up our skool is it was funny.. and all the fucked up ppl in it.. ha ha mostly all of them... and it was funny cuz of her moms butter on her bread tasted funyn 2 her.. it was like old and it looked liek yogurt.. we were mkaing fun of it and she was like gaggin.. and isaw Liz..a lady i know that works there... shes fat...so yea that was my night..i htink the best part was when we picked a name for michelle jordan.. her new name is SHELOB!!

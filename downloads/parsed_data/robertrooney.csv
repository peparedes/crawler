"event","Seems as if the only thing they give you here is beans and jolly ranches? What, do they want you to shit all your problems out instead of solving them through therapy? 

Good thing I'm not paying to be here. Though, I did want to give a tip to Fred last night for buying me a teddy bear from the gift store downstairs.

They let me walk around the halls today, I occasionally stuck my head in to a few rooms and yelled out things randomly. No one payed any attention. Except this one girl, Annabelle. She came out and threw her cornbread at me. All I could muster up was, ""THEY GAVE YOU CORNBREAD, YOU LITTLE WHORE!"" 

Shortly thereafter I was put back in my confined space. Matty came to visit me today. He brought me toe-nail clippers. They were his, and he painted them purple. I wasnt sure about using it, but I was desperate.

Did you know that they only give spongebaths here? No showers? Not like I ever take showers, but it'd be nice to do when you have to be around smelly people all day. This woman named Shaniqua came in and gave me a spongebath. She started washing me with something that didnt smell like Dial soap, so I claimed it to be unacceptable. She threatned to wash me with something else If I didnt 'shut the fuck up'. I didnt want to take the chance that she was going to pull out something gross. You never know what they'll do around here. Sometimes I think they should put the whole effing staff in beds like mine.


The metal clamps are really uncomfortable, they give me hives. I made them give me fluffy pink lepoard print cuffs instead. Fred said they didnt have any. I told him to just go to my house and get them out of my top right drawer. 

He just walked out muttered, ""You're a fucking retard.""

Hopefully tomorrow will be better. I have to go to the bathroom again. Damned Jolly Ranchers. 

<33 Rob."

"event","They put me back in again. Oh, I dont need to tell you where. You know. Or you'd know if you were really my friend.

Wait, I dont have any friends.

Anyway, they put me back in Cedar Tree Mental. I know, I know. I thought I was out for good. Guess what? They caught me playing the harp in the subway station, singing in bad tune to 'Kumbaya'. Hey, if you dont like it, dont listen. Goodness, is it that hard? Take earplugs or something. Maybe next time I do that I should hand them out, that would be good.

So, here I am, chained to my bed...it just occured to me that I cant type if my hands are chained up. Oh yeah, I'm dictating to Taylor what I want to write. This is Taylor typing (HI MOM!). 

I hate this. They didnt even give me apple sauce for dinner. They gave it to me LAST time. I asked for nurse Shelby to care for me again, because she looks a little like Natalie Portman. I got Fred. He smells. 

I have to share a room with this really old guy named Peter, he's fat and I dont know why he's in here. I think I overheard something about him throwing forks out the window at wee hours of the morning. Some lady's daughter got hit in the elbow, so he got thrown in here. 

My story is way more serious, but when I told Peter, he laughed in my face. He need to cut down on the chewing tobacco. I mean, have some respect fart-head.

Ooh! They're going to put in a movie soon. I hope it's 'Sleeping Beauty'. Everytime I watch that with Taylor he starts bawling his eyes out, it's not cool. I cant hear anything. Then he jumps into my lap and pulls on my hair when the prince is trying to rescue the chick. He's such a wanker, but, I cant get enough of him. Any Disney flick will be fine, though. As long as it isnt Bambi. That movie is NOT good for my complexion. 

Oh shoot, Fred is coming in to give me my shot of insulin, I told him I didnt have diabetes and all he said was, ""Yeah, yeah, all I'm hearing is blah blah you're a fucking retard."" 

It was hurtful. I demand another nurse. 

G2G PEEPS!

Is it bad that I'm now upset that I didnt take part in this film? It's fantastic. 

Julie's hair looks so magnificent. I miss you Julesz! Can we please get together and have tea?! I'd really like it if we did."

Like, Whoa. Okay. Today, I went walking along Sunset Blvd and this 8 year old girl recognized me! I was all giddy like a little girl and I absolutley think that I made her beleive that I'm gay. And that's my goal in life. 

Anyway, so, I signed her Barbie backpack and went along my merry way to McDonalds where I met up with Nedward (we've been doing these awesome Sponge Bob Square Pants impressions late at night, or whenever i'm in the mood) and now I'm Robatrick and he's Nedward. Hahahahahlol, after Patrick and Squidward DUMMY.

We had some huge-ass whoppers. Oh wait, those you get at Burger King. That was yesterday, right right. 
Well, I had a quarter pounder with cheese, and Ned said something so hilarious that my chocolate milkshake squirted out of my nose. It was like, so gross. Everyone was staring at me. It even got in my hair! I made Taylor give me a full trim and rinse when we got home. Then he put it into pigtails so that I could sleep without any distractions. I usually end up blowing the hair off of my face 2783475 times everynight. It's SO annoying, man. Geez.

Anyway, I had some Strawberry ice cream before I went to bed. Oh ho, not a good idea. I mean, I just had a shake for lunch. Louie and everyone else is getting all up in my grill telling me how I have to lose weight for the next show, or I wont be able to fit into my new Magenta suit that my friend is sewing up for me. And let me tell you, it's sparkley. But, sadly, I havent been able to find matching shoes. RAID TAYTAY's closet! B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-o. 

Matt really needs to stop shaving and leaving his little hairs all over the sink. When I do it, somehow it's just not sanitary, but when Matt--oh I know why. Nevermind. Speaking of Matty, he was really nice to me this morning. He let me chug milk out of the container! He NEVER lets me do that! But, I did splash it all over Taylor's new designer vintage whatever thing from some store. He really just needs to keep borrowing my clothes to look good. I am the king of fashion. 

I am the King. 

Well, my uncle is Elvis...I'm like, legit."

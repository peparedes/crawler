"event","Life is a funny and perplexing mess of moments huh?  lots of things have happened since i last posted. have i posted since the funeral? well if not...that happened and was hard. i sang at it not once but twice. hard to do.

also i went to colorado and had a funny/scary/creepy encounter with a weirdo and ended up talking to the police about it. yeah ask if you want to know...most of your probably already do...

and then recentley i dunno life has been dull and tiring and well thats about all. i have been kinda grippy and short-tempered with some people and i have no idea why but im sorry if i am short-tempered. i think its a lot of things going through my mind at the same time and they are all managing to tangle themselves into just the right place so that it depresses me to the point of being mean. sorry. sleep might help. ill try that.

oh yeah, why the crap do i leave for college in like 16 days...i mean i could not be more excited but im gonna seriously miss everyone too much. whew this is insane. but yeah. fun stuff i still have to do to get ready?
1. buy a laptop (procrastination takes on a whole new meaning when you have not even bought the computer you will be using for the next 4 years of your life and it takes maybe like 10 days to get...)
2. read required book...well ""suggested"", but we all know what that means in college
3. clean up my room and bathroom so i can come back to a tiddy living situation
4. shop for clothes and dance stuff
5. pack
6. say goodbye....

i dont believe in goodbyes...

so ex that last one. ok well anyways. i got the roomies i wanted thank goodness! we are all super excited and so yey. im in the east tower on the 5th floor and i hear that 9th and up in the east tower is all greek life so it should prove to be interesting...

ok so that sleep thing,
im gonna go try it.

but i dont really know what to write. 
i feel bi-polar when i write on this thing especially after grampa.
i dont want to be all yipee! but i dont want to be all ""im so sad like eeyore"" type thing either. i like eeyore though...

anyways, i have strayed...
so i will just write about what happened to me today.
i got my hair cut and while i was at work my mom went shopping for me and said she would stop by to show me the stuff she bought me. so she comes in and says hi to me and then looks at the girl at the other desk too and says ""where's jen?"" and then looks back at me and im looking at her in disbelief because i know i do not look that different! and she looks at me and is like ""what?"" and then she says ""i didnt even recognize you""...

what a mess mom.
she was with me when i got my hair cut! wow yeah so i though that was funny enough to share. 

i hope that is good enough for those of you who thought i needed a peppy update. :)

"event","So my grandfather passed away last night.

It was hard but i know he is with the Lord. 

I believe that everything happens for a reason... and even though parents did not make it back in time to see him, all who were there by his side in those last few minutes experience God's work.
Two of my best friends and boys i care about so much more than they could know were there with me. I know i keep saying it, but Thank you Ryan and David.  
At about 7:45 we decided to go back to my grandparents house to get some food and just get away from the hospital for a while. but on the way we decided to stop and go into walmart for some things we needed for the overnight stay. Contact solution, yada yada. well we ended up staying longer than anticipated and im so glad we did. i got  phone call saying i needed to get back to the hospital right away because my grandfather had a change for the worse and my parents didnt even think they could make it back in time.  so i got there and went in and there grampa was with tons of loved ones around him, eyes closed and almost gone.  but i got my mom on the phone and gave it to someone because i just couldnt talk...
they put the phone up to his ear and we all experienced God in that room. The readings on the screen jumped from nearly 0 to 15 to 34 to 60's then down again. my mom started saying "" I love you Daddy, we're on our way daddy. Hold on just a few more minutes please"" and the reading jumped to 123 i will never forget. i was in awe of that. even though he layed there with so many people around him holding him and praying and kissing him and saying i love you, he couldnt open his eyes...but he could hear his daughter. he could hear my mother. and i know he can see her now. he was at peace with life. he had told everyone he loved them and at a little after 9 he left his body and became present with the Lord. no one understood, especially not my cousin who shared yesterday's sorrow with her 14th birthday. yet, i told everyone they should be happy because grampa is happy and there is no more pain or suffering. he is up in Glory and finally at peace.  

i love you grampa."

"event","forgot a really funny thing that happened to me. so i was at home last night and i was downstairs all alone. its like 12:45 right....why did i hear what sounded like a chainsaw right outside the window of the room i was in. then i swear i heard something/someone in my house... i thought someone was behind me but yeah that was definitley just my shirt russelling. ugh spell check, wait word check. whatever. anyways. it is funny how easily i can freak myself out though. i mean today when i got home from my first job to get ready for job2 i swear i heard people in my house....and then something in the kitchen fell and i freaked out for like a second then got over it so i could take my long 10 minute nap. yawn.  i think the only reason i was freaked out though about that was because of the fact that year before last i walked into my house while it was getting broken into...not cool. but i kinda went up to the door and heard the alarm and didnt know what was going on so i was like huh what? and i went and opened the door and the realized after a few steps in...woah not a smart idea so i left.(i even locked the door again!) so yeah it was something crazy like the alarm went off at 4:37 and i walked in at 4:48 while the guy was still there. i was a tad bit freaked out i must say... the worst part was walking in  with the cop and him telling me to turn off the alarm and then he kept on walking around the house and i am in the kitchen alone. you just dont do that. you have the gun, stay by me. and yeah him drawing his gun as we walked into my parents room that was fun since i was right behind him. wow but it was scary seeing the window busted open and the drawer all messed up and things everywhere...hm. ok wow well there is a little interesting story from my life.

although i had to endure the day at work all by myself im ok. i didnt really have ton of stuff to do. so yeah. tonight oh my gosh i am so excited to go out tonight and see the bourne supremacy. matt damon really kicks butt in the first one so i dont know how this one could be any better but we shall see huh? 

well, i have decided that the whole issue concerning grampa is too stressful to worry about all the time. i gotta distract myself. its ok. i guess the most annoying part about it all is that i keep hearing ""he's doing worse Jenna...."" and then ""Oh! He's better he is getting better."" i just dont want to get my hopes up to just be let down all over again. i mean i dunno. they put him back in ICU this morning.  the thing that is making me feel so blessed is all of the people God is placing in my path and their encouragement. Almost every adult i have talked to about the situation or knows about it has told me ""well call me first thing if you need anything at all. i dont care if it is 3 in the morning""  earlier that made me feel sad because well i dont know but it just did. but now i just feel so blessed right now. 

done.

 why am i in  this house all alone. i feel so helpless with this all. family keeps calling me and it makes me realize more and more that i am not ok with him dying. he is a christian so i know he is going home, but it still stings. my parents are out of town and all i have here with me are my friends. but i have god and that is enough. i have to keep telling myself that. this is awful...i feel so eh i dont even know how to explain it. i dont want to go to work in the morning and be that same peppy ""im gonna smile so you dont think anything is wrong with me"" girl i am sometimes. its too hard. its true though...the smiles arent all real guys, and every time i say yeah to that same ""are you ok"" question it doesnt necessarily mean i am. but i guess its just my way of dealing. some of you guys know if i am telling the truth or not and some wont but that is fine too. thank you for asking me. it means a lot. and if i still say im ok and you know im not, its ok...i will be ok eventually. its just a lot to take in. hugs and prayers are always welcome.
whew enough depressing pity stories...
God is good all the time, and all the time God is good.

"event","So my grampa is in the hospital.  We went up this morning early to see him because my mom said that she wanted me to come too because she was afraid that if i didnt go this time, there might not be a next time. of course i wanted to go. my dad is so great. he was up there bright and early this morning waiting with my grandmother even though he knew his office was probably going crazy without him there.  he stayed by her side and helped her move grampa around and get him situated.  he stayed there until we got there so she wouldnt be there alone. and then he even stayed another hour and a half after we were there.  his love for my mother was evident in simply that and the kiss he gave her goodbye. my grampa seemed to be giving up i guess because the dr. came in and told him ""mr. green, do you want to die? is that what this is about?""...he basically told him that if he doesnt eat that will be the outcome.  i think the worst part of the day was when one of the young nurses that new my gramma came up to her and was talking to her. she told my gramma that she looked exhausted and asked if she had gotten any rest. she replied with ""a little."" and the nurse said that she should try to get some more but gramma said 
""i know, but i cant... its hard when your mate is dying."" the nurse asked if that was what she was told and gramma said ""no, but i know...you know things like this.""  the sincerity in my gramma's voice choked me up. they were so young when they got married and he will only be 79 in august. she still loves him so much and she shows it in the little things too like calling him ""love"" or simply asking if he needs anything.  we prayed over him twice and i know God will do what He has planned. its all in His hands now.
but grampa agreed to being fed through a tube through his nose. this is good because he cant consume food on his own. he tried this morning and took two bites and threw it up.  i think the dr's words about death got to him. so not only did he begin to agree to some of the wishes of the family like the tube, but he decided to not be so complacent about things and actually was quite assertive at certain periods in our visit... he made us laugh quite a bit when he asked gramma to ""stop nagging me and trying to feed me and all this...i just want to rest""  i guess it was good to have grampa back, even if it meant hearing a bit of complaining and his well-known hard headed nature.  
i had to leave at 2 to get back home for work. let me just tell you i was happy about that...except not. i have to miss church tonight, but i got cheered up a lot when two of my favorite boys in the whole world stopped by to check in on me, say hi, and bring me a ""large"" diet coke. we talked for a bit and i actually made them late for church. oops, sorry. i love my friends and truly do thank God for them all the time. i dont think i could get through half the crap i go through if i didnt have them...even if they do make fun of the 80's-ness of the gym i work in. im sorry that the shirts are hot pink, purple, and turquoise...i cant help it. 

well i would hate to dissapoint and make this a strictly serious entry so here...
i hit myself in the head with the hairdryer this morning while ""trying"" to dry my hair. i say ""trying"" because as apparent, i did not succeed without injury. ouch it still hurts.

"event","i love going places at night with friends. lemme just tell you, there is something about sitting on the sidewalk outside of starbucks while my butt is falling asleep that just makes me smile. haha :) fun times. oh and good times occur especially when you decide to be a good citizen and get out of the car while stopped at a red light on the way home to throw something away instead of litering (you know the whole ""dont mess with texas"" thing) and when you jump back in you manage to step on your own foot...in heels. ouch. i lost some skin. but yeah....
anywho
i saw Black Coffee tonight at the Alley Theatre. Good Job guys! i really enjoyed it and it just made me think how i cannot wait to be doing things like that in my life. i just hope i get the chance. whew that would be a dream come true, to be able to perform and make people laugh, cry, yada yada for a living... good times. its fun to pretend you are someone you arent. but anyways.
hmm what else? 
oh, my grampa is better i think. i think he is getting to come home tomorrow so yey. i stopped at chevron on my way home and bought a pack of gum and went for the kind that reminds me of him. the blue freedent kind. its a new package, but same smell as it was when he used to give it to me as a kid. oh man i love him so much. im praying he gets better and better some more. well thats all for now, i have to go so i can get my rest for some serious dodgeball tomorrow night after church...haha yeah that should be interesting...or shall we say amusing?! whatever...only time will tell

So for all of you failures of movies out there and messed up things that people usually do not like or something like that, i can probably find something good about you. yeah whatever...i've been told i just need to start being less nice, but i cant help it sometimes. Still, I truly did like King Arthur, but yeah it was a tad bit slow at parts and i dunno if it was a bit random to anyone else?... 
Anyways, today was a blah day.
Tired most of it, then a mix of blah blah and more blah as the day progressed. fill in the blahs as you wish. it was just a blah day, and all because i did not get enough rest and yada yada...and yet i am still up writing in this stupid thing as if i really need to. how much of what i even said mattered? like i am really going to say something of importance on this thing where everyone can read it. haha wishful thinking! maybe some day in the future i will. just not now. one- i am way too tired and two- still too tired. 
thats all for now.
time to sleep, thank goodness.

"event","ok so i have been running non-stop for the past week or so. right after chuch camp (which was awesome beyong words!) i went to see spiderman at like 11 at night...haha fun times we will say. uhm haha
anyways, then i went to bed at like 3:30 because i am an idiot and figured whatever its ok even though i have to get up at like what 5:30...
what was i thinking?!
yeah so i got up and then we were off on the road to harlingen, texas. woohoo. well we got there and went to mexico for dinner and shopping. not really shopping though. but yeah, after that i went back to the hotel and i know im a loser and i rode the bike (the one that stays in place so i dont have to) for like 12 or 13 miles or something. woohoo. then i ran. man i missed that while i was at camp because just walking from place to place (while being paranoid of being shot with a water gun) was not sufficeient (and neither is that spelling). ok anyways...
today  i went to south padre and walked up and down the beach with my adorable parents...it was like a family of little people. :)
then we went to some stores, i almost got a henna tattoo but we ran out of time. maybe later. then we came back to the room and i fell asleep. then we went to eaph's party at his awesome house and because my life is so amusing of course there was a kareoke machine there and about 50 people who asked me to sing and i didnt want to disappoint... so i sang. i think they were hapy because the guy who was hired to sing for everyone was awful and i think he was that way without alcohol...geez. and the man made me dance with him! whatever. so i sang and then they made me keep singing later on in the evening...gr. whatever. well the food they made was good except some nasty potato thing that made me ask the question...why did God invent onions? and what is the world made these people think they could put them in potatoes! anyways...
finally we left (when all the adults started to sing).
and now i am back at the room and online because nothing is on tv so i am in the lobby of my hotel staring at a computer screen...thank goodness some interesting people are online to keep me busy.
well that is my life for a day.
oh and guess what? i havent seen any people i know yet...maybe im not that popular after all! ;)

im tired but at least the weather is ok up here and not realllly hot! i love that we have a 3 hour break in the middle of the day. but dinner is at 5...what are we? old people???! this food is weird but some of it is edible-ish. im sick of icecream and sweet stuff. i want some chicken. i want to go home...yeah because the food is better there.... sure whatever, i really miss the takeout. ok anyways people are starting to look at me weirdly because i am saying everything i type out loud. ok time to go now.

"event","So i have been informed that i am in need to an update so here goes...
i leave for church camp tomorrow and im excited. i need a break from working all the time. dont get me wrong, i love it but im just a little tired. well maybe it is because i am insane and stay out with my friends til like 1 or so and get up at 7....yeah could be.
so yeah.
some random thoughts...how do i know so many people. i swear, everywhere i go i know someone. i could go into the stop n go and whoops there is a girl i went to school with, or went to dance with, or sang with in choir. its insane. my life is a never ending web of people. i guess im just social. but i have realized not so much in the morning time though. im quite (can you believe it) and dont have any desire to talk in the morning. i gotta have some time to myself to get prepared i guess for the day. hmm
well, today was an ok day. i had to work and then i went home and got ready for a funeral i had to sing at. it was an honor that James wanted me to sing at his father's funeral. im so glad none of them cried because it would not have been cool and i would have probably fallen apart too...but all in all as far as services go, i was very impressed by Bob Campbell and all that he had to say. i even told my mom that if i were to die before her and Bob was still alive (no offense), i wanted him to speak at my funeral...i know i know morbid. but true. he made the whole experience bearable and actually sort of i guess one could call it ""hopeful""?... yeah hopeful.
then tonight, well that was interesting. Me, Pesei, Christian, Ryan and Jonathan went out to TGIFridays and well our waiter thought we were all kids....why did i have to show that boy my ID to prove to him i was 18...  
well i g2g pack...ill continue later.

"event","ok so i also work at a gym called ladies workout express...kinda like curves. its fun because i get to work out which i would be doing anyway and i just have to stay like 3 hours more than usual and help other women get used to the whole working-out thing...and i get paid! yey. 
ok so anyways, today i was working out at like 430 because no one was in here and these two little (well not really little but nontheless) boys walk in and are like ""is anyone in here?"" and i was like no and they said ""oh ok, my mom said we could try it...i heard it was hard."" haha wow that was funny. and the whole time they are going around with me and asking me what to do and i was like ""i really am working out with 11 year old boys..."" 
whoops i just had to leave the computer because i heard a crash and turned around and one of them was on the floor. yep, he fell off the treadmill. well oops, hope i dont get fired. haha yeah right. 

anyways that whole experience was just hilarious. they really were not liking the whole working out thing on the machines these women use everyday...and they kept saying ""isnt it  time to change stations yet?""
wow i was really laughing out loud.
thought i would share that whole experience.

anyways, in more recent news (gosh, not really...when exactly can one use this phrase?), today was my last day with the adorable 4 and 5 year olds...they are so cute.but i was so tired because i was up so late! til like 1:20 am... anyways. one of the 5 year olds gave me a kiss on the cheek and his father informed me that he had been referring to me at home as ""yellow-hair."" guess i really am very blonde huh? wow. anyways, i was talking to another parent and she informed me that her son has been talking about how ""mrs. jennafer"" is his favorite teacher in spacecamp. he told me that alot too in person.  she said that he said that he has a crush on me...how cute. she said ""he has a little four year old play girlfriend, but when i asked him about her he said 'no, jennafer is my crush'."" she asked him if he knew what that was and he said yeah ...it means you love someone. i was just smiling it was so cute. she said i was his first crush. he still is so adorable too. he is the little one who is allergic to peanuts and had a hat on the first day that had ""NO PEANUTS"" embroidered on it. he also has worn a ""NO PEANUTS"" bracelet and necklace everyday. and all his shirts have that stiched on it too.  how cute, a little scary though...i was so paranoid to feed him. are you aware how many foods have peanuts in them or are distributed through companies that also distribute peanuts as well??? ok 

i have written so much.

now it is fun and these kids show me the innocence that we all once possessed...sorry but its true. even if it is ""deep"" yada yada.

well in more recent news, well i guess not actually, but yeah i went and saw ""the day after tomorrow"" yesterday night and wow can we say intense?! it was insane... yeah end of the world movies usually are but i mean wow.
and then i got home and mom wanted me to watch 28 days later too...i was like, ""another end of the world movie?"" goodness no...that was just freaky i made her turn the channel. 
ok enough of me jabbering. 

woohoo summer...

"event","WOW.
Did that really just happen?
I just graduated and really did not cry at all...it was a happy graduation and besides the fact that everyone was ready to leave Rosa's crazy class behind, it was just very pleasant.  wow. and man my parents were so proud of my ""most outstanding sr. girl award"" from the school board...dad cant wait to take in the award to his offic and ""show-it-off"" as he says. 
tonight was great.
i went out for dessert with my girls and while i was there the strap of my dress broke, which proved to be a bit tricky... yeah its a wonder the dress stayed on but whatever i made do. jackie turned ghetto...it was funny, i didnt think she was capable of calling me ""girl"" or saying the phrase ""i likes them""....hmm.
well, it was a happy night. and our games of ""remember when"" (about how we used to be) and ""what if this happens in college"" (complete with the senario of having to sleep with a professor to get a passing grade) were the icing on the cake.

 oh and we decided on the solution of reporting the professor, if it matters to anyone....
much love to all, especially my amazing class of 2004. we're outta here.

I slept late and then i went to a luncheon that was honoring some high school grads...it was really nice and was at the briar club. hm really nice. but uh, i just got home from jackie's graduation fiesta at which we sang horrible karaoke...lemme tell you the pictures i get developed from this experience will be priceless. then i took ellis and tony home. tony had a huge bag and at first i really did not know how it would get into my car, but i guess we made it fit in my trunk eventually...its sad how much my car needs to be cleaned out. my life is just in disorder right now. i do not want to clean out my car, or my room, or any other part of my house...its good enough as it is (even though i feel so sorry for some of the people who i give rides to...). i just do not have time or energy to give to such a cause...i guess i will just move stuff around and never actually get rid of it (right kate ;) ?) well oh well, i am tired so im going to bed...

Oh goodness though, katie and i went and saw jekyll and hyde...what a hilarious mess. the leading man was amazing though...i am glad i stayed to watch the rest of the show just for him. the other cast members were just awful and yeah it was just an all around mess... 
why was the priest wearing a fuschia suit <- spell check... anyways someone should share with him that he is not elton john, and if the costume people were trying to make some sort of a statement...help them out
ok

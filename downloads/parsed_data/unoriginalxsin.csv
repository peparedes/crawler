of no return - 
no backward glances: 
the games we've played 
till now are at 
an end ... 
Past all thought 
of ""if"" or ""when"" - 
no use resisting: 
abandon thought, 
and let the dream 
descend ... 

What raging fire 
shall flood the soul? 
What rich desire 
unlocks its door? 
What sweet seduction 
lies before 
us ...? 

Past the point

the final threshold - 
what warm, 
unspoken secrets 
will we learn? 
Beyond the point 
of no return ... 

You have brought me 
to that moment 
where words run dry, 
to that moment 
where speech 
disappears 
into silence, 
silence ... 

I have come here, 
hardly knowing 
the reason why ... 
In my mind, 
I've already 
imagined our 
bodies entwining 
defenceless and silent - 
and now I am 
here with you: 
no second thoughts, 


I've decided, 
decided ... 

Past the point 
of no return - 
no going back now: 
our passion-play 
has now, at last, 
begun ... 
Past all thought 
of right or wrong - 
one final question: 
how long should we 
two wait, before 
we're one ...? 

When will the blood 
begin to race 
the sleeping bud 
burst into bloom? 
When will the flames, 
at last, consume 
us ...? 
Past the point 
of no return 
the final threshold - 
the bridge 
is crossed, so stand 
and watch it burn ... 
We've passed the point 
of no return ..."

that the freckles in our eyes
are mirror images
and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned. 

And I have to speculate
that God Himself did make
us into corresponding shapes
like puzzle pieces from the clay. 

And true it may seem like a stretch
but it's thoughts like this that catch
my troubled head when you're away
and when I am missing you to death. 

And when you are out there on the road
for several weeks of shows
and when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home.

""come down now"" they'll say

""come down now"" but we'll stay 

I tried my best to leave
this all on your machine
but the persistent beat
it sounded thin upon the sending. 

and that frankly will not fly

And thousands upon thousands made an ocean

I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat

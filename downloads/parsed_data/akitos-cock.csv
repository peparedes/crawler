"event","I don't even think I know who I am anymore, or why I'm still here.  No one needs me around anyway, they're all having their own crises they are trying to deal with.  I can't even help them out, I couldn't ask anything of them.  I wouldn't deserve one drop of it.  Its just as Akito thought, I really just messed everything up.  This family is going straight down the grimy drain and I'm the one who pulled the stopper.  Me becoming Kami was the worst thing to ever happen.  I thought, I thought maybe at first that there had been a reason I became head.  Nothing has shown any proof of that so far.  And, now, already it'll pass over again, and I won't have this title... I'll be no one again.  But, this time I won't have Akito.  I won't have any one.

Ha... I did the stupidest thing the other day.  Yuki has been coming to the honke alot more than he used to in the past.  I think maybe, I had always silently admired him and felt sorry for him.  I had never done anything to stop Akito from hurting him in the past.  And, yet now, I got a chance to talk to him and he said I shouldn't feel guilty.  He should blame me!  Its all my fault... maybe I could've done something.  We've talked quite a few times since then, and he even looked after me one or two nights that I was horribly sick.  We had kissed a few times even.  But he's changing now, and I don't know whats happening.  Tohru's attempt at suicide really took him for a loop.  He got really violent towards Hatori.  ... I couldn't do anything about that situation either.  

So now, he's dyed his hair black, and his demeanor has changed so much.  I feel like he's become Akito almost, as odd as it sounds, for him to become what he's hated the most.  But I think that's just done everything worse for me.  Watching him, he's almost just like him sometimes, and his looks are uncanny.  And now I went and did something terrible, went and was selfish.  I used him... for my own selfish desires.  I hadn't touched anyone in so long, and he just looked so much like him...  Why?!  How could I do something so stupid!?  I've really fucked up.  I don't think he knows what I had felt at that time...  But I'm sure he's thinking something, as I've been avoiding him... ... me, being selfish again.

Odd... that through all my infidelites when I was with Akito, none have made me feel so regretful.  And now i feel that I couldn't've done anything worse to Yuki.  Everything... everything's my fault.

As regards Izumi...  I've been trying to keep her out of my mind as much as possible.  Which doesn't work when she's the mother of  your children.  I finally worked up some balls and went down to the hospital to see <s>her</s> the twins.  I couldn't believe that I was able to produce something... so beautiful.  Kaguya and Amaterasu are their names.  Izumi wants to see Fuyu...  And as much as I  ... ... love?  love my daughters.  I still hate her.  I don't want to have anything to do with her.  But its a warring in my mind.  I don't know what to decide.  She's trying to make deals with me, or maybe I should call them threats.  I'm afraid she might run off with the girls, and while I'd be better off without her, I'd like to take care of my children... no matter how TERRIFIED I am.  @___@ girls.... it had to be girls.

Or maybe.... .... maybe I should just forget about it all.  They'd be better off without knowing a father like me.  father.... father... what an ugly word to call me.... I dont deserve it.  I'd be a horrible father.  I wouldn't do their lives any good.  She should just take them... Its better if those two learned to hate me anyway.

I just... I don't know what to do with myself anymore.  I should just rot away in this room.  I have nothing left."

Sohma Akiharu
Sohma Kouharu

Born October 12 @ very early in the morning.

We were all so scared and frantic when Tohru went into labor.  But.  They made it.  All of them.  Akito and Koe as well.  They're all very alive, and I can be nothing but thankful.  I don't know what I would've done without them at this point.  I really don't.  Those two, are definately some kind of miracle.  Akito, we really almost lost him.  And as soon as I felt him slump against my chest the two little ones started crying, bawling and screaming.  They knew what was happening,  They knew their father was dying, they could feel it.  And they did it, they brought him back.  He was saved by his own new born children. I owe them everything, and I'm going to be the best uncle or godfather or care taker or whatever!!!  

And.. Tohru did it.... she broke the curse.  They're all free.  Kyou, and Hatori, Yuki, Haru, Shigure... All of them.  I won't have to hide my secret from them anymore.  And yet, I feel as if I've gained something I lost a long time ago...

... I wonder what it is..."

"event","Things are in absolute chaos lately.. I don't even know where to start, but when have I ever?  

Akito and I have reconciled.. rather uneventfully, it just kind of happened one day.  I think I had just forgotten in one of my moments, and was standing right behind him like I always had, ready to do his bidding.  And he looked over at me strangely, and it just took me a while before I even realized I had been avoiding him recently.  Ah yes, that was the night I stepped on that glass...

But lately... everyone has just.. lost it.  Hatori erased Tohru-kun's memories of them being together, and so Tohru was really just... dead... it seemed.  But she found out about it all somehow.  And it ends up he did it while she was in the hospital, after Akito beat her.  I've just been gone so much... been so occupied with school and studying.  I'm really lost in all of this.

And Koe-san, scared us all last night I think...  He called Akito and I over, and he had this murderous look in his eyes as he raised a hand to Akito's neck...  I just didn't know what to do.. I didn't want him to hurt Akito, but it seemed like that's what he was planning, so I took him and ran off to hide him.  I didn't know what else to do... If something happened to him earlier than it was supposed to,  I would've gone crazy too.  I'd be lost in the chaos with them and we may never get back to being ourselves.  But, we have to think about the kids... we have to keep them safe.  It's everyone's responsibility now.  I just don't think they're all taking it seriously.  How is Tohru supposed to keep them healthy with this kind of atmosphere everyday?!  With all due respect... she should go back and live with Shigure-san again.  Is she going to be strong enough by the time the babies are due?

Sometimes I think college is the only thing keeping me enough out of this mess we've created.

And Akito keeps bringing out the last thing I want to think about.  But, he is right.  I do have to think about it.  I can't just have it happen (although we are expecting it) and not have a plan or know what to do.  But I hate it.  I hate thinking about it.  Its coming so soon.  Two months isn't enough.  None of us get our happily ever after.  Its part of the curse too, isn't it?  Akito says I'm free... But I'm not... how can he say that?  I'm not free.  

But I don't know.. I just don't know anything anymore.  Why am I always so lost?"

"event","I really did it.  And its taking its toll on me now... above all else, this had to happen, making things worse.  I wrecked my car... I'm always careful, or so I think, I don't know what happened, and the more I'm asked, I just can't recall anymore.  Its totalled.  I have nothing and its just ruining everything.  I have to leave earlier, come home later.. and exhausted.  Then I still have to study.  I get to bed too late.  Then I have to start the same routine.  I suppose I could get a ride, but that's such a hassle, I dont want to be anyone's burden.  Akito wants me to stay in school.  He wanted me to graduate, he said.  It gives me hope, but I just don't know if I can do it much longer like this.  Its not to late to drop out...  And I could be back in my place at home with Akito.  I'm not sure if I should discuss with him the matter, I might just get out of my classes without him knowing...

I'm so tired... But I just don't want to sleep.  I don't know what's wrong with me half the time... If at all.  My brain is pounding and I just don't take anything, don't rest.  I'm not fond of taking medication anymore.  I think because Akito takes enough for the both of us.  I had been tempted from time to time to take some of his.  I used to every once in a while.  But those weren't made for ""healthy"" people, as if you can call any of us healthy.  Hatori used to look at me strangely, wondering, yet knowing where akito's meds were going to.  He never said anything and I explained it away easy enough.  Akito just wasn't reacting to the doses that day.. or some such lie...  I regress back to wanting to do that again.  Like now...  And I could if I wanted to.  I have access to anything I wanted.  Its hard to resist... when I just feel so... whatever this is...  I just want to go numb, to lay in my bed and not have to feel anything.  

I haven't been with Akito in days... and that just adds to it.  I don't know why I haven't gone to see him.  Its guilt and depression and everything mixed in making me feel uneeded or unworthy.. or.. useless.  I think ""he doesn't need me...""  And sometimes it doesn't hit me how much I love him...  I NEED him...  But then I just take more time wallowing in self-pity.. Its disgusting.  I sicken myself sometimes.  Didn't I say I'd stick by him?  That I'd always be there by his side?  I promised him... He must hate me...  And I wouldn't blame him for one second.  Is this pain worth the relationship?  Things were better before.  Why did I ever give him that ring?  It was seated in false-hope anyway.  It couldn't be anything more than something to channel our bad fortune. But I still love him, and I just need to believe that he loves me.  I want to take it back.. I want to throw it away.  I don't even care if he's with anyone else anymore... Koe-san or Tohru or whoever.  It doesn't matter, because things were better back then, so that's the way it should be right?  I can't let my selfishness get in the way.  He has responsibilties, be it what they may.

But even just when I look in on him, as I pass in the hall... I get these images in my head... it starts a need, a fire within... and it burns, it hurts.  I can't bring myself to say anything to him, instead I just leave him behind, taking my shame and running with it down the hall, into my room, or somewhere that he won't look for me...  And I feel so dirty afterwards, the disgusted feeling returns...  It sticks to my skin, my flesh, my soul and I can't get it clean no matter how hard I scrub, no matter how much my skin starts to chafe.  I'm sick of myself.  I'm sick of my face in the mirror.  So I broke one.  More bad luck.  

I saw dead birds on the lawn today... and for a moment... I wanted to be with them..."

"event","I'm not sure what's happening anymore...  Things are going far from perfect.  I'm not sure if we were thinking they were  going to go in that direction anyway.

I can't do anything but comply, I'm confident that Akito know's what he's doing.  That he will make the best choices for the good of the family.  And I, just can't say anything against it.  Except for lately.. I seem to have been getting away from myself.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I shouldn't have given Akito that ring.  I think its messed with my mind.. And, it wasn't even going to be that important.  Not that it isn't now, its just...  I told Akito I had something for him at the wedding, and he kept asking about it.  I knew he would.  The original and only thing I was going to do was the objection.  Which, everytime I look back at it, the stupider I feel for doing it.  Koe-san says he blames himself for what happened to me because of it, but, he shouldn't feel bad.  I told him I was an adult in charge of my own decisions.  But the ring was just something to distract Akito from.  I didn't realize what a big thing it was going to be.

I'm starting to think its nothing but bad luck.  Its been nothing but trouble since.  We've done nothing but fight.  I can see it in Koe-san's eyes he doesn't like me.  I didn't mean to make him dislike or even hate me... I probably did something I didn't notice.  I know there's something wrong with me.   I have so many faults, so many things to fix.  I don't know where to start.  Akito and I fought the other night... and, things still arent reconcilliated yet.  I don't know what happened.  I decided to be stupid and go drink it off.  Akito found me... but I know I passed out... I can't remember anything, its so frustrating.  I still don't know what happened...

But I just decided I'm going to give akito and koetsu a break from me...  it must be annoying to have someone like me around all the time...really, I mean, I almost drowned in the bathtub today... Oh no, I hear footsteps... I hope its not Akito..."

I don't really have to time nor the compulsion to write in it consistently (note the 2-6 month gaps between posts) but I do so enjoy reading about other people's lives.  Not like I'm a snoop but just to hear what my friends may or may not be up to.

...I guess I answered my question. :)

Life hasn't strayed much from my last big update, except that I've gotten more accomplished in some areas than others.  I'm back on track to get that teaching certificate, but without the Master's degree, which suits me just fine.  Less work, and I still get what I really want.  Plus, I'm still aiming to go to grad school anyway to study composition, so I'll still be able to try for that MM in the future.  No sweat.  Buying a house is not as simple as it seems on the surface.  Of course, it's not very simple, but when you're a single male trying to hold two jobs and teach and perform and maintain a house with roommates that you have to cover for occassionally...it makes the situation rather taxing.  However I am trying to find another job that is more financially lucrative (for the mornings) which is completely possible, which should in turn help to offset the closing costs and other misc. financial burndens a first-time buyer has to worry about.  Other than that, life is good good good. Busy busy busy, but would I have it any other way?  Music is also being written at a semi-tremedous pace, as my bouts of inspiration come fleetingly in between sessions of writing for my students/writing for Tapatio.  Anyway just wanted to say 'allo and that I'm not deceased nor in manacles somewhere.  Ciao for now!

"event","...or so it feels.  So it's been a little over 4 months since my last post, and according to M.C. it was only a cocktease with no real content.  Apologies all around.  Life had either been moving at super-sonic or way below snail's pace and changing between the two too fast for me to catch my breath.  So I'll start with where I left off in February...

First of all, my big anticipation moment: I did not in fact get into USC for the coming Fall school year.  It was going to be one of the eventualities so I wasn't too terribly broken up about it; it especially helped that I had a contingency plan already in motion.  After chatting with the admissions office they basically said this: my grades and teaching qualifications were waaay off the chart and put me in the front of the pack, but what shot me down was the music I submitted.  I had sent three mariachi arrangements of pieces I had done combining choir and mariachi, something I took a lot of pride in because it WORKED, in public no less!  In ANOTHER COUNTRY no lesser!  However, the admissions board was less than impressed, or at the very least less impressed that those I showed the work to initially, and they said that they saw that I knew how to write, now they just wanted to see me write something original.  I always suspected that my choice of submission was going to shoot me in the foot but damn it I was proud of what I did!  No worries though, they highly HIGHLY encouraged me to reapply for Fall of '07 with original comp. work, which I am already in the process of doing.  

The contingency plan I mentioned is this: continue at my current two jobs (Braxton and Salpointe) with increased pay on at least one of them (which means that one of them will be paying for my health insurance. w00t), continuing with Tapatio (great because I can keep running with some potential concert venues I've been trying to get rolling), continuing with online degree/certification (Master's degree #1 in April if all goes well), and adding a couple more projects on the side.

More did you spake? Absolutely!  Down time is wasted time! TIME IS MONEY!  Well, that last one really isn't my style but for the projects I'm starting (or picking up again, depending on how you look at it), I'm going to need a little cushion currency.  

#1: write original music for voice and piano.  Two-fold purpose: hired commission writing for a friend of mine who is now a Master's student in Missouri, and using it for music to be submitted to grad schools for composition.  Hoping to get a good portion of that done before the end of summer so that it can be sent and learned for a recording to be made for me...another thing for me not to worry about.  Timeframe: about 6-7 months.
#2: record a solo album.  Two-fold purpose: to get my name back out in the field that I am a viable musician that can write, sing, play, and master all of my own music in a variety of genres...might as well put that degree I earned to some specific use, don't you think?  Secondly this project, should it prove lucrative financially, will not be simply fun-money.  Timeframe: about 3-9 months.  This will help in the funding of... 
#3: purchase my first home.  I plan on doing a long-term flip: buy the house, fix it up, sell it.  Simple and concise when summarized, but I'm still in the paperwork processing phase (credit checks, loan consolidation, loan approval, etc.) which means that it might take a little while to get into it, but once I do it will be fast fast fast.  So I'll be purchasing a fixer-upper, maybe living in it while I redo it, giving it a serious overhaul, and putting it on the market to sell and use that money to do it all over again...and again....and again.....and perhaps one more time until I have what I will need to build my own permanent residence.  Timeframe: about 6 months to a year for the first house, aiming for around 4 or 5 years overall.

So there you have it, my life in a blog.  Other parts of my life are in motion as always: vacation time at the end of the summer, concerts for Tapatio and iMas, trying to meet new people, etc.  Any requests for greater storytelling and embellishments should be forwarded to my publisher...

Man that would have been cool if that last bit were true.  Just shoot me a line any way you can and I'll get back to you soon! Ciao!

"event","First, a very Happy Thanksgiving to everyone, I hope you got to spend with your families and if not at least with someone.  Because today is the day it is, I'd like to give thanks for some things, some times, and most importantly for some people.  To all my friends and family, to people I've met, and to my very close friends, thank you so much for being in my life.  Lately I feel like I've been doing an awful lot of bitching and moaning, which I don't think is characteristic of me, and I thank you for putting up with me.  

Jay, Sean and Kat: thanks for giving me shelter in LA last weekend, it was sooooo good to see you all again.  Thank you Jay and Kat for reinforcing with me just how strong our bond is, and especially how strong the bond has grown between you and I, Kat.

Amy H: Thank you for, well, everything.  For putting up with my blights of intolerance, for my mooching, and for my ungodly busy schedule.  For all the shows we've waited for (or obsessed about), for the fun/not so fun times at ""work,"" and for really listening to me, thank you.  I value each and every minute we have spent together, be it a good or bad one, and I wouldn't change anything, 'cept maybe some of the grumblings.  :)

Mike, Amy C, and Carla: my UA buddies still residing in Tucson.  It is great to find people that you can spill the insanity you've acquired into so that the remaining sanity can remain intact.  Laugh long, loud, and clear!  Carla, thank you for being the therapist for the therapist.  It isn't easy for me to spill what's in my heart, but it's easy when you're talking to someone who thinks as you do.  Ay-meeee!  Thank you for all you've given me over the years, you've seen me through some pretty rough patches (crisis of faith, crisis of love, Blue Chip nonsense), and I know I can always count on you to be there for me in the future.  Mike, my partner-in-obsession, we have spent much time lately being total jackasses, and it feels grrrrrr-eat!  Ho-kay, thank you my friend.  More to come...

Julie:  Ms. McCollum you have become one of my closest heart-to-heart specialists that a person could ask for...and the funny thing is that neither of asked for it.  We have talked each other through some crappy stuff, and we have always been there to laugh at each others plights, either through a mood-lightening snippet making fun of school or the properly placed sexual innuendo. ;)  We always seem to find a new way to cheer the other up, even if Cherri is gone....Thank you for those last nights of beer and a little TV before we both pass out from daily exhaustion, for the jokes we've spat at each other, and for the little time we get to spend face to face.

Kevin: though since your move we haven't seen each other, you are still my bruthah from anuthah muthah.  You have no idea how much it meant to be able to travel with you, not once but TWICE over summers past, and I'm am eternally grateful to have found someone that is plagued with a serious wanderlust.  I have a sneaky suspicion that our time together ain't over yet, so I'm planning for the future, playah.  We have shared some very intimate times and I love ya man.

Jess: We have seen each other grow, physically, emotionally and mentally such has been the length of our friendship.  We have come to the point of ultimate comfortability...no words need be exchanged, no action save for simply being in the presence of the other, and even the thought process has almost come to the point of anticipating the other's thought.  It seems to matter little how much distance is between us, in time or space, because we always are set on that one linking dynamic.  You have been my rock, my anchor, my guide, and you will always have my love.

Melissa: what an interesting and trying roller coaster we've been on, no?  Conspirators before we were friends, we seemed to have a knack for thinking alike and causing trouble, or at the very least keep a secret to the very end of the plot. :)  Later it got a little complicated, and we tried a different approach: romance.  It was the first true bit of romance in my life, the kind you feel inside your heart when you go to sleep at night, and that is where you will always reside...right beneath my breastbone.  True, perhaps our paths do not lead down the same direction concerning that particular aspect, it was still beautiful, and I treasure every touch, look, sigh, nuzzle, kiss...everything.  I will always remember you, always treasure you, and always love you.

Thank you, everyone.  I think Calvin and Hobbes say it all...

"event","Seriously, truly great.  I had initially intended one last hurrah before the summer ended, aimed especially at those that might be unavailable come Fall semester of school, in town or out.  Unfortunately people's schedules proved more demanding than I would have thought (or indeed than they had initially told me) as would up with just two contestants for this excursion: Katrina, my best bud Jay's girlfriend; and Melissa, a new friend but a fellow lover out of...Nature.  

Nature is capitalized because it is a single entity with an identity all its own.  In order to truly encapsulate its wonder and beauty, especially in a picky environment such as we have here in good ol' AZ, you have to get up and go experience it for yourself.  In our case, the destination was Pima Canyon, a modest hiking trail starting at the southern base of the Catalina Foothills and angling inwards towards a trail convergence and then (for the seriously adventurous or plain old stupid) a 27-mile hike to the grounds at Mt. Lemmon.  Now before you get uber-excited, no, we didn't go all the way to Lemmon.  Just a modest 3-mile hike up to the little dam in the creek.  

May I first say that hiking into a Sonoran-style shrubbery landscape just after or during monsoon season is one of the most breathtaking things one can see.  Everything that lay semi-dormant or half-wilted has sprung up, full of water and greener than one would ever expect.  I wish now that I had brought my camera, but as I do not have a wide-angle lens it might have been hard to get a decent picture with the cloud cover that snuck up on us.  Ok ok, it didn't really sneak up, we watched it build progressively as we marched ever-onward into the heart of the canyon.  By the time we hit the damn, whoop, dam, the grayish-blackish clouds that had been collecting decided to make a run down the canyon walls, and head directly towards us!  Sounds more dramatic that it really was, but was also rather creepy to watch innocent, white clouds take form and begin to lay their wrath up us.  I believe the first comment made was ""the clouds spitteth upon me"" courtesy of Melissa.  Thus it began: a gentle drizzle that came straight down, no wind to speak of, that gradually turned into what I categorize as a pizzle, or piss-drizzling.  We had decided to keep on trekking for a small period of time and were just about to embark on the first few steps of the rest of the trail when a bright flash dazzled our eyes from nearly directly above.  This was followed a split-second later but the crack of charged particles lancing through the air and leaving in their wake ionized gases (a lightning strike for you laymen out there, sheesh).  And the skies, for lack of a better term, opened.  The floodgates were released and the pizzle turned into outright downpour, still perfectly straight, still no wind, so oddly the rain falling was slightly warm or at the very least the same temperature as the air around us, which made it not only bearable but pleasant.

So for the trip back into town we marched proudly through pouring rain, which not only was beautiful but the surrounding flora intensely more enjoyable as well.  It was an entirely new path back to the lot with everything a verdant green, or more accurately, verdant greens.  When we neared trail's end we paused for a bit to enjoy the lull in the rainfall.  When we looked back at the canyon from the entrance the clouds had dropped down over the tops of every ""peak"", washing everything in a sort of mist.  Was seriously one of the greatest things I've ever seen...in my home town no less!  

The day was well-spent; first a fabulous early early butt-early morning breakfast provided by myself and Melissa (me: my cream cheese eggs, sausage, corned beef hash, fresh toast, apple juice, orange juice, Melissa: fresh fruit salad and cranberry white chocolate scones...holy moley), and overall just some really great company from two intelligent, beautiful women.  Could I ask for any more?  Well, don't answer that, as both those women are unavailable...;)"

"event","disconnected.  No, that doesn't seem to be the right word.  It's as if things are just floating by, and I'm not really focusing on them.  No, I'm not high, haven't been for quite some time; as I think about it, it must be something that happens in the summer.  People are away, life is generally slower...I don't know, it just feels like things are moving at anti-lightspeed or something.  So what's a guy to do, right?  One solution: try and reach out to others, reconnect with those that you said you would but after exchanging numbers forgot about them.  I feel bad about that, because when I make the effort to give or get a number, I don't do it out of courtesy, I do it because I genuinely would like to speak to that person again.  I'm not sure when the practice of giving out phone numbers turned into something that people do so frivolously that it doesn't mean anything to them; the result being that when I try to, say, call someone whose number I have obtained, they either do not answer, or don't call back EVER when a message has been left.  If you didn't want to talk, then you shouldn't have given out the number.  Now, I'm not just talking about if you're not interested in maybe ""talking"" to a person in the relationship-sense, though I would indeed include that in the same pool of thought.  On websites, IM profiles, phone messages, email blurbs, and any other type of medium out there people put ""love to meet new people!"", but when someone wants to meet them you find a cold shoulder.  Not many people realize (or perhaps they do, which would make it more malicious) that an ignored greeting is often times worse than a negative greeting...at least with a negative you know they took a few seconds to respond.  Eh, I guess it's just become the new face of human nature to crave contact but shun it when it is brought to your door step.  I wonder what people are afraid of?  What is it about a ""hey there"" or ""hello"" that makes people wary?  For those that know me (and most of you reading this probably do) I go out of my way to be at the very very least cordial to people.  I have been labeled a ""nice guy"" (which is a nice label, I think), which can have some interesting side effects (you're like a brother/don't want to ruin the friendship/you're too good for me)...but that aside, a nice guy I remain, and if I say hi it's not to try and get into your pants, but to talk.  Again those that know me know also that I value intelligence, good speakers, good LISTENERS, good hearts, good values...not just good T/A.  Oddly enough, the previously mentioned qualities are what most women complain that men don't have or value...hmmmmmmm.  

They say curiosity killed the cat but I've still got 7 of my 9 lives left.  Can anyone give me a solid answer here?  Or at the very least, say hi back?"

"event","I believe in God.  I have stated things that have questioned the details of the hierarchy, but make no mistake, and let no one ever EVER question, judge or think that I'm not going upstairs because I believe that everyone is right in their own right.  Let no one think I'm tempting fate by making this proclamation of Faith.  God exists, and he's watching over us all.  Thank you for watching out for my brother.  

Yes, I am still on vacation, and another update will be coming soon.  Please don't ask about my brother, suffice to say he is perfectly all right.  Don't want to be a downer, but it needed to be said."

"event","There are times when I wish I wasn't so calm about things.  I had a nastily short temper when I was younger (some would say I still have it now), and I've learned to basically put a cork in my feelings because a decision clouded by emotion is like throwing loaded dice at a crap table or playing Russian Roulette.  

I am finding it harder and harder to trust people as life moves along.  I suppose that's the way it's supposed to be, but it's a nasty feeling, knowing that most of the people that you encounter in your life are going to (for lack of a better term) screw you, or at the very least disappoint you.  You're always hoping to find those few people that you can lay down your life for, and that you hope would do that same for you.  Now, family is the first choice to find such people, but many times all a person has a close friend, be they just a friend or their companion, gay or straight.  Companionship is something that has never come easy for me, and I don't expect it should.  I'm sure if I were to start griping about how I don't date but wish I did or started complaining about why no one wants to date because they think of me as ""a brother"" or ""too good of a friend to ruin it"", there would be someone out there who would tell me to shut up and deal with it, because everyone has the same problems because I'm still really young, and that in the grand scheme of things it really doesn't make a difference when compared to genocide in Africa or famine eastern Europe or tsunami disaster aftermath in Asia.  I know I'm not clinically depressed and I know that there's nothing wrong with me, but damn it all why can people not just give me a straight answer?  What is it that I have to do or not do to have a woman take notice?

I've mentioned before that I think that livejournal is something to be used for recreational purposes, because I really don't want my person problems and some of the inner details of my life posted for all to see in the internet.  But I do know that the only people that really read this is are those that I know, so I suppose I have no qualms now.  No, I'm not going to get all nuts on anyone and start washing down painkillers with scotch, but it would be nice just to KNOW, you know?  I think I may even be shooting myself in the foot by voicing these concerns, as most people (women for me) just don't want to hear about it, that it somehow makes the person weaker for demonstrating he's as unstable as he proclaims not to be, but at this point I just don't care anymore.  

I'll be going on vacation soon, first on a road trip with Kev to help him move to Florida, then New York for some more time with friends and checking out grad schools, then off to the British Isles for a couple of weeks to clear my head.  Last summer the real vacation time I had in Italy helped me to figure out what it was I wanted to do with my life, but I have no such questions to answer on this go-around.  This time, it's really just a time for me to see some more of the world before the bigger responsibilities of a full-time job kick in, and then later the even bigger responsibility of going back to school for my master's degree.  And...despite all of what has been said, I still do welcome the thoughts and comments of everyone in my life.  I will always be an ear to speak to, a shoulder to cry on, and a comforting presence when needed, because that is my role in life.  Take care all,

Beto"

"event","you know, after writing in my own journal for so long, I think I tuned out the fact that I have an online version as well...thanks for the reminder boys and girls.  On with the show!

A couple of big events to discuss.  First, my recital.  Done.  Finito.  Ya se acabo.  And what a show it was!  Not tooting own horn here (though there were in fact horns tooted) but it was a bigger success than I ever had imagined it to be.  I knew tat I would pull through it no matter what, but I was astonished (and elated) that it came out as good as it did.  I was completely in voice, not sick, nor nervous, everything with the prep went well, everyone did their part as they should have...in short, a total success!  A HUGE thank you to everyone that supported me, whether it was in the form of words of encouragement or coming to the recital itself...you really have no idea how much it means until you're standing up there preparing to bare your soul to everyone that you know and love.  And to put a cap on the whole affair, the first words out of my voice teacher's mouth were: ""Flying colors man, flying colors.""  When the man giving you the grade tells you that, it pretty much settles any thought process you might have had concerning your academic progress throughout your time as a transfer music major.  Everything else from this point is pretty much just icing on the cake: choir performances, my last stint in the UA opera (The Medium by Gian Carlo Menotti, April 6-10, Stevie Eller Dance Hall...more later!), and one more class that counts towards my major...lovely music history.  

Next event: another of my good friends has finally hit the big number that college kids look forward to...21!  So naturally, we as his good friends took him out to drink at a place that those of us over the age of legality frequent, The Red Garter.  To cut the boring details...it was good pool, good drinks, good company, and just a perfect night to get our little group of friends together to chill, 'specially when paired with late-night IHOP.  And dear Michael took his alcohol like a champ.  Of course, because he is our friend we decided to be nice and bought him drinks that were easy to go down, but varied them so he had a broad selection of tastes going on throughout the night.  He kept it all down, and was still able to have a decent conversation with the rest of us.  We're proud of you Mike!

So that about does it for now...I've put a Post-It on my comp reminding me to update every so often....let's see if it works"

Some examples of the Dragon Form are Athena<br>(Greek), St. Peter (Christian), and Surya<br>(Indian).
The Dragon is associated with the concept of<br>intelligence, the number 5, and the element of<br>wood.
His sign is the crescent moon.

As a member of Form 5, you are an intelligent and<br>wise individual.  You weigh options by looking<br>at how logical they are and you know that while<br>there may not always be a right or wrong<br>choice, there is always a logical one.  People<br>may say you are too indecisive, but it's only<br>because you want to do what's right.  Dragons<br>are the best friends to have because they're<br>willing to learn.

<h2>Your Sex Sign is Virgo!</h2>	
Treat you with respect and you'll give your lover incredible sex - night after night.<br>
While you're a bit old fashioned, you're a sexual expert.<br>
If someone is serious about wanting you for keeps, you won't let him or her down...<br>
(but you will go down!)<br>
<br>
Virgo, you are strikingly attractive - with the best legs and firmest ass of the Zodiac!<br>
<br>
More than anything, you must be treated with respect - no one night stands, no quickies in the back of a car.<br>
You consider lovemaking an event, and you will spend hours creating the perfect scene for love:<br>
Perfumed sheets, wine, candlelight, lingerie....<br>
<br>
No one can beat you for sexual know-how. You are a technical expert. <br>
You know all the places your lover wants to be touched...<br>
and you can arouse anyone with your tongue and hands.<br>

"event","Yep, I'm back in Tucson now.  Joy.  Actually I'm quite glad to be home; Italy was fantastic, but after a while it's nice to hear someone address you in English.  On the plus side, I got some practice in on the Italian I learned during the year, and I got to spend time with my family, my mariachi, and a couple of my really great friends sharing ALL of the new experiences that I had.  Most of you know that this was my first trip to Europe, let alone Italy.  And I have to say, that I really hadn't realized that I was going to end up spending almost an entire month over there.  (On a side note, what they say is true; the Mediterranean sun really IS different from anywhere else in the world...)  Even though I stuck mainly to Italy, I was able to see a fair amount of it: Milan, Lecco, Como, the Alta Pusteria region near Austria, Padova, Venice, Bologna, Florence, Siena, Rome, Lucca, Orvieto, and Pisa.  Oh yeah, and I accidentally hopped the wrong train to the Pisa Airport and ended up in Livorno, so I guess I sort of saw that little seaport town too.  

Aside from saying that nearly everything was fantastic, there really isn't much more to say.  I don't ike to be the kind of person that recaps every cool little event that happened, because you're just not going to understand unless you were there.  If you've got questions, or want to go out to eat or to bar and want a story over food or drink, I'm more than happy to oblige.  Damn...I just sort of asked everyone out on a date.  Weird.  OK, so how about just pals hanging out?  Yeah, that sounds better.  In any case, looks as though I'm not going to move into that fantastic house after this apartment...complications have spoiled that one, so I'm currently looking for a new home...and I've got 11 days to do it.  If you know of any place (preferably a house) that is a 2 bed, X bath, and if for $750 or less, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know.  Because of these complications my brother and I are nearing that desperation stage.  Hope to see all of you soon, as it's been so long!

"event","Yep, if you hadn't guessed from the greeting, it means I'm no longer in Italy.  My near 4-week jaunt around that beautiful, absolutely fabulous country has come to an end.  So where am I?  ...LONDON!  But don't get all twittered, it was just for the night awaiting a flight layover at Heathrow.   I actually don't have a terribly long time to write, so I'd just thought I'd leave a message for people letting y'all know I'd be home by around 6:30p, by which I'm probably going to be going straight to work (perform) at the NEW Las Cazuelitas.  I'll fill in the details later, but the owner of our current steady has purchased a new place up on Grant and I-10, and we'll be stationed at the new headquarters from now on.   It's a bigger performance space, but there's carpet so there is a propensity for sound muffling, but no sweat, we've performed in harsher conditions.

Anyway, I'll be putting up new journal entries (http://www.livejournal.com/users/bertman0581) which are going to be more or less the past few big emails describing the trip, but with details added that there just wasn't time to type (internet access is at a premium here).   Suffice to say that I'll be providing a full update on my past week visiting friends and putzing around Italy on my own (which was VERY liberating; amazing the life decisions you can make when you're head is abosultely clear and you can actually think about things). The main thing that I've finally realized is this: I'm no longer going to be aiming for medical school. Music has become such a huge part of my life that I've realized that it is indeed what I want to DO for the rest of it, which included graduate school for either voice or composition, and maybe some more for Ethnomusicology or Conducting.   Either way, I'm putting away all my MCAT study guides, probably going to sell my huge textbooks (if anyone needs or knows anyone that needs an Intro Biology, Intro Chemistry, or Organic Chemistry textbook, let me know! I'll sell cheaper than what the bookstore wants), and see what happens when I throw myself COMPLETELY into music, something I've not quite let myself do yet.   Creepy....

All right, time's about up here, so I'll bid you all a good morning, and I'll se you all soon!

Much Love and Cheers,

"event","Actually, it's about 2pm Rome time, but whatever. Hey everyone! This is pt. 3 for those I've sent to before, and pt. 1 for others...sorry about that.  Anyway, for those that aren't aware, I've ended my stint with Mariachi Tapatio and the Sons of Orpheus choir here in Italy, and have (since Wed) been traipsing around Italy with my good buddy Kevin, taking the fast train up to Milan at first, spending the rest of Wed and all of Thursday there, then going to Lucca yesterday and spending the night there in a very nice hostel, then leaving early this morning to head back to Rome to pick up one of Kevin's friends doing his dig with him in Orvietto (where I will be joining him for a good remainder of my trip).

Whew! So, on to some brief descriptions. Milan was fantastic! After meeting a friend from school and a UA grad that I didn't expect to see, Kev and I decided to spend an extra day in Milan sightseeing.  We wandered a lot of that city, seeing the Duomo, which, to Kevin's consternation, was COMPLETELY obscured on the facade side with scaffolding...another of Italy's wonderful attempts at restorative work during the tourist season.  However, this particular church was quite possibly the coolest looking church I have yet encourntered in Italy (yes, including St. Peter's at the VATICAN, which I'll fill in on when I have more time to write stuff,) with sculptures adorning pretty much every aspect of the curch.  Plus, there was a very famous sculpture of St. Bartholemew, who, if you don't know, was flayed to death, and was portrayed in this sculpture wearing his flayed skin and a cloak.  Pretty greusome, but really awesome deatialing on the muscle structure........

Anyway, we saw some museums, the collosal Galleria, and some really cool parks...one of which had a club right in the middle!  Yesterday we spent wandering the streets of little Lucca, which is the home of Giacomo Pucini for you opera buffs.  The city is actually quite nice, very quite, and great food (like almost everywhere else.) Today's trip to Rome is solely for the purpose of checking email, getting some great pizza (thanks, Jay), and getting Kev's friend before heading up to Orvietto.  I'm doing well, and I'm having a great time riding trains all over the place, something I've never done before.  I should be home sometime during the day next Saturday, at which I'll be finishing packing up my apartment to move into the new house my bro and I are renting, which again you are ALL invited to when we have the housewarming BBQ (date and time to be anounced!) 

Ciao for now!

"event","Ciao ragazzi! How's everyone doing? I'm...well, suffice to say that I'm having the time of my life!  I'm sending this baby from Padova, where we just arrived about an hour ago.  I don't have much time to sit and type, so I'll be brief.  I've thus far visited Milan, Lecco, and many towns surrounding the town of Stesso in the Alta Pustieria region of Italy...sort of a smaller version of Austria but with a total ski resort feel. Anyway, in this particular town, we were treated like GODS.   As the only group representing the United States, and a group also happening to represent Mexico as well, our distinctive uniforms and music attracted an incredible amount of attention, to the point were a group of giggling Ukrainian girls proclaimed us to be the ""most exotic people they had ever seen.""   I've never once been labeled exotic, but there we are.  Our performances have been met with standing ovations, almost fauning enthusiasm, and a thirst for us to just keep on crankin'.  

Anyway, we're heading out to see what the town of Padova has to offer on a Sunday evening, so I'll cut this short for now.  Kev, a change was made in my travel plans, so I'm probably going to take the train to Milan from Rome, but I'll keep you posted.   

Talk to y'all soon!

"event","-->I stand corrected, Sean...it was the revolver.  In fact, I think that's what made it so friggin' scary.
-->Yes Mel, I did wait nearly three months to tell this, but it's so good that I can still tell it now and it'll still be great!
******************************
So, while Sean's pulling the trigger, the rest of us are cringing in our seats...POP!
Empty chambers.  Whew.
Anyway, we each get a turn at this befuddling task, then we are led into the shooting range.  The guns are all set up, the ammo for the rifle is loaded, and we each take a station.  The rifle wasn't bad, kinda like shooting a beebee gun; just tuck it in your shoulder, aim down the pipe, and gently squeeze the trigger.  We each quickly went through our rounds for the rifle, and moved onto the revolver.  Now we know that .38 rounds are big, but you just don't appreciate them until you watch them being loaded into a gun that (for me anyway) looked as if it could take my head off.  Out of courtesy we each wait for the others to finish with the rifles before anyone starts on the revolvers.  Sean goes first again, and after getting used to the little pop pop popcorn of the rifles, the Howitzer-like BOOM of the .38 kinda surprised us.  Sean leans back and peeks at us from his cubicle with a look like, ""God, what did you do?""  I didn't get that there was movement behind the BOOM, so I proceeded to pull my own trigger.  The recoil almost threw the gun into my face.  So, yeah...we each took turns blowing huge holes in our targets.  (I'm pretty sure this was the gun Jay preferred.)  The we moved onto the Beretta.  Ahhhh, what a lovely gun.  Easy load (10 round clip), easy aim, and a good-sized hole without the incredible kick of the revolver.  This was definitely my favorite of the three, although some of the guys didn't like the inconsistency of the trigger action, but I dug it.  Anywho, we all finished up, got our targets (Jay was the best first-time marksman out of the four of us by far), and got to keep a shell of each of the three types of ammo we used.  All in all, fun times!

Monday
So Mel wants me to bring up the Mexicans and dirty Frenchies hiding in the bushes, does she?  Well I'll oblige her then.  This day called for a hike on the north side of the island...the thing I had most wanted to do on this trip.  I'm not going to spend time on the details of the scenery...you're just going to have live with this: absolutely gorgeous, with the ocean about 100 feet from the base of the hill, and a little airstrip between that towed up plane gliders for rich folks.  The hill was GREEN.  I mean GREEEEEEEN.  I was in ecstasy.  So, on to the Mex/French bush hiding.  At the top of the hill, is a little ramada, presumably for the Boy Scouts.  Here, we find the first incident of a Mexican in the bushes, namely me.  I get this great idea to play ""Columbian Drug Smuggler"" while we rest, so I climb into some tall grass with my bandana, sunglasses and fingerless gloves on...added to the fact that I'm wearing a gray wifebeater makes me look fairly...conspicous.  The guys got a good laugh at me peeking to see if the Migra was coming....
After traipsing (sp?) up the hill trail some more, we come to a point where the trail splits into an old Boy Scout jeep trail, and another branch into a military something (Air Force? NND, do you remember?).  Since we don't want to risk being arrested for trespassing, we take the jeep trail...which gets rougher and rougher as it moves, and eventually comes to a point where it is almost completely obscured.  Patrick and I, being the gung ho hikers on this particular venture, decide that we want to see where this trail heads, as we're confident that we can find our way back.  So we wander....the brush is getting thicker, the trail more ambiguous, and the sun a little hotter overhead.  After going for another half hour after the roughness starts, we hit a little spot where the trail disappears.  So now we get the ""Mex/Frenchie"" bush hiding...actually it's the ""NND In The Bushes"" or maybe ""the NND Mark Their Territory.""  In any case, we all pose in this little spot where the brush is particularly thick, and we can all find a spot to, um, blend in.  As the thinnest ones in the group, Kia and I won the ""most to look like a stick"" award, while the 2.5 white guys hiding were a little more obvious, but the pictures were cool.

"event","After writing in my little journal at home, I really just don't have the compulsion to write on this thing.  But I figure it's about time to let everyone on this planet have access to my innermost thoughts and dire feelings.  :)

Pt. 1
So first things first, a long overdue update on my fabulous Spring Break in Oahu, Hawai'i.  To catch y'all up on the crew I went with, these were my buds from LA, A.K.A. The Ninjas Next Door (heretofor referred to as the NND...ask if you're curious): Jason, Kia, Patrick, and Sean (see LiveJournal member Kelnin for other details!), and well as Kia's girlfriend.  This happens to be Kia's home island, so he would serve as our tour guide/vacation planner for the next 6 days...an invaluable resource most of the time, but sometimes a rather itchy guy to be around, but hey! WE'RE IN FRIGGIN' HAWAI'I! YEAH MUTHA F#$%@!

So we flew into Honolulu Int'l Airport on a Sunday afternoon.  WEather was lovely: slightly overcast with a wonderful smelling ocean breeze blowing through the terminal, mingled with the scents of burned rubber from runway wheels and airplane fuel...I tell ya, nothing like it!  Anyway, we got our bags, met Kia's folks who lent us a Ford Aerostar to use for the week (christened the NNDmobile), loaded up, and cruised into Waikiki to check into our hotel.  After hitting the beach (and the water) first thing, Kia lets us know that the afternoon was basically ours to spend as we pleased, as he and his girl were spending the evening with his folks, so the four of guys meandered the streets of Waikiki.  Now maybe it's just my opinion, but I think that pretty much everywhere in the U.S. is mainly dead on a Sunday night.  So after eating at this little Chinese dive (not bad though), we were each handed a flyer that advertised the Waikiki Gun Club.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..................

After much deliberation and heavy argumentation (7.3 seconds), we decided it would be in our best interests if we, the 4 members of the NND who did not have extensive experience with firearms (Kia's in the Army), to hit up the gun club and...check out the sights.  We each settled on the same package that would allow us to fire:
- .22 caliber rifle
- .38 caliber revolver (ever seen Dirty Harry?)
- 9 mm Beretta semi-automatic handgun 
So, we go into the preliminary booth, get our safety glasses and earmuffs, and the gun tech comes in and explains the rules.  Basically ended up being just the common sense rules of gun handling....don't point it at another person, don't point it at metal, don't point it at the wall....basicaly don't point it at anything but the target. Then came the part that sent us for a trip.  He handed Sean an unloaded Beretta and proceeded to tell him to point the gun at the dude's eye.  We thought he was kidding, or maybe testing us to see if we were listening to the rules, but no, he was serious.  ""Point the gun,"" he says.  We say, ""are you serious?"" He says, ""yeah...you'd be surprised at the number of Japanese people that freak out when handling guns...so we have to do it for everyone.  This is to test if your aim is correct."" So after he says this we feel a little better, and Sean points the gun at the dude.  Then this is the part where we all basically shat our shorts: ""OK, you're aim is pretty good.  Pull the trigger.""  We could believe it...we all knew the gun wasn't loaded, but the instinct was --> ARE YOU F@#$ING CRAZY!?!?  So Sean pulls the trigger...

In a few years, I may just find something to identify with...funny thing is, everyone at this point is calling what I'm going through a ""crisis of Faith,"" but I don't see it as a crisis at all.  Just a period of thought, reflection, and possible enlightenment.  Not to the Buddha extent or anything, just becoming educated on all my options.  I still stand by my point that I don't believe that a religion is based completely on the notion of believing or not believing that a man is the son of God, and that alone determines where you go after this life is done.  Sure, you have to lead a good life and contribute to the development and caring of your fellow men and women, but i flat out refuse to believe that if you can lead such a great life and NOT believe that Christ is the son of God you can't go upstairs.  There is a passage in the Bible ( Corinthians I think) where it has some kind of clause for people that do not believe this one fact...I'll have to look it up and put it on here.  Anyway, anyone else have thoughts on this?  I'm open to criticism, both good and bad!"

Color Personality Test Report
========================
For: Alberto
Gender: male
Test Mode: -two_run-
Report Date: Monday, March 29, 2004 8:36:09 PM

Choosed Color Sequence:
1. Dark Blue 2. Orange-Red 3. Blue-Green 4. Black 5. Brown 6. Gray 7. Bright Yellow 8. Violet 
1. Orange-Red 2. Dark Blue 3. Black 4. Blue-Green 5. Brown 6. Gray 7. Bright Yellow 8. Violet 

-------------------------------------
Personality Report:

1. DESIRED OBJECTIVES OR BEHAVIOR DICTATED BY DESIRED OBJECTIVES:
Strives for a life rich in activity and experience, and for a close bond offering sexual and emotional fulfillment.


2. THE EXISTING SITUATION OR BEHAVIOR APPROPRIATE TO THE EXISTING SITUATION:
Not only considers his demands minimal, but also regards them as imperative. Sticks to them stubbornly and will concede nothing.


3. CHARACTERISTICS UNDER RESTRAINT OR BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE TO THE EXISTING SITUATION:
Willing to become emotionally involved and able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity, but tries to avoid conflict.


4. REJECTED OR SUPPRESSED CHARACTERISTICS OR ANXIETY-LADEN CHARACTERISTICS:
Disappointment had led to a suspicious, restrained withdrawal from others and into himself. Suppresses his innate enthusiasm and imaginative nature, for fear that he might be carried away by it only to find himself pursuing some will-o`-the-wisp. Feels he has been misled and abused and has withdrawn to hold himself cautiously aloof from others. Keeps a careful and critical watch to see whether motives towards him are sincere -- a watchfulness which easily develops into suspicion and distrust. ""Once bitten, twice shy""; emotional disappointment leading to watchful mistrust of motive.


5. THE ACTUAL PROBLEM OR BEHAVIOR RESULTING FROM STRESS:

#1:
Wants to act freely and uninhibited, but is restrained by his need to have things on a rational, consistent and clearly-defined basis.

#2:
Needs to protect himself against his tendency to be too trusting, as he finds it is liable to be misunderstood or exploited by others. Is therefore seeking a relationship providing peaceful and understanding intimacy, and in which each knows exactly where the other stands.

Comforter of the weak and forgiver<br>of the wrong, chances are you are taken<br>advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often.<br>But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in<br>everyone and so this mistreatment does not make<br>you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will<br>try to help misguided souls find themselves and<br>peace. However not all Angelics allow<br>themselves to be gotten the better of - the<br>Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting<br>for the sake of Justice and protection of those<br>less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever<br>change - the world needs more people like you.

"event","wow......I mean, WOW. Even though it's more than a week past, I have to comment on it.  Valentine's Day was the day I dreaded most.  I'd play Dr. Ruth so many times throughout the course of the year, and I'd never get anyone for myself....so I'd watch that one day slowly creep up; past New Year's, Martin' Luther King Day (hey, maybe not as cool as New Year's, but he was a great guy!), and then el Dia de San Valentin.  I'd sit and watch all the people in my life that I'd helped through relationship problems or given advice to or even just introduced to one another and just shake my head.  I figured that there was just someone on the planet that had to shoulder the responsibility of matchmaker, right?  And even if there were other reasons to be happy on St. Valentine's (Arizona's birthday!), I always distanced myself from everyone....just couldn't take it.  I've been spurned so many times (yes, even at the ripe young age of 22) that I just started to seriously hate this day.

Now we find: Valentine's Day, 2004.  El Mariachi Tapatio is having a Noche de San Valentin fundraiser where some of the best mariachis around perform, you get great food, and a great Tejano band plays afterwards for a dance till ya drop.  Great times....yeah, great times.  Felt good for once because I'd spent so much time on the planning end (though not nearly as much as Louie...thanks for your hard work little bro!) that I really didn't even mind that I didn't have a ""Valentine.""  We performed, we cheered, we ate, and then we changed into civilian clothing for the dance following the concert.

Now if I don't say so myself, I looked fairly snazzy in my navy blue fitted suit with fire-engine red dress shirt underneath.  As I walked out of the back dressing room I am, to put it plainly, ambushed by a young lady that proceeds to tell me that her really good friend doesn't have anyone to dance with, and was wondering if I would like to dance with her?  So, being the polite gentleman that I am (  :)   ) I said sure thing, where is she?  The girl that she pointed out...well, let's just say I didn't expect it.  

Name: Felisa.  Age: 18.  Physical Description: Salma Hayek + Penelope Cruz at 18.  

So that's all you get for now.....this feels promising.....cause I've never felt it or experienced it before....more to come, I swear......"

<P><FONT size=2>... its true... if certin things didnt happen for a reason i wouldnt be the person i am today... and right now im happy with the way i am... although i do have my up and down days i am <STRONG>happy</STRONG> and i love that fact that at this moment i can actually say that... this past two months have been rough ones but i made it threw them AND with a smile on the whole time lol... i have the <STRONG>best</STRONG> friends and family here by my sides to help me with everything... and i dont want people to think i was so unhappy because of the ken situation because that was <STRONG>not</STRONG> the reason... it was a small fraction of it so i dont want 'anonymous' people starting gay shit over things that they <STRONG>dont </STRONG>even know about me!...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>...well spring brake is going GREAT... my cousins are down from jersey and we have been to the beach every freakin day! im darker than alicia... kinda scary lol last night we had the anual cousin slumber party at my house... and me and my cousins nicole were watching cabin fevor and than session9... and while watching session9 my cousins greg and jon and brother nick come in to tell us a story... while going outside for a smoke jon and greg herd some lowd russtling noises in the woods out in the backyard and the lights were on in my back porch but they couldnt see anything out in the woods... but whatever it was outside in the woods could have seen them... so they came in and told us this story and me and my brother came to the conclusion that it was the <STRONG>HOBO</STRONG> of the neighbor hood... so us being the little chickens we are when it comes to scary stuff put on the search lights in the backyard so we could see the hobo and he couldnt see us... it was the funniest thing i have ever lived threw before in my life... me and nicole think about it now and cant stop laughing!!!...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>...than after all this stuff my cousin greg was scared shitless while telling us the story out on the bunkbed in the living room we had setup and one of my lovely cats ran past him and scared him the death! so he did this confu crap to the poor thing because of him being so scared and i almost pissed myslef i was laughing so hard... than 3seconds later my step dad walked out of his room his hair all to the side and up and everything telling us 'people are trying to sleep'... we all died of laughing right there because he looked like the damn hobo... lol i love me and cousins time it is always the funniest!!! well im gonna go i love you all CIAO my loves::</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT size=1>all day yesterday alicia would call me every once in a while in one of her classes to see how i was holding up... during the day i was fine... but than i watched thirteen (great movie) i had like a melt down on how i wish i could be happy again... so i called alicia and we talked and all i kept thinking about is if ken even missed me at all... i just want to scream and let all this pain out of me because it brings me down so much!...</FONT></P>

*stand*
Walk in a corner shop
See a shoplifting cop
See the old lady with a gun
See the hero try 2 run
Nothing's what it seems, I mean
It's not all dirty, but it's not all clean
There's children paying bills
There's monks buying thrills
There's pride for sale in magazines
There's pills for rent 2 make u clean
Marvin Gaye, there's no brother, brother
Woody Guthrie's land can't feed Mother
*CHORUS*
Mothers weep, children sleep
So much violence ends in silence
It's a shame there's no one 2 blame
For all the pain that life brings
If u will just take me It might just complete me
And together we can make a stand
A waitress brings me lunch
We meet but do not touch
On TV, D.C. is selling lies
While in the corner, King's dream dies
Go 2 the counter, pay for me and my friend
A homeless man pulls out a roll, says it's on him
The mayor has no cash
He said he spent it on hookers and hash
*CHORUS*
U will love me, I will love u
*CHORUS*"

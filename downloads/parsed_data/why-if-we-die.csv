"event","Good Gracious! I havent updated since school got out! I was so busy with hanging out, going to church, and taping pokemon that I completely forgot all about it until today. Ok now for a personal update.

1) School STILL sucks, but its even worse because I have no study hall, which makes homework hell. I also cant get my Drivers License until my grades crawl back out of the pit I let them fall into.

2) Same old freinds I guess, were a little MORE like freinds instead of just saying hi in the hallway and talking in class, now we hangout at Pamminis and BW3's, Which is completely cool because I love eating.

3) Religion is much better than it was before. Im finnaly starting to go to Joshes church. Hes a pentacostle, which kind of makes me one too. Last saturday at the Youth meeting I almost got the holy ghost talking for me, not like it didnt move for me or anything considering the fact that I could control my feet or the rest of my body. Poor preachers, Im kind of heavy, but at 6'3"" who cares, im still skinnier than my brother.

4) Im probably going to update here from now on, summers been fun but now its back to work."

"event","Mah school year is almost over dawgs. Fizzie Shizzie my skittleizzies! Um, yeah, sure, whatever. I'm bound to my house today because my big mean dad wants me to stay home and pretend im gone. Its pathetic to me, almost as much as my common whining. we had to ride a whole different bus today which was weird. Vincent had to walk like 3 blocks to get to his house. I had to walk like 1. those dumb bus drivers, well some of them are dumb, like the one i had. oh i almost forgot.... Mooooo!

"event","I had a day today, not too bad, and not to good either. I called my freind Josh today and told his silly sister to tell him to bring the book Apollyon to school so I could read it, unfortunately she told him on the bus, which couldnt have been worse, I mean come on, how can I read about the end of the world if I dont have my book right?

After another day of boring school I went to Ci Ci's with Joey, Justin, Dustin, and Brian Huffmann. That alone tells you im having a bad time but come on, why Huffmann? Oh well, how do I explain the trip other than we ate, we drove home, the end. Period. Um yeah, I didnt have a very fun time, I would have rather gone to Josh's and played some stupid NeverWinter Nights game or something.  He told me he got G4, the stupid game tv show, which made me mad for no reason at all. I guess i cant complain seeing as we only have two more days of school, so woo hoo....

Goodbye on another day of moutardedness...."

"event","Ahhh Im in class, i better get oiff pretty quickly so im only going to say a couple things.  First im nervous about taking my stupid exams, Social Studies is going to stink, im probably not ready and im definitley not ready for the notebook check.

I'm sure Mr. Vessely is a gangster and hes going to kill me for not doing my notebook, He might feed me to the fishes as they say, which probably will be painful.

See everyone later, or type everyone later because i cant literaly see you. I might type a little more later but what is the point considering were all going to die anyway..."

"event","Although there is no end to the madness, i finally got my live journal working, annoying as it is, im finally done. I swear i must have said the F word about a hundred times, I need some sympathy please! Its a pretty crappy day outside today, which bites since i want to go outside and kill some buzzing bugs, which leads me to wonder if the 17 year cicadas only happen in Ohio, some help with this would be nice.  My gay parents went to a stupid cookout where there would be tons of people i dont know. Needless to say i didnt go, and there trying to make me feel bad about it, which is fine with me, they can go suck and egg or something. Blah! Im done ranting for now, Signing out i suppose."

It's Vassar.<br />My draw number is 553 out of 680 (Mariko's is 31), but my advisor is in the Anthropology dept, so I should be able to talk myself into Cultural Anthropology, and I've got the drive to really dig for Religions of Asia. English I can take or leave, and if I don't get into calculus I'll talk to Mr. Feroe. And I'm at Vassar, man. Isn't that awesome? It just feels so great. My roommate and I get along real well, Josh brought me a handle each of vodka and rum, so I've got some good times in the near future. My hair's a fucking afro from the rain, but I'm at Vassar. I have a key and a V-card and my Harvey poster and an awesome makeshift cardboard box hutch for my printer, and tomorrow <strong>I'll still have all those things</strong>. And more.

"event","<font size=""2"">So.<br />I've found a new conundrum to get all worked up about, create wildly improbable schemes over, and generally use up time by forcing frenzied thought.<br />Vassar schedueling. Mmhmm. Specifically, single-variable <strong><em>calculus</em></strong>. The short-version is that in order to <strong>not</strong> have to take Elem. French at 9am EVERY MORNING FOR MY ENTIRE FRESHMAN YEAR, I need to magically be able to take <em>Topics</em> in single-variable calculus, not plain-old single-variable. Of course, Topics is for people with prior experience with calculus. Meaning, people who took AP calc in high school, and didn't do so hot. So, I thought, hey, I'm not doing much this summer except supposed to be working at a job I don't have, so why don't I find an online calc course (because a) if/when I do actually get a job, I'd have to schedule hours around a class at a university and, b) I'd have no/have to be worked out transportation to and from the class. Well, I'd have that same trouble with the job, what with my sucky driving skills, lack of license/car and all. But, whatever. ) to take over the summer, and get this exposure to calculus? <br />Meh. At least the process-part will use up Becca-shmoozing-watching bad television-time, regardless of the end result. Hell, if it actually works I'd have something to do over the summer, so I'm not a complete vegetable by August 27th.<br />In other news, 3 days til graduation, 68 til Vassar. <strong>6</strong>-<strong>8</strong>!

"event","Despite it's disappointments, APs and general lack of anything besides a dress for prom, this week was actually pretty fantastic.<br />NYSSMA Majors was Monday. We got gold. Our 14th gold, but the break of the 5 or 6 year gold with distinction streak. Tocatta did us in. Matt overheard the adjudicators saying just that- -up until Tocatta we had it. King Cotton was <strong>solid</strong>. Fanfare and Allegro was the best we've ever played it, easily. But Tocatta, man. It just wasn't together at all. Ugh. Hopefully we can pull it together some before Virginia, but it probably won't be enough to win. Our competition is only one other band, but they're from California. You don't come to an eastcoast music competition from California if you suck. Even if you're mediocre. That's the weird thing about the festival this year. It's mostly choral. There are no other orchestras, no other jazz bands, just choirs. Uch. Now we'll have to listen to a lot of flat altos, shrill sopranos and nonexistent male voices, instead of mediocre bands or jazz bands. It almost seems hardly worth the bother, except for the day at Bush Gardens. That's what everyone is looking forward to.<br />I stayed home Tuesday. Wasn't feeling fantastic. That meant that I went to AP physics and econ once, and pre-calc and German none at all this week. And I gotta say, it felt nice.<br />Sooo. APs. They actually weren't atrocious, or anything. English was, meh. The multiple choice were killer. There was this one awfully goofy question, something along the lines of 'which of the following words rhymes with the sound the cue-owl mentioned in line 4987675768 might make?' Yeah, goofy. And I didn't do well on the essays. The first was my best- -some hawk poem, actually pretty nice. The second, the passage, was so disappointing. It was some generic, lord-lady-duchess ""let's talk about the roles of men and women as if it's exciting and foreign and taboo."" And it was Wilde, too. But they picked such a crappy passage. You couldn't do anything with it, and I was really looking forward to doing a lot with it. And I mean a lot. Putting words and letters in boxes and feeling like John Nash. It's so cool, but I couldn't do it. Dinky passage. And the final essay was severe crap. The closing sentence was, ""This is still pretty bad, but I'm still going to college.""<br />APUS was pretty good. The multiple choice were much more doable than that of the English, but the DBQ was the most awkward and uncharacteristically phrased question I have ever seen. There was no clear, defined numerical time period, just some indicating words. And it was fluffy. Women and republican motherhood and cult of domesticity and crap. But but but I worked in the establishment of Vassar College in 1861, the same year civil war broke out. It was definitely the best piece of outside information I've used in a DBQ. Ever. And then the two thematics. The first was a choice between comparing the Spanish and British colonies in the Americas (which absolutely no one chose) and discussing how the role of the federal government changed during the Civil War. I did the latter, and had to discuss two of the following: race relations, econoic development and/or westward expansion. I pulled off the first, but drew a complete and total blank on the last two. I made up some junk about westward expansion, then went on a tangent about some funk lyrics. Then I crossed it out, because I actually felt pretty good about my other writing, and thought that a bad essay would score better than a bad essay with funk lyrics. Mrs. Ferris aside, I don't think most of the APUS graders have much of a sense of humor. But the second thematic was solid. The question dealt with rebelling (which they referred to as 'critiquing') against the conformity of 1950s America, by discussing two: youths, civil rights activists and intellectuals. So I talked about rock and roll, chicken and tight pants for youths, then the Beat generation, Ginsberg's obscenity trial and such for intellectuals. I practically used word for word what I wrote in my 'American Artifacts Are Awesome' project. I was definitely riding a wave of luck on the APUS exam.<br />I have nothing figured out for prom. My dress is beautiful, as are my shoes, but they don't match. I don't have a date, I don't have a ticket, I don't have a table. I don't really want to figure any of it out. It's too late to ask anyone, not like I'd actually have the courage to do so. But my dress is so ridiculously pretty. I just want to wear it and look pretty for a little while. Not really infront of all the people from my school, because, frankly, I've stopped trying to look cool/good/likethey'dwanttobefriendswithme infront of them. I'm going to Vassar awfully soon. They aren't. And that's fine. It just sucks going through another month and a half of this. It's draining."

because of the wall(s) of mucas in my nose. I love the smell of
woodsmoke.<br>
Rome was nice. Loud firecrackers in trash cans. Metro that shuts down
at 9PM. A loss of respect for CNN because CNNWorld (the only English
channel we got) ran exactly five stories a day, one of which was always
the terrible weather in Europe. And there was some weird, loud, burst-y
British newscaster. Pretty ruins.Tasty pizza and lasagna (oh, I dropped
the vegetarian thing. Through evaluation I realized that I had only
adopted it because I was tired of eating chicken marinated in salad
dressing. And the SIG food at that time sucked [remember the awful
catering days? One particular dinner sticks out in my mind- -SIG was
trying to do Chinese, and one girl came out as we were going in,
saying, ""I came, I saw, I got ice cream.""]. Now I'm tired of eating
pasta and sauce. Eating animal reopens new doors, more variety, more
possibility that <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I</span> can make
dinner and the rest of my family [parents, mostly] will eat it and not
deem it necessary to supplement it with some enormous amount of meat
that will last the better part of a week. And make me feel special.
Maybe even useful, purposeful. It'd be nice.). And I could walk most
places, supplemented with the Metro. I liked being able to just walk
everywhere, not have to be confined by my lack of driving
experience/license. Makes me wonder that I might actually enjoy living
in a city, as opposed to a small town. I suppose I just figured I would
want to be in a small town for college and such. Now I wonder why. But
I know. Maybe a city is the right place for me for the next portion of
my life. I'd like/I need opportunity. Opportunity that I can grasp
readily. Something beyond food chains and high school. Is a college in
a city more likely to have that than a college in a small town? Or does
the location even matter. Maybe it's just college I'm craving. Maybe
the location is just a red herring.<br>
But I do like being able to walk places. And gelato is ridiculously good.<br>

I saw 'Sweeney Todd' in NYC this weekend. Patty Lipone's voice is, not
what it used to be. The staging was, weird. The characters were the
orchestra. Hence, the vocal performances were compromised. Lipone
'played' the tuba, a whole two notes. It was only for gag purposes. The
story had a few little holes. It got a bit predictable towards the end;
the accordian player (yes, a woman in drag was playing the accordian)
brought out a white coat stained with blood before someone died. Ate

wooden room with bare bookshelves. The class was comfortable. There was
discussion, banter, accusations and proof. It felt like what learning
should be. Notes in the margins and everything. A bunch of ML kids were
in the class, and they were all ridiculously nice. Then I went to an
astronomy/physics class. I liked the professor, and the general feel of

pretty nice, actually. I explained graduating early and spoke a lot
about Mr. Giroux. I also talked about the phenomenal sentence in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Their Eyes Were Watching God</span>, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Matilda</span>,
SIG (briefly, surprisingly), Vassar and my parents, how I hated Mr.

"event","<P>So, Becca went to orchestra camp. Not band camp, orchestra camp. There is a solid difference between the two. Orchestra camp doesn't have enough low brass, and STRINGS DO NOT BREATHE! It's so weird. I haven't&nbsp;been exposed to string players very much.</P>
<P>I've lived the last four weeks in a turquoise cabin with a clarinetist and pianist from Hartford and a cellist from Cleveland. I've discovered that serious violinists and violist get these hickey-looking things on their necks from the impact of their instrument. I've lived entire days in my pajamas with my hair down. I really do talk in my sleep. Frequently.</P>
<P>The first day there my dad and I drove up behind a car with a Swarthmore sticker. The bassonist's sister&nbsp;inside the car is going to be a freshman there, tomorrow. I spoke with her today and she was very nice and excited and gave me her e-mail. Swarthmore increases in appeal every day.</P>
<P>There was this counselor, Nate, who was very tall. His face would not express anything specific. He lived in this old green trailer. Next to this, nestled in the woods, was Gnomenmenschia. A land of gnomes. He plays viola. I'm going to miss Nate.</P>
<P>The percussion counselor's left eye would twitch.</P>
<P>There was a trombonist counselor, Dylan. I was quite attracted to him. He was one of the assistant conductors, and would use cute conductor-analogies. They were adorable. He was adorable. He played at one of the faculty concerts in a low brass trio- -trombone, french horn and tuba. It was absolutely fantastic. It was followed by a tuba solo and a euphonium solo (the latter sounded like a cuddly teddy bear). The performance of those three pieces was one of the two things that I truly got excited (altough that's not the correct word) about at camp, the second of which I will explain later. One day we woodwinds were having a sectional in the chapel. It was pouring, and these ginormous (yeah, ginormous) white spiders came spinning down on their web-threads. One was inches away from Dylan's head (he was leading the rehearsal) until he ran away. Dylan, not the spider. So we tried to rehearse in the practice rooms at the back of the chapel, but the light bulbs didn't work. So Dylan took his shirt off (! It was quite unexpected and not fully necessary but very enjoyable) and wrapped it around other bulbs, to try and put them in the practice rooms so we would have light to practice. It didn't work. He plays frisbee a lot. With his shirt off.</P>
<P>There were two kids from Venezuela, one from Columbia, Israel (she was sooo pretty), France and Turkey. I was kind of with the guy from Turkey, Emil Erten, for a few days, then didn't like him anymore. I do that a lot. It's probably because I don't really like them. I'd just like to. Also, I didn't like the constant hand-holding thing. It got to be habit, not excitement. When things like that become habit they lose their importance, they lose their meaning. I'm not sure if he understood that in the way that I do.</P>
<P>The orchestra conductor, Mr. Peltz, had very condescending facial expressions. I didn't like him. I miss Mr. Giroux. I'm going to give him a big hug the first day of school.</P>
<P>I didn't like many things about the program.</P>
<P>The nurse was a complete doofus. My roommate was complaining of cramps, so he offered to take her temperature. He didn't even have a heating pad. Pff.</P>
<P>One day two counselors went on the PA system and had this fake conversation about how people shouldn't be playing frisbee before the concert, but rather should practice or get dressed. It was completely uncalled for. The gall of those people. So I asked my roommate calmly if she would like to go play frisbee with me. And we did. </P>
<P>The second thing I got truly excited about (by this I mean the way I was when I was chasing the moon through the clouds at SIG last summer) was when writing a petition to have a dance. I racked my brain for the correct wordings and phrases for an entire day. I felt alive.</P>
<P>This entry didn't have a solid beginning, and I don't have the noun for solid ending, so, eat some cake.</P>
<P>It finally feels like tomorrow will be my birthday. I got&nbsp;a purple calculator keychain from SIG.</P>"

Then it got to be one, and we didn't know which way the theatre was (we were on 44th east, but needed to be on west and didn't know which way west was). So we were just walking one way, hoping it was the right one. I asked some nice girl which way 44th west was, and she said the opposite way we had been walking, but that she sometimes gets turned around (she seemed like such an adjective person, I was strongly tempted to give up ""The Producers"" plight and just sit down comfortably and speak with her. But, that did not happen). We chatted a bit while crossing the street, and then she went one way wishing us luck. So we walked a bit more, got quite a bit more anxious. I asked another nice lady which way 44th west was, and she pointed in the direction we were walking. I thanked her, and we chatted a bit more. Then we continued walking and finally found the St. James theatre, and saw the show. It was, very showy. Not really my thing, but, it was something to do. There were also a whole lot of suggestive referrences, to the point where it seemed quite excessive. The two men who were starring didn't have terrifically strong singing voices. By the end, the Broderick-character's voice was very thin, and not quite getting all the way up to his pitches. And the Lane-character did the whole yelling/singing thing, which I don't enjoy at all. On the whole, it was alright, but not really my thing. I definitely enjoyed ""Wicked"" more.</P>
<P>Tuseday we're going to head out to Ohio, and visit Oberlin College. And, maybe something else? Seems like I should. Driving all the way out to Ohio and back, and just visit one school? But I'm not quite sure where. Maybe I'll figure it out.</P>"

"event","<P>So, NYSSMA. 6 hours and 10 minutes ago. My (now) only shot at All-State. It came, and it went. I got a 97. A 97. A 97 does not&nbsp;get a flute into All-State.</P>
<P>I started off the first movement, by flubbing the theme. <EM>The theme!</EM> Bgaar! The piece went on. I missed notes, squashed a few rhythms. That was to be expected. Then, the second movement. Oh, the second movement. That's home. It's what I love to play. The passionate, flowing pieces, where you vary the intensity of <STRONG>each measure</STRONG>. That's what I dig. And the adjudicator cut me off. He cut.me.off. Before I even got to the second page of the movement. Mrrr, he cut me off and asked me to play scales, and I&nbsp;thropped (threw+plopped. Shut up.)&nbsp;my stand down so that I was facing him, and pounded the scales out. Then I couldn't find the feel for the sight-reading piece until the second (of two) line.</P>
<P>I have no one but myself to blame. I didn't practice until, about a month before the festival. I wasn't focused. I haven't been focused. I can't find my focus, or even something to focus on? The only thing I've been remotely focused on is sleep. And sleep hasn't been so rewarding. I sleep, yet I'm always tired, unmotivated. Unmotivated. So, I think I'm going to cut back. I'm tired of wasting my time, even the shortened time before I graduate. I'm going to try and use it. Try to live outside of high school. Try to stop wasting away.&nbsp; Try to live, instead of just move.</P>
<P>Oh, and I played with my dinos in Global today.</P>
<P>-EDIT-</P>
<P>The adjudicator said I had good hand position. Baah, my hand position is terrible. That's one of the things my teacher rides me on. My terrible hand position. Pff.</P>"

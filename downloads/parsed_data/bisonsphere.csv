"event","The Earth is at that place again in relation to the Sun. Twenty one cycles since I came into existence. It's a little weird to think about in that sense. That sense being an astronomical one. In terms of life and experience, its a relatively irrelevant moment when the time comes. It's probably nothing more than an illusion of a moment that marks your birth into this world in some arbitrary way. Somehow, it is also a moment to celebrate. ""I made this far"" I say. Depending on your frame of mine, some would follow that with, ""how much longer to go?"" or simply, ""whoohoo"". We celebrate things to make ourselves feel good. Well wishers wish you well and others think nothing more than they normally would. <br /><br />Many a time, I start writing with a few ideas in my head. As I spew them out, I start to see the main point of what I'm saying and find some way of stating it concisely. I'm afraid I have no great revelation this day. A feeling of confusion. Not knowing what to think. Hmmm...six minutes to go. Oh wait....5 minutes to go. Someone just wrote on my wall. Yes, its a well wisher. It made me smile. I'm sitting in the dark now and the song I'm listening to is called 'Shine'. Considering the things I've been talking about, the name of the artist is even more interesting. 'Afterlife'. 3 minutes. I type slow. I am so immature. Ha. More well wishing from well wishers. A cousin this time. 2 minutes remain. I like this song. One more minute. Hmmm. I sway from one side to another with the song. Tick tock tick tock. The sands of time pass. Hmmm... Midnight. The song is over. Anything different? I feel the same. Two arms. Two legs. Ten fingers. Ten toes. But wait, all of a sudden I feel this surge of maturity. Empowerment. POWER. Yes. I totally feel mature enough to handle alcohol. I feel it calling to me. ""DRINK ME!!! The government demands that you do"". My best friend wished me a minute ago. He felt the surge too. <br /><br /><font size=""2""><font color=""#a82f2f"">(00:01:35) </font></font><font color=""#a82f2f""><b><font size=""3"">DIABLO:</font></b></font><font size=""3""> </font><font size=""2""><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Arial""><font back=""#ffffff""> Happy Birthday mate</font></font></font></font><br /><font size=""2""><font color=""#a82f2f"">(00:01:38) </font></font><font color=""#a82f2f""><b><font size=""3"">DIABLO:</font></b></font><font size=""3""> </font><font size=""2""><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Arial""><font back=""#ffffff""> :-D</font></font></font></font><br /><font color=""#16569e""><font size=""2"">(00:01:50) </font><b><font size=""3"">raunaq86:</font></b></font><font size=""3""> thanks bro :-D</font><br /><font size=""2""><font color=""#a82f2f"">(00:02:56) </font></font><font color=""#a82f2f""><b><font size=""3"">DIABLO:</font></b></font><font size=""3""> </font><font size=""2""><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Arial""><font back=""#ffffff""> you're in the promised land</font></font></font></font><br /><font color=""#16569e""><font size=""2"">(00:03:16) </font><b><font size=""3"">raunaq86:</font></b></font><font size=""3""> LMAO<br /><br /><font size=""2"">Yes, the promised land indeed.

"event","I had a thought. It happens every so often. Everyone has desires. Everyone else decides what other people deserve and what they don't. How are our wants and what we deserve connected, if at all? Our hearts tell us what we want. Sometimes we want certain things more than others. Hearts close to ours judge us. They decide what we deserve, what our hearts should be satisfied with. But that is never the case. We find it so hard to accept that someone is satisfied with much less than he or she deserves. But, how do we measure what a person deserves and compare it to what a person wants. I think I'm repeating myself. I am confused about this. And, its 3:30 am. That would be why. In truth, I have been confused about this for years. I guess what I'm getting at is this. 

Why should we constantly decide what someone else should want when we can't decide what we want to begin with?

"event","Yes, I'm still alive and yes, I'm probably going to be as vague as I was in all of my previous posts. 

A quick recap of what has been happening. Life was really boring for a while. Then it got ridiculously busy and extremely strenuous. I am so glad the Fall of '06 ended. Then things got a little easier and then things go really interesting for a while. I experienced things that I didn't think even existed and I was happy for a while. But just now, my heart is sad, angry and just confused. As I learn about myself (which I think this time in life is all about) I find that my biggest problem is not understanding people and their actions. Maybe I think a little too analytically or logically but when people do things that seem to entail no such thought at all, I am left confused. The one thing that I do know for sure though is that hope is a terrible thing. For a while, it is a psychological muscle that keeps us going. The 'hope' of better things to come. And when those hopes are dashed, you feel miserable in spite of the fact that you really didn't lose anything at all. 

Life has been playing a game with me. I think its ping-pong. Its been seven months since I saw home. About a month ago, I was so home-sick that every night for a week, I dreamed of home. Of places and scenes I miss. Of people and their affection that I miss. I wanted to go home this summer more than anything else. But, I had exercise my sense of responsibility and try to find an internship or maybe a research position for the summer because it would be vital to my future. So, in spite of my lack of enthusiasm, I went to the career fair at tech. And as I talked to people, my enthusiasm grew. When I received a phone call from a company saying they wanted to interview me, it grew even more. All of a sudden, I wanted this job. I was happy with the way things had gone and I was hopeful. Hopeful till the moment I received a letter turning me down. It looked like I was going home and I was disappointed. All the people I've talked to and all the times I had been turned down. I was growing tired of it. I slowly built myself up go home and started making inquiries into ticket costs and things like that. At the same time, I wondered what I would do at home for the entire summer. Last Tuesday, I was going to call a travel agent and book my tickets but then on Monday evening, I was informed that a research position was being created that I would qualify for nicely. I had been turned down for the project initially as it was army funded and I was not a citizen. But a professor has been working on getting money from within the school itself for non-Americans like myself. I will hopefully know where that stands by tomorrow sometime. At this moment while I ramble on, I'm not really sure what to think, what to hope for. I have this deep yearning for home yet I want this job. But if I get the job, its quite likely that I won't see home till at least the winter or maybe even next summer. 

As much as I may have trouble understanding other people, there are times when I cannot understand myself. I had hoped to find happiness in something that truly felt real and close to my heart but today, it would seem that I have lost that battle. I hoped to give all I could and simply put a smile on a face but today, I feel ignored. I hoped to hope for something tomorrow but today, I am afraid to hope at all. All while I have lost nothing."

"event","I think its time I made a return of sorts to this network beyond just signing in, reading and leaving comments every once in a while. Today, I have a tale to tell. 

Beginning with something that is completely unrelated to my story, my car got locked into the yellow parking lot at school on Friday. So...I lost my car. Why I mention this as unrelated it may be to my real tale is that I walked 26 miles the next day.

It was 5 AM when my alarm went off. I didn't know what to expect apart from being tired at the end of the day but I was excited as well. At 5:45, my Uncle, his two colleagues and I set out towards deadwood. It rained and it continued to rain through the dark of the early morning. We reached Deadwood about an hour later and it was still raining. The entire group that was taking part in this 'Veterans Honor March' which was the purpose of the day had gathered and we waited for the buses to take us to Rochford, the starting point of the march. We climbed through the hills, through the rain and ultimately through heavy snow. We were not starting in the snow but a little below the snow line. Rochford trail head was where it was at. 8:12 am was when the starting gun was fired and we forged our way through rain and 31 degree weather. Mile 1, mile 2, mile 3...we kept going. The Mickelson trail was beautiful. Fall colours, open meadows and babbling brooks kept it alive and then when we were around mile 6, a little sleet fell. That was the best part of the next 8 to 9 miles. Snow had accumulated on the ground and as we made our way up to 6200 feet the snow on the ground grew thicker and thicker. 8 miles of slipping, sliding and putting in far more effort than was required tested every one of the 70 odd participants. At mile 13, we started to walk downhill and the horrible headwind we were walking against also died down. But, it wasn't till about mile 16 that we had relief from the snow on the ground which was upto 6 inches deep in places. Mile 17, mile 18, mile 19, mile 20...we kept going...one mile at a time. The cold remained but the pain and fatigue only grew. It was some consolation to walk through the hills with all its colours and little beauties. Sheer endurance and the will to reach the end kept us going. Blocking the pain out took almost as much effort as it did to keep walking because every step counted and every step hurt. Then came the last five miles of hell. The miles when you hope for a mile marker around every corner, the miles where you cannot imagine what could possibly make the pain any better. I myslef did not sit down at any point during the entire journey for fear of what would happen to my legs if I did. As time went by, the miles seemed to get longer and longer. After 24.5 miles we entered the town of Deadwood and had to walk just that little more to get to our finish line. Just 1.7 miles to go...the longest 1.7 miles of my life. Even at a pace of a mile every 15 minutes which extended to about 18 minutes closer to the end for natural reasons, time only inched forward, one second at a time, one step at a time. With one last little hill to climb, we were almost there. We jogged a little up the hill and found that that actually felt a little better seeing how jogging uses an entirely different group of muscles. We were there...the end. 26.2 Miles, 7 hours, 58 minutes, 53 seconds. It was over. I didn't know what to do. I almost felt like crying but I didn't. I sat down in the car and felt the pain slowly ebb its way out of my legs and into the rest of my body. It was over and I couldn't believe it. 

I stepped out of the car and that was when the real pain hit like sledge hammer to the legs. I didn't feel bad about walking like duck with piles but it was a little funny. Painful, but still funny. Our group of five went into Deadwood for dinner and we were getting quite a few funny looks for the way we were all walking. Someone said if there was an old lady around with a walker, she'd probably walk past us and give us an odd look too. But after being in some warmth and eating some, seeing as how we had absolutely been chilled to the bone and hadn't eaten a single meal apart from a couple of bananas and oranges while walking, we felt a little more ready to let go. We were back in Rapid by about 7:30 and after a long hot shower, a chat with the parents, I hit the sack at 9pm. Before I went to bed, I wondered what I would ream of, the scenic beauty I was witness to or the pain and suffering. I honestly don't remember, but I think the first half of the night was pain and the second half was peace. I'm still walking funny and I may be doing so for a while, but that's ok. I think the story behind it was worth it."

"event","So, I decided to pop my head in here again. This journal was supposed to be a medium for me to share my thoughts and communicate with friends while away for the summer. Well, the summer is almost over and I begin my journey away from home to hom on Sunday morning. Which means that the entire purpose of this journal will have to undergo a sort of metamorphosis. In some sense, this journal has taught me something about myself. My sparse postings are probably a sign of my unwillingness to share my thoughts with anyone at all. It has nothing to do with the people who read this journal specifically. But, I feel that it may have something to do with people in general. This is something I have learned about myself only in the past few years. It is possibly because of my past willingness to share with people and then have things back fire in my face. I seem to have been conditioned to be picky with what I say and what I share. My desires, my evils, my virtues. Those are things not to be said. But, they are things that people can only learn from knowing me. I have this sudden urge to hit Ctrl-A and Del just now. Which is exactly what i'm talking about. Maybe this feels artificial to me or maybe i'm not meeting the purpose of this journal at all. My desire to write in general has waned over the last year or so. I think it has something to do with working on too much math. I just feel a little lost here just now. I see no purpose to this entry as I feel many times when I do other things. Where is this going? Where do so many things go. Life seems to abound with mysterious adventures filled with point-lessness. <br /><br />There were so many pointless things I wanted to do while I was at home this time. But with almost every one of those things, I think i found stronger arguements with real points to them tending towards not doing those things. I wanted to call a girl. I sat with phone in one hand and her number in the other. I put both away. That was three months ago. There was no point to calling. But there was a practical point to not calling. What could I gain from it? I either get blown off which would suck, or I couuld have had a nice 3 monthes and then leave with that same sucky feeling. I ignored my thoughts about her and now that the time to leave has arrived, I feel anger because I did nothing! What is all this about. We say we can't understand girls. Have we understood ourselves first? I wanted to play golf. My health prevented that and that too pisses me off, but that was outside the perview of my control. <br /><br />I'm raving like a mad man. No, i'm raving like a mad man who hasn't raved in a while. I apolagize to my friends who read this. Instead of communicating, i'm bitching. What's worse is that I don't even know what i'm bitching about. Anyway, you will probably be spared of any more ravings for then next week or a little longer while I travel. Thus, I conclude by saying, blah blah blah...<br /><br />-Raunaq<br /><em>Master raver and so on...</em>"

"event","I know I don't write much here. Well, thats because I'm lazy and I don't have a life. Since we've cleared all that up, I found something interesting. A theory of LIFE!!! Well, I read it somewhere and thought I might spark some random train of thought in some random mind of some random reader. Here it goes...

Atheist Intelligent Design : In a few years, it will be experimentally proved that Human Intelligence with sufficient knowledge of DNA and Genetic Engineering can create any form of life they wish. It is a simple extension to realize that quite probably is what has happened to us, i.e. we were created by scientists from an advanced extra-terrestrial civilization. This is more and more supported by historical, archeological, religious, Ufologist (UFO and crop circles) and scientific evidence. It goes with and infinite Universe in space and time. No beginning, no end.

It is of course only projected to be proved in the next few years. I'm sure thats what everybody says about every theory, but this seemed like something that would appeal to the geek intellect. 

Viva Las Vegas!!!!

"event","Creative thought, a quality the mathamatically inclined normally lack. A journal like this is a bad place for an engineer to be. Why am I writing this? I have nothing mathematical to do. So, I thought I'd take a peek at what's happening on the other side of my brain. Turns out not much is happening there. I think there was aparty there a while back. But, nobody seems to have cleaned up. What is it that seperates us? Is it an inherent quality or is it circumstantial consequence. There was a time when I was an athelete. Then there was a time I was a writer and debater. Now, i'm a geek. What will come next? Have I just been testing the waters or have I been doing these things because of circumstance. If my Uncle and Aunt lived in a city close to a big arts colleges, would I be studying to be an economist or a lawyer just now, or would I be somewhere else doing something else. I seem to be getting into the topic of fate now and its very definition. Varieties of experiences, varieties of possibilities. Finally, a variety of what ifs? When I was a kid people asked me that question that so many little kids get asked. What do you want to be? My class mates gave answers like 'an engineer', 'a doctor', 'a lawyer'. The common professional fields. What did I say? I proudly annoucned that I would very much like to be a carpenter. Then in the ensueing years, I did all of the things I mentioned a few lines up there. Will I ultimately become a carpenter with a degree in Computer Engineering? They say curiosity killed the cat(who's cat was this?) Well, tonight, with me asking all these questions to which I expect no answers, unless you've see my future, makes me feel like a carpenter actually killed the cat(they use sharp and blunt objects alike). May all the evil carpenters be served justice and all the innocent cats receive repentence.

Somehow, I was getting very touchy and volatile. I think it was the fact that my days had been almost identical for the last few weeks and I had to have a change in pursuit. This may seem entirely pointless I guess, but it felt like a momentous occassion to me, so I had to write about it. I need to find better stuff to write about. I think my brain is starving. No, its living on junk food and being a bum. Well, I haven't been eating junk food and being a bum, but my brain has. Oh well, off to save my brain.

"event","The rain fell and the mist billowed along the hill side like they were running away from something. We drove slowly and cut through the white vapours mixinig with the green hills like a knife in a box of cotton. And then the heavens opened up and drops the size of jelly beans fell. I looked out my window and there i saw across the mulitple valleys and tucked away villages, the sun gleaming over the hills in the distance. Contrasts of colours, shades and shadows, a perfect blend through the window covered in rain drops. Flash!! like a tube light in a dark room, what was that? Moments later, all doubts were cleared. Faces cringed and fists tightening, the sound of thunder rolled from right above across the sky. The show was over."

"event","I spent the weekend at wild life nature reserve and it was an experience like no other. We stayed with a friend of my Dad who is an ex-marine biologist. He now sits in his veranda all day long and watches as wild life just walks by through his front yard all day long. He was a bit of a rebellious recluse starting with the Che Guevara T-shirt to him having not left his compound for a few weeks. So, for about 24 hours, we sat with him in his veranda and looked out into the jungle as hundreds of spotted Deer and Samber along with Wild Bore Pea Cocks and an Elephont walked by. It was as if a stage had been set and these animals came out and played their parts. We waited a long time for the elephants to come out, but unfortunately, my sister and I got only a fleeting glance of one magnanimous male elephant with huge tusks. That unfortunately was the one thing that I did not manage to get a picture off, but the rest, I have photographic evidence since I was carrying my camera around with me like a 6 shooter. To be at peace with nature and away from the hustle and bustle of civilization was interesting. And now, I don't know what to write. I'm afraid my writing skills have gone to seed. Oh well, not much I can do with writing skills anyway. Unless...I can use it to woe girls. Hmmm, I think I can still do that. Maybe. We may never know.

"event","So, yesterday afternoon, a childhood urge came over me and I pulled out my old Legos. My sister joined me and we started to build stuff. She made a building and I decided to go with my usual and make a car. But my car has changed from what it was. It has evolved from that fancy sports car to a scientific observatory build for alien planets maybe. I wonder what's next...

The sun peered for a few hours this morning. Its strange...I think so much and then when i want to write, all i can think about is the sun shining this morning. Most of you are welcome to comment saying ""Duh!!"" to that one. It was one of my particularly brilliant moments. I think my brain is a little starved for Math. I should play with my calculator. That might make me happy. Speaking of being random, I've managed to get back in touch with a few more friends. Talked to guy who i haven't met in two years yesterday. That was interesting. In other interesting randomness that finds its way to my fingers which in turn find their way to key board(very dangerous thing that)I may have put on some wieght. Well, it could be the jeans. But its always an interesting thing to listen to peoples comments here when they see me after a year. They see changes in me that people who see me everyday are fooled into thinking never take place. So, some say i haven't changed one bit and some say I've grown up. I don't know what I want to believe. I might go with something random there. Like, I wish I was a cow living on the moon where the craters were all filled with grape juice in the northern hemisphere and apple juice in the southern hemisphere. I wonder if that would make the dinosaurs any happier. They've been really grumpy lately. Its funny, nobody tells me I've gone mad. Well, nobody has told me that yet. I need to start taking pictures.

"event","So, I went and visited a friend today. That was fun and it was good to meet him after quite a while. We had to drive quite some distance to see him, and that was quite the chaotic experience. It is intersting how such chaos continues to propagate with no one seeming in the least bit interested in improving anything at all. The rule of the road is, if you can fit in through that gap, go for it! Consideration for anybody else seems like something that would require too much effort, yet the social environment amongst friends and family can be very close net very often. The irony of the situation is hard to contemplate at times and one stops thinking about understanding why or how. But ultimately, there seems to be no ultimate apart from, i survived the day and so did my family. Me saying all of this about my home may seem like me shooting myself in the foot but the thing is, that probably will end with better consequences than anything else. I think I quote from a very great movie is in order here.

"event","Are dreams a tool to manipulate your fate? This is a question I've been asking myself since this morning. 

In other news, the monsoon is here. I haven't seen the sun in about 3 days and there has been a constant light rain falling in the midst of heavy winds which quite frankly are scaring me just a wee bit. There are these gigantic eucalyptus trees in the park right by the house and they love to swing like they're bouncing between trampolenes placed vertcally on all sides of its canopy. But the sound of the leaves rustling in the wind sounds like rain falling and that is pretty sweet. 

I spent about three hours this morning reading Harry Potter in a quiet room with the sounds of the weather and the ticking of a very old Grand Father clock. It was quite pleasant. I've finished the first book and am more than half way through the second one now. If only we could have classes in giant castles...

"event","Things are peaceful, for the most part here. I've been busy with relatives and other stuff and that is my excuse for not being regular with updates. I've been enjoying the weather here and also got to drive a little yesterday. Might do more of that once I work up the nerves required. I had thought of things to write, but the moments passed and I will hopefully be able to get to my journal before that happens the next time. I just watched the Monaco Grand Prix and it was awsome. There is just something about racing at insane speeds through the narrow streets of a city filled with glamour and very, very sweet cars. Oh well, something to drool about.

"event","So, either jet lag or just sleep deprivation controlled me for a few days. Sleeping at odd hours and waking up at odd hours can be weird. But I think i'm over it. My stomach has been taking a while to re-acclimatize, but that too is close to normal again. So, I had a few slightly rough days as I adapted. LJ has been a weird today. It won't let me post to other peoples journals as a logged in user and neither will it as an anonymous user. So, I think I might post a response to Luke's ""normal"" posting from a few days ago here since I don't have much else to write and its quite geeky. 

""Imagine a sinusoidal curve on graph plotted with degrees vs time. Lets say the degrees represent your sense of inner satisfaction and opinion. It shifts with time. Things go up and then things go down, but then go up again. At the end, the function that represents that curve is always the same and there is no normal. We always change with time and things will be that way till time stops.""

Getting back to my boring life, I've been thinking about getting back in touch with some of my old friends here. But so far, I haven't been beyond the thinking stage. I guess I'm just waiting for the opportune moment to do so. Oh well, I'll get around to it...

"event","That was what I said when I got off the plane after finally reaching home. The long long hours and uncomfortable conditions were all finally made worth while after meeting up with my Dad and  that feeling of being home finally came back. It was about 10:15 at night when I got there and we spent the night at a hotel where I got to sleep on a bed after about 3 days. It felt good... The following morning, we began our journey back to my mother, my sister and finally home. This too was a long journey in terms of hours, but knowing that I was going to be where I wanted to be at the end of it made it all the more easier to take. The journey was excellent and when we started to climb up into the green and blue hills, I felt home blowing in the wind. It was all around me. The sounds of the birds and scratching of the crickets in the trees all said, welcome home. I finally reached home at about 5 in the evening and as we came around the corner, there were my mother and sister waiting for me. My journey was over. I was home, and I've been too busy being at home to keep my journal more up to date. But I will do my best to do so whenever the chance comes.

"event","With this, I commence my own record of happening and thoughts that I wish to share with my small world of friends. I don't think i'm going to go on one of those boring introductory beating around the bush mumbo jumbo full of big words and superfluous redundancies like that one. I've just flown about ten thousand miles which involved two days, but only one sunrise that i was aware of. And i'm pretty sure one didn't just get away from me. But I did enjoy my window seat. I had the moon shining over the clouds softly as they scattered themselves over the broad ocean for all of the 15 to 16 hours of darkness we had during flight. The sun was chasing us all the way through and finally rose ever so slowly a little before we got to Taipei. We stopped there to refuel and stretch our legs and then went on to complete the journey to Singapore where I am just now. Here, I have about 7 hours to go before I board my final plane which will take me to the shores of my homeland. I will hopefull land in the state that is called God's own country in about 11 hours from now. Well, before I start rambling, I'll bring this first entry to an end and go hunting for food, I think.

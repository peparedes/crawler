Until our veins run dry
Now we have to take this thorn
And tear it from our side
Agitated at the fault line

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Even now as I write this down
All pretensions disappear
Now our impulses will bite
At the ankles of our fear

To live
To die
swallow your pride
and take the knife
slice it through
covering the problems that follow you
dont listen
do what you do
as you slit your wrists
one last time through!

***Believe***
Sitting in your room
lonely in the corner
holding the blade high
ready to drop and bleed
your not worthy its defeat
cant handle cant stay
its gone be better of this way
dont stop me, im not here
just believe you werent near
cant speak
cant see
my last breath is taking over me
im ready to go
im not afraid
you'll will pay!


***Getting Away***
I feel hate
I feel death
I feel the blood
Im not gonna run
away from the fears
away from the knife
all I wanna do is get rid of my life
I try hard everyday
just to keep away
away from the knife
away from my life
that I hate today


***Gone Today***
Time passes you by
seems like your in a lullaby
cant control the knife
you raise it high
to take your life
cant take it no more
living life like a door
it wont be long
till your gone
cant wait
dont wanna stay
im sorry to say
Ive Gone Today!


I like these poems....very interesting and well written.'

lonely and depressed
in your room
the dark walls closing in on you
you wanna go
you picked up that knife
and sliced it twice
blood dripping to the floor
i cant here you anymore
my last words are spoken
""death is life""
you didnt want things to be this way
theres no other way it cud turn out for you
blood slowly drips
you watch with little interest
cant feel your numb
1 last breath your

I was crying during 6th today. I was just a little sad, for what reason I dont know, and then My Teacher asked me something. My teacher as talking to me about my grades and then he said something. He asked me if I cut myself and I lied to him and told him I dont and it was my cat. He said he use to work with teens who cut themselves. After he asked me he walked away and I just broke down and cried. For some reason, when people ask me face to face it just like triggers something and I just break down. I felt more worse because I lied to my teacher. He was looking at my arms when he asked me. I felt so bad. So tonight I went home, took a 2 hour nap and went to see my counselar but she wasnt their so I came home, went into my room, put on some music and then I got a knife out of the kitchen and just started to cut myself. I cant stop, I wanna stop so badly but I cant. Im getting more and more scared each day because now Im having more thoughts about ending it.

"event","Gah today was an ehh day for me. God Modesto is such an asshole. Every since he got with Amanda he's been acting like an asshole and Amanda has been acting like a bitch. Seriously, Modesto was saying shit to Steph, who I guess is suppose to be Amanda's best friend, and Amanda did nothing about it. Thats pretty shitty. Everyone see's what I am saying. Everyone can see the way they act differently and shit but no one wants to say anything. I would LOVE to tell Amanda but knowing her she'll tell Modesto and he'll get all in my face and shit and I dont want wait I dont NEED that.

Dammit Im starting to like someone.....AGAIN. 2pac! Heidi knows who that is and I dont wanna like him. I dont need to like him cause it sucks liking him. I can trust him and shit but GAH I cant like him. To much sadness comes with liking him. I'll probably end up getting hurt...AGAIN if I like him. But I cant fight with my feelings. Shit this sux ass.

School is so gay. I hate school and I hate most of the people in it. ESPECIALLY MODESTO! I can see why everyone doesnt like him!

They just woke me up and were like, ""you have to get ready for school"" and I was like WTF!! HOW THE HELL DID THEY FIND OUT? Its freakin me out so much. AHHHH its hot. Maybe its because I have a jacket on. I should take it off but I cannot. I cant let my family see my arms. :-/

My clothes are drying....yea I dont know what else to say. I dont wanna dwell on the bad shit but yea. Friday was a ehh day. LOL Fernando is so funny. I love him :-)....He wanted to dance with me so badly he kept on asking me and he picked me up and put me on where all the black people were dancing. Ok now that makes me sound so racist. LOL.

Im sad because I do have someone but its not really going so good. So either way, me and her have no one. All of our friends have some one....but it doesnt really bother me as much as it bothers her. I have Sat. School tomorrow. Hopefully the school didnt call my mom and if they didnt then Im not gonna go tomorrow but I'll go next week. Im so weirded out lately. I feel like im on a rollercoaster with my emotions. Like Im happy one minute then the next Im not. Its very weird. Im starting to scare myself more and more. My ""cat keeps scratching me"" more and more and Im geeting worried. I mean I tried to talk to someone but I was to scared to say anything about. I showed him the scars but I couldnt say why they were there even though I know why.

I asked him why and he said because I was hot and that he wanted to blow my brains out. Then later on he got mad at me cause Jose told me to say mean things to him and I did a few things. Then he asked me out and I laughed in his face! I feel so bad now. I didnt think he was serious. Now he's mad at me and I dont blame him.

"event","Well Nevada was great. My Dad had a shitty attitude with me most of the time....I got my lip peirced. Um.....I havent been feeling so good lately. I mean Im not sick, I just mean I havent been feeling great about myself. I am thinking about doing stuff to myself a lot. Like burning myself more or taking more pills or cutting again. Ive been thinking about it but I dont do it. I tell myself not to. But the feeling is so overwhelming. Its so much. 

Um...Nothing exciting going on. Nothing ever happens to me...only bad stuff and when something good comes along I fuck it all up. Thats me...one big fuck up. Oh well...I get use to it. 

Its weird. Once you've been called a name...after awhile you get use to it. A name changes who you are. It alters what you see yourself as. When you look at yourself you see what they call you. You see what they want you to see. You see what they make you see. Its very strange how cruel and evil some people can be. Its like people today have no remorse. They dont feel sorry. Its as if nothing happened. People dont care. I mean you try to explain how you feel and how you were treated or whatever but they dont seem to care. They either ignore it or act like nothing is wrong. Take what happened to me when I was in 7th grade. I was picked on a lot. I tried to commit suicide a few times. Ive cried and poured my heart out to my ""so-called"" friends and they did nothing. They used it agaisnt me to make fun of me. I did drugs once and wouldnt you know it. I told someone who I thought I could trust and she had to tell her ex-boyfriend who was one of the guys who picked on me and he told the other guys and they wouldnt stop. I had to hide from them so they wouldnt find me. I had to hide on the side of my friends house until they left so I could just be with my friends. But when they came back I had to hop a fence and hide once again. I felt like a Jew hiding from the Nazis. I mean God, I didnt do anything. I stood up to one of the guys once. He called me a name and I slapped him in the face, well he got me back. He threw me against the wall and made me go home crying. 2 other guys were there and did NOTHING. All they said was, ""You shoudlnt hurt a girl"" and the guy who threw me said, ""But she isnt a girl"". God people can be such assholes. Chris was his name. He said he liked seeing me go home in tears. He fucked me up so bad. He made me feel weak and ugly and stupid and that I didnt belong. I was so insecure and I am still insecure today. Its so sad. I cant even eat in front of people at the thought of what they think about me. I care so mcuh about what people think. I try so hard to be someone Im not. I know my friends can understand who I am but its weird. I cant even be myself around my family.

Whenever I get sad, alone, depressed or whatever. I either cut, drink, or burn myself. Sometimes I do all of them. People tell me they care but I know for a fact they dont. If they did they would try to help me or something. Instead they just sit back and watch me fuck my life up. One of these days, EVERYONE will be sorry for how they treated me or whatever. When Im gone, they will be sorry."

He said he liked seeing me go home in tears. He fucked me up so bad. He made me feel weak and ugly and stupid and that I didnt belong. I was so insecure and I am still insecure today. Its so sad. I cant even eat in front of people at the thought of what they think about me. I care so mcuh about what people think. I try so hard to be someone Im not. I know my friends can understand who I am but its weird. I cant even be myself around my family.

Whenever I get sad, alone, depressed or whatever. I either cut, drink, or burn myself. Sometimes I do all of them. People tell me they care but I know for a fact they dont. If they did they would try to help me or something. Instead they just sit back and watch me fuck my life up. One of these days, EVERYONE will be sorry for how they treated me or whatever. When Im gone, they will be sorry."

Heidi is so freakin sexy. I dont know where that came from. Im just really bored and tired. I woke up like 30 min ago. ""Dude Where's my Car?"" is on and its boring me out. Thats a major stoner movie and Im not a stoner...anyway...my Aunt is gnarly. She let me drink last night. Not like full on drinking but some of her wine. Shes awsome. My dad saw me and got mad.

What I do is my problem and I think its great that they are trying to help but honestly, they cant. I go to my counselar and she tries to help but she has no idea. Why did you put yourself as anonymous? Why can you just say who the fuck you are? Yes people have been sad and suicidal but mine has been going on since about 7th grade and the reason why I dton really tell anyone about this is because when I did they used it agaisnt me so I figured thats what is gonna happen with me the rest of my life. Wake up and smarten up? Ok I tell her to SHUT THE FUCK UP because she is trying to be my mother. I dont need her to. I know she is being a friend but still she doesnt need to be all into it and shit. Besides if she doesnt like it then she could have stopped me instead of letting me do it. She was all for it. Listen to good advice? All the advice I hear is stop this or grow up. yea thats some good advice. My parents dont even try to help me. All they do is tell me to take a pill. They never tried talking to me about it. No one has. I tell people but they ignore it. All I fuckin need is just someone to hear me out instead of ask me questions are stop me. Develop goals...hmm lets see...Um nope dont have goals. All I know is after High School I am leaving and thats it. Its kind of hard to move on with my life when Im still stuck in the same position for 4-5 years. The reason....NO ONE HELPED ME.
There...now next time you wanna say something dont put Anonymous......."

"event","Sorry I havent updated...nothing exciting has happened except the mean joke someone played on April Fool's day. A certain person started a little joke saying I slit my wrists and was in the hospital. Not a funny joke at all. Jesica(My best friend) said she was crying which I can believe but Im not so sure if she really did. Yea when I came back the next day, Tim came up to me and was all pissed and told me to never do that again. I was really pissed at the guy who told people that I did that because a lot of people started to check my wrists and shit. That got me pissed off. I hated it.

Lets see.....I am starting to drink now. Not a good thing but hey who cares. Jesica doesnt like me drinking cause she knows how I take medication and shes scared Im gonna hurt myself by doing that. God shes acting like my mom. Shes asking if Im taking my pills and shit. Fuck man I just wanna slap her and tell her to SHUT THE FUCK UP! I know she means well but seriously lay off. She got mad at Tim cause he saw me drinking and sort of helped by getting me the soda to put it in and was pisses me off is that she saw me drinking and said it was okay for me to do that. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

Um as for guys....nothing good going on. Me and Mike...ehhh I dont think anything is gonna happen. Hes still hung up on Amanda but Im told hes not and I should go for it. 

LOL **Kitten** was tipsy on Friday. But the shit she gave me was good. Not much but GOOD. 151!!!

Ok Heidi....just for you

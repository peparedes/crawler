"event","here's what we're going to do, just for the hell of it. 

we need a list of the worst possible human names ever. i know, this is more an opinion thing, but i'm sure that we can make it a little more scientific if we stick to some carefully selected criteria...

first rule, any name that doubles as a part of speech is automatically horrible. some of them are even nauseating. an
example of this sort of thing would include 'john -noun.' 

additional to that notion, any of these words that describe a particularly ugly thing, such as dirt or grit, are on the list too. such as 'ash' or 'mark'. 

hm. speaking of which, overly pretentious names too, but they're all over the place. 

honourable shitlisting goes to 'justin', as it forms 2/3 of a great number of sentences. (just in time, just in case, etc)

i also think any name that is used as a slur to the nationality of the person who goes by it (such as 'gino' or 'mick' or even 'frenchie') has got to suck. 

alright, that's a good start. if you can think of any more rules, don't hesitate to send them on my way. 

you'd think that this was a lot more peronal than it is. it's actually quite bizarrely co-incidental. 

anyway, entries on a postcard to the usual address."

"event","an exchange, at the door at Lee's Palace, Friday night (aka, day -1):

Mr. Taylor: How much is the cover this evening?
Obedient Asian Door Woman: Ten dollars.
Taylor, pointing to a sign on the table: The sign there says that Sianspheric cancelled.
OADW: That doesn't matter. Robin Black's playing. 
Taylor: So the cover is still ten dollars, even though one of the bands isn't playing?
OADW: That's right. It's NXNE. It's ten dollars anyway.
Taylor: So, if all four bands were to cancel, then the cover would still be ten dollars?
OADW: That's right.

must love the logic with which some people carry themselves.

on two unrelated notes, it doesn't please me that a pus-ridden fuckbag was the first human being i came into contact with this morning. and i haven't chewed my nails in almost a week, which is interesting, thrilling and very very fun. that's just a taste of how totally exciting my world is.

oh, and for the record, i am very disappointed with the way everything is going. bad to worse to worse and drowning in quicksand is no fun at all.

"event","how many times can we compare women to amphetamines before it gets boring?

well, i've only done it once, so tough.

i think i am doing pretty well. it's become an experiment in itself, to tell you the truth. and it's harder than quitting smoking. 

man, usually i last about a day and a half. more if i try it on a weekend. i quit smoking for almost a month. you tell me how sad i am.

in any event, yes, i feel like something is totally missing. however, i also feel a little more in control of myself, and that's just plain lovely. control is gorgeous.

it's no butterfly, but it's a start. 

now, so, here we are in june. mid year. another midyear, or new year depending on your birthday, i suppose. no world cup this june, but no enraged exgirlfriends either, so i am not gonna bitch.

of course i am going to bitch. you honestly didn't believe that, did you? thing is, i have nothing to bitch about at this particular moment in time. sure, today, this week, this year, open bitchfest. but this particular second, i am completely and totally numb. and thank god.

i should have gone to bed hours ago.

scratch that, i should have gone to bed days ago. oh, that's right....i did....

but whatever. there are cats to be scratched, cigs to be smoked, laundry to be folded, etc. 

boring as fuck these days. won't someone give me a gun? (oh, sorry...that's right.... a loaded gun won't set you free....so you say)

so tonight, the king of all bastards that ever there were idly wondered why i hadn't slipped down that 'oh so cliche road' and taken advantage of a free live journal to write about something as ludicrous as my death. 

well, that's because him and i disagree about it. personally, i would like for my mobile to be the thing that a MOAB homes in on one day when i am strolling through a syrian market or something. point of impact. 

he thinks i am going to slip in the shower and no one will find me for weeks. by then, moki will have consumed what little meat there is on these bones and it will be a dull, albeit very ugly, scenario.

to tell you the truth, i know the MOAB is a bit out of hand. but i can still hope for auto-erotic asphyxiation. and i'll do it right, michael. there will be no doubt in anyone's mind. 

oh, come on. tell me you haven't lain in bed late at night, idly dreaming of mr. kurtz auto-erotically asphyxiating himself to 'floodland' or, perhaps, 'jesus christ, superstar.'

and i know that while you were doing so, you were doing so with a savage smile in the higher cortex and a certain dampness in the lower gusset. 

thanks, andy. 

good night, you 

love mr. kurtz and ms. moki"

"event","alright, so the deadline has passed and the experiment shall commence at a time of my choosing, though it should be noted that, for all intents and purposes, it probably began a long time ago.

and we are making some changes. instead of the original 'shock and awe' carpet-bombing-silence we had initially decided upon, we'll be going with a more focused approach, with about a half-dozen strategic targets. unfortunately, this change in plans has also changed the classification of the experiment, so updates will be sparse and vague, much how i like things. 

alright, so, now that that's off our chests, maybe i should try to make some light of the past few days. i can honestly say that for the first time in a long time, i didn't have too bad a weekend. no overexcessizing, no strange ideas, no waking up in odd places (though i certainly found myself drinking in one or two of them...).

and yes, i was upset. and no, that shouldn't come as a surprise. but i did shake it quite easily, and i figure my great attitude has to do with about half of that.

unfortunately, no one will invite me camping because nobody takes me seriously. i knew it had to be something like that. 

i am gonna go smoke fags and listen to spiritualized. you do what you have to do.

far too confused right now to tackle any of the last 48 hours, other than these few points:

1. thank you for 'keeping that in mind.' i certainly hope there's enough room for it.
2. thank you for not mopping me. i've no idea what i was thinking, but thank you.
3.don't tell me what kind of weekend to have.  
4.yes, i did quit. every rule has an exception. 
5. still cute as a button, after all these years. 
6. no, that wasn't jazz either. thanks for coming out, which way did you come in?
7. you did nothing for me. 

looking back on all of that, i almost think that i am leaving too much out and focusing too much on things that don't actually matter. which don't. and the more i say they don't, the more they don't, right?

that's right...nowhere at all. but for some reason, i feel inclined to be here. it's a lot safer than the alternative, that's for certain. and after a night of verbing, giggling, 'consuming and wasting away,' etc., well, i can't think of anywhere else i would rather be. metaphysically, of course. if you go for that. 

ms. moki* (the cat/temporary (ha. whatever. 'bout as temporary as the GST.) girlfriend, for those of you going 'guh?'), has been awfully quiet (shock and awe indeed) since i returned and she's covering up her nose, leading me to believe that either i am smoking too much (not a chance, and the door's wide open anyway), or that she fears sars (even less of a chance, but stranger things have happened). whatever the case, it really bugs me that it isn't so easy for me to just curl up into a fluffy mess of a ball and be content. what's the secret? do i have to lick myself more often? whine (more) about mundane things? preen myself constantly?? ok, ok....

but i would still sacrifice seven eighths of my body mass and four fifths of my lifespan for the quiet life. especially if my owner had great hair to lick.

alright, this is getting out of hand. i am going to go away, make a glass of water (yes, i said it) and read for a few minutes. no, i don't know what i will read. i know what i SHOULD be reading, but if i do that, i am bound to finish it and then what do i have?

if i have nothing important to say after all of that, well, then i will at least be polite enough to come back and say goodbye. 

***************************************************BREAK*********************************************
alright, so that was mighty unproductive. 

but i was thinking, anyway. so at least it was occupied unproductiveness.

one year ago, i had a world of problems. and i was just getting more, which i suspected at the time, but i had no idea how stupid it would all be. 
however, i can't help but marvel at how much has happened and i can't help but feel a little tiny twitch of pride for some of the ways some of the things turned out. 

or maybe that's scar tissue looking for it's lifeforce.

who knows. 

sorry, about that little blast of sentimentality. i just get a little shock of humanity/real life every once in a while and i have to share it. 

maybe it's time to turn in. i didn't actually read anything yet, so i suppose now's as good a time as any for that and a cigarette and some quieter (and hopefully more uplifting, jesus...) music.

'night.

"event","yeah, my attitude is faltering as i come to realize many a thing. 

i think we may need to step up the deadline for the experiment to begin, sheerly based on the fact that if i have the power of speech much longer, i think i may just lose it all over this sad bunch of fucks that i am sentenced to occupying geographical and metaphysical space across this desolate continent with. 

hm. that didn't sound too positive. 

never mind. anyway, i started testing myself yesterday. and i continued today. i figure that would be something like 'preparation', though i am rarely, if ever, prepared for the things in store for me (which, let's be honest, are the shelves i almost always stock myself....)

right. so. speeding things up. time of my choosing. thousand points of light. hanging on for dear life. 

hey, if i get plowed enough to tell you everything you don't know about women later, remind me to fill you in on all the follies of human nature in general, too. that oughta be a hoot. 

much lacking,

"event","alright, so i just woke up, which is seriously impeding my chances for getting drunk for the night. and that's just fine. i haven't the patience tonight anyway, and i know full well that we'll end up here if i do, trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. or trying to draw a circle on an etch-a-sketch. 

so, just what is the problem, you ask?

quite simple, really. i don't think that i can ever safely answer my telephone again. just when i think everything is clear, someone else pops up to drag me down to their sorry, little level. and i just don't know what to do about it. 

i figured i had been doing things right. that maybe this was alright...no weirdos in a while. granted, i can be a difficult person and i am very picky and at any given time there are probably three or four people i'd rather not talk to, but these three or four rarely seem to be as persistent as some others, and that's the kind of thing that can make a guy get sloppy.

so, am i born under an unlucky sign? 

i lost the most common looking mobile in the free world in the largest building in town. in it, was every number that used to occupy some floating little scrap of paper in my world. millions of these floating little scraps were combined and converted into little tiny bit's of electricity pulsing around inside a phone. one would assume now that they were free from the shackles of these galaxies of post it notes. one assumed, as usual, wrong. (if i had a nickel for every critical error of judgement i have made, both socially and mathematically, in the past six months, i think i may be able to afford that new, smaller, easier to maintain brain i was cursing myself for not being afflicted by)  to further complicate matters, my fear of the unknown caused me to only give out that phone number to anyone, because of the control it offered me -- call comes into cell, number is displayed, i decide whether or not i want to speak with them, if i do i answer when it is forwarded to my landline. (which was nice for the two weeks until that stopped happenening after i lost my phone.) 
without that middle bit, i felt lost. now, without the forwarding, i feel crippled.

and it matters not one little tiny pop. cos again, i am paranoid about who could phone me. 

some little savages have nothing to do with their poison and if you give them the littlest bit of attention, negative or positive, they try to bite. or sting. or just irritate the fuck out of with their complete and total lack of any sense whatsoever.

does this make any sense? 

i know this sort of rant is easy to spot and write off as typical frustration, more often than not caused by a member of the opposite sex, but this is hardly the case. this is all the things i always complain about with the human race manifesting themselves in one sad, pathetic, clueless person. 

and i find that terrifying. 

alright, so i know i will one day answer my phone again. things could be worse. might even be tonight. 

but that doesn't mean it doesn't scare me back to the stone age. 

alright, enough feeling like a freak. there is a pizza somewhere with my name on it. 

once again, 
uhm, 
kisses,
mr. kurtz"

"event","alright, so perhaps i was a little vague with the objective of the experiment.

or dead wrong. or maybe i was just fucking with you.

anyway, the point is not necessarily to see if any human on the face of the earth has anything at all to say. we all know i don't care.

rather, the point should be to a) to see if the quality of my own life can be improved
                                                     b) to see what else there is going on that, true, may seem unimportant, but could prove refreshing
                                                     c) to observe changes in behaviour patterns based on the introduction of irrational, incomprehensible, and downright unnecessary circumstances.

that being said, the best way to go about this, i figure, is to refrain from doing too much talking. like, close to none.

laugh it up. but it's true. you see, i am the type of person that can charm and charm if i have to. i can be eloquent enough, seem intelligent enough, say some truly charismatic and interesting things. and then i blow it. every  single  time.

it just seems that i don't know when to shut up. rather, i know exactly when to shut up. thirty seconds before whatever it was that i said that prompted me to know that it was now time to shut up. or that then was then time to shut up. whatever you want to call it.

now, it's been suggested, attempted, and rejected that i should just not push. just zip it right when we are on an upswing.

the problem with that is, well, i have such a love for language and it's idiosyncracies, a love for quick thinking and a sheer adoration for playing devil's advocate (these are all personality flaws, not choices....) that it's just not possible. 

the only way to go is cold turkey. and i think i will become more paranoid. and i think that people will become even more bothersome. 

and i don't know what the point is, apart from sheer boredom.  at the same time, there's always the chance that i'll learn something from all of this, something positive maybe, but when you look at the sources, it can hardly be a priority.

so there we have it. i think we'll begin on sunday. that should be easy enough. june 1, 2003. commencing at a time of my choosing. 

so, until then, let's just enjoy each other's company. i will ramble on like a madman, you will soak it all up like a luscious sponge and then *poof*. 

until later,
kurtz"

"event","why is it that i am tossing and turning so much these days? i refuse to believe that i am that much of a tortured soul. 

anyway, here we are, sober finally. please any and all posted introductions from last night. however, maybe it'd be best not to, because that certainly brings us to our first experiment. 

over the next few days i will do my best (using what fragments of the scientific method that i find i still remember from back when i had an interest in science beyond bathtub meth labs) to outline what it is that we hope to accomplish. 

so, without further adieu, here is the goal of this project. (should i ever come up with a fancy way of cataloguing these, i will let you all in on it. when i say 'all', i mean 'me', as i can't imagine anyone else stumbling upon this tripe...)

OBJECTIVE : to see if any human being on the face of the earth has anything at all to say. 

alright, my shower is screaming at me. later, some background. because we all need a prologue. it's what makes the epilogue so interesting. 

love,

"event","right. so this was well written four hours ago. don't let the time fool you. it is far later.

this is where you find yourself.

here's how it's going to be. 

i was sitting there today, killing myself with the most angelic person i have ever met (not to mention, lovliest, nuttiest, most frustrating, possibly smartest, definitely most interesting, you get the drift....) and i think we deduced that, were i to experiment on human nature or sociality in general, there should be somewhere to document it. 

and here is that place (thank you karla for resurrecting my purged account....that'll teach me to slack.)

anyhow, it should be more, too. why? cos it's mine. deal with it. 

oh, how you all wish it would not be more. 

anyway, so that's that. i think that's how that was, but since i accidentally deleted it i had to rewrite it from memory. i think i covered all of the valid points, and probably a few i'd have been best off not covering. 

watch this space."

"event","I'm happy, your birthday brings a pardoning 


I woke you up that day, and it was your birthday.

We drove to see our grandma that day, and she gave us a toy from the Cheerios cereal box. And it was your birthday.

We drove 179 miles to the place I now reside and it was your birthday.

We got our stomachs mad at us, and needed something quick. We ate at Wendy's, though it was your birthday.

We loitered, and it was your birthday.

We went out for dessert, and ate ourselves into aching because it was your birthday.

We took photographs, so we wouldn't forget it was your birthday.

We drove downtown, and you saw things for the first time--things you hadn't noticed nor ever seen before. The air was perfect, the streets loud, the lights brisk, sharp with color, and it was your birthday.

We walked down the train track shaking the can of paint, and it was your birthday. 

We cowered under the bridge, and sprayed color-- a symbol of ourselves and then some latin on the columns, and it was your birthday.

We heard you say you didn't like it anymore and that you were uncomfortble and that this was it, you were leaving. You walked down the tracks alone and it was your  birthday.

We walked down the tracks into the living quarters, and soon it wasn't your birthday anymore."

  Why do You allow me wanting to know You and yet you never give clarity about HOW to know You? (Ecc. 3:11)
  Yes, yes I can love You even if I don't know You (faith).
  but how?
  How do I love something I do not know?
  Knowing warrants understanding of HOW to love YOu and you because You and you show me.
  Yes, I can love You without knowing You, but can I love You without You showing me how?
  Yes, it is possible to love You and all of you.
  [even if I think I don't know how]
 
in my mouth and to a pen:
  Today all of the negative spite and justice seeking and ugliness in me boiled over and I wrote. I am charmed by it's ugliness--the whimsy of it gives me satisfaction. And what a raw confession! I can hardly believe I have courage to share something so personal publically, but isn't that is what this journal is all about? LIVEjournal? For me, I think it is, as I ponder what is it's purpose, and hope the following tickles you...Note that the title got it's name not because it is about SHel SIlverstein, but because it is written in a nonsensical format that he pioneered...

 SHEL SILVERSTEIN'S VENGEANCE

It occured to me the other day
while imagining what
a soiled heart for to repay.
It occured to me to appear at your home
while imagining that
it was to there I venture to roam.
Upstairs to crawl into where you sleep
while imagining pat-pat
no noise, hardly a peep!
You return there, see me, and fill with joy
while imagining sat
only it occurs to you with me is another boy.
and we sit as soil on your bed.
while imagining dat
Oh the ways this will fertilze the mess in your head!
It occured to me thais was the best thing I could do
while imagining at 
to take the soil that stained my innards and give them back to you."

"event","If you are reading this, that certainly means I've been thinking of you. I've been thinking of you, and i've gained courage in doing so to share with you other things that percolate (sp?) through my system.
    Flattery has come in hoardes these days--or is it simply in my mental framework to have the confidence to recieve a compliment? A lot of it has come concerning a few personality attributes, but mostly how I look. I am indeed flattered, though surprised by constant reminders that they think my appearance  well...Let me tell you something about how I look:
        I have a pair of jnco jeans (old favorites) from the seventh grade that I still occasionally wear. My swimsuit I've had since tenth grade. My orange sneakers since the eleventh. If I should wear ""capri"" style pants, they go right to my ankles as almost perfect fit pants. When I wear stalkings, I must wear garters to hold them up because: a) they are too long and I have to fold them over and attach them to the garter to prevent sliding off or 
b) I must wear children's size and stretch them so that the garter can hold them up. At my job, to fill the coolers, cook the food, or clean  the yogurt machine I must work on my tiptoes. At work the other day we cleaned the ice cream display case out and they all chuckled with amusement as they stuffed me inside to clean the bottoom of it that no one else could reach. They close the lid and you can imagine me looking like a zoo animal there! The other trick they play is that they have me crawl in the cupboard under the cash register. They ask someone to go retrieve paper from under the register and ""BOOO!"" there is my face! ha. The girls usually scream, and I delight in the surprise. AT the grocery store I'm forced to  be a shelf climber for items on the top shelf. Keeps it adventuresome. I am not so small, but not so large I suppose either. Was it being born premature that did it? I am much like my Grandma Mimi in many ways, so I cannot help but wonder if I will dissintegrate to the same little midget that she is.
       While on the subject of myself, she types embarrrassedly, I have noticed this quirk about myself: when i delight in something, I BITE MY LOWER LIP AND GRIN AT THE SAME TIME. It seems to me I've been biting a lot lately in the past few weeks...heh. So let me tell you of it: 
            That night, the debut of a part of me--a lot of me, really--it was true and it meant so much that you all were there. I remember the commaraderie and you were actually proud in the good way and I was of you. I remember the meal and the TV put the Temptations on and we all danced as they sang! We danced indeed.  Or at least a couple of us. the next day, too, just one delight after another. I don't recall being so content in so long. Did I tell you that the tears snuck out of my eyes because I was so  happy? 
      And she came into my room, nose sniffling, wiping her eyes because she is weary of war and uncertainty. She says she must be careful about who she tells this to, she doesn't want to sway what a person has already established in her life. But I'm grateful I could be there for it. I didn't do anything to help, I don't think--or was it that I said too much? And he wrote this, and this is what made her cry:
           ""Who God is...My heart is wrestless tonight. I will have trouble sleeping--far more trouble than normal.
                 Tomorrow morning, I will wake up.
              God is the peace between the dusk and the dawn--I may often sleep through it and fail to remember it...I may have nightmares in his presence--i may wake up with sweat on my pillow and i may have trouble finding God when i do--God as a healing silence when i rest--but I will find it.
              God is much like sleep...for some, God comes easy. For some, God is routine. For me--sleep and God--it has never been either.
            I FIND BOTH when I am far too WEARY to fight them off anymore.""
    She is weary of seeking. Has she found Him? So tired of that question is she.
            I looked a little bit on my own. yes. 
      And one of the most marvelous days soon followed. Eighty degrees and we are in the backyard of a rennovated boarding house on Park Ave and i am spending most of the afternoon with dear friends and some of my most favorite musicians of all time. (mewithoutyou) The rabbit was on his leash and the food was almmost all dumpstered--marvelous fresh produce and all kinds of pasta! Great desert and the chicken  grilled and everything else homemade. They put us on the guest list and the show was enjoyed certainly. They are humans, just like us, though I think them heros. The week passes and I see certain ones of you struggle, I see your struggle and I try to understand it. Surely i feel it, if I can say. I also see you content. And TA-Da! many things are provided, and I knew You could do it, I was just dwelling in the uncertainty of how.  And then I went to that show and I waited outside in the cold wind but they let me in at the last moment and it was worthwhile (iron and wine) to hear you croon your melodies that way. After that I went to the Fallout and she met me there and we scored real good in our dumpster diving adventure. We decided then that we could call our band Anorexic Chicken. We especially like the huge bag of fortune cookies nad when I got home I had a bowl of fortune cookie cereal...I think our favorite part, however, was the dumpster full of bread dough. We jumped on it, into it and it was surreal--like walking on clouds of marshmallow!  yesternight was swell too with the application at Como Zoo--which i will probably work there!, the surprise birthday and the popper that was the best gift and the game and commarderie. You all make me laugh. Then back to the homefront where we held a ceremony for the official end of a crush for a roommate. IT WAS CLEVER !  We lit candles, made a list of why it is good it's gone, did a therapy excercise, heard a song, saw a reenactment, signed the card, always you accept yourself, and then ate kudos bars--kudos to Lauren for her being over it! I loved it. I served as the chorus and chanted ""woe is Lauren"" at the appropriate times...heh. A good chat with Gentry BOeckel and we will wear the anti-homophobia stickers on our backpacks at Bible school tomorrow. visiting with the others, a good read, and sleep...
      c'est la vie (such is life)."

<P>&nbsp;Arrived here on a whim, as though these are all tumbling around in my head as clothes in a dryer, when SUDDENLY, I've decided to hang them on the clothesline instead (where all the neighborhood can see their colors)...</P>
<P>&nbsp;Knee-up, step, step. Knee-up, step,step. ""Skida-ma-rink-a-dink-a-dink , skid-a-ma-rink-a-doo,""--they all joined me now--""I loooooooooooove you!"" Laughter and grins. We are here, now, together, all of us. It is carefree,uninhibited, inexplicable gladness. We continue: ""I love you in morning and in the afternooon, I love you in the evening, and underneath the moon, ohhhhhhhhhh, skid-a-ma-rink-a-dink-a-dink..."". Repeat. </P>
<P>I admire people who are things I could never be. I admire them profusely for that reason. This is where the opposite sex comes in.&nbsp; I admire men to the point of almost wanting to be one--though this is a hyper-exaggeration, and awkward to admit. I admire men, but not in way that makes me a thought-tramp, a lust maven, but rather, in&nbsp;a way that you distance yourself from your heroes, because you want to step back and adore...I hope the distinction is very clear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I don't know if it is the weather, I don't know if it be my body's natural tendancies, but longing is far from absent, and I understand more clearly what I want and need than I ever have before. So much pends on timing, you should know, and---</P>
<P>&nbsp;there is a boy and though he hasn't said it, I know he likes me. I can see where we have a lot in common, and I&nbsp; appreciate who he is, but I just...I don't know. He told me I looked 'tremendously beautiful' at the play, and who would refute such uncommon flattery? (or at least it is uncommon for me!) It being uncommon is what motivates me to consider him. I mean to say that it is uncommon, to my knowledge, to be liked by someone. It is even more uncommon for me to like someone and actually be liked back. But how ridiculous to like someone simply because they like you so well! That is&nbsp;a huge element, but it cannot be the only one. I just can't evoke the way he wants me to feel for him out of me, nor am I in the business of breaking hearts. Do I tell him that life is wretchedly busy right now and it's not a good idea for me to be 'involved'? That is a fallacy, to a certain degree. I cannot be dishonest. Do I risk ruining him by telling him I don't 'feel' the same way, but I value his friendship? That sounds like such a line. <EM><U>I&nbsp; don't know what to do, but I am begining to understand these:</U></EM></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am severely intrigued by boys who lock themselves in rooms--soundproof ones--and make music with their eyes closed on an instrument of choice--piano, guitar, bass.<EM> Young men who retreat away to isolation with sound&nbsp; intrigue me to the point of longing. </EM>Somtimes they have a friend with them--even a certain young lady--but still I remain intrigued. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am severely intrigued by boys who drive mopeds and grin about it. Perhaps it is an influence of the Amelie film, but somthing in me yearns to be tossed on the back of a moped with an unknown destination other than the company of our own selves. That we would whimsically take off and have no obligation to return, no sense of time...<EM>Young men with the quiet approcach of a moped and a sense of adventure intrigue me to the point of longing.</EM> Let us clarify: moped, not motorcycle. </P>
    And might I add a man who smokes a corn cob pipe? Yes, I would love to be around it. Or any pipe, really--that is, other than a hooka. I've no sensation of being near that, it actually repels me. But the smell of pipe tobacco, certainly...and oh, if even he grew it himself! yes, right next to the eggplant and the cilantro that I'm growing in the garden to eat for our supper, where after we will go for a walk while he smokes his corn cob pipe, and I wearing my favorite dress, and then we will cruise on the moped for a while and then we will have a bonfire and eat our dessert from it and--snaP! like a record stopped abruptly, what am i doing here sharing this fantasy? er--sorry...
<P>A line from the show I directed: <STRONG>Would my dreams recognize me if they saw me? Would they come to me and say, 'She is the one who imagined us?' </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </STRONG>I remain here daydreaming (of isolated music and mopeds), I have not given up. They--the daydreams--&nbsp;are a remedy to the longing, I will admit. <EM><U>I have learned that it is<STRONG> possible</STRONG> for reality and daydreams to mesh; personally, many of my daydreams have been superceded by real experiences, and these are not flavorless, wimpy daydreams!</U><STRONG>&nbsp; </STRONG></EM>However, I cannot help but wonder if I have outdone myself here...does such a young man exist? and if he does, is it even probable he might find me charming? Is it? Do you? Do you ride mopeds, retreat to music, and grin at my presence? *sigh*</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will admit, I think I've shared too much already, so I hope you are glad I welcomed you in...</P>
<P>I also have been thinking, though it's a bit too...umm...exclusive, perhaps...that the song ""Brand NEw Colony"" by the Postal Service is one of the best love songs of all time. I don't even think it goes in the 'love song' category, and trust me, there are plenty of unmatched contenders (consider:Elvis Presley--come on!). However, this one, simply gets me...it is where my longing and reality fuse face to face:</P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>""Brand New Colony""<BR><BR></STRONG>I'll be the grapes fermented,<BR>Bottled and served with the table set in my finest suit<BR>Like a perfect gentlemen<BR>I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the ancient brick<BR>Where you will sit and contemplate your day<BR><BR>I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning<BR>In an open tab when your judgement's on the brink<BR><EM>I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite<BR>Albums back as your lying there drifting off to sleep...<BR>I'll be the platform shoes and undo what heredity's done to you...<BR>You won't have to strain to look into my eyes<BR></EM>I'll be your winter coat buttoned and zippedstraight to the throat<BR>With the collar up so you won't catch a cold<BR><BR>I want to take you far from the cynics in this town<BR>And kiss you on the mouth<BR>We'll cut out bodies free from the tethers of this scene,<BR>Start a brand new colony<BR>Where everything will change,<BR>We'll give ourselves new names (identities erased)<BR>The sun will heat the grounds<BR>Under our bare feet in this brand new colony<BR>Everything will change, oOo oOo...</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel like the lines written and italicised were written just for me--sillly girl! You must hear it, really you must. That is, if you have not...</P>
<P>Next time I should go to an open mic, this is what I want to do: </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say: ""This <EM>is</EM> open mic. This <EM>is</EM> something I've always wanted to do. This <EM>is</EM> for anyone who is suffering from spring fever or horomones or both. I know you're out there, and I love you....heh. You have to help me out, though.""&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;I will begin to snap my fingers to a beat. Everyone else present will join in. That is how they help me out. </P>

     Let me tell you, by the end of our time together here you will be sick of me. You will be sick of the way I try to help you, even when you don't need it. Always I will offer to do this or that, or defend this or that, or listen to you tell of this or that. Consistently I will offer and sometimes you will need it, and sometimes not. It is the consistency, however, that surprises you. No one else you've known is so eager to offer. You will grow weary of my interest, my offerings, my need to be of some aide to you on any level. I hope against it, but truth is it may simply tire you out.

               Your heart is no match for my love.

     You probably don't believe me, but by the time our time together has expired, you will be glad for it. You will be weary of my inquiries. You will grow old of my intuitions about you. Some you will agree with. Some intuitions you will claim that I am totally off the mark about you. Other intuitions--and these are my favorite--will surprise you, as an exposed secret. You never expected me to know things about you that no one else does. Some of them I will share with you, others I will keep to myself, for I hold these intuitions sacred. You are most surprised that anyone would want to know your secrets. To me,this is the crux of why we are friends, and you are startled that my want to know your secrets is unmatched. It makes you uncomfortable and you will be sick of me.

                 Your heart is no match for my love.

     By the time we've had time here, you will be ready to be done with me. You will be tired of the coating I've slowly dripped on your life. You won't believe the way I've gotten to know you. You will be so stuffed with the benevolence and good will I've tried to achieve with you by enticing your secrets to be shared. THE TRUTH IS that I've[HE] has done everything for you and you don't know what to do with it. No, no you will not be satisfied with all that you have received, for you have received so much of it that your soul will have collapsed. Thus, your heart is no match for my love for I will smother you in the truth that is goodness.
 
                   Your heart is no match for my love.

 ANd I love telling it, though it is not the truth. I do not truly remember a first crush. I remember that in the sixth grade, I had a dream I saw Anthony Sterler naked. I had a hard time talking to him the next day, even though he sat next to me in class--I felt dirty. I didn't even really like him, not that I recall. Anthony Sterler moved to Texas soon thereafter. Anthony Sterler's name wasn't really Anthony Sterler; it was Anthony Enema, and his family had the name changed and that is the truth. I remember that one day in the sixth grade I got a note on yellow paper from the red-haired boy named Joe Wilson. It was a simple note, nad it said that he had liked me since kindergarten. Unbelieveable. I think he is married now to the only other black haired girl who was in our class. heh.

 And I remember that night, only weeks ago--though it seems a long while when you yearn for something--and we could see the endless sky and smell the endless citrus. I crawled in the bag, zipping heat, and she was saying something profound to me huddled around her flashlight, sandwiched between it and her sleeping bag. The bag was the sealant on our souls and the the flashlight it's guide and the moment like the delights of eternity itself. Though the dew soaked us in that moment, it was the best to leave the tarp off to invite the atmosphere of trees, citrus, truth, and twinkle...I love those days, as if being with a lover...a creator...better than my daydreams are such tangibles...
  and i want to write more of into the forest after the citrus, but alas. I shudder into exhaustion, and hope none of it goes forgotten and petition to God for the continuation of a severed independence...

and i will tell you, if the morrow comes, that my first crush was Conan O'brian. :)"

things I would like to write about:pocket revolution (thank you dave, I like you more than I should though you will never read this...hee...), deep puddles, rebellious jews, angst on angsty, sip the hills/sunset, eyes that inevitably twinkle, makeshift abode, and silver hair of our grandmothers...and how I will tap dance a beat while Steffon does freestyle...

and now some words from a brother that articulate mostly what I mean to say above--though it is still obscure....of course I could never write of it straightforwardly, cause then you would know me, there would be no mystery, and I you would have me figured out? ANd why am I so afriad of it? I laugh at my own insecurity!

MY EXIT UNFAIR by Aaron Weiss
My exit, unobserved, my homesickness, absurd
I said ""water,"" expecting the word
Would satisfy my thirst!
Talking all about the second and third
When I haven't understood the first.

Jonah, where's that boat going - 
Your ship set with eager sails?
There's a swirling storm soon blowing
And no use, fishermen, in rowing from a consecrated whale!

And just like the clouds they bring a darkness and a hard rain's gonna fall
I felt the crowds bring a loneliness and a hard rain's gonna fall.

She always weighed me down
But, afraid I might need her, I dragged her around
(It's best to keep close sackcloth and ash in a whitewashed town)
She wore that phony smile on her face,
I guess like a bandage on a wounded place
While I kept the keys to every old lock just in case.

Rehearsed indifference tossed aside,
Our narrow arms spread wide, 
""What unseen pen etched eternal things on the hearts of humankind - 
But never let them in our minds?""

The clouds they brught a darkness
And a hard rain's gonna fall
And all my laughter ends in emptiness
And a hard rain's gonna fall.
My every medicine causes more illness
And a hard rain's gonna fall
And until I let you go I didn't know, you were never mine at all

But now I spend my days in ever-increasingly complicated ways
Convincing myself of the rightness of each word I say
My exit, unfair if unobserved! My exit, unfair if unobserved!"

                 SILENCER
You gave me hope that I'd not lost her 
And then thought it rather strange to see me smile- 
as I don't do too much smiling these days. 
She put on happiness like a loose dress 
Over pain I'll never know 
""So the peace you had,"" she says,
""I must confess, I'm glad to see it go."" 
We're two white roses lying frozen just outside his door 
I've made you SO HAPPY and SO SAD, 
But which should I be more SORRY for? 
Come kiss my face goodbye,
that space below my eye and above my cheek 
Cause I'm faint and fading fast, I see a darkness 
And I shall be released. 
I'll pass like a fever from this body, 
And softly slip into His hands 
I tried to love You and I failed, 
But I have another plan. 
My Lord, how long to sing this song? 
And my Lord, how muchmore of this pretending to be strong? 
When she stands before your throne 
Dressed in beauty not her own 
All soft and small, you'll hear her call 
""you brought me here, now take me home."" 

               CURE
The cure for pain is in the pain, 
so it's there that you'll find me. 
Until again I forget, 
and again He reminds me, 
""Hear my voice in your head,my child, 
and think of me kindly."" 
Let me be, let me be.. 
Lowered down like a casket 
and buried just below his chest. 
I opened like a locket, 
""If you're ever cold,"" I wrote, 
""there's warmth inside me. 
I'm the pocket of an old winter coat."" 
But where she used to say ""I need you."" 
Now....""I don't."" 
You'd only make the softest sound, 
like sugar pouring into tea. 
Darling let your Self pour down 
and dissolve into the Love 
who revealed Himself there quietly to me... 
(Jesus have mercy on us.) 

 I NEVER SAID THAT I WAS BRAVE 
You might sleep, but you'll never dream 
Onward! Progress! Or so it seems. 
You might laugh, but you'll never smile. 
Come here and waste away awhile. 
When dreams of rings of flowers fade and blur 
Giving way to that familiar ill 
waiting for you still
if you'd open white curtains   
If you'd unlatch the window, 
If you'd let me lay there on your floor 
If you'd give me  
If you'd forget the pain I caused before 
No use in saying how I'm sorry 
So I'm trying not to speak 
I'll sing in silence, lay beside you 
With my face against, against your cheek 
My stomach swears there's comfort there 
In the warmth of the blankets on your bed 
My stomach's always been a liar- 
I'll believe it's lies again. 


  perhaps these have just been on back file for a long time, BUT friends, beloved, why do I bother to put these words here? I guess i could use feedback...what do you make of it? I'm starved for your perspective...

"event","I had animal crackers for breakfast and they slid right through me...
   Different cultures ""kiss"" one another in different ways. I've been pondering the kiss as of late, not in a fantasy sort of way, but the reality and ah...the essence--the meaning--behind it. Why do AMericans lack kissing or excessively kiss in the ways that they do? When was the kiss birthed? All of creation, perhaps, is a kiss sent to God. Someone sent me kisses in the form of flowers and funky candies this week and I cannot tell you how much it means to me...
      I always, pending on my knowledge of the person, kiss my family members(within reason) and most of my better friends on the cheek. A boy in Jr.High wanted to kiss me but I held his hand cause I didn't know any better and really I only felt sorry for the kid. I kissed A BOY WITH A SCAR on his lip and a boy with A SCAR on his eyebrow. (""I'll show you mine if you show me yours first; Let's compare scars I'll tell you who's is worse; lift up your shirt--the wound isn't there"" --Lyrics of Connor and HIPV) The boy with the scar on his lip was because he stood up to someone at a party and that someone took a fist and I believe a beer bottle to his face and in one punch the boy is bleeding. He puts his hand to his face and feels the blood, tastes it, and then realizes that his bottom lip is hanging there, suspended from his face, hinged by a piece of skin. It healed fine, and you cannot tell it. I was sitting on the deck of my apartment with him on a warm October day and I said, ""do you know what time it is?"" and he said, ""it's time to kiss me!"" and smacked me a quick one right on the lips. ""ha ha!"" he chuckled as he turned to look out from the deck. Shucks, I adore spontaniety. Later, however, he kissed my neck and I appreiciated it and we studied our hands and he kept kissing my neck and then my face and then he was gently trying to kiss me everywhere and I could feel the scar tissue and...and I gently drew away because I knew he was only thinking of her (his former lady of two years) and I wasn't thinking, I was aghast at the kisses and wondering about my someone else. He was a good kid, with his scared lip; exciting, handsome; albeit a bit keen on a fellow called Darwin and a bit unsure on a fellow called Jesus Christ.
 It is the boy with the scar on his eyebrow I have kissed the most and I wonder how it came to be. Those kisses suited me, it seems. And I think I am not raw of it anymore, but always alert of it and wondering, how and whom can I send kisses to today? Perhaps not even the tangible sort...but alas, do you ponder such things? I've kissed many a being, and yet have infinate hope that these expressions carry as much for the recipient as they do for me...
      And WHY? Why this spontaneous commentary on affection and expressions of oneself? *shrugs* Guess I'm just realizing who I am. The moral for my peers and anyone who is human, I suppose: Don't worry, hormones are natural!
       Comical: I got accused of being a lesbian by an old woman baptist recently. Heh. Perhaps I should ponder skinny dipping with more grave considerations, but I won't. Confessions of a Kels. Muuuuuuuuuah."

 A month in a different nation...what can I say? The adventures I seek daily seemed to have all mashed into one glorious month. Confessions come readily: knowing now what I know of myself, of God, of people, it is pleasant to return to things familiar. SUCH ADVENTURES, I could gush and ramble of them, they deserving their own novel, and indeed I will.
     But perhaps later. When you recall, think of Europe, and blow it kisses.

"event","On thursday, it was a usual tideous morning-except that you got the Sufjan Stevens and CoCoRosie CD's you've been lusting after for months. fool! :) You tried listening to God, but ever distracted, you did most of the talking. Meet up with Erin Grace, had some food at her suggestion, and headed to the soap box factory and it's freak stinking obscure location. THe exhibit was called ""Your heart is no match for my love"" and your favorite piece was called ""It'll all come out in the wash"" and ""God loves you"". It'll all come out in the wash was a done by a man who wrote song lyrics on slips of paper and distributed the papers to people's pockets and bags and then took photos of them--all of it unbeknownst to them! You grin, because it sounds like something you would do...the other exhibit was a video of two tv's shouting preacher stuff. These two guys throw bowling balls at the tv's and knocked them out, but the one tv kept going and the preacher man on tv kept preaching! another startling exhibit was a video of a man who did she loves me, she loves me not, head down picking daises limbs, and with every limb/petal he picked he grew closer to crying and eventually wept. May you never injure a man this way, Kels.
then you went to Jenni's and had a whipped cream fight, and though it was short lived, you laughed and it was great...sitting at the end of the dock watching her feet hit the water and reminiscing about life--up north. You ate food you couldn't afford and headed to the Fallout Gallery to help set up for the show on Saturday. It's too magnetic for you, you can't stay away. You did dishes with Yahoo, and moved couches with Lindsey. Then you STeve, and Lindsey went to Seward Cafe (SPokes night!) and a man with guitar played and you sort of celebrated Lindsey's birthday (she lives in CA) while she sipped her tea and enjoyed each other's company in tight, intimate silence.
      Saturday, well...Reading in the AM, and once again all day making efforts to listen to God, all the while talking to Him. THough you realize, don't you, how he works in your life even when you don't know it...yes, yes, your senses are increasingly keen to it. How could they not be when he's changing your fucking life? You tried not to think about IVan, who showed interest in you, you think. Exchanging numbers...*sigh* You went to the Source to help set up and did dishes again with YAhoo. :) I love that man--an exceptional creature, devisor of bootypunk. Soon the event began and people came and went all day. The Skateboard stuff in warehouse three--very intertaining, most skaters in their infancy; delectable music (especially Desert City Soundtrack) though a bit too loud. THe Gallery showed the art skaters had put up...it drew in all kinds, though, and this was the first skater event the Fallout has done. It was funny, I stepped out to get fresh air and everyone was smoking outside the door--Christains, non-christians, skaters, artists, musicians, homeless, who the heck ever. heh. I understand the pressures anew--how it feels awkward to be the minority. eh. *shrugs* The event went from three to elevenish and it was fun to dance with Lindsey and do jumps and windmills with Mandy and Stacy--don't forget free food! Then, you, STeve, Lindsey, Mandy(black hair short Mandy), David, Abbey, Nate,Catherine all went to Calhoun Lake Park and played on the equipment--the marvelous, superduper unforgettable teeter-tooter! Oh, you laughed so hard you ached and cackled and they all laughed along--especially Nate. THe playground stimuluated good times and good conversation...you nad Lindsey on the swings over the Lake- the city lit--and humming ""a middle aged woman, she's shuffling her feet...I la, la, love them, I loooove them...come for the week you can sleep in my bed, and sail through my life like a dream in my head..."" of good ol' Bright Eyes. Soon talk came of food, and we ventured, at one am to Flameburger in ST.Paul, consuming greasy fries, french toast, and for the vegeterains, onion rings. You hardly recall having such good times, feeling so good, not feeling an emptyness in your chest and in your emotions afterward. Feeling yourself, for once, and able to be a part of something just as you are...whoa
     Today the family comes, nice. You feel fucked, however, cause of the increasingly lacking money and the frivilous way you spend it on food and now the car is trying not to work AT ALL...the check engine light flashing at you, fool. Damn. Probably you will try to sell your videos, if the car gets you there, and you will call dad (fathers' day) and you will go back to Flameburger because they are hiring. Most of all you will enjoy the company of God and of your family, these that created you. Have a good time in Poland, Kiddo!"

      My ""Christian"" college has a statue of our mascot, and thus I've concluded the following: We spew out ideas, throwing our heads back yelling in protest, desiring truth--reality--to be untrue. The reality is that they serve AIDS for breakfast in AFrica. It sickens us, as we shell out money for a stellar statue. Being proud of ourselves, we stare at the pillar, gawking at the achievement of our dollars molded in the shape of a school mascot. The same mouths smiling at our own reflections in a pillar while spewing sympathies (apathies?) of other nations...
        So, being inspired, I began a little somethin'somethin' that I invite you to help me complete. All that is require is a nation, it's truth, and a word that rhymes with breakfast. It can be positive or negative...I appreciate any contribution. Here it be:

      In Africa, they serve 
      AIDS for breakfast.
      In France, they serve

"event","well...
   i feel an almost urgent need to gush with writings of goings on because they have all been quite marvelous--albeit a bit up and down--but marvelous enough that I do not want to forget any of them.
   A few Thursdays ago I went to this place called Lurcat with soft chairs, a manufactured rustic setting and a live jazz band that I am semi-friends with. I went there with three other women, and they all dressed quite beautously--as beautously as a college student can afford. Some of them have money, you know?! It was a delightful evening--the jazz band was broadcast live on the radio, and a businessman from PA gave me a kiss on the cheek--odd.
   Friday, I helped Jake and Libby--two folks increasingly like family to me--set up and carry on with their cd party. Great times, good good live music--free. A woman named Linda--blatantly poor all the way down to her speech--wondered in and I bought a cd for her and ended up taking her home with me so that her drunken boyfriend wouldn't hurt her. Maybe not the best move, cause now she doesn't stop calling and I am nearly as poor as she...
    Sunday, being mother's day, I went hiking with some pals at Taylor's Falls--about an hour North of the Cities. Wonderful times--refreshing, amusing, nice time before finals. I confess, it made me feel fat, however, realizing how unrecreational my life has become! hee hee...we picked flowers along the way, and ate the honey out of columbine flowers--at the end we dedicated the gatherings to our mothers. My idea,--surprisingly romantic for my usual existance.
   Monday I went to work and this little man I've decidedly developed a fondness for was around and about. HE laughed at all my murmurings as I tried to get the yogurt machine to excrete it's final parfait...it was nice to greet such handsome eyes. I've discovered he has the same anti-Northwestern sentiment as I do! I mean, we both appreciate NWC, but see beyond home-schooled stereotypes and the reality of the world. He knows nothing of me, and I'm quite sure nothing will ever come of it, but alas--i did not think i could ever feel this way again. It is solely fun. 
     Tuesday was the party at Aaron Spading's(wanker wankis) beautiful and charming home shared with Brooke,Molly, John, and Baaker. It's really the only place I ever go to party, cause I know I will enjoy myself, and that it won't get dramatic. All other parties I've been to usually do...Baaker got a tattoo around his elbow that says ""Immerse your soul in love"" and i don't know that I've ever been so fond of a tattoo as this one. He also has one on his left bum cheek that he showed me that states ""Grade A Beef"". *snorts* I love that kid. It was good times, and I met some lovely people--though most in a stupor. I gave LEah a rough time as I watched her toke up(out of a wine bottle--homemade) because she said she was going to abide by the lifestyle statement awhile back...and she is the president of our community service club, so alas. Funny times. Leah, Baaker and I lay in bed listening to Sigur Ros, and although I wasn't high as they were, I felt it to be one of the most beautiful moments life has to offer...*sigh* They're all moving out of the house now--it was the last hurrah. I am bummed...
    Wednesday I went out with my roommates as our sort of last pure enjoyment of the three of us. I've never, ever lived with any people in my life and had it be so wonderful. No problems with these two...all smooth. I hope endlessly that the people I surround myself with in life are like that...c0-ed housing, my own family, whatever--may it be so swell as this. Lisa and I move into our new, smaller apartment this weekend...
      It's been a good times as of late, also. I've no job because the school year expired, so when I'm not frantically applying for jobs, I've been pursuing hte following: I watch old silent and foreign films. Listen to all kinds of music, reading books--most of my adventures being supplied freely by the good ol' library. Get yourself some! I've been kinda writing letters...playing raquetball, though not too fun by yourself. Preparing to do my training with the source (www.sourcemn.org), and also preparing for Poland. My friend Carly is staying with me for last week nad this week because she is in summer school and the chats I have with her are the greatest. Friday night I went to the buck theater with Erin Grace and a whole troop of NWC kids nad it was delightful. Saturday morning was Carly's birthday and we made pancakes with raspberries and organic syrup and went to the FARMER's MARKet! It was entirely spectacular. WE peeked and gawked at everything, and I've hardly been so happy in my entire life! Lisa nad I have decided we will go there weekly or biweekly instead of the grocery store. It is cheap and natural...wowee. Lisa and I drove around the Cities SAt. Night and ended up at a Co-op with Spokes pizza (pizza delivered on bikes) and there was live music! A man dressed in 1940's gear played a steel guitar and sang a backwoods-on-the-bayou-sort-of-folkly-howlnig--pretty--blues music and it was great. There were attractive people there. Lisa had tea and I a slice of pizza. We went home and Carly wearing her brand new dress she'd sewn with us the night before featuring a big hot air balloon, was still at the Dashboard concert...Sunday was swell..church and a session on homosexuality--i'm quite unknowing, so I went--and then I joined my great,great pal Jenni at Buffalo Wild Wings for the T-wolves game--exciting! yes, so...Yesterday..more job hunting adventures and the like nad lisa and carly and I watched the fascinating mating habits of birds in austrailia! ha.
      On my mind and in my prayers as of late:
          jobs, bleh
          if all earthly things are material, then are emotions too?
         GAINED CLARITY OF SELF AND IT'S PENETRATION OF ENTIRE BEING
         people, people, people. 
         modern/postmodern/the issues the church and faith is not dealing with or are dealing with in a way opposite of Christ

          a man who will bring me gifts when he sees me, but every gift will be his latest dumpster dive find--what charm!

          if you change for other people, you lie to yourself
          people, people,people

I love it when it rains. uuuuuugh how it penetrates my senses! if only i could make love to it in gratitude...

""Christians are often so heavenly minded they do no earthly good."" -Patzia

if only I could make love...at all. I do try everyday, it is really the only thing i'm here to do--love others...and I have developed an amusing fondness for a certain young man. My care/concern for others has led to a series of miniscule epiphanies this week that will alter my exterior greatly. Alas, I feel as I am emerging from what it is I have been battling this long year. It comes clear now, as my reflection in the puddle of the rain that I lavish. Yes, I know now how I must mend myself, but it is not easy to unteach yourself. 
What is it like to go beyond content to happy? to not feel rejected when you cannot meet another person's needs? To know how that feels to have your personal needs met? And to then, with your needs met, be a whole and contributing being to those around you...? What does that feel like? To have your needs met and not have to grieve? To have someone look out for you? I, in my senses, in my sould, just want to know...I, harkening back to the last year, venture to find out. 
   I've not been around these parts for near too long, and already I am having the trouble of most places I go, I cannot help but run into people I know...is it because I tend to frequent the same (familiar) places? or because I stay somewhat within a condensed area (of ST.Paul suburbs)? even going to Minneapolis, however, the faces--we know each other...this city--this metropolis--is not so big as it seems. The city is small...
 outside my window a skinny kid with brazen skin and eyes so big they nearly protrude out of his sockets rides bike, while a Muslim gal glides on her rollerblades. The old man with a beard so long the breeze toys with it strides to the garage to work on his motorcycle, wearing his jesus shirt...
  days ago i was at a Jewish synagogue. The cantor (singer) sat down. I observed him and watched his eyes pause. I noticed a red headed, beautifully brown-eyed woman glance to him. He was wearing his Jewish gear and she a green suit that flattered her. She touched her fingertips to her lips and then gestured his way and the corner of his mouth crept into a dimpled half smile. Still, they gazed at one another. I returned to the text in front of me and attempted to follow along with the yiddish and hebrew and the fella receiving his Bar-Mitzvah. Minutes later, I looked back to the woman, to see if I could see her pretty eyes, but still she gazed at the man, her husband, and he at her--faltering, or anything else in the world was just not an option. 
   IF only we could all be so deserving to be as rich as they be!!! i wish it for you, no matter what form it comes in..."

"event","[Today:]
   Most days I have all of these about me: wits, a bag of tea, and a cherry dispostion. Today, in contrast, I had none of these about me. Given in to complete chagrin am I. (Kels--what would I do should I be without Brianna, Jake, Libbs, and the russian tortise LArry?)

[Rhetoric:]
    Is livejournal an instrument to say things to one another we otherwise never could? ack. I assume that is entirely situational, pending on how one utilizes this tool...

[U&me:]
    ""Wait--They don't love you like I love you."" This is a song by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs entitled Maps. If there were any karoke I ever sang t'would be this tune. Amazing musical movements. Such profound connotations for me personally. I find myself inevitably feeling this way about most folks I encounter on this earth. In a blunt and less diplomatic route: I tire readily of dispensing,gushing my love to others and receiving not quite the same overflow in return. I love one or two or three individuals like this in particular; no one else could love them as I do. Some may love them better than I do, or be more suited to love them than I am, but no one could ever love them as I do. And indeed the only truth I know is that the superior ""powers that be"" indeed exists to tell me that no one loves me or even loves me as it(He) does.  Which is above any chigrin I feel...
 
[Long time coming:]
     The physical space I discover to be my living quarters are ever so commodious. I might even say I relish them. Savoring how each room has worked itself, priding myslef in all the little quirks and eclectic decors about the place. It is lavished...The people that live across the way adorn covers on their heads that come in colors that contrast their dark skin. Instead of sending one person down to acquire the laundry, the little girls always carry the load/basket together. Their keen sense of community is awe-inspiring. When they cook it fills the hall with peculiar olfactary such as bug spray, even though they make food!  The people in the apartment next to us is a young lady--my age--who lives with her mom. The young lady works the night shift at UPS, and has one of the most beautiful faces I have ever come across. If the apartment they have is the same layout as ours, and the daughter works the night shift, I cannot help but wonder if it is her or her mother that sounds sexually active...?! Or is that, perhaps, a set of gerbils that pursue reproduction very carnally? The people that live down and across the hall are boys who graduated high school last spring and are reminiscent of the people I myself graduated with. They are from a small town and are attempting to start a band called ""Five Stars for Failure""--irony. We have visited on rare occasions and had them over once for homemade lasagna. There were three of them, but one is not in the band, he is in the guards and he left for the MiddleEast in February. There were actually four, I think, but the other skinny,drug-infested kid is in the Navy and he left before we truly met him. The kid who left for the army had some hilarious training stories. Yep. The folks that live above us are more heavy set and enjoy communicating to each other via shouts. Sometimes I hear them shouting over whether or not they will have enough grocery money. The daughter often comes with her two kids, and they are of the most adorable looks with their backpacks as big as their own bodies. This woman, she can really bellar and she shouts out at them odd (early) hours of the day from her deck. She would be a good jazz singer. I think she is in charge of the maintenance in the building. They keep their satellite dish in a five gallon pail on their deck. The men that occupy the apartment below us have an enormous blue van that they spent most of the fall retarring the roof of. They seem to be bringing couches in and out of their dank abode constantly, and they never open their windows. Rarely seen, they appear to range in age from mid-twentys to mid-fortys. They all seem to be comfortable in a laid-back nearly sloppy lifestyle avoiding haircuts and shaving...it is good they have one another. I don't see them much.
     That is all I know."

The Bell
By Stephan Smith

""Oh where are you going?"" said the man at his desk
""I'm going to a new world,"" said the child and he stood
And he stood, and he stood, and t'were well that he stood
""I'm going to a new world,"" said the child and he stood

""Oh I'm sounding drums of war,"" said the man at his desk
""Oh, I will not fight your war,"" said the child and he stood
And he stood, and he stood, and t'were well that he stood
""I will not fight your war,"" said the child and he stood

""Oh, but don't you love your country?"" said the man at his desk
""Yes, I do, but you don't,"" said the child and he stood
And he stood, and he stood, and t'were well that he stood
""I do but you don't,"" said the child and he stood

""Oh, but do you know the truth?"" said the man at his desk
""Yes, you lie and call it truth,"" said the child and he stood
And he stood, and he stood, and t'were well that he stood
""You lie and call it truth,"" said the child and he stood

""Oh, you must be scared to die,"" said the man at his desk
""No, I'm prepared and you're scared,"" said the child and he stood
And he stood, and he stood, and t'were well that he stood
""I'm prepared and you're scared,"" said the child and he stood

""Oh, I think I hear a bell,"" said the man at his desk
""Yes, it's ringing you to hell,"" said the child and he stood
And he stood, and he stood, and t'were well that he stood
""Yes, it's ringing you to hell,"" said the child and he stood

   It is a marvel, and perhaps you have to hear it to understand its potency. It is remiscent of :
Simone WEil, A Jewish philosopher during world War 2
     ""In the period of preperation the soul loves in emptiness. It does not know whether anything real answers it's love. It may believe that it knows, but to believe is not to know. Such a belief does not help. THE SOUL KNOWS FOR CERTAIN ONLY THAT IT IS HUNGRY. THe important thing is that it announces its hunger by crying.  A child does not stop crying if we suggest to it that perhaps there is no bread.  It goes on crying just the same. The danger is not lest the soul doubt there is any bread, but lest, by a lie, it should persuade itself that it is not hungry. It can only persuade itself of this by lying, FOR THE REALITY OF ITS HUNGER IS NOT A BELIEF, IT IS A CERTAINTY.""
   
        Which reminds me of(inner battle):
    I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is good. But in fact it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me. For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me. (Romans 7:15-20)

  SIgh.
   I hope all is well."

"event","I thought the hammock would unravel forth from it's dank spot on the shelf, but it is a good thing it didn't and I'm wanting to close the window now, because it is cold, but the sound of the rain brings ever so much comfort that I'll shiver instead.  
         I lavish the wet earth. 
      Need I move to the West Coast? I often ponder, but I would probably get SADS(seasonal affective disorder)...
  I write this all so I will not forget it. It is easier to type it. I hope I am able to write it in an expression of how much it stimulates me, not as simply a log of adventures. Which is, what it is. i know you don't want details, but I do...

   ENTER:
      Weeks ago and I am stranded at my shared abode wondering what to do next. I call up a friend and she claims she can help me...Together we jump my vehicle, and as the engine revs so does my excitement. I hop in the vehicle, cold and dispensing music, and sail to a cafe where I hope to meet 'gypsy voyage music'. The cafe is off of Franklin, and I leave my car running--though not trusting that it will be safe, despite it being locked. I arrive at the plant infested, no-cell-phones-please cafe where they are putting a log on the fireplace and the music is over. Only my two pals remain, and the workers and the musician. He is a man who goes to my school, his father teaches science. I met him at a hardcore Bible Study infested with scallywags, eccentrics of all sorts, and even the homeless. It is a marvel. Last time I went, the guy in front of me had Fuck you tattooed on the back of his neck and I chuckled to myself, ""yup, he's a convert"". The cafe is neat(I just recently put a job app in there). I had a most marvelous piece of pizza there for it was pizza night. It's all natural, best cheese my tastebuds have encountered. I then ventured to jazz at Brilliant Corners--ever so beatnik. It was Doug Little--gah! And his Quartet, some of the best jazz the Midwest has to offer--I was unaware he played at Corners...The kid behind the counter was delightfully friendly, and made a face at me when I left.  I have left my car running this entire time...Then off to my pal Aaron's for a party--it was great as we conversed of our lives and truths and how Valentines day candy is wretched and scheemed our own cynical sayings for those corny hearts, while watching our friends use the ""new stemware"" guzzling wine. My car still running at three am, I gave a ride home to U of M chics at the party and slunk home to my abode. Do do do do do--oh what a night.  The rest of the weekend remained very chilled, and I do not remember any noteworthy activity; though it seems I am forgettings something...
      The weekend prior to this one was Saturday night spent at Jenni's home in Duluth. I am realizing what an integral being she is in my life...
       Next Weekend: Brian P. Movie, wine, Fight Club, converse
                     Family! ,Crowns @ the Gutherie, Olive Garden, Snackies, souls ready for church but not bodies, rented film, shopping and it's done...
       Next Weekend: Mall taxes, Hard Times Cafe, Aaron's party ""new"" stemware and a deaf kitty; work all day, A semester-made video by two pals-great...rest and Balls at Southern Theatre where Aaron again sings CLapton(oh kels, the night, the dress) and an orignial and a tap dancer taps...an attempt to find old friends but they have been robbed. Morrow brings Grace with Lisa and her pal Sarah...
      Next weekend:have mercy Bright Eyes at Pantages theatre with other musicians and I am in utopia. Meeting Lisa's brother, the infamouis Sam and heY! A kid from NCYC...Books For Africa venture in the AM and my hands are dirty from touching countless books--I love being visibly dirty.  Am again and a green vintage dress at a Presbyterian church of thirty and it rained--making it perfect. When Hillary got home that evening, we three ended up at Applebee's (thank you gift certificate) and had a blast bathing ourselves in the laughter of each other's company.  Sigh.
      Tuesday of this week brought Steiger HardCore BibleStudy followed by dumpster diving at co-op natural food places but scored the most at the Walgreen's bin...Friday brought the Tooth and Nail Records Show where I FELL IN LOVE with Mewithoutyou and the Quest is a unique venue. SAturday morning brings a tour of the GUTHERIE and the afternoon I watch the JAzz Singer (first talkie)and nap and try to study. The evening brings a rendition of Romeo and Juliet once again at the Gutherie. Then back home to do nothing and read and such. Sunday morning brings times at St.MAry's Basilica--mmmmmmmm. And the Seward's Cafe and a venture to Electric Fetus. The rest of day was done in study and cleaning and various activity and watching ""rebel without a cause"" and then a walk to return the movies becasue for once it is so fucking nice outside. And Hillary and Lisa come home and we together recognize the presence of gargantuan(the invincible insect) and something must be done of it.
         AMEN"

 and the tub contains water
 and i am

 scrubbing seductive stalkings
 
making shapes out of the bubbles
 stabbing the water with my fingers 
 and singing pirate tunes 
 all the while 
 the beloveds that I live with
 engage in
 
 copacecticly comical conversation
 
about poop
 all of us, snorting now
 just trying to breathe 
 (especially Lisa--she has asthma)
 as the laughter drowns us
 and I think, feel, know
 that I haven't known
 such simple
 
  bodaciously benevolent bliss

 in so very long
 that I had to gather my breath
 dry my hands
 and write 
 of it

"event","Might I reccomend the film ""Fight Club""? It blew me away. I wathced it by myself on a Friday night and it blew me away. 
        I didn't know what to do. It blew me away so i had to have a cigar...and I'm not even exactly a smoker. 
         I do so enjoy such explorations of the human condition.
      I have noticed this is the thread all my passion have in common: the human condition. it's why I do what I do.
         so see the film. Be enlightened. Decide what to do afterward.
          Have a Cuban. Say your prayers."

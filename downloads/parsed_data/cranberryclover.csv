"event","October has always been a special month for me--
 Birthdays of some of my dearest people-- Daddy, Jess and Renee.
 The day I got to know my favourite person in the world five years ago.

This week has got to be one of the happier weeks I had ever since the start of the Assignments Avalanche.
The past few weeks were simply terrible (Miche can bear testimony to this).

Met up with two of my closest friends whom I haven't met for ages and realised
how much I missed them!

The institution is making me stupid, I don't seem to be able to write anymore.
I had such a difficult time completing a 1,000 word essay. BAH!

Anyways, I wanted to write because I suddenly feel very thankful.

Thank you--

Miche, for being in the institution with me, I don't know what I'd do without you.
Thanks for taking care of me, letting me cry on your shoulder and sorry for irritating you at times :X

Baby, for doing work, staying back in school so you can go home with me. Thank you for going early
to school so you can accompany me on the icky journey to the west. Thank you for picking me
up from the mrt station even when you were watching the last episode of hikmah (you makcik).
Thank you for eating marketplace sushi buffet, popeye's etc with me to satisfy my cravings.
You are the best! I wish I could put you in a box and bring you every where and take you out&nbsp; everytime 
I need chering up.
I love you siaoban! *ruffles hair*

I don't really know what is the point of this entry--i just feel glad to be alive :)"

"event","I bought all 6 of the Harry Potter books from the borders 3 for 2 offer.<br />I finished 4 books in 2 days.. heh..<br /><br />Been spending time online looking at interesting fansites.<br />It's amazing how some people have so much time to analyze and<br />find clues to prove that Dumbledore is not dead; how J.K. Rowling<br />apparently dropped us so many clues to tell us that he's not dead.<br />Only to be debunked by Rowling herself that Dumbledore will not be <br />doing a Gandalf. Talk about over-interpretation. Reminded me of a<br />certain 20c lesson when we were discussinf 'Bliss' and the pear tree. haha.<br /><br />Anyways, I stumbled upon this quote i had to show you guys:<br /><br /><b>""Author Salman Rushdie, along with his son, came to ask, after a detailed theory, <br />if Snape is good or bad. J.K. Rowling replied that ""your opinion was correct."" <br /><i>Rushdie's opinion, unfortunately, was hard to follow</i>.""</b><br /><br />Hahahahahaha! hilarious!!<br />We can totally understand eh, Miche??"

The topics are soo boring, I just can't concentrate on reading.&nbsp;
The book is chock full of grammatical errors, I think i paid more attention&nbsp;
to those as opposed to the content.
After a few lines, my mind just wanders away and I have to force
myself back to reading the next few lines and the cycle goes on.

I was listening the Music and Lyrics soundtrack and I love it!
Hugh Grant has a surprisingly nice voice. Hugh Grant reminds me of Alex.
Hugh Grant is getting old and he's beginning to look like Mr. Prince, my JC&nbsp;
lit teacher and he attacks paparazzis with a box of beans. haha.
I want to watch the show. Apollo, download for me?

I read the Heyer *sheepish*
Can someone tell me why I can finish a 328-pages novel in 3 hours and&nbsp;
I'm taking 1 hour to read ONE chapter in the stupid ICT book??

Yesterday in the train back, I saw a bishounen who looked like one
of the characters in hanakimi. Very cute, but very young and he obviously
knew that he was cute, he kept checking out his own reflection. haha. boys.

So many other things are more interesting than what I'm doing now!!
Booo!

Ok, i gotta go back to reading ICT crime and punishment; Ethics in ICT Society;
ICT infrastructure &amp; policies and Globalisation &amp; ICT. Terribly fun and interesting, no?

Please let me get an S for this. *cross fingers and toes*"

Since my career is already mapped out for me, I was standing&nbsp;<br />against a pillar, waiting for them while reading my <i>Sign of Four</i>.<br /><br />Out of the corner of my eye, I saw this man approaching me. He came to ask me<br />whether I was a final year student, I told him yes but I'm not interested cos I am<br />already bonded to be a teacher. He did not give up, he pressed on, asking me<br />what i was majoring in, and so I told him Literature.<br /><br />And he told me, with a humsup smile on his face,&nbsp;<br /><b><font size=""3"">""oh! I major in finance and romance..""<br /></font></b><br /><font size=""2"">*faints*<br /></font><br />I laughed outright in his face but he was so thick-skinned he continued to<br />tell me that he is a branch manager of Great Eastern Life and asked if I wanted to<br />leave down my particulars with him for further talks and positions in his office which<br />he can guarantee for me blah blah blah..<br /><br />OMG! He is middle-aged, around mid-forties I think, slightly pudgy and balding.<br />hahahaha..<br /><br />To give him credit, I must had it to him to be a ble to contextualize his pick-up<br />line so aptly with the flow of the ""conversation"". Highly original.<br /><br /><br /><br />2) Now that I don't care so&nbsp;much about grades and get uber stressed out by school,<br />I feel so so much happier.&nbsp;I'm so slack I find it funny..<br />Though I don't necessarily finish reading my novels on time,<br />I do things at my own pace, learning Jap, eating horrible food in school,&nbsp;<br />hanging out with the Olympians, laughing and entertaining ourselves in the Coop.<br />I'm really enjoying my last semester in school.<br /><br />My tuition kid has moved from Tanah Merah to Pasir Panjang, he is now 10 mins from&nbsp;<br />school but 45 mins from home and I pay $20 extra of bus fare now. But somehow, I<br />find it less of a chore to go for tuition now cos it's so convenient. Maybe it's cos I'm&nbsp;<br />getting used to my tuition kid's antics now, I swear he treats me like his elder sister<br />or smth. He burps in my face and threatens to wipe his booger on me, just like<br />my brother. haha.<br /><br /><br />3) Baby got me a pretty pink bed! yeay! XD<br /><br />I'M A HAPPY GIRL :):)"

is to go for an operation to remove my sinus or whatever it is in my nose
that constantly gives me problems. I don't care if they grow back again,&nbsp;
i'll just remove it again. GAH!

My sinus condition&nbsp;has given&nbsp;me a swollen eye and now induced one of the
worst bouts of throat inflammation.

I woke up with my entire nose congested and breathing through my mouth
hurts my throat. My eyelids were&nbsp;also swollen and i had a pretty high fever.&nbsp;
Went to the doctor and spent $58 on medicines, the antibiotics are humongous,&nbsp;
i think they're the same&nbsp;one i took for my sinus induced eye infection the other time.

Was supposed to go out for tea and movie with the Olympians today and
in the end spent the afternoon sleeping and feeling feverish. I hope I'm well enough
to go watch the Singapore-Malaysia match tmr.

I think that despite all that has happened to me, I still am an idealistic person at heart.
I get bouts of depression and pessimism all the time but there are still things that I&nbsp;
hold dear, things that makes life worthwhile.

I've come so far short in so many things that I set out to do, I haven't done some stuffs&nbsp;
that I meant to do, I haven't lived up to my ideals.

But i guess none of us ever do.

I don't know where I came across this: ""Not failure but low aim is crime""
I think we must have ideals and try to live up to them even if we eventually never
quite succeed.

I failed but i guess i should just put it behind me and not carry it forward.
That's life. I'm still proud of what I did and I know it's a memory that I will cherish and
look back with fond memories.

I know I have so much to feel thankful for all the love care and concern.

I'm so thankful for friendship, it has really beautified my life.

The name of friendship is so often degraded to a kind of intimacy that has nothing of
real friendship in it.&nbsp;
Friends should only look for the best in each other and we should give each other&nbsp;
the best that is in us, don't you think? Only then would the friendship be beautiful.

Thank you my friends for letting me escape while i needed it.

Darling butt, thank you for your understanding my need to keep to myself, at least until you
hunted me down at home. heh.

Renee, Miche, Luke, thank you for your friendship, the happy times and&nbsp;offers of ambush. :)
I'm really happy for the two of you and miche, jia you!
My lovely daemon, thank you darling.. *muah* you know i love you!
You guys are the best thing to happen to me in NUS! And I'm really thankful :)

And of course my love, my friend, my confidante.
Thank you for letting me indulge in melancholy i only show to you.

I'm a lucky girl.
And I'm moving on to greater things, i hope :)"

"event","Back from a week long retreat in the comfort of my own home, free to do anything I want&nbsp;<br />without worrying about irritating relatives :)<br /><br />That aside, going back to Indonesia made me think a lot.<br /><br />Looking at how backward it is and&nbsp;how the people live made me think of all the readings<br />that I read for my thesis. Thinking about how a country, my country&nbsp;with such abundant&nbsp;<br />natural and&nbsp;human resources fail to progress is just depressing. It also made me admire<br />people like Pramoedya even more.<br /><br />I saw Indonesians who are lazy and corrupt, whose very appearance speaks of their laziness.<br />On the ferry ride back, the crew of the ferry had uncombed hair and wore crumpled shirts, and<br />once the ferry left the harbour, proceeded to the back of the ferry to smoke or sleep. I saw groups<br />of jobless people, whiling their time away, smoking and gambling. At the custom office, the officials<br />operate according to the system of ""uang kopi"", which is coffee money a.k.a bribes. It irritated me&nbsp;<br />to no end looking at them.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are very industrious people too. There's this makeshift stall near my home,<br />they only open at night and the food is delicious. On the first night I was there, they were closed.&nbsp;<br />The family lives near us, so my mum found out that two of the brothers got into a serious accident&nbsp;<br />and&nbsp;had to be hospitalised. I was very upset cos I thought that I would not be able to eat it as i'll&nbsp;<br />only be back for a week. But on the 4th night, they set up their stall and so we went. The two workers&nbsp;<br />still had stitches on their faces and arms, and were limping. Yet, the business continues, they are&nbsp;<br />still working to earn a living.<br />It was very heartening, and we went to eat there 3 nights in a row. <br /><br />People do work hard, but they can't earn much also, because there're so many taxes to be paid&nbsp;<br />and for the lower income groups, even 200 rupiahs (less than 10 cents)&nbsp;increase in price affects&nbsp;<br />them significantly. A taxi driver was telling us about the price of oil. A lot of the food vendors in Indonesia&nbsp;<br />rely on oil, not cooking oil, but the oil used to power their stoves. In the past, a 500ml bottle of oil costs&nbsp;<br />2000 Rp, but now the pricesare increased to 7000Rp. A lot of them have gone out of business cos they&nbsp;<br />can't afford it, many are turning to using wood to fuel their stoves. How primitive is that? 61 years of&nbsp;<br />independence, and people are still living in the slums. It makes me really really sad.&nbsp;<br />I don't know how Indonesia can progress like this, and yet I still feel really attached to the country.<br /><br />Ah well, enough of my musings.<br /><br />On a lighter note:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v639/mersmerise/meysmall.jpg"" /><br /><br />I got a haircut but the fringe is too short for my liking, can't wait for it to grow out! &gt;&lt;<br /><br />A new addition to my Kuma Kuma family:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v639/mersmerise/trtle.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v639/mersmerise/turtle.jpg"" /><br /><br />Ain't he sweet :)<br /><br />Went out today and saw one of the most beautiful Christmas tree this season:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v639/mersmerise/xmastree.jpg"" /><br /><br />Of course it helps that it's made of diamonds..

comforter till 12 pm today.

But at 8 a.m. I was woken up my brother's frantic search for 
his wallet. He was so sure he brought it home after his swim
at his friend's place last night. So i dragged myself out
of bed and helped him look around but to no avail.

Then something struck me. 

Yesterday Fir came over at night to watch V for Vendetta,
which by the way was one of the BEST show I've ever watched.
But that's besides the point, the point is when he came,
I had to remove the heavy planks from my bed downstairs. He 
came just in time so we brought it down together. Before we
went down, cos he was carrying a laptop bag and he put his 
handphone inside the bag to put inside my room.

The thing is, I distinctly remembered also that when he went
home, he was holding a wallet and a handphone in his hands.
I started laughing and laughing. My bro just looked upon me 
in pique, like excuse me, here I am panicking and my sis just 
suddenly start laughing like a mad woman. 

My dear boyfriend, who placed his handphone on my dressing 
table, must have brought my bro's wallet home with him, 
thinking it was his. And knowing him, he wouldn't have looked
inside it at all after he reached home.

So I called him and true enough, he took it by mistake cos
the wallet was also black like his.

My observational and sleuthing skills good right? 

Or maybe, I just know too well what a blur blob my 
dearest boyfriend is.

Hahahahahahahaha..

My bro and I had a really good laugh this morning, what a way
to start a day!

**************************************************************

On hindsight, i realised my tirade in the previous entry seems
like I was making a mountain out of a molehill. How childish is
it to blog about how angry you are abt beds?!

And those who know me should know that I am not given to
vulgarities. In fact I don't think my close friends, jess and tess 
who've known me for 10 years now, have heard me say the F word more
than 5 times before.

I kinda set record with this entry. haha.

I told zooey maybe I should go edit and censor my entry.
But she told me I shouldn't have to censor myself.

Well whatever, I was really really upset. So there."

"event","Woke up with a swollen, itchy burning red eye. 

I'm supposed to do intensive revising of my chapters today,
but i still can't summon up enough motivation to do it.

This sem has been a long tiring journey. I was looking back in my 
uni life, my entries about school are all about how busy I had been
during the semesters juggling tuition, deadlines, maintaining grades. 
I feel put out just reading them.

Is it worth it, I ask myself? Is this what I want?

Even if i get all Ds for my subjects,I will have no problems getting
a 2nd lower, why am I working so damn hard? Should I just stop working
so damn hard for everything, and just let myself cruise through?

I am not an extremely competitive person, but since young, when family 
members constantly compare you to other cousins, I have cultivated an
innate drive to over-achieve. Though my family is not as well-off, I'm
treated less civilly by others, I was determined to show them I could 
rise up above external limitations and do much better than the rest. 
The way I could do this was through my results. Despite these, I have
never gotten praise, instead people become more critical. When I got
into RJ, no one congratulated me, instead they criticised, ""she's gonna
become arrogant"". They have never stopped to think, what effect these
constant criticisms have on a developing psychology of a young girl, one
who was constantly insecure and in need of validation. I like to think
that they are just being sour grapes, but that doesn't make me feel any 
better. I developed an inferiority complex, scared to venture, worried 
about what people think of me, scared to under-achieve.

I don't understand how people can be so mean spirited. Is there joy to be
derived from being mean to others?

SIGH. I don't really know what is the point of writing all these. Maybe I'm
not making a point at all, like my thesis. Just needed to get it out, start
writing. I'm having a really bad bout of PMS, hurry up come already!"

"event","I am pregnant. Pardon the metaphor, but writing my thesis is like giving birth. I think about it every moment of the day, ideas just pop out randomly and i will be scrambling to jot it down on post-its. I was bathing when an inspiration struck and I was desperately chanting the keywords to myself in order to remember it after I finish bathing. I am obsessed. I constanly worry about a possible congenital defect in my progeny. I suffer from pre-natal blues, and highly possible post-natal blues too! (after submitting my thesis, i will continue fretting about it) Therefore, I have decided to keep track of my ""pregnancy"" right till the day I ""give birth""<br /><br /><strong><u>Voila! conception! [1st September]</u></strong><br /><br />Internalising the&nbsp;texts and secondary readings, I finally came up with a clear idea of what I want to focus on and eventually write a 12,000 words thesis about.&nbsp;<br />Typed out a structure and got the green lights to go ahead from my supervisor.<br />12 000 words seemed a lot initially, but when&nbsp;I broke it down into chapters, it looks pretty doable, 5 parts in all,average of 2,500 words.It's like doing 5 essays in one sem, manageable.. (I hope).<br /><br />Thesis title: (Un)masking Fiction: Postcoloniality in Pramoedya Ananta Toer's <em>The Buru Quartet</em><br /><br /><strong><u>Gestation: Start of 1st Trimester [6th September]<br /></u></strong><br />Typing out my introductory chapter now, 2000 words. It;s due on Friday. Mind is in a blank now, but i have been assured by my fellow suffering pregnant sister and brother that it is normal, they are experiencing the same thing. Hopefuly, it will start fleshing out soon, now that i already have the skeleton (structure).. see how appropriate is the pregnancy metaphor??<br /><br />P.s. I haven't been able to meet up or keep in touch with you but you're always in my thoughts, thanks for being so understanding and I miss you! We'll meet up during the hols ok?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BIG HUGGG*<br />"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Update"">I have been mulling over this since the fateful afternoon on 25th May 06. Exactly 3 weeks after the end of my last paper,&nbsp;<br />my results were released at 1500. After the whole wretched semester of labour, i.e. piles and piles of neverending readings,<br />book after book, tests after tests, essays after essays and finally exam after exam, revelation time... (thank you for indulging me in my melodrama)<br /><br />I was on standby since 1430, located the webpage, typed in my matriculation number and pin number, my mouse cursor over&nbsp;<br />the log-in tab, all prepared to click on it once my laptop clock registers 1500. Of course i put a paper over my laptop screen, I didn't<br />want to receive a rude shock (just in case). In case you haven't realised, I am extremely paranoid. Two days earlier, over dinner with<br />my lecturer, she told me and my friend that we needn't worry about one of the module, we were on the top 3 list. BUT, there were still&nbsp;<br />4 other modules to worry about, 2 of which were killers.<br /><br />Right, at 1455, I had a stomachache due to the tension and in the end i only got to check my results at 1512. -_-""<br />All my preparations were undue. [Fir came over to give me moral support..haha.. thanks baby.]&nbsp;<br /><br />Upon seeing my results, I couldn't describe what i felt at that moment. My CAP was 4.0. I screamed. It was a scream of joy, but at the same time, a scream of frustration. After slogging for 2 semesters, I managed to pull up my CAP to qualify for a place to do my Honours Thesis. With my CAP, I&nbsp;would graduate with a Second-upper Honours, provided i do not fall from grace. The NUS CAP system works in an extremely odious, diabolical way, such that it is effortless to drop 0.1 but ridiculously arduos to go up 0.01. I needed 2 semesters of hardwork&nbsp;<br />to pull my CAP up by 0.02. My CAP now, is right on the dot for 2nd-upper. I CANNOT drop, not even by 0.01. No one, in the whole faculty can do anything if i graduate with a 3.99 by the end of my 4th year. I would be awarded a 2nd-lower, 0.01 away from a 2nd-upper. NUS is CRUEL.<br /><br />With a CAP of 4, I can do a thesis. WHat was milling through my mind at this moment was, what if i churn out a 12,000 word thesis and my CAP drops, I will be still graduate with a 2nd-lower, is there a point? I hated my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />I worked so hard to improve my CAP, but I was disappointed at how it turned out to be kinda like a joke. To do or not to do? I only had 4 days to decide. I had to submit a thesis proposal by the 29th May. I had to decide, do i really want it bad enough? Should i take the risk, will my effort be wasted at the end of the day? Is it worth it, to&nbsp;have to continue to work so hard for 2 more semesters, knowing that there is a possibility that I might not get what&nbsp;I wanted?&nbsp;I was in such a dilemma.&nbsp;<br /><br />I talked to many people, thanks butt, my daemon, renee, luke and char for your advise, but at the end of the day, the decision still lies with me. For the next two days, I thought hard about it, thanks baby for allowing our conversation to be perpetually about my dilemma and listening patiently to my grouses even though your results were coming out 2 days later and you were equally worried about your results. I looked back on my life in NUS. I remembered telling myself of how i want to make the most out of my university life cos it was not easy getting there. I remembered telling myself, that i am in University to study, who cares if I don't have a happening life, who cares if i have to give tuition 6 days a week just to get by. All I want is to get good grades and do my mum proud. My first year of University was fraught with devastations, one after another, but i pulled through it, even more determined to to excel. Since then on, pulling up my grades were my main motivation and i worked towards my goal, as difficult as it was to proceed. I realized then, what i have been working for so far and now that i finally attained it, how can i back down to my fears and not go ahead? I foresee tough semesters ahead to keep afloat, but since when have my semesters been easy? As long as I am willling to work doubly hard, I will pull through right?&nbsp;<br /><br />Yeap, so I have decided to do a thesis and I will keep my CAP above 4. I know i can do it and i will have the support of loving friends and family&nbsp;when i get too stressed up. Most of all I want YOU to be proud, knowing I have not let you down, after all that you've done for me. I have never let you out of my mind and I know you're still watching over me.<br /><br />TADA!<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v639/mersmerise/CIMG3076.jpg"" /><br />The books I will be basing my thesis upon. :) Wish me luck! <br /><br /></div>
<br /><strong><u>6 weird facts about me:<br /><br /></u></strong>1) I have no surname, my daddy forgot to include it in my birthcert cos he witnessed my birth. His nerves were shaken up pretty badly i guess. Haha.<br /><br />2) I always sleep on my left side, I have sinus, I can breathe easier when i sleep this way.<br /><br />3) I have v small hands and feet for my height.<br /><br />4) I can't really tell my left from my right.<br /><br />5) I am very anal about colour coordination.<br /><br />6) I'm beginning to have cellulite on my calf. (like what the hell? i've never seen cellulite on calves! but i have!)<br />"

"event","One week more to my first paper.. exams will be from 21st to 26th.. I can't wait for everything to be over!


21st--> Complementary Medicine and Health

CA results: A+ for CT 1 & 2, A+ for project (I'm banking on this module to pull up my CAP.)

Progress: Had 2 midterms, so i basically just need to revise again and follow the study guidelines, Yvonne (jess's) told me that this module is very competitive, everbody does really well.. so do get an A I must do exceptionally well for the exam, which is 60% of the total.. 



22nd--> 19th Century Literature

CA results: 15/20 for midterms (15%), B+ for essay (10%) and the other 15% for presentation & participation.

Progress: I had a mid terms for this also, so pretty familiar with the first half of the course.. However, I haven't finished this disgustingly long novel, Middlemarch (800 freakin' pages long).. so.. oh well..



24th--> Introduction to film studies

CA results: A- for first essay (10%), A for second essay (20%), the other 20% for tutorial discussion.

Progress: QUite familiar with the film techniques etc. but I have not read the textbook at all since the beginning of the semester.. *gasp*

   --> 20th Century Literature

CA results: A- for midterms (15%) essay is 25% but i haven't got it back yet (keeping my fingers crossed)

Progress: Finished reading all the texts for this module (10 freakin books!) first half lectures pretty familiar.. but we had another lecturer for the second half of the semester and he's very difficult to understand.. 

And Yup! I have two papers on the same day! I'm so gonna be zombified..



26th--> Science Fiction and Fantasy

CA Results: 15.6/20 (20%) for mid terms.. B for essay (15%) :(

Progress: this is one of my favourite modules, so i finshed reading all the texts.. must read all the lecture notes.. My lecturer's notes are approximately 8000 words in length for each lecture.. haha


Current CAP: 3.99
I need to get get 4.0 and above to do an Honours Thesis.. so I must at least get 4.3 and above for this sem's CAP, and that will mean at least average A- in all my modules.. It seems like I have a really daunting task ahead.. sigh..

I've just finished filing all my notes into respective modules.. so thick! I want to take it easy but I'm also worried that I won't be able to finish studying also! exam jitters coming up..

On a separate note.. Total Book Count this sem: 25 books.. Thank goodness I took a film module this sem.. just watch films and read readings.. no books.. BUT i have to memorise ALL the characters' names for the exams! :x"

I have one more left, a shorter one and hopefully easier.

All 3 are due on Monday.

I have another one due on 7th November.

I have no life. no more joy left."

"event","On hindsight, my bout of bad luck happened the day before my eye swelled up.

On Wednesday night, I was craving for chocolate banana cake from Secret Recipe. I waited for him to break fast and we set off for siglap at 8. I was soooo craving for it, i was planning to eat at least 3 slices! haha! When we reached, there were only 2 miserable pieces left and they looked extremely unappetising.. Walking back to the bus stop, i passed by Gelare, Starbucks etc, but was too broke to go in for a substitute cake.. so we decided to go to simpang Bedok to eat chocolate waffles instead.

After taking the wrong bus, ending up walking a long way there, we were informed that the stall has closed down for good! aaaarghhhh! Last resort, we went to Burger King to eat Hershey's Sundae Pie (U can tell how i was craving for chocolate) and guess what? it was sold out!!! waaaa... such bad luck!

In the end, we ended up buying Cornettos from NTUC.. :( tough luck!"

"event","<P><BR>I'm down with an eye infection of the century. Not only is my eyelid swollen, my eye white looks like marsmallows, and my vision is blurred. I woke up this morning and i thought i was going blind. I was panicking like crazy! Luckily i live near the hospital and i rushed down to the A&amp;E with Fir (thanks baby).</P>
<P>My eye is reduced to half the original size, which wasn't very big in the first place. Waited for a long time in the A&amp;E, apparently my condition wasn't life threatening enough, but to me it was! I thought i was going lind and i thought i needed operation.. *sobs* When i finally got to see the doctor, she looked like a fresh graduate out of medical school and she didn't know what was wrong. Then she brought me to another doctor and later i was transferred to an eye specialist.</P>
<P>I had to wait even longer for the eye specialist. The eye specialist was very thorough and gentle with me. He doesn't look like a doctor, he looked more like a lean lifeguard.. hurhur.. anyway, he said that my eye infection is due to viral sinus infection.</P>
<P>Hence, I now look like quasimodo(a.k.a the hunchback of Notre dame, the dysney version), have a mountain of medicine to finish, eye drops to apply every hour and an essay due on thursday (i haven't finished reading the book and the reference books i borrowed from the library). BAD DAY. understatement of the year.</P>
<P>sorry to traumatise you with the pic. but this is how my eye look like. :( so ugly.</P>
<P><IMG height=188 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v639/mersmerise/SWOLLEN.jpg"" width=263>&nbsp;:(</P>
<P>the eyelid is swollen and my eyebrow is pushed up, so now not only is one eye swollen and smaller (paradox) than the other, one eyebrow is higher than the other ( The Rock-style).</P>

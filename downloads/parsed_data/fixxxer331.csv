"event","Woah. Almost a whole fucking year since i've been on this thing. I suppose I could blog a bit.



I've been doing alot of nothing. I do enjoy it, however, I do want a job to occupy the time I spend wasting money on things to inebriate myself. Also, making money is fucking awesome. My lease is also almost up... fuck. I still haven't found another place, and I got less than 2 months. I should get on that.... Also, in the time i've been away, I did a short stint as a lead vocalist for a local thrash metal band. It was pretty fuckin sweet, but its too bad the kids had the mentality of a 80's thrash metal band, and none of them, except the guitarist, is good enough to warrant that kind of operation. So I quit, which is alright, I got a few jobs in the meantime and stuff. 

Lamb of God is at the Myth April 30th. I'm probably going to that. It's going to be sweeeeeet....



Other than that kind of shit, I really got nothin else to say...

Hey ya'll. Thought i'd share something that happened to me yesterday morning:

So, here i am, driving down E. River Road, about to take the exit to 694 W. The light is red, and there is a line of cars in one lane, and none in the other. So, I accelerate to get ahead of all the cars before the merge. That worked perfectly, I passed all the cars and had the soon to be merged lane to myself. Unbekownst to me, a porsche comes screaming up behind my camaro, with no signs of slowing down. And I mean, it looked like this guy was going to ram me, hardcore.

So, I move over a twiddle bit so he has room (we are in a merged lane now) and he cuts me off and forces half of my car into the dirt median between the highway and the enterance ramp. I hit the curb, and the drivers side of the car just lifts into the air, and I am slammed down on the pavement, sliding toward the medain wall. I jack the steering wheel to the left, and next thing I know i'm spinning in circles all down the highway. And, at every turn, I get a glance of what seems to be my demise as cars and, most notably, semi trucks are honking and trying to avoid my chaotic spinning. I spin around countless times, and I stop facing the wrong direction on 694, looking at all the cars stopped and the people driving them looking at me in disbelief. My car didn't start immediatelly, but it did after a few tries, and I drove home imediatelly and... releived myself of the stress as best I could.

So! That was my story of yesterday..."

Shadows Fall was, by far, my favorite band who performed. Every Time I Die was the worst. They suck.

Good sound overall. 

Gwar puts on a fucking awesome show. Except this time they were way too fucking loud. Guy and I left because it was so crazingly loud. Ear plugs would have helped, but I don't see how anyone could have liked their sound, because of how loud it was. I couldn't understand a  thing. Though their stage performance was awesome. Very funny. Good show!

When as a SWAT team done any good? Fuck the SWAT team, it needs to be abolished. 

And this is sick: <u>When the second couple tried to help Mrs. Bernal, police pushed them to the floor, the victims said. The second woman, who is 4 months pregnant, ran outside and clung to a railing while her husband pleaded with police to take it easy on his pregnant wife.</u>

<u>The husband said an officer replied: ""I don't care.""</u>

Those cops don't deserve to have their jobs, and i would argue their right to live. I wish for only the worst for those cops.
<hr>


There is also this: 

<u>Amnesty International is warning that the Internet ""could change beyond all recognition"" because state-sponsored censorship has spread from a handful of countries to dozens of governments that apply mandated net filtering, and because companies such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo have remained complicit, according to a BBC story.

'""More and more governments are realising the utility of controlling what people see online and major internet companies, in an attempt to expand their markets, are colluding in these attempts,""' said Tim Hancock, Amnesty's campaign director.</u>

Censorship? Fuck government sanctioned censorship. Who are they keeping safe with censorship? Huh? Nobody. Because the internet, tv, movies, books or any of that shit can't hurt people. Responsibility needs to be put back in people, and parents if there is something they don't want their kids to see.  I'm tired of all this shit about people turning to ""mommy"" government to fix all their problems.

""Oh my god! I don't want to be in a bar where there is cigarette smoke!"" Shit! You can leave, bitch! You don't have a right to be there anyway.

""Jesus Christ! There is porn on the tv, the government needs to stop this so my children don't see it."" OR ""Oh no! There is porn on the internet! Myspace is responsible for kids being sexually abused (I've heard that one)!!""     No, you need to put a stop to it. If you have a TV, odds are that it has a remote, and if not, buttons on the fucking thing to where you can change the god damn channel. And if all else fails, turn the fucking thing off. Or block websites that you don't want you or your kids to go to. Besides, porn and or naked people won't hurt anyone. It's fucking natural. What, you want to tell kids not to look at themselves naked until they are 18? You're all fucking idiots. Grow up and be a parent.

Same goes for radio. Big fucking deal they hear a curse word on the radio, its a fucking word!! Change the station. Turn off the radio and or turn down the volume. The FCC doesn't need to exist and it does NOTHING good for the American public. Movie ratings need to go away too. That or movie theaters need to ball up and not give a shit about the regulations. So a 16 year old wants to see a R movie, WHO GIVES A SHIT!?

The ESRB needs to go away too. Bunch of bullshiiiiiiiit goin on.

Yeah?

I thought so too! Like, woah!!! I think its because of my job, makes me feel better and pretty much makes me a better person than you because i make more money. Wait... that's not true. I'm not a bastard. But!! I am excited to be making more money and getting more hours now that i did get promoted. 

Love life!

I feel so much older. And not because of my job, but because of recent events and experiences in the last few weeks. I feel like I am, perhaps, the coolest damn person on the planet. Well, of course I am.

Among other things, i realized how much religion can and does hurt and destroy our world, our friends and our family. Well, religion doesn't do shit, I guess. I blame stupid people who are close minded and turn away from anything that isn't what they think.

Fuck you.

But yeah, keeping on a happy note. I enjoy things alot more. A good job (money???) can produce and inspire great things. Even happiness. If you disagree, you're fooling yourself.

Because:

There comes a time where you need to say ""fuck you"" to everything an anyone that gets in the way of you getting what you want. There is nothing wrong with being selfish, nothing at all. Some people and or events just need to be said ""fuck you"" too. Makes things better. Life is shorter than you realize, and I think you need to do <i>whatever</i> it takes to make sure that YOU enjoy your stay. If that means helping people, or not, who gives a shit? Nobody knows whats right or wrong, we know what we are told and what we are shown.

Different sets of morals and believes make it impossible to tell who is wrong or who is right, not that it needs to happen. 

You try to tell me that you love life
Then you find another way to kill life
You try to tell me that you love life

I lost my job. Shit! 

My phone broke. Shit! But its ok, I got a new one. A better one. <a href=""http://www.haibane.info/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/samsung_m500.jpg"">That one!</a> And it was free.

The Green Mile might be my favorite movie. Shit! Well, besides Liar Liar. That movie is epic.

That's it for me, back to you Bob!

Thanks Bob! That's some damn fine reporting. Damn fine.

I hate school. I want it to end. But, good news is my first year is almost the fuck over, then only one more year. Excellent!

"event","Hmmmm I wonder what racism means...


1.a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race is superior and has the right to rule others.

2.a policy, system of government, etc., based upon or fostering such a doctrine; discrimination.

3.hatred or intolerance of another race or other races.
____________________________________


Hmmm! Well! There is the definition of racism. I would suggest you look up definitions of words before you fucking label people. 

And to all you people who think that I am a racist:

Go fuck yourselfs. I'm not a racist. I hate you all. To label someone as such is a terrible thing. And me? Come on. You people piss me off, and frankly, I want nothing to do with you. So all of you who think that I am a racist, and fuck off and stop talking to me.


You are the scum of this planet. Peices of shit, if you will. You are ruining this country, and friendships as well. But, if you think that way about me I guess I would have never thought of us as friends.
__________________________

And to label one as such? Do you have any idea what that does to a person? Do you!? Fuck no you don't, because you are all selfish pigs.

That's right. I said it. And that isnt directed to all of you, just those who think I am racist. If you want to send me an instant message trying to defend yourself, don't even bother. Because I hate you, and wish only the worst for you.


And I am blocking comments because like that last post with 20 some comments, I got bored and lazy and didnt want to read all of them and do that much replying. Its much more efficient to do it over instant messenger. 

And if you don't like it, then stop reading my livejournal, because odds are its not going to change.

Bitches.

Oh, and I do have to say that I like those lj posts you post just about me and my livejournal posts. :)"

I hate my job.


In other news: My job!!!

I said the most terrible comment today, and I didn't do it on purpose. It was like a reflex, and thank god the fellow didnt hear me.


Here is the story: 

So me and this fellow Kingsley (A black fellow) were buildin us some air conditioners, and he picks up a power cord on the floor, and he says ""Man, this kinda looks like a whip."" And me, being the quick-witted fellow that I am, I instantly say ""Yeah, you'd know, right?"" NOW DON'T FREAK OUT FRIENDS!!! I immediatly felt like ""What the fuck did I just say...!?"" But thank god he said ""Huh?"" and I quickly said ""Yeah, it does.""

Dodged a bullet there. I don't know what the fuck that was about. But, no harm done. <a href=""www.redbarradio.com"">Probably got it from here</a>

And, I met this other dude there too, but I forgot his name. But he was reading the bible at work. What the fuck? And we got to talking about religion. Fun times. I almost laughed because of how blindly he follows that shit. Its pathetic, in my opinion.



Anyway, I'm bored.


BOOYAH!!!"

Maybe a little too well
Finger on the trigger, loaded bullet
He hit the stage so full of rage
And let the whole world know it
Six feet away, they heard him say
""Oh God, don't let him pull it""

Please God, don't let him pull it
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched you do it

How could you take his life away?
(What made you think u had the right?)
How could you be so full of hate?
(To take away somebody's life)
And when I heard you let him die
And made the world all wonder why
I sat at home and on my own,
I cried alone

And scratched your name
On the side of a bullet

And in the wake of his mistake
So many lives are broken
Gone forever from a loaded bullet
And no excuse that you could use
Could pull somebody through it
And to this day so many say

Let me tell you something. You mother fucking faggots.


Get some balls. Right the fuck now. Grow up. So he called you nappy headed ho's. So what. Be offended, that's fine. But that should be the end. Demand an apology? Go fuck yaself. You're not hurt, he didnt hurt anyone. Protests? You weak minded fools. 

When people call me names, do I get offended? No! I change the channel. I walk away. I tell them to fuck off. Or if they are stupid, I will laugh at them. Because I am an adult. I deal with name calling, because I learned how to in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!!!

Ugh.


You people disgust me for DEMANDING an appology. DEMANDING him being fired. DEMANDING protests and haveing those two fucks get involved (Sharpton and Jackson).

I need change. Now. Because I'm fucking lost with everything. I wish I could throw it all away and start over. Honestly. Fuck this shit, dudes. I don't want to deal with this. Anymore. Gosh what I would give just to go back, maybe 13 or so years, that would be awesome. Before all this bullshit and drama. (though things arent all bad, and if you read this, you know what I mean. Hat.) I would give it all away. I have nothing to lose, ya know? All of it. I'd give it all up just to have a second try. 

But yeah. You have no idea. Could be worse I guess, I could be... oh wait. HA!

No appeal on the docket today
Just my own sin
The walls are cold and pale
The cage made of steel
Screams fill the room
Alone I drop and kneel
Silence now the sound
My breath the only motion around
Demons cluttering around
My face showing no emotion
Shackled by my sentence
Expecting no return
Here there is no penance
My skin begins to burn

(And I said oh) So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said oh) We're all held captive
Out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in one

I hear a thunder in the distance
See a vision of a cross
I feel the pain that was given
On that sad day of loss
A lion roars in the darkness
Only he holds the key
A light to free me from my burden
And grant me life eternally

Should have been dead
On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time

(And I said oh) So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said oh) We're all held captive
Out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in one

[Guitar break]

I cry out to God
Seeking only his decision
Gabriel stands and confirms
I've created my own prison
I cry out to God
Seeking only his decision
Gabriel stands and confirms
I've created my own prison

(And I said oh) So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said oh) We're all held captive
Out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in one

"event","<center>With the start of one thing, I see the end to many others. I feel that... I have come accros things much later than I should have, or at least later than everyone else. Things that are new to me, there seem to be other people that I know that are much more knowlegable about. What took so long? What was my error? What good is knowing everying if you don't act when it counts? Many things float in my thoughts recently. As I lay awake in my bed I think about my life, and strange enough (or not) these things came to mind first to describe myself:

I am a dead battery. My usefulness is spent, I have nothing left? Am I simply to be thrown away? Or am I one of those cool rechargable ones?
I have reached my experation date. Every moment I grow more and more stale...

It would seem (to me) that I have reached my peak. I would agrue that it happend a couple years ago, but only now is it starting to sink in. I see no future. I see nothing. I remember back when I was in middle school I never thought I would make it High School because it seemed that I would have terminated existence then. But I didnt. When I started High School, I never, ever thought I would make it to college because it seemed that I would have terminated existence before then. I didnt. And here I am. But, the urge seems to be more and more intense, and it seems like I am given the tools to do so every day, all I have to do is make a choice. And (of course) I have. Why I keep making the same choice (mistake?) over and over I do not know. Well, actually I do, but if I said so you would probably call me crazy (haha!).

I have obtained a greater love for music it would seem as well. Ever since I got my acoustic guitar for christmas, I play all the time. I seem to be turning away from my heavy metal roots. I don't know how to feel about that... 

Is the truth selfish? I don't know. I think it is exactly that. The truth. It cannot be changed and it cannot be manufactured. I know what I said was true, but the reaction was not one I was expecting. I feel that I ruined someones life by telling them the truth.

I just wish... I guess what I want to say is, I wish I wasn't me. I wish I could transform into something else, because I hate what I am and what I am turning into. If the current situations were presented to me in a ""what if"" sense three years ago, I would have said that these things would never come to pass. I would repsect the friendship that I have with people so much more than I do now... though I don't know why I do not. I wish I was not as much as an asshole as I am, and I wish I cared more than I do. I know these might seem like simple rants, but I dont know <i>why</i> cant change that. I feel terrible for the stupid and selfish things I have done to my friends. I feel terrible for not taking proper caution when I should have, to announce my presence when such a thing is necessary.

And most of all, I am sorry for being dishonest. I told you I would do one thing when you returned, and I didnt follow through. I told you many things... I made promises that I didnt keep. I don't measure up... at all. The song Die Dead Enough just came to my head. (if you havent heard it, its by Megadeth, and its a good song... you should chek it out.) I feel that the lyrics of that song are me.

I know that this may sound like bullshit to some of you. That I am just looking for attention. But that isnt true. I guess I am just looking for approval...</center>

oh the bleeding of me</i>"

Maybe.

So!  How is everyone?? Glad to hear it! Yeah? Bitch about things you have more control over than you think, I can't help you. 

I forgot what the fuck I was talking about... This class confuses the shit out of me!
This all just seems so pointless now... even though I am going to post it anyway :).

gosh this was pointless...

I keep hearing people say that you hate me, but when I ask you, you say no.
What the fuck? I want the TRUTH!!

I might get my old job back, which would be the-shit. (does anyone remember Project-Ego for xbox a while back?)

I want your input: What do you think of me? If you give a positive answer, dont bother explaining. But if you have a negative answer, I want to know why you think that way.
I see myself as being my own. Being one from another. But I see that changing. I see things that once I would do not happening because of some strange type of consideration. I see that about to end. I see alot of things about to end... but is one of them me? Probably not. But time will tell.

"event","The State of the Union: A Libertarian Response
Submitted by admin on Wed, 01/24/2007 - 03:30.

My fellow Americans,

Earlier this evening, America listened as President George W. Bush addressed a joint session of Congress, fulfilling his Constitutional duty to report annually to Congress on ""the state of the union."" Shortly thereafter, Virginia Senator Jim Webb delivered the Democratic Party's response to his report.

I am not privileged to address you tonight over broadcast televison or radio; my party's opinions are considered unworthy of coverage by the ""mainstream media."" A response, however, is required, and I accept the responsibility for making it as an American, a presidential candidate, and hopefully a worthy, although not official, representative of my party.

The union, President Bush tells us, is strong. And he may be right. What he does not admit is that the union is weaker now than when he took office.

As evidence for his claim of national strength, he cites an economy which thrives in spite of, not because of, the ministrations of his government ... and proposes additional ""help"" of the type that weakens rather than strengthens it.

As proof of the bright future before us and the care which we take to leave our children a better world, he points to his ""No Child Left Behind Act"" -- an act which props up a disintegrating public education system with more of the federal interference that, until only a few short years ago, his party had pledged to eliminate at the first opportunity.

Addressing himself to the question of national defense, he defends to the very last his failed experiments in foreign military adventurism which have stretched America's armed forces to the breaking point, alienated our friends, empowered our enemies, and left us less, not more, secure against attack or invasion.

Turning to issues of energy independence and environmental sanity, he recommends more subsidies and more regulation, rather than smaller government and more innovation.

Like President Bush, I believe that the union is strong. Unlike President Bush, who attributes that strength to nebulous, undefined but government-enforced ""courage, kindness and self-sacrifice,"" I and my fellow Libertarians understand what really makes America strong.

We understand that every dollar in taxes taken out of your paycheck makes America weaker, and that every dollar left in your pocket makes America stronger.

We understand that one-size-fits-all federal programs -- even Republican programs -- for public education make America weaker, and that real parental control and real individual choice in education make America stronger.

We understand that ""bring'em on"" and ""mission accomplished"" and ""surge"" make America weaker, and that a foreign policy based on ""friendship and commerce with all nations, entangling alliances with none"" makes America stronger.

We understand that immigration has always made America stronger, and that ""temporary guest worker"" programs, fences and border militarization are poor substitutes for a truly open society in which peaceful people enjoy freedom to travel and to trade.

We understand that corporate welfare makes America weaker, even when it's disguised as a tax cut ""for health insurance,"" and that getting government out of health care makes America stronger, more free -- and more healthy.

We understand that government subsidies to Big Oil and Big Agriculture make America weaker, that unsubsidized competition makes America stronger -- and that only the innovation fostered by a truly free market will allow us to meet the challenges of pollution, climate change and future fossil fuel scarcity.

The union is strong -- not because of the efforts George W. Bush and his fellow politicians, but in spite of them. And in their clutches, America can only continue to become weaker ... because the strength of our union, my fellow Americans, is freedom.

The notion that government exists only for the purpose of securing our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, bequeathed us by our nation's founders, is the foundation upon which every worthwhile American accomplishment rests. The Bush adminstration, the Congress, and their predecessors in the White House and on Capitol Hill, have gone at that foundation with a sledgehammer.

The cracks they've produced in that foundation are visible all around us. The Patriot Act. The Military Commissions Act. Warrantless searches and wiretaps. No-knock raids. Detention without charge, counsel or trial. As a nation, we now imprison more of our own than any other. One in thirty of us are trapped in a ""justice"" system that has long since ceased to represent justice. The rest of us are subject to reams of arbitrary and capricious edicts concerning what we may say, how we may worship, which political candidates we may support (and how much we do so financially), what arms we may carry in our own defense, what medicines we may use, even whether or not we can play cards on the Internet.

America as we know it -- everything in it worthy of our devotion and allegiance -- stands at the edge of cliff, below which the darkness of totalitarianism awaits. Whether or not our union is strong enough to step backward from the precipice is a question only time will answer.

Over the next two years, I'll watch with you as the new Democratic Congress wrestles with the problem of restoring freedoms that a corrupt and lawless administration has robbed us of. If history is any guide, the Democrats will choose instead to go to work with their own sledgehammers.

In the meantime, I urge you to join with me in support of America's last, best hope for a better tomorrow: The Libertarian Party. Even as we speak, hundreds of Libertarians toil in elected and appointed office or as volunteer party activists, working to protect your freedom. With your help, we can elect thousands of new local officials, hundreds of state legislators, dozens of US Representatives and Senators and, yes, a President, who understand what makes America strong and are prepared to act on that understanding."

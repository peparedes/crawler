"event","What&nbsp;a beautiful afternoon!&nbsp; I wish I could duck out of work early today.&nbsp; Soooo much to do this weekend.&nbsp; I haven't started any of my Christmas shopping yet.&nbsp; Hopefully I have some time this weekend.&nbsp; Saturday we're heading out to the hammer for the annual pot-luck dinner at Jesse &amp; Taylor's. Yummm...I can't wait!&nbsp; Hopefully the weather doesn't get too bad - I heard that we're supposed to get like 25cm of snow&nbsp;on Sunday.&nbsp; I hate traveling in bad weather.

I went to see Dirty Dancing with Adam's mom last night.&nbsp; OMG! what an awful show!&nbsp;&nbsp;The show&nbsp;was so bad it was actually &nbsp;funny.&nbsp; People were laughing all throughout the show...at parts that aren't meant to be funny!&nbsp;""Nobody puts Baby in a corner!"" HAHAHAHAHA...I almost peed my pants laughing at that one!&nbsp;Regardless of how bad the show was, we still had a great time.&nbsp; I like spending time with my future mother-in-law...especially when it's just the two of us.&nbsp; Drinks at the bar after the show were the best .&nbsp; She is sooo funny!

I have to rent a car for over the holiday's and all the rental places around my apartment claim that they are sold out of vehicles for that time.&nbsp; I've only tried booking online though.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I'm hoping that if I actually&nbsp; go in, they can help me out.&nbsp; How can they be sold out?&nbsp; I would think they could transfer a car from another location to accommodate me???&nbsp; Fingers crossed I can rent somewhere close to my place.&nbsp; I really don't want to have to take the TTC arcoss the city just to pick up a car.&nbsp; Why can't things just be easy????

"event","&nbsp;Just when I think things are going well and everyone is happy, a certain someone I will refer to as&nbsp;""S"", comes along and fucks everything up.&nbsp; I'm so angry today. &nbsp;I'm having trouble working.&nbsp; People are annoying me with the smallest things.&nbsp; I'm letting things bother me that I&nbsp;normally could care less about.&nbsp; I&nbsp;really wish I could&nbsp;tell ""S"" how I feel but I'm&nbsp;forced to keep&nbsp;to myself and it's driving me NUTS!!!!!

"event","<p>Well, these last 2 weeks have certainly been painful...literally.&nbsp; I had my wisdom teeth pulled 2 weeks ago and I'm still feeling the pain.&nbsp; Long story short, I had a few complications with the extractions and then wound up with dry socket.&nbsp; I'm still being treated for the dry socket, but I'm happy to report that I'm on my way to recovery.&nbsp; Not being able to sleep or eat for that length of time really kicks your ass!&nbsp; I can't wait until this is all over and I can go out for dinner and eat whatever I want!<br /><br />I'm hoping this week goes by quickly.&nbsp; Friday night is the Sons Of Butcher show at The Casbah, followed by a costume/keg party at Lindsay's bf's place.&nbsp; Adam is opening ip for SOB and he's already got his costume - he's being Lemmy from Motorhead!&nbsp; I still have no idea what I'm going to be.&nbsp; I do this every year - I leave getting a costume until the last minute.&nbsp; Any suggestions???</p>"

"event","<p>I can't believe September is almost over!&nbsp; I get to look forward to having a week off after Thanksgiving, but then again, I'm dreading having my wisdom teeth pulled.&nbsp; Yeah, that's exactly how I wanted to spend my vacation!&nbsp; I guess it's better I do it now before I get any older.&nbsp; Apparently, I'm old to be getting my wisdom teeth pulled.&nbsp; The dentist told me that most people get them pulled in their late teens, early twenties.&nbsp; I thought that was kinda weird, it's not&nbsp;like I'm old!?!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Adam and I had a pretty&nbsp;fun weekend....pretty action packed for us these days! ;)&nbsp; Ditch played the Indie club at the Edge on Saturday, so a bunch of us went downtown together to check them out.&nbsp; The show was really good for that tiny little studio.&nbsp; The vocals were a bit quiet but the band was tight and they played hard!&nbsp; After the show a bunch of us came back to our place for UFC.&nbsp; We were even treated to some mushroom karaoke, compliments of Shawn!&nbsp; Adam and I were both pretty spent all day Sunday, so we abandoned all plans and stuck to the couch all day.&nbsp; Wasting the day almost made it feel like a one day weekend though.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Today was a painful Monday.&nbsp; Started my day off with an argument with a &nbsp;TTC collector.&nbsp; Then, the subway was roasting hot and stopping for a couple minutes in between each stop.&nbsp; Of course I'm standing beside the fat sweaty guy who's soaked his shirt in sweat.&nbsp; Nice!&nbsp; I felt like ass all morning and finally this afternoon, the crusty bitch, Marie, freaks out on me and a co-worker for talking too loudly ( we were having a normal conversation).&nbsp; &nbsp; One day down, four to go...</p>"

"event","&nbsp;OK, so I lied in that last post...I'm a little late.

Considering the chaos I'm anticipating within the next few weeks, I'm actually in a very good mood today.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Had a fairly decent weekend.&nbsp; Friday, I was out of the office to&nbsp;present fall buys&nbsp;to a client.&nbsp; Luckily, the client was really busy and didn't have time for 100 questions afterward, so I got to start my weekend early.&nbsp; Home by 3pm on a Friday is always good!&nbsp;&nbsp;

Adam had to work Saturday so I&nbsp;did some cleaning, ran errands and made it over to Indigo for a couple of hours while he was at work.&nbsp; I picked up 2 new books: Choke (Chuck Palahniuk) and Lamb (Christopher Moore).&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know which one I'll read first&nbsp;???&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam didn't get&nbsp;in until after 11pm, but we had a really nice&nbsp;dinner together when he got home.&nbsp; Followed dinner up with a few drinks and a joint before crashing infront of the TV.&nbsp;

Sunday we got to sleep in.&nbsp; And by sleeping in, I mean past 9am.&nbsp; I think it was almost 10:30am when we got up - which is really late for us these days.&nbsp; We had a huge list of things to do but we said fuck it and decided to go shopping instead!&nbsp; We found this new smoke shop downtown.&nbsp; I think it was called Tobac, or something.&nbsp; They had a good selection and their prices are way better than Friendly Stranger.&nbsp; So, we bought a hookah.&nbsp; I've wanted one for ages now.&nbsp;&nbsp;We used&nbsp;the hookah&nbsp;for at least 2 hours last night. Mmmm!&nbsp; I haven't tried smoking weed in it yet...maybe next weekend at the UFC party.

Big TV week ahead....

Big Brother 8 Finale on Tuesday - Go Dick!!!&nbsp;or Daniele!!!
Last&nbsp;female Inferno on R.W.R.R. Challenge:Inferno 3 on Tuesday too!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody call me on Tuesday! ;p&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm thinking I'll post my entries as public now...I don't know why I ever used to post friends only anyways.
'Till next time...take er easy!"

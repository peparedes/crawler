"event","good afternoon fellow livejournal-ers. i once again have gotten up and ready and out of the house in time for class, and just didnt go. when the traffic on storrow suddenly stopped, i told kit to get off at copley. oh well. so yea. here i am. working later, but we totally close at nine tonight, and that is a-ok with me. 

in other news...
i have officially crossed the border into crossword land. i bought a crossword puzzle book and i havent been able to put it down since. kit and i just stay up all night watching court tv and doing stupid crosswords. hopefully this is improving my brain activity, rather than further killing whatever is leftover from the weed. i dont know. i'm shutting up now.

and for no particular reason, i think my livejournal is gonna be friends only from now on. no need to ask why, cuz there really isnt a reason. i just feel like it."

1. dr. pepper doesnt taste good when it splashes into your eye, who knew?

2. the crepe burners' voltage is enough to kill everything in the restaurant that you need, yet, not strong enough to touch sam - hes invincible.

3. little car has 18+ lives

4. i am the master of feng shui.

i think thats all i can think of right now, if i think of any more i'll be sure to update some more. 

as for now, i must create happiness in my girlfriend's life... she has been having the worst luck lately :("

tonight kit is taking me on date #1 to the middle east for falafel and newcastle. its pretty ridiculous that i've been hangin out with her for this long and we havent even been out on a proper date yet. i think nutmeg is finally starting to love her though... i lurve my little princess kitty.

so yes. she comes in every sunday and orders $80 worth of food from us... why? couldnt tell you because crepes make me puke... but what really really fuckin irks me is that SHE NEVER TIPS US!!! isnt that illegal? we even went to walgreen's for bottled water because we ran out and she ordered four. she comes in and signs her little credit card receipt without a dime for tip and not even a penny into our tip jar.

"event","school started today.

sigh.

first i went to gay and lesbian studies. we've got a fun little huddle of collette, courtney and vietnam in the corner which i'm sure will provide much entertainment throughout the semester. i think thats one class i'll make an effort to get to. jk. i need to get my act together this semester.

after class, collette and i crashed the lunch party that is the donahue caf. we turkey club/grilled cheesed it up, and then kit picked me up for some afternoon recreation. she dropped me back off at four for my war, terror and the media class...

first of all... let me just say that going 12-15 students strong, this class is going to get into the nitty gritty, and i cant fuckin wait. second of all, the professor teaching the course is a special visitng professor at suffolk for one semester. she has never taught in the states before, and she is from israel, where she was a professor there. i feel as though there is gonna be crazy amounts of learning going on very soon. 

so yea, after that, kit and i went to the grocery store so i could get some stuff to make dinner with for sarah and clinty who have been sick recently. i made a delish chicken and veggie soup with all sorts of fresh vegetables and it was so tasty. i like soup so much more when its homemade. 

on that note... i must try and get some rest before i have school again. the rest of my classes are buddhism, the history of modern philosophy, and the business of media. word. i'm out."

"event","i had to backtrack and reread a bit before i knew where to start on this entry, since yknow, i've been such an asshole at updating lately. lets jump right in with new years, shall we? ...

sarah, clint and i hosted a small gathering here for new year's, and it officially won as the shortest and cleanest party of all time.  everyone was in by 11:30, and out by 12:15... whats with that people?! is slumma'ville too much for ya? just kidding... but seriously, wtf? it was definitely fun though, peeps were wicked fucked up... p.s. i still have everyone's lovely artwork that was created in the smoking lounge. its quite amusing. thanks to everyone who came though, it was good to see all the peeps in the same place once again... and now i'm rambling cuz i'm stoned. next subject...

crepes crepes crepes. they just cant get enough!

inbetween snowstorms and working, i've been getting to know a lovely little lesbian named kit, and we have an awful lot in common, its unbelievable really. she likes every single frickin artist that i like... hardly any of my friends like the weird shit that i do. and she must be magic because she lives in boston, allston, brighton and brookline all at the same time.

in less fabulous news, the average time i spend waiting in the freezing cold for the bus has now reached a remarkable, 45 minutes! in homage to the warmest jacket from the gap that i wear while waiting for the bus, i wrote this poem:

oh, warmest jacket,
i love to squeeze you tight.
you keep me nice and toasty,
morning, noon and night.

you give me support,
when the bus is nowhere around.
the fleece in your pockets,
are like no gloves i've found.

you know i hate the bus,
and how fuckin long i have to wait.
so thanks for keepin' me alive,
until i can smoke and become sedate.

word."

christmas was as expected... a nightmare. i was supposed to come back today, but i left a day early because i was worried about nutmeg, and i really needed to get away from my father. he just gets more and more drunk every time i see him. i got some decent stuff though. since i got the new computer, i didnt get too much to open, but a favorite is obviously the entire series of absolutely fabulous on dvd. hell yes. 

since i've been back, i've braved a blizzard, watched ""maria full of grace"", mopped the kitchen floor, hung out with bobby, nick, collette and courtney. i go back to crepes tomorrow... my dad is forcing me to go to a doctor though, and he really wants me to quit my job, cuz i think my wrist problems are developing in my other hand too... which is why i should end this entry and stop all this typing nonsense.

okay so i'm actually disabled with carpal tunnel syndrome due to the production of too many crepes and smoothies, so i'm in too much pain to keep typing. on a lighter note, as of friday, nutmeg will no longer be a horny little kitty."

"event","so... this morning i realized why i dont usually go to class on tuesday and thursday mornings... its so effing boring i cant even deal with it. thank god for turkey clubs. i dont know what ever possessed me to take an english class for an elective, but next semester's schedule is looking promising. 

this week feels like insanity. i have a 15 page paper due friday that i've barely cracked research on. granted, it is all about the L word, but that involves me actually watching numerous episodes. i plan on starting that tonight, but lets hope i can actually write something that will make sense. 

after that, i leave for south carolina friday evening. it'll definitely be nice to get away from here, even though its only for a couple of days... but i cant wait to see my wifey. and i cant wait to finally see where she lives... after all these years. perhaps i'll even get to see kelly-o. 

so... right now i'm killing time before my drugs and society class. we're starting a unit on heroine and opiates. good times :) too bad i was stoned and missed the class that was on marijuana. dammit!

"event","so much has happened in the past week. but the one thing that supersedes the rest is more good than bad. nick hired a girl named jenn at the creperie, and she stopped over the other night to see my apartment, thinking that maybe she would want to move in when the time comes. as we were talking, childhood camp stories came up, and it turns out we grew up going to the same tiny ass jesus camp in upstate new york. so... not only did we not know each other at all, but we spent every summer together, and ended up going to the same college and working at the same restaurant. how in the hell? it would of course get even weirder if we ended up living together! crazy shit.

lets see... yesterday was sarah's birthday. i baked her a cake and bought her balloons that said ""happy fuckin birthday"" on them. her mom bought her both of the kill bill movies, so nick came over and we watched both. i frankly, was not as impressed as i thought i was supposed to be. maybe i'm just not into action movies enough, or maybe i dont understand quentin tarantino, though i've liked his other stuff... whatever. but i do like uma thurman...  now i'm just rambling.

"event","hello hello livejournal-ers! sorry its been so long... but i'm a busy girl. guess theres not enough of me to go around, eh? 

general updates:
-i still work at the creperie
-nutmeg is cuter than ever
-school stinks
-i'm going to south carolina next month!

today was quite the productive and enjoyable day. sarah and i had many activities to keep ourselves busy, or, rather, there were plenty of activities to keep me busy while i got sarah to join in. hehe. i'm finding that on my days off, i cant sit still, and i need to be doing things. but i did my fair share of relaxing as well. today went as following:
-got up and watched the breakfast club with sarah
-walked to star market and got a variety of groceries to make dinner. amongst these was a pumpkin (more to come on that later)
-walked home, made our personal size frozen pizzas from the california pizza kitchen, and they were incredibly delicious. holy crap.
-sarah and i then proceeded to carve the pumpkin. we managed to perfect the art of carving a marijuana leaf into the side of it after completely cleaning out the inside of its remnants. overall, a standup job if i do say so myself.
-the smokage of copious amounts of weed ensued
-couple hours later we started dinner in preparation for the game
-on the menu: parmesian crusted chicken with chopped tomatoes and fresh basil. roasted potatoes with peppers and onions on the side. girly drink of the week: strawberry daquiris
-bobby and nik arrived, we feasted 
-watched the red sox
-ordered a bookshelf online
-semi-cleaned up the kitchen. 

WHEW!

on that note. good.night."

seriously though, guys, does anyone need a job? does someone you know need a job? does someone want to work for me tonight? cuz i really dont feel like it. worth a shot.

i'm starting to get better at pulling myself out of bed in the morning. i've actually been hearing my alarm clock now instead of just turning it off whilst asleep. i'm also starting to keep track of how many cigarettes i smoke in a day so i can start to effectively cut back and hopefully i can eventually quit. i need to start making myself more healthy and getting my ass to class everyday. midterms start this week... you know what that means - semester is half over. sweet!

theres not much exciting to report except for wifey comin to visit me this weekend. its a long overdue, much needed visit. i'm hoping that this weekend will help me to think more realistically about moving to SC to be with her after i graduate. big changes. 

school is going alright... same old bullshit, different year. i'm ready to be done, even though i'm not at all.

ginger passed away. its so weird. had her since i was in second grade. she had a tumor in her sinuses that spread to her neck... no one wanted to see her suffer. i hope shes frolicking somewhere better than this crazy place. at least she'll never have to deal with the fireworks on the fourth of july anymore... she hated those. poor monkey.

aunt laurel wants to hire me at her jazz booking agency as an intern. i dont know if i can hack it financially... its unpaid. i hope i can figure something out though, because i think that would be really fun.

wanna hear some other great fantastic news? our whole living room smells like mildew. the good news is... we got our air conditioner put in. the bad news is... its in sideways to fit into the window, therefore causing it to leak onto the floor soaking the carpet with freon/water. ac leaking water onto carpet = smelly smelly mess.

so where have i been you ask? well, when i'm on hiatus from livejournal land, you can be sure i'm either at the creperie, my apartment, or bobby's house. thats basically how the game is played these days. nik and i have become the creperie's puppets. every day is chock full of excitement like dealing with very mean customers and endless smoothies and dining in orders... and french people who seem to have come all the way from france just to tell us how our crepes are nothing like they are in france. i feel as though this job will slowly drive me mad.

on a lighter note, alicia and i have been finding many intriguing potential apartments for september. now its just a matter of picking one out, and making sure that alicia doesnt have to go back to florida. wooord.

i need to write out a timeline of the events taking place over the rest of this summer so i can figure out the dates i need off of work and i fo'sheezy need to hit up stamhood sometime soon or i'm gonna hear it from the fam. hopefully the husband will be visiting as well... lord knows i'll need some time off for that. 

i saw anchorman tonight with nik and sean. it was definitely on the cheesy side, but it had me slapping my knee a few times. amazingly enough, my anchorwoman name was used in the movie, tits mcgee. holy coincidence. p.s. christina applegate is one hott mama. aye.

"event","i need to get back into livejournal mode, fo'sheezy. alicia and i just got back from somerville. we looked at an apartment that was gorgeous! there were just a few things to worry about... not to mention the fact that to get there we had to walk a bike path, some train tracks, across a bridge, and through the woods. they had the cutest dogs named dobie and dixie. SO CUTE! but they had like 8 porches, a back yard and two floors... the people seemed cool, but theyre all in their late 20's... not an issue for us, but probably for them... so we're gonna keep looking.

on another note, i might be getting a kitten! she sounds so cute i could puke. i know what you're thinking...i'm stupid and am not ready for a cat, but thinking about it made me realize that there isnt much else to my life besides work and school, so its not like i dont have time to take care of a cat. i need some kitten love! 

jess has gone back to england... i miss her ever so. i hope that she comes back soon. i had so much fun with her while she was here... 

time to watch the gerbils chew up toilet paper. :)"

"event","today was amazing. i went to sex class where i got my test back and received a 91! this is after the other day when i got a 94 on my comm theory test! i'm so smart. anyway... we got out early after looking at nasty std pictures, and i hung out with josh before bobby came to pick me up. we went back to brighton to take some rips, and then i was off to work. (this is where the nice things come in)...

i walked into the creperie and nik immediately directed me towards the drink fridge. WE NOW SELL DR. PEPPER! AND CHUCK DID IT FOR ME! praise jesus. that was enough to make the rest of my day wonderful, how sad is that? but true. and here i am. still happy. ahhhh... its the little things in life, isnt it?"

"event","my brother called me today and asked me, ""so, how was your birthday yesterday?"" fuck that shit! my birthday isnt till the 17th! what an awesome brother. this happens every year... its leading me to believe that my brother is under the impression that if he calls within the first few days of june and gets it out of the way, then he's in the clear. no sir. incorrect. if he doesnt make it to the shindig, there will be words. 

nik got a new piece. it is ultra cute! turtle power!! bong-ification. thank goodness, that brought me out of the crappy work mood. jess and i woke up at 6:30 this morning to open the store at 8, and i barely made it to 4pm. forget going to class even, i made it onto campus, met up with josh, and then just went home. i could barely stand up anymore. i've been quite the sleep-deprived liz lately... not that i cant sleep, just that i dont. 

on that note, i'm gonna crash. my bed has never looked so comfortable."

"event","jess is finally here to stay until she leaves for england! what fun! me, jess, nik and reba just finished watching scary movie 3, it was pretty funny, but not as funny as i had hoped. anyway...

exciting news: reba and i are almost definitely going to be cat sitting for a lovely cat named Blake for july and august while his owner is travelling. he's five years old, declawed and apparently very sweet and playful. this will be perfect because i would love to have a cat, but obviously wont be able to keep one longterm. its gonna be fun fun fun!

i've also taken on the responsibility of doing the schedule every week at the creperie. this will be beneficial for numerous reasons. should be interesting.

"event","who wants to talk to omarosa? she stinks. conan o'brien lost a few points there. its amazing how much the media tries to convince us of things that arent true... makes me feel like a zombie sometimes. gross. sorry... stupid stoned ranting.

today was alright. although the first half of it was spent pretty much in a coma-like state. last night, jess, nik and i stayed at the creperie after closing until around 2am scrubbing floors and walls whilst enjoying beer and wine. mmmm...delicious. we did a pretty good job... but the kicker: me and nik had to be at work again this morning at 9am... until 4. we got through it... and hauled ass downtown for some turkey o'tooles at bennegins. mmmm mmmm mmmm. there were some pretty cute lesbians sitting in the corner... the one day i look like shit.

after bennegin's, we went to hollywood express to rent return of the king since i hadnt seen it yet. bobby and theresa came over and we all hung out. it was an intense movie, man... but i'm glad i finally know how it all ends. 

oh yea! i talked to kelly-o today on a break at work... it was so good to talk to her again, even if it was only for five minutes. i really need to see you soon kelly! you too neilly! come visit for the love of god!

and on that note... time to study sex for my test tomorrow... adieu."

"event","rebecca is back from praha, and everything here is settling down. its nice to finally have my own space to live in. jess is coming to stay starting this weekend before she leaves to go back to england. that will be tons o' fun because i'll get to see her a lot before she leaves. *tear*

school is goin alright... sex class is cool, like i expected - why wouldnt it be? exactly. i'm making no sense because courtv is reeling me in... some guy killed his wife with antifreeze. fucked up shit man. 

today before class, nik and i went to petco to get cher and chastity a new house. its a little cyber village thing. they love it! they havent figured out the tube part yet though, they just jump out the top window. and... you have no idea what i'm talking about... bedtime. peace."

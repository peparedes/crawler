"event","boy. i'm really starting to play around with this lj thing now aren't i? i uploaded userpics and everything! heh heh heh. i'm still sticking to xanga though, and i rather doubt i'll have the patience to copy-paste everything that i write there over here...so keep reading xanga! i am however, toying with the idea of posting here as well. not necessarily the same stuff. so you might read something here that isn't there and visa-versa. and all of it will probably be inconsequential. hahaha. i'm all about the mind games...kekeke"

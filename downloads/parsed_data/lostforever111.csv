"event","I posted here over a year ago. I had a different account, that was more honest, but I thought fuck it.

Nothing has changed in the slightest. To be honest, it is the worst it has ever been. And I am fucking loving it! Apart form being broke every now and then (which will change soon), I don't think I've ever been so happy. There is so much drinking and other shit going on. But my friends now, shit. If I'd written last year how close I would be with some people like I am now, I would have told myself to fuck off.

The useless, whinging, twats have gone. And now I can see a core group. Which I thought I would never have with this lot. And I love that we are all fucking as messy as each other. Fuck everything. Fuck anything. Fuck it all."

- drink less, or less often (hard, cos i work in a pub)
- lose weight
- dont be a pussy

"event","So I probably ruined New Years for a few people. I need to fix things.
Don't even remember a lot of it.

I'm actually making some resolutions I want to stick to:
1) Give up smoking/smoke no more than 10 a day
2) Still go out weekends, but drink only once (unless special occasion)
3) Passs my driving test and get a car
4) Take more chances if they arise

I want this year to be as memorable as the last, because it will be. I hardly remember 2005 now. But 2006 has a lot of key events in it that I never want to forget:
1) Forging the best friendships I've ever had
2) Making some amazing new friends
3) Give It a Name and the weekend away in a hotel in London
4) Four day trip to Brighton with Thomas
5) Trip to Leeds with Gemma, Terry and Barry
6) Sleeping with someone
7) My 18th birthday (even though it was pretty much like a weekends now, it was still memorable for me)
8) Loving 2 of the best people in the world. So much.
9) Friday nights ""getting ready"", listening to music and drinking silly amounts"

"event","Of my Saturday night. Watching Extreme Makeover: Home Edition for 4 hours. I always feel like I wasted the night if I don't go out at the weekend.

But I suppose I needed a night off since I hadn't been sober since December 22rd. Woops.

24th: Me, Luke and Dom in Spoons for the night.
25th: Presents and all that shit. Got really drunk.
26th: ""Party"" at Doms. I again got really drunk and slept in a car.
27th: Chaz took me and Gem W to Old Town Spoons. Met Gemma and Marsh. Then to Envy (I was apparently too drunk to get in). Then to Chicagos. Then to Bar Original. Then to Chaz's.
28th: Christmas dinner do at Gems. Met her family. Got a little drunk. Then to Club 85 for Aby's birthday (got there at 10pm, started at 7....). I managed 6 pints and two double shots in a hour. Drunk.
29th: Wetherspoons again. Got kinda boring so we went off to Yates. Pretty shit and expensive. I sent a text to someone saying I couldn't see them for a while. I'm sad about it but it had to be done I reckon. Threw up loads on the way to get the train home, all because I was drinking dirty alcho pop mixed drinks. And wine. And vodka. Met some 25 year old guy at the station going to Baldock. We spoke. Made out on the train. Went to the woods at Baldock station. Things happened. Then I told him I just needed a piss. Ran away laughing my head off. I don't feel the slightest bit bad about it. Met Chaz's sister on the way back. We smoked and she gave me Stella.

Crackhead. Its NYE tomorrow. Joy. As long as I don't knee my head, run into a sign, throw up on a church, or sleep in a shed it will be better than last year. I hope.

NY resolutions: drink more, smoke more, have more fun, have more sex (i had a 13 month dry patch that I don't want reocurring), don't sleep with best friends, move out."

If I can lay down for more than a minute without choking myself half to death. I'm drinking the medicine out of the bottle but the fucking stuff doesn't have any effect. I went trough a bottle yesterday - it just made me have an annoying cough that did nothing and I ended up being sick. Then I started some more, it tasted vile so I'm hoping its going to work. I need to be a little bit better for the weekend.

I always rely on the weekend to make the week worth while. But in the end I know it will be the same as every other weekend. Extremely drunk, little memory and a nauseating hangover the next day. Maybe if something important happened every once in a while. At least I get to spend time with people, if only for a few hours a week.

Enough of being all blah. I can't wait to see Gemma and her new... Hair. Yes. Not face... Hair.

Make this weekend count. For something. Anything."

Got bored of piercings - have one lip ring and septum in. Clueless about college starting - no letters and no one to speak to when I phone up. Maybe I'll just not go.

I had a good dream last night. Someone drove me around to a beach, it flooded, we left. Drove to this weird house and went inside. Some bloke was trying to gas me, some girl and a guy. So we thought ""fuck him"", lets blow ourselves up. So I tried to light the gas, didnt work. Then we found out he was pouring petrol into the room we were trapped in. So I set a book on fire and threw it onto the petrol (far away from me, I wasnt ACTUALLY going to kill myself). This girl starts to burn really bad but she isnt too bothered. Im about to jump out of a window when I see the guy chasing after someone else outside. Just as it starts getting good my fucking alarm went off. Not impressed.

And other day I dreamt this school was cloning their students using poppers. These kids chased us, then started shooting nails out of their fingers. It was fun.

"event","Massive outdoor parties are never a good idea. Especially when you hear things the next day!

Yes, I drank a lot. No, I don't remember much. I remember what I don't want to, and have forgotten the things i NEED to remember! Like.. Who was wearing a white England shirt? And what happened there... When did I leave the field and go into the woods? Why? Who was the one in the red t-shirt that kept talking to me? I think he was called Dean actually.

I'm not going to anymore parties outside unless I'm promised no rain, or a place to sleep inside. Waking up in the middle of a field of hay at 6.30am with rain pouring wasn't my idea of a nice wake up. Found a tent though. It was below zero inside, seriously. So Kim, Mark, Kieran and me left for the station at 7am. In the downpour. Walking for 15 minutes and you wouldnt think it was possible to get <b>that</b> wet.

So I stayed in last night. A Saturday night. Needed the time to think things over. I want this week to be quality time with the likes of the Gemmas and Emily.

Roll on July 28th."

"event","Wow. This weekend was so amazing it would take forever to remember it all. Thrice, Panic, Goldfinger, Atreyu, Lostprophets, Underoath. Absolutely amazing. I didn't think I was going to enjoy Goldfinger or Losprophets as much as I did. Unbelievable. It was a million times better than last year too. The venue, the atmosphere, the people.

Couple of bad points.. Having breathing problems was annoying, but getting oxygen wasn't =]. Getting pushed across the floor in a wheelchair was also a bonus. The paramedic taking my vodka wasn't. Another paramedic telling me weird stories was. Ripping most of a fingernail off wasn't. Random girls talking to me and buying me beverages was. The fact that I used the word beverages.

Chris carrying me was good. Spending 2 or 3 days with some of the best friends you could ever imagine was obviously the memorable time. I just can't stop thinking about it.

But people are also extremely confusing and need to be smacked down into place. I feel really shit right now, not too sure why. I'm not at all excited about next Sunday (my 18th), and I just want everything to go away and sit in silence forever.

Oh yeh, the queue Saturday was good (didn't queue Sunday). I got not one, but two Stella cans to the head, half full. Then someone went to throw food and everyone parted to nearly the back I think. Some punk jumped in asking for a fight, but got danced with instead. They are shit at checking for alcohol, because it wasn't really obviously strapped to my stomach. No one tells you which queue is for which toilet either. So I stand around for like 10 minutes before I turn the corner and see about 12 free toilets. I think I may have been sick once as well.

After Saturday me, Mark, Chris and Jamie left at about 8 or 9 and bought a lot of drink and had amazing fun in the hotel. Mark is the loudest drunk known to man.

Barry: Vykkee is kinda tight
Vykkee: *drink all over Barry*
-30 mintues later-
Vykkee: *laughing* Its fine because Barry can only go about 2 minutes!

Good times. ""I'll have half a pint of WOG please"". Getting wog into almost every sentence too. Then there was the security guard with the latex gloves. He was blatently trying to get up close and personal with someone. I'm really bored now, so I might have a shower.

And there is also a lot of obscenities over my legs... I love Gemma <s>King not Wells</s> 's tight fanny. Terry Lee would get it. I fuck pigs (your mother). Yes, grown up. My nipples hurt."

Me and Gemma are amazing. I really can't wait for this Friday. Two of the best girls ever, a hotel, and about 30 amazing bands. To be honest I'm most looking forward to spending the weekend with Gemma and Gemma and everyone =]. The hotel looks amazing. I better not get in a bad fucking mood at any point, because thats not fun at all. But there are circumstances that <b>will</b> arise and will more than likely bring the fun to a grinding halt. But we'll move along. And I best get some.

So, excitement. Glad today went as fast as it did. I'm supposed to have 5 1.5 hour lessons (7.5 hours total). Today I had: a full math and physics lesson (3 hours), and 30 minutes of operations and maintenance. Do you know how hard it is to kill time in Welwyn? There are only so many times you can walk a full circuit of the town centre, go in most shops, and eat a <b>lot</b> of crap before you get bored! It didn't help that McDonalds hadn't started the main menu yet, or that Subway was shut the whole time I was around. Out of that all I achieved is... The desire to spend a lot of money on clothes I really need but cant afford!

Other than that, an average college day. I finally got my cigarettes off of Rob. He's been owing me a deck for about 3 months.

That ginger kid might. Ed might. That music kid might.

Today was aiiight. Skipped the learning workshop this morning and went round Caroline and Emilys. Listened to some musiiccc. Luke came round, the 4 of us just sat around being gay. Left for stevo, hung around the LRC printing out the cool Halloween photos for Emily. THen I thought I would be nice and walk her to ICM.. Something SHOCKING happened and we met Gem, so we sat. Blah blah... Biology test. Then hung around with Caroline and Luke inbetween lessons, and I decided to cut Physics in half so I could hng around with them some more =p. Told Chris I had a docs appointment. There are 2 guys in that class going to see Taking Back Sunday (ergh) etc in jan.. How peculiarr. Some more hanging about at Macdonaldssssss, Emily came, Li came, Gem came, we all came. OMG DIE.

"event","Ok, dream from last night. Involed some people, a tube station, some alone time, some fun, a train, and I dont want to tell you because it was too good. It was lush and I hate it won't happen! Heh.. Sorry Limm, lover you. My dream with the person at the place. Hmm, pie.

That will be all. I'll put me some emo music on and criiiiii =p. I wont, I'll just sit here and think and be sad about what i dont have and what Im missing. What I need. Just read something I wrote over a year ago.. Fuck things have changed so much. And for the better right now. I was unhappy all the time about things I kept shut the fuck up about.. And the way I looked etc. But now everything is how I wanted it to be, when I never ever thought it would. Hmm.. Thats something to think about you gayzzz.

Why am I so fucked up right now?</i>

Gay to the extremes. Skipping college was fun today. =D. What ever happened to integrity? I'm going to talk to my tutor tomorrow about dropping Physics because its GAYDIE.

Caroline: What does stale sound like?

"event","Ok, so last night. Was a good one. I picked Emily, Caroline and Luke up and offffffffffffff. Got there, not many people there. Was alright to start with. I had a good night and it got better as it went along. Just a note, didnt even notice the lack of you. So anyways. Managed to get drunk on everyone elses drink. I love it when that happens. John gave me lots of whiskey so that was alright. Lots of talking with people, raving it up to the music in my rudie-ness.""I've got sweetcorn in my pocket""... ""I'LL BREAK YOUR FUCKING FACE OFF!"".... Then we left at 11 because we were kicked out =O! Heh.. Walked back to Lukes which took us an hour. But it was funny. Walking that way and being on the phone and shit. ""text back my nob""... Aahaha Kim is funny. And I phoned Li and pretended I was from ICM and she didnt stop laughing... So I hung up! =D. I dropped my phone at one point so Emily decided to tread on it and dragf it across the ground.. Cheers love <3!! Back at Lukes... Watched some TV.. Got freaked out by his dad, uncle and their friend coming in. Really drunk =p. Good times all around except from the extreme lack of sleep, college in the morning, and I still have and essay and exam paper to do.. GAYDIE.

It wasnt enough."

I feel like uuugh, keep practically choking its gay. And Im not allowed out tomorrow night now, dont want to tell Emily though because then I will feel like a total cunt. God. Dont reckon Kate will mind though seeing as I kinda hung up the phone on her earlier =/. Oh well, I was watching One Tree Hill and being majorly pissed, what do you expect?

Not much. Just want to die in my sleep now. *chokes more*. Whenever I look at my front garden I think of Lauryn in that hat, then of Trevor =p. Trev! That would be <b>you</b> Glenn.

"event","Ok, so I had the thing last night. Was alright I guess. Loads of people round./ Main events... Umm, Hannah and Kim throwing bottles and hitting my neighbours conservatory, Abi throwing up on my bathroom floor, the sweetcorn incident. Last night Ben managed to mop up most of Abi's mess =p. But it really fucking stank everywhere in there!! And Emily put 1 bit of sweetcorn in Kates hand so she left =/.

So when everyone left me and Hannah went on a mission! Every room was hoovered, then we spent fucking ages in the bathroom. Washed the floor and walls (thanks for that Abi =p) and the bath. Then the matt and toilet matt thing. Little matt got clean fine, but even after a gyo in the washing machine the big matt reaked. So we stuck it in the shower, blasted it with water, ""vanished"" it, then drenched it in apple shampoo... Then sat for ages drying it with the hairdryer.. And the radiator. Problem solved!! Heh.

Ooh yeh,m and the yellow duvet which about 7 people through the course of the night slept under was actually covered in sick, not drool as we all thought. Haha, ncie. So I stuck all those ""soiled"" sheets in the wash but we had to do the same as what we did with the matt just about. So my house looks pretty much the way it did Monday morning. Except the downstairs toilet lid had its screws ripped out.. No fixing that! Me and Hannah also managed to go to Tesco (to buy toilet roll since 4 rolls were used, 2 rolls of kitchen towel and all the napkins disappeard!). Mmm and we made chocolate frostie cakes!! Which I have saved the last bit for Limothy.

So yeh.. Last night was just weird. I dont really want to think about it right now! Not having anymore parties for a while. Dont even know if I want to go to this one on Thursday and then James' on Saturday. Argh. Need money to develope the 2 films that were taken last night. Mysterious. Ugh, and loads of work to do for collegegaydie. Sometimes it gets too hard to breathe.

I feel worse than worse now. Hate it. Come back and say it it really is so."

But I was screaming about how I wasnt going to make one, I couldnt! I would go to the wedding and not make the speech, or stay home. So my mum said ok. I dressed in some REALLY horrible clothes. White t-shirt, cream/brown tank top, red wool jumper and a suit jacket =/. Nice! I got to my sisters house, but it was more like my brothers and they were all watcing friends and ignored me when I said hello. I think I called Lucy (brothers wife) a fucking bitch but oh well! At some point I managed to end up at Club 85, but the downstairs was all different. The tables were layed out with white cloth and shit. I sat down and saw that everyone had left theirs lights and cigarettes, so I took about 6 lighters and 300 cigarettes =/. Went outside and got in the car with George, his brother and mum. I talked to her about her car, and ho the black box is actually red inside, and this is a fault on all the cars made. She drops me off outside my sisters, whioch is like in the middle of a town square. I go and sit on a bench and Thomas (Emily&Carolines brother) comes and sits down and starts smoking, he offers it to me and me dad comes up so I hide it behind me. Thomas then laughs and says ""Oh my god! I hide my cigarettes from my dad too even though he smokes!""... Umm, yeh! My dad tells me he is off to by his work building to have a cigarteet where no one can see him. I leave Thomas and go to another bench where Kim and Emily are sitting, they are off their faces drunk and Emily tells me to fuck off when I say Im going to get a coke. But the way back to my sisters has changed, a river/sea has flooded so I have tp take my shoes and socks off so they dont get wet. For some reason I climb up a hill to do this. My shoes are all weird and cream coloured. So off they come and when I try to get back off the hill I cant, its turned itno a really steep slope. I jump from tree to tree until I make it down... Then some lady in my house wakes me up.

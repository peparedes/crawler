I just hope that people like our stuff as much as we do! So ya, that's about it. I am busy with work and my side job. Add on top of that my Primary class and I am just plumb tuckered most days. Anyhow - I have been reading up on everyone elses lives, so I am glad that you are all still here! :)"

"event","<p><small>You most likely know one. Whether you know it or not.<br /><br />Our real name is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Or we go by LDS. Mormon is a nickname given us because we believe in the Book of Mormon. We usually go by Mormon cuz that's how people know us...either that or they tell us they've been hearing rumors that we have LSD.<br /><br />We don't drink.<br /><br />We don't smoke.<br /><br />We are advised not to drink too much caffeine. An occasional Coke or Pepsi is not bad, but not encouraged either. But we ARE told not to drink hot beverages like Coffee, Tea, and certain other such things that are popular in other countries. Hot cocoa is NOT bad! If you see one of us drinking coffee or non-herbal tea, slap them and say ""NO!"" just like a bad dog :)<br /><br />Joseph Smith was the first LDS prophet. Brigham Young was the second.<br /><br />Gordon B. Hinckley is our current prophet and we all love him.<br /><br />BYU is a Mormon college...There are 3 of them - one in Utah, Idaho, and Hawaii. BYU stands for Brigham Young University.<br /><br />We don't have sex before marriage.<br /><br />The high school-aged youth go to a seminary (like Sunday school) class each morning before school.<br /><br />Our church session is 3 hours long and we love it.<br /><br />The Mormon missionaries are the two coolest guys ever. Be nice to them ;)<br /><br />It's true; we make the best green jello salad you've ever tasted.<br /><br />By the age of 18, most Mormon girls can make the best dang tasting homemade bread you've ever had - without a recipe. They can even make a wide variety of scrumptious jams for that bread as well - all from scratch - and if you're lucky, they even picked the fruit from their own garden on a monday night with their family on Family Home Evening. How's that for home cooking?<br /><br />We think Mormon jokes are funny.<br /><br />We're not supposed to date till we're sixteen.<br /><br />We know that groups dates are more fun anyway.<br /><br />We know that the best most fun dates - don't cost money.<br /><br />We gives talks in church in front of 150-300 people. How's that for public speaking?<br /><br />We have refreshments at almost ANY meeting.<br /><br />We celebrate holidays - and pretty much anything and everything - by throwing either a BBQ or a dinner.<br /><br />We love to sing and dance.<br /><br />If you go to a youth dance, you WILL see conga lines, break dancing, square or line dances and swing dancing. These phenomenons at times are also spotted at singles dances.<br /><br />You will also participate in either the Chicken Dance, or the Hokey Pokey :)<br /><br />We think that ""Do As I'm Doing"", ""Once There was a Snowman"", ""Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam"", and ""Book of Mormon Stories"" are the best songs ever.<br /><br />We know what a Sunbeam is.<br /><br />Almost every Mormon girl can play the piano. Heck yes!<br /><br />We not supposed to watch R-rated movies.<br /><br />We CAN use technology. And we are quite good at utilizing it.<br /><br />We CAN eat fast-food.<br /><br />We DO NOT practice polygamy.<br /><br />If we ask you to go to an activity, it's NOT a conspiracy thing where we're trying to convert you. It means we have fun and we want to share that with you. Likely the church won't even be mentioned while you're there, just an opening and closing prayer like any other church would!<br /><br />If we ask you to go to church, it's because we care enough about you to want to share with you what we know and the blessings we've received.<br /><br />If we give you a Book of Mormon, we're giving you the most precious gift we have. It may not have the same meaning to you at first. That book has changed our lives for the better and when we see you going through hard times, we want to help. This is the best way we know of helping you. So don't be offended. Even if you don't want it, know that we care about you THAT much.<br /><br />If you turn us down, it's ok. It's disappointing like any turn-down in life, but it won't change anything between us!<br /><br />If you think we're pushing you, tell us to knock it off! We'll stop. Sometimes we can get passionate or carried away. :)<br /><br />We are stubborn as heck. We don't give in to peer pressure.<br /><br />If you ask us what we believe, only for the sake of arguing, we won't tell you. It's pointless to engage on that when you're not going to open your mind and listen.<br /><br />Asking you to go to church, an activity, or giving you a Book of Mormon is incredibly hard. It's like a guy asking out his crush. Some of us are more comfortable in doing that than others. It's hard. So if we do it, please be NICE! :)<br /><br />Realize that if you go to a church meeting, we're not expecting you to be baptized next week. Relax.<br /><br />We don't care what you wear, what you look like, as long as you come! We're happy to see you!<br /><br />We'll live on pizza.<br /><br />We know what it's like to push a handcart.<br /><br />We have all sorts of useless skills that our leaders teach us - like engraving a picture on leather, or knowing how to make sock snowmen. Or making homemade ice cream and churning our own butter.<br /><br />We do genealogy. It's pretty darn cool when you find out you're related to someone famous...or that you're royalty.<br /><br />Your parents will let you go just about anywhere, as long as one of us goes with you. Trust us on this one.<br /><br />Mothers LOVE Mormons as babysitters.<br /><br />PG movies ROCK!<br /><br />We all love the Lion King.<br /><br />The guy who owns the Marriott Hotels is Mormon.<br /><br />Steve Martin is NOT Mormon just because he did Cheaper by the Dozen.<br /><br />We DO tend to have big families. The more the merrier.<br /><br />The boys go on two-year missions when they turn 19. And no, they don't get to choose where they go. Some girls go on 18-month missions when they're 21, if they so choose.<br /><br />RM stands for ""Return Missionary"". They make the best boyfriends and husbands :) and every Mormon girl wants one.<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, the majority of us would rather live in Antartica than Utah.<br /><br />For us, BMW stands for ""Big Mormon Wagon"".<br /><br />If you see anything bigger than a minivan and it's full of kids, odds are it's a group of Mormons...<br /><br />If you see anyone on TV (not on the BYU channel) under the age of fifty talking about Mormons, they're probably lying.<br /><br />It's nearly impossible to offend us - even if you do it on purpose.<br /><br />We try our hardest not to use bad language and we don't really want to hear it from others. But if someone slips up, it's not a big deal. They're still loved!<br /><br />People like, respect, and even admire us, but are rarely interested in hearing what we believe.<br /><br />Donnie and Marie? Mormons.<br /><br />We are not perfect. No one is. We make mistakes. We slip. Try not to judge us by one person who is struggling. And remember that we're humans, too - even if you think we're some superhuman subspecies. ;)<br /><br />If you EVER have ANY questions for us, we'd LOVE to answer them! Don't be shy!<br /><br />If you're Mormon or have a friend you love who is a Mormon, pass this on.</small></p>

*Pick three lines from it, and type them here, along with the date when they were posted.&nbsp;
*Go to your latest entry, pick two lines and type them also.
*Now list five ways in which you have changed/grown/etc. over that time period.&nbsp;

First entry (Sept. 12, 2004):&nbsp; ""The college is awesome, except for the fact that there is a 5:1 ratio of girls vs. guys, with the girls being 5. That happens to be a small set back. Because, if we are being honest, sometimes ya just want someone to cuddle with!&nbsp;&nbsp;

Most recent entry: ""Sometimes we have to change our attitude in order to see the beauty in the things that used to fill our thoughts and actions. We have to experience sad, hopeless, less meaningful things before we can truly love and believe in&nbsp;what we have had all along.&nbsp; Just remember that sometimes you really DO have to set people free in order to know if they are your destiny.""&nbsp;

5 Ways&nbsp;i Have Changed:&nbsp;
*&nbsp;I have a stronger testimony of the gospel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

"event","What you do is load your music collection into Winamp/Windows Media Player/Whatever you use and set it to shuffle the tracks. Then you play a new song for every question.



1. How does the world see you?
Les Miserables
It is time for us all to decide who we are. Do we fight for the right to a night at the Opera now?

2. Will I have a happy life?
A Lovely Night - Cinderella Soundtrack 
The stars in a hazy heaven tremble above you, while he is whispering ""darling, I love you"" you say goodbye, away you fly. But on your lips you keep a kiss, all your life you'll dream of this.

3. What do my friends think of me?
New Found Glory - Don't wanna miss a Thing
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure. 

4. Do people secretly lust after me?
Me - Beauty and The Beast Broadway
This equation girl plus man doesn't help just you. On occasion women can have their uses too. Mainly to extend the family tree. Pumpkin, extend with me. 

5. How can I make myself happy?
23 - Jimmy Eat World
No one else will have me like you do. No one else will have me, only you. You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time. what are you hoping for? I'm here I'm now I'm ready, holding on tight, don't give away the end, the one thing that stays mine.

6. What should I do with my life?
The Hardest Part - Coldplay
The hardest part was letting go, not taking part. And the strangest thing was waiting for that bell to ring. I could feel it go down. Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth. Silver lining cloud. Oh and I wish that I could work it out.

7. Will I ever have children?
I've got to see you again - Norah Jones
Lines on your face don't bother me. I can't help myself, I've got to see you again. 

8. What is some good advice for me?
Harsh Words - Maren Ord
Why don't you hold on? Why did you hold off? Why did you do it? Harsh words just aren't the way.

9. How will I be remembered?
My Baby Loves Me - Martina McBride
he never tells me I'm not good enough, just gives me unconditional love...he thinks I'm pretty, he thinks I'm smart, he likes my nerve and he loves my heart. He's always saying he's my biggest fan. My baby loves me just the way that I am.

10. What's my signature dancing song?
Jingle Bells - Diana Krall
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh, over the fields we go laughing all the way. Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright, oh what fun it is to sing a sleighing song tonight!


11. What's my current theme song?
Home- Michael Buble
Another summer day has come and gone away in Paris and Rome but I wanna go home. Maybe surrounded by a million people I still feel alone, just wanna go home. I miss you you know. I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you, each one a line or two...I wanna go home, let me go home, i'm just to far from where you are, let me go home. 

12. What do others think is my current theme song?
Seize The Day - Newsies Soundtrack
Nothing can break us, no one can make us give our rights away.

13. What will they play at my funeral?
Some People - LeAnn Rimes
It's another kind of trouble tryin to hang on to who you are when all you wanna do is lose yourself in someone's arms. Isn't it a wonder we got this far?


14. What type of guy/girl do I like?
Follow Through - Gavin Degraw
So since you wanna be with me, you have to follow through with every word you say. i , all I really want is you to stick around, I'll see ya every day, but you have to follow through.

15. How's my love life?
Remember When - Josh Groban
Tears of hope run down my skin, tears of hope that will not dry. They magnify the one within and let the outside slowly die. Remember when it rained, I felt the ground and looked up high and called your name. Remember when it rained, in the water I remain. Running down..."

Propensity for Monogamy:

Your propensity for monogamy is high.
You find it easy to be devoted and loyal to one person.
And in return, you expect the same from who you love.
Any sign of straying, and you'll end things.

Experience Level:

Your experience level is high.
You've loved, lost, and loved again.
You have had a wide range of love experiences.
And when the real thing comes along, you know it!

Dominance:

Your dominance is medium.
You tend to be the one with more power.
You aren't a total control freak in relationships..
But of course you don't mind getting you way!

Cynicism:

Your cynicism is medium.
You'd like to believe in true and everlasting love...
But you've definitely been burned enough to know better.
You're still an optimist, but you also are a realist.

Independence:

Your independence is medium.
In relationships, you need both ""me time"" and ""we time.""
You usually find it easy to be part of a couple.
But occasionally you start to feel a little smothered.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/thefivevariablelovetest/"">The Five Variable Love Test</a></div>"

Before the mountains touched the sky
Before the eagles had wings to fly
Before the rivers had reached the sea
Long before the dawning of our story

Before the North Star had been born
Before the seasons were even formed
Before a new day found the sun
Before forever was begun

Before the first time I spoke your name
Before my breathing was not the same
Before we touched I already knew
My destiny would only be complete with you

Before tomorrow had tried its best
To see if sorrows could make me love you less
Before the promise and the kiss
Oh, my love, remember this

I was loving you 
I was loving you 
Long before you ever knew
Faith would lead us through
I was loving you

When I saw your face
My heart embraced your soul
And here together in this place
The universe is whole

And I will love you
I will love you
A hundred years
A thousand tears
Would all lead me here
To a place where I hold you near"

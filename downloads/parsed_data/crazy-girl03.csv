"event","hokay...tday was alot of fun i spent the day with my paigey-ma-poo! we walked to Le Soups...but they were closed at 7...and it was like 7:02. jerks. Any who...oh and i also went to the candy store with rachel...but back to paige!!! so then we went to hungry howies and ordered a small pizza and howie bread and paige didnt get her change so she was like to the guy at the register, ""Change please!!!"" and he was like ""hold up"" and it was great. so any who...after we got our pizza we walked back down the street to the new candy store. paiges polka dotted shoes were adorable...but painful so there we were walking down the&nbsp;&nbsp; street with our pizza box and our shoes off. it was awesome. so any who the people at hungry howies gave us sauce and we didnt want it so we decided to be good citizens and leave it on the street corner for the homless peeps. hehe. any who i think we left it infront of the store that was selling langeray. oopsies! so when we got to the candy store paige had a whole conversation with the lady inthe candy store about how it was a new store and they should have the same candy that they had yesturday!! and they didnt so she was conplaining about that while i was walking around with pizza boxes in my hand shopping for candy.&nbsp; what healthy people we are.lol. so we were mad at the pool on paiges street because they took out our bouncie thingy and we were mad so we pulled back a piece of saud (i dont know how to spell that...the fake grass stuff is what im talking about) were going to get arrested. lol. any who...and then we found this branch on the side walk so we threw it in a persons yard. it was awesome. any who. your probably not laughing. maybe you had to be there. it was amazing. <lj-cut text=""9 mile fun!!!"">"

"event","Wow, I havent written in this in a long time! Well heres wats new...
Me and Kayla r in a fight right now. I think she thinks I'm afraid of her cause she keeps telling me to wacth my back and stuff like that. But I'm not. As much as I would like to be her friend again I'm not ever going to be again. Because she keeps talking about me right in front of my face. I know I should say somthing about it but theres nothing to say to her.This hole thing dosent really make a difference because summer is only one day away.My sister knows about like all of this cause I tell her everything. Its really cool to be able to talk to her. She told me not to worry about it. I cant belive the last day of school is tomorrow! It seems like only yesturday Mrs.McAdams was taking attendance for the first time. Of all the people I'll miss the most I'm going to miss Brandon Nicley the most. I mean I went out with him 9 times and I still like him a little. He's also really nice and funny. My sister knows about him to. Scence the year has gone by I've found out that I've changed alot. Like I love rocr music now and I never used to. And alot more things anoy me to. {lol} Right noe I have 2cond degree sunburn and sun posinig!!! It really sux!!! :-P Sometimes I wish I could just press abutton and I would be at the beach all by myself so I could just think and be by mjyself. But reality is in my way!!! This is the most I've ever written scence I started this journal. All trough 3rd,4th,+ 5th grade I've tried to fit in and I did whatever anyone else did. But now Ijust do watever I want. I like it alot better. {lol} I've also been more concerned about like how I look and things like that. I've also been able to exspress myself easier to. I know all of this sounds stupid but its all how I feel. And its better than kepping it all to myself. I cant wait till June 29th. Because me + Brandy are going to cedar point!!! Horray! Shes never been there. Were going on almost all the roller coasters. It'll be so much fun. I'm really happy Brandy came to our school cause I dont know where I would be without her right now. Shes taugh me so many things! Like pig latin and double talk. And shes one of my b.f.fs!!! 
      Well thats all I got for today ttyl!!!!"

Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somhow you just don't belong
And no one understands you

Do you evr want to run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio turned up so loud
That no one hears you screaming

No you don't know what it's like 
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be me.......

To be hurt, to feel lost 
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And there's no one there to save you
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desprate to find something more
Before your life is over?

Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

No you don't know whadt it 's like 
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like 
To be me......

No one ever lied straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy 
But I'm not gonna be ok
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work 
It was always there
You don't know what it's like
What it's like


umm yea here are my awnsers to this song...

yes yes yes + yes!!!!!!!  Im so sick of people calling me ugly and a {idc if my mom gets mad @ me im repeating wat they say.) hoe or a bicth!!! IM SO SICK OF IT!!!!!!! I cry myself to sleep every night thinking about it. What did I ever do to them?!?!?!?!?!!?!? Thats what I wanna know! So yea im so mad!!!!!!!!"

Beautiful eh?... Well Thats how i feel at the moment... on to more exciting news..
I went to the gym today.. burned 63 calories (thats all) on the bike that sucks monkey butt man considering i was on the fat burn setting & I pumped my short little stump legs for all they were worth for 15 freaking minutes.... SO then I go to stretch right.. theres these two girls there too, a little heavy but not fat so im feeling a little better about myself...bc b4 i had felt like shit bc there were 15 skimpy little things struting their stuff & it made me feel like poopy...so im feeling a lil better and i look over and this perfect little chick is stretching too but shes like touching her nose to the floor and her right big toes in her left ear while shes upside down and all this junk needless to say every guy in the joints pressing the buttons on their workout machines and im not talking with their hands here ladies and gents... so back to feeling like pond scum so i do my leg things (those revolting things where u have to sit there and spread ur legs but they feel really good tho!! ) and i do the calf strengthening things which is beyond me bc i dont want my little softball calves to get n e bigger gross...and then i do like 60 crunches which felt really good.. then i come home and my mother has the nerve to offer me pork roll and cheese! grease.. gross... so i had the will power to turn her down!!! so i feel a little better now... next order of business....i need my beauty rest... do u really think rest is gonna help me out in this area at this point?...."

"event","Im basically writing this because I havent written in a while and because its keeping me from eating the Easter candy that the bunny brought me that is calling my name...Shh Listen.. hear that?...""Kaareeen, Kaaareeen""...thats those Malt balls and u may think they are sweet but they mean business in the thier pretty pink and blue candy shells over there on the counter.. Any way...
Know who I think is so cute who was just on the teley Gideon Yago in his little glasses.. he reminds me of a smart Trent from Daria....Hmmm ... I have mucus in my throat? Attractive huh?...know what else is attractive... Smelling your socks..Dont ask-I wont tell-Kate knows what im talking about and thats enough haha ...YaY P.O.D.'s on TV and Boo my brother just turned it off.. Cynthias like the only person online that i talk to and shes not talking Boo... so back to smelling your socks.. No Phone Call yet I think im on the shit list for some reason or another... I was told to 'shush' several times last wednesday but I hardly feel that that calls for no phone calls for a week what is that a punishment or what? Well, its working I feel punished haha...  N E one enjoy my mood as much as I do? haha i love picking those moods bc every time i read one it leaves me so indecisive and I feel like I should put about 6 of them down as my mood im never just one... 
So what did i do this weekend..
Friday: Went out with amanda and katie and amandas friends... Went to the woods with flip flops on Woo Hoo good call Kar... got a cut on my big toe.. had alcohol in my car (Yikes! it wasnt me drinking tho!!!) Made a midnight run to WaWa and ate meatball sandwich yum yum
Saturday: Went to the neshaminy mall with katie..realized that I dont have music for my music project and I dont have n e time left to do it yikes! *again* ... Got nothing at the mall but Fat bc we stopped at Friendlys for ice cream and wound up eating Chicken ?Quasidillas? (close enough for a French scholar?)so we made yet another WaWa trip but this time it was at like 11 and ate ice cream at her house... 
Easter: Sucked-did nothing.. got screamed at at 9 in the am... which is really nice considering I wrote a huge letter to my mom instead of getting her a card bc cards dont say n e thing and i left the letter on the kitchen table later she was like thanks for the letter kissed my cheek, and that was that Thanks for everything Mommy! 
Thats my rant for the day (or the last 4 days) Bye guys"

SAT's yesterday (which sucked!) so I didnt get to sleep in then and today we had the gay Leadership Conference... I almost fell asleep in like all 4 of my sessions...
I'm driving home and I practically fall asleep behind the wheel God knows what my mom was thinking..Letting me drive when I was that tired...
One good thing tho..Last night and when I came home from the leadership conference I parallel parked like no other! I'm so proud of myself!
Best thing about this weekend.... I went out with Amanda last night. We went to her friend Bridget's house... It was cool... then Ben came :P him and Hilary are such wierdos She was like beating him all night... I think there were only like 5 guys there who didnt have girlfriends... Mike (who amanda was hooking up with), his brother Bill (I dont know his deal he was pretty cute tho), Shawn or Sean (Amanda's ex boyfriend!), Ryan (hottest boy ever but I dont know his deal either, hes like the only person I talked to all night), and some kid Dan Cook (kinda wierd.. really drunk) I think thats all on the single front.. everyone else had a gf so no big loss or gain last night...

"event","Hey...I'm so glad I'm home! 4 days with no phone, tv, or radio will really drain you...not to mention the crying and staying up late & getting up early. It was really fun and I can't wait to go back to Stella Maris but it's good to be home. 
    11 days til Katie's 17 YAY!and only 3 months for me! haha hadda add that in there katie cant get all the attention. 
    Oh yeah and less than a month til the prom... Guess what?? still no date! what else is new? Now theres this whole thing with Six Flags the next day and I really don't feel like spending another $100 just to take some random set up date guy out with me and my friends... And what am i gonna say ..""Well last night we didnt really hit it off to well so im gonna drop you off at home before we leave for six flags?"" and maybe he (whoever he may be) wouldnt mind if it was sucky and hed be glad to go home..and then maybe it would suck if i never asked him to go to six flags and we end up having a great time at the prom? Oh well it doesnt matter because ill end up taking some random person any way... I can wait til summer to go to six flags... Have Fun Katie, Mike, Cyn, n Pat! Take pictures!
    So I guess ill go now... Funny thing is... because of Kairos I'm not stressed out about prom or school any more.. I just want to be happy and I'm just gonna try my best from now and let that be enough! :)"

"event","As much as I sit and think about how I would never be with a guy who is like my dad was, I can't help seeing comparisons with the present guy that I'm with.  Part of me thinks that maybe there are always going to be similarities between one of your parents and just about everyone you meet, but the rest of me thinks that it can't possibly be true.  Sloth is fabulous and wonderful, and I'm quite sure that he's much better for me than I deserve, but then there are also some flaws that are so glaringly irritating that I'm not sure I'll be able to handle them forever.  Like staying out late drinking at the bar.  Last week he brought  home some random guy that he met at the bar.  (A guy I now refer to as his ""new best friend."")  Normally that wouldn't really be such a huge deal, but that particular morning I had to be at work at 4am.  So I got woken up after about three hours of sleep to Sloth and the New Best Friend talking at 130.  They stayed up until about 245, at which point I finally fell back asleep for 45 minutes.  (And Sloth wonders why I'm always tired....)  I didn't get up and tell them to shut up, mostly because I hate to be the party pooper bitch girlfriend, but also because I was too damn tired to get up, find clothes, and yell at dumb drunken idiots.  When I did get up to get ready for work I saw Sloth asleep on the couch with the garbage can pulled up next to his head.  (I correctly assumed that it was a vomit receptacle, and later found out that he puked twice that night.)  I thought about waking him up, but decided that he made his bed and now he could just lay in it.  I do feel a little bad about that as he tweaked his neck and back, but I also believe that retribution comes around and sometimes you just have to step aside and let it hit whomever it's heading for.  Besides that, he's 33, damn it, hasn't he grown out of it yet?

Now according to my mother, my father used to stay out at the bar till closing and then come home wasted quite often.  I don't really remember it that much, myself, but there's a lot about childhood that I'd rather not dwell on, so it could have been more frequent than I recall.  I do remember my dad keeping me and my sister up at all hours of the night partying with his friends on school nights when I got older.  My dad not being home much, as well as many other things, was a large part of many arguments between my parents.  

The scary thing is trying to see my relationship from the outside and really objectively judge it.  I see me becoming my mother; letting things irritate her until it broke out in a fight.  It's tough to see the line between not trying to change someone and having to do what's right for you.  What's right for me is to have someone who's home with me, spending time doing fun things that we both enjoy.  Unfortunately that means getting Sloth to change from someone who drinks all night and sleeps late and turn into someone who's awake in the day.  Now, if I lived in NY it wouldn't be a big deal, because there's so much to do in the middle of the night there.  But here, on Maui, there's nothing to do when the sun goes down other than go drinking at the bars, which Sloth obviously has no problem with.  I, however, do have issues with this, as I seemed to have outgrown that behavior, for the most part. I don't want to tell him that he can't do whatever he wants, but when we never do anything together because we live on such different schedules it causes a lot of stress between us. 

Mostly I just don't want to wake up some day and realize the I've spent 34 years (that's the amount of time my parents were together) with someone, and that I can't stand to put any more energy toward the relationship anymore.  Or worse, that there's something about that person that I decide I can no longer ignore or handle.  Admittedly, this is not the way my parents split up, it was much uglier than that, but I can say that I will never let anything I'm involved in deteriorate to that state.  I just don't want to be involved in something that's doomed from the start.  

But on the other hand, I can't see ever living without him.  

Damned if you do, damned it you don't.....damn."

"event","Well, since it's been about three years since I last entered anything in this journal, I think I'll do so now.  

It seems like I'm so much sadder now than I've ever been before.  I'm not sure what's going on in my life that gets me so depressed.  In fact, there really doesn't seem to be any reason...or if there is, I'm not aware of it.  Never before have I considered asking a doctor for antidepressants.  Well, not because I've actually thought that I may need them, at any rate.  My bouts of depression before seem now to be some kind of self-pity.  This is more of a hollow, sad, irritable-ness that never seems to go away completely, even when I'm out having a great time.  One little comment from someone, or sometimes even the presence of another person, and it's all I can do to keep from screaming.  *sigh*  Xanex looks better and better the longer this goes on.  I'm just hoping that this is at least partially connected to the health problems I've been dealing with since October.  Well, since 1998, if we want to be more realistic.  Stupid birth control pills probably have something to do with it also.  They seem to have in the past.  Maybe after two more months I'll take a break and see what happens...."

THINGS IT TOOK ME 50 YEARS TO LEARN BY DAVE BARRY 

1. Never, under any circumstances, take a sleeping pill and a laxative on 
the same night. 

2. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has 
not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be 
""meetings."" 

3. There is a very fine line between ""hobby"" and ""mental illness."" 

4. People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want 
you to share yours with them. 

5. And when God, who created the entire universe with all of its glories, 
decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT use, as his messenger, 
a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle. 

6. You should not confuse your career with your life. 

7. No matter what happens, somebody will find a way to take it too 
seriously. 

8. When trouble arises and things look bad, there is always one individual 
who perceives a solution and is willing to take command. Very often that 
person is crazy. 

9. Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance. 

10. Never lick a steak knife. 

11. Take out the fortune before you eat the cookie. 

12. The most powerful force in the universe is gossip. 

13. You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling 
reason why we observe daylight savings time. 

14. You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests 
that you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging 
from her at that moment. 

15. There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to make a 
big deal about your birthday. That time is age eleven. 

16. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age,gender, 
religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, 
we ALL believe that we are above-average drivers. 

17. The main accomplishment of almost all organized protests is to annoy 
people who are not in them. 

18. A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter is not a nice 
person. (That is very important! Pay attention, it never fails.) 

19. Your friends love you anyway."

"event","A couple were throwing a dinner party in San Diego. The wife was very excited about the event wanted everything to be just perfect. At the last minute, she realized that she didn't have any escargot, so she asked her husband to run down to the beach with a bucket and gather some snails. Grudgingly, he agreed. He took the bucket, walked out the door, down the steps, and onto the beach. As he collected snails, he noticed a beautiful woman strolling alongside the water just a little further down the beach. He kept thinking to himself, ""Wouldn't it be great if she would just come down the beach and talk to me."" He went back to gathering the snails for the dinner party.

Suddenly, he looked up and the woman was standing over him. They talked and she invited him back to her place for a drink. One thing led to another, and the man ended up spending the night at her place. At 7 the next morning he awoke and shouted, ""Oh no! My wife's party!"" Quickly he gathered up all his clothes, grabbed his bucket of snails, ran out the door and down the beach. He ran up the stairs to his beach house. He was in such a hurry when he got to the top of the stairs, he dropped the bucket of snails, strewing them all the way down the stairs. Just then the door opened, and a very angry wife was standing over him demanding to know where he had been all night.

He looked at the snails on the steps, then looked at his wife, then back at the snails and said, ""Come on guys, we're almost there!"""

"event","Due to health reasons: cancer of the lymph nodes. It seems that it is getting worse. He has sent this farewell letter to his friends, which has been translated and posted on the Internet. Please read and forward to any who might enjoy it. This is possibly, sadly, one of the last gifts to humanity from a true master. 

This short text, written by one of the most brilliant Latin Americans in recent times, is truly moving. 

""If for an instant God were to forget that I am rag doll and gifted me with a piece of life, possibly I wouldn't say all that I think, but rather I would think of all that I say. I would value things, not for their worth but for what they mean. I would sleep little, dream more, understanding that for each minute we close our eyes we lose sixty seconds of light. I would walk when others hold back, I would wake when others sleep. I would listen when others talk, and how I would enjoy a good chocolate ice cream! If God were to give me a piece of life, I would dress simply, throw myself face first into the sun, baring not only my body but also my soul. My God, if I had a heart, I would write my hate on ice, and wait for the sun to show. Over the stars I would paint with a Van Gogh dream a Benedetti poem, and a Serrat song would be the serenade I'd offer to the moon. With my tears I would water roses, to feel the pain of their thorns, and the red kiss of their petals... My god, if I had a piece of life... I wouldn't let a single day pass without telling the people I love that I love them. I would convince each woman and each man that they are my favorites, and I would live in love with love. I would show men how very wrong they are to think that they cease to be in love when they grow old, not knowing that they grow old when they cease to be in love! To a child I shall give wings, but I shall let him learn to fly on his own. I would teach the old that death does not come with old age, but with forgetting. So much have I learned from you, oh men... I have learned that everyone wants to live on the peak of the mountain, without knowing that real happiness is in how it is scaled. I have learned that when a newborn child squeezes for the first time with his tiny fist his father's finger, he has him trapped forever. I have learned that a man has the right to look down on another only when he has to help the other get to his feet. From you I have learned so many things, but in truth they won't be of much use, for when I keep them within this suitcase, unhappily shall I be dying.""

the road to vandenberg is all blocked off.  you can't get anywhere near the air force base, as they're on high alert.  it worries me that i do live so close to a place that may indeed be a huge part of something that i don't really believe is the right thing.

little things happen that freak me out too.  like the other night i had a dream.  i was walking with some friends, and suddenly the air was full of passenger planes that were flying really low.  helicopters were everywhere too, and bombs were dropping all around us.  it was so real that i could actually feel pain.  i mean, real physical pain.  at one point i threw myself to the ground to avoid a bomb, and i skinned my arm.  it hurt really badly and it was so realistic.

when i was driving to school a day or two later i saw a plane flying in to land at the sb airport.  before i could even process it, my heart jumped up and i almost drove off the road.  it was just a plane, coming in for a landing...but for some reason it spooked me.

and then the night before last, as i was driving home after work i got another scare.  i was cruising along, singing in my car when suddenly there was a bright flash in the sky over lompoc.  my stomach turned and my heart stopped.  my first thought was ""someone's bombing the base.""  i turned on the radio and listened for some news, but there was nothing but the same old bad music and religious drivel.  when the flash repeated itself a few times i realized that it just must be lightening.  apparently it was.  

it seems that i get spooked way too easily now.  i shake my head at myself, but don't really feel silly about it at all."

SCORE: 1 - 5
You can relax. More importantly, your family, friends and co-workers can relax. If possible, thank your parents every chance you get. 

SCORES 6 - 10
Not to worry -- you're not a threat to society. Although a few quirks in your personality may present some challenges in life, those same idiosyncrasies may very well explain the reason your name continues to appear on ""A"" party lists. 

SCORES 11 - 15
We're not going to label you borderline, but the Death Row staff would sleep better at night knowing the word ""psychotherapy"" is part of your vocabulary. 

SCORES 16 - 20
Not to upset your day -- but we're concerned. It might just be sheer coincidence or simply one of life's naughty little pranks that has placed you in the same profile category as Ted Bundy, Albert DeSalvo and Jeffrey Dahlmer.

on a bad note, i can't seem to cut this out and paste it into a different page, as i think it should go on my other journal.  crap.  now that means i have to think of something intelligent to say...

such as the fact that americans are severely apathetic to the world around them.  such to the extent as to be frighteningly destructive, self or otherwise.  i think this is the reason i know so many people who have died.  no one really believes that anything will happen to them, just as we're taught not to believe in anything.  i mean, when you really think about it, what DO you believe in?  and what about your friends, what do THEY believe in?  and i'm not talking about causes or anything, but more on the metaphysical/spiritual level.  most people i know believe something, but they don't really know what.  and if they do know ""what""  then their actions certainly don't follow those ""beliefs.""  and really i ought not to use the work ""belief"" at any rate, as in the center of evey belief there resides a lie, forever melded together.  ""thoughts"" or ""self-truths"" would be a better word to use.  at any rate, i digress.  americans--no, people in general--are apathetic to their world and themselves.  no one really seems to really care about anything anymore.  just enough care to clear the conscience, and that's enough.  when it comes down to the line, personal discomfort or any other line for that matter, everyone is a hypocrite.  and the saddest thing is....i'm not an exception."

 MaePixel:	 wow....thank you. 
 MaePixel:	 i was very upset at someone, and kinda at life in general 
 MaePixel:	 realizing that most of the things i say/write about are very shallow. 
 MaePixel:	 for reasons of personal security, mostly, i suppose.  not likeing to sound like i'm depressed or sad ever. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 It's rare I read something that actually makes me feel  how the the writer(you) might be feeling, and it did. 
 MaePixel:	 well, it was from the heart.  not usual that i write like that, or that i get that worked up and am able to write about it. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 But that's what so many people lack the ablity for, no one ever seems to write from their heart anymore.  
 MaePixel:	 and the few people who do no one wants to read 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Ah, but there are some who do want to read, hear, and talk to those who talk and write from their heart.  
 MaePixel:	 i spose... 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Just don't ever forget how to act from your heart and express yourself. You've always struch me as someone who's different in how they think, ... you're actually the only person from BME on my list (of 34 people) that I talk to still. 
 MaePixel:	 i've been losing touch nad not feeling much like keeping up with very many bme-ers either.  it seems like there are very few who try to keep in contact with me. 
 MaePixel:	 you, and about two or three others is all 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Well, it's not how many friends you have or people you talk to, but how many true friends you talk to. (which is hard to obtain on here, but not impossible.) 
 MaePixel:	 yeah...a few of the people whom i've even met and thought would be good friends have ended up losing touch with me. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 So many people on here don't actually attempt to establish a real intellectual contact with people. And then as you said, when you do think you're good friends, you loose contact. Once I get to a point with a friendship where I can tell someone anything, then I know I won't ever loose contact with them. No matter what happens. Thinking of all this, you are of the few people I've ever spoken to about these type of things on here.  
 MaePixel:	 same here 
 MaePixel:	 and then there are people who you are really good friends with, for a short while, who end up moving or some such thing, and you hardly ever hear from them again 
 MaePixel:	 that's the sitch with my ex who recently moved to texas. 
 MaePixel:	 it really makes me sad to think that he can't even take a few minutes to call or write or email to let me know how htings are going. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 ah.. I actually have never gotten to be really good friends with someone and then have them move and not be in contact (luckly.) But then again, you aren't as good as friends as you thought if you don't stay in contact and are apart. No matter how far, there is no keeping true friends apart. (oh perhaps he is very busy..? Often wishful thinking) 
 MaePixel:	 i know.,....and that's what makes me wonder. 
 MaePixel:	 i mean, i told him things i'd never told anyone before.  and he hurt me more than i ever imagined i could be hurt, but i retained the friendship, or at least tried to.  and now i wonder if i've just been fooling myself as to what our friendship really was. 
 MaePixel:	 and if so, was the whole relationship just a part of my sever illusionment? 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Something I've come to realize is when you are with someone, in a friendship or relationship (even more in a relationship) you trick yourself into thinkings things that aren't as good as they truely are. Blinding yourself from the truth, until you get hurt so much, that you finally open your eyes, and some people never open their eyes. The important thing is to learn from your mistakes and not make them again. 
 MaePixel:	 things were great with us...too great.  that's why he dumped me.  he started feeling too much, got scared, and decided to end the relationship.  he was going to move to texas in four or five months, which he did, so he tought it would be easier to end things before it got too hard. 
 MaePixel:	 i'm not sure what i was supposed to learn from that. other than perhaps not to open myself up to people like i did. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 With a situation like that, it's hard. Just recently I went though something almost like that, well there is someone I am close with. She and I both told each other how we feel towards each other, and I moved. If there wasn't a distance we'd have a relationship, but she's never in her life had a relationship. And she wanted to run, and forget about everything. Instead of accepting that, I continued to talk to her and understand what she was thinking. Trying to help her focus on what was in her heart and not worry so much. Sorry I am rambling, I don't mean to ... It just happens, much like when I give advise, whether people ask for it or not. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 My situation in an abstract way is compairable to yours. 
 MaePixel:	 yes.  but unique in it's own ways, i'm sure. 
 MaePixel:	 and you're not rambling 
 MaePixel:	 or perhaos you are, but i'ts good 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Ok, well I can talk a lot, so if I ever start to bore you, or whatever, just tell me to be quiet for a minute.. (heh) 
 Alpha0Zero:	 I could have talks like these all day long, day after day and be completely happy and content. I find a sense of relieve when I have intellectual conversations. That is something that is lacking in most relationships - real intellectual conversation (not just chit-chat..) 
 MaePixel:	 you know, i think that's part of the reason why i've been so down lately.  i miss having read conversations with people. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Did you get my two messages after you replied? 
 MaePixel:	 merf...no.  got booted 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Alpha0Zero<!-- (12:12:54 AM)-->: Well, I'll be on a lot more. And I am always up for a good conversation. I can't seem to get enough of it, and I always have something to talk about. 
Alpha0Zero<!-- (12:13:20 AM)-->: If you ever need someone to talk to, or if something is really bothering you and you don't fell well at all, feel free to call me, any time - and I do mean any time.  
 MaePixel:	 thank you sweety. 
 MaePixel:	 i appreciate that more than you could possibly know 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Even though we've never met in person, nor really talked a great deal on here. I feel that you're one of the few people I know that I could have an intellectual conversation with, and not worry about the truth..  
 Alpha0Zero:	 You've always seemed like a very open and honest person.  
 MaePixel:	 i agree.  it's odd, because we really haven't talked all that much, as you've pointed out, but we've talked about a lot. 
 MaePixel:	 much more so than with most aim friends, who are just there to banter with 
 Alpha0Zero:	 It's strange how I've spoken to you about things that I haven't spoken with friends I've had for years. But, they also don't have many intellectual conversations.  
 Alpha0Zero:	 I would much rather talk about ""deep thoughts"" rather than simple day-to-day things. 
 MaePixel:	 usually.  there are times when casual mind-numbing conversations are really good. 
 MaePixel:	 like when you just want your mind to stop for a while 
 MaePixel:	 or those days when you just want to stop feeling and thinking so much 
 Alpha0Zero:	 I agree with you, I've done it many times, and it feels good not to think so much.   
 MaePixel:	 too frequently, for me 
 MaePixel:	 i get bogged down so easiluy lately 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Often when I think so much, I have to go some where quiet and sit and think. I use to go in a field, or near a river. But now in the city, I just sit on the balcony and think.. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 What is it that has gotten you're thinking bogged down? 
 MaePixel:	 i'm not sure...financial burdons, 
 MaePixel:	 no privacy probably has a lot to do with it 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Why don't you have any privacy? 
 MaePixel:	 cos i share a room. 
 MaePixel:	 and the living room is always being used by someone 
 MaePixel:	 there's three of us in a two bed apt 
 MaePixel:	 i mean, i run away to the beach and things a lot, but still 
 Alpha0Zero:	 ah.. I see what you mean though. 
 MaePixel:	 it's a great living situation, and i wouldn't trade it in at all. 
 MaePixel:	 but a little more time to myself would be good. 
 MaePixel:	 i guess i miss being in love too. 
 MaePixel:	 i mean, the last two ""relationhips"" i had ended with me getting left, so it wasn't very good for my trusting nature. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 I know what you mean, I have have two relationships in the last many years. One ended because she cheated on me, the other, well as soon as we got physically close, she left me. So I know what you mean by not trusting people. 
 MaePixel:	 for me the guys both told me things that ended up being lies., 
 MaePixel:	 i don't think it was intentional that they lied, but still 
 MaePixel:	 it doesn't make it any easier to take. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Something that I have decided. I won't get into one more relationship with someone until I feel completely comfortable with them, and have really gotten to know them well. To a point where I would never have to worry them being faithful, always knowing what they say is the truth, and always being able to ask them anything and get their feelings about the matter. 
 MaePixel:	 things don't really work that way though. 
 MaePixel:	 it's not like you can really stop yourself from falling in love and still have the relationship be worthwhile. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 True. (ugh, all this talk about relationships reminds me that all of what I want and have seeked is in my sight, but the distance between myself, and this good friend, is too much right now...) Love is something that if it is true, and absolute, nothing will break it up. No matter what happens, it will always be there.  
 MaePixel:	 i begin to doubt that.  i get more cynical as each day passes.  all my friends are getting married and i can't even find someone to have a crush on, let alone be with! 
 Alpha0Zero:	 You don't find love when you are looking for it, it finds you - and in the strangest ways.  
 MaePixel:	 that's why iv'e stopped looking 
 MaePixel:	 but always before i could still find crushes at least 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Perhaps your expectations for a crush has risen with the pain of relationships in the past. (which I think it's good to have high expectations, you might not be with someone as much, but the person you are with, will mean much more to you than ever before. Especially with a wait.)
 
 MaePixel:	 i just think i've refined what i'm looking for so much that there are very few people who will ever fit into the slot, if any. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Something strange I heard in a movie recently, - It is told men are attracted to women and learn to love while women love and in time are more attracted to them.  - Which is true in many cases, and makes relationships hard for many people. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 What are you looking for in a relationship with someone? 
 MaePixel:	 i've heard that too....but i think that there has to be some initial spark or chemistry for anything to really move beyond friendship. 
 MaePixel:	 not much is needed, but something. 
 MaePixel:	 what am i looking for?  hell, what am i not looking for. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Try and describe in best detial what you're looking for.. 
 MaePixel:	 everything.  the same things that everyone wants in the perfect significant other....intelligence, common outlook on life, chemistry, humor, minor dfferences so as to still be engaging and interesting, responsable, playful, spontaneous, (money is good, but not really necessary),  similar interests,  all of it... 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Now could you have a friend with everything that you want, no physical relationship with them, but everything else, and could you be content with that? 
 MaePixel:	 hmmm......well, if they had everything that i want, there would definately be a physical relationship.  how could there not be? 
 Alpha0Zero:	 But if there wasn't, what would you do? Being such good friends, but no physical relationship.  
 MaePixel:	 but if there was chemistry, then eventually there would be a physical relationship 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Would you wait years if it took that long?  
 MaePixel:	 hon, i have waited years. 
 MaePixel:	 i'm not going to settle, that's for sure 
 MaePixel:	 i'd rather be alone than with the wrong person 
 Alpha0Zero:	 That's good to hear. I've settled before, and not again, I will wait my entire life, just to be with someone I care for more than anyone else, even if I were only to be with them for one moment, it would be worth the wait. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 There are only two other people I know that have said they wouldn't settle for less than ""real love""... 
 MaePixel:	 i begin to wonder if i'm not too jaded to see real love when i find it though. 
 MaePixel:	 what if i miss it? 
 MaePixel:	 cos i think it's an impossability 
 MaePixel:	 even thopugh i don't really think that, only partially 
 Alpha0Zero:	 That's why, anyone who you come across that seems to be a real friend, don't forget, and keep in contact with. Because you never know what you could be missing out on, until it's too late. 
 MaePixel:	 bah humbug 
 Alpha0Zero:	 To me, I think if you really will have a connection with someone you'll know something from the start. And over time, even if you  are distant, if you talk to them, you'd feel it again. I'm not sure how to explain the feeling I am talking about - do you know what I mean though? 
 MaePixel:	 the way i see it, if fate has it worked out for me to be with the person that's perfect for me, it'll happen.  i know the feeling you're talking about, and those few people are the ones that i'm always close to, even if i don't talk to them for a few months or longer. 
 MaePixel:	 but it takes a few years of being close to be close enough that that can happen 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Yeah, and even then, it can take some time. I don't think you need to worry at all, you're one of a kind, and without a doubt someone special. In time unbelieveable happiness will fill your life. 
 MaePixel:	 i know.  it's just hard to wait sometimes.  usually it's not a problem, but lately i've been kinda sad and not feeling much like there's anyone to lean on. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 I know what you mean, and when you get down, remember, you have your friends, and at times they're what you need.  
 Alpha0Zero:	 Close friends who are there to talk to, at all times in your life, are what you'll need some time. You don't have to be in a close ""relationship"" with someone to share your emotions and feelings. 
 MaePixel:	 ja...that's why i'm going to visit dennis tomorrow 
 MaePixel:	 i used to talk to him on the phone all the time, about everything 
 MaePixel:	 so tomorrow i get to get some good cuddle time and talking in 
 MaePixel:	 it'll be vry nice 
 Alpha0Zero:	 It's good to visit friends like that. People that shouldn't ever be forgotten. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Strangely enough, I never cuddle with any of my good friends (well, besides one, and that is the one that I spoke about in time having a relaitonship with, but distance seperating us.) 
 MaePixel:	 ive cuddled with many of my good friends. 
 MaePixel:	 mpst of them in fact. 
 MaePixel:	 but i really like physical contact from people i care about. 
 MaePixel:	 it makes me happy 
 Alpha0Zero:	 I'm a non-physical type of person because I've been hurt when I was little, by people that meant the most to me.. When I do show physical attection, it means a lot to me. 
 MaePixel:	 for me as well, but i'm very open still.  haven't been hurt enough yet, i spose 
 Alpha0Zero:	 As long as you prevent really bad things from happening, then it's not so bad, or prepare yourself. But then again, some things in life you can't prepare for, they just happen, and you have to deal with them. 
 MaePixel:	 i just let things happen when they will as they will and take it as it comes.  i gave up on preparing a long time ago. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Yes, you can't spend all your life attempting to prepare for being hurt, then you will miss out on many chances to be happier. 
 MaePixel:	 zactly 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Oh, wow, it's already after 1:30..  I seem to have lost track of time. 
 MaePixel:	 oh shit.... 
 MaePixel:	 i gotta get to bed! 
 Alpha0Zero:	 It's been great talking though, sorry if I've kept you up a bit late (or early.) 
 MaePixel:	 oh no, it's good 
 MaePixel:	 it's nice to have someone to talk to about this stuff. 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Good, good - ah, I've really enjoyed talking, I needed to have a conversation about all these things. I'm in a much better mood now.  
 MaePixel:	 yay!  and i'll call you on tues, yesh? 
 Alpha0Zero:	 Sounds good to me, I look forward to you calling."

"event","i've decided that no one really writes from the heart anymore.  or at least not very many people do.  so this is my journal for poetic meanderings and heartfelt words.

i'm sad that people lose touch with loved ones.  there have been those in my life with whom i have felt deeply connected, if even for a short time, but that have not even tried to keep in contact with me.  one in particular...the first one to ever really break my heart.  i'm still (or was still, at any rate) very good friends with him, but since he's moved away, over a month and a half ago, i have heard neither hide nor hair from him.  i think i'll write a long sad email to the boi now."

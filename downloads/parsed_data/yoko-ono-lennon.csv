For now I am content.. Sean told me he was going up-state for a few days so I have set about on making the home a peaceful one once more. Maybe this is what he needed to come from his mood swings he has been having as of late. I worry for him, I honestly do because I was told that Sean is slow to temper but, if his anger were aroused, he could act very much like his father... And, I am uncertain as to what to make of such a comment.


I hope everyone that was going to Tahiti has a wonderful time. I wish <b><i>everyone</i></b> the best wherever they currently reside. And just know that I have sent everyone involved a small box of chocolates as a peace offering between them and myself --- John, Cynthia, Ringo, George, Pattie, both Paul's, Jane, Linda, Lee, Maureen, Astrid, Brian, Stuart, Yuka, and even Thelma.

I do this because there is so much hatred out in the world and I feel that none are deserving of any hating vibrations sent out in their directions. And because we are in this world together and before peace can be found in the world, it must first be found with the people you come in contact with. So, this is my plea for peace with all of you.


Good day.

I cannot understand why my son is so angry and saying such negative things of people. His comment of about Jane was very uncalled for. If this young man is what I have to look forward to in my future, I do not think I want to meet John in 1966 just so to spare the world one less negative person. I try so hard to be a positive type of person but it is getting hard with Sean walking around glaring at me. He has been unhappy with me since I recieved some flowers the other day, shortly after our return from the meditational retreat. I was happy to have gotten them because they were very beautiful flowers, there was even one that much reminded me of Jane's vivid hair color.

So, Jane, I do apologize for any harsh words that were spoken of you by Sean. Perhaps he will soon settle his ""nerves"" down and become the nice young man he is supposed to be and all will hopefully be able to be mended. 

Though I do think perhaps, part of his problem is myself. He often gives me slightly dissatisfied looks since my arrival here in the future. Perhaps he is longing for me to be more like the mother I was to him here in the future. -sigh- but alas, I am but a younger version of this woman he held so dear and her passing was inadvertantly my fault. So I think I can understand why he is so displeased with me.

Even though we don't know who it was, he/she can DIE so can the little hearts on the card that came with the flowers. The flowers can die too. I hope that mother fucker that was teaching me and mom meditation dies too. The only person I don't want dead is me and my mom and my Dad (John). But, if she doesn't stop gloating about her fucking flowers, mom'll be on my die list too.

And now I wish Sean and myself had not gone to the meditational retreat for so long. I dearly wish I had been able to bid them goodbye while I was able to do so. Of these aquaintances, I believe it is John I most regret losing. Though I think I would much rather have considered him more of a friend than an mere aquaintance.

But, in the mists of all this sadness, George brought life into the world. I do wish them all wellness and long lives.

Tonight I will light white candles in honor of the lives that are here and those that have passed yet still remain with us on a different level and I will say a blessing for them with hopes that they will find peace wherever they reside on the planes of existance.

"event","I am afraid I do not understand <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/oliviaharrison"">Olivia</a>'s feelings of hatred toward <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/pattie_boyd"">Patti</a> and <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/j_lennon"">John</a>. I think perhaps I agree with Yuka's comment of how she is like the cartoon/video game character lover. Perhaps if given time she will sort out her true feelings and realize that the George which resides here is not the same George, in a way, that she married. He is a much younger, unknowing of his and her future relationship, George. Though, personally, I could not see George marrying such a materialistic sort as she seems to project herself as being. But, perhaps I am just seeing things with my own eyes and not her own. So I cannot pretend to know what she truly thinks and feels for George.

As for Patti and John... I feel, at any rate, they are undeserving of hatred being sent toward them. John has shown me kindness by allowing me to help him in his new home. And Patti, though I have not really spoken with her, I feel she is kind as well. And if I cannot find it within myself to hate George for having a more-than-platonic relationship with my future husband... Why should Patti and John be so subjected to anti-feelings from a woman that will not be meeting George for another 10 years or so? Perhaps her eyes are simply blind to the love John and George share.

And the guide to true happiness is accepting that which is given to you... even if that which you were given is not what you feel you desire. She should be joyful for the fact George has love even if it is not with her. Perhaps in time, she will accept this and be happy for George and John, and cease to dislike Patti.

But they decided to keep me too once I went to pay the bail and they saw I had lots of money in my wallet. They said it was for me acting like a smart ass when I went to pay mom's bail... But they let me out when I offered to ""pay both bails and then a little extra"". But anyway, here I am once again.

"event","First of all, I wish to apologize to John... I never intended to abandon you. I wish I could have been at the apartment for the past few days but I was... unable to do so. Sean had had an accident in his car and needed me to be there for him since I was a relative with the same blood type... Sean also sends his apologies and pleas for forgiveness for any harm that has been caused because of him.

Second, I wish to apologize to Ringo for any harm myself or my son have caused him. Whilst Sean was awake, he also wished me to send his plea for forgiveness to you as well.

Thirdly, I wish to apologize for missing Stuart and Astrid's wedding... It sounds as if it was a very lovely occasion. And I congratulate John and Ringo on their marriage as well, it is not often people will admit to having a traditional gay handfasting... or any handfasting for that matter due to the fact it is a pagan event.

Fourthly, to George, I am uncertain as to what this is for, but Sean sends his apologies and pleas for forgiveness to you as well. His words were ""Just tell George I'm sorry... for everything.""

Sean also sends his apologies to everyone he may have forgotten to include and he <i>""knows""</i> he forgot to include in them... such as Yuka, Maureen, myself (???), and many others.

Sean and I also have this warning for everyone... ""Becareful when driving in less populated areas with trees around... Do not be listening to music loudly so you pay no attention to the roads and do not see a huge deer about to bound into your path. And lastly, if you do decide to swirve to miss the deer, try not to turn the wheel sharply and directly into a tree.""

He had been on his way to meet some friends and go camping but had a certain time to be there, so he had also been speeding when it all happened, I make this plea to try your best to obey speed limits. 

I am very thankful for this... cellular phone thing Sean gave me. Without it, I would not have known of his accident until I had already made it back to John's flat. But, as it was, I recieved the call only moments I had left Sean's living establishment (which I had been cleaning up after he had left). Though I do not know if I was comforted by ""Your son escaped more serious injuries because he had on his seat belt."" It hurts me to think what could have happened had he not been wearing it... But, he should be able to go home in a few days so then he will be able to once again correspond with everyone.

Since I am unsure if I have a place in John's flat anymore, I will stay at Sean's place until further notice.

Sadly, they seem to think death will fill the void. 

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/honda_yuka/"">Love</a> is the only thing which can fill the void which <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/yoko_ono_lennon/"">they</a> feel. <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/georgeharrisong/"">Love</a> is the only thing <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/j_lennon/"">they</a> need right now... they do not need <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ringo_starr/18251.html#cutid1"">hurtful words</a> being they hurt themselves enough mentally. No matter how truthful the painful words may seem to the speakers and listeners, it does not mean it should be done so heartlessly.

I think everyone should just take them time to take a deep breath and say ""How would I feel if I were this person in this situation?"" and ""How would I feel if someone said something like '____' to me?"" and if, on the last one, if it makes you feel bad think also ""How can I keep the message of my words without making it seem so hurtful toward these emotionally instable peoples?""

I know Sean must be going through so much as of right now... Being not too long ago he lost the older version of myself... his mother. The two were obviously close being she was the only parent there to finish raising him. One can only expect him to be in a confused state of mind, not knowing exactly what to do or say with himself now. I can only wish to be half as much assistance to him for a mother's voice as my older self was. I will say a prayer to the gods that his problems will work themselves out.

As for John, though I do not approve of what his actions were I cannot rebuke him for them... Because he was only doing what he felt he should do. And he said many times he really did not feel as if he were Sean's father so one cannot truly hold himself accountable for the actions he took to sooth Sean's grievances. And even John's emotional stability was not exactly the greatest of things, being he felt as if he and George were growing apart as lovers.

Dear Yuka... Since coming here, I have become very fond of you. You remind me much of myself. My son needs a strong hearted woman such as you to keep him upon his feet. But, always bare in mind, Sean is in many ways like his father he can and will do things he thinks will make things better when it really just makes them worse. When it all comes down to it in the end, it takes doing the wrong thing for them to realize that the strength and stability they had been seeking had been right there with them all along. IN the 70's, JOhn had a ""lost weekend"" to make him realized how much he really loved me and needed me in his life. For Sean, it took an almost Oedipus-type scenerio from him to realize how much he needs and loves you.

I will now take this time to quote my future self:
""I have always tried to find something positive about everything even in bad situations... It is the only thing that keeps me going.""

No big offense to anyone but... I feel very... odd... with myself. I don't know. Maybe one thing I did was a big mistake...

Yuka came by this morning <strike>thank god after my guest had left</strike> and she and I had a long talk... she apologized for over-reacting then used the PMS excuse. Then, for the first time (since I had been telling her the same) Yuka gave me a hug and said she loved me. And I finally realize that it really is her that I love with my whole heart and soul anyone else (there's actually been about three or four ""other people"") was just a momentary lapse of sanity.

Do I regret these affairs? No. As mom always says, you can't change moments in the past so why dwell on them? It's best to just keep them in the past where they happened so that's where they'll stay. I simply told Yuka there had been momentary other people while I was in a relationship with her but I didn't give the names of any of them (mainly because one of them is her best friend so...)

Do I love Yuka? Yes. Very much so... She is, as I said earlier, my heart and soul. And now I have no reason to go around being insecure and wondering if she loves me. I heard the words softly come from her lips while her arms were embracing me. I heard the sincerity in her voice. 

Then we cried and just held each other and told each other we loved the each other. And then mom, who had been standing outside the door listening, ruined the moment by busting in and hugged us both saying how sweet we were.

So, anyways, I'm just here saying, I'm putting everything that has happened before Yuka and I had our talk earlier behind me and devoting myself soley to her and her alone.

I've always been the quiet contemplative type when my mind is being all weird on me. The mom I grew up with (the one that resides in an urn in her room) said Dad used to do the same thing when he was my age. 

Apparently, I'm also not very friendly when intoxicated because mom is playing the messages on the answering machine and someone said something sideways to me and dad and I punched the hell out of them and continued trying to beat their ass ""But we are grateful his friend was there to help restrain him from doing further damage"" ... o,o um...

Ah... I love chocolate... everything about it... the taste of it... the smell of it... the feel of it spread all over a naked body so I can lick it off...

Any volunteers?

I wonder what it would be like to melt some chocolate and lick it off of my future husband... Or the pretty Japanese girl that slapped Sean this morning... or anyone.

Chocolate is a beautiful thing really... it can make anyone feel better when they are upset. I have learned through my years that even if a friend has a family member pass... a few bites of chocolate manages to get them in a better mood...

I feel sorry for those that are unable to eat chocolate due to allergies. Because they can never know the joy which chocolate brings... 

I hear John enjoys chocolate very much... perhaps I can send him and George a gift basket of chocolates from this... Godiva supplier down the way. Or perhaps I will send EVERYONE a basket of chocolates... [makes list: Patti, Maureen, Linda, Yuka, Astrid, John, Paul, George, Ringo, Dhani]  -sends them all a chocolate basket from Godiva via internet-

I do think I enjoy 2003 much more... can do shopping directly from home.

John and George... yes... John and George are beautiful together... they are beautiful like the early morning dew set upon the petal of a lotus flower. If I were a painter or photographer... I would wish to capture them in a moment... 

All of the turmoils within relationships have made me look to the wisdom of my older self... During a ""bed-in for peace"" I tell someone that we are all married in the world... I do see wisdom in that. Perhaps we should just forget about the worldly marriages and remember that all of our spirits are together married and one... and that we should live in spiritual harmonies with each other and not waste our times with trivial things such as jealousy and envy over others for what they do/don't have within relationships... Perhaps we should all just love eachother with opens arms and follow our hearts and not let emotional conflicts get in the way if our ""offical"" partner becomes drawn to another for a moment...

Because all our lives are carefully peiced together moments... each put into the past within an instant... so why dwell upon a moment that cannot be changed? a past moment does not mean you do not truly love the one you have vowed yourself to...

That said... at this moment...

I am lonely with nothing but the sounds of my fingers upon the keyboard and Godiva wrappers tossed carelessly to the floor around me to give me company... Perhaps in my next set of moments I will have something better...

We've been used to my much older mother walking through the house naked in the morning (one of her many quirks)... But we would always look away or just ignore it. Well, behold, this morning the much younger version of my mother decided to walk out of her room in the buff. It cuaght me off guard at first becuase she usually comes out in her white sleeping outfit... but I did a double take and just gawked with my mouth hanging open... Yuka took it the wrong way and slapped the shit out of me and said she didn't want to be around a guy that gawked at his naked mother. It wasn't even the ""I want you let me molest you in a good way"" gawk... it was more of a ""WTF?!"" gawk.

Either she didn't know what she was doing or she had a ""friend"" over and they had fun with the frosting becuase I noted the obvious chocolate imprint of a human body on the entrance doorway and it was too tall to be this much younger version of my mother. There's also about thirty empty boxes of cake mix around the kitchen.

I've heard of kids having parties when their folks were away... but never have I heard of parents having a party while their kids were away... geesh.

So whatever is in the bag is just sitting there... possiblly typing... for all we know it could be this strange being's form of speaking...

They also gave me an urn with my mom's ashes in it... because once they got the bagged figure out of it they were actually able to move it fairly easily because they could take it's parking break off. They decided it would probably be best for my psyche to go ahead and cremate her and bring her home to me... So I put her little urn next to Dad's in mine and Yuka's bedroom.

It's kinda strange but amusing that I have Dad's ashes and he's just in the next room over looking young and healthy... but at least the version of my Dad I knew and my mom are back side by side again...

In other news... Julian is now pissed off at ME because mom only left him 10,000 in her will... and I was given power of attorney and was only allowed to give out what I was told to give out... so I passed 1/8th of the estates to Kyoko and her family and the 10,000 plus some things of Dad's went to Julian... Julian ended up selling them to get more money... Cynthia called to lend me a ""shoulder""... Julian didn't share his money with her... one would think he would want to help the woman that brought him into this world... ah well, what could everyone had expected? He didn't share the 15,00 he got when Dad died with his mother (poor Cyn, had to sell the letters Dad wrote her from Hamburg in order to make ends meet while her son had a semi-successful music career and 15,000 of Dad's money). So, I sent Cyn 90,000 as a thank you for putting up with Dad before he found what truly made him happy and for putting up with that ungrateful bastard Julian... Her live in boyfriend said she fainted when she got the check but that she's okay now.

The Dakota Apartment is quiet without Mom trhowing things out of the window or doing her little vocal things on the recorder... SO, I moved my fiancee in ^-^ Yay... I get to get some every night now... I just wish I knew what that huge metal ball was that is outside of Mom's therapy cabin...

Will be heading back to the cabin shortly...

IN other news... I managed to sell the dresser I threw from my window as art for $3500... fairly good, I must say, since the dresser only costed me $50 in 1977. Maybe I should throw my bed from my window and see if someone will try and buy it..."

JOhn's first day will consist of taking George to the romantically lit room inside the cabin; turning on the soothing music and go to work on making George scream... It is my hope that this exercise will <strike>make lots of pretty pictures</strike> make JOhn feel as if he has accomplished something worth while ie: <strike>fucking</strike> helping a friend accomplish a task they are uncertain they were able to do...

This exercise in turn should also make JOhn scream in some manner..."

"event","He did fairly well for his first day of primal scream therapy... though I do feel sorry for the unfortunate pillow I put in his hands during the time... feathers were everywhere afterwards...

On a plus side... I just heard him screaming ""I can't see anything anymore... ack... You've blinded me..."" Maybe this is sign that he is seeing the source of his anger and how it has been blinding him to his true feelings...  I think it is only a matter of time before Paul is feeling better...

On the downside... He found an old patient's copy of Driving Rain and has been listening to it... //~_~\\   Why couldn't he have found a better solo album left behind by someone?  All the others were so much better than his songs to Heather... 

On another note... I have yet to inform Linda that she has passed into the transcendental stage and Paul has remarried after only 5 years after her death... She will be livid I'm sure..."

"event","Normal day I suppose... Trying to make up more art... Had an idea from a movie... Dropping Objects from a plane and putting it on display... Instead, I would drop them from the window of the apartment... Didn't turn out as well as I had hoped. Though I did accidentally manage make that prick on third floor pay for that time he decided it would be amusing to tie my doorknobs together. He never saw the mirror coming... Though I do hope he is not seriously injured...

I spoke with Linda today... She said that some of the pictures of Paul and George didn't turn out well and looked a little fake and one of John and George was too dark... Can't even tell it's John snuggled up behind George... -blah-

Primal scream therapy went well today... I actually managed to burst a few vessels... But, down side is, I now have small red dots all over my face and look like I have chicken poxs.

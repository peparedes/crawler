"event","<P><FONT size=2>It's been so long since i updated this. Like three weeks if i did the math correctly. Well, last Saturday was GRACIES SWEET 16!!!! it was so much fun. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I have a few pictures from that, anddddddd Sunday was Halloween. That was fun. I went to Greenbrier with Brun and walked around with a bunch of people. It would've been better if Matt and Gio didn't do like an amubush attack 30 seconds after we walked out of the house.&amp;nbsp; It wouldv'e been more fun if i didn't have to walk around all shaving cream and eggy. Other than that it was a lot of fun. Brun and I just sort of tagged along in the.. ""illegal acts"" going on that night. Actually i have no clue if they were illegal or not but if the cops saw us we would've gotten in trouble. It was really funny though. Then i slept at Brudin's Sunday night. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Nothing important happened on Monday. Tuesday was Britt Brun's BIRTHDAY, she's 15 now. We went to Red Lobster for dinner. I personally don't eat fish so i ordered off the childrens menu. 10 and under! heck yes. Did you know that they put the lobsters on the floor and let you touch them at Red lobster? i didnt, but they do. I didn't touch them but Britt did. I took pictures. During dinner we had a discussion about Britt's b-day party with Britt's mom, frank, and my mom. Oh jesus the things&amp;nbsp; they came up with... ""How about you tell them they can either dress up as a teacher or a rock star!!!"" Holy hell, what were they thinking? Parents are so strange. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Uh, Sunday is the SP concert with Britt and Grace!! wooo so freaking excited about that. Im way overdue for a simple plan concert</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>anyway on with the pictures (courtesy of britt as usual).</FONT></P>

So we sat around there eating food. It was so crowded, and.. yeah. Then Frank picked us up and Britt came back here for a while. Then she left. Then i watched Halloweentown High cause those are like the best movies EVER. Today i chilled with my grandma.&nbsp; FIeld Hockey game EVERY day this week.

<P><FONT size=1>Britt and Grace and Alex (i&nbsp;think)&nbsp;are coming to the simple plan concert. I am SO excited. It was like ""hate on simple plan day"" at lunch today. I dont understand why everyone thinks they have to vocalize their opinions on them with me. Do they think that by them saying ""I HATE THEM!"" that im just gunna be like.. ""well, okay i'll hate them too just cause you say so"" Cause i really dont care whether anyone else&nbsp;likes them or not. So dont tell me about it. kthnks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Britt and I (and hopefully Brund) are going to the city on saturday.&nbsp;Thats exciting too. Very exciting. Cant wait. Were going to strawberry fields. wow. i am so repetitive. i definatly wrote that in my last entry. oh well, deal with it. Lets see, then possibly some apple picking&nbsp;on Sunday, and then the HARVEST FESTIVAL monday. You should be impressed with my busy social life.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Nothing exciting happened in that whole week that i can recall. Oh wait yes it did. We went to see Shark's Tale on saturday. It was so good. Cept, Britt and Giovanni dropped our big JUMBO SUPER VALUE SIZE popcorn. Twice. That was smooth. But anyway, the movie was really good. Go see it.</FONT></P>

It wasnt that bad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=1>TODAY we had off from Field Hockey and i wanted to go watch TRL very badly, but no one would come with me (well suz would have if she didnt have to get an MRI, and Britt if she didnt have a game, and Brundin if she didnt have to go to the orthdontist...). It was like the best trl EVER.&nbsp;Joel stopped by and&nbsp;Simple Plan, their&nbsp;pick up lines.... ahahha hahahhahahha hahha hahahah haha. It was hilarious.

"event","<P><FONT size=2>Well I havent updated in about 3 million years, but anyway on with my post...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>We had our first field hockey game on Monday, well actually it was a scrimmage but still it was my first time playing in a real game type thing. We started off down one player but then halfway through Suz got injured and we had to play down 2 players. Guess what... we still won! I got my uniform on Wednesday, I'm number 9 incase anyone was wondering. I look like a dork in my kilt. hah.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I went to the mall today with Evy, Erica, and Britt. Thank god for jewish holidays. I bought a CD. The Killers, it's good. I like it.&nbsp; I picked out all these clothes in Old Navy to buy and then i realised that Evy was holding my wallet. Of course at that time Evy was MIA as they say. So i told the lady at Old Navy to hold my stuff and Britt and I went searching for Erica and Evy. Well, eventually we found Erica but Evy had left. Along with my wallet. So we went and told the Old Navy lady that i wouldnt be able to buy my clothes. So, when i get my wallet back from Special ED I'm going back to Old Navy and i'm going to buy my clothes! and use my coupon! (saves ten bucks.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I watched Will and Grace tonight. God i love that show. It's so fucking funny. I also watched that show Joey, i thought that was pretty funny too. Not as good as Friends but it wasnt terrible as some spinoffs can be. Being the idiot that i am i totally forgot that tonight was The OC thing. Thats so annoying. So i missed it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>So, umm new simple plan video premiered the other day :oD heh. I love them. The video is so cool. It made me put Sitting On Top Of&nbsp;A Bridge (dont asked why i capatalized it.)&nbsp;onto my list of ""things i want to do before i die."" Of course thats the only thing on the list seeing as i just made it when i saw the video. I will add more though. Oh look i just thought of some more things to add to my list... I want to go to Paris, and Australia. (and lots of other places but i dont feel like sitting here all night writing them out) </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Guess what mother fuckers. I get my braces off on SEPTEMBER 27TH!!!! Thats like.. a week and a half. I am so excited i cant wait to get these things off. hey. If this was last year I'd be seeing The Starting Line, Allister, Homegrown, and someone else that day. And two days later i would be hanging out with SIMPLE PLAN. Oh man. now I'm sad. Maybe they'll swing by for a visit....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Ok, so now I'm going to go do... something else. Oh wait. I saw this quote last night and i thought it was funny... ""The depressing thing about tennis is that no matter how good i get, I'll never be as good as a wall."" Pace, from Seattle. And. I do not know Pace but&nbsp;I must give credit where credit is due. And i dont play tennis either, but Special ED does, so Evy, this quote was dedicated to you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=1>School started this week. Fucking hate it. The only thing i like is Drawing and Painting. I'm like the worst in the class but its fun. Photography My locker doesn't work so i have to carry all my books around with me. Thats just a bundle of fun. Some one remind me to get a new one or something on Monday cause im gunna end up with scolioliosis or whatever its called. I was copying the global in bio the other day and then i had to go up and get a book from the teacher and he goes to me ""So were you doing homework before?"" and i said ""Yes"" I turned bright red and then he was like&nbsp; ""Good, thats a good use of time"" I was so embarassed but he didnt yell at me so it was okay.&nbsp; That reminds me, i have to find a slug for bio. ew. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Only had field hockey twice this week. My a-kill-ees tendons in my feet hurt for some reason. and i cant spell that word so sound it out. Practice today was so lame. Only&nbsp; 2 people on the team actually want to play. We have our first scrimage on Monday. HA that should be pretty funny,&nbsp; Please dont come watch. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>I might go down to this thing at my grandmas tomorrow where all the restaurants and stuff put food outside and you go around and eat it. Its free. Gotta see if i can get some one to go with me. Its no fun getting fat on your own.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=1>I went to Port Jeff on Wed. night and i just got home tonight. (Sunday) It was so much fun. Lauren and her friends are so cool and freakin' hilarious.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Wednesday night Lauren, Erica, Tim, and Mike came to pick me up by the highway. Then we went back to Laurens and hung out in her insanely large basement and Mike hit her light with a golf club and it shattered all over the floor, ahahhahaa it was so funny.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Thursday Lauren and Mike went running at like 7 in the morning and then they came home at 8 and erica and i woke up. Then Tim came over and we went to a beach. We went into this big abandoned place thing and it was scary, but cool. There were lots of spider webs.&nbsp; Then we went back to laurens and played video games and stuff. Then Tim had to go to hockey and we went outside and i learned how to flick those things on the tops of cans of soda. My aim isnt very good though cause everytime i aimed for erica i hit Mike. Then we didnt see Mike any more cause he had to go to his dads till this morning. : (</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Friday we went into the city with Lauren's mom and brother and we met her aunt there. We went shopping, and i bought a snapple. Then we went to Lauren's aunt's apartment, it was so cool. I want to live in the city when I'm older. We watched some tv on her aunts TV and&nbsp;got chinese food.&nbsp;Then we came home.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>On saturday we went to the mall with Tim and he put french fries in laurens shake and chilli and she didnt even notice. It was verrrry funny. Then we went to&nbsp;a park. I forgot how much fun parks were. We went on the tire swing and all that other stuff that they have at parks.&nbsp;Tim tried to kill us on the swing.. but obviously it didnt work. LAUREN FELL OFF THE TIRE SWING. it was so great. I almost kicked her in the head. Then we went back to Tim's and watched some of Superstar. Thats such a funny movie.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Today we watched the fast and the furious. I love that movie. We didnt get to say goodbye to Tim or Mike but its okay CAUSE WERE GOING BACK NEXT WEEKEND, MUAHAHAHA. P.S. by last night Lauren and i were pro's at sneaking food into her room late at night. ahah. Lauren if you happen to be reading this your house was so much fun i love you.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Tomorrow starts another week of Field Hockey. I might just have to kill myself. Good Lord. We'll see. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=1>Guess what.... Im playing field hockey. Strange right? I no, and im going to be terrible, but im playing anyway cause they need players, plus its a good way to get in shape and I get to chill lots with Britt even though shes awesome and is on varsity. Well that was definatly a run on sentance. Im scared for feild hockey. ahh. Well atleast everyone is completely aware that&nbsp;I suck. And by the way, whoever decided not to have left handed field hockey sticks in the US, should definatly die. Argh. I mean it's bad enough that im gunna suck but do they have to go and make me play right handed? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Well i think thats enough complaining for right now. Moving on... I'm going to marry Michael Phelps because I love him and his sexy bathing suit. He is so awesome. He just won gold, again. woooo, go Michael Phelps you rock the house! or pool for that matter. muahahah i no I'm hilarious.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>hmm what else.... Oh! i know. Britt and I are trying to get jobs at Salinger's for the weekends. They said they'd call us tomorrow. How awesome is that? They need a cashier and donut maker. we could so do that. Holy crap thatd be so cool. I desperatly need money anyway. Plus they're only open from 9-5 anyway so its not too early and not too late. Well maybe a little early, but i can deal with it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>I'm weird i keep trying to get jobs, and then whem i get them i dont want to do them anymore. Like the hardscrabble club, well that was mainly because the lady there is scary but still i just never called them back. Opps. And then&nbsp;I was supposed to start at Hygrade in May and i never did that either. Oh well, I think Salingers might be good.. if i get the job and hopefully Britt will too.

<P><FONT size=1>Well, I went to the dead concert on Friday night. It was definatly... different. There was lots of pot. Thats for sure. And lots of people whos feet consisted of only feet, nothing else. No shoes,&nbsp; no socks, nothin. I bet their feet sure&nbsp;got cold. There was also lots of throwing up, and it smelled icky. But other than that it was just fine. Well actually, one of the guys was either totally stoned or wasted cause he forgot all the words to all the songs. I knew them better than him, how sad is that?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Sunday&nbsp;I went to my grandmas house in the Bronx, that was cool, got to see my cousins.. and my grandma. She's cool. Then when we were done with family bonding time my mom drove me to Bridgeport to pick LAUREN SAMPOGNA up at the ferry. Woo then we got Erica and they slept here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Today Elizabeth Genovese took, Erica, Lauren, and I to SIX FLAGS. Holy crap it was so much fun. I love six flags we went on lots of rides. It was so cool. I want to go back so bad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=1><FONT size=2><lj-cut text=""i love warped tour""> Britt and Erica and&nbsp;I went to warped tour yesterday. HOLY SHIT IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. I can't wait to go back tomorrow. We didn't see too many bands yesterday because we wanted to get any stuff that we&nbsp;were gunna buy so that on Tuesday we wouldnt have to carry it around. We got stuff signed by Taking Back Sunday and Story of the Year and MONTYS FAN CLUB. First we went to see Allister and Erica got a big bump on her head from crowd surfing. Than TBS were doing a signing so we went to that, than Britt and I went to see Motion City Soundtrack (they were so good that was a lot of fun) while erica went to see NFG. Then we went to find Erica and she had gotten to the front of the line for the SOTY signing so we went on line with her and they signed stuff. Then we watched The Early November for a few minutes and then... WE WENT TO SEE MFC CAUSE THEYRE AWESOME. It was there last day on warped tour : ( (except for the 19th) We went right up to the front in the middle. ahah cause were such losers. They were so good, i love them. When they were done Erica went to see TBS and Britt and I went to find MFC. They were at their merch tent thing so we went over and asked them to sign our warped tour ""program"" things and we even got some lady to take&nbsp;a picture with me, Britt, and all of them. (Aren't you proud that Britt and&nbsp;I weren't to afraid to ask?)&nbsp;Now&nbsp;Im sure i look like a fat tomato in the picture, partially from my lack of sunscreen, but whatever. Then we talked to them for a few minutes and they were really really nice. Then we sat against a fence and waited for&nbsp;TBS&nbsp;to finish so we could find&nbsp;Erica.Then we left cause&nbsp;Mr.Barnard had to drive us home. Holy crap&nbsp;I cant wait for tomorrow ok Bye.&nbsp;</lj-cut></FONT><BR></FONT></P>"

<P><FONT size=1>I no you missed me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Our house in Cape Cod was very small but it was right on the beach plus i guess you dont really need a big house for only three people. We saw a shark. I thought it was very cool. Other people seem to disagree. whatever. The shark was huge though. I thought it was a whale. But erica being the whale expert that she is (shes obsessed with Free Willy) explained why it was a shark and not a whale. I think we got lost almost every day. That was loads of fun. We went to the movies twice. Saw farinhight (cant spell it for my life) 9/11 and the village. I liked them both but i like all movies. Mostly. I tried to get tan and i think&nbsp; i did. a little. My eyelids got burnt and i got made fun of cause erica said i looked like i am retarded at putting pink eyeshadow on. i bought really cool shoes! tj maxx is my new favorite store. Holy shit im really coldddd. I found this cool rock on vacation. so i brought it home. its sitting right next to me. Oh i dyed my hair some more. Its the same orange color as Britts. Not all of it. I am so ready for Halloween. Half my hair is black and then i have orange streak things in the rest. I dyed half ericas hair pink too. Well its called Fushia but its really pink and they just want to sound cool. i Dont really feel like writing anymore about Cape Cod. so im not gunna.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Warped tour on Sunday woooooohoooooohooooo. and on tuesday woohooohooooooo again. But you know the highlight of my week will definatly be the GRATEFUL DEAD show on Friday with Britt and my Dad. Only i'm totally kidding.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=1>Yesterday Erica and my Mom picked Britt and I up in the Bronx so we could drive 4.5 hours to go see simple plan in Troy PA. A.K.A Nowheresville USA. I have to say that the people in Troy have really bad teeth, it makes me appriciate my braces.&nbsp;and everyone smokes. and they tend to blow it in your face. maybe that was just their way of telling us that they didnt like us. Anyway,&nbsp;the Simple&nbsp;Plan concert was soooo much fun. They played so many songs, it was so great. It started an hour late though cause Jeff had to go to montreal the day before&nbsp;for a family emergency and wasnt there yet. Holy crap they were so good. I think that i was the only one who jumped up and down the whole time though, but it was just cause im so freakin' short and couldnt see over the tall shit heads infront of me. By the way, at the end when they left Erica and&nbsp;I totally started the whole ""ONE MORE SONG"" thing. Its cause we're so awesome. We just kept screaming until finally everyone else joined in. And they did come back and&nbsp;do some more songs. Im&nbsp;very proud&nbsp;of us. The new SP cd comes out October 26th if anyone cares. cause i do.&nbsp; I cant wait for it they played one of their new songs and it was sooo great. Troy is definatly a very strange place and i'm not so sure i want to move there anytime soon but if SP went back there to do another show I'd definalty go back, if i could find a ride. Maybe my mom would drive she definatly enjoyed her first simple plan concert. (she stood in the back, dont worry.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Tomorrow me, Erica, and my mom leave for Cape Cod. God i feel like my life is all packing. I havent been home for more than two nights at a time in like 5 weeks. After cape cod we have our 3 day warped tour adventure. WOOOOOO. Im excited. And erica payed for my tickets which makes it even better. I gotta go wash clothes. bye.</FONT></P>"

Britt and i went ot toys r us and went on the ferris wheel cause our feet were tired. We had to sit next to these girls who were talking about how when they get older theyre gunna ""smoke up"" all day. I was like thats cool,&nbsp; go die. We also tried to sneak into Ashlee Simpsons cd release party cause we were bored. But we didnt get in so that was a waste of time. We also bought some nifty sunglasses. Well mine turned out not ot be sunglasses. so theyre just stupid glasses that do absolutly nothing. And we took pictures with the naked cowboy (see Britts live journal). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>So on thursday it was my birthday and it was really starting to suck, but then all my cool friends surprised me and came over and it was lots of fun. and i got lots of balloons. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Yesterday Erica and i went to the mall. I finally got the dress that i was in love with. it was 50 % off bitch. I am so excited about it but i have absolutly no place to wear it. thats okay ill probably walk around my house in it cause im cool like that. We also bought hair dye. So when we got home i dyed ericas hair&nbsp; a purple/brown/red color and then she dyed half my hair black. woo. then we played with mike and emilys rats and mice. Theyre very nice pets but the mouse i was holding pooped on me. it was gross. then they took us to petco and mcdonalds. yayyy.

We havent made any friends.. yet. It seems that no one there shops from Kohls like me and Britt they all have fashionable clothes, unlike us.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>So yesterday we had to stay in the city for a VERY long time, cause we had to wait for my dad to drive us home because we didnt have enough money for the train. so from 12:30 to 6:30 we walked all over the city. We walked from like 27th St. and 7th Ave. up to 58th St. and over to 3rd Ave. then all the way back down 3rd Ave. to 29th st. then up to 38th street and over to 8th Ave. That was alot of walking and our feet hurt very badly afterwards. We found some extremely cool stores with the most awesomest shoes ever that i am going to buy myself if people give me money for my birthday next week. Well most people would probably make fun of the shoes but thats only cause theyre stupid. Moving on....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>We were about to cross a street when we see 3 guys standing in the middle of a different crosswalk. Some guys car broke down and they just happened to be standing in front of it in the middle of the street.&nbsp;So we were like hmm theyre hot lets cross the street that way. So were crossing the street and looking at them and one turns the way we're going and the other two go the other way. All of a sudden Britt's like ""THOSE ARE THE GUYS FROM THE STROKES"" and then we were both like ""OH MY GOD HOLY SHIT THATS SO COOL"" so then we follow this guy and Britt takes out her handy dandy camera and we start taking pictures of&nbsp;the lead singer&nbsp;cause were just cool like that. We didnt talk to him cause we were too afraid but still. Then we went back to see if we could find the other two&nbsp; but they were gone. It was sad. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>After we got home from the city we went to the rocket summer concert. Bryce Avery was sooo good. It was very fun and he signed stuff for us afterwards. wooooo! and took picture with us. Too bad i probably ruined the picture. </FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=1>I haven't updated in a while. Not much really happened in the last few weeks. well i guess some things happened, whatever.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>So tomorrow Erica and Me and my mother are going to long island to stay in my Aunts house cause she is on vacation. She has a big inground pool and lives right near the beach but unfortunatly the weather is supposed to be crap. Thats okay it'll be better than the oh-so-fun NS.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Ohhh, Im going to see The Rocket Summer</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>and Reel Big Fish</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>and Simple Plan</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>and Hilary Duff. (dont ask about the Hil Duff thing) </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Umm, life is boring. I screwed up on my regents already and am most likely going to fail english cause no one will be there to write my essays. or fix them for that matter. Then there's Math... oh my. I'll be lucky to get a 40. Global and Spanish might be alright. who knows...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Moving on, Yesterday my guitar teacher told erica and i that we were equally bad. I was kind of offended. Atleast we dont need to fight over who's better. thats a plus.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Ericas room smells like crap. I decided that today and&nbsp;feel the need to share it with the world.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>I was eating corn flakes before and there was a raisan in them. So i thought to myself&nbsp; 'this cant be right' &nbsp;Needless to say, that was the end of the corn flakes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>I am going to evys house one day to play Donkey Kong on N64 cause that game kicks major ass.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Britt and I will be in Da Bronx for 3 weeks this summer i think, minus thursdays fridays and Satardays because we are cooler than all of you combined. Exciting stuff, eh?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>peace out homies.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT size=1>Hi, please disregard my last entry because we did end up going to the city!! and it was awesome. First we walked around times square even though were not allowed (heh were such rebels. j/k) Then we bought hot dogs from the hotdog guy. Mine had something hard in it so i spit it out. Then we walked us to 46th street and called erica to find out where Urban Outfitters is. Turns out it was on 15th Street. So we walked all the way down to 15th street and we found it! It is the most awesomest store i will ever go to in my life and&nbsp;i want everything in it. Unfortunatly Britt and i are not that rich so we only got skirts, but these are not just normal skirts they are extremly sexy awesome skirts that i am in love with. When we finished at Urban Outfitters we went to Conway where everything is like a dollar. It was really really packed though so we didnt buy anything. Oh by the way, you can bring dogs to Urban Outfitters... i want to bring Chester. hehe. So then we went on a search for the bus stop and we found it quite easily. We took the bus to the Bronx and went to my grandmas house and put on our awesome skirts. Then we walked a few blocks and got our nails done by the Chinese people. They thought we were sisters and they said i looked very young. stupid&nbsp;fucks. Then we went back to my grandmas house for dinner and then went for a walk, where we met our future mexican boyfriends who followed us on their bikes. (im jsut kidding about the boyfriend thing) Then we went back and sat on my grandmas stoop and waited for Mr. Softie. We got some icecream eventually and planned out our lives, then we came home. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT size=1>Today we got up and went outside to try to get tan. Unfortunatly we got attacked by inch worms and were forced to come inside sooner than we would have liked. Then we had some pizza and went online. Then Britt left and now im bored. ok Bye</FONT>. </FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT size=1>This is so annoying. i want to go to the city but no one will come with us. We're only allowed to go if theres 3 of us atleast argh. Evy's gunna be sailing, Brundins.. doing something else, Heather's not allowed, and Erica is just stupid. And any one else isnt allowed either.&nbsp;So it looks like were not going. Every time we plan to go to the city it either gets mest up or almost mest up. This is so dumb, me and Britt had it all planned out.. kinda, and now we cant go. Maybe we'll end up going to the Bronx to chill with my grandma who knows. Not quite as much fun as NYC but yah never know what you'll find on the avenue. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>P.S- if you happen to be reading this and are willing to come with us tomorrow please contact me immediatly, i dont care who you are.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT size=1>Alright. Today was, well not so great, but whatever. Anyway,&nbsp; I was sitting on my roof before minding my own business when my stupid nieghbors came outside and started staring at me. It was like full on staring i swear they didn't say anything they just stared. Maybe i had something on my face, who knows? They started freaking me out so i jumped back in the window.&nbsp;Then i was&nbsp;sitting out in&nbsp;my back yard and i heard something in the ""woods"" so i walked back thurr and there was this little dog attempting to get back over my rock wall. So i walked over and the thing like jumped up on a rock and started barking and growling at me. Then as i was trying to help the thing back over the wall into its own yard its owner guy calls for it and it jumps over by itself. the guy was pretty scary so i ran inside and hid for a while. So like 10 mintues later i procceded to paint my nails (which by the way&nbsp;look like shit)&nbsp;out there and got attacked by bugs, and as i was trying to get back in a&nbsp; HUGE killer bee tried to attack me and get in my house but luckily i was quick and slammed the door in its face! so that was my day kinda. Exciting, eh?</FONT></P>"

"event","<FONT size=2>Hola. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>This weekend was pretty good. Unfortunatly i didn't get to see new york minute as i would have liked, but otherwise it was good. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>On Saturday Britt and i went to the special olympics to help the disabled people. It was actually fun. The people were all really nice and it makes you feel good to see that they were all so happy. Howard is the man. I think he may be one of the funniest people i have ever met and his laugh is insane. If you ever want to meet him he works at the Stop and Shop in Tarrytown 5 days a week.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>After that i came home for a little while then my dad took Britt and i too the mall. We boguht our moms awesome presents for Mothers Day and got shirts from the clearance rack of Pacsun. There was also this awesome dress that we saw, but couldnt buy it cause it was probably a lot of money. but it was cool none the less. Then we went back to Brittanys house and sat on her roof and ate cheetos and took pictures. The cheetos were pretty bad. Britt said her dad wouldn't care that we were on the roof but we panicked when we heard him coming and tryed to get back in the window which caused us to knock over a vase and the nasty cheetos. So then we had to clean that up. Then we went for a bike ride to Katies house. I hadn't ridden a bike in 3 years so it was kinda scary but i made it without falling. We talked to Katie for a little while then dropped her off at the party and went back to Britts house and watched tv and fell asleep.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>Today wasnt all that eventful but it was fine. We went to my Aunts for Mothers Day and then i helped my mom clean up the yard. and now im going to go back to my oh so exciting life of talking to Brittany online!</FONT>&nbsp;"

<P><FONT size=1>Yesterday after school was ""the fight"".&nbsp;I got to witness it seeing as I am cool. I would like&nbsp;to mention that Joe is a pussy and he fights like a girl. Hopefully he will have a nice black eye while Mike walked away pretty much unscathed. (for those retards who dont know what unscathed means: not injured or harmed.)&nbsp; I would also like to mention that Greg is an asshole. My favorite part of the whole fight thing had ot be when erica was fighting with Joe, it was pretty damn hilarious. Go Erica, you rock! Ok im gunna stop here before i get myself beat&nbsp;up..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>P.S. GO MIKE FOR BEATING JOE UP!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Last night was the Letter Kills, Motion City Soundtrack,&nbsp;and Story of the Year concert. It was mucho fun-o. We moshed like potatoes! (and i no potatoes are mashed not moshed but forgive me for finding some hilariosity in the subject.)&nbsp;I do unfortunatly have a nice black and blue on my leg but, hey what do you expect. Erica did a bit&nbsp;of crowd surfing. Its funny to watch her being thrown&nbsp;about.&nbsp;After the concert we dropped britt off&nbsp;and Erica and i slept at Evys.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>This morning i had&nbsp;to leave Evys house before cake time cause i had to go for an MRI of my head. It was very very loud. Unfortunatly the results dont come in till Monday. </FONT></P>

Oh well mabe we'll all get lucky and someone will crowd surf on his head or something.. we can only hope. Oh man i just remembered you cant crowd surf at Empress. Maybe we can just throw erica at him if we have to.</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=1><STRONG>woo normal update time! are you excited? cause i am. no more survey crap...for right now. <BR>Today was bring your child to work day, which obviously means that i went to work with Mr. Barnard and Brittany. Here is i short summary of what we did today... <BR>I got picked up by Brittany and her dad at 8:25 and we took off for Armonk. He dropped us off at.. well i dont remember the name of the school but it was in Byram Hills or whatever where we met Katie and Brundin on account of Brundins mom works there. So we walked around the middle school for a while and it was actually quite sad as a bunch of the teachers thought we went there and asked us if we needed help finding our classrooms. Then when being thought we were 6th graders got boring we decided to escape... which is what we had to do cause they wouldnt let us leave. so we ran across this feild thingy and through a path in the woods, where we were then free. Then we walked across this bridge thing that goes over the highway. It was kind of scary cause the cars come ZOOMING at you, but we made it across alive.. obviously. Then we walked down some roads and had to cross over this other bridge thing to get back across the highway.. only there were cars on it this time. When we got about halfway across Mr.Barnard spotted us from his car while on a coffee run. so he came and picked us up in the middle of the road. Then he took us to the deli/bagel place. After he left we went to a store called Star Spangled or something like that but it was closed. so then we sat on a bench for a while till it opened and then walked back to the store where we were followed by the banana truck and britt tried to push my into the gross ""banana"". So we went into this store and tried on the big puffy prom dresses. They were funny. Unfortunatly the people there are big assholes so they wouldnt let us take any pictures of ourselves in the dresses. I no whoever is reading this is dissapointed cause you cannot see the beautifulness of us in the dresses but you can use your imagination. Then we left and went to Teach in Mrs. Brundins class.We all pretty much graded papers and stuff. Then we left and went for pizza. Then we went to some store, i forget the name and britt and i got some pretty neat rings. Then we sat on a bench for a while.. Then we went into a store and bought pretty flowers and Mrs.Brundin picked us up. So that was my short summary. not too short, eh? oh well. moving on... <BR>Britt and I are going to learn French from MUZZY (and dont even tell me you dont know who muzzy is cause i'll most likely have to beat you up) and we are going to go to France and chill with the French. Its gunna be cool.. we already tried out our French accents before cause yah no we are big losers, but hey its not worth being a loser if you cant have fun while doing it. Turns out we are not so good at speaking French but i guess we have some time to work on it. <BR>Story of the Year concert tomorrow!!! not exaclty feel good music like i am in the mood for, but what are yah gunna do? I'm sure itll be quite fun anyway. <BR>Dont Look Down and Auto pilot off on sunday!!!!!! That should be grrreat! im looking forward to seeing them both for the first time. <BR>tah tah for now.</STRONG></FONT></P>"

"event","<FONT size=1>Im really bored right now and i have decided that i do not like North Salem anymore. Even though i hate it here i could never move anywhere else cause then i would have no friends. And i couldnt even make friends because i would never talk to anyone cause people scare me. So seeing that moving is not an option for me i Have decided that we need to go to California. We as in Me Evy Britt and BRITTANY BRUNDIN. Now if only the 4 of us were 18 then we could move thurr and it would be.. yah no, legal. Since we cannot pack up and move to California without getting in mucho trouble-o we have decided to go on vacation there at Britt's moms friends house (or soemthing like that) where i will slide around the HUGE house in my socks (and the rest of my clothing of course.) Yup so thats the plan. Good, eh? ok bye bye for now. (and yeh i dont even know who im saying goodbye to but whatever)</FONT>"

"event","<P><FONT size=1>now that this is working correctly and all i figure i night aswell write something about my spring break..</P>
<P><FONT size=1>Tuesday- I got woken up nice and early because Britt got dropped off at my house at 8:15.. that was fun. Then I took the 11:15 train into the city with Erica, Britt and Lauren S. When we got to Grand Central we met my dad and took the subway to CHINA TOWN. When we got ot china town my dad went back to work and we walked around and bought stuff from the chinamen. We even bargained with them. They say $10 we say $8. It worked for the most part. Then at like 5:30ish we dropped Lauren S. off at her aunts work so that she could go back to her homeland of Port Jeff. When we got home we watched One Tree Hill and went to bed. Then Evy HAD to call and wake us up and scare the shit out of us at 12:30 cause she is stupid, but we forgave her.</P>
<P><FONT size=1>Wednesday-&nbsp;Me, Evy, Britt,&nbsp;Erica, and my mom&nbsp;left for the zoo at 9:15ish. We made a video of the day which was actually quite funny and met up with some of my family members at the zoo.When we were done at the zoo we went back to my grandmas, then took the bus to times square.&nbsp;We watched TRL and got to see Yellowcard woo! Unfortunatly we didnt get to hear them because they were in a building and we were down on the street but we did get to see then when they came to the windows. we got some free CD's and stickers and stuff and then went back to my grandmas for pizza. After pizza we played ring around the rosie with my little cousins then went home. We got home just in time for The OC, only it wasnt on. that was dissapointing. So then after watching our video we went to sleep.</P>
<P><FONT size=1>Today- So far today sucked. and it will keep on sucking until it is over. Maybe i will just go to sleep to stop it from sucking so bad. hmm... Britt's Guinea pig died today. R.I.P. Paprika.&nbsp;</P>"

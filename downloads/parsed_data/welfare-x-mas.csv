I have E102A, which is lovingly titled ""Ideas Of Renaissancem,"" and the Teacher Rebecca Helfner is a BITCH. Seriously though, I mean it...BITCH. She was so rude, yelling at peopl the first day, acting all catty and fucking psycho. It's been raining a lot here in Irvine so everyone is soaking wet especially on our feet.

"event","I don't know what I'm going to do once I graduate university (if God permits). I'll have two degrees which are kind of useless when I think about them. I mean, what can I really do with a degree in English and another in philosophy? I thought about Law School but I dunno if I could deal with that. I don't know if I could handle the pressure or the competition, I'm all for competition but I don't think I could manage myself to really run with anything.

I could go into academia, but it's too old and stuffy. I don't think I could put up with being a professor even though that's what I've always wanted to be. So I just need time to reassess what I really want to do. I kind of want to own a restaurant or something but everytime I mention that to my parents or family they shoot it down. They say I'm too smart to do that and that it would be a waste of my education.

So anyway, one more year to go and one more year to figure things out."

"event","I can't believe finals week is almost half-way done and that I'm turning 21 tomorrow. I don't feel so festive about it. Maybe because it's finals week? Maybe because I don't have money because I no longer have a job? OR maybe it's just because I don't care much about gambling or drinking (the 2 vices that become LEGAL @ 21) as much as I'm supposed to. Yeah, I think the latter statement is true. I don't like gambling because I never win and so I don't bother with it.

I'd like to think things even themselves out like that but some people just get it all and other just don't. which is why I like visiting uglypeople.com to make myself feel better...and perhaps feel worse about humanity, so emo."

I'm tired of <b>The scene</b>, and these new MYSPACE bitches, they don't even know where all this shit started. It was HERE bitches,<b> HERE </b>, and don't you forget it. This was the shit, back when you had to earn your place with <i>the shit</i> by getting a pass code. But I guess no one will understand that since everyone looks at the past as a given,<b> it just ""is"" you know</b>. It wasn't a time where anything could happen... because what COULD happen <i>DID</i> happen and everything that didn't isn't worth shit. 

So that leads us to this, which I must say isn't much of a construct for the future. What is there to accomplish any longer that the brain has not yet concieved? The ingenuity of man has never caught up with <b>His</b> mind for innovation. That is to say, I'm pretty sure cavemen were thinking of jet packs and Jetsons pill food, but never succeded in it's engineering for a lack of utility.

We exist Pallimcestually, we build on the corpses,the ashes and the ruins of the past. Our cities are the remnants, the ash is our history, and we are the corpses. If matter is neither created nor destroyed, we are merely a gathering of recycled matter, we are our parents tissue in the begining and our own in the end. We are distorted residue of a perfect primordia.

 Then why be perfect? 
why? 
         ............Because of a meaning? 

Tell me what you mean by that. Proposition. Proposition 7. 
                   <b>NO.</b>

"event","Things are starting to really pick up lately. I'm feeling so good that a new year is coming, I've been anticipating it all summer. I'm not quite sure where I'm going carreer wise, I still have a lot of things to get straightened out. As far as the apartment is concerened I think it's all settled. I feel real bad for James cuz he's gotta pay so much but at the same time what's fair is fair. He's working hard to get things done and I'm trying to get things organized and avoid conflict, only thing is I hate dealing w/ money.

I was talking to Maddie last night and I noticed how much I really miss talking to a friend. We were saying how much we'd like to be educators of some sort, even though the lifestyle is far from luxurious. I'm seriously tired of it u know. haha. I'm tired before the race. I don't care so much about money. As far as I'm concerned, money comes and goes. The only thing is that for me it's usually going. I want to be happy with my job, since it is going to be the type of work I do for the rest of my life. OMG MADDIE! PITY ME!!! (inside joke)

Anyhow I quit the job w/ Line 6 guitars and amps. My supervisor was so racist and so unprofessional, I just had to quit. The pay wasn't too bad, I was making $460 a week to start. I made some good friends there, they are kinda old, well as old as my own parents but whatev. Apparently there has been a lot of problems w/ my supervisor being a complete ass, tho I got the honor of shutting him up by blowing up on him. I hate showing my angry side as well as my complete dark side.

Speaking of alter egos there's just one thing I gotta say to someone. I'm just human. I'm sorry I'm not perfect and I'm especially sorry if I don't seem to be trying to become perfect. I really want to be happy, and I have lost sooo much of the vice I had. But do me a favor please and stop antagonizing me. There's so many things I can pick out about you and so many other people that are just so contradictory. So yeah, if I don't seem to be too happy all the time or full of praise it's because I don't feel it. 

Like I was telling Wade, I'm just not used to faking it. I can't fake it! If I got something to say I'll either say it or just take it w/ a grain of salt. So yeah, no need to talk to you if I'm not happy w/ u or what you've done. And right now I'm sortta bitter cuz I keep on meeting people like you. I know there's so many people like you but why do I always end up caring about you people. So I think this is the time where I am going to stop. I give up on you, you're fake and you're prolly not going to change. Live in your deluded world and think you're becoming this great person even though you seriously fucked up someone who really was trying to fix themselves. 

If I was wanting to jump off of Humanities bridge that night I want u to know it was cuz of you. The weight of the world was focusing on me so much at that time, and to make it worse you had to come along and help it crush me. You crushed me and honestly I don't think there's any way to reconcile. I'm really stupid you know, cuz all this time I was begging for forgiveness when you hurt me just as much. I guess this is goodbye to all those things I said to you, good and bad. This book has closed and I'm not going through it one more time. Good bye, good riddance."

Not like I wanna bitch about it or anything like that, but working at a factory is kinda hard. Today I worked 14 hours!!! I worked from 7am-9pm and now after a light dinner and a shower I'm writting to all of you out there. The pay is a hell of a lot better than F-ing McDees so I'm thankful =)

I miss everyone, I feel so lonely, so bored. I wish I had friends amongst other things. I kinda wish I had a normal teenage life but that's not the case, thank you VAS for ruining my life!!! BASTARDS!!!!!~~~~Ok enough ranting

A lot has been running through my mind during my repetitive work and even though I try not to think of it, a lot of what happened last quarter still plagues me.

I still feel like a loner. Is that bad? I met a lot of people last year and yet I feel like none of them are truly my friends. Not one of those people have called me over summer. Sure we all have things to do, but I at least made the effort to contact.

I guess the things I did last year aren't really working, and what happened last quarter just won't leave. I'll never be the same. I was thinking of New Song, and I love it but I don't know if I can put up with the feelings I get from it. I feel like a nobody there no matter how much I attend or how many people ""know me."" But most of all I'm scarred and confused by her, her and her friends who were in all actuallity my friends. I'm still hurt, I pleaded guilty to hurting her in the past, and I asked for forgiveness, but I just hope one day she will see what she has done to me and maybe then she will ask for my forgiveness.

Maybe that's what I don't like. I hear so much of change, so much of piety and yet no one is here to change me, to encourage me. I'm me and that's all I am, I can go on missions and act like I'm ready to serve God but I'm not and I won't be, not until this clears up. Where are you guys? Seriously. All this talk about being down and yet I'm still not part of you. Whatever, I think too much."

Thank you to Sam and to JK. You guys have been great influences in me. Sam, I know there's a lot of things going on in your life. I'm SO thankful that you take time off from things to come and help me out. I'll never forget you visiting at 1:30am to help me out cuz I was going to the gutter. Things like that mean so much. Mr. Kwong, you're our age and yet you're already piling on so much responsibility. You're a great guy and I wish we could have hung out more. Brian, you've inspired me the most. I appreciate how much you would listen to my problems and be unbiased. I won't forget the night we went to see the grunion run. I think that's the first time I've ever been to a grunion run with more than 3 people. I'm glad you came, even though it was so late at night. I want to be like you somehow, to just be understanding and faithful. Wade, you're the craziest guy I've met. You're fun to be around and uplifting. You give good advice and I listen to it belive it or not. If you taught me something it would be to never give up on what you want to do. Be who you are infront of everyone, there's no sense in hiding. Haha, you're not afriad to dance in front of everyone or to run around like a kid. You're a great friend, I'll always remember you.

To Dabien, yes I know it means shit in chinese. Haha it sux that your UCI mail address is Dabien. But trust dude, you are by no means shit. You are the one person I can trust the most. I can tell you anything and be comfortable with it. You're the person I can count on most, and it's sad to admit but you're the only best friend I ever had. So much randomness haha. I won't forget going to IHOP @ 3am or going to Lee's for no reason. The best though is when we went to BCD @ 2am cuz I was having a hard time and you were just hungry. Your opinion sits best with me and advice has a lot of weight. Thanks for always listening to me.

Ryan, I didn't get to know you well enough but I'll miss playing AOE and random shit haha. Stealing trophies, scaring Sophia, or me scaring you. I'll miss the lonely far single room and the weird-o that lived there.

Arjuna Christiansen. My kneegrow, I know I can just call you Aj but your official name sounds better. You're one crazy ho, but you already know that. I'll never forget you gambling addiction. Sorry I never got to go to casino with you, but I'm poor and you knw that too. Just to let you know you can crash at my place next year whenever you want. Homies trust

James, we're living together next year. I can't belive it! I wish you were around more often so we could talk. We'll get plenty of time for that next year. Good luck w/ the vitamin business.

Dano, haha so much incest! I'm glad you made it! You're a good guy, and I wish we hung out more but there's no sense in regret, for SURE I'll see you next year. take care of yourself cuz I already tell you people are looking out for you.

WINCE!!! My roommie! What can I say man? It's been a helluvah year. I know roomming together was a struggle at times, but I'm glad we got through. I feel like we've become better friends, or at least more understanding. I hope you know that I'm always here for ya man. Even though sometimes I'm cold, whenever I see you down, I'm always willing to be there. We have such a long history and I'm glad to have you here to remind me of where I came from. Good luck next year, and keep in touch."

The Magic Circle worked out well in the end. I just wished it was easier to get them to cooperate, which is a lot to ask considering the teachers themselves can't get the class to calm down. But all in all I think the excercise went well.

Seeing them cry and be happy about graduating made me think about how much I wish I had someone come and do the touch game w/ m class. I hope they enjoyed it because opportunites like that rarely come around.

After visiting the seniors I had lunch w/ my Grandma. It's always fun going out w/ her since there's so much to talk about. She always makes comments about my financial states. LOL. ""You're the poorest of my grandchildren yet you're the only one whoever takes me out to eat."" I love you Grandma, you're crazy but I love ya.

I'll be back home on Wednesday after my 2 finals on Math and English. Instead of studying I'm writting in here. Aiyaaaa~!"

I still have to write my Humcore paper which is due tomorrow. I'm not too worried about it but I know I take too many breaks. Kind of disappointed that it's taking this long to write. Then again, there's been a lot of set backs going on right now in my life. Thank God Summer's coming! I need a break, WE ALL NEED A BREAK.

She's lossed two of her friends within months of eachother and she still manages to look for God and keep optimistic. I'm extremely proud of her.

As for Matt. He was older than me by 2 years. He was one of the nicest guys I knew, he had it all and I'm serious. He was outgoing, good-looking (he dated a really beautiful girl), talented, smart, funny, and he was one of the few people who was genuinely nice to me when I was growing up. He was accepted into UCLA and that's when things started getting hard. I remember going to church one Sunday and hearing them asking for us to pray for him. I asked one of the people who was closer to him and he told me what had happened. Matt's grades were slipping because he had slipped into depression. His GF had been cheating on him, he had just gotten 3 tickets, his license was being revoked. I think because of the stress he resorted to alcohol and lost a lot of his closer friends because of it. He was drunk the night he jumped off the top of his dorm building, he was supposed to go home that night but he told his parents he was finishing up a research paper. I didn't know him well but it makes me sad to see someone like him go.

Jason was a kid I knew growing up. He was a really troubled boy, an outsider, a loner. I felt a lot for him because I could see alot of me in him. He would tell me about how one day he would rule the world and maybe then everyone would love him. I always liked that kid, he would make me laugh. Even if his jokes were stupid and he didn't make any sense at times, I knew he had a good heart in him. Eventually he moved away and it wasn't until later on that I found out he committed suicide. People picked on him a lot, and I could always see the hurt in his eyes. I wish I had told him that he always had a friend in me, that he could call me. I think maybe that if I had told him how great a person he was maybe he would be alive today. He was a brilliant kid who got drowned out by a dark world. It bothers me to know he won't be ruling the world."

<b><i>Ashley I Swear I Know How You Feel</b></i>

Dear Lauren, How I miss you so much
These are the words I never told you,
Oh how I wish I had before you've gone...
There's not a night that goes by where
I don't think about you, not a time
When I don't choke when I hear our favorite songs

Down here, they all don't understand how short life really is
Down here, It's like no one see's how precious life really is
Yeah down here, I don't understand how wonderful living is
Cuz you're up there and I'm lost down here...

Dear Matthew, I didn't know you that well
I heard the news on Sunday morning, about your last night and how you fell
You climbed the 5th story, always said you wanted to be Super-man
So you tried to fly that night
I know life wasn't going so well for you
I wish I was there for you, to tell you you'd be all right...

Ohhh Down here, it seems like no one knows how you feel inside
Why is it that down here, no one can see the demons you hide
It hurts to think that down here, they all turn you down when you need a ride
Cuz the road's a lonely place to be down here...

Dear Jason, you always said you'd grow up to rule the world
It bothers me to see that you won't take this world on someday
I ask why do things end up that way
It's not the same without you down here
I miss you now that you're away
I hate the fact that these are the words I didn't say

And it hurts for me to be here
Knowing that you are gone
Sometimes I wonder why these things went wrong...

I heard your voice calling outside my window
I wanted to go out and smell the summer air
Just thinking about how happy I felt seeing you there
Fastforward to another season
We stopped talking for some reason
Scar tissue forms for you in my heart
Why did these feelings even start

<b><edit>Chorus</edit></b>
And I wish I could tell you how much this means to me 
But I know the look you give when you don't know what I mean
It's those looks that make me melt inside
And I wish that I could say goodbye 
Just as easy as I said Hello that day

Why don't you go ahead and forget me
Why can't I get you off my mind
Just let whatever happen, cuz all it does is take time
And you can call me @ 1:30 when the sun is good and gone
God forbid we both stay on the line too long

It's like everywhere I see you
No matter how hard I try to leave you
You linger on, in every moment of the day
Why does it bother me so much to see, 
that I'm not your number one
A few more weeks, a few more hours and I'm gone
And all you'll have left of me is this song

<b><edit></b>
And I wish I could say goodbye
As easily as I said hi
I wish I could say goodbye
Just as easy as I say goodnight
But nothing's good
So long as I can't get over you

I think the thing that made the night so awesome was the fact I was w/ really cool people. I felt so comfortable, which if you knew me you'd also know that I usually never feel comfotrable in crowds =( Man, oh man, I wish I could go back in time and relive the night. So much fun with Cassie and Chu and Jann (who I see everywhere for some odd reason). Thank God Jann was there, if not I wouldn't have gotten any of my stuff signed haha.

Basically the whole process started at 6pm and ended at 3am. We were basically told to act like we're in a concert which wasn't too hard the first few takes. After a while you start to lose a lot of steam, then your arms start hurting from raising your hands and stuff. The concept of the video is that we're peace activist who get beat down by the police. Then in the middle of it all is Yellowcard playing a huge ass concert. At the end of all the madness is us in a sea of people raising up peace signs. Sounds short written down but we needed to do freaking 30 takes!!! AHHHHH

It was all well worth it. If I could I would do all of this again."

Today the sun was blazing
I couldn't stand to be inside
The summer air takes me there
A place that changes with the tides
And I, I remember, a time so long ago
Whenever, it gets like this the feeling takes control

Who wants to be inside
Cuz outside the sunlight floods all of them out
Who wants to let time fly
Cuz there's not much more to waste on backing down
And I'll be here waiting, by the sea
To live up good old times
And create some new memories

Back to today
I want to let you know that
I really miss you, so that
You can feel you're worth to me
I'll never let you go
The waters would have to stop their flow
And so would the blood inside my veins

So here I stand waiting...
Won't you come to me?

Well so far everything has been going fine. I think I'll do well this year so long as I don't lose track of priority. Class wise I'm swamped, I'm in serious need of a vacation, 2 quarters down 1 more to go 20 units each (I exagerate, I'm only taking 19 this quarter). Classes this quarter seem pretty boring, nothing very interesting, and in fact I'm taking some pretty retarded courses. Math 1B is for retards, man o man, I hate math but please do something progressive! Humcore this quarter is boring, maybe it's just the type of people there, I don't know but I really miss Brian's class last quarter. The people in that class were great and Brian's not bad either, I actually sat next to him in lecture today, though 1 seats distance. I tend to get in trouble for diverting the TA's attention in lectures, Nuccia already scolded me on that.

Socialy I'm back at square one. I'm not very social, I guess I never will be. Truth is I don't think people like me, which is OK because for the most part I don't like people. Sad, but true. I can't find it in myself to be fake or be nice to people I can't stand. By no means am I uncivil about it, if I don't like you I avoid you and that's that. It's just who I am.
<lj-cut text=""Oh the controversy"">
I've lost a lot of respect and trust for people in my suite. They confuse me so much. They tell me one thing and do another, and it's irritating becausethey do the opposite of how I handle the people I don't like. But I guess that comes w/ the territory they're in. Even if you don't like someone or know that they're bad news, you <i>have to</i> pretend to like them. I've noticed I'll never be part of the crowd. And I'm accepting that it may be for the best. They're a bit deluded but I guess deep down you can tell if someone is of true good intention. I guess I know a lot of people like that, I for one am one of them though I forget sometimes simply because I associate them w/ being bad.

I'm becoming a stranger to my own home now. I guess in a sense I'm avoinding being in my room at all costs. I don't feel comfortable here. I hope they notice I don't approve, but in either case I don't think it'd matter much. I'm no one to these people, I can live with that. But I guess there are a few people I have the honor to say I know. 

My Dad pointed out to me that I had a habit of this. I never realy got along w/ my older cousins or those close to my age. It's my curse to never fit in I guess. But despite the fact I didn't feel an acceptance there I was always loved by my grandmothers. I was always ""the favorite"" and I think that is what pisses people off. My Dad pointed out that even though I don't feel acknowledged by most people, those that matter care for me more than the rest. So he told me, would I rather live a life knowing true joy by means of knowing true sorrow, or to live a life numb of pain or joy. I guess it should be the first choice because despite my bitching, I feel incredibly blessed. I should be more thankful and thoughtful of that.

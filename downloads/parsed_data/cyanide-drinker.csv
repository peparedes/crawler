<P><lj-cut text=""w00t...First post""><BR>He woke up early and rubbed his eyes, already smugged with day-old liner. He rolled over and came face to face with a sleeping Frankie, his best friend, and the events of the might before came rushing back to the forefront of his brain. <BR>He had finally told Gerard how he felt and been returned with a very unexpected reaction. He hadn't yelled, or thrown punches, he hadn't kissed him and said he liked him too, he hadn't even broken down and cried at the absurdity of it all. He had simply said, ""I have to go...somewhere,"" and stood up and left. Bob had run straight to Frankie and soaked his shirt through with heart retching sobs. Frankie had been there to listen to his story and 'shh' him and tell him that everything would be okay, and to hold his hair back and rubb his back when he threw up because the force of the tears had become too much. <BR>Everyone thought that Bob was a hardass, and he did jack shit to despell that rumor. Truth of it was though, he would cry at the drap of a hat and he hated that about himself. He never let anyone see him cry, anyone but Frankie that was. Frank was his best friend, and had been si ce he had joined the band. They had just ckicked and that was it, they were doomed to be stuck with eachother forever. <BR>""Frankie...,"" He was running a hand through his hair and speaking softly.<BR>""Frankums...Sugar, wake up."" Frank's eyes fluttered open and he smiled at Bob.<BR>""Morning sunshine."" He smiled back at him and brushed his thumb over his cheek.<BR>""Morning."" Came the tired reply of the man next to him. Frankie leaned up and gave him a small peck on the lips. ""Glad to see that you're happy again.""<BR>""It feels good to know that I don't have to hide it anymore. And now what happens it in his hands. Plus, if he doesn't end up feeling the same way, I always have you, right?""<BR>He covered Bob's hand with his own. ""Coure Bobby, I'm always here for you. You know that."" <BR>Bob didn't quite know what Frank meant by those words, not really...not yet. He knew Frankie meant what he said, what he didn't know was why. Frankie had been in love with Bob sinse the first time he had seen him. He had still been working for The Used then, and he was pretty sure that Bob hadn't even noticed him. He was Bob's best friend, and if that meant that he had to listen to him gush over other boys and settel for occasionl pecks on the mouth then that is what he would do. He would settel, he would settel for knowing his innermost thoughts, and hearing about the escapades of the night before, pretending that it had been him and not some sleezie fan boy. He was okay with setteling for this. <BR>""We should get up. They might miss us."" Bob said, starting Frank from his thoughts. He had been staring at Bob unconsionsly and it had started to make him feel a bit uncomfortabel.<BR>Frankie nodded and moved to get out to fht ebed and pull on some pants. Bob followed suite and they both walked into the dining area.<BR>Everyone was sitting at teh tabel...well, Mikey and Ray were, Gee, on the other hand, was nowhere to be seen.<BR>""Um, yeah, anyone seen Gee? I kinda have to talk to him.""<BR>""Yeah."" It was Mikey, he had this look on his face as if he weren't sure if he should tell him or not, ""He took a walk so that he could have a smoke. I would guess that he is probably sitting on the steps of the venue or something.""<BR>""Thanks Mikes."" He turned to give Frankie a hug and headed out the door to find Gerard. After a few minutes of walking he found Gee sitting on the steps of the building, just as Mikey predicted. He had a half of a cigarette in his hand, a diet coke beside him, and was staring at his shoes. He almost didn't want to disturbe him, he looked so cute. He was just going to turn and leave and talk to him later, but just at that moment Gerard looked up and spotted him.<BR>""Hey. Bob!"" Bob looke up and Gerard pat the step next to him. Bob took the hint and a deep breath before heading up to sit next to the beautiful Gerard Way.<BR>""Hey Gee."" His hands were shoved into his hoodie pockets and he plopped down next to Gerard. ""Listen, I'm sorry about last night. If you don't want to talk to me for a while I'll understand. And if you dont like me that's okay too, I just thought that I would get my feelings out in the opening, you know..."" He was looking at his feet and his eyes were watering slightly.<BR>""No, Bob, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have reacted the way I did. I was jsut surprised is all."" He moved to squat infront of him. ""Bob...I like you too."" He leaned up and captured his lips in a kiss.<BR>He tensed up a bit, then realized what was happening to him. He slowly melted into the kiss and matched Gerard in his intensity.<BR>'Gerard Arthur Way is actually kissing me!!...And he initiated it. How the fuck did I get so lucky? I am going to have to tell Frankie about this ASAP! Fucker!, stop thinking about Frankie! You have Gee's tounge in your mouth right now! Focus on that dumbass.'<BR>And he did, he pushed Frankie from his thoughts, although it caused his stomach to ache a bit, and focused on the quick work that Gerard was making of his pants. <BR>""Fuck...Gerard...We are in the front of the venue!...Uhhh...fans will be...oh God...showing up soon."" He sucked in a deep breath of cold air as Gerard's tounge came in contact with his dick.<BR>Gerard smirked and flashed his eyes up at Bob. ""I don't care...are you ashamed Bob?"" He returned to his ministratons without waiting for an answer.<BR>""Uung...n-no. It-it's just..."" His words were lost in a loud moan as Gerard began humming around him, sending shivers up his body. He fisted his hands in his hair and guided his head along his shaft. He was impressed, he wasn't exactly what you would call small and Gerard was swallowing the whole of him. That sight along with the effects of Gerard's hands, one stroking him in time with his mouth and the other massaging his balls, made him cum, fast and hard. Gerard didn't even flinch, but swallowed the whole warm load and, licking his lips, moved up to kiss Bob soundly.<BR>""You like that baby?""<BR>Bob was still speachless and simply nodded his head with closed eyes.<BR>""Come on...we should probably get back to the bus."" He stood and pulled Bob up, helping him with his pants. ""I'm really glad you said what you did last night, otherwise I might not have gotten to do that."" He leaned up to kiss his cheek softly and linked their hands together. ""And I like doing that...just for the record.""<BR>He squeezed his hand slightly and pulled him closer. ""Me too."" He leaned down to kiss the top of the shorter man's head, ""About both things.""<BR>Gerard giggled as they made their way to bus. They walked on and found everyone playing videos games in the back. Ray was the only one that didn't look at the two when they walked in holding hands, seeing as he was concentrating on beating the crap out of Mikey in the game. Bob thought he saw the flicker of anger in Mikey's eyes, and jealousy in Franks...but as soon as it was there it was gone, so he dismissed it easily.<BR>Frankie walked up to them and hugged them both simultanously. He kissed Bob's cheek and grabbed his hand. He looked up at Gee and smiled, ""You mind if I steal him for a minute?""<BR>Gerard shook his head and let go of Bob's hand, but not before squeezing it lightly. He moved over to sit next to Mikey and, placing a hand in a rather dangerous spot, began whispering something in his ear that, Bob noticed, brought tears to his eyes.<BR>Frankie tugged lightly on his hand and led him outside to lean on the side of the bus.<BR>""Bobby...are you sure this is what you want?""<BR>""Of course this is what I want...why would I take the risk if it wasn't what I wanted?"" I was a little taken aback by the question. He thought Frankie, of all people, would understand.<BR>""Let me rephrase my question. Are you shure this is going to be good for you?"" He moved his hand to rub along Bob's arm.<BR>""Why would Gee be bad for me Frankie? He is straight now...no drugs, no alcohol...I don't get why you are asking me all of this."" He stiffened slightly and his throat constricted slightly.<BR>""He isn't a bad person Bobby...he is just known to...get around, whether he has a boyfriend or not. I just don't want to see you hurt baby.""<BR>""I-I can't belive you are saying this to me. He is a good person Frank! Why can't you give him, and me too, the benefit of the doubt in this. Sure he has messed up in the past, but who hasn't? And don't even try to tell me you, I know far too much about your relationships to belive that."" He pulled away from his hand a bit and turned to walk away from the other man. ""I'm going for a walk. Love you Frank."" He sounded very sad.<BR>When Frankie was sure he was a far enough distance away, he had taken off in the opposite direction, he let out a colorful string of explatives that would put a sailor to shame.<BR>""You dumbass, you fucked it up! He sat down on a bench close by, put his head in his hands, and bit back the tears slowly filling his eyes. ""I'll be there. I'll be there when Gee fucks up, and then I can show him how I really feel."" He nodded to himself and stood up to head back to the bus.<BR>It had been three weeks since they had had any real conversation. Though neither would admit it, it was tearing them apart. Bob had gotten pretty serious with Gee, or so it would seem. Mikey was constantly in a foul mood, and Frank would randomly storm out of the room if Bob and Gerard got too close. Ray seemed the only one unaffected by the whole thing. Mikey would get upset, Ray would look over at us appologeticly and chase after him, then come back and make jokes about the whole thing. <BR>Bob and Frankie had once again been left alone in the dressingroom. Gerard was taking a shower, cleaning up after earlier events, Mikey had another fit and Ray was going to look for him. Bob shifted on the couch and Frankie threw down his eyeliner.<BR>""Damnit Bob. I hate this."" He stood up and sat against the other arm of the couch. <BR>'Baby steps, not too close yet Frankie, give him time to adjust.'<BR>""Me too Frankie. I miss you. Sooo much."" He set down his magazine and looked at Frankie seriously. ""I'm sorry if Gee and me being together bothers you. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable around either of us.""<BR>""I'm sorry about saying what I did that night. I had no right to do it. I just hope that you are happy. You deserve at least that Bobby."" He crawled over to him and layed down on him like Gee always did to Ray. Bob ran one hand through his hair and rested the other on his arm.<BR>""I love you Frankums.""<BR>""I love you too Bob-Bob. More than you know."" He turned his head up to look at Bob. ""I still think you need to be careful though.""<BR>""I will. Promise."" He leaned down to give him a quick kiss and who should walk in but a very naked Gerard Way.<BR>""B-Bob, what are you doing?"" He stopped abruptly and looked close to killing someone.<BR>""Gee...Nothing, Frankie and I made up. We are friends again. I wasn't doing anything with him Gee. I promise. <BR>""Maybe I should go. Let you two talk this out.""<BR>Before Bob could say anything Gerard spoke, his tone was low and angry. ""Yeah, maybe you should let us talk about this.""<BR>Frankie left the room and Gerard walked over to where Bob was sitting and sat down on his lap. ""Bobby, Baby, what were you thinking? You know what happenes when to me when you show affection to other people."" He had one hand at the back of Bob's head and was roughly pulling at the longer hair at the top.<BR>""Yes...God, yes Gerard I get it!"" His eyes were watering from the pain and all he wanted to do was find a way to make Gerard stop.<BR>""Good, glad that is clear. So no more kissing other boys?"" Bob shook his head and Gerard moved to gently scratching his head. He relaxed onto him and nuzzled into his chest. <BR>""Bobby, why do you make me do this to you? I hate having to get like this. I hate fighting you."" He looked up to lick and nibble at Bob's jaw.<BR>""Gerard...Baby, we don't have time right now. I love you, but just not right now okay."" He was scared of what Gerard's reaction might have been, he really didn't want to do that right then...and honestly he didn't even think he would be able to even get it up, and that would have been worse than flat out refusing.<BR>""Mmmm...but look at what you did to me. Bobby, don't make me fix this all by myself."" He made a pouty face at him and rubbed Bob's palm over his erection.<BR>""Gee...Not now."" He got up and placed Gerard lightly on his feet. He turned to walk out the door but Gerard forced him back around. Before he knew what was happening he had a fist to his eye and Gerard quickly walked back into the bathroom. Bob simply walked out the door and out to find his way to the stage.<BR>Frank was waiting for him around the corner. ""Bob! What happened?!"" Even in the dim light he could see the deep purple bruise forming.<BR>""Nothing. I accidentaly hit myself. Don't worry about it Frankie."" He shyed away when Frankie moved to hug him and looked at him appologeticly when he saw the hurt on his face. ""I'm sorry."" He turned around and walked off.</P>

<P><lj-cut text=""I can't think of a catchy link title...""><BR>""Gee, I can't take this anymore. It's been 3 fucking months! People are getting suspicios, what with all the fucking bruises you leave. Damnit, I'm not going to wait much longer."" He turned around and punched the wall. ""God, I love you Gee, but I can't do it.""<BR>&nbsp;""It's not that easy Hunnie. You know as well as I do that people aren't going to accept it."" He moved to stand behind him and pushed his naked hips against his brother's. He leaned close to his ear and whispered, ""Mmmm, you know I love you. I would do anything for you, you are my baby brother after all."" He rocked his hips against him again and smiled widely when he got the moan he was waiting for.<BR>&nbsp;""Is that why you hit him Gee? Because you are angry at the fact that you can't have me like you can have him? He moaned again and pushed back against him. ""I can't believe you are already ready again. Tease me Gee...I want you to tease me."" He rested his forehead against the wall in front of him.<BR>&nbsp;""Whatever you want Mikey."" He kissed down his spine until he was on his heels and level with Mikey's ass. He gently spread the cheecks and ran his tounge along him. Mikey shuddered and Gerard took that as leave to continue. He moved his tounge in a circular motion around his enterence, adding pressure each time until he was just inside. Mikey moaned loudly and almost sank to his knees. ""Gee...I-I'm go-nna fall.""<BR>&nbsp;""Don't Mikey. Hold on."" He sank his tounge in one more time and moved to carry to the rug in the middle of the room. He laid him down gently and once again kissed his way down his body. Only this time it was to pleasure the front. He raked his nails down Mikey's sides and licked the insides of his thighs and his hips. He kissed and bit and licked everything except what his brother was dieing for him to touch.<BR>&nbsp;""Gee. It hurts. Touch me now, Gee. NOW!"" He yanked his hair and pulled his face up to it's proper place. ""Suck me Gee. Make me scream."" Gerard was only too happy to oblige. He took the tip of his cock into his mouth and sucked on it lightly. He ran his tounge over the underside of the spot where the head meets the shaft, making Mikey arch his back off the floor and moan like a whore. Gee could that he was about to cum and took his lips from around him. ""Mikey, I want to feel you inside me.""&nbsp; Mikey simply nodded and growled when Gee lubed him and sat on him quickly. He was so tight. He knew that he never let Bob fuck him, that was a job reserved only for him. He let him adjust for a moment before bucking his hips up impatiantly.<BR>Gerard moaned and began to rock agianst his brother's hips. ""Fuck Mikey...uung...soo good."" He placed one hand on Mikey's chest and grabbed his member with the other. Mikey, whose fingers were digging into Gee's hips with bruising force, looked up to see his brother touching himself. That was all it took, Mikey came hard into Gee. He let out a long loud moan and felt Gee cum soon after, spilling himself over his stomach and chest.&nbsp; Gee placed a hand on either side of Mikey's face and leaned down to kiss him.<BR>&nbsp;""Mikey I need to borrow--"" Frankie stood in the doorway with his mouth hanging open. ""What the fuck are you two doing!?!""<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;Gee quickly ended the kiss and looked up at Frankie. ""Frankie...D-Don't tell Bob. Please."" Mikey looked at Gee, shocked about how&nbsp; Gerard had reacted. He pushed Gerard off of him and stood up. ""What the fuck ever Gerard."" He stalked off into his room and slamed the door. <BR>&nbsp;""Gee! That is your brother!! Y-you aren't supposed to do that with your... brother!""<BR>&nbsp;""I know Frankie. But I love him. And not like I am supposed to love him. Shit."" He sat crossleged on the floor and put his head in his hands.<BR>&nbsp;""And your dating Bob! Gerard, I can't promise you that I won't say anything...if he asks me I will tell him. He is my best friend Gerard! And if I find out that you are continuing to do this to him, I won't wait for him to ask."" Frankie left and closed the door behind him, leaving Gerard naked and alone in Mikey's living room.<BR>&nbsp;Frankie went straight back to his appartment and sat down on the couch to think all of this out. He pulled his feet under him and left the lights off. <BR>&nbsp;""So not only is he hitting him...but he is also cheating on him with his brother? Fuck. How do I tell him that? Yeah, your boyfriend is fucking his brother behind your back, sorry...""<BR>&nbsp;""Talking to yourself again Frankie?"" Bob smiled weakly and sat down on the couch next to him.&nbsp; He held his arm gingerly and tried to hide the fact that he was in pain. <BR>Frankie looked like a deer in the headlights when he saw Bob walk in. He looked back down at his hands and then back up at Bob.&nbsp; He noticed the fresh bruise on his cheek and how he was holding his arm.<BR>&nbsp;""Did he hurt you again Bob...and don't try to lie to me, I know he is doing it. We all know he is doing it.""<BR>&nbsp;""No- he- well- I got in his way again. I knew I should have just let him alone, but he looked so sad. I just wanted to make him feel better. He loves me Frankie, I just make him angry sometimes."" He bit his lip and winced a little, it was still healing from an earlier argument with Gee.<BR>&nbsp;""Bob, you need to get out of this. I can't stand to see you like this. If I thought it would do any good I would go and kick his ass right now, but I don't want to cause you any more trouble. ""<BR>&nbsp;""I love him Frankie. It's fine. He wouldn't do it if I didn't deserve it. I just do stupid things sometimes, things that I know piss him off. It's my fault-""<BR>&nbsp;""No Bob, it is not your fault. No one sould be doing this to you. Bob you have to do something about it.""<BR>&nbsp;""No...I shouldn't even be here. He'll get angry if he finds out I am here."" He moved to stand but Frankie stoped him.<BR>&nbsp;""Bob, he is cheating on you with Mikey."" He kept his hand on his arm, but looked down at the couch.<BR>&nbsp;""You're lying. He wouldn't do that. They're brother's! That is a sick, sick lie Frankie."" He was trying to reasure himself than blame Frankie.<BR>&nbsp;""I'm not lying to you Bob! I just caught them!"" He moved closer to Bob and put a hand on his neck.<BR>Bob looked up at Frankie and started to cry. ""You know, I could have guessed he was doing it.&nbsp; He was always moaning his name in his sleep, then he was always finding reasons to go over to his apartment with out me and then hit me when he came back. I should have put two and two together. I am so stupid.""<BR>&nbsp;""You aren't the stupid one Bob. He is stupid for doing that to you. You deserve so much better than this Bob. I fucking hate him for what he is doing to you.""<BR>&nbsp;""Frankie, I am scared to go back. He has probably noticed that I have left by now. I am going to be in soo much trouble."" His head was burried in Frankie's neck and he was shanking slightly.<BR>&nbsp;""You can stay here Baby. I'll go and take care of this tomorrow morning."" He whispered it into his hair and scratched his neck lightly. ""Shhh...you're okay Baby. I won't let him hurt you anymore. I promise."" He rubbed his back and helped him to stand. ""Let's go to bed. C'mon Bobby.""<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;He followed him into his room and carefully crawled into the bed. Frankie followed soon after, told Bob to sit up so that he could help him undress. When they were both comfortable, Frankie snuggled into him and kissed his forehead.<BR>&nbsp;""Thank you Frankie.""&nbsp; He rested his head on his chest.<BR>He waited until he thought Bob was asleep he whispered an 'I love you.' into his hair. Bob smiled slightly, but didn't let Frankie know he had heard him. They both fell asleep soon after, wrapped in eachother's arms.</P>

<P>""We should get up. They might miss us."" Bob said, starting Frank from his thoughts. He had been staring at Bob unconsionsly and it had started to make him feel a bit uncomfortabel.</P>
<P>Frankie nodded and moved to get out of the bed and pull on some pants. Bob followed suite and they both walked into the dining area.<BR>Everyone was sitting at teh tabel...well, Mikey and Ray were, Gee, on the other hand, was nowhere to be seen.</P>
<P>""Um, yeah, anyone seen Gee? I kinda have to talk to him.""<BR>""Yeah.""

""Bob...I like you too."" He leaned up and captured his lips in a kiss.</P>
<P>He tensed up a bit, then realized what was happening to him. He slowly melted into the kiss and matched Gerard in his intensity.<BR>'Gerard Arthur Way is actually kissing me!!...And he initiated it. How the fuck did I get so lucky? I am going to have to tell Frankie about this ASAP! Fucker!, stop thinking about Frankie! You have Gee's tounge in your mouth right now! Focus on that dumbass.'</P>
<P>And he did, he pushed Frankie from his thoughts, although it caused his stomach to ache a bit, and focused on the quick work that Gerard was making of his pants. </P>
<P>""Fuck...Gerard...We are in the front of the venue!...Uhhh...fans will be...oh God...showing up soon."" He sucked in a deep breath of cold air as Gerard's tounge came in contact with his dick.</P>
<P>Gerard smirked and flashed his eyes up at Bob. ""I don't care...are you ashamed Bob?"" He returned to his ministratons without waiting for an answer.<BR>""Uung...n-no. It-it's just..."" His words were lost in a loud moan as Gerard began humming around him, sending shivers up his body. He fisted his hands in his hair and guided his head along his shaft. He was impressed, he wasn't exactly what you would call small and Gerard was swallowing the whole of him. That sight along with the effects of Gerard's hands, one stroking him in time with his mouth and the other massaging his balls, made him cum, fast and hard. Gerard didn't even flinch, but swallowed the whole warm load and, licking his lips, moved up to kiss Bob soundly.</P>
<P>""You like that baby?""<BR>Bob was still speachless and simply nodded his head with closed eyes.<BR>""Come on...we should probably get back to the bus."" He stood and pulled Bob up, helping him with his pants. ""I'm really glad you said what you did last night, otherwise I might not have gotten to do that."" He leaned up to kiss his cheek softly and linked their hands together. ""And I like doing that...just for the record.""</P>
<P>He squeezed his hand slightly and pulled him closer. ""Me too."" He leaned down to kiss the top of the shorter man's head, ""About both things.""<BR>Gerard giggled as they made their way to bus. They walked on and found everyone playing videos games in the back. Ray was the only one that didn't look at the two when they walked in holding hands, seeing as he was concentrating on beating the crap out of Mikey in the game. Bob thought he saw the flicker of anger in Mikey's eyes, and jealousy in Franks...but as soon as it was there it was gone, so he dismissed it easily.</P>
<P>Frankie walked up to them and hugged them both simultanously. He kissed Bob's cheek and grabbed his hand. He looked up at Gee and smiled, ""You mind if I steal him for a minute?""<BR>Gerard shook his head and let go of Bob's hand, but not before squeezing it lightly. He moved over to sit next to Mikey and, placing a hand in a rather dangerous spot, began whispering something in his ear that, Bob noticed, brought tears to his eyes.<BR>Frankie tugged lightly on his hand and led him outside to lean on the side of the bus.</P>
<P>""Bobby...are you sure this is what you want?""<BR>""Of course this is what I want...why would I take the risk if it wasn't what I wanted?"" I was a little taken aback by the question. He thought Frankie, of all people, would understand.<BR>""Let me rephrase my question. Are you shure this is going to be good for you?"" He moved his hand to rub along Bob's arm.<BR>""Why would Gee be bad for me Frankie? He is straight now...no drugs, no alcohol...I don't get why you are asking me all of this."" He stiffened slightly and his throat constricted slightly.<BR>""He isn't a bad person Bobby...he is just known to...get around, whether he has a boyfriend or not. I just don't want to see you hurt baby.""<BR>""I-I can't belive you are saying this to me. He is a good person Frank! Why can't you give him, and me too, the benefit of the doubt in this. Sure he has messed up in the past, but who hasn't? And don't even try to tell me you, I know far too much about your relationships to belive that."" He pulled away from his hand a bit and turned to walk away from the other man. ""I'm going for a walk. Love you Frank."" He sounded very sad.</P>
<P>When Frankie was sure he was a far enough distance away, he had taken off in the opposite direction, he let out a colorful string of explatives that would put a sailor to shame.</P>
<P>""You dumbass, you fucked it up! He sat down on a bench close by, put his head in his hands, and bit back the tears slowly filling his eyes. ""I'll be there. I'll be there when Gee fucks up, and then I can show him how I really feel."" He nodded to himself and stood up to head back to the bus.</P>
<P>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</P>
<P>It had been three weeks since they had had any real conversation. Though neither would admit it, it was tearing them apart. Bob had gotten pretty serious with Gee, or so it would seem. Mikey was constantly in a foul mood, and Frank would randomly storm out of the room if Bob and Gerard got too close. Ray seemed the only one unaffected by the whole thing. Mikey would get upset, Ray would look over at us appologeticly and chase after him, then come back and make jokes about the whole thing. </P>
<P>Bob and Frankie had once again been left alone in the dressingroom. Gerard was taking a shower, cleaning up after earlier events, Mikey had another fit and Ray was going to look for him. Bob shifted on the couch and Frankie threw down his eyeliner.</P>
<P>""Damnit Bob. I hate this."" He stood up and sat against the other arm of the couch. <BR>'Baby steps, not too close yet Frankie, give him time to adjust.'<BR>""Me too Frankie. I miss you. Sooo much."" He set down his magazine and looked at Frankie seriously. ""I'm sorry if Gee and me being together bothers you. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable around either of us.""<BR>""I'm sorry about saying what I did that night. I had no right to do it. I just hope that you are happy. You deserve at least that Bobby."" He crawled over to him and layed down on him like Gee always did to Ray. Bob ran one hand through his hair and rested the other on his arm.<BR>""I love you Frankums.""<BR>""I love you too Bob-Bob. More than you know."" He turned his head up to look at Bob. ""I still think you need to be careful though.""<BR>""I will. Promise."" He leaned down to give him a quick kiss and who should walk in but a very naked Gerard Way.</P>
<P>""B-Bob, what are you doing?"" He stopped abruptly and looked close to killing someone.<BR>""Gee...Nothing, Frankie and I made up. We are friends again. I wasn't doing anything with him Gee. I promise.""<BR>""Maybe I should go. Let you two talk this out.""</P>
<P>Before Bob could say anything Gerard spoke, his tone was low and angry. ""Yeah, maybe you should let us talk about this.""<BR>Frankie left the room and Gerard walked over to where Bob was sitting and sat down on his lap. ""Bobby, Baby, what were you thinking? You know what happenes when to me when you show affection to other guys."" He had one hand at the back of Bob's head and was roughly pulling at the longer hair at the top with the other.</P>
<P>""Yes...God, yes Gerard I get it!"" His eyes were watering from the pain and all he wanted to do was find a way to make Gerard stop.<BR>""Good, glad that is clear. So no more kissing other boys?"" Bob shook his head and Gerard moved to gently scratching his head. He relaxed onto him and nuzzled into his chest. <BR>""Bobby, why do you make me do this to you? I hate having to get like this. I hate fighting you."" He looked up to lick and nibble at Bob's jaw.<BR>""Gerard...Baby, we don't have time right now. I love you, but just not right now okay."" He was scared of what Gerard's reaction might have been, he really didn't want to do that right then...and honestly he didn't even think he would be able to even get it up, and that would have been worse than flat out refusing.<BR>""Mmmm...but look at what you did to me. Bobby, don't make me fix this all by myself."" He made a pouty face at him and rubbed Bob's palm over his erection.<BR>""Gee...Not now."" He got up and placed Gerard lightly on his feet. He turned to walk out the door but Gerard forced him back around. Before he knew what was happening he had a fist to his eye and Gerard quickly walked back into the bathroom. Bob simply walked out the door and out to find his way to the stage.</P>
<P>Frank was waiting for him around the corner. ""Bob! What happened?!"" Even in the dim light he could see the deep purple bruise forming.<BR>""Nothing. I accidentaly hit myself. Don't worry about it Frankie."" He shyed away when Frankie moved to hug him and looked at him appologeticly when he saw the hurt on his face. ""I'm sorry."" He turned around and walked off.<BR>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<BR>Sorry if it looks all retarded...I don't know what happened. Comments are love, and...yeah. So comment. PLEASE!!!&nbsp; And see, look, I'm not even too proud to beg. ^_^</P>

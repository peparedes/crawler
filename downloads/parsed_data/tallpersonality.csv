"event","Two lives were taken with no warning
Just terrible news heard in the morning
Two people I saw ever so often
Now empty shells resting in a coffin
If only words can define and explain
Cuz right now im too numb to feel pain
And having a hard time accepting this change
Hurts even worst knowing itll never be the same
Whyd u do it pat?! Whyd u drive so fast?!
It hurts more knowing we shared moments in the past
Good ol' St. Margarets days
Where we use to run and play
Now ur gone and all i can do is pray
I miss u too mel, who i knew so well
You were my 8th grade dinner dance date
Now im dressed all black walking to ur wake
Makes me question why this had to be ur fate
Whos fault is it?! Who made the mistake?!
Someone answer my questions for God's sake
Im breaking down and tears burning my cheek
Words cant explain and its getting harder to speak
Two star crossed lovers
No more need to suffer
Take care of each other
I found out today at 7am
Let both ur souls rest AMEN."

""don't let hate and anger be ur motivation. they are self defeating. Look, things bad that happend in the past teach you and learn from them.

"event","Why do most of the time we fight our impulses? When we say someones impulsive it means they lack any control and do irrational shit. What do our impulses tell about us? What if our impulses are messages from our past life desperately trying to make us do sumthing we missed out and regreted it terribly? Everytime we ignore the feeling, we repeat the cycle having to live it again wishing we did sumthing else. How many times have u met someone u werent planning to meet but glad because they were worth the while and the only thing u wanted was to see them smile? How many times have u gotten involved in sumthing u knew wasnt right but came out with a better understanding about urself. Its true being impulsive gets u into a whole rack of bullshit ud rather not deal with, but wheres the fun if theres no risk. A great thing holds a great price. As we grow older, we learn manners, to be polite, ""use good judgement"" in making our decisions, we plan, conform to the demands of society, become predictable, inevitably living a boring life only waiting for death to save us. I say be impulsive, go for broke and deal all ur chips in. Kiss that girl with the green eyes and nice smile, who held your eyes the whole night at the party. Hit that kid that talks out his ass and been taking an expired prescription of oxygen. I mean we only get to live life one day at a time. Why live another day of routine when u can wake up with no idea where u'll be by the end of the night. A whole lifetime's worth of experience is waiting for you. Question is if you got the balls to take it."

 Time.....

the past the present the future all intertwined in a system we call time, sumthing we cant see cant touch but real in the mind, the past repeats itself so in a way it rewinds and through experience we learn to love and hate, from our sucess and mistakes, from times we accelrated and times we pulled the brakes, from times we said yes and from times we said no, from times u did the opposite cuz ur boy said so, time never ramains its always on the go, so we learn from experience like our fathers did long ago, but decisions made follow like a shadow, and memories can either lift your soul or hurt your heart, make u beleive man is doomed cuz we dying from the start, or feel that life is beautiful bcuz its limited, and the possibilities are limitless, so i stop turn around and relfect on the steps that got me where i am right now, and learn to be wise takes a whole life time, the more i learn the more i understand, what it takes for a boy to be a man, one my father can be proud of, one my son can look up to, ive laughed cried lived and even died, times i didnt make it still glad that i tried, a compettitive contestant in this game we call time....

 Untitled

So many masked faces, a murdered soul wit no evidence no traces, a population worried only to find their own places, my only answer found in a bottle full of self hatred, good memories help but my memories fading, waiting for sumthing good to come along so im stuck here bleeding while im waiting, i cant say imma explode cuz i no longer have fuel, only 5 bucks to get a buzz n kill memories and invite misery, and 5 more to sell ur soul to the devil, everyone digs their own grave wit their personal ''shovel'', quick getaways sell dope to kids and get paid, an innocent life sacrificed for da survival of a corrupted society, modern day canabalism, Cane killed Abel, which means mans capable of backstabbing, even from da days of Eve and Adam, now we got Bush Sadam and Bin Laden, good ones get assasinated and we're left with so much hatred, a world of misdirected youths, we dont know how to live rightious only how 2 speak da truth, and truth is realities shitty so kids inhale, one way ticket 2 hell

eyes blood shot and glistening signs i should stop but my minds not listening everydays a gift to do right but still i sin again, emotions fading into a bliss euphoric state, a twisted way to meditate, mind fucking wit the demons that haunt me throughout the seasons, and i danced wit the evils in this world, its making me sick to my stomach i wanna hurl, but i choose to hold it in and let it eat away at my chest till my last breath, its been a while since i cried but so many times i have teared liquor, asking myself ''is that u Victor'', no cure for the disease thats killin my future, im dying inside but its all good cuz the girls say im gettin cuter, always too cool to give a fuck, just risk everything for nothing pushing my luck, i stood for many things and in the process fell hard i cant get up, no need to speak and make peace only get buck and snuff that punk, never was a freind just seen him as my enemy, and i know this mentalilty can bring the end of me, but i cant stop, only continue this process like a clock tick tock tick tock, times running out but i choose to drown in depression singing the blues of my hearts scars beating my chest giving it bruises, lifes a contact sport and everybody loses

2 poems i wrote on different times but wanted to post up....i love life and im not depressed...i just think too much sometimes"

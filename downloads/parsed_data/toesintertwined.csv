i need a roomate for the end of july. otherwise ill end up living alone and commiting suicide because ill be so lonely. fuck. that would suck eh?

so ive decided to wear kevin's ""promise"" ring again. promise my ass. but anyways. it reminds me not to let myself get played. i like that something i was so bitter about, i turned it around to be positive. damn im awesome. 

ive decided its time for me to get a new boyfriend. all i want is respect and to be able to trust the person. seems easy but its turning out to be not so much.

"event","saw kevin today. 

it went well. he hugged me for too long though, and wouldnt let go for like awhile. then he was about to leave and asked me for another hug...

ahh i dont know how i feel about this. i want to be friends. minus the long hugs which leave me breathless and pondering.

he smelled so good. i tried not to inhale through my nose.
and his lips looked so good i couldnt look at his face.

today i did a very good job at disgregarding my thoughts and feelings, as long as i can keep that up and push them away, we can definatley be friends.

and im excited for that."

"event","i realized yesterday that im not doing so good.

i saw kevin at target with his new girlfriend. i shouted oh fuck and hid. when tricia made sure the coast was clear we went and looked at the exercise clothing. and then they walked toward us. i couldnt look. i didnt want to see her, i didnt want to see them together. i wanted to run and hide in the bathroom. but im not 12 anymore. so tricia later told me she waved. maybe his girlfriend had heard how much of a crazy bitch i was and wanted to see what i looked like. i would have wanted the same. but, i wasnt ready to see him yet. esspecially with her. 

how long will this hurt for?"

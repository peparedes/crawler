"event","Well Jeff and I bit the bullet tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been looking at buying a mp3 player for a while now. &nbsp;I&nbsp;have a mp3 player sort of in my older xm radio portable player. &nbsp;However, it has issues with volume, size, and what it can do.&nbsp; Jeff got a mobicube a while ago, but he has been looking for a mp3 player that could hold more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

We had been looking at a zune initially, but I kept going back and forth between a zune and an ipod.&nbsp; Jeff wanted a zune because it was different than what everyone else had. &nbsp;We watched the price for a long time and still were undecided.&nbsp; I was excited to hear the Sept 9 ipod announcement, but was sad that there wasn't anything exciting announced&nbsp; - for me anyways.&nbsp; In the end we ended up on apple's refurbished ipod site and bought two refurbished 80 gig apple classics.&nbsp; Silver for me and black for Jeff.&nbsp; This is my first refurb buy, but after doing a little research I actually feel more comfortable buying refurbished since they have someone at apple checking it to make sure it's ok before they send it out. &nbsp;

So anyway - I'm excited to enter the world of apple ipods."

Since my last entry we have moved into our town home. Things are going well with that. I think we have taken better care of the place than the guy who used to own it. We have fixed the joist in the basement, cleaned the carpets and the gutters, and we are about to get a new door. Jeff also put in a ceiling fan in our bedroom. I love it.

This week we have had Milo for a year now. Seems like we have always had him. He's lost weight since we have moved. He has more room to run and he has stairs to run up and down. Good Milo."

"event","Yea for positive things happening. We had our inspection today at the town house. I was excited to get back into it again. It's so much more space than our current two bedroom apartment. They did find termites though ;( Luckily they found it now though. This way we don't have to pay for it, the owners do. Maybe this will delay our closing date which means we might have less time that we will have a mortgage and have to pay rent on our apartment.

I applied for another job today at the local university. I Interviewed for a different position last monday. If I got either of them it would be totally awesome. I hope one of them does come through. I should hear about the one I already interviewed with early this coming week. I'm not sure about the other one, the job ad closes this monday. So maybe I will hear if I got an interview or not within next week.

We really liked it, but I wasn't sure about a few things like the size of the living room and the fact that it was close to a not so nice town home complex. However, I couldn't get it out of my mind. So we are going to see it again tomorrow after work. Unfortunately, I have to work late that day. There is another town home on the same street that is an end unit we are also trying to see. If things work out, we may put a bid on one. I'm excited and wish tomorrow night would hurry up."

What have I been up to recently? I don't remember exactly where I was the last time I posted, but I have a general idea. I graduated from grad school, got engaged, went from being in a long distance relationship to living down the street from him, got married, moved in with him, and now we have been married for one year today. That was definitley a mouthful. I intend to update my interests and try to get back into things at LJ. I hope everyone is doing good."

"event","Well OD was working. But something happened when I signed in this time. I clicked on sign in and it did something weird. Its hard to explain. Like it opened a white screen and took a really really long time to load. I then tried opening it on a new window and it came up but it was messed up (ie. couldn't sign notes with my name and such) so I logged out and in again and its still messed up. I think rebooting would fix it but I really don't feel like closing everything, logging off, rebooting and then opening everything up again. So I'm gonna post on here. Sorry, enough about OD for now.

Today I did accomplish cleaning my apartment, yea me. I slept in which was nice after having to get up butt early for comps the day before an then cleaned my entire apartment. I even vacummed which is amazing for me. I love the noise it makes when it sucks something up. I feel more happy with things now that they are less messy. What else did I do today? Watched crappy tv - I watched part of Born in East LA with Cheech Marin, took a nap, watched the Emmy's, talked to J and my parents an played some play station. The Emmy's weren't that exciting but I liked the one joke about the commercial they play on tv about the pill for men. One of the lines is if you have an erection for four hours please contact your doctor. Every time I hear that I crack up and I wonder if anyone else notices it. Gary Shandling actually made a joke about it, so yea for that.

Tomorrow should be pretty slow, but I'm not complaining. Since comps are done for now I'm going to see how much I can get done on the data entry I'm doing for my assistantship. I hate qualitative data, blech. Maybe I will also do some work on my lit review. Hopefully the lady from the company I may work for will call too *fingers crossed*"

An then something else happens and I come back here. So we will see what happens. Im going to try to keep up here now that I know a few people who are reading me. Im also a bit annoyed at OD. I know he's not done fixing the site but I have been having problems that no one else seems to be having and its really annoying. I have tried a lot of other websites out there and I'm pretty picky. This is one of the few sites besides OD that I like. Though, I'm not used to it yet. I recently just cancelled one of the new journals I created to try out a site. Some random person left a link to a really gross picture in my comments.

Anyways, took my comprehensive exam today for grad school. Boy am I glad thats over. I think I did reasonably well, I know I didn't totally bomb it. However, I don't know what I got on each class an if I will have to retake any of them. I really really hope not. It was 200 multiple choice, with 20 questions for statistics and research, and 40 questions for the other four classes.

Watched Miss America tonight. I wanted Miss Louisiana to win the whole thing. Was annoyed that she didn't. I'm also going to watch the Emmy's tomorrow night. I miss J, I  wish he was online. I would call him now if it wasn't so late.

Not sure what I'm going to do tomorrow. I should clean my apartment, but I don't know if that will happen or not."

Worked today. Was pretty good but was long. Im sleepy now. Need to get ready for bed since Im also working tomorrow. Only one test tomorrow though :D

I got my cd's from amazon today! Yea! I got the Classic Disney 5 CD Box :D I am very psyched. Unforunately I have only been able to listen to one of the cd's so far.

Things are going great with J. We are really talking marriage now. He even said that he was thinking about moving up the time we will get engaged from may when I graduate to the middle of the year sometime. He has just been talking about it a lot more and it makes me happy. I was grumpy an tired today at work and I just started thinking about it and it put a smile on my face :d

I can't believe that summer is nearing the end. I sent in my security deposit so I can get the address to my apartment. Haven't heard back yet. I really wish they would hurry up so I could order my furniture.

"event","Sometimes I need take a step back from the game I play. I get way too into it and I don't pay attention to the things I need to get done. Specially when things don't go the way I had planned. I obsess over them until I can fix them which usually means I'm thinking about them during what I have to do during the day. I have almost fixed most of what I wanted to in my game so hopefully I will be less manic soon. I just feel kinda dumb getting so into something that isn't really real.

My throat has been really dry recently. I don't know if its because I closed the air vent in my bedroom because the house is sooo cold or if Im getting a cold. It stinks when I have to talk all day at work. I think Ill bring some losangues tomorrow. I can't believe that I only have three weeks left of work. I guess its my bosses fault for waiting so long to get me started. I feel like I'm just getting comfortable an good at my job. Oh well. I think I may try working just saturdays at different location of the place down at school. Will nice to get a little extra cash.

J will be coming down on friday so yea for that. I'm looking forward to seeing him. He will also be coming down two weeks later when I have a lot of family at the house to meet some family that he hasn't. He has been saying that I will have to come the next time he visits his grandparents. Guess we are really ""meeting the family"".

I exercised today for thirty minutes on the treadmill. I have been trying to exercise to get the last ten pounds off. Its hard to motivate myself. I really wasn't in the mood today to do it but I did. My legs are really stiff an kinda sore right now. Hopefully they will be better tomorrow.

Ok I have to get myself of the game now and go to sleep so I can function tomorrow. Have to be at work at 9:30am bleh. I like sleeping."

I still need to make sure it sounds good and I got all the APA stuff right but so far so good. It doesn't seem like as much work as I thought it would at the beginning so yea for that. Another thing about the paper - I wrote about it in my other journal and I got nine notes on that entry. Only one about getting the acceptance. Why only one? Its not like I was looking for much, just a woo hoo or a congrads. I don't get it. Makes me feel like renewing there even less.

Tomorrow I get to go back to work. Oh boy. I know I should be upset that I am not getting the hours I wanted - ie. at least 30-40 hours but I enjoy sleeping in and being able to do what I want.

I have been waiting and waiting for the longest time to hear back from a national honor fraternity in my area about a journal article I submitted to them back in the second week of feb. I FINALLY heard back from them tonight. I was offered provisional acceptance with revisions. Yea! I asked my mother and my boyfriend an they said that most articles that get that will eventually be accepted. I read what they want me to revise and its a lot. An they want the revisions done by august 31st! I don't move back down to school until August 16! Looks like I have some work to do. The bad thing is I have been really bad and haven't done any preparing for my thesis either this summer. Blah. Guess I just need to get off my butt and do it. But yea! I may be published even if this issue is just an online publication. It is still peer-reviewed.

This weekend when I went into an asian groccery store I bought a bamboo plant because I have always thought they looked cool and have thought about buying one. It was a great price and it had a neat container with a chinese man sitting on the side. I brought him home and he's growing great. I hope I can keep up the watering and everything. Im really bad with plants. I always start with the best of intentions and then end up forgetting to water it and end up killing them. I hope this one will be better cause its neat looking. I named him General Tso. Yes, I named my bamboo plant ;D

I have been a part of two different research days. One for all departments where I gave an oral presentation and one just for our department where I did a poster presentation.

I just got my masters thesis topic approved ;D

After I finish this semester I will have all my core classes done and will only have my thesis and electives left to take.

I turn 25 in two weeks!

I can't believe that I will be moving out of my apartment soon. Its nuts, I feel like I just moved in.

Im in the process of trying to find a job back home. One place is going to call me at the beginning of the week to set up an interview. *fingers crossed*

I am on a slighty different version of the South beach diet. So far I have lost 20lbs ;) I only have ten more to go. I haven't seen my parents since before I started so Im excited to see what they say when they see me.

Our last day of classes is this coming monday and then I have my two exams the next monday and tuesday.

The new semester has started, I can't say much though because I only have had one class of each. This semester seems easier than last though. I can't say for sure.

Im trying to be social, but its not really working at the moment. Lets hope that picks up as the semester does.

Uh what else.. What do I do in my spare time? I watch tv a lot, chat on aim with friends, knit (though I haven't in a while), play games online *shrugs* If anyone has any other ideas to keep me sane feel free to leave a note :)

I can't believe that Im already in my second semester and when this semester is over (yea I know Im jumping the gun, its only the first week) I will be done with half of my masters program already and there will only be a year left. Im trying really hard to enjoy the process and being independent but I keep yearning for when I'm done, when I have the degree and can get a kick ass job and move to be local again with Jeff.

Im trying really hard not be as lazy as I have been. Ive gotten into a bad cycle of staying up till 1:30am and then sleeping in late and then not getting started in my day till around noon. That screws up my whole day and I feel like I have gotten nothing done this whole big weekend.

After getting on the wrong one I ended back where I started. I later realized I hadn't gone far enough. Found it finally, got on I-95 and was good to go. I made it home before my mom was expecting me ;)

Had a pretty good thanksgiving. Got lots of new clothes, got my hair cut, got to see my parents an grandma and bubbie. Got my car inspected and got some new stickers for it. Did absolutely no work. Celebrated my parents wedding anniversary and ate lots of good food. Unforunately, the whole visit I was thinking about my drive home and worrying about it.

I did ok I think, as I made it home. Did the whole 95 thing great and got off on the right exit. However, I forgot to make the turn to totally get off so I ended up getting back on 95 going the same way. So I had to keep driving till I found another exit and stupidly got back on going south again. I was so annoyed. So I had to keep going to find another exit an then went north until my exit. Then made my way home. Though I was running low on gas so I was pretty nervous that I would run out of gas in the sticks. Made it home with only one other screw up. Now I get to do it again in two weeks.

Got home at 2:30ish, unpacked the car, an put away the perishables and plugged in my computer. Called mom and Jeff that I got here ok and then went on the internet quickly to check my grades. I got a 44/50 on the paper I wrote in three days. I guess an 88 isn't too bad. I wish I had gotten a bit higher but I can't complain too much. We had to do oral presentations on our paper in class. I can't believe she made us do it the night we came back from break. I was in no mood to do mine, I was still anxious from my trip home. Thank goodness the students in our class grade them an not the teacher. I think everyone just gave everyone 10s which is good.

I feel so out of it. I have to get back in the schedule of things quick though. I have a research proposal due friday, and my first final on monday. Then I have a final paper, a take home final exam and then my research final culminating on the 11th. Then I get to go home again and have three weeks off. Whew. Hopefully it will all go smoothly and I won't stress too much.

Oh an for any of my undergrad friends reading this I will be in the area visiting Jeff the week of December 15 I think if any of you guys want to do anything.

Hope everyone had a wonderful thanksgiving."

I really needed it though after working all weekend on my paper. I think its impressive though, writing a 12 page paper in one weekend. I guess Ill see how impressive it was when I get my grade back.

I have joined a lot of communities on here which is fun. LJ has sooo many people that you can find a community about anything you can think of. Most of the ones I joined don't post much so its manageable. I just have to get used to how people reply to comments. They reply right underneight the note being left. I am used to the other site I use where they post their reply on your journal. So I have to make sure they are on my friends list or I remember their name so I can see if they replied back.

Nothing else is really new. I go home for thanksgiving this coming tuesday. Im pretty nervous about driving it. It will be my first time on the highway driving five hours by myself.

I started writing today an Im on page 8. Not bad for a days work. Only a couple of more pages tomorrow an then I can start formatting it and all that other fun stuff. When I get back from thanksgiving break Ill only have a final paper and exam in one class, a small presentation and a final in another class, and a proposal which Ive already done some stuff on and an exam left. Than christmas break. An unlike my undergrad years there is no winter session so I have a whole month off. Will be weird but nice.

What else.. Ive been trying to get out more and it hasn't been happening all that often. Need to try harder. I feel like Ive lost touch with some of my undergrad friends an would like to catch up with them again. Specially the ones who have lj's here *hint hint*  I wonder if any of you guys will actually read this.

Not much else going on. I should probably go to bed soon so I can get up and write more of my paper but I just had some uh-oh oreos so Im not tired. Those things are sooo sugary. Have to go to walmart tomorrow to pick up some things and Im hoping they sell printer cartridges because I really need one.

Thats all for now. Sorry Im not that exciting."

"event","I should be in bed.  I like my bed.  Very comfy, but I'm being stubborn.  Felt like writing an entry so here you go.

Im tired.

Isabel didn't do anything to my place.  I kept electricity the whole time.

There was one girl not in class though cause she couldn't get out of her town because there was too much water.

I had a meeting this morning at 10am about one of my research projects an it went well.

I finally bought my fathers bday gift.  His bday is tomorrow, he is gonna be 60.

I didn't finish reading all of the chapters for class tonight.  Three out out of four isn't bad.

Class was kinda boring tonight.  I really have to find a good way to study for the midterm.

We got our papers back.  I got a 15/15 Woo hoo! 100% Average though we only have one grade

I got my password back from an email I lost from a nice person on the phone, thank you!!

Tomorrow I get to post a beginning level marriage an fam class exam online for the students

I don't have any classes tomorrow! PJ Day!

Depending on how soon I get the exam info I will try to do the IRB class an get it over with

I called Kim on the phone and it was nice, I plan to do it again.

Im a dork.  I bought a hole puncher at walmart and its making me happy.

I stayed up way too late last night organizing stuff with my hole puncher

I've been playing games at www.gameshownetwork.com with an online friend

I stink at Phrase Frenzy and Lingo but they have the whammies game which I rock at.

I may be going in with Jeff to get a webcam, Im so psyched.  I have no patience.

I need to get a study routine down.  Im good at papers, studying for exams I'm not

Im running out of things to say

Its about time to hit the bed an listen to leno on the radio, yes the radio.

I don't have a tv in my bedroom

However I can pick up nbc on my radio for some reason

I need noise to fall asleep too and nbc is great

I got home early from class tonight so I got to watch the second half of 7th heaven

I doubt I will be that lucky with friends.  What happened to scrubs?

I now have two meetings on two mornings, mondays and wendesdays at 10am.

I love being able to sleep in on the other days.  One good thing about night classes.

Im just rambling now.

Think Im going to go to sleep now.  Buenos noches y adios."

"event","I'm updating, I'm updating!  A friend said that I hadn't updated in a long time and that I needed too so here I am. ;)  Whats new with me?  Not much.  Just trying to get used to work.  This week is my first week that I have all of my classes, my assistantship, and helping my advisor with her research project.  It's interesting trying to figure out when I want to work on each thing to make sure it all gets done.  Even so I have been watching too much of the Family Channel.  I love their corny movies like See Jane Date that I have seen three times and the Au Pair and then The Brendon Lenoard Show and Seventh Heaven in the evening.

Im getting to know the people in my classes a bit more and figuring out who I fit with the most.  I haven't done anything with anyone outside of class yet but I hope that will come sometime soon.  We shall see.  Even in high school I had troubles with that. I had friends at school but we never went out and did stuff outside of school.  *shrugs*  I went to the Hillel cook out an had fun I guess.  Stayed for about an hour.  I felt really old.  There were a lot of freshman.  I knew the freshman would be young but I didn't think about how young.  I was talking to this one girl who went to a high school sort of near where I did.  She was like yea I graduated high school in 2002.  Ohy.  I got along with this one guy pretty well but turns out he is a sort of professor.  OH well.  I may give Hillel one more chance but we will see.  I also went to a softball/pot luck thing with my department.  That was pretty fun. There was lots of food and doggies to pet.  The people in my department are more my age.  I didn't play softball but I had fun watching.  We played against this group of indians that were just learning how to play an we got our butts kicked.

What else...We got out of class early tonight.  Class started at 6 an we got out at 7 because there was a peace vigil down by the library.  I didn't go though.  Instead I went groccery shopping and then called Jeff.  I have been shying away from all the coverage about 9/11.  I guess my way of coping is not listening to stuff about it.  I rather get things done then go to a peace vigil.  *shrugs*

Tomorrow (Friday) is Jeff's an I anniversary :)  We will be together for four years then.  I can't believe its been that long.  Doesn't seem that long to me.  I think we are doing pretty good with the extra distance now.  I like to think about what things will be like in two years if I did move up there to be local with him again :)

I've got two research projects just starting.  Im trying to figure out my exact research questions on both of them.  One is my advisors project, working on observing play in children.  I'm not sure of my exact question but I've sort of got a general idea.  For my assistantship I had come up with an awesome question but I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it now because my prof doesn't want to collect the research.  He wants to use a already collected data set which is annoying.  That means I have to confirm my question to whatever data I am using.  Blah.  Oh well.

Thats all for now. I can't believe that I will have been living in this apartment for a whole month next week.  I think I'm doing pretty good living on my own.  Even though I'm not very social at all and I'm having trouble getting into writing papers an such.  Hopefully that will all improve soon."

"event","So I finally had my ""real"" orientations today.  The ones that are actually in my department and mean something.  My first one was for people with assistantships.  All we did was fill out forms to make sure we get paid.  Thats a good enough reason for me ;)  Even though I'm not getting paid much at all, any little bit helps.

The second orientation was pretty cool.  It was for everyone who was new to the program.  We had to go around and introduce ourselves.  We had to say our name, where we are from, what area of the dept we are in an what we hope to get out of the program. I had no idea.  I wanted to say to get a better job and more money.  *grins* I know I couldn't say that.  So I just made up a bunch of stuff about wanting to know more about research and find out the area I wanted to focus on.  This one professor, nice but very loud, was like yea! she is gung ho research!  I was like uhm, ok.  Everyone laughed though so I guess thats ok.  Later on though when one of the second years was talking to the prof I am going to do my assistantship with she was like ""Is she your grad assistant?  She's the one who is gung ho research, isn't she.  You hit the jack pot."" Uhm ok... I hope I can live up to that.

When the professors were introducing themselves I was actually interested in two of the professors research projects.  I'm probably going to be involved in at least one (my advisor's) and I emailed the other professor to find out more about it.  While talking to my advisor about her research she said that since it is so new I could incorporate a little piece about something I'm interested in if I wanted to and then maybe use it as a thesis.  Wow.  Already talking about that on my first day.  But its cool. I can really see things coming together.  I'm also going to be joining the Graduate Student Association for my department.  Having that on my resume would kick some ass.  Wouldn't hurt to get a little money to travel and meet some people along the way.  They are having a pot luck dinner and a softball game next week.  I'm soooooo bad at softball, but can't hurt to go anyways.

So I had a good day and I'm feeling good about things now.  Not as scared as before.  An I talked to two people.  One girl who is in almost all of my classes before the first orientation and I finally met the other girl I had been emailing. She is really nice.  So yea for that. I just hope everything else continues to go well and I can keep up with all my school work!"

"event","Wow I actually have people reading my LJ.  Makes you want to actually write in it.  So what is new with me so far?  Not much.  I don't have my first orientation until this Saturday.  That orientation is for everyone in the entire university that is a graduate student.  So it should be rather large.  Hopefully it will be somewhat interesting.  Then on tuesday I have two more orientations.  The first one is for people with assistantships and then the second one immediately after that is for new graduate students in my department.  I hope to meet the most new people at this one but I'm open to meeting anybody. It's pretty quiet here not knowing anyone.  I thought about getting my books ahead of time since I have the time to read, but decided against it.  I know that some professors like to not use the books that are on the list so I wanted to wait to make sure I don't get the wrong thing or anything.  However, I may end up getting them anyways.  I have two books I could read but I'm just not into reading them at the moment.  

I think I will invest in a lawn chair though.  I live on the second floor.  Everyone who lives on the second floor (only about four apartments per grouping) has this little patio/deck thingy where you can sit out on (though everyone's front door opens up to it) and has steps to get to the ground.  It would be really nice to sit out on because it has a roof so you are shielded from the weather and you can sit out and watch everything and be outside still or you could just read a book and enjoy the fresh air.  I dunno.  I'm still thinking about it.

So while I don't have much to do I have just been getting things ready.  I filled out my planner (yes I know I'm nerdy, but I have always loved doing that), did some groccery shopping, got a blockbuster card and rented What A Girl Wants, and have just been playing on the net.  I guess I should live up the time when I'm not swamped with school work and such but I just wish these days would go a little bit quicker."

Very nice quality, I was very surprised.  My parents are here till Sunday and then after that I am all alone.  I hope that I can do it.  I'm still pretty nervous being away from everyone I know and not knowing the area too well or many people.  Hopefully orientation will start soon and I will get to know people.

Im pretty excited because I just found out two people from college have journals here!  Maybe that will motivate me more to update this.  If not I at least can keep up with them more than I have been."

"event","Im now on christmas break.  Shows how much I have been writing in here.  Its my time to resubscribe to my other site.  I was pretty sure I was going to resubscribe but not I'm not 100% positive.  Its probably because I keep reading all of the entries people keep posting about being pissed at the diary master for not responding to their emails or crys for help or the site being down or their diaries not working.  I haven't had any of these problems but many around me have.  I have met a lot of wonderful people on that site which  will ultimately make me resubscribe to the site but it makes me wonder.  Will I log on the day after I give them more money that the site is going down because of all the people bitching at the diary master?  They actually reported him to the BBB! I can't believe it.  It has been a great site to me and I haven't found another site like it (live journal is the closest to it).  I have been on that site so long that I am not used to LJ.  Maybe if I actutally posted more an met more people on here I would learn to like this place but I dunno.  Doesn't help that all LJ accepts online is Paypal. So who knows.  It is only $20, the amount of one good dinner out with friends.  I guess thats not much to spare."

"event","I am tired.  First day back to work after the thanksgiving break.  My bed is calling but I wanted to write a little something in here first.  I deleted the few entries I had in here because I thought I was going to use this journal for a different purpose.  Though it didn't work out.  So I'm just gonna hang onto this journal an see what happens.

What happens you ask?  What happens on the other site I journal at.  There are many rumors going around over there.  Rumors about the site going bankrupt or just wondering how long the site will be available.  You have to literally throw around some pixie dust, turn around four times will doing back flips and then say some gobldy gook after seeing a shooting star to actually get the dude that runs the site to answer an email.  There is no support coming in from the site.  Its just diarists helping diarists.  Its insane.  I will have to renew my subscription in a month or so.  Right now not sure what to do.  Guess time will tell.  An right now its my bed time.  Night all."

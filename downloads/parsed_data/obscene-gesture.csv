"event","well i havent written in a while and seeing how my life has so many emotions running around at the same time i might as well get out how i feel before i kill something or someone (namely pat or lucies sister). well lets see here ok breif over view me and lucie lived in the car for two months then met this girl and stayed with her for a month then she lost her apartment and we moved up to pats to fix up the motor home two months and a thousand dollars later oh what a suprise we cant get it hmmmm (pondering) anyone suprised out there if so feel free to say so (crickets), well anyways so we move down to ludies sisters house to help her out with watching her kids only on the weekdays to 4 pm and she was going to pay us 300 a month well we started having to watch her kids all of the time all night long and on the weekends and to top it off we had to get rid of our puppies. so we were totaly being taken advantage of and really depressed we had to give our puppies to jamie to watch for us. well then jamie couldnt keep the puppies (which i totaly understand) and so we ended up having the puppies here for about a week and her sister making her coments and shit and fucking being mean to them. so we left and moved back up to pats and we were there for three whole days and all it was, was lucie remember when we had sex here or did that with sex or can we have sex, or would ask me if he could have sex with lucie and tons of bullshit. so lucies sister called and asked us if we could please come back down and that all we had to do to with the kids was take them to school because she finally got the second one in so we asked her if our kids (puppies,red and eros) were allowed there and she said for a while because she is planning on geting a house to rent instead of navy housing and then we call her back and tell her that well do it and then she says ok well the puppies arent allowed anymore. how cool huh oh yeah they can come until you decide to come and then they cant.but we have no other choice to go to her house pat wants us out we want us out and there is no where else we can stay to get on our feet to get our own place. so we have to ask brittny to take our puppies in for a month(thank you so much) and so now we are here at her sisters and the whole oh can you watch them this saturday and crap is starting all over again. i fucking hate this shit i am so fucking god damn pissed off at my fuking life i just wish it would end i miss my dogs i love them so much and they are just like my kids. i fucking wish pat would be tortured and then murdered. i wish that everyine would stop fucking me and lucie over because i will tell you what i am so sick and tired of getting on our feet and then oh whoops your back to being homeless again. i swear i just want to pitch a tent some where and get a job and save up money and have my wife and my kids with me and you know what i dont think i could ask for much more.you know i hear all the time people bitching about things and you know what they dont know how easy they really have it."

You are passive and unobtrusive most of the time, but when you do wake up to reality you've got quite a bit to say. Even if it's pure nonsense. You may be cute, but that doesn't prevent you from being quite a twerp.

"event","its amazing when you look back on your life and when you were younger you had so many dreams and you thought you where going to grow up and be so many things. and then you grow up and so many things have changed, no longer innocent and thoughts of sex and survival have replaced the thoughts of hope and the sence of safety. i have often wondered if there is a perfect life and dream. i find myself trying to find stability, and acceptance, i started a life of patriarch so early and now i find myself in a maze of misery. to think of how loving someone can take away the love you were raised with. they turned their eyes away so now i know what you are really like, and i miss you even though you like to watch me suffer. i try so hard to preserve my sanity. how long i have to stand inside this hell i do not know. i remember when i was young i would hold my fathers hand and now i hold the death of our exsistance. i look now at my friends and all i see is their shadows as they grow and go. why we never stay the same i no longer know. but i do know that i am sick of the thinly veiled intolerance. i said i love why cant remember your love for me too?"

 Music :Klaus Meine
 Lyrics:Klaus Meine

 I folow the Moskva
 Down to Gorky Park
 Listening to the wind of change
 An August summer night
 Soldiers passing by
 Listening to the wind of change
 
 The world is closing in
 Did you ever think
 That we could be so close, like brothers
 The future's in the air
 I can feel it everywhere
 Blowing with the wind of change
 
 Take me to the magic of the moment
 On a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow dream away
 in the wind of change
 
 Walking down the street
 Distant memories
 Are buried in the past forever
 I folow the Moskva
 Down to Gorky Park
 Listening to the wind of change
 
 Take me to the magic of the moment
 On a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
 With you and me
 Take me to the magic of the moment
 On a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow dream away
 in the wind of change
 
 The wind of change
 Blows straight into the face of time
 Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell
 For peace of mind
 Let your balalaika sing
 What my guitar wants to say
 
 Take me to the magic of the moment
 On a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
 With you and me
 Take me to the magic of the moment
 On a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow dream away
 in the wind of change"

i am writing this as a fair well i want you to know that i do love you and i will never forget you but i have to say good bye because i can not be asscociated with someone who lies to me and will betray us for money from pat.  pat told me and lucie everything that you told him that day and the only person who could have told him is you. and you know what you act like you did some great thing by letting us use melanies car but it was her car you couldnt let us use it unless she gave the ok, but dont get me wrong i do appreciate the fact you asked her to let us borrow it in a time of desperation. i also wanted to thank you very much for helping us out with the money when we were so tight and remember if you ever do need a hundred dollars we will give it to you and not expect it back especially if you are in a tight situation. can i ask you a question why have you lied to melanie so much? and why have you lied to us? but it doesnt matter because it is in the past i want you to know that i hope one day you can realize that there doesnt have to be so much drama in this world (if only pat could realize this). i also hope that one day you can be happy, i hope you can one day realize you must first make yourself happy within yourself you need to stop depending on every person that comes into your life to make you happy. you do not get into a relationship and say they complete me you should already be completed when you get with them and they should be hand in hand with you not holding you up like a crutch.  i hope that one day you can find yourself and what you truly want because the way you act now you know barely anything of yourself only what you wish you could be ( but you arent). do not think that i am trying to attack you because i am not as a friend i am trying to tell you something in love so that one day we can be true friends with out lies and secrets. and james lucie told me everything that you told her when she was over seas and you know what to say things like that you are no friend at all you had underlying selfish idiations in that situation that i dont even want to think about. and if you think me being to sinsitive towards what your mother did to me then you are a silly ignorant little child with no grasp on reality and what pain is or drugged up pain is all about. your mother is no better than my mom and it brought back old pains and created knew ones. why do you think it is you can continuously talk shit about me to my fiance and expect her not to tell me? are you that nieve? when are you going to look into the mirror and say you know what i want to be this amazing god sent compasionate person and i wanted it so bad i made everyone believe it but hey i am human and i can be an asshole at times too. and you know what james i know i can be an asshole oneday i hope you can see your not a great and kind as you try to pretend you are and you have proven that by the way you treat me when no one else is around like your sister or anyone else. can i ask you a question you saw how hard your mother was on me and how cruel she was why did you never help me around your house cleaning up your god damn mess? i feel that you didnt becuase you liked seeing someone in that kind of pain because if you had given a shit about how she treated me you would have helped me, lucie and i both feel that you are more like your mother than you want to believe, and if your not then your consept of being my best friend is a little twisted if you couldnt even get up off of your ass. i felt like i was cleaning up after young children. but you didnt why is it because i have something you wanted something you have wanted for a while now or should i say someone you have wanted for a while now, you think i dont see how you act with her you think she doesnt see it. why is it when you say good bye you give her a hug and dont even acknowledge me? well i dont care because you will never admitt it and i am sure you will be printing this up and be showing it to everyone and thats fine try to make me look like an ass hole just like last time that is totaly fine because just like last time no one felt like i was but in all reality i dont care because i know this email is not ment to hurt you. but do as you feel you need to i will not stand in your way in fact i wont be there at all.

jan'et all i can say is thank you and i love you, you most of all understand how my heart and mind woks at times if it wasnt for your wise comforting words and the laughter you gave to me i would be completely lost, thank you so much."

in your arms i find my place
i see the heavens in your eyes
my soul touches yours as we become one
these memories flood my mind
my soul is torchered in your abscence
i am at the cross roads of death
i can no longer see your face and i weep
oh god if your out there wont you hear my
plead
i know we dont speak much
but please listen now 
bring her to me
erase the past and kill this pain
make me whole again 
i never had to pretend with you
you never expected it from me
my door is open and i wait
to see your figure in it
i remember the night they tried to take you from me
i remember the tears we had to surpress
the pain that ached in our hearts
and i feel it now with the 
possibilities of losing again
im so afraid to love i am so afraid to lose
i cry as the memories chase my heart
have i failed you
have i let you down
in my way i loved you as much as i could
now i try to find away to carry on
were we never ment to be
theres no one left to talk to now that you are gone
they left me with my misery they left me with my death
do you miss me?do you lye awake at night?
do i matter
meet me just one more time
just you and me let me be all that you see
when i am next to you
i cant say all i want to 
please dont walk away 
its so cold at night with out you
how do i find the words to make you stay
is it to late have i lost forever
my eyes are weighted with tears for you
do what you have to but i have finally realized
that i dont know how to let you go
ill do anything just to be near you
we have shared so many tears
so dont turn from me now

All things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold
When you came in this world
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without

The heart of a child

Leaves me purified

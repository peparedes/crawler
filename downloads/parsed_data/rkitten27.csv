"event","I meant to post yesterday but unfortunately came down sick. I'm still feeling weak and am trying to take it easy today.

Saturday started out sucky but got better. I had to work (that was a big part of the sucky factor) and worse, I had a meeting once the bank was closed. That was boring because it was stuff I already knew so it mostly just wasted my time. Then I left to get to the BART train. Michael called and told me that he wasn't doing well without his meds and did I bring them. This was good to know since usually he has a bad habit of not telling me how he's feeling until after he's already blown up at me.
Saturday evening was wonderful...
I had invited my new german friend to come and play at a party I was going to. He brought his violet wand set with him and we got to play with that a bit. It had been a REALLY long time since I'd played with one of those (for those who don't know, a violet wand is an electricity play toy). I ended up expending quite a bit of energy at said party and ended up with a bit of an energy hangover the next day. 
I initially thought my feeling crappy was due to the expended energy from the previous night but now know it was a combination of that and the illness that I had felt trying to come on Friday. Just when I thought I was starting to feel better Sunday evening, I started to feel super crappy again. I decided to lay down on the couch. Victoria snuggled with me and Frank (my cat) lay on me as well. 
Michael came home and I guess because he was tired and not feeling up to playing caretaker..snapped at me. I naturally did not react well. Fortunately what normally would have escalated into a full blown fight just tapered off with me crawling into bed to watch TV. 
I think I sweated out most of what was making me feel crappy last night.
I still felt weak this morning and it was a MAJOR effort to walk to work. I got there late. Not that it mattered...our computers were down. The only things we could do were straight deposits and payments. I really hate having to tell people the same thing several times. 
I ended up leaving work early. I am now home and trying to take it easy."

"event","The day before I went on vacation to Indiana, I had to go get bloodwork done for my doctor. I wasn't able to find time to do it sooner.
I showed up at the lab having done the requisite fast (anyone who knows me well knows that me having not eaten is a SCARY thing...bitchiness ensues quickly). There was no one waiting and only one person (man) working at the time. He takes my info and a few minutes later calls me into a room. I proceed to tell him what I tell every lab person thats ever tried to draw my blood: get it from the top of my hand since the veins are easier to find and less painful for me. I tell him that theres no point in trying to find a vein in my arm as they are usually too deep to find easily. After making one severely half-assed attempt to draw from my hand (he didn't even try to stick me there), he says he's going to draw from the inside wrist. I immediately say 'NO! That will hurt like hell and the veins are likely to collapse too easily that way'. Does he listen? NO! Istead, because I dared to attempt to stand up for myself, he claims I'm being abusive and that he's refusing to do the test. This sets off a panic reflex in me and I start crying. He goes back to his desk, gets on the phone, and proceeds to ignore me crying hysterically for the next 10-15min. I had to beg him to do the test (I wasn't going to even be in the state for the next 2 weeks and I had a doctor appt. 4 days after I got back). The entire process was completely degrading and humiliating. He did indeed attempt to draw from my inside wrists...and it did in fact hurt like a motherfucker...and of course the veins collapsed (just like I said they would). He got some blood and said he was going to send it in and maybe there would be enough to do the test. I left hurting and emotionally drained and having to be at work not long after.
The next day, I started to develop what would turn into nasty purple and blue bruises on my wrists which would last for about a week.
The best part of all this? Apparently the labass botched the test so badly that my doctor called my house and then my work in a panic. She kept asking how was I feeling, was I in pain, dizzy, bleeding...etc. I did not understand until she said that the results of the test were SO BAD that if they had been accurate, I would have needed to be in the hospital. I ended up having to tell her that I was going on my vacation anyway and that I understood it would be AMA and that I would take full responsibility.
I felt just fine the entire trip.
Today I went back to that same lab fully intending to have it out with them. Turns out that particular labass is no longer with them! Yay! I don't know if he quit or was fired but at least he won't be hurting anyone else at that lab. And to make up for all that headache even more....the lady who took his place was an absolute sweetheart and did everything she could to make me more comfortable.
I'm still not happy about having to go back and re-do the test but at least that ass-master wasn't there. That made my day.

That took up a good portion of my Friday. The rest of the day was drama-filled as well. 
Michael had trouble navigating public transit and ended up throwing a tantrum about it. After a long period of not answering his phone and not hearing from him...he cooled down and made it to the RabbitWarren. I showed up about an hour or so later. I think I got there too late to be of much help.

Bonus that made my day end beautifully tho....I left RabbitWarren with girlfriend, took her out to dinner, came back to my place and had great sex. Yay! Happy ending to otherwise sucky day."

I've had a lot to deal with lately.

Recently I went on vacation with Michael and Victoria to Indiana to see our friend/my sweetie. Michael and Victoria stayed for one week and I stayed an additional week without them. Overall it was a good trip. I broke a few barriers regarding my relations with women...this was good, very good ;)
There was some drama towards the end of the trip that led to a REALLY long late night talk with Indiana sweetie (yes, I'm leaving out their name intentionally in case anyone's been wondering). This made me realize that there are a number of aspects to my relationship with Michael that need to change/need work.

I am now in the process of starting that work...its going to be hard but hopefully there will be some lasting change this time."

I had to stay home from work today. I woke up feeling like shit. I didn't think I'd be very useful to anyone if I showed up. I spent most of the day sleeping and woke up with a headache for my trouble.

On a positive note...

I spent an enjoyable evening at a friends house in Concord. We watched 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. We shared artwork and talked (mostly about art related topics). Its nice to have another fellow artist to talk to. I don't get that often. 
I'm still uncertain how to approach my attraction to him tho...
I'm not sure where he stands on relationship/involvements and don't want to cross any lines. I guess I'll just continue as I am....being his friend, no expectations. If anything is to go beyond that...it will in its own time."

That was cool but not the highlight of the evening. That part came later with the stripper that was hired for the party. He was SERIOUSLY hot! Oh my god. By the time he was done with his routine, I felt like I needed a cold shower! Definitely an entertaining way to spend a portion of the day."

Typically my best inspirations for artistic expression have been intense feelings of depression or love. For the last month, I've been feeling intense feelings of love. Normally this would spark something and I'd grab pencil and paper and something interesting would appear. Nothing. More nothing.
I guess I'm just going to have to keep trying. I'm not normally good with words. I can't write flowery poetry or intense love letters. The only way that my feelings of love can truly come accross is if I can draw them. I have to make this happen."

Well, anyway...my trip can be summed up in two words - absolutely amazing!

Indiana itself is pretty nondescript but thats not what I was there for. I went there to visit someone who's been a longtime friend and recently became much more. The anticipation leading up to us seeing each other again was very intense for me. Once I did see him waiting outside the security area, it took all my willpower to resist dragging him off into a dark corner. Unfortunately there were friends with him so that had to wait. We spent the rest of the evening driving around trying to find somewhere to go and not having any luck.
One down side to the trip was having to deal with his ex-girlfriend (one of the friends who met me at the airport) who apparently has yet to be over him. Almost all weekend long, she kept throwing attitude my direction like he belonged to her and I was trying to ""steal"" him away. It was pretty stupid and he's pretty pissed at her for it. I did not like feeling like I had to walk on eggshells around her. I basically had to wait until she wasn't in the room before I could show any level of affection towards him. I was relieved when she'd finally go home for the day.
It didn't take long after she was gone before we were all over each other. It's been quite a while since I've had chemistry THAT good with someone. Words are just not adequate to describe the experience. All weekend, we just didn't seem to be able to get enough of each other.
It was absolutely heartwrenching to have to leave Monday. Once I parted from him and went through security, I just wanted to cry. I was pretty depressed for a while after and the only thing that kept my sanity was listening to music and writing in a notebook.
I'm a bit less sad now but I miss him terribly. I'm already trying to make plans to go back when I get my next vacation time. Eventually, he's planning on moving back to CA but thats going to take time and he says he still has things to do in Indiana. We'll just have to wait and see what happens."

<lj-cut>
Today I went through about 5 or 6 outfits trying to find something that looked acceptable. Nothing seemed to look right on my body. I've always loved wearing dresses that show off the curves of my body. Unfortunately, due to weight gain from childbirth, none of these items in my closet look right on me anymore. I have far to much mid-section for any of the sexy dresses I have to look attractive. The stupid thing is that I actually did lose some of the baby weight (I used to be in 1X-2X, now I'm somewhere in the 16-18, XL-1X range) but not in the right places. I don't know what to do about it. I don't have the time to do any kind of regular exercise and any time I either get depressed or get a craving, I indulge in junk food. I try to resist but its REALLY hard.
I know I have a host of friends who would pipe in at a moments notice saying I'm beautiful and I shouldn't worry so much about weight but I can't help it. I feel like I'm letting down one of my best friends also after all the talks she's given about body image and how this culture is too appearance obsessed. I'm constantly worrying lately about my attractive-ness to current and potential lovers. I know the rational part of my brain says that if it really bothered them they'd say something (cause my friends and lovers and just wonderfully honest that way - I like having honest people in my life :) ) but its hard to shut up the irrational part of my brain that says I need to lose weight.

I don't know what to do.

The lady who runs the daycare put up paper skeletons as decorations for Halloween and thats whats scaring Victoria.

"event","I woke up feeling crappy but knew I had to go in to work at least to open. I didn't know there was another teller scheduled to open with us otherwise I would have called in sick. I managed to make it for almost 2 hours then I had to go home.
While at work, I found out from one of my co-workers just what kind of manager we really have. My co-worker (this is the one I open with most of the time) said she preferred to open with me because I'm always on time. My manager said that was not her experience, that she was always waiting on me (<--bullshit!). My co-worker (bless her) backed me up and said that when she opens with me, I'm always there before she is. Also, on her days off, she said she drives by work and sees me waiting and my managers car is not there yet.
I'm really pissed right now. I bust my ass to get there on time every morning and this is the thanks I get. The reality is that my manager is ALWAYS late. It would appear that shes attempting to cover her ass by badmouthing me (BAD IDEA!!!). I can't imagine what would have possessed her to tell such an obvious lie like that. I have not said anything to her about it because I don't want it to come back on the girl who told me. If my manager says anything to me about 'lateness' though, all bets are off and I most likely will go off on her.

It was bad because Victoria turned into demon child today. She refused to clean up her toys off the floor today, dawdled at eating dinner, and is now as we speak - having a hissy fit tantrum about going to bed.

"event","Well...here we go again.

My day started with getting into a fight with Michael just before I had to be at work. He chose to wait until I had to be on my way out the door before he got Victoria dressed. I was also upset because he scheduled the appointment to look at a house in San Leandro for a time he knew I couldn't be there.
Work went as expected...busy. I guess that was ok. At least it was consistent. 
Once off of work, I headed to the BART station to go to San Francisco. I had an order to deliver to a difficult customer. I had told her exactly when I was going to call her and approximately when I would be there. I spent the next hour trying to call her with no luck. Once I passed my transfer point and it was clear she was not home, I decided instead to head to the Rabbit Warren. I got off at Bayfair station and went to poke around in Target for a bit till someone could pick me up. While inside, I finally got a hold of my customer and she tried to say that I told her something else about when I was going to call. I cleared up the misunderstanding the best I could and told her I'd call as soon as Michael came to get me and I knew more about what was going on. 
Michael came to get me and then we went and got food for me so I wouldn't be so grouchy. After I got to the Rabbit Warren, I sat and ate and attempted to unwind. After a little while, I called my customer back and told her that I was not going to be able to make it today but that I could be there tomorrow. She started to get upset and argue with me and say that I was ""stringing her along"". I explained that I was doing the best I could but that I had my own obligations that I had to balance with getting her order to her. Nothing I said seemed to get through or make her understand. I finally told her that it was either tomorrow or not at all since I'd be busy all the next week. She argued some more and I told her that I'd have to terminate our business relationship and send the products back. She tried to continue the arguement and I finally just hung up on her.
I know she usually placed good orders but I feel so much better now knowing that I won't have to deal with her anymore. The sales just weren't worth the hassle. I'd rather do business with someone more reasonable. Also, traveling to San Francisco just to deliver to one customer was getting too complicated for me.

Anyway, I'm just glad its over. Now I need to try and get some new customers to make up for the one I just stopped selling to. I also have to try and make arrangements to send her the 2 items that belong to her that I was going to exchange.

"event","I'm getting very tired of people playing 'professional victim'. I've observed this particularly with a number of black people. I've tried so hard to treat everyone as I would want to be treated just as I was brought up to behave. Unfortunately some peoples attitudes make that impossible. I get very upset and disturbed by black people that call me a 'white bitch' just because I say/do something they didn't like. This came up yet again on Thursday at work. I was helping people on the teller line as was one of my co-workers. We were the only ones out there at the time because the other two people were working in the back room. My co-worker went into the back to do a cash advance. After a few minutes, a man in the line (who happened to be black) started complaining rather loudly/obnoxiously that I was moving to slow and why didn't we get more tellers out to help...etc. I tried very hard to just ignore him and keep doing my job. He just kept at it, getting louder and more obnoxious. Eventually, its his turn and he ends up at my window where he continues to complain loudly/obnoxiously. Then, instead of getting his transaction together, he start talking loudly with someone else in line. I ask if we could get back to his business and he starts complaining again. I tell him that if he continues to be rude and complain that I won't be able to help him. He continues...I say 'I'm sorry I can't help you'. He says something derogatory and race related. I start to head to the back to cool off. A supervisor asks why I'm not helping him. I say 'because he's being rude and obnoxious'. She tells me to help the next person and I say 'I have to go calm down before I can help anyone'.
If I'd had my way about it, I would have stayed in the back till the asshole left. But I felt guilty about being in the back when its busy so I go back out and endure him being snippy about me while my co-worker is helping him and I'm trying to concentrate on helping someone else.

Earlier that same day, another co-worker delt with someone else of African American descent who also played the race card. A customer had to leave the teller window to get something and came back to the same window when this person started complaining about the teller 'helping ""her"" people' instead of the next person in line (she happens to be Hispanic). I don't know what happened after that other than some yelling since I was on my lunch break.

I don't understand what goes through a persons mind that makes them think its ok to behave like that. 
I don't understand the mindset of black people that have a problem with white people because of slavery/civil rights issues that happened generations ago. It never seems to come from people that actually lived during the segregation times. The people I hear this stuff from are most often too young to have even been born when it was going on so I don't know where their frame of reference comes from. 

I realize these thoughts may be disturbing or even offensive to some but they're just thoughts going through my head. I still believe ultimately that I should treat everyone equally. I just have a really hard time sometimes given some of the attitude that comes my way. This has mostly come up from my living in Richmond this past year. I never really had to deal with this stuff before so I have no frame of reference. In Richmond, I am the minority and I really do feel it. I am often looked at with disdain be people who seem to be thinking 'what are you doing here, you don't belong here'. The longer I'm here in Richmond, the more I feel that I'm not welcome here.

All this is just one more reason to move."

The sad part was that neither myself or Michael were available to spend a significant portion of the day with her. Michael and I both had to work so Victoria had to be in daycare. Fortunately, the wonderful lady that runs said daycare, planned a little party for her.
I'm particularly annoyed at my not being able to be with her today because I asked for the day off like 2 months ago...at least. I asked so far in advance because I know how impossible it is to get the 1st of ANY month off (everyone gets SSI on the 1st and a lot of people get paychecks so we're super busy that day). A week ago I brought it up with my manager and she already had the schedule made up. She also claims that she didn't see any note about it on the calendar (I watched the other supervisor write it down myself when I originally asked) and that theres no way to switch me because there isn't anyone else available.
Victoria's b-day did not go according to plan this year and I'm very irritated about it. Life seems to have conspired to make it hard to do much of anything special for her.
Maybe next year if I submit a notorized memo for my requested day off it will get honored <----note sarcasm

*sigh*

If nothing else, Victoria seemed to be okay. She liked her daycare party and Michael and I made a special dinner and had cake for her. It was the best we could do and it seemed to satisfy her.

I'm particularly annoyed about this since my boss knows I want more hours/pay/responsibility and that this co-workers came into the branch only about 6 months ago. I guess seniority doesn't count for shit anymore. Normally I probably would have gotten all depressive and adopted a 'why should I bother' attitude. I decided to take the high road instead and just keep doing my job as well as I can and say nothing. I wonder how long it will take before someone decides to tell me what's going on. It will be interesting to see.
This seems to be just one more in the growing list of reasons why we should no longer be located in Richmond. This city seems to be slowly rejecting us despite all efforts to co-exist peacefully.

My manager talked to me a bit (with a better approach than yesterday I might add) and actually got me wanting to get referrals today.

After work, I went home and relaxed for a bit before Michael dropped me off at the Morgan Stanley office in Berkeley. I had hoped to deposit a stock certificate into an account today. Unfortunately, the woman I talked to apparently felt it necessary to insult me. She basically (in polite businessy terms) told me that I wasn't worth her time. I had wanted to sell off some/most of the stock so I could get my debts under control. I guess this didn't fit in with what she's used to dealing with. That and the fact that I didn't have definitive long term plan for my finances. Her attitude so offended me that I told her that since I wasn't rich enough for her standards, that I'd be taking my business elsewhere.
Needless to say, I was very upset once outside the building. Her attitude was short-sighted to say the least. If she had at least attempted to treat me with some dignity, I might have respected her more and been more inclined to discuss future investment options. Now she'll never know what kind of financial relationship we might have had.
Why do financial institutions feel it necessary to look down on a person for what they do/don't have? I try very hard not to look down on my customers just because they don't have money. Too bad higher-ups in the financial world can't/won't do the same.

On a positive note tho...I finally found a song I'd been looking for: Restless Heart 'Tell me what you dream'. I know they're a country band but I REALLY like that song and actually, the rest of the album isn't that bad. 
I also have hair dye! Its been FAR too long since I last applied color to my locks. I briefly entertained the notion of dying my hair black again.

Almost a week ago, I didn't have the money to pay Avon for product they sent me so they put my order on hold. I paid, so they released my order. Today I got my order...or what passed for it. It came to the Avon office via FedEx practically destroyed. The boxes were smushed and the packing straps were missing. FedEx did an ultra shitty job taping the boxes together.
I called Avon tonight to get the missing item thing sorted out and come to find that I won't get those items for yet ANOTHER 3-4 days. I'm losing valuable selling time because they fucked up my order and refuse to make an exception to rush my order. I've since lodged a formal complaint about that. I spent the better part of almost 2 hours on the phone argueing with them. This is partially due to my having to call them back after I thought I'd gotten it all sorted out. The first person I talked to, he accidentally disconnected me. The second person I guess took offense at something I said or how I said something and deliberately disconnected me. After another 1/2 an hour of trying to get through, I finally have it all sorted out and the rest of my order will be on its way Wednesday. Of course it looks like I won't see it till my next order is due.

Maybe a change in scenery is what is needed to give my Avon business a shot in the arm. I'm thinking that same change in scenery will help with my steady job. I'm really not liking the branch I currently work at. I seem to be butting heads with the manager a bit too much lately. First it was nit-pickiness in dress code and now it seems that we have different views of good customer service.
I had an account holder come in to get change for the pay phone because she was stranded by an Amtrak train that didn't stop. She needed to make a long distance call to let the people she was going to know what was going on. The pay phone near Amtrak already had eaten some of her change without really helping her. I thought one little call from the bank would be okay and would show her that we valued her as a customer. I told her I would have to ask my manager first. This is where we encountered the problem. The manager said no, the bank didn't allow it, we get reports on all calls made from the banking center...yadda yadda yadda. Like I give a shit about some report. This wasn't about some report. This was about helping out a customer who was in a tight spot. I guess the idea of actually HELPING someone bothered my manager (maybe she was worried that one phone call would damage HER bottom line, i.e. her bonus). I told her just what I thought about her answer. I didn't think it was right, that its good customer service to help people sometimes with non-bank related business, etc. It didn't help. At least the customer was understanding and appreciated that I genuinely wanted to help. *Sigh*
I encountered something similar once before with another account holder. We have a blind customer who turned out to not have anything left in his account (he thought he had a few dollars left). He needed bus fare. We have the ability to overdraw a customers account in an emergency/dire need case. The manager refused to do it. He didn't even want that much. Only a couple of dollars. I was so bothered by the managers lack of compassion that I gave the man a couple dollars out of my own pocket. She later told me that I shouldn't have done that. Say what?!!! Like she gets to tell me how to spend my own money!
Maybe she thought he was just a bum trying to scam me. I knew better. As it turns out, the next time the man came in, he tried to pay me back. I refused to accept the money. I told him not to worry about it. Whatever my manager may think, I know I did a good thing. Its sad that so few people in the world have any sense of humanitarianism anymore. I just hope that my occasional humble acts help in some way."

The Rabbit Warren household is soon to be located there. My husbands werewolf LARP may be moving in that direction. And we have a number of friends that are already located in that area.
I get the feeling that this may be the first in a series of steps that will eventually land us back in Santa Cruz (which btw...was where we were hoping to end up permanently at some point).
I think this may change our respective jobs for the better. I will have to relocate to a different branch since travelling to Richmond won't be cost effective for me. That will probably result in my either getting more hours and/or moving up in the company. Michael will most likely either have to force his company's hand in promoting him or get something else altogether. I'm thinking that a change in city/scenery may help with that.
I'm hoping to check out several leads on housing in the next week and hopefully have something lined up for our other household member to approve of (for those who don't know, we have another household member who is currently out at sea in the Coast Guard. He is due back in November).
Something about all this imminent change just feels like the right thing. 

In other news....
On Saturday, while on Highway 17 to Santa Cruz, someone behind us going to fast, rear-ended us. It would seem that this will most likely result in our aquiring a better vehicle. He jarred our bumper badly enough that its scraping against the muffler. Also, today Michael says that the van will now no longer go into 3rd gear. He thinks the jolt from being hit jostled something loose. He was more specific than that but I'm ignorant about car related terms so I don't remember exactly how he described it. 
So tomorrow he's going to take the van to a Toyota dealer to get an appraisal for what's wrong with it. Hopefully the guy who hit us insurance will just settle up with us since its not going to be worth it to repair the car. My guess is that the repairs will cost more than the blue book value of the car.

I fail to see why a conference call (even if it was required by her superiors) was more important than the waiting customers. The whole morning left me hurried and stressed.
I did not feel very motivated to go anywhere once I got home. Instead, I sat reading Sunday's newspaper and watching trash TV.
I thought I'd get some time to spend with Victoria when she got home from daycare. She only wanted 'daddy' and said 'no' to everything I suggested or asked her to do. It got very depressing, so I went to the bedroom and watched more trash TV.

One of the two has turned out to no longer be the person I thought he was and I've decided that it will be better if I just sever contact.

EVERYONE WHO LOVES ANIMALS this is so terrible. 

A site that we were able to shut last year has returned. We have to try to shut it down again! A Japanese man in New York breeds and sells kittens that are called BONSAI CATS. That would sound cute, if it weren't kittens that were put in to little bottles after being given a muscle relaxant and then locked up for the rest of their lives!! 
The cats are fed through a straw and have a small tube for their 
faces. The skeleton of the cat will take on the form of the bottle as 
the kitten grows. The cats never get the opportunity to move. They are used as original and exclusive souvenirs. These are the latest trends in New York, China, Indonesia and New Zealand. 
If you think you can handle it, view: www.bonsaikitten.com and 
have a look at the methods being used to put these little kittens  into bottles. 
This petition needs 500 names, so please put your one name on it!!!

"event","Well...the deed got done today. Michael came home a bit sad but also relieved. I'm also relieved. I'm relieved that I'll no longer have to hold back who/what I am in order to avoid offending this woman. Living with her would have been disasterous.

I just finished watching the Metallica S&M concert on DVD. That was sooooo cool! I so have to buy the DVD now ...and the cd set. 

Currently I'm chatting with long distance sweetie and muddling in my mind what to type for a testimonial on friendster. I've been meaning to do it but haven't come up with the right words.

Think I'll go attempt it right now...."

"event","Today is the day...

Michael is meeting with his girlfriend to tell her he's breaking up with her. He's not likely to be in a pleasant mood when he gets home. 

My day has been pretty low-key. I got up after much prodding from my daughter and made breakfast - my first attempt at an omelette (which although it looked ugly, tasted great!). During breakfast, I sat Victoria down to watch Yellow Submarine. This helped keep her relatively quiet. I puttered around picking up things, cleaning, etc.
After Yellow Submarine, I decided that I needed to watch a DVD I'd had from NetFlix for far too long - Henry IV. I told Victoria that she could watch with me if she wanted but that she might be bored with it. She wasn't. We ate lunch and then she snuggled with me on the couch till she fell asleep.
She's still asleep as I type this.

I feel good. I've fed her and myself a fair amount of veggies today and there have been no major meltdowns. 
Now it just remains to wait until Michael's return. Undoubtedly, he'll want some level of comfort."

"event","Life is sucky...

I'm really worried about money. We just spent $700 in car repairs for the second time since owning this vehicle. At least it gives us some time to save up money for another vehicle.
Michael and I had a minor conflict about the money aspect of that transaction. We seemed to smooth that over. We went home and reorganized parts of the kitchen. Then dinner was cooked. During the dinner making process, an earthquake happened. About 1/2 an hour later..there's an emergency broadcast on the radio saying there's been a spill at the refinery that we live not too far from and that we're not to set foot outdoors. Oh joy.
Dinner progressed. Victoria was put to bed. 
While Michael was putting Victoria to bed, I felt a bit on the amorous side and so cleaned up the bedroom, turned down the lighting and put on something appropriately sexy. Michael came out of Victoria's room and said his throat was bothering him and he was going to go take care of it. I said ok but come back to the bedroom when you're done. He came back to the bedroom and promptly after removing most of his clothes..flopped on the bed like a lump.
It seems he wasn't feeling up to anything. I didn't really understand and tried to tell him how I was feeling about it. I guess that didn't come across right or something because we got into another minor conflict which ended with him going to bed. I tried to at least get close to him for a little snuggling but he said he wasn't up to being touched at all.
If this is related to the new medication....it SUCKS! Grrr...
Keeping some level of sanity through the meds adjustment period is going to take considerable effort. Hopefully I can make it through. In the end, my hope is that the meds will help balance Michael out so that he's happier and more productive.

We shall see....."

"event","Today she had surgery to repair the broken hip. There was some concern as to whether or not she would make it through the surgery but the alternative would have been bed confinement and a remaining lifetime of painkillers. Not much of a quality of life.
Now that she's made it through the surgery, it would appear that she will have some quality of life..such as it is (with the dementia). My uncle (her son) says that she's still somewhat paranoid and emotional and confused. I guess thats understandable to some degree. 

At least she won't be in constant pain now. I still don't know how much longer we're likely to have her around though. Its slowly killing me to see her like this and as awful as this sounds ...it seems like in some ways it would be better if it ended sooner. That way she wouldn't be suffering anymore. I think mental suffering is far worse than anything physical.

thats all for now."

"event","I got a message from my uncle today that my grandma fell and broke her hip. 

A little background....

My grandma has always been a very lively, independent person. About a year or maybe more ago, she developed dementia. Its gotten steadily worse and she's in a home now. She talks in circles and vaguearys. Nothing is possible to follow.

Now she's fallen and broken a major bone. Apparently the dementia is causing her to be uncooperative with the staff regarding her accident. She's not wanting anyone to touch her.
Is this the beginning of the end?

I'm not ready to say goodbye...I don't know if I ever will be."

"event","Michael and I had a good and productive talk session last night. I think our communication issues are slowly getting better. We seem to be relating to each other better lately. Hopefully this will be a continuing trend.
Our homework (so to speak) for our next session is to write down a list of issues that are important to each of us to include in a relationship agreement. I think that's long overdue and hopefully once we have something in writing, this will help avoid some of the communication problems we've had.

As for me, I feel sick. Last night I looked at my throat in the mirror since it had been feeling scratchy. I'm not sure but it looks like I might have Strep. I really hope not but we'll see...
I have to call my doctor's office which I'm not looking forward to since he's in Lafayette. I tried to get a doctor that was more local but I guess they weren't taking new patients or they were unavailable for one reason or another. My stupid health plan just decided to choose a doctor for me without my knowledge and/or consent. Why they thought Lafayette was local to Ricmond I'll never know. I called to complain they acted like they could have given a shit less. I requested a list of current available doctors which they assured me they'd send....never happened. So I'm stuck with Mr. Lafayette. This sucks.
If I call...they probably won't even have an appointment. grrr.

going to call doctor now..."

"event","My life as of late has been stressful.

Michael is apparently stressed out and depressed (the latter having been ongoing for about 2-3 yrs) and this is causing him to have rather unpredictable angry outbursts. He has finally set a doctor appointment to rule out any physiological causes. Then will be the task of getting a referral to a therapist of some variety. I don't really care what it takes, I just want my sweetie to be well. 
Currently things have toned down a bit but who know if something else will set him off while we're waiting for his treatment to start.
One of the things keeping me sane is contact (although sporatic because of distance) with sweetie in Indiana. He has been very understanding, supportive, and helpful. 
I'm going there to visit in October and am excited because I'll be able to buy the tickets very soon finally!

I'm getting very stressed out about my Avon business. I'm not making enough sales to pay my invoices lately and my orders are being put on hold which is pissing off what few customers I do have.

I'm not thinking clearly enough to type more. More later I think...."

It was scary and exhilarating at the same time.

Over the last couple of weeks I've been having some very personal conversations with a close friend. These conversations turned to the emotionally personal and started me feeling like more than just a friend. I'd been agonizing over how to bring the subject up over the last few days and it came out tonight. I'm not sure if that was just a natural progression or if one or both of us pushed just enough for what I wanted to say to come out. It matters not...the truth is known now. What happens now is anyone's guess but at least I wasn't outright spurned. 

So there's hope yet."

"event","Today we went to Santa Cruz. But first there was a detour into San Francisco to deliver an Avon order to a very odd customer. Some people you just have a sense are going to be strange customers...this was one of them. I thought I'd be there maybe 20 minutes and then we'd be on our way. That would have been great in theory since I hadn't eaten yet. Well....an hour and a half later....
She just would not shut up. I tried to be as patient as I could but I finally told her as politely as I could that I really needed to get going. That was the point when Michael had had enough of waiting and went to find a pay phone to find out where I was. We had a minor arguement which was understandable since he was hungry and stuck in a hot car and I was hungry and cranky from listening to endless talking customer. After that we calmed down a bit and decided to take highway 35 to Santa Cruz. I think the long scenic route actually did us some good. We got to relax and enjoy the scenery. We didn't end up eating until we got to Felton but for some reason that was ok.
After eating, we went to my aunt Linda's house for my uncle Don's birthday/retirement party. There was a pretty high percentage of people I didn't know which made me feel a bit awkward. I just ended up kicking back and relaxing while Victoria ran around playing with all my cousin's kids. I got to see my dad too which was nice since I don't get down to Santa Cruz very often. I also got to see my grandpa (who everyone in the family calls 'Poppy'). He's in his mid 90's and is getting very frail. I'm worried that he's not going to last much longer.
So even though the day started out with drama...it seemed to work out alright.

now I'm tired and just need to play Neopets and relax."

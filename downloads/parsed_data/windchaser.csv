For some reason I'd been invited to join the hosts of Top Gear (quirky British car show) for one of their challenges...Which seemed to involve laying siege to this grand estate in the woods using paintball guns among other things.
I remember Jeremy building this camouflaged cage thing for him to hide in and being oh, so proud of how Hammond and James couldn't spot him.
However, I was able to sneak up on him and even though I was hopeless at firing a paintball gun I got off enough rounds to empty it, did hit him with quite a few pellets.
I clearly remember me going ""But it's not working anymore"" and him a bit snarky saying whether I'd checked if I had any ammunition left. (Naturally, I didn't.)
Hammond and James were both amused.

"event","Last time on Ponystars:
The fairies bestowed a mature fire mare upon me.
Naturally I immediately started looking for a stallion for her to mate with.
Yesterday I finally got her hooked up, with a water stallion nonetheless.
(I think I mostly went by which colors would make a handsome baby if mixed 
with my mare than if they had shiny hooves and a sparkly background.)
I don't want to think about how you mate a seahorse with a draconian pony.
Hey, as long as I get a wee baby out of the deal!

My little air stallion is hella easy to train, he barely loses any health at 
all so I already have him up to level four and with a three in speed now he 
can do more wandering on the grasslands.
I really wish there was a better way to earn more fairy gold though. 
I guess I might have to resort to selling foals in the end.

And today's Ponystars error seems to be that the forum is down.

Hooray for having today off! The weather is quite lovely too, highs in the mid 
80s expected today.
I already decided to spend today cleaning my apartment, so I can fully enjoy 
the rest of my weekend."

"event","So, my visit to the zoo (more like an open air museum with old Swedish farmsteads and...oh, there's an animal park too) here in Stockholm yesterday was a minor disappointment.
As the animal portion of it is rather small you end up feeling somewhat cheated when one or two of the animals are being recluses and taking a nap indoors somewhere.
What happened was an unfortunate combination of the wolves recently having cubs, so they'd closed off their enclosure, with the wolverines hiding, the European bison shut up in their stable thing cause they were cleaning their outdoors enclosure, the lynx no where to be seen and the only visible bears being two napping yearlings (so no bear cubs to be seen).

Safe to say, I felt like walking up to the information desk to demand a refund. 
I was a little cheered by the active grey and harbor seals. Watching an otter feast on a dead rat was amusing too, in a morbid kind of way.

I wonder if it might be time to start packing up some of my toys and put them in storage...
With the slow, but steady growth of my book collection I've found myself yearning for more shelf space for them and my eyes keep drifting to my display cabinet. There's plenty of space in there, if I could only get rid of the stuff occupying it at the moment.
The most likely stuff to pack up is, gasp, my Transformers.
I don't think I've touched the stuff on the top shelf since I moved in here, so right now it's just been collecting dust. Maybe it is time to...move on.
There's no way I'd consider selling them right now, not yet. Maybe there will be room for them when I get a bigger apartment that fits another nice book case for my books. Though right now...Time for a trip to IKEA to buy boxes. (It's a good thing it's so close, cause a long bus trip carrying large items sucks ass.)

In other news (and why I'm lazy).
It's afternoon now and I'm still not dressed.
Time to do something about that and get started cleaning my apartment."

And whee. Getting up early in the morning for a bit, only to go back to sleep for another hour or so is doing strange things to my brain.
Giving me odd dreams for one.
Dreamed I was visiting some odd fusion of Columbus and my family's seaside dwelling.
I was talking to Graham and Walky about random crap, oddly enough my brother's were there too as well as some blind guy whose identity is unknown to me.
My grandfather was alive and well in my dream too, before my parents showed up and I had them give me a ride home instead of flying like I'd originally intended.
(God knows what strange airport I'd be flying out of.)
I remember walking around outside and suddenly the location looked more like some old farmstead than either of the two original locations.
It ended with me walking around inside to hunt down Graham and the floors were made out of ice, like they had an indoors hockey rink inside the house."

We did pay a surprise visit to my mom, as it was also her birthday, in their new house and she really appreciated that.

Tomorrow afternoon and evening will be spent having the only decent pizza in this country (read: Pizza Hut) and watching the Monty Python's Flying Circus DVD box I picked up at Amoeba Records (advertising like mad!) and what Heroes episodes we can squeeze in. 
Saturday me and brothers made plans to hang out with grandma and judging by the current weather forecast, we'll be watching an delightfully scientific IMAX movie at the natural history museum (and I'll spend more money in their gift shop, whee!).

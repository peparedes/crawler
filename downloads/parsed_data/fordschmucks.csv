"event","So you walk into the place, and it's colourful. You can find so many different things there. Old cameras, toys,&nbsp; vintage looking clothes and jewellery. According to my friends there's some pretty great stuff on sale.

But I don't see anything for sale. I'm blind to it all.
I only see them. In their big shirts and their floral print dresses. They're all so beautiful. All so pretty. So pretty that it would seem like a crime to do anything else but to just stare and fall in love.
The beautiful hair. Those amazing eyes. Why don't i know any girls like that? I know. It's easy for you to say, "" so go and get to know them!"" but i'm an stuttering idiot when i try to approach a beautiful girl without a jug of long island tea flowing through my bloodstream.

Oh man the girls at the zouk flea market. I was swept of my feet so many times that day, i should have just brought a bloody wheelchair..."

Completely uncool
Life had no more meaning
I couldn't keep a girlfriend
I thought i'd go and eat some worms

But on the way to the garden
I passed my reflection
I must be one of God's best made concoction
Some call me pretty
Some call me gorgeous
Whatever it is I attract even mothers

Cry me a river
In fact make it the Nile
My good looks will take me a billion plus miles
So now as I come
To the end of my poem
I tell you my dick is bigger your momma's fat bottom"

"event","<p>I was watching the justice league and there was this alien thing called the black mercy that attached itself to you and paralyse you, and at the same time give you your deepest desires. If i had it on me. She'd still be mine... but more importantly i'd be the human torch. Oh please please please give me the ability to burst into and flames and fly. It'd be so cool. Except there would be&nbsp;a few slight problems. Singapore has very little crime. I mean realistically there's no giant robots and shit so i'd have to travel to other countries to make myself useful.<br /><br />Secondly, I think governments would be trying to aquire me as a military weapon i don't really want that.<br /><br />But the thing that would bug me the most is that, everytime i burst into flames, i'll burn up my jeans. Does that mean i can't wear expensive clothes anymore? I'll have to walk around in like a $2 shorts and tee shirt. Is it even possible to find clothes that cheap? Oh oh and will you be able to see my flaming hanging penis since all my clothes are burnt off? Maybe people wont be able to see me in detail since the flames will be to bright.<br /><br />Oh see and what's the use of superpowers if you can't get the girls right? So how do i bring a girl on a joy ride if she gets burnt everytime she comes close to me... fuck i'd be better off with superman's powers, but bursting into flames is so much cooler...</p>"

"event","I should fucking stop doing this. See everytime i visit her old blog. I get happy at first cause it reminds me of the shit load of good times we had but then as i go later and later i start to miss her more and more and then i get reminded of the&nbsp;all the shit i gave her and how i shouldnt have. Then the regret comes in. Followed by the sadness, the loneliness. And i feel like killing myself right now really. I'm fucking depressed. And she's with some other guy and my ego won't let me accept that he may be&nbsp;better than me. So to me, I'm better looking and better and everything else but the thing is. He probably treats her really nice. And she's probably really happy with him.&nbsp; But don't forget im delusional and i'm still thinking that maybe she doesn't really love him. Maybe she's still madly in love with me. And i know since i know it myself i shouldn't be so fucking crazy right and i should get the fuck on with my life and stop being so pathetic but you don't get it man. I've got a fucking disease. It is a disease. But man i really do miss her and i can't tell her that i want her back, cause even if it mattered to her right it wouldnt be very fair on&nbsp;my part&nbsp;to drop a bomb like that. But but the true reason why i won't do it, is because i fucking afraid that i don't mean&nbsp; anything to her. And i know i won't die but the fucking pain would be unbelievable. I can so picture it "" I don't think about you that way anymore"" or even worse, how bout a ""no"" man and now theres a fucking lump in my throat and it feels like this mass of liquid is fucking trying to break through the walls of my eyeballs and flow out but i never let myself cry over something unless it's really really really hurting me really badly. My throat wants to explode. I'm in a fucking wreck now. Im fucking doing shit with my life and i'm a fucking different person from who i used to be, what the fuck is happening to me. Man i'd kill to be young again. I'm fucking 21. Fuck off. Fuck all of you"

Everyone seems to be doing it and i'm just following the herd 
Im fucking exhausted right now, so i won't write much 
But fuck, how the hell does anyone bother pouring out all his emotions into this shit huh. 
see right the only time i would write something is when i'm emo. But when i'm emo i can't really be bothered to write anything and this livejournal has like so many fucking options compared to blogger...

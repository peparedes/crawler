"event","Finally gotten round to doing this. At work, but never mind. It's Friday afternoon and has been a hell of a week so I deserve so slacking off time ;)

1. What did you do in 2010 that you'd never done before? Went to a wedding on a beach, consoled my Mum after my brother came out and my Dad wasn't taking it well, moved in with a boy (technically, he moved in with me but same diff :P), saw my brother kiss another guy, got made redundant, learned a little about wine, drove a car in America and probably a lot of other things. It was an eventful year :P

2. Did you keep your New Year's resolutions, and will you make more for next year? I did keep the resolution about writing things down. My diary is very useful. Not sure about saying no to people. I said yes and then subcontracted the obligation recently so I'm getting closer! My new years resolution this year is to keep in contact with my Grandma more. So far, so good :D

3. Did anyone close to you give birth? Again, a few people. Two of my semi-good friends have had girls. One is not taking to motherhood very easily, the other like a duck to water.

4. Did anyone close to you die? No, thankfully.

5. What countries did you visit? America, Florida to be exact.

6. What would you like to have in 2011 that you lacked in 2010? An engagement ring lol 

7. What dates from 2010 will remain etched upon your memory, and why? 17th September, seeing one of my best friends get married on the beach in Florida. Probably the best day of my year :D

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year? Staying strong when I didn't feel it.

9. What was your biggest failure? Not supporting my brother enough. I was there, but I could probably have been there more.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury? Actually, no! Best health I've been in for ages :P 

11. What was the best thing you bought? My holiday to America.

12. Whose behavior merited celebration? My Mum, for accepting my brother for who he is and welcoming his boyfriend into the family with open arms. She's been amazing.

13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed? My previous employers for making me redundant, although that worked out for the best in the end. My Dad in a way, for ignoring the elephant in the room.

14. Where did most of your money go? Bills, food, my holiday and days out. All worth it :D I've actually started saving money again now Phil's moved in.

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about? Going on holiday

16. What song will always remind you of 2010? Alejandro - Lady Gaga. Some crazy American lady who worked at Universal Studios was singing it :P

17. Compared to this time last year, are you:
* happier or sadder? Happier
* thinner or fatter? Fatter :P Wish I could lose this pesky half stone
* richer or poorer? Richer

18. What do you wish you'd done more of? Exercise, relaxing

19. What do you wish you'd done less of? Worrying

20. How will you be spending Christmas? I spent Christmas with my family and then spent as much time as possible with Phil, same as last year.

21. How many one-night stands? None.

22. What was your favorite TV program? Dexter, Greys Anatomy, Private Practice, Cougar Town

23. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year? I don't have the time or energy to hate anyone

24. What was the best book you read? Read so many... can't decide!

25. What was your greatest musical discovery? Paramore

26. What did you want and get? A new phone - Motorola Flipout :D

27. What did you want and not get? An engagement ring :P 

28. What was your favorite film of this year? Harry Potter 7

29. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you? I was 27 and I went for a walk around Virginia Water taking photos with my new camera. I had the whole week off though and in the week went to the beach (even though it was November!) to see my friend and her baby.

30. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? I'm not sure...

31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2010? Cheap clothing that fits OK, same as last year ;)

32. What kept you sane? I still don't claim to be sane

33. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most? Joaquin Phoenix

34. What political issue stirred you the most? I live in a box and try to avoid political issues. I know this is stupid but I have trouble keeping up with my own small issues, let alone global ones

35. Who did you miss? My granddad, friends I don't see enough any more

36. Who was the best new person you met? Matt, Amrit and James - All from my new job :D

37. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2010: In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity. I still love this quote. I think I re-learn it on a regular basis.

38. Quote a song that sums up your year: Get Happy - Judy Garland"

"event","Not been on in a while. Really should do a proper update. Not now though. 

Just a quick post to ask for people to send good thoughts and prayers our way today. Phil's Dad is in surgery, right now, having a heart bypass. It's a 4-5 hour operation so we won't know anything for a while. Then we'll be praying for a good recovery. We'd love to see him home by Christmas.

I don't often ask, and I pray even less, but it can't hurt."

<i>hi, i really don't know how to start this message, but it's a pathetic and late apology. I've not had a drink, but i really wanted to say i'm very sorry for what i did to you, i should have told you in person i was going back to helen. I did enjoy every minute with you, i was afraid to see you upset and i was a coward for that. I never lied about how i felt towards you and i will always regret my choice. I know you have moved on and so have i, but i still have guilt in me for hurting you. I really hope you are ok and also your family x</i>

Two choices. One, ignore. Two, forward to his current girlfriend, the one he left to go out with me and then dumped me to go back to ;)

a) Been to Brighton and been ignored by all females. I wasn't looking but I guess I kinda thought I might get some attention. A blow to my ego but for the best :P

b) My brother has come out to my parents. My Mum took it well, my Dad took it terribly. He hasn't disowned him but is nowhere near ready to accept it.

c) Phil has accepted an offer on his house. When all the legal and monetary shenanigans are over he will officially move in with me. Scary.

Right now I'm trying to process stuff in a severely sleep deprived state. Early night for me."

My brother has a boyfriend. I met him on Saturday. My parents don't know that he likes guys as well as girls and I get to be there when he tells them, for support. Fun conversation that will be.

I've got a hen weekend to go to this weekend, in Brighton, known for gayness and venue of my one and only girl on girl experience. 

And I have a boyfriend, of the serious variety.

*sigh*

I'm knackered from going for a run and just from work and life in general. I hope I can get out of my general tiredness/funk and enjoy myself this weekend."

The people at work are... quiet. Sometimes I can strike up a conversation and we have a laugh but a lot of the time... quiet. And I don't do quiet.

Phil will move in within three week (ish). In anticipation of the move he's gotten himself a new job that's much nearer my place, and ironically a lot closer than where I work now, and he starts that next Monday. I'm still looking forward to it and also worried about the change. Living with a partner full time is gonna be different to part time and I'm not sure how quickly I'll adapt."

Barbara has also bought me some lovely Soap & Glory body wash and body scrub. I LURVE Soap and Glory lol So all in all I've done rather well out of this redundancy.

I start my new job on Monday. I'm trying not to think about it. I'm hoping it will all be OK. They're a wine company and they've already sent me two bottles of free wine and I haven't even started yet lol :P

Two are a little far out but would be OK as a stopgap, but the one on Monday is really close to home, a good journey and the agent seems to think I've got a good chance of getting it.

It's a contract role, which I've never done before, but there's a good chance it would go permanent at the end of the contract. Also, contracting work tends to pay better as well.

I need you all to think really good thoughts for me. Reeeeeeally good thoughts. I had an interview this morning for a company I really want to work for. It's a design agency and they're really good. Reeeeeeally good. It would be a good salary and a role I think I'd really enjoy. And hopefully be good at.

I think they liked me. It seemed to go well and there was lots of smiling and positivity. They've got more people to see but I should hear either way by the end of the week.

Tomorrow I have a meeting at my current company where I'll find out if I'm being made redundant. 

The best thing that can happen here is that I get made redundant, get a big payout and then get this new job. Win:Win.

The second best thing that can happen is that I get this new job and my current company decide they won't make me redundant yet, so I'll just leave on my own accord.

The third best thing that can happen is that I don't get this new job but I get to keep my current job for a while, giving me more time to look for a new job.

The worst thing that can happen is that I don't get this new job and I get made redundant tomorrow.

I'm feeling sick, in denial and... happy? Don't get me wrong, I need a job. I need to pay my bills. But I hate that place. Hate it so much that the idea of being told to take some amount of money (hopefully enough to make it until I find a new job) is actually... good?

It's not a definite but it's likely.

I'm scared.

However, I did get a call today while I was on lunch from an employment agency telling me about a role that I was interested in and I'd already told her I was interested before I found out about my possible redundancy. Therefore I'd already been put forward for it. I'm desperately hoping I get an interview for it now because it seems I'm going to need a job. Very soon.

I'm looking at this as a sign. A positive sign.

Cross your fingers I get an interview because if I don't then I really don't know what I'm going to do. I'll be OK for a few months if I don't get a job immediately but I don't want to eat into my savings which are already diminished.

"event","I've just about recovered from the major freak out I had on Tuesday night. I didn't think a new TV would cause me to hyperventilate, but apparently I was wrong.

Phil is moving in. Well, not right now, but he's moving in later this year and he and his brother will sell their house and move in with respective girlfriends, Phil into my flat and his brother will buy a place with his girlfriend. This is good and what I want to happen. I have, in fact, been suggesting Phil moves in with me for some time now.

To ease the moving in process we decided that over the next few months Phil would move some of his non-essential stuff over to my flat, so when the big moving in day came it wouldn't be so much work. Brilliant idea, bring it on. He also has always hated my old TV, which although antiquated (compared to the latest TVs) and second hand, I've always loved because it's mine and, hell, it was free :P 

So Phil asked if he could buy a new, big, flat screen TV. He was paying for it and really wanted it so I thought why not? I even bought a new TV unit from Ikea for the thing to live on. It's been sat flat pack under my spare bed for two months until the time came to build it.

Phil and I have had three days off work this week to decorate his bathroom (bit of a palaver but that's another story) so he decided it would be the perfect time to order the TV. We build the cabinet at the weekend without a hitch and it looked pretty cute in my living room. Phil was happy because something he helped pick was in my living room and I was happy coz it looked cute :D It was sitting next to the old TV and old TV stand, just waiting for the new TV.

Tuesday evening the new TV arrived. It's big, it's new, and it's not mine. It's Phil's. And it's moving my TV out into the spare room (where it doesn't really fit) and just <i>dominating my room</i> with its giant newness. Couple the feelings of dread I feel at change in general with the stress of moving heavy objects and untangling hundreds of TV, DVD, games console and Sky box related cables and you've got a pretty stressed and freaked out Lexy.

But I've had a few days with the new TV now. Phil isn't here right now so I'm doing a little bonding time with <i>our</i> new TV. I have to admit, it looks kinda awesome :D 

Ironically, there's a new DVD stand to the right of my PC which has come from Phil's house and is crammed full of his DVDs and CDs with a couple of mine in there to fill in the gaps. This piece of furniture seems to belong there and almost looks like it's always been there, possibly because I've put and candle and two cuddly toys on the top of it ;) Phil said it makes it look like it belongs because it's got bits of me on it.

So the first shock of Phil moving in and my flat changing is over. I'm sure there'll be more freak outs to come, culminating in the massive freak out of him actually MOVING IN permanently. I'm not sure he realises that this is weird for me as well as him. I know he's the one doing the physical move but he's coming into <i>my space</i> which I've got used to living in alone for the most part. Everything is where I want it and it's all mine. 

I've got to get used to giving that up a little because I want to move into the next part of my life and the next part of my life is Phil.

ETA: I just read this quote on <lj user=""ariestess"">'s journal and it fits this post so I'm re-posting. I hope she doesn't mind :D

I'm not gonna say I'm happy at work, but I'm not as miserable. I'm BUSY now, like whoa busy, which is always better for me. Days are flying by and I'm not clock watching. The people I work for are still jerkwads, but in general I'm getting along better since my slight bollocking. I guess I just needed a bit of direction again or something. I'm left so much to my own devices I suppose it was good to be noticed, even if it was for the wrong reasons.

Saying that, if a better job comes along they won't see me for dust ;D

On a non-work front, I seem to have practically detached myself from my online life (apart from Farmville/Facebook which I need a 12 step programme to break away from) and although I miss everyone I think this is probably a good thing. Real life is happening.

It's valentines day this weekend and that's obviously something I enjoy more now I have someone to share it with. This'll be my third VD in a row that I won't be single and the second with Phil. We're going out to dinner tomorrow and going into town later today so I can get him a gift. He's already spent WAY too much on me by paying for my new glasses (he insisted) which were NOT cheap. He really is generous with his money when it comes to buying things for me/us. He's also very good at budgeting and saving. I really am lucky. My best friend's husband is TERRIBLE with money and the amount of arguments they have about it is painful. 

For those not coupled up this valentine's day, and also the ones who are, I send you all my love :D &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;"

I'm in a cupboard.

...

Yes. A cupboard. And I'll be here all day and all tomorrow.

And you do you know what? 

I'M LOVING MY CUPBOARD!!!!!!!!!!!! XD

I really am! Totally loving it. But I need to explain why I'm in a cupboard. So here goes.

You see, work has sent me to the evil trade show in Coventry. A show I was dreading going to. Getting up at 5.30am, driving over 100 miles partially in rush hour, and then standing on a stall demoing a website system I'd never used before for a company I don't even work for (part of the same group, but not actually my company. I was pimped out) was not my idea of fun. Throw in a night alone in a shitty travel lodge and having to find a pub to eat in when everyone else is at some swanky trade show dinner and you've really added insult to injury.

However, as it turns out the woman running the stand wasn't actually aware that I was going to be coming.

*pause for absolutely no surprise at all*

So because they weren't expecting me there was no station set up for me with a laptop etc. Luckily I had my own laptop in the car (for using in the hotel tonight, travelodge wifi abuse YES) so I went and got it. They were gonna set me up in the front but I didn't want people looking over my shoulder when I was setting up the sites as I didn't know what I was doing.

So, they set me up in the storage cupboard thing that all the bags, coats and catalogues are in! My own office ;) But you see, my cupboard is AWESOME! They've made me wear this vile bright yellow outfit with HERE TO HELP! on the back, and I don't want to help so no one asks me anything while I'm in the cupboard, the cupboard has unrestricted internet access (ABUSE YES!), there is music playing in the exhibition hall so I can listen to that, if I get bored of that I have my own music on my laptop (and I bought my headphones :P) and I'm not at all downloading an episode of House to watch this evening xD xD They would actually kill me if they realised I was hogging the bandwidth like that, but as an entire exhibition hall is wirelessly using the same connection I don't think anyone is gonna notice lol

I have my mobile, which ironically I have received a call from an employment agent on this morning, so I can phone, text, email, go on facebook, LJ, talk on Trillian... it's like being at home, only at home people don't keep offering me tea and coffee!!!

OK, so occasionally someone asks me to set up a website, but this system I'm using is so easy that you can do one in 10 mins and so far today I've only had two to set up lol

So these two days have gone from a nightmare to being two lovely days in a cupboard :D hopefully they won't expect me to come out of the cupboard at any point ;) 

*considers making Lexy &hearts; cupboard icon*

And I'm being paid for this! And for my petrol and any expenses incured over the two days.

   2. Did you keep your New Year's resolutions, and will you make more for next year? I didn't make any but I've made two for this year. One is to write things I need to do in my diary so I don't double book myself and the other is to say no to people. I say yes way too much. 

   3. Did anyone close to you give birth? Loads, although not uber close to me.

   4. Did anyone close to you die? No, thankfully.

   5. What countries did you visit? Tenerife

   6. What would you like to have in 2010 that you lacked in 2009? More organisation and more time to do what I really want. Also I'd like to get a job I actually don't hate.

   7. What dates from 2009 will remain etched upon your memory, and why? I always suck at remembering specific dates. There have been highlights in every month, what with Thorpe Park, my holiday, my one year anniversary (4th July) and then more recently my birthday.

   8. What was your biggest achievement of the year? My relationship is still intact and still strong. I don't know if everyone will consider that an achievement, but I do. Relationships are hard work but totally worth it :D

   9. What was your biggest failure? Letting myself be miserable at a job I hate.

  10. Did you suffer illness or injury? Seriously, the most colds I've ever had, tonsillitis, food poisoning, hurt my hip going down one step and buggered my ankle at netball. Here's to a less accident prone 2010...

  11. What was the best thing you bought? Probably not anything physical, I'd say the best things I bought this year were days out I've had with friends and with Phil.

  12. Whose behavior merited celebration? My brother, for getting a job he loves in a field he wants to work in, and all my friends and family for continuing to support me in every way. 

  13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed? My bosses suck muchly. 

  14. Where did most of your money go? Bills, food and days out. I had a bloody good time though lol

  15. What did you get really, really, really excited about? Going on holiday

  17. Compared to this time last year, are you:
          * happier or sadder? Averaging out work and real life, I think I'm sadder due to work.
          * thinner or fatter? About the same, according to <lj user=""million_moments"">
          * richer or poorer? Poorer

  18. What do you wish you'd done more of? Exercise 

  19. What do you wish you'd done less of? Stressing out

  20. How will you be spending Christmas? I spent Christmas with my family and then spent as much time as possible with Phil :)

  21. How many one-night stands? None.

  22. What was your favorite TV program? Dexter :D Although there are lots of contenders 

  23. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year? I don't have the energy to hate anyone

  24. What was the best book you read? The Island by Victoria Hislop. Phil's mum leant it to me and I would never have picked it up if it wasn't for her. I really enjoyed it :)

  25. What was your greatest musical discovery? Florence and the Machine. I like them a lot

  26. What did you want and get? A laptop :D My parents bought it for me and I love it so &hearts;

  30. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? I guess I would like to have gotten engaged but I'm not really bothered it didn't happen this year. There's still plenty of time, I'm just impatient ;)

  31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2009? Cheap clothing that fits OK

  32. What kept you sane? I don't claim to be sane

  33. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most? Olivia Wilde? Not sure really

  34. What political issue stirred you the most? I live in a box and try to avoid political issues. I know this is stupid but I have trouble keeping up with my own small issues, let alone global ones

  35. Who did you miss? My granddad, friends I don't see enough any more

  36. Who was the best new person you met? Barbara at work. She kinda ""gets"" me, and that's refreshing as most people where I work still look at me like I'm some kind of alien *sigh*

  37. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2009: In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity. I think Albert Einstein realised this before me though... 

  38. Quote a song that sums up your year: Black Eyed Peas - I've got a feeling"

Where have I been? Not online. At all (with the exception of farmville on facebook which I'm addicted to) I've barely even sat at my computer. A lot of stuff has happened since I last did a proper update... aaaaages ago... so I'll sum up briefly.

- I had five days of epic fun/business for mine and Phil's birthdays. We ate out 5 nights in 6 days and <s>spent a lot of money</s> had a lot of fun. We went to Portsmouth and London and everywhere in between. It was awesome and ruined only by coming back to work.

- Work - has been up and down. I got epically bored, got a bit busier and time moved a little faster, and now I'm epically bored again. I went for an interview a week and a half ago and should hear today. I've jumped through hoops for them and don't even know the salary yet. I'm not even sure I want the job. I desperately want to leave where I am now but don't want to move on for just anything. I'd like to find somewhere I will want to stay at for a few years.

- Phil and I have been amazing, and then had a little fight (really minor - we don't really do fights) and then made up again. It all stemmed from talking about him moving in. I basically felt like I had no say in the matter, even though he's going to be moving in to my flat. We've settled on September 2010 as the date when he will move in, with stuff dripping it's way over to mine in the months preceding. I believe I am happy with this date.

- We all went to Manchester for our Christmas party. We spent 11 hours in total getting there and back. It wasn't worth the trek.

- Christmas is coming! I've got my tree up. Phil and I put it up together on Wednesday night :) It was much nicer doing the tree together this year. I put it up alone last year and it was kinda depressing. This time next year we'll be living together :)

I'm looking forward to my 10 days off work this Christmas, mostly to have a good long rest. Life is whizzing past me at the moment at a terrifying speed. I'm always tired and before I know where I am a month has gone passed. I hope everyone is well as I've not checked my f-list in forever."

I've long believed LJ to be as good as any therapist for venting my woes and as of late I haven't had many woes to vent. When I have had I've been too busy/tired to vent them lol

Things that have been making me happy recently:-

1) Phil - He's been looking after me because I've had a rotten cold. Apparently my body isn't as resilient as it used to be. I swear I've been sick more times this year than in any other year of my life. He's been coming over, despite the high probability of catching it himself, and generally being lovely. Plus he's managed not to even catch the cold! Go figure :P

2) My flat - Even after over a year of living here, I still look around my flat and love being here. It's mine, and even with the stresses it brings of paying bills and keeping a home, I still love it as much as I did the day I moved in.

3) Phil's brother having a girlfriend - YES! IT'S TRUE! He's been seeing this girl Emma for a few months now and I'm meeting her tonight at the fireworks display we're going to. I've no idea what she's like but Dave seems to really like her. I'm so pleased because a) It means Dave is out more so gives me more time with Phil, b) Dave is HAPPY and therefore not miserable by seeing Phil and I together, c) Phil feels less guilty for spending time away from Dave because Dave isn't alone. We're going for a big family meal at their parents house tomorrow so Phil's parents can meet Emma, and I'm going to take some of the pressure off her lol So it'll be me, Phil, Dave, Emma, their Mum and Dad and their Nan. Should be an interesting one. As much as I want Emma to stick around, and I want his family to like her, I still kinda want them to like me more ;) I'm sure that makes me a bad person lol

4) TV - It's sad, but I LOVE Autumn/Fall/Winter TV ;D I've got Grey's Anatomy, Private Practice, House (it it ever comes off break), Dexter, Strictly Come Dancing, X Factor and now I'm even into Stargate Universe! I'm kinda strangely attracted to the geeky slightly podgy guy who's the maths nerd! His name escapes me but I feel sorry for him for not getting the girl. He's better than that other guy ;)

5) Work - Not exactly making me happy but not making me miserable either, for the moment. It's much better where I sit now. Having more people to talk to has really taken the pressure off of having to get along with Lou. Now if she's in a mood, I can just ignore her until she's out of it. Surprisingly, she actually seems to be talking to me more now. Weird, but good :D I also talked to my MD yesterday about my bonus scheme not working so hopefully she'll do something about that :D

6) Having a cold - You can tell I'm happy because I'm seeing the good in everything ;) Because I was off sick from work two days this week I got to catch up on Stargate Universe because I'd only seen the first episode and also I got to finish my new book by my favourite author.

Things making me sad:-

1) Money - Yeah, I don't have any. Not strictly true as I still have a nice wedge of savings but it looks like I'll have to dip into them to get me out of my overspend from the last couple of months. It's the time of year of massive expenses for me. Car insurance, car tax, MOT, unexpected bill, Christmas and my birthday in a couple of weeks will eat a lot of money in socialising. I am, however, trying to accept the fact that I've done well budgeting up to this point and will just enjoy myself and spend some of my savings. I'm hoping I can replenish them with the money I would spend on council tax when we get our tax break in Feb/March and also if I ever get that private web design job I can make a bit back then. Budgeting = hard.

I hope everyone is well, I've neglected reading my friends page as well as updating. My online time now mostly goes to Farmville on facebook. I admit it, I'm addicted. I didn't even want to start playing but Phil started and wanted me to have a farm next to his ;D Look what he's started!"

When I arrived yesterday the guy I came up here to see said he had half an hours worth of stuff to show me.

I'm here for TWO DAYS.

We dragged the half hour out to an hour. After that I basically sat at a computer and roughly sketched out some designs for something that basically weren't needed. I'm gonna go back to my office and probably start over because they're pretty crap. Essentially I'm just going through the motions until I can go home.

I seeeeeriously need a new job.

I'm trying to think of things I can do to keep me occupied for the next four hours and I think the most sensible thing to do is to start reading <lj user=""geonncannon"">'s new book. I'm always saying I don't get time to read his stuff anymore.

I shouldn't complain :P"

Remember I said I'd been asked to go into work Friday morning, which I had booked weeks ago as a day off, for a couple of hours because ""something exciting would be happening"" and I'd pretty much surmised that nothing would be exciting enough to get me out of bed, washed, dressed, make up on and to work for 9am on my day off?

Well.

...

I was right.

*sigh*

We all got there for 9am, waited outside the building trying to peek though the tapped up windows to see what was going on. Yeah, tape. They're all about the drama. We'd been told that some special guests would be coming so we'd been trying to guess who it might be.

I'd guessed Santa.

It was not Santa. Turns out, it was us. <em>Us</em> FFS. We walked in the door and our managing director went ""TA DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"" and showed us the new look reception area with balloons and bucks fizz (which I refused to drink at 9am coz I don't like it anyway and I have a cold and didn't want to make myself feel worse. I made tea later in defiance) and got led into the showroom. We then proceed to be shown a powerpoint presentation about how the business was going to ""get it's Fizz back"" and how everything was gonna be marvellous. 

To demonstrate how marvellous it was gonna be they'd bought us all presents. And a rose. And bacon sandwiches. And doughnuts.

Bribery can go quite far with increasing moral in a company, but I guarantee that nothing would have boosted my moral more than LETTING ME STAY IN BED A FEW HOURS LONGER AND NOT HAVING TO GO INTO WORK.

They've also, in their infinite stupidity, moved all the desks around to ""try and create a more unified working environment,"" which although it gives me more people to talk to it also means my monitors can be seen by loads of people so I can't go on the internet to waste my time when I have fuck all to do any more. I better pray that going to Manchester will create some work for me to do.

What's worse is that they did the desk moves by themselves with no IT people as Graham, our one and only IT guy, is away on holiday this week. This means that they've moved people to where there are no network cables, the phones don't work, half the computers don't work properly and no one can access any of the drives they need.

At least this is what I was told. There was no way I was turning on my work computer on my day off :P

I did at least make sure everything was plugged in where it should be. Which it wasn't. So after fixing the cables I did a quick on/off just to make sure the bloody thing started up. I spent the rest of the time wandering around the office trying to retrieve my stuff, which they'd gotten all messed up with other peoples. We we all hunting round trying to rebuild our desks. I then stole as many chocolates as possible and made a swift exit at 11am, after confirming I could have a half day Wednesday as compensation for coming in on my day off. 

In short, major fuck up all round. I myself feel so much more motivated.

Not.

Congratulations! In trying to motivate me you've actually done the opposite and I feel less motivated than ever! And I didn't think that was actually possible!!

Well done."

"event","I had a truly fabulous weekend :D Friday night, Phil cooked for me at his house and we watch a film. His brother actually went out so we had the house to ourselves. Saturday I left Phil's at about noon and went home to food shop, catch up on TV (OMG NEW GREYS ANATOMY!) and then Phil came round at about 6pm. We had a cup of tea and he chatted to me while I got ready to go out for my friend's 30th birthday dinner.

He had offered to drive me and pick me up, which was lovely of him, and he dropped me into town, went to his parents for dinner and a DVD and picked me up at midnight when I was totally stuffed with food and rather drunk ;)

We woke up Sunday and after a nice lay in we went for a walk around Virginia Water lake in the lovely, unexpected sunshine. We had a late pub lunch (mmm pub roast) and then he fell asleep on my sofa lol The only downside of the whole weekend is that Phil has a slight cold (therefore is dying with man flu) and I'm getting it as well but I refuse to be sick ;)

I've got Thursday and Friday off of work (YAY) to use up some leave but I got asked if I could come in for a few hours on Friday morning for something ""top secret and exciting"" so I've got to get up :P Good thing is it should only be a few hours and then I get to leave again ;) As much as I don't want to go in on my day off, I am kinda intrigued as to what it is. I'm sworn to secrecy that I even know that something is going on on Fridyay, and I don't even know what it is!"

"event","I'm covering reception for an hour at lunch while everyone else goes to the pub as our receptionist is ill today. I volunteered for this job for four reasons:-

1) It makes me look like a really lovely, selfless person (look being the operative word. See reasons two and three)
2) I have bugger all work to do, so this will kill an hour of my day
3) I can go lunch late, meaning my afternoon will go quicker!
4) I have no money to go to the pub, so I wouldn't have gone anyway

Win:Win for me ;)

This evening I'm going to Phil's house and he's cooking me dinner. I was in a grumpy mood with him yesterday for no apparent reason but luckily I didn't see him so he won't know I was grumpy with him lol 

What's even better is that apparently his brother will be out tonight. He's going trampolining. No, I don't get it either, but it gets him out of the house! So we'll get to watch whatever we want on the TV and actually be alone in his house for a change! I think we'll probably watch the third Harry Potter film because we're gradually working through 1-5 since we saw 6 at the cinema. 

I'm in a much better mood since volunteering to go on reception. The thought of another four hours stuck at my desk with shit all to do was making me sad! We'll ignore the fact that people keep phoning and I have no idea what to tell them or who to direct them to ;)"

"event","Right, I refuse to moan about work again. For the foreseeable future, just assume it's shit.

Instead, I shall focus on the good :D Taco night was gooooooooood last night :D Tomorrow night I'm going to Phil's house for enchiladas (apparently it's Mexican week lol) and to watch a film. Then Saturday night I'm going out to dinner for my friend's 30th birthday and there will be many many cocktails as Phil has offered to drive me and pick me up! He'll stay over that night and we'll both go for a nice walk on Sunday, followed by a pub roast, watching Mary Poppins (my favourite film ever, he still hasn't watched it) and then some nice sandwiches for tea!

At some point we might do some DIY because my towel rail is pants and I really need a new one lol Phil ""Mr Fix It"" wants to take off the old one, fit a new one and fill holes/repaint lol If he wants to do it, who am I to stop him ;D"

"event","<b>Who are we to be the judge, jury and executioner? Think about how you treat others because one day you could be in their shoes.</b>

1) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, liposuction and air conditioning.

2) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.

3) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.

4) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.

5) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Brittany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.

6) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.

7) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.

8) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.

9) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.

10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans...

<b>Copy this to your journal if you believe in legalizing gay marriage!</b>

I don't know what to do. I'm praying that the person who takes over from the woman who sits next to me when she goes on maternity leave a Christmas <i>actually speaks</i>.

He looked after me so well. Made me dinner (ordered and paid for a takeaway curry ;D), let me watch America's Next Top Model (first one of the new series, I'd forgotten to Sky+ it), made me tea, cuddled me and made me laugh. I almost completely forgot about my shit day and felt 100 times better.

Then we fell asleep cuddled up together, my head resting on the new pillows he'd bought for me previously ;D

He's such a good boyfriend :D"

During play preparation time... you complain so much. You are just waiting for it to be over, you complain about annoying people in the cast, early rehersals..

But then it ends... and you suddenly find yourself with nothing to do on the weekends... You don't have an excuse to just hang around with those people that you have been practically living with for the past weekends anymore.

"event","SO today was fun. I am now handling the props for A Nightmare Before Christmas at and I met the pretty much famous Danny and Matt Burns. (Jeremy wasn't there today) and to put things simple. Everything is Danny's fault. Everyone has a secret obsession with Matt Burns. And Jeremy is the mullet. 

My god I loved Danny the best though. ( I got to know him the best and such) He can make me laugh without even trying. (he knows it too. we were talking about my laugh and I said it is hard for people to make me laugh so hard I go into this weird giggle thing and he said 'well I seem to have no trouble doing that. you have been laughing all day')

After practice me, Arielle, and Aileen went to the mall. And Danny called up Arielle and complained he was bored so he came too. And it was great. I had so much fun. And I got to know Danny pretty well too.

...too bad Loren had to go and ruin everything by being a little baby. She wouldn't have had fun anyway. She hates Arielle. Her and Aileen aren't together anymore. She knows she has pretty much lost me. And Danny.. while he is an extremly friendly person and really easy to get along with... I don't think he would has liked her on the basis that Arielle hates her. He wouldn't even try it. He would take arielles advice and stay away from her.

Feh.. Isn't my fault she drove off all her friends."

Foust even keeps asking me whats wrong (after seeing me all day pretty much today he can tell I guess) and he told me that he has helped student who were feeling suicidal and depressed and stuff get through their problems. I just kept telling him that there was nothing wrong though. Cause I don't want to talk to people about things that I am thinking. I don't like it. But he is right that there is something wrong cause after Itzel left the art labs to wash the boards and Fousty left after checking yet again if I was ok I had a breakdown all by my lonesome in the art labs. It was only a small one though. Which is a positive thing! Maybe I won't hit a big one. 

What I just find really funny is my art teacher realises there is something wrong and offers help before the one who says she is my 'best friend' does."

"event","So... halloween... I love that holiday... so much. It is my favorite holiday. But why must people almost ruin it? Why couldn't they go away sooner?

Getting ready was great. Just me, Itzel, Aileen, and school Tara getting ready at aileens house. (for hours...) Tara... was a pirate. I... Was Gerard Way(bar and all) Aileen... Was Frank Iero.... And Itzel... Was Patient gone bloody somehow... It was so much fun getting ready. Blasting music.. I got sprayed in the eye with one of the three cans of white hair spray I emptied... four people needing to work on my makeup to get me to look less like a clown and more like a vampire... Trying to draw the X's on Aileens eyes with Itzel shouting random words to make us laugh.. Steve the Grim Reaper decoration commiting suicide off aileen's porch (even though there were chunks of wood holding it down.. scary..) It was just fun.

Then we go to Itzels house.. and Katie Loren and Tara from st. rochs meet up with us. And it all goes downhill... AIleen is bound to them. Her and Loren are the only things holding the two otherwise completely seperate groups we have evolved into together. And she gets ignored as it is. It is going downhill too. She is like... an aquaintence with benefits. (quote from her) And I was getting all breakdownish and shouting that I hope that they drown in their addictions and that I hope that they really became roadkill and that I hoped that their cigarets would get taken from them and they would hit the worst withdrawal possible. (I cracked after Loren walked right infront of me with her stupid cigarete knowing that I can't take it and it makes me cough terribly. And this is after ignoring my existance on the earth)

I wasn't happy untill they stopped following and layed down in the middle of the street the rest of the night. Then I became hyper and skipped around in a circle dancing with aileen and such. But still.. I am tired of either hiding from them or being all angry. We are two seperate groups now. And it is stupid. I am sick of it and I am sick of them."

And I am sick.. of hearing things are getting worse..
And I am sick... of hearing that people are saying bad things about me when I am not there...
And I am sick... Of hearing the only one that cares besides Aileen, Tara and Itzel that I am not around.. Is Foust.
And I am sick.. that these same people who couldn't care less now... Complain that I am drifting from them.
I am Sick of this whole situation in general.
I have to question myself. If they were gone. Would I even care.
I wouldn't really care.
I am sick of evil thought that I really wouldn't care.
Last year I would of cared.
Three months ago I would have cared.
Why don't I care anymore?
Why were things never fixed?
I don't want them there on halloween.
I would like to just cut them out from all the things that they ruin for us.
I want to have FUN.
FUN in art club.
FUN going out for pizza with Itzel.
FUN going to aileens house in the morning to watch music videos and nap on her couch.
FUN when I went to the mall with Aileen for the listening party.
FUN singing and listening to and writing fan fiction about My Chemical Romance.
FUN on halloween.
I don't want to have to deal with complaints just because THEY don't like it.
They have to learn to give and take.
You have to be flexible.
Put up with things that you don't like.
We do it for them.
They need to too.
I don't want to go to lunch with them tomorrow.
I want to sit up in the art labs with Itzel.
And maybe even Erika.
And that one is weird.
But I would rather deal with her than the people I never used to want to leave.
The ones that I would have done anything for.
But they are just pissing me off now. 
I just want them to go away.
I don't want to deal with people going through withdrawal.
Smoking.
Poping advil.
I have had enough.
I am openminded..
But being left alone in a corner while they smoke.
Only to have them walk over once and a while to have them say..
""oh poor Rosie""
""I am proud you stand up to peer pressure""
I am not standing up to peer pressure.
I am not around you so that I won't start smoking.
I am not around you because it makes me cough.
I can't stand the smoke.
You people all knew that.
And you are making me feel like crap because of it.
Like me not being able to take inhaling the second hand smoke..
Means I don't fit in with you people.
I can't help it.
I don't do that stuff.
I don't smoke.
I don't drink.
I don't do drugs.
I don't pop pills.
Deal with it.
Just don't dump me off in a corner.
And then ask me what wrong.
And why I am angry with you.
It is pretty obvious.
When I am doing you a stupid FAVOR.
To help YOUR grade.
And you leave me by MYSELF.
Why you go off and KILL yourself off.
I have had enough of everything."

"event","So Fall Festival time. Fun Times. Friday... If it wasen't for Michael... I wouldn't have gone on any rides until after Katie left. Because.. It was Itzel and Tara on rides.. And Katie and Loren. Which sucks. Cause sometimes I really feel like I am not needed places. Because Katie sticks to Loren like she is permantly glued to her. And if her dearest Loren is pulled away and has to deal with something being wrong with Aileen or something.. she gets all depressed. And then Itzel is just closer to me than the others... but Tara would drag her on everything. And if Tara gets left alone... then SHE goes emo. So when Michael tackled us, tugged at my jacked sleve to see if I had the wristband, and declared that I was going on the ride with him (multiple times till he got bored and hungry) I was pretty happy cause I wouldn't have to be alone. (and he is just plain funny and makes me not care that I wasn't chosen to go one with anyone else) Although I was eventually when I got pulled over by them to a different ride and then left as they paired up and went on. (I ended up finding Michael again and followed him) But.. I dunno... it bothers me that they can just up and leave me out like that. And Loren only went on rides with me when Katie refused and then went home. I told Aileen everything.. and she thought that was terrible that they did that. Cause it is ALWAYS done. Expecially with Katie and Loren. It is just like... a lack of caring that people are being left out of jokes and other things."

So yea... I made my journal ugly like. Cause I got sick of the old layout. I reeeealy don't like it... but I am too lazy to change it. I gotta update my userinfo too... ugh.. I might just wipe the whole account and make a new one. This name is pissing me off anyway. 

But yea.. in other news people are annoying. I spent most of this week yelling I wanted to kill someone. Like in art when this girl who.. may sound mean but who smell reeeeally badly sat next to me and my friend Tara (not the one from St. Rochs) like.. Cringed. And then ANOTHER girl who drives me crazy sat down at our table and Foust had JUST said we could only have five and now we had six. So I spent the whole class twitching and shouting that there was too many people and that someone had better get up before I bite them. All while clinging to my cd player blasting MCR cause they were playing Justin Timberlake x__X 

Today also there was this whole thing where I went around campus I was gonna beat someone with my binder. I think I have managed to scare a few people. I was drawing some picture today and I was told by Janice that she thinks that I am going to actually kill someone someday. It made me crack up laughing so its a good thing no one cares about Mr. J's class.

And in other other news... tomorrow is dress down.. for the walkathon kickoff... my grade color is yellow... I OWN no yellow. I was complaining to Smerina (homeroom teacher) about this and said I plan to wear black. He didn't seem to care. (he nevers cares.. you used to be able to pay your way out of detention if you were late till he got yelled at for that)"

And I laugh at how when Loren uses Katie to hide from her problems (cause becca and aileen ARE the problem and I will only let her hide the necessary time for her mental health before making her face the problem) and Katie takes the bait everytime. Cause it means she get attention from Loren which she dosen't get otherwise. 

The whole bus stop time today Loren either spent ignoring me/telling me not to follow her when she would run off or leaning against me/hugging me asking what she should do. But she made her choice because she was pressured to. I hope it is the right one this time.

Which is why I will meet her at the transfer stop even though it is likely I will be alone there. Cause I promised her I would stay by her side throughout this when she asked me to. And it may have an early start. so I have to be there.

Although the situation does have some pluses with all the bad. Loren should finally be happy for at least a little while after all this is said and done and the pain passes. And it has also brought me and Loren closer as friends. I would ask her what was wrong and she would tell me things that she was thinking and feeling and things that she has been thinking and feeling for a while. I felt very trusted for once with her. and she let me hug her for a change when she was shaking or close to crying. So I ended up hugging her quite a lot. having someone there seemed to help.

with the closeness though came painful sleeping for me. she discovered I am comfortable to lay on and she slept with her legs up on me. Leaving me to sleep kinda crooked with lieing on the arm of the couch or on her knees with the pillow at least. (we must have looked extremly strange to Itzel's random family members who walked into the living room)but it seemed to calm her a bit having someone close by like that so I dealt with it. And I found out a lot about her last night cause after Itzel fell asleep me and her stayed up real late talking about nothing at all. We were delirious so not funny things were very funny. 

It would be nice if she would give me my jacket back though. I miss my jacket and hers is strange. although warmer than mine.

But really that is one creeeeepy picture. And When I told Loren it scared me and pissed me off she agreed. It made me laugh that she agreed.

There is also the time this morning when she made Loren change the quote thing on her myspace cause it said ""KFC is our home. Me, Rose, Rebecca, Itzel, and Aileen"" and her name wasen't there and she flipped out and said Loren makes her said and that she was gonna cry.

And then when she made Loren change her phone to saying something about 'Jebo'(grrr.... that nickname.... again.... pisses us ALL off so much) loving 'KT' I growled slightly from my spot next to Loren. I think she heard me cause she laughed and looked at me after Katie turned around.

And Becca told me during lunch that I act as if nothing happened. Boyyy if she knew what I was really feeling. She would be scared. But I bottle it so I walk around all depressed all day cause I still reeeeeeallyyyy need to talk to Loren. 

Feh I wish I could though. Cause she is fighting for a place that she can't have. The spot of Loren's best friend. Thats MY spot as declared by Loren. It took quite a while but Loren is starting to really trust me! Becca said that Loren told her that she trusts me more than anyone (except Becca obviously) And she says to me that I am her best friend and not to worry about Katie. (Although I still have doubts.

I am scared of what is going to happen. Even when I hear Loren say ""Why would I believe her? You are my best friend"" Even though I know I am right. I have proof that I am right. And other facts not even having to do with that particular statement to back up what I am saying. I know I am right cause Loren says that I am right about certain things. Like when the things she says hurt Loren. Since when did this shift to be between me and Katie?

And I LOOOVE how the only friendship she cares about the friendship between her and Loren. Not between me and her or her and Itzel and Aileen who are mad at her cause of what she is doing. Or Rebecca who will side with Loren on this cause Katie has left her before and of course... ... I will stop there. But yea. Sorry Katie.. you lost Loren a while ago."

"event","Ok so time for stuff I left out yesterday. Well my wrist is starting to hurt again ever since bowling... fun... really..

Anyway. Yesterday Becca came over my house and then we took the bus over to Aileens house and proceeded on the hour long walk to Loren's house. (which she couldn't hint any more at the fact she wanted us to come over the night before)

Loren gave me more matches when we got there (about 250 woo!) And we got to see her room which was interesting in itself... (not what you would expect it to be) We found out the adress to her parents house (by looking at her reportcard. she forgot that it was printed on there as her adress) so now when she tries to hide like she did last weekend we can hunt her down. and... uh... we lit a bonfire in her backyard! (A couple of times...) and just in general had fun with matches :x

Hmm.. well she got picked up around three to go to some concert that starts at 7:30.... she was annoyed with her stepfather needless to say. so we had to go. After spending some time at aileens house we went to the spring festival at St. Rochs. Rebecca and Aileen met MC. that was interesting in itself. 

Becca- -gets prepared to throw gum in MC's hair on strawberry ride-
MC- You wouldn't. You're just jealous that you can't have this.
Becca- I'm gay.
MC- well you are just jealous that you can't have the hair.

ahahaha and we found out Aileen can't take too much spinning. after two times on the strawberry with MC spinning.. she ended up vomiting in a garbage pail. It was funny. And Loren had given me a dollar to win her something and I got her she weird smily thingy... it is purple... and strange... but whatever. It is for her anyway. Lol"

But after we were done and Loren and Aileen left... Rebecca told me one of the things that has been bothering Loren was that she felt that Aileen was replacing her in my life. I started to like cry. I felt so bad that something I was doing was making her feel that way. Rebecca made me talk to her and tell her what I thought on that. About how no one could replace her in my life and how she is the person that I pretty much trust the most. She said that hearing that she felt better but she feels like Aileen is like.. Pulling me away from her... Like.. how Aileen will talk to me more or pull me along with her. I really wanted to hug the girl but of course.. she had already left the alley so I couldn't. Buty then later that night me and rebecca had threewayed her and we talked (becca had her fill me in a bit on what was going on and had us talk) and after we four wayed Aileen later me and Loren talked more to each other while they were quieter.

"event","Before I go off on the tangent that this turns out to be. Loren was off halfway through the movie we went to the see and distant and stuff... I wish we knew what was wrong with her. And I wish she was better. 

So we went to the movies today. Aileen and Loren headed over to my area and we ate at KFC then went to see scary movie four. Was funny. Well... actually.. It was supposed to be: Me, Loren, Aileen, Chelsea, and Katie. But... when we got there... Loren called Katie on my phone.. and she said she wasen't going. We were ticked off cause Katie was the one who decided to go to the movies. And that wasen't the first time she did that. She did that when me and Loren went to see Rent together. She did that last friday at the mall. Today. and once she said she would meet us at the mall at like two and came at six. (After I had left so this is second hand knowledge I have heard ranted many times) and then made dinner plans with some friends, not said anything about Loren and Aileen being invited. So they ditched her. And it isn't like we are too happy with Katie anyway. Being with her and Janice is like SUICIDE and with Chelsea it is even worse... it is like signing your will right there.  (this is going to rant mode...) SHe has called me and Aileen 'accessories' to Loren and Rebecca. (Loren was MAAAD about this one and she went off on a rant how I was her first friend and her best friend since the beginning. made me smile. =) and how me and aileen would never be accessories) Said Kyra 'nosed' her way into everyone's problems and was strange for wanting to hang out with freshmen so much (we <3 Kyra and she dosen't 'nose' her way in we tell her what is going on and she tells us her things) She said Arielle was goth (she is but still) and that she dosen't fit in (I <3 Arielle! I sit with her at lunch everyday! [and Aileen.. and of course Loren and Hee-eun!]) and I think she said stuff about Itzel too. AND SHE IS SUCH A FRICKEN' INFANT ABOUT THINGS! you say ONE LITTLE thing (even if you don't mean it and it just comes out wrong) and she flips out and starts crying. Like when she was making fun of Loren cause she choked on gum (I know why Loren was upset cause she trusted me enough to tell me. made me feel nice even if it was just a tiny thing. coming from Loren it is HUGE to hear anything) and Loren was a bit annoyed and upset so she wasen't talking to her and wouldn't look at anyone and she went into Mrs. Pags room for math help and Katie was singing and dancing to 'make her feel better'(and making fun of things in the song like her curly hair and bangs and her skirt being long) and I could tell it was hurting her more(cause I have known her since the beginning so I can pick up when something that was said makes her upset) and she was trying to concentrate on showing what she figured out with the math to Arielle and I told her that making fun of her more probably isn't gonna help (I know I was right cause not only did Loren not correct me but I told her why I said it later and she agreed with me) and she got sooo annoyed and stormed out an like.. declared it war against me and Loren. and was crying to Rebecca and stuff. (me and Loren of course. did not care.) and me and her started to yell at each other going to homeroom. but she gave up by Bio. and the time that she sprayed that cage cleaner on Loren (and in her mouth) and she started turning red (she getslike that when even hand soap is put on her face of neck) and me and aileen went to go get water for her to rinse her mouth and clean the stuff off of her she spazed out and started crying and everything. So Loren had to go without it. It is really annoying!

Also. The culture day trip. Everything got messed with cause NDA hates the freshmen (we are too much for them and challenge them to much heh. they got a vandalist... take over the vandalists job people... so many gays and bisexuals.. it is hilarious we are such a challenge for them to control!) So going on the Museum of Tv and Radio is me, Loren, Arielle, Katie and the sophmores. (the ones we talk to) and all Katie has said since she found out she was going there was how much she wants to go to the Aquarium with everyone else. Sure. me and Loren were mad too when we first found out. and we knew Arielle would probably be talking to the sophmores the whole time. But we figured. Hey. We got each other. We'll be fine. But it apparently isn't good enough for her. Me and Loren were talking about that today on the bus ride back. I mean. Why don't you just say you don't wanna go on the culture day trip with us dear god. 

...there is still more. I really need to clear this out of my head. just ranting with Loren and Aileen dosen't help fully. Katie cares so much about what Loren says, what Loren thinks. It is so annoying! (even for Loren) Once. Loren was trying to put something as her backround on her phone and could only fit Jebu (she pronounced it jebo) and Katie KEEPS ON CALLING HER THAT. it annoys us SO MUCH. (and annoys Loren. we asked.) It makes her sound like a Male gang clown or something! and she does the KT loves JeBo thing and Loren does it back even when two minutes before she was saying how much she can't stand her to me (Aileen dosen't understand why but I think I know after what Loren said to me) and on her phone she at one time (she has the cool VCast.. until she shut it in a car door... she is getting a new one.) she had a picture of katie on the front and it said JeBo loves KT (she made her put it) and Loren changed it to this really pretty picture of a flower she took (She takes some really pretty pictures with that phone) and had Jebus Biscus as the banner.. cause thats her ACTUAL nickname. not 'Jebo' and when katie saw that she flipped out took her phone, ran up the hill with it (we saw some more pretty flowers too =( ) and changed it back on her. THat was really NOT right. (Loren agrees and it is (was...) now back to normal. and will be again once she gets the new one) Just.. RAWR WHYYYY does she CARE so much about what she thinks and what she does! I mean Loren may be a cool person to hang out with and stuff (and has a big ego cause of it lol) but coming from the first new person she knew at NDA... she isn't the world's most important person. she does have her flaws (we accept them of course but still.) hmm... now I am as annoyed as worried about Loren..."

she told things to rebecca that we don't think that she means. Rebecca said she is gonna get her help and keeps telling me not to worry but it isn't calming me. Loren won't open up. no one even knows what is wrong with her! not even Rebecca! the past two nights she has been like this and last night not only was she trying to saw her hand off with a metrocard but she said she walked from the house we all know (her grandfathers house I think) to some other house (I dunno whose random family member #1? her parents??

Also I had to go home early today and we were in the library building and I had to go and she is like oh lets go guys and she got everyone to go down to the bus stop and I figured they would hang out there after I left and then when the 67 came she got everyone on that first bus too.

No one DARES say anything about Loren right now though (she knows about it though) they probally think that she will beat them up. I don't doubt it. and she didn't say anything... but after yesterday I think that eventhough she said don't worry about the rumor, it might be hurting her too cause rumors are what made her cry yesterday. But it is quietly understood that the experience of her crying would never again be mentioned outside of the group or at all for that matter. I was worried about the both of them all day.

Speaking of myself my emotions are all out of whack. I was blank for most of the day but off and on I had to fight off tears. And on the bus I was depressive too. (I am sure that I would have been fine if was just me and Loren on the bus but Katie and Chelsea were there too and it made me worse) But yea. No reason for this either. And whenever anyone asked me if I was alright I had to like hide cause I would feel like crying and had to hold it back. It was pretty bad.

Hmm what else happened. Well Mrs. Estrella was given my binder yesterday cause I of course skipped out of French cause I was in guidance and people had found it and brought it to her class... and apparently the Juniors were going through it and everything and showed her my Johnny the Homicidal maniac issue I had in there and the two Lenore issues. She confronted me about them and asked like... isn't there anything better you could be reading... and why do you read this... and this isn't appropriate for you... and this is bad for you to be reading.. I wanted to tell her to shut up that it is none of her buisness what I read and that it is just for entertainment not a guidebook for how to live my life. I am not retarded. I am not gonna read it and base my life on Nny's life."

-breathes slowly- anyway in more detail. We decided everything that has been going on went far enough (but you don't know the EVERYTHING it ties in with everything else that has been going on recently) and me Aileen Loren and Arielle went to guidance (later joined by Megan, Rebecca, for a few moments Melinda before she ran out, Katie unfortunatly, at one point Hee-eun... all over the course of our over 80 mins there) and I got to skip french and gym. but it wasen't something to be happy about. Loren, right before we went into the big room when melinda came up but before we saw her and after rebecca and megan came crashing into the small office screaming and yelling, started to cry. slowly at first and she tried to hide it but by the time we went into the big room she was in hysterics. and Mrs Parici didn't want us on the floor around her so whenever she left we dove to her on the floor surrounding her and were hugging her and comforting her (melinda ran out after Loren started to talk still crying hysterically) and listening to Loren talk and seeing her cry killed me. I am used to seeing Rebecca and Aileen cry and it still makes me sad but seeing a girl who never crys crying hysterically never mind my very first friend  there and one of my best friends was killing me. I was sitting there and as she talked tried more and more to curl up into a ball and hid in my arms to block out the image and the sound of her talking. I felt so helpless not being able to get up and help her... so I tried to hide. she said that she couldn't stand another rumor about her and that everyone already thought of her a a freak and when melinda ran out right after we all dove at her (I couldn't get at her to hug her myself but I kneeled as close to her as I can and was like practically leaning on her arm and we were like it dosen't matter if you are a freak and I told her how she was my first friend and my best friend and that it didn't matter what everyone else thought about her. after we all told her our parts of how we cared about her she calmed down a bit. but yea. that was only one thing that happened that upset me."

But Loren said somethings that made me want to hug her, thank her, and start crying. It was nice to hear from someone that I really thought did not trust me. Itzel got kicked out due to having no attention span, I was silent, Rebecca and Aileen were crying, and Lorens voice was so small and hurt sounding the whole time. She wouldn't look at anyone either. 

Today however.. was a pretty good day. Rebecca had to go for tutoring unfortunatly. And Katie, Janice, and Chelsea fortunatly took the first bus that came. So it was just me Aileen and Loren. There was no stress or anything it was just us hanging out like friends should. And after Aileen left and it was just me and Loren there were no awkward silences or anything we kept talking the whole time aobut nothing in particular. She did my french homework (even though she is a spanish child) and gave me a list of songs for a cd. But it was like... nice you know without anything stressful or awkward about the situation. It was so peaceful and like how normal friendships should be....

... Although I suppose if it was like that all the time then we wouldn't be as close as we are. So maybe it is good that we are far from the norm... in some ways anyway. The stress and tears is something we could ALL deal without."

Annyyy Loren went home early today. I sat in the office with her for a while until I HAD to go to math and Loren told me to forget about her an just go. 

Hmm lastnight I was on the phone with Rebecca who knows more about Loren's family situation. Apparently there is like... no one to take proper responsibility for Loren. And if I knew the whole story I would probally want to cry everytime I thought about it Rebecca said. But of course it wasen't her place to tell me so I will just have to wait for Loren to tell me... if she ever does.. dosen't seem like she will. No wonder why she said no one cared that she got three progress reports.. maybe there was no one to care how she does in school... and that whole thing with her mom changing her mind about going to the fashion show... I feel so incredibly bad for her I can't even describe it... never mind the fact that I worry about how she does after she leaves us.. it is starting to show that she is upset at times... like when no one was around to pick her up except her uncle and she couldn't even get in touch with him she had to have her grandfather ask... now that I think of it... I dunno if she even got picked up by him... she never responded to my text message... now I am worried more.

soo tomorrow we may be going to either.... Movies. Mall. Diner. Bowling. I wish someone would decide."

Me and Rebecca took the 53 with her (cause she transfers) and she pointed out the return stop and when we tried to follow her to her house she turned around and started screaming at us to go home (she had been telling us since before we got off the 67 but not yelling) so we start heading to the 53 stop and as soon as she see that we are leaving and stops turning around we run after her and tail her all the way up richmond road (she was out of earshot so we could talk and stuff) through all the construction and traffic until we see her turn up to her house. And Rebecca calls her and goes Loren look out your window... right now. and Loren was standing at the door and saying on the phone oh you suck and stuff and goes to get changed. and then when she comes out she gives us the wonderful news that as soon as she left the door she puked... on her shirt... and more pleasent details about the soda and the chicken and yea.. bleh. She is just lucky that she is like one of my best friends and that I can deal with the sickness (Rebecca has puked before when me and aileen were ON THE PHONE with her... and Aileen was eating... I was laughing at that fact that you can hear her loud and clear puking in the backround and Aileen is just munching away on the chicken)so she is sitting outside with us in a light jacket shaking cause she is cold but we couldn't go inside (I think it was her grandfathers house that we discovered cause it was her grandfather that was there but there was also obvious signs that she had lived there for quite a long time... like the pink bikes that she admitted were hers in the garage) so we go into the basement and were talking a bit until Loren said that she was about to puke again so she started yelling at us again and kicked us out. Poor girl though... not only does she try and keep us from her house for whatever reason but now she can't even keep down water because of whatever she has....

And I think I am starting to get what she has... wonderful."

"event","You know... Life just does not get any easier! This whole entire situation just gets more and more and more difficult by the day with like... no hope. 

However some good does come with the bad. Me and Aileen are like... inseperable at times now. (I am even first on her top 8 on myspace which isn't really important but it like... makes me feel good that she thinks that I deserve that spot. It also makes me feel a bit like crying.) and we pulled Loren aside and told her how she can tell us anything... anything at all and we will listen and I think it like got through to her... kinda... at least she wasen't looking all over the place and avoiding eye contact like she usually does. It is a good sign. I know that it is killing Loren that Aileen won't tell her whats wrong right now cause I can just tell by the way she looks at us with her expression full of pain.. but Aileen just can't. and if the story was known it makes sense why. And Loren is still taking Advil even though she told us she wasen't... that makes me feel terrible too. 

Hmm well there is also lots of bad. I am failing two classes. Of course it is always a plus isn't it?? and Melinda is writing Moose on all the desks now cause she finds it funny. I want to scream at her. I AM GLAD YOU FIND MY PAIN FUNNY. I AM GLAD THAT YOU FIND AMUSEMENT AT PEOPLE HISSING MOOSE IN MY EAR AND BAD MOUTHING ME JUST BECAUSE THEY KNOW I CAN HERE THEM. I AM GLAD THAT IS FRICKEN FUNNY TO YOU CAUSE ITS NOT FUNNY TO ME. but... Melinda wasen't there when I was told about this... so I proceeded to shout it out at random passerby on the way to the bus stop and scare Aileen and Loren who happened to be standing near me. I am also mad at that girl for other reasons. Them being: She thinks she has a right to follow Aileen and me to guidance because she thinks she is involved and she isn't. At all. ( I ranted to Aileen about that last night on the phone at like... 11 at night when I was talking to her.) and that she told Aileen that she can't talk to Loren. LOREN IS ONE OF HER BEST FRIENDS! WHY SHOULDN""T SHE TALK TO HER???!!! 

feh. well anyway. me and Aileen DID get to guidance today. which is something. and we missed some of music and she is gonna call us back tomorrow. cause we like... shocked her with how complicated the story is. Cause when you are hearing it... it starts off as nothing... but builds and builds and builds getting worse and worse and more and more complicated. Her eyes were a bit wide when we were kinda done. It was funny. 

Hmm... there is still more! Itzel was telling me things today that I thought I would never hear from her. She almost starting crying on me. Which I know she never does and says she hasen't done since she was eight. I just wish she wouldn't continue with the razors. =( It worries me so much.

I have no emotion currently... That means I am getting closer to a breakdown. Wonderful... just wonderful."

"event","I am worried. Aileen is still in pieces and I am still the only one who knows the whole truth. (if the whole story is know it all makes a lot of sense) she is telling everyone else lies. and Loren is worried about her cause she didn't tell her anything and she is acting different towards her now so we think she knows. But Loren is also acting different towards me which isn't good cause I really really just want her to trust me because I worry about her so much now. Expecially now that she had MORE advill with her today and Arielle fricken gave her two more after! I think she took them back though. which is good cause four will get her started taking like six all over again. Me and Aileen think she may be acting different towards me cause Aileen told me everything and not her. But it isn't my fault Aileen told me!"

"event","So I sewed up yesterday's hole in my sweater...  and proceeded to bite two more in it that need to be sewed. as well as two chunks of skin from my fingers... can't sew that. And I started crying on the bus as soon as Loren got off because sometimes other peoples problems bother her. So since I was crying Rebecca wouldn't let me go home and bought me a Big Gulp soda from 7-11 and a slice of pizza and then some gum and was walking around with me until I was a bit better. and they know that I know what was up with Aileen but I can't possibly tell them. and another pleasent thought. Ms won't open up still is starting to take Advill again. she worries me to death when she does that and she still dosen't trust me."

"event","lol today was great. well it was the st. patricks day parade and I went with Tara and Steph and we met up with Loren, Aileen, and Katie. and Loren picked up a beer sign and when we got to where we were standing we wrote will break dance for beer on it and katie wrote it on her pants and Loren would hold the sign up at people and this one guy pulls out a can of beer and holds it out to her and tells her to dance and she told him no and when he was walking away she yelled out that it was the wrong brand. so yea we kept that up for a while and like yelled out and people and stuff while they went by in the parade and booed Mr. Met and yelled that we wanted to stab him... hmm what else...OH YEA! 

this like five year old was swearing and Loren told him to watch his language and he flipped her off and she was like oh I can do that too and flipped him off back and like he swore at her and she ran after him yelling like you wanna start something and such and he kept flipping her off and his like little sister walks out and goes to her oh well at least I don't have braces and she ran after them again yelling and suddenly the boys mother like takes him by the neck and pulls him back and he started shaking the barriers and yelling about her braces and Loren is ranting about him.  

well after it was over steph went home with her dad and it was just me, Tara, Loren, Aileen, and Katie and this guy in a red kilt read the sign and hands Aileen his beer to hold and starts breakdancing and then takes the beer back from her. it was insanely hilarious. and katie left and we went to Kings Arms and we were talking to this drunk guy who was saying something about this imaginary gay guy hitting on him... it was funny. and after that we left. and as a side note... there are a bunch of things with moose written on them now... I am waiting for Mr. Hernon to come after me again."

"event","second update of today! I almost had a nervous breakdown during a global quiz today! High school drama is very unhealthy for a person's mental health. Too bad my group seems to draw more of it than your average group of highschool friends. although then again... we seem to have a lot of emotional problems mushed into one group... maybe thats why... too bad I can't type ANYTHING about the situation cause it might help to type it out. ... ah well breakdown here I come!"

"event","hmm... I don't remember what happened today that I was supposed to put... I was thinking of this all during school but now I don't remember.... Ah well. 

We asked Mrs. O if they found Moose and she wouldn't give us a direct answer but Adrianna is suspended so I think we are good. AND EVERYONE STILL THINKS IT'S ME! I swear Alexa was going ""we all know who Moose really is"" and Hee-eun said she pointed at me (I wasen't paying attention cause she was making me sick bad talking me while right behind me.)

And we gotta go back to the skirts soon.... ew. And it is kinda sad if you were to lind up me and all of my friends.... it would be all short skirts until you hit me and Loren. Ours always ends up falling at or below our knees. It is kinda sad... (well mine is HUGE and it is a kilt thingy and looks odd when it is rolled...)

::EDIT::

I remember now! It was me Loren Arielle and Hee-eun at lunch today (Like always since the very beginning of the year) and Arielle tell us after Loren finally sits down with her food that we now have a reputation among the teachers for being 'tough'. She said Mr. Foust told her that last art club (I didn't go) And I found that very amusing that they think that about us..."

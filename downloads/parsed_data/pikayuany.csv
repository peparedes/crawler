Madden is awesome.BTW Sandoval is EA Sports' director of athlete relations.
 EA Sports ran a teaser for its next-generation Madden game, a digital Donovan McNabb tossing a touchdown to Terrell Owens.

Twenty minutes passed. Ring! Sandoval answered his phone. On the line? Jacksonville quarterback Byron Leftwich.

Sandy, I got to get that.

Byron, calm down. The game doesn't come out for months.

No, I have to get that right now.

""I couldn't believe it,"" recalls Sandoval, EA Sports' director of athlete relations. ""He kept going on about it. Then I ran into Byron at the ESPYs. It wasn't even, 'Hey, how are you?' It's just, 'Where's my Madden?'""
Sandoval isn't exaggerating. Last year, he gave a preview copy of Madden to Oakland's Jerry Porter, touching off a locker room bidding war. One teammate offered Porter $1,500 for the game.
True story: About a month ago, Reid and Sandoval were chatting on the phone.

Sandoval: ""Andy, you owe me. You look nice and slim in this year's Madden.""

Reid: ""Sandy, I gotta get a copy. I want my wife to see how I looked in my heyday.""
 
Case in point: A few years back, one of Sandoval's coworkers had a neighbor who played college football. The kid wanted an office tour. Sandoval obliged, gave him some free games, sat him down in his office. On the back wall were autographed photos of Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, Muhammad Ali.

""Sandy, I want to get on your wall,"" the kid said.

""Well, you've got to be a pretty big hitter to get up there,"" Sandoval replied.

More recently, the two met again -- this time at the Pro Bowl. The kid's name? Tom Brady.

""He says, 'Let's take a picture right now, so I can get on your wall,'"" Sandoval said. ""I was a little embarrassed.""

Comes with the territory. When Sony released the PS2 in the fall of 2000, Sandoval took a call from Kevin Spacey. Thinking it was a prank, he hung up on the actor. Not once. Not twice. Three times.

Today, Sandoval knows better. Andy Roddick, Snoop Dogg, the guys from ""Entourage"" and the Anaheim Angels are among those who have contacted EA Sports, asking -- read: begging -- for an advance copy of Madden.

OMG ITS MADDEN"

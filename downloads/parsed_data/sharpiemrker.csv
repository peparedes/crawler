Nov. 2 I went home to vote!  It was great!  It was also the first time I didn't cry when I had to say goodbye again to my mom...aren't you proud of me?!

That following Saturday, Tommy and I celebrated our 2 year anniversary...I can't even believe that it has been two years!  It seems sooo unreal!  Well our anniversary wasn't until Monday, but we celebrated on Saturday.  We had a picnic lunch and then watched Radio.  For dinner, Tommy brought me to the Blue Oak Cafe which is at the Nathan Hall Inn.  OH MY GOD!  It was BEYOND delicious!  It was incredible!  I even got to have cheesecake for dessert!  We had a really great day.

The next day gram and pa came to visit.  We all went to the mall and they brought us to Macaroni Grill!  WHAT A GREAT WEEKEND!

The next week was blah.  Except for the fact Tommy and I went to the dairy bar, nothing much happened.  Friday Aunt Marcey and Uncle Joe came to visit and brought us to Outback.  Then we went to Husky Latenight...We played minigolf with Laura, Ralph, and Keith for 40 minutes to see if we could get holes in one so that someone could win the x-box that was up for grabs...(side note:  Tommy won it!).  Saturday we went to NYC with the Shipps to see Rent...I thought it was ok, but I LOVEDDDD being in NYC!  Except for some minor setbacks, it was a great time.  I got a T-Shirt that says ""I Love P, B, & J.""  I wanted to get one that said ""What the duck?"" with a picture of a duck, but they only had XL.  I also got 2 pairs of earrings...

That night I passed out!

One more week until Thankgiving!  I can't wait...I have a paper that I should be writing right now...so I better go do that...:-/

I HOPE EVERYONE HAS A GREAT THANKSGIVING!

""doing"" Plato...

love you!

"event","So I haven't updated since Friday, and due to the fact that I am procrastinating, I will recap my weekend.  

Friday night, hmmmm..., what did I do Friday night? Oh yes, it was homecoming this weekend so Tommy and I went to the lip sync concert and we saw the shipps there, but unfortunately they were working so we didn't sit with them.  I have been sick for the past week, so we only stayed for 6 acts, but it was awesome!  I really enjoyed it.  Then, we to my dorm and decided to watch a movie.  The end.

Saturday I didn't go to the game so I met Allison at the Co-Op with the hopes to see the Conn Men (Tommy came too)...to our disappointment, they were not performing, so we headed on over to the Art Museum.  It was pretty cool...kind of depressing, but there were monks do art in the sand...it was cool.  Then Tommy and I went to the library and later on that night we went to anchorman with some people from his floor and then back to his floor to watch the game and then miracle.

Sunday, dad came...enough said.  Homework, homework, homework, game, homework.  

Yesterday I did laundry...yay for me!  Did some homework, watched battle of the sexes...

THEN I went to the Co-Op and met Jenn and Allison at Webb Site (AHHHH!).  LOVEEE that place!  We spent 4 hours there talking...I loved it!  It was like one of the nights that we used to have back in 10th grade, where everyone we loved would be there are we just kept on talking and talking and talking and forgetting what time it was...when everythin just seemed ok, even if we knew it wasn't...it was for that moment.  Anyways, we lost track of time...got home and did more homework.

Today I took a nap!  It was great!  Procrastination is awesome!  Tonight, I am going over to tommy's to watch the game and do some homework.

love you!
laura"

"event","one class fridays are the best...

went to bed early last night (12:30) and I think that helped my get better a little--don't feel 100% yet though!

went to the library and got a lot done...I hate it when people talk on their phones in the 24 hour quiet room though--its a quiet room for a reason biotches...

then tommy and i went on our secret mission and such and got tickets to nyc and rent.  I can't wait...we are going to ny in november to see rent and then again the first week of december just to walk around and eat at our favorite places and everything.  i have always wanted to go to nyc during christmas time (esp. since i have seen serendipity), so i am very excited about that.  i want to eat (or at least have a hot chocolate) at seredipity--i ate there before it became famous and feel in love.  in fact, they have a gift store downstairs, and that is where i got my 1999 holiday bear beanie baby.

then lunch--potato skins...yum!

now i am here in my dorm--going to go do some more studying, then wash my dishes, then chill, then dinner, then lip sync for a little while...then bed :-D

love you!

"event","Long day!  Three classes on no sleep is not a good mix.  On Election Day, my last class is cancelled though--that made my day :-D Now I can go home earlier...yay!!!

Then, a short nap since I still have the sniffles a little, and then I had an AA meeting...and that's Academic Affairs, guys...not the other thing!  It was really interesting tonight-there was two men who were giving a report on the retention rate and graduation rate at UConn and how we can approve it and such.  I know, it sounds boring, but it really wasn't...not at all!  73% of the voluntary people who withdraw from the university are females from out of state.  I think one of the reasons for that is because since the rate of CT students to out of staters is 7:3, a lot of people already come here with their friends from high school, so it is really hard for those who are coming from out of state.  

Then Tommy and I treked to the Co-Op and I got ingredients to make ""the dip"" (jess/coll are you reading this?!  it was great!!!!)  YUM!  Then Tommy and I went on a secret mission which was marked as failed, but it will resume again tomorrow...muhahaha!

Then of course, being Thursday, it was Survivor/Will and Grace/Apprentice/ER and NLCS night!  Whoa!  Therefore...I got no work done, but that is ok because I think I really needed a break anyways...

Tomorrow I only have one class...remind me next semester to make sure to take a class in which the teacher does not take attendance on Friday mornings.  

k I have to sex up my Greek Civ book...:-/  that's not fun

love you!

thank you yankees fans for being so cool about it--seriously!

love you!

"event","I don't like the sniffles.  That's what I have right now.  My mom told me to take some medicine today, and I did.  I really hope I don't wake up tomorrow and feel sick--that has to be one of the worse feelings:  to wake up in the morning and swallow and realize that your throat hurts.

I was the girl walking around campus with the scarf today.  That was me!  It wasn't even that cold, but I had my scarf and gloves.  :-D

Game 7 tonight--c'mon red sox--you can't let us down tonight.  Please don't for I fear that I might see some grown men cry otherwise.  Actually-that will probably happen either way.  

Going to go take a nap and then work on some homework.  Or, the other way around.  Or the most likely situation will be that I do neither, but instead just sit online and talk to people and search the facebook, because I am addicted to it.  It's all good though.

Got an 'A' on my Greek Civ. Paper.  Totally shocked!  My TA is on some heavy duty painkiller/drugs, so...that could have been a mistake.

Tommy and the other boys are going to be in the Sports Illustrated Campus edition soon--they have a photo shoot on Friday--look for them...it is going to be on campuses around the country.

P.S.  I did the paint job on T Diddy--just remember that ;)

k I have a date with my bed right now.

love you,

"event","I had my final midterm today--American Political Processes.  It went well, especially due to the fact that we had an amazing study group the night before and got a lot done it in.  Suppose to go to breakfast with Tommy--woke up late--opps.  

Sox vs. Yanks tonight.  Sorry Yank fans.  Ortiz is indeed my daddy.  Gilmore Girls too--:)

Not too much homework.  Thank God.  Just some Greek Civ.  Hate that!

Tommy and I went to dinner with Laura and Ralph.  It sucked.  The food is getting worse and worse.  Makes Easy Mac look like a gormet meal.  (I had that today too :))

Better go to take a shower/watch the game/watch Gilmore Girls/clean the room/finish some homework.

love you!

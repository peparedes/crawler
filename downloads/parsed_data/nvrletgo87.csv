I don't wanna rush this thing
I don't really wanna jump the gun
I really wanna say those three little words
But I'm gonna bite my tongue

Yeah, I'm just gonna lay on back
Leave it on cruise control
I'm gonna hold it all inside
Till the right time comes down the road

Chorus:
I got a feelin'
My head's a reelin'
My heart is screamin'
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an ""I""
And ends with a ""U""
I got a feelin'
Are you feelin' it too

I guess I've all but said it now
So much for hopin' you'd go first
Don't leave me hangin' out here on a line
Baby, it's your turn
Say you could sleep last night
Swore that you could feel me breathe
Had you wantin' me right there by your side
Yeah, baby I know what you mean

Second Chorus:
I got a feelin'
My heads a reelin'
My heart is screemin'
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an ""I""
And ends with a ""U""
I get a feelin'
You're feelin' it too

Bottle up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an ""I""
And ends with a ""U""
I got a feelin'
You're feelin' it too
You're feelin' it too
Yeah, you're feelin' it too
Feelin' it too
Oh, Yeah

"event","<P>well im kinda bummed cuz my dad is such a punk he just dosent understand me at all, is so bazare becuz me and him use to be best friends and now its like we are ENEMIES, and i just dont understand it confuses me becuz i dont know i care about my friends and i help them out and worry about them and take care of them , and am always there for them , my dad has like no heart he dosent take care of anyone aside from family he dosent care about friends and i hate it cuz he dosent relate to me , then the worst part of this grounding bs ... is me not being able to talk to anyfriend espically sarah. which totally buggs cuz i love her&nbsp; to death and not talking to her is hell. he is just a total drag and im counting the dayz tell i move out and get away from him that will be a day in history&nbsp;which will nvr be forgotten , anywayz today is me and sarahs 5th week togather which is awesome ... we dont fight i honestly think this is a start of a beautiful thing&nbsp; she makes me happy she can put me in a good mood every time she is just perfect&nbsp; and i miss her when im not with her , and love her all the time its an amazing feeling to be in love... well thats it for now cuz im kinda pissy lol </P>

1 . Can I keep you?

Lives are for living I live for you
Dreams are for dreaming I dream for you
Hearts are for beating mine beats for you
Angels are for keeping. Can I keep you?

2. Believe In Me

Do you believe in love at first sight?
Do you believe dreams come true?
Do you believe in all this, I know I do!
I believe that dreams come true 
because I have always dreamed of someone like you .
I believe in love at first sight 
because it just felt so right when I saw you that night. 
Now I believe, so, baby, please never leave , 
just stay with me and maybe you will finally see 
that you also believe in me !!!


well thats it lol 

                                             laterz Pat

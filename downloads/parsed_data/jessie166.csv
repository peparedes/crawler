"event","Hope dangles on a string 
Like slow spinning redemption 
Winding in and winding out 
The shine of it has caught my eye 
And roped me in 
So mesmerizing, and so hypnotizing 
I am captivated, 
I am... 

Vindicated 
I am selfish 
I am wrong 
I am right 
I swear I'm right 
Swear I knew it all along 
And I am flawed 
But I am cleaning up so well 
I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself 

So clear 
Like the diamond in your ring 
Cut to mirror your intention 
Oversized and overwhelmed 
The shine of which has caught my eye 
And rendered me so isolated, so motivated 
I am certain now that I am... 

So, turn up the corners of your lips 
Part them and feel my finger tips 
Trace the moment, fall forever 
Defense is paper thin 
Just one touch and I'd be in 
Too deep now to ever swim against the current 
So let me slip away  
So let me slip against the current 
So let me slip away 

Like hope 
Dangles on a string 
Like slow spinning redemption..."

dont say goodnight,
and walk away without that kiss that you owe me
dont close your eyes,
and say you dont want me,
i wish that youd want me now.
you know that i promised id always have an ear for you to lend.
but now your syllables are phrases i dont understand
calling out in despiration
fighting off this suffocation
screaming out loud
wanting so bad to be heard
when the days end and youre cold from standing out alone
the only vioce of recognition is your own
crying out in despiration
Begging to be heard.
But only you can hear your words.

Cause I'm sitting here with your picture and smilin' to myself (I smile)
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through, and I blush as I say yes

What a feeling of vulnerability comin' over me 
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak (speak)
I can't think
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being 
With abilities to set me free (free), let me be me
Makes me wanna say


Your lips, your eyes, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, filling me
Like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality thats hookin' me
is that you're lovin' me 4 me
Is that you're lovin' me 4 me

Now people ask why I'm in love with you
Well, let me start by sayin' you got my heart by just bein' who you are
And what we got is between me and you
It doesn't matter 'bout the money I make or what I do, or that I'm a star

Unconditionally you're there for me 
Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, so sweet
This is meaningful, it's incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable
The way I feel, so sweet, makes me wanna say

Its so amazing how something so sweet has come and rearranged my life
I've been kissed by destiny, oh heaven came and saved me 
An angel was placed at my feet, this isn't ordinary
He's loving me 4 me

Poem:
Stripped of all make-up
No need for fancy clothes
No cover ups, push ups,
With him, I don't have to put on a show
He loves every freckle, every curve,
Every inch of my skin
Fullfilling me entirely 
Taking all of me in
He's real
He's honest 
He's loving me for me
Yeah"

"event","I can't do it......

I can't be with you again
Don't remind of the good times that we had
Learned a lot from us since then
And I never want these feelings to ever come again, no, no

You'll never hear me crying
You'll never see me trying
To love you once again
Your love is so past tense

Please don't tell me that you've changed
Don't want to hear of how you've lost your evil ways
The one whose changed this time is me
And I won't go back to feeling helpless and deceived



Your love, your love
You think you had me fooled every now and then
You had me believing that I was the reason that you left
But I won't fall back in love with you again
I don't even wanna be, your friend, no, no"

"event","Come up to meet you,
Tell you I'm sorry,
You don't know how lovely you are.

I had to find you,
Tell you I need you,
Tell you I set you apart.

Tell me your secrets,
And ask me your questions,
Oh, let's go back to the start.

Runnin' in circles,
Comin' up tails,
Heads are a science apart.

Nobody said it was easy,
It's such a shame for us to part.
Nobody said it was easy,
No one ever said it would be this hard.
Oh, take me back to the start.

I was just guessing,
At numbers and figures,
Pulling your puzzles apart.

Questions of science,
Science and progress,
Do not speak as loud as my heart.

Tell me you love me,
Come back and hold me,
Oh, when I rush to the start.

Runnin' in circles,
Chasin' tails,
Comin' back as we are.

Nobody said it was easy,
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part.
Nobody said it was easy,
No one ever said it would be so hard.
I'm goin' back to the start."

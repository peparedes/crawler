"event","I mentioned a couple days ago over on FB that after seeing Avatar I found it unlikely that the Na'vi were native to Pandora.  I still hold that this is a valid assertion, given the information we have from the movie, but that it could use some explanation.  I also recognize that, not having read the novelization, Cameron may have already reconciled some of the issues I raise here.

<lj-cut text=""Basic Premise: Na'vi did not evolve along with Pandora's other species"">
I think that it is something endemic to parenting, or perhaps simply unique to my own family's habits, that when presented with the overly simplistic stories told to children we attempt to add complexity and depth.  We find ourselves doing this even for adult stories that are simplistic, such as James Cameron's Avatar.  This is not to say that the movie was not <i>good</i>, I think that the ticket price was well spent, but that the story is one that is simple and well-known to most American moviegoers.  

Because of that simplicity I found myself looking for more from the world, once the credits had rolled.  The first thought I had, as I trekked across the icy parking lot was that the Na'vi, as shown, were probably not native to Pandora.  There are a number of anatomical clues that suggest this:

1) Two-Eyes:  The majority of Pandoran fauna shown have four or more eyes.  From the Great Leonopteryx to the Hammerhead Titanothere to the dimunitive viperwolf, most of the animals on Pandora possess more than two eyes.  Indeed, the only animals that seem not to share this trait are those closely associated with the Na'vi such as the Direhorse or the Mountain Banshee.

2) Four Limbs:  Even more telling than eyes is the number of limbs found on Pandoran animals.  Without exception, all save the Na'vi possess six limbs.  Some show signs of limb atrophy, such as the Protolemuris, with a single upper arm and a bifurcated forearm, but the Na'vi show no signs of even vestigal limbs.

3) Respiration:  The Na'vi breathe through their mouths and noses, just as humans do.  All other creatures we see on Pandora have spiracles on their chests for respiration.  While it is possible for such drastic changes to have evolved naturally (e.g. Whales and other cetaceans' blowholes), we see no direct evidence for such.  Indeed, the Na'vi seem well-adapted to their environment.

4) Synaptic Uplink:  While many of the animals on Pandora possess an extra, external nerve conduit, only the Na'vi are able to make use of this for cross-species control and communication.  One would assume, given the totality of control the Na'vi seem to have over creatures once linked, that other animals would have evolved similar capabilities either for defense or for hunting.  We do not see this, however, not even in a more rudimentary form.

Given these features, I think it likely that the evolutionary roots of the Na'vi are very different from the rest of Pandora's fauna.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Theory One: Na'vi as a failed colony."">
One possible cause for these differences could be found if Pandora was terraformed in the distant past.  If, at one time, the Na'vi were a spacefaring civilization much like the humans presented in the movie.  The Na'vi would either have adapted the surface of Pandora to meet their needs, or more likely considering the divergence from local fauna, would have adapted their bodies (and nervous systems) to the planet.  

In this case, some disaster long ago would have meant the destruction of the Na'vi technological base and a return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Theory Two: Eywa as conqueror"">
A slightly more extreme theory holds that Eywa, not the Na'vi, is the dominant life form on the planet Pandora.  Given the information presented in Avatar, I believe that this is quite likely.  Whether the Eywa are native to Pandora, or arrived at some time in the past we can't yet tell, but it is obvious that they are both sentient and in control of the Pandoran biosphere.

First we have the evidence that a vast network, even more complex than a human brain, exists within the Pandoran soil.  This network connects all life within the rainforests, from simple plants up to the great megafauna such as Thanators and Hammerhead Titanotheres.

Second, sentience can be seen in the way that Eywa responded to Jake Sully's plea for help.  Though the response was not immediate, it showed a controlling hand.  The way in which the Banshees and Titanotheres not only gathered to assist the Na'vi resistance, but seemed to know what specific targets to focus on, shows intelligent action rather than random attack.

As an aside, I do not think that the Eywa have a direct, constant, sense of the world the way humans, or the Na'vi, do.  The gap in time between Jake's request and the animals' response suggests that the Eywa needed to wait for information about the human threat to be gathered.  At a guess, the first Na'vi and other animals who died were linked into the Eywa's network and ""downloaded"" to provide this information.  Additional time was needed to gather the appropriate resources and to organize them.

As we have seen on Earth, intelligence and the ability to marshall resources are a stunning evolutionary advantage.  Humans have displaced most other large animals, filling a huge variety of ecological niches by outcompeting the previous residents.  I believe that the same would as true for sentient flora as it does for sentient fauna.  Any ecosystem inhabited by an Eywa would quickly become suborned into that Eywa's own network, or would be displaced by the flora and fauna under an Eywa's control.  Once one locale was filled with the Eywa, it would look for methods to expand itself into neighboring ecosystems, either by converting them or by adapting its own resources to survive in new environments.

In this scenario, the Na'vi are simply another tool of the Eywa.  Providing eyes, ears, hands, and most importantly context.  As semi-autonomous, the Na'vi are able to operate outside of the Eywa's direct influence, but can be trusted to return to a network node (Tree of Souls) to return the collected data.  The neolithic technology of the Na'vi has been preserved because, at this point in time, that was all the Eywa needed the Na'vi to possess.  With the advent of invasive species (e.g. humans), or with Pandora's biosphere filled entirely by one Eywa, the Na'vi may quickly develop technology necessary to bring the Eywa to other worlds.  Indeed, given some of the information on James Cameron's own writeup of the movie's history, I think it is safe to say that there are many nascent Eywa already growing on Earth.  Some as part of scientific collections, others arriving as simple, incidental, stowaways on human returnees.

<lj-cut text=""Pasta Carbonara"">
<b>Ingredients</b>
Long Pasta (ie. Spaghetti, angel hair, or linguini)
6 Tbsp Parmesean and/or Romano, grated
1/3 to 1/2 cup heavy cream
2 Tbsp Butter
2 Tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1/4 lb Bacon (or Pancetta, if you're a purist)
1/3 cup dry white wine
Salt and Pepper to taste
Garlic (To taste)
Parsley (fresh is better, but dried is fine)

<b>Directions</b>
Melt 2Tbsp butter in 2 Tbsp Olive Oil in a small pan.
When the butter is melted add thin strips of bacon to the mix and brown.
While bacon is browning, start the water for the pasta.
When bacon is just starting to get crispy add 1/3 cup dry white wine, let boil to reduce
The water should be about ready now, add the pasta.
When the bacon/oil/butter/wine mix has reduced to the point that there's about half as much liquid in the pan as you started with, remove it from the heat.
In a separate bowl, combine cheese, cream and spices.  The sauce should have the consistency of a thin alfredo sauce (the white sauce).  Don't worry if it seems a bit thin, the cheese will melt when the pasta and carbonara are added and thicken things up again.
When the pasta is done, drain.
In a large mixing bowl combine pasta, carbonara (bacon/oil/butter), and the white sauce and stir.
Congratulations you have pasta carbonara.

This is great with some salad and fresh garlic bread.  If you want a more substantial meal you can grill up chicken breasts ahead of time and add them.

"event","I think his own words say it best:

""When I first came to your planet and demanded your homes, property and very lives, I didn't know you were already doing so, willingly, with your own government. I can win no tribute from a bankrupted nation populated by feeble flag-waving plebians. In 2008 I shall restore your dignity and make you servants worthy of my rule. This new government shall become a tool of my oppression. Instead of hidden agendas and waffling policies, I offer you direct candor and brutal certainty. I only ask for your tribute, your lives, and your vote. 
-- General Zod
Your Future President and Eternal Ruler""

There may have been more, but I was too busy going ""ohcrapohcrapI'mintraffic"" to pay further attention.  When the car was looked at, the mechanic's diagnosis was, and I quote ""Um, yeah, you're going to need a new engine.""  Apparently the car dropped it's resevoir of oil somewhere on the trip in to work, and it just took a bit for the engine to seize up.<br /><br />I had been planning on replacing my care anyway.  As much fun as a 17-year-old sports car is, it does make things a bit difficult when I needed to transport my son around.  For some reason he wasn't a fan of being dropped in via the sunroof, then spun around to his seat in the back of the car.  I can't imagine why. :D<br /><br />We went out this weekend to find a replacement and had it down to a 2005 Mazda3 and a Subaru Impreza.  While the Mazda was fun, sporty, and a manual, the Impreza won out simply because it has some ability to drive when not on pavement, was a bit ""lighter"" (the Mazda was black inside and out), and had a roof rack that will come in most handy driving up to WW this summer.<br /><br />Though I'll miss the old car, it's nice to have one that was made in the current century finally.</lj-cut><br clear=""all"" />"

I had a look around the company's <a href=""http://www.multiverse.net"">site</a> and the graphics look a little basic and generic for their existing sites, but hopefully they'll get a decent design team and give us a chance to play around in the 'Verse."

"event","In the mood for something more entertaining (and by that I mean <i>actually</i> entertaining) than network TV tonight, I was looking through our movies and realized that we have damn few comedies, and of those we do have, most involve, at least in some way, the undead.  Shaun of the Dead, Army of Darkness, Creature ""My auntie is a zombie from hell"" Comforts, heck even Yzma is close enough to count in Emperor's New Groove.  And of the other comedies we have, in most the actors are, themselves, dead.

So, apparently the tortured souls of the dead are a good source of comedy."

Recently several Japanese scientists were doing some deep-sea exploration, though they swear up and down that Gojira was not part of their search.  While they didn't exactly find a giant lizard, they did manage to get the first photographs, not to mention the first view of a living specimen, of a <a href=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/09/0927_050927_giant_squid.html>giant squid</a>.  The pics are pretty cool, and a bit creepy when you think that this thing's about 26' long.

"event","So apparently recreating old NES and arcade games is all the rage in the flash gaming community lately.  At this point, I think every year between <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong>1972</a> and 1990, with the possible exception of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._(video_game)>1983</a> has been converted.

Now, though somone's gone a step farther and combined two old classics: Duck Hunt for the NES, and Doom.  Now you too can bring the fight to that duck with a shotgun, missile launcher, or BFG9000 with <a href=http://www.realtechnews.com/posts/1746>Duck Doom</a>."

"event","So we went out and saw Batman Begins last night.  It's a truly excellent film, and I'll have to stop saying thigs like ""Yeah, they should have made more Batman films after the Burton/Keaton ones"" now.  The villain was well played, Batman was well played, Nolan and Bale were both aware that Bruce Wayne is the costume, the action was tight and brutal, it was very good.

I think my favorite fight scene in the film is one that'll be the most overlooked.  There's a scene at a train station, Rachael is facing the camera, looking at a thug approaching her from off-screen.  In the background you see Batman swoop in on the thug who's walking up behind her and beat him down.  No fancy wire-fu moves, no silly gadgets, just a blur of black, the only things you see really clearly are his arms pistoning up and down.

I also think that Qui-Gon Al-ghul was very well played.  Sneaky, devious, and ruthless.  I was very happy that they didn't make him a caracture of Fu Manchu, like I feared.  I'll spare you the details of the ending, but I will say that we didn't see the body."

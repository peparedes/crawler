"event","You now sometimes hoe people deserve things. Like Alaina she was the only 1 there today that I thought really deserved that Riccarton Way badge.

She comes from shit, literally her house is messy and she has a hard life but she always pulls through. She's kind honest and nice and everything the ""Riccarton Way"" is suppossed 2 b.

Then you get people like Sai, people who deserve it but never get it. Someone who nothing good ever seems to happen to. If I were there I would give her a Riccarton Way badge. So many people deserve them but never get them. 

I'm kinda pissed off to with the prizegiving, Nick and Brendon both got service to Jazz band awards and they haven't been there half as often as me grr. Got shitty at tom 2day 2. He kept pulling the Deans card away frm me and it hurt. Dunno why just foul mood and Ms. Varcoe topped it all off by saying well mabye that's why you didnt get a prize. Teachers shouldnt be able to say that. I'm just shitty because I never seem to be trying hard enough at anything. I g2g im jst getting pissed off."

"event","School again today my stupid maths teacher Mrs Gamblin accused me of cheating on the test the stupid bitch. I don't cheat! Michelle and Alana gave me a 'look' today when me and Emma were doing the random foot clicky thing from the boat. Honestly where do they get off.

Me and Kristee had a sawdust fight 2day in tech and its all through my hair lol and we stuck kick me signs on Mr Reggie-aldo's back. Lachlan brought a bonde wig to school today to and was imitating Mike Jaimason and Mrs Kokay which was sort of mean.

My life is very boring..."

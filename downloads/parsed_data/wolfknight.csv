I couldn't stay made at it forever so i got over it. also i was suppose to go up to SAC to give my part of the money so i could go to Ushi con (still not sure if i spelled it right) but i cant at the moment... hopefuly by the time i get up there Marzgurl will still be there. knowing my luck... she wont be. It really sucked that i wasn't able to go to Renfest this year. I really wanted to go but instead my parents bought me a new comp. well i guess i can't really complain about that. I have already beatin Halo2 twice already. once by myself and the other co-op with my friend Tony. i am workin on the third time. I miss Rocky and everyone i met at Rocky. I'll be glad to work for them when i get back or just watch it again. oh yea i can't remember if i said it before but the people that i met up here are awsome. and of course as always i learn somethin new all the time. i have more to say but i'll leave it for later.

"event","Last night at Rocky i thought it went ok... ok is ok. it should have been better then ok. they put me as head crew or crew manager or what ever they call it and i believed i fucked up royaly... they gave me 3 or 4 new people on crew since i guess we were short. not sure. one of them has seen the movie once, another seen three times the others more then that. i can under stand the one who has only seen it once to hardly know anythin but one of the others that has claimed to have seen it at the theatre so many times should have a better idea of things.. what am i complainnin about is that i should have gave them an exaple, as in showin them, as well as verbal explanation. i couldn't think straight becuase i was told that i was the head person of crew that night. maybe if i wasn't told then i might have bone better then what i did and also in addition to that my leg was hurtin from earlier that day at the beach which was fun hangin out with everyone that went. i was a little off that day, all day and into the night, becuase i haven't gone to sleep that night. i haven't really done that much durin the shows when i first joined. i have done the bedroom part 2 times and the close once and the transducer and Rocky weights i think twice as well. i was usually sweepin the isle after the rice was thrown. i had 2 people ready to grab the cloths off the ground for when the light go out for the scene change but they didn't and the 2 people didn't now what to do so i limped back behind the drape thing and grabbed the ones i could. when the lights went over to frank i motioned to some one and whitney happen to see me and i just wanted to know i was clear to get the rest of the cloths from the middle of the area but she got them and put them to the side. the transducer i thought was put out early cuz someone else told her to put it out there before the part i told her. dunno if that was alright or not but it got out there. someone yelled at O'Shea about the cloths part when he was on the other side away from them and he was suppose to do somethin else. That kinda made me a little mad. of course the bedroom scene went bad or worse then bad not sure. i asked them before hand if they got the idea when i explained it and they said yea and i guess i didn't explain good enough. after all that went on i was feelin down and feelin like i failed which i still beleive until proven wrong.  well after the show i started to drive home and durin the drive i started to fall asleep everynow and then. i got home alright and went to bed. got up around 3:15pm and my leg was only sore instead of hurtin and my back and my neckwere sore as well. nuttin really happened today. actually nuttin happened today just sat home still ponderin. i am off to eat cuz i haven't had anythin to eat today. and i have been sittin here with chicken in front of me untouched. i am finishin this first before i eat it cuz i don't want grease on the keyboard. i don't know anyone who likes a greasy keyboard. later

"event","Ok... i got really pissed off today. well not really but i just got mad. i was over at my friends playin a game, super smash bros. melee to be exacte, on my gamecube when the controller started to mess up and then didn't work any more on either port one or two. three and four were ok but you needed one to do things. I thought it was the controllers at first but it wasn't. I notice a strange liquid on the inside of the ports... it was piss. my dog pissed on my system. i mean it was bad enough when he pissed on the bags around the house if they are on the ground but that is not right. after i brought it home i cleaned port one with a cotton swab and poroxide.. i got it to work.. then i tried port two after cleanin it.. it didn't work still. i tried for a long time. i just gave up... if i can't get it to work then i am gonna have to get another one.. other then that the day was goin good and all. i was gonna go to crystal beach tonight with a couple of friends but one bailed and the other we couldn't get a hold of... so it was just gonna be two and we were gonna go still just the two of us and maybe see if there were people we could hang out with but we didn't go cuz we found somethin else to do. well he found somethin else and forgot to tell me and he has no cell phone so i was at home bored so i said fuck it and i poped in a DVD and watch some x-rated stuff and laughin at it cuz some of them try to have like a little part were they have dialog and it is funny watchin them try to act before the sex... sorry i have no life. well i am goin back to the x-rated comedy. later

"event","Today was ok just went to Jack Brooks ran around and went and played a little D&D. it kinda sucks that one of our players is gettin uninterrested in the game but i can see why. It don't bother me but it is just that his gf (the DM's) comes in and kisses him for like 5 or so mins or starts to try to help us or calls us stupid for doin what we are doin or calls him into the other room. When she tries to help or somethin the reason for that is becuase she knows all about what he has in store for us. but he has talked to her about it and she has slowly stopped doin that. I haven't seen any of that tonight. eh oh well. what sucks is that they are( i mean the other two players) gettin tired of just us three guys and they would like to have a girl play too. I guess i feel the same way but it is hard to find a girl that likes to play and is willin to play... well i need some rest for i have a test i need to pass sometime today. oh yea and if there is anything anyone that even reads this wants to know about me just ask... i am about to put ramdom things anyway so i dunno. later.

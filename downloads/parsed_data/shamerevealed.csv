I'm running on the future.
Not today.

Only thing that keeps me going is thinking about graduating.
Even applying to Hawaii and Rowan.
That just keeps me going.

I know it's not friends I'm running on,
cause there are none except Casey.

I know it sure as hell isn't a guy,
because they're useless to me.

Pretty much, I'm happy to work alot,
have money, getting a car and a license SeptSix.

That's just what I need.
Work.
License.
Applications.
Going somewhere. I really don't give a fuck where.
Away from people that don't care if I'm around, away from people that never ask me to hang out, away from people that don't care if I'm okay or not, which I'm really not.
Away from reminders, away from feeling like nothing.

I had more fun at Rowan last night with strangers + Aj&Rachel&Matt&Andrew than with all the people in Red Bank all of the time.
Honestly, ya'll really bother me,
and ya'll only give a fucking shit about yourselves and your stupid ass little click.

Stop talking to me if you need to,
DON'T WASTE MY GODDAMN TIME.
It's disgusting how you treat people that have done nothing but be there for you.
And then you wonder why two of your best friends left
and don't come back.

I'm going to go look at the U. of Hawaii webpage some more.
And dream of a life without shitty people."

I hang out with Erik everyday. It's almost like we're going out again how much we hang out. Which I mean I know how much I care about him, but I really can't handle someone that's going to lie to me all of the time. But I'm happy for him with how his life is going. He moved into his apartment, he works back at Honda, he just bought a new truck. It's good for him. I really do hope he's happy.

I miss the people I used to be so so close with. Like Dj. And Lewis. And John.

I hate college for taking my boys. I hate distance. I hate how John lived in Tinton Falls and Lewis in Belmar. I never got to see them. Now John is in PA. And Lewis is getting ready, figuring out where to go.





I don't understand why I latch onto people so hard. I care about them so much. I care about my ex-es so much. I've noticed that most recently. Nick, Billy, Mike, Mark, Mike, Erik. Billy makes me most upset though. Everytime I see you, I hurt so badly. I just wish I never did that to him. I wish I saw what I had. I wish that I could have another shot and be able to just be his friend. I miss that kid. I wish he'd hang out with me and see I'm a different person now.

I've changed so much since freshman year. I've changed so much in general. Not the bad thing everyone makes it out to be, because I believe my change was for the better. Shook a bunch of people I didn't need. And I'm fine.

Everything is fine."

"event","For someone who's specifically told people that I'm their best friend, there's a line ""best friends"" don't cross.

You've crossed that line by a fucking mile and you know it. You know what you did is wrong, and you know it cause you didn't even try talking to me. You see how pissed I am. So what the fuck is wrong with you ?


You don't start talking to the kid your ""best friend"" likes and ask him WHEN IS OUR DATE !?!?!?@?!?@!> and then tell me to let you hook up with him, then ask him to hang out. I think it's funny that you weren't even going to tell me, either.

So you know what ?
Fuck you.

Never in everything you've done have I wanted to say that to you until now. You must be looking for drama or something. Must be.




For any of you who doesn't know, this is what is going on.
I like this kid. We hung out last week and held hands and I love hanging out with him and it's awesome and his best friend said he's like really shy. I don't know. Well Saturday, I felt like was sort of ignoring me a bit, and I went on his myspace, and found a comment from my ""best friend"" and it was like ""Sorry we didn't hang out, but date soon okay ?!?!?!?!?!"" Something like that. And I was like hm, that's weird. I knew they talked but still. So I looked at her myspace and he said ""Soon ? How about now ?"" Something. And so I was like wtfff. So I asked him about it last night, and he told me nothing was going on and I was just paranoid. So I shook it off.

Today I go to school and I'm talking to people and she goes ""Yo, let me hook up with <u>       </u>(his name)."" So I said no and she says ""Comeon, I need a booty call.""

Whatever. I decided to just barely talk to her.

I texted him and asked him if he wanted to go to the hockey game tonight.
Him - ""I told HER I'd hang out with her after the game in RB so if you're there, I'll see you.""
-""Oh yeah, about her, this morning, she goes ""Let me hook up with <u>       </u>."" I'm so sure nothing is going on. Have fun, okay ?""
-""...""
-""I really don't know what to say right now. I really don't.""
-""You're so good at making situations really awkward.""
-""Maybe if you told me the truth, or if you told me you weren't really interested in me, things wouldn't have to be so awkward.""
-""I really don't know what you're talking about.""
-""What do you want me to say ? I told you I liked you, and I don't compare to her. So do what ya gotta do.""
-""Why are you being like this? I don't even know why you're upset.""
-""I don't think my best friend should be trying to hook up with the kid I like.""

Then at Amanda's, I texted him again.
-""Can I call you later ?""
-""I told you I might be in RB, but if not, that's okay.""
-""Okay, uh, have fun with that.""
-""Oh, alright.""
-""=(""

He called me a little while ago when he had a few minutes, but I was busy. I really can't stand this, cause I was going to go to both RedBank and the hockey game originally, but my project took too long, and I wasn't allowed to go to Red Bank. So they are probably hanging out right now.



Sweet."

I'm okay. I really am. 
Casey, I miss you, and I'm glad we talked today. It's been a week or two. I think you started off my good night. Followed by Gabs and Annie (Annie, I hope you're feeling better than you did.) and Maura and Kevin and Alex and MIKEEEE. Mike definately made me smile alot. Hah.

I'm talking to Ashton again. He's an old, old friend, and the brother of one out of two of the kids I miss more than life. One is Mattie, and one is Evan. And Evan is his brother. And I want to talk to him more than anything. But Ashton says him and his brother and sister are all doing really well, and it's all that I can ask for. They deserve the best out of anyone. Really.

Well, he was talking all day today and last night about how things aren't good, but I'm trying to help him out. I'm not an asshole, I just want him to be happy, I'll do what I've got to in order for him to smile. Even if that means he'll stay with her. Isn't that crazy ?

I went to Red Bank tonight with Maddie and Pho showed up, and we were with Eleni for a while, then Tom Sasso, then BSal&amp;Salty&amp;a really sweet girl, then when we went to Zebu I saw Kevin and Zak and Stefan and NickyG. Then Brittany and Kim were in Zebu. I don't know. Tonight was sort of beat because Gabs and Brain and Annie and everyone in existance was at Six Flags. And Nick and Colin were at the movies. Boo. And Ally is in New York. Ugh.

Well you know what ? Today was a weird day, but my feelings haven't changed. And now that you said some of the things that were said, I really don't know how to take it, so I'm going to just act like it was never said until you make a decision. And take your time. Because I will wait forever, as long as I have you as my best friend, I'm satisfied. Of course yeah it'd be awesome if things were different, but I'm certainly not complaining about how amazing it is now. I enjoy being here for you, whether you see it or not. I enjoy listening to you, even if it is always about girls. I don't mind. Geez, I feel like I sound like I'm obsessed. That's not it. It's just... I care about you so much, and I just want you to see it. I don't want you to think I only do things for some other bullshit reason. I do the things I do because you're my best friend, because if I had to die for one person, you'd be it. And it's weird. It's a little scary. But whatever. Life is scary. 

Don't ever hurt me. Don't ever leave me. Don't ever second guess me. And don't ever say you have noone. Because you always have me.

I saw Billy. And was hyper, and was like LOOK AT THIS KID, HE'S NUMBER ONE, GODDAMN HE'S FINE ! and he laughed and it was cute. Well last period I texted him and said ""Cheating on you was the worst mistake I have ever made."" and in Viewpoint I got a text saying ""It was the best thing that has happened to me"" and I was like ""what ?"" and he said Ryan said it. Then I invited him to the diner, but he never answered, so whatever. I miss him, and seeing him is tough. Not miss him though like to be weird. I just miss him. Miss hanging out with him everyday. Miss him waiting for me outside my class. Miss seeing him smile because of me.

"event","Things are alot different from when I last wrote in this. A brief summary:

I broke up with Erik a few weeks ago, but we are the best that we've been in a long time. I'm meeting a ton of new people. I'm really not doing so bad in school, I just have to study more for French and I need to get my functional design projects in on time. My field hockey team is 10-0-3, and if we beat Howell on Monday, we win number one in our division. Either way, we're going to a tournament for like a week down in Tom's River, we just need to keep winning so we get the higher seatings. Things with Dj are awesome, we're still really cool since he went off to school, but he hasn't talked to me since Tuesday and I'm actually really upset about that.

My computer broke a while ago so I have my dad's laptop which is shitty but it equals cause I get to be on the computer as late as I want in my room.

So anyways..

I'm fed up with people. I'm fed up with people lying. And not lies to make them look better, whatever, you're gay if you do that, but lies for no reason. Why would you write in your livejoural about how you don't care what I think, then tell my friend you don't like me, then tell another friend that we both hang out with that you want to be my friend ? You're ridiculous, you start too much drama, I don't want to have anything to do with you.

Aj and I haven't talked in weeks. I put a stop to it because something happened that I should've known about and I found out from other people. She keeps trying to&nbsp; talk to me but I'm really not having it. She told my mom a complete lie, and is trying to make it out like anyone who knew just assumed it, but that's not what happened. Whatever, there's no reason for it. And she said she didn't tell me because she felt like we weren't as close, but I texted her every single day since she left, texted or IMed at least once a day, and the day before she came home and I found out, we were sending each other all these pictures. So that's complete bullshit.

Last night was fun, I went to Red Bank and met up with Gabs and Annie and Brain and Nick ad people and we went to CluckU, then visited Katie at work, then I was hanging out with Ally, Nick, Colin, and Marissa was there. Then we went to Dominos and Annie came there saying that Stefan and Nick were picking her up and taking her to Sashas. So I decided to go with, and when we got there Gabs, Brain, Nick, Kelly, Taylor, Sasha, Amanda, and some other people were there. Krusty showed up but left because he's a faggit. Then Amanda drove me home because she's a good friend. =)

Tonight I believe I'm going to Annie's. At least I hope I am. And during the day I think I'm going to be hanging out with Cathy. Which makes my day awesome.

I just figured I'd write a little something since I haven't since July. I have to clean my room though. &lt;3"

I wake up about 1ish, I lounge around, eat, lounge, maybe go for a walk while listening to my MP3 player, fully equipped with camera IN CASE some photo opportunities show, with my cell phone in hand. Then I go home, eat some more, chill with the family or on the computer until my boyfriend comes home from work, then do something with him until midnight or later. Then sit on the computer until 3AM before going to bed.<br /><br />I don't have a baby, I'm not being starved, I have all that stuff to walk around with, I have a computer and LIVEJOURNAL to be writing this shit in, I shower everyday, I have a family with brothers and a dad that don't abuse me, I rarely even get yelled at. Like, the extent of my worries on a daily basis, like today, is how I'm going to get to a show tomorrow. Seriously. I'm blessed. I can't even see how good I have it. And I don't know, I'll assume that anyone who's actually reading this is the same way. Cause you've got a computer that you can be reading people's livejournals, right ?<br /><br />And all people want to do is complain. Every word out of my best friends mouth is a complaint about herself somehow even when she's gorgeous and flawless. I can't stand that, seriously, that makes me want to scream bloody murder. She said she dyed her hair last night and she almost threw up because she doesn't think she likes it. I had to say ""You're lucky that's the extent of your worries."" And I was repromanded for saying that, but it's true. <br /><br />My dad told me yesterday the story about when my oldest brother got put it his arms and the nurse said ""He's <em>perfect.</em> He has ten fingers and ten toes."" And my dad didn't think anything of it, but he will never forget it until he's dead because it's true. Noone in my family has a deformities, a terrible disease, I live in a house with heat and air conditioning, I live in a wonderful town with tons of food in my pantry that I just can't eat fast enough, I have a pool in my backyard, I have gorgeous decks, I have a wonderful Ibanez guitar, I can sit my ass in front of my computer and barely move all day. I don't have a job, I don't have any obligations.<br /><br />And this entry isn't meant to sound like I think I'm perfect. I know I'm not, but that's not so bad, you know ? Through bad, through trials in your life, you have to take a step back and just say ""Hey, look who I have in my life. Look what I don't have to worry about in my life. That can't be so bad."" <br /><br />I may have some complaints about my body, but do I keep it from being a good friend ? Do I let it keep me from doing what I want, wearing what I want, going where I want, hanging out with who I want ? No. And in God's eyes, I'm perfect. That's all I have to impress.<br /><br />I'm not telling you to live your life and you never have a right to be upset, but when things go wrong, when things go haywire, when things don't go <strong>your way</strong>, take a step back. Look at the house you're living, look at the people you live with, look at your clothes, your food, your beautiful fingers and toes and your computers and cell phones and cameras and cars and jobs and showers and notice that it's not that bad. Plus, you have a Heaven's worth of angels cheering you on. Now is that so bad ?"

I adore Erik Hugh Stewart Odegard. For the past month, he's been all that I've thought about, and it's not going to change. Tomorrow and Friday are finals, Friday night I'm going out to eat with Cathy, Saturday is my party, Sunday is INFEST show in Asbury, Monday is my birthday+finals+maybe doing something Johnanoodle? so long as he doesn't have work, and Tuesday is MADDDDD shots. Hah, I'm excited. I just want to be with my friends for my birthday.

Prom was absoloutly amazing. I had so much fun with Aj and Dj and just people. Post prom was the worst thing that happened to me because I can't deal with an entire good night, so it was really really good, then really bad. I was just crabby and didn't want to be there and was tired.

Thank god that school is almost over. It's about time."

"event","Worst fucking mood in a while.

Hm. Bad day in school. Pulling out of North, me and dad see Billy in the car going home. Then went to Best Buy with daddy and got tapes so I can record Monday's show. Then, on the way home, I saw Mike and Bryan driving to work. Then Julian called me. Out of the blue. He's never called me before, and I was happy. Then I texted Chris and asked him if maybe he'd want to hangout and he was all for it until he asked me if my parents were home. Apparently he has a beef with parents ? And then he decided to ditch me because my parents were home and he doesn't like parents. So then since I was bummed, I think annoying Julian a little too much. Then I sent Nicky G a picture of Molly, our hamster, and he bugged out, telling me how much I annoy him, so I said ""So stop talking to me if I annoy you so much."" His response. ""Sounds good. Your the one that talks to me. I just respond."" Thenn I was cleaning out my room because I was bummed, and I clean when I'm bummed usually, and I found all the notes that Billy wrote me when we were going out, and of course I read them. I read every single one, including the one that said something like ""I would never ever want to leave you, you mean so much to me, I can't live without you and we will be together forever as long as you never cheat. That's the worst thing a person could do. But I know you won't, I'm just letting you know, I love you so much."" And what did I do ?

And then people have to tell the world how I'm in a bad mood, and she just happens to tell the person I'm trying to avoid and shake off. Now I'm dealing with texts from this person I'm trying to shake off.

And Mark's been chilling with this slutty girl. A third girl. And I've given up on him.
And Mike, I don't even think about him anymore.
And Bryan sent me the new UnderOATH CD, and it's not as SUPER AMAZING as I expected it to be, not as good as They're Only Chasing Safety, but it's not bad. Just different.

THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR WANTING MORE, FOR WANTING MORE.

This entry is not nearly as thoughtful and dealing with feelings as much as the others were, but I blame it on the mood. I feel trash, lower than trash, and I have noone to pick me up. At all. That's me.

And I'm being a dick to everyone in sight because I'm selfish, shallow, and ridiculous.
Gr. At everything. I can't even cry at all, I'm just stone-faced and bummed.

I take it back. Today is exboyfriend day, because I got into a fight with almost all of them. What a whiney bitch."

Mike is out, I really don't care about his reasoning anymore. I'm done crying, I'm done being upset over him. I said it a few times, but I'll say it again.
We're through, I'm done being upset over someone that doesn't give a fukk.

So with that said, I'm also done chasing after boys.
Get your act together, and if you see how amazing I really am, then you would come after me.

And with THAT said, drinking is one of the most unattractive things a person can do.
I can prove it. I mean, look at this.

That isn't too pretty. So this is where I'll say time for XXX.
No drugs, no alcohol, no sex.
It's my decision, because I'm tired of this bs.
I never want to drink again after Friday night.
It was the worst feeling in the world, and I embarrassed the hell out of myself at Finn's house.
So nah, G, I'm good.

"event","Hah, next time I won't try to make you happy.

Next time, I won't worry about you.
Next time, I won't be concerned with how good I am for you.
Next time, I won't be try my damn hardest to  be the best I can for you in order for you to not get hurt.

The only complaint you've ever had towards me or the way that I treated you was that you didn't want to get hurt. You couldn't handle being upset, you couldn't handle being played, you couldn't handle anything.

So I try as hard as I fucking can, for what ? For you to get ""weirded out"", stop talking to me, not even have dignity, respect, or honor enough to tell me to my face how you feel. I did nothing but pour my heart out for you, I kept nothing back, I didn't put up guards, when you tell me you like me, when you tell me that you're all in as long as you're safe, I assume you're all in. I made myself vulnerable yet again to be taken advantage by a guy that is too afraid to tell me how he really feels, to keep me updated, to even call me ! How dare I confront you with something that comes up that might endanger our relationship. I don't want to have to second guess you, I don't want to have to be scared that rumors might be true. 

So next time, I won't say yes. There won't be a next time. I like guys with balls, not guys that pussy out.

I hate it when every single thing that a guy has to say is a lie to cover up for more lies. Cross country my fucking ass, you tried calling my ass, you are just too much of a coward to fess up to the fact that you can't handle a girl like you thought you could. Not that you couldn't handle me, you can't handle any girls.




""Don't hate him, just give him space."" I think a month not talking at all is a good amount to give him the benefit of the doubt. Hah, I'd rather hear the ""I need space"" speech than just be dropped like nothing.  What a joke."

Only I would write a LJ entry before school.

Well I'm a sucker for anything good, I cover my eyes when bad comes around. I'm a side girl, I'm second pick when it comes down to it, he's told me straight up that God forbid this girl turns around and wants to be with him, he's going to tell her yes. That's why he refuses to let things with me and him be out of control, I guess. So knowing where I'm at, knowing how he feels, knowing that SHE has his heart and I have his mind, I still ask him to hang out. I still waste my not-Verizon texts on him. I let my parents joke with me about him. We still plan to have a sleepover and just spend the night together. And for what ? So I can like him some more, and so that I might get false hope some more. When I'm with him, I forget about her. I forget that he's not fully with me. He said I'm the only thing that makes me forget about him. I like that. I want to be his out. But you know what ? She doesn't even talk to him. She doesn't give him the time of day, she treats him like shit, she has no respect for him, they aren't even friends anymore. Yet, he tells me how much he's liked her since the day that he met her. I don't understand how he can still like someone that treats him badly...... I know, but I'm different, because he still hangs out with me. He still tells me how much he loves hanging out with me, how he wants her to be like me, he still gives me hope. She doesn't give him anything, and he's obsessed with her. Well, he's picking me up from school on Wednesday and we're hanging out until piano lesson. All I can say is that I wish she was out of his life, I wish he'd open his eyes, and see that I'm not about to treat him badly, I'm not about to ruin his hope or his senior year.

I hope everybody's spring break went well. I was in like a constant bad mood the entire time, and I didn't do anything I said I was going to. I didn't drink, I didn't go to a party, I didn't have a sleepover with Casey, Cathy, Aj, and Sam, I didn't even hang out with Casey or Cathy. I didn't work my ass off to get in shape. I did get a phone. I did pierce my snakebites. I did hang out with Mark twice and Jon a few times. I did call Mike and I did make an ass out of myself. I did cry. I did realize my faults. I did see what I lost and regret my past. I did look to the future and scare myself completely.

I hate how whenever I hear UnderOATH, I think about Nicky G and when we went out. There's just some things in life you shouldn't pass up. He's one of them. <3

"event","I love the feeling of being told how I'm a great friend, and all I do is make somebody happy and I love hearing that my words comfort people, I love hearing that someone wouldn't know what to do without me.

But I don't love hearing that I'm everything a guy wants in a <b>different</b> girl. It makes me feel so shitty when a guy is complaining to me about a girl, and everything he's telling me, I'm the exact opposite. I don't get trashed everyday, I haven't drank since New Years, I haven't smoked since October, I don't leave people in the dark, I talk. I talk, I talk, I listen, I don't let things get akward, I text people, I keep in touch, I care. <b>I CARE.</b> And that's everything he wants. But he doesn't want me. I don't know if that means that there's another feature about me he doesn't like, or if he just doesn't want the physical Susan. Whichever, it's a slap in the face. I try and be all that I can for everybody. I text people saying ""I hope that you're having a good day"", because I really do. Hearing someone isn't having a good day is my que to jump in and ask ""What's wrong?"". That's how I work.

I don't know what kind of person I am, really. I want to know how people view me. Am I the girl that's pushy and tries to get into everyone's business by always asking what's wrong ? Am I the girl that is too into hearing about emotions that people are scared that I can't kick back and have a good time, all seriousness aside ? Because I most certainly can, I love laughing for a whole night with friends. But I never have that anymore. That's gone to me. It's all which boys we're upset about, who's backstabbing who.

I am not a slut. I've made some poor decisions, yes, but I am not a slut, so when every single one of you girls wants to think that, be my guest. It bugs the hell out of me when I've lost a whole group of friends because apparently I'm a slut. I got in a fight with one girl because she liked the guy I was hooking up with, and I lose a group of friends because I'M the slut. Totally disregard your best friend, right ? And half naked pictures on myspace. At least I have more respect for myself.

Respect, it's a funny thing, isn't it ? I respect everybody. Absoloutly every single person, I don't know what has happened to you or what kind of things you go through, and I understand that and respect you because of my ignorance. But I don't respect anybody that doesn't have it. Who goes through their purse in the middle of praying ? Who talks through an entire message during church about useless stuff that can wait ? Who leaves comments on other people's myspaces about me instead of telling me they don't like me to my face ? Who ignores the person you've spent everyday with for two months without telling her you don't like her, and you leave her in the dark ? Who hooks up with two people in front of the person they've just promised to stop getting around ? Who makes plans to drink in front of the person they've just promised to stop ? Who tells a guy they like them alot and are so interested in them, but can't turn their phone off, fearing to miss a call from any of the three guys that called her ? Who tells a guy that their feelings won't change, and then ditch them ? Who lies to get of a date because their only flaw makes them look like a human being ?

Respect for my mom. On Good Friday at my church, we have a very large wooden cross. The members of the congregation sign a purple piece of paper that says that Jesus died for their sins, and we nail it on the cross. This year, my mom came up with something new. She designed a new piece of paper, and it's so clever, it gives me all the more reason to be in awe of that woman. A heart-shaped piece of white paper, and the back is red. On the white side, it says ""Jesus gave his life for me."" And you sign your name underneath. Fold it in half, and it's shaped like a drop. Maybe a tear drop ? Maybe a drop of blood ? But it's red. Nail it on the cross, the red tear-filled cross. And come Easter ? Rip the heart in half, and you have a white tear-filled cross. Moral: He gave his heart and bled for us to be pure.

So who am I ? What am I to you ? John was right when he said that he was tired of people saying their friends, but they show no effort in wanting to hang out. Am I just your therapist, or your friend ? Am I worth your time, or are you just worth mine ? 

All complaints aside, time for some good. Isn't it sad that we have to get all our complaints out before we can turn around and say, ""But hey, on the other hand..."". Bad always comes before good. We have to look through the bad to see the good, but we don't have to look through the good to see the bad.

I have no problem texting people and wishing them a good day. I have no problem sitting and listening to people complain for hours. Why ? Because I have some of the most amazing friends a person can have. Maybe they complain to me, but so what ? I know that they aren't bad people. The bad people are people that have don't want to complain, and want to keep it inside. Alot of people don't want to hear people complain, but if I didn't, who would ? How would you get your anger out ? How would you overcome fears ? I think I'm here for a reason. 

Aj, Casey, Cathy, Dj, Mark, Kait, Solveig, John, Gabs, Nicky G, Ryan, you're all worth it. All of this, all of the frustration, all of my patience, all of my compassion, all of my love, it's all for you, you're all worth it. I've never met such amazing people in my entire life, and you're all what makes my time worth while. It hurts that seven out of eleven are leaving the state in a few months. It kills that 7/11 won't be so close in a little while. Ha, hell, 5/7 will be in Pennsylvania. And when that happens, not a weekend will go by when I'll be crying to cross the NJ/PA border to see all 5 of you. You're all worth those tears. And those tears will come. Everyone is leaving the same time, which is going to be terrible, and I'm living each day as it comes, working to make your last few months here worth while. I love you all. Really, I do. It's love. =(

"event","Again. Music. I wanted to write in here before, but no motivation. Mae comes on. It comes like ocean currents.

I am vulnerable.
I am giving.
I am a sucker.
I am lonely.
I am not afraid.
I am just terrified.
I am fearless.
I am worried, though.
I am not real.
I am undecisive.
I am worthless.
I am priceless.
I am not strong.
I am emotional.
I am neverending.
I am honest.
I am trustworthy.
I am vulnerable.

And nothing you say will make me what you want me to be.

So am I foolish ? Am I wasting my time ? Should I not even bother ? This week has consisted of hanging out with Mark. Of crying over Mike. Of talking for hours with Dj. Of driving around with Aj. Of not talking and being in bad moods. Of staring into space and getting lost for hours. Literally.

Is it just ? This guy talks to girl number one, let's call her Mary. He talks to Mary about girl number two, we'll call her Jen. He likes Jen, he wants to be with Jen, they hang out, they're best friends, but Jen has a boyfriend. Well, one night at a party with Jen, they get close and spend alot of time alone. And he likes her more than ever, and would give the world for Jen. But Jen has a boyfriend. And Jen is drunk. Over a few days he finds that Jen doesn't want to break up with her boyfriend, she just can't, but she talks about him so much and says how she doesn't like her boyfriend and likes him. So he is a confused guy. He talks to Mary about her, and Mary tells him that if this girl really liked him at all, she wouldn't be wasting her time with her boyfriend whom she says she doesn't like. And Mary poses the question of ""This girl has no problem cheating on her boyfriend now, what makes you think she won't break your heart ?"" But he doesn't want to hear it. A week or two go by and he starts forgetting about her, and he hangs out with Mary and gets close with Mary. Then, a few days after him and Mary hang out, Jen hands him a note apologizing for how she led him on, and she broke up with her boyfriend, but she seems uninterested in this guy. He tells Mary that her smiles in school are very fake, and she's just not there like she was when she was going out with her boyfriend. So he doesn't fret, because Mary is still on the side, tapping her foot, and hangs out with her a few more times that week.

I am Mary. Is it fair that I'm a side-girl ? Should I care ? He says if she turns around and changes her mind and wants to be with him again, he would. Should I be upset ? Should I just continue as I did without any expectations ? I really want your opinions on this.

A few extra things to write about. Mike is too busy to call me, but Bryan put pictures of Bryan and Mike and other people on his myspace from the mall last night. So much for being SO busy. He's a liar, and filth. I'm very glad I did not spend $80 on him for his birthday yesterday. He's not worth my time, he's not worth my tears. Why they keep coming, I honestly don't know. 

Casey & Cathy are my sisters, I don't care what you fucking selfish bitches have to say about it, all you do is start drama and talk shit, now start drama, and your ass is going to juvie, so try it. I'll knock your teeth in, I'm not a fighter, I'm nothing, but I will risk getting the shit beat out of me for these girls because they're sisters, and I'm not scared of yous. Stop being so goddammned fake and trying to ruin my girls' last few months in New Jersey. You're just jealous because you're the skanks. You can tell by the mere fact of the way yous dress, and by the way we dress. We're not disgusting, we're not filthy, we don't think we might be pregnant. How ridiculous.

I'm really happy that Mark took me to Red Bank last night. Let me try and name every single person I hugged and am so happy that I saw. Kat, Kate, Brendan, Amanda, Eleni, John, Kait, Solveig, Aj, Gabs, saw Annie&Alex&Zac, Amanda, Ryan, Mark, Abby, Alex, MICHELE, Andy, and Tara. So many people that made me so happy.

Kait got her septum pierced, I want my snakebites so badly and should get them this week, I put in my application, I'm going to New Orleans this summer to help fix houses and things, I might work out Chapel Beach Club thing in Sea Bright this summer, I'm working on straight A's for this marking period, and my mom told me this morning that I think we're getting phones ! VERIZON PHONES ! I am very happy about that.

Me and Mike are done. He decided he was just going to stop calling me. Ignored me for 5 days straight, so I showed up at his house, he gave me what I think is the most bullshit I've ever heard, told me he wanted to be with me but cross country is occupying his life. Well you know what ? Noone has cross country 7:00 - 10:00 at night. 6 days a week at that time. And even still, I showed up at his house 7:00 on Friday night and he happened to be home ? And the car that pulled up and started yelling at him about a party wasn't sketchy at all. Whatever. I don't want to deal with a guy that is 1) going to be too much of a pussy to tell me to my face he doesn't want to be with me. I don't care if it hurts, I'd rather know than be left in the dark. It just goes to show how little respect he has for me. 2) I don't want to have to second guess what my boy is saying. That's not cool. 3) Three hours for three days a week is not alot. I'm only allowed out 3 days a week because I got a bad progress report, so I saw him for THREE NIGHTS A WEEK. Is that too much ? Maybe he thought it was. A little ridiculous when we went from seeing each other EVERY SINGLE DAY to 3 days a week then to nothing. So that's what happened to Mike. I told Bryan to tell Mike I didn't want to have anything to do with him, and I would tell him myself, but he's avoiding me. Oh well, I didn't hurt him by breaking it off, because he started it, I just finalized it.

And that's what happened to Mike. I think it's ridiculous how much of an effect music can have on my mood. When I'm sad, it's a few Anberlin songs, almost anything acoustic, Umbrellas, The Early November. When I'm happy and hyper ? Bloodhound Gang, Nelly, A Love Like Pi, PANIC!Atthedisco, Say Anything. It's logicial, of course music is going to effect me, but I don't know. It says things I can't say.

Well, now I hung out with Mark, whom I haven't seen in over a year, maybe two. It was way too long, I missed that kid. It was a swell hangout session to say the least, he makes me laugh so much. And last night I was happy hanging out in Barnes & Noble parking lot with Aj, John, and Dj. Dj is such a good friend to me, I want to hang out with him more. (That's just in case you read this. Heh.)

Three or four more things. I was looking through my comments to find this kids myspace, and they were comments from like fall of last year, and I found ALL of the comments from Nicky G when we were going out. I read almost all of them, and they were so sappy and dumb, but they were so cute. If anyone gets a hold of him or someone that leaves comments like he did, keep them, you'll be sad if you give them up. =/

I was trying to find Alex Gaeta's myspace, we got into a fight last year, he called me fake or something, and I just bugged out because I don't know what that means, and it doesn't make any sense, there aren't many people like me. Well, I heard over the weekend he got his ass beat, apparently his jaw got all fucked up, so to be nice, I messaged him saying that I know it we got into a fight and I hated him ever since, but I hoped he was okay. That was my nice thing for today.

Solveig. I miss her. I'm sorry, but I do, I'm not going to lie. It upsets me so much that we didn't fight, we didn't argue, I don't THINK I did anything, and she refuses to talk to me. Apparently she was mad at me and Aj, but her and Aj are fine now, and we still aren't. And I miss her randomly coming over, her coming to talk to me, cutting my hair, taking me really random places, and just being nuts in 2nd period and stuff. It kind of sucks that there's nothing I can do to make it better because I don't know what I did in the first place. =(

And I think the last thing. Today was so depressing. I sat next to Aj at lunch since Jess wasn't there (Are you sick poopsie ? I LOVE YOU !) and Aj was making a list of all of the things she needed to bring with her to college. Last night, when I went to Barnes & Noble with her, Dj, and John, Aj&Dj were talking about how they're going to school like 10 minutes from each other. Casey is never allowed out anymore because she's cleaning up her house and doing things. She just recently got back from Florida to scope out her new house. Whaaaat the fuck am I going to do ? I can throw a rock to Aj's house, but I can't throw a rock to West Chester, I mean, my best friend who's been there for me at the drop of a hat for 16 years, she's too far to bring me chips. I'm too far to feed her when there's no food around. Who will I bake brownies with for Valentine's Day next year ? Whose paintings am I going to store in my room ? Who is going to drive down 287 going 80 SCREAMING All Hail The Heartbreaker by The Spill Canvas ? Who is going to scream at Mike and Bryan while they're at work with me ? Who is going to take me to Red Bank to hit on the guy at Elsie's ? Who is going to let me drive her car ? Who is going sing to me horribly on the phone and everywhere ? Who is going annoy the friggin' hell out of me so much that I want to kill myself, but things will be okay ? Who's going to cry with me at the spyhouse ? And Casey. Who is going to throw shoes at me ? Who is going to hit on me ? Who is going to tell me when I'm wearing orange ? Who is going to let me borrow books and never return ? Who is going to share a locker with me ? Who am I going to write notes to ? Who is going to talk to Conway until 5 in the morning with me ? Who is going to make me pizza bagels ? Who is going to sit with me after school ? Who is going to try and take Aj from me ? Who is going to buy me shirts and paints for Christmas ? Now Cathy. Oh man. Who is going to be me Gemini twin ? Whose dogs am I going to let lick me all over ? ;) Whose house am I going to ""stop by"" at ? (I don't do that to anyone else but you, by the way. It's cause I'm so close to your parents.) Who am I going to throw pretzels to on the other side of the hall ? Who am I going to blow kisses to while they're in class and I'm going to lunch ? Who am I going to call Crutchy Crutch ? Who is going to talk to vegetables for me ? Whose nieces are going to make me play princess with them ? Where am I going to get pizza ?

Moral of the story, Aj, Casey, & Cathy. You girls are my life, and you're all leaving. You girls are the purpose for me to wake up and go to school, and I don't have that anymore. You girls are the reason I write in my Livejournal, and now what ? I have to fend for myself, and to be honest, with 3/4 of my heart gone, I don't think I'll be strong enough.

PS. I made a bet today for $50 that I'm getting straight A's the last marking period. Psyched ? If I get straight A's, my parents will BUG out.

PSS. Donald Raymond Desfosse is one of the best kids that I have ever met. To be honest, he is such a sweet guy, and I'm sorry that he's always upset, but ya'll don't even know what you're missing. This kid treats women like princesses. This kid is so sweet, he makes any other guy in Middletown look like trash, personally.

PSSS. I need to get my snakebites, like, now. I want me&Kait to go to NY to get them done, that'd be so amazing. I wonder how I'd look.

The end."

<i>Are there no shadows where you are?
I can see everything as day
Problems that you try to hide away
Pushing me aside (You're pushing me aside)

Could the winter calm come twice?
Because your heart seems so cold tonight
Thirst for substance somehow isn't right
It's killing me inside (It's killing you inside)
Killing me inside

I don't wanna be where you are
I don't wanna be here even now
I don't wanna be by your side
If something isn't right

This is our last goodnight
Say what you will
Say all that you can
Words have no meaning
When I've seen where you've been

This is our last goodnight
Say what you will
Say all that you can
This is our last goodbye
This is where love ends

Are you so naive to right and wrong
How could you watch innocence forgone
Does what we've done ever really belong?
It wasted me away (I feel so wasted away)

God if you can hear me out alright
Please take these feelings for her inside
My chest hurts when I breathe tonight
It's wasting me away (You're wasting me away)
You're wasting me away

I don't wanna be where you are
I don't wanna be here even now
I don't wanna be by your side

For some reason, this song has been affecting me lately. Just the lyrics and the song, it makes me think and makes me so sad. It doesn't have anything to do with how I am lately, Mike and I are perfect, we've been perfect, he makes me so happy. When he smiles at me while we're really close and hugging and looking at each other, that makes me feel so happy, so content with being in his arms, it's unexplainable. Yet, all week, I've been seeing Billy, even more than usual, and I just want to cry. He just makes me cry, I guess. The fact that I hurt him, the fact that I just discarded him like an unread book. The fact that I made him cry, the fact that I hurt him badly enough to see the hurt right through his eyes everytime he looked at me, and when I see him at his shows or something, I can't look him in the eyes. I did once, and I saw right into him that he's put a block on me, everytime he sees me he draws that red circle with the line through it, reminding himself that I'm not a good person, that I made him vulnerable, that I ended it. And I'm going to have to live with this forever. I don't know, something about those last few days that we hung out when it was just hurt everywhere. I was trying to push him away as gently as possible, and he would do anything in his power to keep me. That's so upsetting to me, I can't take it. But I do have to grin when I think about how I never let our relationship get all physical. I never ever want a relationship based on sex. That's not what I'm looking for, so if you are, turn around. And that's exactly what him and Sam have. I've been told their relationship is sex. Everyday, all the time, 24/7. So, in a way, I had more with him than they ever will. And that's an awful thing to say or think about, because I like Sam, she's so sweet, and I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does. Quickly changing the subject. Mike. I hung out with him last night, and we've been hanging out for over a month now, and almost everyday, and I've come to see that the thing I love doing most with him is laying in my bed, him hugging me and kissing me, and us just acting look goof-offs. I can't wait until he gets his car back, and it gets nice out. I'm going to take him on dates and we're going to lay at the beach, and the park. Nice things.

So Casey, huh ? Hehe. I have never met a better writer. I'm envious. I'm astonished. I'm jealous. I'm hurt. Hurt that she's leaving, hurt that the girl that makes me bagels everyday, the girl that comforts me, the girl that lends me books, the girl that will cut school with me, the girl that I'd give my life for, is moving. Not around the corner, either. Florida isn't within walking distance. Florida isn't a 40 minute carride up 287 with Aj. Florida is a 3-day drive or something like that. Florida is down, down, down. Florida is not somewhere I can spend the weekend. Florida is way too far for my best friends to be moving to. And I'm planning on getting a Verizon phone (even though I've wanted one, but even more so now) so that I can text her and call her for free. I'm pretty much just being ridiculous and whiney and complaining, and I'm sorry for those of you who've lost a best friend, but I'm not loosing a best friend, I'm loosing a sister. And I'm not loosing just one, but 4. What will I do ? Who will I share a locker with ? Who will I call just to laugh and laugh and laugh nonstop with ? Who will I listen to rap with ? Who will I write poems with, or share books with, who will I write notes too during class, who will I walk to McDonald's with when I'm supposed to be in school, who will I dance with, who will take my best friends' spots ? And she's ready to give it up sooner rather than later because a few girls don't know how to handle themselves as sophmores.

I'm tired. Physically tired. I'm tired of fucking up. I'm tired of not pleasing everybody. I'm tired of drama, of school, of waking up everyday, of never ever having any energy, of thinking I have some sort of deteriorating muscle disease, of not doing homework, of being lazy and telling teachers I didn't do it, of straightening my hair, of trying SO DAMN HARD, of not having money, of not having a phone, of loosing stuff I buy with my own money, of not being able to get my snakebites or my nose pierced, of going to church and crying for being such a terrible person, of people being upset, of people just <b>WAITING</b> to move, of acne, of not being able to do what I want, of being left behind, of sitting on the computer, tired of being tired.

I'm not tired of Mike. I'm not tired of falling asleep with someone, I'm not tired of my music, or New Jersey, my friends, the books I read, the pictures I take, I'm not tired of the sun, or the moon, or food. I'm not tired of drawing or Red Bank or shows. I'm not tired of wanting, I'm not tired of dreaming, I'm not tired of my parents, of writing what I want. I'm not tired of movie nights, card nights, or just plain hangouts. I'm not tired of driving, of gym class, of singing, of being emotional, of having so much love bottled inside of me that I just love my friends never-endingly.

Today, I noticed there are so many people I would just pour my heart out for.

But I can't deal with being routine. 





Things are going well, I just want to live with Mike, basically. Haha. Everytime he comes over I hug him and tell him to sleepover. I never want to mess things up with him, he makes me smile, he makes me happy, and although he's not a very open guy, he will say things reall suttle, but it means the world to me. So, Lord, don't let me hurt him, don't let me mess this up. He doesn't deserve it, he deserves a princess, not me."

He's not too photogenic. Too bad I like him. It's just too bad. He came over last night, and Bryan said he was worried that it was going to be akward and that I was going to get bored of him, and I don't think we stopped talking the entire night. I adore him. He makes me laugh, he makes me smile, I cannot stop touching him when I'm with him, he gives the best hugs, he gets nervous with me, he is hyper and crazy just like me.

So guys, what's the verdict ? I don't really know, I just hope he likes me as much as I like him. He acts like it.

Am I avoidable ? Is there something about me that guys like, but once they hook up with me, I'm not interesting anymore ? Because it seems like lately, that's all that's been going on. Someone will tell me they're into me, and then they realize they've got me wrapped around their finger or something, and I become less appealing. Is there something wrong with me ?

I truely don't understand. I had an amazing time hanging out with this kid, it was complete cuddlefest 2006, awesome. And now he's barely talking to me. Even if he were to tell me that he isn't interested, but I'm left playing guessing games, really. I just want to know how he's feeling. I want to know what is going through his head, or what was going through his head on Thursday.

Oh well. I have to wait. I have to play guessing games until he's ready to tell me how he's feeling I suppose. I'm left trying to figure out if he's ignoring me, or if he's honestly just been busy. I have to decide if he's really worth my time. I have to decide how I'm going to handle this.

I've made some amazingly terrible decisions in my day. Really. 
<b>&</b> The thought of having sex even crossed my mind.
<b>&</b> I got involved with a 22-year old.
<b>&</b> I lied to my friends.
<b>&</b> I got involved with my best friends brother, jeopardizing our friendship, and made everything terrible.
<b>&</b> I cheated on someone so amazing that I will never ever get back. And the boy I cheated on him with isn't worth anybody's time.
<b>&</b> I let my best friends slip away from me. All I want is to have them back.
<b>&</b> I let myself fall for guys too easily. I don't try and stop myself, all I think about is them and their wants.

Pretty much this is me complaining that when I found out some people called me a slut and a whore and nasty and grosse, it's kind of true. I give so much credit to people who either have to really like someone in order to hook up with them.

I need to stop.

know I'm very interested in liking him, because
the person I've known for the past 6 or 7 years
is an amazing one, and keeps getting more and
more sweet every year. I'm going to his house on
Sunday, and I really hope it goes well. He's
going to let me download Armor For Sleep because
he's never heard them and everyone says they will
like them (which he will. This is a boy that if I
say a Something Corporate lyric, he'll sing the
rest of the song.) So maybe when he hears Armor
For Sleep, he'll realize how girls should treat
him and how romance should be, none of that pussy
shit that bitch fools him with. That's not how I
work. And this is different. I won't mess this up.

"event","The more I talk to this guy, the more perfect I think we'd be for each other. We just made plans for Sunday. And we were talking about how this past weekend, I did absoloutly nothing Friday or Saturday, didn't even go out of my house, and he got mad at me for not calling him. 

And we both love cuddling more than life.





And we listen to the same music.








And have the same opinions on things.




We'll see how things go.

"event","I'm sick.
I have so much work to do.
I actually plan on studying for midterms.
I have not one plan for this weekend.
I really should be sleeping.


My friends are great.
My friends are leaving.
My friends are the only ones that care.
My friends are the only people that matter.
My friends are better than you.

"event","I can't settle down. First of all, I'm a slut. Second of all, I cannot be involved with just one person because I think I'm afraid of another Billy or Nick happening. The thing where it gets so intense that I'm baffled, baffled enough to just end it, and in Billy's case, ended by searching for something else. I don't want that. At all.That feeling I got from Billy was such an insane feeling. I'm dying for it back, from anyone, I suppose, that's why I'm letting myself not care what I do.And I love the feeling of holding someone's hand, or having someone's arm around me. It's a terrible feeling. The feeling of being so lost, so confused, so in need of something so badly you're willing to do anything for it. 


Here's where I'm at. I like a boy, maybe a few, and I have these little crush things. I want to give my heart to another boy, but for all the complaining I do, I couldn't hurt him like that. He'd be so perfect, he'd take such good care of it. I've never met anyone as sweet as him. He'd give the world for a girl who wants nothing but attention and ass. He doesn't want to have sex because he sees how bad it hurts people. He's a good kid, because that's what I should see. I'll never learn. I'm so stubborn and so in need of love that I've repeatedly told myself it wasn't a big deal when it is. I can't take it anymore. I need to have my feelings felt and mended and cared for.


What a cry for attention or what a cry for anything I must sound like right now. But this is coming from every cry I've had in the past week. And goodness only knows why I'm so upset lately, but it's destroying me inside, I can just feel it.





I think what has gotten me through the week has been 1) the best friends on the entire planet, not group of people can match these ones. I could live off of them alone as long as they hug me. Hah. AJ, Solveig, Casey, Cathy, Kait, Kat, Conway, Kevin, DJ, Nicky G, Chris, Chris, Mike and whoever I might've missed. 2) I came up with the worst plan in all of creation and I'm so excited for it that I just can't fathom it not coming true. I want to get a house and have shows in it. How I would ever reach $90,000, I do not know, but I'm going to start having my own shows at church to raise the money for it. Yes, I've thought about every expense involved. So many people are putting this idea down, but I just can't hear that. I want it to work so badly, I'd do anything for it to work.

Anddd let's see. First of all, what am I going to do next year ? Next year when Solveig goes to the Marines, when AJ goes to college, when all of my seniors leave ? I'm going to be so damn lost. Especially with Casey and Cathy moving ? I'm loosing my 4 best friends. I'm going to be such a mess.




I can't even think right now. Too many things are hurting me. =("

Well my week so far has been all over the place. First, off I got my tooth fix...well half of it. Second, I am dating an amazing girl her names Meghan. Third, and now this ones a shock for me and everyone else whos been reading. I ended up with some type of restraining order on me from guess who? Tristin's parents.
I mean I have no clue why and how, like I havent done anything to her and I never would, but now shes giving me the cold shoulder and im not allowed to talk to her or go near her so I have no way of finding out how this all happened. And I mean Tristin's parents dont even know me so I'm like so fucking confused about it and I can get any answers!

So yeah that is Monday up until now so hopefully it doesnt get worse. Oh and I get to see Meghan this weekend :).

anyways im outta here."

"event","Hi,
   Well I chose that title because one I need to get one of my teeth pulled and it's been killing me the past couple days. Two because well it's more emotional pain. I feel like i just want to die i mean it would probably be better then being here right now nothings working for me and i only seem to be going downhill, ive been poping pill like crazy and everyone is hating me for it. Erica and i are having problems, we were talking on MSN and as soon as i heard what was going on i wanted to die and i guess thats how it all started. I'm starting to hurt myself again to get all of my problems out and anything else like anger, depression i have alot of that, etc....

So for the people who do know me and are aware of what i used to do i have some news for you that you might not like. 
I slipping back into who i was before and it's only getting worse.

anyway i'm not able to think straight anymore so i am gonna let this be the endign of my live journal for a bit.

I have also started a new site it's nothing big but if anyone wants to check it out. I'm still working on it i just need to find alot of things for it.

"event","Hey,
    Wish I could say that it was a good 4:20 but it sucked...lol, but tonights gonna kick ass.

The events of today are as followed....lol
ok the morning wasnt bad I went to school and got through my first period ok. Second I hung out with Tristin and her friend Megan and had some laughs. Uh now heres the fucked part. I went to James house and we chilled there for a bit but he did the stupidest shit he took Rye, Gin, and some knock off NyQuil and put them together and took it then he took like 7 or 8 codine pills so he was pretty messed up. 

Im sick of my ""friend"" Angus all day I was getting cut up and shit and I guess I got sick of it so I tried to get away from them at lunch. Just as i was leaving Tristin asked me what was wrong and I told her not to worry about it and she gave me a hug and then I guess I just cheered up...lol she has that effect on me. But I decided to stay and finish the day. Plus Tristin is in my last class...lol so I had some fun talking to her and Rick.

I think I might have sent Tristin something I wasnt suposed to...lol I wrote an E-mail to my buddy Mo and I think I put the wrong E-mail address so I think she got that E-mail instead of Mo.....Lets hope she didnt read it.

Anyways I think im dont this journal update so I think Im gonna go have some fun...lol Ctach ya on the flip side.

Im outta here.
Later Dayz!

"event","Hey,
   Well my problem with James was settled he said he was sorry and he never ever says sorry to anyone so i felt special...lol but everything i said was true his friend was back stabbing him and turning him against me but were kool now but he is pissed at his friend that back stabbed him.

Now for the bad part of my day.

I am having second thoughs about Marcie and I because for teh past little while i feel like we have been drifting apart and i guess im not as happy as i was in the begining. I know we had our talk together and i was fine and then a couple days later i was worse then i was before and i still am. I dont want to hurt her but then if it does come down to the point were i am unhappy i dont want it to be a one sided relationship either, but i am trying to forget everything and be happy and it is hard as hell and i guess i should just change who i am and hope it works out for the best.....I liked it when we were friends but then i also like being a couple.....im just wanting to die right now.

anyways hope u injoyed this journal.

I'm outta here."

"event","I'm not going to start off the way i usualy do because i dont see why anyone needs to hear me say ""hey"" every time i make a fucking journal update.

Anyways yah my life has officaly gone down the fucking drain. All my friends have left me minus Tristin and i want to give up on everything. 
My gf wouldnt like that too much but that is the only path i seem to be able to come back to without any trouble. 
James is trying to avoid me cause i told him i would fight him and he just avoids me now. My other friends are gone off with James so i am just going to give up on everything im not happy so maybe if i take a break or whatever for a couple years or something i might be happier........or not.

So everything i have done for everyone and helped them has just been thrown back in my face like they dont even know me.

Anyways ill probably update in a couple days or so.
So i guess im outta here.

A word of advice never be a middle man for anything it will always come back and bite u in the fucking ass."

"event","Hey,

Well today was great i mean i was with a good friend Tristin and her and i were hanging out all day and had fun...lol
so my day at school was pretty good....mostly. My buddy James was all fucking winny and shit and like ""oh no one likes me."" So i tried to help him and i guess it sort of worked.

Then after school i hung out at my buddy Mo's place then we went to the mall and yah it was kool. I then came home and do shit on my computer i get a phone call and it's James and he is like ""Man you've been lieing to me the past week about Tristin"" because they like eachother but James is beeing an asshole and like saying she doesnt, but he was like ""you lied to me"" and i guess Tristin thought he didnt like him anymore so she went out with his friend and that pissed him off. so yah back to my story...lol he then told me ""stay away from me for a bit till i cool down."" So i ask him why? he replied ""would u like me to rearange your face?"" and i was like ""dude were friends i though u knew me better then that."" Then he just hung up on me. So i am giving up on him because as much as i try and help he always throws it back in my face.

So yah now im about to fight my best friend over a chick because her bf told James a bunch of bull shit that led up to this point.

I wont bore you viewers anymore but that was my day, but if you didnt get it at least i got it out...lol

I'm outta here."

   Well i spent the day with my gf and well we drove around with my sister and her ex-bf Jason. We were gone most of the day. 
Once we got home from our little trip we hung out at my place and Marcie and I both had a serious talk and in the end everything did work out and i could never be happier. 
I am still with her thank god. 
I guess i just needed to talk with her to get everything out and sort out all the shit i have been dealing with.

All that matters is that im still with her and i never want to lose her.

    This is my first time ever writing a live journal so I'm still learning the basics because normally i wouldn't write a journal or anything like it but i thought i would give it a try.

Anyways....

My girlfriend is coming over today and i don't know what to do because well it isn't really working out the way i thought it would. I was excited 24/7 when we first started dating but now it's like she tries to avoid me or something. It's weird but i am going to sit down with her today and talk about how this is going to work and hopefully it works out for the best.

So yeah thats my first entry. Ill update as soon at possible and keep all of you informed.

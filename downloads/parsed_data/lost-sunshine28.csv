"event","How can liking one person so much effect how you are to other people in your life? How can they have so much control over somebody else's life and not even notice it? How can being infatuated with someone take you over, how can it be that sooner or later it becomes all that is important in your life? Like nothing or nobody else matters? It is a horrible pain in your stomach, like somone is just kicking you over and over again. Your friends soon become so sick of the bickering and constant talk of it that they just leave you there to feel how you always dreaded feeling, alone. It's like they could save you from death but they no longer care that they lead you there instead of saving you. Don't ever let anyone think you are aren't the greatest person in the world when you know you are. 

Joel thank you for being there for me today when I needed you. You truly are a wonderful person.

I think the only person that keeps me somewhat sane is Bo. He keeps me up and going. He is what makes me happy. Don't get me wrong I love all my friends. But it's different with Bo. I went to Modesto, apparently I'm an intimidating floozy who can't be trusted. That's what my friend's mom told her. It's because Cheri is with my ex, the one I thought I was in love with, and they are going to get married. It's funny that her mother call me that, because Cheri was sleeping with Mario when me and him were together. I guess I just wasn't good enough. He isn't happy with her, I know it. He completeley changes, I don't think he is ready to settle. He is only 20. Why would he settle so early. I think he is just afraid to leave. But, I don't know. -Tina"

But I want you to know
Exactly what I feel
Because it never seems to show
And when it does
Does anyone see?
No, why would theyIt's only me
I'll always be there for you
Like it or not
I feel like you still want to be friends
Yet you have forgot
About what you need
And what you desire
Now that you own my heqrt
The consequences are dire
You hurt me so bad
But I'd still turn to you
For you are the only one
That truly ever knew
How I could be
How nice I would act
How shy I was
You can prove that a fact
But now I'm a bitch
All because of a boy
A boy named Maxon
That's you 
You are the person
That hurt me so bad
That doesn't realize
What they've done
I'm the one apologizing
Even though I never hurt you
I never did anything
It was all for you to do
And you said follow the song
Or chose to be friends
I chose the second one
Until the very end
Because you pulled back
As soon as I gave in
Proved us all wrong
From end to begin"

"event","The continuing adventures of my exegeses on Weird Science (I just realized, perhaps I should start spelling that 'Wyrd Science') will continue, I promise, but I haven't had the time to make them really good, even though the information is down on paper in shotgun format.

I saw <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0399877/"">What the #$*! Do We Know?!</a> on Friday night. I don't know if anyone outside of Portland has heard of it... it was filmed here. It's kind of a documentary, I guess; there are interviews with philosophers and physicists and neurobiologists, spliced with fiction about a woman who experiences things that the former are talking about. The especially odd thing was seeing a movie about how the observer affects the observed in the very movie theater some of the scenes were filmed in. It was like getting physically beaten with synchronicity. Of particular interest was an experiment in which written words placed on beakers of water supposedly altered the water molecules; I might try to see the fellow who did the experiment speak. Regardless of the real results of the experiment, I've been trying to think of how I could adjust the ink in my trusty Sharpie to be a homeopathic mnemo-enhancing agent.

<lj user=""johnnybadhair""> asked me to make him a set of punk-rock runes like the one I've got. I told him that I would do it as soon as I'd learned mine, so I'd have motivation. There are 24 runes in three aetts of eight. So I've taken to writing them on my fingers, one rune per finger joint. It seems to be helping to make associations&mdash;for any given rune there are the runes immediately adjacent within its aett, and there are the ones in its vertical column between aetts. I think I have a firm grasp on fehu, so I've been mostly thinking about uruz lately, just obsessing over it and considering it and really not doing anything too formal other than that. I shall meditate upon it on my next bus ride and see if any new insights arrive.

Finally, I had a chat with the Barbeloids about a Bad Idea I've been mulling over. It's so, <i>so</i> tempting to reach for the wand when I'm feeling heartbroken... but if I love her, I'm going to have to just be fuckin' awesome (magic may or may not be invoked there), trust her to make the decision that's right for her, and cross my fingers that I'll be in that decision. (The independent benefit of working on myself rather than on her is that it allows for finding and attracting someone better suited for me, if such a person exists and is acceptably nearby in my probability cone.) A friend's tarot pull suggested that persistence <i>may</i> be rewarded, but that it will have to be of the practical and patient kind rather than anything active. I've done all I can in that area."

Kids being kids, I took that opportunity to play on the escalator. I fell, and caught myself with my left hand... getting it stuck in the escalator, and getting my ring finger chewed up past the joint.

Because I was so little, and because there just happened to be a hand surgeon on call at the hospital, and because I've got mutant powers, I regrew the fingerjoint. But I think that I chose to be left-handed at the instant that I fell (hence my choice of catching hands), and the combination of intense negative reinforcement coupled with having the hand in a cast for six weeks or so fixed me as a right-hander."

But unlike the generic sylvan glades I've halfheartedly tried to visualize before, this one is coming in very clear, presumably because there's lots of obsessional energy to harness.

There are currently two rooms in my castle. (I mean, I'm assuming it's a castle&mdash;a castle on a spiky mountaintop with a continual lightning storm brewing outside.) There's the laboratory proper: that's where I keep my workbenches (currently one for miniaturized implants, and one for chemicals of some kind but I don't know what my subconscious is intending it for for sure), a locker of specialized environmental gear (I suspect it has both protective clothing and costumes for extra-dimensional excursions), and a chamber flooded with pure ether half-recessed in the center of the floor. The top has a sort of basin built into it so that there is ether exposed to the air and to prodding and pulsing, but most of it is closed off. When activated, it extrudes itself higher out of the floor so that the door is available. I haven't walked through it yet.

The other room is a library or study. It's as luxurious as the other is utilitarian&mdash;dark and cozy but with good reading lights, with walls full of books and chalkboards, an armchair, and a fainting couch for deep thought. One of the books is 'On the Dynamics of Social Systems,' to remind me to research the emotional temperature effect I described earlier (wrt a bombing stand-up comedian).

"event","The first Scientist was a shaman. Botanist, chemist, paramedic, and psychotherapist in one, the shaman may share methods with lay sorcerors, but his primary concern is always that of his people's subsistence and health. He observes and experiments with any and all techniques, based on personal aptitude and available materials, to achieve the goal of a populace of sound body and mind. This method is expressed in the modern world as <b>applied etheric bionomy</b>, in which biological processes are identified and manipulated by whatever means are found effective. (This ruthless practicality may explain the... <i>exuberance</i> of certain Scientists in the bionomic field, particularly in relation to the theory of corpse reanimation.)

Before discussing typical bionomic research, I would like to first distinguish between a medical <b>technique</b> and a medical <b>model</b>. A medical technique is an action taken upon a body for a desired effect, such as the taking of a drug (natural or manufactured), or the use of needles in acupuncture. A medical model is the explanation for why the technique works, such as biochemistry, or chi and meridian theory.

With that distinction made, I can now discuss the standard pattern of bionomic research. First, the bionomist explores the new techniques with respect to her previous medical knowledge (typically the Western model of medicine), considering  the placebo effect, endorphins, auto-immune response, and so forth. This expands what she is capable of doing within the context of her original medical model&mdash;she has absorbed the new techniques, without needing to absorb new theories. However, the next step is to explore her previously known techniques <i>according to the new model</i>. This will extend knowledge in the direction of the new paradigm: What is the meridian theory of the endocrine system? What effect does a martial artist's <i>kiai</i> have on the hippocampus? As more and more models are incorporated into a Scientist's repertoire, the more each one can be extended&mdash;the whole of her knowledge becomes more than the sum of its parts. And she can enjoy a knowing smile when unenlightened science finally <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991532"">catches up</a>."

Mathemagics has an infinite number of axioms. Fortean phenomenonomy is hopelessly interdisciplinary. In general, Ether Science's simultaneous embrace of wholly contradictory theories, as well as its radical leaps from field to field and its numerous sub-sub-branches, makes it impossible to come up with any sort of general overview. 

However, we can codify <i>applications</i> by looking at the classical domains explored by occult engineers (""sorcerors""). Sorcery, divination, healing, ego magic, evocation, and invocation can all be viewed through a Scientific framework; from there, each Scientist can choose approaches to problems based on his or her aptitude and preference. One man's Orgone Particle Accelerator might be another's nonlinear solutions of the Social Butterfly Effect, but either approach leads to chatting up that ravishing astrophysicist at the party.

I have divided the primary aims of Science into four categories: Etherdynamics, Applied Etheric Bionomy, Noetic Science, and Etheric & Memetic Dimensional Science. There is plenty of crossover between the fields, and your categorization may vary, but we've got to start somewhere.

<lj-cut>
<B>ETHERDYNAMICS</B>

Etherdynamics is the science of direct interaction with the probability wavefronts that propagate through the ether. Whereas thermodynamicists use probabilistic methods to observe how quadrillions of molecules interact to transmit energy and do work on a macroscopic level, etherdynamicists work the other way around to affect and interpret probabilities. Experiments to create paracausal effects, or ""sorcery"", fall under <b>active etherdynamics</b>: sigils are the classical Chaos Magic method of creating simple etheric standing waves. <b>Passive etherdynamics</b>, on the other hand, is the collection and interpretation of information about events which are unfolding somewhere else in spacetime; spontaneous instances are generally known as synchronicities, whereas more formal information-gathering is generally known as ""divination"", be it through quantum chronoscopy, cryptotechnological devices such as runes, or through psychic premonitions.

<b>The Probability Cone</b>
Students of physics will be familiar with the concept of the <a href=""http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone"">light cone</a>, a geometrical representation of how the speed of light limits what events in spacetime can possibly affect one another. A similar (though less rigid) probability cone is at work in etherdynamic studies. Active etherdynamic effects are more likely to succeed if they are done well in advance of the target time&mdash;an experiment to, say, make me President of the United States has a far better probability of success working on a 40-year timeline than a 10-month timeline. The reverse is true for passive experiments: it is far easier to make a prediction about 10 seconds hence than 10 centuries hence.

<b>Hazards</b>
Some would warn against meddling with Secrets Man Was Not Meant to Know! However, any Scientist of sufficient pluck takes heed of the old saw, ""Better living through reckless experimentation"" and forges ahead. Nevertheless, one may want to take precautions before engaging in active etherdynamic experiments. First, before instantiating an etheric standing wave, it is wise to ensure there is a 'path of least resistance' for a desired probability to manifest along. Otherwise, the dissonance between a probability wavefront attempting to manifest and a world which is resistant to that manifestation can resolve unpredictably, resulting in, say, the large financial reward that was sigilized for coming in the form of compensation for the loss of limbs to an industrial-sized Tesla coil. Second, it may be preferable to enlist the aid of a third-party extra-dimensional entity (or EDI) with influence related to the desired effect as opposed to direct etheric manipulation; more on this in Etheric & Memetic Dimensional Science.

<b>Some Techniques</b>
As previously mentioned, the well-known sigil technique creates a single, strong pulse which is well-suited to creating etheric standing waves. For those inclined, cryptotechnological 'rituals' have their uses (though I would recommend keeping a careful record of what does and does not appear to be truly necessary, making modifications with each experiment). I have been considering the use of second-order differential equations [a*d2y/dt2 + b*dy/dx + c*y = r(t)] in forcing and damping probabilities by manipulation of the parameters, but this is as yet untested. Perhaps a Tibetan prayer wheel as the r(t) forcing function?

"event","I've been working on a Weird Science manifesto, and I noticed that I was throwing around the word 'ether' like confetti. I need to back up and define what ether is, so that I can work from a strong foundation.

Historically, ether was the hypothesized medium through which electromagnetic waves, such as light, travelled. According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main+Page"">wikipedia.org</a>, ""Aether was thought to be a fluid which was transparent, non-dispersive, incompressible, continuous, and without viscosity."" Experiments showed that if ether were to exist, it had to have some very bizarre properties; so, the principle of reductionism eventually won out, and the simpler model (namely that electromagnetic waves are simply unlike physical waves, and need no medium) replaced the increasingly baroque theory of ether.

Inspired by the Sons of Ether, I've reclaimed the ether for broader purposes. Philosophically, ether is a non-analytic, non-reductionist medium for information and energy. Rather than hiding under jargon, I'll explain what I mean by example.

Consider a stand-up comedian&mdash;a <i>bombing</i> stand-up comedian. He gets heckled, and doesn't deal with the heckler very well. The audience is generating such an aura of hate that it is almost palpable. You are uncomfortable being in the room, but it would make you more uncomfortable to leave. Now, what is 'really' going on, analytically, is a complex informational transaction: body language and tone of voice of the comedian and the audience members, pheromones, recall of personal experiences, microtemperature changes as blood pressures rise, and who knows what else are all influencing your emotional processors to cause this sensation of discomfort. Analysis might give us some insight (ether is not <i>anti</i>-analytic, after all) but, paradoxically, hypothesizing an 'unnecessary' medium through which emotions propagate is a more convenient explanation than keeping track of a hundred different factors coming in through five senses. 

Another example is that of a friend you know very well, to the point that you are frequently thinking the same thoughts and finishing one another's sentences&mdash;it <i>might as well</i> be telepathy (the common name for etheric coupling between two mental morphic fields), even if it's 'really' shared experience plus familiarity with gestures and speech patterns. Reductionism suggests that we leave it at that simple explanation; but, because ether is a non-reductionist medium, we allow it to remain as part of our model for what is going on. And that is useful because we can use our hypothetical medium to attempt other experiments that might not be suggested by the reduced model&mdash;perhaps you and your friend would make a really bitchin' rhythm section, telepaths that you are. 

Ether is the ultimate paracausal medium. It is the medium through which complex systems feed back information upon themselves in their dance of self-organization. It is the medium through which ki travels along the body's meridians. It may be detectable, as in bioelectricity or pheromones or homeopathic aggregates, or so invisible that even statistical inferences register it slightly if at all, as in psychic abilities. Its objective validity is irrelevant; for example, synchronicities may be the oversensitivity of the subconscious to a particular environmental message, or coded information delivered to your door by the ether net: the end result is the same. 

According to philosopher Karl Popper, a science that isn't <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"">falsifiable</a> isn't a science at all. So it is a valid complaint that ether can be used to explain virtually anything. But science be damned&mdash;this is Science!"

To attempt a comprehensive classification of the fields of Enlightened Science would be the acme of foolishness. Mathemagics has an infinite number of axioms; Fortean phenomenonomy is a a tangled web of interdisciplinary study; etheric bionomy is replete with contradictory theories.

However, Science looks backward as well as forward, taking what has come before as a framework to be studied and reformulated. We can look to our forebears, the occultic engineers (""sorcerors"") of past and present, for guidance on how to classify the <i>applications</i> of Science. Knowing the <i>questions</i> allows each Scientist to determine, based on preference and aptitude, what disciplines to use in finding the <i>answers</i>.

Classically, the major topics in cryptotechnology are sorcery (ritual actions with acausal results), divination (extra-sensory information gathering), evocation (summoning, communicating, and negotiating with extra-dimensional entities, or EDIs), invocation (self-identification with an EDI or qualities thereof), healing (self-explanatory), and ego magic (work done upon the self and beliefs). I have reordered and renamed these to fall in line with my vision of Science. Your results may vary.

<b>NOETIC SCIENCE</b>
The Noetic Sciences (from Greek <i>noein</i>, to think) are the studies of the mind and personality: elimination of phobias, modification of personality traits (temporarily or permanently), and learning of new cognitive skills (such as improving the ability to brainstorm) are possible goals. Techniques include meditation, neuro-linguistic programming, didactic techniques (such as <a href=""http://www.mind-map.com/mindmaps_howto.htm"">mind mapping</a>), and direct application of electrodes to the brain.

<b>DIMENSIONAL SCIENCE</b>
Dimensional Science is the study (and creation) of objects, entities, and geographies which have no objective validity, but affect the 'real world,' either directly or by subjectively affecting the Scientist. Dreamwork, summoning or creating extra-dimensional entities (or EDIs), and work with literary universes ('literomancy') all fall within this area.

Some Scientists choose to distinguish between <b>memetic dimensions</b> and <b>etheric dimensions</b>. Memetic dimensions are consciously created by humans via narratives (for examples, see <i>The Invisibles</i>, Grant Morrison et al, 2000, and ""An Account of the Neverland Expedition,"" Gwendolyn Darling, 1911). Etheric dimensions are supposed


Dimensions may be classified into  and <b>etheric dimensions</b>, which exist apart from human intentions (such as 'gods', manifestations of natural forces, and the like). However, this rough division causes immediate classification problems, leading us to ask ourselves questions such as, ""Has Mickey Mouse has become recognized by so many billions as to be freed of his memetic origins?"" Furthermore, an existentialist might argue that any 'god' is memetic in origin, while a Pythagorean would insist that any narrative is a manifestation of an etheric ideal.

I use the criterion of authorship to divide the two sorts of entities: if one can trace an entity's birth to the pen of an individual, I classify the entity as memetic; if the origins are indeterminate, either because the human creators of gods are lost in history or because the entity is untouched by human hands, I consider the entity etheric. The schema used is largely irrelevant: both types of dimensions can be interacted with in the same ways, and any EDI will prefer to be handled on its own terms&mdash;regardless of the veracity of the claim, Odin will not be amused if you claim he is a Scandinavian folk tale! Questions of classification aside, field research into etheric and memetic dimensions (also known as 'evocation', 'visionquesting', 'literomancy', 'narrative hypersigils' and the like)

Also within the domain of dimensional science is <b>Platonic engineering</b>, the creation of etheric programs, machines, and automatons. (Occultic engineers refer to these as 'servitors.') These devices may be simple and temporary, or may have near-biological complexity and permanence. Some may even have instructions to replicate themselves under certain conditions; but beware! The natural tendency for Scientific devices is to escape their constraints (see ""On Spontaneous Nonlinear Behavior of Reanimated Organisms,"" V. Frankenstein, 1831); a Platonically engineered device may grow in power until it may as well be a fully independent EDI, as with the celebrated Fotamecus.

<b>APPLIED MORPHIC FIELDS</b>
An extension of the theory of <a href=""http://www.sheldrake.org/faq/answers.html#MorphicFields"">morphic fields</a> can explain the classical phenomenon of 'invocation.' Etheric and memetic dimensions (and their denizens) are themselves self-organizing systems; by setting up appropriate resonances, a Scientist can allow him or herself to be influenced by the fields of an EDI, thus 'skimming off' aspects of the EDIs personality and skills. Thus, the theory of applied morphic fields is a halfway point between the noetic and dimensional sciences.

<b>ETHERIC BIONOMY</b>
Principles of etheric bionomy may be found in the chi manipulations of acupuncturists, the olfactoro-psychology of aromatherapists, the astounding musculo-skeletal feats of martial artists, and countless other areas. Biological phenomenon are named and accounted for, and explored acco

"event","This is my favorite thing about chaos magic: The <a href=""http://www.white-wolf.com/mage.html"">Mage: The Ascension</a> roleplaying game has a series of books about the mage factions in the game world. I started perusing the one for the Sons of Ether, just because they're the most fun; now I own it, and I am reading it in all earnestness as a serious magico-philosophical text.

<lj-cut text=""Ave Ether!"">
I'll begin with an explanation of who these people are. The Sons of Ether are more or less the 'mad scientists' of the Mage world (usually associated with 1930s pulp sensibilities). According to their paradigm, they're not doing 'magic' at all: they're Scientists! But rather than merely making observations and codifying things into possible and not-possible, the Etherites cobble together accepted scientific laws, discredited theories (like phlogiston or, their namesake, the luminiferous ether), so-called 'occult' practices (which, after all, are merely the linguistic, parapsychological, and etheric technologies of ancient cultures), and their own creative ideas into theories which allow them to do whatever they can think of! (Or, alternatively, turn them and their laboratories into charred radioactive sludge&mdash;risk is part of Science.) Better living through reckless experimentation!

Their philosophy largely comes from a primer on Enlightened Science called the Kitab al-Alacir (""Book of the Ether""). I'll go into it more later, but the major things I'm taking from Sons' philosophy now are:

<b>The Rejection of Reductionism.</b> The 'true' explanation for something is not necessarily the simplest one. A more complex theory allows for creative leaps instead of slow crawls away from naked axioms.

<b>Contradictory Models May Both Be True.</b> An example is that of a typical Western doctor, and a Son of Ether, both examining acupuncture as a medical technique. The first examines acupuncture with respect to his previous medical training, relating it to the placebo effect, endorphins, and so on; then he tests his theories, expanding his knowledge of medicine&mdash;but only in one direction. The Etherite will do the same thing, but will then examine the technique <i>according to its own model</i> of chi theory, and try applying that model to conventional techniques, thus expanding both his conventional medical knowledge and that of Chinese medicine (for example, by developing meridians for the endocrine system, unknown to early Chinese doctors).

So, why am I so excited about this stuff? Many reasons. I want to be fairly rigorous about my rituals&mdash;ah, excuse me: my <i>paracausal experiments</i>&mdash;lest I fall into magus-itis (the condition in which you elect yourself OMG ALL POWREFUL R0X0R SORCERAR!!1!), and looking at them as mad science will help. I want to blend some of the math I'm learning into my wacky self-delusions, and Etheric Science is the perfect framework to explore mathemagical theory. And, I like naming things preposterously: 'divination' is confusing and imprecise, but I can really grab hold of 'Quantum Chronoscopy'! Servitor and sigil work becomes Platonic Engineering. Literomancy (a la <i>The Invisibles</i>) and communication with gods become Memetic & Etheric Dimensional Science. The so-called 'magickal link' between distant objects is easily explained when one factors in the exchange of fermions (particles of matter), bosons (particles of energy), gravitons (particles of space-time/gravity), psions (particles of consciousness), and emotions (particles of feeling, usually mispronounced as 'e-MO-shuns'). 

I think you see what I'm getting at. Expect an exponential increase in jargon in future entries.

"event","Today I set off my first chaos-grenade. The concept is simple: Mime pulling a pin and throwing a grenade toward a situation that could use a wackiness and synchronicity injection, count to five (""Three, sir!"") and envision an eight-rayed multicolored star explosion. Or, if you just want to invite more bizarritude into your own life, throw the pin and hold that sucker in your lap. I did some extra credit: I made a physical representation by folding an origami lotus blossom, detonated it, and left it on the subway. My theory is that finding a folded lotus blossom is a minor injection of weirdness for someone, and so it works for the spell on the principle of correspondence.

Tommy, you possess an interesting balance of hemispheric and sensory characteristics, with a slight right-brain dominance and a slight preference for visual processing. 

Since neither of these is completely centered, you lack the indecision and second-guessing associated with other patterns. You have a distinct preference for creativity and intuition with seemingly sufficient verbal skills to be able to translate in any meaningful way to yourself and others. 

You tend to see things in ""wholes"" without surrendering the ability to attend to details. You can give them sufficient notice to be able to utitlize and incorporate them as part of an overall pattern. 

In the same way, while you are active and process information simultaneously, you demonstrate a capacity for sequencing as well as reflection which allows for some ""inner dialogue."" 

All in all, you are likely to be quite content with yourself and your style although at times it will not necessarily be appreciated by others. You have sufficient confidence to not second-guess yourself, but rather to use your critical faculties in a way that enhances, rather than limits, your creativity. 

You can learn in either mode although far more efficiently within the visual mode. It is likely that in listening to conversations or lecture materials you simultaneously translate into pictures which enhance and elaborate on the meaning. 

It is most likely that you will gravitate towards those endeavors which are predominantly visual but include some logic or structuring. You may either work particularly hard at cultivating your auditory skills or risk ""missing out"" on being able to efficiently process what you learn. Your own intuitive skills will at times interfere with your capacity to listen to others, which is something else you may need to take into account."

We're coming up on my reBirthday--March 25th, 2002, I set <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=perfecttommy&itemid=5339"">certain</a> <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=perfecttommy&itemid=5539"">events</a> in motion, ever so slowly, which led to emotional, geographical, and sartorial changes that I am enjoying immensely, even as I continue to process them. 

Now, I consider personal changes to be an integral part of majikal practice, whether or not you wear a funny hat to enact them. A couple of the most vital influences have been a couple of books I mentioned on my <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/tom_o_bedlam"">alter ego's journal</a> a few weeks ago, and I'd like to mention them again here:

<b><i>How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci</i>, Michael J. Gelb</b>
Thesis: Leonardo da Vinci was a genius largely because he allowed an intermingling of all the things he was interested in; in his notebooks, sketches of birds in flight are adjacent to plans for military machines and shopping lists and jokes. There's a lot of hero-worship, but the concept that cultivating observational skills, considering learning as a form of play rather than work, and leaving specialization to the insects leads to a richer life has been spot on. Try the exercises, a little at a time, and observe the results.

<b><i>The Mind Map Book</i>, Tony Buzan</b>
Thesis: Linear note-taking, whether to organize others' thoughts or your own, is the equivalent of starting a painting at the upper left corner and moving across and down without considering the whole picture. Mind-mapping is a type of note-taking which utilizes radiant thinking (you start at the center and move out, from association to association, rather than making sentences and forcing step-by-step thought) and adds color, dimension, spatial organization, image, and other visual elements to the note-taking process. Don't get me wrong--it takes practice to get used to the idea, and you will probably rebel during your first few attempts. But now that my mind-mapping skills are improving, I simply <i>think</i> faster and deeper and with more detail, and I am a much better student, in speed and in recall.

Final recommendation: Take debate, or perhaps a public speaking class. That's been the polish on my transformation from depressed introvert to happy mutant--but I'll have to talk about that later."

"event","<a href=""http://www.barbelith.com/underground/topic.php?id=7610#post126107"">This</a> is one of the most useful philosophical positions on magic that I've ever seen (emphasis is Sebastian's):

<blockquote>If you have a magickal intention, the universe will start throwing you bits of it. <b>SO</b>, once the spell is casted, everything you perceive in relation to your desire fulfillment must be acknowledge as such, and enacted upon. Anything from internal to external: thoughts, suggestions, pieces of conversations, silent stares, mistakes, the titles of newspapers, magazine covers that you pass by, etc, etc. If a given perception appears to command you to do something, do it, <b>but</b> as if you don't give a shit about the whole thing. Always remember that enacting upon synchronicities with all your might and obsessive emotional load <b>is precisely what sends people to assylums</b>. The Magickian is out of the assylum only because nobody notices he is following a nutty synchronicity, and because he doesn't have a fit if it fails. So act upon it, but be prepared in advance to withdraw and to be fooled many times, so you will not loose your temper. Be polite, kind, gentle, and respectful while acting, leave always a door open to turn back with a cheerful smile (""Ooops, sorry, the pleasure is mine."").</blockquote>

I <i>love</i> this. Magick is seen as a friend who is occasionally right about amazing things, but is also a pathological liar. Following a wacky synchronicity can be explained by actions of spirits, or purely as an perceptual act of some subroutine of the brain; either one might lead you to a valuable insight, or might be completely worthless, even malicious. This attitude allows for openness to possibility, but in a whimsical, self-protective fashion. Kind of like falling in love, enjoying it for what it is, and still recognizing that a total emotional investment would lead to obsession and having your heart ripped out."

"event","<i>Originally posted on <a href=""http://barbelith.com/underground/topic.php?id=8367"">barbelith.com</a>:</i>

There are certain principles and tricks that I think up from time to time--exercises and possible procedures for dealing with daily life, or with a particular art form. Just, y'know, stuff to try someday. I generally write them in my notebook, and then forget them forever.

Today I was writing one down, and I gave it a silly name (""Yellow Tongue Defense""). The name reminded me of the maneuver names that fighters in arcade games shout when they're doing a move; at the same time, I realized that these rules-of-thumb might make handy servitors.

The general procedure I had in mind:

1) Take a principle you'd like to apply to some situation (but keep forgetting to). The one I had today: ""When doing some art/writing project, if the fear of making something less than perfect starts to paralyze you, consciously fuck up the piece to make it willfully ugly, and go from there.""

2) Contemplate the principle, meditate on it, hang out with it. If you can't quite put it into words, just roll it around in your head until you understand what it means.

3) Give it a cool name. (I imagined that I would make something so ugly that I'd stick my tongue out and go ""Ewwwww!"" and my tongue would be yellow, because that's my least favorite color.) Associate the name to the principle. (I started imagining that my tongue was covered in yellow paint, and I was licking a painting to make it really goddamn ugly.)

4) Make a sigil. I'm thinking a sphere (representing an energy battery); some symbol which means something like ""to recall"", or a symbol associated with a brainy wise god; and a sigil made of the letters of the maneuver's name.

5) Fire 'n forget the sigil. The servitor hangs around wherever servitors sleep, charging up, like an aetheric capacitor.

The intended result: When you find yourself in the situation (in the above example, when I'm getting frustrated with a piece of art), the servitor fires. You are reminded strongly of the principle (I am imagining the flashback sequence in episodes of ""Kung Fu""), and you get a burst of self-confidence and feel-good energy, which you can use applying or ignoring the principle as you see fit at that instant.

It's all just a tricky way of letting your contemplative past self give you a helpful push and a whisper when you need it. It seems awfully complex now that it's laid out in type, but when it came to me in a rush I thought it might be a spiffy behavior modification technique.

Comments, complaints, cool maneuver names? (And anyone have an idea what symbols might apply for the basic training sigil?)"

"event","Preliminary thoughts on <i>The Teen Witch Kit</i>:

* There are four grounding/centering exercises presented, one for each element. If you're grounding yourself and need patience and calm, perhaps you'll do the Earth one. If you're grounding yourself and want to come out with inspiration, perhaps you'll do the Fire one. I think this is a great idea (although the fire one asks for sunlight, and I live in Portland... might be a problem).

* Nothing complicated in the way of divination--you're advised to flip your Yes/No coin before doing a spell to see if it's a good idea. If it's not, maybe all you have to do is wait for a different moon phase.

This sounds both good and bad--no complex ideas to learn about divination, but therefore no complex ideas to get out of divination.

* There's a cute method of spell design. I forget the precise details, but you draw 10 dots at random on a paper. Then you choose any old dot to be the first one, and there you note your statement of intent. Then you pick any old dot to be the second one, and there you note your materials (or something). There are 10 ""things you should think about"" listed--y'know, statement of intent, spirits/gods you intend to work with, forces in opposition, moon phase, and so forth--and when you're done, you connect the dots. Voila! Not only have you put thought into a lot of different areas of influence regarding the spell, you now have a sigil associated with it.

* There is WAY too much on shopping magick (both pro, as finding good deals, and anti, as fighting the urge to spend compulsively). But then again, it IS about time in my life to think up some new wardrobe ideas; taking on the form of a teenaged girl looks more useful all the time.

Actually, I picked up a Silver Ravenwolf ""Teen Witch"" book a few days ago... that might be more my speed.

See what I mean? I am finding it hard to describe to people who aren't familiar with speech tournaments how extraordinary the good parts are, so you'll have to trust me. But there were unpleasant and dangerous fuck-ups in the air as well.

Your mileage may vary, but I'm not going to trust any strange sigils unless I have desperate need of sudden shock. Which could totally happen some day, I admit..."

"event","I'm always noticing symbols on the sidewalk--I know they're just signs for cable lines and sewers and what-not, but some of them are very sigil-like. I noted one a few days ago. Since I've been sick, I wondered if maybe it was a health-increasing sigil, but that didn't have the ring of truth when I considered the idea.

Last night, though, while approaching a climax for, ahem, personal reasons, I suddenly had the impulse to fire that unconstructed sigil that Portland had handed to me. I went with the idea. I'm not quite sure how to report on its success or failure given that I don't know what it's doing, of course..."

"event","Right. Earlier this year, I had a marvelous idea: I would keep the record of my explorations into chaos magic online, so that (a) other newbies could watch someone's first stumbling steps, (b) experienced folks could comment on my activities if they so chose, and (c) I would be shamed by ""Why haven't you been posting"" comments into keeping it up.

Apparently, (c) didn't quite work. I wasn't proud of letting dust collect for 10 months, but I wasn't ashamed enough to do anything about it. Besides, I wasn't really practicing; I was studying math and moving to Portland, instead.

But given that I've been slipping more and more commentary on synchronicity into my more typical LJ entries as <lj user=""tom_o_bedlam"">, I figured it was time to try again. The entries you've been reading are the ones pulled off Blogger and Chaosmagic.com, backdated to create a super-secret false origin.

It's going to take me a while to get up to speed, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get sufficient web-fu to have the sorts of grandiose functionality I imagine when thinking about a web page, but here's to initiation never ending.

"event","After a few hours with a pen, notebook, and Condensed Chaos, I have just about relegated the willcatcher idea to the ""stupid/unnecessary/unworkable metamagic"" pile. I played with flowcharts, circuit diagrams including subsigils, and half-remembered psedoJava programming, and came to the conclusion that it makes more sense to be thoughtful about sigils in the first place. Maybe it will simmer into something more useful. In other news: Wanchanoweet got me a bus less than 30 seconds after I called him. I said softly aloud, ""Dear Wanchanoweet: I offer you this wasted cigarette, that a bus may come. Amen."" Then I lit up, gazing briefly into the flame. Immediately, the 181 arrived, and I tossed the butt aside and said the standard phrase of thanks."

"event","I've been mulling over some sigils over the past couple of days. Even though some of the things I had in mind sounded like they were outside the scope of what sigils are really good for--they're complex and behavior-altering, rather than short and easily defined--I figured I'd operate on the <lj-cut text=""principle of substitution"">So, one of the neat things about chaos magic is you don't have to have, say, fancy expensive ritual tools carved out of the heart of a 400-year-old tree, and you can just pick up some stick that moves you, right?

The problem, of course, is being ""moved"" at the right time. The ego is truly diabolical in all the ways it can sabotage actual action--at least, mine is--and one of the tricks it uses is convincing you need everything to be right before you can start.

So, one sleight-of-mind trick I'm trying is the principle of substitution. Basically, if I haven't found the ""right"" tool yet, I just assume that it will show up eventually and use something completely droll beforehand--not just ""not-fancy,"" but something that doesn't even have particular emotional significance. If I find something that says ""chalice"" to me, whether it's a coffee cup or an unearthed skull-chalice with ruby eyes unearthed from an ancient Indian burial ground, that's great--until then, I intend to use a cereal bowl.
</lj-cut>, fire them off anyway, and hope for the best. Maybe those sigils would operate by giving me some ideas on other techniques to achieve the goals in question. Then I got to thinking: If one of the strengths of chaos magic is the ""technical excellence,"" firing off sigils that you don't really expect to work properly is just bad science, innit? So, I thought of a servitor, or rather a type of servitor, that I'd like to create. I'm calling it a ""willcatcher."" Its function is to watch over the sigils that you launch. Those statements of intent that lend well to sigilization are ignored by the willcatcher. The SOIs that would be better served by a ritual, a series of meditations, or the like are ""caught"" and processed. By ""processed,"" I don't mean that the servitor does all the work and breaks the sigils down into components (althought that would be a neat trick); rather, it attempts to direct the caster to more appropriate methods. So, my thoughts on the design parameters for a willcatcher:<ul>
<li>It watches all the basic sigils you launch. Those statements of intent which would be better served by another method are caught for processing. ""Well-formed"" sigils, and SOIs launched via non-sigil methods are ignored.
<li>A willcatcher comes online with little in the way of personality. Imagine a very powerful computer, beyond anything we have today, that still lacks a real will of its own. However, it may develop a personality of its own over time, or it may choose to develop a symbiotic relationship with a willing spirit and act as a sort of intermediary. If this were to occur, the spirit in question might express its personality through the willcatcher. Perhaps a willcatcher may be designed with a particular symbiosis in mind; if that symbiosis isn't appropriate for the mage, that is okay, because--
<li>One of the core functions of a willcatcher is to evaluate its own utility to the user, and if it finds something lacking, alert the user that it desires to be decommissioned and replaced (or ""recommissioned""). I imagine that one mage might benefit from a willcatcher that knows all hir quirks, whereas another would benefit more from one which refreshes its frame of reference in accordance with the practitioner's changing goals and paradigms. That implies that the willcatcher: 1) has an off switch; 2) has a method of alerting its user that a recommissioning is called for; 3) can export a sort of ""dump file"" which will be used by its successor so the successor has data on what has come before and doesn't have to reinvent the wheel if it doesn't want to; 4) can notify any attached entities of the coming ""interruption in service,"" and either thanks it and sends it on its way, or makes arrangements for the new willcatcher to evaluate the benefits of resuming the relationship. (Note that in the above point, a willcatcher that has been inappropriately linked to an entity will immediately notify its user that it wishes to be recommissioned.)
<li>The willcatcher must have a method of communicating its suggestions to the user. The default interface would be communication through synchronicities. Other interfaces might be dreams, meditation, or pre-defined divination methods.</ul>
I'm not sure how clear all that is. It's fairly clear in my head what I'd want present, but I haven't worked out the details."

"event","That's it--I'm selling everything I can stand to. I just have to attach some clever magical thing to the act of doing so. Anyone? I suppose that it could be a reinvention of the self, cutting of attachments to things that don't really matter; but, I get the feeling I've done that all before and not really gotten anywhere with it. Then again, there's nothing wrong with doing that sort of thing regularly, I suppose. 

Because I think it's funny, a quote from A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers:

<blockquote>These things, details, stories, whatever, are like the skin shed by snakes, who leave theirs for anyone to see. What does he care where it is, who sees it, this snake, and his skin? He leaves it where he molts. Hours, days or months later, we come across a snake's long-shed skin and we know something of the snake, we know that it's of this approximate girth and that approximate length, but we know very little else. Do we know where the snake is now? What the snake is thinking now? No. By now the snake could be wearing fur; the snake could be selling pencils in Hanoi. The skin is no longer his, he wore it because it grew from him, but then it dried and slipped off and he and everyone could look at it. 

<i>And you're the snake?</i>

Sure. I'm the snake. So, should the snake bring it with him, this skin, should he tuck it under his arm? Should he? 

<i>No? </i>

No, of course not! He's got no fucking arms! How the fuck would a snake carry a skin? Please.</blockquote>"

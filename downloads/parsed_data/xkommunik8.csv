"event","It's so comforting for me to realize that I don't need anyone. Seriously. If the few people I know decided never to talk to me again, it really wouldn't break my heart. I would merely relish the peace.  It's nice to realize I don't have to explain myself to anybody.  I am who I am, and I can't change who I am for someone else. And why should I? Fuck all of those who are full of so much pride that they expect you to live the way they do; think how they think.  Why are there so many people who are like that? I don't go around, expecting others to think how I think, like the same things I like and believe in my same beliefs.  I tell you what you can do for me, however.. Can you just die and give me that much more room to breath?  This world is full of some stifling mother fuckers. I am no one's puppet.  Most human beings, quite honestly, are not worth the energy and the time to get to know, because humans are too fragile. We live in a world that has been made plastic. The natural world becomes ever more a mystery and a taboo, as we separate ourselves from that which nurtured us at the time of the first fruits of man.  It is now Man vs Woman.. Woman vs Man.. As we defile the world around us, and then, with the same cheek, expect Mother Earth to feed us, cloth us, and sustain us. A rift grows wider, despite any claim to progress.  This society has become so expansive and complex that peace and understanding are accepted strangers. So if you want to talk to yourself, go right ahead. Nobody will hear you anyway."

"event","woke up at 8:10am. went to work. only got a couple hours of sleep last night because i took a nape in the evening and woke up around 11pm last night and couldnt back back to sleep. so i surfed the net, listened to music, watched a little of the telly.. so i get to work and wrote up a few orders. got a few juicy ones. stayed pretty steady at work. IM'd back and forth with a girl i have been befriending.. may i stress the word ""friend,"" here. we've only known eachother about 3 weeks. we did hang out saturday the 30th in bethesda.  we went bike riding, then walked around bethesda and hung out in the coffee shops all day and chatted. we also had lunch at some place called the mongolian bbq. wasn't bad.  they cook your food fast. you can choose your own spices and stuff.  they give you a bowl, and you fill it up as much as you can, then they grill it in front of you and then throw on a dinner plate and serve with white rice. not bad, but i could have done the same thing at home.  this was our first ""sort of date.""  so, as evening got close, i asked her how to get back to the beltway so i could go home. she said her apartment was on the way there and would i like to see it.  well, i was thinking, this girl must really trust me if she is inviting me to her apartment on the first date.  so i got to see her apartment and stuff.. we had something to drink.  she had a bottle of irish cream she has been struggling to get open for months, and she asked me to open it for her. i couldn't do it.. the thing was glued shut by all the glucose in there.  so i got a butterknife and wacked it around the lid and, presto, i got it open.  what a show off.
i was getting really tired, so i said i was going to go.. her friends had already invited her to an 80s dance party at Black Cat in D.C., but i had no energy to go.. so, i gave her exactly 3 hugs, and went home. 
anyway, we have been IM'ng and emailing one another like you wouldnt believe. i don't think anything is going to happen between us.. just have become friends. besides, she said, in no uncertain terms, that she doesn't find blonde guys attractive. well, i have blonde hair, but my head is shaved, so that shouldnt count.  she's from Lima, Peru.  she has very fark skin. her father was of Incan decent. she could pass for a black girl. she has long, curly, black hair. not a bad looking lady, actually.  so, i am not going to expect anything more than friendship. oh well.  she's 35 years old - perfect for someone like me who is 38.  she likes salsa dancing. i don't know anything about it. anyone who has seen me dance could not imagine me salsa dancing.. i don't dance well as a couple.
tonight i for a 30 mile group ride, like i so every wednesday night. average speed was 19 mph.  we had some nice hills. we were hauling ass. it was a hammer fest, for sure. after, i ate dinner with a couple of the regulars. had a chicken burger. it was damn good stuff.
now i am home, and sleepy... till tomorrow.."

"event","I work in an office full of women.  It's called the sales department.  So my boss was in a bitchy mood all day long, and anytime I said anything at all to her, or asked her a question on things that I REALLY needed an answer on, she would snap at me.  I asked her if there was something I had done to piss her off, and she goes ""I just hate all men today.""  So I was like, ""What? Did you husband piss you off?""  ""No..""  ""Did the boss man (the owner) give you a hard time today?""  ""No...""   ""I'm just PMSng...""  ""No... Just men in general.. And you have the misfortune of being the only male in the office, so I have to take it out on you.""

Alright, ladies... Listen up.  You may think this is o.k. to do, and think that it's funny and that, because you're a woman, you can get away with saying things like that, but it really isn't all that funny.  Regardless of what you were raised to believe, or see on reality television, we guys certainly do have feelings.  I, for one, am TOO fucking nice to the people I work with.  I treat everyone as my equal.  I really don't appreciate being treated like I am inferior just to boost your feminist agenda.

Why?  Because if a male said something like that to a female in the work place, all hell would break loose, or he'd be written up for sexual harrassment.  

You want to be equal to men. You say you can do anything a man can do, which is simply not true, because a man can't do everything a woman can do, like, DUH, give birth!  

Just a little over a hundred years ago, women stayed at home and men ran the work place.  Now that places of work are sexually equal as far as staffing, you look for the quickest opportunity to bash us men.  If you don't like it, then leave! Quit! Don't bring your personal problems to work and take it out on the poor guy in the next cubical.  He's there earning a paying wage just like you.  

I'm sick of your feminist bullshit!"

 http://www.bikely.com/maps/bike-path/Rose-Hill-Loop

 The first lap kicked my ass, but by the 3rd lap, I had warmed up plenty and had a Powerbar gel.  Vanilla and Strawberry Banana are the best. :)

 I felt strong and had lots of energy by the 3rd lap and was spinning the hell out of the pedals and kept a high cadence and saved my legs for the two hills that make this training loop what it is - a leg ripper offer. 

 I felt great after the ride, but hungry.  I quickly burned up any food that was in my stomach.  I burned at least 1700 calories.

 I'm so glad daylight savings is back again and I can take advantage of rides after work without having to do it in the dark.  I should be back to rides at least 150 miles or more a week and lose the weight again.  My goal is to lose at least 10 more pounds than I did last season so I will be killing people on those hills.

"event","Yesterday was my first day giving up caffeine.  I have tried this a few times before, but this time it's for real.  No more caffeinated sodas and no more tea.  I have never been a coffee drinker, but as badly as I crave caffeine right now, I would gladly drink a heaping cup right now.. But, I won't.

 What spurred me into forsaking caffeine?  For one, it's a legalized drug. Nothing more.  How long should I allow myself to be a slave to the fix?  Secondly, the persistent insomnia.  Thirdly, caffeine is a diaeretic and therefore is not good for anyone who is athletic and needs to stay hydrated - it will leave you dehydrated instead.  Caffeine, however, has been shown to improve performance WHILE you're exercising, but that doesn't mean you should be overdosing on it.  Fourthly, caffeine has sexual side-effects.  Even though I may not being having sex right now with a lucky lady (LOL), there may come a time - hopefully soon!!!
 
 It all hot home for me on Monday when the scale read 210 lbs.  I don't think I have ever weighed this much before, and I vowed to #1 give up the sugary drinks and just drink straight water and #2 give up the caffeine that is making me lose a good night's sleep.  And I think part of my weight problem is a result of sleeplessness.

 So, just as I expected, the a-typical side-effect of caffeine withdrawal was a 5pm headache yesterday.  I was feeling very lethargic and finally had to take some aspirin about 10pm to at least lessen the severity of the headache.

 This morning I woke up with a slight headache and I felt so incredibly grawgy.  I just wanted to lay there so badly.  It was very hard getting up.  I stood in the showed half-asleep.  I drove to work half-asleep.  When I got to work, we had a morning meeting and a barely said a word at the meeting. I just sat there is a daze, staring off into blankness.  I was also moody and not feeling the urge to smile at all, which gave others in the meeting the presumption that I didn't care to be there.  After the meeting was over, I made up some excuse and told them I had to leave to meet some clients.  Instead, I came home and fell asleep..  I woke up a little before 5pm and told them I was on my way back and got there just as they were closing up.  The nap DID help, and I felt in a little better of a mood.

 So now, it seems like I am substituting the lack of caffeine with over-eating.  I have been drinking a lot of water, however, but I always feel the need to MUNCH.. I haven't touched a sugary drink, however, but that doesn't mean that my body won't adapt to carbohydrates I am taking in and then it will be madness all over again.

 Tomorrow I'll give my next report on caffeine withdrawal... God, I hope this doesn't go on too long!"

"event","I purchased a Maxtor One Touch 500 GB HD a few weeks ago and couldn't wait to get home and hook er up and start backing all my shit.  It was a super-easy install.  I have been very pleased with it thus far, even though it goes into hybernation mode (power-saving mode) and then takes up to 30 seconds to be detected by my XP-based system.  You can, however, choose the amount of time you want power-saving mode to occur, anywhere from 3 minutes to every 5 hours or NEVER.  I set it to NEVER because the drive became undectable today when I left my computer on, inadvertantly, when I grabbed my bicycle this morning and took advantage of a 40 mile ride on this rather mild day for January.

I did my ride, felt great, was very happy... Then, I jumped on my computer to do my nightly internetting ritual, and was about to toss in some MP3s when I noticed that my F: drive, which was the Maxtor external HD, was not being recognized.  I expected this, however, since it does that upon first going into MY COMPUTER and takes up to 30 seconds to be recognized after hybernation mode.

However, this time it never detected it, and I started to panic.  I restarted my computer..  Same thing.. I went into the Maxtor Manager software.  I went into BACKUP and it said that it had to be set to a NTFS file system.  So, I went into the DRIVE INFO section and it showed the File System in several weird, unrecognized characters that looked like Chinese characters or something.  Not only that, but it said ""0"" space was available.

So, I went on Seagate's website (they bought our Maxtor), and looked through the troubleshooting sections.  I went into MSDOS and did a ""chkdsk"" on the drive, and it said that could not run chkdsk on a ""RAW"" drive. WTF is a RAW drive?  So, I Googled it, and it said it was a drive that was not formatted, but that I could use file salvage software to recover files off the drive before I formatted it..  ""Great,"" I thought.  Now I have to shell out money to recover my own damned files, and then I have to get the drive replaced and all that.. And if it happened once, it might happen again, so I was thinking, ""damn, where did I put that receipt?""

So I did more Googling on the Maxtor One Touch, and found several geek forums discussing the same issue.  A lot of them!  They all said to use chkdsk and it should work fine.  Well, I ran chkdsk, and it didn't work and only spit out, ""Can't do it, asshole.  It's a RAW drive, so NYAH!""

Someone left a comment and said, ""plugging the drive into another USB works, too."" 

I was thinking, ""no way, it can't possibly be that easy.. I'm fucked."" 

So I did it just for fun, and turned on the computer, and low and behold IT DID WORK!  All 450 GB of free disk space were back, and all my files were still there, in all their glory.

Amazing how low tech solutions, like just turning it off and turning it on again, or in this case, ""plug it into something else"" solves the problem."

"event","Nearly 1.8 million federal employees will get an average 3.5% pay raise under an executive order President Bush has signed. 

My question is: when are the hard-working minimum wage class at the bottom of the job food chain going to get a pay raise? the minimum wage is a joke when you consider the sharp rise in living costs: transportation costs, food (which is at its heighest price level since 1990), lenders that are now more cautious than ever about approving loans unless you're pulling in a 6-digit figure and have immaculate credit; the list goes on. 

If things keep going the way they're going, there will eventually be a revolution in this county, and it might be on the same scale as the French revolution of 1789, especially when we see our government religiously agree on a pay raise for themselves every chance they get, while all the national issues, that continue to plague this country, go undecided.

"event","This ranks up near the top of STUPID ASS SHIT in a restaurant:

In the mood for some italian, I go into a Ledo's Pizza in Clinton, MD.  It's 5pm, the place is empty for all but 2 tables, but the Redskins/Dallas game is on.  I walk in and sit down at a table because nobody actually seats you. 

So I sit down at a table with a good view of the television, and a server comes up, doesn't even say hello, and starts wiping down my table while I am sitting there.  The asshole wipes crumbs and shit all over my lap.  To be honest, I didn't notice it was a dirty table.  So, as a gesture, I brush off my lap in front of him, and all he says is ""sorry, sir"" in a monotone voice.   I wanted to punch this asshole in the face.  I've never worked as a server in a restaurant, but even I would have realized that you ask whoever is sitting there if they wouldn't mind getting up so I can clean their table for them so they don't get shit all over them.  Kinda defeats the purpose, doesn't it?

To top it off, he and the other server argue over who is going to serve me.  I'm sitting there by myself and the girl comes over and asks, ""will you be dining alone this evening?""  I look around, and go, ""eyup.""  I can tell already this girl's IQ hovers somewhere around 60.

Then, while I'm eating, and the few other people who are there are eating as well, all the servers sit around watching television, which tells me that if they weren't being so lazy and ignorant of the customers, maybe the tables would have already been cleaned before someone came in and sat down.  I hate shit like this, and I notice a lot of servers who do it, and management doesn't seem to care.  There are a lot of things they could be doing, like actually WORKING: cleaning tables, vacuuming, sweeping, refilling stock and especially checking on customers ~ the list goes on. Instead they sit around while people's drinks go unfilled, or whatever else they might need goes ignored.  

I will not go back to a restaurant that does business like this, and they sure as hell better not expect a tip out of me.  

Have you ever noticed how a lot of restaurants clean their tables? Someone goes around, using the same cloth with no cleaner and no bucket of hot, soapy water anywhere in sight.  They wipe off the table-tops, but not the chairs or the seats.  They wipe all the shit off the table and deposit it onto the seats, and if they do clean the seats as well, they deposit it on the floor and leave it there.  

Amazing.. That's my ""STUPID SHIT"" for the day.  Join me next time when I'll talk about... Well, I'm sure something STUPID will happen."

"event","damn.. i haven't posted on this thing in ages.  is my life really so busy that i can't stop for 10 minutes and update my LJ?  not really... just been too busy singing loudly out of my bedroom window on a nightly basis.. seem to be going through my entire discog of <i>Mesh</i> CDs... what perfect music for despote hearts still burning in a meltbox of fiery animosity still clinging to the last breath...

so... i have managed to go vegetarian despite a few relapses ~ mainly because of convenience ~ the injestion of death through meat consumption... the first week was really hard, but i did it... after a week, i didn't miss meat ~ at least red meat... i can't look a greasy hamburger in the face without wincing in disgust.

until i can completely give up meat with no relapses for at least 6 months, i dare not think i can so easily go vegan... that would be the endeavor of a lifetime.. i love my cheeses.. one of my favorite things is a cheesy fresh spinach quesadilla with fresh salsa.. 

i have befriended veggies like never before... i would consider myself a semi-vegetarian at this point.. i am slowely weening myself off of meat... if i allow myself to get really hungry, that's when i might reach for a fish sandwhich.. 

i know some so-called vegetarians that eat fish or eat chicken and claim they are vegetarian because they abstain from red meat... that to me makes no sense whatsoever.. no, you either eat meat or you don't... 

i am a vegetarian in progress... so far, however, i have noticed that my energy has actually increased because i am eating more veggies and getting lots of vitamins and minerals in my system... if i want protein, all i need to do is mix some corn together with beans and i have instant pure protein... this is what native american's discovered -- if you mix corn with any legume, you end up with pure protein... so, beans rolled up a corn tortilla is a great choice.

it hasn't hindred my cycling by veggies being the center of my diet. since i love to eat, i am actually eating more now and still losing weight... 

work sucks... it's a love/hate thing.. i like that my days fly by at lightspeed ~ so much so that at times i am begging for more time!  stacks of paperwork have gradually been rising on my desk just as surely as global warming is frying dog's brains and there is no end in sight... i always say i'll come in over the weekend and catch up on things in the office, but i always end up over-sleeping or grabbing my bike and going for a 40 mile or so spin..  why would i want to be so anxious to return to the zombie nation of letterhead hell i call my job?  

right-brained and forced to live in a left-brained world.. hell would be a better place at this point."

"event","I'm perplexed by the amount of fools who end up occupying higher positions in the work place.  Did these people get there by being smart, or more so for being stupid enough to accept those positions in the first place?  Do CEOs and business owners purposely look for the ones who are gullible enough to think that working in a higher position is better for them?  Maybe they do make more money, but do they have the time to SPEND it if they have sold their souls to their jobs, neglecting their obligations to their personal lives, like family, or their own endeavors.  Me, I cannot work in a position that requires me to spend anymore of my personal time than I have to.  I am a right-brained man trapped in a left-brained world.  Again, numbers are my arch nemesis.  The only programming language I have thus been able to grapple is HTML, and that was over 10 years ago. I work in sales.  It's one of the least respected jobs you can possibly have, because people automatically assume that you are a born liar and a slime-ball. 
A matter of fact, the same employees that don't work in sales at my company depend on the sales people to bring them the work, because they get paid by the hour. However, they can often be overheard referring to the sales people as the scum of humanity.   When I deal with my clients, they immediately approach me with shields up, like the Starship Enterprise on rendezvous with Klingon warships.  They look for any reason to suspect that I am ripping them off, when actually I am trying to get them a bargain because I'm a bargain hunter myself.  
I mean, look at my last post.  I provided a list of condiments you can get for free from your local unfriendly food chains.  

I see no point in rising through the ranks only to sell more pieces of my soul, and to have less time to spend all of that extra money that I'd be making.  Retirement, you say?  OK, first of all, they are raising the minimum age for retirement with each generation.  If the average lifespan of an American male is about 73 years old, you may have 2 or 3 years to live in retirement before you croak.  So what is the fucking difference?  Also, the future looks bleak.  Who, in my age group (mid 30s) honestly thinks that the human race will even be around in another 30 to 35 years?  

We're all polishing brass on the Titanic, I tell you.  So slow down and live for today.  Let those marauding SUVs tailgate you and zoom down the highway to the future; to global meltdown; cus no matter what speed you live your life, we'll all end up getting THERE on time, for front row seats to mass destruction."

"event","This is a list of the many things which I can acquire for free from my local, unfriendly fast food joints:

<ul>
<li>Ketchup. Why are you still buying ketchup when you can top off your bag with at least a few good pounds of ketchup packets?
<li>Mustard
<li>Honey.  It's expensive! I can get all the honey packets I need at my local Chik-Fil-A, and it's the good kind, too.
<li>Mayonaise. Your choice of light or regular.
<li>Plastic utencils; already wrapped in cellophane. Use em for your take to work lunches. 
<li>Jelly. Your choice of grape or strawberry. My local Bob Evans has the gourmet jellies in some really yummy flavors.
<li>Napkins. People may look at you funny when you grab a 6"" stack. Just tell them you're accident prone.
<li>Toilet paper. Yes, even toilet paper. Put back what you take, however, or they will catch on to you.  The method is to save your empty rolls and keep them in your book bag. Remove the full paper rolls from the dispenser and replace with empty rolls;  then they will just figure that someone had a massive bowel movement, and they'll simply refill and think nothing of it.  Try to alternate between different locations, however, to keep the suspicion under control.
<li>Drinks.  Why are you still paying for your soda, or iced tea, or coffee for that matter? The places that have the ""serve yourself"" fountains are the perfect targets, because no one will think anything of it when you walk up with their logo'd cup and fill er up.  Buy one drink, and that's it.  Save the cup. Stick it in your book bag, and keep a wide range of cups, depending on where you happen to go.  Example: at my local Panera, when they ask me if I want to buy a drink, I tell them I will just have a water. So they proceed to hand me this teeny-weeny plastic cup.  I take my food, sit down at my table, open my book bag and choose the Panera cup, make my way to the sweet tea dispenser and I'm good to go.  Panera is always busy, so they will never even notice you at the fountain in the first place. Did you know that it costs restaurants like McDonalds about 2 or 3 cents to make that cola for you? They spend more on the cup than the actual drink.  It only takes a minute amount of cola syrup to flavor an entire beverage. Don't believe me? Read up on the book, Fast Food Nation. Most of their profit comes from selling drinks because they reap over 100% in profit on that one drink. Corporations like these are content with ripping off the public and paying their workers shitty wages. Why should you have any sympathy about stealing from them? 
<li>Salt and pepper.  It's so easy to steal salt and pepper shakers, it's ridiculous. If it isn't so easy, you can always top off your bag with a pound of salt and pepper packets.
One time I stole a really nice rosewood pepper mill from a restaurant. Buy one of those in the store, and spend at least $20.00 ~ $30.00. 
<li>Vinegar.  My local 3 Guys Burgers & Fries has the bottles of malted vinegar that are perfect on fries and sandwiches.  The last time I was there, I stole a brand new unopened bottle. Tastes great in my recipes.
</ul>
This is all high-dollar stuff! Save some money on your next trip to the grocery store. Perfect for bachelors like myself!  Desperate times call for desperate measures."

Just another day at school in the good ol' USA.  We can't even find the solution to our own nation's epidemics, but we're in a foreign country on the other side of the planet promoting peace through occupation. Yeah, that makes a whole lot of sense.

Where are these kids getting guns from?  Maybe freedom of the press isn't such a great right when it seems that VIOLENCE gets more airtime than GOOD NEWS.  Have you noticed that every time you hear about another mass shooting, another one pops up somewhere else?  

I sometimes sit and wonder: how much different would the world be today if we 1) didn't publicize hate propaganda?  2) televise violence through both the real and fiction?  

What if everytime the 6 o'clock news came on, the first reports were those of good samaritans? What if those kinds of news reports were given the priority?

The more we give spotlight to human suffering, degradation, pornography and murderers, the more provocation you give to such practitioners.  Killing becomes a trophy when it subjugates your media through print, sound and picture, and those that wield such evil bask in the glow of the phosphorescent mushroom cloud that is consuming humanity.  

It already has, because we make excuses for ""why they do what they do.""  ""Oh, it's our fault. It's everybody's fault.""  Low wages, poverty, weren't raised right, had a drunk father who beat them, their parents didn't show them enough love.. etc, etc... 

Maybe that's not really it at all.  Maybe it's because we look for too many excuses.  While we are looking for excuses, more people are slaughtered, and our eyeballs are filled up with so much bloodshed that they are forced open, kind of like Clockwork Orange, and our eyeballs expect violence and uncertainty like caffeine in the morning.  We welcome this ulcer of the blood-gorged eye like an orgasm about to burst o'er the sunrise, painting everything in carnelian effigy.  Here lies the human race."

"event","Cycling highlights of the week...

<b>Monday 9/24:</b> 28 Miles //  Me and 3 other riders did the St. Peter's Church route that has become so popular on Monday evenings.  Supposed to be a recovery ride, but halfway through it bacame a race to get home before dark.

<b>Wednesday 9/26:</b> 25 Miles // Me and something like 8 or 9 other riders rode the LaPlata route to Budds Creek and back. Forgot the average, but I was doing 33 mph on some of the flat stretches and I won every sprint for the green town signs (about 5 in all)

<b>Saturday 9/29:</b> 53 Miles // Me and about 9 other riders rode from Wayson's Corner over to North Beach on the Chesapeake Bay and came back.  This was a leg breaker. Was feeling kind of sluggish, but managed to stay with the lead group, which quickly departed from the slower riders from the get go.  Lots of rolling hills and the heavy wind gusts were making for some serious headwinds.  Still ended with an average of 19.5 mph.  Not bad considering all the wind and the hills.

<b>Sunday 9/30:</b> 43 Miles // Me and 5 other riders rode the Nanjemoy and Doncaster. These are some of my favorite roads. Mostly shaded by trees and, little development and litterally no cars on about 10 miles of flat road. Weather was perfect! No humidity, no winds, mid 70s. Gorgeous.  Ending average around 18.7 mph. Legs still hurt from yesterday's grueling ride. 

<b>Sunday 9/30:</b> 16 Miles // Just a really slow pace, recovery ride to end out the weekend. Started at 5pm. Rode with about 5 other people. 

Ending mileage for the week: <b>165 Miles</b>

Alrighty then.. I'm tired.. Goodnight legs"

"event","I have decided to go vegan.  I am changing my ways.  I'm tired of all the animal cruelty at the hands of the food industry.  The more videos I see, the more I no longer want to support those crackas.  
I'm doing a lot of online research into the vegan diet.  I know that I am in for a long, hard road, because I will have to teach my body not to accept foods that I have grown up eating for the past 37 years.  Also, I need recipes!  So if any of you are vegan, or can appreciate vegetable dishes, please respond.  
What are some of your favorite things to eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner?

I am a big pasta lover, so are there certain pastas that I should abstain from?  I do like whole grain pasta.  It takes longer to cook, but the taste is rewarding and the energy it provides is more sustaining.

Help me out!"

"event","Parents who habitually take their kids to McDonalds might as well be feeding them a plate of nuclear waste.  I mean, I can understand every now and then, but as long as parents willingly sell their children's souls to Ronald McDonald and his posse, these kinds of restaurants (if you can call them that) will always be in business; the business of selling garbage.

If you really love your children, stop feeding them this kind of toxic waste. Don't you know that you are putting salt, cholesterol and fat into their little bodies so that they grow up to develop heart disease and high blood pressure? And who will they have to thank for that? You.  You who were too busy or lazy to actually cook a healthy meal at home and save them from the McDonald's Monster Machine, which eats little children's souls.

Just because you might have grown up with bad nutrition, doesn't mean you have to hand it down to your kids.  Love them enough to feed them wholesome, healthy foods.  

If you want to treat them to junk food, at least limit it to, what, maybe once a month?  

Lie to them about Santa Claus, but at least spare them the lie of Ronnie McDonald and his merry band.  As long as you prostitute your children to McDonalds, we will continue to have our landscapes marred by the malicious graffiti of the yellow M.  It's not o.k. to spray-paint your initials on the public landscape, but it's o.k. for McDonalds to erect their arches on practically every street corner in small towns and in big cities.  

Toss your babies into the McFurnace.. Fan the flames.. Continue to see cheap labor and poor working conditions along with unclean dining areas that invite houseflies, rats and disease to dine along with you.  You may not always seem them, but they're there.

Continue to be dehumanized by minimum wage laborers who just don't give a shit.  Who pride themselves on giving you bad service, and providing you with stale food.  God knows they wouldn't eat the shit that they're serving you.  Why should you?"

"event","Someone on my friend's list recently brought up the Atkins Diet and dispelled its myths.  
As I told her, diets like the Atkins Diet are for people who are sedentary, or are so busy that they can't find the time to exercise.  People who sit down a lot, or commute by car to the city and spend upwards of 2 to 3 hours sitting in traffic would be likely candidates.  

People who don't like working out because it might hurt, or they might actually sweat would be likely candidates.

The drawbacks to such a diet is that you give up food groups that are required for optimal health.  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BAD FOODS, JUST BAD DIETS.  That is my motto, and I am sticking with it.

Your body requires vitamins, macro-minerals (required in large quantities) and micro-minerals (ie: trace minerals that are only needed in small amounts for a healthy existence).

The only way you are going to get all of that is to eat from all your food groups and not the same foods all the time.  

This DOES NOT MEAN you get to eat the 6"" stack of pancakes slathered in syrup or something like a Wendy's Triple cheeseburger with the super-size fries, even if they do use trans-fat free oil.  It simply means that you can eat whatever you want in the right portion.

If you LIKE to workout, like I do, and are in a BAD MOOD if you didn't get a chance to work out today, then your pallet knows no limits.  If you're athletic, you need carbohydrates. You need calories.  You need salt.  You can get away with eating pastas and breads.  

So long as you're actually burning more calories than you take in per week, you have nothing to worry about.  Life is short. Why spend it eating the same foods for the sake of losing lbs?  Go for the high intensity workouts.  Sweat!  And you'll see improvement.  

Here is an excerpt from one of my cycling newsletters that sums it all up nice and easy for you to understand:

""In order for you to lose weight, your net <u>daily</u> caloric expenditure must exceed your intake. To lose one pound of fat, you have to have a deficit of 3,500 calories. Therefore, in order to lose one pound a week, you have to burn 500 more calories <u>daily</u> than you take in.
 
A relevant diet question is this: Do those calories come at the expense of glycogen [primary muscle fuel] or fat stores?
 
If you have relatively unlimited time, a day with a four-hour low-intensity ride will burn the same number of calories as a day with a two-hour high-intensity ride: 3,000 total calories (2,000 calories for the activity and 1,000 calories for basal metabolism). If you do this every day of the week, and if you ingest just 2,500 daily calories, the deficit of 500 calories will contribute to an average weight loss of one pound a week.
 
A 2,500-calorie a day diet that is 65% carbohydrate will provide 1,625 calories toward glycogen replacement. A 40% carbohydrate diet will provide only 1,000 calories of carbohydrate.
 
If you eat a high-carbohydrate diet, you will be able to better replace your glycogen, and you will be able to train day after day. If you do not, your glycogen tank will not be filled. After a few days you won't be able to train at as high an intensity level, and you'll run out of high-performance energy -- glycogen. You will have to train more slowly and longer to lose as much fat.
 
The moral is this: If your time is limited, within the limits of your overall training program, ride hard and eat a high-carbohydrate diet."""

"event","And two more to go.  Did the <a href=""http://www.abrtcycling.com/events/BCC/default.php"">Bay Country Century</a> last Saturday.. It went all over Calvert County, MD.  Some gorgeous scenery was to be had, especially of the bay.  I rode with a few friends of mine, and it was their first century.  Granted, they are not in the same class as I am, but give them another year and they should be able to keep up.  That said, I rode at their pace and it took pretty much all day, but I was proud of them for doing it. 

Today, however, was a different story.  I did the <a href=""http://ohbike.org/century/"">Southern Maryland Century</a> and had my best time, yet.  I did the 100 miles in 5 hours and 6 mins.  Ending average speed was 19.7 mph.  
I started with a group of guys with the same cycling team I am with, but they are cat 3 and cat 4 racers, so they showed no mercy.  For the first 27 or so miles of the ride, we had an average speed of 22 mph.. Doing about 25 mph on the flats, and at times, a little higher.
After the first rest stop, where we refueled and topped off our bottles, we got back on the road and I immediately dropped back with another guy who was on a single speed (crazy fool). He was part of the team, and I didn't want to just leave him behind, so I tried to pull for him after the hills where he was really struggling.  I had a goal to finish today in 5 hours or less, so when we regrouped with the other guys at the second rest stop, I grabbed one sandwhich, filled my bottles and left with them.  He was really slowing me down, so I told him I was leaving with the lead group and he could come if he wanted, but he decided to stay and rest a little longer.  Can't blame him.

So I stay with the lead group for a while, until we started getting into some hills, especially a particularly steep one where I eventually got dropped.  One of the guys in their group also cracked, and he and I rode for a few miles until he just couldn't stay with me and by the time I knew it, he was out of sight.  I didn't wait for him and kept pedaling on.  

I eventually got to the 3rd and final rest stop at mile 75 and regrouped with the leaders again.  This time they rested a little while longer giving me the opportunity to grab more food and drink because I was dehydrated at that point. I had stopped sweating.  Not good.
At the 3rd rest stop, the event coordinators told us we were the first of 100 milers to arrive, so that was encouraging.

We left the stop and had only 25 more miles to go.  We got to another climb and I staye d with them all the way up the hills, but when I got to the top, my legs just had to rest, and my heart rate was in the 180s.  They passed me and they gradually got too far ahead of me to even try to get back up with them, so I finally relegated myself to just keeping my own pace and conserving whatever energy I had left, which wasn't much.  Still, I was passing other riders, especially on the hills.  

Finally I finished.  I wasn't the only one who got dropped.. A number of them got dropped in that last quarter of the ride.  Only two of them crossed the line at 4 hours and 35 mins.  The rest trickled in about 10 mins apart.  

But, I am proud of myself.  Last year it took me 6 hours and 17 mins.  I have come a long way.  Two more centuries for this month, so I aim to beat my time today. :)"

"event","I have noticed an attribute among many successful people: they like to talk.  They are good story-tellers.  They have no phobias about being center-stage.  I, on the other hand, am one of those ""uh huh... yeah... really?  oh wow."" kinds of people.  I am a listener, but not a good one.  My attention span is very limited.  I have been that way since I was a kid.

I deal with a lot of business owners and entrepreneurs on a daily basis because I work in sales.  Each meeting eventually turns into general chatter outside the borders of business,
and each time it's they who are telling me a story about this, that or the other.  They will go on and on forever if you let them.  I wish that I was that way.  I am too delicate when it comes to opening my mouth.  When I have a story to tell, the sequence of the events is scattered.  I also pause too many times within statements, instead of saying it flat out.  

This makes me a piss-poor public speaker.  Whenever I have to go up in front of a bunch of people, I panic and start shaking.  Some people get the shakes when they speak in front of a mass of people, even people they've known for a long time or work with every day.  Yet, I shake nervously and it is very evident.  My head shakes; my arms shake; everything shakes.

I think one of the keys to being successful is being able to dominate a conversation.  I have never been good at that.  I am quite content sitting behind a keyboard and typing at this submissive monitor illuminating my face in its phosphorescent glow, kindling me with its non-threatening nature.  

I don't know how to mesmerize people or attain their interest.  It's not in my language to do so.  So, I guess I will just remain content at the bottom of my teacup, diorama of my unkempt kingdom, screaming from its dry seabed, self-exiled politely in the body armor of my own tailoring."

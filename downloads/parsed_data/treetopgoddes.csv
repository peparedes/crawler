<P>I now have not one kittens, but 2... Dan is the best. They are sisters and they are both adorable. They are still getting used to each other for now though, since they havent seen each other in months, and mine (Fidget) has been without other animal companionship for about 3-4 months now. And she's spoiled rotten... Oh well.. What are pets for, right? Well, anyways. So the kitties are in the living room duking it out, so I came in here, to get away. They hiss and spit and bite at each other and I can't stand watching it, but I know that they need to do it to start getting used to each other. &gt;Sighs&lt;</P>
<P>Dan and I are doing very well. Fantastic in fact. We just went to the Rennasaince Festival alone together on Saturday. It was so much fun! But OH MAN was I tired as hell that night. While we were there, we ate ourselves silly, got heckled by the hecklers (Dan wore his ""My kung foo is <STRONG><U>very</U></STRONG> strong"" shirt and that got him some laughs), and I bought something so stupid and sentimental...&nbsp; I LOVE IT!&nbsp; It was one of those booths where they can write whatever you want on a piece of rice&nbsp; and then they stick it in this little vile and seal it up and you can put it on a necklace chain or a bracelet or.. whatever. I got one made that said ""Tree"" and ""Dan"" on it and in between the 2 names, it had two little linked hearts... Awwwww.... ;)</P>
<P>Well, its way fuckin' early and I'm still tired but can't sleep anymore. I think I'll go and see if those 2 kitties have killed each other yet, and maybe eat some breakfast! mmm... toast.</P>
<P>Love ya,</P>

"event","<P>Ok, so Dan and I officially decided on the when, where, and who of our wedding. It's going to be in Hawaii (which is something we've both wanted, but didnt know if it was doable); it's going to be on June 5th of 2006 (which is when we started dating &amp; also my parent's anniversary--they like the idea); and it's a ""Whomever CAN come is totally invited."" &lt;- If we are at least friends that is... ;)&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, but seriously, I am so excited, now we just need to start saving. HAH!! That will be nice and easy.... NOT!! But it is a must, so we will... I'm not getting married in some rinky dink Vegas room, but I do want to 'elope' --&gt; run away to get married... it's just going to be a type of thing where everyone <EM>knows</EM> that we are running away to get married.. :)&nbsp; well.... </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not much else. OOOH!! My mom and I may be working together.. I know, us together all of the time&nbsp;and getting along?! No way. But I totally think it'll work! Mom and I see things completely differently. That is why living together became so hard. But with different points of view, it's not likely we'll miss anything when doing 'projects' together at work.. you think?? I hope. I really do like the idea. I miss my mom and we only get to talk so much because we are so busy. But anyways, back to this job. It's the one I got all excited for a while ago, but nothing really came of it. Well, now they are starting to hire, cuz they are almost done with the move. So, my mom asked if family members were aloud to work together.. and they said that only 2 could. Well, hey that is just perfect, now isnt it? Well, and then my mom asked if I would be able to work there and what were my chances and what would I have to do and all that. I am going to have to take a week long class and then on that Saturday, I'd have to take a test. I end up shelling out almost $400 for it all, but then I'm licensed.. so.. not bad, huh? Then I'd be able to get a job as an assistant almost anywhere. So I have to do that but i'm going to have to be sure to make sure i have the job before i take a week off of work to go and do that, cuz if i'm not getting the job, i cant afford to spend that kind of money and then not get the job. so.&nbsp; but my mom said that they would most likely hire me anyways, and then they'd give me time to get the license. well.. i am going to a movie with my God-Mother, Yvonne tonight, so, anything else will have to wait until later.</P>"

"event","Well, after a day of working I actually feel much better. No really, I just went and sweat the sick right out of me. So now, I'm just tired as hell, but not so much sick. Good enough for me. I got my license plates today. So, now when I'm driving down the road, it looks like I actually OWN my car. WOOO...
    
     So on Friday, Dan and I lose our furniture. Bummer huh? Yeah, apparently there was a deal made when we got the couch that when Tony moved out, he could have them back. Hm... Well, from now on.... 'DEALS' NEED TO BE MADE WHILE THERESA IS PRESENT IF IT MAY INCLUDE HER OR HER LIFESTYLE!!!!!!!!!   Grrr... But done and done. Nothing to do but save hardcore for some new stuff.. Hopefully Dan will be able to get that credit card he applied for, then we'd get all new furniture.. We already discussed what we'd get. So, I'm hopeful. 

     I just picked up the pictures of our kitty, Fidget. She is so damn cute. Well, I'm gonna go and take a short nap before my Daniel gets home.

"event","I have now been up since 3 o'clock in the friggin' morning. I feel so damn sick and I have to go and work outside all day. Fuck this. Dan like the air conditioning on while we sleep, so its on. but i get sick when its on. so i'm sick. he didnt know this before. well, when he woke up this morning and i was in the living room trying to sleep, he was concerned and now he feels bad. not my intention, but hey... no more air on at night. woo. 
     
    i should be getting ready for work right now, but i'm so fucking tired i cant even get outta my damn chair. and my kitty wouldnt let me be (as if i could sleep on the couch anyways). she's cute though. there seems to be something wrong with her leg... i feel really bad. we'll see how that ends up. blahch. i feel so .... well..... blahch. yep, thats about as good as it gets today. i hope keith gets to work with me in the yard again, then i'll have someone to talk to. he called me a goofball yesterday. and he decided that my nickname (since everyone in that company has one) should be hotrod. just cuz everytime the forklift would get stuck i'd gone it to get it UNstuck. he thought that was pretty funny i guess.. *shrugs* whatevs.
    i dont wanna work today, but dan and i have to many damn bill it is making me so stressed out.
    
    my hair is getting hella long. i need it cut so bad. but i'm waiting until we are laid off for the winter, cuz then i'll be able to leave it down. and actually DO something with it everyday. meh. 
 
    BLAHCK!!!!   i feel so fuckin' crappy. one side of my head is all stuffed up, so i can only breathe through one nostril and my respiratory system is kicking my ASS!!!  well.... i need to leave in 15 minutes now, so maybe i should try to get my ass outta these P.J.s, even though i'll prolly just fall asleep on the way to work and crash my brand new fucking  car. i love my car. mmmmm.. new car.. that makes me feel a little bit better. 

    alright... here i go.

and i'm off

ok now.....                                nope, not yet.

"event","So, more good news. I GOT A CAR. Not just any car, either. I got my lancer. And its Brand New!! 2004 Mitsubishi Lancer ES. I drove it off of the lot with 6 miles on it! I am still so excited. I got it about 5 days ago and I had to bring it in to get cruise control put into it, and I already got it back. So, I've got my car WITH cruise control, and its pretty and new! I am so freakin' excited! I love this car!!! I've wanted a Lancer since 11th grade, but i thought they'd stopped making them. You see, Dodge made them for 3 years or so, then they sold the rights to the car makings (<- I'm SO technical) to Mitsubishi later on, so now its this cute looking little space machine! I got my OWN space machine. BOO YAH to all who now what that means! :)  
    So, now i'm out crusin' in my New car, adn i come home to my new kitty, and this october, dan and i may be moving into a different (new) apartment. We just dont need this much room! Plus we want a 3rd level apt. So we are going to shoot for the 2 bedroom NOT on the corner. still need 2 rooms though! LOL. <- yeah, i know... nerd. oh well. what can i say? i'm ok with it i suppose. well, time for work.

"event","Today was a slow day at work so I got to come home VERY early. Not too shabby I think. Dan will prolly be at work until 6-630, so I'm stuck here by myself with Fidget until then. Oh well, I'll get by I think. 

I need to go to the library and get a couple more books. I've read all the books in the apartment and now I have nothing to read. And that is what I do when Dan is playing NWN. Lately I've been just watching TV and that gets SO old SO quickly. OH!!! I won a prize pack off of the radio the other day! Can you believe it? I won on the radio! I was at work driving home from.... somewhere.. and on the station I was listening to, the announcer was saying 'call now and win this amazing prize! You get to go and see the pre-screening of CatWoman with four tickets and you get 4 free subs from subway!'. well, I was QUITE hungary just then and I wanted to win the damn subway so i called. No one, well not me, ever wins those things, right? WRONG!! I WON! it was so cool! it rang and the guy was like 'k102, you are caller 22..' i almost peed my pants, well... not really. but i was shocked! it was pretty sweetl. but now, damon has to work and most likely tincher has to work, so instead of taking allan and damon, or allan and tincher, we are most likely going to take my mom and dad. which is still ok, but i'm kinda bummed that most of our friends work at night all the time. well... thats it for now... i get to go and pick up chinese food!

"event","So, Dan and I got our kitten. She is adorable and we named her Fidget. She plays a little bit rough with me, I've got scraches and stuff all over my arms and legs. I love her though. Except I think she likes Dan a lot more. He keeps on telling me and told me before we got her that she is MY cat, but I really think she is Dan's. She just likes him more. And she doesnt try to chew the flesh off of his bones. Hm. I guess she'll grow out of that (hopefully). She's soo funny though. The other day she kept sucking on my earlobe while she was sleeping and if I pulled my head away she move right along with me. We are pretty sure she thinks she's still with her mama when she does that. Too Funny though. Dan got a picture of her doing it. 

It was a lot nicer out today then it was yesterday. Except I had to go to fuckin' fairmont today. 6 hours there and back. SUCK! Oh well.. paid to drive....

I was thinking.. I'm going to keep this job through the summer, and then collect unemployment with Dan this winter. We'll be making about the same amount then, cuz I started working in January so our incomes should be pretty close. So while we are being nice and comfy and lazy all winter, I will be looking for a new job and hopefully with the couple of months to devote to that I should have a pretty good job lined up. Otherwise, Come spring time again, I'm going to be applying for a Laborers position, cuz #1: I will never be a parts runner again & #2: they make twice as much as runners & #3: I will be able to have insurance. Good plan I think. I just hope I dont get sick until then. That is the part of the plan that sucks.. NO INSURANCE.... I hate not haveing health insurance. It makes me very uncomfortable. Oh well.. Cant do too much about it. I'm goig to go and cuddle with Fidget now and hope she doesnt chew on me too much."

"event","<P>Ok, so today was alright. Way too hot though. and i HATE this stupid job! I""m tired of driving every damn day, people on the road are retarded! Oh well, I should be happy that I've got a job i suppose. Hm, I called Nici today, she seemed .. I dont know, she was acting alittle bit wierd. She said that it was because she's tired of looking fo jobs and not finding anything, I suppose that would frustrate me too, but she didnt seem frustrated, more.... down, i suppose. I dont know. Whatever it is, I hope she feels better soon. So, Dan is going with the guys to Florida in August. *sighs* I wanna go, but I WILL NOT have the money, and if i did, I would put it towards a car instead. i wish i would win the lottery. or just a couple thousand dollars,&nbsp; you know? It would help so much. It isnt necessary, but it would help. I'd get a new car, we'd pay off dans car... things would be awesome. oh well, wishful thinking. hm... i am so tired from today, i dont even have the energy to go and take a shower just yet.. i need.. i dont know what i need. i do hope that dan gets home soon, though. he always makes my bad days better, even though i'm usually crabby and he gets the brunt of it. i love him so much. oh and he's going up north with corey and them this weekend, i might go with, it depends on whether or not coreys girlfriend Jill goes with. if she goes, then i'll go. but if she doesnt then it will just be guys weekend. and i'll be left alone all weekend, scary. i dont like being here alone... it freaks me out. maybe, if i dont go, i'll ask damon to spend the weekend over here, cuz he cant go either, cuz he has to work.. maybe.. i'll ask dan if its ok, then... we'll just have to wait and see how things go down. hopefully dan will be home intime to pick up my parents at the airport.. if he's not it isnt a big deal, cuz i have their van, but i'd like him to come with. we'll have to wait and see on that one too. someone has been using my credit union bank account. there is a charge from the internet on it a couple of times and i havent even used the account in over a month.... so i went and payed the stupid overdrawn fee and then closed all the accounts there.. it sucked. i kinda liked that bank, but now i'm back to stupid TCF.. grr. i cant stand all the fees they tellyou they DONT have. well, they do.. and there is nothign you can do about them. bah hum bug. oh well.. done and taken care off. dan and i were supposed to get our checks in the mail today, but i checked it and they werent in there. i hope the mail guy is just late, cuz we need those to see to our rent. wow,, i'm super tired now. i think i'll go take a quick shower so that i'm at least awake when my daniel gets home.. hm... well g'nite!</P>

"event","<P>So today, Dan and I went to Olive Garden and ate. I thought it was very good but Dan didnt like what he had. I felt bad. But the bread sticks were awesome, so it panned out. Now, we are going swimming here in a few minutes. I hope the pool doesnt have too many people in it. I actually hope there isnt anyone in it. But one can <EM>only</EM> hope. So, onto other things. I'm kinda worried/bummed about something. I dont really want to get into it much quite yet, but... lets just say, I hate being right. OH! And... Sarah- yeah you, you ho-bag.. since you are apparently so very interested in mylife (even though you deny it constantly) you should probably know this:&nbsp; If you keepshooting your mouth off about me, you are going to be a very unhappy girl. Understand? If all youhave is words- that you cant even say to ME -then you have nothing. So just knock it off before you hurt yourself alright? You putting down my life and the way that I handle things doesnt make you look any better. Nor does it make you look any more mature. So before you make your next comment about me, please... remember this: YOU are the one with all the therapy; YOU are the one taking the <EM>psycho-pills</EM>; YOU are the one whocant keep a boyfriend beCAUSE of that certain 'psycho' quality you have ( and trust me.. I know. I have talked to a couple of your ""lovers""= Jerry &amp; obviously the one whom I've had that 'over-the-top' relationship with Damon). So, sweety, before you bad mouth others... it's wise to take a good long look at your own life and the direction its taking. Sickness only covers up the psycho-babble for solong.</P>
<P>Ahhhh.. Feel better now. So back to my very rich life. After my momentary lapse in what some call 'poor-me' Land, I'm back now. And so much better because of it. If Amanda is too busy for me, then she is just too busy for me. That is all. It hurt, but now I'm over it. I have so many other friends and family and others who love me somuch more that ..... I shouldnt dwell on what I dont have. I have a wonderful family who, while not perfect, does their very damn best to do what is good and right by me and my brother and anyone else involved. I have the most beautiful friends anyone could ask for. Nici, Damon, Allan, Tincher and everyone else.... I'm greatful &amp; lucky to have each and every one of you! And I'm lucky enough to have found the love of my whole life in only a few tries. I do know how lucky I am and I thank God for it each day. Dan is the best person I've ever known, and I'm the lucky girl who caught him!&nbsp;&nbsp; :)</P>
<P>Well, Tony is here and now it is swim-time. I'm a happy girl and have a happy life..</P>

"event","<P>Today I got off of work pretty early, so I thought I'd clear things up a bit. The last entry was a total vent. I was feeling pretty shitty and everything I said in it is true, but I now know that.... It doesnt matter. What matters is the friends that I know are and will be true to me. Like Nici. You know, I've always thought of Nici as.... the 2nd best friend.. Not a fall back, never a fall back, that is not the type of friend I am. But the kind of friend whom knows me well enough to be the Best friend, but also has the inate sense to step back sometimes and do things with other people and lets me do the same without thinking I'm mad or that I hate her... (That is one of the things that frustrates me about a lot of people.)&nbsp; But, yeah, I came to the realization that... while I held these other people in a 'higher' position, if you will.. she has always been there for me and I've never thought on it much or worried much that she wouldn't be there.... because she just is.. always. I've never <EM>had</EM> to worry, because she is the best friend that i'm fretting about not having. I love you Nic... As far as Amanda goes. I dont even know what to think anymore.. and that's just the problem. I think that if she were to actually cal me up now and tel me she wanted to do something with me.... I'd be so ... I dont even know.. but iwouldnt go... not out of stubborn-ness, but because i would just be unhappy now. i dont really even want to care anymore. but since i apparently care about <EM><U>everyone on the planet</U></EM> i guess i'll just learn to live with it. and i will.. and as far as damon.. i dont know... the one who told me i was like a sister to him has <EM>really</EM> proven it.. he hasnt seen or talked to bri in how long now? i guess i shouldnt feel left out except for... oh yeah, she doesnt live in this STATE! but like i said i'm tired of worrying about something that does no good to worry about. </P>
<P>on another note.. the fire alarms went off in the hallway of our apartment building last night. everyone had to go out side and it was raining. i felt so bad for the family with 2 little girls.. they were so tired! i wished we still had those umbrellas in dan's car. or that there was more room in the car so they could come and sit in it with us. yeah, but..... it happened at 4o'clock this morning..&nbsp; and we didnt get back in the door until 530. but its ok.. cuz i'm so tired that my work told me i could go home rather than falling asleep at the wheel... :)&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>well i'm going to go and spend some time with my daniel.. who got rained out today so we <EM>both</EM> have the day off... WOOOO!!&nbsp; hehe.. </P>"

Amanda and i were talking and we agreed that the two of us could totally take her.. i mean we've both got shit on her.. and we both really dispise the person she is.. so yeah.. WE WIN!!! ahahhah.. so .. damon doesnt really know what to think of jerry and sarah... all he could really say was.. 'well i started to fix her for him.. he gets the good stuff now'.. that is such a sad thing to think of. poor damon. love that boy. not like dan love, but.. damon love. cant explain it very well.. oh well.. damon and i get it. thats all that matters. so my little brother..hes in a lodging type of treatment. so hopefully that will help. and i told him that he is welcome over ANY time when he gets out.. he liked that.. so.. and he said that he WANTED to get away from his friends.. i think that is progression right there... hopes up.. *sighs* i think i'm tired now... that felt good getting that all out!"

"event","wow.. so dan and his friends are sitting in the other room playing magic and i am just dinkin' around on the 'puter. i have applied to 2-3 jobs in the last hour and now i have nothing to do. well i could do plenty of things but nothing that really catches my attention. when ever i think of something to write, my mind always goes back to my little brother. he really does want to try and improve his life, but he doesnt want to have to lave the only friends he's  known. i can understand that. but.. seeing him throw his life away just makes me cry. we dont even have any control over it. all we can do anymore is sit back and hope to God that he doesnt screw up. everytime i talk to him i make a point to tell him that i love him before i leave. i think he likes to hear it, cuz he says it back. he never used to. it was sort of a ""Awww, Theres...."" kind of thing.. now he says it back.. almost as soon as its out ofmymouth. he was on the phone with his girl-friend last night and i was leaving from stopping at my 'rents house for a visit. i stopped in to tell him i was leaving and to say goodbye. i said 'goodbye jo-jo.. love you' and he actuallly stopped talking to heather to turn, look at me and say 'i love you too theres, g'bye'... i love my little brother, with all of the heart i have... he is my only brother and i dont know what i'd do if i didnt have him in my life.. i hope and i pray constantly for him to turn his life around and make it better for himself.. cuz he is the only one who can make that choice. he has to make the choice and stick  with it. >sighs< 

well, that helped.. i cant stop thinkin' about him.. so.... 

also, i have GOT to get a new f***ing job. i cannot stand working here anymore. and now connie has an interview in the morning, so... errr..  if she isnt there to save me from insanity then i have to leave IMMEDIATELY... yep.. i have to go.. now.. but i did apply at like 3 places today.  so.. hopefully... yeah
well.. i'm pissed now.. somebody spilt red kool-aid all over a white carpet..i have to clean it up.. good bye."

"event","So, Damon and I went and saw The Passion of the Christ last night while the rest of the guys went go kart racing. The movie is so gruesome. I think it may be the worst movie i've ever seen. Not the story or the meaning, but the whole.. i am watching this man being beat for 2 hours. It was the most heart wrenching thing i have eer seen in my life, i think. and that coming from a movie.. i dont know. the fact that all this happened to a man.. for real.. whether you believe in the hwole Jesus thing or not, it is a historical fact that A MAN went thorugh all of that and that is what is terrible to me. I believe in God, Jesus, the whole works, you know.. but from a stnad point of.. ""A man endured all of this pain for no 'aparent' reason"" ... it his heart breaking. i know that that is prolly the message they were trying to get across, and they did just fine. but.. it made me feel the need to come home and watch something funny and get a great big hug from my daniel. i dont know. but it is time for me to go to work now, so i'm outta here."

"event","Writing in a journal has always been so easy for me.. Yet, the minute i sit down at the computer, i blank. I guess i'll just start at the beginning.... I am happy. As happy as anyone could be at this point in life. I am engaged to a VERY good guy.. I have been befriended my another VERY good guy, and I live in an apartment with said fiance. What more could i ask for? 
     My Fiance: dan... he is such a good person. a few quirks, but who doesnt have them? he's definitely a nerd.. but nerds rock, so i'm cool with that. in high school, i was one of those people who would see a group of 'nerds' ( you know, chatting about how much RAM one's got.. and what new role playing game is out, and all those things.. ) and i would either chuckle to myself or look at the wall or my feet as i walked by them.. but oh how little i knew!! these so-called 'nerds'.. they are totally cool! love them all! and now, i'm going to live the rest of my life with one of the biggest nerds i know! funny how life goes! :)  well, dan has helped me through a lot of my life. the X, i will call him, was a bastard.. not a great person for me to be with and dan, being the quiet, shy, wonderful friend that he was, would let me come to his house and cry on his shoulder about the X. and when i figured out what i was missing hanging with the loser, it opened my eyes to dan.. he was sweet smart sensitive, cared about my feelings, all the things that... well, the X should have been taking care of for me. well, it was time to move on.. 2 years with a bastard like the X was definitely enough!!  so dan and i were super close and it just seemed right. and now.. here we are.. almost 2 years later.. and barely any fighting to speak of.. well, not nearly as much as it COULD be.. i'm happy, he's happy.. we are set... like i said.. everyone's got quirks.. we are okay with that...
     My SUPER FRIEND: damon... also a good person. havent found a quirk yet. i'm sure he's got one though.. he's a good person for venting.. for nearly all of my friends, i am the one to vent TO... and when I truly need someone, i'm at a loss,  cuz they just want to talk about themselves.. very bad deal for me. i'm ok with helping my friends, just need some time to do a little venting myself you know? well.. like i said, damon: perfect for this.. among other things.. wink, wink.jk i'm totally faithful to my Daniel, but that joking nature between damon and i has gotten us into some serious trouble with his X. she freaked cuz she thought there was something between us. well there is something between us you twit.. FRIENDSHIP. oh well, old news.. i just dont really believe in posting away messages that spar at people.. its childish when you dont give them a chance to fight back.. me? i will spar in HOPES of one sparring back.. i'm always ready for the fight. but her? nope... she shies away at the moment of truth.. spineless.. but thats ok. that is over and done with. i know that damon is lonely still tho.. i just wish he was a little more outgoing with the ladies. my other friend, allan, him too.. he's awesome, but he wont let anyone see it.. so sad.. two of the best men i've ever met..and no one will EVER know.. 
     My BEST friend:  amanda... she's gone all the time. it makes me super sad.. i know she's busy, but i'm busy and i make time for my friends. but i guess it goes both ways.. i havent quite called her a bunch lately either, i guess i just feel tired of trying so hard.. it took me two years to get her back from joe and now i'm loseing her to.. well.. growing up. bummer.. i just miss her like crazy. absolutely the best person i've ever met. even if i dont get to see her and even if she does change a little bit.. she'll always be my manda. love you sweety.
     My.... well... corey... >sighs< i just dont know about him anymore. i'm losing him. we are all losing him. we miss him too. but its not cuz he's busy, or bcuz of a girl or anything like that.. he's changed beyond most recognition. he's become a different person and we just want the old corey back.. he says he doesnt notice, but its SO drastic  to us.. how can he not notice??? i just dont know what to do or how to handle this. i dont know if i should ACT like his changing bugs me.. or if ..  dont know.. dan(corey is also his best friend) says that he's just going to try and ignore it and hope it fixes itself..  i dont know if i can do that.. i am not one to sit back and HOPE for something to happen. i just dont know what to do anymore.. f***ing army. <- no disrespect meant
     My family... my parents are awesome.. i would not be where i am today if it werent for all of their nagging throughout my childhood... thanks to them i am a normal (i think) human girl, with no addictions, no traumas, no problems. love them dearly. my little brother on the other hand.. he's having a rough time of it. dont really know what to do with him either.. bad friends, bad drugs, bad attitude, and almost 18 to boot... we lose him to 'adult-hood' soon.. how can it be that one who still doesnt know anything... about life and what it is going to do to him in the real world... is considered an adult in less than a year??? and its not like my parents are just sitting there and watching him do all of this. they tried special schools, special teachers, treatment, all this shit does nothing for him.. no.. it doesnt fail him.. he doesnt WANT it.. he doesnt want anything... we dont know how to make him understand.. he is just going to end up one of those people you look at and think ""my god.. what the hell happened to him? what  a   loser...."" how sad is that?!?!? my little brother.. not graduating (possibly) going to jail (probably) and never even bothering to THINK that maybe... just maybe.. we were right.. i love my little brother with all my heart. as do my parents.. but what more isthere for us to do for him?? i just dont know... i guess i'm going to have to suck it up and HOPE this time... i hate this shit so much!
     Well, for a first entry i guess it wasnt so hard. i'm still not used to it, and its still quite a bit.... held back, but.. hey.. its public.. people dont need to know EVERYTHING, right?? HAHAHA right."

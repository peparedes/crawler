and i really miss doing it

every now and then i put my skates on and just roll around for fun
and some times i watch this video of me skating (which was the last time i skated) were i jumped off a roof and did some runs wit my friends over at Southern Polly Tech

anywho i scanned some pics in for u guys to see 
some of u have seen them before so nothing new

This one is one of favs.  i like the background. i even remeber what day it was.  Jan. 1, 2000
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v72/optionzero/ar1.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

<lj-cut text=more here>

this one was late at night after my friend Hugh (who was a skateboarder) 
was scared to board slide that rail so i put my shoes on grabed his skateboard and did it after some trys just to show that i could do it
sad thing is now there r nubs on those rails  :(
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v72/optionzero/fudbw.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Me jumping a gap from some parking lot into Roswell rd. dont worry we had ppl in the streets looking out for cars
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v72/optionzero/jrgap.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

me falling and yes it probly hurt
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v72/optionzero/falling.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">


now thats how its done
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v72/optionzero/fallingnot.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">


this trick was the shit back in the day.  it had 3 names.  Sidewalk or Darkside/Darkslide 
and that rail was really long 
longest one me and my friends have done
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v72/optionzero/darkside.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">


and a side view of that rail

i thought ok maybe it wasnt anything important
but it was 
it was my clutch or thats what i think
iv been having problems wit it so im going to say thats what it is

my car wont go in to gear (when the car is on) and when i start it in gear it wants to go forward as if the clutch wasnt all the way down then stalls out

so back to the shop and no more spending money :(

"event","they put on an awesome show!!!!
and they r all about the fans which is awesome

all the bands that played were realy good 
the line up: AutoPilot Off, Letter Kills, My Chemical Romance, Story of the Year.

Letter Kills was really good the sing  Matt Shelton  was throwing the mic around like crazy swinging it and catching it and he even busted his ass.

Now Story of the Year was just amazing 
Dan Marsala jumped out into the crowd and i was like right there 
i grabbed his arm
he was so close to me

any who i had a great time and all the bands were awesome
there r so many other stories to tell about what went on at the show but i dont feel like typing all of it
so peace out kids and stay true"

ill will give u guys a list a names that ill respond to 

1. Omega Turbo- yes its the name of my 2nd guitar and it will also be my new name.  ""Le-go my Ome-go"" great line that me and Jordan made up while at media play looking at the DVDs

2. Turbo- short for Omega Turbo

3. Omega Gun- cuz i just made it up

4. Revolver Ocelot- ya sounds cool nuff said

5. Danger- i was never given a middle name so i made one up til i find out how to get a name change so i can have a middle name, but lets say i do. so when im walking down the street and and see me ur not going to say ""sup Berto"".  no ur going to say ""whats going down Danger? fight any evil doers today?""  cuz i do that kind of stuff.

6. Cookie- one day i was at Dairy Queen and i wanted to order a small cookie dough breez. well for some strange reason when i got to the word cookie my voice cracked so much that no other word would come out after i tryed to say cookie. ya funny i know, but i doesnt stop there.  it happened 4 times in a row! finial it came out and i got my small cooKIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  ya thats how it was.  so i told some friends from work my story  and one of them said ur nick name should be cookie so im cool with that.

7. Option Zero- its my DJ name well more like my music production name cuz i havent touch the turntables in a long time.

8. Dr. Ill Skill-  my old DJ name. yes i will respond to it cuz it makes me sound like a doctor.

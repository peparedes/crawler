I messed up BAD, but today during youth group we were talking about anger, and I quote, 'dont let the sun go down on your anger' meaning dont go to bed angry. We also talked about not holding grudges adn hating people, yes I know I was wrong, i've apologized before, many times, I don't know what to do anymore, so I guess I should just give up, if she wants to forgive me, great, if not, oh well, im done waiting.
Someone got baptized today at church, it was so awesome, and now I cant wait to be baptized, it's going to be ana amazing expierience and it will change my life.

One word never hurt so bad. Heres how it goes stupid-ass, dont tell my friend you think its gross that I like you and expect her to not tell me, thats not how it works.. I know i'm ugly, I know i'm not too skinny, and I don't give a flaming fuck what other people care because I think it's okay, I may not be Tyra Banks but I have feeling, and shit still hurts. 

Why must people still insist on judging? said person.. ^ doesnt know jack shit about me other than what we rarely talked about.. church. Thats a big giveaway to 'said person' but I dont care, i'd say names, but thats rude, i'll leave you to figure this one out, its not hard. Theres only one place that is my safety net in my life, church, and now I feel uncomfortable when I go because of him, so I have.. nowhere to hide from chaos and drama, straight from the words of Who Am I, 'not because of who I am, but because of WHAT YOU'VE DONE, not because of what you've done, bout because of WHO YOU ARE' so i'm going to go turn on some music and scream until my lungs bleed.

BiPoLaRbEaR91: your really pissing me off
MoonSprite134: Ok
BiPoLaRbEaR91: just thought you should know were all pissed off at you
MoonSprite134: Thats nice
BiPoLaRbEaR91: not really
MoonSprite134: Well you do what you have to
BiPoLaRbEaR91: what the fuck are you talking about?
BiPoLaRbEaR91: you think im gunna fucking stab you in your sleep or somethimg?
MoonSprite134: I dont really care what you do
BiPoLaRbEaR91: bitch
MoonSprite134: Nice insult
BiPoLaRbEaR91: thans, lets see you do better than
BiPoLaRbEaR91: then**
BiPoLaRbEaR91: thanks**
MoonSprite134: Did you get that from your pothead sisters
BiPoLaRbEaR91: oh, sure did, but its funny, my sisters are cooler than yours ever will be, haha
BiPoLaRbEaR91: so i dont care if they are or arent potheads
MoonSprite134: I dont really care. I know my sisters arent cool. They're young, pure and innocent
BiPoLaRbEaR91: ha
MoonSprite134: They have not been touched by the likes of peer pressure, drugs and sex
BiPoLaRbEaR91: like you?
MoonSprite134: I know I am not pure
MoonSprite134: Nor am I innocent
BiPoLaRbEaR91: well, considering half the whores in our grade aren't virgins, you are innocne
BiPoLaRbEaR91: innocent**
MoonSprite134: That is true
BiPoLaRbEaR91: stop talking like your from the 1800s
MoonSprite134: If you're looking for an apology, you're looking in all the wrong places
BiPoLaRbEaR91: im not looking for an apology
BiPoLaRbEaR91: and i'm not exactly expecting one, considering im talking to you
MoonSprite134: Look. I didnt say them in order to have to go through all this trouble whats done is done and the fact that you're making a mountain of this molehill is really petty
BiPoLaRbEaR91: fuck you, you said some mean shit about me, adn thats really low
BiPoLaRbEaR91: you pretended to be my friend and said I craved attention behind my back, your the one who goes around, all gothic, 'oh, I just wanna DIE, i'm so sad, my life is horrible'
MoonSprite134: No I do not. People make those assumptions about me. I never said I was your friend either. You talked to me. You interacted with me. I made input where necessary
MoonSprite134: I never said we were friends
BiPoLaRbEaR91: okay, then why did you invite me (along with all Taylor, not your, friends) to your party?
MoonSprite134: I felt like it
BiPoLaRbEaR91: oh, okay
MoonSprite134: My parents said to invite people. They never said they had to be my friends
BiPoLaRbEaR91: wtf
BiPoLaRbEaR91: what the hell are you smoking?
MoonSprite134: I dont do drugs
BiPoLaRbEaR91: oh. ok
BiPoLaRbEaR91: I can tell :-$
MoonSprite134: You're boring me
BiPoLaRbEaR91: oh, okay, wanna razor? that should brighten things up for you
MoonSprite134: Not really. Quite frankly, you're only wasting your energy on things that you could have saved for Brent, eh?
BiPoLaRbEaR91: fuck brent
MoonSprite134: You almost did
BiPoLaRbEaR91: sure did, I was drunk stupid ass, you ever been so drunk off your ass you cant even stand without almost falling over?
MoonSprite134: I think that if you were that drunk, you wouldnt remember a thing that would had happened
BiPoLaRbEaR91: but I do
MoonSprite134: So you werent that drunk
MoonSprite134: You were tipsy
BiPoLaRbEaR91: I was drunk
MoonSprite134: Tipsy is the word you're looking for
BiPoLaRbEaR91: no, dumb bithc, I think I would know, plus, nobody had ever treated me like that, I thought he was sincere
MoonSprite134: Two hours and you thought he was sincere?
BiPoLaRbEaR91: I thought he liked me
MoonSprite134: Hun, you've much to learn
BiPoLaRbEaR91: first, never call me hun again or I think I might throw up my lunch, adn you were the one tounging up with darryn right after you met
MoonSprite134: Atleast we didnt go as far as you did. And yes, I do regret that. 
BiPoLaRbEaR91: you think I dont regret it?
MoonSprite134: Obviously you do
MoonSprite134: A good sign
BiPoLaRbEaR91: duh
BiPoLaRbEaR91: no, I feel just chipper
MoonSprite134: You do realize you dont have a chance in a frozen hell with Derryn?
BiPoLaRbEaR91: I dont like him anymore, and he liked you, god knows he could like ANYONE
MoonSprite134: He likes his girlfriend Taylor
BiPoLaRbEaR91: i know, i dont like him anymore
BiPoLaRbEaR91: oh, adn you dont have a snowmans chance in hell with Thaddeus, he doesn't even remember the dance, he was drunk, adn hes never gunna like you
MoonSprite134: I know
BiPoLaRbEaR91: well look at that, we have something in common
BiPoLaRbEaR91: now all I have to do is get all suicidal, gain about, a million pounds, adn we'll be twins! wont it be just pukeworthy
MoonSprite134: I'm sure it would
MoonSprite134: Seeing as you'd be bigger than me after that
BiPoLaRbEaR91: by about a millionth of a pound
MoonSprite134: More than that
BiPoLaRbEaR91: okay, a hundredth of a pound
MoonSprite134: And you're pathetic if you're going to pick on my weight
MoonSprite134: I thought you were above that
MoonSprite134: I guess not
BiPoLaRbEaR91: I was, I thought you were above teasing me about my fucking dad
MoonSprite134: Well seeing as you did put it in your info, it seemed like a nice touch
MoonSprite134: Real, ""below the belt"" like
BiPoLaRbEaR91: dude, your scum
MoonSprite134: I know
BiPoLaRbEaR91: hes my fat5her
BiPoLaRbEaR91: father**
MoonSprite134: Was, dear, was
MoonSprite134: You have Bill now
BiPoLaRbEaR91: dude fuck you
BiPoLaRbEaR91: that is the lowest thing I have ever heard
MoonSprite134: You're bound to get lower
MoonSprite134: I mean, you did get down for Brent
BiPoLaRbEaR91: dude, fuck you
MoonSprite134: What? No smooth, comebacks?
BiPoLaRbEaR91: I cant even speak right now, you just blew me away with that one
MoonSprite134: Thought so
BiPoLaRbEaR91: that is the first time you have gone so low to insulting my dad that I cried
MoonSprite134: Well three years and no insults about that, yeah I think some tears were due
BiPoLaRbEaR91: you are so fucking heartless
MoonSprite134: You have no idea
BiPoLaRbEaR91: actually I do, yopu have no clue what I went through with my dad
BiPoLaRbEaR91: you**
MoonSprite134: I sympathize with the stuff you went through, but...I wont lose sleep over it
BiPoLaRbEaR91: tell me, becasue im eager to know, how many times have you been home alone with your dad in florida at the age of 8 and watched him gave a siezure?
MoonSprite134: None, glad to say
BiPoLaRbEaR91: well, it sucks, its scary, its confusing, and it sucks, so dont even talk about what you dont know
BiPoLaRbEaR91: oops, I said it sucks twice
BiPoLaRbEaR91: cuz its sacary
BiPoLaRbEaR91: scary**
MoonSprite134: I sympathize, really I do, but, like I said, I won't lose sleep over it
BiPoLaRbEaR91: good
BiPoLaRbEaR91: I dont want your sympathy
MoonSprite134: Aww, I thought what with all these stories and entries and dedications; that that's all you really wanted
MoonSprite134: I have to go
MoonSprite134: Taylor wants on
BiPoLaRbEaR91: i know"

I love all the songs, even though I just strated listening to them yesterday. But Feure Frei is also known as Bang Bang by Joe and Brian, and me, if you dont know it, its the song from triple X in the concert at the beginning! it sounds like Fight Fire, but its Feure Frei its taking me a long time in this entry becasue its really hard to spell all these German words, actually, Mein Herz Brentt means My Heart Bleeds, hehe, well, bye!

""when the rock was a little boy, the rock remembers beating kids up on the playground, the rock was considered the bully, and the rocks father before him the same, now, the rocks father beat the shit out of your candy ass dad. and the rocks grandpa beat the shit out of your grandpa, and tonigh, the rock is gunna beat your ass, just like the rocks dad and grandpa did before him, so, CAN YOU SMELL, WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING?"" then he punched the guy and got in trouble, and everyone went nuts, hello? am I the only one who noticed the braindead brute was REFERRING TO HIMSELF IN THIRD PERSON!!! and why the hell does everyone love him??? he sold out for gods sake, just me, but I dont like him.

Friday was a lot of fun. We hung out over in there room just chilling. We tried to watch movies, but no one had the attention span for it. One of my friends (who will remain nameless) had 10 beers, 4 shots of vodka, and another 3 beers! Yeah, so when we started reading Cosmo's Kama Sutra outloud, he was actually doing the positions.

Sunday night we celebrated my suitemates 21st birthday (which was really Monday) by for the most part...getting her hammered. I was comfortably social. Everyone else was comfortably hammered. Sunday was just a strange night, but this whole weekend was a whole lot of fun! But from now on I am either going home for the whole weekend or at least going home for one day to be with my mom. But as always, I *attempt* to make the best of everything. =)
Classes are going....actually suprisingly well. I was out today at 10:30 because I got out of Psych early and CS was cancelled. So that was pretty sweet =)
It's a busy week again so I might not write for awhile, but everyone have a good week and you'll hear from me again soon! =)"

I've only had two, but it's been awhile since I've drank so I am definately feeling very warm right now =) Everyone is going to watch a movie which I will join in a little while. I just felt like chilling. I'm actually feeling really weird because I am in a suite of all really hot guys, but they're definately all more interested in my suitemates than they are in me. Oh well. Thats actually one of the main reasons I came in here rather than stay out there. It's probably better that way. Then I again I shouldn't care because I don't need a man right now. Even though if the opportunity came along.......=) Oh well. I will live. I'll just drink myself stupid and forget everything. Buh-Bye"

"event","Well, I've been here at school for a couple of days and my last two suitemates just arrived today so we've been bonding. Terri and me have our room set up real nice so we're liking that a lot. Feels like home. It was so weird coming back because there was no weirdness at all. It was just like everyone picked up right where we left off. It was like we had only been apart for three days rather than 3 months. It made coming back a lot easier too, knowing people. Not being a total stranger to everyone around you. Tomorrow classes start. A lot of people are complaining, but I just finished school two weeks ago so I am really still in the ""study, work hard"" frame of mind. As crazy as this must sound, if I work harder this semester I will attribute it to having taking a summer course and then I might take a summer course every year.  Band Camp was a lot of fun (but not in that ""American Pie""-ish type of way). We have a lot of interested freshman so we might actually double our numbers this year and have a *real* band and sound pretty good. There is still only us three altos (the Three Musketeers Sam, Mike and me) but we manage =). I'm looking forward to a good year. I might not update as often as I would like to, but thats only because I will be pretty busy, but I will try and update. I'm gonna go chill before our hall meeting and hopefully I will update again soon!"

"event","Ok, so last night was my friend Natie's Suprise birthday party which is always loads of fun =). But Natie definately has like very interesting ways of showing that she's surprised cause like I don't think she was...hmmmm. Oh well. Still lots of fun considering we were out in East Bumble F*** Orange. Hehe. Hope you guys all got home ok. ;) So it's right after the ""surprise"" and my friend Mark and Eddie left in Eddie's car to go get the pizza. About ten minutes after they left Melissa's boyfriend Chris says ""Wow, it's really pouring out, good thing my windows are up"" So everyone breathes a sigh of releif except Janessa and me. Janessa turns to me and says ""Do you remember if Mark closed his sun roof when he moved his car?"" I was like ""Gee, I really don't know. Lets check"" So we run all the way down to the end of my friends long ass drive way only to find out, Oh my god...he didn't!! It's wide open!! Not to mention that he has a standard so here's the rain pouring in all over his stick shift. So Janessa and I book it back to the house and scream ""PEEEEEEETE!!! MARK'S SUN ROOF IS WIDE OPEN!!!"" And with in a matter of 3 seconds all hell broke loose. Pete comes barreling down the stairs screaming Holy shit!! Do you have the key??? Of course not, Mark has it. So we're like ""Grab something to cover it!!"" So here's where the adrenaline-pumped-do-the-first-thing-that-pops-in-to-your-head-whether-it's-a-good-idea-or-not moment comes. Pete grabs the Plastic Wrap (you know, the food-wrapper-upper stuff) and we run back to Mark's car and we start stretching this stuff over the sunroof of his car. As we're walking back to the house we're like ""Well, it's the thought that counts"". When Mark got back he ran down to the end of the driveway and when he saw his car he screams ""I love you guys!!"" The inside was still pretty saturated, but not as bad as it could have been. It was definately a very comical-break-the-ice moment. I think Janessa, Pete, and I were wetter than his car. Hehehe  I hope everyone had a good time last night!!
Only 4 days till WNEC!!! Last night made me realize how much I will miss my friends. I am still looking forward to going back to school though. I should probably start to pack......Ummmmm =} hehe. Tomorrow maybe a no computer day for Erin =O. Ok, get over your stroke =) My dad has to install a SCSI card into my computer so he can hook up his old scanner to my computer. Don't ask me where all this computer stuff is going at school. I got my brother;s old (but bigger) monitor, my dad's scanner, my printer, my actual computer, speakers...I won't have room on my desk for anything else!!
Well, I have to go. I'm missing out tubing down the Farmington River with my friends because my fam is having a ""Late lunch, early dinner"" =( Buh-bye!!"

"event","Tonight is just a sit back and *relax* night. I'm chilling here, sipping a Smirnoff Ice, having some GODIVA ice cream, and feeling contemplative. Only one week and 3 days until I got back to school (got to keep you updated on that countdown). I don't have to be at work tomorrow until 2 so I have big plans for the afternoon for some back to school shopping. I don't need to get much cause a lot of it I will just use from last year. 
Work has been really easy lately because it's been raining cats and dogs. Thursday we had these *crazy* thunderstorm and the clubhouse flooded again. So I went in to work to help John and the lifeguards clean it up. We've decided that it is never a dull moment at Paugusset. Our latest fiasco is the Wild Life we're finding inside the guard shack. Yesterday it was a mouse. The poooooor little mouse. It was so cute and all the guys were chasing it around the guard shack, terrorizing it out of its mind until it finally found refuge in the hole in the wall. Then we were banging on the walls trying to get it to come out. We wanted to catch it and just set it free in the woods. But the poor now-mentally challenged mouse is probably in some corner of the guard shack, twitching. Today it was the infamous mouse and a chipmunk. Matt went in there after the chipmunk. The chipmunk just darted back and forth across the guard shack, trying to stay as far away from Matt as possible and then suddenly grew some balls and darted out of the shack.........directly at me. Now, I wasn't afraid of the mouse, but the chipmunk made me jump. We were also reading a very interesting issue of Cosmo. LOL, I will never forget the expression on Matt's face when I read ""Altoids and Ice"" outloud in refrence to and article about oral sex. LOL, priceless Matt, PRICELESS!!. And finally, everydays a fun day when you use Bleach. Here's how it went: 
""That's quite a bit of bleach you're using there"" <--Matt
""Yeah, but whats the hurt. It'll get clean"" <--me
""Worse case scenario....the bleach will eat through the pavement to a hidden gas line, somehow cause a spark and blow Paugusset to bits."" <--Matt 
""Well Alright then"" <-- me *while unscrewing the cap again*
Tee-Hee....I love you Matt =) 
Friday night I went and saw American Pie 2. I certainly wouldn't praise it for it's storyline (because of the lack there of), but it was F***ING HILARIOUS!!. Oh my....I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. The end was a nice twist too. Plus I got to go watch it with two very good friends of mine so that was very nice. 
Last night I went out to dinner with my friend Brian. Brian and I are soooo funny. We're so comfortable with eachother that we can flirt with eachother, make sexual innuendos (sp) up the wa-zoo, and it's all just fun. One time he said he was beginning to wonder whether he should start charging me for phone sex. Hehe. I love Brian. We're going to get married in the end of May 2011 if neither of us is married yet. BTW, if you're reading this. I got the Cadillac =P Tee-hee!!! I wish we went to the same school....it'd be such a wild time. MEOW =). Only three more days of work. I'm gonna miss all the maintinence guys. 
I have a feeling this is going to be a very interesting year...."

But boy was today a sight to see at Paugusset. I guess the guys have decided that it was finally hot enough for them to walk around with out their shirts. Hence the title of this entry (MEOW w/ a double PUURRR). John I knew had a body on him, he's a football player. But Jeff if you're reading this, you should flaunt yours more often!! I wasn't kidding when I made that sexy comment to you =) So the scenery at Paugusset was very enjoyable today 0=) Tee-Hee. If only they were working tomorrow....supposed to be hotter....*drooool*. Ok I don't normally drool over 16 year olds, but these guys are cute =). 
Today was our 2nd to last day of Calc so we had a full class review. Of course he only goes over everything I KNOW how to do =P He's like ""We won't reveiw Infinite Series since we just did that"". Well HELLO, I also FAILED that test =P Hence, the necessity for a REVIEW!!. Well, it will be all over tomorrow. I am pretty comfortable with everything I know so tomorroe I will just work my ass off on the stuff I don't know how to do. Hopefully I do well. Everyone cross your fingers for me PLEASE!! =) No one wants Erin paying $800 for this class =P. And also as of today...... LESS THAN TWO WEEKS TILL I GO BACK TO WNEC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =) Hehe I'm not excited at all......

I am pretty much guranteed to pass, but not by my parents standards. WHY DO PARENTS HAVE TO BE SO POOPY????? The professor says ""Don't worry, the final will be considered easy by my standards because I want to bump up some of those low grades!"" Oh yeah...what a great guy. What he doesn't realize is that what is easy by his standards is not easy to half the classes standards of easy. He's such a nerd, my teacher. He says today ""And now, we come to the exciting conclusion of Calculus II......caluculating e to the first *FIVE* decimal places using Taylor's Theorem!!""

Now, I am just chilling until it's time to go to class.
Last night I got to talk to my friend Kevin from Pep Band. Boy, you don't realize how much you miss someone until you talk to them! When I talked to him I had been feeling a little down in the dumps, but just three sentances in to the conversation he had me smiling again! He's such a sweetie.  
I hate this time of year. When your parents start to realize that you're going away and it makes them feel extra ""giving"". Because they'll hand you money or something and say ""Keep the change"". And you know you shouldn't take it, but since it's money you *want* it so you don't protest as hard as you would if it was something you didn't want. So since you aren't protesting as hard, they insist even harder so you end up taking it, but all it does is make you feel guilty. I hate it. I just wish they wouldn't do that.
Thats all for now. Write again soon."

"event","Don't you just hate pimples? They are probably the most irritating thing in the life of a teenager. Even though I am *almost* twenty, I still get pimples. And as I see it, there is only three ways to get rid of the pimple people. Firstly, you could wait them out, but then they just laugh at you and then just to spite you they stick around for another week. Secondly, you could pop them (YUCK!!), but then they scoff and say ""Ha Ha Ha. You may be rid of me, but my scar will live on forever"". Lastly, the most effective way to get rid of pimples is to use one of those ""fast acting"" blemish ""removers"". For one they burn like H-E double hockey-sticks and They are neither fast acting nor do they remove. Why does life have to be so unfair? Sorry, just had to vent.
I went to work bright and early today expecting to see the nice maintinence guy, but alas I get there and there's the note from my boss saying he wasn't coming in today. Sadness =( I suppose it's for the best, he's 4 years younger then me =/. Today was pretty uneventful, but there were a lot of people there, which is always annoying because that means the phone is ringing off the hook and everyone is complaning. John and Joe were there today so I at least had some normal people there. 
John and I have known eachother pretty much all our lives. We're neighbors actually. So we're pretty close. He's the one who got me the job at Paugusset. So at least I know who to blame...uhh..I mean to thank 0=) 
I know I really really want to go back to school, but I am going to miss my mom a lot. She actually expressed to me last night how much she liked having me around. And for my mom to express herself is hard. I still want to go back, mainly because I have to choice, I have to. Just knowing how my mom feels about me going back makes it a lot harder. I'll just have to come home more often this year. Thats all I can think to write about now. Maybe more later."

"event","You never realize how badly you want something until it is right there in front of you and *just* out of your reach. Ever since I got my housing confirmation, all I can think about is going back to school. I'm thinking packing up all my stuff, moving in, seeing all my friends, going back to classes, how I'm gonna decorate the room, what it's going to be like again to have all my friends right there within my reach rather than a whole town (20 minutes) away. It's making me want to have everything come to an end now so that I can begin again at school now. I want class to be over now, but I still have another 4 days. I want work to be over now, but I still have another week and a half. And I want to be back at school, but that's not for another 2 1/2 weeks. I guess I will have to be my usual patient self. I am the queen of patience. 
I woke up this morning and went to work. Now that Art's and Crafts are over, I work the front desk at the same club. I answer the phone (Hello Paugusset Club, Erin speaking *sweet receptionist voice*) fill out guest passes (""But he's a house guest!! He should only be a $2!!"" ""Yes, but policy says....blah blah blah ""), and basically be the punching bag of all the problems that go on. This morning was *really* slow even though tonight is frozen drink ""no-cook"". Now these people consume more alcohol in one sitting than college football players consume in a whole year. Take tonight for example. They purchased the huge bottles of ready-mix frozen drink stuff (just add ice, already has alcohol) plus large bottles of tequila, vodka, etc..And basically just drink themselves in to such a drunken stuper that they forget who they came with and hook up with someone else's significant other for a ride home. Very interesting. Did I also forget to mention that these ""responsible"" parents bring their children to these BBQ's? Yeah so they get in the car drunk, with their kids, and drive home. It makes me tempted to be a designated driver at these BBQ's. For the kid's sake. 
I think I will take up some of this entry to tell you more about myself, maybe a tad more personal. I don't have a boyfriend. I've maybe had only two ""real"" boyfriends. There have been a few where we were ""boyfriend and girlfriend"", but not really. As a matter of fact I got my first kiss maybe 5 days after my *19th* birthday and still have only been kissed once after that. Also, I have no interest in having a boyfriend right now because I have so much going on in my life right now that if I had to please one more person or make one more person happy, I'd go postal.
Like I said before, Pep Band is probably the best thing I have ever gotten involved in. The people in it are all so different yet we all relate and get along so well. We always have an awesome time whenever we get together. I've been playing the clarinet for 11 years and the saxaphone I started just last year. I definately would not be the person I am now if I hadn't been in band since 4th grade. Band is all about expressing yourself and being your own person enough to be able to express yourself. It really changed who you are. Well, I'll write more again soon. Thats all I can think to write about for now."

Actually I could tell you what today (my *first* day off in what seems like forever)was supposed to entail. Today I was supposed to take my mommy out to Olive Garden just the two of us my treat and then when I got home I was supposed to study, study, STUDY for my exam on Monday. Whoa Nelly, I don't think that will happen any time soon. My father decides that since the four of us (Mommy, Daddy, brother, and me) are all home at the same time we should all go out for *dinner* together. Well that just about throws everything because I can't study in the afternoon. It's this weird .....THING....I have. Just can't do it. Plus, I just about can't stand my father lately so I am not all too looking forward to this little family rendez-vous. Which looks like it might not even happen anyways. See my mom, is very sick (no details) and occasionally it causes her white blood cell count to get very very low. Bio Lesson: White Blood Cells are the ones that defend your body against disease. For example, what is the common cold for someone would turn in to pneumonia on my mom. Well we just got a call from the lab saying that her white count is *dangerously* low. So she really can't go anywhere because she can't be in contact with anyone. Oh well. I will try and make the most of the day at home with my mom. Think Olive Garden excepts take out orders?"

"event","I am a night owl=) If you couldn't tell already. WOW! So since this is my first entry I guess I will introduce myself. Hi! I'm Erin. I am going to be a sophomore at Western New England College. You're probably thinking to yourself now, Western New England College? Where the f*** is that??? Well, I'll tell you. It's in Springfield Massachusetts. And I will be back at WNEC in 2 weeks, 4 days, 15 hours, 30 minutes, and 35 seconds. Not that I am counting or anything =) I found this nifty little site from my totally cool kick ass friend Allie the Valley (inside joke, you'll soon learn about). 
I currently work at this Pool and Tennis Club called Paugusset in my hometown. I was originally doing Arts and Crafts with the little kids and Miss Allie as my assistant. And oh what a summer this was!! Just today it ended and it was so sad to leave the adorable little children, but (not-so) deep down inside me....I was celebrating. I think the most....interesting project was the ""Scrotum""-shaped pinata. Oh no, you didn't read that wrong. I said SCROTUM. Originally Allie and I thought it was be so cute to make a HEART shaped pinata that said ""I love Paugusset"" on it and have the kids beat that with a metal bat.(see, our intentions started off innocent 0=) ) But, much to our dismay, it was definitely SCROTUM (there's that word again) shaped. So today we were having the kids break it. How amusing....little 8 year old children beating a giant nut-sac shaped pinata with a metal back. Oh my, oh my. Unfortunately, these kids were having trouble getting it opened themselves (might have had *something* to do with the 20 layers of paper-mache) so the two maintenence guys (I love you, John and Joe ;)) beat it with sticks and then I just opened it the rest of the way and the kids went nuts. It was a nice amusing end to our last day as the Arts and Crafts directors. Oh right, the Allie The Valley thing. There's this cute kid named Ashely #1 (no, seriously) who comes to Arts and Crafts and she gave Allie and I nicknames. Allie's was of course ""Allie the Valley"". Mine, not so cute. I'm ""Erin the barbarian"". Oh well =P
What else could I tell you? Lets see, right now I am currently taking a Calculus course (ok, stop gagging..I like math) over the summer so that will FINALLY be over next week. I am actually a Math major with a Computer Science Minor. Cool beans, huh? =) I am in Pep Band at college which is probably the most funnest thing in the whole world. I met a lot of cool people and am sooo happy about it =) Well, that was pretty much my day. It's getting late so I will talk to you cool kitty's laterz, okie dokie? Nite!!"

school sux tee is fuct coz im failing at it even tho ive gone off the drugs and alcohol for 2 and a hlf weeks so far...i still seem to fail it.no hints or anything gee...

my brothers have started shooting up again.they havent been seen or heard from since last thursday and i feel like im the only one thats worried...well thats because i am the only one left that even remotly gives a shit about them.my lil sis keeps telling me how pathetic they are and how she hates them.i lose it everytime she does that.i wish they would stick to the plan and get better but they keep on going bak.ive always said that i would neva turn out like them bcoz i lived thru the paiun of watching them do it to themselves but i realised the other day that im alot like them in many ways.especially with the alcohol.and the drugs.but ill nefva touch speed bcoz of them.it just everything else but the speed and heroin.its so fuct.

dad is being the biggest cockhead of late.just being the usuall him.and me being the usual fat ugly useless piece of trash.


so many brusies to hide....so many tears to cry"

"event","hmm well gary died on saturday night...while i was trashed.but i think i realised something was up even tho i didnt know because for no apparent reason i grabbed scissors and was about to start cutting when jessie and amy fought them off me.hmmm just a thought i guess.it really sucks that hes not aroung anymore..its only been a few days and its only starting to sink in that im never going to see dear gary nelson ever again.it hurts.a fucking lot.this is the 4th person in my life that actually means something to me that has left me in the jail cell called life.i really hate life.it treats me so bad.i hate alot of things to tell the truth.there is only one person that i hate more then i hate myself.and that is my dear father.he dosent deserve the label of 'dad'.i hate him.before gary got sick..dad was in one of his moods and threw a plank of wood at gary.FAGGOT!!!BET U REGRET THAT NOW HUH COCKFUCK!!!i really hope that dad is suffering right now.he needs to suffer.he needs to have all the pain that he ha inflicted upon me...tossed back upon himself.he deserves it.not me.mum has not a clue of what he does to me.mr andrijch gave me the name of a councillor for parent consotation or sum shit...(i think it means problems with the parents).so i gave it to her and she threw it away coz she said that the problem isnt with the parents.she asked me if it was and i couldnt bring myself to telling her so i said no thats not the problem.oh well.i might be able to cope until im 16 or 18.maybe.well another plus to all this shit is that i get to sit down and try and act normal with one of my rapists while we all have dinner together like great neighbours should.tim thinks that i should get out of the house for that particular night but luke thinks that i should face my fears and then try to get over it.im so confused as to what do to.with everything.this really sucks.everyone is saying dont cut dont cut dont cut but im actually dying faster now that ive stopped.i cant stop.its an addiction.an addiction that i happen to want back.except i dont want amy tim and jessie to be upset like they were before.do you think i could hide it??that would be fairly hard seeing i work with all 3 of them now.they would notice.bleh i dont know....too many thoughts...

bye"

"event","blood drip
stop the pain
minds gone crazy
makes me feel insane
heart stop
brain freeze
the feeling i like
blood runs with ease
fingers cram
hands shake
have no energy
but still im awake
bad dreams
wonderful nightmares
abuse everywhere
makes you feel no one cares
eyes wide awake
eyes slowly shut
feeling so unhealthy
with pains in my gut
voice deep
melody so high 
have no wings 
but im ready to fly......."

realesing of all the painful harm

ive never seen so much blood come out of a single cut before...i felt really weak when i first saw it which is weird because ive never felt weak when i look at my beauties...i admire them.i know that sounds weird but i have a love hate relationship with my scars.they have a certain beauty about them and yet sometimes when certain people see my scars i feel some regret.hmmm

ok im out.byez

"event","hmmm well its now only 2 weeks until the dearest gary will pass away.he was hositalised yeaterday and they say he wont be coming out.......mum keeps saying that he wont feel a thing whem he goes which is bullshit because he will be feeling like shit anyways whether we can see it or not.he wont be wanting to leave...he has an 8 year old child for fucks sake.he wants to see him grow up and not having little bryce asking when his daddy is coming home.god life is a bitch.
elle you remember that msg you sent to me today how it said something like how if we dont get better you will leave with me??i dont want you to leave.never.this councilling we are going to will work for you.your life will take the turn for the best.this councillng will do jack for me except put a cover of my feelings for my parents so they can feel better.it wont be sorting out my problems because im not telling them bout dad or they will teel the police.im not telling them bout my neighbour or they will tell the police.so im just going to smile and say that im fixed when really i will be breaking my shattered life into pieces like glitter.oh well whats new....

well i better go mums getting shitty....get of the computer i wanna go to bed blah dee blah....

love yous xoxoxoxxooxoxxooxoxoxoxoxxoox"

"event","Hee hee! My first lively journal entry, whoosh!

Sorry that I've been neglecting you, my dear diary, but I have new tales to tell for you!

I bumped into a cute nurse, the other day. Literally. He was so adorable! His name is Takumi-chan, and he is My Highness, the Fish Queen! [ Hee hee, inside joke. ]
We went on a journey to find the world outside [ of the hospital, since we were terribly bored out of our minds ] and I ended up having to rescue him from the evil liar of the Janitor's closet! It was so much fun! I can't wait for our next meeting. I hope it turns out to be as fun-filled as the first! I'm always up for a little challenge, too, so maybe we can go to the arcade, next time. I'll whoop him at DDR!

Also, I met a patient. His name was Ryutaro, another cute name. He carried a little kitten with him called Tare-chan. She was cute, and she said I was cute, too! Ryutaro seems rather shy, though. Maybe I can lure him out of his little nut shell world! I must! It my duty, as the most glorious nurse in the universe!

[ Hee hee, more of my fat-headedness talking to you. ]"

Tara playfully pranced down the corridor as he stepped out of his office, singing the song in the most cheerful voice he could possibly muster. He had abandoned his lab coat, thinkint it ugly and too professional. He just wore his white tank top that was decorated with black stars that looked as if they had been splattered all over it. Along with that was a pair of loose, black pants and a belt with rainbow pyramid spikes upon it. 
As he pranced and skipped, his rainbow flip flops made little noise against the floor. A chain hanging from his pocket that ran from his wallet to a belt loop bounced against his hip and issued a jingling noise.
""Jump with the moon, and move iiit~! Jump back and forth! Feel like you were there yourself! Work iiit ooout~!"" 
Tara shook his head from side to side excitedly as he continued to jump and skip down the hallway, his voice carrying on down the corridor.
""Never did no harm! Never did no harm!"""

"event","I'm so excited about my new job! I can't wait to get started! I hear that my patients are all sweet little angels, but maybe that man was just being sarcastic...
I don't know, but whatever! I'm happyyy! I wonder when I'll be getting my schedule. Soon, I hope. I'm on the edge of my seat as I think about how much fun I'm going to have on my first day!
Hopefully, I'll have some nice patients. I hope they aren't too much trouble..."

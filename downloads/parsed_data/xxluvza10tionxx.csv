"event","Ehhhh today (or yesterday now) has been one of those boring days... things were accomplished i guess (finally got my desk put together) but it still seems like an uneventful day. Nothing major happened. Oh yeah, except that the Bucs LOST in the last few SECONDS of their season opener to the Dolphins. 17-14. UGH. Good thing that score doesnt count. ok well i'm out for now, nada much to say.  ciaooo."

"event","Ehhh it's been a very ""blah"" day. Very uneventful. I had a long night last night... didn't sleep till around 4 this morning.  I was talking to my baby (HEY DADDI!) and once he went to sleep my girl britt and i was lookin at some pick-up lines... we were laughin so hard. But anyways... i came home... my fathers house isnt the most interesting thing in the world if u know what i mean. i'm not comfortable there. and i dont really think i'm welcome; it's more like, yeah i can go to my dad's house cause he's my dad... not cause he wants me there. i think a lot of that has to do with his wife. UGH. you know the deal with the ""evil/wicked step-mothers"". Nice to your face -- but seriously cant stand you. oh well i dont care cause i cant stand her either.  SIGHHHH i miss my Andres. We havent talked much today so far... i wonder where he is right now? i wish he was here with me. ----------------- so yeah school starts in a week, i'm excited,...i guess. i'm officially grown now. on my own in some ways... but of course i'm still living at home. (no intention of leaving right now). --- earlier today i came across this dark literature short storie. It was one of the few gothic stories i've read in my young life... but WOWWWW!!!! was it intriging. intense. erotic, even. ...made me want to BE in the story.  Nothing has ever pulled me in like that did to me.  you should check it out! (www.darkness.org/literature/stories.htm)
Its ten o'clock right now... and i am sooo lonely. i want him here. ::sigh:: i guess good things come to those who wait right??? yeah. it's gotta be true. well... i need to get out of here for now... ciao!"

"event","Okay well i didn't wake up till around one this afternoon... so the day has went pretty fast. I woke up completely... uhmmmm... content. Yeah that would definitely describe me. :o) My Daddi  told me ""i love you"" last night... it's been a while since i've heard that... (the rest of the night i was GLOWING).  so anyways, i had a good night and woke up like ""wow; its a gooood day!"" I started to drain my waterbed in attempt to move it to another side of my bedroom... it's still draining. LoL.  Im at my fathers house right now... his side of the family threw me a 18th B-Day party. here in Aurburndale (aka-RedneckVille), ugh... it sux here. i got some money though.. so it's all good. But i'm happy today.. feeling RICH in alll aspects.  <wink> Brittney ***HEY BRITT*** is here with me along with my sis, (aka Skipper) they're so retarted... we all are so stupid. lol, okay well i'm out of here.   ciaoooooooooo."

"event","Well this is my first entry.  It seems pretty cool, at least here it's kinda hard for mom to read it. LoL. Sooo, whats new?  Well i've been OF legal age now for one week.  NOthing seems different. Only that college will be starting soon and all of my friends have went their separate ways, well a majority of them.  I'm looking forward to school though, it's gonna be a big change from high school life, i know... but hopefully for the better. Everything has been so hectic lately... it's like i have time for no one. Well, except for some-ONE.  I ALWAYS have time for Daddi. GAWD I LOVE HIM! <wink> BUt he knows who he is.  I'm pretty sure he's still taken right now... but one day... i know he'll be mine. Cause i know i can make him happier than any other. :o)~  Geez listen to me, like any of you wanna know about all of that. Okay well i guess this is about it for now... i'll catch you guys tomorrow. Ciao!"

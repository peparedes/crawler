Maggie Johns:
-Hey Kimmy!! hows life treatin my girl? i hope its treatin u what u deserve - perfection... just letting u know i realized u werent ur hyper self on the phone and that something was wrong so please let me know if u need to talk- im here.. i love you forever and soo much  please never forget that you're one of my best friends ever and no guy shuold ever bring u down... they're not worth it babe! ur an amazing girl , the guy shoujld treat u like a queen... nothing less  love- maggie 

-Kimber thats not true at all, you are such an awesome girl the one thing i know that you need to fix is your confidence, and thats something i can help you with becuase i know what you are capable of and how amazing you are. You are always there for me when im upset.. ALWAYS.. never once have i been upset , called u and u not wanted to talk, and you are so funny and soo pretty, you just need to realize it and use it to your advantage. You need to recognize boys arent everything and when you know that, they'll know that you're ""hard to get"" and guys like that, and they'll want u even more. ****** doesnt know how much hes missing out on and he is too stoopid to ever realize that, you're smarter than him , but if ur smart you know that uve gotta move on and NOT let it bother you becuase if it does, a****** will feel like he has power, which he doesnt. In your case, confidence needs work but every single thing other than that is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, never change, so many people love u the way you are and your personality is sooo great. you always bring a smile to my face when i see you kimber - i love ya girly and i miss you so much- Maggie! only a few more days left until summer!- you and me- all summer long babeyy! MUAH 
       I absolutley love you Maggie Johns! you have no idea how much i miss you and how there are too many times to count that you literally saved me!! i lvoe you now and forever thank you for everthing!!!!

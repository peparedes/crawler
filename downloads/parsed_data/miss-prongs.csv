"event","I extend my apologies for not updating my journal more often. I really do not know what to say some of the time. With school, and all that has happened in America this week.... there is not a moment to rest.

I hope that Laurel recovers quickly, so that things can return to normal (or at least a semblance of it). And of course, Mandy's grandfather. There are so many who are sick and need help and prayers.

However much I would love to stay and chat, I have a paper to write. The end of the term is not far from now! I am excited, but will surely miss my friends from here when I return home. It's been such an interesting year... I don't know what to say. I love all of you very much."

"event","It's been a long time. That's about all I have to say. Other than I'm sick, but I did not really want to say that because now one of my brothers or cousins will see it and worry. Harvard is amazing. I am so glad I chose to come here. There is no place on Earth I would rather be right now. Except maybe home, with friends."

Except, sometime between 3 and 7AM Sunday morning my time, my cat, Furball, crossed the Rainbow Bridge.  When he didn't come purring to chow down when I was filling his food dish, I went looking for him, and found him stretched out on the living room floor.

I had him not quite 11 years, he was 4 when I got him, so he was nearly 15 (positively geriatric for a feline) at the time of his passing.

Dang, I'm gonna miss him."

Well, I got laid off from my part time job in February (Happy valentine's day, here's your pink slip), and haven't much luck finding work since.

Had to miss WorldCon this year.

Reached a milestone age so I could get into my Individual Retirement Accounting without any penalties (59.5), which is the only thing that's kept me going this far.

Is there anything you hear at the beginning of your day, music-wise, that helps set a mood for you and helps you face the day better?


Minor postscript:  For years, Rod Stewart was one of those people I could take or leave.  I never went out of my way to listen to him, but I never changed the station when I heard him, either.

Until I finally encountered the above-named song, and for some reason, I fell absolutely and instantly in love with it."

Spent a lot of time today, though, working on layout for my final project for  my HTML class.

Got the look and feel just where I want it, and know roughly what I want to do for content.

Tomorrow I organize the content, then start filling in the pages; it's a 5-page site, and I have the site template done (cannot use linked style sheets, alas, or it'd be TONS easier), which is the most time-consuming part.

And I have a lab assignment to turn in as well, having to do with forms.

Whee.

Furball kitty is stable, still haven't isolated the trigger for his high blood pressure, but the options left are extremely rare, and vet said as long as he's stable with existing meds, we won't go looking.

I""m also in recovery from a mini-crisis at one of my two ""day"" jobs, but that's since been resolved.  It was getting it resolved that sucked me away from doing much for several days....

And I've learned that, if the first thing I hear on the radio when I wake up in the morning is Rod Stewart's ""Rhythm of My Heart"", I tend to have a good day overall.  So anymore I look forward to those gravelly tones on my clock radio."

I did this on my desktop computer (because it's wired, not wireless, and I didn't want to risk losing completely by my wifi hiccuping), so I didn't have my code validation utilities installed there.

Furball had a two-week checkup, and his blood pressure is finally down into the normal range.

He now gets the prednisone tablets only 3x per week, and no eyedrops at all, so most of the time he only gets his BP meds 2x per day.  Except MWF, he gets the pred at night as well.

Still, they took more blood and other smaples, and plan to do some followup tests and a search for a potential hidden thyroid problem.

He goes back the first week of March.

He's also turning into one expensive cat.....


Meanwhile, my HTML/XHTML class goes apace, and I'm chomping at the bit.  For those of you who know about HTML and styling with CSS, let me put it this way:

You can do a lot more, and faster, with a style sheet that's either linked or embedded.  

But for this class, we have to use ""in=line"" styles, which makes it just as clunky as the old way of formatting HTML with attributes that are now ""deprecated"" (as in, they're no longer valid in the current implementation of XHTML).

I want to run.

Doing inline styles is forcing me to plod.

I am chomping at the bit, and often frustrated.

But, I'm making it through..."

Not when one is taking classes beyond work, <i>and</i> doing contract work with website maintenance for someone beyond the two regular jobs.

And since the class is in HTML/XHTML, I got my fill of same this weekend.

I completed the mods to my class home page that were required for Wk 3

I put together the working with images and text page that is our lab for week 3

(and it's driving my nuts, because we have to use CSS styling, but inline styles and not embedded styles). Long explanation for that.

Did the website updates for the lit agency, both on the existing site AND the redesigned site which hasn't yet been released yet. The agents are co-founders of the <a href=""http://www.sfwriters.org"">San Francisco Writer's Conference</a>, and are gearing up for that.  If you can go, do so; it's a really cool event, but they're probably sold out by now; they're limited to only a few hundred attendees.

Furball the cat is still getting medicated, although he's down to only 3 meds from the six he was on at one point.

1.  Prednisone acetate eyedrop is 1/day, but the antibiotic eyedrop is gone.
2.  Pred pills are 1/day, will probably go to 1 in 2 days after his next appt.

3.  Unfortunately, the Norvasc, for his blood pressure, is up to 1/2 pill 2x per day, because although his BP improved (from 240-270 range down to 195-210), it's still not good enough.

Poor kitty is getting paranoid, too, thinking that every time I call him, it's to give him drugs.  It isn't, but he goes and hides, anyway.  I'll be so glad when I don't have to give him either type of Prednisone again, and he gets the BP medicine in liquid suspension (they promised me we could try tuna or chicken flavors, to make it easier for the cat to take).

We'll see."

Teacher says she never received it; all I can figure is that I must have left out one step in the upload process, as this was the first time I'd ever used it.

Anyway, got assignment to teacher in another way, and am caught up pretty much to date, except for some tutorials which are super basic.

Furball progresseth apace.

He's now on only 1 pill per day of Pred, although he gets his blood pressure meds 2x per day.  Got a pill cutter, coz I have to give him a 1/4 tablet at a time.  This wouldnn't be such a pain, if the pills weren't diamond-shaped.

She didn't exactly find it, from my off-the-wall description (a cursive/script font, but with Embellishments sorta on the order of what you see in Old English type, but the embellishments are rather simple and look like the feather bobbers on the head of a quail).  Yeah, I know it sounds weird.

"event","Went to vet's again yesterday afternoon, this time the partner of the eye specialist I saw on Saturday.  Dr. McCallum is, um, shall we say, quite PRESENTABLE.  Ask Erin or Deirdre the exact wording I used in IRC :)  Also, he's a nice guy.  He <i>did</i> chuckle at Erin's caution about having to deal with ""kitty 'roid rage"".

Anyway.  Going in to this visit, Furball was taking several medications:

1.  1 pill for his blood pressure (actually 1/4 tablet Norvasc 2x/day).
2.  1 tablet of Prednisolone 2x/day
3.  An eye ointment that relaxed the nerves/muscles around said eye, 2x/day.
4.  1 drop 3x/day of Pred liquid
5.  1 drop 3x/day of Gentamicin (antibiotic).

Good news in the health arena:

His blood and urine analyses showed nothing that could pinpoint the underlying cause of his hypertension, so it may be something we can't find yet that may have to do with his heart.  This qualifies as good news, as it eliminated about 90% of the probable causes of the blood in his eye and the hypertension.

His blood pressure is dropping; even after a tense warm up to get him to the vet (cornering him with a vacuum cleaner; bad mommy), his systolic was down to 195.  Th is isn't good, but it's better than the initial readings of 270 and 240 from his first visit.

The eensy blisters that were on the retina in his good eye are healing up; now he just has eensy scars :/  And the right eye had cleared up enough that the vet could see his retina.  

Good news in the drug arena:

The eye ointment isn't needed anymore.
and....
He'll be weaned off the Pred tablets over the next week.  2/day for 3 days (so 2 days left, yay), then 1 a day until his next vet visit.

More good news:

Most kitty hypertension isn't caught until the cat actually goes BLIND.  We caught the Furboy in time.  And he can see out of his bad eye.

Bad news:

Whatever else happens, he'll be on Norvasc for his kitty hypertension for the rest of his life."

"event","Mr. Furball Cat's blood in the eye problem worsened dramatically from 10:30 last night until Midnight.  Deirdre and Erin were present in IRD when I noticed this, and decided he was going to the emergency clinic right then.

So I got dressed (I <i>was</i> ready for bed), packed him up, and drove off in the 28 degree (F) night, reaching the vet clinic at 1AM.  28 is frigging cold for this area, where we seldom get sub-freezing weather.

The clinic was already checking in a puppy, approx. 3 months old, a Brussels Griffon, who in his short life has almost died several times due to being infested with just about every worm that exists out there, poor pup.  In fact, as I was being checked in, there was a CPR order out for the poor little guy :(

Anyway, Furball's eye got noticeably worse in the 4 hours we were there (we didn't leave until after 5 AM).  His eyes had to be dilated, his blood pressure was checked (which would have been a comedy of errors in itself if it hadn't been so serious), and then the vet examined both eyes ... including the ""good"" one...which was a good thing, as she noticed anomalies there that are helping toward the final diagnosis.

Dr. Szucs (pronounced Zooch, in case you're curious), actually showed me two different lists of possible causes in her reference books, and the potential treatments for all of them.  She started Furball on treatment the most likely causes, plus treatment for the eye itself, and said she'd arrange with an ophthomalogist colleague who's in a specialist clinic two doors away to see him later.

I came home, finished off a banana and a quickly-nuked burrito, and went to bed ... all by 6:30.  

And the phone woke me up at 9:15.  It was Dr. Szucs saying that the specialist could see Furball at 11.  Rather than try to get back to sleep and miss waking up in time, I stayed up, then at 10 got dressed, gathered up Mr Furboy (who protested loudly, once), and headed off.  Got there a bit early, but no problem; I'd stopped at Jack for coffee and a sandwich on the way, so we sat in the parking lot and shared chicken fajita pita chicken :)

End result of the ophtho exam and an additional blood pressure check, Furball has hypertension.  Normal for a cat is 130/something; he tested out as 240/210.  And the pill he took for hypertension at 5 AM hadn't made much change yet, so he's going to get a dose 2X per day instead of 1X.

He also got blood and urine samples taken (another adventure; they couldn't find his bladder by feel, so they had to do ultrasound to locate it) :S , and then Dr. Burling (the ophtho) gave me a copy of the revised treatment plan.  She's faxing the results of both of these exams to Furball's regular vet, and I go back to see the specialists on Tuesday afternoon, where I""ll learn the results of the bloodwork and urine tests.

According to Dr. Burling, hypertension in cats, unlike dogs and humans where the tendency to same can be hereditary), is usually triggered by some other problem.  And the trigger for the hypertension check is the eye whose sclera suddenly fills up with blood.

Thus the tests; there are 3-4 they're looking at now that could trigger the hypertension; the hypertension diagnosis ruled out about 8-12 of the possible causes that Dr. Szucs had showed me at 4 AM.

Anyway, I'm beat, and don't know what work I'll get done today.  I have to finish up a few items on a lit agency website redesign and then upload it for preview/ok from the clients .... and crosschecking my first lab assignment for my XHTML class and uploading THAT.

Color me exhausted."

"event","I'm working a bit now.  In December I started the seasonal tech support job, which will be driving me nucking futz come mid-February, and will die off enough I'll be out of work again my Mar 31.

The year round job has increased from 5 to 12 hours a week, though, which is a nice break.

I'm also almost done with a website conversion to a new layout using Cascading Style sheets.

And, I'm taking web design classes (Computers on the Internet, aka COIN) at a local community college.

As if this isn't enough to keep me going crazy, sometime this afternoon or early evening, Furball D Cat's right eye got something done to it that's making it look full of blood in the sclera, and his pupils aren't the same size in both eyes.

So I've left a message with the vet, describing what i saw, and left my phone #s if they want to call me back.

Color me worried."

It may take me some time to get used to posting here, though."

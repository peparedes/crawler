Yeah...notice how i dont update to tell you how my life in college is...i only update to tell you which circle of hell i am going to spend eternity in...(which by the way isnt so bad as i get to hang out with Cleopatra and Helen of Troy...really the worst thing that happens is being fondled by winds...which isnt bad at all in comparison to being rained on by brimstone and fire, and being whipped by devils, and wallowing in human excrement)

No, but really i will update something meaningful soon..."

"event","Well.  I am not so sad anymore.  My friends are the best!  EVER.  Hahahaha, well for those of you who do not know what im talking about, lan katie robbie and cory surprised me and came down to san diego.  It was quite exciting.  I had no idea so it was a big shock.  I love surprises...they are the best ever.  Anyways there was this whole conspiracy between those kids and cape and scott and pat and they all planned it for a long time.  I feel so loooved.  eeee.  Anyways this weekend (which i thought would be bleh) was awesome...we did so many fun things that i cant list them all here and plus if i talked about it too much, those of you who werent there might get jealous.  You might.  Annnnnyways, they all left on sunday which was kind of sad again, but its ok.  Maybe ill go surprise someone some other time.  well maybe not.  if i do itll be a surprise.  muah ha.

So yes its a short one cause i have to go off to writing class (roara) but thank you my wonderful friends, i love you guys sooooo much and it was lovely seeing you again!  XOXO"

(hahahah its almost like a pun, but not really).  Turns out i cant get there sooooo, yeah...ill be trying to get work at the on campus jamba as a result.  But yeah a whole lot of crap is going down because the manager there says its my responsibility to get my shifts covered (theyve already scheduled me for the next two weeks) and theres only like 5 team members working there whos hours are maxed out.  Plus i started class today and i need to like get everything figured out with that. Yeeech...the homework commences.  And yes i know i am not nearly as stressed as some of your crazy kids but im starting to feel the pressure a bit.  And i miss my FRRRIIIEEEEEEEENDS!!!  : (  thats a sad sara face.  so sad.

"event","Well here I am in beeeeeautiful La Jolla (and yes scott and cape, you know even if it is boring as fuck, it is beautiful...so there)  and life is alright.  Besides the fact that my body has decided to start breaking down on me...like i was hiking down to the beach and my leg totally gave out on me...that was two days ago and im still have a very painful troublesome time walking.  I think people think im disabled because im walking with a major limp and they give me that encouraging smile like ""oh look at you, overcoming your physical deformities...keep on walking girl!""  And im just like dude i think i just pulled a muscle.  Also for some odd reason my fingers hurt.  Yes my fingers.  Of all the appendages the ones you think arent too useful are the ones that you really end up missing.  Its the third and fourth finger on both of my hands.  And no.  I refuse to believe its the finger cracking that has done it.  I think its small parasitic aliens that have entered my body and are now residing in the joints of my fingers.  I dont think i like it though.  I also dont like not being able to walk.  And typing is painful.  So im going to stop now.  Well im startng to feel a little bit homesick so blah.  But im struggling through .  Off to nurse my poor leg and finger wounds and eat some rice cakes.  Ta ta!"

I am going on a diet...dont worry im not anorexic or bulemic or anything...but i have gotten rather flubby.  yes, flubby.  See, i have discovered this odd concept...if you dont exercise and you eat alot when youre not hungry...well you gain weight.  Its really odd.  I dont think i like this.  And seeing as my ass is now the size of...oh well i dont know, something very big...and seeing as i weigh more than my sister (!!!!!!!!!!) i have decided to go run (or something) and not eat when im not hungry.  its simple.  i like my plan.  it started in effect today.  I did crunches and worked out on a little aerobic thing my mom got in the mail.  And i ate a tamale and some yogurt and an apple.  GOOD SARA. So a fond farewell to cheese its and freezer pizza...we had some good times...i love you guys.  But im moving on to bigger (actually hopefully smaller) things.  Like where i am not in the 120s anymore. because that makes me mad."

"event","Well.  I arrived here in Berkeley (well actually technically at the Oakland Airport yesterday about 11:15.  Yes and my departure was scheduled for 8:30.  For those of you who might know it does not take 2 and then some hours to fly to berkeley.  My flight was delayed until 9:30.  That was of course after i had been waiting around the airport for an hour since my parents think its really cool to be an hour and a half early.  But here i am safe and sound, sitting in an empty five story house (apart from three dogs and my sister.) Let me tell you its kind of creepy.  Its also cold here.  Oh well.

Enough of the bitching part...its actually quite nice to be hanging out with my sister...YAY! And we're going shopping tomorrow in San Francisco which is even more exciting.  But yeah today basically we walked around berkeley, just had a really relaxed day since we were both kind of drowsy.  Went to go see the Princess Diaries II...and i must say that movie exceeded my expectations for being horrible.  Like, you would expect typical chick flick, kind of lame but mostly cute.  No.  Let me say that once more, clearly.  NO.  It was horrible.  Theres no describing it.  Me and Jieun were laughing the entire time and not because the dialogue was funny.  Do yourself a favor if you were planning on seeing the movie...go buy some food, or a CD or burn the money...anything, just don't go see it.

Yeah i think thats all for tonight...

Hugs and kisses to all of my dear friends..."

"event","Ok...funny little anecdote/dialogue of the day...

A girl is leaning behind the counter at Jamba Juice, with a glazed over expression in her eyes, her mouth hanging open.  Suddenly the door to the store opens and the girl immediately perks up, beaming energetically and radiating helpful charisma.  An attractive woman enters, presumably about thirty, with long blonde hair and a friendly smile.  She strides toward the girl confidently and begins a conversation...

Me:  Hi, welcome to Jamba Juice, what can I get for you today?!
Her:  Ummmmm well I think i would like to try the Cranberry Craze, but I don't want the yogurt or the sherbet.
Me:  Ok, no problem, I'll have them take out the dairy...would you like to substitute the sherbert for more fruit?
Her:  Oh, yeah, that'd be great!  Thank you so much.
Me:  No problem at all...would you like a free boost in that smoothie?

(Immediately the mood in Jamba Juice changes....the room becomes a bit darker and the lightning flashes outside the window...the woman looks at me, a steely, unforgiving glint in her eye as she clutches the counter with her talon-like fingers...)

Me: Uhhhhhhhhhh...
Her:  Do you KNOW what boosts are?
Me:  Nutritional suppliments...to help...your body get the right amount of vitamins...?
Her:  Its POISON!!!!  You know your body NEEDS living cells to function.  Anything that has NOT been alive--you know, plants or animals or anything else (what else has been alive, I wonder) is POISON, especially boosts!  Its like grinding up rocks and feeding them to people! (BAM...pounds her fists into the counter at every emphatic word)
Me:  Uhhhhhhhhhh...
Her:  Its all a SCAM for Jamba Juice to make more money, ripping off people then KILLING them!  (yeah, our boosts are free...but by this point I'm a bit freaked out so I say...)
Me:  Yeah...hahaha, ok...rocks...right.

(The mood lightens, apparently I have managed to appease her and she smiles angelically...)

Her:  Anyways, you're way too pretty to be working at Jamba Juice.  You should get another job.
Me:  (Awkward smile?)  Thanks?  Yeah, actually I'm going to college soon.
Her:  Oh thats so wonderful dear...what are you planning on doing?
Me:  I'm actually thinking about going into journalism...maybe becoming a teacher. I'm not really sure yet.
Her:  Ohhhhh a teacher...

(Imperceptibly the mood changes once again...a thin string of saliva dribbles out of her mouth as she begins to stare at me zealously...)

Her:  You know they teach you LIES in school?
Me:  (Stare at her for a second)  Mmmmm?
Her:  Yes LIES!!!!!!!!  Don't believe in what they tell you...DON'T believe in evolution!!!  Its all a LIE that some crazy scientists cooked up...I have a videotape that COMPLETELY DISPROVES evolution!!!  Like, the first time I saw it, I was just amazed...
Me:  Huh.  (WOW....WHAT THE FUCK?!!!!!)
Her:  It was like I was shown the light...the way they explained it...you should NOT believe those LIES they teach you at those public schools...you know...God is our father and He created us and He sent his Son, our Lord JESUS CHRIST to save our MISERABLE souls from this little place called Hell.  The videotape just OPENED my eyes to all the glaring errors in the whole idea of evolution...its just NOT true!!!
Me:  Huh.
Her:  Yes, you know what ELSE isn't true?  Carbon-dating!!!  LIES!!!!!  I have another videotape that disproves carbon-dating as well...
Me:  Oooookaaaay  (At this point I was too horrified to stop her...it was like a car wreck...I just couldn't stop listening...)
Her:  Yes, just remember God is our SAVIOR...you know that right?  He is TRUTH and if you do not obey His will you will BURN IN HELL!!!!
Me:  (Trying so hard not to start laughing and completely at a loss for words....)

(Mood shifts again and there she stand in her apparent [but now I knew better] normality, smiling)

Her:  So yes, how much was that?
Me:  Excuse me?
Her:  How much?
Me: Uhhhhhh, $3.75.
Her:  Ok, here you go...well it was so nice meeting you dear...God Bless!
Me: (Weak smile.)


So yeah....people are crazy...Its kind of funny, I didn't think people like that really existed.  Hmmmm well now I know that they sell videotape disproving such bogus theories like oh evolutions and CARBON-DATING?  Who are these people?  Honestly...  I really want to find these tapes.  I want to see how they disprove these things...maybe if she comes in again I'll ask her about it.

I should be able to host a termite colony if i want to.  well maybe not that but yeah you get the point.  so yeah now my moms all pissy and like rawr vacuum the house, the bathroom better be spotless, dont use the computer (ahhhh see?  im being sneaky sara right now....shhhhhh!) and dont call anyone.

(Shhhh dont tell my mommy)  but yeah other than that nothing too exciting...hang out with the kids alot...

btw i think i am totally getting over poker, playing might still be fun but losing definitely isnt.  and watching is boring.  i think im going to take the road less traveled and cash in my chips. hahahah i love mixed metaphors.

anyways rachel we have to watch the mummy two...itll be so scary!!! those damn scarab beetles...

OH OH that reminds me, universal studios was soooo fun!  we have to go back again since i bought a freaking season pass.  but yeah on man it fun stuff...i saw my cousins at jurassic park...they were so happy to see me...here ill tell you what happened.

ok so we enter jurassic park, right?  and we see some nice brontasauruses and i was like hey dude what the hell?  why are you bending all the way down to eat the food on the floor...there a tree like three feet away...but he didnt listen...i think it messed up his neck too cause it was kind of crooked.  ok so we move on and there are some waterfalls triceratops, you know all these peaceful little critters grazing on the wild flora.  So then we keep going and there are those little black tar spitting guys, know what im talking about?   yeah theyre pretty scary but i was like hey man you want to spit at me?  ill spit back and then bite your head off...im a rapter!!!!  so then we go into this cave or whatever and my cousins pop out of the ceiling and are like hey sara whats up?   you are the coolest rapter ever! and so scary, i wish i could make a scary raptor face like you.  but then i was like oh man you cant but its ok, you can still be my cousin.  like joe cho.  but anyways we keep on going and then we see somemore cousins, you know flip the two clawed raptor gang sign then move on...then suddenly a trex pops out of the ceiling and we were like AHHHHHH and then we were done.  it was quite exciting. 

ok yeah then we went on the mummy two...it was so fun...i dont have too much to say about that except that that guy cant whip the pole worth shit and...

YOURE SOUL WILL BE MINE!!!!

"event","Look! Look!  Two days in a row!!!!!  Yay for me.  Well anyways, I went to Warped Tour today with my lovely friends Lan, Robbie, Cory, Steve, Mel, Cape, Fort and we met Katie and some of her friends there.  It was just dandy, I must say.  Coheed was damn good and Thurday was hott, I must admit...also, the potential new singer for Saosin...DAMN, he's hott.  Like really hott.  Like oh-my-god-take-me-now-hott.  By the way I have a story about that...
So, Lan and I are at the Saosin booth and Cove (I guess thats his name) is standing there, nonchalantly, looking fine in his nice button down and sexy hat.  So Lan turns to Cory and says, ""Hey, take a picture of me and that hott guy over there.  Cause he's hott.""   So Cory says fine, and I ask to be in the picture as well.  Lan does not object and we wait while he talks to some annoying girls and its obvious he wants to be rid of them because they are annoying.  And annoying.  Anyways so finally I get sick of waiting around tell them to go away.  Cove, throws a grateful glance my way and gives me a huge hug.  We take the picture and I feel something slip into my pocket.  We all walk away and I take a slip of paper out of my pocket.  Its a note from Cove and his declaration of love for me.  The End.
Actually none of that happened.  But I wish it did.  Oh well.  But yeah Warped Tour was great and I loved it.  It was great.  But yeah I'm tired cause so I'm gonna sleep.  XOXO NIGHT!"

But sadly enough I have a feeling that this will be a short entry due to the fact it is 2:22 and i am getting a little sleepy.  But I shall try to manage.

Oh so, the wonderful days of summer...working!!!!!  And oddly enough, my bank account is really not getting any larger.  At all.  *Sigh.*  Oh well.  Yes, but since I can't (or choose not to) summerize everything that has happened to me since my last delusional entry, I will tell you what I did today.

I woke up at 11:45 to eat sushi and tempura ice cream...YUM!!!
I went back to sleep as soon as I went home and woke up at like three when my evil mother made more noise than anyone would ever have to walking around the house
Went to go see Napolean Dynamite *FUNNY FUNNY MOVIE*
Uhhhhh came back here and did nothing.

"event","There is an ant sitting in a tree.  He is on the very uppermost part of the tree, sitting on the highest leaf.  The ant looks down and becomes frightened.  He is afraid to climb down because he is a pathetic little ant and is scared of heights.  How he got up into the tree in the first place is a mystery.  We don't know how it happened.  Hence, it is a mystery.  Anyways, back to the ant.  His name is Griffin.  Kind of like Gryffindor in Harry Potter, but without the -dor, and spelled slightly differently.  Now, Griffin is looking down at the ground and he spots a grain of sugar.  Suddenly there is incentive to climb down the tree, because he is hungry and that grain of sugar is starting to look pretty damn appetizing.  (For all you people wondering how exactly Griffin has good enough eyesight to see a grain of sugar, he has a pair of binoculars).  So hungry Griffin licks his chops and resolves to go down and get that grain of sugar.  But suddenly clouds roll in and Griffin is bombarded by raindrops.  Which is actually good because our little ant friend had not taken a shower ever in his life.  So he exfoliated.  With some bark.  And soon his little exoskeleton was glowing.  Anyways, it stopped raining and he went down and got the sugar and ate it.   The end."

"event","Oh man.  What a day.  Well after having big plans for working on my color pencil, i instead took at nap around 2ish and woke at 4, grrrrrr, took a shift for one of my coworkers who couldnt make it -- im so nice.  anways i worked a 5 to 10 (well actually 1030 ) shift and must say i am greatly fatigued after washing EVERYTHING in that freaking store.  I am telling you, if anyone is worried about cleanliness at Jamba, worry no more, we practically disinfect the fucking fruit.  Actually no we don't that would be gross but we clean like every possible thing that can be cleaned.  Every night.  Oh and a little hint to all you who have never used that steel wool stuff before -- wear gloves.  Yes, wear thick gloves.  I was cleaning the deconstructed wheatgrass machine with steel wool, mind you my hands were bare and about ten minutes later, a co-worker walks up and stares at me washing the wheatgrass machine.  Then he informs me that at that very minute, my skin was being ripped apart by the steel wool, and that i might want to wear gloves.  Thanks, ten minutes later.  Well thank god i have manly callousy hands or else i would be very unhappy right now.  I still am unhappy cause it hurts a wee bit, but not enought to cry about it.  ANYWAYS, damn i should be trying to be a good student and work on my art project but you know, i really just dont feel like it.  I think i might go sleep now....that sounds good.  Yes.  Sleep.  Well thats all. BYE BYE!"

I've mostly been sitting around eating and sleeping.  Like a sloth.  Dude those things are SO CUTE.  They are perhaps my new favorite animal, I don't know, sorry elephants and monkeys.  But yeah anyways this weekend was the best, lots and lots of very good fun.

Friday was exciting, went to the Tacit show, then got forced out early cause something.  I don't really remember.  You know how it goes.  But yes, Tacit was excellent as always, James and Scotty you guys are the best.  Ok, so then Saturday Sara got in BIG TROUBLE cause she thought she was supposed to be at work at 2:30, but actually was supposed to be at work at 9 and leave at 2:30, needless to say, the manager was not so happy.  Luckily though I have a nice, understanding manager who does not yell and it was ok.  Just as long as I NEVER DO IT AGAIN.  Ok, so work was great, really really great, I was allowed to clean under the sink which consists of me on my hands and knees on the dirty floor with bits of old fruit and god knows what floating around on the flooded tiles.  Then I have to contort my body to reach under the sink and scrub the floor with Ajax....yeah definitely the highlight of my day.  It was gross.  And I didn't like it.  Because it was gross.  But yeah Saturday night was the best!  Many cheers and thanks to Scotty for letting us hang out with him at his beachhouse....let me tell you it was good times.  Not that I really remember much past, oh say 12....yeah...But yes of that I do remember, here is a list...

1.  Chewy fruit snacks....straaaawberry
2.  A very INTERESTING movie...ahhhh I must say it WAS action-packed and very thrilling.
3.  Trying to push over Fausto, and not succeeding at all.
4.  Shirley Temples...
5.  Robbie's feet....(yeah get your laughs all you people who witnessed that... I was dismayed and confused...leave me alone!)
6.  Walking down that fucking flight of stairs every five minutes to go pee.

Yup so that was that.  The next day was fun too.  Went ino the frigid water and became numb...gotta love that...

Anyways we eventually got home and I slept...big surprise there.  Hey but I actually got some colored pencil done which is pretty amazing, knowing my work ethic.  Yup so thats all for now...until the next year that I update!   Hugs and Kisses!!!!"

"event","Ok ok ok, yes I know I have been absolutely terrible with this journal nonsense...just horrible.  Its been years since my last entry but you know this past like month has just been insane.  So I'm really going to try to be more diligent now.  I promise.  Yay for all you cool people who read this, that would be ummmm no one.  Haha anyways.

Yes, so brief chronology of whats been going on....

Ok, so school has been absolutely crazy what with thesis papers and calculus finals -- failing all, by the way.

Also college stuff is not cool, got accepted to UCSD, LMU, spring semester at Berkeley (not going THERE) and thats all.  Three out of four isn't too bad.  But yes, parents are majorly getting on my back about financial aid, etc.  Maybe if I ignore problems they will go away.  But I am really guessing that that does not happen.

Oh oh!!! Also working now, at the Jamba Juice in the Pavilions shopping center.  So if you want to visit me at work in my cute little Jamba outfit DO IT.  (Making money is really really wonderful, I have decided.)

Finally the most eventful part of this month has been my personal life.  Ahhhhhhh, yes as most all of you know, Robbie and I have broken up for sure after 1 wonderful year and are now ""just friends.""  Its been very hard and is still very very very very hard, but you can't make someone love you (ha, unfortunately) so that is that.  (But of course he's been very sweet about most everything and he's happier now so thats good.)

Ok, so moving on...today we went to see the show tonight and I love Pale New Dawn now.  They are just dandy and I am going to try to go to most of their shows as well as my other favorite band Tacit.  Yay!  Hahha, but no life is very interesting right now, but I'm dead tired and having issues articulating my thoughts into words.  So that will be all for this time.  I promise I'll update again soon."

Anyways -- this weekend is going to be bundles and bundles of fun and good times!!!  Or at least maybe it will be, I'm going to have to tell you after it happens.  So -- as it is, I am going to have shrimp tonight.  Because I just cleaned it and it smells like shrimp and so I smell like shrimp actually though I didn't just clean it, I cleaned it like three hours ago but whatever, after cleaning the shrimp I went to the gym where I encountered all of the ex-cheerleaders who went to Hart last year but are now going to COC.  They're all really buff and it scares me.  But ok so then I took a shower, not after checking the mail for LMU which I think is discriminating against me on the basis of I'm Asian and non-religious.  Well I'm half Asian anyways.  And so I took a shower and here I am.  Wow, I have an inkling that this is going to be one of those delirious entries where I randomly talk about uninteresting stuff that happens to me.  Hmmmmmmm what can I tell you that's interesting and that happened to me...ummmmmmm yeah.  Wow, this is really sad.  Anyways *trying desperately to remain positive and upbeat* I'm looking for a job, but probably no one will hire me because I'm Asian and non-religious and I can't afford it anyways -- oh wait, no, thats LMU.  Right.  So.  Job.  OH FUCK!  Scholarships scholarships, just got a cold chill down my back, one's due tomorrow, shit, well I guess thats all for now because I desperately need to do that."

"event","Well.  So.  Yesterday I was at Robbie's house and he was poking me with one of those giant foam fingers?  You know?  And so I tried to grab it from him, slipping and losing my balance on the hardwood floors only to hit the area between my eye and my temple VERY HARD on the corner of the nearby T.V.  A swelling bulge (ooooh see that just sounds bad) popped out of the side of my head and it hurt.  Alot.  And it was ugly.  Yet today, not a mark remained.  It must have been through the constant (very constant) diligence of my caring boyfriend who insisted that the ice pack MUST be on my face for an hour and a half that there was no sign of the injury.  But hey, there's no bruise or anything so many thanks to my darling.  

Today it was rainy.  (Oh and on a side note, Bruce left me.  I think he'd rather brave the cold of the rain than listen to me talk.)  Where was I?  Oh yes, today was rainy.  So I decided it was a good day to make cookies and such.  I wrote a poem conveying the struggle of the bake:

The determined baker she does measure
Flour and sugar, with no time for leisure
Two eggs?  Or one?
This is not much fun
As she frettingly stirs the messy gook
One can see she is not much of a cook

 The sticky dough she does clump
Into oddly shaped little lumps
She struggles and sighs
And wishes to cry
For she knows in her heart that the cookies will die

She puts the tray into the ominous oven
Hoping her cookies will get some lovin  (Can you think of anything that rhymes with oven?)
But as she anxiously waits
Her tears abate
Because she has accepted the fact
That in cookies baking she lacks

Finally the wait is over
She need more luck than a four leaf clover
As she pulls the cookies out
She starts to pout
Because the cookies suck
And now shes going to make brownies!!!
YAY!


Yeah so that was my poem.  I know, I know, I should get published but I think I want to go to college before I decide to start my career as a poet.  Anyways I am done for now, as you all know my cookies are terrible (Ahhhh, I can never even aspire to reach the Rachel pinnacle of cookie making)  but my brownies are decent.  So I made some of those as well.  You know.  To make up for the other stuff.  But anyways thats all for now, I REALLY REALLY have to start doing stuff or I never will.

"event","Well you know... its that time again.  Here is Sara being angry and craving masses of chocolate.  I'm really really really wanting some fudge about now.  Sounds sooooo good, doesn't it?

Well haven't heard from any colleges yet.  Also am despairing about scholarships seeing as I've done HAHAHAHA none and its all my fault so its not like I can blame anyone else.  Hell, I should be doing one right now.  Does anyone know two teachers who will do letters of reccomendation a week before?  Yeah, no?  Thats what I thought.  Well I'm screwed.  And I'm not going to ever be able to finish college.  Or I will but will be in debt until I'm fifty so the way I see it, I might as well not go to college and get a job now.

Ok, I'm done bitching and raging.  Now for more lighthearted subjects.  There is a large spider that I found next to my closet this morning.  I came home this afternoon and he was still there.  I've been talking to him lately -- he is a very good listener and never ever tells me to shuttup or anything like that.  I have named him Bruce.  We have a mutual type relationship, I give him comfortable surroundings and he has to listen to me talk.  Well maybe not so mutualistic...poor Bruce.  But I have warned him that if he gets too close to my bed, I might have no other choice but to relocate him to the great wilderness outdoors.  He twitched a leg so I think we have a good understanding about what is expected in this relationship.  I'm beginning to wonder if Bruce is dead though seeing as he has not moved for many hours.  I hope not.  That would be sad.

Speaking of sad things, I haven't done any Lit yet.  I WILL BE MOTIVATED!!!  I will do my work like a good little girl and form good habits that I will benefit from for the rest of my life.  Ok.  So now that I've decided that, I must say that that movie in Econ sucks big time.  It sucks so much I don't even want to discuss it other than to say that it sucks.  So -- it sucks and I am done on that topic.  Actually I'm done on all topics because I think I'm going to go do some homework, maybe.  CIAO!

Robbie -- Awww man.  (I'm so cute, you know you love me!)
Rach -- Congrats on LMU you smart girl you!!  (Did you notice that rhymed?)
Lan -- We don't invite you to poker because really we all know that you have mad poker skills and we don't want our money taken away.  Hahahaha right.
Mel -- STAY AWAY RABID PINK EYED MONKEY!!!
Faust -- How do the women and children die excruciating, painful deaths?"

Mmmmm I really want to eat some cookie dough right now but that would require me actually making the cookies which is not going to happen.  I went to the Green Thumb today and bought some plants and flower seed for my garden.  Yes, my beautiful garden, and no I am not going to pull out all the wildflowers which some of you have insultingly called weeds.  But yes anyways this weekend was much fun:

Friday I went snooooooowboarding with Robbie, Katie and Steve.  It was great.  As Robbie called it we ""extreme snowboarded"" which consisted of us snowboarding and trying to throw snowballs at each other at the same time.  Not a very good idea.  I fell very hard and it hurt alot.  The funny thing was that I wasn't even trying to throw it, I was just trying to hold onto the damn thing.  But yes, it was really nice, the snow was good, which is a rarity at Mountain High.  Also afterwards we had another snowball fight, but a normal one this time and that was gaiety and laughs all around.  Hahaha no, Katie threw like a chunk of ice at Steve kind of hard, which kind of sucked but she didn't really think it was going to hurt so it was kind of funny.  Then we came home and...oh yeah went to my house and watched Interview With A Vampire.  Good stuff.

Saturday was Valentine's Day as you all know and I started off the day playing tennis with my Daddy in a tournament and we got second place!!!  Out of three teams!!! YEAH!  No, but it really was fun and hey, second is better than third.  So yeah after that I came home and did stuff then got ready to go out at night with robbie and so I did.  Then he came over and we exchanged gifts (I GOT THE KISSY BEARS!!!) and roses very nice, then we went to dinner at Don Cucos which was yummy stuff.  Then we went back to his house and watched TV and just hung out.  It was a nice comfortable V-Day.

Then yesterday I babysat for like 5 hours then played poker at Mel's which is always fun.  Good stuff, made two dollars ( I know, making the big money) then went home and slept.

So here I am today, bored and planning to clean my room which I eventually will.

Thats all for now, BYE."

I can't garner the energy to move anything but my fingers as they are typing, so, alas, I am afeared that I will spend the rest of my days here, oozing in my chair like a slug.  I can hardly even make my eyes focus to read the very words i am typing and I really don't know whether its lack of food or sleep deprivation.  But anyways, heres what happened to me today.

I stayed in bed til eleven, woke up and ate some chocolate and bacon, then watched TLC for the rest of the day.

No, that didn't happen but it would be fun if it did.  I actually got up (amazingly) and got my boy a breakfast burrito.  Yes, it is true, Sara can be thoughtful every now and then.  Then I did the whole school thing which wasn't too exciting, I actually think its quite overrated.  After school I went over to the the boy's house and fell asleep and then woke up to find that robbie also was alseep.  So I stayed there and watched Clean Sweep until my darling mother called and yelled at me.  To come home.  So I did.  So I am here.  Damn, you know they should make a movie of my life, no, of my day, it was just that exciting.  Haaaaa.  But yeah I think im going to crawl over to the kitchen and find some sustenance cause my tummy is hurting.

I've resolved to do at least half, but for everybody who knows me knows my resolve is not quite as strong as my need for sleep.  We can't all be Rachels and Faustos.  Saras get tooooooo cranky if they don't get their alotted amount of repose.  As well as food, but I've had well enough of that today.  Mmmmmm but right now I'm desperately craving some ice cream.  But if I leave the computer, it lessens the likelihood of me doing my thesis paper, which haha isn't likely to happen anyways so maybe I should eat my ice cream.  But now I'm rambling so I'll try to make more sense.  Which is about as likely to happen as my thesis paper!  HAHAHAHA.  Oooooook.

Yeah but you know that feeling when you're taking a test and you don't know the entire second half?  And you sit there, very amused, as you pretend to try to figure out a problem because you figure while you're there you might as well try.  But there's really no point to it, because as much as you pretend to know what you're doing, you really don't.  So you just stop pretending and look around the room for others in the same plight as you...only to discover that everyone in the class is industriously picking apart calculus problems while you watch the clock and play eenie-meenie-miny-mo.  Yeah, well that happened to me today.

But yes that is all I really want to talk about right now!  Ciao.

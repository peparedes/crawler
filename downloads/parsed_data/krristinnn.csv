"event","<p>This weekend was okay, not one of my best.<br />I spent it with my sister, learning how to take care of my nicec.<br /><br />The funny thing is, when you hold her on your chest and look at her, she goes cross eyed casue she is trying to focus.<br /><br />MMhm, she is 3 weeks and a day.<br />shes so cute :D<br /><br />And then when i got home, UHH my dad was rip fucking shit.<br />He was yelling at me for having a bad day.&nbsp;<br />and then he told me that my mom and him&nbsp;had a court date, and its to see where things are going.<br />and He forgot to tellme that i had to go and answer ""Do you feel comfortable living there?""<br /><br />Fuck no i dont.<br />He doesnt repsect me.<br />BUUUTT anyways.<br /><br />Sabrina and I are....umm....well....uhh.<br />i have no word to describe it.<br />We arent actually fighting, but at the same time we arent Bestfriends.<br />I just really hope things turn out alright.<br />I mean, it took a lot for me to tell her how i felt.<br />I asked both my Sister, Brother-in-law and Mom on what i should do, and they both told me to tell her how i felt.<br />They didnt tell me to go see her more offten or call her more often, cause they think she should not ""overreact"" about me not seeing her as much.<br /><br />And i think this whole thing is becasue i am not there for her.<br />wow.<br /><br />you know how much that affected me when she told me that?<br />I started to ball my eyes out.<br />I couldnt believe i was such a bad friend, causing this pain on my Bestfriend.<br />i started to blame everything on myself, which i still am casue FYI, i casued this for both of us. and its so true, cause im such a fucking dumb ass and couldnt fucking do anything.<br /><br /><br /><br />so that was when i was over my sisters house, when she told me.<br />and my sister started to freak out cause she didnt know what was wrong, so i talked to her.<br />And she gave me some great advice.<br />thats what i love about her.<br />She said that i shouldnt matter how much im there for her or not, what should matter is if i love her or not.<br /><br />but i still think i casued all this crap to happen.<br />cause im stupid.<br />and a bad friend.<br />no wonder i get dropped like a fucking dime.<br /><br />w.e<br />im trying to fix this one. and i hope it works.<br /><br /><br /></p>"

and i dont know what.

Today was soo fun.
Besides for waking up at 6am and going to school.
Emily wasnt there for half the day, it was so boring.
Then she came at lunch, and it wasnt boring anymore.

And after school, we went the the Volley ball game.
We painted numbers on our cheeks of friends that played on the team.
And my friend Alex made letters that spelled out ""Go Parkside Volley Ball""
and we had enough people to hold each letter.
Does our school have a lot of team spirit or what?

And after that, Emily and i got attacked by this dude who played on the other team.
And hes like ""You two are my new bestfriends"" and we were like ""Hell yeahh""
and hes like ""Kristin, callll ,me :D""

lmao, best day
I got my new laptop.
My desk feels so empty.
Cause i had a huge computer, now i have a small little laptop :D
that can go ANYWHERE!
even the moon.

I think....
cause tomorrow, it will probably be blonde.

"event","Okay. im really puzzled on something. 
and im not usually confused about anything dealing with people. 

Well, i just feel like i lost so much in the past couple weeks. 
I mean, i should feel happy because my sister just had a new baby, and im an aunt. 
But no, i feel awful all the time, like someone just died or something. 

And here is the reason (more then one actually) 
I never get to see sabrina, and i think she is getting sick of it. 
Because we like never talk, and really i do try to get a hold of her. 
And i want to spend as much time with her as possible because, i mean, she is my best friend. 
I love her to death, and never want to let her go anytime for any reason. 
Not death, moving nor us not being friends again. 
Nothing can not make me think of her as my bestfriend. 

And also, i was told by my therapist (or whoever you spell it) that im depressed. 
i was told this back in the summer, but i didnt see any of it until now. 
Its nothing that can be treated with medication, or anything, i just have to ""get my life in check"". 
he said its all&nbsp;&nbsp;because of stress with friends, the pressure to see them all the time, and to ""worry"" about them. 
Because i worry about my friends alot, and its true i do, even the smallest problem i worry about. 
I also have anxiety (I CANT SPELL).&nbsp; 
Its where im worried all the time, ahah go figure. 


What ever, i dont believe that bull, but i dont care. 
My life just seems so empty, ya know? 
Like its always home and school, home and school, everyday. 
So yeah, my sister had her baby, finally! 
it was born on March 25, 2007 at 12:12pm. 
she was 8 lbs 10.5 oz and 20 in. 
Her name is Camryn :D 

I think i only feel comfortable when im with my big sister, jessica. 
She is like the only one i feel comfortable around. 
I love being at her house, cause its umm....comfortable? 

Well, i guess my life is getting better. 
The IRS problem is all gone and done with. 
and my dad got a new car. 
and hes doing good with his jobs. 

I never get to see my mother though. 
She's in her own little world up north somewhere. 
She lives 40 minutes away, great for me huh? 
She doesnt even have her own place, so i cant go up and vist and sleep over. 
She lives with her friend Sherry and her Husband Whit. 
wtf? now im supposed to live without a fucking mother? 
Wow! thats good for a teenage fucking girl. 

And i have really given up on tryyying to find someone. 
Its no use. 
Im too tall - guys dont like that, unless they are 17 or older, and which they possible already have a girlfriend. 
and im too smart, and mature for my age - and which i know how to take care of myself. 
but i dont want to sound like a prick. 

Well. 
i hope life gets better. 

until next time&lt;3"

"event","Its true. All of last week and the beggining of this week, i slept in my own bed probably 3 times.
I hate being in my house. My dad is being so weird.

For you who don't know what im talking about.
My mom left the house about a week ago, and she is living with&nbsp; my Grandma until&nbsp;she can find out what to do.
And my Dad is being all ""Oh we dont need your mom, look how good we are doing"" moods.
he wants to make sure we dont talk to our sister or our mom about whats going on.
He listens in to our conversations with them.

Its weird.
And they are probably going to get a divorce, and im glad,&nbsp; cause im sick of everything.
If they do, i want to live with my mom hands down.
But its hard to tell your own dad that.

LIFE IS SO HARD.
grrrrr.

Anyway.
nothing really happened today.
a normal day.
Ah, i got Physical Education for a Special.
I HATE PE. with a huge passion.
I just dont like changing out of my clothes in school.

psssh, nothing else.
We get report cards on Friday.
Im glad cause i know i did really well this Quarter."

i&nbsp;have come to the conclution that when&nbsp;i get older, all that im going to do is work.
Why you may ask?
Because all i ever do is work now.
what makes a difference when im older?

The real thing that is bothering me is that i haven't seen my friends like over 3 weeks.
And one of them being my bestfriend.
You know how hard that is?
Not knowing if they forgot about me, or moved on thinking that i dont care?
It hurts, a lot.

And i hate working ALL WEEK LONG.
and then i have crap to do on the weekends, or i just cant get together with them.
Its been like that for the past month.
And i hate it with a passion.

Whenever i do talk to one of my friends, i feel like its like when we first met, you know really akward and you dont know what to say.
I feel like they have forgotten about me.
And it sucks, cause its kinda my fault.
Ive been worried about myself, and my grades, and my basket ball, and not really seeing my friends that much.

Am i just a bad friend?
a bad bestfriend?
a bad person?

I always put my friends and family before anything in my life, but lately, i have been putting my grades and me before them.
And im being self-centered.

i hope they forgive me...."

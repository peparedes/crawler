"event","This will probably make no sense at all to folks who don't larp, and precious little to folks who do, but I just got jolted out of a sound sleep by a dream that managed to combine a 'end of game, final battle for all the marbles' larp moment with a heavy dose of 'ohmigod its final exams and I haven't studied at all'.

Anyhow.  There were four groups of people, of us, with excessively elaborate Jack Kirby versions of medieval outfits except for the ones in wild west gear.  And we were told to form up for the final battle. And even though I was wearing what in retrospect was like a green-yellow version of Boba Fett armor I decided to go with the gunslingers, which they treated as Very Significant (while in my brain I was like ""Okay? I guess?"")  And it was dusk and autumn when we started walking, but just a minute later it was night and there was snow on the ground (I remember part of me being impressed by the larp's special effects), and they were all talking softly about how dangerous the fight was about to be, which was getting ME worked up.....when all of a sudden we turn a corner and my friend Veronica leapt out of the darkness and yelled, ""Brian!!  The Widow Lawson is DEAD!!!""

And there was just this moment of dead silence, while in my brain there was this surge of ""Oh crap, for Plot to do this now, that must be a Hugely Significant Fact...and <i>I have no idea who that is.</i>""  And the adrenaline rush was enough to knock me completely awake.

And the worst part is, now I'll never know what the heck that whole plotline was about or why the Widow Lawson was so significant."

"event","Question of the day: <i>Have you watched World War Z?  If you have, what's your disease of choice? </i>

I have not yet seen it.  I've loved the book and the audiobook, but I know the movie is a very, very different beastie.

However, I just read <lj user=bending_sickle>'s excellent and frothy review, so I think I know where you're going with this question.  

SPOILER ALERT:

As I understand it, in the movie zombies will avoid anyone diseased.  So you have a scenario where what's left of the world population has to infect themselves with something in order to survive, but it has to be something that doesn't make you so sick you WISH a zombie killed you.

My first choice was Sydenham's Chorea, the Saint Vitus Dance disease, for the simple reason that I love the thought of the solution to the zombies being a huge global dance party.  But (shockingly!) the disease doesn't actually work like an LMFAO video.  In fact, once I got to the sentence that said ""Other neurologic symptoms include behavior change, dysarthria, gait disturbance, loss of fine and gross motor control with resultant deterioration of handwriting, headache, slowed cognition, facial grimacing, fidgetiness and hypotonia"" I was beginning to think that this was what the *zombies* actually had.

So I'm going to go with Acquired Hypertrichosis.  (Which is technically just a side effect of something else going wrong in the body, but I'm sure our wonks at the NIH can figure out a way to make it work.)  Or, as they're bound to call it in the movie, werewolf disease.
<img alt="""" border=""0"" title="""" src=""http://hairtx.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/hypertrichosis-5-256x300.jpg"" />

I mean, c'mon!  It does no harm apart from kicking the hair production into overdrive. It will make life very, very interesting as people try to figure out new beauty standards.  More than that, though, there's just something so <i>right</i> about the line ""The only way to save the human race from the zombie plague is to unleash* this new werewolf plague!""  That is GOLD.

"event","Random Question: <i>Would you rather take a squid or a hummingbird into outer space?</i>

""That depends"" is an awful answer to almost any question*, but I feel like I have to wheel it out here because, well, spaceship design.  Would I want a squid in the Apollo 11 capsule?  Would the squid want to be there?  Would it have made for really fascinating NASA footage?  No, no, and yes omg now I need a gif of Buzz Aldrin and a squid colliding in zero-gee are the answers to these question.

So let's make a couple of ground rules:  big ship, with enough food and air that relative size isn't the deciding factor.  Artificial gravity.  Modified genetics or tech so that the squid could breathe without being confined to a tank of water, and....this is tricky...so that both the squid and hummingbird are uplifted to a point where their intelligence and communication skills make them capable of functioning as crew members.  

**<i>There is now a 30 minute pause while the author searches the internet for fanart of either a squid or a hummingbird wearing a Federation uniform.  A search for 'star trek + squid' takes you down some strange rabbit holes, people.</i>


ANYhow.

With all that said and done...I'm still torn.

SQUID
<img alt="""" border=""0"" title="""" src=""http://th08.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2010/303/d/f/trek_squids_by_pancakes_no_jutsu-d31u5gm.jpg"" width=""200"" />

Pro:
Amazingly good at multi-tasking
Intimidation factor
Boneless nature allows them to squeeze into small spaces.  That + the tentacles + speedy multi-limbed propulsion = EXCELLENT shipboard security.  
The whole hentai thing
Already pretty darn smart


Con:
Possible connections to Cthulhu
The whole hentai thing
Squid use of rapid changes of skin color and patterns to communicate may either cause trouble in communicating with humans or create a whole new branch of human body modification
Already pretty darn smart PREDATORS
Perceived pro-whale bias and grumpiness about treatment of world oceans has potential for shipboard tension and even eventual mutiny, in which case all those pros become cons really really quickly



HUMMINGBIRD
<img alt="""" border=""0"" title="""" src=""http://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/blogs/lists/2008/11/17/4-BrianDespain-TheExchange.jpg"" />

Pro:
Fast
Very small.  You can fit an entire colony of hummmingbirds in a starship designed for humans.
ZOMG SO FAST
Cute, too
Manueverable
Have I mentioned the speed?  I think I need to mention it again.  FAST.


Con:
Here's the problem: fast creatures don't perceive themselves as fast, they perceive normal creatures as 

moving



very








slow






l




y.

See how annoying that was?  Now imagine if you were a hummingbird in a mixed-species crew, and every single conversation was like that.  A boring hour-long meeting takes on a new level of horror when your heart beats 1240 times a minute and you're never more than a few hours away from either starving to death or falling into torpor.  A Star Trek'ian five year mission would be the equivalent of a <b>70</b> year mission for hummingbirds.  And say if you tried to compensate for that by bringing a whole colony of them along...now they're enhanced enough, what if their society changes at the same fast rate as their biology?  It would be like an advanced race beaming up a town of Dust Bowl farmers, taking a nap, and then waking up to find their spaceship full of hippies.



WINNER:


Hummingbirds would be fantastic scouts.  And hackers, now that I think about it.  And gamers.  And moderators of internet comment sections.  But when I think of outer space it's all about slowness and majesty...watching a moon gradually coming into view over the rings of Saturn, or hanging motionless and watching the clouds of Jupiter swirling down below.  There's a reason they didn't use ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" for the Star Wars theme.

Also, sooner or later we'll run into robot space sharks.  And I think we all know who we want in our corner then:

"event","Random Question #1:  <i>Do you like peas?</i>

I do...however, I have to confess I like the growing and prepping of them more than I actually like eating them.

Peas are FUN.  They're especially fun when you're a small child.  The poles for them in the garden are taller than you are, and you get to watch the vines twine upwards and keep an eye on each pod as it grows. (Compare that to carrots, where you never really know WHAT'S going on, no matter how many times you dig them up to check.)   And then once they're ready, the shucking process is very kid-friendly. Maybe the first cooking chore I ever remember doing is being given a tin pan and a paper bag and taught how to pop the pod open and run my thumb down the inside to get the peas out, and the satisfying ""ping! pung! plang!"" as each pea came loose and fell into the bowl.  

But once they're cooked and on your plate, the kid-friendliness ends.  The suckers ROLL, yo.  Yet some families expect you to eat them with your fork.  Otherwise sane families.  Families who would never look at you and say, ""Oh I see you're eating Cocoa Puffs. You should use a fork for those!"" or, ""Blueberries? Eww, don't use your fingers!  Eat each one with our specially-designed blueberry spike.""  Families who believe in clean plates, families who want their suppers to last less than an hour: please reconsider making small children eat peas with a fork.  (Or have a large dog under the table.)"

"event","Intercon M happened!  And while outside of game there were a few off-notes that made me aware that my mingle-and-socialize muscles have gotten alarmingly atrophied, each and every larp I was in was awesome.

There was one thing in particular that threw me for a loop, and I think it's a good illustration of how larps can have unique strengths as a game/event/artform.  Saturday night I played in <i>Teenage Mystery Dance Party</i>, a game where ALL the teen characters from the Hanna Barbera cartoons get together in the same mansion for a big party.  I was part of Team Speed Buggy; the Scooby Doo gang was well-represented, as was Team Speed Racer, Josie and the Pussycats, and even the Jabberjaw group managed to travel back in time from their usual setting to take part (and try to protect their timeline from alien invasion by Zorak's mantis-people).  And most of the game was the sort of madcap set of escapades that you'd expect--chase scenes!  People in flimsy costumes trying to scare away meddling kids!  A battle of the bands!  A road race!  Plus all the cross-pollination you'd expect from the different shows, with Jabberjaw getting his fins on some Scooby snacks and Speed Buggy and Speed Racer teaming up to trap a villain by blinding him with headlights.  Hijinxalicious!

And THEN.

Now, here's the most beautiful thing of all: as far as I know, none of this happened because of anything any of the 5 GMs did. It just grew organically.  Valerie from the Pussycats and Velma from Scooby Doo had teamed up to create a device that would increase someone's intelligence because, let's face it, every team had at least one character who could really use it.  But out of everyone, by far the dumbest character (and this is a testament to the player's acting ability) was Bubbles from Team Jabberjaw.  How dumb?  She had a special ability called ""Too dumb to be scared"" that kept her from running away when a monster appeared.  When she was asked if she'd like to help with the experiment she thought they were saying spearmint and offering her gum, so they zapped her, and she went from being the most clueless person in the very large room to being (and this is <i>another</i> testament to the player's acting ability) by far the smartest.  Which, considering that Hanna Barbera likes to stock each its teams with at least one gadgeteer/brain/Clueful person, is saying something.  So the teen genius group welcomed its new member and/or developed instant crushes, and all was well.

And then we all realized that the effect was <i>temporary</i>.  

In the last half hour of the game, with almost all of our special abilities used up, we'd just entered/created Flowers for Algernon: the LARP.  

I can't really describe the honest panic as the smartest characters from four different shows pooled their brainpower to try to figure out how to help Bubbles, who was (have I mentioned this was a good player?) losing her intelligence bit by bit and getting more and more distressed as people came up and asked her questions that she knew she <i>used</i> to know the answers to.  We were in the last 90 seconds of game when we got everyone together with what we hoped was a functioning device that would make her intelligence permanent...turned it on...and saw <b>everyone from Team Jabberjaw suddenly vanish.</b>  And then GAME END.  With none of us knowing whether we'd saved her brain, or <b> erased her entire timeline.</b>

<i>This game was supposed to be my light, fluffy vacation from the angst of the other larps!</i>

(For the record, during the post-game wrap-up the lead GM confirmed that Bubbles and the rest of Team Jabberjaw had just gone back to their own time. Except they'd also never been here in the first place, so they hadn't won the Battle of the Bands.  Except we remembered them.  I think.  By that point in the night I was a little wiped out.)"

A vote for Candidate for SALON INSPECTOR in South Middlesex County AMANDA'S SISTER, APUMPKINDA is a vote to support her and her hubby's Cokecaine dealer! Wasn't her purse recovered last year by Cambridge Health Alliance Security and a small baggie of Cokecane was discovered inside of it? Hospital Security then contacted a Somerville Police officer after going through the purse and finding her id card and driver's license who in turn swept it under the rug for her and her friends in the press along with Somerville Police officers that work for her and she controls thier payroll budget squashed that story for her didnt they? It must be nice? Please look into this and it with surface sooner than you think. The security guard is now all of a sudden going public with it. ANYBODYTA blammed her nephew and will turn this into an addiction problem for the kid when in fact it's her and her hubby's adiction.  </i>

Several points:

1)  ""Cokecane"".  Just....cokecane.

2) It took me four readings of this just to understand what the hell was going on.  Not to harp on the fact that Craigslist has a superior sort of crazy, but over there 'Donnie' has spent the last 9 years complaining daily that the parks need a sunset curfew enforced with horses and barricades to keep ""the Gays"" from ""partying"".  Compared to this, Donnie is Marcel Proust. 

3) On the other hand, it's amazing what a cast of characters has cropped up in seven sentences.  Which of them is the spammer??  Was it the security guard, furious that his attempt to bust a cokeycain user was ignored by the po-po?  The nephew, seeking revenge for being blamed?  A bold reporter who, after having their story spiked thanks to this diabolical politician's network of compliant local media-types, has decided that this is their last best chance to spread the Truth?  It, of course, can't be one of the other candidates up for this job in the primary next week. 

4) WHY LJ??  Did their first idea, to give this candidate a bad Yelp review, not pan out?"

"event","Dear LJ,

At this time tomorrow I'll have gone to a far, far better place.  

Which isn't hard, as at the moment I'm sitting here at a very messy desk in the dark in underwear and my thick wool coat because it's a) before sunrise and very cold and yet I'm b) too lazy to actually put pants on.

As usual before a big trip my head is spinning with questions, and this isn't just a normal trip but DISNEY WORLD, a place I haven't been to since I was 4 years old.  Agh, SO many questions:  Have we not planned enough?  Did we overplan?  Should I be calling their hotline right now and desperately making restaurant reservations?  Will it be a ghost town? Will it be too cold?  Will it be too hot? What will I do if my name is accidentally on a 'do not fly' list and I'm left at the airport?  Does my new haircut make my head look like a particularly blobby pineapple?

....to be fair, I'd be asking that last question anyhow.

Anyhow, what it all boils down to is that we're about to leave for three days of close encounters with giant mice, and I'm ridiculously excited about it.

The interesting thing is that even though, as mentioned, I was 4 at the time my memories of Disney World are oddly vivid.  And a <i>lot</i> of them, I hate to say, are of me having toddler meltdowns.  Of refusing to go near the Haunted Mansion because it looked too scary.  Of refusing to go in the Hall of Energy because there were a lot of people going in but no one coming out, so OBVIOUSLY once you got inside you'd be killed and eaten.  Part of me feels like I should seek out those rides and go on them just as an apology to my parents (who were a little younger than I am now and isn't THAT a kick to the gut to realize?).......and also because, let's face it, the Haunted Mansion is awesome."

A little background first:  my boss's grandson is 3 1/2, and her son and daughter-in-law are artsy folks with Ideas about how to raise young Rowan.  One of the Ideas is that while they won't enforce a total ban on pop culture, they'll draw a line in the sand and ONLY let him watch movies and TV shows that came out before 1960.  So he, being 3 1/2, has been gorging himself on the Three Stooges and Little Rascals.

(Yeah, I know.  I KNOW.)

So last week they had a holiday party and one of their neighbors, a sweet elderly woman, was approached by Rowan.  Rowan with his golden curls and big sweet smile.  Rowan said, ""Ask me what the number after one is!""  So she bent down, her face level with his, and asked ""Rowan, what's the number after one?""

And Rowan gave the answer...which, as Stooges fans will remember, is ""pTOO!"" as he spit in her face."

"event","So it was checkup time last Friday, and I discovered that the health clinic where I go has begun using something called MyChart, that lets me do things like get my lab results myself.

Which, as it turns out, is oddly stressful.  I log in to where all the tests are named, one by one, and I have to click on each one, one at a time, and see what the result of each individual test is.  (Followed by some quick googling to understand what I just read.)  No clue as to whether the test is good news or bad news, no smiley face or little thumbs up/thumbs down icon, so each time I click the link to a new test I find myself holding my breath like I'm at a blackjack table watching the dealer flip the last card over.

It's not fair for me to say that I miss the old days--I'm a bit phone-phobic, and that skyrocketed each time it was the hospital or my doctor calling me. Like, ""Oops, I dropped the phone in the river. AGAIN.""  I guess how I'd like to get my medical results is through some sort of immediate and clear sign.  Like a delivery of flowers, or a puppy holding a card that says ""Your health is PAWsome!""   And if there's some bad news, pretty much the same delivery method, but the news can be like the prize inside a cereal box, only bad.  And by ""cereal box"" I mean bottle of rum.  It can say something like ""Now that you've drunk this far, let's talk about your colon...""  


(Oh, for the record, all the tests came back fine.  Even the ones about my cholesterol intake, which were a bit of a surprise.  )"

***
My sister and I lived in RURAL rural Maine* on property that had two little apple trees that produced sour green apples about the size of a plum...pretty useless as fruit, but as projectiles they were brilliant.  We'd play 'chase tag' where a thrown apple counted as being tagged.



*So rural that another game we played was imitating Radar on M*A*S*H by seeing which of us could hear a car coming down our road first.  Whoever did would yell ""CAR!!!"", which was our cue to run behind the house as it it was a monster coming, and hide until it went past and there was no danger of it seeing us.  You got bonus cred for how far away you could distinguish the sound and know whether it was a logging truck, a dump truck** or a car.

**There were a lot*** of dump trucks on our road because the biggest industry in our town was the gravel plant.****  Yes. Our local industry was making gravel.  We used to love playing in the gravel pits, some of which would collect rainwater in the spring and become homes to hundreds of tadpoles, others of which would stay dry and look like the sort of desolate craters where you'd expect to see Captain Kirk fighting a lizard man.

***Relatively.

Yes.  This man, this unsung genius, created the Can Can Battle.

There's a parallel world out there where the dancers in the movie took this too much to heart and started *really* trying to settle disputes by can canning each other in the alleys behind the studio.  And this spread and spread, so now there are unemployed dancers can can dueling (cee-squaring, they call it) each other all over Los Angeles and New York.  And I want to go to there.

four snowfalls we've had in a little over a month:  winter can be hell on

Or maybe he just really, really, REALLY hates snow.

All I know is that

And he's

out there five or six more times over the next couple of days, because he doesn't just
want his sidewalk shoveled, he wants it BARE, he wants it BEREFT OF SNOW and you know, if that's his thing it's FINE, it's FINE.

But 
<i>scraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaape</i>
HE'S BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET FOR THREE HOURS SCRAPING! THE! SNOW! OFF! THE! PAVEMENT!  

He'll
<i>scraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaape</i>
grind his shovel blade against the 99% bare street four or five times until he's built up enough snow to fill his shovel, and then he'll walk it twenty feet to the big mound of snow he's made on the corner so there'll be two or three minutes of blessed peace, almost long enough that I start to relax and then

"event","1) For something to do over the holiday break, I took out Season One of 'Gilmour Girls' from the library.  I watched an episode yesterday.  I also read two stories from Stephen King's newest book.

Can you guess which one gave me nightmares? Go on, guess.

I don't know what it is.  Well, I might--Deb has a thing about social anxiety, and while she'll watch part of an episode with me there are times where she'll flee the room like a terrier running from a thunderstorm, and it's rubbed off a bit.  And the episode I watched yesterday was particularly bad that way, with a couple breaking up messily and another main character having a high school scandal blow up around her will probably get someone else (the one who was just broken up with) fired for misconduct...even <i>I</i> fled the room at that point.   And last night my dreams took over where the show left off, only with highwaymen robbing people in parking lots with club-sized candy canes as a side bonus.


2) We've also been watching 'Hoarders'.  Which is scary in a totally different way--I can't get through an episode without looking around the room desperately figuring out what I'm going to get rid of first, because it's suddenly obvious things need to go. NOW. EVERYTHING.  

So, related to this I now have three shopping bags full of comic books that wound up in the 'donate' stack after I did my sorting and organizing.  I'd really like to donate them--they're not BAD or I wouldn't have bought them, just not good enough to keep--but I'm not sure where to start.  Comics geeks on my f'list, do any of you have any experience with this?  Librarians and teachers, do you have any ideas?"

FRIDAY:
*I left work early to go pick up the weekend rental car, which meant slogging a quarter mile from the Alewife T stop in the rain.  For a $9.99 a day special, though, I <i>really</i> can't complain.

*We went to Cooking Club, where we tried out Deb's recipes for cheddar popovers (yum!) and garlic & greens soup (umm...healthy!), and my (Gordon Ramsay's, really) recipe for banana mousse with drizzled butterscotch. Which meant making butterscotch, for my first time ever.  Which was AWESOME.  And then afterwards we ate and watched Wallace Shawn play a Ferengi on DS9.


SATURDAY:

*I trimmed the goatee, ran around like a flibbertigibbet (including an emergency trip to Target for a new shirt and tie, and then watching the 'How to Tie a Tie' YouTube video eight times) and generally got all flustered getting ready for <lj user=danctrf> and <lj user=singingrenwench>'s wedding, which was 19 kinds of awesome--they held it on the shore of a lake* in a park**, the wedding party was led in by a bagpiper, the members of the wedding party got thank you puppets of themselves, I managed to shoo a hornet off the arm of the woman next to me without either of us getting stung, THE MEMBERS OF THE WEDDING PARTY GOT PUPPETS OF THEMSELVES!

So yah, pretty much a perfect wedding.


SUNDAY:
*We grabbed the inflatable kayaks, met up with friends in Holyoke and spent some time on the Niantic River, which was windy and peaceful and almost deserted except for some ducks, some big herons, and four ginormous vultures.  I'm not sure just how out of shape I looked in that kayak, but I seemed to be the most interesting thing they'd seen in a long time.  They're BIG.  And part of me kept remembering that vultures have this defense mechanism where if a potential attacker gets too close they throw up on them. And THAT made me wonder just how caustic vulture vomit could be, say on the plastic of an inflatable boat to name one random hypothetical example.  ""So how did he drown?"" the state trooper would ask, and the coroner would say ""Bert, this one's a doozy...""

TODAY:
*We came home and our car was gone.  Which was okay--we'd been hit with that repair bill every car owner dreads, the one twice as much as the actual value of the car, so we decided to donate it to NPR (through the program the Car Talk guys have set up) and go carless for a while.  There was almost no human contact--we called them up, signed over the title and sent it to them, and while we were at work today they came with a tow truck, took our plates off and left them inside our apartment door, and when we got back there was just an empty parking spot in front of our house.  

Which is okay.  Have I mentioned I'm okay with this? I mean, the brakes were going.  And the clutch. And the AC. And the muffler. And one of the brake lights.  And it's not like we NEED a car.  I'm not still 16 years old in rural Maine and a car is my single, solitary ticket to freedom. Sweet, sweet freedom.  With the window down and WBLM (the Rock and Roll Blimp) blaring and the lights of Portland shining off in the distance...

Sigh.

In a few weeks we'll be getting a tax credit form from them, which D assures me will be pretty much useless thanks to the way our taxes are set up.  Frankly, you'd think the least they could do would be to send us some of the NPR swag that donors during their pledge drives get.

"event","I've been wondering what aliens think when they meet superheroes with animal names, like Batman or Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl.  It must really puzzle them.  

I mean, most of the A-list superheroes have names that your standard comic book Universal Translator wouldn't have much trouble with.  Superman, Wonder Woman, The Hulk, Doctor Strange are all pretty self-explanatory.  (The 'Doctor' might be replaced by whatever the local equivalent is, but 'Chieftain of Oddness', say,  would still get the essential point across.)  

Below that you have folks with names that refer to a specific object or piece of technology, like Green Arrow, Plastic Man, Bullseye, Green Lantern (who technically would be more accurately called Green Ring, but that's a whole other topic)--all things which would give some of our own cultures trouble, but hopefully they'd be able to find local equivalents.

Animal names, though...at best, they're very arbitrary. (""You're called Tigra because you look like a tiger. Got it. You're called Catwoman because you act a little bit like some stereotypes of a cat. Um, okay.  You, you're called Black Canary because you don't fly, are not actually black, but you DO sing?  Riiiiiight.  And you're called Nightcrawler.....um...never mind. Just never mind."")  And at worst, well, what would the alien equivalent of Batman be?  ""I am QUORLMAN.  The criminals who haunt our reefs and kelp beds are a cowardly and superstitious lot.  By dressing as a quorl and leaping upon them from my camouflaged quorlburrows I keep my sea safe from--oh, wait, you're distracted by the quorlpoon I shot into your appendage.  My bad."""

As if this wasn't enough to make my brain overheat for the night, to be 100% sure I had the name right I went to Snow Miser's wiki page, and discovered...well, let me just quote it:

<i>In the 2006 NBC live-action remake, he is played by actor Michael McKean. Also, rather than miniature versions of himself, his underlings are replaced by women in white swimsuits and scarves, warring with Heat Miser by firing giant icicles from a ballista.</i>

Michael ""Spinal Tap"" McKean, two years after winning his Grammy, as Snow Miser.  In a holiday special that includes a <b>ballista fight</b>.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

YouTube, bless its copyright-ignoring heart, actually has the song clip from the 2006 show.  And Harvey Fierstein, as Heat Miser...my god, scenery chewing? He makes Raul Julia look like Keanu Reeves. It's like he's in the Scenery Competitive Eating finals and he's determined that this year, by gosh, Shatner's not gonna walk away with the trophy.

RE: Tonight's Dream


Guys, I know not every night can involve pyrotechnics or even lolcats.  And I appreciate the recent effort--last night's ren faire anxiety dream? Priceless!

But an entire dream about reading a <i>New Yorker</i> magazine? Srsly??

I realize that someone went to a lot of work designing the photo essay 'Clouds That Look Like O'Keefe Paintings of Clouds'.  And whoever wrote the article about how John Updike would be moving from the ranks of the rich to the ultra-rich (?) through farming and creating a line of gourmet bacon called Eiderdown (??) that will sell for $303 an ounce (???) really captured the magazine's tone.  But I don't <i>want</i> to read a magazine while I'm asleep.  

I know you don't do requests, but if dream-Jimmy Carter's just kicking around not doing anything...he's in a Glenn Beck nightmare?  Ok, that's cool."

"event","Over on <lj user=ontdcreepy> they've started up a thread on the best and worst haunted house attractions the members have gone to.  I'm not even a third of the way through, but I have to pass this one description along for posterity:

<i>I went to a haunted house in my home town. It was in this broken down old building that they knocked down the year after. I was with my girl scout troop and at the very end of the house we entered this room with tons of fabric hanging from the ceiling and an orange light lit up the room. There was a turkey, yes a live turkey, running around room. It made some terrible noises and then attacked the girl next to me with its beak. She wasn't hurt but it was the weirdest thing ever!  </i>

<b>Live. Turkey. Attacking patrons.</b>  I'm finding it hard to concentrate on anything else today because of the sheer unadulterated so-bad-its-goodness of this mental image."

"event","If last night's dream is anything to go by, my response to someone shuffling around outside the bedroom window at night and being all Blair Witch-y is to attach a bungee cord to my shorts and charge the window.  Which is a) good, because it did startle the mysterious silhouette who was out there, and b) BAD, in that once I reached the farthest extent of my lunge the bungee didn't actually retract and instead I just sorta dangled there.

This is the point where I managed to wake myself up with a loud ""MUHR!"", sort of like the sound a cow giving birth makes.

I feel the need to point out that dream-me had been warned about staying in the house by neighbor and old college friend Dick Van Dyke, who since graduating from our alma mater had apparently grown to eight feet high and become a pimp.  It was obvious he was a pimp because he was wearing an overcoat in the summertime and had rings that looked like those coral castles you stick in aquariums, but I was too polite to mention it.

I also feel the need to mention that Dick's boss? The one who wanted the house for himself and was trying to drive us out?  The Joker.  Cesar Romero version, not Heath Ledger (thank god).

And THAT, friends, is why I woke up at 3:30 and didn't go back to sleep until 5:45."

"event","The thing I keep telling myself is that it's not my fault.  It's Elvis's.

Here's what happened: I have a friend, Cady, who's a living statue.  About a month ago she posted on Facebook that she was feeling angry and upset because she was being sued for libel by another street performer.  When I asked she gave me the details: last year while statueing she'd been groped and then verbally harassed for over an hour by an Elvis impersonator who wanted her performance spot.  She'd gone to the cops to complain about him, and (much to her surprise) he'd been arrested. The actual court date was months later and got pushed back several times, so that she was actually out of the country when it finally rolled around, so charges were dropped...and now, over a year after that, she and a witness who'd testified on her behalf (!) were being charged with libel (!!) to the tune of $100,000 (!!!) for the emotional distress they'd caused.

My immediate emotional responses were as follows:
1)...BuhWHA?
2) Outrage!
3) I must help in some way!
4) Seriously, buhWHA?
5) A bizarre story like this must be shared.

The combination of 2,3 and 5 made me think of a couple friends who are reporters, and when I asked Cady about alerting the media she thought it was a great idea.  Fast-forward a couple weeks, and what resulted was this:

http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/08/06/duel_performance_in_provincetown/

A good story, balanced, no problem with that...but 99 comments weighed in, and a depressing number were along the lines of ""I would hope the courts do what is right and tell them both to get real jobs.""  

Which....yeah.  Unwashed masses, right?  Until the Globe ITSELF weighed in with an editorial a few days later, which basically said they were <i>both</i> jerks.  

http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2010/08/09/provincetown_a_drag_on_both_their_houses/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+Editorial%2FOp-ed+pages

This both depresses me and drives me nuts...Cady's at fault? For what?  For being sued?  For not just ignoring someone groping her while she's trying to work? For performing in public in the first place?  

So that's where things stand now...by attempting to help, I instead got my friend scolded by the region's biggest newspaper.  

Next time I get the urge to jump to someone's aid, I'm going to do it by baking them cookies."

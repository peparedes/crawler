I breath for it.

There's no other feeling that feels the same to me when I'm holding my guitar in my hand and going crazy rocking out for everyone, call me what you will, Im so proud of my band right now, I've never loved anything I've played on guitar as much as I love our songs. I cant say we sound like any other band I've heard, I mean its easy to hear some of our influences but you cant really quite say we sound like anyone else.

The guys in my band are just some of the nicest coolest people I've ever met.  It is so weird how everyone came together. It has to be fate.  There's got to be a reason for this.  Already good stuff is coming out, as scary as leaving to california is and as much as my parents dont want me to go, I cant help but feel a drive to leave, if only for 2-3 years.  My parents just love me alot and dont want to lose me and want me to be around.  They don't see why we need to go to cali.  Truthfully i cant really totally explain it either, something just tells me to go and that something will come out of it, that wouldnt happen here.  I want to tour across the country on our way out.

"event","so being positive seems to help my latest depression alot....

i just have to distinguish that some of people lie(not you)... and its not always my errors or my actions that are wrong... i've been focusing on others when I need to focus on myself and be positive and true as much as i can, it sounds silly but it kinda works for me, my brain gets stuck in this corner that sees nothing but negativity and i have a tough time, this also makes alot of the people that know me feel negative feelings ..... theres more to this than what i write but thats basically about where i am right now.... and i like it.... my lifes not great but i see possibility not IMpossibility.... i can do this.... i will do this... cause consider the alternatives"

"event","sometimes i wonder if im ever breathing
you're fashion is an empty response

to something bold im needing 
a word or the few that ive got

we blind folded ourselves
calmly poised and daring

nothing left on these shelves 
but the gun and knife, stop staring 

im suffocating every mistake 

let this winter of my discontent 
be your summers end 

i hope you freeze to death 
and break, never bend

Love the martyr, 
not the benefits."

"event","how could i have ever thought i could mean anything to anyone, when the trigger i pull is the one towards your heart, its like feeling pain is an addiction to me... believing in something is a bottle left behind and all i have left is blowing my mind, this life we lead brings hope to its knees and lets it scream out for time.. but there is no more room for arms to move and for words out of kindness with underlying intent... or maybe im left to disbelieve."

"event","another night spent wishing i didnt exist and that it didnt hurt to even breath... maybe its the thought that im alone... or maybe its the idea that im probably going to be alone for awhile longer... i can always hope and pretend that i will find someone... i can always hope that maybe i already found them only things havent come together yet... but hope only gets you so far till you realize that theres no time left... and hope wont comfort you while you are nursing a bottle in the corner of a low lit room..... hope doesnt kiss you goodnight... hope wont be mad when you forget an important date.... and hope wont even care enough to be pissed you didnt call... hope wont keep me safe and relaxed... it just fucks with my head until i feel so weak... the lightest taps could push me over the edge... i want to be loved... i want to be loved to the point where i love them... i wish i could trust but skepticism haunts my mind like an appointment with death... ""your next, sir"""

"event","i guess throughout the past month or so i went down a spiraling path and really didnt know what i was saying or maybe i saw how everyone really is or maybe it was some decisions i made... i'd just like to say i think i am finally starting to see the world in a better light, i kinda opened my eyes to how i am being treated and what makes someone a good friend... im starting a new life, im not looking back either... i finally have a band and they are the coolest guys ive met in a long time, genuine people.... no bullshit, no drama, no deceit, no manipulation.  I wish i could take some of the things back that i have said and have done in the past couple of weeks but i can't. i wont. because even if what i said was wrong, at the time i thought it was right.  let me just say i have nothing against noone and i wish everyone the best, but i am moving on and making stronger friendships then i have ever had before... i'm starting to realize i can trust again, and its a good feeling."

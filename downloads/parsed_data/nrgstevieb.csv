I'm at 183 lbs now. I can eat as much as I want, I just don't want to even come close to eating what I used to. 3 meals to me is SO excessive...
I now wear 32/33 pants instead of 38-40. My blood pressure went way down, my muscle is toning a lot.
People notice me now that never would before. It's crazy. Somebody told me the other day that I looked better than I did when they last saw me at age 19. 
I don't crave foods I used to love, I dont' crave fast food except once in a great while.
My team has exploded with this product. I know about 15 to 20 people that have lost over 10 pounds on this in my team alone, from Georgia to Hawaii.
i've been tanning lol. My earrings are back in, I'm a metrosexual again...lol w/e

"event","I weighed in today. 198 lbs. That's quit a milestone for me considering about 3 months ago I never thought I'd be down that far again. i thought maybe after a few months I'd lose 20 pounds. To date, I'm at 37. It's almost surreal, but I'm not complaining.
My girl Janelle up north told me last night that she's lost 8 lbs in 5 days...ROCK ON BABY! I'm so proud of her. She said the only problem is that she's losing it to fast, and that's not healthy. I want to address that right now. I talked to Mr. C the manufacturer of NRG and he said that THE healthiest way to lose weight  is quickly, if you're getting proper nourishment. The problem is all these starvation/low carb diets are NOT healthy. People lose weight on them quickly and that's how they get in trouble. Instead of just conversation on this, in the future I'll have documentation. Until then ask yourself...doesn't it make sense? 
Anyway- gotta keep it going. Dave Rutz wants me on the www.escapediet.com site. So I'm going to take an ""after picture"" today. Fun times."

"event","Today I admit...I was hungry. Although I did have my first shake at like 11 am and my second shake at around 7pm, without anything but two pieces of trident gum and some water inbetween. By the time I had my third shake I wasn't hungry at all, so I made it with water. It was all good.
I haven't weighed myself since day 1, on purpose. It's not about micro managing at this point. It's ALL ABOUT the big picture and me getting to my goal of looking like the lead singer from crazytown...lol. Don't ask

Sole Sourcing again, following the Escape Diet plan of 1 month sole sourcing, 2 weeks with 3 shakes and a meal and then another month of sole sourcing. I have a confession, I didn't do it right. It's been two months since we stopped sole sourcing. I even screwed this up, and I still have lost around 35 pounds at this point. I weighed in at 201 lbs this morning.
You know what's funny...I didn't have any cravings today and all I did was 3 shakes. I'm telling you I didn't feel hungry AT ALL. This is my first day back! I didn't think it was going to be like this. I did them with all milk today because I didn't want to be hungry, and I wasn't.
I'm jacked out of my mind...

I can't wait till another 30.

"event","Yeah so weve been eating food now for about 5 days. It's allright. I don't want to get into the addiction of food again. This stage is designed so we put our calories up and then in 2 weeks bring them back down by sole sourcing. I actually feel better when I don't eat any food and just do the shakes. hmmmmm.

I gave a girl a CD today- she has a lot to lose so I hope she takes its advice.

I'm down to 211 pounds this morning. Now I'm starting to be impressed by this NRG stuff. It's been a little over 3 weeks. I was discouraged recently(stupid me) because I only lost 2 pounds last week, and then since sunday now I've lost 4. I guess it was muscle that came on a week ago I don't know. The human body is a strange thing. 
My family is starting to get in on this NRG. I sold a case yesterday to my parents, and my Grandma is very interested as well. Both of my brothers also are all about this product, at least the little one. The other muscle bound freak hasn't come home from college yet, but when he does I'm going to do an experiment on him with the NRG and weight lifting. A friend of mine has GAINED 10 pounds of muscle off NRG. Is there ANYTHING it can't do?
I'll keep yall posted"

I don't want to get gross- but this is a journal, and journals are meant to be personal. I'm talking to all those fat people out there now. You know who you are. Do you EVER get chaffing on your thighs from them rubbing together? I admit, I used to. I used to work Valet or at Walgreens and come home at night in some serious pain. Hated it. I never really had that before a couple of years ago(since I've been fat).
But now that I've gone from 235 to 218 in a little over 10 days, there's been absolutely no chaffing going on. Crazy huh? I guess it WAS from me being fat. Hopefully I won't have to experience that ever again-:) and soon I hope any fat people reading this will feel the same way.

"event","Yeah so I'm up to 15 pounds now. I scared myself this morning because i weighed myself with my gray pants and my robe on. I thought I gained 5 pounds. I was pretty scared...ha ha. I took them off and was back to 219/1/2 pounds. Not to shabby. I'm telling everyone I know about this product. An old friend of mine(girl) is about to get a sample today. She's a sporty chick and if she likes it- who knows what could happen.
The energy is keeping up, and everything else. I just ordered some more shakes yesterday, to keep up with the amount of customers I'll be getting.
Curious about this NRG? As part of a promotion, the company that markets NRG exclusively and I are offering you a no risk money back 15 day test. If you don't feel TOTALLY different in 15 days we'll give you your money  back, that's how confident we are. Email me at nrgworksforme@yahoo.com and I can give you some more information.
It's not all about weight, weight loss is just a side affect.

I may not be journaling every day- it doesn't seem like it really matters if I do it every day or every other day. What am I going to say- hey I lost a pound today? hahaha. Just don't be suprised if I miss an entry. I used to struggle and struggle to lose 1 pound, now I lose one (or more) every single day. I can live with that.
Last night Candice(wife) and I rewarded ourselves for sole sourcing for 1 week with a soup and salad at Olive Garden. It was the first solid food that I'd eaten in a week. And in reality, it really didn't live up to my expectations. After 1 bowl of soup and 1 bowl of salad, I was FULL. Not just a little full, but it felt like a brick in my stomach. I fleetingly remembered how I used to go there and get the soup and salad followed by stuffed mushrooms and then like a bowl of spahgetti- then I'd be full. Not anymore...Thanks NRG. ;)

Pretty ridiculous. I hardly got any sleep last night, yet I managed to work an 8.5 hour shift, visit with my parents and then come home and pump iron. Does this sound strange to ANYONE but me? 

YES!

"event","I worked hard today, wasn't hungry at all. I drank a shake at 5:30 am and then another at 1pm, which i really wasn't even hungry for. Amazing huh? In the morning i have a shake with milk then water for the rest. That's the way to go...

Here are the calories for that scenario, remember I consumed on average around 3600 calories per day at one point. 
Now 
1 shake with breakfast 160 calories for the shake and 100 for the milk. Breakfast subtotal : 260

Lunch 1 shake with water= 160 calories.  Calorie Total as of lunch 420 calories

Dinner 1 shake with water= 160 calories. 

Day Total 580 calories.

Now YOU do the math. Which do you think promotes more weight loss- 4 thousand calories or 580? Is it any wonder how so many people that are doing these shakes have had stories?"

No cravings today at all. In fact, the opposite. I almost had to force my shake down. This milk is starting to get really old. I think I'll be trying the shakes with water tonight at work. It goes to show you how good the human body is at adapting. I got a half a case of Vanilla Shakes yesterday and have been using them. Pretty good.
Tomorrow I'll be weighing myself again and showing the comparison between the amount of calories I consumed a week ago and the calories i'm consuming now. It'll blow your mind.

"event","I lost 5 POUNDS since day one. That's awesome. I still have a long way to go, but that's very encouraging. When I cut out carbs it took me at least a week to lose 5 pounds, and I could never get under 221. We'll see if I can get under 221 soon.
Below is a chart of what I usually eat on a normal work day for me. Keep in mind on my day off I eat probably a lot more. Keep in mind this is NOT scientific, i'm getting the calorie counts off the web. They may or may not be a little higher or lower. It will give you an idea of what I eat on a normal day. This is just two scenarios and their calorie count. If you're reading this, see if you eat less or more than me on a given day. Now, let's BREAK IT DOWN...;)

Work Day before NRG:
Breakfast: 
Egg and cheese bagel, toasted with scrambled eggs.
Plain Bagel- 200 calories. 1 oz of cheese 115 calories, 2 eggs, 100 calories each.
Subtotal: 515 calories for breakfast.

First break apple juice, 12 fl. ounces 200 calories
day total after 1st break: 715 calories

Lunch: Small Quizno's turkey and Swiss Cheese Sub Combo Meal; olives, lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayonaise, mushrooms with a medium coke and a small bag of cheetos. mmm cheetos.

hmmm interesting, it's impossible to get information on Quizno's specific sandwiches, on their site they only list three of them and it's the smallest sandwich. So, for their Small Turkey Lite sandwich it's 334 Calories. I would say the turkey lite sandwich that they're talking about is by far their healthiest item on the menu. So I will add the features to the base count of the 334 calories on to the Turkey Lite. (i'm sure that's what they do)

Sandwich; 334 calories. Mayo; (1tbsp) 100 calories. 6 black olives; 30 calories. Tomatoe(sliced) 25 calories
Pickles(8 slices) yes, 8 slices :) 40 calories
Coke 14oz(approx) 175 calories
Bag of cheetos 180 calories.
lunch subtotal: 884 calories.  

Snack after work: glass of milk and a peanut butter cookie
12 oz glass of milk
200 calories 
p.b. cookie (1) 60 calories

Day Subtotal so far: 1859 Calories


Dinner:
Steak, egg noodles, parmesian cheese, butter, salad with ranch dressing, corn on the cob, two cups of egg noodles, glass of milk.
Oh geez. Steak: 4.4oz steak lean; 340 calories, Salad- lettuce, tomatoe, brocooli and cauliflower; 110 calories. Ranch Dressing;(31g) 133 calories. Corn on the Cob 60 calories(1 ear) egg noodles, 2 cups; 400 calories. Parmesian cheese 1 tbsp 25 calories, 1 tbsp of butter 100 calories. 1 glass of 1% milk (2 cups)200 calories.
Dinner Subtotal: 1368 calories. Wait a minute, that can't be right! Let me check it again. Nope, I was right dang it!

After dinner, M&M Mc Flurry (small 12 oz) 630 Calories.

GRAND DAY TOTAL CALORIES: 3857 Calories on this one day total. Not really surprising why I'm fat now. And I wondered...what an idiot. It's a wonder I'm not dead yet."

"event","The chemicals that the huge corporations put on their mass produced foods are starting to fade from my body. I'm awakening. Losing the addiction that I've had for over 20 years: Processed food. 
Hunger pains are just about alleviated. This is the third day. They say that when you quit smoking cigarettes or some other vice that if you can make it past the third day- you're going to do it. I've now made it passed the third day.
Today I worked at 7:30 am. I woke up, had an NRG Meal Replacement Neutriceutical Shake at around 6:45. I went to work and had a bottled water at 11 or so, and then at 2:00 had another shake. I didn't get any hunger pains from 6:45 to 2 o clock. Just to keep it in perspective, by the time lunch rolled around usually on those shifts I was RAVENOUS for my Quizno's Sub and bag of Cheetos. Didn't happen this time. Score one for NRG. Unlike yesterday and the day before, instead of taking 4 shakes per day I only did three and actually munched on a couple of strawberries.(that I am planning to mix into a shake at a later date) The strawberry felt like a piece of candy- that's how rich it was. Amazing what our little addictions can do to us huh?
Tomorrow I will be giving a comparison on what I would usually eat per day and the calorie values VS. What i eat now with the NRG shakes and how it's already changing the way I view what I eat...
Until then-

I've been that weight for way too long now. I'm pretty mad at my laziness recently.
I've done three shakes so far today. Should be all. I may have to take a 4th because these cravings are starting to drive me crazy. I'm not really HUNGRY, just craving fatty greasy foods. They say by the second or third day they're gone. Hopefully that rings true. I don't know if I can take 30 days of this. I'm sure it will be better. My energy is definitly up, and I feel like I'm breathing better. I don't know if it's a psychosymatic thing or what, but i've noticed that so far.
Tomorrow hopefully will go smoothly. I just have to get burgers and fries and steaks and pasta out of my head, and everything will be ALL good. Until then.
Anxiously waiting for the cravings to leave.

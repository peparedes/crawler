"event","It was cold and bitter outside, as I walked past each dead leaf. I wish I could change beautifully with death just as they did. 
I passed through the same off white fence as I have for the past ten years or so. I can blindly follow my footsteps and do as I always do; Gate. Doorbell. White wall. Wait... wait.. wait.. 
Often as I wait, I stroll, wander if you will. I walked into the backyard, where so many memories lurk. Under the large cover[tent like]&nbsp;sits a table with seats surrounding it. Despite the bitter night, I was still drawn to the warmth of a hard cold plastic chair, but not any chair...the brightest one, sitting under the fence lights. A moth to a flame, I was drawn to this chair. I stared blankly, trying to grasp a piece of me that I had&nbsp;lost so long ago. Trying to control my mind from wandering, I couldn't help but let it go. I could see his silhouette sit casually as he would always. Never uneasy and just loving every moment he breathes. Everywhere I looked, there he was, and there was I in his arms. My mind was gone into history.
Why is it that even after all this time has elapsed, I still think of him, now more than ever.
I carry myself elegantly, impossible to read."

But I will hopefully visit as much as I can
I think i'm gunna get a bike for transportation. I really don't feel like walking everywhere as much as I should. Well maybe I will since it's getting cooler and nicer. I love this weather coming up.
I think I will switch my classes if I can, but I will stay here for the year.
----------------------
sorry for neglecting you my dear.
the entry above was definitely uncompleted and from yesterday.. and, well, it was from the first of september actually, then attempted to be written yesterday.
anyways.
yesterday manda and I went to sheridan and got really nothing accomplished. then we went to walmart.

its like. fuck. far.

"event","It was mutual I think, but it is over.
Hilary and I ended up breaking up from realizing how different we are relationship wise.
her and I clashed far too much and it was just too hard to stay together. it was quick but it stung. 
I cried from being so overwhelmed.
just a lot of intake in the past few weeks really.
now that i'm just leaving the city it's hard..

-------------
i'll be just fine...
i hope..

from two days ago.


colin and I hung out yesterday and it was incredible.
he made me realize so much. him and I are a perfect clay mold and yet, an aging of water just splashes over it.
we are just too far apart to ever be.

it's painful..maybe one day.
who knows.

He hugged me so tight and held me there for a few moments, not letting me go. 
my breathing was heavy and his heart pounded deep against my chest.
I could hear his heart screaming to break free.
He lifted his head, close to my ear, and&nbsp;with his hand holding my face, a silent whisper broke out so loud:
&quot;Don't ever change&quot;



I will. But i'll come home to you.
all of you..and I promise i'll be even better than I ever was.
I'll be strong for everyone. Smart.
Wise.
Bold.
Perhaps, beautiful..

Maybe one day this pain will go away."

"event","<br />so. sara and I ended up talking, and Hilary was brought up in the conversation.<br />I know that for the past year I have crushed on her but never did I tell her strictly because I didn't want to lose her friendship. But Sara insisted,because she is moving to barrie and I am moving to Oakville.<br /><br />so.. I texted her, asking if she was up.<br />the next night I got a reply saying shes camping with her grandparents and she was bored.<br />she asked me what was up, and I said I had to tell her something but preferably on msn.<br />she begged I would tell her, and after about 25 minutes of persuasion I told her...<br /><br />Here is what I said, on text: <br />Heres how it started. It bagan almost last year when&nbsp;I had noticed. We began talking a lot and our friendship picked up. The more in depth we became, the more I tried to push you away.&nbsp;I couldnt help but develop a feeling for you.&nbsp;I knew how you hated girls, well not hated but, didn't like them&nbsp;and how a bunch of them crush on you or eye you down.&nbsp;You would even&nbsp;have friends fall,&nbsp;but here I&nbsp;am, tripping all over you. <font size=""5""><font size=""2"">I&nbsp;thought maybe&nbsp;I started to like girls or something but&nbsp;I couldnt feel the same way for any other girl but you. It wasn't the same.&nbsp;It was always on and off feelings. They would fade and regain often. In time&nbsp;my bday came as well as Kasey's party.&nbsp;I couldnt help but flirt a little with you, and I thought you did too but I never questioned it.&nbsp;I have wanted&nbsp;to tell you but&nbsp;I was so afraid you'd push me away for good. You always told me how you hated how girls turned on you and</font><font size=""5""><font size=""2"">I know you only like guys.&nbsp;I just hope you dont laugh at my choices and i'm so sorry for this&nbsp;I really am. It will fade if&nbsp;I let it.&nbsp;I was just embarrassed of it. <br /><br />She said she could never hate me and that I was silly to think that. She asked me what I would want to come of this and I said..well if you don't feel the same then nothing, just hope it doesn't change our friendship. she said she had a crush on me too, but was confused by how we would hang out so often then I would vanish. I explained it was my fear of her knowing how I felt. she asked again what I would want to come of this and I basically said a relationship but I understand if she doesn't feel that way, she said she wouldn't mind and from there wesome how got ourselves tangled in a relationship.<br />the day after I asked her..out? LOL so weird.<br />but yeah..<br />it was absolutely adorable.<br /><br />I know this sounds super fucked up, but she makes me feel insanely amazing.<br />even her shyness just kills me. it's so cute seeing her like this.<br />maybe it's just a build up of everything that has happened. it's a build up of everything I wanted and now I can't just hold back.<br />she is so shy to be open up and yet I know more about her than anyone in the world. I know I don't make her feel as she makes me feel, but I just hope in time she does.<br />We went to the movies two days ago. nothing happened, not even a single touch.<br />As we walked home, we split from the park.<br />I grabbed her hand and pulled her close.<br />I asked her if she would feel awkward or wrong if I had kissed her. she said Nervous as fuck.<br />So I put my hand on her face, and pulled her in, and kissed her.<br />She was terrifyed beyond belief.<br /><br />I kissed her three times, at all she said oh god this is weird/awkward. the third<br />time I kissed her she rejected it and moved back.<br />I have NEVER been rejected by anyone. not fora kiss man.<br />I was like :| oh my god.<br />I pretended it didn't phase me and I said please text&nbsp;me. as I was walking away she just kinda stood there and looked really upset by everything, like she wanted to say something but she just couldn't do it. I just kept walking away.<br />she texted me RIGHT away saying I'm sorry, I suck.<br />I said no you didn't you were perfect.<br />truth was, I was FREAKING out thinking I had ruined everything and I rushed everything and guhfughfukghfdkjlg :(<br />I explained that all to her, she said no we were still okay and to not worry.<br /></font></font></font><br />goddamn, she makes me feel insane all over. butterflies.<br />I have no idea why! <br /><br />I just wonder how well this will slide with my friends and such.<br />It's not that I care so much, i'm just, really shy.<br /><br />it's weird because i've never really had an interest in anyone else except Hilary but I wanted a girlfriend because i'm just tired of guys. <br />I wont lie, I will miss a lot of the stuff a guy can do or how they make me feel, but I will not miss a lot of the bullshit they do.<br /><br />sigh. i'm nervous man, so damn nervous.<br />&lt;3"

"event","The truth is such a silly thing. so silly that it baffles me. 
am I stupid, or do I just choose not to notice what goes on around me.
I try so hard to be nice and let people in.
but it backfires and they take advantage of my heart.
my broken, unfixable heart.

I hate my heart and I hate guys who take advantage.

Andrew came over last night.
and let me tell you, this time it was all me.

He came over, he played guitar and we just chilled and talked. he's a cute kid really.
chilled on my computer for a bit, then we ordered pizza and devoured.
after that,
we laid down on my bed because Andrews tummy hurt from eating too much.
so we laid their, and I rubbed his tummy.
then, things kind of picked up...
but I avoided his lips the best I could. I just couldn't bring myself to kissing him.
finally, I found myself hovering over him, inches from his face. I kissed his cheek, his ear, his neck,
then went back to his cheek.
I got close, and the best of me took over.
or was it the worst?
I took a chance, rejection doesn't phase me anymore.
I touched his lips with mine, seeng his reaction. 
hesistantly, he kissed me back, but almost in a way where he wasn't sure.
he was nervous, and I knew this because I could feel it in him.

He is the lamb, she is the slaughter.

from there, the kissing picked up.
as did everything else. I stopped to get water upstairs, then when I came back down, Andrew stated we should do something. 
So I said, Timmies?
I wanted to break the awkward tension with something. anything.
Off to timmies, with the boy who could never stop moving his tongue.

And , quite literally he did not stop talking. about anything.
Colin came up in conversation.

As much as they are friends, Andrew could not help but tell me the bitter truth.

* - Andrew told me and Colin seperately that we should not hook up, and treated us like garbage when we would hang out. I couldn't figure out WHY he was like this towards us. I never picked up on his hints, or what he meant. Andrew has a hard time opening up, so he beats around the bush.

He started off by telling me about Colins lies
about all of them.
firstly, his objective is to get into girls pants.
he's aliar, and a cheater.
on his computer, he has a video of his girlfriend fingering herself.
and nude pictures.
and nudes of other girls too?

he ended up telling me the reason he was being rude to me the one night colin came over was because
he knew what would happen if we drank.
and he wasright.
he was so fucking right.
he got me drunk to get in my pants?
I stared at him as he just talked.
everything he said was just right on, everything. 
literally, jawdropped.

He took full advantage of my heart, of everything.
I just love feeling wanted, and accepted, and held that I ignored everything.
I am such a fucking sucker for sweettalkers that it kills me.
alcohol, sweettalks, fake love.
a mix of poison.
I fucking hate myself and I keep setting myself up for it.

after andrew told me absolutely everything, he looked at me and said,&nbsp;&quot;you're in shock?&quot;
I said &quot;yes, of course.. I never saw that in him..he seemed so nice..I was going to give him a chance but now seeing the truth just kills me...&quot;
Boys at any age are just the same, with similar mindsets. how am I supposed to think any differently now. Sex means little to me, but it only hurts when you try to abuse it.
It's so clear now. his intentions are easy to see, like red on white.

I figured the reason these boys come to me is because I am everything their girlfriends are not. I make up for everything they lack. 
And i'm 17 in a 19 year old body.

it's sad really. the truth is, I don't think I can love anymore. or atleast not for awhile.
I wanted Andrew simply for the chase. I can never have him, as much as I do want him.

It's sad..but I will grow from this. 

That night, after everything we did, he sat up, realizing how much of a tool he was for what he did to his girlfriend. this was the first time I have ever seen this reaction in somebody. he immediately felt terrible for what he did..and I feel like it's all my fault.
We seriously didn't even do anything &quot;bad&quot;
it was mild, 
yet he still feltbad. and I felt bad for being the cause.

I know, this time, I did something wrong..
I made a mistake.

I hope Andrew's guilt does not take over, and he can be strong from this."

I felt really good about it too. i'm glad for him.<br /><br />We began to fall apart though..one night, we got drunk and I ended up kissing Ricky and Brayde. Then, rumours went around that I was mad crushing on Brayde because we made out or some shit. I told one of the guys I was crushing, but nothing serious. It backfired.. from that, I drifted, but then july 1st took the cake.<br />christine got so hammered and started picking fights with everyoone and then, crumbled.<br />I really miss those times.<br />I started working at Timmies again, where I met a lot of awesome people.<br /><br />One was Matt. He is 16, a stamford kid. <br />He was working on coffee two when I was on S and S, and my manager marlene asked me to help him with coffee since he was new. So she started crushing him with orders and I jumped in. he kept saying I was amazinglyy fast and I beasted. I managed working coffee and SS. damn i'm good :)<br />after that, he asked for my xbox live account. I went home that night, added him, then he gave me his email addy and fb. so I added him to both. that night,, he asked me to gio for a walk. at like, 2am.<br />So I did. there wasnt much to lose. we ended up spending the next three days together. everynight, and we watched the sunrise. I guess it would have been romantic if I cared much for him. I did..but..meh.<br />He told me he was a bassist to a band, and shortly after, I met his band. Colins birthday.<br />oh - <br />Colin - Drummer/<br />Andrew - Guitarist<br />Tom - Lead Singer, Lead guitarist<br />Matt - Bassist.<br /><br />and Dave, close friend! <br />After I met them the first night, I needed more.<br />I went to their band practice and took like, a bunch of pictures. From there my love for them grew. they are the sweetest bunch of boys i'll ever meet.<br />but the more I talked with the boys, the more they told me about matt and his silly lies.<br />He ended up telling me lies about the bands age, his virginity, girls, life, everything.<br />I stayed with matt much longer than I anticipated.<br />the reason I stayed was for the band, I was afraid of losing them. <br /></span></span></span><p><span style=""font-size: x-small""><span style=""""><span>I ended up going to Shalamar [camp site where the boys play] and that was the last time matt and I were considered a :thing&quot;</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><span style=""font-size: x-small""><p><span><span>the nday after,I ended up telling matt him and I should only be friends.<br />from there, he was okay with it until he snapped saying his life is nothing without me and threatened his life saying he should die blablabla. <br />two days after, he found another girl. isn't that funny..<br />anyways.<br />Colin ended up liking me, and I crushed on Andrew, but it was nothing serious.<br />I&nbsp; love them both in the most motherly way.<br />theyre so adorable &lt;3<br />I ended up telling Colin he and I cant be anything, and to stay with his girlfriend. I felt bad, but it was for the best.<br />he is currently at her house for 6 days/<br />Andrew also has a girlfriend, and she and him seem to be good together.<br />oh well.<br /><br />OH.<br />I broke up with julian, yet again. I was drunk LOL. meh.<br />then I hooked up with Hunter in May.<br /><br />we broke up end of july or something? he is an incredible guy. beyond incredible. he is the one I wish I could be with forever..but..I can't do the distance. <br />I cant. its just not my thing.<br />:(<br /><br />so that leaves me here. to this day.<br />of course i'm missing&nbsp; a lot of details.<br /><br />I have taken an exceptional liking to Andrew, Colin, and Dave.<br />Sara and I don't talk as much because I work like a bitch.<br />I'm always tired and sick. it''s terrible really.<br /><br />Andrew is coming over today. i'm pretty excited.<br />my parents are gone to atlantic city YAY. home alone for three days woot.<br />&lt;3<br /><br />My new place is amazing. cute and cozy.

I will protect you from all around you, I will be here don't you cry. For one so small, you seem so strong. My arms will hold you keep you safe and warm, this bond between us can't be broken. I will be here don't you cry, chorus: you'll be in my arms, you'll be in my arms, from this day on now and forever more..repeat.&quot;<br />it was adorable. i love isaac for everything he's got.<br />rob told me to relax and that it'd be okay. he said it in a very soothing voice, it calmed me down because it was almost like he was there with me, whispering that everything would be alright. <br />i love them both.<br />after that i began to respect them so much more. <br />julian called, and i we talked for a couple minutes but it didnt solve anything.<br /><br />Thursday, the day before good friday arrived. April 8th, allaynas birthday.<br />she invited me to comeout with her that night, to drive around and such.<br />I got ready, very quickly.<br />i got into her new white van and noticed Peter driving with ally in the passengers seat. In the middle sat Ashley and Eric, and in the back was kristen and jordan, waiting for me to wiggle in the back.<br />so i got in. <br />I wore my white top with a nice half black long sleeve shirt over top of it, skinnies and a belt with my highheel, hightop black zipup hooker boots ;) i also had my blonde extensions in with my hippy headpeice on.<br />i was dressed up. were going out for a bday, so why not dress up!<br />i was the only one dressed up nice...<br />we went to the hill and stood around doing nhothing.<br />then we decided to drink. we went to EVERYONES house to get alcohol, then back to my placed after contemplating where to go.<br />on our way back, we went to subway for allayna (her job) to get her shift. <br />i was in the passengers, and all i could think about was julian. i turned back to see everyone, and asked them a question. i told them my situation with julian and each of them gave me their opinion on him.<br />it really opened up my eyes.<br />after we went to my place, we got drunk. i got fucking destroyed. we wanted to go back out and cruise the city a bit, but once in the car, allayna got a heartburn, so we dropped her off. after that, i called him. ihave no idea what i said but i told him i want him back and i loved him. he said he got goosebumps and said he loved me so much and hes so happy i want him back.<br />i called him while he was sleeping, he had to work at 5am. lol&nbsp;:)<br />it was 11 his tme when i called.<br />oops.<br />i was drunk, shut up.<br />we went to mcdonalds.<br /><span style=""font-family: Arial"">As we ordered&nbsp;there was a car behind us who was beeping and whatnot. they were <span style=""font-family: Arial"">screaming &quot;BUY US A SHAKEEEE&quot; <span style=""font-family: Arial"">so i got pissed off because peter couldnt hear himself order, so I got out of the fucking van and<span style=""font-family: Arial""> one of the guys got out&nbsp;screaming!<span style=""font-family: Arial""> hes like &quot;I WANT A SHAKE&quot; and im like &quot;I LOVE SHAKES!&quot; &nbsp;he replied&nbsp;&quot;OMG ME TOO&quot; <span style=""font-family: Arial"">and we kept saying the word 'shake', so said &quot;OMG&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: Arial"">I LOVE HUGS LETS HUG1&quot; <span style=""font-family: Arial"">so he hugged me <span style=""font-family: Arial"">then i ran away to my van and they pulled up beside us and asked for my number <span style=""font-family: Arial"">so i said it outloud and they were like THATS FAKE so i said CALL ME RIGHT NOW and they did. i answered and said HELLOOO and hes like &quot;ITS NOT YOUR VOICE!&quot; i started laughing. after that, they added me to FB and msn. <br /><br />i went home after that, and went to bed. friday, good friday, me and julian talked. about everything. i told him that i will only date him if he gets the acceptance of Rob, Isaac, and Sara. Isaac and Rob said okay, but sara disapproved because he could not prove why he is worthy of my love. <br />afterwards,that night, a bunch of people came in our party and he asked infront of all of them. I said yes&nbsp;:)<br />it was suuuuper cute.<br />&lt;3 we ended up talking yesterday for four hours about everything. i showed him all my friends and gave them descriptions.<br />he showed me his huge beautiful house and parents :)<br /></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>beautiful!<br /><br />now today is easter. and in 11 minutes im going to devour delicious food.<br />&lt;3 ill update in the near future"

of course it took a large painful shot to her.
she wants to go down to be with him.
i told her i would obviously go with her. i want to, i want to see arizona from the eyes of a person who has experienced the real life of living there.

not only that, the surprise of seeing julian too.
i went to timmies with sara, then came home to talk to shannon again.
her friend told her that it was a bad time to come down but wasnt told why, so she is currently
beating it out of her friend.

the line she used was &quot;tell&nbsp;me or else im coming down to find out for myself&quot;
i guess that would work.

ellie ftw ;)

i recently told julian i cheated on him, and today he told me he also cheated on me, twice.
i wasnt offended but i guess were pretty equal.
i do love him.
i think i do.. or am i telling myself i do?

i had an amazing dream..
honestly, it was amazing.




i guess me and shannon decided to go to arizona to &quot;chill&quot; for a few. kind of like we were just goin to the mall.
so we get to arizona and were automatically at some HUGE theme park. so me and shan get on this ride thats fairly slow but WAY HIGH, and from below i notice someone familiar, and i really obviously dont know anyone in arizona besides shanny, then as we lower on the ride it becomes clear.
its julian.
i scream his name!
he sees me and looks terrible confused. i get off the ride, and for some reason i look HORRIBLE. worst clothes ever. like a baggy shirt and ugly pants. i look terrible all around..
but it didnt seem like he cared.
he didnt seem surprised though. at all.
but i hugged him so tightly,
i had butterflies.

then, without hesitating i kissed him. and at first it felt empty..but the more we kissed,
the warmer it felt.
it was a perfect kiss. he was SO good at kissing LOL.
lmfoamflamfoa.
he made me smile so much&lt;3
it was so perfect. hes perfect."

did they want to kill me? <br />why would greg and his group kill them off in order to protect me?<br />what was MY significance..<br /><br />finally, the three others disappeared and i managed to run into a school.<br />it was early in the morning, like 6am.<br />the school was opened and i found my way through the halls to a light upclassroom.<br />i walked in, alone, but&nbsp;within seconds another person walked in.<br />a lady with&nbsp;messy curls, reddish brown hair. she had&nbsp;glasses.<br />she was a teacher.<br />i said a name outloud and she looked surprised, but said no, thats not her name.<br />more&nbsp;people came in, and they were unfamiliar.<br />finally, a woman walked in, fair, fragile, with a lovely face.<br />her hair was long and dark, put pulled back into a clip.<br />i said the name again and she smiled.<br />she knew&nbsp;who i was but i did not know her.<br />i knew that she was&nbsp;also important&nbsp;in my life.<br />she was my guardian, and without even telling me, i knew. she explained where her home was.<br />she said &quot;through the gates and across the street, you wont miss my house&quot;<br /><br />other conversation&nbsp;we had was<br />&quot;you might ask for christine and be talking to&nbsp;her at nighttime&nbsp;(someone who lives in the house i suppose)&nbsp;<br />but she wont be the one replying...&quot;<br />i guess i took it as, even though ill be in bed thinking im talking to someone, ill be actually talking to a ghost.<br /><br />ghosts lurk this house.<br /><br />i remember girls coming into the class, and my guardian told me that class starts at 6:45 or 7:45..<br />a girl came into the class, and she sang to me, a song in choir.<br />she began to sing prayer of the children.<br />i knew the first part to that song, and i sang it with them. we stopped after the chorus.<br /><br />i woke up.<br /><br /><br />this dream, it makes me feel uneasy.<br />ill forget it in time, but..atleast ill look back to this entry and say wtf:|<br />lol, i have to get ready for work (Y) yay.<br /><br /><br /><br />i told a lie today. was it a lie?<br /><br /><br /><span style=""color: #732d42; font-family: Arial"">nah im off sex and dating for awhile</span><br /><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: MS Shell Dlg"">:-O U\ no way!<br /><span style=""color: #732d42; font-family: Arial"">i need a break from dependancy. im sick of relying on guys and whatnot<br /><span style=""color: #732d42; font-family: Arial"">i need to find me and love me before i can love someone else.<br /><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: MS Shell Dlg"">yea i hear u, good luck, let me know if you need anything. im here!<br /><br /><br /><br /></span><span style=""font-size: larger""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: MS Shell Dlg"">was that a lie?

to get in to a &quot;relationship&quot; when i've put actual thought in to my current circumstance and have come to the LOGICAL, THOUGHT OUT solution that I currently hold?

"event","the truth is...
im miserable without my other half.
and i know thats totally normal, to miss the guy who dumped my ass.

i wish i could change what he thought about me. same with his friends.
but it shouldnt matter.
ive changed so much, who the fuck am i anyways.
where am i going.

i wrote shawn a letter, which is my entry before this.
at first, i wrote it out of pure hate.
i wrote it because my heart was so burnt by him leaving without my choice.
i watched him leave.
he fell inlove with the girl 4 years ago, and we changed together, but in time we changed apart.
this winter...this winter is empty.
fuck i'm cold.
i'm sick of feeling nothing. i'm sick of having nothing left in me, with no energy.
today i was able to walk through the hallways feeling nothing.
i fought tears that i wanted out so badly.
more than anything, i dont want people to see how weak i am.
i am not weak and yet im so...
im such a coward.
i forgot when i was happy. truly laughing with a real smile.
and when it felt so real it was just a semipermanent feeling.
its like a smell, something that fades and decays.
why cant i dance and smile and laugh."

"event","yay i just took off my mask. 
i feel a bit better. i have a giant pimple on my nose. its really gross..; [ 
i just wrote out this huge chunk of stuff for my lj but it closed. so here i am rewriting. 

it was basically me venting my heart out. 
basically im lost in my own little world. i just dont understand how though. ive never been so caught up in my life..ive never actually slowed down to notice how fucked up i am now that im on my own.. 
although shawn is not really a part of my life anymore, he still carries an important key. 
i know i make a lot of references back to him, but its for a purpose. 

when i was with him, i just kind of grew on him. 
i grew on reliability. 
i cant believe its forever though. 
i dont know i just cant get over it. 

now i see that im so bruised from what shawn put me through. 
i cant fucking trust any guy. i see them as all the same people because shawn turned out to be everything i fucking hate in someone. 
he started out as a sweetheart. someone so amazing and loving and caring. he put me ontop of the world, made me feel beautiful. but as time faded, so did perception. 
i saw something i began to loathe and yet i ignored it for the better. because i didnt want all this time to go to waste. because i loved who i once met. 
finally he leaves and im alone, hating everyone. of course it makes me stronger but it makes my heart so easy to step on once inside. 
i feel like&nbsp;a wilting flower..crumbling to nothing. 

is that all i am? 
isaac.. poor isaac. i think i stepped on him today. 
pretty badly. and ill find out where he and i lay tomorrow. 
i dont know what i want with him. or with anyone. i dont know what i want to do with anything. 
the only people i am certain with are sara and my family. 
i lvoe them so much, which is why i have such a hard time trying to move forward. 
whats wrong with me.. 

you know, tonight, i yelled at isaac for only liking the chase. 
i told him he only wanted me because he actually cant have me in person..and that once he asked me out he lost all interest. 
truth be told, i only want him so bad because i cant actually have him, hold him. 

he was like, shawn from grade 9. 
he tells me things shawn used to say. he sings to me, tells me what i want to hear. 
im such a fucking pathetic sucker for sweet words. 
i loathe that quality in me. i cant help it.. 
anyone who calls me beautiful has me in a heartbeat. 

im pathetic... shit. 
the truth is. i just want to feel what shawn let me feel..then he tries to make me see that fairytales dont exist. 
well if he didnt put those little stories in my mine to make me believe it, then i wouldnt be believing in happy endings 
and bullshit. 
but i cant help it. prince charming and happy endings DO exist to me. everyone has a prince/princess..everyone can have 
a happy ending if they try and i am trying. very hard. but why do i have to fall in love.. im only 18, 19. 
im not even 20 and i want to fall in love. 

call me crazy but id rather fall in love then not be in love, or be a whore. 
yuck. 
thats all.. 

i just want to be happy. 
will that ever happen. if so, then how long will it take.. 

i dont think i deserve a good guy. 
but im just so sick of being hurt. how do i trust again..when they just keep hurting me. why do they lie. why cant they just grow up. or maybe im too old. maybe i care too much. maybe im not fun enough. 

maybe its just me"

"event","here i go, crying to myself again because im pathetic.
i just had the longest day of my life.
and it was fucking horrible.

i wake up, and isaac calls me and talks to me for an hour.
i was half awake.
jesus christ isaac.

then i go back to sleep till 10, get ready and im at school for 12.
we do a practice infront of the school which was fuckin shit.

but the actual one was pretty sweet.
it was fun too.
my parents left half way which was alright. i didnt mind.
it finally hit me that this was my last concert.
it hit me that i cant come back.

no more fun anymore. time to grow up and be an adult, go to college and have a future, have a career, be an adult.
my heart is breaking because, im afraid.
my real dream? is to become like mrs bover.
to be a&nbsp;singer, a music teacher, singing vocals.

i think the only person who actually knows that is isaac.
and now anyone who reads this.

i love to paint, but my passion is singing.
i love it so much, and i feel so, right.
whatever.
so after the concert, waiting for my ride alone, standing there, i look back and realize that it really will be
the best years of my life. because for four years i got to sing and be me.
i got to do what i love, and i was loved for who i was, for being so important to the group
to my family, 
to eclipse.

ugh.
i want to move, and be free but i feel like i have so much to hang onto.
im so strung up on life, i dont want to vanish.
i dont know what to do, i dont know where i belong now thta im growing up.
i feel so old.."

it went downhill a little bit but regardless it was alright. 
got to school, went to art. 
thats the only class i had, and it wasnt too shabby 
during second i just chilled in the vocals room, then me and shanon went back to hisplace, watched lauracroft and chilled for a few hours. 
he broke my fucking zipper on my jeans because he was trying too bug me by taking off my pants but i wouldnt let him (i was wearing tight shorts under em) and everytime he pulled em down, he'd kiss the side of my thigh. lmao hes cute. 
i cant be angry at him
but it was&nbsp;annoying at times because&nbsp;he was so persistantttttt but thats okay. i love him anyways&nbsp;
after that he walked me back to school, then left with stephen which was nice! 
me sabrina and angela were chilling (i had spare) 
and we all took fun pictures outside. it was so much fun oh god lmfaolmfaomflamfoa loved it. 
&lt;3 

uuuuuhm. 
i decided for the xmas concert im going to do, santa babyyy! ahahha its cute. 
im not sure if mai wanted to do it, but ill learn it anyways. 
i dont want to sing do you hear what i hear.

today was tiring. i finished my essay, i did my english test,
i just have to do some art tonight and ill be all caught up. 
the only thing that i havent caught up is my voice. something so important is being shot to shit.
and its only getting worse.
today was FUCKING ADORABLE. i loved today like there is no tomorrow.
when my world is crumbling, i look at shanon and he turns it all upside down.
it sucks becasue usually guys dont feel the same way about girls.
and i know he doesnt feel the same way about me as i do about him. maybe he does, i dont know,
but honestly..
the minute he holds me, i, UGH.
lmao.
he takes my anguish away.
he takes it all away, everything i feel, even when im happy, he takes it and its like, he holds my heart so
i feel so, ugh.
i wish i could explain.
but today, he grabbed me and (hes a lot taller!) rested his chin on the top of my head, 
and i just snuggled my face into his chest while he just wrapped his arms around me.
and he kissed the top of my head.
i looked up to him and he just smiled and kissed me lightly.
like he sucked the air out of my lungs.

i know its going to hurt when he leaves, but i try not to think of it, because this moment is so sweet.
even in winter when everything is dead and gone, my world is bright and vivid.
i dont care what people say, when the guys tease or whatever. i dont care.
they cant change how i feel.
man thatd suck if he read this :| im almost shy to vent this.
ahahha ughghu.

he makes me feel cute, and i havent felt cute.
but today, today was amazing.


right after school i got my hair done.
it took four fucking hours but im glad she fixed my hair
its really, fucking soft butttttt, when i shower its kinda blah.
lmao i know when i style it on my own im fucccked!
oh well
im also getting dreads but probably after xmas shopping. too expensiiiiiveee

yeye so here i am 45 minutes later.
man i delay often.
its monday, the first of december.
how exciting. i got to crack open my chocolate calander.
you know what i realized? no matter what BRAND of chocolate, it will always taste like fucking asshole.
so, wow i dont even know what to say. sara makes it fucking hard to type because she keeps messaging me. what a loserrr.
i think im going to the pen soon. i feel kinda gross.
but i gotta get my boyfraannn a gift.
hes so sweet. but i keep thinking hes going to leave. its just something that sits in my mind, that im not good enough or something.
maybe im jealous, and yet i dont feel it.
i dont know.
eugh i hate being sick.
oh so here is my resolution that im starting today.
im quitting weed.
for me, for my health, for my friends who think its for the best, for shanon, for expense, for my parents, for rugby.
i have more reasons to stop then to keep doing it.
what are my pros?
because its whta all my friends do? because it fills the gap of awkwardness when were not doing anything.
well obviously theres something wrong with that.
i have to work on my hamlet essay. it was due today but its late. fuck eh.
and tomorrow i have a unit test in the same class, and i also have to do a picture, but i wanna go all out and like, have full details and paint it and shit. yeaaaaaaaah.
and i have a lot of art to do. A LOT.
blahblahhhhhhh

im not motivated to work.
i just feel icky.
:(
i feel like something is missing in my life. im not sure what it is..i dont know i dont know i cant find that missing piece.
its not shawn anymore. i just dont feel, i dont know. me.
maybe its because the school im at doesnt give me the justice. maybe its because i feel like im slipping from my dreams.
i dont know.
i cant hold on much longer though. i feel, so, twisted up.
fuck fuck fuck.

its funny what being finacially unstable can really do to someone.
it can fuck some shit up.

and the best part is, he lives across the street from me.<br />he was too busy for me and it hurts to say that.<br />but i guess i realized why he spent so much time with his friends.<br />as soon as he was off work at 2 or 3am, he would spend the 10 minutes and walk to his buddys to sleep there, and then would go back to work instead of waking up his parents for a ride or wasting money on a speedy/taxi.<br />makes sense, but it still sucksss..<br />we officially broke up sometime in september. i dont remember when, but whatever. it was the beginning.<br />and i think this clean cut cannot be restitched. thats okay though. what can i do. atleast i had the 3 months of drift and consistant fights to help ease the pain. <br />but...<br />after we broke up, i dreaded school. i almost dropped out because i couldnt do it anymore. it burned.<br />and mostly, i FUCKING HATED auto.<br />when i started going to school again, i realized auto wasnt so bad.<br />i developed a small crush on a kid named shanon. he was a sweetheart. one day we were just talking about each other in auto instead of doing what we never do (work). <br />we learned some shit, then stacey being the loser that she is, dared (i know how grade 5) shan to kiss me, i laughed and said &quot;you dont have it in you&quot; and he leaned in and kissed me without hesitation. i didnt even kiss him back but seriously, my stomach erupted.<br />i was sooooooooo giddy hahahahahha<br />he was ADORABLE i loved him.<br />then we really got to know each other.<br />andddd, then he started to like me, so i gave it a shot. weve been dating since, remeberance day. i think thats the 11th. i dont know lol.<br />im learning that hes a very hidden person. he has a shy past, and time can only tell me who is really is. i respect him more now that i know he isnt anywhere near perfect.<br /><br /><em>&quot;why would you want to date someone perfect like edward cullen? that would be so boring..&quot;<br /><br /></em>and i love his flaws. i love the way he'll play with my hand, of kiss the top ofm y head (hes a lot taller than me). i love how i have to get on my tippy toes to kiss his cheek.<br />i just love the things we do, and yet i dont love him.<br />i love being with him. but im still hurt, and im still filling the gap that shawn caused. i cannot fill that gap with another guy. ihave to fill it with me. with time. i dont want shanon to be a filler, i dont want him to be a bounce back because he means so much more to me. i want him to be something special, and he is, and that wont change. <br /><br /><em><strong>shawn im not your bitch anymore..please stop.</strong></em><br /><br />anyways. i have to get ready for work. i really liked typing this out. it was really interesting. when i get on next ill probably update more.<br /><br />i forgot how it feels to just, let it all out.<br /><br />and even when you arent around, i still feel you near."

its like,
the moment anything goes wrong in my life, or im misstreated in my own perspective, i freak.
shawn didnt reply to me for like 5 hours.
and he was a little upset at me. so i freaked

i thought id vent a little.
im growing up a step too fast.
sometimes i miss how things are.


this week has been awkward. when something goes oddly wrong in my life and i dont talk about it, it haunts my dreams.
kristen has moved away. we got in a huge fight because shes stupid as fuck, but now that shes further away than before, i dreamt about it and i got depressed.
i had a dream i went to find her.
odd enough.
i also dreamt about dildos growing out of my closet like mushrooms.
that was fucked up.
i feel sick.

tonight, on halo, me, soup ans ayane were playing a game and he suddenly freaked at me calling me a lot of insulting bullshit names. i got mad of course because who likes being called stupid and a cunt and screamed at when youre on the same team, and the other team actually feels BAD for the person getting yelled at. yeah, i left the game. i was really upset.
he ended up apologizing to me 5448080537872350438504387504375834 times then i said whatever your so dramatic. i love how, when guys find out theyre playing a girl, they automatically try adding you for the gender. i decline so many losers because of that. i have 5 friends. the friends i made were because i acted as a guy. gayyyy

no matter who a person or what they think of themselves to be, calling a girl certain things is just, no. i think when a guy looks down on a girl and treats her like garbage, its all in all a bad sign.

i need money for new shoes. they fell apart.

anyways, after he started calling me out on all this shit, i started feeling sick. insults make my stomach turn, even if it was a joke."

I wish you never left my side that night. the kiss you left on my shoulder is still burned into my skin. i only wish it scarred.&nbsp; the pale colour of the off yellow lockers that stay side by side forever, are what brought us together.</em></p><p><em><font size=""4"">94,670,778 </font><font size=""4""><font size=""7"">seconds</font> </font><font size=""3"">ago, we were laughing beside these lockers. we were so careless and never expected to devote&nbsp;our lives to this. we never realized it. should we have? you and i know this answer.&nbsp; </font></em></p><p><em>*...and that kiss you left on my shoulder, you know... the one embedded into my skin, it widened my eyes, it made my hair rise. and like every time, it made me shiver, with an extra beat to my heart. ""</em></p><p><em>everysingle day, i would make sure you noticed me. i acted like a fool, but only for you. i know that i made you smile even when you were sad. so maybe, at the time we were strangers but we cared so much about each other. i was interested in other people but you were the one that crossed my mind, and when you did, you stuck to my heart for hours.&nbsp; i fell asleep with your song, and heart beat in my chest. </em></p><p><em>*...and for the first time, you wrapped your one arm around my back and your other slid against my left cheek, printing your kiss onto my lips. that was our goodbye. i never spoke to you all weekend but it drove me crazy, to the point of crying every night thinking of you.&nbsp;<u>being&nbsp;in another city felt like living in another world</u>.&nbsp;""</em></p><p><em>i was soon able to call myself yours. almost like a pet, or a little girl's favorite toy flower. perfection carried onto my&nbsp;shoulders and beamed off minutes, days, weeks, for months, for years. we were so young and unaware of what beauty and pain could do to us. we spoke of love so soon because it felt so real, i was so crazy and head over heels because of one touch your fingertips did to my skin. i knew that falling would be unbearable, and it was. i hated the feeling, because while i was playing around, planning out and inventing our futures, you were just trying to live for the moment, and we clashed miserably. was it our faults? we saw so many things in different perspectives. we were so much different. we fell, apart. and we walked seperate ways from our lockers. </em></p><p><em>we managed through hell, and&nbsp;we would have rather died on the doctors emergency bed for giving up&nbsp;our hearts then living what&nbsp;we went through. it was never worth the pain and no young&nbsp;couple deserves this feeling, ever. but in time..my heart regained itself, and his as well. we connected stronger than before. stronger than ever. </em></p><p><em>*...seasons passed, and carried through us. we spent summer nights under the stars counting the shooting stars ontop of rooftops snuggled in blankets. we jumped hand in hand&nbsp;into autumn through the piles of leaves, then locked arm in arm through the bitter winter ice, hybernating our hearts away until we can open our eyes to spring. we soon danced through the feilds of spring time, and rustled through the blowing weeds that rushed through us into the colours and songs of the soft wind.<strong> the seasons faded but our hearts and love&nbsp;stayed full and beautiful</strong>. ""</em></p><p><em>twelve seasons, we watched beauty become repetative, and we watched it shine. people had walked into and out of lives but we stayed strong. celebrations came, and laughter followed. becoming part of my blood, thicker than my own bloon line, and pumping the same cells that rush through my veins. we support our choices, decisions, and everything we do. we know each other more than anything else. i know his rhythm and he knows my song. we create harmony and unity. he helped me through everything and putting his five lettered name into something that meaningful would be impossible. i'd be easier to jump off a building.</em></p><p><em>im not asking anyone to understand how i feel. im not asking you to see this in my eyes, but maybe from the words that escape my lips that beat down on my finger tips will help you to understand how much of a passionate vibe will come from </em></p><p><em>just,</em></p><p><em>one, </em></p><p><em><strong>kiss</strong></em></p><p><font size=""4"">you had, stolen my heart.</font>&nbsp;</p>"

   2. Enter the site lol.
   3. Look around at their collections - hoodies, shirts, caps, whatever they have.
   4. ANSWER THIS BIG QUESTION: Would you buy it? Would you wear something like that? WE NEED TO KNOW THIS PEOPLE. And how much are you willing to spend for these shirts?
   5. Leave your answers here in this entry, or if you don't have an LJ account, you can drop your reply at my email: izyansuhaila@yahoo.com. If you know my mobile number, even better! Just text me up, or call me, WHATEVER MEANS POSSIBLE so that I can know your answers.
   6. I'll reply to each and every one that I get as soon as possible, and you will have my undying love and gratitude. Seriously. Text me, email me, leave me a comment, call me, or if you want to, snail mail me (I'll give your my address). I need to know.

"event","<lj-cut text=""I saw DBSK."">
I have no proper subject title that can exactly describe how I feel right now.

Because less than 6 hours ago, I just met DBSK. IDOLS *_* Words just can't describe how much they mean to me, and this is the zombie me talking right since I barely got any sleep, and in less than an hour I need to go work.

Life is unfair, but it was all worth it.

So. After work yesterday I straight away went to the hotel of their press conference (which is like, 15 minutes from where I live it's kinda stupid if I don't drop by, right?), and along with my camera bag, I asked the concierge guy where was the press conference. LOL these guys will tell you just anything, which is stellar. So I went to the 10th floor, where the press conference was, and got greeted by...fans. Not so many of them, probably around 100+. Met <lj user=""lavhire"">, and her friend Sora (?), total darlings. Got my camera ready, and after a few false alarms, they came out of the press conference room (I was late), and went to the other room for some light dinner (idk).

I saw Yunho waving. And Jaejoong smiling shyly. And Micky too. And there were a lot of fans, so I was like ""Ah shoot, not gonna see them up close if it's gonna be like this"". 

After that me and Sora went down to the lobby and waited there in case they're exiting the hotel to go straight to the airport (which shall be called KLIA from now on, short for Kuala Lumpur International Airport), and it turned out that they took much more time than we expected, so we went up to 10th floor again, and saw <lj user=""lavhire""> sitting down on the floor and talking to one of the hotel guards. He told us that the guys would be using the EXIT door, and they'd go to 15th floor and would walk outside the ballroom, and would go through another exit after that. Which got me thinking ""Why on earth would you want to go back up, and then go down again?"" I mean, it just didn't make any sense. 

Ah well, at this time, I should know better that in the world of DBSK, nothing makes sense anymore.

So we went to the 15th floor (and there was only three of us now, me <lj user=""lavhire"">, and Sora. YEAH. ONLY US), waited outside the ballroom and sitting at the sofas which is just beside the ballroom. We didn't wait pretty long, because we heard girls screaming, and we were like ""ok that's our cue, they're coming up now"". 

And then. It happened. Jaejoong was the one to walk out of the EXIT door first, and was walking down pretty cool, with head low, and I was like ""....Are you sure you're Jae omfg YOU ARE JAE"". I was really starstruck, so I just waved, and then he smiled shyly and waved back and I uttered ""Saranghaeyo~"" HAHAHAHAHHAA omg and he just smiled even more. And then I saw Changmin (yey new hair!) and he was waving at us 3 who was looking quite bewildered and all (like wtf you don't see these people everyday), and I was like ""CHANGMIN SARANGHAE!"" and he just gave a tiny laugh and smiled lol I'm pretty sure if I'm him I would laugh at myself too. And then there was Micky who was just after Changmin (or walked beside him? idk), and he waved at us too hahahahaha I was a waving machine, and of course I had to go and say ""MICKY SARANGHAE"" hahahaha and he smiled too  =D Junsu and Yunho was walking together, with Yunho's left arm around Junsu's shoulder, and they looked madly awesome. They seemed to be discussing something, so I just waved and didn't say anything.

No pictures of this moment, because I just didn't have the heart to click my shutter button. They looked quite tired, and I just can't do it. ;_; So I just waved and said ""Hi~~~~~"" after the saranghaeyos. 

So after that we walked behind them HAHAHAHA, and they quicky went into another door. 

HOH SHIT I JUST SAW DBSK WTF

So after that we walked to my car and drove to Puchong for this Korean restaurant to see if they're going eating there. IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE RIGHT, and they had booked the place all to themselves, but then they cancelled last minute because of lack of time. Awwwww. Shoot. So we went back to Sunway to another Korean restaurant to see if they're having their meal there, and they weren't, so I drove straight to KLIA.

Oh god fangirling is serious business. Stalking is even more serious business.

Reached KLIA, and met <lj user=""hyungie"">, <lj user=""kahel_luna"">, and <lj user=""mickey8""> :D :D :D Me and <lj user=""hyungie""> was joking around at the drop off venue while waiting for the boys, that in order to stop their vans, we should either throw ourselves in front of the van, or throw one of those plastic security cones thing hahahaha. And they took quite a long time to reach the airport, because their flight was at 1AM, and they were supposed to check in at 11PM, but they didn't, and I admit, I got frustrated a bit at this point, but still waited. Around 11.30PM, the police escort that was with their van came to the drop off venue, and their vans stopped, and the door opened, and they were inside. But they didn't walked out of the vans, because by then, fans started to swarm around their vans, so they did the best thing they could.  DROVE AWAY. And they circled KLIA like, 2-3 times to give time for the SM staff to check in for them, and finally, after a few rounds, they walked out.

I didn't know what made me do it, but I was pretty close to the van, and there weren't any shoving and pushing, just many people. The fans doesn't seem to get it, so I was kind of raised up my voice and said ""LET THEM MOVE"", and thank god quite a few people heard me, and began to clear the walkway a bit for them to step off the van. Changmin was the one who walked first, and he looked omfg amazing! Just seriously, the pictures don't pay him justice mannn. He wore this really awesome coat, and glasses and beanie, and was walking and smiling at us awwwwwwwwwwww *pinches* And then Junsu, and then Micky, and then Jae & Yunho. 

I swear Changmin is just so *_* He smiled and just so :D :D Man I love this boy.

They quickly entered the International Departure, and went down for the hallway for the international departure (idk), and was seen sitting at a bench after that whole fanmob. So. Then.

Jae & Micky got up. And looked at us who were above from him, looking, and WAVED. AGAIN. And I'm not imagining things, I swear, but he looked at my camera. And waved! Ok. That's a first. I don't get people waving at me *_* So he was walking at the walkway, and while us fans were looking from the glass upstairs, and he was doing this hand-flailing thing, and then he walked back LOL WHY ARE U EVEN WALKING IN THE FIRST PLACE, JAE? AND THEN HE SAW <lj user=""hyungie""> and ME & MY CAMERA AGAIN AND WAVED SERIOUS I'M NOT HALLUCINATING OMG JAE STOP I CAN""T LOVE U MORE THAN I ALREADY DO hohshit.

It pays to have a big ass camera hahahaha.

And after that, me and <lj user=""hyungie""> were all jksdhfjhgkjgksadsDHADFJKHSDFK HOSHIT JAE and after we calmed ourselves down, we said our goodbyes and went home.

Got back home, and was all ""ajkhhhgkgdhskjhdkHDSF"" with my cousins at home, and I HAVE PICTURES YES! Of the whole airport scene, so I shall be posting that up pretty soon. Now I need to get ready for work hahahaha so wait for the second part of the post! Yeah!</lj-cut>"

So I went. I wasn't expecting to, I planned to go with Amin aka <lj user=""gay_hippy"">, but he cancelled on me last minute because of some meeting, so I ended up going alone <s>no that does not sound pathetic</s>. Didn't take that much of pictures too that night, maybe because I was so exhausted that day. This is not locked again, and I suck in taking concert/gigs/whatever photos. GAH.

This was a surprise. This is a friend of mine named A.G, and I've known him since waayyyy back when I was 17. I have no idea that he was performing as one of the guest bands (Hujan) for that night. Imagine my surprise.

These few pictures are from day 2 of <a href=""http://hackattack07.linuxsig.net/"">Hack Attack 2007</a>. <lj user=""gay_hippy""> aka Amin told me to come down with my camera and snap some pictures while actually it was his reason to play around with my camera. So these few pictures are mixture of mine, his and also Fabian's shots. 

Amin's.

"event","I planned to do this during their 300th day anniversary, but I never got around to do it that day because I was away. But alas, it is here! <strike>And doing this gives me a reason to slack off from studying for my Data Comm test this Wednesday hahaha but whatever.</strike>

So I present to you, <font size=""5"">THE NOT-SO-LONG SUPER JUNIOR INTRODUCTION!<font size=""2""> 


<div text=""LIEK OMG WHO ARE THEY AND WHY ARE THERE SO MANY OF THEM?"" class=""ljcut""><font><font>Super Junior is a 13-members (initially 12) boyband hailed from South Korea. Initially planned as a rotational group (I'm not sure if SM Entertainment is still up for this plan), the members' ages range from 18 to 23 years old and are all talented in their respective fields. They first debuted with the cover single ""Twins (Knockout)"" late 2005, and collaborated with TVXQ for a Christmas album special. They have one Chinese member, Hankyung, and the rest of them are Koreans. They sing, dance, MC, DJ, act, model, OMG WHAT ELSE THEY DIDN'T DO?

And my intro of the band sucks. Anyways, moving on.

</font></font>
<div align=""center""><font><font><u><strong>EETEUK

<img src=""http://img224.imageshack.us/img224/22/1151332346285187fileqn8dt4.jpg"" alt="""" />
</strong></u></font></font>
<div align=""left"">Eeteuk is the leader of Super Junior. And you thought him being the oldest makes him the most matured or something. Nope. He's the same as everyone else in the group - WACKY. Apparently he is a bad driver (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=super+junior+eeteuk+driving&amp;search=Search"">watch him drive</a>) but he is very very entertaining, having appeared in Korean variety shows such as Herione 6 and also Star Golden Bell. Currently he is DJ-ing together with Eunhyuk on KBS Super Junior Kiss The Radio (everyday, 10-12 midnight Korean time) where they usually have random Super Junior members and celebrity guest and make jokes about each other (one example about how Eeteuk wears this ONLY one pair of briefs to bed, and he wears it every night, recycling it like pyjamas O_O and Eunhyuk was like ""BUT ITS NOT LIKE PYJAMAS! YOU WEAR BRIEFS AND THEN YOU WEAR PYJAMAS! THAT'S HOW IT WORKS!"" He cares a lot about his members and he cries a lot, but that what makes him so endearing, no?


<div align=""center""><u><strong>HEECHUL</strong></u>

<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/?action=view&amp;current=555cc9.jpg""><img border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/555cc9.jpg"" /></a>

<div align=""left"">Heechul is....well, one of a kind. First of all, he looks like a girl, calls himself ""Cinderella"", oftenly mistaken as a Japanese, writes a lot in his Cyworld, and has a very interesting fashion sense (socks with cartoon-ish pattern and also pink backpacks). He is very loud, and very hyper (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZjg1Tbeufs"">watch him dance</a> - he's the one in black), and very straight-forward in his words. He likes writing short poems in his spare time, too! He is first known as an actor before debuting as one of the Super Junior members. Among his work are Bad Family, Sharp 2, and also Rainbow Romance. He used to DJ with Park Heebon on Youngstreet before, and he does a bit of MC-ing for music program SBS InkiGayo. He's one of those members that you'll notice immediately because of his girlish features and (at times) outrageous hairstyles. And as interesting as he is, he also speaks very funny English, often imitating those black rapper style (""YO BABY WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"", ""YO TOUCH MAN!""). He was involved in car accident on August 10th while on his way back to Seoul after fellow Super Junior member Donghae's father's funeral and fractured his femur and it is said that it will take 12 weeks for him to recover. 


<div align=""center""><strong><u>HANKYUNG</u></strong>

<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/?action=view&amp;current=00682179.jpg""><img border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/00682179.jpg"" /></a>

<div align=""left"">Hankyung (or his Chinese name, Hangeng), is, well, the only Chinese member in Super Junior. He speaks Korean quite ok for somebody who has been living there for 2 years but whenever he has language difficulties, he'll say ""AHHHH AHHH HAJIMAAA~"" (meaning ""Don't!, Heechul and Kangin do very good impersonation of his ""HAJIMAA~"") and speaks Chinese all of the sudden XD He's one of the popular members of Super Junior and he's very adorable, always thanking the fans in his personal website. He is sometimes missing from their live performances and tv shows because of his problem with his visa (which I don't know why they haven't solved it yet) but he's been appearing more and more in other variety tv shows such as Star Golden Bell and Love Letter, so I guess that makes up for it. He also models before this, but I'm not sure for what though ^^;; His specialty includes ballet, Chinese martial arts and traditional Chinese dance (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwfvzSfVlkU"">watch him dance</a>).


<div align=""center""><u><strong>YESUNG

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/?action=view&amp;current=115786124725xj5-1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img width=""350"" height=""461"" border=""0"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/115786124725xj5-1.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"" /></a>

</strong></u><div align=""left"">Yesung. What can I say about him? He's one of the more serious member in the group, and he is very conscious about his hair LOL. I grouped him in the ""Singers"" group, along with Ryeowook and Kyuhyun, coz he just sings so well! He looks a bit like Lee Jun Ki (I think it's because of the eyes?), and he doesn't appear much in tv shows (except for Super Junior Show and M.net Super Junor mini drama), I think because he's busy with his studies? He was the one who caught my eye during the Malaysian concert because he just looked different than the others, and he was the one who poured water on us fans <strike>and I accidentally gulped it while I was screaming LOL</strike>


<div align=""center""><u><strong>KANGIN</strong></u>

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/?action=view&amp;current=starportfolio20060906vs3.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/starportfolio20060906vs3.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"" /></a>
<div align=""left"">
Kangin is well, very loud and cheeky. One way to notice him is his big build, and he's always talking. He is nicknamed ""Racoon"" because he once called a homestay guest of theirs ""Crocodile"" so she called him Racoon to get even XD And he always introduces himself as ""I'm Super Junior Kangin. I'm Korea number 1 handsome guy~!"" He is currently a DJ for Chunbangjichuk Radio where random Super Junior members visit him as guests (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybKWEuwFicI"">and they also sometimes act their dorky self and break into a dance</a>).


<div align=""center""><strong><u>SHINDONG

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/?action=view&amp;current=115708746577986400.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img width=""373"" height=""407"" border=""0"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/115708746577986400.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"" /></a>

</u></strong><div align=""left"">Shindong is just downright funny. He often jokes about other members' personalities (like Sungmin's affinity towards the colour pink) and he mostly raps in their songs. Shindong means ""genius"" in Korean, and he lives up to his name - he chereographs most of Super Junior's dance (despite his um, well, size, he dances very well) and he mixes some of their songs. And this is not really relevant, but I think he has slimmed down a bit compared to their Miracle days LOL.


<div align=""center""><u><strong>SUNGMIN</strong></u>

<a href=""http://imageshack.us""><img border=""0"" src=""http://img223.imageshack.us/img223/2821/3799sungmin8xxrq4.jpg"" alt=""Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"" /></a>

<div align=""left"">Next up is Sungmin. Sungmin is nicknamed ""Sweet Pumpkin"" because he likes sweet pumpkin too much (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTpw1rUwzS8"">watch him make pumpkin pie and soup for Shindong</a>). He is also very fond of the colour pink, he custom-made his cellphone into pink colour, he wears pink Converse sneakers, and claims that everyone are bound to like pink because we're all born from our mothers' womb O_O Alas, he's very sweet and he used to be shy in school (hahahaha I still can't believe this) and HE MAKES PELVIC THRUST LOOKS SO EASY OMG ;__; He's also very good in martial arts and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42m7p5y-NF0"">he camwhores sometimes</a>.


<div align=""center""><u><strong>EUNHYUK</strong></u>

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/?action=view&amp;current=115708609391049300.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img width=""373"" height=""407"" border=""0"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/115708609391049300.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"" /></a>

<div align=""left"">Ahhh one of my favourite of the lot. Eunhyuk is just funny, silly, sweet all rolled into one. He's close with Xiah Junsu from DBSK, being friends with him since elementary school and enrolled into SM Entertainment together. He likes soccer (just like Xiah) and he mostly raps in their songs. He's a very devoted Christian, he doesn't drink/smoke/practice pre-marital sex, and his nickname is Monkey (I think it's because of his spiky hair). His real name is Lee Hyukjae but because there is already a celebrity with the same name as his, SM Entertainment issued him a stage name ""Eunhyuk"". ""Eun"" means silver in Korean, so he calls himself the jewel boy of Super Junior. He now DJs for KBS Super Junior Kiss The Radio along with Eeteuk. He is like Shindong, just downright funny with his words. An example; he was supposed to act as a lost friend in a roleplay at the police station in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_village"">English Village</a>, and here's how it went:

Heechul: Hey cop I lost my friend~
Cop: Ohh how does your friend look like?
Heechul: SHORT!
Eunhyuk: *sneaks up from behind the closet door* HEY I'M LONG~!

LOLOLOL


<div align=""center""><u><strong>DONGHAE

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/?action=view&amp;current=1152384741_busan4.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img width=""368"" height=""490"" border=""0"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/1152384741_busan4.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"" /></a>

</strong></u><div align=""left"">Donghae the fishie! Donghae is just TOO ADORABLE. Seriously. He was given a nickname ""Pinocchio"" by Heechul and he is one of the closest member to Heechul. He is a fan of N'Sync, particularly Justin Timberlake. Sometimes he looks like a cute lost boy to me, but <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xrxLt2_aiA"">his English pwns my face real hard XD</a> 

Woman: Age?
Donghae: ...B?
Woman: B?!

He is also one of the better dancers in Super Junior (judging from his appearance in variety tv shows) and he sings really good too &lt;3 His dad recently passed away due to chronic illness, and that stopped his Super Junior activities for a while, but after that he claimed ""After this I shall be known as the smiley Super Junior Donghae"" and bounced back from his hiatus. Awww.


<div align=""center""><u><strong>SIWON (or SHIWON)</strong></u>

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/?action=view&amp;current=starportfolio20060908fp5.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/izyansuhaila/starportfolio20060908fp5.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"" /></a>

<div align=""left"">Shiwon is the ultimate gentleman. Nicknamed ""Simba"", he is also everyone's best friend in the group. He likes to randomly glomp the members, and he is very charming. He models and acts besides his Super Junior duties, and he speaks a bit of Chinese (much to Hankyung's delight) and they both often speak to each other to practice Chinese/Korean language. He will be featured in a movie along with Andy Lau (hence the Chinese language) called ""Battle of Wits"". Shiwon also has his goofy side, often goes along with other member's wacky acts (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKQSVsc5HG0"">watch him, Donghae, and Eunhyuk misuse fitness equipment</a>) even though he is often bullied by the other members LOL


<div align=""center""><u><strong>RYEOWOOK</strong></u>

<a href=""http://imageshack.us""><img width=""448"" height=""336"" border=""0"" src=""http://img149.imageshack.us/img149/7734/bscap0479sajl7.jpg"" alt=""Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"" /></a>

<div align=""left"">Ryeowook probably sings in every Super Junior song out there, his vocal is quite distinctive from the other members (he has this really beautiful voice *__*) and he is also one of those I grouped in ""Singers"" group. He sometimes look a bit like Jae Joong from DBSK in some pictures, and he is the shortest member in the group (173cm). He plays the piano really well too! At first he striked up to me as this shy guy, but as I watched more clips of him, I realized he is also as whacked as everybody else LOL <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ty6jy-_MQ"">Eeteuk and some other members once waxed his leg using duct tape in order to wake him up</a>, and let me say, that is just too effective XD


<div align=""center""><u><strong>KIBUM</strong></u>

<a href=""http://imageshack.us""><img border=""0"" src=""http://img78.imageshack.us/img78/3591/0176iq5.jpg"" alt=""Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"" /></a>
<div align=""left"">
Kibum, or as nicknamed by Heechul ""Snow White"" be Heechul, is also an actor before debuted as a Super Junior member. He works with Heechul for Rainbow Romance and also Sharp 2, so it is no wonder that he is one of the closest person to Heechul. Kibum is very mature for his age, he doesn't talk a lot, and is very secretive. He lived in the United States for five years and attended Santa Monica High School, California (his family still lives there). He once told that he didn't have any friends for 3 years (I'm guessing because of the language barrier?), which is really sad ;__; Kibum is also famous for not accepting fans' gifts for him. He said that since most of the fans are still students and doesn't earn own money, they should not waste parents' money into buying gifts for him. Very thoughtful. He speaks quite good English and wears spectacles occasionally.


<div align=""center""><u><strong>KYUHYUN

<a href=""http://imageshack.us""><img width=""350"" height=""467"" border=""0"" src=""http://img55.imageshack.us/img55/896/11574750382006090507iq8ry3.jpg"" alt=""Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"" /></a>
</strong></u><div align=""left"">
Kyuhyun is the youngest member in Super Junior and is only added in May 2006 as the 13th member of the group. His vocal is quite outstanding and is easily distinguished in their songs. He once used to be a bully in his school days (how can a bully be this good-looking?!) and he is close with Ryeowook. And that concludes the very little info I know about him XD Oh, and he's the one I met at the Monorail station LOL

A little tidbit;
 - Every member of Super Junior is attending college now (except for Kibum coz I'm not too sure about him).
 - They all live in dorms. 

And here ends part 1 of the introduction. Part 2 will be up tomorrow and it will comprise of some songs of theirs (and other infro I regard relevant) :D

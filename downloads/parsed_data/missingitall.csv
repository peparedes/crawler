"event","yesterday all i wanted to do was be with you and see you and you just totally blew mw off. this morning all i wanted to do was see you before you went to court. although everything worked out okay still if you would have gone to jail i dont know what i would have done. i guess i should really be telling all this to you but i get scared. lindsay said something to me that made me think. i want this more than anything right now, as crazy as it seems that im saying that, its true. i havnt been this happy in a while and when im with you ime even happier.i only want the best for you and dont want to hurt you in any way. i care about you more than you could have ever imagined and im happy that i finally realized that being with you might not be a bad thing. 





.... i just have so many emotions running through me right now i dont even know any more"

"event","first off i have to say, baby you make me so happy... the fact that i hadnt talked to you since like 10 yesterday and you remembered and was at the mall before i got off for break made me ssssssooooo happy.than you came and picked me up after work. 


now i don't think that anyone realizes that after you get in a car accident and gett all beat but that it is not okay to work 9 hours non-stop on your feet wit just enough time to shove food down and smoke a cigarette. i hardly had time to use the bathroom. i'm gonna apply at Barnie's and try and quit bath and body works. for the amount of work i do in the little time im there i sure do get treated like shit.i love keds though. its fun, laid back, very independent and not nearly as stressful as any other job. plus i got a pair of free shoes than i got another pair of $40 shoes today plus 6 pairs of socks for like $32. mega discount!!!  

if i cant get out of work tomorrow @ BBW than im quiting right then and there. ive made up my mind!



















its crazy how i fall harder for you everyday i spend with you."

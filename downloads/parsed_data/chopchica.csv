I'll be back soon with an actual life update, but I figure it's always good to know that somebody on your friendslist isn't caught in a fire :)"

"event","Whoops, I've been so crazy busy this past week (we had a parental visit, bought a car and closed on the refinance of our house all in *six days*) that I totally forgot I was scheduled to post today. <lj user=""thegrrrl2002""> asked me to tell her the last book that I read and I was all prepared to talk about books in-depth and give lots of recs and anti-recs. But...given that we'll be leaving soon for a celebratory refinance dinner (we halved our interest rate!), I'm going to talk about the last two books I read that I really enjoyed. I read both of them this week, so I think they count for this request. As a bonus, both of these are indie publications and can be bought DRM-Free on Smashwords, or in EPUB format on Kobo with the unlimited use coupon 50Dec - half-off, woo!

Last (good) book(s) I read for <lj user=""thegrrrl2002"">

<u>Justice by Jennifer Harlow:</u> I pretty much ate this book right up. It's dark and gritty (not as much my speed) and full of superheros (more my speed) but mainly, it just sucks you right in and what a ride it is. 

Joanna is an amazing cop and a real person, with strengths and flaws and a whole lot of self-awareness, combined with blindness she just can't see through. It's the first of a trilogy and I'm so so happy I read it this week just as the second came out. I've already got it loaded on my reader and can't wait to see where the story takes us next. 

If you like excellent female characters, superheros and villains and the unpowered people who live in their world, actions and consequences and of course, justice, this is most definitely the book for you. 


<u>Digital Divide by K.B. Spangler:</u> I didn't think this book would be my speed, but I saw such enthusiastic recs and reviews that I gave it a try and, wow, it was awesome! In case it's not clear from my other book recs, detailed world-building is a real kink of mine and this story (and Justice above) has it in spades. 

Digital Divide takes place in a world just like ours, except a few years ago, some of the nation's most promising twenty-somethings volunteered to have chips implanted in their heads to better serve their country. As always, things didn't work out as planned and now they're public and the whole world has to deal with the unintended consequences. 

This is a much less dark book than Justice and I was so fascinated by the world and the characters. The main character is Rachel - a former Army vet and current police liaison, doing everything she can to aid in the Cyborg acceptance cause - but there are many many other amazing characters and their interactions and dynamics just leave you wanting more and more. Book two won't be out until March and I'm already haunting her blog, hoping that some miracle will happen and she'll release it tomorrow.


I've read almost 500 new to me books this year and given an A to less than 5% of them. These two books both got an A-, which I think says it all about just how much I enjoyed reading them. They were both unexpected treats and truly excellent and I hope somebody out there reading this post discovers them and gains as much joy from the experience as I did."

I'm coming out from my Life Coach School hibernation and totally want to start posting again. So this December meme showed up at exactly the right time.

Friendslist (and other cool readers), you have the power! Pick any day in December and any topic you want and I will make a post about it! Some of the current main things in my life are my Life Coach program, my Therapy Dog volunteer work, my *unbelievably* huge love of Subscription Boxes and the twenty-five or so I've tried, Yoga, an amazing trip to San Francisco, refinancing our condo (yeah, that's a fun one), the joys of cooking and eating and food stuff in general and reading tons and tons of books and fic. I'm happy to talk about pretty much anything though and if I have a problem with a topic, I'll send you a PM.

So pick a day and a topic and I shall expound!

ETA: I just remembered that my parents will be visiting this weekend and I'm almost definitely not going to have time to post from Dec 7-9, but all other days are fair game! Also, during the visit, we are going to the International Food Fair with 32 countries represented. We went to this in May and it was one of the highlights of my year. I'd be happy to talk about things done on this visit (fair, buying a car), it just has to be a date *after* the visit.

ETA2: Guys, the second half of my month is looking a little lonely! I'm home alone from Dec 22-30, so those are some *wonderful* days to get me to be talkative."

I know I'm not the only one out there who feels this overpowering sense of dread when I look at what's happening in the world today. Everything feels so ugly and full of hatred and bitterness and there's very little hope left. The Chilean miner rescue and Gabby Giffords walking under her own power and New York's Gay marriage law are tiny little spots of brightness in what feels overwhelmingly like a dark, dark world.

I know that hundreds of millions of dollars are needed to help Somalia and that people in Haiti and dozens of other countries still need help, not to mention, of course, the people right here who also need help. It can get overwhelming to think about it too much or for too long.

But I want more spots of brightness. More and more of them until they beat away the dark. I have the power to help with that process and so do you."

"event","An MSNBC story just popped up on my homepage about the famine in Somalia. There are now numbers (verified by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention) showing that over 29,000 children under the age of five have died in the last *90 days*.

NINETY DAYS

I went and looked on CNN's entire homepage and there wasn't even a *mention* of this (there was a top-rated article about how the woman who played Cha-Cha in Grease passed away though). I barely ever see a mention about this. TWENTY NINE FUCKING THOUSAND CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE.

I checked out givewell and their blog says that right now, the best bet for aid is Doctors Without Borders. Due to terrorist control, it's extremely hard to get aid into Somalia but MSF has a good history of work there.

I know that times are tough for a lot of people, but I calculated just what I've eaten *today* (I picked a great day to go to the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory for the first time in years) and it's really hard right now not to be sick. I've eaten a *humongous* amount of food this week - heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella, whole grain toast with almond butter, Mexican food, pizza, fresh fruit and vegetable juice every day, Mexican food, melon, volcano bark and macadamia toffee, Mexican food...

I have so *much*, you know? And Doctor's Without Borders takes donations as little as $5. $5 is a sub from Subway. Or a Venti iced latte. Or 3/4 of a burrito from Chipotle. Or one heirloom tomato and a quarter block of mozzarella. Or one glass of fresh juice. 

$5 can make *such a difference*."

"event","So there I was, chilling in my recliner and contemplating making a post full of cool things going on in my life, because I really need to focus on the positive (speedy version: board games = fun! michael palin travel documentaries = fun! big bear trip for mg's bday including snow tubing = fun!) and some guy showed up at my door.

He was collecting money for some Christian Mission downtown that provides services for the homeless. Once I confirmed that this included homeless people who were gay (his answer: ""We help everybody in need and you know, it's quite acceptable to be gay these days""), I went looking for cash to give him.

All I could find was three dollars. I didn't even have any change because we just went to coinstar to get amazon credit for our change (and then I got expansions for the aforementioned board games). I felt *super* bad about only having three dollars and apologized a whole bunch of times. We barely do anything with cash anymore that isn't the farmer's market and I just wasn't expecting somebody to show up at my door.

We're wrapping up and he asks me where I'm from, because he's from Minnesota and thinks I look Midwestern. I told him that that's just because I dye my hair blonde and I'm actually an East Coast Jew, and he said - I swear to god -

""Wow, I guess I was lucky I got even that three dollars out of you!""

...

I mean, what could I even *say* to that? It's clear he didn't mean it to be as bigoted as it sounded (he totally thought I'd laugh along about how hilarious it is that Jewish people are so cheap and stingy) and it's not like I was going to snatch money back from helping *homeless* people, but, wow. It was so unexpected and *disrespectful* and it really bummed me out.

I guess the thing that makes me sad is that he *wasn't* an asshole. He was a nice guy trying to do good things. He petted Pasha into a happy puddle and talked about how important this group had been towards turning his life around but didn't proselytize, he was respectful in his request and tried to let me know why it was important without being even the slightest bit pushy. He was trying to help homeless people turn their lives around.

If he really was an asshole, it'd be a bummer but understandable - and something I'd roll my eyes about and get over almost immediately. What made me sad was that this nice guy trying to do good things had no idea of the kind of damage a statement like that could cause. No idea of what his careless words and (what he thought was a lighthearted) joke actually *meant* and not only how it might make somebody like me feel, but how it helps perpetrate and spread negative stereotypes. He wasn't antisemitic, but his attitude is the kind of thing that leads *other* people towards antisemitism. It gives them justification for their words and actions.

He wasn't an antisemitic asshole himself, but people like him are what lay the groundwork toward true antisemitism and I don't know what to do with that or how to respond to it."

"event","I've been on some kind of massive cooking binge the last few days and I don't even know when it's going to stop. We've been looking at how we handle our finances and it's clear we spend *way* too much money eating out and getting takeout and also on groceries (Trader Joe's and Whole Foods' prepared meals, you are my nemesis!).

So, given that it's still really hard for me to eat produce without sneaking it into stuff and in the spirit of the New Year, I've reminded myself that I love to cook and that it's always worth it to make a double (or triple) batch and freeze if possible, because then it's just there waiting for me. I've made a deal with myself that I have to eat either a lunch or dinner of healthy home food every day and as long as I do that, I can go out or get takeout for the other meal. And no saving up - if I eat home food twice in a day, I don't get outside food twice the next day. So this way, I can still get food from Smashburger (OMG SWEET POTATO FRIES) and Habaneros (OMG POTATO TACOS AND AMAZING SALSA) and Surati Farsan Mart (OMG CHOLE SAMOSA AND DELHI CHAT) and Bongournios (OMG I LOVE THEIR PIZZA) but I also will have to use moderation and will *guarantee* I get at least one truly healthy meal a day.

So at the end of last week, I made a nice huge pot of veggie Korma (spinach, broccoli, yellow pepper, green beans, chick peas, potatoes) and we've been eating it with whole wheat naan. Just as we were finishing it up (still one meal's worth left), I had some kind of cooking...I don't even know - lust, maybe? - sweep over me and before I knew it, we'd gone to Costco and the Farmer's Market and Trader Joe's and Whole Foods and it was time to get cracking!

I started off with two GIGANTIC vats of veggie chili. We love this stuff but it's annoying to make, so once a year, I triple the recipe (it used an 8 qt pot and a 10 qt pot) and just suck it up for a few hours. At the end, we had dinner, three tupperware containers and 10 quart sized ziploc bags bulging full of tasty awesomeness! mg brought some to work for the week, I had some more last night, we're having some friends over for chili and cornbread later this week, and the rest is being frozen. We're set for months and months.

But I wasn't done yet! I just finished making enough cream of broccoli soup (I snuck in carrots and spinach and made it even more produce-filled) for about four meals, and I also made the coolest thing ever: Winter Greens Pesto!

It's really never occurred to me to make a pesto with winter greens before, but what a brilliant idea! A fun and easy way to eat a ton of greens (Trader Joe's is currently selling a bag of washed and stemmed collards, turnip greens, spinach and mustard greens) and we can eat it with barley or whole wheat pasta and it also freezes!

So yeah, between soup (I also have two bags of Tuscan Bean Soup in the freezer) and chili and pesto (also have normal pesto and roasted tomato and almond pesto in the freezer) and the gigantic two pound block of Tillamook Cheddar we got at Costco and want to add to *everything* and god knows what else, I think I'm probably covered for the entire rest of January. Except I still want to cook more!

Anyway, if any of you want recipes for the following: Tuscan Bean Soup, Cream of Broccoli (and other snuck in veggies) Soup, Veggie Chili or Winter Pesto, let me know and I'll stick them in. But for now, I'd better go eat one of the things I made!

"event","So...for those of you who don't know this about me, I'm a reader. I love to read. Looooooooooove it! If I don't read at least a book's worth of stuff a day, I start getting all tense and fidgety. And with my health situation, I've had a lot of days where all I can do is lie in bed and read (SONY READER, ALL LIGHT AND EASY, ILU).

Last year, I started keeping track of the books I read and this year, I set a goal of 500 books (rereads counted, but only if I hadn't read them in the previous 12 months. Fanfic, sadly, did not count).

Last night, I finished book SIX HUNDRED! Yes! I READ SIX HUNDRED BOOKS THIS YEAR! AND PROBABLY LIKE ANOTHER 400 WORTH OF FANFIC! WOOOOO!

It's still less nonfiction than I'd like, but I'm getting up there and my secondary goal was to make sure at least 10% of my books were by POC authors (I think I ended up with 13% or so). Hopefully I'll increase both of those next year.

About 10% of the books I read this year got a solid A from me, and while probably nobody out there wants a sixty book rec post, I am going to try to cull my 10-20 favorites that I recommend and make a post soon. Because, who doesn't love hearing about and finding awesome new books? I SURE DO!


Anyway, Merry Christmas to my Christmas-celebrating friends and Happy Day Off To Do Fun Things to the rest of you! Our tentative plan for today is to go to the Wild Animal Park and have fondue for dinner (mr. goodnews takes his Christmas fondue Very Seriously). Tomorrow is the Zoo (these are very non-busy days to go!) and a really nice Italian place for dinner that I have a groupon for (Groupon, I also LU) and have been wanting to try for months. Thanks to mg taking a little staycation and the aforementioned groupon, we've also got plans for whale watching, Persian food, a SEAL boat tour and New Year's fondue with some close friends! HOORAY FOR VACATIONS AND HOLIDAYS AND I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE A WONDERFUL ONE!"

"event","HAPPY (C)HANUK(K)A(H), GUYS!

Even though it's relatively minor in the scheme of things, Hanukkah is one of my absolute favorite holidays of the year. It combines so many things I love: lights in the darkness, family, chocolate candy, fighting assimilation (and *winning*), miracles, hope for eventual peace, presents (although, these days, we give out gift certificates to Kiva or a donation to the charity of the recipient's choice, because, really, we're already blessed with so much) and fried things!

And not only is Hanukkah full of all of that, but recently, the world of Hanukkah music has exploded onto the scene! It used to be that Adam Sandler was our only water as we wandered through a cool Hannukah musicless desert for forty years, but no longer! A few year ago I found the LeeVees (who still sing my two favorite songs (Applesauce Vs. Sour Cream and My Goyim Friends) and this year, my wondrous Hanukkah miracle discovery was the Maccabeats!

The Maccabeats are Yeshiva University's A Capella group and there are all sorts of videos of their performances on You Tube. Here are two of my favorites. The first one is *hilarious* and the second one is what I think all of us hope for: peace and a world where we can all sing together under the same sun.

Give them both a view; you really won't regret it! And when you eat your latkes and souvganiot and win all of the peanuts from your really pissed-off siblings, remember that even when it looks like there's no hope, keep fighting and lighting your candles in the darkness, because sometimes we win and miracles really do happen.

"event","I figure after being tagged a bunch, I might as well get in on the happiness meme. Chances are I won't be able to remember to do it eight days in a row, so here are eight things that make me happy about one of my favorite happymaking places ever: the beach.


1. Last week, while we were at the beach, a full brass band of about ten people set up and played for over an hour - including a variety of zydeco songs, Good Vibrations, and a surprisingly good version of Tainted Love.

2. The Three-Day breast cancer walk goes along the coast and you can watch thousands of cheering women as they make their way down the boardwalk.

3. In the summer, we set up our giant 10x10 beach tent and spend the whole day there with friends and dogs and books and surfboards and gazpacho and pineapple.

4. I do the large majority of my reading on my Sony Reader these days, but there's no way I'm bringing it to the land of sand and water spraying dogs, so I keep a nice supply of ""real"" books and get to revisit with them at least once a week.

5. In the summer (and sept-nov this year), it is quite often 90+ and extremely sunny every single day. At the beach, the temperature automatically drops 10-15 degrees, and there is always a strong cooling breeze.

6. Sometimes, if I am really lucky, I can see dolphins playing out along the horizon.

7. While it's not exactly a ""beach"", La Jolla Cove has seals and you can walk along the rocky paths and watch them head out with the morning tide and come back in with the evening one.

8.

Not to mention, if I love somebody, I love *them*, not everybody standing around them as well. I sure as hell don't love everybody in the universe and I'm kind of creeped out by people who do. Hell, thanks to the wonder of lj toys, I know that there are people reading my journal whom I can't stand. If you're one of them, trust me, I *really* don't love you. Not even a tiny tiny bit."

"event","Recently, I've seen a bunch of people (including two pro authors) try to shut down conversations about RaceFail by explaining that they are Jewish and know about discrimination and they are furious that they've been told to sit down and shut up and maybe learn to *listen*, because they *know about discrimination*.

Hi, in case you don't know me (which is very possible), I am Jewish as well. I am very very aware of our history of discrimination and how it affects us even to this day. In fact, I've posted about this extensively under both my <a href=""http://chopchica.livejournal.com/tag/antisemitism"">antisemitism</a> and <a href=""http://chopchica.livejournal.com/tag/judaism"">Judaism</a> tags. I've tried my hardest to educate and raise people's awareness and give Jews on livejournal some places we can come together and form a community. I believe very strongly that Judaism is more than just a religion; it is an ethnicity and a culture.

So, right now, as a Jew who thinks talking and educating and working through our issues with our discrimination and our ethnicity is very important, I am telling you to shut up and stop using this as an excuse, because this *isn't about you*.

Yes, we have been discriminated against, just like many many people participating in RaceFail have been discriminated against for being female, gay, disabled, fat, trans, poor, etc. All of those things are valid discriminations and it's horrible when people dismiss or perpetuate them. However, not a *single one of those things is like being discriminated against because you are not white*. None of them. Not a one.

I think one of the hardest realizations going on here is that there can be conversations that aren't about you and that you in no way have a valid or important voice. Part of blogging online is that we've all become very used to our voices being heard and our contributions being valuable. We find it impossible to believe that there can be a situation in which we are not capable of saying something important - and in fact, will cause anger or pain by saying something at all. 

I am speaking for myself here as well. I see conversations and I want to contribute. I want to share and help and what it's so hard for me to get every single time is that thinking that people in a group I am not a part of should be getting *help* from me is possibly the most insulting thing in the world. I hate it when men try to pull it on me as a woman. I hate it when non-Jews try to pull it on me as a Jew. And yet, I fall into that same trap over and over. That is the mark of privilege, and I am *dripping* with it.

And so I'm sorry to say, Jews and Trans people and disabled people and women and gay people and everybody else white, *so are you*. You may think you're not, but you *are*. In this conversation, you don't *have* a pass to ride that train.

I've seen so many comments from people who whine about how they *tried* to contribute and discuss and were shot down (one person seriously used the word ""collective"" as if all non-white people were part of the *Borg*) and so they stopped paying attention or caring. Every single time, they don't get that maybe what they should've done was read and think and think and think and read some more and think some more before they decided what they had to say was in fact valuable. If you post and POC call you out on what you're saying, maybe that means what you said is *wrong*. Yes, sometimes it might mean that a specific person calling you on something is an asshole. Everybody is capable of being an asshole. But, giving it a generous estimate, I'm guessing that doesn't happen more than 2% of the time. Do you really think that every single time it's happened to you is some sort of special exception that excuses their behavior and not yours?

Again, I am speaking for myself here as well. I have *done* this. I was a derailer and a privileged and smug one. I think back to what I said and did and I want to smack myself so hard my head spins around and I get some *sense*. I'm still so embarrassed and ashamed of the things I said. There's nothing I can do to make that go away. There's nothing I can do to fix that. I apologized and I tried to listen and I read extensively and I kept my mouth shut for months. Because the thing I had to learn was that this wasn't about me. 

The worst thing about this is that I'm willing to bet that every single white person trying their hardest to learn and listen and be an ally has had the exact same experience. Maybe there is some magical exception out there who managed to start without putting their foot in their mouths, but overall, the only way any of us (including me) started out was by saying and doing incredibly privileged things that *hurt*. We all learned from *causing other people pain*.

I've seen some people use their personal discrimination experiences in a productive way, a way that says, ""I've had something like this happen to me and I know how horrible it is and it must be so horrible for you and I'd like to learn more about this and hopefully I have done nothing to perpetuate it, because I know that that sucks. And if I have, I want to work my hardest to change things."" Those people are awesome. 

They're also rare, because most of the time, I've seen it being used to derail. I've seen people claim that racism is just like being discriminated against for being fat, just like being discriminated against for being disabled, just like being discriminated against for being trans/female/gay/Jewish/Pagan/you get the drill. And then, when that person is told that they are wrong, they pick up their toys and go home, sniffling about how mean and discriminatory those evil POC are for not letting them play in their sandbox. And then I think about how rageful and unhappy they must feel when some somebody male/non-Jewish/straight/etc pulls that exact same shit on them - presumes to tell them how they should feel and think, because they have xxx experience as well, and I wonder to myself, how can they not get that they are doing the *same thing*?

So yeah, I am no better than any of you, because I pulled this shit and although I hope otherwise, I will probably accidentally pull it again. And just like you, I crawled away to lick my wounds and raged to friends about the situation and made myself out to be the victim and it took me a very long time to get over myself. After all, I already *knew* what it was like to have discrimination in my life. I didn't need to be shut down by people telling me my voice had no place here. The hell with them! It took me a *really* long time to get over myself. 

Which is why I'm here saying that hopefully you can get over yourself as well. It's not easy and it's not fun and you're going to have to examine behavior from yourself that will make you cringe in shame, but that's just how it goes, because you said something privileged and a lot of the time it was hurtful and it derailed from what was actually important and made it about you and now it's time for you to grow up. Time for you to learn to be a mensch.

And if you can't do that, the least you can do is shut up. Really.

As a final note, while we're on the subject of shutting up, I want to say a bit about silence. While I understand why some people have felt the need to call for people to post and speak up, I also understand why some people have kept silent (although, yes, I much prefer it when people speak up. I am a big fan of speaking up against racism and racist behavior and I am happy every time somebody does). What I don't understand is the people who are  taking the time to comment and explain that they know nothing about this and don't care, and then when it's explained to them, go on about how they *still* don't care and how *silly* everybody else is for caring and how do they have the time for this anyway. Somehow, they always have the time to make ten really long comments about why they don't care, but not to do twenty minutes of reading. It's even worse when they make really long posts about it themselves.

I'm fine with silence. Right now, if they're going to be a privileged asshat, I wish more people would embrace it. There's no pride in being ignorant and causing real people real pain.


ETA: <lj user=coffeeandink> smartly and rightfully suggested that I put something in about intersectionality and the fact that there are lots of POC who are gay and disabled and fat and trans and Jewish and Pagan. I've seen a bunch of them speak up and try to talk about their experiences as both and be *incredibly* derailed and dismissed, even though they are a billion times more qualified to speak up about what it is like to be a POC who is active in the Fat Acceptance movement than somebody white is. I am sorry I left that out and made it seem like you guys didn't exist! That was so incredibly stupid of me!"

"event","Hey, remember when Elizabeth Bear said it was time for a cease fire and she was going to stop engaging and this was her last word on the subject and in fact, she wouldn't even be reading any other blogs? 

<i>And so, I'll start. I'm going on blog-reading hiatus for at least a week, maybe longer. (I may very well still post. I am compulsive.) And furthermore, I'm not talking about this anywhere else either. From this day forward, I will not respond on this topic. </i>

Remember?

<a href=""http://rozk.livejournal.com/247442.html?thread=2364050#t2364050"">Yeah, not so much.</a>


Before you get excited that maybe she's stopped being such an *idiot*, I'm sorry to say that this is just more of the same.

<i>It's true, and that's why I apologized for it, and said it was my fault.

My reasons for what I did were that her reading is, indeed, valid, given that she commented only the first chapter of the book, and because I did not feel that defending myself would cause anything except the explosion that we now have.

It wasn't disingenuous. What I said was true: I agreed with what she wrote in her post, a lot of which was about media fandom. I chose not to point out the errors, because I knew it would look like temporizing.

It was a choice not to defend myself, and to accept her judgment, and attempt to provide a useful model for accepting criticism. (Generally, as writers, we are encouraged to accept criticism even if we disagree with it. It's not our place to correct our critics.)

As I said in my most recent post, I still choose not to defend myself. I'm not going to fight with anyone on this topic, because I agree: institutional and unconscious racism is a problem in SFF fandom. I absolutely agree. I agree that something needs to be done about it. I agree that it's most likely absolutely present in my work.

I also think that the criticism needs to be available for counter-criticism, which I think is the sticking point.

My refusal to engage is because I do not agree with the tactics currently in use, including harassment and intimidation, and I will not support them. I also do not agree with this tactic of ""outing"" pseudonymous fans, but if you're going to judge me by Kathryn Cramer's behavior, then everyone involved needs to be judged by the anonymous people who have made physical threats and threatening phone calls, and I don't think anyone wants that.</i>


She's right, right, right. Everybody who disagrees with her is wrong, wrong, wrong. And also, everybody should shut up about outing being a bad thing because according to her, there have been physical threats and threatening phone calls. According to *her*. Given her track record of honesty (hell, she couldn't even keep her vow to stay away from these things for over 24 hours! And I'd like to mention that the *last* time she said she wasn't following any of the other arguments, I then tracked her reading *every single thread on my post*), do *you* believe her? And even if she's telling the truth, does she really think that a few off-the-rails people negate everybody else?

I love how she thinks if she just keeps saying enough that there has been bad behavior on both sides, that people will suddenly decide that none of this is important after all. Protip: you can't rewrite the history when the evidence is right in front of you. You can delete your journal and comments and posts, you can redirect your links to sites with malware, you can threaten to sue, you can go back on your word time and time again, but the proof is *documented*. When you say your words are being twisted around, we have the actual words that you said and the only thing that comes out of it is that once again, you are *full of shit*.

Elizabeth Bear, I was never remotely impressed with you (and your extremely high opinion of yourself) to start with. For some reason, a lot of people were. They took your words seriously. They looked up to you. And right now, what you don't get is that you've *lost* that. You started a conversation on race under false pretenses. You promised a safe space to discuss and went back on your word (I am noticing a trend here; is it really that hard for you to promise something and then follow through?). Literally *every single thing you have done here is full of fail*. Everything you've done - right from the very beginning post on how to write the ""other"" you've done to make yourself look good, without any real understanding on your part that people aren't *toys* and you can't just make them line up and behave as you wish. You don't have the *right* to lecture other people on how to behave with honesty and integrity. You don't have the right to try to stop discussion or assign blame. You don't have the right to think your words are going to be believed without proof or that you vouching for something or promising things means *anything*.

The best thing you can do is *shut up*, because nobody wants to hear it anymore. God, *please* shut up.


ETA: She's all over the post now, explaining herself, and thinking (once again) that her words still have some sort of currency with *anybody* who isn't a friend of hers.

ETA2: <a href=""http://matociquala.livejournal.com/1584153.html?mode=reply"">Elizabeth Bear joins all of her friends in trying to hide the words they've said, and is now pulling down all of her previous posts on the subject.</a> But it's okay, because she's *so sorry*! And you don't have to worry about her deleting the entire blog, because it's such a good resource! There will be no deleting or drama - except for the part where she just deleting evidence of her (and her friends') bad behavior! That's not a good resource; it's *different*!

(ETA to the ETA: After some deep though, Elizabeth Bear said she'd leave the posts up. However, she (once again) lied, because over half of them are gone.

Gone: her original cultural appropriation post, her ""let me handle it guys"" post, her ""really, you all should've let me handle it post where she mocks and bans sparky.

Still there: fake apology post number one (ie, the one where she pretended to take willow seriously and it exploded into ugliness), her call for a cease fire, fake apology post number two (made yesterday), her post about how she is a better person than everybody else and her book sales are up.

So she's basically removed the context as to how this *started*, removed the parts where she was nastiest to POC and allies, and left the parts where we can see that she's made mistakes in the name of *growing*.)

ETA3: I'm also going to say this. If you are *truly* apologetic and want to stop making things about yourself, it might behoove you to turn off comments, because you *know* dozens of people are going to jump in to tell you how awesome you are and how much they'd miss you if you left and how it's not fair that there are things you're not allowed to say or talk about. And look, it's already happening! I'm so glad this entire experience happened so you could be validated about what a valuable and adored person you are!

ETA4: <lj user=machineplay> has come up with <a href=""http://chopchica.livejournal.com/169091.html?thread=3474307#t3474307"">brilliant suggestions for BPAL scents, based on RaceFail09!</a>

<i>RaceFail09 Scents:

white women's tears: starts with daisy and lavender and linens freshly laundered by the help, dries to the musty smell of old money and university degrees, with a hint of leather for self-flagellation.

the lurkers support me in email: the sea-salt smell of sweat and a dose of musk, finished with elements of diet soda, cat litter, and too many paperbacks.

take one for the team: starts light with vanilla and green tea warming to the point of being cloying; darkens to tannins and a coppery reminder of martyr's blood.

you said what, now?: an eye-opening tang of gunpowder and a bitten tongue, fades to tobacco leaf offerings and a hint of scotch.

reverse racism: oppressively black licorice root over cold, bitter, black tea, an undercurrent of bleach and asylum disinfectant.

1/64th cherokee: copper-blood and tobacco, a secondary wave of the scent of damp, coarse, wool blankets, finishing with the earthy hints of stolen land.

independent press: red ginger, black spices, golden amber, and saffron, backed by Arabian musk and North African herbs.</i>


ETA5: It seems the person who's been threatened and ""outed"" is...medievalist! Yes, she's back and better than ever!

<a href=""http://hermetic.livejournal.com/149415.html?thread=350631#t350631"">I left because I was receiving fairly graphic email, and comments, that were couched in threatening language regarding anal rape. Some of them couldn't decide if I were a white hetero male, or a white hetero female. Some didn't care, and made that pretty clear. Two people contacted my former employer and said I should be fired as a homophobic racist (in one case, the caller identified me as male).

I left because I was told to sit down and shut up.

I'm sorry if I ever said anything to hurt you. You're a person of good will, and I don't want to cause you pain.

But I see no point in engaging with people who are not of good will, who are in fact manipulating others by using sock-puppets, and who are largely interested in self-aggrandizing Web traffic.

I would also urge you to read for yourself what people actually wrote, not what you're being told they wrote.</a>

medievalist, I suggest you remember that *people have screencapped your words that you tried so hard to erase and are now pretending never happened*. What you ""actually wrote"" is *on record*, much as I'm sure you wish it wasn't."

"event","Two things:

1. Yesterday, I went to megaupload to download a new Merlin vid. I've downloaded from megaupload a billion times and never had a problem but yesterday, I immediately ended up with the Virtumonde/Vundo trojan horse on my computer and I am *totally fucked*. From what I can see out there, a new extremely virulent version appeared yesterday. BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN DOWNLOADING *ANYTHING* right now, but *especially* from megaupload! If you think you have it, turn off your internet access (*all* of it)*immediately*, because goes to the web and downloads new malware to your computer for fun.

2. OMG does anybody have *any* experience removing a recent version of vundo from their computer? mr. goodnews had been trying the basic things just to *find* it and from everything we can see after much googling, pretty much *nothing* works, because it adapts and respawns with new names. The best instructions we could find wants us to run something like four different programs a bunch of times each and *maybe* we could get lucky and it can all go away. It looks like the best and safest thing we can do is reinstall windows, but I figured I'd check first.

Anyway, that's where I've been. Thank god we also have a desktop, but it's not very comfortable for me to use for more than a bit, so aside from email and searching for fun things to put on my ereader, I think today is all about going far far away and reading.


ETA: Thank you all so much for the helpful comments! Update post <a href=""http://chopchica.livejournal.com/167043.html"">here</a>."

They're all so thoughtful that I want to make sure my replies are equally as thoughtful, but I'm finding that I can only do a few a day, because this is such a personal subject for me. So I'm sorry that it's taking me so long but I promise I will get there!

As for the thanks, to everybody who left me Valentine's Day messages and graphics, thank you all so much! They were lovely to see and left me with a warm glow that is very needed in this weather."

"event","Wanna know how I feel about my Wii Fit after using it a bunch of times? <lj-cut text=""Follow the cut! Be aware this is extremely long! If you're interested in learning a lot more about the Fit and wondering if it might be right for you, you might want to read this."">


It took a really long time for my foot to heal, so I've only used the Fit four times since I got it three weeks ago - although three of them were in the last week (by the way, we are no longer sure I hurt my foot from the Wii, because every time I've used it since, there's been no issue). I've also watched mr. goodnews play on it and some friends came over last weekend and tried it as well (which is why I can review the general fun and efficacy of some of the things I haven't tried myself yet). Here are some of my conclusions.

1. If you are out of shape or an exercise beginner, it is very very very possible to get a serious workout on the fit - with lots of room for growth. 

1a - Aerobics

The hula hooping looks silly (fun but silly), but it is *extremely aerobic*. And it's a nice distraction - you're so busy keeping the hoops up and trying to catch more that you don't really get bored and sick of exercising. Even my friends who are very in shape broke a sweat during the three minute super hula hoop (this is also where I found out that my friend had been exercising to the Carmen Electra stripper workout, because, wow).

I've also been practicing with the basic step, because I lack coordination. It's got the same thing going for it where it's distracting enough that I don't get bored. And once I'm good with that, it's time for rhythm boxing! Yes, my Fit has unlocked step boxing! You use the balance board like a step and then punch forward and hit a boxing bag. It's rewarding because instead of randomly punching the air, you aim for specific targets and when you hit them, it makes a very satisfying pow noise! 

I haven't tried the running thing yet, because I'm getting more than enough from the hula hooping and stepping. Also, given that we have niceish weather here 80% of the time and I live on top of a giant walking path and have an eager dog (not to mention the free gym with treadmills and an elliptical trainer about a 30 second walk away), there's just kind of no point. If you're trapped inside and desperate to run though, once you've done some short runs, it will unlock a much longer run.

1b. Balance

I'm not sure if the balance games do anything at all to improve my balance and posture, but they sure are fun! Both mr. goodnews and I are obsessed with the ski slalom (I'm seriously considering getting him Wii Ski for his birthday - except I'm worried it'll be way less fun because it's so much less sensitive). Anyway, I love the skiing and desperately wish they had longer courses and some more variety. What's nice about the slalom is that you can control your speed, so once you master going through the flags, you can work on going through faster and faster.

The game where you have to manipulate a table to have balls go through may not be teaching me balance, but it sure teaches me *patience* and for that, it is gold.

I just unlocked the penguin on the iceberg thing and it's *adorable*! I could play it forever!

Games I avoid are the tightrope walk (it's really frustrating and doesn't feel beneficial), the ski jump (I'll play it sometimes but it feels incredibly pointless because all I do is crouch and then straighten up) and the one where you have to headbutt soccer balls (so stressful! It freaks me out. mr. goodnews adores it though - he played lots of soccer growing up). 

The snowboard game unlocked right as I finished last night, so I haven't tried it yet. It's much enjoyed by mg and our friends though.

The final game...I'm not impressed. It's great for mg, who has no ass and no bodyfat and has done years of yoga. For me? I've got a much bigger ass and sitting on the board and not moving at all is not my idea of working on my balance.

Out of every category on the Fit, it seems like balance would have an endless drawing board for games and I'm surprised that they didn't come up with more of them. I'd really love for them to design some more and either offer them on an auxiliary disc or let you get them through the Wii connection.

1c: Yoga

There are tons of poses and lots of them give you the chance to master them on a simpler level and then work toward improvement. I find doing them while standing on a small balance board to be slightly awkward, but I love how the board checks your balance and posture, so that you can work to make the pose as effective as possible.

I haven't done much of the yoga yet, because I lack all flexibility and I'm trying to loosen up with some aerobics and balance first. I wish they had more simpler poses, because as of right now, I'm very limited. It's great for mg though! 

The trainer keeps telling me how flexible I am, which is hilarous, because I am possibly the least flexible person in the world. My family has a thing where our tendons are a tiny bit too short, which makes stretching in a normal fashion almost impossible. I used to try to attend a gentle yoga class and I couldn't even do the warm up stretches - because I couldn't get into *positions to start them*. I can't do that thing where I interlace my fingers and stretch my arms over my head. I can't even stretch them out in front of me. 

Anyway, the nice thing about the Fit is I can be a complete failure on the yoga and not feel ashamed about doing so in front of other people.

Their breathing cycle seems off to me, but that might just be allergy season. I tried breathing in time to the expanding bubble and nearly hyperventilated.

I also wish there was an option to turn off the talking because the trainer never shuts up and if you want to get into some kind of zen zone, it's not gonna happen there.

1d: Strength

This is another category I haven't explored that much, but what I've tried, I like! I've mostly just done torso twists and leg extensions. mg has been pushing himself on jackknifes. 

As with the yoga, I'm unhappy about the lack of beginner exercises. There are no simple crunches - just hardcore jackknives. Once you do the one or two easy exercises, there's no medium - it's only advanced things. Beginners aren't going to be able to do side planks and pushups and jackknives. Given that the rest of the fit seems tailored way more to people who don't go to the gym, I find the strength section kind of incongruous. I feel very limited in the exercises I can do.

Something that's nice for the people doing the jackknives/pushups route is that there's a helpful whistle blow as you go, to help make sure your intervals are timed right. And it counts for you, so you won't have to worry about losing count.

In general, the lack of great strength exercises isn't a huge problem for me. There's no way the Fit would be able to check my form for simple weights, so there's no reason for me to do that through the fit. A pair of cheap weights and either a DVD or some internet pictures later, I can design a strength routine of my own. 


Anyway, my current workout is a mix of hula hooping, stepping, skiing and either the table game or the penguin game, a simple yoga pose, two strength exercises and some final breathing to calm down. I get about 20 minutes of actual exercise (as opposed to the minutes the Fit gives me - more on that below) and given how out of shape I am, I was in a full sweat and breathing hard by the time I was done. Also, my abs hurt today (thanks, torso twists!). mr goodnews doesn't break a sweat at all, but he's benefiting from the yoga form assistance and enjoying the balance games and having somebody count out his pushups and jackknives. 

And now for some negatives!

2. The remote is really annoying.

The Wii remote is huge and unwieldy. It's great for real games, but with the Fit, the only reason you need it is to advance through to the next levels. So you can put it down while you're doing things, but you need to keep leaning over to press 'A' over and over and over again (also, the tabletop I put it on gets in the way when I'm trying to do things). Or you can hold it while you exercise, but I find that annoying and distracting. I really wish they'd designed a small clicker that you could clip to your shirt or tuck into your pants.


3. The exercise minutes are *hugely* inflated.

For some reason, the Fit likes to award way more time than the exercises actually take. The beginner hula hoop is 70 seconds of hula hooping and the Fit calculates it as two minutes. The Fit also doesn't differentiate between more serious exercise and balance games. When I play the table and ball game and make it all the way through, the Fit sees this as four minutes of ""exercise"". Unless you're tracking yourself, it's hard to figure how much *actual* exercise you get. I've found I often need to shave off about ten minutes from the total - 1/3 of the time the Fit calculates.


4. The Fit is all about shaming.

The exercises themselves and your personal trainer are very supportive, but the main Wii ""character"" - which you *have* to go through every time you start up the Fit - lives to put on a shaming guilt trip. I get admonished for not exercising every day; it makes a sad face when I don't want to hear a fitness tip; a little voice goes ""that's obese!"" whenever I get weighed (more on that below); and if you've gained any weight, your only options for why involve ""bad"" things (more on that below as well). I assume it's possible to skip the body test/weighing portion of the Fit, but you still have to go through the beginning menu and get lectured on how long it's been since you were there (plus, I have a feeling if you skip the body tests, it lectures you about that as well).


5. The weight tracking is extremely inconsistent - and again, involves shaming. 

Over the first ten days of having the Wii, it calculated my weight as changing by *seventeen pounds*. I'd gain and lose eight pounds in a two-day period.

Whenever you ""gain"" weight, the Fit asks you to pick a reason why, and there's no skipping that screen. Every single option involves ""bad"" behavior: snacking too much between meals, not feeling like exercising, eating too big of a dinner, etc. There are no options for the fact that people's weight can vary by as much as five pounds throughout the day, that you might be weighing yourself at a different time of day than the last one, that you might have just eaten, that changing your fat to muscle can add weight. There's not even an option for having been sick recently. The *only* reason you can have gained weight is because you lack eating control or are too lazy to exercise.

And it doesn't just do it to people it considers to be overweight. It just cares what your future goal is and calculates from that. mr. goodnews is *underweight* (he's freakishly skinny). One night, he ate a burrito before playing on the Fit. He (obviously) gained two pounds and it did the exact same shaming thing to him, even though he was still underweight (on the plus, it gave him a little look at what it's like to not have thin privilege - he was pretty shaken by how bad it made him feel, even though he *knew* he hadn't done anything wrong).

Also, I've mentioned this before, but it really annoys the fuck out of me that the Fit keeps telling me that I am obese - and not just obese, but at almost the very top of the scale. I weight 165. I wear a size 14/16. I am fat, yes, but in no *universe* do I qualify as obese enough to be at the very top of the BMI scale! If I can't trust it to categorize me right on this front, I can't trust it to categorize me right on *any* front. It seems to do a very standard height/weight calculation and your general fitness score and age doesn't account for your level of exercise, whether or not you smoke, etc.


So, given numbers 2-5, is the number one reason enough to get a Fit? For me, the answer is an unequivocal YES! I don't use the Wii to calculate actual minutes of exercise and I really don't care that its weight is all over the scale. I can *buy* a scale if I feel that much of a need to track. The remote thing is annoying but not a giant detriment. The only thing I have an issue with is the shaming. I can't imagine why they thought overweight people would want to hear *more* shaming instead of positive encouragement. It's great that the personal trainer section offers positive encouragement, but the start-up and anything you do to assess your body only gives negative feedback. There's no ""tomorrow is another day"" or ""I know you can do it!"" It's just ""stop eating so much and slacking off exercise"". So if you have serious triggers when it comes to weight and shame, you might want to reconsider a Fit. As for me, it annoys me but it doesn't trigger me or make me want to cry. I just roll my eyes and head toward the hula hoops.

Anyway, all of those issues are pretty negligible to me, because what matters most is the *actual exercise* and the Fit delivers in spades! I can get a serious workout and have a blast doing so. I don't get bored and I feel constantly challenged. I don't need to leave my living room and I can use it whenever I want, for as long as I want. If I want to do a bunch of five minute bursts during the day, I can! If I want to do 30 minutes all at once, I can! I don't need to worry about how out of shape I am or how bad my form is, because nobody is there but me and I can strive toward improvement while being sure I'm actually doing things right.

If exercise isn't a huge part of your life and you'd like it to be, the Fit might be for you. If you want to improve your yoga form or balance, the Fit might be for you. If you want somebody to count along while you do pushups and jackknives, the Fit might be for you. It's perfect for me and mr. goodnews enjoys it mightily. In fact, after hearing me talk about it, my dad bought one (and a Wii, of course) last week. Our friends who played with it here really want one as well.

I'm super glad I got it and (aside from the upper body weights stuff) I expect it to be more than enough to help me get in shape - for a very long while. </lj-cut>

Okay, that was like a Wii Fit *manifesto*! I think I'm just so happy to be posting about something that isn't the fail of others!"

"event","Hi, friendslist and assorted other people scrolling by! I have a question about the Wii and would really appreciate your knowledge.

mr. goodnews turns 30 in two weeks and my parents are looking for a present for him. I mentioned that mg is deeply adoring playing Guitar Hero III, but he's been bummed that we only have one guitar, because he can't play with anybody else. So I suggested a new guitar.

My dad decided to go one step further and wants to get him Guitar Hero World Tour - which has both a guitar *and* lots of fun new songs. However, the description of the game talks a lot about the upgraded guitar and gameplay.

So my question is, will the guitars work between both games? Because the last thing we need is *two* guitars that can't be combined for him to play with anybody else!"

"event","Something horrible has happened. Late last night, I finished the final story in my Unread Merlin Stories PDF on my ereader. And then, when I woke up, there was *nothing left*!

Yes, as of now, I have read *every single good story in the entire Merlin fandom*! I have read them *all*. I have even read all of the mediocre ones! Pretty much the only stories I haven't read (and will *never* read no matter how much <strike><lj user=seperis></strike> certain people try to force me to read The One Where Merlin Is A Catboy).

And this isn't even a request for recs, because, seriously, I've read *every single story*! There is nothing left you can point me to that I haven't read (except for the aforementioned Catboy-style stories, and Pru's au, because I don't bother with wips I am 99% sure won't be finished, and syllic's new one because I trying to wait until it's all done although I expect to give that up shortly).

How did this happen? When I started reading, I was all, ""well, it's not like I'll ever run out of Merlin fic! After all, there's so much! And it's not even a serious fandom for me!"" And yet, three weeks later, I have read *everything there is* and watched all the episodes and lots of vids and have favorite things I want to rec and want to get some snarky Merlin icons even though all of the other fandoms I love reading have never inspired me to icons and have serious discussions with Jenn about how if Arthur and Merlin ever got married, would Arthur make Merlin wear a Wedding Hat, and then Jenn forces me to watch a vid with the griffin running in time to Evanesance's Bring Me Back To Life and then we discuss what songs vids should be made to and after suggesting Fading Like A Flower I realize that more seriously, I want somebody to do an entire *series* of vids to Depeche Mode songs (I mean, Never Let Me Down Again? Policy of Truth? Walking In My Shoes? *Master and Servant*? Would this not be the *greatest thing ever*?) How did this *happen*?

What will I do with myself now! (hint: this is where my entire friendslist and all other assorted awesome writers in the fannish world tell me they are minutes away from posting a 40,000 word story and/or makes me some snarky Merlin icons with witty sayings).


ETA: <lj user=skoosiepants> and your amazing set of <a ref=""http://delicious.com/houseofpants/arthur%2Fmerlin"">delicous links</a>? I blame *you*. Please feel free to make it up to me with some fic!"

"event","To whomever nominated my stories for the McShep awards:

Thank you so very much! It's a complete honor to be nominated! However, I personally believe that the only stories that should compete in awards should be written after the last awards have ended, instead of recycling the same stories over and over along with new ones. Since I haven't written anything new since the last awards (given that I'm not really writing at all anymore), I'm going to pull myself out of the running. 

Again, though, thank you! I honestly hadn't realized anybody was still reading my stories, let alone thinking they qualified for an award! It was a lovely surprise to get in my inbox."

"event","So, why doesn't Elizabeth Bear choose to answer <a href=""http://matociquala.livejournal.com/1549883.html?thread=31143995#t31143995"">some very reasonable questions posed to her about her behavior over the past week?</a>

<i>Because I did not participate in those discussions, or frankly even read most of them, and I have no intention of reading them.

Because I am an adult, and I do not take responsibility for the actions of people other than myself.

Because I am only the arbiter of my own behavior.

Because in this blog, I make an attempt to allow even people I disagree with to comment, and I have done so since I started keeping it. It is my space, and I run it as I see fit, not to please anyone else or suit anyone else's agenda.

Because if I were to play ethical arbiter, I would have to say that I think there was plenty of bad behavior, name-calling, and baiting to go around.

Because I have no intention of justifying myself to you, or anyone else.

Because as I already said, I am not going to take sides.

Because I don't honestly care what *anyone* involved in the discussion thinks of me, except for the select few persons I consider friends.

Although it's a charge that's been leveled at me repeatedly, I'm not here to collect some sort of cookie or establish myself as a well-behaved antiracist ally. I grew up inside a very similar ideological machine, and I find them generally destructive.

I'm not here to defend myself. I'm not here to accuse anyone or cast blame. It doesn't interest me, because I think it's far more important to educate people and encourage them to do something about changing the world than engaging in circular firing squads on the internet.</i>

And

<i>I was raised in New England. I grew up in a house with a sadistic borderline personality. My chosen literary genre is the comedy of ethics. Do not confuse my politeness, my willingness to listen to criticism, or my acceptance of the need to sometimes take one for the team with moral cowardice, a susceptibility to bullying, or any plans to throw any of my friends under the bus whether I disagree with them or not.

Yes, I pretty much expect to see my name blackened all over the internet for saying so. I don't care, and you could do me a favor and not care either. And if you have to care, do it someplace other than my journal, kthanx.

The dogs bark. The caravan moves on.  

On this last point, I will not be taking questions. And I might just start banning people any minute now.</i>


Wow, stay *classy*, Elizabeth Bear! And to be even *classier*, how about you throw in some <a href=""http://matociquala.livejournal.com/1551472.html"">bragging about your increased book sales<a/>, due to the way <a href=""http://rydra-wong.livejournal.com/"">you and your friends engaged in race-baiting and insulting everybody who dared to disagree with you as stupid, misogynistic, manipulative, spoiled brats, not educated enough to read text, blog-whoring, *orcing*, and finally as abusers</a>. 


Elizabeth Bear, Sarah Monette, Emma Bull, Patrick Neilson Hayden, Will Shetterly, mac-stone and <lj user=medievalist>: I will never spend a penny of my money on any of your words. For those of you who teach, I feel so very sorry for your students. I will make sure that for the rest of my life, whenever I hear anybody reccing or suggesting your works or ""wisdom"", that they are given the full details of just how obnoxious, cruel, petty and *unapologetically racist* each and every one of you is. 

I really doubt any of you are listening, but just in case, maybe this one time it'll get through your head. When you're all sitting around and patting yourselves on the back for being so open-minded about addressing your privilege right after dismissing, belittling and outright attacking anybody non-white who challenges your POV; when you decide to <a href=""http://coffeeandink.livejournal.com/881830.html"">start a ""diversity project"" where POC are initially only invited to edit slush pile entries and then you cheer yourselves on because now you can have the race discussion in the place and tone that *you* choose to have it in</a>; when you make a post screaming and crying for being called out on your racist behavior and finish with a little dig at how you'll get over it because actual racism is worse - and then you continue to *ignore people who have suffered actual racism trying to talk to you about it*? When you do all of these things and *every single person who agrees with you is white*? YOU. HAVE. A. PROBLEM.

I feel sorry for all of you. I feel sorry for myself for ever having a second of respect or liking for any of you. But most of all, I feel sorriest for the people that you tried to victimize, demoralize and silence - the people that you have never apolgized to; the people that you never *will* apologize to. Every single one of them is a million times better than the lot of you put together. I'll read their words any day, and I will never read any of yours again.

By the way, I doubt any of you will ever see this or attempt to comment, but if you do, you will find that I have pre-emptively banned all of you. Until you respect the voices of others and choose to stop silencing them, I see no reason to respect yours and will continue to do the same.

ETA: I'm adding Theresa Neilson Hayden/<lj user=tnh> to my list of fail. In fact, at the moment, I'm considering <a href=""http://tnh.livejournal.com/6256.html"">her</a> the <a href=""http://spiralsheep.livejournal.com/276263.html"">failiest</a> <a href=""http://coffeeandink.livejournal.com/888012.html"">of them all</a>.


ETA Feb 1: <lj user=tnh> has now <a href=""http://chopchica.livejournal.com/163464.html"">failed so hard it is visible from *space*</a>

Meanwhile, <lj user=coffeeem> aka Emma Bull has offered <a href=""http://coffeeem.livejournal.com/104325.html"">an apology</a>, which appears to at least be made in good faith."

"event","So I got my Wii and the Fit. On the one hand, I am full of much much love. On the other hand, I have possibly entered an abusive relationship.

<lj-cut text=""The Good""> It's hella fun! We played around with the Wii Sports game a bit to get a handle on how to use the remotes. I totally suck at everything and mr. goodnews rocks of course. Watching him try the boxing was *hilarious*. He went from tentative jabs to beating the crap out of the other guy in about thirty seconds and was wildly into it.

The Fit was even more fun and incredibly cool. We took turns trying stuff out. It was a bit of a bummer to watch my Mii get quite fat while his Mii got even thinner (mg is a stick), but I already knew I was fat and I'd rather exercise as my body type than as some skinny and tall not-me. One thing to be aware of though is that it's not the most accurate or reliable in terms of how it tracks weight. My BMI was calculated solely on height and weight and has me at the top level of obese. I'm fat, yes, but I'm seriously not even *close* to obese (I wear a size 14 and I refuse to believe that one size up from ""normal"" sizing in stores classifies me as obese). Also, mg weighed two more pounds the second day and there was no option for ""this happened because I just ate dinner and you gain weight right after eating."" There were only options like, ""I ate too much"" or ""I snacked"". So he got some lecture about not eating too much (even though he is *underweight*), which means that unless you use the fit at the exact same time of day every day, it's not going to account for the general variation of weight that happens throughout the day. Also, it tracked my age by how well I did on some balancing test. There's nothing in there about if you smoke or what your general level of fitness is or if you swim or play sports or anything at all. mg's age dropped ten years in one day because he got better on a balance test. I take everything the Fit tells me with a giant grain of salt.

The really nice thing about it is that you're having so much fun with stuff that you don't notice that you're exerting yourself. My favorite thing for that is the hula hoop. I was so busy trying to keep my hoop from falling down and trying to catch all of the hoops being thrown at me that I did a whole bunch of aerobic activity without getting bored.  Exercises like slalom skiing or tightrope walking help balance you out and are incredibly entertaining. mg did some yoga poses and strength training and is planning on doing a bunch more yoga (mostly he wanted to ski though. He really misses skiing. I think I see Wii Ski in our very near future).

The Fit is perfect for me because I am very not in shape and I barely have any physical energy (due to side effects from a med I am taking). Breaking it up into very very small amounts and choosing the level of what will work for me gives me a chance to do a chopchica-sized workout without leaving the apartment (because, seriously, my energy is so low right now that by the time I get to the beginning of our walking path, I'm done). The Fit also gives me the chance to do a few minutes at a time at various points of the day. My plan is to start with an emphasis on the balance games and hula hooping and some very easy yoga, and then to slowly push myself harder. Between the Fit, some baby weights I have around here, and my eventual desire to do crunches, I could work out at home for *months* without needing anything more. mg is interested in serious yoga (he also goes to classes and is incredibly good at yoga, so unless some really hardcore poses show up, this doesn't really do it for him), improving his balance and doing more strength-training. He runs a few times a week (or ever day, when we count Pasha time), so the aerobics don't interest him.

My conclusion is that the Fit is really good for people who feel intimidated by gyms (or too lazy to go - I am one of those people!), want to improve their balance, and want to get better at yoga poses without going to classes (it tracks your balance as you go and makes sure you learn to do the pose right). It's good for challenging yourself to improve in terms of balance and precision and exercise-level. It's fun to track your progress and get encouragement. We mostly got the fit for me. mg is in really good shape and rocks the yoga. He'll have fun playing with the Fit, but it's not really going to do anything for him. </lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""The Bad""> I woke up the next morning with an agonizing pain in my big toe. I don't know if it was the hula hooping or tightrope walking or ski jumping, but I sprained the everliving hell out of it (or broke it, but I am assuming not). It's in *incredible* pain and I don't even know just what it was I did to hurt it, or if I'm capable of playing without doing it again. I made the mistake of leaving the apartment to go to lunch with <lj user=logovo> yesterday (the lunch wasn't a mistake, just the part where I drove and walked was) and now it's even worse today. I had lunch plans with another friend and a doctor's appointment, and I had to cancel everything so I can sit around with my foot up. Aleve and muscle rub have barely taken the edge off the pain and I'm extremely worried that I won't be able to use the Fit at all. Either way, I'm not going to be able to use *anything* for at least a few more days. It's very frustrating, because, Wii, I don't want to quit you! I wanted to start using it! And maybe I won't be able to use it at all! 

Some other things I don't like are the bad weight tracking and that I have to do all exercising and yoga poses with a remote in my hand. Also, if you're stretched for time, the Fit can waste a lot of it with end scores and scrolling place-markers. Ten minutes of exercise takes more like fifteen. Also, there's no way to do Yoga that's anything but physical posing. The trainer is constantly talking and you end up focusing on your balance a lot and trying to get into the right position. If you do Yoga for relaxation and you already feel comfortable with the poses, this isn't for you. If you want to learn to do poses (or learn to do them right), it's perfect for practicing for future actual Yoga.</lj-cut>


Conclusion: Assuming I recover from my sports injury (I've always wanted to say that!), the Fit is perfect for me (a completely beginner and physical loser). It's fun for mg (already very in shape and down with the Yoga). It's a lovely addition to our household."

"event","The Quest For A Wii:


Us: Ooh, the Wii has already shipped! And it should be here on Jan 13! Yay!

Fed Ex: Jan 12 - 6:56 AM: At local FedEx facility, San Diego

Us: Ooh, it's already in San Diego!

Fed Ex: 7:59 AM, On FedEx vehicle for delivery 

Us: OMG!

Me: *stays awake all freaking day waiting and waiting and waiting for Fed Ex, because I have a feeling they won't just drop itwithout a signature and I am so exhausted and really need to sleep but I have to stay awake and it sucks*

Fed Ex: *doesn't come*

Me: WTF?

Fed Ex: 3:40 PM - At local FedEx facility:
Package not due for delivery   	

Me: <b>WTF!!!!!</b>

Yes, my Wii *rode around on the delivery truck all day yesterday* and then went back to the Fed Ex facility because it's not due for delivery until today! THAT IS THE STUPIDEST SYSTEM I HAVE EVER SEEN!

Meanwhile:

Wii Fit: *arrives, along with space heater*


So we have a Fit but no Wii and we have a space heater even though it's in the '80s all week and incredibly sunny. Also, the Provigil looks like it's working a bit (and is covered by my insurance!) but I've been feeling more down since I started taking it. I feel like I'm living in the Gift of the Magi over here or something.

mr. goodnews thinks instead of me being more depressed I'm just feeling more emotion (like when I watched the end credits to WALL-E and possibly almost started crying). I do not *want* to feel more emotion! I am very fine emoting at the level of a brand new robot!"

"event","Man, is it piss in people's Cheerios week or *what*?

I just have to say, whenever I see somebody making posts accusing everybody who likes a popular fandom or pairing of only liking that fandom because they're a sheep or a lemming, I instantly realize that in their heads, they are the alterna-punk edgy decider of *real* taste who would *never* go along with the pack! And we'd better know that! No really! They're just the specialist snowflake in the whole blizzard and everybody else is contaminating them with their maintream cooties. They're Bender in The Breakfast Club, and you know, when I was a teenager? I *did* think Bender was really cool. Now that I'm an adult? I want to shove him under a bus until he stops yapping about how he's better than everybody else because he doesn't dress/talk/think/act like them. He's a poser, and so are 99% of the people making these posts. If you're *really* unconventional, you don't *care* what other people like or do. You don't waste your time obsessing about them - especially when you obsess for *years*, or try your hardest to sway everybody in the entire universe of fandom over to your side.

I know this is going to be really really hard for some of you to hear, but high school is over. I know that for some of you it's never ended and it shapes your entire world view, but it's *over*. Really. So you can either work on finally growing up, or you can yap like a Pomeranian all you want. If it helps, I promise you *are* Really Special."

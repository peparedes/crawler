I heard the most amazing song on the radio on the fri/saturday the 13/14th at about 2:30ish AM
I have no idea what it was called
or who played it
or even what station it was on.

All I know is someone needs to find out who it is, you'll know when you hear it.
Until then, anyone wanna chance a guess on who it was?"

"event","We are two mariners
Our ship's sole survivors
In this belly of a whale
It's ribs are ceiling beams
It's guts are carpeting
I guess we have some time to kill

You may not remember me
I was a child of three
And you, a lad of eighteen
But, I remember you
And I will relate to you
How our histories interweave
At the time you were
A rake and a roustabout
Spending all your money
On the whores and hounds
(oh, oh)

You had a charming air
All cheap and debonair
My widowed mother found so sweet
And so she took you in
Her sheets still warm with him
Now filled with filth and foul disease
As time wore on you proved
A debt-ridden drunken mess
Leaving my mother
A poor consumptive wretch
(oh, oh)

And then you disappeared
Your gambling arrears
The only thing you left behind
And then the magistrate
Reclaimed our small estate
And my poor mother lost her mind
Then, one day in spring
My dear sweet mother died
But, before she did
I took her hand as she, dying, cried:
(oh, oh)

""Find him, find him
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters
Drag him to a hole until he
Wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling
Of his grave""

It took me fifteen years
To swallow all my tears
Among the urchins in the street
Until a priory
Took pity and hired me
To keep their vestry nice and neat
But, never once in the employ
Of these holy men
Did I ever, once turn my mind
From the thought of revenge
(oh, oh)

One night I overheard
The prior exchanging words
With a penitent whaler from the sea
The captain of his ship
Who matched you toe to tip
Was known for one cruel deed
The following day
I shipped to sea
With a privateer
And in the whistle
Of the wind
I could almost hear
(oh, oh)

""Find him, find him
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters
Drag him to a hole until he
Wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling
Of his grave

There is one thing I must say to you
As you sail across the sea
Always, your mother will watch over you
As you avenge this wicked deed""

And then, that fateful night
We had you in our sight
After twenty months, it seemed
Your starboard flank abeam
I was getting my muskets clean
When came this rumbling from beneath
The ocean shook
The sky went black
And the captain quailed
And before us grew
The angry jaws
Of a giant whale

(oh..)

Don't know how I survived
The crew all was chewed alive
I must have slipped between his teeth
But, oh, what providence
What divine intelligence
That you should survive
As well as me
It gives my eye great joy
To see your eyes fill with fear
To lean in close
And I will whisper
The last words you'll hear
(oh, oh)

someone, neigh TWO people reported me to the teacher in my COMPARITIVE RELIGIONS class for cheating on my test yesterday. I find it hilarious that ""advanced studies"" kids feel it is their duty to tell on me because they regard the class so highly. I MIGHT be able to see someone giving me up to the teacher if everyone in it was going to go into the comparitive religions field, even though there isnt one and the class is UTTER BULLSHIT.

so starting a new semester with an E is always fun. I wish I knew who told Mrsfuckinginsane Miller so I could laugh at thier face. Im suprised she didn't catch me herself, I wasn't trying to hide my cheating, my packet was out the whole time and I got almost every answer off of it. And she uses the word ""ironic"" in the wrong context a lot, which really pisses me off. I'm actually not that upset; I know the class is in no way going to help me out in life so I'm not worried, but everyone loves to bitch."

when you start to raise your head?
And does he sing to you incessantly
in the space between your bed and wall?
Does he walk around all day at school
With his feet in your shoes?
And looking down every few steps
to pretend he walks with you?
Oh does he know that place below your neck
that is your favourite to be touched?
And does he cry through broken sentences like
I love you far too much?
Does he lay awake listening to your breath
Worried you smoke too many cigarettes?
Is he coughing now
on a bathroom floor?
For every spec of tile 
there's a thousand more
You won't ever see
But you must hold inside yourself
Eternally

Well I drug your ghost across the country
And we plotted out my death
In every city in memories we whispered
'Here is where you rest'
I was deteremined in Chicago
But I dug my teeth into my knees
And I settled for a telephone
and sang into your machine

You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine

And I kissed a girl with a broken jaw that her father gave to her
She had eyes bright enough to burn me
They reminded me of yours
And in a story told
She was a little girl
In a red-rouge, sun-bruised field
And there were rows of ripe tomatoes
Where a secret was concealed.
And it rose like thunder,
Clapped under our hands.
And it stretched for centuries
to a diary entry's end
Where I wrote
You make me happy
When skies are grey
You make me happy
oh when skies are grey
and grey and grey
Where the clock's heart it hangs inside it's open chest
With it's hands stretched towards the calendar hanging itself
But I will not weep
For those dying days
Where all the ones who've left
There's a few that stayed
And they found me here
And pulled me from the grass
Where I was laid."

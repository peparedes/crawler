 anywho, I did get a job until something better comes up.  I groveled back on my knees, pleading for my old job back. 
 okay, well in reality, I went in and signed some papers, and got my job back because basically, it's a joke.  Thats right ladies and gents, I am back at WEST!!!!! yuck... But it'll do until someone calls me back, offering something else.  I went to Toys R Us today.  almost as appealling as west, but a tad better.  I don't know yet about school, I guess I'm going to get on the ball about things as they say, and apply for spring semester and get the financial aid stuff going again.  Or maybe fall, who knows???  well, gonna go, I need to do some other stuff."

   Anyways.  
       I went to staffmark today and the suburbia queen that worked there, (you know the type, all plastic smiles and prerehearsed laughs, the one that was like homecoming queen in her high school in like 95, the one that married her high school sweetheart and is now like all knocked up and has 2 kids and has never lived a life other than F.smith)  
          well, she hired me for a clerical job, but has to check out my references first.  I'll probably be working in a dentist office or something, wearing the cutiepatootie scrubs and sneakers, working my way up the ladder of suburban success, until......tadah!! I am a dental assistant, and I become everything I hate, the women that gossip and chat all day about all their life threatening problems, you know,""How am i ever going to pick up andrew by 3:30, take him to soccer practice, get groceries, take sarah to girl scouts, pick up the drycleaning and make it to the bank by 5:00?""  ahhhhhhhhh, the joys of my future....
     well, anyways, still waiting to hear from my old buddies, where ya at????

"event","The Boob Poem 
For years and years they told me, 
Be careful of your breasts. 
Don't ever squeeze or bruise them. 
And give them monthly tests. 
So I heeded all their warnings, 
And protected them by law. 
Guarded them very carefully, 
And I always wore my bra. 
After 30 years of astute care, 
My gyno, Dr. Pruitt, 
Said I should get a Mammogram. 
""O.K,"" I said, ""let's do it."" 
""Stand up here real close"" she said, 
(She got my boob in line), 
""And tell me when it hurts,"" she said, 
""Ah yes! Right there, that's fine."" 
She stepped upon a pedal, 
I could not believe my eyes! 
A plastic plate came slamming down, 
My hooter's in a vise! 
My skin was stretched and mangled, 
From underneath my chin. 
My poor boob was being squashed, 
To Swedish Pancake thin. 
Excruciating pain I felt, 
Within it's vise-like grip. 
A prisoner in this vicious thing, 
My poor defenseless tit! 
""Take a deep breath"" she said to me, 
Who does she think she's kidding?!? 
My chest is mashed in her machine, 
And woozy I am getting. 
""There, that's good,"" I heard her say, 
(The room was slowly swaying.) 
""Now, let's have a go at the other one."" 
Have mercy, I was praying. 
It squeezed me from both up and down, 
It squeezed me from both sides. 
I'll bet SHE'S never had this done, 
To HER tender little hide. 
Next time that they make me do this, 
I will request a blindfold. 
I have no wish to see again, 
My knockers getting steamrolled. 
If I had no problem when I came in, 
I surely have one now. 
If there had been a cyst in there, 
It would have gone ""ker-pow!"" 
This machine was created by a man, 
Of this, I have no doubt. 
I'd like to stick his balls in there, 
And see how THEY come out. 

hehe aint it cute i got it in a e-mail"

You are a dreamer.  Constantly filling your mind with fantasies, you withdraw inside yourself in order to experience these more clearly.  You dislike people and the distractions they cause.  You are eccentric and lack a firm grasp on reality.  You experience a wide range of emotions, and can often times be dangerous to yourself and others.  You need to focus more on the real world.<br>

Didn't get much sleep on the bus ride home, fell asleep somehow for about 45 minutes and then when I woke up, my pillow was switched with A.J.'s and Ben was switched with A.J. somehow... so then mr. Cromer had gone mad and decided to go to Denny's at 4:00 in the morning, so me and Tasha stayed on the bus and slept.  San Antonio was fun, but I missed Richard so much.  Got some random hot guy telling me I was hot!  Kinda weird, then Ashley and Sarah decided to take it upon themselves to get his phone number, ahhh!! crazy, I won't call him, I love Richard, but makes me feel kinda good.  anyways.  last week of school.  kinda getting to me.  I don't know.

We perform concert music all year, even follies songs were stuffy and his choices.  I think we should do songs that people know.  Like anything besides the Jesus songs. Now, I am not an atheist, but every song we sing is about Jesus.  Or a saint.  We're in public school, if I wanted to sing about god, its called church, or Van Buren Christian.  City called Heaven, I hate to say, is going to suck ass.  Huge, cellulite ridden ass.  The choir part is the same note over and over and most of the soloists just don't work with that song.  They may sing well normally, but on an african gospel song, no, I think not.  You need some soul to belt that out and sound acceptable.  Anyways.  gonna go, got some work to do."

Sightings of the unicorn have been reported from all over the world, even in these modern times. Unicorns are pure and incurruptible. In China, unicorns symbolised gentleness, good will, and wisdom. Christianity links the unicorn with Christ. It is said that unicorns would only allow virgin girls to see them, let alone touch them. They were easily lured into fatal ambushes by a virgin with some potchers waiting for the unicorn in nearby bushes. A unicorn's horn was a highly prised possesion, which was reputed to have great healing capabilities. With the touch of its horn, a unicorn could bring back a person who had been dead for several hours. But when disattached from the unicorn's body, the magic was suggnificantly reduced and could only protect against poison. The unicorn had the body of a horse, a unique spirling horn, and a lion's tail. They were pure white in color. Congragulations, you are a rarity amoung mythical beasts. There aren't enough of people like you in the world.<br>

Another drug occurence in the child's media.  Alice in Wonderland.  Great movie right?  Right.  Drugs.  everywhere.  I'm sitting there watching this movie the other night at my mom's house, ( I am a Disney child) and I start noticing things I did not notice when I was 6.  Alice drinks this stuff at the beginning kind of, after she falls down the rabbit hole, that makes her shrink, then get bigger, and so on.  Yeah, Alice is drunk!! 
Then at Rabbits house, she eats some candy or something and she shrinks, then gets bigger.  Her legs stick out of rabbits house.  She's drugged on something.  Then she meets the chesire cat, a messed up feline with a smile bigger than Julia Roberts and he talks to her and dissapears.  She's tripping.  Hallucinogins.  She then meets a caterpillar sitting on top of a mushroom smoking a bong.  AAhhh!!!  ""And who are YOU?""  he asks.  he's high.  then at the caterpillars peer pressure, she eats shrooms.  gets really big and then really small.  she's tripping on shrooms.  does anyone not see this?  there are drugs all over the children's cartoons!!

You say he's a Jew, do you want to hurt his kids tonight?
You say he's a Jew, he'll never wear that funny hat again.
You say he's a Jew as though being born were a sin.
Oh Jew, oh Jew, do you hate him
Cause he's pieces of you?"

She's got a smile that it seems to me 
Reminds me of childhood memories 
Where everything 
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
Now and then when I see her face 
She takes me away to that special place 
And if I stared too long 
I'd probably break down and cry 

Sweet child o' mine 
Sweet love of mine 

She's got eyes of the bluest skies 
As if they thought of rain 
I hate to look into those eyes 
And see an ounce of pain 
Her hair reminds me 
of a warm safe place 
Where as a child I'd hide 
And pray for the thunder 
And the rain 
To quietly pass me by 

Sweet child o' mine 
Sweet love of mine 

Where do we go 
Where do we go now 
Where do we go 
Sweet child o' mine 


 Tomorrow it'll be 12 years that my dad died.  When I was little, my dad used to sing this song to me when I went to sleep.  He could play the guitar and sing really well.  This will always be  my favorite song in the whole world.  
   I love you daddy."

"event","well today was going okay until 6th period.  I'm sitting there and hoping that Mrs. Dewitt doesn't draw my name and guess what?  She does, the first name she called was mine.  It wouldn't be so bad except that the speech was on us.  Our personal life story.  Mine is not a brady bunch tale, the hardest thing I've ever had to accomplish is far beyond making an A on a chem test or making cheerleading, my life is a constant downer.  Like the past you know, and I think that I shouldn't have to tell complete strangers about my life.  I shouldn't have to explain myself or justify foster care.  I hate telling people that I'm in foster care you know.  Especially people that I don't know.  Their response is either two things, either they pity you and feel sorry for you because your life hasn't been peachy keen, or they criticize you.  I feel like when people find out what has happened in my past, they are constantly analyzing me and what could be wrong with me.  I just want to scream "" I didn't do anything wrong, my parents fucked up, not me. I survived and didn't turn out too messed up.  I didn't drop out of school in the 10th grade, haven't turned into a major druggie, never been in a mental hospital (unlike most foster children) and I maintain a healthy- I guess you could call it that- relationship with my mother. So get over it and treat me like a normal human being!!!!!!!!!!!!""  Sorry, just had to get that out.  Anyways, I'm gonna go for now."

a half a dozen places he'd rather be
and furthermore it looks like he's prepared
to take it all out on me
buddy, i don't really care what your problem is
just don't make it mine
come on kids, let's all hold hands
and pretend we're having a good time

maybe you don't like your job
maybe you didn't get enough sleep
well, nobody likes their job
nobody got enough sleep
maybe you just had
the worst day of your life
but, you know, there's no escape
and there's no excuse
so just suck up and be nice

all the privileged white kids on tv
playing at death
brandishing their cold cuts 
with their ghostly makeup 
and their heroin breath
and all the little fishes are flapping wildly
on their hooks
while all the top critics find great meaning 
in the telephone book

the little emperor he has no clothes
so he can't come out to play
and besides which life is suffering
and he likes it that way
and the little guy is not so friendly
but you know life has been cruel
so wipe that smile off your face baby
and try to be cool

yeah, i would like to perfect the art
of being studiously aloof
like life is just a boring chore
and i am living proof
i could join forces with an army
of ornery hipsters
but then i guess i'd be out of a job
so i guess that's out of the picture

I don't like missing school, its just my back hurts a lot and I can't take the pain medicine the doctor gave me at school because I can't even walk when I'm on it.  (They're narcotics)  They make me so drowsy, I sleep all day.  I was going to go to school today but the doctor told me not to return to school until monday, so ms. pat won't let me go back to school until monday.  You know what I realized?  I missed the last spirit week at school. That we graduate in 3 months.  It's weird to think of that.  Well, anyways, I'm gonna go for now, I'm kind of tired."

"event","I have come to the final realization that I truly love Rich.  With every thing in my body.  I know it's mush mush for a lot of you, but I have felt a lot of hesitation lately.  I know why now.  I was scared of loving someone that much.  With every bone in my body.  With every inch of my soul and mind and spirit.  He makes me so happy and he treats me as if I am the best thing in his life.  I don't think I have ever been loved so much by anyone in my life.  Maybe my dad.  Maybe my mom.  But never with this much intensity.  He takes care of me.  He respects me.  He knows me.  I love him.


I've run from these feelings for so long
Telling my heart I didn't mean it
Pretending that I was better off alone
But I know that it's just a lie
So afraid of taking a chance again
So afraid of what I'd feel inside

But I need to be next to you
I need to share every breath with you
I need to know I can see you smiling each morning
Look into your eyes each night
For the rest of my life

Here with you, Near with you
Oh I
I need to be next to you

Right here with you is right where I belong
I'd lose my mind if I could see you
Without you there is nothing in this life
That would make life worth living for
I can't bear the thought of you not there
I can't fight what I feel anymore

'Cause I need to be next to you
I need to share every breath with you
I need to know I can see you smiling each morning
Look into your eyes each night
For the rest of my life

Here with you, Near with you
Oh I
I need to be next to you

I need to have your heart next to mine
For all times
Hold you for all my life
I need to be next to you

I need to be next to you
Need to be need to be next to you
Share every breath with you
I need to feel you in my arms babe
In my arms, babe
I need to be next to you

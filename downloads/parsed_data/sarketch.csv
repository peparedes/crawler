"event","Hamster dance fever! I'm on another natural high tonite, even though my internet is botching up, and my drawing skills are el lamentatio but I'm enjoying what days left of this term. I'm also going to get a maths tutor, which I am overly excited about. I want to get back into drawing and studying, and meet some new people! Maybe even catch up with some old school people in the city.

On the other hand, I'm slowly installing more games into my computer, a big sin! But I shall persevere and play as less as possible... If that's even possible. On the other hand, I'm helping my friend with some ragnarok online coding shortly, to shorten the release date of World of Ragnarok Online, the heavily modded ragnarok server. A name befitting of such a good server.

I'm sucking at all my subjects :< But fear me, as the days will draw to a close and I shall remain the last one standing."

"event","I know I am! :D I had a good 2 hour furry flash movie session today, and I'm left in a somewhat feel good happy mood. Looking forward to tonite, with my super awesome all night icafe day. God save the Queens Birthday! I wonder if she's dead yet... And isn't this the second one? I want 2 birthdays! Rawr!~

On the other hand, I need to catch up with my studies, and drawing... And stop playing dota... RO2 is pretty good :D, would be better if dimago was released though, as well as in english. The quests make me sad :<... Although I learned a valuable lesson today: If you can't find it on land, IT'S IN THE WATER!!! :D

Numa Numa Iei.... Heee... This flash movie has spirit."

"event","after the hurricane i bounced around a few cities for a couple of weeks and ended up at jills in mandeville. my house flooded and its a moldy mess so until it gets fixed (if everything goes right that will be january) i am staying with jill and larry. i love living with them but i HATE mandeville. its a po-dunk tree town. and b4 the hurricane mand was ok cuz there was never traffic and that was cool. well, now it takes me TWO HOURS to get to metarie in the morning. but at least im working again. i start at southeastern in like 4 days. im not looking forward to it though. i wanna go back to uno, even though it wasnt that great at least i knew my way around campus. i feel like a freshman at slu. even though technically i am. anyways i think we are going to the pub tueday night because they pushed back the curfew in new orleans to 2 in the morning. i cant wait. i hate going to bars in baton rouge and hammond cuz i cant drink there. at the pub and toxic they do not give a shit who drinks. the bartender didnt even have to ask me what i wanted at the pub, he knew as soon as i walked up what i wanted. i miss my bar, my tuesday nights. i heard there is a drag show but its only like 3 drag kings and no queens. that kinda sucks cuz i like the queens better than the kings but oh well. 

i just spent fifty dollars on sweaters and coats for kali and rylie. the things u do with fema money. i havent had $4000 dollars in my bank ever in my life. . . and not only that im collecting unemployment and i got $330 from red cross. but its money much needed. i have to pay rent now and i wasnt paying that before the hurricane. and my mom isnt here to say ""hey baby, u need $20? ok here ya go"" so i dont get those little handouts the parents give when u need gas or food or money to go out with. 

well this is a very long entry so thanks if ya read it all.

"event","last night i went to my first rave with allie bradley laura ashleigh and the girl she is dating and her friends. we brought a whole bunch of ""white girl"" (haha) to do there but we decided we wanted to roll when we got there so bradley found some chic that knew some guy who had a whole bunch. they were blue supermans and they were so awesome. the rave was just so kool. everyone there was on drugs and everyone was so nice. i saw a whole bunch of random people that i havent seen in years. the light show was blowing me away it was so awesome. we were dancing in front of the stage like the whole night. anyways, after we left we were still all fucked up so we went to toxic but we didnt have any money so we went in through the re-entry only door and walked all the way in but got stopped and the chic told us we had to pay. lol. we were just like uhh ok we'll be right back. and we left. then we sat on allies porch smoking pot for like 2 hours. brad and me came back to my house and went to sleep around 6 i think. it was like the best night. i dont think ill ever roll again unless its at a rave. 

anyway, obivously me and allie are talking again which is good. i missed her alot. shit happens and things go wrong but if it really was a good friendship i knew that we would be friends again. and we are so there ya go. 

queer as folk comes on tonight and its gonna be a good one. 

FLORIDA is 5 days away! i cant wait i cant wait i cant wait. to sleep late for 7 days, to lay on the beach all day, to get a real tan, to get fucked up every night, and jet skiing in clean water that u can actually see through. the past week has been a really great week for me and im hoping i can keep up the momentum until vacation. this is the longest journal ever in life so im gonna shutup now."

"event","I got back from atlanta at 6 this morning. we had the drive from hell on the way home but its really good to be home. atl was awesome. it was like a gay jazz fest in piedmont park. all the booths gave u gay stickers and bracelets and t shirts and all kinds of stuff. and they have this cute little area called Little Five Point that is kinda like the quarter except much cleaner and with hills. they have hills all over the city its so weird. like u go down a street and ur going down a really steep hill. anyway this area little five point has awesome shops. the pipe shop had the best pipes i have ever seen. the pipes were sooo pretty. i bought one and it is so fucking cool. also, i got another tattoo. its hard to explain what it is but its really cool. its on my right foot. anyways, we left at 9 oclock and got home at 6! we ran into atlanta traffic right when we left then we were in montgomery when this fucking van went over the median on the interstate and hit an oil rig and it blew up. so we waited at a dead stop for an hour and a half then we finally turned around on the interstate and found some backway to get around it. needless to say all that crap set us back like 3 hours. and i ended up having to drive from like 4:00 till 6:00 this morning cuz jillian got tired.

i missed my dogs like crazy. thats why we left at 9 oclock at night instead of the next day. i bought them rainbow collars and they are just the cutest homo dogs ive ever seen. i dont know how im gonna stay in fort walton for a week without my dogs."

saturday, allie and brad told me that i am responsible for allie's mistakes, that i am the reason she is unhappy. it was the last straw. so i moved out.

ever since saturday things have been getting better. yesterday i went jet skiing with jill kate and larry and i got sooooo sunburnt. it was so much fun! except that one time jill threw us off and my chin hit the back of her life vest and i bit down on my bottom lip. it was bleeding haha. later she pulled me on the tube and i couldnt stay on for longer than like 30 seconds haha. oh and i saw kate's ass. anyways i am getting ready to go to uno with my mom. we are gonna see if i can get back in school for next semester.

anyway, in other news, me and Allie signed a lease for an apartment monday.

I totally got food poisoning from it! I was at Smoothie King when I started throwing up so I left. I couldn't even make it to my car in the parking lot. I had to stop three times to throw up. then when I got home I threw up 5 million more times. Jill called and told me she had this medicine that would help because I couldn't even keep water down. so Allie drove my car to the northshore (I was still throwing up on the way). I took the medicine and passed the fuck out. I woke up this morning still feeling sick so I didn't go to work and slept until about thirty minutes ago. 

Anyway, the point of this is to warn you all. Wendy's food is contaminated!"

"event","Today, Allie and I went to Jill's for our Sunday ritual of watching the L-word. I brought my dogs of course. We were in the kitchen making coffee when we heard one of the dogs screaming in the backyard. so me and jill ran back there to see, and it was Kali who was screaming because one of the neighbor's dogs (a rottweiler) had bit her foot through the fence. the dog bit off two of her toes on her front paw. i just saw all the blood and freaked. we picked her up and got in the car and went to the 24hour vet on the northshore. they tell me that she has to have surgery tomorrow so she is still at the vet now. one of her toes was comletely severed but the bone of the other toe is still there and they need to remove it. so my dog has a gimp paw. 
=( but im glad thats all that happened i guess. too bad it had to happen at all because it already cost me $384. and thats not even including the surgery and the anesthetic and all that jazz. im not worried about the money, i would pay $1000 if i had to but it sets me back. i cant move out for at least another month. 

so if anybody has a gun and doesnt have a problem shooting a mean rottweiler, i have no objections to them killing that bastard animal who mutilated my little princess."

"event","i had so much fun yesterday! woke up at 9:00 got ready, picked up allie, picked up beer and went to lakeside mall where jill was waiting with a spot to park my car that was like, right on the parade route. then brad comes (with another case of beer) and ashleigh and dani and laura too. everyone got WASTED! it was awesome haha. jill was lusting after laura's ass, allie and i kept telling each other how much we loved each other, brad was dancing on top the truck, ashleigh was falling off the ice chest, and i think we all pissed in the porta potty like 5 million times. we were gonna leave early so we wouldnt catch traffic but we got drunk and forgot haha. so when we left we sat in lakeside mall's parking lot for like 30 minutes trying to leave. while we r sitting in traffic, dani got out and pissed, brad got out and pissed, then i got out and pissed. ha. then we dropped brad and allie off and went to toxic, where i continued drinking. carrie was really nice to me, she told me that jill ""speaks very highly of me."" and jill's friends christina and her girlfriend were also really fun. ashleigh and dani came but dani slept in the car because she was too drunk to stay in the bar lol. i started throwing up around 8:30. brad came and by 10 i was ready to pass the fuck out. i dont even remember driving home. yesterday was the best mardi gras ever! no drama at all. but today im feeling sooo sick. i cant sleep because i feel like im gonna puke but im tired. and i have work at 4, which sucks alot."

"event","we went to endymion on sat and it was bunches of fun. we fit 9 people in the car on the way back lol. later we went to toxic where i saw lindsey who is soooo hott! also, we saw heather and she started dancing with me and she leans in and says ""i know u like butch girls but u can dance with me right?"" i wanted to be like shit ill do more than dance with you. she looked so hott cuz she was wearing this really sexy schoolgirl type outfit lol. 

we found a 3 bedroom for rent off of harrison. its only $1000 a month so we r trying to get it. 5 people living in a 3 bedroom with 1 bathroom and 4 dogs! complete chaos. its so nice though. its got a brand new washer, dryer, refridgerator, oven/stove, wood floors, 2 living rooms, an office, a garage, a car port, and a yard for the babies. its good that we r moving out really soon because my parents found pot in the dryer the other day and freaked out on me. my dad tells me that he ""will not have a pothead living in his house"" so whatever. 

i registered with volunteers of america to see if i could find my birth mother. i got a letter from them yesterday saying that she is not registered. so i guess she doesnt want to be found. im not gonna go looking for her if she doesnt want to be found ya know? 

and i think this could be really funny so do it:

some people dont know what matters in life. no matter what, u will always have ur family. girlfriends will come and go, but ur sister is there for life. also, its COMPLETELY FUCKED UP to fuck ur sister's ex and rub it in her face everyday. 

also, some people dont know what the definition of friendship is. just to set things straight, a friend is someone who is there no matter what, someone who is LOYAL, someone who doesnt ditch you for other people, someone who comes to your house to see YOU not anyone else.

my other dog, gretchen, has congestive heart failure. she is at the vet right now because she is too sick to come home. congestive heart failure has no cure and it sucks that she is dying because she is my big sweetie pie and i love her.
i dropped out of UNO (for this semester). when i told my mom she freaked on me. she tells me that i will have to pay all of my own bills now and that i cant live in her house anymore. she cried and told me how much i am letting her down. i feel so shitty for doing this but i cant handle the pressure. because my sister was such a fuckup, i have to do everything they want me to do. AND I DONT WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE.
brad isnt here for me to lean on. he is just as disappointed as my parents, i can hear it in his voice. i just wanted him to tell me that its ok that im taking the semester off and he didnt. 
i cannot stand when somebody thinks they are important enough to give me their opinion when it was not asked for. . . and especially when they dont leave their name.

Christmas Holidays is over after today and let me just say that I had an awesome break! I smoked alot of pot and drank alot of beer but besides that, i met alot of awesome lesbians that i want to get to know in the future, i watched the whole first season of the lword, i found out that one of my friends that ive been knowing forever is bi-curious, i got a lap dance from a hott lesbo, a naked shotgirl bought me and ashleigh shots, i slapped dominique dolorian's ass, and i made alot of money at work! it feels like i did more so i prob did and i just dont remember everything because of the beer-drinking and pot-smoking. This saturday was like the icing on the cake, i had so much fun! i hope that i see lindsey again soon because i would really be interested in another lap dance, lol. 

ashleigh, im sorry i was so loud at ur house after we got back, i dont remember everything so i dont know how bad i was but IM SORRY!

BEER.

fun stuff. im going to chihuahua gaga, the dog clothes store downtown, today with jill and larry. they came to uno and ate lunch with me today. i had SOOOOOO much fun saturday night at club alternative and i want to go again next saturday. that was probably the most fun i have ever had at a bar. and i drank a shitload of beer ($60 spent on drinks)! but i didnt get too drunk, just drunk enough. lol. but i did get drunk enough to lose what was left of my pot (which was konnie). i was so pissed when i couldnt find it yesterday, i have no idea where it went. i hate when i lose pot. it sucks. anyway, i am very happy with my life at the moment, minus the fact that two of my best friends are having a very rough time right now. im hoping that all works out with you because i love you both very much. 

ashlie, smile, be happy, take everything for what it is and try to make the best out of ur situation. sorry we arent close anymore but u can always talk to me, i hope u know."

"event","i hooked up with ashley brown last night. it was awesome, amazing so much fun. she is so fucking hott. but i dont know that we have much in common. i am just going to go with the flow though because i am definitely into her, i couldnt stop touching her last night. i didnt think that someone like ashley brown would be interested in me. i am still very hesitant about the whole thing. but, god, she is beautiful.
     also last night brad and i got into a big argument because he wanted to leave and i didnt. i told him that i would ride home with olivier but he wanted me to leave when he left so that he could get his dog from my house. he called me selfish for not leaving but i think he was being selfish for asking me to leave when i was hooking up with ashley when i havent been with a girl like that in months. and anyway i was doing him a favor by having my parents watch his dog while he went out. 
     today he called and we fought some more. when we fight it is so bad. he doesnt think he was wrong and i dont think i was wrong. we are both very stubborn. i dont know what to do except blow it off. there is nothing i can do to change this situation. it sucks because he is home for thanksgiving and id rather be hanging out with him right now. i cant give in though. last time we fought, when he lied to me, he never even said he was sorry and i still let it go. i hate the way he talks to me when he is pissed off and he is never going to change that unless i let him know that im serious when i say i will not be friends with someone who takes every fight to the breaking point and uses every hurtful word in his vocabulary to express his anger. i dont like confrontation, id like to solve this problem as quickly as possible but i dont know what to do."

this weekend was drama. saturday brad got into this big fight with some stupid little bitch that the guy brad is dating never broke up with. brad punched him in the face. haha. so that happened at the pub and we left right afterward. 
then we go to rainbow (club alternative) and carrie almost beats the shit out of atish. then jill and carrie fight outside for awhile. somewhere in between all that i was dancing with kelly and atish and scott and brad at rainbow. 
this girl bridget that i met last week came and smoked with me and brad. lol. she is very cute but i think she might be too old for me. i was so wasted by the end of the night that i cant remember leaving rainbow. i drove home from ally and daph's house that drunk bc i didnt want to sleep on the floor lol. 
sunday we hung out at ally and daph's and friday night i hung out at olivier's with ashleigh, kat, jessica, erdozain, heather, jamie, dani, melissa, and i dunno who else. ashleighs mom bought a fire pit and that was cool but then we ran out of wood to burn. oh well.

this weekend: brads maw maw nat died on wed and the funeral was saturday. i only met his maw maw nat a few times but she was a really sweet woman. becca and i went to the funeral and i felt so bad for brad and his mom and the rest of his family. afterward, we went to his grandpa's house with the family. i told brads mom how sorry i was and gave her a really big hug (one of those hugs where neither of u pull away and u actually feel the emotion behind the hug). i almost cried like 500 times but i needed to keep it together cuz brad was pretty upset. 
anyway, after the funeral brad and me and becca and ashleigh went to judy's block party. becca was supposed to come out with us but then austin called (I HATE HIM). so we met up with jill and kelly and atish downtown and got drunk and danced alot. brad met like 500 boys that he prob will never talk to again. we went to club alt after but nothing great happened there. 
on halloween, me and brad got into a fight bc he lied to me and i havent really talked to him about it since. its really getting to me that he lied to me so easily over something so silly. then he was basically laughing at me when i told him it was stupid. his exact words ""yea it was dumb i mean, what do u want. . . im high"" as if thats an excuse. whatever. so i went to see the topcats play at the daq shop with jill larry krissy brant and 2 other girls that i forget their names. fun stuff cuz there was a costume contest. mario and luigi won.

"event","I will survive...without you 
Don't tell me that you want to leave 
If you want to leave, I won't beg you to stay 
And if you gotta go, darling, maybe its better that way 
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine, don't worry about this heart of mine 
Walk out that door, see if I care, go on and go, but 

[ Chorus ]

Don't Turn Around, cuz you're gonna see my heart breaking 
Don' t turn around, I don't want you seeing me cry - just walk away, 
its tearing me apart that you're leaving,
I'm letting you go, but I won't let you know.
I won't let you know. 
I won't miss your arms around me,
holding me tight... holding me tight. 
And if you ever think about me,
just know that I'll be alright...I'll be all right. 
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine,
don't worry about this heart of mine, 
I will survive I'll make it through,
I'll even learn to live without you. 

[ Chorus ]

I wish I could scream out loud that I love you,
I wish I could say to you don't go -- 
As he walks away he feels the pain getting strong, 
people in your life, they don't know what's going on 
Too proud to turn around, he's gone... 

[ Chorus ]"

"event","I think of a while ago
We might of have had it all
I was so stupid then
You needed time to grow
But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you
But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long
It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night
You have your other friends
They were there when you cried
Didn't mean to hurt you then
Best friends just won't leave your side
But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret those times I spent with you
And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long
It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night
When I needed you most
When I needed a friend
You let me down now
Like I let you down then
So sorry, it's over"

"event","I miss Ashlie! she's coming home tomorrow though. this weekend was so crazy. I didn't get home until 4:00 last night and we went to three different bars. It wasn't that fun at any of them though. oh yea and last night at the Pub, Kenny smiled at me so he can't be too upset about last Tuesday's incident w/ Asleigh and me. My tongue ring doesn't hurt anymore yay! the bar is so long now though. oh well."

"event","So today me and Ashlie woke up and made breakfast together! mmmm it was good and it felt like a family. . . my family never eats together bc we would kill each other. anyway, we went to the house where my work is moving to help fix it up. We scratched paint off the windows then windexed! what fun. not really the fun part was the break we took in the backyard while Judy was gone. haha.
later, me and Ashton made a slip n' slide at Lafraniere? Park. It was alot of fun but I got scratches all over my butt and legs. 
After that we went to Bennigan's w/ Hollie, Ally, and Daffodil. Fun stuff. 
just thought I'd share this:
""i wish that things didnt change, that they were the way they were 3 months ago. i mean it would mean i wouldnt be friends with some great people and i wouldnt be with jenn. i like jenn alot, but i love you."" 
That's what you replied to Jessica once and I'm not sure how to react to reading that. I know that I am not going to bring it up to you in person because I'd rather not fight in circles again but know that I'm sick of overlooking comments like this. Will I always be second best in your eyes?"

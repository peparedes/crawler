"event","Well today was pretty much like yesterday.  I woke up at 5:50 and slowly got myself out of bed and out to my car.  I then went and picked up Patrick and went to football.  We got out at about 7:30.  I dropped Patrick back off and went home and went to sleep.  About two hours into it i got some text from some people and had to talk to them and then finally went back to sleep.  I woke back up at 3:30 and did the same routine.  Went and picked up Patrick and went to football.  This practice really sucked cause it started raining and then we had to run sooo much at the end.  It just drained me of all of my energy.  I then came home and ate some dinner and now im sitting here in front of my computer udating this and trying to finish my AP Comp work. Well im gonna get this stuff finished tonight."

Got out at 7:30 and then went home and slept till about 3:30 because i had to go to football practice again at 4:00.  I got out at 6:30 and then took taylor home.  I then came home and hung out for a while.  I helped my dad pick my barbeque up off the ground becaue my dog knocked it over.  Then got a hole bunch of texts from allison, anna, and alyssa telling me i should come over to alyssa's and hang out.  I eventually went over at about 9 and had a fun time hanging out with allison, anna, alyssa, lauren, devon, damon and jesse.  I just got back from dropping devon off at his house, and im sooo tired right now. I have to be up in about less than four hours.  Man, football drains soo much out of you."

I slept in today cause i didnt have to wake up at the crack of dawn for football, instead i had to go during the middle of the evening.  i felt like it was 100+ degrees.  Like the title says football can be a bitch.  we had to run sooo much today i swear i was going to throw up and pass out.  I also popped a blood vessel in my eye so im not to excited about that.  And now im sitting at home with a cold compress on my eye eating some food and thats prolly all im going to do tonight cause like i said ocean springs is dieing."

"event","Yeah Georgia is pretty gay cause they beat LSU. Yeah so that has really ruined my weekend. Friday was awesome cause we beat mosspoint and that puts at 5-0. and we just need to win two more games to get into the playoffs. There is no doubt in my mind that we will go completely undefeated this season. Well saturday somewhat sucked and at the same time it was somewhat awesome. Did the normal rutine stuff on saturday. I went to my guitar lesson, and went to the movies and stuff like that. But at about 9:30 my Phi Kappa big brother came and picked me up for first degree. I was nervous but i said ""Fuck It"". and i just laid back and let it happened. We met at walmart were we all drinking beer and stuff. I drank about a half a bottle of R&R, and then we left to go to the place were we were actually having it. We wound up there and they made us get in our boxers and and lay down on our stomachs were they poured different stuff all over us. For example; horse shit, pepper, onions, motor oil, corn syrup, crisco, and w/e else they could find. They then pilled us up in the back of a truck and took us through a car wash. Then we went back and you could leave if you wanted to or you could stay and pay five bucks to drink from the keg. Me and reggie decided to stay and drink so it wound up being one oclock and we were opening a gate for someone to get out and the cops came. Me and Reggie ran and wound up in parktown and someone came and picked us up and we went to reggies house were we got cleaned up even more and went to sleep. We woke up at 8 cause he had to go to church so he drove me to my house and i passed out till about 4:30. I woke up and my dad told me i needed to leave to go run at the stadium and i told him no cause hangovers and running dont mix.  We later went out to eat and then went to walmart and came home and i got dressed up and went to the Phi Kappa meeting and that lasted like 15 minutes and now im home eating ice cream and watching tv. Well i have to do a project on someone for acc. world history. Bye."

I know i dont get to play that often during the varsity games but i will next year. Its just a awesome experience being on a team that has sooo much potential. Anways, im kinda woried about this weekend. For those of who you dont already know Phi Kapp 1st degree is saturday. The location is a secret so dont ask me where it is. I dont even know where it is. I worried about whats going to happen. Im also worried about tomorrows game. We havent beat mosspoint in 11 years so im worried about it becoming 12. They have a really good team but we can beat them. Im also still kinda stuned cause i got into a wreck on the way to fourth block(weight training). Me and James Mcdaniel got into a small wreck, but it was scary for me cause it was on my side, so yeah im still freaked out but im very thankful neither me or james were hurt in any way. well i have to go practice now cause my dad says im not practicing enough even though i spend a hour and a half a day already playing the guitar but i guess i do need more practice.

"event","Its been a long damn time since ive updated this thing. mostly becuase my computer crashed and was being extremely gay so it took like a month to fix it. another reason was football. and the last reason would be a mix of school and guitar. Well i have my computer back now so i can continue with a normal lifestyle. Well all this hurricane shit totally blowed except the fact that we got out of school, but there going to take it off of some of our school breaks(which is extremley gay). I had to go all the way up to West Monroe, LA cause my dad freaks out to much. He acts as if hurricanes are the apocalypse. We came back thursday night to find out that nothing happened to our house, and i had to stay up till like 3 putting shit back where it belonged while my dad slept. Friday i woke up and my dad was at work. i called andrew to come over and he came. My dad came back from work at like 12 cause he found out he didnt have to go and i thought that was extremely gay. andrew and i just sat around watching tv for about two hours then my dad woke up from his nap and decided to make us do yardwork. So we did that but we got payed so its all good. The rest of the night was kinda just me and andrew staying up till like 5 and then falling asleep. Then on saturday we woke up and went out to gulfport where we went to Office Depot, Circuit City, and Petsmart then we went to the mall.  Then we dropped andrew off at his house after we ate and then me and my dad went to wally world and  then we came  home and i fell asleep cause i was soooo tired. and today i did yard work again and now im about to go eat a lot of food. so ill ttyl bye."

Came back around 1 and chris gave me a ride home, and then i passed out on the couch. That saturday i really didnt do anything. Sunday didnt really do anything either. Monday went to a nutrionist and leaned how to put on weight for football. Came to school. Missed a whole bunch a notes in Mr. Jarvis's class.
Took a really hard test in Anatomy. Ate lunch. went to world history got bored out of my mind. went to fourth block and lifted wieghts where i hurt my back, then i had footbal practice and got messed up there. Came home ate and went to bed. Woke up today to find that my ride forgot me and my dad had to come from biloxi to take me to school. Was late again for school. Took a quiz that i made a bad grade on in acc. geometry. Went to anatomy and found out i made a 81 on my test. And then went to lunch and i didnt feel good at all, and eating a lunch didnt help at all. i didnt talk to ashlee either. Went to mrs hubals class and slept about 3/4 of it and got in trouble. went to fourth block and had football practice where i got my leg really messed up. after practice i ate some ice cream from the booster club. came home and ate and now im sitting here typing my essay for acc. world history.

"event","Well the reason i havent updated in a long time can be summed up in one word ""Football"". School started and its been sucking. Football practice has been going on and im getting sick of takeling. I have bruises and cuts galore. Ive been placed on scout team for football, and for those of you who dont know what that is....its the team that the varsity 1st and 2nd string offense and defense get to practice their plays against, so every play im getting hit constantly by guys that are three times my size. It sucks but its the scouts teams chance to shine and show that they can take what is handed to them. So im really really starting to like one girl that happens to be my friend, and its bothering me cause i dont know what to do, and its just really confusing. Well im gonna go eat some spaghetti.

"event","well its been a couple days since i updated this thing.  So i guess i will pick up from were I left off.  On Thurday I got Andrew to come over and stay the night so we could go some places on friday and we did.  We went and saw dodgeball(awesome movie I highly recommend it, and if you go stay and watch the credits for something special) and then we went to the almighty Sams. That place as everything.  We bought about a ton of fruit and gatorade.  We then went back home and we dropped andrew off at his house and i came home and Conor called me saying I needed to go to the bowling alley cause it was drews b-day.  I wound up going and we bowled for about two or three hours. We then decided to callup Jordan Adcock to see if we could crash at his house and we did.  We stayed up till about 6 in the morning playing video games.  We also went out and stole terran burdine's for sale sign to her house(cause she asked jordan to) and we took it and put it in front of fort maripaus(however you spell it) and we did some other stuff. Saturday i woke up at like 11 at jordans and he took me home and i took a shower and everything and went and took my lesson and went to the movies and saw The Terminal.  Sunday I woke up and my uncle and aunt came over for fathers day and to celebrate my birthday cause it was the only time they could come over and we went out to eat with my mom and stepdad and we came back to my house and ate cake and ice cream and then i passed out on the couch from eating to much.  Today I woke up and went to my football workout and then chilled at coffee fusion till my dad got back from the dentist and i went home and took a shower and everything and then we went and did some tasks and then came back home cause my grandma was bringing over my new bed in her big truck, and then we left to go get sheets for it and i got some red satin sheets.  and they are awesome. and now im home talking on the computer and changing my guitar strings, and i have a lot on my mind right now. I mean a lot. I am liking two girls at one time and its really confusing cause i both like them a lot and i have known one for a really long time now and we are really good friends, but i dont know i need to think more about it. Well g2g. Ttyl. Bye."

"event","Well its been a long long while since i last updated this things.  It's because ive been really busy or ive been really lazy, but who cares. Well a lot has happened so far this week. Monday i went to a football workout and burned my muscles for two hours and i figured out my ride wasnt there that day so I had to call up my mom and ask her to come get me and i wound up spending the rest of the day with her.  We went to the mall to get my stepdad's fathers day present and i bought two shirts while I was there.  We came home and of course they put me to work and I had to build a freaking fence.  But i did my best and it looks good so im happy.  Tuesday, I went to the football workout and got a ride home from scott and then took a shower and decided to call up andrew to see if he wanted to come over and he wound up staying the night. Wednesday, me and Andrew woke up and ate some food and then from there we ate a meal every hour. lol. anyways, he went home later that day I  had came home and went to bed cause I was really tired.  Today, well today I went to the football workout and hurt my back pretty bad cause i droped a 150 pounds on my back when i was lifting and it rolled directly down my spine and i fell to the ground and it hurt pretty bad but i got back up and finished my reps and moved on.  Well i got a ride home from scott(as usuall) and then i came home and ate a protien bar and got on the computer. And Ive been chattin on here since. Well i will ttyl. bye."

"event","well yesterday was boring as shit.  I slept till about three or four.  Ate some cereal and talked on AIM for a bit.  Then took a long shower.  And watched tv like two hours later.  I watched ""Last Comic Standing"" and they made another draft, and it really pissed me off because Pablo Fransisco did not make it. He is like one of my favorite comedians and it was just really dissapointing.  I had to go to bed early cause I had a workout today which was not fun at all, but they never are. We just did our core lifts(bench, squat, power cling) and then we went outside and did some stretching drills. We then ran up and down the stadium, and it was horrible cause it was like a thousand degrees outside and i was drenched in sweat.  We then did some talking drills and the long two hour workout came to an end, and i was thankful.  I got a ride home from Scott Stargot and we got pulled over on highway 90 cause he was speeding and that sucked a lot.  I came home and took a long hot and cold shower.  Got dressed and then talked on AIM and called up Lizz to see if we were still going to coffee fusion today, and she said yes but she is going job hunting first.  She said she would call me when she was done and its been about 2 hours now and im felling left out but oh well. She will call.  Well im just sitting here downloading some Joe Satriani guitar tabs, and im bored to death.  Well im going to go for now.  Ttyl. Bye."

"event","well like i said i am sore, i am sore all over.  I woke up today at 4:30 for yet another football workout and i went to the stadium and waited for coach to get there. Luckily Yum-Yum and Jonathon were already there so i got to talk to them while we waited.  And then we began working out when everyone else came to the field house.  We started out lifting weights for about an hour, and then we went outside.  We had to run up and down the stadium carrying weights five times each way and then we did some drills.  After that i thought i was seriouslly dying, and then we had to do form running and that almost did kill me.  I stuck through it all though.  I then got a ride home from scott and i took a really really long hot shower.  I then took the time to eat a burrito. YUM. And im now sitting here talkng on the computer, and im waiting for jessica to tell me if she can come over or not.  Well im going to go clean up just incase she comes. TTYL. Bye."

I went to coffee fusion and then went to the bx on the af base.  I went back home and my dad decided he wanted to go see harry potter so he draged me along and i swear i will never see a moive for kids in the theater ever again because kids dont seem to understand the concept of being queit in the movie theater.  but oh well i cant do anything.  I then went to la fiesta brava and then to this bakery.  I also went to state farm insurance agency to find out how much car insurance for me would be for my car.  and my dad pulled out this idea for how much it would be for a brand new Ford F150 and she caculated everything and he asked her to print it out and he said we are going to the ford dealership tomorrow so HELL YEAH! and then we went to movie galery where we rented Monster, and i havent watched it yet but i will.  and then we went to walmart and i got seperated from my dad and spent half an hour looking for him. and then we came home and ive been here since.  well im going to go cause im talking to lizz about romance and its taking up my typing time so talk to you later.  bye."

On suday I went to my grandmas house with my mom and dad to celebrate their aniverissary, and like always my grandma feed us more than we could eat.  We then took a swim in hear pool and that felt soooooo good, and then about two hours later we ate dinner. I decided to stay at her house even though i didnt have any other clothes or toothbrushes or anything but it was alright my grandma had some toothbrushes and i went and bought some extra boxers so it worked out.  The next day i just stayed at her house and ate some ribs and swam and watched a marathon of American Hot Rod and American Choppers, and then i watched VH1's 100 Most Metal Moments. I fell asleep about five minutes through it and then i came back home the next morning. Well that was my weekend and i hope yours was as fun as mine.  Ttyl. Bye."

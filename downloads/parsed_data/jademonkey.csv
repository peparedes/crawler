I have tons of space, gas stove. washer/dryer in unit and my commute is 15 minutes, far superior to the average of 45 minutes i had before.  I am getting at least 1 hour of my life back every day and it feels good.  I've actually started cooking again.  Starting small but my kitchen feels like mine again.

Neighbors of my parents are getting rid of their dining room table which I am going to be taking.

Still need to pick up bookcases, and a couch.  Maybe one of those ikea chairs.  Bedside table and some office style drawers would be nice as well."

My commute will drop from about 45 minutes to 10-15 minutes.  Add that in with the time I'll save driving to dances and the like and that is over an hour of my life back every day.

I have decided that I want to try the whole living alone thing.  So while i'm paying more than i need to for housing.  It'll feel a little more like mine.  I want a kitchen that feels like my kitchen again, one that i'm comfortable working in.  While i have access to a kitchen at my current location it doesn't feel like mine so i'm wary to do any sort of cooking experimentation or cooking in general, not to mention the lack of time.

I've decided that I hate living in Burke (suprise, suprise).  So I'm looking to move into the Tyson's Corner area as it is the best balance of price, closeness to the city, and closeness to work.  I'm currently researching digs, and am probably going to be looking for a roommate.  I think I can get a 2 bedroom apartment of decent size for about 1500/month.

I test drove both with a couple different engines.  I htink if I was to go with the standard 2L 4 cylinder I'd go with the golf (which has a suprising roomy interior but lacks a bit in the trunk space without folding back seats).  othewise I'd strongly consider a jetta with a 1.8 turbo charged engine (premium fuel, ack!).  That thing is peppy, I was suprised how well that think kicks in, defineatly a better suspension and good for highway.  It makes the 2L engine in a jetta feels almost like I'm driving the saturn, well a little faster than the saturn but still.  Plus I can get the car cheaper than an accord and it would have warranty on it still, certified pre-owned and all that jazz.  Seeing my recent luck with cars, this might be a good thing.  Discuss."

Some people really seemed to like it, but I am of the opinion they make a better show band than a dance band.  Unfortuneate since I wanted to dance to them.  Out well,  I went to K2 after the dance and danced the blues until 4am.  Next weekend should be awesome.  Amazing bands friday and saturday night at glen echo and a late night swing dance at K2 on saturday.  Hurray for me!

Finally started Harry Potter yesterday.  Good thus far, I'm about 200 pages in.  People need to bug my ass cause I was lethargic and bored yesterday.  Can't complain too much though cause I didn't exactly try to contact anyone.

I got a box set of Artie Shaw for $18 that came with 10 cds each with 25 songs a piece on them.  I knew I was getting a lot of music, but my god.  I'm quite enjoying it.  I'm now trying to sort through it and find stuff I'd like to dance too.  Gives me stuff to play when I get back to tech and try my hand at DJing some more.

Also I hate TV tuner cards in Linux.  Actually I hate tv tuner cards in general.  That is what my job is these days to play with data capabilities on tuner cards.  It's quite irritating the lack of support for linux.  Why is this so complicated?  I've spent a little over a week of my life just trying to get the damn drivers to spit out some sort of data and thus far I've been quite unsuccessful.  There are no good walkthroughs, I have yet to find anything useful on forums.  I am a bit annoyed at that but otherwise happy.

Friday I saw Charlie and the Chocolate factory with my parents.  If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it, it is most enjoyable.

Saturday I looked at mazdas and a couple of hondas.  I think at this point i'm leaning towards subarus.  I'm eyeing the Subaru Legacy/Outback, as I am finding myself to be fond of station wagons.  I think I'm going to go out tonight to look at subarus and get a better feel for them.

I finished up the evening with dancing at glen echo.  And I must say, despite the crazy humidity saturday night It was one of the best nights of dancing I've had.  And it was crazy humid.  The theme of the dances was the Deep Sea Ball, hawaiian/beach attire themed.  And it was basically like dancing underwater.  Or at least like everyone had taken a quick dunk in the pool and got out and started dancing.  All I can say is i'm glad i brought a few changes of clothes.  Also, I'm finding more and more that I need a pair of dark colored shorts, preferably of the microfiber variety, something capable of dealing with sweat but also capable of breathing.  It would be nice if they were somewhat dressy looking, but whatever.

After the dance at Glen Echo I went to a late night dance at K2 (the place I dance on wednesdays) for more.  Stayed out until about 3:30am at which point my lack of sleeping caught up to me.  A very fine evening with lots of excellent dancing.  I love dancing in my sneakers with chrome leather glued to the bottom, they slide beutifully and are far more comfortable than dancing in dress shoe style dance shoes.

Sunday was lazy.  I had originally planned to go to a company picnic out in leesburg, but ended up not since my family decided to make off with all the cars leaving me stranded.  So I hung out with Dennis and Hayden.  It was Dennis's birthday and I joined in on the birthday festivities which included a fine dinner at <A HREF=""http://www.greatamericanrestaurants.com/artiesmain/arties-mainpage.htm"">Arties</A>.  Great food with great people.

All in all a fine weekend.  My family bought 2 copies of the new harry potter book but i haven't had a chance to read it yet.  So to all you people out there who've had the time... I shake my fist at you!"

Possibly a Civic (as they were redesigned in 2001 to be bigger and suck less) or a Corolla (redesigned to suck less in 2003).  Main thing here is mileage, as gas prices aren't going down anytime soon and i'd just as soon not have to spend $40-50 to fill up my tank.  With secondary concern being highway driving comfort, as i want it to make the trek between blacksburg, DC and whereever else the wind carries me.  I'd also just as soon not have to deal with fixing it so reliability is a factor as well.  I don't want a repeat of the saturn blowing a piston through the side of the engine with little warning.  I'm always open to suggestions about what I should get, I know some of peoples thoughts, although the imformation is getting a bit dated at this point.  I'm still doing research at this point but the process is started, I'm went out yesterday and test drove some cars.

In other news, I seem to be at an impasse on one project and finished all my other ones, so I have a bit of free time.  I've been using the time to research cars and write this entry.  I'm going dancing tonight and tomorrow, which I'm looking forward to.  I need to get out and get some excercise, plus the social aspects of it don't hurt either.

I've got some more music coming in over the next week or two.  I think it's a Duke Ellington box set and a Lois Armstrong box set.  I also ordered a Lucky Millinder CD but that's on backorder. I also ordered <A HREF=""http://www.achewood.com/shop/appm_dspec_premt_qsass.php"">this shirt</A>.  Which I found amusing and will plan to start wearing to dances.

"event","So I did workshops today with a world champion swing dance troupe from sweden, which was amazing to begin with.  Follow that with them doing performances. Follow that up with them going out to glen echo for social dancing.  My god.  Tonight was one of the best nights of dancing i've ever had, period.  There were a few mediocore dances but for the most part they were just amazing.  I made a point of dancing with as many of the swedes as possible (turned out to be 2 of like 8 but oh well it's a start.  More workshops tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to them.

I can't make the damn network connection stay up on it for more that a few hours before it decides that it doesn't want to exist any more.  Maybe it's a hardware problem i'm not sure, the only way i've found so far to reverse the effects is to reboot the damn thing.

FreeBSD why do you hurt me so?  I just want to learn to use you.  You can't be that bad since OS X is comes from the same base."

"event","So I got my first introduction to doing the Hustle (not the line dance thing, but a social dance version of it.  I think of the places i've been going in this area, K2 up in beltsville MD is probably my favorite.  I have a great time every time I've been there,  I think if nothing else I like the people.  A lot of people that I just enjoy dancing with go there regularly.  Jam cellar is also nice but a lot of the crowd there is still intimidatingly good and I just don't connect as well with the music.

This weekend my parents are off to pennsylvania for the yearly squaredancing/chilling with the amish weekend.  I haven't been in a few years now and it just doesn't interest me like it used to staying on a farm and waking up to the smell of cow manure.

I on the other hand will be staying here and attending swing dancing workshops given by some crazy swedes.  At least I assume they're crazy, after all they are swedish.  2 of them will be teaching up at the beantown camp I'm going to in about a week, which I didn't realize when i signed up but it will be a good introduction to their style and so on and so forth.

In addition to my dancing addictions I have been feeding my Dr. Mario addictions as well.  Ah the joys of 4 player game of Dr. Mario 64.

I really need to start looking at cars.  I want a car that's got decent mileage and doesn't suck for highway driving (gotta make the trek to and from tech with decent frequency).  I've been eyeing Toyota Avalon of the v6 camry.  I don't need a V8, I'm eyeing more things with a v6.  But I could probably get by on an adaquetly powered four cylinder.  So more power than a saturn, but i don't need a crown victoria either.  It doesn't have to be the most exciting car on 4 wheels but I don't want to roll my eyes when I press down on the gas pedal and I start accelerating at a snails pace."

"event","Pretty uneventful birthday.  Worked for 8 hours and had a nice dinner with my family at Layalina.  Gotta love Lebonese food.

This weekend is going to be really good from a swing dancer perspective.  Big name band are coming through DC this weekend as well as some neat sounding workshops.  I can go into more detail but I'll spare the non-swing dancers who read this (actually I don't think there are any who do).

Also Da Vinci's Notebook is doing a free show on sunday in Crystal City and they are being followed by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.  So if people stick around a little afterwards they'll probably see me dancing.

I'm currently driving my dad's infinity.  My biggest beef with the car right now is that the AC doesn't work very well and it has leather seats.  Just about every day this week when I've gotten home my back is soaked through.  The other gripe I have about the car is that it takes premium gas.  I know dennis can slam down any gas complaints I have but that's his own damn fault for driving a car the size of rhode island."

"event","Cleveland was amazing.  The lessons were great, I'm looking forward to teaching people back at Tech what I learned.  The dancing was also amazing.  Imagine a medium sized auditorium packed almost shoulder to shoulder with people dancing to fast music.  Balboa is an amazing dance that I have gained a lot of appreciation for this past weekend.  I am defineatly going to this event again next year.  The teachers are amazing both in their dancing abilities as well as their teaching ability and there are tons of good dancers in general around.

I met a lot of new people and got to see a bunch of people I've met a other events.  People were there from all over the place.  People from montreal, france, sweden, new york, california, florida, and a fair number of familiar faces from DC as well.

The van was giving me some crap on the way back.  Losing oil pressure.  I suspect it might be overheating and that the air conditioner is related to the problem.  Stupid van, last time I drive it long distance.  I really need to find a car for myself.  I'm looking for a sedan that good for highway driving, with decent gas mileage that has some pep to it (meaning not as boring as the saturn)"

School had been disrupting that.  The work is also good,  I think systems programming is a good match for me.  I enjoy looking at the lower level compiler and OS stuff.

I'm off to Cleveland this afternoon for the All Balboa weekend.  Yep it's time for me to add Balboa to my dance repetoire.  I'll be back on sunday.

I'm pleased with the way the summer is going thus far, I'm busy and have yet to have just a day of truely not doing anything.  It's going to be a good summer.  A summer of progress and growth, not just time off of school.  If I could ask for one thing though, I wish i had my memory foam bed up here, cause the bed I'm sleeping in now is hard as a rock and I don't think I've gotten a good night's sleep since I've been back."

Saw Kung Fu Hustle yesterday. Good stuff, hilarious.  Not sure if I'd say it's better than shoalin soccer, but it's right up there with it.

I'm ready for a weekend, I need to catch up on sleep (although I'm doubting playing magic tonight will help that any).

Quick rundown of my travel schedule for summer as I know it:
June 2nd-Jun5th, Cleveland for All Balboa Weekend
Either weekend of the June 10th or 17th I want to drive down to tech.
June 24th-July 3rd, Boston for Beantown Camp
July 22nd-24th, Ann Arbor Lindy Exchange (tenative, based on if my parents are driving up to pick up adrienne from her summer camp)"

"event","gcc seems to uses gcc to compile itself.  Now on the surface this doesn't seem that strange but it's not a version of gcc just sitting on your computer, it's using the version of gcc you are compiling to compile itself.  I've been toying with it the past week or so and it's becoming quite apparent this is the case.  Strange, no?

I was exhausted yesterday night.  I got home ate something and took an 1.5 hour long nap (about 3 times longer than my average naps).  After that I watched  Ray.  Really good movie, if you haven't seen it.  Very well done.

I've taken to listening to NPR on my morning commute.  Full of public radio goodness.  Morning edition on the way in, Marketplace on the way out.  Makes my commute a little better."

"event","This past weekend was amazing.  I've having increasingly more fun at these exchanges.  I'm getting to know more people at them and just have better dances in general.  It seemed like everyone i talked to who i mentioned the all balboa weekend to are going to it.  So I should see a lot of friendly familiar faces and i'm looking forward to the weekend more and more.

On my way down to raleigh it was raining and there were 4 accidents on 95.  It took me and hour and a half longer to get down than I expected.  Also right when it got dark my headlights decided they didn't like being on any more.  Parking lights still worked so people could at least see me, i just couldn't see anything really.  So despite having a minivan i had to bum rides to the dances from the other virginia tech people who were there.  I  had to leave a little early on sunday to get back before dark.  My dad took the van today because he didn't manage to fix the headlights last night.  Hope the work again soon.

After the drive too and from raleigh I have declared 95 my newest mortal enemy. Death to I-95!  I challenge you to name a worse interstate in virginia (495 maybe).

I still need to see the new star wars.  Ok back to work with me."

"event","First week of work has been going pretty well.  The work is pretty interesting and the pay is good, also I get dual 17 inch flat panels.  Commute kind of sucks though.  On a good day I can get to work in 30 minutes.  I have yet to get my return under 45 minutes though. At least I've got my return trip route without taking the dulles toll road.  On the way back, dulles to 66 really blows.  And Like hell if I'm touching the beltway with a 20 foot poll that time of day.  50 sucks too, but it moves decently.

I've been playing around with the Enlightenment window manager on linux.  I look forward to e17, looks like it will be good if it ever gets released, I like the general feel of it, I hate the currently complete and utter lack of ease of configurability.  e16 works pretty good though and offers a lot of things that I like now that i've gotten used to it.  So gnome and kde can suck it!

Went out dancing twice this week, on tuesday and wednesday.  Jam cellar (in Vienna) is a lot of fun, good dancers and a good floor, I'm still undecided on the music.  Wednesday I went up to beltsville and again good dancers, good floor, and good music. I'll probably be frequenting them both.

It amazes me how uncrowded 295 is around 9pm on a weekday.  I don't think I even had to stop going from pennsylvania ave to 295 north.  When I drove up to baltimore last weekend that was the biggest bottleneck.

I'm taking off a bit early today in order to drive to north carolina for a Lindy Exchange.  5 hour drive according to google maps, viva the ipod!
Should be a lot of fun, just like the last 2 exchanges I went to.  I'm also pondering the Ann Arbor Lindy Exchange.  I'd be garunteed a place to stay at least, hurray for family."

It's always an adventure with superhouse and today is no exception.  Our drains are clogged so we can't really use water.  My roommate alex ran the washing machine to see if it was before or after the clog and the toilet overflowed and the bathtub filled about half way.  So yeah we're calling a plumber, this is beyond the scope of us having any clue how to fix it.

I'll be driving home tomorrow probably.  I've got Swing workshops in baltimore on saturday and i wouldn't mind being settled in a bit before those.  Maybe I should start packing some stuff to take home."

"event","If people keep telling me I'm a really good lead I might start to believe it.  I've gotten the comment from numerous people, people I really respect as dancers.  That and comments like ""Wow, that was the best dance I've had all night""  This dancing thing might start getting to my head.  Not to say there's not room for improvement.  But I'm very happy with where I am now and look forward to learning more.

I've also been doing some of the DJing for the dances recently as well, just like making sure there's music playing.  I've heard multiple people comment that the music was really good. I need to increase my collection size, I'm still missing a lot of music that I'd really like to have

Also I'd like to branch out some.  I've now got some salsa/chacha and waltz basics down.  Swing still seems to have the best connection to me, the most room for play in the dance.

Also the Boilermaker Jazz Band is stalking me.  Since I've started dancing in november I have seen them 3 times.  First time was at the new years dance at glen echo, second was at the DC lindy exchange, third was at JMU.  In the next month I'll be seeing them twice more.  They will be playing at the place I'm planning on doing most of my dancing this summer(<A HREF=""http://www.thejamcellar.com"">The Jam Cellar</A>) on the 24th of May, and again up in cleveland at the All Balboa weekend.  It's a good thing I like them."

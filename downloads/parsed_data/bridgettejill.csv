There was a ladybug in Riley's room this morning which provided lots of entertainment. IEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Of course, a ladybug is no match for a curious toddler.Today I learnt that the insides of a ladybug are green - just like an oyster.
 
Yuck."

"event","Gee, that should be one for the baby book.

Earlier this evening Glenn gave Riley his usual bath and was cleaning up when there was a loud bang.

*heart stopped*

The little man was walking around with my hairbrush in his mouth when he tripped and fell and did a face plant. I was up the stairs in an instance and when I saw the mouth full of blood my first thought was that he cut his gums or the inside of his mouth but when I got a look into his mouth I saw white teeth amid all the blood where they shouldn't be. 
I couldn't bring myself to poke around in there because I was afraid I would knock them out if they hadn't been already. All the way to the hospital I was scared he would chock on a loose tooth but I kept singing ""I'm farmer Jed and I have a farm..."" in my bad singing voice that only my son loves. :)

The E.R. was packed, there wasn't even two chairs to sit together. I desperately wanted my son to be seen as soon as we walked in but of course we had to wait. Looking around the waiting room I took in all the other little kids and decided that triage should be youngest first, not sickest. Yeah, yeah, I know there was that guy having chest pain, but come on, that little boy with the sad eyes should have priority! Oh how my heart broke.

Luckily we were considered 'urgent' and only had to wait an hour and a half. To my relief the teeth weren't knocked out only pushed back and in at a bad angle. I was told they don't do anything for baby teeth anyways, if they fall out, they fall out. All I can do is give him pain medication.

Of all the bitching and moaning I've done in the past about teething this is much worse. I'll never complain about the teething pain again."

"event","Something's that Rye has done lately that have put a smile on my face:

Picked out his favorite book and brought it to me to read with him. He hasn't done this since.

Puts all the rings on his toy and expects applause after every ring goes on.

Loves to go through our wallets and pull out every plastic card until he hits the Visa.

Plays peek-a-boo with every person he sees in the store. Everywhere I go I have strangers giggling at me. 

And this morning after I picked up his toy car phone and talked into it and handed it off to him as I always do he placed the phone back into his car, picked it up again, and put it to his ear. 

I love this age. :)"

Last summer I met this woman and her two small kids at the small park near our house. Turns out she just moved into the neighborhood and her house backed onto the park. The house was perfect, large two story, about 15 years old, huge windows and huge kitchen, and had a walkway on one side. They re-sodded the yard, painted, and built a new front porch. I was jealous. I decided that that house would be perfect for us and Glenn agreed.

The other night he came home and told me that our house is for sale. Tonight we walked by the house again and ran into the woman who owns it, she chatted with us and told us she really hopes they sell to a family with small children. *pout*

We'll go see the bank in the morning but we already know we can't afford it.

Damn.

I want my house!

I want it.
I want it.

Ryeman went down for a good morning nap when we took down the Christmas tree and cleaned the house, once he awoke we grabbed some lunch to take to Nana's house and then we all hopped into the car for the 45 minute drive to Ikea. So far, so good.
Upon hitting the parking lot did we realize what we where in for. Just once I would like to go to that store and actually be able to look at things, and not get pushed from once section to another by the massive crowds. Grrrrrrrrrr. I would also like it if they actually had the items in stock too.
With all the people and sights Rye quickly became over-stimulated and hyper. I expected that, I also expected him to cry on the way home before falling asleep. He did, but he didn't fall asleep. He screamed, and screamed <b>all</b> the way home. I know he was over-stimulated and over-tired which is hard to avoid but I think he was also thrown off by seeing me in the backseat.

Oh so much fun.

Next time I feel the need to go to Ikea, (and there will be a next time) somebody shot me."

Blah. Of course the two of them get to take cold medication and I get to do without.
Okay, I'm feeling a little resentfully on that last point.

On a different note; I've never been much of a ""New Year's resolution"" type person. I believe that we should make commitment's to improve our lives everyday and the idea of making a big deal on one day of the year to change something about ourselves is simply setting us up for failure. 
Last year was the first year I made a resolution and I didn't manage to keep at any stretch of the imagination. 
This year I'm going back to not making a resolution and just try to be a better person throughout the year. Okay, I admit that that's a little sappy but so be it."

"event","What makes a good parent?
I don't know but everyone sure has their opinion about it and I'm sick to death of it. I'm tired of trying to measure up, of trying to please, of trying to be adequate. I'm getting pulled between what everyone tells me I need to do and what I feel my son, myself and my husband needs to do. If one more person tells me that I have to have time away from my son I'll seriously punch them in the nose. Even worse is when I try to explain all that we've gone through and that essentially we've had a sick child for the last eight months solid  and the reaction I get is ""you better get used to it, that's what being a mother is about"". Fuck you. Come back and talk to me when you've been in my shoes.

I don't want to complain about my situation, I feel horrible complaining about my own child. I do feel blessed, really I do none of his 'illnesses' have been life threatening or debilitating and our lives are richer with him in it. It's just that I don't know what to say anymore when people ask about Riley. ""Is he sleeping through the night yet? Does he cry much? Is he a good baby?"" What kind of question is that? Are there 'bad' babies out there?

One more straw will break this camel's back. My heart can only break so much from hearing my child cry for hours on end. My body needs more than 4 hours of interrupted sleep a night for me to function during the day. Everyone wants the best for their children and I have this incredible need for mine to be happy. I can only take so much misery. I need someone who understands, I need someone to relate.

So if you run into a dark haired, worn-out woman with dark circles under her eyes toting around a beautiful baby and you tell her 'mom needs a break', you better be prepared to duck."

Hmmmm.... lets see, Riley is 7 months old!

He is about to cut his two top teeth, I can see them through the gums, and they are driving him nuts. I bought him teething rings, gave him teething toys, gave him wash cloths and blankets but the only thing he wants to chomp on is my shirts. Every t-shirt I own is now stretched out of shape.

This past week he started pulling himself up. The first time he did it in the play-pin at the swimming pool. He tries to use his toys to push up on and we must drop the mattress in his crib, but he's never in there so it's not a priority. I'm a little sad that he's not content to sit anymore, the novelty of that has worn off and he wants to move. I keep telling him not to crawl, that I will bring him anything he wants if he just sits there. He is not listening to me. :(

What a stupid concept. Human beings should be born with teeth, what kind of developmental plan is it to grow these sharp enamel things out of our gums only to have them fall out 6 years later?"

"event","No more fast food for me. Ever.
Even though we've declared the colic over Riley still cannot digest fatty foods and I certainly learnt my lesson. I blame it on the heat, who wants to cook when it's 40 degrees in the house? Oh, and I ate some deep fried stuff when we went to ""The Taste of Edmonton"" Monday night. He's worked all that out of his system now and I'm back on the healthy food, plus my daily dose of chocolate. I do have to say it make for some nasty gas and an even nastier diaper.

My *sniff* big boy on has one tooth and another one making it's way through the gums. When you think about it it's such a weird concept to have teeth growing out of your gums. Where do they come from?

Yesterday he had his 6 month shots even though he's not quite 6 months. Good job making that appt. He did so much better this time, he slept for most of the day and no fever. Yay. Really though I've had him doped up on Tylenol all week he shouldn't have felt a thing. :)

Glenn is out of town. He left this morning and will be back Wednesday. I'm going to miss him so much, I'm not used to him being gone and I think it's killing him to be away from Riley. He worries about me, he knows how hard it is with a high needs baby and no one to help, so I'm having the sister-in-laws over for lunch Monday. Really, it will turn out to be more work then help but it makes Glenn feels better about leaving."

"event","It's been two weeks since my surgery and tomorrow will be the first morning that I don't have anyone here to help me. Guess I won't be able to sleep in, poor me.

I have babysat a lot of kids in my time, I was the queen babysitter when I was a young teen. Part of it was that I really enjoyed the kids and part of it was because I got to look in at what normal families were like. Babysitting is an intimate job, you become a working part of the family for a short period of time.
Because of the surgery and the recovery time that I had to take we hired a nanny to come into our home to take care of Riley for me. If it wasn't for the surgery I don't think I would have left Riley with a sitter for a long, long time. That's one of the pro's (or is it a con) of being a stay-at-home mom. The girl we hired (Jos) is really good with Riley and I've enjoyed having her here, unfortunately I can't afford to keep her forever, (besides that would defeat the purpose of staying at home). During the day I keep coming to the realization that I'm not the babysitter in this situation, I'm the mom! It's so different and it brings back memories of some of the mom's I babysat for and how well they treated me and how I felt close to them.

I can't describe how good it feels to be the mom. It feels so right, this is what I've wanted my whole life.... and it feels so... right. This is what I was made for.

I'm going to miss Jos not only because of the break she gave me but also having her in the house. It felt good to have someone else here during the day. Next week I'll have her for 3 days to get me slowly back into things but every once in a while I'll have her babysit just to give me some time and space for myself. It feels good to give myself that, and maybe there might just be a date night in my near future. Woohoo!

Babysitters are a good thing."

Last Saturday she told me that she's not comfortable in my house. That wasn't news, that's something I could always tell. When she comes over it feels like a guest, not family. What did bother me was when she said if Riley wasn't breastfeed she would take him home with her where she was more comfortable. Ha, one more great reason for boobie food. I know there will be a battle somewhere down the road where Glenn and I will have to let them know where the line is. About a month ago I had the carseat question, as to which carseat they should buy. I felt good telling them there was no reason for them to have carseat because I will drive him anywhere when they want to see them. Case closed, no guilt.

Everytime we have a run of bad days I question what is causing it. This time I thought teething, I thought growth spurt but I can't accept that it's the colic again. I keep thinking we are beating the colic that it's getting better and when we have some great days or a great week I truly believe it's over. Then he gets cranky, only cranky and then it turns bad fast. By that time I'm living minute to minute, second to second that it's impossible to step back and take a look at what is wrong. I clued in to it this morning when he started screaming in his sleep at 5:30 and then farting and screaming again. That awful, awful ""it hurts"" scream. Only then do I realize that there has been no gas for days, no burps, no farts. That means the gas can be in one place, in that poor little tummy that I love.

So I want to tell myself the next time Riley has a hard time (and it will happen again);

It is the gas, even if it isn't coming out, it's the gas.

He is in pain, he's not being difficult, he's not spoiled, he's not being manipulative, he's simply hurting.

Forget trying to stick to the routine, screw the routine. Stop trying to get him to nap on his own, he can't. Put him in the sling and carry him, rock him and let him sleep there. When he sleeps hold him, soon he won't allow you to hold him so enjoy it now.

Give him an extra dose of medicine. He can have it 3 times a day and that extra does will help.

Cancel all plans and don't worry about it. You can always reschedule things and cancelling will reduce the stress level.

He <i>will</i> fall back into his routine once he starts feeling better again. He always does.

He will feel better and it will get easier. The good days is what it is all about and there are more and more good days.

16

I have 16 days until I have to go in for surgery. Shit. I've put it off as long as I can and they won't let me procrastinate any longer. I wish I could put it off forever, or at least until Riley is grown, moved out of home, and doesn't need me anymore. That seems reasonable to me. I'm not worried about me and I'm not worried about the surgery, I'm worried about Riley. How are we going to balance this? 

A cyst was found on my right ovary during my pregnancy, cysts are quite common during pregnancy as sometimes pregnancy will cause them. The concern about the cyst was its size. At my lastest ultrasound a few weeks ago I was told it is the size of Riley's head. I don't know how that's fitting in there but it is, and it has to come out.
We've planned the best we can for the time I will be in the hospital. They will allow us to room together, Riley, Glenn, and myself because I'm breastfeeding. The doctor even has no problem with me breastfeeding immediately after surgery and we are going to try and get Riley to take a sippy cup incase I can't feed him. Glenn's going to stay with us the whole time in the hospital.
I can count on him to be there for Riley, he knows how to take care of him. Once I go home though he has to go back to work and my recovery might take awhile. I'm guessing it will be similar to a c-section, I won't be able to pick anything up for the first week or so. Riley now weighs 16+ lbs, that's a big anything. Shit.
Our only option is for my mom to come out and look after us. I'm not overly thrilled with this option but that's all we have. My mom means well, she really does but she doesn't have that 'touch' with babies. She is very awkward with babies, period, and Riley, well, he needs someone with a special touch. He's a great baby he just isn't an easy baby, he's a high needs baby. He needs consent interaction, he needs to be entertained, and he needs to be walked and rocked for most of the day. Walked and rocked in a certain way too. Not to mention that getting him to sleep and keeping him asleep is an art form. Shit.
I keep picturing me stuck upstairs in bed listening to Riley screeching away and my mom staring at him saying ""What"". This is driving me nuts. I hate that I'm going to be out of commission for a whole week. 

Shit.

Maybe tomorrow I should start checking out nannies."

"event","I've been attacked.
I'm under siege and I didn't even know it until it was to late. The monster had cooed and cuddled it's way in and had attached itself to me, permanently. My best counter attack consisted of nibbing on the monsters toes but it wasn't good enough. I was losing. Somehow this creature was so powerful it could turn my brains to mush and stuck them right out of me!
I surrendered.
I curled up with my parasite and I gave in to the warm afternoon sunlight and the soft bed. I let go and fell in tune to its deep breathing and I allowed it to guide me to sleep. There we lay in-tangled for hours on end with little monster fingers hanging on letting me know how much I was needed.

*sigh*
And it was bliss, and I loved it."

"event","Yesterday G received a frantic phone call at work. He rushed home to find his infant son in his swing crying so hard he was making the house shake. His whole head was red and his eyes were puffy from crying nonstop for the last 2 hours.
After doing an extensive search of the house he found his wife in a basement corner hiding under a blanket sobbing her eyes out.

The tanks were empty, my reserves had been drained. I had no energy left. Not even enough energy to pick up my screaming child. Thinking back on it now brings tears to my eyes.

I don't think I can even explain the emotions that go through you when you can't bring yourself to comfort your own baby.
I'm his mother, the only mother he has and I failed him.
I failed myself.
It tore me up inside to have to call my husband home from work to do my job because I couldn't do it.
I fully expected him to be angry with me, he had every right. But after comforting his son he tried to comfort me, all that mattered to me at that point was that someone was taking care of my son.
I was shuffled off to bed but even though I was exhausted I could only stare at the ceiling. Sleep wouldn't come. I kept thinking of Andra Yates and what she must have gone through, I thought of all the stories I had heard from mom's with post-partum depression. I <b><i>do not</i></b> want to be one of those moms. I want to enjoy my childs babyhood fully. I want to give him the best start in life he can possible get. This time will never happen again and I only get one chance at it. No re-dos, no mulligans.

I woke up to Riley crying in the bassinet at 12:30 at night. I brought him into bed with me and tried (halfheartedly) to soothe him. Nothing worked and I was getting aggravated by being kicked in the stomach over and over. I had to hand him over to his father again.

<FONT SIZE=""-6"">I scared myself.
I felt like I could have hurt him.</font>

G allowed me to scream and throw things around like a two year old and then tucked me back into bed. He tried to convince me that the reason I was feeling what I felt was because I hadn't slept or ate in days. At that point I truly felt like it was because I was a horrible person. I was scared of him going to work in the morning and me being left alone again. Scared shitless.
I got almost 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep that night while G sat up with Riley.
I have the most wonderful husband, after working 76 hours this week and looking after a miserable baby all day and all night he kept his wits about him while I fell to pieces.

And he was right after all, I woke up this morning feeling like my old self again.
Thank God.

I can do this.
If this is the bottom I can climb up.

I can do anything for my son."

It's been one year almost exactly since I had a cigerette.
God, how good one puff is. The taste, the tingle, the high.
One puff can't hurt breastmilk can it?

Oh well, I've screwed up everything else already."

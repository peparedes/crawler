"event","This really isn't fair. All I wanted to do today was go to the skating rink. But my mom is too effin lazy and ""sick"" to take me. She looks fine to me. Cheree is asleep. I really wanted to go. I haven't went in three years. I have the money. I have the clothes. I don't have the transportation. Marisa won't go unless I go, so I guess thats okay. Thats nice of her. Rebecca was flirting Marisa's crush. Gah. When Tab calls me I'll go over and I can start my workout regime. I haven't had much sugar. I gave Will my free soda cap because I am not drinking any sprite (too much sugar) and Marisa didn't want it. I dont want to hang out with Rebecca anymores. Shes very different. Shes even got a boyfriend, a black kid named bryan. hes an idiot. I cant believe she likes him. I keep my talking to Rebecca down to a few paragraphs a day. It doesn't seem to bother her. Shes too busy with Bryan and all the preps. I got three-four wrong on my vocab test. I feel really bad. I didn't finish my english test. Lets pray that I can get it finished Monday after some Iowa testing, actually, lets pray my teacher LETS me finish. Anyways, I am tired, and I have alot of avs to get to. Twenty more for the high score list. Great... that'll be very hard.

I mean, did she REALLY think that her parents were gonna say ""oh thats nice, hope everything works out!!"" hell no. they were like ""YOURE THIRTEEN YOU CANT DATE ANYONE YOURE TOO YOUNG!!!!!!!!"" and she was like ""I couldnt lie to them!"" Well did they ask her directly ""when you went to the mall on friday did anyone ask you out??"" seriously. and she said ""well bryan has been calling all day"" WELL SAY HES YOURE DAMN FRIEND FOR GODS SAKE!!!! she blew it. anyways, my mom was being a reall ass on saturday. first she got mad at me because I used my toe to press off my modem and she said ""YOURE SO RUDE STOP IT!"" and sent me to my room. oh sheez.

and then I came home and decided to call dell because I was tired of not having a damn computer. well, after an hour,  the guy concluded that I needed a new hard drive. swell. my mom exploded and we got in a fight because my mom doesnt know the first thing about computers and she doesnt know anything....
NOW TODAY, lordy, cheree was like ""I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU DID THIS WEEK TO GET YOUR ALLOWANCE"" and I was like ""i did the litter, vacuumed, and did the trash... "" and she yelled at me and such and gah shes such a hypocrit I hate her sometimes.... well alot. and my mom.
It wasnt a good thing when I suggested to my mom to spend the night over tabs. harhar, she was like ""I DONT LIKE THIS NO MORE NO MORE OF THIS SHIT bleep bleep de bleep.""  and then she was like ""COME HERE INTO THE KITCHEN"" and she yelled at me for only cleaning two dishes. gah. well, she said 'DO THE DAMN DISHES RIGHT NOW BY HAND MISSY OR ELSE YOU'LL BE GOING BACK INTO YOUR ROOM!!"" shitttt. well, I did em, and my mom was all attitudey so I just left. and it hasnt been so well.... rebecca is all weird now she cusses for no reason and shes all boy crazy. at the fair ""OMFG HE IS SOOOOOOO SEXY OMFG HE IS SOOO HOT I LIKE HIM ALOT OMFG I LOVE RON "" and I wanted to punch her in her head and kick her. she was like ""its puberty"" and I was like ""FUCK THAT SHIT and GET BACK TO BEING REBECCA WOULD YOU!?"" she talks like my sister. if i turn out like rebecca, you must shoot me. i g2g, no time to check email, adios/ =(

"event","I had alot of fun with Marisa and got my dad tons of reese's and a gray t-shirt that I got especially decaled. :-D. On the last night, we went to the candy kitchen and got a sundae. I personally would have just rathered a regular vanilla ice cream and a cherry or two, but they were putting on hot fudge, marshmallows, cherries, strawberries, sprinkles, chocolate chips, almonds, walnuts, and whipped cream. I just put on a drop of hot fudge, some cherries, walnuts, and choclate chips. YUCK. I will never eat that stuff again. I had to swallow quickly and swallow before I let myself taste it again. Anyways, the prices there were outrageous for taffy. It was 6.25, but I got a box for my mom anyways. I also got 2 bucks worth of sour gummy worms. Yum. I must have been on a candy eating spree. I have never eaten so much sugar in my life. Gah. On friday we went to kevin browne's father's funeral. it was pretty boring. at the end, me and marisa tapped him on the shoulder and said we were sorry, I said it first, and he gave each of us hugs. It felt all weird. But I need to be friends with SOME of the boys, I need vice prez votes!!! Anyways, the ride to ocean city took soooooooooo long and it was hot. The A/C was only freezing our feet. Then we went to the boardwalk. The ddr game prices were awful. For TWO songs it was a damn dollar. and everyone there sucked. then there was this showoff who like, looked at everyone while he was doing the song, though he MEMORIZED ALL OF THE STEPS. Cheater. Then we went on the rides. I went on the inverter. at first I was scared half to death, but it wasnt bad at all. me and marisa went on the wipeout ride. Oh lordy. It was fun and fast. We did it twice in a row. Then we went to the aladdin's castle like fun house thing. Marisa told me to fall back on the spinny wheel thing and I said ""ok"" and then the next thing I know I am spinning and my back was killin me. We didnt go on the boat. but on saturday night we slept outside on the balcony. that was alot of fun. I went to sleep late. Marisa woke me up at 6 but I was like ""nonanonanno dont touch me get away nononono!"" if you say nonanonano it sounds right, instead of reading it. 
Today was school. The new BJN kids are here. They never said a word. Theres three MOY GRANDE girls and one of them sits at my table, what luck. I am sitting across william riviera and will wright (go figure, we're not related) who are extremely stupid. I cant handle it. Poor rebecca. she is sitting with SHANE and BEN and some new kid. Gah. Mr Bennet made it a point to separate us (rebecca, me, and marisa). I swear, Marisa is so thick and dumb. Gawd. Rebecca had her period. Shes tellin me she thinks about sex and stuff. shes more open to these things. I know, dont yell at me saying ""oh its gonna happen to you!"" i know it for a fact but its just awkward. anyway,she had mood swings and blood everywhere. :( poor her. boys got it too easy. IT WAS SO EFFIN HOT IN THAT CLASSROOM!! Mr bennet didnt say anything about the a/c. Five minutes into class and I am already dying of sweat and I needed water, but my water was still frozen. It was a disaster. Will smelled dsgusting. I am sooooo short and mr bennet gave me the tallest locker. I can reach it and all, butits not very easy. and the huge fat girl got the bottom locker! I just want one in the middle. Jeez.

I got trillian but I later deleted it. I wasn't really used to it. I have a headache. My glasses are all weird and disfigured by maufacturing.

"event","That quote, Tab, cracks me up everytime. It is so effin funny!! Lol! Anyways, I got a uniform from Rebecca today because I would had to have waited for september 20th for my damn uniforms. What the hell? What did they think I was gonna wear to school till then? My long fucking pants? Hell no. Damn school place.
I am gonna go to the ocean with Marisa on Friday. I had to miss my karate promotion, but thats okay, when I get promoted at karate class they will say something that they thought of me, something good, which I always dreamed of. Kris helped make my shoebox Harry's dream room. It looks awesome. She did most of the work.... yeah yeah I am no cheater!! Just I am not very handy with craft items! I gave her all ze ideas! Dont yell at me....
Tab's essays were pretty good when I read them last night. My mom was in her 'mood' and such. I had one weird fucking dream. I was in the planet Saturn with Tab, Sam (that pest has been in my last two dreams!!), and their grandparents. We landed at this place and got changed into these really dressy outfits then I ran out to this huge dock, a slab of thin wood fell on me, and I jumped up, unharmed. The rest of the five level dock fell down too. I started to run. The next thing I know, I am Harry James Potter, and I was asking these people for help, and they were like ""uh... no. Youre delerious, Voldemort isnt back, youre a loony like Dumbledore!"" and I got all p.oed and ran out into the street. The street wasnt placed in Saturn anymore, I was in a city street and then I saw this guy and he was looking at me funny so I dared him to do something and we talked them bam, I whopped his ass (not like beating him up but comeback wise) and then I woke up. Sleeping over Tab's was really hard for me. It was extremely hot, and I had a pounding headache and I had alot of things (especially people) on my mind. We watched weird science last night but Tab went to sleep in the middle and she started to kick me so I moved down to de floor. *sigh*. I dont know.... today was a pretty rancid day.... blah.
Cheree just used the computer. Shes like ""oh, i can do it myself, this is how I learn!"" well, she sucked with the thing. She didnt know how to open up the browser, and didnt know how to use the space bar, she didnt spell a damn thing right, and she didnt even find the X button! I had to point it out three times. God... old people were not meant to work with technology...

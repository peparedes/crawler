"event",".. I'm not tired!  I went to bed last night at about 12:30 and I'm feeling fine.  I am very excited for Lit today because we get to have a discussion on 'What is Love?'.  A fun essay we all got to read.  Love it to peices.  Should be fun to talk about.  I have to say that I am finally getting a grip on things.  I understand about all the homework and it is a bad idea to put all of it off the night before (which I haven't done yet!).  I met these really cool girls names Melia and Krista.  They are awesome.  Then there is this great guy named Scott who I absolutely love because of his t-shirts (two of them being: 'How many vegetables have to die for your stupid salad?' and 'You laugh at me because I'm different, I laugh at you because you're all the same').  And I keep seeing people from Pomona who are being really nice and cool.  People that weren't exactly talkative to me in school.  It's nice.
<p>I love all my history classes.  It's strange how history really intrigues me.  I never get bored with it and I find every aspect of it wonderful.  My history teacher was talking about how is other history class is a Native American history class and I almost died.  I would absolutely LOVE to be in that class!  I have definitely decided that history is the way to go for me.  
<p>What did I want to talk about?  Oh yes, the beginning topic, what is love? And suddenly I think of that horrific song in 'A Night at the Roxburry.'  But with that aside, I will go into what I think love is. *ahem* I think that love is when one person can make you get up in the morning.  Love is when you do things with the other party in mind (good or bad).  Love is inherit in all the people of the world and I truly believe that there is one person for everyone.  It just takes a matter of time to find them.  Love will make you work harder, laugh longer and care just a little bit more than you thought you could.  Love is knowing that the simplest things such as being with the other party will make you happy.  Love doesn't need expensive gifts or dinner dates.  Love is being in your pajamas with the person you love and watching movies. Love is sitting on the hood of your car and watching the stars in complete silence.  Essentially, love is...there.  When you love someone, it hangs in the air and it creates a comfortable silence.  No words are really needed to express love. 
<p> And now that I have become a romantic buffoon, I must head off to class.  Ta!"

"event","It's so nice to be back home...well, I never left, but it's nice to actually to on the home computer.  I think that this is a good computer.  Did I mention that we got a new one?  Yeah, it's a good one. 
<p> But what did I want to write about tonight?  There was something...but, now I cannot remember.  But yeah, I found my way out to Sherry's party.  I did it without directions. I found my way there out of memory. It was cool because I've only been there once and when I was there it was at night.  So I was really proud of myself.  And I was quite astounded.  But that's besides the point.  Anywho...I went to Sherry's party and it was a bunch of fun. We tried to save some toads from a life of darkness, but then decided that they were better off in the hole that they were living in. That was just one highlight of the evening, but there were many more.  
<p> I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching the CU/CSU football game. Go Buffs!  I was very happy that they won.  I have decided that Buffs' football and the SuperBowl are the only games I will watch.  I even plan to go to the Buffs' games when I can.  Should be fun.  You know what was weird though? I was sitting there watching the game with my father and my dad asked to me, ""So, that Zach kid is probably out there isn't he?""  And I nodded, ""Yeah, most likely he is.""  And as soon as the words came out of my mouth, Zach appeared on National Television with the rest of the CU cheerleaders.  And for some odd reason, I was very proud of Zach.  I think he is right where he belongs.  When I heard that there were over 76,000 people there, I knew that Zach was most likely on the biggest high of his life.  Zach down on Invesco field in front of 76,000 people, good for him.  I'm glad for him, he is <i> right</i> where he belongs.  
<p> But enough of that.  I have to go, but I wanted to update about being back here.  YAY!"

"event","And yet, it's a sad one.  Pippy is going to be leaving tomorrow.  And I am sad...come Patsy...wait.  That doesn't make any sense...but sense when have I made sense?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  
<p> I went to work today and things were not cool.  Sometimes I think that watching grass grow would be more entertaining.  But I haven't tried watching grass grow..but strangely enough, I have watched molasses roll down a tree.  Took the molasses a total of thirty minutes to get down to the ground...hi everyone, my name is Mollye and I am an idiot.
<p> Thought you ought to know...
<p> Some of you might have caught onto the fact that I am trying to stay upbeat because of the impending approach of the great Pippy exodus.  She is leaving tomorrow and I feel as if someone is cutting off one of my legs.  I didn't see it coming, but Emily has become my very closest friend.  This fills me with an unforseen ache.  When she leaves, there will be no more understanding of inside jokes, because frankly, only Pippy understands my madness.  And yes, I know that this is only a ""temporary change in location"" but that doesn't make me feel any better.  Pippy will still leave and she won't be only three minutes away from my house.  She will be 3 HOURS away from my house.  I can already feel the distance and that distance is extremely empty.  
<p> The echoes of so much laughter from the two of us fill my head.  God, I will miss her so much.  And strangely enough she is only sitting three feet behind me at the moment and something has dawned on me.  I feel as if I've taken this friendship for granted.  I mean, there were so many times that I didn't call and so on and so forth.  I will make up for it I swear I will.
<p> I've also realized that Emily and I will be friends for life.  We have something that I haven't had with a friend in almost 6 years.  As Andrew once said, ""You guys really are the best of friends.""  It's so nice to have a bond with someone to the point of knowing how she wants her words to be expressed, exactly how.  She and I ""get"" each other without much explanation.  Pippy is like the sister that God forgot to give me.  
<p> And now I will leave this journal with a variety of our inside jokes.  Maybe you will see some of our madness and maybe you will all understand that Pippy is my best friend.
<p>""You ruined it.""
<p>""I RUINED IT""

<p> ""Big Gulps Eh?  Welp, see ya later!""

<p> ""She's a Witch!  Burn her! Burn her!"" (along with most of the script from Monty Python and the Holy Grail...all have inside jokes tied along with them)

<p> ""HE DOES NOT SHAVE HIS LEGS! AND STOP CALLING HIM BALD MAN!""
~~
<p> ""Indeed.""  ""Indubitably.""

"event","Well, if any of you have read Pipster's recent journal, you all know that I have finally been christened with a nickname...well, at least one that I like.  I never liked Shaniqua Crow...got on my nerves...don't know that story? Ask..or talk to Jared, he's one of the people that gave it to me..
<p>.. Anywho, college was fantastic.  I love my literature class, we were all talking about how romanticism in society has changed.  Great stuff.  We will be reading 'The Yellow Wallpaper' soon and I have heard ""great"" things about it.  Should be fun.  The class isn't all that big and the people in it are absolutely brilliant.  
<p> English Comp 121 was also cool.  I love my professor.  She has this really dark and twisted sense of humor..she and I will get along well.  We started out in that class talking about Jerry Garcia/Grateful Dead and The Doors.  Completely off task, but fun.  I have to write a paper for her by Wednesday.  Have to find a place to type it up..I don't want to pay to print (I have to pay here..no thanks).  Most likely I will type it up tomorrow at the college computer lab.  I saw Anand today and in passing, I saw Matt Peters.  That brings the number to....7 people from Pomona that I have seen.  Interesting.  
<p> OMG!  Two Towers comes out tomorrow!  I might just have to go out and get that after my Government class!  *Squeals* YAY! I love Gollum. And other characters....particulary one elf...
<p>...*has flashack of movie* ARGH!  I cannot believe they killed Haldir!  Gah!  Not called for at all. Oh well, things could be worse.  
<p>  I'm excited for tomorrow, I get to go to all my history classes.  Makes me smile.  I love history.  I really want to be a history teacher.  I hope I stick with it.  
<p> I've decided that I love Cold and Chevelle.  Good music.  Very raw with emotions.  It's the kind of music that you can scream the words until your throat gets raw.  I'm really into the kind of music right now.  
<p> This is possibly one of the most random journals I've ever posted.  Hmmm...

"event","Do NOT fight with a dog that is like a small horse in dog's clothing.  
<p> Chip (my bohemeth of a dog) kicked my ass yesterday.  
<p> I decided that it was time to have a good ole fashion tug o' war with my dog.  For all those that don't know, Chip is my favorite dog, he talks and is friendly to everyone he meets.  Great pet.  But also, he is a beast.  I didn't take that into consideration when playing with him.  
<p> Anywho, I started to play with him I started to get rough with him.  Not so good.  He then growled at me and tackled me with his massive paws.  There is nothing more humiliating than getting knocked down by a four-legged companion.  *sigh* but I love my puppy.  
<p> I'm feeling kind of melancholy right now.  Everyone is going to college tomorrow and I am sad.  I'm happy that all you guys are excited to go, but I feel like I'm being left behind.  I HATE that feeling.  And while I know that I'm going to college too, it just feels weird.  *sigh* it also sucks that Pippy will be leaving to Wyoming and we will be far apart.  *cries* Dammit, change can really be a downer.  Change is also something that I have a hard time accepting.  A REALLY hard time.  I don't know, I've always been the one to go kicking and screaming...I never accept things without a ""fight"".  Something I really need to work on.  
<p> But I need to look on the bright side.  I will meet new cool people in college.  I will enjoy my classes.  I will be able to look back on highschool and realize how ridiculous I was.  Change also equals growth.  I hope it happens soon.
<p> ...So I can fight/embrace it.  There's a shocker for you all.

<p>In other news, I have been called in early to work.  I don't know why I agreed to going in, but alas, I did.  I think it's because I need to money.  Desperately.  *still laughs about something none of you can know about*
<p> Things are good, I feel accomplished because I cleaned my room.  I'm such a procrastinator.  Tomorrow I MUST go in and get my student Id made.  I keep putting that off.

<p> Owie.
<p> Pain. incredibly. excrutiating. Kill me..please..put me out of my misery.
<p> Today, was a good day.  It was the senior barbeque.  It started at 11 and ended at about 3.  And let me tell you, I never felt the sun scorching my face.  Never dawned on me to put some sunscreen on, maybe it was because I kept getting doused in water, so I never felt the burn coming.  And let me tell you, it came with a vengence.  
<p> But all the while I was having a good day.  Got to laugh with a bunch of friends, got to watch a bunch of people get bitched at by O.G. (officer Glassman).  And then watched as the senior water fight bordered on riot.  I think that maybe we ruined it for lower classman.  They probably won't be doing it next year, sorry.  :)  Can you tell I'm really broken up about it?  Thought so.
<p> Man, I got so burned that the part of my hair is burned.  Ouch!  God, sunscreen is a good thing.  I wish that I had been smart and put some on!  Oh well, you live and learn.  Now I'm gonna pray that it fades by graduation. Five days should be enough for it to fade...right?
<p> On the flip side of things, I didn't get really all that wet.  Well, except for in the face and back.  But I didn't get it as bad as some of the people got it.  It was funny to watch.  
<p> Well enough of this, my energy is slowly fading...must go put some aloe vera on....

"event","About a week ago I realised something that I suppose I have known for a long time. That I may not have the support as shcool captain that I once enjoyed. I believe that the initial excitement that someone other than brody was captain has now died down and people are starting to consider whether I am the best one for the job. The days where I was cheered on year assembly are long over. They are replaced by the days of ""Remember when Shelley and Dennis were elected captain (remund us why?)"" This appeared on a remember whens sheet and Shelleys name has since been crossed out. I know that I have never been very popular as a person but I once had some respect. This all hasnt been assissted by the fact that everyone but me has worked in leadership positions before (my failed attempt at an SRC spot the only example of me getting off my arse to do something). I am now left to feel as if I am somewhat of an intruder and a pest that has to be there for some reason. I would never critizise a group for voting the wrong way but maybe it would have been better if the prefects had voted brody in the first place. He seems to work with shelley better than I do and almost operated as a captain. Saying all this, i'm not really upset or worried. I know that they all are really good people and are more capable of running the student body than I am. I am happy to take an offstage role. my only worries are that I will be locked out of things completely and everyone who had high expectations about me will be dissapointed in me and regret choosing me and I will have my name on the board without really earning it and everyone will say ""that should have been brody"" I know resignation is not an option but it would be interesting to see what i would do were I given that option.

I'm sorry writing for so long. If you havent stopped reading this you really are special and I thank you. Dont worry about me as i am hardly worried my self. This is the least of my problems, there are many other, and greatly more serious, things which are troubling me and questions which I am trying to answer."

Isn't it great. Please post any comments/complaints so I can duly ignore them. I'm sorry about the messy end of my last post i was brutally usurped by a snotty yr 9 kid. They have no respect these days even for the honorable school captain.

My captainly duties sent me into the fiery depths of Mordor today. In other words I had to walk around the playground talking to random people and recruiting them for a concept that I like to call ""Gosford Idol"". I came to the realisation that there is no real talent at the school. They smell even more than the toilets (which were rather bad today).

That is all i have to add. If this wasn't exciting enough then you'll have to make my life more exciting. (ill leave that one up to you) If you didnt understand what I just said dont worry. If you did understand could you please explain it to me as i have no idea what i just said as I launched myself on a huge ramble which will go on forever unless i slap myself."

"event","<P>Well,</P>
<P>I had rather an interesting day yesterday followed by a rather boring day today. Yesterday started off fairly normal (if you would call an average day at GHS normal) untill i had to venture to a captains forum at riff raff high school (The Entrance HS in this case.) There were about a billion captains there (how many schools are there). Present at this meeting were:<BR>Captain Tool<BR>Captain Cool<BR>Captain ""Im a stupid bitch who'll turn my back and block a certain GHS captain from the conversation""<BR>and Captain ""I really dont have much to add"" ( that was me)<BR></P>
<P>The meeting was dominated with tales of mass disobedience at places such as Wyong HS where it is not uncommon to see a student attach a teacher. Toilets played a major role and it turns out that if you walk into a school toilet and only catch one life threatening disease you are doing well. Most smell like smoke (which is a plesent change from wee wee and urinal cakes) When Shelley told everyone about a certain tampon graffiti incident everyone just looked at her and said ""Thats just wrong"" Anyway after the event we all had a nice little bitch about which captains we hate.</P>
<P>Speaking about captains people hate, I myself am planning to get back to the old days and make a fool of myself on assembly by making corny jokes (no poems) and become more usefull that say your average box of weetbix. But first ill have to get over the complaining by a large number of smart people who decided to sigh a certain petition and maybe land themselves on an executive detentions. If you are one of theose people my answer is NO.</P>
<P>Today i went for a drive in the rain and won a game of darts with my dad. </P>
<P>I hope those of you who are loyally following my life story were pleased by this latest edition.</P>"

"event","Welcome to my first livejournal post. May I congratulate you on choosing to read my post as opposed to doing the millions of other things on the Internet which are obviously more exciting. You have made an excellent choice which I'm sure will pay off and I will always have a special place in my heart for you (unless you are Joe Cunningham in which case you can fuck off.) Umm that was a joke. I will keep my first livejournal slander for later.

Well anyway this will keep me amused for the two weeks it will take for me to get over it and find something better to do. It will also keep you amused as you ask eachother in the corridors, ""did you SEE what Dennis wrote on his livejournal."" ""Yes I did, I can't believe how much of a wanker he is."" 

I will make my first real post with substance later in which i will entail some of my adventures including my high risk trip to riff raff high school where I have a captains forum this afternoon.

I reserve the right to make things up in order to make my life sound more exciting that it really is."

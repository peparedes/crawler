"event","Man it's been awhile since I've updated but I was looking at Anisa's journal and ran across some old lyrics to this really great song. So who ever reads this I really suggest if you've never heard this song download it. It'll probably get you sad or something or probably thinking about someone special. But just do it!



""Louder Than Words""

Penned this one last
because it was the hardest
Yet it meant the most to me at the same time
Feelings are tough to explain
when what i feel is bigger than any word that i can find

[chorus]
So i wrote you this song
To tell you i love you
But I know that thats much less than you deserve
It's all so much less
Then these feelings i'm feeling
I hope my actions speak louder than words
Call me whenever, and i will come running
I'm ready and waiting for ever for you
I'll give you my whole heart
To hold as your keepsake
If you should ever need proof

Remembering the times that we spent together
I know how good it feels to be in your arms
Im always so happy and filled up with laughter
when ever i'm with you i feel safe and warm

[chorus]

[x2]
Call me whenever, and i will come running
I'm ready and waiting for ever for you
I'll give you my whole heart
To hold as your keepsake
If you should ever need proof"

""Goodbye To You""

Of all the things I've believed in 
I just want to get it over with 
Tears form behind my eyes 
But I do not cry 
Counting the days that pass me by 

I've been searching deep down in my soul 
Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old 
It feels like I'm starting all over again 
The last three years were just pretend 
And I said, 

Goodbye to you 
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew 
You were the one I loved 
The one thing that I tried to hold on to 

I still get lost in your eyes 
And it seems that I can't live a day without you 
Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away 
To a place where I am blinded by the light 
But it's not right 

Goodbye to you 
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew 
You were the one I loved 
The one thing that I tried to hold on to 

And it hurts to want everything and nothing at the same time 
I want what's yours and I want what's mine 
I want you 
But I'm not giving in this time 

Goodbye to you 
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew 
You were the one I loved 
The one thing that I tried to hold on to 
The one thing that I tried to hold on to 

And when the stars fall 
I will lie awake 
You're my shooting star."

I
Played the fool today
And I
Can see us vanishing into the crowd
Longing for home again
But home
Is a feeling I buried in you

I'm alright
I'm alright
It only hurts when I breathe

And I can't ask for things to be still again
No I can't ask for you
To offer the world through your eyes
Longing for home again
But home
Is a feeling I buried in you

I'm alright
I'm alright
It only hurts when I breathe
I'm alright
I'm alright
It only hurts when I breathe

Nothing hides
And everything sings
I'm counting the signs
And cursing the miles in between

But home
Is a feeling I buried in you
That I buried in you

I'm alright
I'm alright

It only hurts when I breathe

You and I got something
But it's all and then it's nothing to me
And I got my defenses
When it comes to your intentions for me
And we wake up in the breakdown
Of the things we never thought we could be

I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
What do you got to move you darling
I thought I lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all

And I want to get free talk to me
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be all you need
Somehow here is gone

I have no solution
To the sound of this pollution in me
And I was not the answer
So forget you ever thought it was me
I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
What do you got to move you darling
I thought I lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all

And I want to get free talk to me
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be all you need
Somehow here is gone

And I don't need the fallout of all the past
That's here between us
And I'm not holding on
And all your lies weren't enough to keep me here

And I want to get free talk to me
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be all you need
Somehow here is gone

And I want to get free talk to me
I can feel you falling
I know it's out there
I know it's out there
I can feel you falling
I know it's out there

"event","today was like any other day, dull boring, adn tiring. oh ya todays davids birthday, happy birthday david. so i guess today wasnt as bad as i thought it was because it was good for david, hopefully. first pd we played sorry and the guys kept cheating cause they kept on sending me back to start but at least i didnt get last. third pd we played uno and boy did i forget how to play that game. thats old skool right there. fifth pd we lifted weights and found out what groups were in. im in group 5 and we have some pretty good guys and upperclassmen in our group. on my last lift of squats i told jaime i was gonna move up for him, and i ended up peeling it the first set doing only four so he was all like aye gilbert i thought you were gonna do it for me what happened! then i moved on to the 2nd,3rd,and 4th sets and i lifted two extra reps proving that i was actually going all out for jaime. coach pulled my hair even though it was super short and told me he liked the hair cut. i went to go get water after lifting weights and on the way i pinched most of the guys for not wearing green they suddenly realized iwasnt wearing green but i ran away from them and took off to the locked room and put on my green shirt. 6th pd the guys took off for the track meet and OJ called me up to see how good rio was i told himthat they were pretty good but more than likely they failed so they wouldnt be there. he said hed call me back int he afternoon to tell me how it went. so hopefully they did good. after school i went to jaimes moms house and played the incredibles new video game on xbox with jaimes nephew markie. mom got there around 530 and we headed to anthonys raspa stand and i bought a huge rocky road icecream cone. then i got home, called nikki to tell her i was trying to win her tickets for maroon five buti failed and she never answered. so i had to cut the grass, so i missed some of smallville damn. i took a break so i could see the last 20 min and my mom watched it with me for the first time and she thought tom welling was a fox she liked the show adn cried because ryan died. after it ended i called nikki and we talked and talked and talked, listened to music, but mine was better than hers. and weve talked all night. my day was boring i guess, except when i watched smallville and talked to nikki."

"event","yesterday i woke up at 12 and i had cookies and cream ice cream for breakfast, mmmm goood. i called nikki to wake her up since she didnt go to school either cause she broke her stupid foot hahaha but she didnt answer of course because she was SLEEPING. about 2 i made lunch for myself, potatoe poTA-TOE. haha. i watched you go t served, then listened to some music. and while i was watching it, somebody interruppted, it was nikki. she finally had woken up from her beauty sleep and we talked all day, talked all day, talked all day since we both stayed home. and that was pretty much my day for yesterday.
today i woke up at 6 in the morning cause my mom told me i had to miss school again so i could let the guys in so they could do what they had to do for the phonelines and i wanted somebody to hit me so i could go back to sleep and then finally around 815 bob called to see why i hadnt showed up to school but i told him blahblahblah and said iw as sick. suddenly my eyes got heavy and i began to close them and then i heard jaime calling me and iwaslike what what and he said he was taking off and he told me to get up cause the sbc guys were here to install the dsl or whatever by the time the guys had taken off my brother showed up thats when he interrupted my delicious cooking. we listened to music and set up the dsl connections and we found out that we needed an ethernet or some crap like that so we headed to best buy but holy heck they were 80 dollars. and thats alot of money so icalled up my mom too see what i should do about it, so when she got home she went to buy it so my brother and me headed off to mcdonalds and he started bitching at me cause i asked him tosupersize it but he said iwas gonna get fat. but i told him i had nothing to worry about cause ill make that fat into muscle. after that we headed back to the house he was pissed because iwas eating in his truck and he wanted to drive, adn he wanted to eat too. when we got home i closed my eyes for 37 minutes and thepunk woke me up cause hewas taking off.  i called up nikki and she was taking off to pick up her brother from karate so she said shed call me back about 630 she aclled me back and i was watching smallville and then she noticed that i wasnt really paying attention so she said just to call her back when it was done. i called up nikki after i watched smallvile and eating and turns uot she watched the ending too. and we talked and talked and talked and then we got in a big argument, and i told her id call her back later , and she got even more mad, so we just hung up. so i headed for the shower. i played a quick game of spider solitare. then i called up nikki to say i was sorry for being a jerk and she said she would call me back cause she was busy and she was still kinda mad. and right when i was headed to sleep she woke me up, and started complaning that i shouldnt go to sleep cause we hadnt talked cause i had said i had to go earlier, and i said you wake up at 6, and she said i shouldnt have hung up earlier. while we were talking i started to write in my journal. the end.

"event","Friday afternoon i got back from my aunts wedding and ended up going to a show with nikki and her sister at the vfw in mcallen. when a thorn for every heart was on they did some heart hand sign, and they got the whole crowd to do it, then nikki was making me do it and i did it the opposite way and she was making fun of me cause she said my heart was retarted, while the band was playing nikki jacked up my livestrong braclet, and i ended up taking her heart bracelet. after the band finished playing i asked nikki to sit down iwth me adn unfortunatley i picked teh worst time to sit down and then bam. oww. uh lets see well ya, the speakers fell on us. big speakers. BIG. and then i picked up the one that fell on me, adn i didnt even know one fell on nikki, and then i felt stupid because i was just there and her sister was there, so i put my arms around her leg and she was crying.  so i tried to cheer her up by picking up a beetle even though she told me not to get it, but instead of laughing she got mad at me and told me to wash my hands or she would never hold my hand again. so then we went outside and i tried to walk on the little pole thingy and lost my balance and tried to make her laugh but only her sister was laughing. we were gonna go eat but things didnt work out that way so we just went home. today i asked collin if he had gone to the show on friday and he had asked me why whatever and i told him cause i had gone too and he asked me well why was i being a stranger and not talking to him , because i dindt know it was him and then walking in the hallway to class i kept trying to do the heart thingy to make it perfect, and it made me miss her. after school i stopped by anthonys new job at the raspa stand and got a fruit cup and it was muy delicioso.

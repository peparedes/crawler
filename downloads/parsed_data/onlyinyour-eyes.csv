I really want to trust you but now its like the wall the ""I swear to God's"" its like they dont mean anything anymore I really miss the way everything was when you drove my house and begged to talk to me on the phone and I would say i have to go and go to sleep but you just keeped begging me to stay on so i did but when i ask you to stay on the phone its like right away NO! and when you used to begg me I told you ""you know if i were doing this to you you would just say im hanngin up and not even care"" and you said babe i promise i wont do that anymore and i really belived you because I'm so inlove with you...and that one friday that i had a game at the O.V you said PLEASE awnser your phone because im gaunna be on break so ill call you and it was the cutist thing because i was sitting in the hall way talkin to you and you were just being the sweist guy and thats the guy I love but its like I have all the sympathy for you when we were in reverse but when it comes to me you could care less and just think about how you feel about it and not really care even though I cared for you that time it just sucks i guess but no matter  how many arguments we get into I still wanna be with you Its just an argument and everyone has them .... I'm so stressed and I got this trip im going to on sunday to detriot for a concert its gunna be sweet but I dono if i can leave knowing nothing... OH and teasly what really bothers me is that you ask everyone of my friends like stef harp and others unmention saying ""Yeah Alyssia hates me and i Dont even know why?"" that is the dumpist question you could ever ask your stupid its like you a girl and i feel like he's cheatin on me but with YOU TEASLY its the weirdist thing... you make him lie which jsut pisses me off oh by the way ROT IN HELL! thanks"

I'm always worried all the time it's driving me nuts.  I'm so worried sometimes that I just start crying I dono what to do.  Teasly you're a jackass you wanna know why because you called me a ""mexicana Punta"" if you're going to call me something in spanish make sure you're saying it correctly so you don't look like a dumb ass when I correct you... Teasly, tu eres un beboso Yo quire a pegar a ti porque tu es un stupido binche madre Punto!! I hate you don't ever call me that again. I don't get why anyone would want to go out with you besides they might be blind.

i think this song tells pretty much how i feel well sorta... :( it makes me cry i love that song

..On a Monday, I am waiting..
Tuesday, I am fading...
And by Wednesday, I can't sleep..
Then the phone rings, I hear you...
And the darkness is a clear view..
Cuz you've come to rescue me...

Fall... With you, I fall so fast..
I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts...

Ohhhhh..
It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real..
I like the way that feels..

Friends first and then everything else that's how it goes... I sit here just thinking about what wrong thing your going to do and if you'll tell me or not or what girl are you with... What girl you want to kiss... What girl you want to hold... I used to feal enough but now I just feel like im on the sidelines always being their for you and Everytime I need you you're not their...I want to trust you in my heart but something in my head says don't, don't let yourself ack and pain over something  you knew was going to happen... I sit here worried almost wanting to cry because I feel now like I did that night ... sitting here tears fall from my face ...last night thinking about everything tears feel from my face... I just have this little acking pain in my mind and heart and stomic that just keeps nuging me and nuging me saying somethings going to happen... I hate feeling like this everyday but mostly when your with him...



I miss the trust that I use to have for you 
I miss the way you used to look in my eyes
I miss the way you said ""I love you""
I miss the way you used to hold me
but most of all I miss the way you tell me ""Everything will be alright I promise""

What do you do when you think about them all the time knowing they dont."

"event","18 tips about girls: 


1. If you like Her .. ASK HER OUT already! 

2. when you hug her, put YOUR ARMS around her WAIST and hold her close. 

3. when you WALK next to her, get as CLOSE as you can to her. 

4. if she's the only one in your life, TELL HER. 

5. ALWAYS let her know how much you like her, love her, or think about her. 

6. give her presents and cards for no reason, SHE WILL RETURN THE 
FAVOR... ALWAYS. 

7. if she hangs up on you, call her right back. 

8. always offer to pay, if she says NO twice, then let her pay but 
make a deal that you get to pay next time (date offer too!). 

9. kiss her lightly every chance you get. 

10. look in her eyes and kiss her on the lips, forehead, or nose. 

11. if she says she's cold, don't be an idiot and say ""me too"" and 
stand there, give her your jacket or just simply hold her in your arms. 

12. don't force her to do anything she's not comfortable with. 

13. invite her to dinner or somewhere where you can talk, instead of the movies. 

14. try not to ask her if she's mad at you EVERY TIME you speak to her. 

15. Always tell her you LOVE her only if you really mean it. 

16. DON'T pressure her to do anything she isnt READY to do. When she is ready, she will let you know. She just wants everything to be more SPECIAL and PERFECT. So appreciate what she does do with you. 

17. DON'T' go and tell your friends anything that happens between you two, cause it will hurt her and make her mad...and it will NEVER 
happen again. 

18. Call her .. girls love to be called or just send litte text messages to them, this will make them think about you all day. 

Little facts about girls : 

When a GIRL is quiet, Millions of things are running through her 
mind. 

When a GIRL is not arguing, She is thinking deeply. 

When aGIRL looks at you with eyes full of questions, she is wondering how long you will be around. 

When a GIRL answers ""I'm fine"" after a few seconds, she is not at all fine. 

When a GIRL stares at you, she is wondering why you are lying. 

When a GIRL lays on your chest, She is wishing for you to be hers forever. 

When a GIRL wants to see you everyday, She wants to be 
pampered. 

When a GIRL says I love you, she means it. 

When a GIRL says ""i miss you"", no one in this world can miss you more than that. 

GUYS- repost if you are going to treat your next gf this way, or do 
treat 
her this way. 
GIRLS- repost if you think guys should understand this

Your birth on the 19th day of the month adds a tone of independence and extra energy to your life path. 

But at the same time, it poses a number of obstacles to overcome before you are able to be as independent as you would like. The number 1 energy suggests more executive ability and leadership qualities than your path may have indicated. 



A birthday on the 19th of any month gives greater will power and self-confidence, and very often a rather original approach. However, a somewhat self-centered approach to life that may be in conflict with some of the other influences in your life. 

This 1 energy may diminish your ability and desire to handle details, preferring instead to paint with a broad brush. 



You are sensitive, but your feeling stay somewhat repressed. 

You have a compelling manner that can be dominating in many situations. 

You do not tend to follow convention or take advice very well. 



Consequently, you tend to learn through experience; sometimes hard experiences. 

The 19/1 is a loner number and you may experience feelings of being alone even if you are married. 

You may take on a tendency to be nervous and angry.</td>

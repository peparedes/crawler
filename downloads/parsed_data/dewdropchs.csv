"event","Hey you all! I hope that you're having a fantastic spring break, or that it was relaxing in some form or fashion. At the beginning of mine I sprained my ankle bad, like a dumbbutt, =/ but the break got a lot better, and I could not have asked for a better road trip buddy! Val, we'll have to do it again! =) Let me fill you in on what's been going on in my neck of the woods...oh man, it's been fun - let me tell you. 

With UT, well I didn't get into the dance program, but I was kind of expecting it because I didn't do as well as I'd hoped in the audition and it's a fricken hard program to get into. But anyway - didn't get into that program, but I still haven't heard from the actual university, if that makes sense to y'all. I haven't talked to my parents because of what's been going on, which I will get to later, but I don't know if I'm going to return to TX State in the Fall of next year, we'll see. 

So for the biggest news of my life right now - my dad got a job offer in Virginia, random place - I know. So he's going to be working for the federal government doing who knows what, and being gone now for about 6 months, at least that's what his contract is for. If he likes it, and his boss likes it, etc. etc. etc. (I just saw the King and I) then my family will be moving to Virginia. Crazy, huh? I know. If they move that doesn't necessarily mean that I'll move, but that is a possibility. A cool thing about moving is that NY is only 2 hours away by train! whoooooo hooooo! For those of you who know me well yall know I LOVE NY, the theatres, the feeling, the overall environment. That would be kinda nifty, but leaving my awesome - fantastic friends - not so nifty. I've done a lot of thinkin, and I have no idea what's going to happen, but that's my life as of now.

School is suckin a lot, I'm stressing about all my grades, and all this home crap isn't helping, so basically I'm stressin' a lot and that's why I haven't updated in well - forever. lol. That's about it for now. Does anyone know when Phantom of the Opera is coming out on DVD??? If you do, please let me know!

I have to go try to do homework now, but for my usual question/poll thing...
If you could work anywhere in the world, where would it be and why?"

I miss working...now that I've been in the work atmosphere, I wanna go back. There are NO jobs whatsoever in San Marcos! UGGGGGGH! Anyhoo...schools goin alright...I think we'll see what happens after my first tests. Well, now I'm off to eat, and then go dancin' in San Antonio tonight. If I don't talk to people before they leave, HAVE FUN AT ALL STATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =) I know that you all will have a blast. 

Has anyone heard about the SuperBowl halftime show? The ""family oriented"" show with Paul McCartney and Josh Gracin...I don't know how that will be, but whatev. However, I'm really looking forward to the Star Spangled Banner being sung by Alicia Keys and a big group of the blind/deaf gospel choir in honor of Ray Charles. *tear*

I hope everyone has a fantastic weekend with Superbowl, and I hope your team wins!!! =)

So, it has been a really long time since I did this whole updating business, and instead of reading and writing a paper I do believe that I am going to update. =) Exciting! Well...school has started, unfortunately, BUT I love being back and hangin out with my girls here =D. Val and Nikki Jo - yall are fantastic! *muah* And I'm still IN LOVE with The Phantom of the Opera, i don't think that love will ever go away...who all knows what I'm talkin' about?

I worked at Connally for those two weeks, and I loved it - oh so much. I can't believe how much I miss those people. ugh! Got a little too much Ginger time, buuut I had fun catchin up with others, you all know who yall are ;). ANyhoo I saw BENJAMIN in Grease!!!!! And I was soooooooo proud of him. Good job Ben, you were awesome!!!! 

I had my UT audition for the BFA program there, and it didn't go as well as I wanted it to, but there is nothing I can do about it now. For the most part getting into the actual university is going to be the biggest factor for my future, so we'll see what happens, but for now...I'm going to keep hoping and praying that they saw in me, the passion that I hold for dance. We can only hope

Now I am going to finally go read for Philosophy and English, good times. And I'm puttin a poll here from the Real World that will air on Tuesday...

I hope yall had a fantastic New Years Eve. I didn't have much of one, so I won't indulge...

I had a great New Year's Day, though, which started with me going to bed at 4:30 in the am, and awaking to my mother pulling me off the floor. (We had a lot of people staying over so I got stuck on the floor in the corner :-/) Anyhoo...watched the Rose Parade, but I missed LHB, whoops. Got dressed and headed to Annalisa's neighbors' house to watch the big game. WHAT A GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW! It was incredible!!! One of THE best college football games EVER. hands down. Then after the game, we ate a great meal - they made me eat a bit of cabbage and black eyed pease(blegh) for wealth and luck, annnd then mashed potatoes, and pork roast I think - anyways, it was good. Then we watched Return of the Jedi!!! woOot! I love Star Wars...goooood stuff. And then I came home, and Michael was leaving so we talked for a bit. And he told me I looked like Natalie Portman - yay! Then he left and unfortunately I was left wide awake. Soooo I jabbered online for quite a bit, and talked with my 3rd grade husband(ha ha), and Stephen...good times right there. =)

I start working tomorrrow! wicked...I'm really happy. AND I'm going to the SPURS game on the 4th with Val, Ben, and Jordan!!!! SO FRICKEN EXCITED! I can't wait to see them...I haven't seen em all break :-/ - But I sure will see them Tuesday, and then Wednesday night is the ALIAS premeire!!! I've been waiting a lonnnnnng time for that to happen. And I guess that's about it, so I'm off to get something to eat. =)

I'm really crushin' on the Phantom of the Opera...anyone else? =)
""Wishing you were somehow here again, knowing we must say goodbye.
Try to forgive, teach me to live, give me the strength to try...

Boar's Head is next weekend! Ahhh...I guess I better practice a weee bit. ;)

So let's see...I'll begin with Christmas Eve mass, and me playing my horn in the ""orchestra."" Got to sit in the back with Josh! annnnnd totally DID NOT get the memo about the green and red shirt thing so I totally wore pink...ha ha. It went well - it was totally packed, and I didn't think we were that great, but it's alright, it was Christmas Eve! =) After that shindig I went to my grandma's house, where I picked up a lip gloss kit, Princess Diaries 2(Chris Pine=hott), and a cool dance calender. Then we came home and did the traditional one gift opening routine and got another calendar, only this one was of cats - hooray. The closest thing to me having a cat - a calendar. =/

Christmas mornin' woke up from my brother shaking me to wake up. Never shake a teenager when she's sleeping. sheesh! Then went downstairs and found a pair of CUTE black shoes to go with the outfits my mom had bought for me at Kohl's, LOVE ACTUALLY (one of my favorite movies...EVER) AND NOTTING HILL! Fantastic! A Sleeping Beauty snow globe (thanks Annalisa=D), clothes, the Josh Groban DVD/CD of his latest tour - GREAT, and a picture frame I've wanted for a while...good times. Then we headed over to one of my uncle's house...asss usual, and proceded to eat too much, as usual. Afterwards we went to my grandma's house to watch a few home videos that my aunt put onto a dvd, and they were hilarious. They ranged from my mom being a teenager, and my aunts and uncles doing their own made up skits to family birthday parties when I was about 2-4. It was great, except for the fact that I was a chunky, bossy toddler...but really - who isn't? Ok!

Soooooo the 26th was Andrew's birthday, annd they had a little get together at his house which was fun. Good food! And I think he liked his many Snickers bars =). Then we played UNO Attack (fun game) and watched Napoleon Dynamite with Andrew, Rachel, David, my brother, our old neighbor Jennie and her husband Blake...and that was whoo hoo fun. And today was my brother and Kristin Alo's birthdays!!! Went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner - yumm yumm food. It reminded me of Prom because we sat in one of the corner mirrored booths. Fun times =D!! And I guess that's about it. Lately I've been catching up with people, which is fantastic, annnnd I guess I'm goin to bed. I have, once again, an early mornin tomorrow. Yay for dance!! Ha ha, I just remember about Boar's Head and I totally have not practiced at all for it - actually, that's not so funny...

Poll:
Do you like black and white pictures or color? AND Do you like posed or random pictures better? Just wondering...=) leave your thoughts

I bought myself The Phantom of the Opera soundtrack which I'm totally obsessed with now, and I bought the new Josh Groban cd/dvd combo for my mom, which is also partially for me. YAY! WHO WANTS TO GO SEE THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, CLOSER, and FINDING NEVERLAND WITH ME!?!?! Call me! =D

I saw The Polar Express today, and it was sooooo fantastic! I don't know how anyone could say it wasn't. Seeing it in 3D was neat! Gooood stuff right there, and if you haven't seen it - do it! It's really good, and Josh Groban sings the ending credits song, THAT is one heck of a song. I like it a lot... =)

I'm doing Boar's Head again this year! Yay! I haven't played a horn since May...I forgot how much I loved playing, and sitting by Audrey and Anna is so much fricken fun! It's like old times. Spending time with all the people from Connally is great, and Mr. Scutti is just as crazy, if not crazier than last year which is awesome. ha ha, the leprechaun, the boars head singing man, mr. scutti, that crazy choir lady who was ""singing"", ARod answering the phone in the middle of rehearsal, and sooo much more - good times. This will be fun!

Soooo school wise I made all A's and 1 B in stupid history, giving me a pretty high GPA for my first semester. I'm pretty excited...hopefully it'll be enough to get into UT. I still have to get my teacher recom. and essays done before the 1st week in January, OH and the little thing about getting in shape before my audition on the 22nd. That too. Ahhhh, crazy stuff! Annnnd that's about it for school. I start work on january 3rd - so excited!!! I'm also kind of hesitant about it though, I don't know how I could ever do all that Mrs. Light does. Seriously, I know some of you know, but she does a lot for the band...A LOT! I don't know what Mr. P and the directors, or even most of the students would do if she ever left - it would be no bueno. 

I've been trying to put pictures on here...but I can't. And I want a new background and icon, can someone help me plllllease! Or just tell me how so I'm not always dependent on everyone else. That would be super!

Anyhoo - it's time for me to leave, but before I depart I would like to wish everyone a merry christmas, happy holidays, and happy new year, or a great whatever you celebrate. Safe travels for all who are travelling somewhere else for the season. Have fun, and always be thankful for what we have in our lives! I love all my friends and family, and I'm extremely grateful to have people like you all in my life! Just wanted to say that. =) Buena notte!

I'll have the rest of December freeeeeeee, and January will be full of work at Connally. SO excited! =) It's the holiday season, but Val and I were talking about it earlier and it definately doesn't seem like the holidays. I think we came to the conclusion that it was because of the weather...it wasn't cold enough to be winter. Grrr...I like bundling up! Winter come on down...I'm welcoming you! 

Finals suck...hardcore! Why put all this pressure and stress on students at this time of year!?!?! Golly gee whizz! I miss all my friends from school and dance.

My shows went really well, modern dance=new experience but alright! Thank you to all who came it really really meant a lot to me! =D AND then Saturday was one of the best nights of my life! First I met Erin and Shelby at Bass Concert Hall, and that was great to get to see them! After the show is when it all went down. We decided to go to the backstage door, and who comes walking out?!?! Oh yeah - SASCHA-FRICKEN-RADETSKY! For those of you who do not know who that is - he's Charlie from Center Stage, and one of the best male dancers I've ever seen in my entire life, and we all took a picture with him...he touched my waist and ooooh, I was in heaven! Julie Kent also walked by and was less that two feet away from me - AMAZING DANCER! She's like...my idol! Crazy awesome stuff! Whew...so!

School is going alright, had a lot of stuff due right before break, so I'm glad thats over with. whew! But now Finals are comin up, and after that - parrrrrrty!!! Christmas time, New Years, and workin at Connally!!!! Grrrrreat times! I'm still workin on applications to UT and TCU, my parents have decided that they want me to go to UT, but I really want to go to TCU. I want to dance, and I want a good program to dance in. So we'll see what happens. I have auditions on January 22nd, wish me luck!!!=)

I FINALLY saw Erika Nicole Taylor!!!! So much fun! Today we had lunch with Mrs. Light and Matt came, and that was fantastic! She loved her care package that Nicole and I made...I was super happy about that. Ha ha, and good times with band stories, gooood times! Now I'm straightening my hair with my brand new ceramic straightener that I bought with my money from housesitting, and then I'm soooo off to go to a hockey game, and hang out with the girls from my old dance studio! Soooo excited! 

That's my life for the time being, is anyone else sick of all the radio stations playing Christmas songs already? I AM! =( I don't want to be sick of Christmas! Ugh - anyhoo! 
~****What movies are out in the theatre that you want to see???****~ 
I want to see Finding Neverland, Bridget Jones Diary 2, The Polar Express, The Incredibles, Oceans 12(when it comes out), and a couple of others...if any of these are on your list - call me up! Let's go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","So I haven't updated in a while, but it's been kinda busy over here in my life. Sometimes good, sometimes bad...

So it's show week for me...yep, I'm going to be in a show, a modern show. Crazy, I know! On Friday and Saturday, and then on Saturday evening I'm going to see...that's right The American Ballet Theatre at Bass Concert Hall!!!!! I can not even begin to tell yall how excited I am! AHHHH! Anyhoo...show week, ABT in Austin, substitute meeting on Wednesday at 1 oclock in the fricken afternoon. Geez. Could they pick a worse time?? Whatever, I need to do it, so I'll do it

Last night was...um not the best night in the world. Found out that someone in our class from high school died in a car crash, and a lot of people I know were really upset. I didn't really know the guy, but for all his friends and family, you're in my prayers. The AMA's pissed me off because all the people that should have won didn't, except Usher and Alicia Keys (I think somethin is going on with them) but yeah...very disappointing. Val and I had a heart to heart about family, death, God, and life...that was nice. Emotional, but it's good to get things out and to have someone listen. Good times. 

I really really like this song...Jimmy Eat World, fantastic stuff!

There's no one in town I know
You gave us some place to go
I never said thank you for that
I thought I might get
One more chance
What would you
Think of me now
So lucky, so strong, so proud?
I never said thank you for that
now I'll never have a chance
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads
The sleepless go
May angels lead you in
So what would you
Think of me now
So lucky, so strong, so proud?
I never said thank you for that
now I'll never have a chance
May angels lead you in 
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads
The sleepless go
May angels lead you in
May angels lead you in
May angels lead you in
And if you were
With me tonight
I'd sing to you just
One more time
A song for a heart so big
god wouldn't let it live
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads
The sleepless go
May angels lead you in
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads
The sleepless go
May angels lead you in
May angels lead you in

Let people know how you feel about them because you never know when they will be gone...love to all my friends! I know I say my life is hard, but I'm so fortunate. Thank you to all who have/will impact my life.

"event","So this past weekend, was FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!

Friday night was fun filled. I stayed home and made a great wedding cd for the bride and groom, goooood stuff. Then I went to hang out with Annalisa, Elena and Cuong, afterwards picking Will up and taking him home. Got to studying for a bit, and then I was zonked out!

Woke up early on Saturday, ready for the day! =) Annalisa called and said her mom might need help with the bouquets, so I called her up and left a message. About 11:30 she called me, and I headed over there to help out...her hair was soooo gorgeous! And I will say so did the bouquets when we were done! That lasted longer than expected and I raced home to pick up my brother and all my wedding crap and left. Got to the church where everyone was actually quite calm. I went with Laurie and the bride to the bride room to change, and that's when everything just fell together perfectly. I saw Samantha!! I have not seen her in what feels like forever! That was nice, and she looked pretty as always. Annalisa and Elena, could not have been prettier - they were glowing! But no one was glowing as much as the bride. She was so cute. The ceremony was short and sweet, and was perfect. So that was over, went and served delicious cake...YUM! (My cake was the better cake, triple chocolate, mmmm) And then off to change for the after dance parrrrrty! Country dancing is sooo much freaking fun! I need to do it more often. Tanner, Elena and Annalisa said really sweet speeches, and then we went to George Cook's house to hang out and play games. Everyone was really tired, so we ended up just throwin a few darts around, played pool, and blah blah blah. Then came home, and went to bed! Crashed out...whew. What a day! =)

Sunday rolled around and I had lunch with my grandma, mom, and brother at Jason's Deli. That was nice except our food didn't come out for a really long time, BUT we got free dessert - uhhh yeah for free Strawberry cheesecake!!! Then came home and drove back to San Marcos. Still trying to decide about schools...UT or TCU?!?! I don't know! BUT what a great weekend! It only made me want a wedding...who wants to marry me? OK! =D (Annalisa, don't forget that dream! =D )

Erika Nicole Taylor, it looks like Thanksgiving break is the only time Mrs. Light can get together...do I need to come get you, or what? Call me girl! Love you!

Thanks for reading guys!!!!! :)

"event","Hey everyone! I haven't updated in awhile, so I guess I'll just fill ya in on what's been goin on. =)

I've been looking into other schools, because if I really want to pursue a career in dance, this school isn't for me. SO, here are my choices so far...TCU, because they have a kick butt dance program and it's still in TX which my parents like, a dance conservatory in New York which my friend from my old studio is now attending, or another option is to go to UT, and be close to my old studio to take challenging classes. I don't know what I'm going to do...I guess time will tell. If anyone has heard of another great or top notch dance school, please let me know. I would appreciate it alot! 

School is going well, got my 2nd math test score back, and did better than expected. Yay! And Im all set to go sub for Mrs. Light in January...finally a little money to my name! whoo hoo! Erika Nicole Taylor, girl...we need to get that care package ready for her(I have that coloring book, and nail polish), and she's suppose to be letting me know what's goin on in regards to when we can get together. So there's that, and I'm finding out when we can travel on those unforgettable roadtrips! So excited! =D

I guess that's it for now, and I have a new POLL!!! Answer please!!!!!!!!!!!!!
****What do you want to acheive in your life???**** True answers por favor! =)

"event","So Tuesday night...good times. Got out of my schedule making class at about 7ish...and high-tailed it to Austin to hang with the band directors and finally see Mr. Pruitt! Hooray! So I get to Pluckers, where they had choosen to eat. I had never been there before, it was gooood. We watched the Houston/St. Louis game and talked about TSU, or SWT as the 3 alumni knew it. 

Afterwards I said goodbye to Mr.Russell and Anna, and went to Mr. P's house to have some more Pruitt time! So I got there, and we were watchin the game and all of a sudden, Mr. Nicks calls the house! Holy crapoly! Talk about a Reunion night! I talked to him for awhile, and he's loving his new principal job, so that's good. Emily, Riley and Avery are all doing fine and growing well. And Nicole - you and I have to go take a few road trips...we'll talk later. One to Lamesa and the other to Gulf Shores, Alabama, just fyi. =) Talking to Mr. Pruitt is so awesome. Hes so understanding, and he actually listens. If you haven't guessed it already, he's one of my favorite people in the world. I admire his humor, knowledge, and just him. I admire him, and everything he's about. 

SO it got to be about 11:30, and the game was over so I decided to head back to San Marcos. I was so sad when we said goodbye. When he's here its like he hasn't been gone, but he is and Im sure a lot of people like me, miss him as well...Mr.Nicks too. Golly gee wiz - am I a complete dufuss for feeling like this? Oh well if I am...I miss them! And now I have to get back to studying - blegh. Adios people.

****NEW POLL! - What is your favorite television show??? What can't you live without watching?? =)

"event","There are not many things that I rant about, so this one will be the first of my rantings. I'm a pretty tolerable person, I think, and many of my friends and family would agree. But something happened this weekend that really really irked me. As most of yall know, I'm voting for Kerry in the upcoming election, and my parents are as well. We got a Kerry/Edwards sign to put in the front yard, and it's been there for quite a few weeks. Well, there has been a recent sign skank in the neighborhood who insists on taking all of the Kerry/Edwards signs on our street, and just around in general. Now, I thought that everyone had the freedom of speech, but maybe that's just me...ANYHOO. I thought it was an extremely immature, stupid thing to do, and I hate people that do stupid crap like that. Seriously...who would waste time to take things of other peoples. If you have ever done that, or you actually took my sign cuz you thought it'd be funny - yeah it wasn't, and I really don't appreciate it. You don't see democrats going around and taking all of the republican signs, but I guess that's the difference. Democrats have confidence in who they believe in...whatever. Grrrrrrrr, if I found out who did it, you're goin down, just like the person you're backing.

"event","OH MY GOODNESS PEOPLE! Seriously...Friday was one of the best nights...in the entire world(as Chandler would say...) =) Val and I left San Marcos right after our test, and came to my house to get ready. We left the house at 3:15 thinkin, oh we'll be there at about 3:40ish and get a great line place. WRONG! There was crazy bad traffic, therefore after going through a detour and finally parking we got into the line at about...oh 4:30. Still not bad, but not when we wanted to arrive. Anyhoo...so we make friends with the ladies behind us for the next 3ish hours, and finally are let in to the ampitheater. OMG! My feet were KILLING me! Not even funny...it was bad. And the concert wasn't going to start for another oh hour, and there was absolutly NO ROOM to move. I felt like a sardine. I know this doesn't sound like a great thing, but the payoff was later...let me tell ya. ;) An hour finally passed with a few fights starting all around us to get closer and closer to the stage, and the opening act finally came out. I can't remember the girl's name, but she could sing. Man could she sing...serious lung power. THEN he came out, black tshirt and tight jeans...I died and went to heaven! KEITH URBAN IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST SINGERS IN THE WORLD! And he is NOT fake Austrailian, contrary to some people's beliefs. It was amazing...and we were so close! HOPEFULLY my pictures will show how close we really were! He is so amazing not only as a singer, but as a musician...he played acoustic and electric guitar, keyboards, and aaaa banjo I believe. FRICKEN FANTASTIC! I think I went through every emotion possible while listening to him, and not many people can do that. I was in awe. Valerie I owe you big time, thanks for taking me!!!! :) Anyhoooooooo went to a party afterwards, and Brentwood again. Good times right there... =)

That's all for tonight. I hope everyone had a great weekend!!! Mr. Pruitt's coming in tomorrow!!! HOORAY!!!! =D

Erika Nicole Taylor...I miss you!!! Thanksgiving...it's on, you're stayin with me...if you're comin down! :) Cranium and Taboo nights...can't wait!

"event","So it alllll begins on Friday. Friday morning I wake up to my roomie saying that she's lost or someone stole all her indentification, which totally sucks. And then I had to go to class, more bootie. Blegh. But then we went to Political Science, and we had a speaker. His name was Patrick Rose, and he was fricken cute! All the girls stopped everything and paid attention, it was great. Then off to Austin I go...vroom, vroom. I got home and just hung out, laid around and what not. Then my parents got home and they were supposed to leave for San Antonio, but my brother never showed up, so my mom freaked. She didn't know where he was, and she was going billistic! No bueno, let me tell ya...then my brother called around 6, and everything was ok, but my mom was extremely pissed off. It was kinda scary, because you always think ""ok, nothins gonna happen,"" but then theres always that ""what if?"" Anyhoo...then my brother and I went to the football game, and it was well...boring. We won 60-0, and the band's performance was not the best, but that's ok because I still got to see everyone! Kristin, Audrey, Ginger, Ashley, Mary and all the directors...I love you and miss you all!!! Mr. P offered me a job for the holiday season...so takin that one! After the game I had Jennifer time!! YAY!! =) We watched Saved! and made smores in her room and ate pizza...good times right there! Then I got to drive her new car home...soooo happy!

Then there was Saturday...woke up early, and then went shopping for a dress for the wedding! And found one! Its a dark plum color with light pink, lavender, darker pink and black polka dots...sooo cute! While shopping saw the connally band walkin around, lol that was fun. Then went to Westlake for the entire day. Connally came in 6th in finals, but thats ok! They did a better finals show and thats all that matters! =) It took FOREVER to get out of there, and my forever I mean 47 minutes...yeah. Afterwards went home, and then didn't want to be there alone that I drove around and then went to Brentwood...my getaway. Met someone, and we talked and explored Brentwood for a longgggg time, and finally left in the early mornin'. 

Sunday came along and off to church I went! Then went to the ol' Taco Cabana with Annalisa and Cuong. THEN I went home because I had one of my headaches again... :-/ I don't know what it is...maybe its my contacts, maybe its something else. I dont know; all I know is that it sucks getting headaches frequently! I want it to stop! :( Then my fantastic momma made me a homemade dinner! With chicken, mashed potatoes, salad and green beans. It was grrrrreat! Afterwards I packed all my stuff up and drove on down here, and now I just watched the Extreme Home Makeover. It was so amazing! This girl had an allergy to the sun, so they made their entire house UV protected...that show makes me cry everytime I watch. When the mom comes on and her face is covered with happy tears...makes ya wanna cry too, so usually I do. It also makes me think about all the things I take for granted and all the special things I have in life like great friends and family. This is getting long enough, so I'm going to go, but if you read this...YOU'RE AWESOME! =) 

So overall I had a great weekend!! Thanks to all who were a part of it!!!! =)

~Question...who knows how to get my journal entries over to the left so that we can all see the wonderful picture on the right AND get the cool icon pictures that Gabby, Nicole, Kristin and Audrey have?? If anyone knows...please tell me!! Muchos gracious =D~"

"event","So a few days ago, Val and I decided to go out on thursday night and get really dressed up since we hadn't felt like girly girls in a long time. Too much school=not caring about how you look... :-/ No time for that! ANyhoo, so we got a bunch of the girls and by girls I mean: Heidee, Val, me, Maurisa, Keum, Nikki, Angela, Haley, and Amanda(?) and we got all dressed up (Val and I did) and we went out to eat at IHOP. lol Soooo much fun! We had an awesome waitress, but then there was this weird creepy guy that was all over our table for no reason at all! Scared the crap out of us, so we got outta there asap! **By the way, Brian Wilcox...Congrats again on graduating from the fire academy! Thats so awesome!!! =)**

Before the IHOP outing however, Val and I went over to another friend's apartment(Tricia) and began watching Farenheit 9/11. That is some of the scariest, most horrible stuff I have ever seen. I really want to finish watching it, because I want to see the rest of everything that the movie said and contained. I know its a lot of propaganda, but a lot of the things they say is true, just put out of context, and that right there is scary...Very scary...anyhoo enough about that!

But tonight, a few of the girls are going to get dressed up and go out to eat...HOORAY!!!! So excited! =) And now I'm sitting here watching Full House, good times!!!

If anyone has any info on how to fix up my handy dandy lj, im me, or leave some here...it would be much appreciated! :)

"event","So today started out kinda shady...I had a History test. I know, goody! A History test, you lucky girl, you! :-/ Well I think I did well on the multiple choice, but the essay...blegh - that's all we'll say. So then Val and I went to HEB, and then Bahama Bucks because we thought that we deserved one for surviving our tests. 

So then we came home, or back to the dorm, and I put in my old NSYNC, Britney, JLo, Destiny's Child Mix. SO much fun! Makes me think about when we were in middle school and we went to the dances and ""danced"" all night. Good times! Anyhoo...I'm in a looking back in my years mood. I don't know why, maybe to see the new friends I've made, or the fantastic times I had in band...who knows. Does anyone else get those feelings sometimes? You just wanna go through a yearbook or somethin? Hmmm oh well...I guess I'll go now...I've talked enough. :-D But I know everyone loves listening to my babbling, ha ha, right! 

For those of you who don't know, I switched room mates! And I now have the coolest roomie ever! Her name is Val, and she went to Anderson...maybe some of yall know her, if not...I'll introduce :)

ADIOS!!!!!!!!"

"event","So my new thing is sitting down on Tuesday and watching Gilmore Girls!, One Tree Hill, and the of course Real World. Exciting times I know! So I was soooo happy with Gilmore Girls, except for the ending...why did Dean let Rory back in? Seriously...what's going to happen? I don't like the looks of that! BUT Lorelai and Luke are going to be together for a long time, maybe forever, and that makes me so incredibly happy! YAY! That piece of newpaper that he kept for 8 years, oh my gosh! I was about to keel over!! So adorable! Anyhoo...anyone who watched Gilmore Girls give me your input as to what you thought of it, because I throughly enjoyed it. :)

Back to studying I go...blegh!"

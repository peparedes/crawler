I didn't do anything fun.
What the hell was that all about?
And Amy, I missed you. Stop going to visit your grandpa, damnit. You need to be back in seattle, kissing and cuddling me. I miss your sex. >.< tee hee.
I'm out,
Olive"

"event","So I just got a new kitten yesterday
Her name is Hazel (due to her hazel eyes) and her coat is all white, except for her orange ears and brown spotted tail. She's so adorable.
Last night she slept in my bed.
I can't wait to show zoe :)
Zoe, I'll call you when I get home from school 
I've got to go get ready now though.
Bye Everyone, Have an excellent day :)"

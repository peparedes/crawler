"event","as you can see, i was able to transfer (and back date!)&nbsp;all of my entries from my other blog to here, which is nice.&nbsp; so now all of my thoughts and such are conveniently located at one place.

also, i have started a REAL paper journal.&nbsp; i don't post in it as much, but that way, will have something in the way of a journal if the internet one day explodes.&nbsp; then i will have something to show the grandkids.


there isn't much going on.. this summer seems to be going by fast yet slow.&nbsp; which i cannot explain.&nbsp; i leave for england in just over 4 weeks, which is so crazy to me.&nbsp; and then once we are back, there will only be a few weeks of summer left.

i've really been getting into my routine here.&nbsp; making sure to spend as many nights in, hanging out with georgia as i do out, spending time with my human friends.&nbsp; i can't get over how much i feel i've grown since may1st.&nbsp; it really is remarkable.


spending most of the day out in the sun has me a little sunbunrnt and overly tired, but i have thoroughly enjoyed my first weekend not working at all!&nbsp; it will be strange having sundays back to myself and not driving to NJ to teach sunday school. but once i get bored of sleeping in on sundays, i am eager to find a church in rockland.

i finished reading &quot;indecision&quot; (by benjamin kunkel) at the park today.&nbsp; since i haven't really had any human interaction since finishing it, i'm still at the point where you silently ruminate on what the book has taught you or how it's changed you.&nbsp; really, an enjoyable feeling.&nbsp; and a perfect book for me to have read at this stage of my life.


not much more to say (i'm rambling anyway)

until next time."

"event","ahem.

yes, you&#39;re reading this right.&nbsp; this IS casey posting.&nbsp; for the first time in 4 years. but anyways, i figured it&#39;s about time.&nbsp; i also blog over at blogger, but only know a handful of people&nbsp; on there so it kinda takes some of the fun out of blogging.&nbsp; but i digress.

as you may or may not know, my boyfriend of 6 years, Ryan, left a month and a half ago to live in Germany for 100 days.&nbsp; he&#39;s taking German classes there in preparation for starting his pHd in a couple years and will need to have German and French under his belt.&nbsp; [this may mean living in France at some point... if that is the case, he is NOT&nbsp;leaving me behind!] but as you can imagine, after 6 years, i&#39;ve grown so comfortable in every aspect of our relationship.&nbsp; i stopped, for the most part, making plans to hang out with people, because i knew Ryan would make the plans. and that is one tiny example.&nbsp; i rely on him for so much, and lacking a female best friend, poor Ryan gets to be the boyfriend and the best girlfriend all in one.&nbsp; which sometimes, i think he enjoys, and most of the time, i think it stresses him out.

when i first heard he was going away for a couple months, i of course, supported him.&nbsp; but my first concern was &quot;who is going to help me take care of our dog?&quot; the answer i later learned was some of our awesome friends, family and neighbors. aside from that, i had no reason to not let him go.&nbsp; i am not the kind of girlfriend that would ever stop him from taking an awesome opportunity. plus, i knew that while he was off learning German and drinking good beer and eating bratwurst and of course making his way and finding himself, i&#39;d be doing the same here, sans bratwurst.

ryan left may 1st and i feel like i have changed so much, in the best way, while he&#39;s been gone.&nbsp; i&#39;ve actually had to step out of my comfort zone and be proactive about making plans and hanging out with others, become more dominant and assertive with our dog, Georgia, so she doesn&#39;t have me wrapped around her little paw all summer, and deal with only getting to skype/IM/email with ryan.&nbsp; and it has all been wonderful!&nbsp; not to say it hasn&#39;t been lonely at times or difficult when the dog is having a naughty couple of days.&nbsp; but i still can&#39;t believe this is me. 

yesterday, i even chopped off inches off my hair and got a very uncharacteriscally me haircut (see facebook pictures) after 7 or so years of refusing to cut more than just the edges off my hair. (i had become so attached to my hair after years of damaging it by swimming competively and lifeguarding 40hr a week in the bright summer sun) silly as this sounds, it was such a step for me.



all this also feeds into my new-found viewpoint of what living in your 20s should be like. 

every time i meet someone over the age of 30, they tell me, in detail, how much they loved being in their 20s.&nbsp; i always respond with &quot;why? it&#39;s that awkward stage between graduating from college and not being married or having your own family and still not being recognized as a functioning and contributing member of this society?&quot;&nbsp; and this 30+ year old, always laughs and says how someday, i will look back and wish i could be 26 again.

so, in an effort to make the most of my 20s and start doing things worth telling stories about to the future grandkids, i started saying &quot;yes&quot; to things i wouldn&#39;t normally say &quot;yes&quot; to.&nbsp; because i am positive that these are the things 30+ year olds loved about their 20s.

-perform with my bellydance class after only dancing for a year? yes! (october)
-sit front row at an all-girl roller derby? yes!&nbsp; (july)
-take a class where you learn to forage through the woods and subsequently, how to cook with your findings? yes! (june)
-take an improv class after not having performed like that in 7 years? yes! (in the works with kaylan)
-go to a hairdresser and let them chop off as much of your hair as they want? yes!

etc. etc, etc, 

these may not seem like crazy things to do, but when people ask me how *i* spent my 20s, i want to have more to say than just laying on my couch, watching &quot;Scrubs&quot; reruns with my dog.

now, i can say that i:
-lived on my own
-learned to make kick-ass oatmeal chocolate cookies
-adopted a rescued pit bull
-got to drink lots of good beer (and margaritas and sangrias) with good friends
-went to see all of my favorite bands/artists play live (slowly whittling down the list)
-survived with my boyfriend living in a foreign country
-let go of some (if not most)&nbsp;of my insecurities
-known what it&#39;s like to have a handful of spectacular friends and a supportive (and crazy!) family
-stopped being afraid of being alone
-became a better version of me

and i&#39;m sure i can keep adding to the list. 

but damn, if i don&#39;t feel free.&nbsp; and happy.&nbsp; and loved.&nbsp; and..."

"event","i'm a big fan of tradition. i love doing things with people and knowing it'll happen again. i like having traditions and making traditions... because i feel like these are the stories you tell later on in life. i mean, one could go to the diner every week... but to always go on a tuesday, makes it a tuesday diner tradition.<br /><br />so anyways, one tradition i've had for the past few years involves ryan's sister, erin, who is 8 years my junior. and age aside, erin is awesome. her and i get along so well and always have fun together. my tradition with erin is that every year, during labor day weekend, we spend the day together. it doesn't so much matter what we do, although every year involves sunbathing, eating and movie watching, but it matters more that we do it. during the year we're both so busy and it just so happens that at the end of every summer, we know we'll make a day for each other. and this year, she was old enough to drive to me... which is kind of crazy. but let me tell you about our day.<br /><br />we spent an hour up on my roof sunbathing, we pretend we're at the beach and lay out as long as we can handle the heat. which is never more than an hour. we came inside and made guacamole, that ended up wayyy too salty. we tried to even it out by adding sugar, but that hardly fixed it, which didn't stop us from eating a lot of guacamole. we also made a taco pie (not from my own recipe, but from the bisquick box). then, the next aspect, movie watching. we opted for &quot;john tucker must die&quot; and we ate so much food that we couldn't really move without groaning. so we took georgia out and walked to distract ryan from his work for a few minutes. once back, we realized we had just enough time for another movie before the &quot;gossip girl&quot; season premiere, so we watched one of my favorites, &quot;the baxter&quot; and erin really liked it too. and then finally, it was time for &quot;gossip girl&quot; and our stomachs were ready for ice cream sundaes. after the show, i walked erin to her car and she drove home. and thus ended the casey and erin labor day weekend tradition.<br /><br /><br />next year, we'll have to move our tradition to a different day, because she'll be going off to college. but like i said, it doesn't matter what you do, or when you do it... just that you do it. and these are the stories i'll tell... like how in 2003's tradition, i spent the day all nervous because i really wanted to impress erin, who was 12 at the time, or how last year, i fell asleep halfway through our movie, and erin had to wake me up, or how this year we had to add sugar to the guacamole or how we realized the cheese we put throughout the taco pie was moldy. these are the stories we'll tell... and laugh about... and miss.<br /><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0pZ5LMHzmtY/SLyd9XoBocI/AAAAAAAAEE4/u4YHols1Ia0/s1600-h/peedgoes+052.jpg"" onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}""><img border=""0"" id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5241237743991890370"" alt="""" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0pZ5LMHzmtY/SLyd9XoBocI/AAAAAAAAEE4/u4YHols1Ia0/s320/peedgoes+052.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;"" /></a>i don't know what it feels like to have a sister, but i think this is the closest i'll ever come to knowing."

"event","my original intent with this blog was to capture all my thoughts and feelings, good or bad, and lately, there's been all good. which is such a change to a couple months previous.

anywho... here's the update on mine and ryan's trip to mystic and the rest of the weekend since.

we left thursday night, with georgia in the care of alma and urban and arrived at the days inn around 9pm. we found a nearby pizza place and ordered a pie and ate it while watching &quot;how i met your mother&quot; with the hotel's free internet. glorious.

friday morning we slept in and then walked a half mile or so into town and had lunch at the friendly's. [i had forgotten how good the watermelon roll was.... mmmmmm] and then we trekked up the hill to the Mystic Aquarium/Institute for Exploration. we had intended on doing the penguin encounter and getting to actually touch the penguins, but the website failed to mention that it's an extra $80 per person to do so. so we opted to touch manta rays, crabs, starfish and hermit crabs (for free!) instead.

the aquarium was seriously awesome. we were surrounded by families with young kids and elderly couples but it was such a good time. soooo much to see. we saw a kickass sea lion show... and learned lots of cool sea lion facts, we tried to feed these australian birds in this enclosure, until we realized our chances of being pooped on were really great. so we got out. fast.

the penguins were great...awkward football-shaped creatures, with the big beaks and crazy eyes.
in the sea lion section, ry and i stayed for a long time watching 3 sea lions, one who just kept belching really loudly, one who was sleeping underwater and had to keep coming up to breathe, and another who had fallen asleep with its head on a giant rock. the sea lions reminded us so much of puppies. the aquarium also had this amazing titanic exhibit. and we got to see these huge beluga whales and this cool lit tank with jellyfish inside, with florescent lighting behind it. it really was a day i won't forget... and i know i won't for a while because i had chipped one of my teeth on some rock candy there. so that will be a constant reminder of our fun day at the aquarium... at least until my tooth smoothes out.

that night, we walked back to the hotel, watched some more &quot;how i met your mother&quot; and then walked back into town and saw &quot;vicky christina barcelona&quot; at this tiny movie theater. it made both ryan and i want to (1) visit spain for a while and (2) purchase and wear some flowy dress shirts. after dinner, we walked over to a pub and got burgers and crab cakes and i got to try a local beer, cottrell ale. pretty good... very similar to sam adams. then we drove back to the hotel and fell asleep.

saturday, we slept in a little and got free breakfast at the hotel and then went on a 2 mile hike through the woods. we made lots of pit stops, to have a picnic lunch by this tiny pond, to find walking sticks, to sit at the duck pond, to sit at this tree house in the woods made for bird watching and we also found these cages with owls, who can't make it in the wild, who are being taken care of by the nature group that owns the trail. it was such an unexpectedly nice day.

after our hike, you guessed it, more &quot;how i met your mother&quot; at the hotel and then we ate at this seafood restaurant. and we ate way too much food. and went to bed early.

we awoke sunday at 5:30 to check out at 6am to make it back to nyack to feed and walk georgia for 8am. ryan was such a trooper, he let me press snooze a couple times in the morning and then let me nap most of the drive back. after reuniting with georgia, we got breakfast at art cafe and then left for bedford hills, where one of ryan's favorite professors from the seminary was speaking.

dr. widbin did an incredible job. he's an amazing speaker and storyteller and the whole congregation was on the edge of their seats during this whole sermon.

after the service, dr. widbin's family invited us back to their house for lunch, where their daughter, who ryan knows from school, had cooked this egyptian feast. once we arrived, we all got to help with the meal and it was such a time of fellowship. we got to spend about 4 hours with the family, eating and swapping stories and it just felt that that's what sundays should be.


the weekend was exactly what we needed... lots of relaxing and eating and walking around. and buying a pound or so of fudge helped too. it was our best vacation yet. (of the 3 we've taken... ha)

so, after my awesome weekend, i went in to work today in such a good mood. me, and my co-worker and manager were laughing and joking all day. it hardly felt like a monday.


and i guess that's all i can hope for, unexpectedly good times spent with those i love... it makes all the difference. and all it took was a hike, an aquarium, friends to step up to take care of georgia, a moving sermon and a shared meal... and i'll be reeling all week."

and i know tonight, i will go to bed before i get the urge to watch any more &quot;gossip girl&quot;.

and tomorrow, i only have to work a few hours and then i get to see ryan's sister, erin, to wish her a happy birthday and then i get to shop for snacks for our trip and quickly pack and then ryan and i are gone! friends of ours were able to take care of georgia for the few days we'll be gone, so we can really enjoy being away and won't be fretting (too much) about georgia.

in mystic, we'll get to go to the aquarium and touch penguins and baby beluga whales! and go swimming, and to walk around the town, and scam free internet from our hotel to watch &quot;how i met your mother&quot; at night. and neither of us will have to wake up early for days!


some days, it just feels like things are so right that whatever negative things are in your way, they don't seem to matter too much. and today is one of those days."

today, i was thinking how a couple posts ago, i talked about how my livejournal from 2003-2005 was so neat, full of thought-provoking entries and me baring my soul. and i think one of the reasons it was such a good journal was because i knew my friends were reading it, because there were always so many comments, but i never held back and just said what i wanted to.

[at least i got a cute guy to dance with]<br /><br />( + ) in all the time i was gone, i missed work a lot. which i guess means i really do love my job. i couldn't wait to see my co-workers and all of our customers again. and a lot of our customers missed me too, which is a really nice feeling.<br /><br />( + ) it sounds cheesy, but things with ryan seem perfect right now.  we're loving each other and letting love take over.<br /><br />( + ) amy threw this awesome pre-&quot;Batman&quot;, mexican food themed BBQ last night. with awesome chili and guacamole and desserts and all. it was so great just to be eating with friends and just spending time together, before our midnight &quot;Batman&quot; show. which was fun, but all day i felt like i was hit by a train. 4 hours of sleep isn't quite enough for me... in fact, 8 hours is barely enough for me anymore. but i digress...<br /><br />( - ) which brings us to today. feeling like a train wreck and on my way to work just before 8am, i hear my car making this awful scraping sound, like i drove over a tree branch or something. i pull the car into ryan's driveway and see that i wasn't dragging a tree branch, but my own front bumper. while i was eating guac and watching &quot;Batman&quot;, some jerk tried to park in front of me and hit my car on the front left so hard that it knocked the bumper off. and did damage to the fender, driver's side door and who knows what else. and since it was a hit and run, it's coming out of my auto insurance deductible. $500 i have to spend all because some jerk drove into my car and couldn't fess up. it makes me sad to think one could do that much damage to someone else's car, and drive off.<br /><br />i was so mopey all day, partly from being tired and partly from stress about my car. but that's where my loved ones come in. ryan calmed me down and lent me his car for the weekend and offered to drive me to NJ to get my grandma's car to borrow. my dad calmed me down on the phone and helped remotely. chris evans offered his advice, bungee cords, manliness and general car knowledge. and everyone else offered me hugs and laughter.<br /><br />and slowly, my night started to perk up. i got to hang out at the art cafe and be silly with a lot of people who i love very much, but don't get to see too often.<br /><br />and it was as easy as that.  my ( - ) ended up as a ( + ).<br /><br /><br /><br />and maybe that's what life is. God throws lots of tiny little things at us. both to test us, to see what we can handle, and to remind us that He's in charge and taking care of us. even in ways we didn't know we needed Him.<br /><br /><br />and that's what life's felt like lately. lots of tiny (sucky) distractions and wrenches in my plans, and there's God, making sure i'm still listening. and i am. and He's nudging me and putting great people in my life. and i couldn't be more thankful."

"event","it's nothing more than happenstance that i got bored of reading one of my books while on the beach and turned to an old favorite &quot;the perks of being a wallflower&quot;. i say this because the book talks so heavily of not being a wallflower and not sitting back and watching others enjoy life... but participating. and that's what i tried to do this week.. and i think i succeeded.

going away with my family is never really all that relaxing as my mother and i butt heads, so her and i often tap dance around each other, trying to avoid major arguments. it usually makes for a non-relaxing time as i'm over-thinking everything i want to say and do.

but, somehow, in my 4 days at the beach, things were very mind-clearing and as relaxing as things can be. and i felt like i belonged with my family, which isn't always the case.

saturday started out with darin riding shotgun in my car. we chatted the entire way when we weren't busy singing along to coheed and cambria, postal service, rage against the machine etc. all music that he grew up on, but sort of grew out of during middle school. i had missed darin's company, and all it took was being captive in a car on the garden state parkway and some good music.

sunday, i got to spend the day with jason, my best friend from childhood. we hadn't seen each other in 4 years and it was so nice to laugh and reminisce with him. i had forgotten how much i missed being with him, since our relationship has come to yearly birthday phone calls and random facebook posts and text messages.

the first part of the week, i spent a lot of time alone and with my parents as all my brothers either had plans with friends or were not down yet. so i got much reading, sunning, swimming, eating, and sleeping done. and of course, i caught up on the food network and rob &amp; big. i watched 7 hours of tv in one day.

and then on my second to last day, i got to do lots of silly and fun things. like bumper cars with my dad and all my brothers and their friends, silly rides on the boardwalk, a riveting game of &quot;boardwalk bingo&quot; with shane, watching the awesome boardwalk magician, non-stop card games with darin and brett and his girlfriend, good talks with alyssa (brett's girlfriend) and finally, the annual keepers kids tradition of a trip to captain hook's bar for cheap beer and ping pong/air hockey. it was so nice to feel so connected with my brothers and family that day. i just can't even explain it. and on our walk back home from captain hooks, we even saw a shooting star, as corey schooled us in an alcohol-induced lesson on astronomy. and as charlie from &quot;wallflower&quot; puts it... we just felt infinite. and all it took was a deck of cards, bumper cars, sun and 2 pitchers of beer.

things might always be rocky with my family. but it's good to know that i can still somehow relax in a few days spent at the shore. and all it took, was for me to participate. [and to add in music, card tricks, beer and bumper cars.] but alas. i'm living life... participating, or at least, i'm trying to. and things might not be so bad.

i'm a little sad i'm going to miss on 4 more days of sun, sand, pina coladas and laughter... but i'll take what i can get."

"event","do you ever have those moments where you just want to freeze them?

where you're offered a couple moments of perfection... and it seems all the better because it was unexpected.


i had no idea that the rain was pouring down, but i was running (literally) across the street to bring Ryan dinner at his job. in seconds, my tank top and jeans were soaked through.

obviously there was no one at the cafe during the storm so ryan and i went to go eat in the back room. now the library (next door to the cafe) is under construction, and today's workers left the site leaving the metal sheets of the future roof exposed. the rain pouring down made the coolest noise on the metal, so we decided to go watch the storm from the porch.


there we were, outside, but safe and dry under the porch, listening to the rain beat against the metal and watching for lightening and listening for thunder. we might have been the only ones &quot;outside&quot;, so it was like we got to experience it alone together. poor ryan was soaked himself after a couple minutes of hugging me. and in that moment, life felt perfect. we felt perfect. 


i kept squeezing my eyes shut, taking mental pictures so that i will never forget this; the sound of the rain on metal, the storm descending on the park, ryan's smile, the cool breeze, being the only ones with front-row seats to the storm, how close we felt in those moments.

that storm was for us.  and in the moments out there, we found our love and our peace."

Georgia pranced around on her little 6 foot leash (we've since had to buy a new leash so that Ryan and I don't end up swimming with her) she was soooo cute. but every time a little wave came or she ended up deeper than she thought, she'd run at top speed and try to jump over the rocks, back onto land. which usually resulted in me or Ryan almost going in with her. it was seriously so cute.<br /><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0pZ5LMHzmtY/SEswiVpeh_I/AAAAAAAAEEg/Y1xG1OTumlM/s1600-h/DSCF8125.JPG"" onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}""><img border=""0"" id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5209310760468908018"" alt="""" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0pZ5LMHzmtY/SEswiVpeh_I/AAAAAAAAEEg/Y1xG1OTumlM/s320/DSCF8125.JPG"" style=""margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;"" /></a>so today was Georgia's first swim on her 16 foot retractable leash and it was a bit scary. i figured i'd sit on a rock and just let her swim around, but the second she went in a little deep, she jumped out, and pulled me off my rock and onto the ground... with 2 men watching right behind me.<br /><br />so i figured it would be smarter to take her where the boats launch, less of a chance of her pulling me off rocks.... but what i hadn't counted on, was how much more speed she can pick up without rocks hindering her. man, is she fast!<br /><br />she started swimming 10 or so feet away from me so i kept letting her leash go, not thinking she'd run at full speed towards me... and then 10 feet away from me, all while covered in mud and Hudson water. with a park full of people watching.<br /><br />needless to say, we both needed a nap and a bath after today's swimming attempt.<br /><br />and until she learns not to spaz out, we should probably swim with her in a lake or something. and maybe Georgia swimming, in open water at least, is a 2 chaperone job."

lifeguard and swim instructor at the CGCP.

there were many reasons why this job was awesome, for example. i was able to take the lifeguard training course at age 15.5 and was able to start work once i passed the test (not an easy feat, but i'll come back to that later) my first summer as a rookie guard, i got a decent hourly rate and got to work with cool older people. and since there weren't many rookies, the few of us got a lot of hours.

we got paid to literally sit in the sun and tan for 4 out of the 8 hours. now as for the other 4 hours, they were spent schmoozing in the guard room, listening to music through our crappy radio, playing day-long Risk tournaments, eating pixie sticks and chocolate eclair ice cream bars and pretending to do our summer homework.

by the time 8pm rolled around, you were so exhausted from sun exposure that you had little energy to hang out with anyone else... so everyone went home and showered and met at dunkin donuts or starbucks or the movies with wet hair.

no matter who worked with who, or who had break with you, fun was always had. especially if you shared a break with Tim Donlon, Jason, Katie B or Age.


did i mention we got paid even if it rained?? :)

now here are some of the downsides:

-there is no tan more publicly embarrassing than the lifeguard tan. from getting tan in a high cut speedo and mesh shorts. you ended up with sunburned knees, white stomach, dark shoulders and face. which translates into total embarrassment at the beach.

-parched hair. teaching lessons for 3 hours and then working out in the sun for 8 hours without having washed your hair, turned hair this white/yellow blond color... that looked great once your roots grew in come september...

-the test! having to take the entire class, while swimming in sweatpants and a sweatshirt. swimming 20 laps with a brick, and having to swim 2 laps in under 30 seconds. so friggin hard!
and then the physical and written test had to be re-taken every 3 years.

-having to blow your whistle at annoying pre-teen boys whose mother left them at the pool alone.


and i'm sure i could keep adding to the list on both sides.

summers felt so long when you worked 40hr weeks in the sun... and it was sad when labor day rolled around as we had to go back to our non-seasonal jobs.

the cgcp officially opened this weekend. and i almost miss being there. i miss getting your new shirt and shorts and whistle, and finding out who the new head guard was, and teasing the rookies, and the guard parties, and the swim team bake sales, and of course, how amazing 8pm felt. it's a good thing my certification runs out this year or i'd be tempted to work a day or two... but only with the old staff...


so here's to the mothers in their scantily clad bikinis, getting stuck working at baby pool during adult swim, 10 cent ice waters from the snack bar, for fighting over who's going to make the &quot;closing&quot; and &quot;adult swim&quot; announcements, to writing &quot;KC 4 KTB on 8/18&quot; on the calendar... and understanding what that meant, to only having to work 4 hours out of an 8 hour shift, to being in the sun and getting paid to laugh with friends.

here's to the good ol' days at cgcp.  and to another summer spend working indoors for me..."

"event","i can't pull of heels.

last time i tried, it was for prom, and my mother told me that i walked like robin williams' character from &quot;the birdcage&quot;. so we returned those shoes, got flats instead and i never looked back.

until last week, that is.

at marshalls, while trolling for cheap dress shoes for work, i came across the cutest pair of heels (geez i sound like a girl!) the heel isn't that high and i can actually walk in them. so i bought them. i mean, 25's a good age to start wearing grown-up shoes, right?!


so this morning i decide i'm going to wear them to work. &quot;you can do it!&quot; i told myself. and as i'm practicing walking around my apartment, i slipped and skidded on the hardwood floors in my new heels. but did i let that stop me? no!!

i stubbornly walked down the stairs, to my car and drove to work, with much success i might add.

once i got to work, i felt so important. clop clop clop! i sounded like my teachers in the elementary school hallway. clop clop clop! i can walk across carpet and tile and even grass and sidewalk. clop clop clop!

i kept them on all day. i was so proud of myself. i felt very important. and womanly. and i hardly walked like robin williams. clop clop clop!


4pm comes along and i'm walking towards home and after 8 hours of my feet being in my cute little heels, with gravity forcing all my toes to the front of my shoes and bumping my poor pinkie toes... i decide that i can be just as womanly in my flip flops. right?!

i'll give me toes a few days to spread themselves back out and i'll try my heels again next week.

flip flop.  flip flop."

"event","lately, i've been obsessively cleaning my room and apartment and getting rid of (with peer pressuring from urban and ryan) a lot of needless crap that i keep around. 

certain things i've been donating to charity, other things i'm giving away to friends and some stuff is worthless and is just getting thrown out. although i hate the thought of landfilling stuff.


so tonight, on my way out to the higgins' for dinner, i left an old wallet of mine outside by the garbage - free for the taking! i emptied it out (or so i thought) and headed to new city for a wonderful home cooked meal with my favorite family ever.

i come back to nyack and sneak a nice close parking spot, and pleased with myself, walk home and in my haste, step over some wallet size pictures. &quot;probably from someone's wallet&quot; i think. it wasn't until i saw a picture of my brother, shane, on the ground that i realized &quot;crap! i never fully cleaned out my wallet!&quot;

even though it was my own dumb mistake... i got so mad that someone would carelessly leave pictures on the ground like that, and not even put them in the garbage or anything. i can't explain why it ticks me off...

i immediately recognized them as contents from my own wallet and began picking them up, with the help of a nearby lady.

and good thing... because there were some nice pictures in there. of ryan and i, friends, my family, and baby pictures of myself (that even had my full name on them) eeek! talk about identidy theft...

i just hope that if i ever see someone using a denim wallet with a palm tree on it that i don't give 'em dirty looks for scattering my memories across south broadway..."

"event","some days just feel perfect...


about a week ago, ryan told me that he liked the way i wrote, and that i should write more. i smiled, and said &quot;really?&quot; because the extent of my writing anymore is just comments to people's facebook walls and last minute post-it notes to my roommate.

but he said he liked the cadence and the way that i write and that i should get a blog. and since i take everything that ryan says way too seriously.... i made a blog. and just a blog. and even if no one else reads it... i'm still getting my thoughts and feelings out there. so here goes.



ahem. 
the past couple months have been a roller coaster. i feel like things in my life are going either really well or really bad. there is no in-between. and so that's how i've been - super happy, or super down on myself or down about life.

but, the past couple weeks, some things have happened and i will document them here on my maiden voyage here on blogspot.. in hopes that when life seems to get the best of me, i can look back at my first entry and think &quot;life ain't so bad&quot;.



this past month i've felt more alone than ever before. natalie flying back home to england made me realize just how good of friends we were and just how much i missed having a positive, wonderful person in my life. which, upon discussing with ryan, i haven't really had since college. and as happy as i am to have known natalie and to have her in my life so much... i'm really struggling with feeling alone since she's left. and only in the past 2 weeks or so have i tried to figure out why i've been separating myself from people and why i won't let myself get as close to others as i (accidently) got close to natalie...


the past couple weeks, i feel like God is testing me and slowly taking care of me. and it's not in my timing, at all, of course, but His.

recently i discovered that my parents had a CD account for me that was about to mature. it had just over $4,000. and although that's not an incredibly large amount of money (especially as a banker, since i know how loaded i know people in this area are...) it is more than enough for me to pay off the various debts i had in my life. rent. car payment (completely paid down to zero! and 3 months early) cell phone, friends i owed money to, layaway at my old job... etc. and i finally have enough money to get my tooth pulled and even some extra to go to the doctor as well. and still have some leftover to save. and i know money doesn't buy happiness, but it sure as heck helps since i've been getting back on my feet financially.

i've been making it a point to cook or bake a couple times a week. and as my friend amy pointed out, it's funny that now us, as twenty-somethings, have to come home from work to cook and clean and turn into semi-adults. when i'm in my domesticasey mode... i feel accomplished and so adult and happy. and i'm going to make it a point to cook for friends and neighbors at least once a week.

and basically the best thing of all... is ryan. him and i have been working through some pretty crazy stuff lately. but that smile on his face when we see each other cancels out all the other crap that's going on. 

next month it'll be 5 years for us. that's like 5x the longest relationship i've ever been in. and as cliche as it sounds, we're way more in love now than we were 5 years ago. he's the most beautiful person i've ever known.


so... driving home from work today, in the glorious, almost-spring weather, eager to get home to my ryan and my georgia, windows down and blasting the new cd that urban burned for me... not having to worry about money (or at least for this month...) ... life really just felt perfect.


the end."

<i>To whom this may concern:

I am in class. The state of Connecticut says that you should be more open minded and that maybe the state of Connecticut hates you. I slapped her. CT went down and hard. It was a dark day for the state, but a bright beginning for the state of women, for as you know women, until recently opposed, are not really real people, yet figments of their own imaginations combined with the effects of a lunar eclipse of one of the many moons of Venus. It's simple mathematical equations. It's raining, it smells like a wet DJ in here. I hope it's not me. Probably Rebecca. Rebecca is the girl next to me. Her real name is unknown, hence proving previous physiological beliefs stated....oh shit. She is reading this, now she is pissed. This is serious. She says she doesn't smell. She isn't looking anymore. Clear. Ok. She is a liar. It's her I know it. She is eating eggs in the computer lab. Such a typical post modernist thing to do. Fuck she saw it again. Now she is really mad. I think bodyslamming 101 is taking place in the room above. 

Forever and Always. The one, the only, the future
The DJ</i>

it continues as dj IM's me still is trying to not let rebecca see what he's writing.

"event","so here i am.  at my parents' house in jersey.  i've got to work tomorrow from 12ish-4ish guarding a private pool party in new york.  ironically enough, i can't sleep because my parents' house <i>isn't</i> my apartment, yet lately i've felt more at home here than i did ever before.

let me explain.

since i'm all graduated now and living in nyack most of the time, my parents thought a little bedroom switching was in order since i have one of the bigger bedrooms, and it's barely occupied.  so for the past few months, i've been slowly cleaning out the closet, taking pictures of the wall, and putting unneccessaries in the attic etc.  and as i'm doing so, i'm realizing that everythng i'm removing from the walls is such a huge part of my life, something that is so representative of a time and place that can never happen again.

example(s):  
-various collages referencing <i>empire records</i>, (a movie i fell in love with at age twelve and quoted religiously, thinking that it was the single greatest gift to american cinema.)
-pictures of old CGCP lifeguards and i, back before most of the drama and the bull crap, back when rainy days meant doodling pictures and trying to read a book or do homework, knowing that the only thing that would get accomplished was laughing all day instead.
-IM conversations and emails with all the PBCYG crew, some care cards and silly notes about who loves whom.
-photographs and greeting card upon greeting card from kristen, from age 10 up until now, proving time and time again the awesome bounds of our friendship.
-more photographs of jason mclaughlin and i, with our siblings when we were in elementary/middle school, acting like geeks at the south end playground.
-silly drawings, ramblings and photographs of mike kapura, reminding me of the carefree and powerful friendship we had.
-my bulletin board that houses magazine clippings, pictures, postcards and a movie ticket stub from every movie i saw from 6th grade until i started working at cinema 23 (and movies ""magically"" became free).

these are things that no one can take away from me.  and no matter how much i try to argue it, or say that growing up in cedar grove is crap, or try to blame my parents for something;   i had a pretty decent life.  i've gotten to be involved in local theater, swimming, the music business, writing contests, EMT school etc.  i have such amazing friends and a great boyfriend.  i've had so many awesome oppurtunities so far, and even with college under my belt, oppurtunities are still presenting themselves.   and it's cool to finally realize that, complain all i want, my life isn't half bad.



the walls of my bedroom are basically bare.  all that's left are a few framed posters and pictures and some christmas lights.  my dressers house a few more framed pictures; mostly of people who have been out of my life for some time, mike kapura, dave barth, keith ericson, peter coletto, daneal flohr and of course, a few pictures of the present; ryan, kristen and my brothers.

but every time i will leave this bedroom, for as long as it's mine, i'll be able to look in the mirror, stare at the empty walls, squish my toes into the semi-stained carpet, and remember everything i'm feeling now.

and sure, i've been making a life for myself in rockland county, with all my jobs, my friends and my new apartment, but it's nice to know i still have a home when i'm in jersey."

"event","i am moving into an apartment that is sweeter than life itself.

that's right, kids.  i've got the best apartment in nyack.  i'm living wth 3 other girls in a kick ass apartment right on broadway in nyack.  hardwood floors, a fireplace, brick walls, a bar and our own rooftop.

commence jealousness.

BUT, if you would care to help me move or come see my new place, let me know.

this summer:

may:
may8-may12 L.A. with COM dept. seniors
may16 graduation
may20-22 xABSx crew reunion

my final senior film is done.  now, i may redo some bad audio and make an outtakes reel.  but the fact of the matter is that i set out to make a short film by myself and did it.  and even turned the damn thing in early.  i rock.

supposedly, everything from here on out is easy.  warm weather, a few exams, L.A. with the COM seniors (in 31 days) and then graduation. 


i'm really enjoying living in downtown nyack.  yesterday i had such a ""nyack day"".  i slept through all my classes and met kristie for late lunch.  we grabbed sandwiches at the village market and then ate them at the park while a crazy lady in ugg boots fed the pigeons popcorn and spaghetti.  man, i hate those boots.  

at night, after work, kris and dave came to the Y and convinced me not to work out.  i obliged and we met up with amy and her dog, guiness.  we walked to planet wings for dinner and got temptations for dessert.  what a gorgeous freakin' day it was.

and today,  i was supposed to have 7 hours of class, but instead, i had an hour of class and ear training, and then saw sin city(again) in place of one of my classes.  and then got to spend time with ryan, eating bagel bites and ice cream, discussing our days.  (since we don't get to see each other as often as we'd like.)

and of course, who can forget.  kevin smith weekend; part deux:  the john cusack series, is in only 42 days.  everyone who's cool enough to be considered xABSx will be coming out to rockland county for a weekend long sleepover, watching john cusack movies and catching up.  could life get any better than this?!


still deciding what job(s) i want to work this summer.  i'll be away so damn much so who knows if it'll be worth it to start this new job @ playgarten.

may8-13 L.A
may20-22 kevin smith weekend, part deux
june28-july5 cancun w/ family and others
july10-17 ithaca mission trip
cape cod in july with hopkins?
august13-20 nj shore with family
august20th brendan's wedding in pittsburgh for a few days

so what if i'm not going to ireland this summer?  there's always next year.  and besides, just because i'm graduating in a few weeks with no freakin' clue what i want to do with my life, doesn't mean i'm not going to enjoy every minute of it.  living it up and soaking up all the experiences i can.  who knows what i'll be doing?  all i know is,  i'm going to enjoy it."

...but all i want to do is listen to regina spektor and watch the snow accumulate.

...or make myself a big dinner and read my book in the comfort of my bed.


but it's a great week.  tons of great new music at WNYK and both of my night classes are cancelled this week.  (and this snow might cancel more classes!) and the best part:  no teaching at the YMCA for 2 weeks...and not to mention, i'm taking care of my aquatics director's beautiful dog, guiness.


and lately, i've been seriously considering the rest of my life.  and all i know is that i want to do everything;  like in <i>big fish,<i> and then live to tell about it.  (although i seriously doubt i'll want to work in the circus)"

"event","so ryan burned me <i>details</i> by frou frou and it is one of the best CDs i've heard in a long while.  it's indescribable, really.

today, all i wanted to do was wander around nyack listening to this CD on repeat.

but sadly, that doesn't produce much of a living or get my school work done.
so here i am.  putting music on my lap top before work at north rockland, furiously procrastinating motion graphics homework, donworth reading, and the myriad paperwork-type tasks due for TF3.  friday night-saturday afternoon, however... i am ready for:  the camera and boom mic are rented, the DVCs are purchased, the actors & extras are ready, the locations are scouted.  and it's frou frou all the way from rockland to essex/passaic county and back.

it was a wonderful weekend.  it really was.  and i still have more pictures and quotations to post.  but alas, now i am sick.  still all stuffed up and crappy sounding.  i've over-dosed on soup, day-quil, 100%juice and tea.  and i have lots of classwork and movie preparations to do this week.  

but everything is great.  it really is.
and i love ryan.
so much.

it is cold, indeed.

pamm and i spent 29 hours together watching movies and cooking.  i crocheted 3 scarves in that time.  


and then ryan and i watched <i>shaun of the dead</i>.
oh, to be brittish and quick-witted.



my first digital photography class is tonight.  i'm pretty excited.  then WNYK work and then sitting down and scrapping out a production schedule for one of the movies i'll be making this semester. it's called <i>table for three</i> and it will be starring the beautiful kelsey and either gary or ryan.  can i tell you how excited i am to be working on this film??


this weekend is tuscarora.  i will get to see aly, jenna, kelsey, kristen and all the little guys, aged 14-17, whom we love so much.  what a treat!


and i'm off to the YMCA.  to swim a bit and teach before class."

but i think i can do it.  so far, all my classes are going well.  even voice lessons (we will be working on more ear training and contemporary & broadway singing).  i think i'm just so excited to be almost graduated, but also sad to be missing out on future COM classes.  but no matter.

this is it.  the homestretch.  i'll be spending a lot of time reading, filming, working out, with friends & the pbcyg kids and of course, working and studying.

and not to mention, watching/renting movies non-stop.

"event","ok.

so maybe i'm not impressed by your stories anymore.

you can tell them to me all you want,
but just because i get lonely sometimes does not mean that i will listen, or enjoy your stories.


i mean, so what if i get lonely sometimes.  doesn't everyone?!  being lonely (sometimes) doesn't make me special or different.  i just need to learn to deal with it.  i'm not the only one who works too much, or struggles with things, or doesn't sleep enough, or thinks that working out will work miracles, or misses spending time with people.


so none of us really hang out anymore.

what does that mean?  it means that we're all not who we used to be.  some of us have moved and others spend too much time together.  but all that unity and fun from a few years back is gone.  (you can't argue that it's not)[and i miss it. ]

things might never be as fun as it was a few years ago.

[change is sometimes tough.]


but honestly, how do you measure a year...
can it still be measured in love?


i claim that i'm growing up, getting smarter, relying on myself more, learning, becoming a better person, gaining knowledge.  then if all that's true, what is holding me back from putting it all to the test?  graduating in may and then moving away somewhere.  where i only have myself to rely on...  

is it that some could call me out saying, ""casey, you're running away from your problems.""...?  or is it that i don't want to see what could happen if i leave my brothers too far behind...? or is it that i am too afraid of being alone?  truly alone. or just afraid...
but then what's wrong with seeing if i can survive right here?

[so i guess i really am dependent]
is dependency a bad thing?

what about mediocrity?
or perfectionism?
or complacency?
or dreaming?


tell me, is it still about the music?"

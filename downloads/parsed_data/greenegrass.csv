"event","i may be in seattle for orders of magnitude longer than the forseeable future, and even enjoying it, but that doesn't stop me from thinking about escaping.  the lovely weather is ending and i won't get to have any more mountain getaways.  

places i'm definitely going before next quarter:
vancouver (canada, eh!?) nov 10-12, with a couple of my fellow first year met kids.  
crystal lake/chicago dec 15-29.  dave! sean! jordan! mom, dad, brother! and for the first time ever, KIRA! 
southwestern michigan... at some point over winter break... to see grandma, sisters... and -OMG!- another of the first years in marcellus!!!!!!  small world!

places i fully intend to get to by next summer, or possibly during next summer:
miami - to rehash what's left of my former life there (i really liked that one)
cinncinnati - because it's been a year (next week) since i saw my audgee baby
portland - not too far, and i've never been to oregon.  
washington coast - close, pretty, ocean

other places i really should go before too long:
san francisco - a short flight, apparently a must-see, and i have buddies there.
alaska - i'll probably never live closer than this.  what a crazy road trip that would be.
hawaii - ryan's still there!  he's cool!  and it's hawaii!  and i'm way closer than i was before!

places i'll go sometime not in the near future at all:
new york - because i liked it and i want to go back.  
eastern europe, southeast asia, australia and new zealand, north africa, south africa!, india - to backpack.  i have it all planned out in my head.
anywhere non-english speaking for a year - i hope i can figure out how to study abroad in grad school.  
the poles - if i can manage to get in with some research going there.  
some island in the pacific - why not?"

"event","major decision time, and we know how amazing I am at that.  i have to decide by tomorrow, more or less:

1-bedroom apartment a couple blocks from campus
$640/mo before utitlies, but free wireless is included
walking distance to university ave, so school, groceries, restaurants, shops... everything
completely unfurnished, sketchy bathroom and kitchen
good bus coverage to anything
move in beginning of october... but i'm confident i could find places to crash till then. 

-OR- 
room in (large) house with 2 (cool) computer science grad students
$500/mo before utilities, which are probably about another $100
walking distance to absolutely nothing, but both roommates have cars and they could drive me and/or i could borrow.  multiple buses stop just outside, and run until 1:30 AM.  2.5 miles uphill from school.  own bathroom.  garden. 2 porches. washer/dryer.  cat! cool roommates. 
move in now.  

-OR-
hold out for something closer that's cheaper.  entirely possible i could find some people because i arrived before all the other grad students, and apparently 2-bedrooms are easier to find.  maaybe.  i could even find one now and screen people myself. 

give me input!"

curse you, facebook, for telling me things id rather not know.  no, no, but really, curse me for looking.  
curse you, giordano, for leaving me alone with unlimited free internet while im drunk on (good) wine... and you're...   
curse you, aimexpress, for not fucking working!!  no, its ok, once a month is enough.  it would just make me feel worse.
curse you, pms!
curse you, cell phone, and also ekit, for my text not working so i cant meet up with ruggero if i go to florence tomorrow!
but its ok, ill just stay here and get drunk in l'aquila with the italians.

tonight i spoke english with a good number of people (usually broken on their part), a little italian with a few people (really really broken on my part), mediocre french (on both parts), and then an italian-australian congratuated me on breaking the language barrier while talking to some italians about flag throwing in branson, missouri.  today was the first day i was in one city all day in over a week.  italy is my favorite.  its fucking gorgeous and the people are the best.  and they dont all speak english.  and they make great food and drink lots of coffee and get sooooooo excited about beating australia.  ha, soccer.  no seriously, this summer is amazing, and so is everything.  

ah fuck!  sorry, i have to get back to doing whatever i fucking feel like doing.  which really isn't bitching and moaning, i promise.  i hope your summer is going as well as mine..."

it's 10 pm.  i go meet up with misc kids i havent really seen much since high school.  we drink, at someone's house or some shitty bar in town, it doesn't really matter.  

1 am - everything closes except for 8 million grocery stores and the denny's that's 20 minutes away.  we go to sean's house.  we drink, usually via circle of death, or last night 4-way war.  we watch crap on tv.  

sunrise, around 7 am - other people are getting up for work.  i have no life here, so im still awake.  i dont even get to see the actual sunrise because it's inevitably cold, dreary, and drizzly.  it's time for bed, because there's nothing else to do. 

2-4 pm - rise and shine!  i have either missed the daylight or will have missed it by the time i fuck around on the internet for a few hours.  

5 pm - try to cook dinner for an unappreciative family (""i don't eat spaghetti unless there's meat in it,"" ""why do you want to eat now? it's too damn early"") so my mom, who hates her job and claims she always does everything around the house, doesn't have to

6-9 pm - try to call people, no one answers their phones.  fuck around on the internet and get depressed.  

9 pm - resign myself to reading a book.  suddenly people call and want to hang out.  my headache prevents me from continuing to read, so i submit, and the cycle begins again."

"event","ive been thinking lately about how this is my last year in miami.  i'm not sure how i feel about it really... miami makes me stressed as hell, but i love it anyway.  i thought of things i need more of before i go:
cuban food
key lime pie
the beach
the pool 
pictures of pretty cumulus clouds
the everglades
learn me some spanish
a tan + some pretty pink hair

did you know i think in list form?  
im being domesticated.  here's what i'm going to cook soon, probably next weekend:
tuna casserole
chocolate chip cookies
pommes croustillantes (apple crisp)

mmmmm... and now i can cook pasta too, because rachael taught me today!
ok, one more list... where should i go to grad school next year?  here are the strongest possibilities right now (if i don't go to paris): 
boston
fort collins, colorado
seattle
LA
norman, oklahoma

what do you think?"

"event","guess what books i have checked out from richter right now (for classes).  no?  ok i'll tell you.  the handbook of elliptic integrals for engineers and scientists.  love and mariage in the middle ages.   aristocratic life in medieval france: the romances of jean renart and gerbert de montreuil.  aristocratic women in medieval france.  um, shoot me now.  the first one i can't read, the other 3 are for a class that i actually feel like im going to fail.  i forgot french and i don't understand literature.  

so i'm at the library (taking a break from) working on my physics/reading french.  i've been doing physics all day today and most of yesterday.  i have done (am capable of doing) 1/4 of one physics assignment and 5/6 of the other.  iiiimmm going to fail all my classes.  ooh god.  this week i have a paper due in french (PPAAAINNNFULL) and a test in quantum (and no time/energy to study).  next week i have to give a presentation on aristocratic culture.  this week i have to meet with some girls about it, but they can only do it the night before my quantum test (grrrrrrr).  

i havent even started my thesis.  

im taking 2 GREs in the next month and 10 days.  i havent started studying.

i havent even started applying to grad schools.  

im not entirely sure that im going to survive this semester."

"event","so.  i spent far too much money last month.  apparently my making up for not going out for the last 3 years will have to be over, except for ladies night when drinks are free.  oh well, im way behind on work anyway.  i'm sooo much more busy than i thought i would be this semester.  and im way behind because ive been so drunk.  and today i realized that i need to take the physics GRE on november 12 and the regular GRE before that, and I'm booked solid with presentations, papers, and tests until october 11.  and i haven't started my thesis at all!  and grad school applications..... so my plan is to bury myself in the library/ungar 301 until all that shit is over, with occasional breaks at the pool.  but it's ok, because next year will hold lots of adventure, i hope..."

"event","je ne suis pas heureuse.  j'ai recu ma premiere note dans ma classe de francais... B!  au fin, le prof m'a ecrit une petite lettre.

chere angeline,
vous avez une bonne variete d'observations, mais l'organisation est diffuse.  il faudrait soutenir vos idees avec des exemples, et les presenter dans un ordre qui revele une certaine progression ou logique.  

je prefere l'autre prof.  il a dit ""vous avez des problemes stylistiques et grammatiques, mais ils ne dimunent pas vos arguments.  A+.""  

aujhourd'hui j'ai du travailler avec la fille de paris... apres 5 minutes, elle m'a dit (en anglais) ""je pense que tu ne me comprends pas.  tu devrais me dire.""  oui, bien sur je ne te comprends pas, mais je suis le cours 363, je devrais pouvoir te comprendre.  

il y a aussi des problemes dans ma vie sociale.  hier je suis allee au grove.... c'etait HORRIBLE.  il faut que je me souviens de ne jamais retourner la.  danny m'a dit qu'il etait aller au pub irelandais... je suis allee chez lui, et il m'a dit que vegas ira chez grove.  alors nous sommes alles a sandbar, et rencontre brimey la.  j'aime garrett... il a achete des bieres pour moi et danny.  il a danse avec moi.  au fin de la nuit, quand craigin m'a laissee chez lui a retourner pour brimey, garrett a parle avec moi pour que je ne pleurait pas.  j'etais (je suis) fachee avec brimey parce qu'il m'a dit que je ne veux qu'etre amie avec lui pour se plaindre.  il la m'a dit quand j'etais deprime a cause d'etre dans le barre et ne pouvrait pas parler avec personne pour peur.  c'etait horrible.  et toutes les filles voulaient danser avec danny... le pauvre.  

je te plainte si tu comprends ce qui j'ai dit ici..."

miami makes me feel like i have no friends.  if it weren't for susie (for talking to me and hanging out) and kira (for entertaining and intoxicating me)...  i wouldn't have survived this shit.  

i really hope i dont go nuts at home.  and i REALLY hope i don't go nuts in china.  

you tell me it'll be ok... but you've never been in my head, have you?  aaahhhhhhhhhh"

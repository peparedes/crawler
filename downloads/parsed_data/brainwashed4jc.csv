"event","wow long time since i updated (thanks sam) anyways, so lastnight was interesting. samantha and i were talking and talking and she updated her buddy profile right? yeah well she put me in there....dude what she wrote made me cry. i cried for like 5 minutes. even though she told me not to. she has got to be one of my best friends of all time. 7 months of knowing each other..2 times talking on the phone...1 time meeting in person= 45 minutes on the phone...and about 20 bucks from the movies...our millions and millions of shared laughs...ABSOLUTELY PRICELESS. seriously i have so much fun with her. goodness. there are some really good lookin construction guys here right not. woo. anyways...not to get distracted...im about to go visit stephanie bluth in the hospital. shes sick bad. im taking her some flowers and ballons. i hope she gets better soon.

i feel pretty oh so pretty...

man, im so happy. like i havent been this happy in a while. la te da la te da. i think me and andie might be getting to know each better and connecting more. shes a really cool kid. haha. i finally get to play monday. 6 weeks without soccer is rough. i dont think i have ever gone this long with out it. im slowly detererating...i so spelled that one wrong. im so cold. so like everyone left me this weekend. for forensics. oh well i think tomorrow im gonna go watch samanthas basketball game. i hope i get to go, i want to see her really bad and give her a nice easy no bone breakin hug. i feel like i need to be there to support her. since im classified as one of her best friends, its offical, its in her buddy profile. 8-) im cool heck yes.

"event","Friends, what can i say about friends. You have good friends, and then you have bad friends. I thought i was the kinda person that had good friends. Friends that go and hurt me. Friends that i could count on. Well i was just being gulible again. Some of the people that im aquinted with i thought were good friends then they go and they do something stupid that knows plays with my emotions, that i dont like to talk about, that i dont want to be around and they go and lie about it. Good friends? I think not. I have a few that i know will always be there for me, but that number gets smaller and smaller ever single day. Then they ask me whats wrong then when i dont want to talk to them they cant figure it out. Its AMAZING! Yeah I might lie, I've drank before, I've forged my dads name on stuff, I've been a bad kid before but I've always put my friends before a lot of things. I've done nothing to them to ever do the stuff that they do to me. I dont know. I do know its retarded, do you hear that? RE-TAR-DED! I hope they can read. Maybe when/if i move to missouri i will make better friends and keep the really good ones here too. Its when people do stuff like this that makes me want to move so much more, to get away from them. I feel like falling off a cliff and dying right about now. Plus i have to pee. Okay be right back. Alright im done peeing. Okay well a big thanks to all my WONDERFUL, GREAT, NON-BAD, friends. 

On another note..

I saw my dearest Kelsey B today! I went bowling with her today and a bunch of people. It was fun. They are cool. AND GOOD FRIENDS.

Then I went to the movies. I saw Darkness. It scared me. BAD.


well if i like you, call me/text me. whatever.

:-( i miss my samantha so much, shes in chicago. come home soon. )-:

"event","i guess we are settin up the tree or whatever? i really dont know. really dont care. today kinda sucked. i stayed at home and did nothing. i thought we were going to go to the movies but we didnt. maybe tomorrow. my dad and his gf took my brother ice skating i didnt go, cause i dont want to be around her. i hate her so much. my bro hopes that get married. i dont. i wish she wasnt in my life. i wish my dad wouldnt see her anymore. i wouldnt have to make those 4 hour trips up there. god. im done venting about that. now im going to be happy cause i learned being depressed doesnt get you anywhere. i just want to be friends to everyone and have a good life. when it comes down to it Gods not going to ask how many friends you have, hes going to ask how many people you were friends true. and thats all i want. i want to be friends to everyone, and have them accept me for who i am. i might be the slowest one on the team, or i might not wear the name brand clothes...but if you talk to me im sure you would like me. im not mean (only jokingly mean to my friends) i like to be funny and stupid and random. i like for people to like me. i might not be rich or have the looks or any of those things but the one thing i can say i have is a few good friends. ones that i know will stick with me til the end. ones who i know will be there for me. and to them goes a big thank you. i used to be the kind of kid that sat in the corner cause i didnt want to talk to anyone... now you wouldnt know that. i like to socialize and interact with other people. its stupid for people to judge you are talk about you. yeah i might have done that before but im gonna stop. okay enough for the friendship thing right now. 

hmm lets see what can i talk about now...

Samantha. im going to talk about samantha...in a good way that is. Samantha Marie Butler attends Elmwood Jr High. and is 14 years old. i met her in june when i proceeded to yell at her for some stupid reason. then i apologized and we became friends. she is a FROG MURDERER. if you have a pet frog...hide it. she loses them very easily. then forgets about them. poor frogs. Samantha has been a great person in the 6 months that i have known her. we have had many laughs and many *tears*...cause we are cool like that. um..im talking to her right now....about hats and shoelaces. i have fun talking to dear ol samantha. she makes me happy. very happy. :-D < see im happy. i really dont know what else to say. now i kinda feel bad. i summerized her in one misely paragraph. i should be ashamed. oh well she wont care. i hope. 

for dinner tonight we had steak corn potatoes and biscuits. mmm it was good. i didnt eat a lot though. i also had a chocolate covered banana. 


well im gonna go now. i have to go work out.  fun stuff man.


peace. love. anna.

"event","Im not going to count the ways i love you
nor am i going to shout it to the world
Im not going to write a love letter 
nor call you on the phone
Im not going to stalk you 
nor am i going to serenade you 
Im not going to write a sweet sweet poem
nor make you a song

Instead my love i will do the best of all
I will give you 14 lines and call it a sonnet
with my measly 4 lines left give it my all
I will say I love you in just 2 more
the best way i can put and the only way i know 
here you go baby a sonnet that says i love you."

untitled
by me

all the things left behind
i want them back
show me a sign
there, on the floor tied in a sack

lay all forgotten memories
i didnt mean to leave them
its so hard to see
my mistakes lead him to be condemed
how can it be

his mercy, his power, the grace he gave to thee
im so confused
im sure he would agree
forever i will be bruised

forgive and forget
he is alpha, omega, fire and fury
i try not to fret
all my sins he will bury

i will remeber all he has done
all he has gave
all the things ive misdone
and everytime hes forgave"

Final Thoughts
by: me

here i am in my bed
on my pillow lays my head
thinking about you
do dreams ever come true
waiting for sleep to over come me 
my eyes can no longer see
your image fades away 
until the dawn of the next day
the way you pull me near 
is why you are so dear 
a special place in my heart
will never keep us apart
through times of distress and dispair 
i know you'll always be there
as sleep pulls me even more under
i still lay there and wonder
what made you like me
and why you sit there and call me cutie
this all puzzles me as im lying here
i feel your love from way over there
how is it true 
i really like you
sometimes i cant think 
is my love for you a hoodwink
can it last forever
will it end never
my everlasting love
you gave it a little shove
with my last thoughts 
i dare not
think of being without you
and now my mind has withdrew
i wish you a goodnight
my love for you will burn bright as if it was a tourch light
always stay the same you
i bid thee adieu"

by me

Lost in this world
waiting for someone to make it right
me and my friends, we used to be tight
then my world started to crumble
and i started to tumble
then you came along 
and sang the most beautiful song
ever since that faithful day
i just wanted to say
i love you 
and its ever so true!

you have no idea what this means to me. its got such emotion behind it, it would blow your mind. ERRR TONIGHT IS SO FREAKIN EMOTIONAL! i cant wait til i go camping."

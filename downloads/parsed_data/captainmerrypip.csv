"event","<div>Okay, so I'm doing something a bit different. This isn't song lyrics or some random thing asking the general public about something or other. This is something serious for once. You might think it isn't, but, and those who know me well or have known me for a while will attest to this, it's something I've been debating for a while. And that would be:<br /><br />Whether or not I should become a vegetarian.<br /><br />And don't jump to any conclusions about me being an animal rights activist. I gave rats morphine. And made them swim while they were stoned (it's not as bad as it sounds; this occured in a lab, with supervision, and was regulated). So I'm not a PETA freak, although I am against animal testing in cosmetics, because hell, we need medicine more than we need makeup. We need medicine a LOT more.<br /><br />But I'm digressing.<br /><br />I'm not debating becoming a vegetarian because I think it's morally wrong to eat animals. Heck, I'm an omnivore, and under the right circumstances I'd have an El Gaucho Petite Filet Mignon once a week. And I LOVE bacon cheeseburgers. So why would I remotely consider giving up my favorite food group? Because ecologically we can't sustain my diet (those who've taken Cameron biology can skip the rest of this paragraph). Say I ate nothing but steak for a week. In order to feed enough cows so I could eat sufficient amounts of beef to support my lifestyle (energetically), those cows would need to be fed some sort of plant material (this obviously isn't including the intensively farmed cattle that are fed animal byproducts, that's another issue I have, but I'm not going into that further). Now if I gave up eating steak and only ate the plant material for a week, there'd be enough veggies and grains to feed not only me but nine other people for that week. <br /><br />Think about it, if I'm eating mostly meat, which I do, how many people am I denying food? And I know that me becoming a vegetarian is not going to do much difference, since if I don't order that delicious looking steak, someone else will. But it's a start. Maybe I can influence people. And maybe I can cut down on the meat I eat rather than do away with it altogther. Because it'd be a shame to pass up a Double-Double with a Sidecar (""Sidecars are for bitches!""), or that 4x4 I said I'd eat, next time I'm at an In-N-Out.<br /><br />So what do you think? What should I do?<br /><br />God, I'm such a hippie somedays...</div>"

"event","Okay, I got tired of the old look. Considering it's the only one I had. And I needed something Franz related. Because I have no life.

A few things you might not have known about Idaho:

There are only two stereotypes: Emo and Prep/Jock.

I listen to REM, therefore, I am Emo. I don't get it. I feel happier here than I have in a while, and I have been given this stereotype.

Which has led me to question: What stereotype DO I fit into?

I said a few things, but I forgot the rest of them.

I'm bored, can you tell?

Oh, and I'm mad at people.&nbsp;

And excited for Saturday.

Oh well."

Instead of giving you a huge review of how wonderful Glacier National Park, rafting, tubing, Howard's Pizza, and getting stung by a bee for the first time in my life were, I'm going to say one very important thing: <br /><br /><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""7"">GO SEE <em>AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH</em>!!!</font> <br /><br />I don't care what your political affiliations are, if you can't suck it up and watch Al Gore for an hour and a half, read the screenplay.

We belong to the Earth."" <br /><br />And like parasites, we're destroying it. <br /><br />I've been to Glacier National Park. There used to be 150 glaciers. Now there's 30. In about a quarter of a century, there may not be any left. And that's not the worst of it... <br /><br />Will you just stand by and let it happen? Refuse to take action? Pretend global warming isn't your problem? <br /><br />I won't. <br /><br /><br />"

And I have three to choose from so far. Mind you, I am only really interested in one of these. So I got into ACI, which I applied to in July for free just because they'd get back to me in October (found out Halloween. Cutting it close aren't they?), and I wouldn't be flipping out the rest of the year. Then applied to FIT, because it was free, easy, and no essay. My parent's didn't know this... weren't they surprised!! Then RWMC got back to me today and said they unanimously voted to accept me. YAAAY! And have very good chance at getting full ride WITH money to study abroad! Huzzah!

And on top of that, have received $12,500/year for FIT and $13,000/year for RMWC so far. 

I love feeling wanted.

Sorry for the bragging. I'm just so happy right now.

State tomorrow!

Pray that Sun or Claire aren't killed off tonight on LOST.

"event","So was working on my bloody Letter of Commitment (what if I have a fear of commitment, eh? Then what are you going to do?) when I found something that amused me in the handbooky planner thing:

<EM>Students will not use ""Vannet"" for political lobbying</EM>

Darn. I'll have to start contacting all those crazy congressmen from home. That's such a pain...

Anyway HC = interesting (and for the record, I did NOT make the sign that said ""Johnny Depp, will you go to HC with me?"" Although I did think of signing it...). But school dances always have a number of interesting things. So I have organized them into a list. How Letterman of me!

<lj-cut text=""HC Top 10"">
10. Girls in formal dresses that have nothing to do with the theme. 
9. Bad music.
8. Girls flocking to bathroom in hordes (or warrens!) when a slow song comes on.
7. A wave of steam that hits you as soon as you walk onto the dance floor.
6. The couples that are no where near each other until aforementioned slow song is played, and then they come rushing together and hit each other with so much force you believe they are magnetized.
5. Couple standing on dance floor making out. Standing. As in not dancing or even moving in time with the music. Dude, you PAID to go to a DANCE. If that was all you wanted to do, stay home, save the money, and spare us the sight of you.
4. Random couple who do nothing but grab each others asses the entire time.
3. Random group of girls who dance dirtier than aforementioned couple.
2. Girl dancing while looking like she is constipated.

And the number one most interesting thing at homecoming...

1. Fackler dancing.
</lj-cut>

But it was fun. All but Brian, Brian, Amy, and I were late to dinner, so ended up getting to the dance at 8:30, danced, talked to people, stood in line forever, Brian left, watched people (""people"" is a word which here means ""Fackler"") dance, moshed a bit to ""A Pirate's Life For Me"" (kidding!), and went home. Then Bird-Fested today. And homework. But have finished 100 Year long book. Am accomplished!"

"event","I'm updating because I found some of that valuably rare (or rarely valuable?) resource STRIPED BANANAS! Er, TIME!

So Sunday went to Arawan with Alyshia to work on Bio. We were productive. And coconut is not a good soup ingredient!

Then headed to see Just Like Heaven with my mom. Funny movie. NAPOLEON'S IN IT! He's the psychic, Darryl. He's brillant. Worth the ticket price. But Katrina was interesting too. And Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon (No, with a knife...) were great leads. And it reminded me slightly of TOK, but I won't tell you why because it'll ruin the plot twist. Which I predicted! Made me happy. But it's a good plot twist, probably because the idea isn't mainstream, but seems to make sense. Just go see it. And the soundtrack is AWESOME! It's got The Cure, Beck, and one of the most interesting covers ever... Bowling for Soup singing ""Ghostbusters."" And I found it amusing that the classic rock station in the movie is 92.3.

Then home, FOOD, and ice cream with crushed red pepper. Heck yum! And got to hang out with Brian and Jeneva in the process.

So today, had thangata (school, for those who aren't in my history class). And swimming. Am swimming 200 Free and 100 Back tomorrow. 200 Ack. Back yay!

Then worked on homework while trying to memorize new CD. So far really like ""Happy Is a Yuppie Word,"" ""Easier Than Love,"" ""The Blues,"" and ""Polititians,"" but that'll all change probably.

And on Saturday found out that (for club swimming only) dolphin kicking ONCE on the Breaststroke pullout is now legal. YAY!"

"event","The football game was pathetic. First half, were up ten zip. They score 28 unanswered. But got to hang out with Courtney and her fellow Art School friends, which meant I got to trapse through Communist Russia, er, the Camas side, to meet there ""Incredibly Good Looking"" science teacher. So the game wasn't a total waste as I got to spent time with swimmer buddies! And got to hard time Jenna. 

Jenna: How'd we score three?
Courtney: Field goal.
Jenna: It <EM>costs</EM> three points?!

That was amusing. We'll never let her live that one down. Had some interesting encounters, but did not get shot for being a capitalist pig, er, River student. 

Our History video pretty much rocks. Hope Fackler can film the one scene... But I'll always remember ""Bresh"" and ""That's amazing..."" 

This song title rocks. But am irritated at my wonderful father, who brings the new Switchfoot CD to the meet to give to me as it just came, then proceeds to leave on fishing trip with said CD. Grr. Must memorize before concert.

And 10 days left! Then 3 days left!"

I love having meets on Thursday then having a meet the next Tuesday. It's pretty much: Monday- workout. Tuesday - sprints. Wednesday - pre-meet (AKA screwing around). Thursday - meet! Friday - More screwing around, because why start a workout week before the weekend? Weekend - nothing. Monday - Hegedus's attempts to get us to do something, to little avail. Tuesday - meet! Wednesday - bummer. 

So Friday went to school. Went to swimming. Went to football game and watched our team claim superiority over Fort. AND WE CAN KICK NOW!!! Sorry, that just made me v. happy. 

Saturday - Drove around a bit as parents did stuff. Sat in car working on homework while parents in Costco. Was listening to radio while reading about the causes of WWI and heard ""This Fire"" by Franz Ferdinand. Was HIGHLY amused and even told history teacher about it. And they're going to be in town in October, but the tickets cost $30. Sad. Then worked on homework and was finally allowed to go to Brian's party, where I gave him his fake gift and fake card, because getting him the real gift is next to impossible. Hope he appreciates me or I'll bust some ""Na-CHOW!"" on his arse. But the party was fun: proved to everyone that I can't sing, got my arse kicked by everyone at DDR, distracted people so their hair could be braided, mimicked football players, met Clayton, considered duct-taping myself to someone's car, tried to explain who Fackler was to Matt H., argued with people about trivia loosely related to one of my favorite subject (Johnny Depp!), and generally had fun. 

Sunday - Watched a LOT of Lost. Grr. Cliffhangers just keep getting worse. And I still have 4 hours of S1 left, not to mention 2 hours of S2. Also saw POTC2 poster. THERE'S A JACK SPARROW VOODOO DOLL ON IT!!!! I want one of those... ~Evil grin~ The reason I saw said poster was because my parents and I went to see An Unfinished Life. Highly recommend it. Best lines : ""'There's a BUTT, Montana!' 'It's Butte.'"" ""We could go to Aloha, Oregon"" and they pronounced it the Hawai'ian way. So much schema with the mispronunciations of places near where I've lived. But the best line had to be (give or take) ""You will show respected to everyone who comes to my house... Unless it's someone trying to sell their angle of God. There's no excuse for bullshit like that."" Brillant! 

And we had a rather interesting phone call: 

My mom: Hello? Caller: Is this Wanda? My mom: No... 
Caller: Is this (insert our phone number with Montana area code)? 
My mom: No. That's a Montana code. (pause) This is Washington. 
Caller: Is this Jenni? 
My mom: Yes.... 
Caller: Well, this is your crazy old aunt! 

And it was indeed my great-aunt from Michy!. Apparently she tried to call my great-uncle in Montana, as it was his birthday. Wanda is apparently his girlfriend. So we were all amused. I found that post-worthy. 

Monday - NATIONAL TALK LIKE A BLOODY PIRATE DAY BUCKOS!!! I dressed like a pirate, but had difficultly talking like one, due to illness. Should've stayed away from Liz at aforementioned party, but it's so difficult, because she's Liz, and, well, you know... Tuesday - Homecoming Theme = Pirates!!!! QED. So excited. Do I even need to prepare? Me thinks I may need to help Brian, as I own more pirate stuff by far. Mwahahahaha! In honor of all the piraty stuff happening, I'm reposting this. Because R&M is love.

Mwhahaha! And had meet. Dropped 4 seconds in IM and 3 in 100 Breaststroke. I QUALIFIED! 

And now have Switchfoot tickets!

Wednesday - Was asked to Homecoming! 

Brian: So, I guess you'll be dragging me to Homecoming because of the theme. 
Me: If you ask me... 
Brian: Ash, will you go to Homecoming with me? 
Me: Yes 
Hallah: Awwww... 
V. fun. But practice was evil. And was still sick... 

Thursday - Nothing really to report. Asked Lohnes if we could have a field trip and see Franz Ferdinand. They have this awesome song! 

<lj-cut text=""All For You, Sophia Lyrics"">
Bang bang, Gavrilo Princip
Bang bang, shoot me Gavrilo
Bang bang, the first six are for you
Bang bang, the seventh is for me
Bang bang, Gavrilo Princip
Bang bang, Europe's going to weep

All for you, all for you, all for you, Sophia 
All for you, all for you, all for you, Sophia 
All for you, all for you, all for you, Sophia 
All for you, all for you, all for you, Sophia 

Bang bang, history's complete
Bang bang, shoot me Gavrilo
Bang bang, the first six are for you
Bang bang, the seventh is for me
Bang bang, Gavrilo Princip
Bang bang, shoot me Gavrilo

All for you, all for you, all for you, Sophia 
All for you, all for you, all for you, Sophia 
All for you, all for you, all for you, Sophia 
All for you, all for you, all for you, Sophia 

The Black Hand holds the gun
The devil takes his run
Urban, take the Appel Quay
It's June the twenty-eighth
The seventh was for me

Bang bang, shoot me Gavrilo
Bang bang, the first six are for you
Bang bang, the seventh is for me

Creepy... 

And the Lock-In was moved, so I can go!

Friday - School. We had a ""Waffle Party"" for Mrs. Lehrman. That was fun. Waffles, Lifehouse, and Impregnated Baloons! Next=Swimming. Then went to Corpse Bride with Alyssa. Good movie. Funny, artistic, and wierd. It was like being at a Johnny Depp movie and not being at a Johnny Depp movie at the same time. But really good. Go see it. And saw GoF trailer! Stupid bloody platforms on the lake could ruin it for me. 

Then football game. We lost, but someone bought a program for me. And the band sounded good. And I was given an alter ego: Vini Lincoln. Yes, ""Vini."" I like wierd spellings. The best quote was: ""Red?"" said by Brian. That, and Alyssa commenting on how he was a salesman, and he should become a travelling salesman so he could wake up one morning as a BUG! Mwahahahaha! I love being a year ahead of him. 

Saturday - Went to practice. Volunteered for CAS. Went to Stanich's. Found out my grandma (one of the ones in Montana) was in the hostpital, but she came home today, which was good. Showered finally. Harassed those still at CAS and went to ICR with that one guy. What's his name? Jeremy, was it? Anyway, he didn't know what ""PC"" meant 24 hours ago and won't cite me as his source on his journal. Breaking the honor code, he is! Anyway, we got into a discussion about a bumper sticker I saw that said ""Liberal: PC for COMMUNIST"" and then told him about my variation: ""Conservative: PC for FASCIST!"" And we yelled fascist at the same time, it was so fun. And he played some songs off Avenue Q. Pretty funny. Then home to watch my third quarter theory come true, causing me to rub in the fact that I am a ""Jeen-yus."" And homework. 

Today - Homework. And a brief break to borrow grandparents' stairs to use slinky, but the stairs were too wide, so will have to hunt down someone else's stair to found the Corporation of Crazy Writers, Inc. 

And I am ready to hurt my iTunes. They keep playing ""Blind."" I love that song, but it is currently TIED with 'Everything"" for most played. In fact, it WAS most played for the 6 minutes and 7 seconds it took to play ""Everything"" which was ironically played right after ""Blind"" surpassed it. Grr. This cannot be! 

That's it. Be sure to have plenty of water handy upon your travels to Argentina, unless of course you like the dancing."

Events:
No. 1 (Fly in Medley relay) Second heat.
No. 8 (500 free) Only heat. [Dropped six seconds for the first time in nearly a year!)
No. 9 (FIRST SWIMMER ON BLOODY RELAY!)

I also swam the final relay, but it wasn't like ""Sit around for a really long time... Swim two races back to back.""

Have fifth Lost DVD...

And I was random before Brian stopped obliterating villages (three months, three days sober!). I have proof.

Rumor-that-is-hopefully-but-not-necessarily-true has it: ""High Seas"" Hope that means Jess goes BRN on us...
Rumor-that-is-in-fact-true also has it - third Saturday in October. Bummer.

In other words, I wish I could cut out the drama in my life. I can't say the last time I went 24 hours without crying. I hate this. I feel like I have no choices. I do, but none work.  There's
a. Break up with Brian
b. Severe ties completely with my parents
c. Keep going on and hope the pressure doesn't build up anymore than it already and pointlessly has.

So I guess this is the time to fly off into the switling brown of Saturn's methane rivers."

"event","First weekend of the school year. Heck yeah!

So did some homework. Hung out with Brian and nearly killed my computer in the process. Then went out with great-great aunt and uncle for GERMAN food. Relatives were amusing. Food... not so much. Yes, I am a pitiful excuse for a mostly German person! But had some funny quotes. Ask if you want to hear them, as I don't have time to post.

Then to Hollywood Video to rent the magnificent dramatic thing that is <EM>Lost</EM>. Because we have half the first season left to watch! But yeah, HV only had one of the discs we needed which meant we had to go to the evil that is...

(pause)

(Dramatic music)

BLOCKBUSTER!

(Cresendo to ""Dun. Dun. Dun."")

And got other disc. So we only need two more discs. 

Then watched that after looking around for dad's checkbook thinking we left it in the parking lot, when it was really behind the seat.

Okay so today, got up and did homework/messed around on computer. Then off to Justin's for group work/techno jam sesh. Then home. Then more <EM>Lost</EM>. I love Charlie! Then more computer. Then, nothing.

And I found the lyrics to ""Lifetime"" by Better Than Ezra. Sad song.

Good night my Catalans and jelly doughnut pig dogs!"

And just three more days until their next CD.

And apparently they have an online magazine called <EM>Lowercase People</EM>. And they have shirts. If they're selling them at the concert, I'm getting one. And if they aren't I'm STILL getting one. Because ""Company Car"" is a kick-arse song. I need a shirt that says ""<EM>You've</EM> got the Company Car!"" Because it'd be funny and no one would get it. I'll make it after I make my ""Seniors Rock.

"event","So woke up Saturday and headed out to go shopping. Went to outlets this time, and actually FOUND stuff. So got some shirts, pants, socks, and a pair of shoes I already had (because they were on sale). Also tried on v. interesting dress at Adidas because we couldn't figure out how it worked. 

Then went to Lowe's, so sat in car talking to Liz. Then left and headed to OSF. Ate and went to mall, where I got skirt (yes, laugh. I bought a skirt) and skull/rose shirt. Skirt has a spot, so will be taking it back. 

Then rented <EM>Sahara</EM> and watched that. It was interesting, but not the best movie I've seen. Unfortunately, the best action sequence was close to the beginning (with the BOATS! And Panama!) and I wished they'd have focused more on some of the scientific aspects, but it wasn't bad.

So I had a really boring day... but I'm off to see <EM>The Constant Garderner</EM> over at the new spiffy theatre, because we've never been there."

"event","Starting with the last time I wrote (of course), I have now completely reorganized my CDs. So they are now not only alphabetical by band/singer/group and chronological within said band/singer/group, but the CDs and jackets all match up! And I redid the structure, so instead of having jacket over CD or vice-versa, they are NEXT to each other. And I have 62 CDs (several of which I should get rid of) and a total of 759 songs. But only 161 on iTunes (including those I have borrowed from parental unit's CDs). Need to upload...

So then headed out with grandparents to meet parents at Henry's for dinner. Took bloody forever. Had good bacon-cheeseburger, and the bun had CHEESE in it. I love cheese. Fries good too. My dad asked how the burger ranked on my list, and I said after Stanich's and In-N-Out. And his (looked rather injured that I forgot to mention this at first). 

So got home. Find rather large pirate flag in window that parents bought when they went to the coast (not the beach, the coast) for the sole purpose of driving car to coast. So was getting ready for bed when I hear this knock on my window that SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME. So first thought was my dad locked himself out again. Then I thought that would be odd at 10pm. So second thought was it was some crazy night prowler. Then remembered Brian was home, so thought it was him. Finished putting on PJs, and opened shades to discover that it WAS the crazy night prowler! Whose name was Brian, He-Who-Recently-Returned-From-His-Stay-With-the-White-Supremacists. So talked for a bit, in which I kept thinking ""Crap, my parent's are going to be majorly P.O'd."" Because I told them, and they were... are. Then attempted to sleep, but was prevented due to my flirtation with insomnia...

So started ODR at work. Swimming rats = v. interesting. Swimming rats injected with morphine and therefore swimming STONED rats = v. v. v. interesting. 

Then at swimming. We swam. Yay!

So home, ended up not going to dance thing as there was no one to tag along with as ""I wouldn't hang out with them."" Then had long, in-depth discussion, forgot to eat almost, and invited Brian over. Hoped to see Venus/Jove, er, Zeus, I mean, Jupiter (yes, I pay to much attention to Greek/Roman mythology!), but to vloudy. However, annoyed parents before he arrived with frequent mutterings of ""Mars is bright tonight..."" because they didn't get the allusion. Clearly THEY'VE never been to Singapore...

So ended up playing 7evens (Collective Soul = <3!). And I WON! For the first time in three years. Was awesome. Except for that hand where Brian stuck me with the Ace because his last card was the seven of the matching suit. Loser!

Then off to work. Swam more rats. Except the one rat was too stoned to swim, so he just kinda floated. And he floated across the line, so we had to count that. V. interesting.

Met parents for pizza (and Black Cherry soda! Yay!) before swimming. Was smart this time and only ate two slices because last time I ate three before practice and couldn't swim too well. Bloody leeches...

So had sub at swim practice so Hegedus could get a head start on his Labor Day weekend while forcing us to swim. But sub was... interesting. And rather Slughorn-ish. Finished warm-up first (not because I'm fast, but because I'm the first in and I don't stop at the walls), so came over and introduced herself and I became, quote unquote, one of ""her people."" So was one of the people who got the ""hardest"" sets, was told to ""plough over"" people, and was also a demonstrator. Then we did this thing where we swam the width of the pool (sans lane-lines) where the first person, then the second, third, and so on would chain react and if you beat the person to your right across, you changed places, so we lined up fastest to slowest. Then, we swam relays, which was arranged so Jean, Rachelle, Ashley, and I (the fastest four after the previous thing) where one relay, and the rest were matched up every sixth person to even stuff out. So all the fast people were together... V. odd. Then we played sharks and minnows (which you CAN'T play on a basketball court!) and guess who were the four sharks? Yeah, quite odd. Then warmed down swimming trains with Hallah and Rachelle. Fun.

So then home, and got ready to participate in the great American tradition of watching people run over each other to capture a lemon for the sake of proving their dominance over another group of people. Meaning I went to the football, I mean, Semi-violent Lemon game. We won. Hung out, mainly with Alyssa and Curt, but also talked to Talyor, Adil, Justin, Alexis, Ariel, Other Talyor, parents friends, former coaches, and a buncha other people. And became The Ash Ninja (Na-CHOW!). And Curt is going to put music to my song lyrics. Yay! But yeah, lots of memorable stuff that I can't remeber was said. And I fell off the bleachers into Justin, picked myself up, and said quite-Frodoesque ""Oops, I fell over!"" V. fun. Then out to ICR (mmm... Dr. Chocolate...) with Talyor (from Bay), her mom, and my parents. And apparently everyone else at the game had the same idea. Saw MORE people. Also sat at same table I've sat at the last two times and this time I got the ""lightish red"" glass. Bloody Karma.

And I've been listening to the radio, because Thursday, as I was pulling in, ""The Devil in the Wishing Well"" ended, so it seemed symbolic that I should put new CDs in my car to end my summer music listening. But I've heard a buncha stuff I like, which is wierd, like Lifehouse, Eve 6, ""December,"" etc.

And I've started a new song. It's entitled ""Conformist,"" because the original title ""Hi! My name is Society; may I take your order?"" was too long. So Alyssa and I thought our swim shirts should say ""Hi! We're the Columbia River Swim Team; may we take your order?"" but figured it'd be too inappropriate if paired with last years sweatshirts.

So off to shop today, because there must be clothes that exist that I can wear... Bleh.

Look out for radioactive squirrels, Khan, and Marx the bully and I will tie a flag to my head and learn to say ""Aye"" properly before adding ""Avast"" to my extensive vocabulary."

"event","Satrting with yesterday:

Went to... (pause)... WORK! Handled/checked stylets and talked to Mike regarding experiment. Which I start tomorrow. Also wrote song (see previous entry), which was loosely inspired (lyrically) by Lifehouse's ""Blind,"" Train's ""Blind,"" and U2's ""Miracle Drug"" and ""City of Blinding Lights."" It was slightly more inspired by the line in Pay the Girls ""We Both Lose"" that I LOVE: ""[You] made me look through your eyes, I was blind to the things that you were blind to"" just to take a positive spin on that because there's always two perspectives. So give those songs a listen; because they're awesome.

Then TIME TRIALS! They were fun. I did fairly well at the 50s and the IM, but my 100 Free SUCKED! But not bad considering:

a. I haven't shaved since God knows when. Yeah, most people think swimmers (even the guys) shave all the time. No, that's just for meets. Because hair = drag. And we go way to far out of our way for drag.
b. I had my practice suit on, which is a size larger than my meet suit AND thicker.
c. The pool was really frickin' warm.

Oh well, I'm still first lane. But apparently, as I discovered after practice, I loceked my keys in the car, because I zipped them in my bag, which was shoved under my car seat. Fun. So called Parental Unit #1 (mom) to come unlock car for me. Then drove home, and was stopped by a TRAIN! Gah. Not my day. And it just stood there on the tracks, doing nothing, right when it was at the end! Bleh. But apparently I crack people up. Hm...

So home. Ate really good food. Mmmm... FOOOOD. Then fiddled around (pun intended to all you well-read people out there!) a bit on LS.com. New book out Oct 18th. Bloody excited! 

And today went to work. Handled for a bit before realizing ANOTHER rat was missing. So searched aroud for it for a while, before Erin came in and found it immediately. Bloody experienced people. Then checked stylets, washed vials, and then set up/ran practice experiment. The rats we used were really fat, and one nearly drowned. I guess that's why I named the experiment ""ODR."" Then went to the ""Back to School"" BBQ for all the WSUV people. The food was free because it was part of their student fees, which meant it was really cheap for me. Mwahaha! So had a sno-cone. Then Erin, Carly, and I played this game of horseshoes. Except it was massive, the pole thing was about 6 feet high and the horseshoes were quite large. And squishy (I shall call him SQUISHY!). It was hilarious. Erin was pretty good, but Carly and I had some sucky throws. Then left.

Swimming was fun. We did trains. And someone grabbed onto ours, so we had six people instead of three. And we did some IM-y stuff. I love high school swimming. And we have shirt ideas. This is from an anonymous source, who refused to say who her source was, and there is no way we will be able to use it:
""If you show me your fly, I'll show you my breast!""

That's even dirtier than my idea! The slogan I'm pulling for is:
""When you're on the block, it's just you, the water, and the little thing that goes 'beep beep' so you might as well swim.""

So, yeah, then here I am, rather bored. Should go organize CDs... Fun, fun.

And, ironically, Tori (my freakishly intelligent and crazy rabbit) likes to chew on Sophie's World. Hm...

Miss you still.

And I need to go before the darkness turns on the light in my mind and I actually figure out what I'm doing/supposed to be doing here."

"event","Okay, so not much on Saturday. Buncha homework... Watched the somewhat edited version of Jerry Maguire, which means I had to run down the hallway while the parentals fast-forwarded through a scene. But I took the popcorn. Mwahahaha. Ha. Ha. Ha...

So Sunday, woke up and parents were watching late '50s movie entitled: Pillow Talk. V... interesting film. Later, we did the whole traditional family thing and went on a picnic at Lucia falls. But you couldn't ""make contact"" with the water. What's the point? So my dad and I threw around a football for a bit. Then walked along stream on this trail thing. Saw some nice houses. Ironically, those with private property apparently had access to the water, but no public access was allowed. Bloody double standards! Then headed to Moulton Falls, which was upstream a bit and you COULD get in the water there, so, naturally, we did. Lots of rocks. People were jumping of them. Wish I had a suit...

Then home to finish summer reading. Uber huzzah! Parents rented Count of Monte Cristo because my dad hadn't seen it and I'm reading the book and I forgot who everyone was. That movie = <3. It combines all my favorite elements: a great prison break, revenge (a beautiful thing to live for, 'O Loverly Glowworm!), sword-fighting, pirates, intelligence (gasp!), and that really awesome thing where two people get into a fight to the death, lose their swords, and instead of running after weapons decide to PUNCH each other for a while (see Macbeth). V. fun movie. Why don't I own it? V. stange. And speaking of that, I saw Saved! on sale for $8. Must buy that movie. Another movie I am shocke that I do not own. Must look into this. Hmm... ANYWAY, I picked up on so much more watching it again, and I picked up on a LOT the first time, and even the second time. I love rewatching movies (see Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl)

Anyway, then had today happen. Went to work. Five rats escaped sometime between last night and this morning, so had to hunt those down. Mike's back from Down Under. Handled rats but ended up cleaning a bunch because we had a lot of dishes (read rat cages) and NO STORAGE WHATSOEVER! V. frustrating having only eight rats not in bulk housing. Then swabbed the deck, er, mopped the floor. Wouldn't it be awesome to have a lab on a boat... ship. Then watched surgeries for a bit because ""Come As You Are"" was playing. God, I love that song. Then left. Meant to call back Brian, but my mom's family keeps calling and I have no reception out here! Grr! But she found my 7even Year Itch! I loves me parents. And Collective Soul. No more 90s Alt. Rock withdrawls!Left for swimming. That was fun. Time trials tomorrow! Yay. Then came home, edited World Lit paper (yes, I know), ate (double gasp!) and danced around with a monkey on my shoulder. Meaning I READ stuff that I didn't have to read. That makes me happy.

And I learned how to use a yo-yo this weekend. Yes, I am that pathetic.

Farewell to those who lament developing relationships to anti-homophobes and short, food-loving rock gods who write ""LATE"" in sprawling letters across across their right hands!

Edit: Dude! The weather is awesome! We had THUNDERSTORMS! And it was partly sunny. I love this stuff!"

"event","<lj-cut text =""Well, I remembered the other quote..."">
Okay, so at work on Thursday, the other quote I had from lunch was about our Halloween costume discussion.

Carly: I was thinking about buying a bunch of tampons, and taking them and making oneof those bullet strap things so I could be ""Tambo."" 
Adie: Yeah, my friend was ""The Menstrual Avenger"" last year. 

And I figure out what I'd like to do for Halloween. Take a nightgown and put a bunch of pictures of Freud on it and be a ""Freudian Slip."" I love work!
</lj-cut>

Anyway, work on Friday was extremely uneventful. We had four things to do and only Erin and I were working. So we tested rats, I changed waters and handled the new guys (and make more FAKE injectors), and left right as they were being sac'd.

And swimming was fun. More workoutness and Edwin was there. And he talked pretty much the whole time. And then Deb showed up and took pictures of me swimming for Senior photos. Then washed hair (gasp!), changed and headed out to get non-water related photos taken. And Katrina wasn't in Seattle (or Florida! Gotta love hurricanes) so she did my hair/make-up. Took some studio photos and some photos by the River. V. fun. 

Then took Katrina with us to dinner because it's her birthday today. It was like eight when we got to the restaurant and we still had to wait (only for like five minutes, but STILL!), so we didn't get out of there and home until 10:30, at which time TFR dictated I had to go to bed, so did not have a chance to call Brian back. I was SO hungry though. Curse popular restaurants!

And today I have been half doing homework and half reading the books I bought at B&N in June.

Well, I'm of with some Cortisone to cure Ed Roland's 7even Year Itch because I'm suffering 90s Alt Rock withdrawls.

Oh, and the new Switchfoot CD comes out Sept. 13th. Yay!"

"event","Okie, now, I do berlieve (yes, BERlieve), I previously left off right before I headed off to swimming on Friday. We started off with a ""work out,"" which was more a brief warm-up so we wouldn't be able to say we did nothing all practice. Then played this game that I ironically had never heard of until the TOK ""meeting"" the day before. V. intersting, but somewhat violent. Not quite water rugby though. Then got out and ate pizza at a party thing and had free swim until 6:30, which was spent playing the wonderful sport of WATER RUGBY! Huzzah. I got into two fights... before the first goal and lost track afterwards. And went up against Katrina. Uber huzzah.

Then left with parents to eat with the Stebbin's. You learn interesting things about families when you dine with them. It was fun; we all hard timed each other and Bryan and I pretty much would say the same things at the same time. I spent too much time around the pool.

Next day we decide to go to Stanich's AGAIN (this time with my grandpa and dad). We nearly got stuck on the bridge going south due to an accident, but avoided it. Got to the reastaurant and sat in the same spot we did the other day, coincidentally. Good food that place has! Anyway, headed home and actually DID get stuck nearing the bridge due to another accident. So spent 40 minutes driving two miles. Good times.

Got home, and discussed potential plans with parents and was eventually allowed to go to Jessica's party. Spent remainder of time reading (less than 50 pages left!) while parent's washed car. Left for party. It was so much fun; I knew a bunch of people. Swanson was there! I probably hugged her about fifty times. She was the last person I expected to see there next to Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great. Also saw Fred, Dani, just random Alki people. And yes, I DO have blond hair now (bloody chlorine). But good times with forks (because I don't NEED anyone to open a pop can for me!), rice (and lots of it!), randomness, harassing Brian, and all that sort of thing. Except he bit me! I don't know if I mentioned Johnny Depp or the Gonzaga basketball team at that point in time, but I believe I derserved it. Although Alyssa thinks he's a vampire. Hm, should look into that.

Eventually left the party to head to Alyssa's for a ""sleep""-over. Watched My Fair Lady. I love that movie, there's some great lines in it, most of which I've forgotten already, but stuff like ""Squashed cabbage leaf,"" ""Damn Mrs. Pierce, damn the coffee, and damn you!"" and the one that I can't remember about letting oneself know one is leaving. However, I can't watch the movie with out picturing the soundtrack with a Finnish accent or thinking about Sideshow Bob. Anyway afterwards we wrote songs such as ""Orange is the New Pink"" and ""The Color Or"" (thanks to Swany for the inspiration for the last one!). And we came up with band names such as ""Bruyenzeale,"" ""Wall Flour,"" ""Evil Like Frodo"" (which due to potential disasters with copyright laws became ""Evil Like 'Fro Dough"" and ""Evil Like Froo with an R"" I mean ""Evil Like Froo with an D"" I mean ""Evil Like Froo with a D"" which then inspired ""Froo and Andy"" and ""Froro""), and ""German Markers."" I also drew a picture of Kobi beef, it was a cow saying ""Mu."" Am so philosophical! Go racial minorities, I mean, me! And I have a great quote:

Me: You can only have things over your head, because you can't have nothing over your head or you'd be DEAD!
Alyssa: You're right... (pause). No, you're WRONG!

Well after songwriting, we talked for a bit and got to sleep at 3:30ish, and woke up at 7 as Alyssa did not turn off her alarm clock. Then rested and kinda slept until 9, when we got up, read our work (fun, fun!), and chilled until I was picked up. Then showered and attempted to scrub all the German marker ink off my arm (I remembered at 1 o'clock, and I write it down so I wouldn't forget, but if I saw Brian today it might have been suspicious...) and hand (Wrote ""LATE"" on fingers of right hand like Charlie. Because I love my hobbits!). Why is it I can rub Sharpie ink off my skin with just water but still have spots of washable ink on my hands? No idea, except swimming. Maybe I need chlorine... Still have ""LATE"" on hand...

Then left for lunch/shopping. Got a pair of black thongs (FLIP-FLOPS! Get your minds out of the gutter and back in school where they belong!) so I don't have to borrow my mom's shoes. Then home, talked to Brian, typed, and am off to read Kafka or sleep. Yay for running on 3.5ish hours."

"event","<P>So I got up yesterday to go to this TOK meeting because I needed to ask Andersen some questions. I left a half-hour early because I was tired of waiting for him to NEVER SHOW UP and I needed to get to work. V. frustrating. </P>
<P>So then at work I go to immediately test the rats, two of which turned out to be explosive. Bloody, stupid rats. Then cut some guides and talked with Victoria before leaving and taking the scenic route home.</P>
<P>Got home, left to hang out with Brian waiting for Jessica and Hallah to get back from Target. Went to Super Taco, went home dashed off to swimming.</P>
<P>Swam, did a quick relay, had a 100 Free competition (finished 8th, why is everyone so GOOD at Free?), taught little kids stuff, and left so I could go work on homework instead of play water polo because I didn't work on it after work. Brill plan, but went with mom to Little Italy and had yummy penne/prosuttio/sausage/chicken thing. Then home, off to get gas/pick up newsletter stuff. And home to wotk on homework and then pick up dad at the airport. Then slept.</P>

"event","Yesterday (All my troubles seemed so far away...)  
Okay, work was more randomosity stuuf as there was nothing to do. I think I've got a design now though. Hurray! (no, no ""Huzzah"" today).

Then drove home and my mom and I rushed out the door to the movie theatre. We saw ""Saint Ralph,"" which is some independent Canadian film that I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! It's easily the best movie I have seen all summer (yes, better than ""Charlie""). It's about this kid at a Catholic school (what is it with me and all the Catholic stuff recently?), Ralph< who is not what one would call ""saintly,"" but has a troubled home life (his dad's dead, his mom's in a coma), and feels that if he wins the Boston Marathon, it'll be a large enough miracle to wake his mom. V. cute character story. Only way to make it better? Have it be about swimming the English Channel and have Johnny Depp in it. It had good quotes on ANARCHY though. 

Then swimming (water polo!), home, hung out with Brian (finally finished Finding Neverland, and I almost didn't cry!) and read Kafka. Fun, fun. 

Okay so work was Cinderella tasks. Handle/weigh rats, check/change stylets, sweep up, design experiment, slice brains (does that sound sadistic or what?). Which I should start in two weeks. Gack.

Then left with mom to spend two hours eating burgers (no, still not Brian's family!). Because it takes 40 minutes to drive there, 40 minutes to get food and eat it, and 40 minutes back. But it was good. Stanich's = <3. 

Then read! I have no idea where this book is going, especially since I already know how it ends. I just don't know how it GETS there. 

Then swimming. Mason is so bloody funny. We did ""workshops"" today (Shari for breaststroke (~sarcasm~ good combo), Mason for fly, Jake for starts, Alex for backstroke). So during Mason's workshop we had the following quotes:

Mason: Cuddling is like swimmming.

and 

Mason: You need to think while you swim or you'll be like squash. You'll be bleh. You'll be pudding. And pudding can't swim well. At all. (You really needed the facial expressions and gestures for this one!)

And then we did Bryan's hair. Because the water worls like gel, so we spiked it. Quotes:

Me: Bryan, I want you're hair!
Bryan: I want my hair too. Oh wait, I HAVE it!

and...

Bryan: I feel like a movie star. (Girly pop princess voice) ""Somebody do my hair!"" (Suddenly) EDWARD SCISSORHANDS! (Holds up index and middle fingers like scissors)
Me: Johnny Depp! He's hot!
Bryan: I'm HOT!

We then proceeded to argue with Nicole, because she thought Johnny was ugly and Orlando Bloom was hotter. Bloody freshmen.

Yeah, and after the workshops we played water polo. I got into a couple fights and was held underwater. That's my favorite part! Am so crazy. Go me!

Anyway, home, played around on the computer, ate, talked to Liz for a bit, which was nice, considering I haven't talked to her since she left and have been getting reports from Brian, talked to Brian while talking to Liz, finished my Phish Food, which was more than 3/4 of a pint, and walked Lady. Now off to finish my freakishly long Kafka chapter because the fat lady of Bono's inner opera is singing, so this post is OVER."

"event","Okay, work was not too exciting. Handled some rats (yes, you're still harassed, Tim!), changed water, cut stylets. Fun. But I only have to come in until UNO the rest of summer. Huzzah!

So then returned home, ordered some swim stuff, read The Trial. 

Went to swimming. We had an actual WORK OUT!!! Wha???

Then off for some Americanized Asian and Mexican food. At Chili's. It's the farthest my mom has ever driven. V. impressive.

Then home, walked Lady, and off to HOMEWORK! Or water the rocks in my head, they're thirsty.

And ha! Will be seeing movie tomorrow. Not sure whar, but am excited."

"event","Okay, so woke up, read a bit (14 page paragraph = RAR!), got ready, headed to Chipotle, picked up pictures (from as far back as June), went to ICR. Hung out at home for a bit, went mini-golfing with parents and Brian, headed home to eat, watched the Simpsons episode where Homer and Bart convert to Catholicism, walked dog, and watched Spanglish (see sublect line). Found the Catholic bit amusing after the Simpsons. Exciting day.

Edit!

So expanding this a bit to really talk about said day. Because I was kicked off. V. sad.

Anyway, I woke up, and my parents called me in to watch ""the greatest acting performance of all time."" Meaning Dan Marino in Ace Ventura. He would have made Orlando Bloom, Emma Watson, and Hayden Christiansen proud. Ironically, I turned my radio on later and Hootie and the Blowfish were playing. So I had ""I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry"" stuck in ly head. Fun.

And we went to this golf shop owned by our neighbors, and apparently some nearby stores got robbed. V. scary.

But that was about it."

"event","Yeah, the subject line is from today. But as things must go in chronological order we won't start there now, will we?

Thursday - Drove. A lot. Stopped by Brian's crazy suggestion for a burger place. It was pretty good; not In-N-Out or Stanich's good, but still good. The milkshake was great, which was particularly good, as my favorite milkshake place in Spokane closed recently. V. sad. But it was chocolate peanut butter and you needed a vacuum to eat/drink it, whatever you'd call consuming the thing. But since I did not have a vacuum, I used a spoon instead. 

Drove some more. Stopped to look at some Freddie's (we go on vacation, and my dad works!). The radio stations between Boardman and the Tri-Cities were REALLY GOOD. After eating, we heard ""Good Riddance"" (and the DJ actually announced the name of the song at the end. I've never heard of anyone say they knew the name of it, and most DJs don't even talk about the music. Stupid radio. Anyway...), ""Forever"" (one of the BEST SONGS EVER! I sang. I knew I shouldn't have, because I cried. Stupid sentiments!), ""Here Is Gone,"" and then heard ""You and Me"" (still shocked they didn't at least play it at Spring Fling, as it was the theme, but they were probably afraid that one crazy girl in the Asian dress would get so excited and start moshing, scaring away all the couples that immediately magnitize whenever a somewhat slow/romatic song is played. Crazy girl in the Asian dress). V. good music.

Anyway, after hours of driving, arrived in Spokane, got to hotel, finished first chapter of The Trial, and slept.

Friday - Woke up, got ready. Went to Gonzaga. We hadn't eaten, so we asked where to go, and the tour guy suggested a bagel place a bit off campus, so TFR left to get bagels. Half the tour left before they got back, but they arrived before our half left. And yet again, our guide was incredibly funny. At GU there's this wall with loads of pictures from WAAAY back so it's essentially a never-ending yearbook. One of the older photos shows the football team, so the tour guides talking about how they had a football team, but cut it after WWII because everyone was off to war. He then says ""And we've been undefeated ever since."" V. amusing. I'd be interseting to go to a school without football, because football is just so ""American."" But then again, I'm not there for the football team; I'm there for the academics, where did you think I was going with that? ; )

Anyway, I really liked the GU tour. Scandalous stories, funny guide, and I got a lot of information. Heck, I was expecting to pull up and see a basketball team (not that that would have been a bad thing!). But it was cool. And if I went there I'd get free basketball tickets, which is good because they're sold out for the next six years. 

Anyway, after the tour, I spoke with the Assistant Dean of Admissions. Not to brag, but it pretty much went ""Gonzaga <3 Ash."" If I apply Early Action, she's going to pull strings to get me to this weekend visit thing where they take 50 applicants and give out a bunch of scholarships (including 2 full-rides!). But it was cool. I liked it a lot.

Then over to bookstore, because EVERY one wanted a sweatshirt and we had a coupon. I love touring!

So then ate lunch at one of my favorite Spokane area restaurants. It's Italian, of course! They have yummy pizza. And they had TK Black Cherry Soda! Heck yes!

Off to Whitworth. The campus is gorgeous. Loads of trees, just amazingly lovely. But the tour wasn't really informative; you didn't hear much about the academics, just about how Christianity-centered it was. It's nice and all, but I need more. It was weird, because they talked more about the religious bit than the people at GU, and Gonzaga's a Catholic school. But I have a v. good chance at a scholarship there too, so not ruling it out.

And the other weird thing was that GU's so much larger and it's smallest class size was 45 because that was the largest classroom, but Whitwoth's was 150. How can you have a class that size at that small of a school? It was weird.

Anyway, talked to the swim coach (one thing bad about GU, it only has club swimming), and he basically said I need to drop time if I want to contribute. Doesn't bother me to much, as I'd be going in as a young freshman or a REALLY, REALLY young sophmore. 

So as for colleges I've toured so far it ranks:

1. Willamette (It has an actual swim team, and I love the Millstreaming thing)
2. Gonzaga (I was impressed. A lot more than a basketball team)
3. Whitworth (I'm not ruling it out, but the tour focused so much more on the Christianity aspect than the actual ""This-is-the-place-you-will-be-learning-stuff"" college stuff. But they're PIRATES, which is cool)
4. OSU (Ack. It be big)

<lj-cut text=""And now a bit of a rant...""> So I'm interrupting my Friday update to rant. Yes, I do this occasionally. 

On both tours there were COUPLES touring. And at Whitworth there were only three students (including myself) touring. I can't stand that, I mean, it's great you've got someone and all, but you shouldn't base going to college solely on the fact that your boyfriend/girlfriend is going there. What if you break up and realize you don't LIKE the school? Yes, you can transfer, but it's still a lot of work that could have been avoided. This is part of why I have so vehemently opposed dating in high school (yeah, I'm currently a hypocrit. Sue me). Either you go to seperate colleges and split up, go to the same college and split up and then have to spend a lot of time with your new ex, or, my personal favorite, enroll in the same college and split up AFTER the May 1st deadline and end up going to a school that probably wasn't your first choice. But I'm not completely cynical, the whole thing could work out, but then it could probably work out regardless of whether or not you attended the same college, and if you split up going to the same college, you would have spilt up going to different colleges anyway. Bottom line: Don't pick a school based on who's going there. Stupid couples. </lj-cut>

Then shopped at Costco to kill time (bought spiffy sweatshirt!) and off to the person who got us our rabbits. She has SO many bunnies; they're so cute! And several cats (one was Omish; it had seven toes!). And she said she'd give me a job if I went to school there. Yes!

Then back to hotel and off to change for nice dinner. Had best creme brulee ever. Yum

Hotel again, went to pool but it was to crowded so sat in hot tub. This guy came in wearing a pirate shirt, and was apparently checking me out. Taken sorry. Probably scared him off when I left and had put my Commie t-shirt on. Heh, was going for the ""punk""/extreme leftist look 'cause I had been wearing a name tag too. Am so weird!

Then another chapter of The Trial and slept.

Today - Woke up, ate breakfast, left to visit family friends (well, dad's friend, Tim, and his family, but we like them all). Talked about colleges, LOTR, Montana, a bunch of stuff. This is where the subject line is from, we'd been talking about how Tim couldn't eat fresh fruit so his son says ""Can you eat old fruit?"" It was amusing. Then left there and on the road. read The Trial and listened to my mom read GoF to my dad as he drove because he'll never finish before the movie comes out at the rate he's going. Then ate, picked up Miata (we'd dropped it off for a sealent) and home.

And that's it. My advice, don't get run over by parked cars when buying pineapples at the paint shop."

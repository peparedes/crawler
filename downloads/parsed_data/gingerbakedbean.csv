"event","i really need to go on here more i think.  well guys how are you all? so much has happened since i have last updated this so i think i should start writing in here more often so its easier to remember things.  hmmmm well i had a boyfriend for a month in like august/ september.  he broke up with me for my best friend so i was not too happy bout that.  i'm at south downs now not 6th form and although i liked it at 6th form cause of all the friends i made, south downs is so much better. i have learned more at south downs than i did for the whole year at 6th form which just is not right.  but oh well.  im the only girl in my class and so that makes the rest of the class consisting of 16 guys. hmmm. any one else feeling weird bout that?  oh well. then there was what happened on monday. it was cool in the way that i got a lift home in a police car but not in the way that i was scared shitless the whole time.  my friend got in a fight with her dad's new gf who used to be her best friend.  her dad's new gf has only just turned 18 and her dad is 39. and not only that its rumored she is now pregnant. eww.  there are just some things that should not happen and that is one of them.  well anyway other than that i have been having a great time.  except for the bad week that i had in september.  it all started when my ex broke up with me on the wednesday, thursday was just a rubish day cause all of guys in my class were just talking bout their gf's and i was just like humph. i couldnt exactly tell them to shut up cause it was like 17 against 1 at the time cause one guy left midway.  lol.  then on the friday my grandmother died and then found out that the guy who broke up with me still liked me and also another one of my ex's. 

some how i have managed to keep my head up even with all this and so much more going on but i dont really remember much else but hey. what i dont understand is how bad things like this all tends to go off at like one time.  i still dont have any idea what im going to be doing for my 18th birthday though.  im thinking about having a party but i dont know where i should have it or maybe we should all just go out somewhere like clubbing in portsmouth or something i dunno.  i never have been good at thinking of these sort of things.  lol. well i have now up dated this so i think i shall go now.

bye :D"

"event","i know this is stupid but i feel old and im not even 17 yet well i will be in like just over 5 days. im feeling really insecure about loads of things lately i dont even know where to begin and i have practically stopped eating because of it. this is crazy i know but hey its me im just an insecure person and it all kinda started in blooming march when this whole thing with my neighbours and their psychotic dad all blew up and it has only just finsihed. that is like 6 months long and everything and now i think that now that i have helped a couple stay together because they like each other that we managed to save one persons well being and everything cause her mum was abusing her and then sent her miles away just because of whom she was dating and then she ran away and had to go home even though she was scared stiff and the police didnt help much by lying that she was happy when we said that if she wanted out to bang on the wall and she very nearly banged a whole in the wall and then she ran away again and now she lives with her boyfriend and all that and now i never see them although i got her out of the house alive basically cause she was starving herself and threatening to commit suicide and i was their means of contact as they were not allowed to talk to each other and now i get no thanks and they verbally abuse me from afar although i think its their idea of a joke and then they come up to me and say that my ex has a crush on me still and wants a long term relationship with me and every thing but i dont feel the same way or anything and he keeps coming round and im always in my room and i see him sitting outside talking to my neighbours but staring at my window the whole time and never stops talking bout me but when i go to the window he does a runner and when my neighbours suggest calling for me he stops them but apprantly when some one says a bad thing about me they get a bollock in from him and although he asked me out and i said no im just confused about what i feel cause i did regret breaking up with him and everything but i have never been out with a guy 2 only once and this will be a new thing for me to do and a long term relationship? am i reall ready for that? i mean he is cool and all but the last time i saw him he wouldnt talk to me at all only to my friend but he wouldnt stopo staring at me but then again i had just walked miles and miles and some running in extreme heat looking for one person and not finding her even though we went into every shop looking for her in waterlooville, cowplain, cosham and portsmouth and also we went to sandy brow in crrokhorn, crookhorn park, another field in crookhorn and the woods next to it, the park by southdowns where people have been shot by an airgun and we even went to portsdown hill and fielders park in purbrook and purbrook heath and everything. we went round everyone of her friends houses and no one answered and that is at least 30 people. its not like we didnt try to find her or anything then we went to see my ex and he has changed so much. he no longer works in macdonalds but now works mornings at morrisons and he has grown, stopped doing drugs and cut back on his drinking although he still smokes like a chimney *sigh* my life is never simple. i have a party to go to on saturday, a supposed date on monday, a massive long walk on tuesday, my birthday on wednesday, thursday till the 12th is spent being tormented by sisters and parents and friends who seem to be superglued together at the mouth and are inseperable like totally big time who say that i only moan and i know that i have been grouchy lately but thats cause i get no sleep, have no energy and really hot no matter what with nothing to do except cook clean and go hunting for missing persons when im not giving statements to the police and arguing with parents and siblings whilst thinking ill of one person whom shall remain unnamed although i still like him i think as more than a friend whilst helping others who have just broken up with their boyfriends or girlfriends and then giving advice to other people who have no sense of hygiene and then trying not to get into punch ups with next door neighbours whose heads are so far up their asses its any wonder that they know what the sun looks like. well moaning streak over i shall go now and do some tidying up cause their doesnt seem to be anything else to do as it is too late to bake another cake although i think that i have baked enough cakes. 12 over the past 2 days. bubi"

"event","bull dog the most violent game i know. i have bruises which have bruises in turn and i very nearly had one eye clawed out by adam and the same eye very nearly became black but instead is just bruised. *sigh* why did i suggest that game yesterday? but i am in a very good mood otherwise. i played basketball with shay, hannah and shanna and i found a little pink and white bunny soft toy which has now been named ted short for tedina :P lol. the first gama of basket ball i was with shay and we won 20:2 and the second game i was with shanna and we lost 10:2 but we couldnt finish off the game because hannah had to go home and babysit her 3 very annoying brothers although they can look after themselves for an hour and even then they had only needed to be babysat for 5 mins *sigh* but oh well never mind it was fun any way as we ended up very muddy as the ball kept going into the puddle on the court and then off of the court into the bog-like grass and we went to the co-op on stakes road caked ink mud and recieved very many funny looks which was funny as we did the same on friday we went to the co-op caked in mud but not as much as yesterday as on friday we only played bull dog in the rain which was funny as hannah kept ending up eating mud lol. yesterday was good until little rob from next door and steven, who used to live down the road but then got evicted, came out and join in our game of touc and run. then last night after steve and rob dissappeared (thank god), marly and chelsea came out as well and by this time it was like 6 at night so we played bull dog and i ended up having to give chelsea a piggyback across the green instead she decidedto strangle me *sigh* and i found it very hard to breathe but going out the game at that point would have been suicide as every one would have thought that i was just going out of the game because i had been caught out so carry on i did or i would never have heard the end of it and carrying on was teh funniest thing that i did as we then did horses and i flattened shanna who is a hell of alot stronger than i am which was funny. i suppose that if you hurt others then your bound to get hurt yourself and karina wouldnt link arms with jordan just because he was a guy who had a crush on her and then they forfitted so it was just shay and dan left who then did single chains on knees which was total suicide as it was now like 13 of us against 2 people and we managed to get dan out no problem and there were like 3 of us holding shay back from getting even halfway across the green and even then we only just managed to get him out and that was with 14 of us *sigh* and i guess that you lot think im some kinda weirdo who goes around playing little kiddies games and naming teddys and other soft toys and i guess that some of you dont even know how to play bulldog so i am just gonna shut up and sign of tataaa ;)"

"event","i like 2 guys. a friend of mine called paige asked one of them out for me and he said that there was no way in hell that he would go out with me again. another friend of mine called dan was the one who started it all by bringing up shay's and my relationship a while ago and said sorry for bring up the topic of such a horrendous nature. does this mean that shay really actually hates my guts and doesnt want to even look at me? am i really that horrendous? i am just so upset just thinking about it is making me cry *sobs* and now im finding it hard to type because of the tears. i just never have been lucky in that department and then shay asked why i wont ask the other guy i like out but i was thinking bout it earlier today but i couldnt because i know what the answer is most likely gonna be. no. the story of my life. 
Janine:Hey i was wondering if you would go out with me?
Guy:sorry but im already seeing some one
or
Guy:sorry but im not looking for any one right now
or
Guy:i would never date you even if you were the last person on the earth.

these are only the most common rejections used. now you know why i was looking depressed earlier lu. thats the reason why i said that the reason why im looking depressed is not because it may happen, but because it most likely wont happen. i cant ask him out either because if i do and he rejects me, i dont know what ill do. i just wont be able to handle it. and the likelyhood of him actually saying yes is very small because that is just my luck. every guy i ask out says no. there has never been an exception either. N-E-V-E-R!!!!!!! so thats why i never ask anyone out any more even though mark f-w asked him out for me in like january/december and even then it was a no so what would have changed his mind over like 3/4 months? it is just so depressing :'( i think that i had better go now or im just gonna get so depressed bout it and end up in a worse state than i am in now although i should feel better tomorrow or only one can hope.

"event","ive been getting pissed off over the slightest thing recently but i dont know why and because i dont know why im getting pissed off even more so. im never aloud out after dark even though we are in the street which is a cul-de-sac so its not like cars are going to be racing through it as there is only one entrance and exit and there is no way that any weirdo is going to walk into the street from somewhere else either because there are houses at either end of the street so for the weirdo to get into the street via either end of the street, they would have to climb over fences from somebody elses back yard and the fences are high as it is. so we would be able to see if some weirdo is coming towards us. and there is always at least 5 of us out there at one time so its not like we are going to be on our own so it is even more unlikely that somebody is going to attack us aswell. *sigh* im 16 i can look after myself and besides i have been in plenty of fights so its not like i cannot protect myself from people who are older and stronger than i. 

is the way that i talk really weird or something because fallon and paige both said that i talk funny. not at all like how they talk which is like really common. *sigh* am i really so weird that they pick up on little things such as how i talk and act. i mean yeah sure i dont blame fallon for disliking me a little as a little while back when ever i was seriously pissed off and she tried to stop me from walking out of the street i had managed to whack her in the eye, nose and mouth. all on seperate occasions of course but still i did it. but we are still friends as she has always gotten me back by nearly breaking my arm. i never hit her really hard mind but the fact still remains that i am violent. Hello from sarah! lol i havent always been so violent but it has just become part of my nature now and i dislike it alot. luke, simon, and ross are all scared of me because last year in year 11 i was always hitting them when they pissed me off. i hate it sooo much but i cant change it because i have been like this since like april 2001 when i had been there for a couple of months. stressssss i hate that too. thats another trigger which pisses me off also and i realised that in year 10 when my dad was sent out to iraq. found out then that he very nearly got himself blown up by a mortar only the mortar didnt reach where he was which was in the base which is surrounded by miles and miles of an airfield runway. then i found out that when he was in kosovo when i was in year 6, he nearly got shot in the head by a rebel and this was in peace time too. but now my dad has retired from the T.A and that is the end of my litle moaning streak and i feel much better for it now so ill see ya later but not until ed and fran has had their little say *sigh* hi from ed! i think ill hijack the keyboard too, just because i thought i'd say that i was impressed with ed's typing cause he had to type with his crutches...literally! ok, his typing is much better than mine so ill stop now and let Janine type.....love Fran!!"

Shay knows alot about me just not everything. and then again he makes it his business to know everything about me. he asks my family all these different questions about me and then they tell him being my family and all. we get on so well me and shay. i feel that i can tell him anything and everything and the reason that he doesnt know everything bout me is because even my family doesnt know everything bout me. so the only way that he would be able to find out those things would be if he were to ask me himself but the liklihood of those subjects actually ever coming up in a conversation is like nil so there will always be something that he doesnt know about me but hey saying that they will come up in conversations somehow someway so he will eventually know everything bout me. oh well."

All i can say is that the instability is one hundred percent accurate. i am so instable that my parents are always having a go at me for it. i am also not very confident. i cannot believe how right it is that is just plain scary really. yikes!! just looking at it is making me really depressed.:("

How ironic is this? my hair is red!!!! that was a lot of use but oh well. i know that it is bright red or even proper red because its more of a dark gingery colour but it is more brown than some peoples. and another thing, i do not have the biggest personality around, im not sassy or a smart alec. im the complete opposite. *sigh* all i need to do now is that similar minds thing. well see ya!!"

"event","I am so bored it is so unbelievable. there has been nothing to do, my parents are arguing again even though they keep denying it because they dont want us kids to get upset about it. it is just stupid though. my head is totally messed up because my friend shay has just told me like yesterday that he really likes me and that he may like me more than a friend and of course i have always had a soft spot for him since i first met him. he is like really kind and considerate and he always seems to know what i am going through. he is always trying to help me through my problems which is really cool of him, and he always seems to get me through the hard times. i still think that his ex was really harsh to dump him the day before his 18th birthday and then text him 4 days later to say that she now has a new boyfriend and she even sent him a picture of her and her new boyfriend getting off with each other. how lairy is that. i some times wish that shay and i didnt have that arguement when we did a couple of years ago because then he and amy wouldnt have started going out and then he wouldnt have gotten hurt so badly. we had an arguement when we both liked each other so much that we were very close to going out. we werent talking for so long that he eventually got over me and started going out with amy, and now he got really hurt. i told him once we started talking again that he was going to get really hurt from her. but he never listens to me when i say something nasty bout amy. well he does now and he even joins in. his sister really hates amy now because of what she did to him. and to be honest i cant really blame her. she even started to beat amy up when she last came to the street which was actually really funny to see and then amy got a lift back home from her new boyfriend and then 5 minutes later the police came and when there was no fight they just went away again. but oh well it could have just been their regular check up on the street cause they always seem to be called out to our street for one thing or another usually because some people are fighting over one thing or another. some times because of burgularies and the owner is left for dead after being beaten half to death. but hey i live in purbrook what do you expect. any way im gonna have to sign off because there is nothing else to talk about or anything bye"

"event","well so much for going round my step cousins for the night. sheesh. i was meant to met them at the school that they go to but they thought that it would be a good day to bunk off school so their mum didnt bother coming to the school and i dont even know where they live so i couldnt exactly walk there either.all i know is that they live in warren park. sheesh. any way i am so tired cause all i have been doing for the past couple of days is tidying up and oh boy w my room in need of tidying up.i couldnt even see the floor!! how is it that i always manage to let it get really bad like that? i mean i try to tidy it up like every single day but that is like impossible for me. not only that i have been worrying bout haslar tomorrow :S so thats gonna be scary. if it turns out that i do have cancer my whole xmas is gonna be ruined. R-U-I-N-E-D. but it would not be ruined if they said that it isnt cancer. hmm but what happens if they dont know what it is? that would totally suck. oh well. i cant really change it can i? unless of course i heal from like major illnessess really easily like that guy who suppossedly had aids but he doesnt have it any longer. what he should have done is to have had a second opinion done that way he could at least have made sure if he had aids or not. i think that if haslar say that i do have cancer that i will go and have a second opinion done somewhere just to make sure. cancer, aids, major illnessess. hmm depressing topics so i think that ill change the topic some how.
       it it only like 5 more days till christmas day. how cool is that! which makes it only like 11 days till we are living in the year 2006. scary thought really. and then i would only have another year and a half till i turn 18. that would mean that i could buy alcohol with ID of course which is so damn anooying. o well i cant change the law which sucks even more but i would be able to vote. OH MY GOD!!! there would be so much that i would be able to do like move out from here, my parents home, i could get a full time job, i could get married without my parents consent. i think that i am gonna like being 18. i could drink alcohol in a pub and not just plain old cola with a lemon slice in it. i cant wait till im 18 now. well im gonna have to toddleoo  out of here because i have some stupid errands to do for my parents now oh joy of joys. (but at least i know a christmas carol in sign language now :P )"

"event","well today was the last day of college. its a good thing because i will be able to rest and try to beat my insomia but its a bad thing because then i dont get to see all of my friends till next year:( not only that with it being the 15th today it means that i have 5 days, 16 hours and 18 minutes till i go to haslar oh joy of joys of the world. this is gonna be a bad xmas i can tell but that might just be my anxiety talking. any way moving back onto what i was saying. the last day. the upper school xmas concert was crap and i missed the lower school one because i was talking and i didnt realise that every one had gone on yup to the lower school concert which lke totaly sucks so i couldnt support friends. i saw a video but that isnt as good as actually being there so i dont know but apparantly the lower school one was better than the upper school one which i can believe.  i still dont understand how you would purposely nearly fall of the stage ian that is just going a bit too far dont you think? well i am really sorry that i missed it but i cant turn bck time which sucks because then i would redo so many things like not going out with my ex boyfriend james or checking with shay if it was true that he wanted to break up with me or not going out with pete the two-timing git humpfh. i still havent forgiven him for that and i dont think that i ever will either coz that was just wrong. *shudders* oh well all is in the past and i dont see how looking back on your mistakes is a fun thing to do tohru's mum. and i know that i laughed when i read the saying ""looking back on your tears will make you laugh but looking back on your laughs will make you cry"" but i never realised that that is so true. i feel so foolish for not believing it. i think that one of my new years resolutions would be to take advice like that more seriously in the future. thats a point i think that i should start thinking bout the year 2006. like what ill be getting people for christmas and birthdays and everything and like how i will be getting job and saving my money to learn how to drive. i know the basics and everything but i am still confused bout somethings like the 'highway code' i need to learn :S im starting to think that i know absolutely nothing about anything which is actually a really depressing thought. hmmm. i think that my new years resolutions are gonna be some thing like help out more around the house, learn self- defense and try to be able to run faster (coz you never know when that would be neccessary) i also think that i will try to be more organised and kinder and try not to be so violent towards friends and that i should think before i act/ say anything because in the past couple of days i have been really hurtful towards others without really meaning to. 
any way new subject. i am gonna be going round my step cousins for night tomorrow YAY!!! i get to see billy again and kayliegh and also jamie. apparantly billy and jamie are more behaved now that they have moved out from ade and his kids house cause connor was such a little shit but that may be because of his ADHD but then agian jamie has ADHD and he isnt as bad as connor and its the same with billy but when they are round other kids with ADHD they are really really bad. but they are as good as gold at school bless them. billy is only three and he knows every swear word in the book and he is proud of it too but he is slowly learning that that language is not acceptable in general society but the occassional swear word slips out from his mouth. but oh well. kayliegh can be a bitch but ive known her for like years and years and ive known jamie and billy all of their lives. their mum was staying round here (and jamie) when she was pregnant with billy and it had to be in the middle of the night when my dad was away with the T.A. that she decided to go into labour. so my sisters, jamie and i ended up going round my aunties for like the rest of the night whilst my mum went to St Ricards with Ktreana the mum to give birth. and once again i have side tracked and now i have forgotten what it was that i was talking about and so i am just gonna go. i think that ill go to bed now coz i am absolutley shattered

"event","all i can say is that college today has cheered me up terribly coz like all of my friends were in happy moods and their happy moods are contagious coz when they r happy i am happy but when they r sad i am sad although i try not to show it so that may be they could cheer up a lil. it never works mind you but hey its always worth a try.  my ear is still ringing from when mrs hoar (the scary bitch) rang her bell really loudly in my ear in general studies to try and shut everyone up.  it only succeeded in hurting my ear tho. her and her blooming bell so A-N-N-O-Y-I-N-G. lesson 1 (english literature) was fun coz we did no work.  instead we had a party and played articulate  and the team i was on came first (YAY) but lesson 3 (IT) as a downer coz we had to do our coursework (damn you miss crane) *sigh* general studies was okay seeing as we went from being last to coming second out of 10 groups in quizs. you know the umm whatch call it Pub Quiz that's it.lol. we got 30, the team who came 1st got 35 and the 3rd and fourth teams got 25 whilst the 5th got 20 and the rest got 15, 10, 5 and 0 points. they could not get any right. but i must admit some of the questions were hard like ""who created Thomas the Tank Engine"" how or why would we know that? that is like the most useless piece of knowledge possible but i found out that it was some one called ""Reverand Oriean"" or sumink like that any way. see. useless knowledge. there was another like who was the fmous welsh person who starred in 3 different films which i cannot remember. how is any one meant to get that hey? apparantly it was some one really famous and none of us had ever heard of them. if only they had asked sumink like 'who sung 99 red balloons' or 'who sung intergalactic laxative' the person who sung 99 red balloons was nina ? (i can never remember her surname) and the person who sung intergalactic laxative was donovan.*sigh* i never seem to know the answers to the questions asked today but i seem to know the answers to some of the old songs.  they are actually quite good songs even though i cant remember the words or tune to intergalactic laxative but i can remember part of the tune and words to 99 red ballons. well my stroppy sister wants me to help with like all of her chores and if they are not done then my parents are gonna kill us *sigh* so terrible to die an early death. or maybe it isnt hmmmmm i my never know but then again i may know sooner than i think if i keep on agitating my parents like i am :P

"event","well all i can say is that parents are the most complicated organism on the planet they are more complicated to understand than boys if you can believe it. yesterday my parents could have started world war 3 on their own but today they were as if they had only just married. freaky. my mum has decided not to leave which is good and my dad has vowed to change so that he is no longer a miserable git. hmmmm (did someone exchange them with pod people? or have i accidentally gone to an alternative reality????) but i betcha anything that they go back to arguing and having my mum throw plates at my dad by this time next year.  i suppose i can see why they are on edge like all of the time because it is christmas and christmas is actually a really stressful time for parents all over the globe well it is if you never have any money that is and if you have children tooo. this is just toooo weird tho. in summer we are always going out as a family (not that us kids have any say mind but oh well) and having fun but when it comes to christmas it is always ""SMASH"" ""BANG"" ""OW THAT HURT"" ""SERVES YOU RIGHT FOR BEING A MISERABLE GIT"" so on so forth. it does get really depressing sometimes though and im thinking that my mum and dad are getting annoyed with having to buy plates every christmas i order to replace the ones which have been smashed to smithereens in the kitchen.*sigh* oh well so long as they always talk to each other and not argue as much then i guess im just gonna have to be happy. and ben, mark, katie STOP TELLING ME TO GO OUT WITH ED im too messed up in the head right now to do so and there is no way that i am ready to have a boyfriend as of yet. i have james to thank for that the ass hole that he is for dumping me on my birthday :( how sad and hrsh is that but oh well. i would never in a million years dump somebody on their birthday cause that is just harsh or even the day before their birthday cause that is harsh also. poor poor shay. amy is soooo harsh for doing that really just before he turned 18 tooo. boredom levels high, stress levels high, happiness levels low but getting higher for a change but soon enough i bet that they are going to seriously plummet right back down again. its my luck it always happens
well toodleoo i have to go now bye

"event","where do i begin.....
No school friday!!! i worked from 3-9 then i came home and talked to jarrod foley... we decided we were going to go to Wendys and get some food. on our way home.... Josh Mac called me and told me i needed to get my ass over to his party. i went home finished my food jarrod left and i headed over there. Everyone was there!!!!! JMoore was being nice for a while until he ran right to Gail... Iszy was there and we finally met and talked. around like 2ish we decided that dunkin donuts was sounding pretty damn good so i was the only one able to drive so i brought josh and iszy in his wip. we tried to make it loud and clear that we were leaving but jmoore wasn't paying attention so we just left. but the time we got back he was gone! yah he left with out saying bye... a whole!!!
So then the next night Jmoore invited me to another party it was at SEan Nomidans house. iszy told me he was picking me up and we were going to get josh and go.... well.... josh had to work and luke didn't want to come. Margret was a my house with bob and pauline. so me and Iszy went to the party. around 11ish we went picked up luke and went to see josh. Jmoore was at the door when me and iszy walked out so of course he had a conipsion fit!! o man!! 
yesterday iszy came into my work told me he bought be something because it reminded him of me. he told me to take his keys and to go to his car. when i got to his car i opened the door and there in the car was a beautiful pink rose! i was so stunnd i was astonished. i couldn't believe it, it was soo sweet i wanted to cry. I went inside and of course said thank you. Shanell looked at us both like she was pissed of or something... Jealous! i mean.... 
after work sammi slept over. we went to wendys and I went to see iszy. Jmoore drove by saw my car there and called me later on. he slyly called and asked all about my night. i told him how i went to wendys and saw amanda and drove by shanells party. i didn't tell him that i stopped by joshs though. i didn't lie though i just left it out. well this morning when i talked to him he was pissed and thought i lied to him and he's so furious he wouldn't talk to me. Its crazzy because i need  to talk to him!!!!!!!!!! its a need!
I wrote him a 9 page note earlier and right now i'm going to go deliver it.... ttyl."

"event","we had no school today! yipppeee!! a four day weekend!

yesterday i had to work. it was me, cassie amanda cramm and kimm. we got at exactly 9 oclock.... we were done mopping before nine and ready to go, it was great.  it better be like that tonight too! i cleaned everything while cassie sat there and talked to everyone and anyone. 

Around 11ish JMoore came over to show me his new Cd player he installed. Its crazy! its like a 400 dollar cd player that sounds incredibly nice!!!!!!! its got this lcd screen that shows like action pictures and it flipps down to eject the cd. he thought it was the one with the mp3 and thats why he bought it but turns out it wasn't so he was pissed... but its still the nicest thing ever. 

Today i got to go to work at 230 instead of 3 because nissa needs me to fill in for her. Sammi is working sometime tonight. either at 3 or at 6! I talked to her on the phone for a little while last night before i went to bed but nick called so she switched over. 

Jimmy Angelos is the Biggest FAGGOT i have ever met.... Jimmy i hope you rot in hell! Your the most immature fucker i've ever met! you back stab and turn shit around so you sound cool, well hunny we all know the truth your the one running around saying Olivia is fat and blamming in on Kacie.... Jimmy grow the fuck up you 4 foot 5 cock sucker!!!!!!!!!!! I WILL GET YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So anyways.....
JMoore is so confusing. He'll go a week without calling then call and be pissed cus i'm hanging out with jon and then he'll go another week with out calling then he'll call again and want to hang out and then he'll say how he misses me and he'll call then he'll send a text saying he can't call he's busy with his parents....(which is fine) then the next day he'll call and he'll be over and its just weird.  what the hell does he want???? He's been sending me text messages all day... Last nigh he was listening to slow songs in his car.... which deff isnt' like him?!!! they were love songs.... what is this some kind of sign? Damn it all tell me whats going on!!!!!!!!

JMAC is also confusing. he'll call everyday and be like ""baby i miss you so much i want to be with you all the time"". and then all of a sudden he won't call anymore. I'll call him and its like a breif conversation. nothing big. its like what kinda game is he playing? 

EVERY DAMN GUY IN THIS WORLD BLOWS BALLS AND IS CONFUSING. ARE THEY PLAYING GAMES OR DO THEY NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WANT? WHAT IS IT AND WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO DIFFICULT? WHY ME?

well i have to go to work in an hour so i will be back to finish later."

"event","Last night jarrod moore called and we talked for a little while and he ended up coming over around 9ish and we watched Passion of the Christ. it came out yesterday and he already bought it. Thinking about the movie makes me speechless.... I can't say it was a good movie because it wasn't but yet i can't say it was a bad movie because it deff wasn't!!! Its such a breath taker!

Ricky came over after school today and we hung out for a little while. haven't really hung out with him in a long time, it was kinda nice.

Later on i went over Jarrod Foleys house and we washed waxed and vacummed out my car. GOOD DEAL!!!!!!!!! lol. It was the first time in a couple months really talking to him, we weren't getting along very well before but now everything it good and it was actually a fun time. 

School blows already.... homework sucks! Seriously i don't think school would be that bad if we didn't have homework. I come home and i try to do it and its just so stupid and i don't get a thing it makes no sense what so ever!!!!!!! Physics blows balls as well as my english home work blew... Trig was easy and i got that done with no time.

Amanda Cramm and Erica P. were training today. Bev hired them because its not fair to  have me shane and chels working every night.... I am deff not working everynight. i dont' think i'm going to be able to work 3 nights a week. i think i'm going to keep it to a minium of like 2 and then weekends. school is so much harder this year and i really need to do well and work can't interfer!

Billy moved out to his dads today. I'm going to miss him like crazy! I guess he's coming home tomorrow until sunday though i deff. got to see him before he leaves for good. We were like best friends and hung out every night last year but then krystle started freaking out so we slowed that done to not talking at all. Jaci is going to miss him so much don't know how she's going to do. 

its 10:00 and i got to wake up at 6:00 so i'm out to bed."

"event","Well its deff. a sad day. Summer Vacation is officially over!!! And school begins in the morning. YAY i got to start waking up at like 6 in the am. fun fun! 
I am picking Tyson up tomorrow morning and bringing him to school, that means i'm going to be outta the house and ready for 650 o shit! thats early sense i haven't woken up before 10 at all this summer. and only woke up at 10 to go to work. Everyone from work plays sports so it will be me and chelsea and shane who can work. there is no way in hell that i'm going to work every day of the week! I can't do it!

Today i worked from 10-3 with jessi and Garnet. It went by pretty fast actually. I came home and talked to sammi for a little and i got this urge to go shopping for the rest of the stuff i needed for school. it started out as i didn't have any shirts to wear,cus i only bought long sleeves and sweaters and its been so hott latly i can't do that..... but then it turned out that i wanted to buy skirts because i love skirts latly. I called ricky a couple times to see if he wanted to go with me but no one answered so i asked kacie to go. We went into american eagle.... Aeropostale.... filenes....and then claires cus we saw my little cousin getting her ears peirced. I got two shirts in aero for a total of 17 dollars and i got two skirts and two shirts for a total of 40 dollars in filenes. I love the shirt its so cute. i think i'm going to wear it tomorrow! on our way home it started raining the sky was blacker then black. Ricky was at the car wash..... yah he was at the car wash in the rain! 
Last night i talked to Jarrod Foley on the internet for like 2 hours. we talked about alot and discused plans on our cars. it was good talking to him normally with out fighting for once. I called jon Mac right before i went to bed and he was still out and about. Hmmmmmmm. 
The info on JON MAC is:
in so many ways i like him, he makes me happy because he's so nice to me and all of his complements are overwelming. He's so sincere and he always listens. he's such a great guy. I'm never going to see him though and thats what keeps me from being with him. He got into some trouble and now he got his car taken away so i don't know when or how i'll be able to see him. He makes me so happy and always makes me smile but then when i think of how i was happy and how i won't be happy for a while cus i won't be able to see him upsets me. sometimes i just want to not call him and just move on but for some reason i can't.
School tomorrow :("

Last night i hung out with my love Samantha. Nick was at Matt Hawkins party and he didn't invite sam so we planned on going there and crashing it..... good thing we didn't cus it ended up being a football party and there was like 80 guys there nick said. Jon Mac :), Bob Kemp, and jons friend tyler all came over last night too. Jon was aloud outta the house!!! Me and Sam and kacie went swimming it was pretty warm and then we jumped on the trampoline and let me tell you it was slippery! The boys tried to get on but as usual i freaked out before they could i hate jumping on the trampoline with alot of people especially boys(i'm a whimp)THen we watching YOU got SERVED...Love that movie! I was supposed to go to the cories with Shane Benitezz yesterday but he decided to climb the mountain in the hundred degree weather.  Chels and Amanda and kyle stopped by yesterday on there way back from a BC. Chels tried going on the computer but she couldn't even type. Ricky B called about 5 times yesterday, he's living back at his moms house. i hope he got his head together and snapped out of it. I found out that he took Amanda virginity which is horribly seems how he says he don't remember. ahhhhh. piss me off! i don't see why i care though. 
The other night me and amanda cramm were at cumberlands and jarrod foley was there. talked to him for a couple minutes before jill fournier should up. they were hanging out or something. lol sad right.

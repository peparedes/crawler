"event","this year i kind of had no expectations to
do much for my birthday except work
and get myself a beer (or two)
but instead thanks to damian my beautiful
wonderful partner.. i had a wonderful
night of relaxation, sweetness, and hot tubbing..
and then he surprised me with a new midi controller
to use.. i am so excited for sunday and now
that i have a new weapon for music 
and i am even more so.

So all in all my journey into the next
year of my life has been awesome and
i am full of gratitude.

expectations are a prison 
and to go along with out them
can give you amazing results.."

"event","depression is hitting me kind of hard today.
i keep looking for distractions while being off work.
money is having a good play in it as we are trying
to make ends meet. 

we truly live the life of a couple of starving artists.
but fuck if we aren't trying our best to crawl out of this
hole. 

i love how im typing this entry while opeth is 
screaming/metaling out in the other room by way
of my roommates.

"event","life gets really real sometimes.

trying to hold shit together
can be a real challenge as an
adult. the key to success is 
problem solving brain ninja
style.

which sometimes, after some days
its kind of hard to do when your
mental energy is zapped.

in other non depressing news
i went out to dinner with
my boyfriend and his two
uncles. we had fancy expensive
middle to upper class
white people vietnamese food.
i wore ripped up black clothing 
and dirty bedhead hair.
thats all you get ya fuckin jellypuffs.

ANYHOW, we had a nice time
dinner was very delicious
(and thankfully free) and 
i got to have a nice long
nerd conversation with damians
uncle mark. we spoke alot about
walking dead. it was great.

came home to discover my roommate
spent all of today fixing our hottub.
it looks like a damn ufo.
The witch Haus just gets better and better.

okay well its time to go have a smoke
and snuggle down with the man half.

thing.. my past entries and seeing
the different versions of myself.
Granted i am internally the same
my brain contains the same soul
program.. but i see so many
death and rebirth versions of myself.

"event","Nothing to hide anymore i guess.

I experimented in hallucinogens recently
and i have found out a couple things
about me and them together, personally:

1) I really really really like the awake excited feeling
you get. Its like your a kid again and you got a big present
with a shiny bow just waiting to be ripped open. Except the
sensation of that just kind of sticks with me the entire time.

2)Being outside at night is very spiritual to me when experiencing it.

3)i wake up feeling normal the next day even tho im pretty sure
i killed about a billion brain cells doing it.

4)My abstracts have a WHOLE new meaning to them. Its really quite eerie, like
i somehow peered into the future!

Now this isnt something i would do on the regular..
but i have reached a point in my life where i am going to
make choices that are exciting to me. Kind of like
thrill seeking.  This being because i have live SO FUCKING LONG
feeling TRAPPED and SMOTHERED over and over in my life
so i never really had the freedom to dick around as much as i should have.

So. yes. im going to do shit that may or may not make people
lose ""respect"" for me.. but ultimately the question is: 

Do i need people around me that are going to make huge judgments on me
for living my life the way i want to, provided i still keep myself in check
and stay on top? the answer is no.

Because i know what the fuck im doing in my life.
I know who i am. and where i am going. and what i do and 
who i chose to associate with is of my entire choice.

The power of this life in this body, is mine. thanks.

And I would also like to add, that I have become happier
and more of a ""liker"" than a ""hater"" over time because life is
to precious and short to devote my valuable energy on bitter, ugly, hatefullness
in all of its forms.

Also, i have been keeping up with the aliens.

Also, i have embraced Burner culture and will be attending more events 
revolving around such.(and maybe even burning man if i ever can afford it)

Love you all. Life and everything."

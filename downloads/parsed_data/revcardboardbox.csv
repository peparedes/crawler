Then another two decades of increasing mental and physical deterioration before I die, quietly, alone, probably in some grotty pensioner flat in the unfashionable area of town.

Maybe I&#39;m too obsessed with that.

In the near year since I last posted, I started a new job. It&#39;s with <a href=""http://shedproject.co.nz"">http://shedproject.co.nz</a> which is a charitable trust giving the disabled and disadvantaged the dignity of meaningful work, as well as the male members some male contact. (After all, most caregivers are women.) In that time, we&#39;ve had to move into new premises, which are bigger, and right now we are trying, in the face of the Great New Zealand Inertia, to get a number of fundraising things going, including a &quot;maker&#39;s market&quot; and a charity store.

I actually managed to save a grand, and pay off my Visa, which now has to be paid off again.

I purchased a DJ controller for my birthday, some lessons on how to be a scratch DJ which aren&#39;t taking, Ableton Live 9 Lite, and a cheap second-hand netbook, not to mention a fancy new smartphone which has really helped the Shed Project over December. (As opposed to those incompetents at Vodafone!)

At the same time I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s going anywhere. I need to renegotiate my contract this week so that I get <i>paid.</i> It&#39;s one of those things that keeps getting put off because my boss is so damned busy. People prefer to just stare and wait for the price to go down rather than human up and contribute.

Retail. I cannot, it seems, escape retail.

Maybe I fixate on my remaining lifespan because I want it to hurry up. Hooray depression. Or being too hot in the summer humidity."

"event","It turns out I never had a &quot;save $500 by June&quot; goal after all. Twit.

After some reflection, I&#39;ve realised two things about my attitude to work (and other people) that I find disturbing.

Firstly, I&#39;m still affected by the abusive, antagonistic, selfish attitude of my ex-boss. Thanks to them, I am terrified that my next job (after this upcoming one, <i>if</i> it ever <i>starts!</i>) will be a rehash of:<ol>
<li>Being expected to hard-sell big-ticket items to inmates of the Home for the Terminally Indecisive (generally either almost dead people, or young people trying to stretch their dollars as far as possible);</li>
<li>Eternally ringing phones. I <i>hate</i> the ringing of phones. I also hate unattended or ignored beepers or buzzers of any sort;</li>
<li>Trying to read the minds of people who have none (ex-boss included);</li>
<li>Sitting at my desk, paralysed with fear, unable to do anything, knowing that whatever I do, it will be declared a waste of time when I should be doing this instead.</li>
</ol>I think you can see why I&#39;m actually <i>afraid</i> of future work.

Second, I don&#39;t interact with people in meatspace beyond the most cursory transactions. Shopping and all that, perhaps an exchange of meaningless pleasantries regarding some (possibly shared) interest &ndash; all underpinned by what feels like disinterested contempt. If I were to put it into words, it would be something like: <i>What do you want? You&#39;re interrupting me, not that you care.&nbsp;Give me what I want and go away.</i>

You&#39;ve probably guessed I&#39;ve had piss-poor experiences with people in the past. Chronic bullying in secondary school leads to ignorance in adulthood leads to loneliness without surcease. You get the idea. (Assuming you have a mind to get ideas with, he laughs bitterly.)

I also note that as I get stressed and frustrated that I entertain the idea that other people and their goddamn talking are crushing my thoughts with their own so that I can&#39;t think in my own head because it&#39;s full of their indigestible filthy yammering goddamn talking. But that&#39;s probably because I think verbally, and the human meat case is a sensory overload vector, all that eye contact and body language and the expectation of instant responses.

Hmm. Perhaps the dismissive, contempuous pose and fear of employment is because I want autonomy and self-directed agency in my life again. (Not to mention my lust to win Powerball. Autonomy and self-direction require large sums of money to achieve.)

Anyway... my dream Powerball life seems to be one of a prolonged, drawn-out retirement of puttering, before drawing my last death rattle, alone and forgotten, in a nursing home bed reeking of eau de Grim Reaper circa 2050. That&#39;s not good enough. But I can&#39;t think of anything I can do that other people haven&#39;t already done, and better.

Fuck it. I&#39;d seek help but it&#39;s too expensive. Everything I need and want is too expensive."

"event","Well - here we go again with the Powerball ticket. $20,000,000 up for grabs, and I hope to get it all - before splitting it 50/50 with the olds.

I&#39;ve blithered before about storing some in a &#39;tank&#39; account that drips a grand a week into my cheque account, and I&#39;ve just worked out that at $1,250 per week, $3,000,000 would see me happy for the next forty-six years - in other words, well into my lonely dotage, drooling in some retirement home. (It doesn&#39;t take into account rising prices, global cataclysms, health crises etc. of course.) Another $5,000,000 in a five-year term deposit generating $200,000 every year. Which leaves another two mil and change to buy toys, get dental and LASIK work, maybe some psychiatric counselling, and pay debts.

For me, I want money in order to be <i>secure.</i> Right now I&#39;m <i>not</i> secure; WINZ could cut off my benefit if it decides I haven&#39;t been actively seeking work and this desk job still hasn&#39;t told me when to start. And it&#39;s a damn startup, for about six months, more if it actually flies. I hate this, knowing my life is at the mercy of other people. Powerball would relieve that feeling. I&#39;d be able to do what I want, when I want, without the awful sensation of looking over my shoulder in the knowledge that somewhere, somehow, there&#39;s something else that I really should be doing - and if there isn&#39;t, someone will cook something up.

Anyway. Once debts are paid off, investments set running and the pressure to work for a living <i>gone for ever,</i> I really do think I&#39;ll move out on my own. I&#39;m tired of the seemingly permanent presence of my parents (and I think they&#39;re a little fed up of me as well.) For some reason I&#39;m thinking of moving into Wellington for a year or two, to see what it&#39;s like to be a man of leisure - <i>with</i> money this time.

There&#39;s this charming little workingman&#39;s cottage in Newtown, for instance, well within walking distance of the Mediterranean Food Warehouse (yum!) and I&#39;ve walked into the central city from this area before - too often. No off-street parking makes me a little nervous, but for all I know I can work out something with perhaps the scooter or a bicycle.

Then there&#39;s this high-tech beauty. It&#39;s actually a long, narrow studio (the photos make it look like it runs from one side of the building to the other, and it&#39;s 25m x 4m wide), right in the heart of the city. And it&#39;s wired for high-speed broadband! Being a turbo nerd, it&#39;s like heaven... at least until I go insane from the pokiness.

Of course, these are short-term dreams. I can&#39;t really see myself as an octogenarian kicking back in this place; hell, I can&#39;t imagine what I&#39;ll be doing or where I&#39;ll be living in ten years&#39; time.

Really, the problem is that I don&#39;t have what I&#39;d describe as passion any more; Nothing makes me wake up with eager anticipation; Nothing inspires me to press on with it regardless of the obstacles, the setbacks, or the unlikelihood of any reward. Powerball would change that by making the financial imperative moot.

I want a passion I can believe in.

I want to be able to live without looking fearfully over my shoulder for That Thing I Should Be Doing Instead Of What I&#39;m Trying to Do."

<li>What can I do with ____?</li>
<li>How do I make ____?</li>
<li>What mod has ____ in it?</li>
<li>What recipes are unique to ____?</li>
</ol>There might be other questions worth asking. But when you seek, you get a nice graphical depiction of the recipe, that you can identify with in-game.

No community, since recipes aren&#39;t really up for debate, and the last thing you need is spam and proof of humanity&#39;s inherent obsolecence clogging up the database. Also it&#39;s a distraction.

Why? Because these days everything&#39;s lost in a fog of (semi-literate) forum threads, wikis, homebuilt websites, badly formatted text files, rambling videos etc. etc. I&#39;m not a patient lad, and the sooner Wikia offers a sitemap tree for their sites the better.

So... I&#39;d need to concoct the tables and their relations. I&#39;ll probably need to enumerate Minecraft versions as well... Maybe I could use imglib or something to automatically pixel-resize icons for different resolutions. Ideally this is a site I could look at on my crappy little Amicroe tablet (800x480px), which suggests maybe PHP with DHTML or AJAX.

I&#39;ll poke at it from various angles, but if it turns out to a) have merit and b) work, I&#39;ll make a bit of noise and plunk some cash down for hosting renewal and a custom domain."

My vision of the ideal life still stands, looking something like:<ol>
<li>Bachelor Pad Royale (with cheese), probably somewhere on the outskirts of Wellington&#39;s CBD at $500-600 pw</li>
<li>A &#39;reservoir&#39; account with $520,000 in it, or roughly 10 years&#39; spending money at $1000 per week</li>
<li>$2E6 in term deposit #1, 1 yr period, 4%pa interest, yielding about $80,000 max per year</li>
<li>$2E6 in term deposit #2, 5 yr period, 5.3% interest, yielding about $106,000 max per year</li>
<li>$480,000 for debt eradication, toy buying, holiday taking, charity donation, and possibly LASIK and Dobbs only knows what</li>
</ol>The other half goes to my parents. That way they can move to Queensland like they keep talking about and invest the rest, and never have to fuss with RSL lotteries again.

However, I am concerned about how I&#39;m going to fill in the time. If I move away from home, I expect I&#39;ll probably spend the first month (or fortnight) going completely mad before settling down, and I might only last a year or two before &mdash;

Wait a minute. The only model I have for living on my own is the terrible two year period in the middle &#39;90s. Then I was struggling to save my food from thieves, unable to hold onto a job long enough to get out of that hostel, feeling worse and worse as time ground on. If my dreams come true this night, then the pressure to find income &ndash; to find paid work &ndash; will <i>not exist</i>. Instead, I&#39;ll be able to expend time and money to find <i>my own</i> purpose and meaning.

Let&#39;s be honest. I&#39;ve pretty much given up on the job search. The reason for that is because I have a hierarchy of questions that need answers first, and that I do not know, and can find no assistance on, how to answer:<ol>

"event","One of the things I&#39;ve realised about my fantasies about my &#39;perfect&#39; life is that work is not involved. Or if it is, it takes place offstage; it&#39;s something on a par with going to the toilet. Except I go to an office and do... well, I don&#39;t know. But it involves an office, fixed hours, and a fixed hourly rate. And I don&#39;t take it home with me.

&#39;Home&#39; in the fantasy world is a two-bedroom apartment with nice views and a fairly modern interior. Fifties-era buildings to me have gaps in the walls filled with the dark excrescences of failure and poverty. Maybe that&#39;s a psychic reaction to being stuck in that hostel for two years, unable to land or retain a job long enough to be able to move out. One bedroom is for Morpheus, another for Apollo, and the living room for Dionysius. My fermenter bubbles and blasphemes in the kitchen. In the bank, two million dollars quietly generates 4% interest per annum, giving me about $70,000 a year to live on, or a little over $1000 a week in hand to pay for rent, food and so on.

Hell, with a setup like that I wouldn&#39;t <i>need </i>work.

Obviously this isn&#39;t likely to happen unless I get very lucky with the Powerball again. Or I finally work out how to land a damn job. Mind you, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s worse: the pressure to land a job, or the pressure to retain one.

But what concerns me is that I have such a vague notion of what ideal work would be like. My ideal lifestyle is funded so I don&#39;t <i>have </i>to work at all. With less than forty years to go before I pop my then-elderly clogs, all those years of effective leisure seem somewhat futile and/or sterile.

Even more disturbing: There are no other people in my ideal life - just bit part actors where the transactions are concise, finite and over with quickly before returning home alone. I actually have slightly paranoid views on other people; I don&#39;t like others talking at me and shoving their thoughts into my head. I&#39;m guessing that my ideal fantasy life is sort of a reaction against the pressure I feel to conform to others&#39; expectations and demands. That and I&#39;m introverted anyway."

"event","I read in today&#39;s paper that Powerball is at its third highest level since it topped out at $30 million - about $27 million. What the hell, I&#39;ll splash out and fantasise over what I&#39;d do if I won all that moolah.
<lj-cut text=""You could read more but who cares?"">

</lj-cut>
First, I&#39;d pay off my student debt. NZD$14,000 doesn&#39;t sound like much compared to what kids in the USA are crushed under, but it&#39;s a big burden for me. I want it gone. Fast.

Second, I&#39;d move out of home. A small two-bedroom flat, or townhouse, or apartment, I dunno: but I would have my own life, not constrained by the near-constant presence of two other people. I&#39;m not sure where though. Possibly a Wellington suburb or maybe Mana or Plimmerton way.

Thirdly, I&#39;d set things up to live off the interest of some investments and things. $27 million should buy a few stocks and bonds, and still cover gift tax or whatever. I&#39;ve only got about forty years left, I should be okay. Finding work is distressing for me and frankly hopeless. Far better to live out the fag-end of my wasted life as a relatively well-off dandy or dilettante, frittering away my days on fanfictions and other nonsense.

Fourthly, I&#39;d buy my own SL sim. Hell, something like that&#39;d barely make a dent. Do it up as a magical forest island and hold rave parties there or something. Or just hold on to it as a monumental folly.

The thing is though, that when I try to imagine where I&#39;d like to be in the future, <i>I cannot see work involved.</i> As in, I cannot envision any concrete form of employment. All I see are vague conceptions of offices, but doing what? I don&#39;t know. In fact I&#39;m unsure what sort of office work I&#39;m able to do. I know from experience that I have trouble prioritising tasks, focussing on what&#39;s in front of me, saying no to superiors, and remaining motivated. I know I just want a stack of conceivable work (as in, I can relate to its scale, I can accurately gauge its size and tell whether I can succeed or fail) every day, and be left alone to tackle it. But I also know such jobs are few, far between, most likely poorly paid, and locked behind the wall known as &#39;networking&#39;.

Twenty-odd years ago, I thought I knew what I wanted to do and how things would pan out. Of course, I soon learned my ideas of varsity life were derived from <i>Animal House</i> and <i>Revenge of the Nerds </i>and thus not even wrong. In fact, one of the things I&#39;ve learned is that, if I want the comfortable, autonomous life I aspire to, my only hope is the kind of blind luck that Lotto Powerball embodies.

The other way is that I outlive my parents - probably when I&#39;m 65 or so - then rot away quietly in some grotty pensioner flat somewhere, alone, near-penniless, forgotten, childless, my possessions scattered to the op shops and my internet accounts gone dark.

Ah well. Spend $12 and see if the balls roll my way for once, eh?"

"event","A project I&#39;ve been working on, inspired by a Cheesy board that Marx Dudek installed in a corner of The Listening Room, is a board game I call Kitty Korner. Look at the image of the mockup and you&#39;ll get why.

<a href=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/revcardboardbox/4078222/1226/1226_original.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""The Kitty Korner mockup"" height=""319"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/revcardboardbox/4078222/1226/1226_600.jpg"" title=""The Kitty Korner mockup"" width=""600"" /></a> 
Basically, the game gives you four pieces (currently fat mesh cats), starting in your home corner, and you have to &#39;crown&#39; them by moving them into the opposing corner, one die-roll at a time, then win by getting your remaining pieces back home before anyone else. (The opposing corner is diagonally opposite on the game grid. &quot;Kitty-corner&quot;. Ha ha ha.)

Did I say &#39;remaining&#39;? Well yes. If you land on someone else&#39;s piece, that piece gets &#39;knocked out&#39; of the game. Theoretically you could win with just one piece left on the board.

Anyway, so far my concerns have been adding seats, and detecting when someone parks their butt, adding them to the sequence, checking that the dice are&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;to the players in order of sitting down etc.

But now, we&#39;re at the hirsuite stage of coding the actual game logic, of detecting <i>which</i> piece or control (the pink inverted cones) have been touched, moving the selected piece and dealing with the aftermath. Trying to do that with the relatively klugey code I&#39;ve written is not entirely fun.

So I&#39;m sitting with a legal pad jotting down the names of useful functions to move pieces, test who touched what, and working out a straightforward nomenclature to differentiate between setting a control&#39;s physical position on the board (probably <i>C_*</i>) as opposed to that of a piece (<i>P_*</i>), any global helper functions I could use (as opposed to <i>G_*</i> which I&#39;m using for global variables and constants, and also setting up spaces where fun effects can be produced as required.

I&#39;m not anticipating big earnings from this, but since I&#39;ve started I may as well finish. If I can reduce the main game loop to a raft of function calls, that should make writing the logic a lot simpler.

Anyway, this is a journal, and I&#39;m not the most self-confident man, so a little encouragement wouldn&#39;t go amiss."

For one, I have my eyes not only on Windows 8 Pro, but also another 2GB memory for my box. Currently I&#39;m still running XP Home with SP3, and it&#39;s starting to crack under the strain. Worse, it&#39;s an <i>upgrade</i> package for Windows 98. The stupid machine has forgotten how to handle my external drives (I have to use them in Safe Mode), which is a backup PITA. So, for a long time, I&#39;ve been making noises about wiping everything and reloading from scratch. That&#39;s roughly $300 right there.

Before then I&#39;ll play around with something called Mixxx, which apparently is a freeware sort of DJ/mixing/streaming program. If it turns out to be useful...

Anyway. The Buzzcocks are coming to Wellington at the end of April and my calculations suggest I need about $200 to cover the ticket, train fares, overnight at a backpackers hostel and &#39;refreshments&#39;. In the Kiwi tradition I&#39;ll likely have a couple of jugs at the Cambridge then head up Guzhnee to the Bodge for the gig. Get a buzz(cock) on and save the stress of trying to reach the bar for a hefeweizen.

The backpackers is to save the stress of finding a park, then driving home late at night with all them police checkpoints about.

Ah, listen to me! I seem to have already made up my mind about these. Which means I need to shift my parsimony into overdrive and slow my comfort spending <i>right the fuck down.</i>

However. In May we get blessed by They Might Be Giants on a Friday night. Which means I get to do it all again... or do I?

Afterwards, it&#39;s back to saving again. I have debts to service."

"event","The season to be chronically dissatisfied with what one has is here, and I am no exception. Here&#39;s my big three requests of the fat bastard.

<b>1. A stable, secure fulltime job pulling down $50k pa gross.</b>

Without this, everything else is either impossible or useless. Unfortunately,&nbsp;<i>finding</i> and&nbsp;<i>obtaining</i> such a position is pretty much impossible without, I suspect, losing what safety net I have living here at home and moving to another city. But I can&#39;t do one without the other.

The cons? I&#39;ll be beholden, from the time I get up to the time I make it home, to the demands and whims of managers who most likely have heard of this reality thing from&nbsp;<i>Trendy Management</i> magazine.

What aggravates me is that, not only is the job search these days like playing the pokies, it seems&nbsp;<i>every fucking position</i>&nbsp;is about, or involves dealing with, clients, or retail, or both. I can&#39;t take nonstop human exposure. I need a place where I can fade into the back and people&nbsp;<i>fuck off and let me do my job.</i>

<b>2. My own 2-bedroom house, where I can live, alone,&nbsp;<i>without&nbsp;</i>prying parents.</b>

Not that I don&#39;t like the olds, but they&#39;re always around; I can&#39;t let my ideas expand or blow off steam or rant without them poking their noses in. It makes me self-conscious and convinced that nothing&nbsp;<i>I</i> want to do is important, compared to what anyone else wants.

Having my own place would be a start in the right direction. But of course low-end flats and rentals start around $300/wk, hence the need for item #1.

<b>3. Proof that my creative endeavours are worth pursuing.</b>

As in,&nbsp;<i>people pay me meaningful sums.</i>&nbsp;It&#39;s all a bit mercenary, but I sometimes wonder why I bother writing fanfics, even well-received ones, for no real profit. Hell, I&#39;d write a novel if I knew I wouldn&#39;t be wasting my time. Or even write a nonfiction book of novel bicycle adventures... if I had the cash to do the research. Which I don&#39;t."

Mind you, I'm finding it stressful. Possible jobs are thin on the ground still, and with both my parents giving up fulltime work, things are likely to become stressful. I'm resigned to enjoying the features of our rail network twice daily, <em>once</em> I land a job in Wellington.

Can't wait for all the paperwork to be processed and everything to be moved and we can just <em>go.</em>

Instead I ended up spending two years in a hostel room, barely scraping by after board was paid on whatever shopping didn't get stolen.<br /><br />This time, however, by 2012 I intend to not only have a job, but a place of my own, close to work.<br /><br /><img width=""180"" height=""240"" align=""left"" alt="""" src=""http://images.trademe.co.nz/photoserver/tq/43/154302843.jpg"" />Maybe something like the one bedroom loft apartment (left), down the south end of Cuba Street. (And top of the building!)<br /><br />This is pretty much what I'm thinking of: a space for sleeping, a space for living, and spaces for cooking and bathing.<br /><br />It's close enough to the central city without being unduly affected by too much noise, with Fidel's within walking distance, and maybe the Bristol or somesuch further on. Fully equipped kitchen with own washing machine, broadband, and hot water included in the rent.<br /><br />That is, if I can find a job where I can afford the $300 a week before it gets rented out, ha ha.<br /><br /><img width=""240"" height=""180"" align=""right"" alt="""" src=""http://images.trademe.co.nz/photoserver/tq/38/155276538.jpg"" />And on the right, we have a nice one-bedroom house in Mt Cook, a little further south, but near Massey. Actually I'd prefer an honest-to-God house, but at the same time I know there's more work involved in maintenance. And on-street parking, which I hate. In town I'd most likely walk everywhere. Hell, the hostel was in Newtown and I'd walk all the way to the New World at the end of Cable Street for my shopping!<br /><br />What? The range was better.<br /><br />In any case, living away will probably see more salad and pasta than I'd really like.<br /><br />Dunno what the broadband situation's like either.<br /><br /><img width=""240"" height=""180"" align=""left"" alt="""" src=""http://images.trademe.co.nz/photoserver/tq/38/152023738.jpg"" />Another option I'd consider is one of the dormitory 'burbs closer to the city; after all I've lived in one - Paremata - most of my childhood. So maybe this bushy view (left) in Tawa might be the ticket. It's even fully furnished. Nice!<br /><br />But again, there's the issue of broadband. Y'see, I couldn't give fourpence about Sky, or Freeview, or TV in general. Unless I'm using the damn thing as a giant monitor for my PC. All my needs of entertainment are simple: Music; student radio; newspapers; DVDs; and of course internet and computer games.<br /><br />So satellite TV and parking are less important to me than whether I can get decent speeds through Telecom or Telstra.<br /><br />There's also a couple of places in Paremata, but they're a bit far from the pub - er, I mean amenities. On second thoughts, being far from the pub isn't all bad; I have to exert myself more to get there and back.<br /><br />But at the same time, I need to get out more, meet people. I've been getting increasingly short-tempered of late, condemning just about everyone out of hand. That's the problem with suburbs: sure, you get the psychological and ritual distance from your workplace that you need, but do you meet people there? Dormitories...<br /><br />Good lord - this is actually rather fun, pretending &quot;I can afford it, but would I want to live here?&quot; Maybe I'd better stop now. Got to find that fitting job first."

(After the old card game of the same name.)&nbsp;It's to be a sort of <em>Puzzle Bobble</em>-esque ball shooter with basic physics; you fire coins into a mass to make larger denominations, up to the titular fifty cent piece. Then you hit it again to collect the thing and unlock the $50 achievement.<br /><br />At first I thought the most sensible thing was to locate a reasonable physics library to plug into a framework, but everything runs to squillions of lines, unhelpfully documented, and tutorials are waaay over my head or out of date (Box3D, I'm looking at you, you <em>bastard</em>.) So I had a little think.<br /><br />All I really need for physics are:<ol><li>A velocity vector</li><li>Possibly a velocity magnitude, but I'm not sure</li><li>Spin, so glancing blows not only send the struck coin away, they add a little english to it</li><li>Mass (for damping and determining how much momentum is transferred)</li><li>Radius (for calculating collision effects)</li><li>Friction (to stop coins from just endlessly ping-ponging their way over the Game Over Line of Doom)</li></ol>And if that's the case, then all I need is a refresher in Newtonian physics and to develop some Flixel classes and functions. Then I can create a test sandbox and play around with settings.<br /><br />I've already found pictures of old New Zealand currency, now I just need to work out what the rest of the playfield is going to look like, dimensions of the coins etc. This could be fun.

Currently I believe WoW is almost entirely overrun by sub-adolescents whose entire online existence consists of spawn raping and screaming homophobic and racist epithets, mixed with profanities and garnished occasionally with actual words.<br /><br />But. Of the ten days of free trial, I now have to pick my nose and wait for 9.something GB of data to dribble down my broadband. Given that we're on the arse end of one of Telecom's bits of baling wire, that'll take a fucking day at least.<br /><br />I should know. After all, it ended up taking two whole days for both Bioshock and Fallout: New Vegas to gurgle their way down - and New Vegas clogs my CPU. As in, every time I try to run it, the damn thing drops to barely 1-2fps in exteriors. On exit, the system chugs away at 40% usage, but no process is fingered - and it's all on one core. Bizarre. I'll wait for a patch to come my way before trying it again.<br /><br />So - now it's 8.6GB at just over 30kbps. And no doubt Blizzard's meter is already running. Oh well, I have Oblivion and Bioshock. (Bioshock, by the way, has a good atmosphere going, although it feels oddly bulky and inconvenient. Or maybe it's the unnerving place you're in... or maybe it's the upcoming meeting with Steinberg. I pretty much failed it last time and want to hack everything before shutting the prick down.<br /><hr /><br />I've pretty much steamrolled through more money and beer over the Christmas break than I should admit, but then again this <em>is</em> the season of overindulgence. So I've been doing some retail therapy.<br /><br />I purchased a copy of <a href=""http://hicksvillecomics.com/"">Dylan Horrocks</a>' comic opus <em><a href=""http://www.hicksville.co.nz/"">Hicksville</a></em>, the last one in the shop. Took a while to find but I found it.<br /><br />Also I purchased a cable for this Sony Walkman I found during a walk early November, handed in to the cops as lost property, then collected it back because nobody had claimed it. Unfortunately the damn thing hasn't arrived yet. On the other hand the new blades and foil for my shaver came in on time.<br /><br />Yesterday I went into town, and ended up in Real Groovy, trawling their $5-for-10 CD table. I've picked up some interesting stuff, some of which is iffy, some good, but at 50c per item nothing really wasted.<br /><br />On the other hand there was the pub. And the Malthouse, at $10 average <em>per beer.</em> But we're talking about Emerson's Bookbinder, a nice porter made with tamarillos (which I couldn't detect, I must admit), and the Captain Cook beer made with manuka and tea tree. So they're not quaffy like DB or Speights...<br /><hr /><br /><lj-cut text=""Time to think about the new year""><br />Anyway, tomorrow I'll probably stay at home, have a few beers, and ruminate over the waste that this past year has been.<br /><br />The basic list is as follows:<br /><ol><br /><li>Pay off my Visa - should get it done this year</li><br /><li>Find a new job before winter, something rewarding yet autonomous and predictable</li><br /><li>Drink less beer and lose weight (i.e. switch from light lagers to dark beers - they're more filling)</li><br /><li>Create something other than reasons not to create something</li><br /><li>Reclaim my interest in playing the guitar</li><br /><li>See the doc about resuming the antidepressants - I might need them more than I thought</li><br /></ol><br />Yep, I'm a bundle of laffs these days. Anyway, there's one other thing I want to do: move out.<br /><br />Sometimes my parents' incessant talk drives me mad. And I start considering flatting, except that in those states I can't bear the possibility of sharing a house with unpredictable strangers. Even if it's one of those student flats in a reclaimed office block, I think I'd be better off living by myself, not in a hostel grovel like 1995, but a proper apartment, with a proper job (c/f #2 above) footing the bills, eating proper food as opposed to what the stair dancers <em>didn't</em> steal out of the communal fridge.<br /><br />Except, of course, you get what you pay for. And I'd most likely end up either being driven to distraction by the thumps and burbles of those around me, or do the same to them. And let's stop <em>right there</em> before I dump that lofty goal in the trash as well.<br /><br />First things first: Make an appointment to see the doc about my mind, and my knees. They hurt.

In 2012 I'll probably get Skyrim out of morbid interest. It's a bit off that we're trucking into the Nordic north as opposed to going in search of the Eye of Argonia or pulling the teeth of the Summerset Isle mob, but never mind.

I've also been converting a lot of my tapes to MP3, particularly the NZ indie stuff like Tall Dwarfs, some Pop Will Eat Itself, They Might Be Giants and so on. Something extra to choose for my iPod, since my choices seem to be circling the BTDT drain.

It's made me think about my musical tastes. Generally speaking, my musical preferences end about the year 2000. Everything after that seems to be as follows:
<ol>
<li>Gangsta rap-by-numbers, performed by people desperately trying to become cartoon characters - and not in a good way;</li>

I'm seriously thinking of switching to <a href=""http://www.tumblr.com"">Tumblr</a>. At least those guys allow for much easier image gallery embedding, video embedding, and suchlike.

The actual main reason I ever purchased hosting was for my short-lived ASS shows (which total about 324MB), but even as I write I'm uploading them to a Mediafire account. And it's fairly easy to create a separate page on Tumblr for them.

As for the old, increasingly out of date wiki I made for Carson Fire's <em><a href=""http://www.elflife.net"" title=""Read, enjoy and DONATE you skinflints!"">Alfheim</a></em>, well, there's Wikia. It's got to be easier to use than effing about with Perl or PHP or whatever.

Oh - and Tumblr has a rich text editor. I like rich text editors. Especially when it comes to posting long text items with lots for formatting that require FUCKING AGES of manipulation and then you miss a line break or closing tag.

At the same time, I'm aware that I launched the paid-host version of my website under a slew of wrong assumptions. For instance, I assumed I would continue to make ever-so-awesome hour-long show mixes on a regular basis. I assumed that my SubGenius persona was more important (until I realised it wasn't, hence the switch to the .geek.nz domain). I assumed having total dominion over the host software would mean more freedom - which it didn't; just headaches and legacy mess.

And now I'm uploading my ASS, as I said, to Mediafire, and crawling through my website to see what deserves to be transferred.

It isn't much, if I say so myself."

Saturday I went to an autism group outing, visiting the <a href=""http://www.wetanz.com/cave/"">Weta Cave</a> in Miramar. To be blunt, I was disappointed. Weta Workshop deserves a much larger museum, not a glorified souvenir shop not much larger than my dining room and kitchen!

Does anyone have $800 doing nothing? There's this gorgeous FMOM Industries Wave Disruptor Gun...

...And I was surprised, in a book of NZ fantasy artists, to see studies for Half Life 2. Not to mention studies for Left 4 Dead. Us Kiwis get everywhere!

I've been finding myself increasingly irritable being with my parents. We're growing apart, and while their concerns are valid, sometimes they get just plain irritating.

If if if. If only I had my own place, and a salary to pay the broadband bill, power, rates, food, clothing...

Creatively speaking, I seem to be spending more time on fanfiction, especially <a href=""http://chorrol.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=4452"">The Memoir of Arch-Mage Ra'jirra</a> (Oblivion, modded) and <a href=""http://chorrol.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=4515"">The Chronicle of Ra'jirra: The Wasteland Affair</a> (Oblivion/Fallout 3 crossover).

I have currently no interest in drawing comics again, and little enthusiasm for learning Flixel and making games after all.

Or is that simply me being so small, and stymied by my plans' vague immensity and uselessness?

Mayhap I should be an author, but an author of what? There's no money in fanfics, unless you're the lawyer suing some wretch dumb enough to want to put one into print out of existence.

My parents have suggested writing some sort of <em>Chicken Soup For the Soul</em>-esque thing, or maybe opinionated columns like Joe Bennett. Unfortunately I'm more likely to rant myself out before I can put it in writing - even then my indignation can't survive thought.

<hr />
Maybe I'm too rational like that, but at the same time I'm too cynical to believe that the world situation will improve. The US will break down in civil war in my lifetime, I'm sure of it. Just look at the sheer venom and ooga-booga tribalism that exists today!

The 'brown countries' will continue to die as they're ground between the millstones of tribal tradition and modern challenges. Well, actually, the 'white countries' are the same, but they've been able to delay the inevitable a bit longer somehow. Cultural identity is one thing but not that important. (Yes, I know you can't trust the media, but all I've ever seen and heard is failed states, mad dictators, child soldiers, religious intolerance, paranoid bellicosity, deadly sexism, ooga fucking booga.)

(Yes, you can cry, 'racist!' but I had to lance it.)

I also feel that modern civilisation of any kind will be over by 2100. Probably earlier. We never adapted to the fucking <em>Twentieth</em> Century, so how in hell is humanity going to cope with the new and unexpected challenges of the <em>Twenty-First?</em>

Or maybe I just have the glooms."

So the first time, I get up, sort out the post into streets, figure out the best route for navigating the place. Then it took me about two and a half hours to wend my way along. Sure, most of these are roads I've stomped down, but usually I do so en route somewhere else or with a definite destination in mind. Here, I'm stopping in most of the side roads as well, so naturally the walk takes longer. And longer still as I learn where some places are.

Not much moolah, but it gives me a reason not to stay up until midnight and get up early in the morning.

In Second Life news, I'll be redoing my gallery in Earth - just spawn in the middle of Earth and you'll see a tall building off to your left - The Cool Green Hills of Earth. Nice tower, but it's just an empty shell and I hate it. So Fecal Varnish has spent most of the afternoon rotating prims on 80m sticks to create the shell. At 207+ prims it's heavy, but it looketh good. I'll test the rezzer later and start primping the thing - stairways, gewgaws, Populuxe gimcracks, that sort of decoration.

The design's going to be more compact and focussed, with space for over 200 regular sized artworks on the external walls <em>alone</em>, and I'm thinking of replacing my lonely eyrie with a more public lounge area at one end and maybe a dance floor at the other. Basically a place where members of SubGenius groups or Kiwis can come, hang out, use for events or stuff like that. (Which means finding a decent free Shoutcast host on my lack of salary!)

"event","Reading the Saturday paper, I was going through a feature on a pair of design students creating an eco-friendly bach which they are going to enter in an American design competition. <a href=""http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/local/4207781/Bach-made-in-heaven"">[Online artichoke here]</a>

This resonant quote stood out:

<blockquote>In New Zealand, we throw open the doors on a nice day, while in America, they shut everything up and put the air con on.</blockquote>

Let's look at this. Us Kiwis, confronted with a nice day, let it in and adapt to the environment. Herns, on the other hand, issue a trespass notice and demand the environment adapt to <em>them.</em>

The reason this resonates with me is that I personally feel such a contrast emphasises the way Selfishness has apparently replaced the American 'virtue' of Independence.

Much of my online reading, especially news articles from the USA, concerns individuals whose Selfishness got them into trouble. The entire 'Tea Party' for instance seems to be nothing more than the artful mass manipulation of Selfishness for the equally Selfish goals of a wealthy minority.

Independence, as I understand it, is being able not only <em>to</em> act on your own, but being able to <em>judge how best to</em> act - including how your actions might affect other people and in turn affect <em>their</em> actions towards <em>you.</em> (I may be conflating independence and Theory of Mind here though.)

Selfishness... well, it assumes other people are just bit part actors in your life, fuck 'em. And that's being generous.

I'm having trouble articulating this concept, especially since I'm one of those godless foreign devils who, nevertheless, is worried about what's happening in the North American mass psyche - since North American culture is one of that country's major exports.

What do you think? Has Selfishness passed itself off as Freedom and/or Independence in the US mind? Or are there some other reasons for this interesting difference in attitude?"

I think there's a driver collision somewhere since the sound doesn't work, but that can be buffed out. Ditching Google Desktop and a couple other pieces of crap should help too.

And this beast is *quiet!* Right now it's sitting happily pulling SubGenius shite from alt.binaries.slack and alt.binaries.multimedia.slack until it's all finished and I come home to do driverectomies and other fun stuff."

"event","I'll post later about whatever my resolutions are in a Fiends Only post.

All in all, the year hasn't been all that much a success. I lost my job as I staggered and collapsed under the increasing demands; I've saved exactly zilch; and I've succeeded less in reducing my credit card debt than I was hoping for.

Next year I hope to win Lotto, or failing that find a rewarding job, recover my creative mojo, save much more money, and move out of home again and this time succeed at staying out.

Currently (it's 8:40pm) I'm wondering about going out for a bit of a NYE celebration. Not that I need it, and it's going to be unpleasant if I do, since the nearest local has a band on (have I ranted about too-loud pub bands before?), but perhaps I need the time away.

But until I land a well-paying job -- I was getting paid barely above minimum wage for three years! -- I'm stuck here.

On the other hand, we all got ourselves one great Christmas present: new carpet. It's made the whole place much lighter inside, and more comfy, and more saleable should we win an RSL lottery and move to Queensland.

...

Maybe I will, after I finish my tea. There's another pub down the road. They don't usually have bands."

After all, how can one know happiness without knowing sadness, or want, or indeed be able to separate negative emotions from positive ones?

Also, I wonder about comfort. Is that the ultimate method of the authoritarian power-seeker: to make everyone so satisfied they won't dare rise up for fear they'll lose said comfort?"

<blockquote>In her new book Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America (Metropolitan/Holt, October 2009), Barbara Ehrenreich traces the origins of contemporary optimism from nineteenth-century healers to twentieth-century pushers of consumerism. She explores how that culture of optimism prevents us from holding to account both corporate heads and elected officials...</blockquote>

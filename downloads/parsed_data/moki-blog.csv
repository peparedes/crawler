"event","So after months of berated anger at Google and their libjingle code, it was time to move on. So move on I did. I've found a beautiful library called Telepathy, that allows you to write modules for any messenger network, and the interface communicates with it via DBus. Excellent. And then I received new students to help me work on the project. Nothing wrong with more students, except two of them run Windows. Dbus. Windows. For those not from a linux perspective, dbus is an important cross-program library in Linux, but not written explicitly for Windows.

Anyhow, a few awkward pauses later, I'm now working on finding a port to Windows that doesn't break. Still, I'm now in the awkward status of, yay, new manpower, but 2 months of framework research that might have to be chucked out because of it. Now, while the real solution is to man up, and simply figure out a way to run dbus and telepathy on windows, the two students just want to get their research credits and get out of here, which is completely understandable given the requirements of the MENG program. They would rather create a non-functional mockup. Unfortunately, they have no interest in user interface design, which is the fundamental research being done here. It would fulfill the requirements, but we wouldn't be able to have a paper out of this.

So now I'm faced with the question of, do I want to actually want to keep pushing forward with this, or settle for a half solution. Do I really want to push them into awkward? My gut feeling says to give them a subtle suggestion that this isn't going to work."

The idea is simple in concept, to grow the cells that become meat in a petri dish, instead of harvesting it from an animal. PETA is behind this concept, arguing that it spares animals suffering. However, I can't help but ask, aren't those cells also a living organism? I guess then it seems that PETA is only opposed to the killing of organisms with a higher sense of organization, or there is a part of this 'shmeat' I am not understanding. But maybe as the Doctor says, this is the future?"

"event","Agreed, the AIG Executive Bonus issue is revolting. The fact that they would be willing to spend a taxpayer's money to a group of executives that ran a company into the ground is hard to believe, or stomach. However, as CNN and several other sources have pointed out, the problem is that these bonuses were legally set up in contracts for hiring the executives, and if the executives choose to sue, they can claim twice as much as the amount promised in damages, potentially increasing the burden on the taxpayer. So roasting AIG now, after the fact, in my opinion, has simply become an outlet for the mass media. Campbell Brown had some commentary on the same issue, claiming that the senators and representatives should stop calling for AIG's downfall, and focus on rebuilding the company. Increasingly, I feel like the dialog about AIG has become nothing but a roast fest of emotion, and less on facts. Specifically, the hearings today in the House were completely unrelated to specific AIG executives, and focused on overall behavior. And the part that people seem to forget is that other companies, financial and non-financial, collapsed and non-collapsed, have been doing the same practice. Executive compensation in the United States has been spiraling out of control for the last few years, as Warran Buffett has famously criticized. The fact that these executives had been entailed to these bonuses, were then legally bound to receive them even without regard to performance, or even still being with the company, even in a good economic time seems slightly strange. While making sure the taxpayer's money is not wasted in this bailout make sense, maybe it's time that we looked more at this fundamental part of how companies are running, and question whether this is what people want."

"event","A decent amount of time ago a friend of mine asked me to rank airports by my personal order of preference. So here it goes.

1. Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD)
Nothing beats the sheer amount of connections, plus the new facilities, plus the safety of Dulles Airport in my opinion. While this is probably biased due to the fact that a lot of excellent trips started from here for me, and the thing is I live near the airport. Maybe being closer to the city it serves would have made sense? See the 70s, when there was next to no traffic here. Wi-fi and mall.

2. Newark Liberty Airport (NWK)
Yes, I know this is not a typical choice. But Newark has really cleaned up its act in the last few years, and at least for Continental, has proved to be a good hub with a sturdy network. American and US Airways, I'm not that sure on given the yelling I overheard the other day. Beautiful new terminal interior in Terminal A.

3. Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT)
First with Wi-fi airport wide. Yes, I know every whitehat, blackhat and security expert under the sun has tried to hack or crack the network. Large spacious air mall. Unfortunately, due to the fight between airport management and USAirways, the network out of it is nowhere near as amazing as it used to be. slightly isolated from town its supposed to serve.

4. John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)
The gateway of the world to America, one would think they would have tried to make this airport more convenient. AirTrain is great, but one must make a connection with LIRR or the A Line at Jamaica station. This connection system is not very well made, nor optimized for air travelers with suitcases. The architecture of the terminals is amazing, and Boingo provides fairly good wireless throughout.

6. New Chitose Airport (CTS)
Great clean new airport interior. Two runways, little traffic. 2 hours away from the city it was supposed to serve.

7. San Diego Airport (SAN)
Great clean new airport terminal interior. One runway. One. No room for expansion.

8. Philadelphia International Airport (PHL)
Bad interterminal connections. Little to do in USAirways terminal. Haven't experienced the rest.

9. Atlanta Jackson-Hartfield Airport (ATL)
How many different ways can one say delay? Horrible source of delays, which probably are a result of the flag carrier here, Delta. Dirty, old terminal. Needs work.

10. Washington Reagan National Airport (DCA)
How many more security problems can you cram in one airport? A northern approach that requires the river approach to avoid high sensitive areas, bridges next to the takeoff and approach paths. Horrible source of delays. Intercrossed runways.

11. Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)
Who vomited up this airport? Intercrossed runways in plenty of space, with a transit system that require connecting passengers to unload carts before transferring terminals. More delays than you can shake a stick at. Bad location. Expensive. I feel bad for Butch O'Hare, who was the man they named the airport after.

12. Narita International Airport (NRT)
Politically a bad decision. Only one long runway. Small mall. Prohibitively expensive landing fees. Far from the city is supposed to serve, with fundamentally broken system of transit. Only two desks for all domestic travelers for the flagship carrier, Japan Airlines. What happened?

Somewhere in there should be Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport (ITH), Portland International Airport, and Salt Lake City Airport. Ithaca is hard to compare to the others as a regional airport. Portland and Salt Lake City I haven't been to since I was in third grade."

Thirty years after the fact, it makes one question whether deregulation was a good idea, or whether it was implemented properly.

Burma. What a waste. In the last months, the<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron_Revolution"" title=""Wikipedia:Saffron Revolution"">Saffron Revolution</a> was led by Buddhist monks throughout the nation against a regime led a man by who Amnesty International calls the 3rd most oppressive leader in the world. They were very close to obtaining a victory, after 45 years of oppressive military rule, until they were brutally oppressed by secret police and the military. Activists in England and overall Europe have vocally called for regime change for years, to allow the democratically elected Aung San Suu Kyi to the presidency. European governments and media have devoted attention to their plight. The United States has done an amazing job in completely ignoring the plight of this nation. The commercial media juggernaut has completely ignored this situation to focus on Britney and OJ. What the Burmese government fears the most is for people in the world to know the plight of their nation, and by ignoring them, we play into the hands of a regime considered by many leading experts to be a leading human rights violator in the world. President Bush has been relatively active about the situation, but the American public has not pushed for more action.

The number one thing you can do for the freedom of Burma is to learn.


<a href=""http://mediamatters.org/items/200710100008"" title=""Coultergeist"">Ann Coulter has spoke again</a>. For those of you who did not listen to her interview, she called for Jews to ""perfect"" themselves, among other anti-Semitic comments. Let me simply ask one question. What sort of message are we sending out to the world by buying the books of a blatantly anti-semitic, religous elitist, in the country of the free? If we truly want to be a bastion of democracy and freedom, should this sort of comment be accepted by the public, and even ignored? That an educated woman of her stature would make these comments in this day and age amaze me. I ask you not to suppress Ms. Coulter's ability to speak, but the next time she speaks with her supposed morality, please consider her previous comments as well."

"event","hm... been a while since I've been a blogging. Hm, so before personal stuff (am I putting this off?) politics!

Democratic primary tuesday! Looks like it'll be interesting. James Webb, one of the candidates for the democratic nomination for the Senate, apparently was on the <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=1sy8zDnyNOo&search=Webb%20Colbert"">Colbert Report</a>, he seems to have not made an idiot out of himself. This seat is a big one for Democrats, Allen is considered a potential candidate for President in 2008, and he's a powerful guy in the Senate, so taking his seat will be a major victory for the sourthern branch of the Democratic party. Both Miller and Webb are relatively inexperienced in actually having a political office, with Miller being mainly known as a businessman and Webb as an author. Both have been in appointed positions. Both are socially rather liberal.

So whats my point?

The big thing used against Webb is his former support for Allen in 2000 and his position as Secretary of Navy under Reagan. That being said, he is not the one who proposed the 600 ship navy, that would be John Lehman. However, here's something that doesn't seem to be reported as much, Miller's PAC <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.asp?strid=C00317446&cycle=2000"">has donated large sums of money to the GOP as well</a>. So yeah. Apparently, things not as simple as they seem.
<lj-cut text=""A Breakdown of the Issues"">
Miller seems to be more of the guy who knows policy and actually has a plan, as <a href=""http://kumokasumi.livejournal.com/258541.html"">pointed out by Kumokasumi</a>, Webb seems to be more the guy who stands up as an ideological spokesperson, <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/columnist/klein/article/0,9565,1200712,00.html"">as pointed out by Time Magazine columnist Joe Klein</a>. And here's the big thing that the Democrats have to consider, who's the guy who can win? Let's be honest here, even though Warner and Kaine were both able to win, we're talking 8 years of Republicans before them (among them George Allen), and in the current Virginia congressional delegation, Republicans outnumber Democrats 10 to 3. Webb has the support of Senate Minority Leader Reid, former Senate Minority Leader Daschle (to be fair, the guy just lost), Senate Minority Whip Durbin, Congressman Murtha, Senator Kerry, former Senator Kerrey, Congressman Bryne (representative of the 11th district - VA) to make things short, the big guys in DC like him. That being said, Miller has the support of a large block of the Virginia Democratic party as a party insider, and the friendship of former Governor Warner, which is not to be trifled with.

I'll be honest, I'm leaning towards Webb as the more likely to win candidate. When you have the support of that many Democratic bigwigs, you can be sure that at least one of them will come down for campaign event or two. For the Democrats to have a chance, they need people to actually care. Allen's a former football star, a celebrity, a big name. To beat him, the Democrats need both a cross-aisle appeal, and a lot of voting Democrats at the booth. I have some reservations as to whether Miller will provide that. It is true that both Warner and Kaine ran a mainly state oriented campaign, and both effectively used the state party's power to win. But the 2006 Congressional Elections are threatening to be a big national event, and if the Democrats get with the program, they can give the Republicans at the very least a run for the money. In this case, a person that can get national support may be what the Democrats need. And if the Democrats make the Iraq War the sticking point of this election, I'm guessing that it will be harder for the Republicans to attack him on national security as a former Reagan DoD official and Marine Vet.

But wait, up to here, I've been acting like the Republican Party will just sit there and let the guys win, obviously we need to factor them in. The GOP is not going to lose a seat like Allen's without a fight. If it's Miller, then we can probably expect the usual, ""Hey, he has no experience and is a former lobbyist!"". If it's Webb, ""FLIP FLOP!"". The question is, will it work? Though one might point out that the flip flop issue doomed Senator Kerry's campaign, lets not forget that James Socas got nailed by the lack of experience issue against Frank Wolf two years ago as well. So I don't think that this is a clear-cut issue as it might seem.

In a race between either Miller of Webb against Allen, support for Miller has been a near constant 30-ish percent since December, whereas Webb seems to be going up and down, with a high of 41.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_United_States_Senate_election%2C_2006#polling"">Polling Table from Wikipedia</a>. 

Also, this is probably a lot smaller issue for many other people, but to me, Webb's economic focus is more appealing to me. While Miller focuses on Virginia transporation and energy efficiency, to me that feels a bit like pandering, I've heard that promise far too many times to believe it any more. Webb states a commitment towards free and fair trade, with an understanding that globalization (or as he calls it, internationalization) is occuring and is having major sociocultural effects on Americans. But rather that taking the common populist approach of a wholesome embrace or rejection of the system, he argues for acceptance of the fact that internationalization will continue to occur, and that we need to take steps to fix its unwanted effects. With globalization being such a large part of the power dynamic as it is these days, I was surprised that Miller did not even seem to address the issue on his website, instead focusing on the usual Democratics issues of unfair tax cuts and fiscal discipline. Though I agree with him, I think that this political strategy has not worked in the past and shows no signs of winning any time soon. Plus, for all of the additional writing on his website about the economic condition of the nation, I did not feel like I had read anything new, much of it seemed to be focusing on providing information on the status quo, but not fixed solutions. Before I'm accused of contradicting my earlier statement about Miller being the one with the plan, allow me to note, this refers only to the economics section, and in sections like education, Miller clearly has done more thinking.</lj-cut>

So to put all of that simply, while the idealist in me prefers Miller, I think that with the current state of politics in Virginia, Webb may be the more likely candidate to win. Even though the Democratic Party of VA has made great strides in the last few years, it still needs to face reality, that it is a party in a solidly, proudly conservative state, and that change will not happen overnight. To be honest, I don't hate Miller or anything, if he's nominated, I will back him, I like many of his positions. But I have strong doubts whether he will be able to be the man to lead the Democratic party to victory in November."

"event","So back in VA for spring break, and given how I'd fallen behind on the news, I figured I'd try to watch the nightly news again, at least during break. So, tuned into CBS and NBC, to find an interesting little story yesterday.

<a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11947276/"">Debate rages over media's role in Iraq war</a>

So basically, a number of conservative pundits and the President are accusing the media of just showing the bad part of the war.

Um. Ahem. Ok, so you are right about one thing. The media does have an agenda. As part of a corporate conglomerate, as rules from basic microeconomics tell us, businesses exist to make a profit. To make a profit, the media has to report on things that people actually care about. Be honest now, what are you more likely to watch, ""People killed in a dramatic day of uprisings"" or ""People went to work today""? The second wouldn't even make local news. Its not about the media being ""liberal"" or ""conservative"", its the media showing people what they want to see on a news program. And the media is an equal opportunity deal, before the war, we did not see that many images of happy Iraqis going to college in Baghdad? Instead, viewers got scenes of the victims of Saddam's systematic gassing execution policies in the north and southeast of Iraq. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Saddam's policies were not true, it's turned out to be more true than we first estimated. The media is simply doing the same thing today, showing the things that will make people you know, actually care about whats going on Iraq and in the world. Furthermore, what really constitutes more ""news"", people dying or people living as usual? Sure, you could say that the same thing just happens day after day, but tell that to the families of those killed. Could you really go up to the families of soldiers killed in Iraq today, and tell them, sorry, your child isn't good enough for the evening news? So its not as though there is a massive liberal conspiracy out to derail policies in Iraq or anything, its just the news being, well, the news. The high occurence rate of news stories related to death in Iraq is just an indicator of the sad reality that people are dying out there.

I will agree with one point though, that the insurgents are rather media savvy this time, utilizing natural tendencies of the media to amplify their cause. But is that the media's fault? Should the media simply ignore hostage situations in Iraq?

So, that was Tuesday. Then came Wednesday. <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/i_video/main500251.shtml?channel=/sections/eveningnews/videoplayer3421.shtml"">CBS Evening News ran a section on Al-Hurra</a>, the US government financed, Springfield run, Arab language satellite television station that I admit I had forgotten about for quite a while. Um... we were talking about media manipulation I believe? Oh yeah, it costs the government $70 million a year. I have to admit, I'm a little more conflicted over this one as an independent issue, it is true that programs such as Radio Free Europe played important roles during the Cold War. However... given the rhetoric that was used to attack the American media, that certain groups would manipulate the news, there seems to be a bit of cognitive dissonance here. Hm... well, I guess yeah... ""If it bleeds it leads"" applies again?"

"event","Hm... so the JUSA (Japan-United States Association) Culture Show went rather nicely yesterday, though there were a lot of short-shorts (the radio exercise part) and rice ball crazinesses involved. And I don't know if I want to start getting in the habit of doing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">bon-odori</span> (folk dance) around my friends. I can now make rice balls rather quickly, but with the provision that I'll get rice all over my shirt. But nonetheless, a fun day.

Other than that... hm... just general craziness I guess. Still need to watch the second part of My Sassy Girl, the second half of Infernal Affairs III and several other movies. Well, several of my friends have stated they will convert me into a FOB by the end of the year... given the rate that they've put Chinese pop music on my computer, things could get rather scary very soon. Also the fact I didn't even know what the term ""FOB"" meant until I came to Cornell is rather... strange? Meh, freakish. I dunno.

And now its really warm again. But I need Coffee! YAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH...! Spring Break in a week! Anyone around then?"

Up til a few days ago, the weather was absolutely frigid, but right after that winter storm passed right by us and hit the east coast, its sudden became crazily warm. Meh, I barely need the over-shirt I'm wearing, I could practically be in a t-shirt. Where is our frigid, windy blast of Ithaca-ting weather? yeah, more or less.

Also, coffee is great for controlling coughing, but not as good for controlling laughing.

So yeah, let's see. Hm.. so yesterday, I got with a group of friends, dressed all in black and went to the dining hall to un-celebrate Valentine's Day. The problem was, the weather was too nice and we were all in a good mood, so we ended up having a lot of fun instead. Meh, it's probably for the better anyway. :p There was an interesting article in the JUSA Gekkan newsletter written by one of the male officers on how Valentine's Day is a great investment opportunity for females. To elaborate, in Japan, only the girls give chocolate on Valentine's Day, and then a month later, on White Day, the guy gives chocolate back. So he was talking about creating an investment strategy of buying really cheap chocolate, disguising it as something relatively expensive, and a month later, you can count on getting chocolate back.

So today was looking like a no-lunch day, plus the whole falling asleep when I shouldn't have yesterday made for a hectic morning of homework classes run. So I decided to pick up some coffee at Olin library, when my stomach began to order me to pick up something with carbs. So my first response? Annoyed and without time, without thinking, I grabbed several bags of coffee sugar and shoved them in my pocket with the apparent intention of making that my lunch.

About 50 seconds later, there was a bit of ""um...........???"". Sooooooo about that health thing. Yeah, not happening. At least I didn't actually shove the sugar down my throat. Luckily, class ended early... but hm... I wonder if I actually could have survived on three bags of coffee sugar... I'm pretty sure I would have been able to, just rather hyper during 230 lecture.

Well, until now I had rarely used the Napster software Cornell had provided us with, but looks like I need a new way to get music. Arrrrgh, one of the very few decent radio stations in DC... arrrrgh. I mean I admit they had a tendency of playing the same songs over and over, but still.

That being said, I wonder what the new Washington Post Radio will be like. In depth news coverage they say... this better not be anything like the WTOP format, otherwise there would be very little point. Plus, the NPR and PRI stations in the area are already doing that... I don't know if Bonneville can pick up that many new listeners with this project. Unless they move their current web-chats over to the radio... hm... a chat with the Sunday Magazine people over the radio might be popular.

"event","Sometimes, people will start to think Moki has a life. To dispel such myths, I present to you this lj post:
I had not touched politics and law news for quite a while. So, catching up since winter break has been rather interesting.

Just skimmed through the Sixth Circuit's ruling on ACLU v. Mercer County, KY; I think we're going to see this case keep coming and coming. Its another case of the display of the Ten Commandments in front of a government building, in this case the Mercer County Courthouse. In this case, the Court ruled in favor of retaining the display of the Ten Commandments.
<lj-cut text=""While you were gone: Seperation of Church and State? Soooo yesterday"">The interesting thing about this case is that the court makes a very strong statment that one cannot deduce the seperation of church and state from the First Amendment. Then yet again, I think the Court said it better that I ever could as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">""This extra-constitutional construct has grown tiresome. The First Amendment does not demand a wall of seperation between church and state""</span> Hm... given the way the court put it, I think the ACLU might actually appeal this one. Another interesting thing the case raises is the idea that the Ten Commandments, while have a religous purpose, can also have an overriding secular historical purpose. Oh and by the way, if you take offense to the ruling, you are an:
""hyper-sensitive plantiff""
""'eggshell' plantiff""
Not a ""reasonable observer""
Now I will admit the Court does make a legitimate case in that ""...If the reasonable observer perceived all government references to the Deity as endorsements, then many of our Nation's cherished traditions would unconstitutional"", but it seems a little like they're using an extraneous point to distract the audience.
The Court also spends a page or two sniping at the Lemon test (Lemon v. Kurtzmann), which I find kind of interesting. I brought that issue up in Mr. Torrence's lecture yesterday, where he promptly shot me down by telling me that the Supreme Court had to overrule Lemon to overturn the Lemon test. Nonetheless, there seems to be a solid movement to re-examine the Lemon test, whether at the Circuit Court Level or at the level of Antonin Scalia. I'm interested as to how Chief Justice Roberts will handle cases relating to the Lemon test.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the Court is a bunch of right wing fanatics or anything (Although the Sixth is mainly Bush appointees, there are quite a few of Clinton's). I am not neccesarily calling for the removal of the Ten Commandments from the court either (I will admit, the ACLU did not seem to make the best case they could have). I just really don't like how the court ruled this one, its as if they left the courtroom with a chip on their shoulder.
Here's the opinion if you care: <a href=""http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/05a0477p-06.pdf"">ACLU of Kentucky v. Mercer County, Kentucky</a>
</lj-cut>
And no, it's not one of those 100 page opinions, its only 14 pages, of which I only read the last few in depth.

Ok, so what else have I been doing? Kwanza Extravangza was rather awesome, managed to run into so many people I haven't seen in so long. Visited TJ on Tuesday and Thursday with Justin and Erin. Highlight of the visit, walking into Mr. T's trailer at 10:20AM, yelling that we'd be taking over the class, and then sitting down as if nothing had happened. One of the students asked us whether we had been paid to join the class. It was an interesting lecture though, on the Kitzmiller v. Dover case (Dude, what's with all the religion cases lately?). Also managed to meet most of the syslab people again, and got to see the totally redone syslab at that too. Ran into Menyoung/Alfie/Lee/Dan/Andrew/Melissa/Charlotte about every other minute (yes, you've all been combined. Good god that would be scary.) Mr. Torbert had fun explaining the bling-bling picture. Talked to Mr. Jarvis, Mrs. Groves and Dr. Acio for about 20 minutes each, got a strange look from both Mr. Roses, and then ran into Dr. Dell and Mr. Jarvis multiple times in the hallway (So I yelled at Mr. Jarvis to go back to class... the next visit could be interesting...) Mr. Bell was his usual self, as was the electronics lab, so at least one thing hadn't changed. Ran into several other students, but apparently we missed most of them (what do you mean everyone knew THE day was Wednesday? Logic and reason? bah?)

So yeah, wheeeeeeeeee. Apparently, I am crazy on too much sleep and food. I can't stop eating or sleeping since I got home, this could be very bad once I go back. Meh."

So hi to all. Sorry that its been a long time since I've posted, to be honest, it probably wouldn't have had any coherent meaning anyway. To be honest, neither will this post, but I feel that I at least owe y'all an explanation.

Cornell has been very interesting. If you ask me if I am happy, I would have to say that I am not. On the other hand, if you ask me if I'm unhappy, I would also have to say I'm not. Its kind of like TJ in the love-hate ambiguity nature of the place. But from the disjointed architecture to the crazy study cram sessions, I have to say I really do think that this was probably the right choice for me.

I'm sorry if I was really nasty to you a few weeks ago when I came obscenely close to crashing. Luckily, my body noticed before I did, and degenerated faster than usual, to the point where I wasn't able to eat food for a week. That time was rather scary.

I initially had trouble making friends here, but I think I've finally started to find people that I'm really able to get to know. There are some guys in my suite with whom I've really gotten along well with, and the RA in our unit is pretty cool. I also got to know two girls from different dorms at a dining hall (Okenshields), the three of us are on really good terms now, and they both know me really well from our late night homework cram sessions. Whats scary is that they can finish my sentences now... but yeah, I shouldn't admit this in case they read this post, but they really did help me survive the last few weeks.

People applying to Cornell, it's not Cornell's fault! This place is great, it's simply a matter of how I managed to screw up. So don't withdraw your apps.

So yeah, going back to work now, I'll try to post something more meaningful and informative soon."

Our suite is on the opposite end of the university from the engineering quad, across the gorges, greens and bridges. 20 minutes to get to class, assuming non-rush hour. So at the moment, I walk about 2 hours a day. But exercise is good, so now my parents don't have to panic about sports.

The overabundance of energy in the freshman class leads to the university creating dozens of meaningless orientation plans. I had thought TJ pep rallies were bad, but this Cornell one was even worse. They planned it strangely, putting the kids in the middle of the field just floating around booths, with teams showing up every 15 minutes or so. The enthusiasm would rise for a bit, and then fall. By the time the varsity football team had come, a large chunk had left. Same with the Summer Reading Book Panel. Large numbers of students just started leaving during the speakers. With 3000 freshman in a hot gymnasium, a literary discussion is not easy to do."

"event","Whoa, just finished watching <a href=""http://www.panicstruckpro.com/revelations/revelations.html"">Star Wars: Relevations</a>, and I have to say, I was totally blown away. I first read about Relevations in the <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com"">Technology Review</a>'s article on intellectual property. The general gist is simple, George Lucas has an interesting deal on his copyright of the Star Wars franchise. Authors and such are allowed to freely make spinoffs as long as they make no profit, rather like a Creative Commons No Commercial By Attribution license. As a result, a large number of film makers and such have made a large number of short fan films and such relating to the Star Wars franchise. One group (<a href=""http://www.panicstruckpro.com/"">Panic Struck Productions</a>) decided to take the idea a bit further, creating a 48 minute movie set between Episodes III and Episodes IV, and then allow the movie to be <a href=""http://www.panicstruckpro.com/revelations/revelations_movie.html"">freely downloaded</a>. This is no Flash based 5 minute bs, but rather a full fleshed production. Now how long until the rest of the industry realizes the beauty of new licesning techniques?

The computer graphics in the movie are simply amazing. The one drawback is the fact that I was viewing the movie in WMV, so naturally there was some compression loss. Nonetheless, amazing space combat sequences with the level of thrill of the classic trilogy, but with the graphics of the new trilogy. Furthermore, rather good costuming, though it would have been nice to see more extraterrestial characters. The beauty of the classics was the introduction of non-humanoid life forms, and sadly, they only have a small role in the film. Good scripting, with the wittier dialogue of the classic trilogy, none of the ""Anakin, hold me like you held me at Naboo"" bs. The plot feels more like an Star Wars Expanded Universe story (where there are no clear good/bad, betrayals, plot twists), which was good for me, but might be a bit different for someone used to the movie plots. The sets feel rather authentic, and ironically enough, it was only after viewing the film that I discovered that a sizable portion of the film was shot in Centreville and Central Virginia. The acting is not quite at the level of the classic trilogy, but better than Episode I/II. Rather amazing for an all volunteer crew and cast, most of which had never actually met each other in person, but rather done the work together over the internet."

So at this point, almost all of the cell phone providers, a large number of IT companies (Yahoo!, Google), the vast majority of OSS sites and heck, even the major news outlets (CNN, etc) have shown a serious commitment to promoting web standards. All except, well, Google... the former front runner of internet tech. Now this kind of redeems Delta Airlines from delaying my flight for 3 hours, promising me a hotel room at my connection location (Atlanta Jackson Hartfield, AKA: OMG DELTA EVERYWHERE HUB), and then going back on that promise. Ever seen 200+ people who were promised hotel rooms get turned down at once over the PA system at 12AM after they've been standing in line for quite a while? I tell you, it's not a pretty sight.

Minor interesting note: Atkins Nutritionals has filed for Chapter 11. Goodbye low carb!

John Bolton. What the heck? Liberal media? Heck no. Why the heck is the media ignoring the whole Bolton fiasco and instead focusing on every microscopic detail on the Discovery flight? If this were a liberal media, all mayhem should be breaking loose. Heck, even a conservative media outlet should be going beserk. Bush bypassed the checks and balances system with this recess appointment. He waited for congress to go into recess, then popped him man into the job. Now let me make sure I get this straight. Conservative commentators around the country have been screaming bloody murder at the judiciary for supposed ""bypasses"" of checks and balances. Then the President, who sees BIPARTISAN opposition to his nominee, decides to totally bypass the Senate and just put his man up in the ambassadorship til `07. Colin Powell opposes him. Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) doesn't like him. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) has doubts. George Voinovich (R-OH) opposes the man. This man (Bolton) provided factually incorrect information to the Senate. He told them in his statements that he had not been questioned by an investigation in the last five years. He was questioned 2 years ago over allegations resulting from pre-war intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. The State Department has admitted to it. And thats only the beginning of what the Senate hearings, media, etc have uncovered about him.
[/angry liberal]

But as a constitutional matter!
I could rail against Bolton for quite a while, but what really inflames me is the fact that Bush totally IGNORED the Senate. My way or the highway, eh? It doesn't matter if Bolton was a socialist, conservative, green, liberal, communist, neo-nazi, neo-conservative, pro-market, or anarchist, he still has to go through the Senate, he still has to pass the judgement of the PEOPLE. Maybe the fact that he couldn't make it through was a sign of discontent? That people didn't want him? This should have been put up to a vote. If you can't override a possible filibuster, thats a sign that the country is discontent.

And this sets up a dangerous precedent. What's there to prevent some president from appointing some guy into the ambassadorship as another recess appointment with little to no analysis of their background, only for them to turn out to be some political extremist? The confirmation process exists for a reason, and is a well used and tested method. Nobody is automatically entitled to a free ticket for such a job in the government without the approval of the American people.

"event","Good morning from San Diego. Back in the home state! (well, not really, was only in CA for about a year...)

So yeah, strange reason I'm here all of a sudden. My dad is attending the <a href=""http://www.esri.com/events/uc/index.html"">ESRI ArcGIS conference in San Diego</a>... the big daddy of ArcView... so I'm surrounded by about 10,000 ArcView users. As my sister would put it, this... is a little strange. So it's like WWDC Mac fanatics, except ArcView. And the problem is, so many ESRI users are in the city that no matter where I go, people are talking about ArcGIS. Gaaaaaaah. Geosystems was supposed to be over. But I got a trip out of it, so I'm not complaining.

It's a pretty cool city though. I've gotten to reconnect with my inner liberal by enjoying the benefits of tax payer money well spent on public works (something that's far too scarce in the South, the well spent part), Balboa Park and the MTS Public Transit system are both amazing. Though apparently San Diego is one of the most conservative of the Pacific coast cities due to the big Navy presence at Coronado. Talking about which, I'm pretty sure that I saw 1 or 2 Nimitz Class CVNs in dock from the trains, so I guess the Navy is finally going back to a stand down schedule. It is pretty hot, but at least it isn't humid, so it feels relatively nice. I'll try to post pictures eventually..."

"event","So yeah, finally unload on highlights to trip because my jet lag is finally going away. A week later. It's not really LIVEJournal...
<lj-cut text=""Random Highlights Long Blah Blah Mostly For Own Records Keeping"">
So yeah. Visited Hiroshima again this time, and checked out the Atomic Bomb Memorial Park. Which ironically enough, is one of the largest reasons why I'm a super conservative in Japan (What, Japan isn't the root of all problems ever? Blasphemy), but a super liberal in America (Oh no, America is not always 100% right). The place still sends chills through my spine every time I visit. Though interestingly enough, the invitation by Hiroshima's mayor to Kim Jung iL and George Bush to the Atomic Bomb park still stands... neither has taken up on it.
So Japanese politics. One thing you won't see in America are the grass-roots campaign trucks. They outfit small trucks and vans with loudspeakers, and then drive them down main street, with the candidate/group yelling out their political agenda. Works very well with right/left-wing extremists, otherwise, serves to make your population even more apathetic to voting.
Conveyer Belt sushi rocks. Although I still don't understand why they serve french fries as a side dish option along with sushi.
So they now have a Ramen noodle museum in Shin-Yokohama. It's quite interesting/sad, they have all the old instant noodle cups and sets, along with the more modern and more real ramen. Meh.
So we spent most of our time in Yokohama and Tokyo... shopping. Japanese department stores are teh bomb, they stock everything from fresh fish to sunglassses. I feel too much like a Capitalist.Shopping.Whore. Meh.
So Japanese marketing techniques! Panasonic just rolled out a new family of Plasma TVs called Viela. So they were running an ad blitz. Then one day, my dad and I happened to be visiting Roppongi Hills (The new business district), and these Panasonic people were like, go look at the Viela display! So we figured we needed some way to kill time, so we went to check up on it. 40th floor, exhibition hall. Fully stocked with coffee, cake and a harp player. All totally open to the public. For free. Free food -> high schooler = What the heck are they thinking? What blatant bribing? What do you mean I'm now a sucker for Panasonic *looks at new Panasonic SD card*?
Only with Japanese airlines do you get flight attendants running around the terminal every five minutes, yelling out the next flight number that's departing, even though it's simultaneously being announced on the PA system.
And one of the most random Jingrish examples. So there was this convenience store set up near a bus terminal, obviously as a big tourist trap. So I guess the owner decided to try to attract foreigners by writing out the shop type in big letters along the wall. However, they also seemed to have the annoying Japanese tendency of shortening every possible phrase invented. So they had posted in big block letters across the wall: ""CON SHOP"". There were no foreigners inside.

Ok, so now that the jet-lag is going away, maybe I can stop waking up at 2AM. And going to sleep at 2PM. GAAAAH."

Hiroshima, being near the middle, was madness, because half the people leant to the right, the other half to the left, which made walking up impossible</li>
<li>OMG DRIVING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD. I keep looking right, then left when crossing the street, which is the exact opposite of what you have to do, which means my family is like HAHA YOU LOOKED THE WRONG WAY OMG YOU'RE GOING TO GET RUN OVER GAAAAAAH</li>
<li>This hotel hearts technology! They provide a specialized dial-up connection in each room! By which I mean, you get a phone jack, and then have to connect to your own ISP. So it's more like, look, we give you a phone line, enjoy it. Which is a problem, because of this whole broadband thing. And the wireless network is only on the second floor (where I am right now).</li>

<li>So the whole, moki has long hair thing? And the whole moki hadn't shaved in a week thing? And the moki accidently brought his oldest clothes (read as 6th grade, hey, they still fit) to Japan thing. Yeah, so here I am, walking around a Japanese shopping center, in my longer-than-usual hair and shabby looking clothes (covered in pen stains), apparently made my look like a high school dropout (my mom claims that I looked like a day laborer). So yeah, it was great for getting around, because all the families would get out of my way. I'd come over to an aisle, and they'd all leave. Teh High School Dropout no POWER!</li>
<li>So on my mom's side, my grandparents and my family were supposed to meet at a department store. So at the designated time, my family showed up at the store, and went a looking for my grandparents. So running around, I saw my grandfather a few aisles away, so I waved. He turned around, looked at me, then turned away, apparently thinking i was some one else. (Note: his wife is the grandmother who I called to talk to about Cornell and she thought I was a con artist)
<li>Clothes shopping in Japan is almost as mind-numbingly boring as it is in America. So it's like, UGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH, instead of AUGGGGGGH. And my paternal grandparents would flip out if they saw me as a day laborer. So my mom is like, go buy some clothes. So I waste an hour or something. And then its like, your shoes are a wreck (been wearing the same pair daily for ~2 years). And then cut hair. Apparently my hair had become longer than my mother's in the back. So yeah, I now have strangely short hair again.</li>

Ironic, the very scheme that is lambasted for not being able to render aplpha-channels correctly not only can't render images properly, but is even a potential vulnerability. IE 7.0, where art thou? The dev team has promised PNG support, but then yet again they had talked of CSS 2.1 support, only to drop it. So yeah... alternative browsers are looking nice again. Opera 8 is quite magnificent now, and now supports SVGTiny, which is a big step in the right direction.

Main use won't be gaming, but rather technical stuff, engineering, paperwork, productivity suites, web design (mayhaps...), etc, with maybe a game or two thrown in. Could anyone help me out between the two? I'd probably make it a Linux/Native-OS dual boot anyway, but the MacOSX is really nice, the drawback being the 1.67GHz PPC G4, as opposed to the 2GHz Pentium M Dothan. Any help would be appreciated!"

Hm... so America voters are shallow and vote for personality, and in Europe people overanalyze their votes.

Ok, first off, I don't even agree with a lot of the antiglobalization protestors.

Second, since when have the Young Democrats done that?

<lj-cut text=""Of all angst, CompSci Angst?"">
Three years is a longer time span than I thought.

So for Dr. Dell's Fourth Quarter project, I decided to try out the java applet project to mess with relativity. I figured that I might as well have some fun while working with relativity. Heck, I'd taken CompSci during freshmen year, so I'd still remember enough to survive right?

Wrong.

There's still that nagging feeling that keeps following me around. What if I had taken APCS sophomore year? what if I hadn't switched out at the last minute, hadn't chickened out at the thought of another year of Java? What if I had switched back once I had realized it was in C++? I could have taken post-AP courses in the syslab, been able to have actually learned advanced topics.

So I don't remember how to declare public classes. What the heck...

Maybe I could have seriously considered majoring in CS. Maybe I would be able to understand what the juniors were talking about during lunch in the syslab. I wouldn't have been totally clueless during junior year. People think I'm a syslab geek, but in reality, all I can do is mess with basic web apps and design. That really doesn't constitute actual compsci, its simply a set of superficial applications of limited use.

I tell myself not to dwell on it, and yet I keep falling back on it.

*sigh* Sophmore year was definitely not a high spot in rationality.

Which is why I'm glad I managed to get into a strong CS school.

NOTE: Don't take the above seriously, I'm not actually too depressed over this, its just one of those ""STUPID MOKI!"" moments. Its more of a reminder to myself not to be stupid later in life. Time to cut the angst, get off my butt, and to get working.

On that note, how do I declare an object of a public class in java?

So last night my mom wanted to know what time Kevin's party would be. So I checked my e-mail, and so there was something that was from Cornell. And it was like, hey you, call us now, we'll tell you stuff. So I called them, and they were like, ""yeah, are you still interested? Because we're offering you a place in the Cornell Class of 2009.""

Dang it, I'd actually given up on Cornell ever getting back to me. I was figuring that they'd reject me. My logistically worst case scenario was that CMU woudl accept me one week, and then Cornell would accept me the next week and screw my brain over. Apparently they weren't sure when they'd call me, but my parents had called them last week without telling me, and were like ""So CMU wants a response as soon as they send stuff out. So yeah, could we find out soon?""

Alright, so the thing that's been nagging me for quite a while.
So has anyone else noticed that Z104 and WTOP play a strangely high proportion of Church of Latter Day Saints ads? It's those ""family values"" ads, with the whole things on patience and talking to one another. Well anyway, I checked up on their corporate structure, and both are owned by <a href=""http://www.bonnint.com/"">Bonneville International</a>, as referred to during broadcasts on WTOP. And naturally, the entirety of the Nationals Network is also owned by Bonneville, so in the area that'd be WFED, WTOP, Z104 and WGMS. Now, this is where it gets interesting. Bonneville makes a whole case about how they stress family values. Strangely enough, most of Bonneville's stations are located in Utah, with a few exceptions, notably the Washington DC Area. What the site is less overt about is the ownership of Bonneville International itself. Bonneville is owned by Deseret Management Corporation. Deseret is a fully owned affiliate of the Church of Latter Day Saints.

DUDE.

Weird. I mean, this is Washington DC. Why here, and not say, Colorado?

So like, Z104, WTOP, WGMS, and WFED could theoretically start broadcasting Mormon propaganda.

Now the reality of it is that that the stations are pretty nondenominational about their programs, heck, they put less emphasis on the Jesus Factor than <a href=""http://www.630wmal.com"">630WMAL</a>, which is an <a href=""http://www.abc.com"">ABC </a>owned channel. And the fact that they're affiliated with the Churhc of Latter Day Saints might explain why the stations so focused on community efforts. 

Don't get me wrong, I love all of the Bonneville stations. Heck, I listen to Z104 constantly. But yeah... that explains the strangely high number of Mormon ads on the radio as of late. And I gotta love how their programming is still superior to the BS <a href=""http://www.clearchannel.com"">Clear Channel</a> tends to throw at the region. Meh."

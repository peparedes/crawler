     Are you insane? I drove you to cheat? How can you say that? I gave you my heart and you broke it. You are not the victim here, Michelle. You cheated on me and ripped my heart out in the process. I loved you so much. I thought we'd be together forever. The night you left me was the night I planned to propose to you. I picked out the engagement ring thinking about how happy you'd make me when you accepted it. I imagined us ten years from now with a family and a nice house in the suburbs. We would have been so happy together. I would have done anything to make you happy. I'm sorry about your parents divorcing. I really am. My parents divorced when i was 15 years old so I know what you're going through. I'll come over and give you a shoulder to cry on, but don't expect anything else to happen. I gave you my heart once; I won't give it to you again. I learned my lesson the first time around.

Sincerely,
Kyle"

     Hello Trisha. Let me start by giving you my deepest sympathies. I had hoped that I would never have to represent your husband in a case such as this. As your lawyer, I can't promise anything. As your friend, I promise to devote all my time on this case. Rest assured, you are getting the best legal defense out there. We will plead not guilty and we will win. I know what really happened that night, and I do not believe Joe killed that man in cold blood. Joe and I have been friends since our college days. He has a hot temper, but he would never intentionally hurt a soul. Be strong for him, Trish. He needs you.

     I'm so sorry Kyle. Leaving you was a huge mistake. I know I hurt you, but you hurt me, too! Your accusations drove me to cheat on you. My god, how could you think I'd do such a thing to you? I loved you! I still love you. Terrence was just a friend and you accused me of sleeping with him. I couldn't deal with it. I ran to Terrence and he gave me a shoulder to cry on. Things got out of hand and yes, I did sleep with him that night. But it was wrong, all wrong. He isn't you and he never will be. I want you back Kyle. I need you. My parents are divorcing after 20 years together and I don't know what to do about it. It's their life, but it's affecting mine in the worst possible way. My dad's been having an affair with his secretary for the last two years. Two years! How could he do that to my mother? Her heart's breaking Kyle and so is mine. It's been broken ever since we called it quits. I want another chance with you. This time, we'll make it work. You meant the world to me for a year. You can't tell me that year didn't mean anything to you because I know it did. You loved me once Kyle. You can love me again. Let's get together for dinner sometime and talk about this. If you can't be here for me as a boyfriend, then at least be here as my friend.

     I wish I didn't feel this way, but I do. I love you. I always have. The moment I saw you enter the room, I knew in my heart that you were the one. I had Clara introduce us because I needed to meet you. When you told me you were married, I was devastated, but I kept up a cheerful disposition because I didn't want to make you uncomfortable. For years now I have watched you try to please a husband that cheated on you at every opportunity. It kills me to see you hurt by him time and time again. I can no longer be quiet about this. I want you to leave him. I know it is not my place to say so, but I can't stand to see you with him. He doesn't deserve you. It is not your fault he can't stay faithful. You can bet that if you were mine, I'd be faithful to you for as long as my heart beats. Please, know that I have only your best interests at heart. The thought of him mistreating you like this makes me want to kill him with my bare hands. I love you. I can make you happy. It will take time, I know that, but the reward is too great for me to continue seeing you with a liar and a cheat. You don't deserve that. No one does, but especially you. Please, let me help you and love you as I have for the past couple of years. It is ok if you don't feel the same for me. I can deal with that. But for godsake do something and make your husband pay for all your heartache and tears. I can and will be your friend and support you. And love you. Always.

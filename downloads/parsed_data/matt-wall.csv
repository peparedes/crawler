"event","But oh well. This is what I'm doing on Friday night at the Bank and Blues, and you're all welcome to come. This is the first time I'll be performing the songs from my solo project with a backing band, so I guess that makes it a little less solo, but let's not quip over technicalities. I'm really honestly excited to be playing these songs live and I'm feeling really lucky to be supported by such great musicians like my brother, Amy, as well as Terry and Clay from the Transfers. For a while, especially since the lengthy hibernation of Radon Moon, I started to think playing music was a thing of my past, but lately I've been getting pulled back into it whether I like it or not, because there are so many positive people in my life who just won't let me stop. They know better than I do, I guess, that music is something that needs to be a part of my life. I've realized it makes me happy so I'm gonna keep doing it for as long as I want. So there, maybe this is kind of like an update too, so I don't look too much like a complete band deuchebag.

This story goes back to the night before. I was hanging out in Palm Coast with the good folks (my great new friends!) in and associated with the band Carl in the Cosmos. We were talking about psychedelics, and someone brought up the horrific Salvia trip. The room erupted into mutual cries of hatred for the drug and everyone at once attempted to describe their hellish trips. I was right in there with them talking about my 20 seconds of hell when Mike joined in said. ""You got to embrace it, man. Just embrace it.""
    I was mildly impressed at that moment because anyone who could embrace the end over end, slicing, twisting, out of body confusion of the salvia trip must be of some frame of mind.
    That night I had the strangest dream. It was unbelieveably lucid and it had a very unsettling reoccuring element that has lately haunted my sleep and been quite disquieting. I was sitting on my brother's computer, looking at myspace (even in my dream- I'm ridiculous) when a hideously suffocating presence filled the room. I have felt this presence before in my dreams and it has always presented itself as a malignant force seeking to strangle me or do some other terrible kind of harm (I once dreamed that this same figure approached me in my sleep to touch my head and give me cancer). Whenever this presence makes itself known in one of my dreams I also feel this intensely real sensation all through my body somewhat akin to being electrocuted. 
    I have a friend who experiences similar dreams and she calls them night terrors. A Christian going through this ordeal would believe this to be a demonic attack, or perhaps if they're really narcissistic: a battle with the devil himself. I'm not a Christian anymore but I sometimes think that this presence in my dreams is linked to Christianity in as much as I was raised and trained so heavily by the church on such courses of spiritology, demonology, spiritual warfare and the presence of satan in the world. I have come to understand that whenever I come face to face with this hideous presence I am really dealing with a psychological force or construct inside my own mind which was created by the people who educated me when I was young. Being that this figure comes to bring death, absolute fear, and the terrifying oppressiveness of pure evil, I believe that this monstrous incarnation is the ultimate  projection of my childhood fears, my fear of death, and my fear of the unknown.
    It is no surprise to me that in my dream last night, while I sat on my brother's computer, that this terrible presence was coming from behind me from the closet door. I have lived in the same house my whole life, and when I was young I always had an irrational fear of my walk in closet, a fear of monsters and the unknown. I would always insist on closing the closet door before bedtime, which naturally made things eve worse because I'd never know what was actually behind it: letting my mind run wild.
    The familiar electricity started coursing through my body along with an overwhelming fear that paralyzed me in my seat. In that moment I heard, echoed from the real world and earlier that night, Mike's voice saying, ""Just embrace it, man. You got to embrace it.""
    I did. I let myself go. I surrendered my body and mind to this flow of terror and evil and death. I felt myself being lifted, turned around and brought to my closet door. Only this time there were two closet doors. My closet door straight ahead and a new closet door on the perpendicular wall beside it. I'm old enough to know now that my closet is my closet; with pants and shirts and coats that I wear when going out and on with my mature life. But what was this other door? Was it the same closet door from my childhood? The door I saw when I laid in bed terrified?
    I reached for the doorknob and turned. And woke up.
    I was riding on the way to school that day and I thought about death. I wondered if death came on to a dying person like a presence rather than an absence or ebbing: I wondered if it came on sort of in the way it did to the protagonist in Hemingway's ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"".
    Thinking of death made me think of my life and I began to have the strangest deja vu of eight or nine consecutive events, places and eras in life. I wondered to myself if this was a slow version of what the dying get: a march through seasons and feelings, times and events.
    As I left my classes that day and began my trip home from Orlando, the rain had begun to fall. I talked to my father briefly on the phone in traffic and told him that I was about to hit SR 50 and it looked like rain so I better get off the phone. I buckled my seat belt.
   By the time I hit 95 it was nasty. The rain was pouring so hard that I eased back on the gas telling myself not to go over 55mph. I gripped the steering wheel hard and focused hard. Even though I was totally aware, totally conscious and in control of my driving I felt my back tires let go of the road and the back of my pickup began to turn sidelong down the highway. As I started spinning in circles down 95, I thought of my dream and of Mike's voice from the night before saying, ""Just embrace it.""
   In that moment I let go and embraced it. As I spun into the wet median I saw the traffic from the other lanes rushing toward me: the cars, the lights, the semitrucks were all a blur and I thought surely I'm done. But strangely I wasn't scared. I was ready to die. In fact, I was relieved. I thought about my every trouble, obligation, my schooling, my pain, my desires and insecurities: I thought of how they would no longer be of my concern. I was ready to die and I was thankful for the time that I had, but I was also tired from that life and somewhat relieved that I would no longer have to endure the ""impossible concentration"" of always being aware. 
   I thought these thoughts timelessly, it seems to me that I couldn't possibly have had the time to think so much in such a short duration, but it was as if I stepped out of myself and time. Everything was zero gravity and slow motion. I saw my cell phone lift and almost seem to float into some dark corner of the cab.
    I came to a halt on the median, just a foot or so off of the highway facing the headlong traffic. The music that had been playing the whole time seemed to rush back into my reality and I turned up the volume knob and propped my feet up on the dashboard. I was just fine, and I must admit I was and am happy with this turn out. 
    I'm glad Mike told me to embrace it, because I did and I gracefully spun until I regained control. Sometimes I can't help but wonder at a pattern in the events that play out. I'm prone to think it's Jungian syncronicity. Whatever it is I'm thankful to be alive. Strangely enough as I write this, it just so happens that I'm listening to the new Modest Mouse album for the first time. I really can't help but smile knowingly when such coincidencental lines surface while I type away, ""The weather changed for the worse, it came down on us as if rehearsed"" and in the same song- ""Someday you will die sometime and somehow something's gonna steal your carbon"". And the next song that followed it: 

""Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know.
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio.

Oh, it should've been, could've been worse than you would ever know.
Well, you told me about nowhere well it sounds like someplace I'd like to go.

Oh, it could've been, should've been worse than you would ever know.
Well, the windshield was broken but I love the fresh air y'know.
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)

Oh, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know, oh!
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Oh, we talked about nothing which was more than I wanted you to know-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Now here we go!

Oh! It would've been, could've been worse than it had even gone
Well, the car was on blocks, but I was already where I want.
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)

Why should we ever even ever really even get to know?
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Oh if the world don't like us it'll shake us just like we were a co-oh-oh-oh-old.
Now here we go!

Well we scheme and we scheme but we always blow it
we've yet to crash, but we still might as well enjoy it
Standing at a light switch to each east and west horizon,
Every dawn you're surprising,
And the evening was consoling
Saying ""See it wasn't quite as bad as""
Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know.

I was patiently erasing and recording the wrong episodes
after you had proved my point wrong,
It wasn't like I'd let it go, oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh.
I just wanted to catch the last laugh of this show.

Yeah, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know.
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio.
(The dashboard melted, but we ran it good, we ran it good)

Hard-wired to concieve, so much we'd have to stow it
Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants.
Don't wear eyelids so I don't miss the last laugh of this show.
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)

Oh, we could've been, should've been worse than you would ever know.
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, you told me about nowhere well it sounds like someplace I'd like to go-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Now here we go!

Well we scheme and we scheme but we always blow it
we've yet to crash, but we still might as well enjoy it
Standing at a light switch to each east and west horizon,
Every dawn you're surprising,

Oh it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know.""

  This weekend was amazing. My brother and I went out to Ocala to hang out with the Rainbow folk which ended up being quite the memorable time. We met some great people, including this lovely couple by the (spirit) names of Loci and Pheonix (although I was informed that their ""system names"" were Daniel and Jasamine. Some other folks we became acquainted with were Whyme, Life, Autodidactic, Feelerprobe, Ogrecowboy, Grandfather Woodstock and many more. Oh ya, and my name's Apollo. (of course)
  Upon coming back to Babylon, we attended Mike McCarthy's B-day party which was good eatin's and socialmalizin's. It was great to see Mike and Heather again and if anyone's wondering, I've got his phone number and he told me to pass it along to anyone who wants it since he has that tendency (as i often do) to fly below the radar. 
   Anyhow, we tipped off our weekend with a great show: Deerhoof and Busdriver. It was a fully amazing time, but speaking of shows there are three really good ones coming up: TV on the Radio, Of Montreal and The Hold Steady. If anyone's going to any of those Orlando dates, let me know so we can maybe arrange some type mutual transportation."

Because people are gay and girls have abortions? Oh wait! I know why. It's because the Da Vinci Code is in theatres."

The new Comeback Kid album is better than the last one in my opinion. The Roman-legion gang vocals must not have been recorded with the full army in the Colosseum this time, which is good. And the lead vocalist is very emotional and even closer to melody than ever before.

Anyone who likes Iron And Wine shoud listen to his new EP, The Woman King, because it is some of the best stuff I've heard by him yet.


In other news, I'm really trying to escape this cultural mindset that romantic companionship is the only way to completion and happiness. I know that isn't true, but do I really? I keep living like it is true, and well, so do all my friends. So does everyone I know. I mean no condemnation of course.

But I'm twenty years old and there is this strange outside pressure on me. And in my mind, I'm not worth as much to myself if someone isn't laying claim over me exclusively and thinking highly of me. I know, and you know, its bullshit, but its there nonetheless beneath all my reason. 

Whatever, I'll just keep making love to life or something, and occasionally masturbate when a I hear a great song."

Okay I made that up. 

But a girl looked at me like she wanted to do that on the way to my way first class.

Actually, my first class doesn't even start for another two hours so there isn't even a shred of truth to this story.

I just posted so I could say what music I was listening to and what mood I was in because I always forget to do that."

I wish I was smart or stupid. Lately I feel like I'm just smart enough to understand that I'm not smart enough to grasp certain concepts. 

This includes but is not limited to economics.

I'm only on chapter 3, and I'm frightened. 

I still don't really see the difference between absolute advantage and comparative advantage.  

But when hardships come, I just remember that in two years I'll be licensed by the state to teach kids ridiculous nuances. 

Oops. I promised myself I wouldn't. But you have to admit that was kind of funny."

       Seriously though, I dreamed about something like this when I was young and thought I would have to go back in time to the early to mid seventies to find a dance floor this fun."

    And it just so happens that tonight, this very night, I have found the new Mars Volta album. So if you want it really bad, we'll negotiate the means of transferring. Just give me your aim or something and we'll link up on there. But anyhow its amazing. But don't forget to listen to Radon Moon, because I'm really excited about that too. Oh ya, and listen to the new mewithoutyou album. And the Good Life's Album of the Year."

I could talk about my love life or my misfortunes but God I don't want to be ridiculous. So with an utter lack of anything to do I'll put up this poem that I wrote the other night. I hope it just changes  your life...  :P

               Of Autumn and the Stars
                By Matthew Wall 
 
I am a tree on a wooded precipice, 
Or at least briefly as twilight falls,
And all is frozen in that final view,
Where crooked lined horizon is finally made smooth.

Now enter lights above; below, 
They hum and then they harmonize, 
The song of Appalachia.
A symphony inaudible,

Here Autumn breathes her evening wind, 
So delicate and sinister,
She reaches with her subtle hand,
To pluck the leaf from branch and stem. 

And it is here in this moment,
Staring at stars through the intricate branchwork, 
That I feel incredibly old,
Worn and just incredibly old. 

For there is no song that has not been sung,
No land yet to be walked upon,
And every new idea thought,
Has already been traveled on. 

What poetry is left in autumn,
The ink of which has long since dried,
And all the light of ageless stars,
Has long been spent on other works.

I am the last person on Earth tonight,
The washed out form so undefined,
Watery blood so far removed,
A tangled mess of endless roots."

I'm going to escape out into the storm this you can rest assured. And then instead of experiencing the fury of a storm in my quiet community, I will see it downtown New Smyrna. If any one else is staying at Bert Fish let me know, and we'll go gallivanting."

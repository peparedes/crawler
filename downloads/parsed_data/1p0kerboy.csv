"event","So last night I'm playing 4 $20+2 SNGs on Party Poker. We reach ""bubble time"" where the tables are short-handed and the blinds are huge. You guessed it, I lost my connection.

I have been losing my connection about once every hour or so since I got road runner in my new apartment a couple of days ago. It was finally time to call Brighthouse Networks. I waited on hold for 15-20 minutes only to hear there customer rep tell me that I have to go through the management at the apartment complex before they can send a technician out. Great, but it gets better. He then tells me that some of the apartment complexes owned by this particular group do not let Brighthouse work on their lines. What do you do in a situation like this? You get drunk! I proceeded to call my apartment complex and left a message on their machine. Then I went to the redneck bar next door and swallowed down a couple of Coronas. They were so good, I went to Racetrac and picked up another 6 of them. (I rarely drink these days). Next think I knew, it was time to piss my chips away in the $20+2 PLO H/L King of the Zoo tournament on Poker Stars. That was fun.

After work today, I went to the management office and explained the problem. I sat with Jeff, one of the managers here, on hold with Brighthouse for another 15-20 minutes. Finally somebody answered and said he would send a technician out. He transfered me so that I could schedule an appointment, where I waited on hold for another 5 minutes. And then it happened. Dial tone. Somebody had apparently hung up the phone from Brighthouse.

I told Jeff that I would call them back on my cell and I left. 20 minutes later, I got through and frantically but as politely as possible explained to them everything that had happened from the beginning. The guy was very apologetic and helpful, and I now have an appointment between 3-6p on Sunday to get it checked out. Of course, the way Brighthouse operates I will not be surprised if they don't show up. 

So I went to the mall afterwords and spent some money I haven't been making on the poker table lately on some new gold hoops. I also got an appointment at Lens Crafters for 1p on Sunday to have an eye exam done. I'm getting some much needed contact lenses along with a backup pair of glasses. Afterwords I went to Circuit City, which just opened yesterday here in Sanford, Florida. I checked out their monitors and video cards and came very close to purchasing another monitor for further multi-tabling on the poker table. I figured I'd wait a couple of days until I was sure that Brighthouse was able to fix the problem.

I finally made it home and was hoping to get some poker action in. Scared of losing more tournament buy-in money, I set up 3 tables of $25 no-limit on Party Poker and began to grind away. I was slightly up and playing well when the following hand came up: I have pocket 8s and flop top set. How should I play it? It doesn't matter because my internet connection went out AGAIN. Needless to say, I won't be playing on the internet again until Sunday night at the earliest."

As any casual poker player (or anyone who has seen Matt Damon in
Rounders) knows, the most interesting poker is played when you get down
to the final two players. It's in these Heads-Up matches that top
players play their opponent more than their cards; we will see
significantly more bluffing and much more table talk than at any other
tournament on television right now. Furthermore, the elimination format
will make it easy to follow for even the most casual poker fans.
""<br>
<br>
&nbsp;I am going on record as saying that this will probably be the
biggest step in the poker boom. A 64 player tournament is going to be
televised nationally throughout the month of May, with a 2 hour season
finale. All of the great players are going to be involved. Just think
of the possibilities! Also mentioned in an article was that NBC is
looking into bidding on the WSOP once the contract with ESPN expires.<br>

"event","Outside of my normal Tuesday grind (work then school...BLAH!) I managed to make it down to the polling location to make my voice heard AND watch the Paris Hilton video for the first time. I'm a little surprised at how shy she was, considering her wild party persona, but then again she was but 19 in the video. I am still planning and now fully committed to my move to Las Vegas early next year after further investigating some financial concerns I had. (I would hate to go to Vegas and go broke! That would never happen, as I am OVERLY careful when it comes to financial decisions). I ordered the Professional Poker Dealer's Handbook last night (along with Mason Malmuth's Poker Essays II)."

"event","I went to a Halloween party last night with some friends whom I haven't
hung out with in a long time. We had a great time! A good mixture of
Rum &amp; Coke, Carona, and Bud Light left me feeling pretty good.
Although I used to party it up back in my day, drinking has become
somewhat of a rare occasion for me now. Which is why I made plans with
this same group of friends to go to Universal Studios' Citywalk the
weekend after next for my friend's birthday. The winner of the costume
contest was Jack and Coke. This dude dressed up as a Jack Daniels
bottle while his wife (I'm assuming) dressed up as a Coke bottle.
Pretty clever...<br>
<br>
Shortly after my anouncement that I was moving to Las Vegas this coming
March, I was offered a position at my workplace (I work as an
electrician) as an administrative assistant, with the intention of
moving into the position of president. I turned it down, telling my
boss that I didn't have the time available to take on a role like this
due to ventures outside of work. My plan on moving to Vegas would have
been to deal poker and play semi-professionally in my spare time. I
have come to realize, however, that the swings involved with playing
limit Hold 'Em are much more severe than I had anticipated. It is a
VERY tough way to make money, although mathematically it CAN be done.
However, I am reconsidering the opportunity for advancement at my
workplace and keeping poker as a hobby. Comments?...<br>
<br>
I have seen it a million times on the one dollar bill:
www.wheresgeorge.com. I always wondered who would have the time to
track down where their bill has been, or who would even care. I got my
answer today. My bill began in Lake Okeechobee and has traveled 122
miles in 10 days. If you've never done this, I recommend you try it
once. You can read the history of your bill. For example, I left a note
saying that I was absolutely&nbsp; sloshed at a Haloween Party, and the
bill was supposed to be a tip that I forgot to leave because I was
drunk..<br>

"event","Session 3 today brought about a $183.50 loss. My bad streak is now at -$629.75 over my past 5 sessions. It really sucks to be running this bad. I'm going to take the rest of today off, and possibly tomorrow. I will be posting hands for analysis at www.pokerforums.net."

"event","As if it couldn't get any worse, my results from today are:

Session 1: -$147.75
Session 2: -$161

My aces got cracked twice during the first session; once by a 4-5 offsuit and once by a 6-7 offsuit.

My jacks got cracked in the second session by a 4-8s.

There is an important lesson to be learned here. Deep within these swings lies the truth. So deep it is, in fact, that it cannot be seen unless you dig for it. If good play always produced good results, wouldn't everybody want to play good then? What would keep the bad players playing bad if they constantly lost? I can easily fade the swings, and I know that I will beat these games."

"event","O.K. I don't mean to be as melodramatic as the title suggests. My
second session today ended at -$36. BTW, for those who don't know, I
play 4 simultaneous tables of the $2/4. I had a cute little hand I was
going to post when one of my opponents hit 2 little pair (twos and
threes) against my pocket aces and then I RESUCKED OUT on the river by
hitting a gutshot. But instead I leave this session with the following
hand in mind:<br>
<br>
Party Poker 2/4 Hold'em (7 handed)<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Preflop:</span> 1p0kerboy is SB with <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">As, Kc</span>.&nbsp; MP2 posts a blind of $2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
UTG calls, MP1 raises, MP2 (poster) calls, CO folds, Button calls,
1p0kerboy 3-bets, BB folds, UTG folds, MP1 calls, MP2 calls, Button
calls.<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Flop: </span>(14 SB) <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"">6s, Ac, 5h</span> (4 players)<br>
1p0kerboy bets, MP1 calls, MP2 calls, Button calls.<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Turn</span>: (9 BB) <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"">9d</span> (4 players)<br>
1p0kerboy bets, MP1 calls, MP2 calls, Button folds.<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">River:</span> (12 BB) <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"">6c </span>(3 players)<br>
1p0kerboy bets, MP1 calls, MP2 calls.<br>
<br>
Final Pot: 15 BB<br>
<br>
Results below:&nbsp; <br>
1p0kerboy has As Kc (two pair, aces and sixes).&nbsp; <br>
MP1 has Jd Jc (two pair, jacks and sixes).&nbsp; <br>
MP2 has 6d Kh (three of a kind, sixes).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Outcome: MP2 wins 15 BB.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
That's right. His K6 offsuit was good enough to cold call two and then
another before the flop. And up against my AK with a flopped ace, his
only outs are two sixes on the board.<br>
<br>
Well, tomorrow is another day!<br>

straight draw on the flop, but a 5-6 offsuit for 3 bets before the
flop? So I hope you can see why I love Party Poker!</span><br>

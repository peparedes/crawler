"event","I realized I whine a lot more to other people when I have nowhere to really put it down. I tried the blogspot thing, but alas, I am coming back to this whiney mess. Let's re-christen this thing with every reason I have to be completely miserable right now.

1. I am officially TWO HUNDRED POUNDS. Not 199, not even 189, not 139 (back when I thought I was fat... pfft). Nope, I am officially fat. How did I find this out, you wonder? No. Not a scale... I found it out by looking at the face of a retail store manager when I went on an interview to work at a ""certAin rEtail stoRIE."" I walk in, the manager looks me up and down and then humors me with a four minute interview. After then realizing that I had been given that look and realizing that oh wow, that would be why I wasn't getting the job, because my two chins and I don't look the part, I then came home to hit the scale, to see if the look on her face matched the numbers on the scale. And there you have it.

2. As if the looking at the scale after employment bias wasn't enough, I then decided to check my school e-mail. It was that LOVELY Tuesday afternoon that I received notice that due to not paying my bill (that I had assumed financial aid would cover) ALL of my classes were cancelled. Therefore this evoked a frenzy of me trying to find enough money to cover tuition in order to pay within the hour. So that was fun. So I paid, within the hour of me receiving that e-mail. Did I get my classes back... no. So guess what I get to put up with for the rest of the semester because I am apparently now categorized into the same group as west chester's delinquent population of drunk girls who forget to pay their bills, have darker skin than 2 chaka khans and spend their time renting out their vaginas for free on the weekend.

MY SCHEDULE
Art History
Italian Culture
Race and Gender in Theatre
Sports, Culture, and Society

Only TWELVE credits, you ask? Oh right, I can't get anything else because everything else IS CLOSED and UNAVAILABLE to delinquent whores like myself.

Whats my major, you ask? Oh right, communications, but I can't get back into my classes ORGANIZATIONAL communication and EVENT PLANNING (you know the two things I want to do with my life) because the dean does not see that I am a student who works hard and WILL NOT help me out at all to get BACK INTO the classes that I had because I still have OTHER requirements I can fulfill and it's not important that I stick to the schedule and it's not important that I really didn't WANT to take summer classes or be here for an extra semester.

3. I wrote my boyfriend a suggestive birthday card. I left it on the coffee table in his apartment. His parents came to visit and read it.

4. I have never felt more fat, out of control or stupid in my life.
I am miserable. And it is 6:01 pm and I am going to bed.
None of this was supposed to happen."

I have so many things to do. So much to consider. 
I can't taste a damn thing or smell anything, which is surprisingly miserable. I can't tell you how many times I wished to not even like food, well... wish accomplished. I get nothing from eating. I can't tell if I need to take a freaking shower, I do not know if my breath smells. My shit doesn't stink. No senses. I went to the minute clinic at CVS and they don't even know what it is. I just want to feel better. The worst part is I really can't concentrate at all. I can't focus on school work - and it sucks. Like i'm ready to buckle down and do the work, but my head hurts, and I rather be sleeping and the medicine they gave me feels like a freaking horse tranquilizer.

I feel really useless lately.
I suck at both of my jobs - I keep making mistakes and i'm not much of a help to anyone.
The guys that asked me on dates, no real follow up... probably because they know they're going to have to fight each other for me and they value their friendship more than hooking up with some annoying fat girl who can't help but flirt with anything, talks too much and makes really, really stupid jokes.

I keep taking huge deep breaths in, in hopes of smelling something, feeling something... anything. My whole body aches and I just long to feel somewhat normal again. I guess this is what I deserve though, i've been putting my body through the ringer between ridiculously long gym work outs, drinking the nights away, smoking, falling asleep at 4am and waking up at 9am, too much coffee, letting the stress pile up. Soon the semester will be over and i'll have nothing left to worry about besides managing my finances, figuring out some school stuff, working out and having fun. I doubt though when I get my 2.something GPA i'm going to be that much in the mood for fun, but I guess we'll see.

I got a Twitter, it's really stupid. It's just a page with glorified facebook status updates. Whatever.
I have so much work to do, so much studying to do.
I don't know what to do.
I just want to go back to sleep... I can't enjoy anything anymore.

"event","Nothing says home to me more than the sweet sweet sound of bickering at 11:30 at night. My parents are ridiculous. I have no idea how the hell they even wound up married, I mean, well I get it, but it just doesn't make sense.

So I was thinking - shit, this could very well happen to me. I could very well wind up being in one of these relationships - a failed forever. It hurts me to look at this - these two absolutely miserable people. I need to promise myself that I will not even THINK about taking a step toward the sacred contract that is marriage without being ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE that there is no better match for me. I'm talking PERFECT, like not one flaw, nothing that gets under my skin - nothing. PERFECT.

So i'm never going to get married.
And if I ever need anything to reconfirm this belief, all I have to do is get my parents in one room.

I'm setting my hopes high.
I honestly personally don't know one marriage that has worked out for the long run and been happy - is that not the saddest thing ever, when me - one person, cannot even pick out two people who seem happily married. Yuck.

I have a cold - which stinks.
I have two weeks left of this semester - which is awesome, I hope I can bring my grades up.
I work at People's Light (which I love) twice this week, and a wedding this weekend - which is also pretty cool.
I've been going out a lot - which I've decided, although harmful, is ridiculously fun and I will stop making myself feel sorry for it, because I shouldn't have to.
I'm really happy - which is great."

"event","Listening to a song that I liked when Ethan and I broke up in the summer, i'm beginning to feel incredibly and overwhelmingly nostalgic for summer. 

I remember sitting in the jacuzzi one night with whoever was working late at the pool two summers ago. All the guys were begging me to come out - because I never really had went to parties much, and I was contemplating it. The guys left and it was me, my friends Crystal and Matt and Danielle. It was dusk and we threw a bunch of chairs in the pool. We had a tea party at the bottom of the pool in our red suits and we ran all the way back to the orange trash and chemical shed and then ran full speed ahead jumping into the tranqulizingly cool chlorine filled water. I remember Crystal and I looked at each other and we just held hands and ran and screamed at the top of our lungs. We closed the pool and hour late that day. I didn't go out, and my legs were sore from pumping them against the concrete. The bottoms of my feet were incredibly calloused from walking around barefoot. I had a scoop next tan and long natural brown hair cascading almost to my waist when wet. Just one red bathing suit clinging to my then slender body. Thunder thighs free - when thunder would strike, everyone would get out of the pool and we would have to go home, with no pay. That one unforgettable summer job - becoming what I thought was a bad ass - before all of this responsibility. Just one red bathing suit - a sign of protection - the only shield from fears of mothers, the water and the world. I miss that red bathing suit. I miss that feeling. Squinting eyes to see through the dusk, completely submerged in the water, the stinging of eyes, feeling around to find where your friend wound up after the jump. 

Trying to understand, learning the hard way, looking for a friend.

We got in trouble the next day for leaving the pool gate keys in the vent of the sauna. Leaving them in there ruined the lanyard that had been on that keychain for centuries. So I made a new one the next day, a dragon fly - just like the old one, but in new colors."

The new semester starts Monday. I have 18 credits, an executive board position in my fraternity, exasperating roommate situations, a wonderful boyfriend, and an overwhelming NON PAYING internship to juggle. I would love to take on a paying job at some place that I really feel comfortable in, such as borders or a cute little eclectic shop in West Chester, just to bring in some extra income, but I know if I do, I might not keep my sanity and my GPA in suitable statures.

I'm watching Bridget Jones's Diary, and she writes, just like I do... but I know i've lost a lot of my humor within my journal entries, and life in general. It's going to get there. I must gain my confidence back. So here goes my Bridget attempt at summing up my progress within the first nine days of the new year. 

Total number of days I have been actually really whole heartedly and action oriented working towards achieving my goal of extreme weight loss: 1.
Total number of calories i've eaten over my self-prescribed limitation: 10,000+
Total number of huge mistakes i've made that I really regret: 1
Total number of huge mistakes I refuse to admit to: 1
Total number of out-bursting episodes of self doubt: 3, give or take
Total number of awesome haircuts i've gotten: 1!
Total number of pajama pants I can fit in that are mine: 0 (hooray weight gain)
Total number of days more I think I can handle living life like this: 0

So that's that. Back to school in a few days, back to the normalcy of having a set schedule and specific places to be, other than on the phone with countless clients for my job with no obvious or currently present reward.

this new year i plan on...
1. loosing a great deal of this extra weight that i trap myself (fifty pounds?) in by eating healthy (organic & possibly even vegetarian!) and working out.
2. work on getting ahead in my career by joining ISES and networking with other event coordinators, looking for new and different opportunities and working hard.
3. achieving good grades in school by studying hard and staying focused.
4. being as involved with the college experience as possible by staying active with Phi Sigma Pi, joining University Theatre and becoming more involved with my Communications major and new Theatre minor!
5. be a better person by being more honest, treating people the way i would want to be treated and focusing on how the decisions, words and actions i choose, say and take affect the people around me.
6. be thankful for what i already have, and don't try to change too much!

I know I have some pretty big goals listed, but I really am happy with the accomplishments i've made in 2008, and i'm sure 2009 will bring on more excitement and great things. I'm ready to start living life how i've dreamed it to be.

"event","It was a dream come true to work my first wedding yesterday as a wedding planner assistant!! 

I couldn't have picked a better wedding to help on because it just went so smoothly, no crises, thank goodness!! The wedding was for two surgeons (Anne = the cutest bride ever!! and Carl) in the Crystal Tea Room (gorgeous/expensive) in Philadelphia! It was a beautiful christmas type themed wedding, but not too christmas-y, it was classy and elegant and snowflakes were paired with while lights on christmas trees throughout the ballroom, the tables were adorned with high highted centerpieces with a floating orchid in the vase, and on top, red and white roses. It was very pretty.

In the morning I was at the Ritz Carlton in Center City with the bride helping her get things together and then load up the bridal party into the limos ALL BY MYSELF! Eliza, the head planner, left me after 15 minutes of being there in charge of the bridal party for the morning! After I loaded up the bridal party into the limos, I then rushed over to The Crystal Tea Room to grab my car and meet up with the bridal party at an Armenian church which was about 40ish minutes from the city. After the beautiful ceremony, I hung around the church and took down the decorations from the ceremony and then watched the formal pictures get taken. After the bridal party and guests had cleared out of the church, I left the church and headed to the Crystal Tea Room for the reception. When I got back the cocktail hour was just beginning. I then stood by the place-card table when all of the guests arrived assisting them in finding their place card. Soon after I helped line up the bridal party for their grand entrances. Then the reception started and I basically just hung out with the other planners to make sure everything went smoothly, then when the reception ended at 11:30, we made sure all the florals and everything got cleaned up, and then headed out!

It was amazing. I love it so much and i'm so excited to do it for the rest of my life.

I'm not sure if i'm going to work on the New Years wedding, after last night's whirlwind, I think I may just skip out on this event, but we will see. I have to talk things over with Ethan and everything and really decide if i'd like to drive home at 3:00am to my empty apartment on New Years after work. I really would love to work on the wedding, i'm just not sure how i'll figure it out. I guess we'll see!

So that was fun.
Life is great.

i do have best friends. great ones. it just stinks that they're spread... now transcontinental.


i'm having a christmas party tonight, the 3rd annual eve eve party. even though last eve eve wasn't really a party; just more of a gathering.

i miss ethan. i hope he likes his christmas presents. i wish he could be here tonight and didn't have to work today and tomorrow. :( i also am sincerely hoping that it does not snow tomorrow night and that he can make it home on christmas eve to be with his family. it would be beyond sad if he got snowed in.

so what is new in my life... well i love my internship, a lot. i've been doing a lot of paperwork and phone calls for head planners, but this saturday is my first WEDDING! :) i am so excited to just dive right in and see what it is all about. i've been dreaming about this industry for such a long time that being in it is just like a dream. calling vendors, even the most mundane tasks... they are all so special to me, because i know i'm helping to make someone's day special and i'm part of organizing something big and beautiful for a couple, which is exciting. i'm also working a new years eve wedding!!  which is cool... but will also denote the 3rd year in a row that Ethan and i do not kiss at midnight. my wedding is in philly though, and i think he might spend new years in philly too... who knows, so maybe just maybe i can get some new years magic. lord knows though i'll be knee high in flowers or something, or fielding off drunk groomsmen (which i'm warned by coordinators is what a lot of interns do all night). we will see. 

i got the rules for weddings, and it just clearly states: wear black, don't cry, don't dance. 

... okay.

so my life is exciting. it's weird though, everything in my life is going exactly how i had planned and dreamed it to be. i'm on the right track. i'm getting my degree... OH AND I'M MINORING IN THEATRE BY THE WAY, which is awesome because it's my biggest hobby and i thought i had to give it up, but i've been able to work it into my major so that the credits count for my minor and major, with a little white lying about the fact that I want to go into theatre management, which really isn't because i'd so do that if i had the chance! :) So yeah, we'll see how that goes. I just hope I like the classes, but honestly... how can you not like getting 3 credits for a class titled ""Stage Make-up""... please tell me that.

All i know is i'm pretty excited about life i guess you could say, excited in the fact that i don't really have to plan, for the first time in a long time i'm settled in and i can just go with the flow and enjoy things! it's great.

so i'm going to bake all day for this party, and just enjoy myself.
tomorrow we have christmas eve at my cousins.
christmas day we're doing breakfast with the fam, presents, then volunteering at the soup kitchen, going to see marley and me and then i'll go over to ethans.
the 26th i have to drive back to west chester to work weddings on the 27th and 31st! :)

So my job in the wedding industry is taking flight. Right now I am definitely the intern making calls to vendors and trying to book things and figure things out, but it's exciting. It's a good way to break into the industry. I just realized that this is what my life is going to be like when i'm a planner. Making calls, working things out, booking appointments, planning, designing, helping. I like it, I think. I hope. I have the opportunity to work a 350 guest New Years Eve wedding in Center City Philadelphia, and i'm excited about it. I guess that will be the test to see if I really love it and have what it takes. I have a few appointments with planners and their clients before that, but basically now I work from home. It works. The whole not getting paid thing though is a bit rough, just because I really could use the money, but this is the first step, my foot in the door. It's all good. My dream has become more of a reality than ever. This is fun.

Im ready to start whooping my butt into shape though. I've really gotten lazy with a lot of things, like my body and school work and just... my overall morale. I've just kind of gotten lazy with life and haven't really embraced as much as I would have liked to, but i'm young, I can change that. I'm going to change that.

I'm excited to go shopping for work clothes. It's always been a dream of mine. It should be awesome. I want to look trendy and cute and just... like I have always dreamed.

Times are good."

"event","i could go about life like you. getting guys to only like me for my body and never having real substance. i could look like the girls from the hills and starve myself and spend more time at the gym than with my books and spend more money on clothes and make-up than books and going out to eat with my boyfriend (unlike you who probably sleeps with someone new every night). i could do that. BUT I DONT WANT TO BE LIKE YOU. i have a brain, i may not have the best shape, but i have a brain.

back to middle school again, where people are calling me fat. 
it's ridiculous though that this happens in a party at my own house, upon 5 minutes of my arrival.

i love sitting in my room hearing the party going on outside.

even my old sources of entertainment have gotten bored with me and cannot be bothered. no matter what time of the night.

it's sad. we watched how music videos exploit women today in my mass com class and i realized i really just exploit myself. i really used to pride myself in being such a strong girl. i coward to him all the time now.

i just know i can do better.

i need to work on my figure. invest in my future more. hell, figure out my future more. i got the internship of my dreams today, and i was so excited about it... that is before it happens. maybe thats because i ate nothing today but a venti coffee and a whole pizza, and wore myself down to the bone and picked some fights and gave up in my one class.

i'm just all over the place, and i'm out of shape, in so many areas.
i have nothing to wear. i don't know who i am anymore.
i'm wondering if i'm letting you define me.
i don't know what i want anymore.
and i know you don't care.

I remember the first time I saw it was around christmas time with Anthony Bortone, and it was before Ethan and I started officially dating and I was contemplating whether or not to put myself out there and tell him how completely crazy I was for him.

I had big dreams then.
I never though i'd see myself here.
My life is pretty normal. How did I get to this place.

I feel like college maybe makes you stop dreaming.
Or maybe i'm letting myself settle.
I don't know.

I miss my pets.
I miss my family.
I want hot chocolate and snow outside.
I want to be home for christmas and take bubble baths and sleep in.

"event","I skipped Italian this morning because I was so tired from staying up to watch the whole election, and then after the election, I was still so excited that I couldn't sleep. I'm pretty happy to be a part of history. I think we all should be, no matter how we voted. This is a momentous occasion that shouldn't be eluded to ""a black man in the white house"" or a ""terrorist in the white house"" or whatever have you. It is more than that it is the ever apparent and applicable quote stated by the President Elect Barack Obama himself that NOTHING CAN STAND IN THE WAY OF THE POWER OF MILLIONS OF VOICES CALLING FOR CHANGE.

Quit your bellyaching. It was a vote. The majority won. Have hope.

""I'm moving to canada"". In his speech last night Obama spoke of a one hundred and six year old black woman who has lived through times where she was unable to vote due to her gender, and then her color of skin. She is still living in America, why should you move to Canada? Be thankful.

Nothing has happened yet, and Obama has only won the battle, not the war. I will be the first to admit he has a lot to prove. There are four years ahead of us, a long journey of uncertainty. We as Americans are in a dark time that will take a lot to get out of, but instead of presenting yourself as a cloud on a sunny day, I challenge all nay-sayers to have hope for the future, and believe in the future, trust America's majority decision and stand up and be American. I know personally that I would be doing the same no matter who was announced to be present elect. This fight over race and the name calling, everything, it is absurd. This is not the dawn of socialism or the end of the world, it is a change. Youth has been brought into the white house, a democrat, a light. Nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change.

To get even more political, WHAT THE HELL CALIFORNIA!!!! REALLY?!?! REALLY?!?! Like... REALLY??
I don't know what it will take to get it through people's heads that we are ALL CREATED EQUAL.

Inhale, exhale. 
Alright.

So in other news (and way less important). I think I may have found a potential apartment for next year. The VP of my fraternity is moving out of her beautiful two bedroom on a quiet street close to campus and I hope that Michelle will approve and that it is still available and we can make the necessary arrangements to obtaining this beautiful space for next year! I guess I have not mentioned in here that Michelle and I are planning on living together. Michelle is Ethan's roommates girlfriend, we both hang out around the boys a lot, we're both pretty chill when it comes to living and stuff and she needed a roommate and i'm looking for some peace and serenity in my next living arrangement, so it really feels as though it is the perfect match. Hopefully we can be lined up with this apartment!! I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

May I mention how much I love West Chester. I really feel like I belong. I am happy. I think I have finally really felt as though I am assimilated into this new college life. I am happy with all. Last night, sitting at my fraternity's election party looking around at everyone either arguing about politics or the current game of cranium, I realized something, how incredibly lucky I am, and how my cards have all really aligned for me, without much effort on my part. I am so happy and really have all i've ever dreamed of having within my college experience. I really love Phi Sigma Pi, and am so proud to have a strong brotherhood here on campus to turn to and rely on. Sitting in Abbie and Becca's apartment last night, looking around, I realized, wow three months ago I had no idea these people existed, now I feel so strongly towards all of them and know that I will never forget any of them. I am thrilled.

Between election day, the phillies winning the world series (even though i'm not a ""phan"" the excitement was bursting through philly and the surrounding boroughs, I couldn't not be affected by it), halloween (I was Ugly Betty, it was awesome) and everything else thats been going on. This has been a really memorable semester that has been going by so fast, I'm so excited and happy.

So some upcoming events that are occupying my calendar!
Thursday I have a test in Mass Communication, i've been pulling high Bs on those tests, I am expecting the same.
This Friday is kickball, a fun event within my fraternity.
Saturday is the Phi Sigma Pi 20th anniversary celebration formal! I bought a beautiful dress (for $13.99 might I add) and am really excited about dressing up and enjoying the evening with my brothers that I love so much. I was in charge of making the ""iMovie"" for the night with a collection of images from the past 20 years. I'm hoping that everyone likes it and technology doesn't fail me. I don't want to drop the ball at such a big event.
Sunday is final vote for phi sigma pi, where we vote on the initiates.
I have a speech to give next Wednesday, which always bothers me, but whatever, I'm talking about Greensburg, KS and their implementation of sustainable design so at least it is a topic that i'm excited about.
Thursday is mine and Ethan's 1 year and 10 month anniversary. I think we may celebrate by seeing Dennison Witmer in Lancaster with a bunch of other indie artists. That makes me excited.
Next Friday is inductions of the initiates who received final vote into the brotherhood.
Next Saturday is THE MONTHLY BULLDOG FESTIVAL WHERE THEY BRING OUT ALL THE ADOPTABLE ENGLISH BULLDOG DOGS OF HEAVEN SENT BULLDOGS TO A VENUE FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT. If you know me, you can tell how big of a deal this is... haha... I will be in dog heaven.

After these big events, only a few more tests and papers until thanksgiving break, and then we all know once thanksgiving break hits it's a downhill slope. 2 weeks of classes and than finals and than WINTER BREAK! I need to find a job.

So that is my lengthy update for the week/month/however long it takes me to update again.
If you must remember anything about this entry, remember that Sara Murray is probably the happiest she's been in a really long while."

"event","i'm just going to live by myself next year.
like in a single. completely by myself.
or maybe i'll move home because i think my mom is the only person i can depend on.
no one really cares.
my boyfriend can't stop by a party, or care enough to devote more than a few hours to me this week.
he doesn't even care that we didn't see each other at all this weekend. which is SO reassuring when everyone assumes that i'm living with him next year and everyone who is planning for next year doesn't include me in their living arrangements and doesn't even care to ask me where i'm living next year and he doesn't even care enough about me to even be around for me.
my best friend from last year couldn't answer my call when i showed up early for him and didn't call me when he said he would. obviously he doesn't care.
everyone makes their own plans around me.
i miss my temple girls, but i'm sure i bored them when i came on saturday because we didn't go out.
i just keep trying and trying and trying to make everyone happy.
i give up."

"event","i cannot tell you how badly i've been wanting a kitten since yesterday. i think it would be cute. like i want a kitten so badly to the point where i would choose a kitten over an english bulldog. i think because i'm looking for something fuzzy to love me at school because i miss rudy, but know i could never take care of a dog during college, or afford my dream english bulldog, so a kitten just seems so cute. too bad my apartment complex doesn't allow them and my roommates are allergic, even if i snuck a furball in here.

i went out to dinner in town with kellie one of my brothers from phi sigma pi and she was SO NICE. it was cute, and we walked into town together and ate at this really nice italian place. it was so great getting to know her. i feel like i should go on dates with all the brothers, since i didn't have to go through the pledging process here, i really don't know the brothers as well as i should. it would be nice to hang out with each one individually. once i finish my interviews with the pledges i think i'm going to start asking brothers to dinner.

so, anyways, i'm walking home from kellie's and i had to walk 3-4 blocks to get home and it was dark and i was like... oh man... i'm scared. SO, i'm walking and this kitten pops out from under a porch and he starts following me! this not only adds to my kitten frenzy, but he like... is walking behind me. i wanted to kidnap him so bad, but he had a collar so i know he was someones. but it was just so stinking cute. it just made me really excited. i don't know. how lame am i that i'm writing in my journal about it.

well congrats, you've finished reading my entry of least substance.
i'll stop at this... haha because there is a party going on at my apartment in like 2 hours and i want to clean my bathroom.
i am heading to temple tomorrow to visit my freshman year friends. i couldn't be more excited. i'm driving there by myself. i'm the worst driver ever... so this should be interesting. whatever i'll be fine. 

so that is that.

oh, i can't stop listening to honey and the moon by joseph arthur. i seriously am in love with that song.

yeah. that is all."

"event","All I want is a modest apartment, or a small house and him there with me. A dog to start, and children eventually. A wedding ring, the job of my dreams, planning people's weddings, giving them everything they dreamed. I want to plan non-profit events with the money I earn to give back to charities and people who are not as lucky as I am. I guess I feel like this is just a stand still. I'm sitting here, biding my time, getting work done but it's like i'm facing reality like in an old western movie, both of us ready to draw, but no one making a move. I'm just waiting, anticipating and getting ready.

I have no idea who I want to live with next year. There are so many possibilities but really none at all. Sometimes I think, I should just get a studio and live by myself, but then i'd be lonely (well probably not) but it would annoy me. Then I consider being an RA, but then I feel like next year is a crucial year to begin interning and how do you work a wedding on a Saturday night as well as sit in your room and bust freshman for drinking. I mean, I don't know. That would be hard. I'd love to live with Deanna and Jess, we've been getting along so well lately, but honestly i'm not too sure what their plans are and whether or not they'd like to live with me. Then theres the start of my dreams, my apartment with Ethan in town... the option he gave me to move in with him, and get a dog and start our life together. That sound so perfect, but I really think it's too soon... I don't know. My mom is okay with it, probably because she realizes that he is my best friend more than he is some guy who i'd be living with just to have sex with all the time, I think that that is parent's only fear really, otherwise they don't care.

Here is what is going on in my life right now. I have a midterm at 7:00, and I don't know how well i'm going to do. The information seems easy, but honestly, I just read the chapters yesterday and right now, due to my cold and the dumb decision I made to get a venti coffee at starbucks, my head is spinning and the words on the page are jumping, and my thoughts are EVERYWHERE... I don't know how successful i'll be. Whatever. This is my last midterm then I am officially over the hump of the semester. I've been here for 10 weeks, I can't believe it. It really is ridiculous that it has been that long. I will admit I am not counting down like I was at temple. I'm really enjoying my life for the first time in a long time. I really love my life at West Chester and what I am creating here.

I'm the only one typing in the computer lab, I feel like an asshole because I think I type really loud, oh and it's really hot... and I think I have pit stains, so I refuse to take off my sweater. Okay, I just looked around, no one is around me... it's coming off. 

I really love this computer lab. I love the computer by the window. Looking outside I see the old stone castle building and the autumn brushed trees around it. It's gorgeous. Really gorgeous. I love it here. The sky is so blue, and I have this feeling that no matter what happens it will all be okay.

Last night, when I was up at three o'clock in the morning, I had a revalation, that I will admit often crosses my mind from time to time, but I think this time I whole heartedly felt it. I stress A LOT, like over tests and grades and I always do decently, I am smart... I feel like it's the only thing I have, but I realized something... whether I graduate from WCU with a 4.0 or a 3.5 or even a 3.0 no one is really going to know the difference but me. I mean, sure it would be nice to do well, but there is more to life that this hierarchy of intellect that I have convinced myself into following. I don't need to be the best, I just need to get by, and show my skills and intern well, but most importantly, ENJOY LIFE. 

I've been enjoying life a lot more lately. I mean, i'm sure when I get my grades at the end of the semester i'll be a bit dissapointed, but it's okay. I like it better this way.

This is getting ridiculously long, and like I said, I have a midterm in what is now 3 hours. I should at least be looking over the stuff.

But yeah, that is what has been going on lately."

"event","I really gave up a lot by coming to West Chester. I miss the School of Tourism and Hospitality Management so much. It really is the best option for me career wise. I'm suffering here at west chester trying to pick classes that have anything to do with event planning, and trying to join professional organizations and what not. I know that my education here is much less vaulable in the field than Temple would be, it's just, I can't stand living in the city, and when I e-mail employers, i'm sure they think I was not good enough to get into Temple, and they do not respond to my e-mails. 

I just need a good internship, i'm crossing my fingers that Eclatante gets back to me. The first event coordinator I made contact with never got back to me after our initial exchange in conversation, which is depressing, possibly an e-mail will pop up from here, and I feel weird e-mailing her and being like ""forget about me?!"", I just don't know what to do.  Eclatante though is the epidemy of events businesses. An internship there would really give me a heads up in the field. I feel like i'm wasting time at West Chester, but to be honest, i'm really getting the college lifestyle, and though communications is kind of boring, it's broad and versitile just in case my career in events doesn't work out... though it's going to because i'm going to make it.

Sometimes I wish that Temple was here, if it was, literally I think everything would be flawless and i'd be so thrilled. I guess I can't regret though, I just need a good internship and a good first job and to stop worrying and just get through my classes. It just sucks, because everyone from Temple is looking for jobs in the area, and they are way more qualified than I am. I miss my classes there. I loved my classes there. Ugh, this just sucks.

Well, i'm going to go study for Communication Research, how to do research on stuff I don't care about. Whatever. These are skills i'll need, i'm sure. I can take PR here and Advertising and Marketing and learn more versatile things here... I guess.

Note to self: Join ISES and PCMA and see if I can start a chapter here at WCU. That would get me recognized. 

Why am I worrying about this.
I have three midterms this week. 
Ugh, okay that is all.

Oh, don't think that i'm not happy here, I am... I love it. It's just knowing there is better out there is killing me."

"event","you just need to cry.

i think it's being at home that does that to me.

i used to have this boyfriend, a while back, one of the only significant ones i've ever had, and he used to tell me that it annoyed him when i didn't capitolize things. it's weird when you realized you've changed something, and worked really hard to change it, and then lost it again.

it's also weird to think that i'm probably changing so many things about myself right now, and there are times when you're with someone, and you change so much to make them happy, and then one day you wake up and look in the mirror and want to scream, because you're scared, and because you have no idea who you are anymore.

and you look around, and think of who to call, and you realize all your friends are gone, and you think about it, and you realize that they never really were great friends anyways. and you want to write a story about what happened to you, but you think no one will listen. and you put on some music that you know the words to, but cannot remember the first time you heard it.

and you just can't remember, how you got here. but however you did, it was not glamorous, or beautiful like you know you once dreamed it to be.

and there are few that have stuck with you, maybe because they had to, or maybe because they wanted to. but you know they had to, because you left you, so why wouldn't everyone else want to, unless they had to stay.

you try and grow up, and learn new things. and they're teaching you a language that you just can't grasp, and you wonder how you ever learned this one you're writing now... and you just cry thinking of how hard it must have been for your mother to teach you, and you're gracious, so gracious, but there is no way of showing.

no way of showing how far you've come. and they all think that you are someone you're not. someone who starts every sentence with a capitol, and does what she was taught, and doesn't forget things. but i do. i forget a lot.

i'm starting to forget her.

and i'm scared to look in the mirror. 

i still see myself how i was. but it's weird, on nights like tonight, when you look in the mirror and actually see yourself. you see this thing, this person, who's worn through it all. and my head is just crying to catch up, which brings on the tears, and i want to change everything, but then again nothing at all. i want to get to know myself, but who has the time really. who takes the time really. 

my throat is like sand paper.
my body aches.
my heart is empty.
i'm pretty sure i'm complacent, if it means what i think it does.

that was the shortest song ever.
and it is too loud.
i think she's my only real friend.

my tissue box isn't where i left it.

i sat on the piano bench in grandma's sun room and played, worked through it painfully slow, over and over bit by bit, one hand at a time, slowly trying to piece them together. she sat, and watched and just watched me try and try and try. i realized i can never go back to that piano, and her home, it's now someone else's. the piano is mine, but it is sitting in storage, ruining itself and doing no one any good. and i am still working through it, painfully slow, over and over bit by bit, one hand at a time... slowly trying to piece them together and she is still watching, just i'm not playing piano anymore.

there was a bomb found in a parking garage on chestnut street in west chester yesterday. it would be terribly ironic if i moved here and nothing happened in philly and stuff like this just kept happening here. it freaked me out and made me feel minorly unsafe. i think i'm over it though. but i seriously don't want to be blown up or shot/ have to worry about being blown up or shot. can people just cut the crap? please. peace... that is all i'm asking for.

i love my fraternity here. i am now an official brother, they inducted me in on sunday night!! this week is rush week, a week in which i get to pass judgement on my peers and decide which ones i deem worthy enough to start calling my brothers. it's fun.... wrong still... but really fun. i'm sad i have to miss wednesdays event due to night class.

i have two more tests this week, and i think they'll be fine. i'm most worried about italian. I forgot how bad i am at languages.

i'm pretty upset about some stuff thats been going on around me. 

Anyways. I sent in my application for my absentee ballot. 
I'm voting for a candidate I know nothing about only because of his political party.
Whatever.

Oh, also. EVERY TIME SOMETHING POPS UP ABOUT EITHER OF YOU I WANT TO THROW UP.
Two nights ago I was looking through pictures to put up on my walls in my room and I found SO MANY of me and you. And you just walk away... whatever. Why does facebook INSIST of putting you on the top of my news feed daily. I think it is honestly just to piss me off. You're so ugly and annoying and ugh. UGHHHH."

"event","i just finished watching extreme home makeover, here is what i am thinking...
1. i love ethan. he watched it with me and looking at him, i've just never been happier with him. he had his first day of work today at his new job, and he tries his hardest and is just... ugh... i just love him so much. i can't explain this feeling. we're so good together him and i. i want to be with him forever, growing up and learning things is part of the process... this... what i'm feeling right now, this is real. this is stronger than anything i've ever felt.

2. i love special needs people. i love them, so much. i know i wouldn't want to major in special ed or anything, but more and more i keep thinking of how my career can include the things i love, like special needs and everything. i think that when i do special events (which i'm positive i want to do) i'd love to organize benefits and fundraisers and charity things and just... do more than plan weddings for snots. my calling in life has to be to help people. i'm not much good at anything else, but i'm good at organizing and nothing makes me feel better than the human connection you get when you do something meaningful like that. things will work out.

3. i love old people. i think it's my mom's fault, not that there is fault to blame. i could have my mom's job and be thrilled. one day i hope to be half as good of a person as my mom is. the public speaking speech that i butchered was about how great she is... i think thats why i'm so upset about it. it's not the grade... i just wish i spoke better about the only person i should speak well about.

4. i miss grandma jo.

5. if extreme home makeover would hire me, well that would be great.

6. i still want to intern at disney. i just don't know when would be the right time.i keep saying maybe next year, maybe next year..."

"event","so i wrote a post last night in a fit of delusion, i seriously don't even remember writing it, so i deleted it.

but i guess tonight's meaningful entry that i will actually be able to recall upon writing does tie in somewhat with the now missing/deleted entry i wrote last night. 

i suck. i've never felt so terrible at something. i had to give a memorized speech in public speaking and it was just horrible. i've never stood up in front of a group and presented something so horrible. i blanked and rambled. i don't even know what i said. i never thought i was bad at public speaking. i think that is my most embarrassing moment. 

i'm supposed to be an ""academic"" i mean, i'm no good at musical theatre, or singing, or music in general... all i have is my grades, and I just ruined them. with a 70 on my first public speaking speech. i will not have a 4.0 this semester. i therefore have nothing. i am at west chester university and i can't even get through a basic course. 

my academic advisor sent me a very rude and trite e-mail today basically telling me that i'm a dumb ass.
i stood up in front of my class and spoke like i'm a dumb ass.
looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's a duck.

oh, and i have this ""stupid RING"" in my nose which makes people judge me, and apparently i smell, and cannot possibly like disney movies and am weird, because of this thing in my nose. so i'm told by my public speaking professor. it is what the nose ring conveys, according to my public speaking book. i like it.

i can't do anything right. 

i do all the group work in my group because no one offers to help me and i go in and my group still contradicts what i do, even though they couldn't contribute.

i just suck. 
i just feel like i suck so badly."

"event","1. I'm extremely neat and organized, and I like when things stay that way.
2. I really like getting an education, even doing homework and going to class.
3. I am really not a fan at all of drinking. I've dabbled in the ""drinking arts"" before and really used to think it was cool, but I am not in any way shape or form happy to drink more than one night every couple weeks or a few nights a month. 
4. I don't understand college kids fascination with drinking. I understand it makes you more free, but I guess i'm just a really free person normally and don't feel I need alcohol to enhance social situations. I'd take a night bowling over drinking in a room any day.
5. I'm really bad with money. I spend every penny on things I need at the time, but looking back I realize I really don't need.
6. I'd die without my mom. She just gets it, and sometimes offers tough love, but there is never a point in this whole situation where she didn't understand where I was coming from and support me. I love her, and I don't know where I would be with out her.
7. I hate noise complaints.
8. I hate confrontations.
9. I will be neat and organized when it comes to me, but I don't like cleaning up others messes, especially when it involves food/substances that gross me out.
10. I am an extremely independent person.
11. I really feel like i'm not learning as much in my major as I did in Temple, but I still like the communications department and hope that I don't wind up regretting getting this degree.
12. I probably will wind up getting my masters.
13. I love Ethan. He gets me and it is easy. We communicate well and understand how each other ticks. It is perfect and simple and everything it should be.
14. I'm not as ""social"" and ""party planning"" loving as I thought I was. Or maybe I see parties for their beauty and their social qualities and will never quite understand a party that has the sole purpose of becoming intoxicated.
15. My roommates will probably never understand where I am coming from, and never fully get who I am now. They might know me from the little they have seen of me, but no one knows the college Sara I created last year. Maybe I should have stayed at Temple, because I was pretty proud of the person I was there. It was a fresh start, here people have these pre-conceived notions of me and think i'm something i'm not. I don't know.
16. I actually do like myself, and I have things I need to work on, but I don't know... i'm not a bad person. I have good hopes and dreams and goals and I love where i'm going with life. I just hope that this works out. I like west chester, I just don't know if it was the best decision for me. Aesthetically it is perfect. I love the location. I've never loved a place more, so it should be perfect right... no... it's not.

My fucking major is communications, and yet I find it the thing I find hardest to do with people who don't understand me. I guess i've always been shy, i'm not very good at meeting people outside a school environment when my brain is not involved and I feel smart. I feel so stupid in social situations.

I'm not a part of your family.
I suck.

I love Ethan and George and bowling and Pat and Michelle and Hibatchi. I love normalness. I love learning, I love West Chester University, I just hate the college mentality. Basically I hate college. I like sitting in my room, I like doing my work, watching movies, going out occasionally. I like peace. I'm a quiet person.

That's the biggest thing i've learned. I am simple. I am quiet.
I think next year/semester ASAP i'm going to apply to be an RA. 
I think that would be fun/perfect for me. I don't know why I haven't thought of it sooner. I guess I wanted to get used to west chester without working, but I think I have the perfect mentality to be the bitch who busts parties, who everyone hates because she's in charge and who the losers can come to and hold programs like crocheting on friday nights. Maybe i'll find a following. I'm rambling and south park is on in the background because Ethan is watching it and I am so, just... jumbled. Whatever. Whatever. Suck it up... it has to get better."

"event","there are many things i've noticed since i've been here. not to be judgy, but the majority of girls here have what i like to call ""bitch face"". that says nothing about their personalities, it just simply says that by looking at them, they seem like people i wouldn't be friends with. i don't know... i guess it's really judgy of me, but i'm sure they're judging me too, i can tell by the ""bitch face"" so they can get over it. i mean it's not like i'm calling them skanks or anything... nope... not at all.

anyways. i love it here, my classes are all interesting, i've had all of them so far except for my night class.

my roommates are fun.

ethan is amazing and i am so happy that we are close together and just enjoying each other's company so much. we drove home together this past weekend and i've never had more happy moments than on the way down singing in the car with him and goofing around. we're back. us. the us i always knew us as. it's so great. i'm so thrilled. beyond thrilled. i love him. i'm so in love with him. love will keep us together. 

yes i'm singing the song (LOOOOVEEE WILLL KEEEP US TOGETHERRR THINKKK OF MEEE BABBBEEE WHENEVERRR) in my head, by the way... you should pre-order your tickets for apartment 425 the musical... we sing and dance ridiculously, far too often for the shit that goes down in this living space to be a play, either way... it's more than watchable. haha. i love my roommates.

so, on a sad/distressing/scrambling note, i've run out of money because i've gone shopping every day. amazing how i can sit in pmle hating my life for hours weekly and STILL piss away all my money. granted i really didn't work too many weeks this summer between the pool not opening until mid-june, then with vacation and my cut hours towards the end, but i seriously thought that i would be better off than this. i suck at money management. i also suck because i know that i really should get a job this semester, the thing is though that even with 15 credits, i still stress... i always stress and although i have ""the time"" mentally i probably don't have the time to juggle class, homework, roommates, friends, fun, life... AND stress over a job. i don't know how the crap to get money... i don't know what to do, all i know is i need money fast. i feel horrible asking my mother and i feel even worse knowing that when i do ask her (there is no if, because literally i can't not get gas tomorrow) she will figure something out and i will be mooching off of her for another semester. this is just so sad. i feel pathetic and just, all around awful for having to ask my mom for money all the time. it just sucks because i value doing well in school so much. i could work and go to school, but i know that would really be too much, considering my fragile state last semester and all of the summer nonsense, i really cannot let myself get stressed. i become this horrible person when i am stressed.

maybe i can babysit or something, sign up for the nanny site and figure something out. there are lots of rich people in west chester, and i'm sure i could give up a night, put the kids to bed and study. i should investigate that ASAP. alright. i'm going to go do it."

i hate when you make an HONEST mistake and people can't stand to forgive you and still yell at you about it... and still call your cellphone at least 2 times a day hoping you'll pick up just so that they can tell you how absolutely wrong you are, when seriously you meant no harm AT ALL and it was an honest simple mistake that really shouldn't be all that big of a deal and if the person did the same to you, you wouldn't have been mad by it at all.

this ruined my morning. i was in an okay mood.
i think i'm sick, i feel like i'm going to throw up since like last nights puking debacle, my wisdom teeth aren't healing right and today has been a week since the surgery and ugh... i just want to feel better and have people leave me alone and get on with my life.

i put a ring in my nose just to see how it would look instead of the standard stud (which i like better) and yesterday when i was in the store grocery shopping some old woman was staring at me, due to my experience from working in senior homes since i was little with my mom i smiled at her, and she frowned at me... now that i think of it, it was the nose ring and the fact that i still have an IV bruise on my arm (no i do not do heroin discerning old woman). so i think this nose thing is going to come out as soon as it stops oozing, for first impressions sake.

i'm trying to be positive but this getting yelled at this morning and just the impression i made on a person who would normally just smile back really just bothered me so much. ugh.

no matter how much you try to be a good person, and try to be the person you dream of being i guess maybe it just never happens.

i think i can i think i can.


so just as i finished sending this, i just got some random IM from this person/thing that has been IMing me for awhile now, and i've just been x-ing it out.

"event","i've been reading a lot this summer, which i'm sure has not helped the constant confusion stuck in my head. none the less i've read some pretty great books since i've gotten back from vacation. jennifer weiner's good in bed, which i just finished ten minutes ago is by far my favorite. what a great book about loving yourself. it made me realize a lot. just like i wrote in the sand that day when i was free, just like the side walk in philly... i need to just simply do this, and all will be okay.

i mope a lot in here, reading back on this journal it's the constant ""this year has sucked"" mixed with the ""i need to make it better"" and back and forth and back and forth, and then the ""i need to loose weight"" mixed with the ""tomorrow is day one"". they way i've been living my life is fairly pathetic.

i don't watch tv anymore. i know that this year when i move, i will not trap myself in my room.
i know that west chester is beautiful, and for the sake of myself i really couldn't have made a better decision.
sure, i could be at temple... i could be at an ivy league, like i feel would be acceptable, but i'm not. why think that. west chester is just fine. it is more than just fine. it is a great small town, it is the perfect amount of everything for me to handle. it is not too much, which is why i'm there, and SARA IT IS NOT TOO LITTLE. 

i need to be nicer to my mom. i really need to. i don't know how else to put it. she bends over backwards for me, and for some reason, i've been so awfully irritable and i've been taking it out on her. that needs to end.

things just need to work themselves out. i'm hoping they will. this summer is near the end, my head is more jumbled than ever, but i think i have learned this summer to see more clearly what is important in life. maybe my head wants to stay jumbled to prevent me from making huge plans and thinking things out more than i should. maybe, like someone said to me last night, i'm still in shock from all thats happened and it's gotten to me so much that i can't process much more.

all i know is i'm excited for school, and i can still have dreams, but i have to live my life day to day and most importantly love myself."

"event","this is pretty blunt, but i think i'd like to go talk to someone. i feel like i need a new perspective on my life, because i think i keep circling around this general idea, but i'm missing the big idea. i think i'm about |           | that close to being purely and completely okay with things and happy, but there is one piece of the puzzle missing. 

i don't know what i would say to someone, but maybe they would have new ideas. i feel like i'm so good at convincing myself and other people that i'm right, and doing things right, that i keep tricking myself out of getting where i'm really supposed to be.

i've been reading past entries, trying to get insight, possibly trying to figure out where i went ""wrong"" even though i know that where i am right now is no where near wrong and is a good place, but still, i'm searching. maybe because i'm not exactly sure of the last time i was exactly sure. was i ever?

i found this,
""sometimes we just need to stop analyzing the past stop planning the future stop trying to figure out exactly how we feel stop deciding with our mind what we want our heart to feel and sometimes... we just have to go with WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPENS."" 

and also this...
""I used to be petrified of the dumbest things, like circuses, and assemblys and stuff... and I would get so nervous leading up to them to the point where I made myself sick thinking about it and would end up not going. I used to also get this way about eating in public places and stuff for some reason when I was little and I used to throw up all the time out of sheer nervousness. Since then, i've been really good with things like that. One time I got sick-nervous waiting to go to some party thing, but I got over that.""

i lost my train of thought upon reading that.
oh. yeah.

when grazing through my journal, it's cool. i relive every moment, i remember how i felt right then. even the feelings that i didn't put on the page. i'm good at leaving myself subliminal messages, like i word things so that i go back and know exactly what was happening, even if i didn't say it.

i'm really glad i've kept this journal for so long. i think it's between 3 - 5 years. i should keep reading back and find out, but it makes me tired. i can only take so much re-living of my life in one night. 

my head still feels jumbled. i think i might actually be tired tonight, but i don't know where to sleep. my bed just doesn't do it for me."

I CHALLENGE YOU to tell me what you honestly think about me. Leave me an anonymous comment, leave it with your name, leave it however you wish, just leave it. The truth.


In other news, TEN DAYS until I move into my new apartment. I'm really excited this year should bring a lot of new experiences and I cannot wait to be surrounded by great roommates in a town with so many possibilities and fun places to be, and in a new school. I get a fresh start. I have to realize that and take full advantage of it. I'm really excited to get out there and meet new people, while still hanging onto those who care and just really letting myself be the person I want to be. This is like freshman year all over again, except this time I won't be freaked out and I can take advantage of all opportunities. Technically it is freshman year all over again, since barely any of my credits transferred into actual useable credits, but i'm okay with that.

I'm kind of... on edge today. Since i've gotten home from work i've been in a bad mood. I really don't even know why. Rudy keeps eating everything and it was pissing me off and then my mom called while I was reading and it just annoyed me. I need a chill pill. I think it's work, like the place just gets to me. That job makes me question whether or not I can deal with working with people. Sometimes I think i'm better off just sitting in an office doing paperwork. 

I can't really tell if i'm... 
social or anti-social
good or bad with kids
real or fake
better or not
different or the same

I really don't even know why."

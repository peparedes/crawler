Sick and Tired of this world
There's no more air
Trippin' over myself
Goin' nowhere
Waiting
Suffocating
No direction
And I took a dive

And on the way down
I saw you
And you saved me
From myself
And I won't forget
The way you loved me
On the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held onto you

I've been wondering why
It's only me
Have you always been inside
Waiting to breathe
It's alright
Sunlight
On my face
I wake up and yeah, I'm alive

'cause on the way down
I saw you
And you saved me
From myself
And I won't forget
The way you loved me
On the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held onto you

I was so afraid
Of going under
But now
The weight of the world
Feels like nothing, no, nothing

Down, down, down
You're all I wanted
Down, down, down
You're all I needed
Down, down, down
You're all I wanted
You're all I needed

And I won't forget the way you loved me

All that I wanted
All that I needed

On the way down
I saw you
And you saved me
From myself
And I won't forget
The way you loved me
On the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held onto you

Down, down, down
But I held onto you
Down, down, down
But I held onto you"

"event","Change of plans.  We leave November 5th now.  And thats the final date.  I'm somewhat excited.  but I'm scared to death.  I gotta drive down there.  My dad is gettin me a new car jus for drivin down there.  Not like a new new car.  But one new and better then the one I got now.  So thats pretty cool I guess.  The one he wants to get me is a caddy.  And well ya'll know how I feel about caddy's...love em.  So I guess that is somethang cool.  Somethang that should make me happy.  Too bad it don't.  Yea its somethang to get excited about, but I'm not happy and have a feelin that I won't be happy for a long time.  I haven't been happy in a long time.  The last time I was happy, I mean truly happy, was when I was with her.  When I was with ehr nothin could bring me down.   Even if I had nothin I had her and thats all I wanted, all I needed.  But like everythang else in my life that is good, I lost her.  And I know theres nothin I can do at this point to get her back.  I have lost every chance I could have had.  And that pain is worse then any pain in the world.

Heres another poem I wrote.

The words you spoke to me still sound in my head
I still feel the sharp pain cut through my heart the way it did the night you left
I still hear the rain fall to the ground
The same sound I heard when my heart hit the cold, wet street when you kissed me goodbye
And I still wonder what the good in goodbye is
And I will wonder for the rest of my life
Tell my Love dies"

"event","The bitter taste of sorrow rests on my tounge
Tears form behind my bloodshot eyes as I sit alone in a smoke filled room
My imagination runs wild as figments of your shadows dance around in my head
And the tears pour from my eyes
Like the blood pours from a fresh stab wound to the heart
My self-distructive wayz come scurryin back to me when I think about the love I have for you
And it wasn't a waste of time, nor a waste of love
Just a set back
Another fear to add to the list
The fear of never finding a love that compares to you
And the pain is still herre
And will always remain"

"event","Went ta church this morning for the first time in a very very very very very long time. I actully enjoyed it. Enough to go again next sunday. And I'm actully willin to get up for it. I figure wit the way thangs are goin in my life right now, God is the only one that can help. So yes...I'm turnin to God to help me. Never thought it would happen that I would actully ask him for help, but theres no one else to turn to. I have Curt, but Curt is the one tellin me that I should ask God for help, so I am. 

The auction is in 2 weeks. So my room is gunna be empty of my bed and tables and stuff like that. Its gunna be sad actully. I wish I didn't hafta get rid of everythang, but I do need to start over. Not jus wit material thangs, but wit everything. I never got the chance to start over before, so I guess I should take this one cuz who knows if another chance will ever come along. The thought of leavin everything and everyone is scary yet somewhat comferting. I don't want my past to hold me down anymore. I wanna meet people that know nothin about me so I can show them the person I am now. The person that people here will never see cuz they choose not to, or jus simply don't want to. 

I have learned from my mistakes in the past. The huge mistakes I made in a realationship, and lost the best thing I ever had. The mistakes I made in school, by not goin and not gettin an education. The mistakes I have made wit my family by not lettin them in, not showin them I love them and jus fightin wit them all the time. 
It jus seems that I could never do anything right. And I'm startin to think like that again. But I have gotten forgivness from my family. I've decided I'm goin to college no matter what and I'm gunna work my ass off to do as best I can so one day I can feel good about myself and know that I did what I had to do and I actully suceeded. 
I'm not sure if I have been forgivin for the hurt I caused in my past realationship, and I don't know if I ever will, and I'm tryin to deal with it. I've realized I'm the one that needs closuer from it. She has had her closuer and I'm happy for her and wish the best for her. 

Most importantly I have forgivin myself for all the times I got down on myself, and all the pain I have put upon myself. I'm tryin to learn to love myself, but jus like everything else, it takes time. I'm livin my life day to day, yet lookin towards the future. I'm thinkin before I make decisions because for all I know it could take the smallest of decisions to make a wrong one and lose everythang again. I'm thinkin before I speak cause I know I lose my temper and say things that not only hurt me but hurt the people that I Love and care about the most. And I can't do it anymore. My temper has gotton alot better, and I'm happy with the way I handel things now. 

Hopefully I can be happy with myself someday."

"event","Sadly enough nothin in my life has changed....it still sad and lonly...but i guess u'll have that huh?...movin soon. Sooner then i'd like to think...but yet not soon enough. Its scary yet excitin. Excitin yet depressin. Depressin yet...well...pretty cool I guess. I'm gunna miss alot of thangs. Like drivin down the street and honkin at mirandas house every day. Or goin to the brite spot and sayin hi to every person in there cuz its a total ma and pop place and its jus cool like that. I'll definatly miss my house. and my neighbors...well some of them. I think I'm mostly scared of losin thangs, like memories. I can remember every thang about this house from when I was old enough to remember, I know every spot where i have got hurt, or got a hug from my mom, or played wit my dogs, or lauhed, or cryed, or just...did nothin at all but stood there and thought about how i was gunna live in this house forever. But thangs change, and u move out and move on, but u'll always have the memories right? I guess I should jus start thinkin posotivily, cuz if I don't I'll never get out of this god forsaken town. 

I know I'm gunna miss her. And possibly never talk to her again. And even tho I say alot of thangs, she is still part of me. Not a big part, but shes still there, and always will be. I guess it jus hard to let go of somethang that i have held on to for so long. I've held on to a fantasy that at a point in time i thought was goin to be my reality. But like i said before, thangs change, people change, her love changed. And I think in a way mine did too, but a part of it remains and will forever. Sometimes I think about her and miss her, or maybe I jus miss what we had. I'm not sure. But the lonliness is settin in, and has been for the past few months, and i think thats what makes me think about her. 

I've come to the realization that love isn't somethang u can jus let go of, or get over, or throw away. When it comes to ur first love theres always gunna be somethang there. Even if its the smallest of feelings, they will always remain there, and the shit won't go away. And the more u try to force it to go away the less it does. I'm still forcin it.

My car died tanight. Jus one more thang in my life that died, and isn't comin back."

And...o yes...I got to see Melissa Ferrick live.  Best day of my life.  And over the weekend I developed a tiny iny crush.  And no Pai not on that Serenity chick,  I know wha u were thinkin lol.  But yea I did get a small crush on someone.  But anywayz.  B4 this weekend Pai came and stayed wit me.  It was a good time.   She is way to funny for her own good.  And last weekend Jenae came and stayed saturday night and sunday night and I took her back to Chi on Monday morning.  She neede a smoke on saturday night so I payed my friend Liz 10 bucks and half a pack of smokes to take me to get her.  I didn't end up gettin to see Jenae this weekend but next weekend she might come back to ottawa for the weekend.  But this time i think shes gunna take the train, cuz i don't like drivin on highways (exspecially I-94 when theres lots of construction and semi's)  But yea.  right now I'm up in woodridge at Eva and Tami's apartment. I go home  tomorrow.  Kinda excited to be home in my own house wit my own food and my own peice of shit car.  But yea.  Ok jessie theres my update.  I'll update again when I get home.  Peace out"

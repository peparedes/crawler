"event","So I got the word out, I ran around the streets screaming ""Vote!"" ""Vote!"" I stayed out of the <i>Bushes</i> and <i>Kerry-ed</i> my ass to the voting booth. (Even though I'm not old enough) I got other people to register and low and behold we're gonna die. <b>WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!</b> I mean that in the non literal sense but still! When's the next time we're gonna get that many minorities together to actually fight for something. There are people who are literally saying, ""I'll never vote again, since Kerry lost."" The end of the world is upon us."

"event","So last night was not one of my highest points. I found myself sitting in my room at about 9:30 . . . 10:00pm last night, crying over a damn salad! A Quizno's salad at that!

<marquee scrollamount=""5""> This is a similar salad.<img src=http://www.gotomytown.com/rog/menus/Quiznos/menu_salads_pic.jpg>Now do you see why I cried?</marquee>

I don't know what got into me last night. Horomones . . . maybe the planets weren't aligned correctly in my hemisphere. SOMETHING! It makes absolutely no sense why I ended up in my room pouting over the absence of my salad. You see my day started off pretty decent, but there were some things I saw as ""definites"" (Things i just knew were gonna happen) that ended up not working out and as I explained to Natalie last night, I was putting a lot of dependence into that salad as the one thing that would work out, and my mother forgot to get it. I can not believe how minor of a situation this is, and I'm not the type to ball over something this pettie but I did, and it just led to further irritation, and then I didn't want anyone in the house to see me crying because I didn't want to have to deal with the critisizm. i felt stupid enough already!!!!!<B>I CRIED OVER A DAMN SALAD!!</B> 

I've come to the conclusion that
#1. Depakote isn't an effective mood stabilizer. Nor is Lamictal, or whatever the other one was that started with a ""T"" it was Trepa . . . it was something. Trileptal!!! There we go. None of those are effective!

#2. But more than that, there is something in my life that's bothering me, far from the Quizno's salad theory that I'm not allowing myself to come to grips with. Whatever it is, I just need to get it out before I end up at some public place crying over a out supply of something. Like french fries or chicken patties . . . ohmigod! Let's just pray that I'm not at school and end up with <i>tater tots</i> <u>instead</u> of french fries. GOD FORBID!

No, no let me stop the jokes. It makes the situation seem a little less trivial. Wait . . . no, no it doesn't. Ahhh well.

I'll be back for more later.

"event","Okay so today isn't great. It's not bad, but it's not great. It's just one of those days. Tu sabes? So anywho, I've just been doing a lot of thinking recently. Thinking about life, and about people who I know and who I deal with. Did I ever tell you my crossroads theory? Well if not here it is:

So we're all at this crossroads right, like a fourway street.
<C><img src=http://www.makotropolis.com/images/intersection.jpg></C> 
Everyones coming from either the north or the south to meet at the center and go to the west or to the east. I'm coming from the south.<img src=http://collections.ic.gc.ca/science/english/phys/projects/inline/compass.jpg> Are you still with me? Well to the west is the easy route and it won't get you anywhere, and it's filled with haters and hypocrites, people like that, then there's the east that's full of sadness and pain and struggles but ultimately it's the right path because at the end of it there's a lot of happiness. At the center of the crossroads there's a bunch of people who just stand there saying what thier gonna do, and what you <B>should</B> do. 

I look at it like this. <u>I</u> wanna walk to the EAST! ANd if you're not gonna walk to the East with me FUCK YOU! For those of you who see me coming from the south, and you know you're not gonna go to the east with me, for those of you standing around who never do anyhting but say that you will, if you're not gonna go to the east with me MOVE THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY!!!!! Don't bother me. Don't deal with me, don't talk to me!I don't need people who aren't 100% on my team in my life anymore. Fuck n-e-body who has the audacity to try and preach to me about <B>MY</B> life or <B>MY</B> opions and choices, I'm actually doing something.

<i>GOD!</i> Isn't that enough? I'm actually attempting to be someone and be about something. Why is it that everyone wants to see you fail? What enjoyment does it bring to the miserable person who finally has company. If you love it so much why are you still so unhappy?

I said all that to say this . . . I have given up my lend a helping hand attitude, and traded it for one that suits me as a person of ambition. I no longer have anytime for people who want me to sit around and complain with them. I'm all cried out, and I have a therapist <u>and</u> psychiatrist who I can whine and complain too. I don't need a shoulder to cry on anymore, more than I need someone who will tell me the reality of a situation. 

But here I am again getting paid 9.00 an hour to sit on my live journal. Let me get back to work . . . but tell me what you think of that analogy.

Oh and Natalie . . I'm saving you as a friend and you can write all the mean stuff you want to about me. Sometimes it doesn't hurt to know what type of a person I really am. . . . 

Until L8R . . . . . . ."

"event","So this weeknend was uneventful. Me and my friend Shay got all dressed up on Saturday, only to end up at old Country Buffet, and then home. I didn't stay at home though. I called Drea hoping she'd have something to do and she was about to go to this King party. Which I would've expected her to invite me to after she had mentioned it, but after the last time we kicked it, maybe she's serious about this whole getting space thing. It just sux that when she decides she wants space she goes to the <B>BEST</B> stuff! I know we sound like a couple but it's not like that. She and I didn't neccessarily get into an argument but she misunderstood something I said as a joke at a time when I misunderstood that she was joking and ultimately it ended in disaster. I didn't ""snap off"" like I usually would in an ""angry"" moment though. I just kinda sat there like ""what just happened"" besides that she was my ride home and I didn't wanna be stranded. We talked about it later though. It's fine. I guess, but n-e-way . . . so I end up hookin up with Veronica instead. Me, her, this dude named Mike, and this guy named Elias kicked it. We met them through our friend Qnivq. But I don't even know if I can call him a friend. He gives off these wierd vibes. I haven't talked to him since school let out, but when I met his friends he and I were about to  . . . do some things. . . [wink, wink]After that night though, which by the way didn't really go down like it was suppose to, he acted funny. We didn't even sleep together so what's all the weirdness about? idunno. I don't understand boys! If we keep hangin out with his friends though I don't doubt he and I will run into each other. But I know how I'll handle it. I'm not worried. So my cousin Mari had her wedding reception two weekends ago right, and why was all my family . . . well not all, hatin' on me and Vero? WTF?! Wassup with that?! Mari told me all about it when she got back to Boston. I was like ohmigod! I can't stand my dad's side of the family. They all full of it! I don't do anything to them. The only one's I like are My auntie Chrissy, my uncle Butchie, my uncle Charles, my cousin Nikki, and my grandma. Notice I didn't mention my father. I love him, but I don't like him. But I don't wanna get touchy. I'll have to write again later cuz' I'm at work . . . . 

Until then~"

"event","So nothin much new over here. Well  . . . that's a lie but that's generally how everyone starts out a journal entry . . . NOT that I'm a follower, but just someone who stays true to tradition. :) But on another note, so the school year left and is coming back so quickly. I can honestly say I feel as if I worked my summer away. I just quit my job at Pick N'Save. (Put in my two weeks notice) The only person who seemed to be ginuinely effected by it was Marty. Marty's soo nice to me now thta he and Danti are . . . . well I dunno what they are, but I like it. He's so good to her, and for her. Ha. I never woulda' guessed. Bu toff that subject. Theatre camp is in about two weeks. I don't know if my lack of excitement is a fitting shade for the season. I just wanna go to learn. I guess summer school has officially brain washed me. I'm going to the zoo today with my girl Veronica. It's too bad Danti's on punishment she shoulda came too. Her and V were cool. . . I think. But n-e-who, so I'm thinkin' I might throw a back to school party. . . . or rather formal dinner party at P F Changs. Do somethin' a lot of people don't necessarily think ot do. It would be a classy introduction into adult life. That and I just want an excuse to get dressed up and eat at a fancy restaurant. But truthfully i am looking forward to going back to school. It's my senior year! I'm a senior. I love my life . . . for right now that is. Today has been an exceptionally good one, and I'm praying to God it will remain that way. I need to get far away from sadening, depressing, things in my life. Such as seeing Cerfgba @ Pick N' Save and haters, people who bring me down, fake friends, lies, self destruction . . . tu sabes? I want more for myself. Hell, I need it . . I deserve more.

I fall from God's grace everyday and it's not something I can help I'm a sinner. . . as it states in the bible I'm the chief sinner, I just don't wanna fall out of his mercy. Maybe no one gets it but me, but . . . I don't wanna die tomorrow unhappy, and not in a good light with God. I'm definitely NOT a saint. But I'm not trying to be the devil on someone's shoulder either. Until tomorrow . . . . ."

"event","So I just got off of work. Yesterday night I hooked up with my friend Qern. She and I have a cool connection in a sense but at the same time she and I have problems. I mean the friendship, I would hope, would far outweigh those problems but I mean sometimes I just get so pissed off with her. She makes some horrible calls at times that are just so overly generalized and I know I may not be making any sense but it's not worth thoroughly explaining. She's about to go to college, and I mean I think the distance will make us cooler. Honestly. So I saw Ireb. She came and picked me up.She's pretty pissed with Danti right now because she feels like she's dodging her. danti borrowed some of her stuff and has yet to return it, and she's gettin' really pissed off. It sucks too, cuz' they just got cool. But on another note, (still concerning Danti) this guy I work with named Nick, I wanted hook her up with, but she ended up meeting my friend Marty FIRST which is crazy (Marty works with me too.) But I spent all this time hyping her up to Nick and she kinda hooks u with one of his close guy friends. It's sheer coincidence but it shows how small of a world we live in. But when I first heard about Marty and Danti it was from Nick. 
i ran into Nick at Summerfest and I was like HEY DANTI s'pose to be here. We can find her and you can meet her. But he goes no, no she almost like slept with Marty! And I'm like WHAT?! Nooooooo. Not MY DANTI!!! You got the wrong girl!!! But it turns out he misinterpreted literal sleeping in the same bed with SEX! So I tell Danti, who snaps on Marty thinking he lied to his friend to look cool, because, why woud I make some BS up? So Marty calls Nick and snaps on him and so today me and Nick ran into each other at work, and he's like, ""You got me in trouble."" he swore he didn't say that they almost had sex, but how could I mix up ""Yeah they almost slept together, and they were making out and stuff. . . "" with something as simple as sleeping in the bed together. Nick lied. He misunderstood and tried to cover his a**. I still think he's cool pplz. But I'd watch what I say to him! N-E way tomorrow's pay day. FINALLY. A check from not ONE but TWO JOBS! I can't wait!:)

"event","So today has actually been running smoothly. I still have a lot to do and chances are in an hour I'll be right back on here complaining again but my hand has had minimal pain. I went to work yesterday tired off of my A**! I could've fallen asleep at the register. Nobody was there except for my friend Ernesto and my girl Shay. Nothing too exciting. Cerfgba wasn't there. Which is probably best. I looked horrible anyway. I must be psychotic! I always go to the break room and see when he's working next. We never even speak to each other, yet I always have to go above and beyond the Pick N'Save standard of looking nice when he's there. I shouldn't like him, hell I thought I didn't. I talked to my friend Ireb yesterday. she just got evicted! Damn! That's real messed up. It wasn't even her fault. Now she's up in Fredonia on her dad's farm and we haven't kicked it at all recently. I know she's gotta be bored!!!!! I've been so wiped out recently after school and work I can't think of anyhting better to d9o than go to sleep. I'm so tired half the time I can barely see straight. And that's not an over statement. But there's not much to talk about right now. I'll write more later."

"event","So life hasn't much changed for myself. Which right now seems kinda sad. I'm thinking it's just because of the particular type of day I'm having. It's definitely been an awkward one. So I take my A.D.D. medicine as usual, and everything's fine until my hand pains start kickin' in. (FYI: My right hand has just recently started having really bad pains, and cramps.I work with paper all day, and it's not helping that I have to write with my right hand all day either.) So I decide to take an aleve once I got to work. Unfortunately Aleve has this drowsy effect which conflicts with the focusing drug in my A.D.D. meds and ultimately causes weird, half alert, half sick, half tired feelings in me (By the way, I know that was too many halves) ANd inevidably I end up feeling generally sick all day. Until about now. I just got off of my lunch break, but I still have to go up to my other job at pick N'Save in an hour! Which I hate because then I'm gonna see STUPID FACE CERFGBA! Who, by the way, I <U>still</U> have a crush on! For those of you who don't know Cerfgba is this guy i use to like and then we messed around like 3 times and now we hate each other for numerous reasons!!!! But aside from all that I have to go to work until ten plus I have summer school tomorrow which I'm gonna hate too.

"event","So yesterday was the Brown Vs. The Board of education 50th Anniversary, and Urban Underground hosted a rally for it which actually turned out to be really good. For it to be hundreds of inner city youth there it was extremely well done and there were no fights or ""drama."" I was so happy that it turned out the way it did. Tommorrow me and my friend Drea are going up tio Urban Underground for a member meeting. i went to my first one last week Wednesday.
   This time we're basiclly recapping the event, I'm only a network member. A network member is basiclly someone who: <text area>ISN'T A TEAM MEMBER BUT HELPS WHEN THEY CAN AND IS INFORMED OF THE URBAN UNDERGROUND EVENTS.<text area> 
    I try to help where I can. If it wasn't for Drea, thoiugh I wouldn't be involved 1/2 as much as I am. She sees that i've taken an interest in it and she is really showing some devotion in supporting me about it. Ofcourse I can't forsee myself being abel to be a ""serious"" member but I can do what I can when I can, so that's the real point. 
   On a less professional tip, PROM is comin' up right around the corner. I'm going with my friend Ernesto. He and I are real cool and I don't have any real attraction to him so it makes the after events of the night flow a lot smoother. On the contrary, (LOL) I hvae been trying to hook him up with just about every friend I have that I think he might find an interest in and vice versa. He has a girlfriend, but she ain't s***. Atleast not to me. (Rolling eyes) She seems like she doesn't really know what she has, and I automaticlly have a biased against her because E is my bestfriend! (Atleast my best guy friend) Pero, cambiando de tema

     So why was my ""niece's"" b-day this past weekend, and as usual I was the TOKEN BLACKY. I always make a joke about it. They said I shoulda wore a shirt that said I'm just here for racial diversity. (LOL) I guess they had a point huh. . . ."

"event","-Some names have been coded for protective purposes-

So, my first entries in all my journals usually start out this way. For some reason I feel like I'm writing a thesis paper sometimes. I feel like there needs to be an introduction, a body, and conclusion, but let me try not to do that this time. So I guess drama never ceases at this school. (Milwaukee Highschool of the Arts) I couple friends of mine had a misunderstanding about who didn't like who, and it just escalated into some bull****. Ofcourse slowly but surely it's bein handled but I guess my biggest problem is the fact that, childish situations like theses should no longer be occuring. I'm more afraid than anything right now of the coming year! I'm so close to being an adult. (Legally that is) And when I think about that and look at the level of maturity in some of my ""classmates"" I get so scared that the world is going to close in on me, and no one will be ready for it. I can't see myself having adult responsibilities. I can BARELY pay my cell-phone bill let alone utilities and rent, and COLLEGE! When you stop and think about those types of things, you find, that these trivial teen angsty MELLOW DRAMAS(!) are pointless, and a waste of well needed energy. Ever since I started taking this medication (Aderol . . if that's how you spell it) for my A.D.D., I've been so clear headed and leveled concerning life. I feel so focused. Despite the side effects of feeling kinda like I'm floating and fizzling (a nice fizzle) on the inside. Senior year is approaching so quickly, and I hope I'm ready. It's not quite the time for reflection yet, because I know when I do reflect it'll bring back memories of this year that I would rather dismiss, but I know I'm changing, and I know I'm growing as a person, and I finally have a form of contentment within me about myself. I have learned a lot this year. Hopefully next year I will have little left to learn. Maybe for once I'll be abel to keep on the straight and narrow. I know my life is going to be full of surprises. I'm slightly prophetic. (ha.ha.) But I owe a lot of it to God. I make too many mistakes not too.

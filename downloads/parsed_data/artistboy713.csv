Then we went to the garden where we had to try to draw these clay body parts realistically to make them look like part of a renaissance painting. i drew a picture of a hand. hands are challenging because of all the lines. we also did cross hatching on them to show light and dark. mine came pretty well. joe's was amazing. franklin and dave were playing the movie game like the whole time. i got my report card yesterday and izz hott! yess!

im unsure what to do about track. cross country was really fun. i thought winter would be a lil to difficult for me cause you have to run and sweat in the cold and thats the time when school can get most stressful. im not sure if i wanna do outdoor though and cross country starts in summer when i am back and fourth to the beach so it seems kinda odd to just do it for only 3 months of the year. ill see."

so today was kinda what i would expect, and also kinda not. in english the class played a lame april fools day joke on the teacher and he fell for it. then i had a math test which had a super hard question on it. at lunch my math teacher told john and me that it was an april fools joke. lol thats good cause i could not figure that out at all. we watched more of the passion of Christ in religion. pretty interesting and very violent. uy... and i have a HUGE global test tomorrow.

mom is going down to da beach hizzy tomorrow to make sure everything is ready for Easter! can't wait!

earlier i had a BIG chem test that i had been studying for for a few days and like all day yesterday (hence the lack of updates) but it wasnt too hard. i think i did pretty well. i also took a math test today that i am positive that i passed with flying colors. gym was kinda dumb cause all we did was just sit in the locker room and talk for 45 minutes but all in all i had a pretty peaceful day

my grandma came over for dinner. we had a lot of MACARONI! :)

it looks like chris and i will (finally) get to chill at the movies on friday. chris might invite some of his other frosh friends.

"event","Just wanted say HAPPY EASTER.  Hope you get lots of candy and sweets and bunnies and whatever else you normally get for Easter.  I wonder how the bunny got affiliated with Easter.  I mean seriously, Easter is celebrating Christ being risen from the dead and the symbol of it is a bunny??  I mean, what's up with that.  And this bunny brings you candy no less and hides eggs.  Um yea bunny's don't lay eggs so its not like they can just poop them out all over the place so why would they hid eggs.  Shouldn't they hide like carrots or something!?!  And another thing, how are these bunny's getting into my house.  I have all the doors and windows locked and closed yet they get in anyway!!!  I think the government should use the bunnys as spys to infiltrate enemy bases because a.) who would suspect an innocent looking egg pooping bunny and b.) they could probably get into the pentagon if they really wanted too.  I bet they get Easter baskets there to from the freekin Easter bunny. I mean serisously, if I was the bunny I'd just eat all the candy and be one really fat bunny.  Well if you have any idea why Easter is represented with a bunny let me know.

Now I'm going off to eat a big breakfast my dad makes for us on every big holiday.  It's a tradition of being like oh yay, Christ has risen, or Christ was born, lets eat until we freekin explode because people in 3rd world countries can't but we leave in America and want to increase the obisety rate by making big meals and not doing anything else for the rest of the day.  Not only the big meals but the candy that, that damn bunny leaves!!  The freekin bunny must be trying to kill of all humans so they can take over the world so they give us candy so we will all die!  KILL THE BUNNYS!! IF YOU SEE A BUNNY KILL IT BEFORE IT KILLS YOU!!!!"

"event","Well this day of no school is nice but I really haven't done much.  I'll recap whats happened in the last 24 hours or so.

Thursday Night:
I desperatly wanted to go out and have fun and hang with friends or do something.  So I talked to people and what happens, I end up staying home all night because I couldn't find anything to do.  So I played video games watched TV and fell asleep all the while having a car and a night lisence, but yea whose complaining right.

Friday Morning:
Woke up at 5am on the couch in my family room, which was ok because thats the same spot i fell asleep.  You know how your arm goes numb when u sleep on it, well the arm of the couch isnt very coushined so it felt like my head went numb cause the arm of the couch cut off the circulation, boy was that fun.  So then I go upstairs to my bed and actually go to sleep.  I get awoken at 10am by my mom, who says in a clever way, basically that she knows i was downstairs till 5am and that I wont be spending all day sleep.  I get up, go downstairs, eat lucky charms and watch scooby doo and then decided to go take a shower.  I get dressed, start cleaning up my room and doing laundry.

Friday Afternoon:
I play video games, do laundry, dishes and clean my room.  I'm desperatly looking for something to do, somewhere to go.  So i get this great idea.........

My Great Idea:
My great idea is to go out and by easter baskets for my mom and dad.  I mean, great way to suck up right, brownie points all the way.  Course I'm broke so I go to my sister (yea, get this, a 13 old girl has more money than me, thats where you draw the line between sad and pathetic).  I get her in on it so she can pay for it and she agrees.  So we go do that and thats the end of my great idea.

Friday Afternoon Continued:
On the way home we stop and rent the incredibles, i've heard its good i guess ill find out tonight cause once again i think ill be stuck at home doing nothing.  Yo necisito amigos!!!  Any way(s) ---> the addition of the ""s"" pisses my mom off --- If you have nothing to do tonight and your reading this and you'd like to do something IM me or something and I'll love you forever.

So yea that's been my amazing day off so far.  Hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have."

"event","So yea it's been a while since ive updated my journal and I don't exactly have free time now but I'm putting off doing a physics lab so this is what I'm gonna do instead.

Last Friday I went to the musical Man of La Mancha @ BH BL Highschool (my highschool) and it was really good.  Great job to everyone in the cast, crew and pit.

Saturday morning I had to get up early for this We the People: Citizens of the Constitution competition.  We competed against 9 other schools, all from NYC, Long Isalnd deal so yea.  The class was split into 6 different ""units"" which researched different topics and wrote speachs and became experts if you will on a givin area of the constitution.  My unit 6 did friggin awesome... so awesome that our teacher is keeping are speech cause we freekin rock but we didnt win which totally sucks cause we shoulda.  Instead our unit 5 won, which they did good but not great so whatever, it was rigged, i filed a law suit, well not really but u know how it is.

After the competition my mom and I went to shawn walsh's funeral.  It was packed, we couldnt even get a seat in the main chapal.

After that i was suppose to go to the show again with heather and her friend but they ended up not being able to go so I just hung out with Laura and Charissa since Laura is visiting now that shes back from college for a bit.  We watched catch me if you can and then I left as Charissa and Laura were trying to sufficate eachother with pillows.

Sunday was babysitting Tracie (my 8 year old sister) day.  Karin(my 13 year old sister (i just have the two sisters thats it))had an all day vball tournament so it was me and tracie having a house party.  Yea then it was over the end  

Oh something i forgot to mention...last friday at lunch Dan and I are eating at our normal table and I go to dan, ""dan, do you think i should pull down my pants""...he was like, ""sure go for it"".  So I did.  So I'm sitting there in my boxers in the middle of the cafeteria just eating my lunch pertending nothing is going on while everyone around me relizes that i dont have pants on and stares at me.  Mr. Wellington comes over and dan says to me ""dude ur dead"".  BUt to his suprise Mr. Wellington thinks its pretty damn funny.  He said, ""Eric if we had a fire drill what would u do""...i was like "" well that would be a problem wouldnt it""...he was like ""yea i hope you have a button on those things""...i was like ""yes sir i do"".  THen he walks away laughing to himself.  Course then Mr. Juliano comes over so I quickly pull up my pants and he says to me, ""your sense of humor is lost on all of us, if this behavior continues ull be finding someplace else to eat, alone""  Needless to say it was mad funny.

All in all a pretty good weekend"

"event","The follies last night were really great as always.  I was there with Heather from schnectedy whom I met at excel.  That's right...whom.  Anyway yea so we chilled and watch the follies...well actually I filmed the follies cause my family is responsible for making the dvd.  So yea if anyone wants one let me know but anyway yea, the follies were fun and if you haven't see them go tonight!  Of course go to the Italian supper which is from 4-7 at the white church right across the highschool and itll be like dinner and show, how cool right.

After the follies Heather and I went to price chopper to get some food cause we were both really hungary.  We got water, lunchables and ice cream...only the finer things in life will do.  So we chilled and ate and talked.  So then I took her home alllll the way back to schnectedy and trust me...its a ways to go.  But we finally got there, said goodnight and then i left to go back home.  It was fairly uneventful except for my stop at dunkin donuts for a strawberry coolata cause i was quite tired and didnt really think falling asleep at the wheel (i've heard some bad stuff about people that do that).  Yea so then I got home at 12:30 ish and crashed only to be awaken by my mom at 8am wanting me to take karin to the barn so she could ride.  Yea so I've been there from like 8:30 till now (11:14).  But now I'm finally home however have to leave again at 2:45 to go to the Italian supper at my church since I'm the host ;)

SO eveyone should definitly come to the Italian supper!!!! 4-7 @ the white church across the street from the highschool.  And if your not sure if you wanna go, if you do you'll get to see me in a tux ;)

Well I'm gonna go nap shower and change.  Till next time this is me signing off and saying what a fun night."

"event","This journal entry is because of popular demand aka lauren asking me to write it.  Well today had some intresting things in it.  First of all its report card day, every kids favorite time of the year.  I still havent got over how funny it is that they sell carnations on report card day.  If you get a bad grade buy them a flower and see if that helps haha yea right.  My report card didnt turn out too bad, little low in the Spanish but Ms. Stern's a duche bag so yea thats not suprising.

During second block I had a meeting with Mr. Reynolds to make my schedule for next year and here's what it looks like:
Public Speaking
Lit and Pol
Econ
PIG
AP bio
Calc AB
Statistics
Concert Band
Career Intern - that should be cool
Late Arrival - yea baby
and gym

Pretty nice schedule if you ask me, especially since Spanish V is no where to be found :).  God I swear if I had to take spainsh five i would end up stabbing mr. stern in the throat with a knife.  But yea enough thinking about that lets move on to happier thoughts like...toliets!  Yea i really have to go the bathroom now so a toliet seems like a really happy thing.  I mean, is there any other thing that will put up with all your shit no matter how bad.  Who's always there for you when ur sick, or to make u feel better.  That's right, your toliet, or for you ladies your husband/boyfriend.  Haha thats funny, so you can think of a boyfriend as a toliet.  Just make sure he doesnt get clogged up by treating it right and he'll take all ur shit.  DAmn that's good.  I should write a book.  I'm gonna go do that, peace."

"event","OMG...today was so crazy.  I seriously was ADDing throughout every single class, which with today's schedule wasnt to bad.

First block gym, floor hockey.  Some where during class PJ hits a ball hard into my leg, the little prick.  I'm not seriously pissed off at him, he didnt mean it and it happens and it didnt hurt all that much.  But I got him back anyway.  After our team lost, when the gym teacher wasn't looking, I ran up behind PJ and smacked the back of his legs with my hockey sticks.  He limped a little but in the end he was alright.

Second block APUS...We watched a movie, I slept...yea thats about it

Third block Reader's workshop.  We had a journal entry for the book due today...yea didnt know about that but hey thats ok we had all class to read or work on that so whatever.  We went to the auditorium to read which was pretty sweet, little chilly there as always but sweet.  I didnt actually read that much, might have to do something with the fact of who I was sitting next to, haha.

Fourth block spanish, a Sternitopia day.  For those of you who dont know because you dont have to share in the joy of spanish class, a Sternitopia day is a day where everyone in the class must speak entirely in spanish for the whole class.  Appariently Sternitopia is Ms. Stern's own little country which is her classroom.  I think I'm going to inform the US government of this so they can come in and take it over.  I'll tell George W. Bush that there are hidden nuclear weapons, that worked last time.

Then I had to stay after school for this we the people competition that I will be going to along with my APUS class and today my group stayed after and practiced.  So yea during the 6 minutes of Q and A, I was totally zoning so that went real well.

Any way I finally got home, gave Caitlin a ride cause her house is on my way home so that was cool.  I like having other people in my car, it's a lot more fun.

But yea so that leaves me here where I am now, just chillin at home.  Later tonight I've got a jazz band concert at Glen Sanders Mansion, should be fun.  I'll let y'all know how that goes.

GIT R' DONE!"

"event","Haven't written anything in here in a while so i figured that I'd go ahead and do that now, now that I finally have a little bit of free time.

Well school was school today which isnt a good thing but it isnt a bad thing either.

Life goes on...this last weekend I had a bday/superbowl party at my house, thanks to everyone who came it was a lot of fun.  I had 4 favorite superbowl commercials:
1.) the one with the guy walking down the street holding the diet pepsi and all the women stop and turn to look at him and take off there sunglasses in that omg sort of way that girls do that.  Then you see the guy from queer eye for the straight guy take off his sunglasses and turn around open mouthed staring at the guy.  It was really funny, me and my dad were cracking up.
2.) the other diet pepsi commercial where p. diddy gets a ride in the pepsi truck
3.) The one where the kids hit the ball over the fence and complain how old man whatever never gives the ball back, then that little girl is like here try these lays chips, everyone likes lays.  So they throw that over and back over comes the ball...then a dog...then their car...then MC Hammer.  After MC Hammer starts dancing the kids throw him back over the fence
4.) The other one with MC Hammer, where he's dancing outside his house with a bunch of girls then the screen flashes 15 minutes later and he has a foreclosure sign on his house and all his stuff is being taken away.

what were ur favorite superbowl commercials?

In other news I just had a meeting today for my eagle project so I can get my eagle scout rank.  Yes I'm a boy scout and I'm just doing it so I can get eagle and put it on my college apps and job resumes ok.  But anyway the meeting went well, I just have to get the details, plan it, get it approved then do it.  It's at the history center on glenridge road.  I'll be ""renovating"" the basement to make it usable for storage.  Well that'll be fun.

I'm off to a haircut the jazz band thingy at glen sanders so peace out."

"event","Went home from school early yesterday cause I was so dizzy!  I went to the doctors and she said that I have some viral infection that's causing me to have fluid in my ears which is throwing off my equilbrium.  So yea that was fun.  Went home for a couple hours then to a dentist appointment then to a dermitologist appointment...3 doctors in one day man I'm good.  Well that was that day

So today, I'm still feeling kinda sick, got drugged up on nightquil last night so I felt kinda better this morning but not 100%...so what do I have to do first block, thats right swim!!! just what i want to be doing when i cant breathe.

2nd block APUS wrote a DBQ almost all block...fun times indeed

3rd block study hall, studied for a big spanish test i had 4th block

4th block spanish test in which i felt prepared and i was actually feeling good about it so that made me happy.  Then we watched a movie about Spain and did you know that in spain they have an INDOOR SKIING PLACE!!!!  how cool is that!!

Now I'm home doing some homework and chillin...maybe I'll go to the girls basketball game...or maybe I'll stay home and chill who knows.

"event","Back from NH...got in yesterday afternoon...unpacked and then watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban cause my mom just bought it (she's a big HP fan).  I thought the movie was good in some parts but all together too choppy from scene to scene, of course thats because the movie would be way to long otherwise but still.  That and the new dumbledor.  Coming in he had a hard task of filling a great actors shoes who played Dumbeldor wonderfully and I was a little dissappointed in that.  The other Dumbledor was so soft spoken this one wasn't...i dunno different person, different character and i didnt like it that much is basically what it boils down to.

Then I got up at 7 to watch the return of the King which i really enjoyed...that was a great, but really long, movie...

Today I worked on my AP US project for a couple hours...its coming along nicely :)

On a good note, Cathleen made it into Phantom Regiment drum and bugle corp...congratulations sweetheart!!

"event","I'm here in New Hampshire, just got here today.  4 and a 1/2 hours in a car so I'm a little bit tired...

We unpacked the car, brought everything inside and had a little bit of lunch.  We're having our actually thanksgiving feast later tonight.  So after lunch I went for a little walk around the neighborhood cause it is suprisingly a very very nice day out especially considering its november 25th

Last night was a lot of fun.  Went out to TGI Firday's with like 30 people for Samantha's birthday dinner.  Here's something fun to try, get 30 people seated at TGI's...yea they weren't to happy and we ended up having to split up into 2 groups but o well it worked.  Once again happy birthday sam!

I just got off the phone w/ cathleen a little while ago and she was upset that she wasn't in my live journal so here you go now your in it.  Sorry for not putting you in sooner but....................
It's really hard sometimes liking someone so much and having them be so far away that I have to do something that doesn't remind me of her because otherwise I just miss her way too much.  So if you read this Cathleen, even if your not always in everything I do, you are always in my heart.

"event","Hey the meeting ended 15 minutes early so im back home again.  Yea the meeting was a complete waste of time and I did absolutly nothing.  Now all I have left to do is decided wether or not I feel like doing my math homework...

eh I'll probably end up doing it, if i don't I'll just have to do it tomorrow during school and since im not doing anything now might as well get it out of the way right?

you know, maybe i should just type one journal entry a day instead of like 3 or 4...

GIVE ME YOUR OPINION...SHOULD I TYPE JUST ONE JOURNAL ENTRY A DAY, OR 3 OR 4, OR JUST SHUT THE HELL UP AND NOT WORRY ABOUT IT SO MUCH...REPLY AND LET ME KNOW!!!"

"event","Yea so having to swim first block is really not fun cause then you go throught the rest of the day smelling like chlorine which is really wonderful.  But i guess it wasnt too bad considering we played water polo almost the entire time and i, having the wonderful aim that i do missed the goal and knocked down those medical strecher board things.  Then i did it again and knocked down the other, all in all quite an accomplisment.

2nd block AP US, got a 100 on my we the people essay so that was good, um yea watched a great slide show on jackson.  We were suppose to read an article to but i started ADDing and only got to page 2, eh whatever.  

Study hall is study hall.

Hung out w/ my girls in the school store during lunch like a normal do, I <3 you girls.

Fourth block spanish which we had a sub which i cheered about but then found out that our regular teacher was out because her dad died so then i felt bad.  We watched beauty in the beast in spanish, it was great.  Yea people were jealous how much i knew about the movie, course in college im gonna be a disney movie philosphy major so yea... anyway that was cool,

Now I'm home and going down stairs to work out...

couple of qoutes from the day:
""no that's not an assault rifle""
(yea that's all i can think of for now)"

"event","Hey.  This is my first entry into this livejournal thing which is pretty cool.  This weekend is going fairly good considering that all day yesterday I cleaned up my house and today I'm doing all the homework I have to do.  Just recaping about the volleyball season, we went 18-0 in suburbian council, won sectionals and got 3rd in regionals.  Which is pretty freekin awesome if you ask me considering this is the first time that we've ever won sectionals.

Well anyway, so far today I've finished a physics lab which is always good, relized that the only homework thats actually due tomorrow I left at school which is a little disheartening but hey i'll live.  That's why I get there early and thats why they created homeroom, cause kids don't do they're homework.

I went to the fall drama ""father of the bride"" last night which was pretty darn good.  Luke was freekin hilarious i must admit.  Mad props to shane, kyle, maggie, and justin too.  Oh and if you didn't go to the play but you want the extra credit for english class from having a signed program, bring $2 to school tomorrow and find me, I have extra signed programs but only while supplies last.

Well I think thats pretty good for a first entry.  Peace out!"

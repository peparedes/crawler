 Losing in the battle of life 

So a couple of many changes have already occured. Kyle and I have decided to go out seperate ways. It's definetly not easy but life is just taking us different directions. If God brings us together again, we will go from there. I'll always love him for him and I wish him nothing but the best in his future. He'll always be the guy I never thought I could have. Anyways Graduation has also come and went. You could only imagine all the emotions that have occured in the past couple of days. Things aren't easy right now but I'm going day by day. I thank all my friends that have been supporting me through these life changing things. As for Kyle, if you ever read this...(which I'm sure you wont but..) I love you so much and thank you for all you've done for me. You have given me nothing but the best, nothing short of what some say I deserve. I know I was lucky to have found and  lucky to have such an important guy in my life. Thanks for giving me the courage I never thought I had, thanks for letting me see love in a different light, thanks for loving me for me, just thanks for everything. I'm going to truely truely miss you but I know this is what you want. Know that I am always here for you....forever and for always. And know that I will always love you whether you see it or not, whether you feel it or not.

 Hawaii 


I wrote this while I was at the airport on my way home from Hawaii, took me awhile till i uploaded it but oh well.

So Im currenntly at the airport waiting for my flight to honololu (spelling?) and fromthere i will be waiting two hours and then ill be heading home. woot woot. i've been in hawaii, kaui to be exact, for the last week. ive had such a blast. i came with elissa and her mom and dad. they were so kind to take me in and allow me to join them on their family vacation. the first day i came, i waited at the airport for about 3 hours until there flight got there cuz they were flying from the big island. once they got there we got the rental car and headed to the hotel. man it was more like an apartment then a hotel. it had everything...washer and dryer, dishwasher, kitchen utensils, refridgerator etc. it was amazing. and then you go through the back sliding door and it leads you to the beach. absolutely amazing. The first night we just kinda chillded out and went to dinner. The second day was kind of a chill back day as well. we went into town and did some grocery shopping and elissa and i looked at the shops. on sunday we went shopping and checked out spouting horn. we also went to the pizza place they love for dinner.on monday we woke up early and went tubing. it was crazy. the caves and stuff were dug way back when for irrigation purposes. we had little helmets with flashlights on it and gloves. it was a true experience. we rode on cool nifty cars that brough us to the top of the hill and then from there we hopped in our tubes and rode down. we went through a total of 5 caves, the last one with lights out. after we got to the bottom the people had a nice lunch ready for us and we had the chance to swim in the water. after that we stopped at the beach for awhile and went back to the hotel. thats when elissa and i started our speed tournament. quit fun i tell ya. On tuesday we woke up early and went on a helicopter ride. We got to see the whole island from up in the air. absolutely amazing, better then words can say. i took lots of pictures but eventually got sick and stopped taking them. we got to see all the canyons etc and theres were hundreds of water falls which were gorgeous. after that we went to lunch at dukes which was right on the beach. then we went shopping for a little and then layed on the beach for a couple hours. after that we went to dinner at some mexican food place. then on wednesday i got up and went down to the beach by the hotel. man it's lovely. later on all of us went and got ready to go horseback riding. layered up the sun screen!!! heck of fun!! it was my first time...my horse was named pee wee herman lol. they gave me him since i was a new rider and all but i swear he was the worst one lol. he had the worst additude and he was a fiesty horse lol. but anyways the trail brought us all along the beach, unfortunately not on it, but we still got to see the beautiful blue water and all that. that lasted about two hours. elissas mom didn't go but her dad, elissa and i went. luckely elissas dad was behind me the whole time cuz i didn't know what the heck i was doing lol. my horse kept tripping, i swear i though iwas gonna falll and die lol. afterwards we were pretty tired and headed back to the hotel. thursday was my last day in kaui, sadness. in the morning i went and layed on the beach for awhile and just soaked up everything that had happened this vacation. elissa and i went to dinner at beach broiler and that was our day. we spent like 3 hours playing speed and then packed for our flight home lol. this morning i went and checked out the beach one last time and then elissas mom brought me to the airport. this whole experience was an experience of a life time. i'm so thankful that i got to be apart of it. thanks to elissa and her parents. absolutely amazing. i'm not ready to leave, because as soon as i get home, i';m going to be bombarded with stuff to do. so much has happened apprently dsince i've been gone. courtney sent me nasty messages earlier on in the week saying how she wanted nothing to do with me anymore and how i should stay in hawaii and never come back. then she sent me messages saying that because of me she is living on the streets and all this other bullshit. i really have nothing to say to that. she says that because i told the parents how SHE sent me those nasty messages, she is now living on the streets for sure. i don't understand how my actions affect her consequences. craziness but it definetly did not make me a happy camper but what are ya going to do. hopefully people come to their senses and realize that it is not my fault. my mom called me and was giving me the guilt trip and crap. which makes no sense. if she is so upset that courtney has no where to stay, then how come she doesn't welcome her into her house; yet she will allow her boyfriend to stay with her free of charge. makes absolutely no sense huh? yeah you're telling me. goes to show you where her priorities are. so courtney should really be mad and upset with her not me. my parents, my dad and step mom, have done absolutely everything they can to help her out and she has been nothing but apreciative. my grandpa let her stay at his house while she was busy doing school and she showed yet again, no appreciation. instead she yelled at him and never helped him out. which makes no sense, he already did his parent duties, why should he have to do it again. anyways i'm jsut venting. right now i'm currently not at the honolulu airport waiting for my flight. it doesn't leave until another hour and a half. i can't wait to just get home now. i hate this whole lay over crap. it took like 15, 20 minutes just to walk to my gate from where i got off the plane lol. a freaken huge airport i'm telling you. anyways, what else is going on in my life. oh, instead of living on campus at college, i will be staying in an apartment with wallen and her sister. i'm pretty excited, it saves me a lot of money. plus i'll have someone i know close by...real close lol. i start college sept 7th. craziness it's coming up pretty fast. i'm a little excited about moving out but nervous about starting the college thing. i just really want to get in and out. the next month is going to go by really fast because i've got something to do every weekend. between disneyland, soccer and camping and more soccer lol i'm set. also, i'm almost done with my work, probably about another week and i'm done with mcdonalds forever!! lol good stuff. it's kinda weird leaving but i'm defintly excited to get out of their and the fast food institute. the public tends to be really rude and it doesn't make for a pleasant day i must say. but i will definetly miss some of my co-workers. but yeah that's life for me. my dad is currently working in santa cruz for the next year so i only see him on the weekends. since i've been gone i haven't seen him in two weeks so you could say i'm definetly excited to get home and see him. but soccer is starting (the games) so i should be seeing him more since he goes to every game :P well i think i've rambeled enough about my life. there's just soo much going on. well off to san francisco for me!

 Ahh Life 


Life has just been too crazy for me to deal with lately. With all this shit going on, I'm getting to stressed out Mainly cuz of my sister's stupid car. I don't even know how I got sucked into all this bull shit. She should have gotten her act together and all this shit would have been done or atleast figured out. I have no idea how it's my fault because the guys are just taking and putting in the engine nothing else. If courtney and my dad had gotten it figured out earlier and hadnt caused so many problelms all of this would be no problem. But now since my dads blood pressure it too high to deal with any of this shit, he's giving up and having it towed to the junk. He's says it's my fault for his pressure being so high because I keep calling him every half hour (supposibly) and asking him what's going on. When you ask someone to do something for you, it's nice for you to let them know what the hell is going on. And that was what I was trying to do. Some how i got in the middle of all this shit. And now...I don't know what the hell to do. So pretty much...I'm doing NOTHING. Nothing at all. People can tlak to eachother and figure it out, I'm not making any phone calls, I'm not asking anyone for any favors...NOTHING at all.

Not only is this car shit getting to me, but everyone leaving has been such a reality check. I'm deeply sadened knowing that I will never see or talk to some people ever again. Friends that used to be a big part of your every day life and then poof, their gone. Of course you can still talk to them etc but in reality, with all do respect, you know you're never really going to talk anymore and slowly they are going to vanish for good. I know this is part of life, but I've never been one to allow friends go so easily. I mean I should be used to it by now but I hate it. I'm thankful that I will be sharing an apartment with a good friend but I'm still sad to see other ones gone. And i hate myself for not taking advantage of the Summer, to hang out with everyone. Not going to grad parties because of things that happened and because I worked to damn much. I wish I would have lived up high school better. But I had to work...otherwise I would not be where I am now.

I have finished my job. Thankfully I'm done with that piece of crap place. But at the same time, I ended earlier then I thought and am now completly broke. This has left me to be stressed out and in deed worried. Now I have to ask my parents to help me out for the next 3 months until soccer is over. They kept warning me not to do it but did I listen? No, of course not. Soccer is my life and I couldn't let my one last season slip away from me. But I guess I should have grown up and realized the smarter decision. Now I must face the consequences.

School is starting in less then a month. I'm excited, scared, nervous, everything. I'm truely thankful that I won't be going through all of this alone. I'm going to have familiarity since Wallen will be there. If she wasn't there, I don't know what I would do with myeslf honestly. I mean I had originally planned on staying in the dorms but I'm excited to be sharing an apartment with her. Having poster competitions and all lol. But anyways, I don't know.

I know my life's not horrible, there's just a lot of shit going on right now. I have someone good in my life, and I'm thankful for that. I'm thankful for everything, I'm just in a little rut right now. I know I will find my way out, I always some how do. It would just be nice to start college fresh, with nothing to worry about. But oh well. I'm moving soon, so I should be thankful I'm getting out right? Cuz I'd be getting away from all this car shit. Ahh but I'm sad about leaving my Dad (even if he hates me right now) I dunno whatever...Life goes on.

 Saying Good Bye 


So this past weekend I went camping with Crystal, her family, Steph and Thomas. I had a wonderful time, we didn't need alcohol to party it up or anything lol. Nah but seriously it was hella fun. I learned how to dirt bike (a little bit lol), we went for a night hike and we spent time at the resevoir. It was a good way to get away from what's been going on in my life and what will be going on in my life for the next couple of months. Life seems to keep throwing me curve balls to make sure I'm paying attention and at times it drives me crazy but what can I do right. Although I had a great time camping, and I wouldn't trade it for the world, I missed saying good bye to all of those going off to college. Everyone went to Chili's to have one last good bye. Unfortunately I wish I could have been there. I haven't gotten to say good bye to anyone cept Elissa really and even then it felt rushed. I hate saying good bye so part of me is okay with that but another part of me is upset about it. No one like's saying good bye and some of us like to believe that good be isn't forever but sometimes things re inevitable, which is unfortunate. But to all those who have been there for me, I thank you tremendously. To the TLC people, wow you all made the last three years of high school fun and memorable. With the LA trip, the council, the classes, the parties, etc. I'm going to miss you all so much and you all will forever carry a part in my heart. To Crystal: Wow you have been there for me ever since the day you came into my life. I'll never be able to repay you for all your hospitality, kindness, lovingness and friendship that you have given me. You have such a great heart, and I'm so happy things are finally going right for you. You absolutely deserve it. You are one person I know that will continue to be there for me and that I will never have to say good bye to. Thanks so much for all you do and remember I love you ohhhhhhhhh so much!!!! And remember all of our crazy memories of our summers ;) To Elissa: My Best. Man we've had some great times. Hawaii was an absolute blast. I wouldn't have wanted to spend it with anyone else. You are one person who has NEVER ever let me down. That's amazing to me. Thanks for always having an open ear and an open heart. I know you're going to go far in life. Have a great time in Sonoma, actually we are going to have a great time cuz I'm coming to visit your ass :) I love you Best!!! To Steph: Man, if anyone had an open ear, it would be you. You are always there willing to help me out in whatever situation I come across in. And I thank you for that. I will always love you for you. And remember to hang in there when things get rough. :) Love you!! To My Sister Melisa: Man, you are one heck of a person to hang out with. I always have so much fun with you and you always tell me straight up whats up. I have seen you go through many obstacles in your life and you have become a strong person because of that and I admire you for it. You have a beautiful baby girl and I know you are going to love her and do great things with your life. Thanks so much for always being there as a big sis and a friend. I hope you realize how much you've helped me. I love you! To My Sister Ashley: Wow can you remember back when we used to play school? I would have never thought that I was going to grow up to become a teacher. We always had so much fun together. We seemed to be the sisters who were around the most. I always remember you coming by my work and everyone talking about how you never smile and me saying to them, there not lucky, I get to see her beautiful smile all the time (cept when you're mad at me lol ;)) I know things haven't been easy for you lately, between losing friends and work but I know you're going to come out on top. You always do. I'm going to miss having you around to steal your stuff ;) and that sister to go to to see if that little black dress shows my ass LOL. No but seriously, you have been the sister I've always wanted and will always cherish. Thanks for allowing me to be a part of that. I will truely miss having you across my room. I love you Ashley! To Anna: Man I remember back when we used to always draw cards for Kyles basketball games in Cailottos class lol. Those were the days haha. I'm so glad I met you. I know I haven't seen you a lot but I want you to know that I always think about you and wish you the best. You better come visit Ashley and I a lot up in Turlock! Thanks for being there for me! To Manda Panda: Ohh am I glad I met you through Crystal. You always bring this glow to the group and you're always making me smile. I wish you the best at DVC and with Yamil. He's a great guy. Never forget how beautiful you are and how much I love you! To Katie M: Wow, I remember back when we had classes freshman year with Wilson. Ahh those were the days huh lol. You always seemed to be the quiet one but we some how got you out of your shell. You're a beautiful person inside and out. I wish you nothing but the best in all you do. Thanks for being you and thanks for the memories. I love you! To Brandon: Thanks for being my friend and being there for me. Thanks for showing me a side I thought I never had. I had a blast at my soccer tournament and Disneyland. You made my Summer. I hope you find what you truely want in life and that you hold on to it and never let go. I know you'll do good. Know that I'm always here for you.To Bryan: Thanks for being my bro. I know I never see you anymore but you're the one person I know who I can go awhile without talkin to but who will always be there. Stay goal oriented because you are one that's going to definetly succeed. I love you brother! To Kyle: Wow, I thank you for all the memories. I thank you for all the times you've fixed my computers lol Thanks for your kindness and never letting me down. You're going to have a great time in Sac. remember to live life to the fullest, party hard and have fun. Don't forget about the little people. :)  To Ruth: Wow the Alabama soccer team is lucky to have you! I can brag and say that I've played with ruth hanks before lol. Nah but really I wish you all the luck in the world out there. I know it's a big step to leave home, especially me ;) Man we've been friends since the 7th/8th grade. I miss the days we used to hang out in front of my house and play basketball. You were always the better person in all the sports we played. Remember 8th grade when we played softball for Tony? LOL good times! And we never won a game. And Jon and Kyle were there lol. I wish you could have been closer to me throughout the high school years but I know we will make up for it. I can't wait to come see you play soccer and kick ass. Know that I love you. And I truely truely truely am thankful for you being in my life. I Love you!

There's so many more people that I could say good bye to. But that would takes days and days. So I must say, thanks to everyone who has made an impact in my life. Here's to moving on to the next chapter of my life. Here's to the memories to come, tears, sadness, happiness, laughter etc. Here goes nothing. I love you all!!

 

And Wallen...No need to say good bye to you because I'm bringing you with me hahaha Lol. I love you and thanks so much for all you've done for me. I'll always remember your crazy parties. I can't wait to spend the next year living with you and making many many many more memories. *Here's a toast to Stanislaus buddies*

 Sad, Nervous, Excited, Happy, Disapointed? 
Current mood:  indifferent 

I don't know if I should be happy, sad, disapointed, excited, nervous or any other damn emotion. There's so much going on right now, and unfortunately it had to happen all at once. Losing friends, bf, leaving family, starting college, living with ashley, everything. All of it is happening at once and it's giving me nothing but mixed emotions. One second I'm completly happy to get the hell out of this place (cuz there's nothing and no one left for me) and the other is wanting to stay, wanting to know if there really is nothing left. I hate it. And you know what, I'll admit, I'm scared to death to start college. I don't think I'm scared to live out on my own, I've practicly been doing it for the past 3 years, but the workload college has to offer, and the friends that seem to not exist anymore is bothering me. I've had many interpretations on how my life was going to be before I start college and all the ways I thought it would be, didn't happen. I've always been the independent type, and don't get me wrong I like to be, but right now I feel too independent, lonely I guess. Elissa's been gone and I haven't sat down and had a real convo with her since Hawaii. Man that seems so long ago. I miss those days. I miss the care free days in general. Ahh all those times I thought I wanted to grow up and now I'm wanting to run away from it. Before I knew what I wanted, and I knew who and what was in my life. Now I'm lost, because everything I once wanted and dreamt about, seems to have disapeared right out of my reach. I know I'm scattered brain right now, don't mind me. But I could say I've learned something through all this mess or shall I say a few things. Don't take things for granted, Live each day to its fullest, Tell the ones you love that you love them, Don't hope things will happen rather MAKE them happen, don't dread over things from the past there's nothing you can do about it, Don't say you'll do something- just do it, Jump into life with eyes open so you can see the good the bad and the ughly, And for me personally, I don't think I'm going to trust people easily anymore. Man. So my stuff is pretty much all packed up. It hasn't been much fun I could tell you that. It didn't really hit me until right before I wrote all this, about an hour ago. My room is so...bare. My stuff is all ready to bring to my next chapter in life. Some stuff had to be left at home, boxed up and left to be nothing but memories. It's kinda sad...how fast people can enter and leave your life. It's even more sad...when you let that happen. Tommorow I will be moving my stuff into my apartment. I can't say I'm officially moving in yet. I have to come back home, take my cousin to practice and then leave to Lemoore for the weekend as I have a soccer tournament. Yup soccer is in full force now. Games for the next 2 and a half/3 months. I had fun the first soccer tournament we went to but now I just like to forget about it. That is what almost kept me from playing. I thought nothing could take the one sport I love from me, nothing , And so I learned in the end, nothing can keep me from Soccer, just my emotions can. So now I'm currently trying to find my love for the sport again.  After the last couple of practices though I think I've become more happy with it. I can't help but love the girls on the team and for once, I actually feel like I belong. So anyways back to my apartment, i'll probably be officially moved in on monday (sleeping in it and all). I've got sooo much crap, hopefully i can get it somewhat organized so wallen doesn't have to look at my crap. I still haven't found a desk I'll have to keep searching. Anyways i went from having a sentimental blog to talking about needing a desk lol. But yeah that's just PART of what's going on in my head LOL :P"

It's pretty crazy, I'm graduating in 17 freaken days! Can you believe that? I can't...what-so-ever. I'm pretty excited to be getting out in the real world and starting my own life but definetly sad and nervous and scared. I have decided to go to CSU Stanislaus in Turlock. It's pretty close to home so that's always nice. I move in September 2 (I'll be living on campus) and school starts September 7th. Crazy shit. Overall this year went well. I lost some friends, gained some friends, become closer to already friends. I'm still with Kyle, we're doing great. Lets see what else is new. Last night we had a scholarship night and I received a $1,000 scholarship from EDYSL (East Diable Youth Soccer League) So that was totally awesome and unexpected! But anyways I don't really have much else to say right now, well I'm sure I do I just can't think of anything. Soo i'll try not to be a stranger haha. Love you guys."

"event","wow life has been completly busy lately. been hella busy with school, soccer work and trying to leave some time for myself. try to make time to see kyle as well. we didnt get to hang out with eachother for like 2 weeks because we were both soo busy, we only got to see eachother at school. but now that we're on break we get to see eachother and i finally have time to relax. i still have soccer and work but its cool. didnt get scheduled that much this week so im thankful. i cant believe christmas is almost here. its pretty crazy. this year went by so freaken fast. i was reading crystals survey and it just reminded me more and more of what ive been thinking about so much lately. i miss the summer so much. it was so awesome and i wish it continued. i think that was and will be the best summer i ever had. everything was so perfect then, and nothing could ruin it. i had my friends and boyfriend too (not that i dont have a great one now ;)) but we all just had a lot of fun together. but ever since school started all that disapeared. its a shame. i would give to have that back but then i think about what i have gotten since that ended and im happy. i mean nicole and morgan and i all talk now and hang out which is cool. i got to visit rocky and her mom for the first time in like a year lol. and of course the most importnat thing, i've gotten kyle back. but i think by getting all this, i had to give up a lot.it wasn't to hard too give it up because others already seemed to have given up. i reacted on their acts. there too caught up in eachother now, its not really important to them anymore. ill forever miss them but forever cherish and remember all the good times i had with them all. there all seniors now anyways, they've got to figure out what there doing with there life, there gonna be gone from me anyways. shoot i hate thinking about it it makes me sad. i miss crystal and thomas too. shit happens though i guess. i did talk to crystal the other night. not for long but it was nice. i wish things would go better for her but im sure they will. im glad shes back home though, she needed it. i miss all three of us hanging out and just having a good time, not careing about anything. its all good though. i got an email and well whatever nevermind. but anyways life is doing pretty good though besides the minor set backs. kyle and i are goin strong and im so thankful to be given a second oppertunity to make things work. schools doing pretty good, glad to be on break..its helped me out a lot. my grades were pretty good or should be, i should have all A's and a C. the c in math lol dang math. soccer was going pretty good for awhile. im on varsity which is what ive always wanted too accomplish. i started the first two season games and played about half the game. we are 2-0 for league but i think 1-2 for outside of league. i didn't start in the game yesturday and only played 10 minutes. it was a bummer but i understand. im having a really hard time working with one of the girls on my team and im about to sock her but its okay things will work out. we have a tournament next weekend, that should be interesting and we'll see how that goes. ill just have to step it up and work harder so i can play. works been okay, i hate my job but thats okay. i was just thankful that i wasnt given many hours for this week cuz i really needed the break cuz soccer is physically tiring me out. i cant believe christmas is in three days thats freaken crazy!!! im not sure exactly what im doing yet for christmas. i know i have soccer and work on christmas eve. i think everyone is coming over on christmas day. anyways i know ive written too much for my own good. i better go clean my room or somehin. i hope everyones doing good and merry christmas to you all"

Hello Lindsey,

Long time no see, hope all is well with you and you are getting jazzed 
for the High School soccer season! Varsity is yours this year, yeah!

Hey I am e-mailing you because I have a question to ask you. Actually I 
am going to ask you for permission to use your name on an award that 
Coach Lee and I would like to hand out this year at our season ending 
team party.

Here is the jist of it. I was suggesting to Coach Lee that this year 
along with having the girls vote for MVP and Most Inspirational, we 
should add a award for ""Team Player"", the one who puts team before herself 
in all soccer matters. As I was describing this to Lee I said ""you know, 
kind of like Lindsey H***** always did"". So naturally we got the bright 
idea of calling it the ""Lindsey H***** Team Player Award"".

So there is the story. Now I want to see if you would mind us putting 
your name on an award and immortalizing you forever as being an example 
of what other female soccer players should aspire to be when it comes 
to being a team player.

Think about it and please discuss it with your family to see if it is 
O.K. with everyone. Most of all is it O.K. with you. If you don't feel 
comfortable with us using your name please let us know how much money it 
will cost to buy the rights ; )

No really though, all kidding aside, if you are not comfortable with 
this please tell me and I will kill the idea, dead.

Thanks for your time, looking forward to seeing you again during High 
School season. Best of luck with the try-outs. Believe in yourself, I 
know you can make Varsity this year!

Cheers,
Will"

Broken this fragile thing now
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
And I've thrown my words all around
But I can't, I can't give you a reason

I feel so broken up 
And I give up 
I just want to tell you so you know

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one

Made my mistakes, let you down
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Ran my whole life in the ground
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone

And something's breaking up 
I feel like giving up 
I won't walk out until you know

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one who gets me like you do
You are my only my only one

Here I go so dishonestly
Leave a note for you my only one
And I know you can see right through me
So let me go and you will find someone

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one, no one like you
You are my only, my only one

this one is crap, i guess its just all about feelings though, and im not finished obviously but whatever here goes nothing

Now that i have let you go
i dont have that special glow
i miss holding you tight
but i guess it just wasnt right 
at the time you wern't true
i never saw it through your view
you never told me how you felt
you knew that you made my heart melt
i guess you just couldn't care about me
so  i decided to let you go without a plea
plus the long distance just wouldnt work
it would have caused us to go berserk
i may never know what could have been
but i must move on with a grin
you've already moved on
you're already gone
i have moved on as well
some thigns aren't worth the dwell

Heres a poem crystal wrote using my feelings


As the minutes pass, I continue to wonder
And replay and revise every single blunder
You keep me on my toes, the suspense is killing me
When will you let me know, when will you set us free
What is it you fear, why can't you just swallow your pride
You know when you lost me, a part of you died
So why is it your affraid to get that part of you back
What is it you think that you see that I lack
Right now you have me waiting and as long as you'll need you'll get
And you know when you decide right, our love will once again be set
Anticipation runs deep, I wish that you would just hurry
I wish that my name in your heart would no longer be blurry
Even though you hold me close and every second remains dear
I hate it because all it does is invoke more unwanted fear.

another one

How come girls like me have to be in love
How come we have to feel like we're flying above
I feel my chances slipping steadely through my hands
As I'm trying to hold on to my hearts' demands
I knew there were no for sures
I just feels like my hearts suppose to be yours
Stop telling me that you are nothing but confused
Each time you say that, I feel my heart being abused
You know when you're with me, I'm who you want
Stop playing your games, you continue to haunt
I realize you don't know what you should do
But these chances are getting slim, this is the last of the few
I've already sacrificed more than I can handle
My light is about to blow out on this last candle
the only thing that's going to keep it lit
Is knowign that you and I will once again fit
I've done all I can, now it's your turn
Is our relationship what you truely want and yearn?"

(later on it turns out at the second game they played the goalie got hurt and so did this other girl that was talkin shit, so i guess karma is bad huh guys? :P) anyways i didnt play much at that game at all. my dad got pretty pissed and wants to put me on Lee's team that way i can play. well see i started the game, cuz the girls didnt show up to practice, then i played for about 7 minutes and then he took me out and i didnt play until the last 5 minutes of the game. yeah my dad was pissed behond no others. and other parents were asking why he didnt have me in,. sorry guys cant answeer that question. so my dad and i agreed we would see how the next game went before my dad switched me teams. so after the game my step-mom, dad and i went out to lunch. then we had to go back to the field and play another game at 4:30. we won this game 2-1. oh yeah forgot to mention turtle scored all three goals in the first game, hat trick for her muah, then she scored one of them in the second game. great stuff go turtle. at the second game i didn't start and i played like 8 minutes the first half. he finally game me about 15 minutes in the second half. so linzi didn'tplay much and she didn't score but she did assist on one of the goals for turtle. so today we have to go back out there and play two more games. the first game we need to win if we want to get 1st or second. so if we lose that game we play for 3rd or 4th. so we are guaranteed two games today cuz the teams be won lost both times. so yup yup. my dad and amanda r coming to my games today. im actually leaving in 45 minutes so i better start getting ready lol. well hope the party went well crystal and with your mom too. luv ya. talk to ya guys later adios"

"event","ok crappy poem number 37 lol


As my lips touch yours, I start to feel the fluttering inside
Everything is whole again, for once I havent yet cried
It feels like my heart has sunken into my chest
I feel like an ordinary girl who just happened to get blessed
Blessed with such an awesome guy to hold on to
To these feelings I wil hold true
I don't know if he is going to do the same
Love is all luck, it's like a game
Whether you lose or no you'll later find out
This is just what love is all about
It's all about taking up the chance
You don't want it to disapear in a glance
You never know, it just might be worth the tears
So just set forget about it all and aside your fears
Who knows he just might be the one
If so, then the game of love, you've won."

"event","random poem from someone named kyle.(muah crystal for you) tell me how you guys would interpret the meaning. hmmm interesting stuff
It's Not Fair
Its not fair,
To watch them Fly.
Being Stuck on the ground,
Not up in the Sky.
To watch them soar,
From tree to Tree.
Wishing from a far,
It could be Me.

Its not fair,
For them to be Free.
To soar across the land,
And over the Sea.
I wish one day,
That could be Me.
To be let out of this cage,
And truley be Free."

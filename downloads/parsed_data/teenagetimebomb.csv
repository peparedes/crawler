"event","<P>Last night at the Anchor show...While Blood Comes Ashore was playing, Tony from xSaintsneversurrenderx came up to me and was like, ""Do you own a white cutlass sierra?"" And I said, ""No, it's a buick century."" And he said, ""Yeah, with a bunch of stickers, right?"" And I said, ""Yeah, why?"" And then he said, ""Well it's been hit."" And I said, ""What do you mean it's been hit?"" And he's like ""Some guy in a truck hit it, he's out there now."" And I was like, ""How bad?"" And he said, ""Really bad."" And then I ran outside with Tony, Matisse, and Sarah Leavell on my heels. I ran up to my car and threw a huge fit. I started cussing and screaming and kicking my car then burst into tears because this car meant more to me than most people on this planet. I called my mom and she and Jim Miller came out, and we all talked to the cop that came. I guess the guy fell asleep at the wheel and barreled right into the back of my car, drove off, and came back later because he felt bad or something. I don't know anything for sure, but I sure hope I get a good car out of this. I won't say ""BETTER"" because NO FUCKING CAR BEAT MY BABY. &lt;/3</P>

My favorite people always leave.
The informal goodbye of an online farewell.
Damien = It's been so much fucking fun, the few times we've actually hung out and spoken. I wish you the best.
Alex = You're better off away from this place, I hope you achieve all the fun you've been searching for. I WILL miss you.
Nolan = I'm not sure when or where you will be going anymore, the plan keeps changing, I hope you pick the right place.
Clinton = It's so neat seeing you back in town, but Germany must be so much cooler. I can't wait until you're back for a longer amount of time.
Matisse = You don't leave for a few months, and you won't be far off, but you're the coolest fucking girl, and I'll miss our weekend shenanigans.

God, who else is leaving so I can write you a formal goodbye?"

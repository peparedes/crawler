"event","I haven't posted in a while.  It's been a difficult couple of weeks, and I'm just now getting some space in which to relax a bit.  A number of life-changing things have happened all at once, and I am still trying to process how they will affect the future.

For one thing, I've given up my studio space over at Artworks.  I had sort of an epiphany over the holidays that I am just now implementing.  While talking with a good friend of mine (who does marvelous art, and who used to be in the SCA but doesn't really play anymore), I realized that what I really love is doing my art for ME.  Not for someone else.  Doing it for fun.  And anything that turns it into work of any variety causes me to lose interest in it. 

I've seen it happen time and time again - with the C&I, with the painting, with the photography, and with the metalworking.  After Harrison came, I really didn't have much of a chance to go into my studio to work.  By the time he'd settled in and gotten an idea of what the house rules were, I found I just wasn't as interested in working in metal as I had originally thought I'd be. I really didn't understand why at first.  But it was because I was trying to turn it into a business - and therefore, work.  So I am going to work on my art just for fun, for me.  As I joked to my sister when I talked to her about it, I'm gonna be the Emily Dickinson of the art world.

Having Harrison is also really life-changing.  This little guy is the light of my life, and I just can't imagine not having him around.  We're working on the basics - sit, stay, down... he's very smart, and sometimes doesn't listen because he doesn't want to, but obedience classes and continual practice seem to be helping that.

The big life-changing event that I haven't quite gotten through and processed yet is saying goodbye to my elderly lab-shep mix, Annie.  After 14 years of having her around, she was put to sleep this past Tuesday. It was a hard decision to make.  She was fully grown when I adopted her from the SPCA 14 years ago, so she lived to a ripe old age (15 years old is especially good, for a shepherd/lab).  

The hard thing about it was that, physically, she was fine. There was no inappropriate peeing in the house.  She was still able to navigate the stairs down to the backyard.  She had a hearty appetite.  But something wasn't right.  

She'd always been a nervous dog (not socialized at all, and incredibly neurotic, since she'd been in the shelter from the time she was six weeks old until I adopted her at just under a year).  The last few years she was on thyroid medication and amitriptyline (the latter is prescribed for anxiety).  She had begun to whine and pace around the house, making endless circles of the dining room table.  She'd had occasional intestinal problems.  She'd refuse to take treats out of my hand.  When she began waking up at 2:30 in the morning thinking it was daytime, and wanting to go roaming around the backyard and dig in the leaves, I began to understand that she was losing what little mind she had.  The vet said she was showing classic signs of dementia.  It wasn't curable or reversable.  She'd only get worse - possibly to the point where she wouldn't know me at all.

So I made the kindest and hardest decision that I've ever had to make.  The vet came over to the house (I wasn't going to have Annie's last moments marred by the stress and anxiety she'd inevitably feel about going to his office).  My son Robert came over to say goodbyeand to be with her (Annie was sort of ""his"" dog while he lived here).  We stroked her still-soft fur gently, and she lay in her favorite spot on the living room floor while the vet administered the needle.  She went quickly, and peacefully.

I will be the first to admit that I never really felt that I bonded with this dog that I had had for 14 years.  She was often a pain to deal with - her anxiety levels were very hard for us all to get through, and she had some very peculiar traits (only drinking water if it was outside on the deck, for example, even when there were water bowls inside, or walking out of our bedroom only on the left-hand side of the door).  But she was a loving dog, and a good one.  

And in many ways she was my teacher.  She taught me patience - and how to find more when you think that all your patience is gone.  She taught me how it feels to be the object of unconditional love.  And despite the relief that I feel at not having to deal with such a high level of neurosis anymore, I will indeed miss her.

Rest well, Annie."

"event","Yes, I know.  It's been a looonnngggg time since I last posted.  Harrison is doing very well (except for a distressing tendency to think it's great fun to rush the back fence and challenge bark the neighbor's two Akitas, that is).  He currently has tonsilitis. This doesn't have me too worried (although hearing him at 5 AM sound like a cat horking up a hairball was waaay too much fun). But apparently this is one of the things that Havanese get easily (kinda like a baby's ear infections), so he's on antibiotics, and slippery elm for sore throat.  

Every day I am just amazed at how blessed I am to have him in my life.

Of course, I'm not getting anything else done - haven't stepped into my studio in over six weeks (closer to eight, actually).  But that's OK, surprisingly. I am happier than I've been in a very long time, and just totally in LOVE with my Harrison.

Why?  For one thing, he makes me laugh.

As I explained to my wonderful, long-suffering husband,  

It's ALL about the dog right now.

"event","Harrison's gotten a new 'do' - I decided to go 'puppy cut' for him.  It was the first time I'd actually seen his eyes (before, you couldn't see them for all that hair).  He is such an amazing dog.  I still can't quite believe my good luck in finding him - having him in my life is such a blessing.  Especially after all the issues I've had with rescue dogs.  He isn't quite a rescue, but he is an adoption - Havanese are so rare in the U.S. that they are normally expensive little dogs - I'd have to take out a significantly sized loan in order to get one.  I had been researching breeds when I ran across the Havanese, and really liked the description of their personality and temperament.  I just figured I'd have to save my pennies for a few years in order to afford one.  

We are fortunate to have several good breeders in my area, including a veterinarian.  As it turned out, her office is right around the corner from where I live.  So I was able to go visit her last summer and see what a Havanese is like in person - I got to meet her (five?) (six?) Havanese. They were delightful.  And yet, still pretty much out of reach.

After the fiasco with Charlie, I got discouraged about finding a dog through the rescue groups.  I was literally going on Petfinder daily for about three months... nothing. It came to me that what I really needed to do was make owning a Havanese my goal, even if it took me a few years. So I was out visiting the vet at her house, and meeting her newest litter, and getting information on the cost of a puppy (believe me, you don't want to know). I happened to mention that I'd had bad luck with rescue groups, and really wanted to find a dog I could use as a therapy dog.  She looked at me, and said, ""I think that I know just the dog for you"".  It was a little male Havanese that a friend (also a breeder) had.  The friend was moving out of state, and had decided to find a home for her male stud.  So, I found myself going over to the friend's house, met Harrison, and fell in love.

I'll be honest and say that he isn't the easiest dog in the world.  Havanese require a fair amount of attention, and they can be a bit stubborn. Sometime I'll call him, and he'll come running; other times he looks at me like, well, WHAT? And then goes back to contemplating the squirrels in the backyard.  Frustrating, a bit.

But oh so worth it. Every single moment."

Like nothing's going right.  Not work.  Not studio stuff.  Not dog search.  Nothing. Feeling isolated and lonely, but don't seem to have the energy to even care about doing anything about it.

Not a good week, this. Usually this doesn't happen to me until February, when the lack of light just zings me.  This early in the season, though?  Hoping it's hormonal (menopause is a bitch, lemme tell you).

After all, I really think that every day is a day to be thankful, and we don't need a Hallmark Holiday to celebrate gratefulness.  So, on this day, ten things I am thankful for:

1.  My sons, Robert and Christopher.  I think they're turning out just fine, despite my maternal errors and omissions.

2.  My husband, Ray.  The nicest man I've ever met.  He takes care of me when I can't, and supports me in whatever decisions I make.

3.  Dr. Seuss.  Specifically, Horton Hears a Who, and Green Eggs and Ham.

4.  Mr. Rogers.  Yes, I know I'm a geek, but how can you not love a man who wore a sweater and smiled so gently?

5.  Captain Kangaroo and Mr. Greenjeans.

6.  Chocolate.  Dark chocolate.

7.  Orange shakes from Arby's.

8.  Football.  And baseball.

9.  The Red Sox (even if they really sucked this year).

10.  Every single one of you out there.  It's good to have friends."

"event","Well, Charlie's gone back to the SPCA.  I had really really hoped that Wednesday would be better, but it wasn't.  The little bugger had managed to get out of the barrier that I had put up for him. To keep him in the hallway and bedroom, I set up a system of metal grates that are six feet tall and heavy across the hallway, and TIED them to the door on either side.  Then he went downstairs and ate all the cat food in the bowl, came upstairs and managed to get the dog food bin out of the space between the cabinets that I had wedged it into (not an easy feat by any means - it was wedged tightly in there), knocked it over, and proceeded to make a feast on its contents.

Then he peed on the floor in my kitchen.

When I came home from work (early - mind you - we're talking about seven hours that I've left him alone), it was to a house that looked like a tornado had hit it.  Not to mention the unmentionables that he deposited downstairs in my studio.... perhaps a logical result of all of that additional food, but still unpleasant in the extreme to clean up.

I realize that he was just being a dog, and doing what dogs do, but only one reaction was possible.  I started crying.

And then I picked up the phone and called the SPCA. I was still crying, but I managed to get a live person to sob at, rather than a voicemail recording. And when they told me that their first appointment to return him was next Monday, I started crying even harder, at which point they allowed me to bring him back immediately (I think they realized that they were speaking to a woman on the edge).

So I loaded Charlie into the car along with all his things (meds, food, vet records),  drove him back to the SPCA, and gave him up.  And yes, I was still crying.

It really hurt.  I agonized the entire way about whether or not I was making the right decision.  After all, he's a really really sweet dog.  He's wonderful with kids, cats, strangers.  He's an absolute cuddle-pooch.  But he really needs to be with a family where there's someone at home all day to watch him and keep him from getting bored and into trouble.  And yes, I miss him a lot more than I should after having had him around for less than two weeks.

But it was the right decision (painful though it was).  It's Thanksgiving morning, and I feel a lot more relaxed than I have for the past couple of weeks. My ears are not pricked up, listened for the sounds of illicit rustling (or worse). I actually slept until eight (instead of waking up at six to Charlie's 'helicopter ears' - he'd shake his head, and sound like he was taking off). And I can go work in my studio for more than ten minutes without having to stop and check on him.

If I've learned one thing from all of this, though, it's that I sometimes have an overly-optimistic view of my coping ability and patience levels.  I guess I just need to develop a better understanding of my limits.

But it's hard not to feel like I've failed - that I should have been more patient and given it enough time to work through the problems.  But I guess I just don't have that in me right now."

"event","omigod.  I have had a day you just wouldn't believe.  Like, take the absolute WORST day ever, and multiply by ten.

Words just fail me.

I almost wrote the details, but it would've taken waaaay too long (not to mention the sharing violations).  Suffice it to say, Charlie has separation anxiety, is NOT doing well in a crate for even four hours at a stretch, and gets carsick.  Big time. 

You can just imagine the rest.

This, of course, compounded by rain and nasty weather, and a neighbor's idiot seventeen-year-old son who doesn't understand what ""Right-of-Way"" means when he's turning left (yes, he nearly turned left INTO my NEW CAR).  

Trust me - I let his dad know about it.

Meanwhile, this is a good day for a beer or three (or four), and a frozen pizza (I'm finally eating dinner at almost ten o'clock at night... sheeessh).

And as far as Charlie goes, he's a great dog.  Really.  The SPCA training lady even thought he'd make a good therapy dog, which is what I was looking for in the first place.

Now, if I can just stop him from throwing up in the car. 

The third time *it* happened, I was so ready to throw up my hands in despair that all I could do was start laughing.

And yes, I'm keeping him (at least, for now).  If I didn't, I think my vet would shoot me, since he's fallen in love with the little lug."

"event","The adjustment period for the new dog is going, well, okaaayyyy, I suppose.

Charlie's starting to settle in, but we're currently working on crate training (which I've never done before, never having had the need for it).  The issue is that a basset, when left alone for eight hours, will get bored (and somewhat anxious - bassets NEED their people!).  The result is usually destructive (although they think they're just being helpful).  A recent acquaintance who has owned bassets for a long time recounted the story of her little basset girl who liked to ""redecorate"" by tearing the wallpaper off the walls.  Sheesh.

Charlie's not quite that bad, but we have had knitting yarn strewn all over the living room and the bottom of a plastic bag holding needlepoint torn out, and the little fan on top of the chest of drawers in the bedroom knocked over, and .....  just little stuff, so far (other than the cat food binge that had me worried about bloat, which is very dangerous for bassets). Oh yeah, and the library book that ended up with teeth marks along the spine.

Little stuff like that.  Yeah.

So today was his first LONG day in the crate - he seemed to fine this past weekend with it, even going in it in the evening to take a 'nap' while we watched t.v.  He was a bit frantic, though, with the four hours this morning (my lovely son actually went over to the house to let him out at mid-day), followed by the four hours after that... by the time I got home, he had squished the doggie bed up against the back of the crate, and the waterbowl was tipped over.  Guess we'll need to work on this some more.  But as my friend put it, at least he's safe, and you know that he's not getting into something that will hurt him.

And yes, I'd rather he be a bit frantic than get hurt.

But it's still an adjustment.  Guess we'll just have to get through this one way or another....."

We're probably going to have a quiet evening at home.  The sweetie's gone to get Outback, and we'll just sit around in front of the television.  He got me a flexshaft for the occasion - more tools!  For those who don't know, a flexshaft is like a dremel with a foot pedal.  It rocks for grinding, polishing, drilling, or whatever.  My sweetie is the BEST!

In other news, I've adopted a new dog.  Yes, another one!  He's a basset hound mix that I'm calling Charlie.  We're doing pretty well (although housebreaking a four-year-old can be a pain in the ass).  The only thing we're a bit stumped about right now is the ""left-alone-in-the-house-and-getting-bored-and-anxious-getting-into-things-and-chewing-them-up"" phase.

"event","Well, Tempore Atlantia worked out okay - not the greatest in the world, but I am hoping that everyone went away reasonably satisfied with their feedback, and that everyone was recognized appropriately.  We had several snafus with sponsors not showing up due to Life, and some categories that weren't done as a result. 

The weirdest thing (at least, to me) was that there were specific categories for the time period, but there were a LOT of ""general' entries that had nothing to do with the categories being sponsored. Not ever having run a Tempore Atlantia before (and it's been positively YEARS since I've run any kind of arts competition of any sort) I don't know if this was normal, or not.  It did sorta throw me for a loop at first.

Also, I had only one (yes ONE) judge volunteer in advance.  All's I can say about that is THANK HEAVEN for all those folks that I hit up the day of the event - I actually had a veritable wealth of judges to assist. So, a GREAT BIG THANK YOU to:  Iseulte, Elspet, Roksanne, Helwynn, Naomi, Isobel, Margret, Genevieve, and Tirloch for taking the time to help.  Y'all really got my butt out of a sling on that one.

Sunday was a wonderful day - I spent a good portion of the afternoon and evening down in my studio, and it was a really productive session.  For reasons that I won't go into here, I had not had a torch to solder with for over a month, but finally got everything working properly yesterday, so I could do some flamework (outside of my jewelry class, that is) for the first time in quite some time.  It felt good - and I'm actually pretty used to the idea of working with acetylene now.  Considering that I used to be so afraid of gas that I didn't know how to turn on the grill and cook something on it, that's pretty good.

So, more jewelry and 'stuff' is almost done, and ready for the studio.  I'll post photos soon - and a website is planned for December (woo hoo!)."

"event","I had my first opening last Friday night.  I didn't let anyone know, because the studio's only about half full at this point - just enough stuff to justify opening, but not enough to really be 'putting on the dog' about it.  I'm actually glad that I didn't tell anyone - there was a live band out in the main gallery (my gallery space is just off the main gallery).  The music was pretty good (bluesy, sorta), but soooo loud that I HAD TO SHOUT to make myself heard.  I had a sore throat by the end of the evening (not to mention a headache).  So, it wouldn't have been pleasant for anyone (certainly wasn't for me).

I didn't sell anything, but did get a lot of good feedback on my work.  All of my good artist buddies (who also rent space either there or next door at Plant Zero) think that my work is good.  And they're the type that wouldn't say so unless they meant it, so I am pretty jazzed about it.

I've been working this week on learning how to solder a silver bezel onto a copper back - so far I've tried it twice, only to have the bezel fall off when I go to put it in the pickle (the stuff that cleans all the crap off of the metal after it's been soldered).  I'm going to try again tomorrow night (tonight being Halloween, I'm gonna bail on my own house so I don't have to listen to the doorbell ring).

Yes, I'm one of THOSE people who don't do the trick or treat thing.  What can I say?  I'd have to either sit outside (ok on warm nights, not so good on cold ones), or keep going up and down the stairs a hundred times to answer the door (split foyer house, you don't have a choice - you HAVE to go downstairs to answer the door from the living room).  And when I got there, I'd probably find out that there were teenagers at the door (not many little kids in my neighborhood).

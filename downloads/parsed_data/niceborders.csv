So she had ridden through the night, parked the Beastie in the drive of her quiet house, unlocked the three deadbolts, and staggered, cross-eyed, up to her bedroom.

When she hit the covers, a cloud of dust lifted into the air, swirling in the shafts of light from the window. 

Ivanova groaned. ""If these business trips get any longer, I'm hiring a housekeeper . . .""

One was the jacket of her <a href=""http://www.st-spike.org/images/nontrek/babylon5/uniforms_1.gif"">military uniform</a>, the rest of which was hanging, neatly pressed, in her closet. The other was the leather jacket Faith had given her Saturday night, in the same blue and brown. Upon closer inspection, even the <a href=""http://www.st-spike.org/images/nontrek/babylon5/rank_captain.gif"">command insignia</a> along her collar were there. Captain. She'd barely even worn the title when this new life had swallowed her whole.

No, the jackets weren't her quandary. She knew which one she was choosing at the moment. As soon as she was done with this she would hang the uniform jacket in the closet with the rest of it, for if and when she was needed on duty. It was the <a href=""http://www.patchgeeks.com/catalog/images/B5_100.jpg"">patch</a> on the shoulder of her jacket that was causing her grief. The Babylon 5 insignia was, to her, the most important part of the uniform. It was where her closest allegiances lay, inextricably bound with her loyalty to Earth. And, as Faith had said, every biker needs to have colours. So, logically, the patch should be removed from the uniform and put on the leather jacket. She had needle and thread to do so. She even had the skill needed.

But defacing her uniform was . . . hard. She was pretty sure it was against regulations (not that that really mattered to her, most of the time). But she also knew that replicating the patch was against regulations, and that one rather did matter to her, in a sort of twisted logic.

Regulations are really more like guidelines anyway, right?

Taking a deep breath, she jerked the patch free from the uniform and began sewing.

That's a rather matter-of-fact way to begin something, isn't it? And also rather epic. That's how the Seamus Heaney translation of <i>Beowulf</i> begins. 

So. I finally have a job. Some of you know that I have been looking for a job - any job - for over a month, since I moved back home from university. I live in a big, booming city where less than half the population speak unaccented English. One would think I would be able to find a job quite easily. No. 

But I have one. As of 8AM tomorrow I am a cubefarmer. I'll be working Mon - Fri, 8 to 4, and probably going to bed earlier than my usual 2 or 3AM. Meaning that my roleplaying time just went waaaaay down. Until I get myself straightened out and adjusted to the new schedule, Polgara, Ivanova, and Camulus are going to be rather scarce, and for this I apologise. 

If you need my pups for anything in particular, drop me an email and I'll try to be there. 

Now, to buy appropriate cubefarming clothes and some sensible shoes. And I don't believe this post properly expressed my absolute SQUEE over finally being employed!"

Which could explain why she was currently dancing around her apartment to the music blaring over the stereo, singing 'Do You Believe In Magic' into the neck of a bottle of vodka with half-empty take-away cartons and chopsticks littering the coffee table.

So Ivanova grabbed one of Roger's shirts, long enough that it covered everything, and slipped out into the living room, hoping to avoid detection by any possible roommate activity.

"event","Alright. I won't go over every detail of Ivanova's past, as you can find a very thorough and accurately reference biogrpahy <a href=""http://worldsofjms.com/b5/characters/ivanova.htm"">here</a> and a good character profile <a href=""http://tgm.firstones.com/wiki/Ivanova"">here</a>. I quite like the opening line of that one: ""A Russian Jew, who has lost all of her blood relatives to various tragedies, and has never done well in romances, Susan is an odd combination of perky, paranoid, hopeful and fatalistic.""

But there are a few points I'd like to stress, as well as where she stands in her personal canon. 

<lj-cut text=""Telepathy."">The matter of telepathy is a big one. First of all, Ivanova hates telepaths. In the glorious world of the future, it was decided on Earth that telepaths are dangerous. As such, they are all registered and strictly controlled by the PsiCorps. Usually people are identified as telepaths quite young, either by their parents turning them in, voluntarily turning themselves in, or periodic screening by schools. The children are then given to the PsiCorps to raise - one of the reasons that all telepaths have the slogan ""The Corps is mother, the Corps is father permanently tattooed on their brains. If a person is identified as a telepath, they have three choices: join the Corps and leave their former life; go to jail; be put on a regime of telepathy-suppressing drugs. 

Ivanova's mother was a telepath who avoided detection until her thirty-fifth birthday, when Ivanova was eleven. She was put on the drugs, which eventually caused her to commit suicide after losing more and more of herself. Thus, the reason that Ivanova hates telepaths. The irony of the situation is that Ivanova herself is a low-level, latent telepath. Her family moved around a lot to keep one step ahead of the Corps, and her mother taught her how to fool the tests at school. She can't do very much at all except block another telepath from entering her mind. Here's where we break from canon a bit. The Fandomyness of Fandom High caused her abilities to develop slightly. She's still only a P1 at best, but she can read surface thoughts of people she is very, very close to. At the moment, this means Tonks and that's it. She's slightly empathetic, but her naturally abrasive personality renders this almost void. 

So, if your character is a telepath and Ivanova finds this out - whether by you saying something or attempting to scan her - she will be very, very angry. It's a gut reaction from a lifetime spent in fear that she'll probably get over fairly quickly, but she'll still be very suspicious of you. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Love."">Which brings me to my second point. Lurve. Ivanova is snarky, sarcastic, and very, very skeptical. Partially because of her horrible track record in love. She has three romantic interests throughout the show: the guy whose name I can never remember, Talia Winters, and Marcus Cole. The first was a one-episode renewal of an old relationship, but the guy in question turned out to be an anti-alien, pro-human militant who was sent to jail for trying to kill an ambassador. The romance with Talia probably lasted about a season. They have breakfast together a few times, and only the most WASPy WASP could miss the fact that they were sleeping together in the episode 'Divided Loyalties'. Ivanova also admits to loving Talia a few episodes later; what makes this tragic is that she's a PsiCorps commerical telepath. Talia was secretly programmed as a spy by the PsiCops, the military arm of the PsiCorps, and her hidden program was activated. Her personality was wiped and replaced by a cold bitch who didn't care anything for Ivanova. Painful break-up number one.

Number two was Marcus Cole. After the Talia incident, Ivanova got gunshy. She didn't let herself fall in love again because she was afraid of getting hurt. So for two seasons, she and Marcus just USTed all over the place while being ridiculously adorable. Then she got blown up and he saved her life. Using an alien device, he literally sapped his own life to give it to her. And because there was no one there to stop the process, he died. Painful break-up number two, complete with heart-breaking monologue about how all love is unrequited and she should have at least boffed him.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Sex."">And with love comes sex. Obviously. So let's talk about Ivanova's sexual orientation for a moment. She is canonically bisexual. This isn't me and slash fans like me reading into the material. The Great Maker himself declared it so, as did Claudia Christian in her infamous interview in which she said, ""I've been typecast. I'm the Russian bisexual telepathic Jew."" So, yes, she's Jewish, too. To make her a bit more random. She also said the following:

<blockquote>Claudia: Ivanova only spent one night with her lover, Talia. It was done in such a way that if you were a kid you could say, ""oh it's a sleep-over!"" and if you were and adult you might go ""hmmm"". And, of course, if you were a bloke you'd go ""Whoa! Yeah!""
FH1: Do you really think they had sex then?
Claudia: Yeah, we were a little too old for sleep-overs.
FH1: Are you glad you didn't have to do a screen kiss for the part?
Claudia: I wouldn't have minded. Andrea Thompson [who plays Talia] is a beautiful woman, and we were er . . . friendly.</blockquote>
Anyways, this makes her one of the first (and only) bisexual characters on television, because she isn't straight-who-becomes-gay or gay-who-is-cured. She loved Talia, and had a thing with Marcus. Several previous relationships are hinted at, but the only one for certain was with a man. Now, I say 'had a thing' for a reason. She never, ever says that she loves Marcus. Marcus says it. His dying words are actually, ""I love you."" Ivanova only says that she should have boffed him at the very least. All of her subsequent romantic relationships in Fandom have been with women. Unless you count flirting with Han Solo and that one drunken one-night-stand with Blackadder. But! Onwards, to . . .</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Fandom."">. . . Fandom! My Ivanova is the same one that was at Fandom High. Her original reasons for leaving Babylon 5 are the same as in the show: she was running away from Marcus's death. In the show, she was promoted to captain and given a ship of her own for a shakedown cruise. For Fandom purposes, this wasn't quite fast or far enough, and Zathras brought her to Fandom. See my note on Zathras and the Great Machine <a href=""http://suzotchka.livejournal.com/18723.html"">here</a>. She was recalled a few times during the year to deal with crises back on the station and after graduation returned with the intent of resuming her position as captain. See the explanation of what happened with that <a href=""http://suzotchka.livejournal.com/18428.html"">here</a>. While at Fandom, Ivanova recovered enough from her hideous karmatic debt to fall in love with Tonks. After she left, Ivanova drank herself into a stupor for a week straight, had a regrettable one night stand with Blackadder, and sobered up. Comfort came in the form of Maia Rutledge, both of them missing Tonks, and an almost-fling with Pip Bernadette.</lj-cut>

And that's about it, really. A couple of small notes: Ivanova is thirty-one, but her body is physically around twenty-one. It's 2261 where she comes from."

Ivanova kicked the supposedly-easy-to-assemble wall unit that was looking decidedly less like a wall unit and more like a flatpack and some wooden pegs at the moment. With a growl she pushed the entire thing into a corner. She'd deal with it tomorrow.

Zathras cringed back under Ivanova's ire. ""Zathras cannot make Ivanova old again,"" he said very quickly and ducked behind Sheridan.

""I am going to <i>kill</i> you!"" Ivanova roared, lunging for Zathras. Not that thirty was <i>old</i>, but that wasn't the point.

John caught her swinging hands, staggering backwards a few steps as he tried to hold her. Zack jumped in, grabbing her around the waist and trying to drag her backwards as she threatened Zathras. Loudly. In new and interesting ways. Fandom seemed to have broadened her repetoire. She also kicked Zack in the knee rather viciously before Zathras waved his hands in surrender. 

""Zathras can explain! Zathras can explain if Ivanova not be killing him before have chance!""

Ivanova ceased her struggling, standing upright and levelling a look at Zack, who immediately released her and limped back respectfully. ""Alright, explain,"" she said in a chilly voice.

""Zathras cannot return Ivanova to age before she went away,"" Zathras said, poking out from around Sheridan. 

""You already said that. Now get to the actual explanation."" 

Zathras waved one hand rather vaguely. ""To make young is easy. Fixing. Lifting. Taking away. Old is much harder, to break and take away. Dangerous. There is reason humans be turning old slowly. Much, much safer.""

""So,"" Ivanova said levelly, ""You're saying that in order to be thirty again all I have to do is wait ten years?""

Zathras paused, checking his answer before nodded. ""Yes. Yes, that is what Zathras saying.""

""<i>I am going to kill you!</i>""

***

""Ivanova?""

""Fuck off.""

""Susan!""

""Frag, frak, fuck off.""

Sheridan sat next to Ivanova at the bar, deftly removing the glass of vodka from in front of her. ""You're too young to drink."" Ivanova gave him a flat look, grevious bodily harm lurking in her baby blues. He hurriedly replaced the glass and leaned away before continuing. ""It isn't the end of the world. So you look a little young.""

""I look eighteen, John. I'd get id-ed signing up for the Academy. No crew is going to respect a captain who looks barely out of diapers.""

""A little young,"" he repeated firmly. ""You and I both know you have the attitude to get any crew to follow you.""

""I think I should be offended at that,"" Ivanova put in dryly. 

""Maybe a little. If I didn't like all my parts still attached and in working order,"" Sheridan grinned. 

""A wise man.""

""Look, so maybe a strange EarthForce crew who hasn't been exposed to the . . . oddness of Babylon 5 might. But Corwin's been having to hold things down in CnC for a while, everyone here knows and likes you, and you can do all your browbeating over the comm. No visuals required.""

""You'll get me a transfer?"" she asked, glancing sideways at him. 

Sheridan nodded. ""I'm sure Captain Lochley won't have any problem with it. She still has seniority if the brass start making noises.""

""You're going to put Babylon 5 into the hands of two of the strongest-willed women in EarthForce?""

Sheridan blinked. ""Well . . . yes.""

""And you expect it to remain in one piece for how long, exactly?""

Sheridan chuckled. ""You'll do just fine.""

""We really have to cure you of that annoying habit of optimism you seem to have picked up somewhere.""

""You must be rubbing off on me.""

""<i>Now</i> you're just being insulting.""

Ivanova collapsed into bed, having watered Talia already. Her own quarters once again. A real shower, a big bed. She had even taken to wearing her old silk nightie, the blue one that she loved. She was doing a job that, despite cursing it up and down every chance she got, she loved. Her job. So why did she come home at the end of every day and fall into bed and feel so very . . . alone. She almost couldn't bear to take a shower any more without remembering warm skin against cool tile, hands that weren't her own covered in soap. She couldn't curl into bed but wake up expecting to find her fingers curled in silken hair. 

Mousey brown or blonde, the wisps changed sometimes. 

Corwin had stepped aside immediately for her. A few new personnel, sent by EarthForce to restore their numbers, had thought that they were the butt of some station-wide practical joke until Allen, Corwin, and Franklin all pulled them aside and warned them. She gave orders, her orders were followed. But still, something wasn't right. She felt eighteen now, like she was playing dress-up in some other woman's clothes. She wanted to be back in Fandom. So, not for the first time, she curled around a pillow and dreamed of pink silk and pale yellow cotton.

***

""You're not sleeping.""

""Do any of us?"" Ivanova shot back. 

""That wasn't a question,"" Franklin replied, giving her a stern look that carried all the weight and protection of being her doctor. Which meant no breaking him.

""I've been sleeping.""

""Don't lie to me, Susan.""

""I've been sleeping badly.""

Franklin just gave her that look again before sighing and setting the clipboard aside. ""Susan, look. I'm not your doctor right now, I'm your friend.""

""We're in a medlab examining bay and you're wearing a labcoat.""

""I'm your friend with some weird habits.""

""Alright, continue."" Ivanova's voice was testy. She didn't like where this was going.

Franklin dropped his voice so that they had a bit more privacy. ""Susan, you've been back for almost six months now. I've been watching you. You're hardly eating, your sleep patterns are erratic, you're working yourself to exhaustion, you drink every night. More than a little."" His eyes were compassionate, worried. ""Why?""

""I'm . . . not. Doing any of those things,"" Ivanova defended herself, rather lamely. 

""The last time you were like this was right after Talia . . . left,"" Franklin said slowly. ""Susan, what's going on? I'm here to help.""

Ivanova sighed. ""I know, Stephen, I know. It's just . . ."" She waved a hand around somewhat vaguely, encompassing the entire station in the gesture. ""I don't belong here any more. Not as I am. Not right now. I thought that I needed work to distract me, get me back into some kind of groove, but . . . it isn't working."" A bit of her usual dry tone came back as she added, 

""As you've noticed.""

""Maybe . . ."" Franklin murmured, leaning back a bit and tapping his chin. ""Maybe what you need is a bit of a walkabout. Clear your head. Meditate a little. Get off the station. Go see the universe, one tramp freighter at a time.""

Ivanova stared at him. 

Maybe she should. 

A walkabout. 

***

Zathras caught up with her on Proxima III. She was living in a run-down apartment over what passed for a coffee shop in this colony. She looked calm when she turned to greet him, her face smooth and unlined. She looked her young years. 

""Zathras want to help,"" he began. ""So Zathras go looking for place for Ivanova. Find safe place, good place."" He paused and shrugged. ""Good, yes. Safe-ish. Zathras is coming back to Babylon 5, not finding Ivanova. So Zathras is telling the One about his plan,"" this said with a tap against his forehead, ""And the One is arranging for this."" He handed her a folder, simple, embossed with the letterhead of the Interstellar Alliance. 

Ivanova opened it curiously, finding a brochure for Milieux Ecole and a letter. 

<i>Susan,

As President of the Interstellar Alliance, it is my pleasure to inform you that by unanimous decision, the Alliance has given you this. A new life. Everything's paid for. We just want you to be happy. 

John.</i>

Ivanova glanced up at Zathras. ""When do we leave?"""

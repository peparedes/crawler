"event","So this is my journel ...  i know its kinda plain but i donno how to fix it ... i will try to update as much as possible ... the most recent things that happened were 

Today- i woke up groomed then off to my bus stop where i was waiting for 40 minutes for it cause idk we had a diffrent bus driver and it made my hair horrible ughh ...i hated it and then i got too school and it was all good then at lunch me and jules went to the barnies thing and they diddnt make mocha freezers .. i was disappointed... natalie won presidant go her! and i am sad i diddnt make softball but that wont stop me from going out for fastpitch .. there is this couple that ALWAYS just strokes eachoth saying i am gonna miss you baby so me and jules started doing it and this guy took out his camera phone it was hysterical lol it was the best .. we diddnt let him take the picture though lol 

High school started I love my schedule and the only this that sucks is that its school ... I dont have any classes with jules so that kinda sucks but i see her a few times a day so its all good...  

I went to my first concert with jules sean danielle and bruce and it was awsome guys thanks so much i love you all ... 

I survived Hurricane Charlie but ANOTHER one is coming Francis and it sucks cause now we have more days to make up ... dont we already have enough...

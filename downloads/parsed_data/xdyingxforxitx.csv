"event","why am i so fucking vulnerable? ps this has NOTHING to do with what's going on right now in my life per-say, just, what's happened to me in the past:

the next person who upsets me, or lies to me, or plays games with me-is getting their fucking teeth knocked out of their mouth. you think i'm kidding?

seriously-and not to mention the fact that, i'm no child-and im not a fucking scene girl idiot-and i'm sincere and i mean everything i say with all my heart-so don't come near me, if you can't handle a woman...if you want a girl, go hang out at the high school. i'm fun, i'm extremely silly, and im one of the most affectionate and loving people you'll ever meet-but i'm also mature, and i don't do things or get involved with people unless i think of the actions or possible consequences that will follow...more people should do that.

i guess i just started thinking about my past relationships, and other people's relationships that i've witnessed...and honestly, most of them are or were a joke. just cheap thrills for a month, or even a few weeks-and then someone gets hurt. i guess i'm a believer in true love, or that relationships should mean something...sometimes i feel like i'm the only one.

nice girls finish last. hmm? fuck that haha. im pretty determined to prove that wrong."

"event","i am so fucking sick of people thinking their on the high and mighty road...when all they do is hold shit over people's heads, ridicule them, and then expect respect back?  what the fuck is wrong with people who claim to be so friendly and so fucking ethical that they'll sell out the people closest to them (or the people that SHOULD be the closest to them)...

i'll never understand most human beings, i'll never understand the human mind...and i'll never understand why people have to be so fucking selfish...

i am trying SO hard, and i realize my effort is WASTED.  if you don't want to fucking compromise, don't be my fucking friend."

"event","i refuse to write a love song, or devise some sort of fairy tale story-for all the times i have before, i've truly been dissapointed in the outcome.  instead, i'll live from day to day, from call to call, and hold my breath...because what you ""hear"" is not truly what you ""want"", and what they ""say"" isn't always truly what they ""mean""...

dissapointment and frustration, heartbreak and solitude-the human being is an idiot, because the human being keeps pressing forward.

and that's what makes the human being such a resillient thing.

i don't wait for signs anymore, or wish on shooting stars...but i do, never say never...

so..the ball is in your court now.  i'll wait, but certainly not forever."

2004-02-27 ~ 7:32 a.m. 

My past likes to haunt me...and every so often, it'll tap on my shoulder like the burden that it is-and ask me to repeat it. Many times I've given in, and faced the consequences. A older, wiser me-now refuses. 


And all the wishful thinking in the world couldn't turn you into something I could truly love.



Treat the good girl like gold, and she will be forever kind.


Teach the good girl your evil ways-and she will learn to turn them on you.


We create our own monsters."

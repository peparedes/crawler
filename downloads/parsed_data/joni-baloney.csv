"event","my day today was very productive..nothing really to complain about 

EXCEPT the fact that people make it hard to do a lot of activities with their bad attitudes. i have the energy people just need to stop bitching and listen so shit can get done. (sorry for the language and venting)

ANYWHO!!! so today i caught up on my sleep with the price of missing 6am practice (oo0ps) and being late to class (oo0ps again). i went to class. hung out at the letters on campus. won an otter pop race by being the fastest to rip them open and shove it down a guy's throat (for greek week). then i made a conscious effort to go to class (it was only a movie so i left...oo0ps again). went to eat at the hat (sooooo good). went back to my apt to rest for two seconds. then 909 class (look below). after that i went to greek 101 (for greek week again). then made my way over to the rec and saw some familiar faces and went to greek pyraid practice (our cheer/dance competition between all the greeks at ucr). we then took it outside until 2:30 ish. now im here.

yeah...busy busy busy me.

well the highlight of my day was our ""company class"" where 909ers and others who sign up for the class learn a dance for shits and giggles and to show off to their friends.

today kyle (one of our coreographers) taught us a tight ass piece to TRILOGY by KELIS.

here it is.

so basically it was my favorite class.

have a nice day.

it started off really busy. doing my thang with 909 and pi phi. new set, new leadership role.

lets start with the bad so i can end on a good note.

with pi phi, ive always loved it but then things got bumpy. i know i can handle it but it a whole lottah work. with date party cancelled and greek pyramid around the corner...lord knows how thats gunna turn out.

yeah...

and 909 is amazing. i never would have imagined being a part of such a large dance group that makes you feel so welcomed and good about yourself...and 909 has done that for me. 

here it is in a nutshell...

<u>lesson 1</u>: true love does really last a lifetime, but it evoles into differnt types of love that generate differnt feelings (this is why people think that they are not loved). i'm living proof that if love is pure and true between two people, whether they are together or just friends, love is all around.
<u>lesson 2</u>: don't even talk to people with crazy (ex)girlfriends. lol
<u>lesson 3</u>: stick to your passion. find some way to reconnect if you've lost touch. believe me it feel fufilling and is an outlet of all things negative.
<u>lesson 4</u>: don't rush into things."

but i've had a long time to think this break so far and i figured that i don't need to know what i want right now. i'm 19 years old and that is too young to know exactly who i wanna be with, what i want to do with my life, and most def too young to be stressing like i've been this past quarter. school and having fun is all i should be worrying about. 

im only young once why waste it? 

all of my life i've been putting eveyone else before me--spreading myself too thin--then wondering why i am the way i am.

that being said...i think i'm <b>addicted</b> to my laptop. i really do. i'm on aim constantly, myspace...i don't even wanna say how many times i check that thing, i'm on freindster again (only cuz of my cousin in the philppines and my cousin in sac), and i now i just remembered that i started a LJ. 

<u>QUICK UPDATE OF MY LIFE</u>:
i am still in pi beta phi. i am now in 909 hip hop dance troupe. i have met some down to earth people that i am greatful for. i am still <i>obsessed</i> with mac make-up. i lost a bit of weight. i am currently trying to learn tagalog. i have my own apartment in riverside now. and lastly i love my new hooka (name: ""off the"") <--you figure it out.

lately, i feel like i wanna be alone, but that makes me crave company even more. its like i can't make up my mind. i swear i'm so effin indecicive. maybe its a good thing that the new year is coming. new start. new opportunites. new things to learn. 

you know what i hate?? how i can never remember my new year resolutions when i go to evaluate myself at the end of the year. so this year i post it. that way i can get bitched out by people who read this if i don't comply with my resolutions, and i can refer back to this post at the end of the year lol. so here it is:

<u>NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS</u>:
-get fit (i can't feel uncomfortable showing my tummy lol)
-obtain and maintain a 3.0+ gpa the whole year
-make a memorable positive difference in each organization i am involed with
-be able to speak tagalog fluently
-go on a trip with some friends
-watch what i eat (meaning healthy, not literally)

...and for fun:

<b>JANUARY</b>:
-go snowboarding
-do something spontaneous and daring
-play ddr and break a sweat

oh another thing thats new in my life: my myspace pictures thanks to ian, allison and chris :)

i started the year with a brand new boyfriend that i love (to this day, now more than ever) loving senior year, dancing with ian, waiting for graduation. then graduation finally came, high school was over with. (i really will miss those days) i spent the summer doing all kinds of stuff prearing for my cotillion and the day i would have to say bye to my family and friends..and my baby. it was hard...way harder than i thought to be away from him. i started college...more parties than i was ussed to but made every one of them..met some tight ass people and have friends for life. joined a sorority..PI BETA PHI!! i love those girls dearly! pi phi for life!! then my cotillion quickly came by and it was the best birthday ever ever ever! i loved it so much and i will never forget it. it was all i imaginged and hoped it would be. the decorations were beautiful, every one looked sharp and sexy in the turquoise. haha! and i realized that i had the best best friend in the world. (thanx for everything lex) then i gave babe a puddin chest for his bday. it was so funny to see his face light up as his family was trying to figure out what it was. then the stress of first finals..which went better than i expected. now im here in the philippines celebrating my first christmas away from home and family and friends..(its over now..ill have next year) now im celebrating my new years with my mom, dad, sister, and a shit load of explosives (cuz thats all they do here on new years) i dont know itf ill have my hearing when i get back. back...to jakes arms at the airport. i cant wait! im hoing that ill start 2006 like i did last year...with him and happy.

"event","wow first christmas not at my lola's house. first christmas with out my parents and sister. first christmas where i was the only one opening gifts. first christmas where i saw 2 instead of 50 gifts exchanged.  first christmas where i played an active role in church. a lot of firsts...

i feel like a really bad person when i say this, but this is the first christmas (even first time ever) when i was fully attentive and prayed constatly at church. tonight i payed attention to every idea, eevry sentence, every word that was spoken in church. not one bit of day dreaming..nothing. i just prayed and listened..i must say...it feels good. i thought about everything, prayed that everything would turn out for the best, prayed that my family would have a safe trip, asked God to bless everyone in my life. no matter how big or how small someone has affected me (good or bad) i prayed for them. 

life goes by so fast that we never have time to reflect or see whats raelly going on until we have that quiet time. that significant point in our life that well always remember, where you just thought about your life and wherre it was going..

being here in the philippines has showed me how lucky i am to be so well off. i see whole families in the street sleeping on carboard and using a broken umbrella as theri roof. kids come up to me asking for money because thats all they can do. they sing and make noises just for one peso (like 2 cents). even my family..being well off here in the philippines..have no warm runnign water and no showers at all. all you have is a big bucket full of cold water and a cup to pour the water on your body. every street here looks like the ghetto. 

all some people have left is their families (if that) and God. so that makes me think..we shouldnt just see how lucky we are to have a better life, we should embrace it. embrace God. he is with everyone no matter the social status, color, race, gender, sexual orientation...he sees us as humans. one of his kind.

the priest said tonight in his homily..""God made him self human to be one with his people..not only by joining our humanity, but also raising us all up to his divinity.""

i gave all the loose change i had to the kids that came up to me...every time."

I dont know what to effin do. i swear this is all i think about during my free time. its soooo annoying but i want to figure it out. all this and no one in riverside for me... all i have are my pi phi girls, my roommmate, my hallmate, and a few great guys who are like my brothers. oh yeh not to mention i go to U.C. ugly guys for the most part. man o man...

sunday rolls around and we are hungry as fuck! so christina and i call up our friend fraser and we go out to ihop! mmm yummy! (side note: fraser's big toe is all fucked up cuz his roommate sirisak dropped his computer on it. so he can barely walk and has one slipper on. hahah!!) so we go to rite aid to pick up his prescription..then to radio shack to pick up printer cables. then to best buy to pick up an ethernet cable. we then go back to our dorm to set up everything. EUREKA! i have internet and can print things out!! haha! then we went to some presentations. then my family came by with a few essentials that we forgot and i said bye to them for the last time. then dinner. then spirit games. then back to the dorm to get ready for the party we were going to. then a mandatory town meeting. then we gather all the girls (E1W HONOR REBELS!) then we left for the party around 1045 er 11. i saw the same guys that were there the night before and a lot new people tooo...i heard someone say ""hey theres the girl that was breaking off everyone last night"" ahha i felt proud! it was really fun until i had 6 shots in 10 er 15 minutes. I WAS SOOOOO FUCKED UP. mayn i was throwing up so much i even had to go lie down in my friends car for the rest of the night...and it was just horribe. i had way too much to drink. yeh thats not happening again. i guess im glad that i got that out of my system now rather than later! haha! it sux tho cuz i was having this really great conversastion with this guy damian that i met the first night. but it was cute cuz he came to check up on me a lot...got me water and was trying to find me bread.. =) what a cutie pie!

You rank up there with your seduction skills, though you might not know it.
That's because you're a natural at seduction. You don't realize your power!
The root of your natural seduction power: your innocence and optimism.

You're the type of person who happily plays around and creates a unique little world.
Little do you know that your personal paradise is so appealing that it sucks people in.
You find joy in everything - so is it any surprise that people find joy in you?

You bring back the inner child in everyone you meet with your sincere and spontaneous ways.
Your childlike (but not childish) behavior also inspires others to care for you.
As a result, those who you befriend and date tend to be incredibly loyal to you.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>"

You fall in love quickly and easily. And very often.

In relationships, you tend to be a bit selfish.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>"

today...

last night for some reason my lap top internet was being hella fast..so i was on it til like 2 am..forgetting that i had to get up early the next day for my gramma and grandpas wedding anniversary mass thingy. so yeh i had like 5 hours of sleep. 

so mass in the morning then i watched my family eat breakfast at carrows cuz kat and i were gunna go out to breakfast a lil bit later.. so kat picked me up and we went to ihop. we went all the way down mission and couldnt find the one in hayward so we just ended up in union city. wow that was fun! i love being with her! we never fail to laugh! then we went to rasputins. 

then to my house where i waited for jerry to pick me up. little did we know that RESTEY was with him! mayn i havent seen that guy for ages! so we went to stoneridge and found out that there was no build-a-bear there...so we walked around and the strangest thing happened..THE POWER WENT OUT! yeh the power..from macys to the nordstroms side of the mall..so all the sores just closed. it was sooo weird. ive never seen that in my life. so yeh we met up kat and her friend in the parking lot and we just chilled for a quick minute. we then headed to walnut creek to go to the build-a-bear..where i built a bulid-a-bear! it was fun! omg that place is soooo effin cool!! i need to go back and get a new outfilt for my new ""daughbear"" (daughter/bear). i would post pictures but PHOTO BUCKET IS STUPID! i love her....MAKENZIE ROSE ESTRELLA. shes hella fitted too! wow its like a mini me on my good days! ahha! come see me to see her...er maybe ill put pix up on myspace. who knows. so yeh then we went to pizzaria sfo in jack london square to visit kat at work and eat some damn good food at a damn good discount! haha! ""you deserved the tip hunnie""

"event","so today i woke up to my sister. its was nice. minus the fact that i went to sleep only 6 hours prior to her lovely wake up call...""sleeping ate? wake up time now ate.""

so my mom my sister and i went to different places and bought more lil things for college. we got home from kelly paper, costco, anna linens, and economy asian market with such items as deodorant, spam, capri sun, bottled water, batteries, easy mac, chocolate milk, towels, and my favorite DINNER! 

as i was sitting at home..my favorite brother texted me! MATTMATT!!! he suggested we kick it (seeing how im leaving on thursday night). so since i had hella stuff to do for my cotillion (plus my moms errands) he graciously accompanied me. we went to drop off a cd to kat and we got a parking right in front of dina's studio (that hardly happens!). then the bank for my mom (where we found parking that was oober close). then to michaels to find some cardstock paper (and again parking right in front of the door)..i ended up finding hella cheap turquoise ribbon and a sillouette of a butterfly for free! (my sneaky ass traced it in the store!! haha!) then we didnt know what to do so we went to bed bath and beyond to look at dorm stuff (you guessed it...hella good ass parking). as soon as we walk in we see that theres a sale on hella nice ass comfortable soft pillows. it was like a cross between a squishy pillow and those pillows that you put your hand on it and the imprint of your hand stays for a lil. yeh that kind! it was only $6! mattmatt bought it for me! i guess its was a going away present! anywho i love it and im gunan sleep with it every night! haha! then we went to cold stones (this amazed me the most...you can never get parking right in front of cold stones on a-street..but yeh we did!! literally righ tin fron of the door.) we took a hella tight picture while we were waiting in line...mattmatt looked like a straight ghost! maybe my guardian angel!! ahha!see---->  <img src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y188/joni_balogna/DSC00068.jpg"" height=""200px"" width=""275px"">  then on top of the people who work at cold stones LOVE US! we both ordered a ""like it"" and  mattmatt got a ""got to have it"" and i got a ""love it"" for the price of 2 ""like it""s. it was wonderous! then we went home and he played with my sister as i had him approve a couple of things for my cotillion. it was more of him letting me know that it didnt look hella ugly and that i did a good job! so yay! then he had to go cuz he has school early tomorrow! but i had a lottah fun! so did jayna cuz after he left jayna said ""wer maah maah go? maah maahh wer are you?"" ahah me and me mom were hella laughing! thanx for everything mattmatt! i love you!! 

so after he left. i had to edit, crop and resize all 100+ pictures for the slide show for my cotillion. i thought it  was supposed to be a suprise for me..NOT ANYMORE! and it took FOREVER! i just finished a few minutes ago.

"event","so it hit me. my life is about to change in approx. a week and a half. 

i almost feel like im holding on to everything thats familiar to me by a rope. then everytime i lose the people that mean the most to me, the rope gets cut a little bit. jake left..the rope got cut. alex is gunna leave in a week. the rope is gunna be cut even more. the day i leave for college (22nd) im losing my friends and rest of my family. thats a huge cut. then as i move in im hanging on to one last strand. as soon as my parents and sister leave my dorm on the 24th...the rope is completely cut in two and im dropped in this whole new experience called college and independence. its scary...but i cant help but be excited!"

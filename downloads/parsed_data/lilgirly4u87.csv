"event","ok well i donno why but i decided i wanted my livejournal back,  so here it is.  well right now i am not with anyone and i'm not sure if i want to be at this moment.  everytime i start to like someone or get close to someone things always go wrong.  i really would like to meet a really cool guy that cares alot about me and all that stuff so everything was perfect but i dont see that happening too soon.  so i guess for right now i'm just going to concentrate on having fun and living my life.  i dont want to worry about the bad stuff or the things i want and cant have.  i am going to have fun!  so if you wanna hangout just call me!  anyways.......summer school sux because i have to get up every morning instead of sleeping in till like 2 o'clock haha.  o but i think i am going to bakersfield soon and that is goin to be super fun cuz i get to visit my cuzin and all his super cool friends haha.  ok well i'm hella bored now cuz i'm sittin here in summer school and supposed to be writing an essay but never got around to it so i guess i will write it tonight or tomorrow or something who cares.  anyways have a good day...byez!"

"event","well it has been a couple weeks and things are really about the same.  nothing has really changed except that Dan doesnt hate me and we can still hangout which is good because he is such a good person i would never want him to be out of my life.  hmm and the situation with mikey is that we arent really talking that much but he did call me the other day but it was kinda a weird conversation...but yeah we just arent really talking that much so i donno i ma just gonna let things be how they are supposed to.  i have decided that this live journal thing is kinda stupid so i wont be writing in it again so yeah this is my last entry...bye"

"event","ok well i am still drunk a little but this is how my day and night went...well today i took sean to lunch and that was fun...i happened to see my boyfriend at the time dan and i said hey and everything.  then i took sean home and i hungout with my friend dan for a while.  i happened to realize that i was still in love with my ex...mikey.  i dont nkow what it is or how it is i just know that i miss everything about him.  and it hurts even more when i see him!  i hate it because then i cant get over him!  yeah so then we are at this party at kelsey's hosue and mikey and dan are there and they are both not talking to me...then finally dan talks to me but it is only to break up with me so that wasnt very fun so that made me cry more...then i went and found roach cuz he was my DD for that night.  he took me home and the whole time i was pooring my guts and crying...i feel sorry for him.so now i come home and jenny spargo is outside with some people so i start teling her the story and i'm driunk and shes not so shes probably laughing at me..so then i come home stil crying and talk to some people like my two cuzins eddie and justin and sean and kelsey and i juust feel sadder every minute and i seriously wonder what is so kool about life anyways because i fucking hate it!  the worst part is that no matter how much i love him i know he doesnt want anything to do with me so thats my tragic story and i hate this world now!"

I am only a sophmore in high school but it scares me to think that i will be out on my own, making my own money, handling my own finances, holding my own job, waking myself up in the morning...doing all this in only two years. i don't know that i am ready. there are soo many things that i can get involved that would prevent me from being a productive human being and turning me into nothing but a pimple on the ass of society. i can't stand people like that and i am soo fucking scared that i am responsable for my life not turning into that. i hope i can make it. i am sure i am...i have a plan for after high school i just hope i can make it. is it normal to have these doubts? two years used to seem like a long time...now i just hopes its enough to learn everything i need to.  i don't know maybe i am just a worry wort but who knows...."

"event","Take a breath. can you feel it? can you taste it? can you smell it? this moment is forever, forever holding you in its arms. forever forbading you to leave its grasp. this moment is the rest of your life, never will you be able to free your self. How does it feel to be a prisoner of your own making? With every breath you take your heart longs to be free but the chains you have put around it weigh it down. beating slower and slower the blood running thicker and thicker, your lungs they tighten tighten tighten...breath is now only a word you wish you had. just as life is after your gone. you may want it gone but in all reality you want it to stay. death"

"event","Have you ever wished that your life could be wiped clean. That every mistake, every embarrasing moment, every foul word said, every evil gesture made, every moment of chaos would simply disapear. Have you ever wished that what you have made your life to be wasn't really to be at all. have you ever had that feeling in the pit of your stomach that says, this isn't right, this isn't you, that you are wrong. but then your mind interupts and says you may feel that way but you can't turn back. you can't wind the clock of life back. it is forever as you have made it. it is forever a mistake burned into your memory of life. every depressing moment is there to remind you that you are as fragile as a china plate or crystal glass, that you will faulter again, you will feel like plumeting off that edge that we call life. that you will just take one more step too far in the wrong direction, that you will come to a dead end. that it will end. gone."

"event","Hey yall, if you don't mind i would really like to ramble on about some topics that i find amusing, or topics that really piss me off! 
        I was watching 60min2 (i know) and it was about teens killing people and commiting crimes just for the hell of it. One topic was Colombine...as if we all havn't heard enough about it i want to add my final two cents in...Colombine was a tragedy but it was a major break through...it was needed in order for people to open their eyes and ears to the problems that ""out kasts"" face day in and day out. No one can understand the psycological torment that these so called Out Kasts face. Untill a person that is ""normal"" lives in a persons shoes that is different, they really cannot not have an unbiased opinion. Parents and teachers and officials ask why did you tell someone this was going on..the imple fact is...that NO ONE wanted to listen. i myself have gone to the principal and told him these people (i gave names) are pissing me off because they are persecuting me becasue of my Homosexuallity. and what did he do? NOTHING! essentially nothing. those people are still doing it and untill they are TIED TO A GOD DAMN BARBED WIRE FENCE AND TORTURED AND BEATEN TO DEATH THEY WILL NOT KNOW WHAT DAILY SUGGERAGE AND PERSECUTION IS!!!!! if you want to quiet a conversation all you need to do is say the name Mathew Shepard! there is somthing there that people are affraid to touch. no one likes to talk about. i praise NBC or ABC which ever station had that Mathew Shepard story on...and HBO for The Laramie Project...i praise them for speaking out against what is wrong. i Don't understand why people cannot see that this is the life style that we are GIVEN! we do not choose this! if you honestly think that we are going to pic a life of persecution, hatred, judgment and eternal damnation you ARE DEAD WRONG!!! who on earth in their right mind would choose that! we are given it and we deal with it or we kill ourselves! More queers die of thier own will to be happy. They feel that they cannot carry out that will here because of the persecution that YOU bestow apon them! When you ask a dumb question like: HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE GAY...thats retarded how DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE STR8? answer your own questions. and please don't discriminate, not only agains gays but against blacks, whites, asians, africans, russians, women, men, lesbians---Simply DON'T DISCRIMINATE! if you don't like it then LOOK THE OTHER FUCKING WAY! no one is forcing you to look at it! and no one is forcing you to speak you OPINION! notice OPINION in big lettering...THAT IS ALL AN OPINION IS! IT IS SIMPLY THE THOUGHT OF ONE PERSON WHO REALLY DOESN'T MATTER! ---thank you."

Another one of my best friends alerted me of the news at about 3:45 Am on July 29th year 2002. My innitial reaction was Shock. My mind was transported to a place of slow motion. Like everything stood still. My body would move in real time as my mind veiwed everything in slow motion. My mouth seems not to be able to close. I am in awe that her injuries, I am in shock that it was only a few months ago that i was attending this brilliant, funny, exuberant womans graduation, a time in her life when she must have felt such an emmece feeling of succesion. Like she was done like she had closed a chapter in her life and new one was just beggining with many promises of a bright future. She was and still is an amazing person i can't beleive this happend.
     Chrissy and her boyfriend Joey were on thier way hom from Johnsons Shutins when they lost control of the car and ran off the road flipping and finally hitting a tree. She sustained MANY wounds. Such wounds would include, a broken back in three places. Her pelvis, hip and leg bones were all broken. She also suffered a head injury. She is now recouperating at St.Johns Mercy in St.louis. She is in a coma and is on a respirator. 
         When something as profound and harmful such as this happens to a person you love the world seems to stand still. I do love her and hope she fully recovers. I will love and support her through this and help her in any way that i can. I hope that God has seen this and is holding her hand as we speak. I can't imagine what she felt as she flew through the air only to come to a stop at a tree. I can't imagine what she is thinking what she is seeing and what she is feeling at this very moment. Life really is amazing it throws so many things at you. I have the utmost confidence that God will prevail and see her through this Trauma. She WILL be revived to that once vivasious indivual Chrissy Hampton."

"event","jessica...you wanted to know why i don't keep this journal anymore...well its because all it does is stir up shit because people don't know how to keep thier stupid ass comments to themselves...no one can preasume to tell me what i can and cannot write because they have not then slightest clue what it is like to be me. i have been accused many many times of simply using this devise to bitch and complain. well...in my journal i am thinking of ONLY me. becuase no one else has any business in being apart of some thing that is as sacred as a journal. a journal should be very close to you some thing that comes from your heart. not some fabricated superficial bullshit! well thats my two cents. bye"

"event","i realise that his has been a long time since my last entry and for that i am sorry, i have really been trying to distance my self from the est of the world-a mini vacation if you will. this entry i wish no responses and it is really simply a way for me to get things out of my system that i really don't want to keep hidden away. you may read this and take it as you will...
   i am 15 years old, hardly seems fair i never really felt i had a childhood it was kind of just a blur, i really don't understand why i am here now or what i am suppose to do or how long i will live or were i will go when i die but i do know that i am drowning in my sorrows in my life both emotionaly and physically, i feel the pit of my stomach lurching at times that i am not hungry... i know what it is...its fear, fear of not knowing, not knowing what is to come or what was or what is. i just feel my life slipping away from me. if a friend is talking to me i may be looking into thier eyes and nodding appeasingly or sounding the typical uhuh...but inside my brain is fast thinking of things that will get me no were...its like running on a treadmill a treadmill that goes slower and slower and slower until the inevidable stop. when i look into a persons eye i am trying to find somthing that can help me within my own life but never find it all i see is their wanting and yearning for attention and somone to understand them and i, to them, am that person, that understanding...little do they know that i cannnot understand them for i do not understand my self. my mother has brought this new ""companion"" if you will, into our lives...my everyday life. i life already so chaotic and out of controll that the tiniest thing could set me off...this new ""companion"" has things that they are used to...things they do in thier own life that make them feel secure, and those things make me feel so incredubly unsecure! my mother expects me to accept this new lifestyle of hers when i have barely come to terms with my own life altering decision...i don't think thats fair at all but them again...i am but 15 and know not what is fair. my father...that is a different story all together. i would so much love to forgive him and be embraced in his arms again but everytime i see his face or hear his voice i see all those nights when i would get up to go to the bathroom and i could hear my mother sobbing through the walls...i see all those tear soaked tissues and i see her tear stained face, to see those things makes my heart shadder into a thousand peices. so to look at my father or even talk to him is too much of an effort too much of a reminder a reminder that my mother was hurt and that our lives were turned upside down! but oh how long to talk to my father about my life about the weather about cars and my friends and my boyfriends but honestly it is too much of an effort, maybe that is just lazieness on my part or maybe its actuazation that my father is a bad man and i do deserve better. i don't know what it is. i search for that answer every day and never find it. all i uncover are more problems, problems with the world, with my friends, with my relationships, with my self. i need some absolution if it be just a little i need some. i need to feel like i can breath again like i can run into my fathers arms like i was little child i need to feel like i can look at each new day with excitment and anticipation not worry, guilt, fear and genralized dread! i can safely say that if i asked my self what i have to wake up to tomarrow i could say that there is not one thing that i would miss if i never woke up. and i think that is a sad thing when you honestly feel that the world has nothing to offer, that the world is just a place or liveout or miserable, mundane existances. its a sad thing. i am 15 years old, what will happen."

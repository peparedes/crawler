"event","<p>Lately I've been obsessing over this new K-pop girl group called ""So Nyuh Shi Dae"" (Girls' Generation or SNSD).. Their songs are just waay to catchy for me plus they perform really well live. lol, I'm also in love with their lead singer ""TaeYeon"" *points to Userpic*. Her voice is just sooo angelic, she reminds me of BoA back in her earlier days, and she's so damn cute XD. </p>"

"event","<lj-embed id=""1"" /><br /><br />Melodies of Life (from FFIX)
sung by Emiko Shiratori

Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark
For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart
To weave by picking up the pieces that remain
Melodies of life--love's lost refrain

Our paths they did cross, though I cannot say just why
We met, we laughed, we held on fast, and then we said goodbye
And who'll hear the echoes of stories never told?
Let them ring out loud till they unfold
In my dearest memories, I see you reaching out to me
Though you're gone, I still believe that you can call out my name

* A voice from the past, joining yours and mine
Adding up the layers of harmony
And so it goes, on and on
Melodies of life,
To the sky beyond the flying birds--forever and beyond

So far and away, see the bird as it flies by 
Gliding through the shadows of the clouds up in the sky 
I've laid my memories and dreams upon those wings 
Leave them now and see what tomorrow brings

In your dearest memories, do you remember loving me?
Was it fate that brought us close and now leaves me behind?

* Repeat

If I should leave this lonely world behind
Your voice will still remember our melody
Now I know we'll carry on
Melodies of life
Come circle round and grow deep in our hearts
As long as we remember

________

Recently I've been singing this song a lot lol. (Wow, me actually singing by myself again haha). I could just feel the words i guess..

oh yea, i might get hired at the Newpark mall Gamestop!!! :)"

"event","I've come up with a new determination&nbsp;for loving Traci. Even though she is taken, I will always be there for her no matter what. I've been thinking last night and started regretting one thing about my past friendship with my ex-best friend Adam. I think that...not only did he disappoint me, but I abandoned him to fast.. I won't let that happen with me and Traci. I care for her a whole lot.. Even if situations change that she stops being my friend, I will still be there for her.. Cause... this is my yakusoku (promise) to her.<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/1888/traciandgerald2dc2.jpg"" /><br /><br />Do you... have someone who is precious to you?&nbsp; When a person has something precious to care for... that's when they can become truly strong. ~ Me (modded from Haku's original lines lol)<br />"

I'm willing to&nbsp;make great sacrifices.. <br />then I got a nice long FFVIII hug lol.<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img82.imageshack.us/img82/3576/242pxfinalfantasyviiilouo3.jpg"" /><br />Afterwards, we walked around the mall and vented to each other.

Without her, I would have prolly gone crazy with all this drama crap that's been happenin.&nbsp;<br />Later, CPC 1st Concert ---&gt; Success!<br />end..<br /><br />PS:&nbsp; I'm holding on to my word, I won't be a jerk that's trying to take her away from her bf. I just wanna be a good friend who will be there for her. ^^"

"event","I went on a date with Traci <3 today... 
probably the best one-on-one time i shared with a girl.
we ate at Fantasia and I introduced her to my sister, Mahal.
talked about our problems in life and learned more about each other.
afterwards we walk around the mall and bought Wii controllers lol..
before she left for work, we had a nice hug heh.
today was definitely one of the best days of this year.
best part, she wants to go out again :).

PS: i had a tough decision to make. I had to decide if the date should be a few (2) hours or a couple (3 or more) hours lol. I think Christian knows what I picked haha."

"event","i'm really sick of all this drama that's been happenin with people i care about. for the past 2-3 weeks, these incidents have been tormentin me and messin with my studies.  
well tonight, i feel that i was actually able to do somethin instead of kinda bein the useless person in our group. me and my best friend had a discussion while we were drivin back to my place. i told him how i've been feelin about this whole situation and gave him the advice that i've been tellin everyone else. i'm glad that he listened to me and that he knows that i'll always be the good friend stickin by his side.
that's my promise.
yakusoku..

on another note,
about my previous entries.

yes it's true. i am fallin in love with a girl that's already taken, but i won't be a jerk and try to separate her from her love. i just really enjoy bein' her friend and hangin around with her. i can't wait to see her and the rest of the new group of friends i hang out with. 

ps: i really loved the hug she gave me after i walked her to her car ^_^.

-------------------------------

the new group of ppl I hang with (sorta)

Peralta - He has started the group by inviting us over to his new apartment to play DS and video games.

Traci - The girl I've been pretty obsessed with (see my previous paragraph and entries). She's got a DS, PSP, PS2, and GCN (I think). Definitely the most hardcore female gamer I've met. I've volunteered to walk her to her car when she goes home lol

Pope - Well, nothin really new bout him lol. He's still one of my good friends. ^^"

I know its country but holy hell the people are SO MUCH more talented. Instead of always just choosing other peoples songs to sing, they have one show where they write their own song and perform it.

<P>We had slop last night. Mom really does not enjoy me calling it that. She prefers Dad calling it goo. But, I'm right in calling it slop. Its basically shephards pie...mashed potatoes, green beans, peas, tomatoes, corn, hamb. meat all thrown together and it looks like slop that you would feed a pig, but its really good. </P>

Went shopping for clothes for when I go out to Denver in two weeks. Word to the wise. Just because you see the cutest looking outfit and you want it really bad, check the price. I went into The Buckle and on a manaquin they had this Lucky hooded sweatshirt with an undershirt, a scarf and beanie and I was like I gotta have it...went to the checkout counter with that outfit a watch and perfume and dead serious about had a heart attack  when they told me the price. I dont think I will divulge how much it was because well, it was really bad. But I've got. 4 pairs of pants which all have to be sent to me because 2 of them are to long so they are being hemmed and the other 2 have to be sent from another store cause they didnt have my size. I also got some PJs and sweatpant type bottoms with a hoody and two pairs of the worlds softest socks. Next week we have to go again cuz I still need to get: two pairs of shoes (sneakers and dress-y type shoots--thats shoes and boots together, best of both worlds, a coat and some more long sleeve shirts/sweatshirts that arent from The Buckle :)

I went to take a shower after I got off work tonight and as I'm pulling back the curtain to turn it on, a gigantic spider runs into the middle of the tub. I jumped like 100ft in the air and 50ft backwards dude. It was so big that when I turned on the faucet to send it down the drain, it fucking scrambled (quite successfully I might add) away from the drain. But I got the big bastard by throwing water from a cup at it at the same time. So, in the end he lost. HAHAHA!!! ::shivers:: I hate spiders. </P>"

"event","My dad and stepmom came out to see me over the weekend. It was pretty fun. We stayed at the boat Fri., Sat., and Sun. night. I wasnt all to excited about it bc when they told me what we were doing I wasnt so enthused. We went down to Missouri Saturday to see my dads best friend. I remember we used to visit him and his wife alot when I was little but I hadnt seen them in 10 or so years. (Except for Spencer, I saw him at the wedding over Summer for a few days, but I never really talked to him. So I figured I'd be all left out and bored but it turned out to be pretty fun. However, I have decided that I DO NOT do horses. They are scary creatures. Tammy was shaving the horses legs and it went to bat at a fly and kicked her head, she had to get 6 stitches. Let me tell you, I stayed far away from them :) And then on Sunday we went up to Cedar Rapids to visit Kelli's sister that I barely know, so again, I figured I'd be left out, but that too was really fun. AND, I know all of them better so I no longer have to be awkward or mute around them like I was at the wedding :) All in all, good times were had.
When I was coming back home Mon. morning Lindsey and Briar were outside, and as I pull up Lindsey comes running up to the truck with a puppy in her arms. I wasnt going to get all excited bc I knew that my parents didnt want a dog since our landlord wont let it be inside, so I figured we were watching it for someone. But, ITS OURS BABY!!!!! She's so frickin cute! Her name is Reggie (my mom chose it) after Reggie White from the Packers. Apparently they tried to call me over the weekend to ask my input on the name, but my phone was turned off. The two names they were thinking of were Reggie and Sheba. I woulda said Reggie. Oh, its a German Shephard of course :) But a complete pain in the ass. She HATES to be outside alone so she whines and barks and it sounds like shes dying. She needs to get trained and fast.
I'm getting my glasses today ::does happy dance:: I havent had glasses in forever. They were like 265 bucks, but with my insurance its 91. I lurve insurance."

Hit a wall going 50 mph. He hydroplained or something like that. He's alright, sore, but alright. His truck is destroyed though. He's waiting for the insurance company to do the estimate. They dont even know whether the trucks fix-able or not. Figures. He has really bad luck.

And then tonight, I was standing beside the steam table throwing leftover peas and corn nowhere in particular when Kathleen (the lead buffet cook) walks up and stands like 3 feet behind me puting food onto speedracks when I decided to be annoying and throw a pea at her over my shoulder without looking. Well, she starts to kinda sorta freak, by saying OH my GOD over and over. So, finally I turn around and she points to her ear. I threw the freakin pea in her ear!!!!!!!! It was hilarious.

"event","So, I didnt have some big shindig or anything but yesterday was pretty much perfect. We had ice cream cake at about noon because my dad had to leave to go work up in Minnesota (he started with a new company that is based up there and since they arent starting to work in WDM for a few weeks, he has to get work somehow so he goes up to Minn for the week, comes back for the weekend and then leaves again. I think this is going to go on for at least a few weeks). Then, we pretty much just chilled until it was time to go to dinner. We were going to go to Osceolas ""fancy"" restaraunt called Crossroads but we found out that they were closed Sunday nights, so instead I decided to go and eat at Pizza Hut, c'mon its friggin pizza baby!!! And then we rented some movies. It was my kind of thing. Be with my family and of course movies :) So, all in all, it was a good day. 
Then, today we went up to WDM and I got my own cell phone plan and new phone. I'm happy. I had to put a $400 down payment on it because I have no credit, plus the 100 some odd dollars for my phone + the plan, so it came out to like $537 and I had $535 in cash with me. But once I have this plan and pay on time for a full year I get the 400 back. My mom only thought that I had maybe 100 bucks because I now have a checking account and she thought all my money was in there. So when she found out that I had all that money she was like hell, go for it!! So I did. :)

The most exciting thing about friday was when we told carlos that julio was gay and since carlos is gay he thought he was going to get some that night...lol. but the funny thing is that julio isnt gay lol soo that whole night julio would not come in the house b/c he was scared that carlos would make a move on him...lol. But julio got all pissed off so we told carlos the truth... it was hilarious... After everone had left it was gaby and i sleeping over zulee's house since we all had cheerleading the next day... over all it was a fun night.

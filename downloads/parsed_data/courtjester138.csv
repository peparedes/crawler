Right now the girls are out of school for summer vacation and I am full-time caregiver to a 10 month old baby. My biggest challenge with this is that my girls always wanna go do something; hit the zoo, the science center, a park, go swimming, etc.  And really, who can blame them? No one wants to be stuck at home all summer long.  The hardest part is trying to balance keeping them happy and making sure the baby is well cared for and happy as well.  

My sister, her husband, her teenage daughter, and her 6 year old will be here for a week later this month.  that will surely add an interesting dynamic to the whole thing.  I'm hoping it will make things a bit easier, at least as far as entertaining the girls is concerned.  

Well, her parents are coming over in a bit and I still have a little house work to do, cuz that is my life now."

"event","The baby was born a bit ago (27 days ago).  His name is Thomas Joseph and he was born the day after my birthday.  The past month has been pretty much all about him.  Every time I think we're settling into a routine, he goes and changes things up.  Right now, for example, he's going through some growth spurts and is cluster feeding a lot.  That keeps us up at night more.  I'm tired all the time these days.  I love him, but I wish I could go hang out with a friend or something.  That's another thing.  I get very little free time, and when I do that boy won't even answer his phone.  That gets annoying a bit.  He's been acting a lot strange lately.  I wish he'd tell me what's up.  

I guess that is all I can think of right now.  I'd say that I'll be better about not taking so long to post in the future, but I have said that before and I still tend to forget.  I'll try, but I make no guarantees."

It is a boy, as the ultra sound has shown us twice.  We still don't have a name for him yet.  After summer, life will change a lot.  I'll have a baby to care for, on my own a lot of the time.  Emily will be starting school.  That'll be strange.  It's been pretty much her and I for the past 4 1/2 years.  I'll miss her a bit, but I know she'll love Kindergarten.  I've got just a few weeks to clean out the baby's room and set up his furniture, before Melissa goes crazy.  That means cleaning out the shed, too, to make room for my drum set, which I'll never get to play again apparently.  Jon and I are still friends, but he doesn't call much since he started his new job, so that kinda sucks.  My car is broken down and Jon's dad's car is broken, so he uses Jon's car.  This all adds up to we don't hang out that often either.  AC is broken right now for me, too.  And it is very warm outside.  Could be a lot hotter, though, so I hope we get it figured out before those hotter temps arrive.  So that is all that I can think of right now.  Later."

Work:  I don't know.  Jon told me a couple weeks ago it was pretty much over.  Now the place seems to be hanging in there, for now.  I'm thinking seriously about quitting, though.  Not because of pay or anything, not even really because of the place (except I'm tired of the hoodlums that frequent the place).  More because I think it's ruining Jon and I's friendship.  We never even talk anymore, let alone hang out.  Except at work, and I'm sorry, but that just doesn't count.  Could backfire, though.  Could make matter worse, me quitting.  I mean I'd give him the necessary notice.  Whatever, I don't know.  

School:  Got tough there in the middle of my two current courses.  Only got 2 more weeks in them, though.  I plan to make it through.  Although lately, I don't see the point.

Personal:  I've taken the attitude as of late of...f**k it.  I just don't give a s**t anymore.  I care about my kids and the people in my life (as few as there are) but for all else, f**k it.  

oh, an my Xbox is broken.  I sent it off for repairs.  Jon let me borrow his a week ago.  I'm giving it back to him tomorrow though.  Not because mine is back, but because, well...f**k it."

I feel like my working there is doing him more harm then good.  He'd never admit to that, but I feel like he's having troubles paying me AND making the bills.  I gotta have a job, though.  And I think he needs another employee other then himself.  So I guess we'll just see how it goes.

School:  I'm in school now, that's why the part-time job.  It's going pretty good.  I just finished my first two courses and got A's in them.  Just started my second two.  

Home:  We just got some bad news from the mortgage company.  The good thing is, we fight only occasionally now.  It's still about money mostly.  

Kids:  They are doing fine.  I look after the 3 year old all day; another reason for the part-time work.  The older one is doing good in school. 

Personal:  I been saving up for Guitar Hero World Tour, but now that I just got that news from the mortgage company, I'm going to have to use the GHWT money for that problem.  Guns N Roses have a new album.  There are a couple of good part of it, but it's not that great.  I still jam to Death Magnetic every chance I get.  I love it more and more each time.

Work:  Still waiting on a driver position to open.  I've been told I'm ""on a very short list"" for getting my own route.  Hope it happens soon, or this family is gonna hit ROCK bottom...and soon.

Home:  Melissa and I have been at it lately.  Money issues, ya know.  Especially a little matter of I was pulled over for expired tags (which I had been fighting her about for some time now) and didn't have current insurance (another thing I'd been fighting her on).  Now I gotta have insurance straight through for 2 years or Im in big trouble.  I just got a letter saying they canceled ours because of lack of payment.  I guess she doesn't care what happens to me.  If I go to jail because of her when I've done nothing wrong, that'll be the straw to break the camel's back, ya know what I mean?

Kids: They are fine.  One is in 1st grade and the other is in day care (which is why we are very close to rock bottom). 

Personal: I been listening to Metallica's new album A LOT.  It kicks so much ass.  I am so happy, too, because the last 3 they had were not so good.  This one is amazing, though.  Some people are bashing it without even listening to it just because of they're last to flops.  They'll come around, though.  I'm sure.  It's number one on the charts now, that's cool.  I knew they could still make awesome, kick ass music.  They were just in a bad place.  That's all behind them now, and it's time to kick ass again.

That's all I got for now.  Later."

"event","Metallica is out with a new CD, Death Magnetic.  I got it last week and have been listing to it like crazy.  I really am please with it.  In a way I haven't been please with a Metallica release since The Black Album.  Here is a breakdown of how I feel about the new CD.

1. That was Just Your Life: Probably my favorite track of this release. A fun, exhilarating blast of energy to kick off their new disc. I knew half way through this song, this CD was special. 10 of 10.

2. The End of the Line: I didn't like the opening riff but it kinda gets catchy after that. Not my favorite on the CD but it's not all bad. 7 of 10.

3. Broken, Beat & Scarred: Again, another catchy tune. I liked the lyrics and the driving force of the rhythm guitar. 7 of 10.

4. The Day That Never Comes: At first I didn't care for the beginning of this one, and was blown away by the middle on through the solo. Upon further listening, though, I've come to understand it more and appreciate it much more. All in all a great tune with Metallica's signature build up from a slow beginning to a fast and furious mid section. An awesome solo at the peak of the fury ties it all in to make for one of the better Metallica songs since Sad But True. 9 of 10.

5. All Nightmare Long: Really like this song, too. The ""twang"" in the intro is a little annoying but it quickly picks up. The drums in this one (epically in the beginning) are nice. Lyrics are great. I don't like the ""Luck Runs Out"" thing but the rest are pretty solid. The Solo has some great elements even if it can be erratic at times. Still bad ass. The guitar gets freaking' awesome near the end. 8 of 10.

6. Cyanide: I don't have much to say about this one...probably my second least favorite on this CD. But even it (and my least favorite which is coming up) has some really good parts. 7.5 of 10.

7. The Unforgiven III: I literally rolled my eyes and cringed when I learned there was going to be another ""Unforgiven"". My first reaction, however, was not justified. It is by far the best of the 3. I don't even want to talk about the second one, what the hell was that? And the first one was okay. This one is really good though. Great beat, great lyrics, great solo, great rhythm, great drums. Proof again that they don't always have to play as fast as possible to be great. It was worth listening to the other 2 ""Unforgiven""s to get to this one. 

8. The Judas Kiss: Least favorite of the album...that being said it's still great and it's still better then half the songs on the Load Reload pair. I'll just leave it there, lol. I did like the rhythm guitar during the chorus. 7 of 10

9. Suicide and Redemption: Finally, a good old fashioned Metallica instrumental. Thank you, Metallica. I missed these. Just great fun from beginning to end. Good Times. 8 of 10.

10. My Apocalypse: Second favorite on the CD. Reminds me of ""Damage Inc."". A perfect end to the CD in the same respect that ""Damage Inc."" and ""Dyers Eve"" were in that it leaves me feeling blown away. And makes me want to start the disc over. Which I usually do. And I start the beautiful journey all over again. 10 of 10.

Over all. Best album since TBA (maybe even better, there's just that ""can't compete with memories"" thing that makes TBA stand out. Whole album, 9.3 of 10. Thank you Metallica. Please play a concert near Louisville, so I can see you live again."

I plan to go to the immediate care center in a few.  Anyway I only got a couple house of sleep last night because of it and I spent the morning sleeping.  In that sleep I dreamed a strange dream.  In this dream I was a scientist of some sort.  An astronomer I believe.  In doing my work my team and I discovered a large asteroid on a path to Earth.  It was actually a binary unit.  There were two asteroids circling eachother.  It was, we knew, a ""kill-shot"".  In other words it was destined to end life on earth.  We all resigned ourselves to the fact that this was the end.  However, just before the impact I saw a vision that if I found just the right spot on earth I would enter a sort of vortex that would protect me.  I quickly gathered my family into a car and headed for a spot the same vision showed me.  I tried to get as many people as I could to join us.  Unfortunatly only a handfull of people would listen.  We made it to the spot just as the impact occured.  We did escape the danger.  Really the only thing we did was pass through it.  The results were immedate.  On the other side we found a world void of all human life.  Thats about were the dream ended.  I just thought it was strange and wanted to put in down so I wouldn't forget."

He then started getting letters from a former employee telling him he got the boot due to a conspiracy by someone who wished for his supervisor posistion.  After all that hit the fan I thought I was gonna get canned too cuz of my close friendship with Jon.  Then I talked to another supervisor there, David, and felt better.  Felt I hadn't been implicated.  Then My name was brought up again.  Then it was fixed.  I don't know.  I wish they hadn't fired Jon but her got a better job and is happier now anyway.  I don't really want to get fired other this shit cuz I got tiny mouths to feed.

At work my bosses are hiding things to see if I'll find them.&nbsp; For example they hid some bananas.&nbsp; yes bananas.&nbsp; And told me they were out there somewhere.&nbsp; I don't need that shit.&nbsp; I got enough to worry about without having to be tricked into screwing up at work.&nbsp; It's like they're making me parenoid.&nbsp; That's like psycological control or something.&nbsp; To hell with that.&nbsp; I don't need that shit.&nbsp; Espically for what they pay me.&nbsp;

Monday, all Hispanic, Latino, Mexican immigrants are having a boycott.&nbsp; None of them are supposed to work.&nbsp; Or buy anything.&nbsp; To teach us a lesson that they are so dire to our society.&nbsp; It's all in response to all the new proposals about making it so illegal immigrants are to be considered actual ""criminals"" hence forth and that a fence be erected along the boarder to keep them out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's how I feel about the so called boycott:

1. The illegal immigrants will be joined by LEGAL immigrants who support there ""illegal brothers"".&nbsp; Therefore the boycott is null and void because it wont be showing us what we'd be missing by having no ""Illegal Immagrants"".&nbsp; Cuz the LEGAL ones are doin' it too, see?
2.&nbsp; If your a guest you don't go ramming things down your hosts throat and acting all foolish about it.&nbsp; Especially if your an uninvited guest.&nbsp; Let's say you have people over and one guy you don't even know and didn't invite comes crashing in.&nbsp; You tell him to leave.&nbsp; All the sudden he's all like, ""Hey, that aint right.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; Im not drinking any of your beer.""&nbsp; A bit audacious of him, don't you think?
3.&nbsp; Sure, they won't be buying selling or working.&nbsp; But I bet they'll still be collecting they're government benifets.&nbsp; Let's see them not get those for a day.&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll all even out.&nbsp; 

Now don't get me wrong.&nbsp; Im all for LEGAL immagrants.&nbsp; That's what this country is about.&nbsp; But you gotta do it the right way.&nbsp; That's just all there is too it.&nbsp; It's hard for the others to come in here when the go about it the correct way.&nbsp; They've earned there stripes one could say.&nbsp; That's great.&nbsp; Good for them.&nbsp; Welcome.&nbsp; But just do it RIGHT.&nbsp; If you break ANY law, your breaking the law.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; Oh and I DO NOT like them redoing the National Anthem in spanish.&nbsp; That's just plain not right.&nbsp; Integrate or evacuate.&nbsp; Like I said don't get me wrong.&nbsp; I am all for immagration.&nbsp; But this changing our song and boycotting crap has got to go.&nbsp; Or else they do.&nbsp;"

"event","It has been far to long since I have used this journal.&nbsp; I don't why I felt compelled to renew my interest now but it seems I have.&nbsp; No matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

To bring you up to date.&nbsp; My youngest child is 8 months old today.&nbsp; She is able to pull her self to a sitting posistion from a laying posistion and she rocks back and forth in preperation for the next milestone in her life; crawling.&nbsp; She actually scoots herself forward in a ""near-crawl"" manner, however she has yet to actually crawl.&nbsp; It will be soon.&nbsp; No rush is necessary as some infants do things at different times.&nbsp; My oldest (who is a wise 4 year old) is quite smart for her age in many respects and she didn't begin walking until after the one year mark.&nbsp; As long as the milestones take place withen a certin respectable limit it really doesn't matter when or how early or late they do these things.&nbsp; But I digress.&nbsp; I Put these parts in mostly for myself so for whomever else may read, sorry if I go on too much.

I am still employed at the airport with Jon.&nbsp; I don't think I will be for long though.&nbsp; I'm getting pritty sick of it there.&nbsp; As I am sure they are getting sick of me.&nbsp; Evident in the fact that most of the employes will often not speak to me and will infact go out of there way make sure I know they are not speaking to me.&nbsp; It all gets old.&nbsp; I care not, however.&nbsp; I am only there for one thing, really; Money.&nbsp; I'm quite sure Jon would be happy to see me leave there also.&nbsp; I am sure he is tired of working with me.&nbsp; Perhaps it's because I bitch too much (which I admit I do at times) or perhaps he is just tired of having to see me every night.&nbsp; And then hang out at times out side of work.&nbsp; I know not.&nbsp; I care not.&nbsp; I don't want to lose a friend because of a job I don't even really like.&nbsp; It isn't as if I can advance at all at this place.&nbsp; I have been thinking of going back to the world of dog grooming.&nbsp; I miss working with animals.&nbsp; People are sometimes jerks and you begin hating working with them.&nbsp; At least when a dog is a jerk you can justify it by remembering that a dogs mental and emotional capiablities are about equal to that of a 4 year old.&nbsp; That at least makes it easier to understand them.&nbsp; I would miss working with Jon, though.&nbsp; Although as I said already I don't think that would be a mutual feeling.&nbsp; 

That is about all I have to write about at this time.&nbsp; Not much else is going on.&nbsp; My grandfather is doing much better.&nbsp; My sister is doing ok.&nbsp; I havn't talked with my dad in like 2 months.&nbsp; His fault, I called him and he never called back.&nbsp; Ball is in his court.&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; Sorry for this long winded self&nbsp; deprecating rant.&nbsp; Good night.<!--StartFragment -->"

"event","I cant stand being alone.    And yet i seek out solitude as if it were my old friend.  groups of 2 or more people whom i do not know make me very uncomfortable.  I feel sad when im the only one around and there isnt anyone else to talk to...to hear me complain...to complain to me.  Still I shut myself in my house and wait for the time when the house is asleep.  When I'm alone theres noone to tell me Im wanted.  Needed.  Appriciated.  But then theres noone to complain when something wasnt done; or done correctly.  When there are others I feel compelled to be someone I dont really recognize as me.  Very few people do i feel comfortable enought to be me around.  So few in fact that I can name them right now:  Jon, Melissa, and the people at work-Cloud, kim, Jessica, Kendall, Cathy.  I feel like im letting them down though.  I MUST BE A GROOMER.  I push myself so hard sometimes I feel like Im missing the whole point.  They keep telling me one day it'll all sink in and I'll just ""get"" it.  I prey to whomever will hear my voice that that day comes soon.  I dont wanna fail again.  I dont wanna let people down.  <<Man did i strey from the point>>  bottom line I feel lonely and yet I dont wanna do anything about it.  Perhaps my need to be alone is a stronger urge then my need to NOT be alone.  Or perhaps I like the isolation.  Perhaps I enjoy it.  Or perhaps I know deep down inside that being alone is far better then feeling uncomfortable around strange new people.  Okay then, Im pritty sure I've rambled on long enough.  Sleepy anyway.

But it's all worth it.  Because puppies are great.  Everyone should have a puppy.  Especially a dog groomer.  Im not one yet but hopefully I will be one soon.  And a dog groomer that doesnt have a dog is like a tattoo artist that doesnt have tattoos.  Just dont trust em.  Anyway.  Nothing much to do.  Daughters taking a nap.  Cats are hiding from puppy.  Puppy is probably into something she shouldnt be into.  What fun.  I better get to go do something fun tonight or i just may go crazy.  First I'll have to do my masters bidding.  I'll have to clean this...wash that...build our new hutch...do laundry...all because i got married 5 years ago.

"event","I got a job finally.  I HATE searching for a job.  I dont mind working just hate looking for work.  IT SUX.  But all is well in that area of my life now as I am now employed.  Reptiles and other such exotic pets will be in my tender care at PetSmart.  It a big ass pet, pet supplies, pet grooming and Pet hospital store.  It's like Pet Nirvana.  Anyway.  Im really happy about it as I am very fond of reptiles and in fact all animals.  In fact my favorite animal on the face of this earth is the Bearded Dragon.  Which is a lizard.  I will be tending to their needs (which I would LIKE to do anyways and in fact I have had one as a pet) AND getting paid for it.  Good deal, eh?  Anyway.  Thats whats new with my life.  Rented Terminator 3 so Imma go watch that.    P.S.  THERE I POSTED MORE :)"

"event","Crappy.  That best describes me at the moment.  My PS2 wont load EQOA.  My computer is getting on my nerves.  I know it isn't fast and my connection is dial up but it wont even load pages normally.  Takes far longer then it used to.  You know how u have a text field sometimes online when filling out a form or something?  Like Address or Comments.  I type what I want to say and it doesnt show.  The cursor moves as though Im typing but no charecters follow.  Then (after 10 mins) cursor reaches the end and wham; all the words pop up.  It's crap.  Wait theres more.  I rented a movie last friday.  The Italian Job.  It's due back tomorrow and not only have I not watched it...I can't even find the bloody thing.  I've turned this place upside down and inside out looking for it.  And nadda.  And to top it all off...I can't get the stupid chests to stop opening (long story).  I wish I could just sleep and kill it all away."

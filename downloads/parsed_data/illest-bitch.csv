"event","The past month has been a complete blur... but not in a bad way.

I have met so many amazing new people that I can't even fathom how great things are right now.  

I finally feel like I've found my niche... and it's about damn time!  

As I approach the start of year number 3 in this wonderful city, I'm still just as much in love with it as I was the first day I moved to my ghetto apartment on the border of Bushwick.  I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he drove the Uhaul up to the front door and immediately said ""I don't want you walking alone on these streets at night!!""  Oh, if he only knew how many times I came home on the subway, by myself, stumbly drunk at like 3:00am, hah.

At any rate, I survived and managed to score my beautiful Greenpoint apartment a year later, and I'm staying there again for another year.

Sadly, my roommate, the only other person I've lived with besides my own family, is leaving me at the end of the month.  I almost feel like we're breaking up.  We've definitely had our good times and bad, but I think that in the end, we'll probably always be friends.  Even though she is moving back to ""Dirty Jerz""... 

But on the upside, one of my really good friends is moving in, and I know we are going to have an insane amount of fun, so it's like one chapter is ending, and a new one is just beginning... or something like that.

I've also made the decision that, after a year away from school, I'm ready to go back.  Maybe I'm crazy for doing this, or maybe I'm crazy for taking time off, but I feel like getting a good job in this city seems close to impossible, and I could use all the help I can get... and that help is going to come in the form of a degree from FIT."

"event","I FOUND A NEW ROOMMATE!!  

oh my god, i am so glad the stress of that awful task is over!  i was scared i was going to have to resort to living with a complete stranger from craigslist or something... or, this semi-creepy guy (he's good friends with mariana's boyfriend, and even he said i shouldn't do it) was thinking about coming to look at my place, and i was NOT into the idea of living with him at all, ugh! at least i got rid of him.

so anyway, the lucky person that is going to be living with me come july 1st is my new/old friend amy, and i couldn't be more excited about this!  i find this situation to be so weird because a) we're both from connecticut and we know a lot of the same people, yet we never really became friends until recently b) for years i thought she didn't like me, but as it turns out, she admitted to having a ""friend crush"" on me for sometime and was really happy when we actually became friends c)... ok, i guess there really isn't anymore reasons.

so, it looks like she managed to come back into my life at the perfect time - i need a roommate, and she wanted out of her current place in the middle-of-nowhere, brooklyn!!  funny how these things work out.

everything is going so smoothly so far, it's almost scary.  i talked to my landlords yesterday, and they basically said that since they trust me and know i'm a good tenant, whoever i pick to move in, is totally fine with them!!  amy already found an excellent moving service.  mariana is leaving her microwave oven for us!!  and, amy has a cute little cat who will keep my extremely bored cat entertained!  

i win."

"event","i'm back from texas... what a waste of a trip!  i didn't get to sight-see or anything!  i was in the hilton for nearly 4 days straight (with the exception of a few hours where they took us to a fucking dude ranch, ugh!)  

the last night we were there, i went out and partied with my co-workers, who are all older than me for the most part.  i drank 4 glasses of red wine and was dancing to disco in the creepy hotel bar, haha.  i tried to mostly do my own thing, but on occasion an old man would try to be my dance partner and get all patrick swayze on me, and i would either move to the other side of the floor, or excuse myself saying i was either too hot or had to use the bathroom.  i think they bought it... but they were drunk anyway, so who cares!

and of course, the day i landed in texas, i started to get a sore throat. so, by the end of the first night, i thought i might've had strep and all i wanted to do was hop on a plane and go back to new york... but i stuck it out, and it turned out that i was just catching a nasty cold, which definitely didn't help matters... and then i had to pay $9.00 for a bottle of ""dayquil"" at one of the shops in the hotel lobby because i had no means of getting medicine anywhere else, so that put me in even more of a foul mood!!

i'm pretty sure i called my mom and my friend liz about 50 times each while i was there, mostly out of boredom, and because they're the only 2 people who will always answer when i call, haha.

but it's over now, and i'm back in lovely brooklyn, sitting at my desk, hearing the hum of the fax machine, joanie (the receptionist) chatting away on the phone, and pink floyd softly playing in someone's office... and i must say, this is the first time in a while that i'm actually happy to be here."

"event","i've decided to get rid of my car.  it's been a sad couple of days coming to this realization, but i can't keep it anymore.

it's not that i have a big car payment... in fact, i don't have one at all; it was paid off a few years ago. i figured out that i spend so much money on transportation alone, that it's ridiculous.  first there's my monthly metrocard, which is $76.  then there is the occasional cab ride home from manhattan when it's late/i've been drinking and don't want to deal with taking the subway back to greenpoint at 4:00 am, which usually runs me about $16 (i do this probably 3 times a month), then there is my car insurance, which is by no means astronimical... it evens out to be like $100 a month, but then there is gas for my car, which IS astronimical.  i have a small hatchback which could probably run on fumes, and it still costs me over $20 to fill the tank!!  i know that people with giant, fuel-guzzling cars are easily dropping $50 to fill their tank, but i don't have that and purposely didn't get a big car... so $20 for me to fill my gas tank is just insane, and i have to do it usually twice a month, since i don't drive much.

so to recap, my current montly transportation bill is roughly: 
$76 for metrocard
$48 for cab fares ($16x3)
$100 for car insurance
$45 for gas (it's usually never $20 exactly, i'm guesstimating)
which is a grand total of $269!!!  

now if i get rid of my car, not only will i no longer have to deal with that pesky alternate side parking rule, which requires me to move my car to the other side of the street every night of the week so they can clean or whatever, (and in my extremely busy brooklyn neighborhood, there have been times i've driven around in circles for 20 minutes just trying to find a space) but i'll be saving $145!!!  

all of the money saving madness aside, there are a couple of downers to the situation.  whenever i want to go to connecticut to visit my family, i'll have to take the train instead of driving (booooo), which is an added expense of about $30, but i won't have to pay tolls or deal with sitting in disgusting traffic for hours... and the other crappy thing is that i obviously won't be able to bring my laundry home anymore, but i think with that $145 i'll be saving, i can take out a few quarters to do some laundry down the street.  

peace out, little red car."

I can only imagine how I'll feel on Sunday night.  I hate that I hate my job.  It has so many awesome perks, but at the same time, it makes me miserable.  I want to be doing something fulfilling!  Something that will make me feel proud and accomplished, not just something I'm doing to kill time and make a buck.  Blah."

"event","it seems like if something embarassing is going to happen to someone, it'll be me...  my life is just one big embarassing moment.

here are some of the things that happened just over the past few days:

i was drunk (that right there is a terrific preface to any embarassing statement) on saturday, and my friend and i decided to split a piece of vegan cake.  she then handed me a handful of change and asked me to put it into the tip cup.  i turned around and then fell out of my chair.  i couldn't stand up, and she was laughing uncontrollably, so the man who worked there had to pick me up and put me back on the chair!!  i did my best to not act like i was drunk at the time, but you know that never works.  i wasn't so embarassed about it then, but thinking back on it... it was pretty bad.

i was at this boy's apartment, drinking some red wine with him in his room... i was totally fine, not drunk at all... but you wouldn't think so because i spilled wine all over the crotch of my jeans and his bed, and i could feel it seeping into my underwear.  it was disgusting!  not to mention, i felt horrible for getting it on his bed.  he just laughed at me.

then fast forward about 45 minutes, we started fooling around... and the worst possible thing happens: I GOT A BLOODY NOSE!!  at first i just thought it was just a little runny, so i was trying to just wipe it casually with my hand, but then i realized there was blood all over my hand, and HIM!!!  so naturally i shot up off the bed, and yelled out ""MY NOSE IS BLEEDING, I NEED A TISSUE!!""  then i apologized profusely, and he was actually being very sweet about it, which made me feel like a little less of an asshole.  however, i still got a bloody nose while having sex...  that's a story i can re-tell for years!"

"event","""the worst day of the year"" is coming up very soon.  next tuesday, april 4th is my annual visit to the gynecologist.  

however, this year, i'm kind of anxious to go (i won't say excited) because i'm trying out a new place.  i've finally decided to leave one more piece of connecticut behind.  in all honesty, it was really stupid of me to keep going to to same doctor back home, even though it is only once a year.  anyway, i found a place in manhattan that one of my friends went to, and since then she has recommended it to a bunch of her friends, and they all think it's great... so i'm giving it a try.  it can't be any worse, right?

i'm a little worried that i might have pcos (polycystic ovary syndrome), so i really want to get in there and have a nice little chat with the doctor.  i also need a refill on my pills, and the piece of mind that everything is alright down there.  

after work today i have to go back to h&r block and finish off my tax return.  i messed up initially and went too early, and then a day later i got tax information from school in the mail that i wasn't expecting, so now i have to file an amended return... but at least i'll be getting more money back!!  

this past weekend was kinda quiet.  i stayed home friday night and watched ""the stoned age"" aka my new favorite movie ever!!  go watch it now!!  

mariana's little sister and her best friend came in on friday, and stayed until saturday evening.  i forgot what it's like to be around 11 year old girls... they were INSANE!!  for the most part, they behaved themselves, but they were just constantly talking and annoying each other on purpose, and basically just trying to drive each other crazy, when really, the only people they were driving crazy were mariana and me.  we fed them junk food all day, so it should come as no surprise that they were bouncing off the walls, haha.  by the time saturday night rolled around, we were way too tired to even do anything, and i was asleep before midnight.  

yesterday i hung around the apartment all day.  i cleaned a little bit, and watched the movie ""the wall"".  now, i love pink floyd... but that movie confused the shit out of me.  i understood the main theme of the movie, but they lost me at the end when it became all nazi-esque, and the big cartoons started appearing... and when bob geldof shaved off his nipples i almost barfed.

i just ate the biggest lunch ever.  i somehow managed to spend $11 at the deli!!!  but now i'm full and happy :)  

back to work!"

"event","you would never think that anyone could feel lonely while living in a city of about a gazillion people, but it happens.

i've been thinking lately about how weird it is to make new friends when you're older... not that i really consider myself old by any means, but i'm not in school anymore, and i work with people in their 50s, so it's not like i'll be hanging out with them anytime soon.  since work and school were the primary source of forming new friendships throughout the years, and now i no longer have that, it's difficult.  

you'd think that in this day and age, making new friends would be relatively easy, especially with things like myspace popping up all over, but it isn't.  people are too scared and don't want to come off as sounding weird... so they don't bother.

by the time most people reach their mid-20s, they already have a terrific set of friends that they've known for years, and for the most part, they aren't really looking for any new ones.  i was this way, and still am to some degree... but after i moved out of connecticut, going back was never the same.  some of my closest friends had moved on and began to form bonds with others, and even though we're still friends, it's just not like it used to be.  i miss having that.  on the flip side, some of my connecticut friends and i have gotten closer since i left.  i guess it works both ways.

since moving to brooklyn in the summer of 2004, i have met some really great people, and maybe i'm being greedy, but i feel like i haven't met enough.  even though the friends i've made here are wonderful, i just don't feel that closeness i felt with my friends in connecticut, maybe i just haven't given it enough time yet... i don't know.  

why was it so much easier to make friends in elementary school, than it is in your 20s??  you'd think it would be the other way around.  now that we're older, more mature, have a good handle on life, we're social, we have more freedoms... but nope, it's the 5 year olds that are able to create long-lasting friendships.  i'm even still friends with a girl i met in kindergarten and i'm going to be a bridesmaid in her wedding later this year... all the while, i can barely get anyone i've met since high school to even call me and ask me to hang out.  

meeting people is not easy."

"event","things are kind of sucking lately.

actually, that's not entirely true... however, the one big suck factor is that i went on an interview last tuesday with burberry.  i thought it went amazingly well, and yet, still no call back.  ah well.  at least i already have a decent job, boring, but still a decent job... it pays the bills.  i guess it just wasn't meant to be.  

i had such a boring weekend.  i did NOTHING on friday night.  i went to sleep at 1:00am, and got up the next day at 1:00pm!  apparently, i was very, very tired.  the highlight of saturday was buying (aka charging) a new digital camera from best buy, and let me just say, this thing is amazing!  it's so little, yet it takes such good pictures.  it's a nikon, something or other.  i'll be paying that off, along with my mp3 player, for the next 5 years, probably.  i hate debt, and i hate paying it back even more.  then later saturday night, i hung out with kelly and sean for a bit, we just got drinks, then they went to a comedy show...? yeah, i know.  i didn't think people under the age of 45 went to them either... clearly, i am mistaken!  

sunday was fun!  the only somewhat eventful day of the weekend because... liz came in to see me!!  unfortunately, my head was like, up my ass or something because i put us onto the wrong subway, not once, but twice on the way back to brooklyn!!  basically, all we did was smoke grass, eat, and walk around the city.  it's kind of relaxing in a weird way.  except for the part where weed makes me go absolutely insane and i start talking about the most random shit ever!!  

example:  liz and i were walking from my apartment to the subway, and for some reason it felt like i wasn't in brooklyn anymore... it seemed like i was walking around the neighborhood surrounding the beach house in connecticut where my family vacations at.  deep down, i knew i was in brooklyn, but it just seemed a little off.  liz stopped to tie her shoe, and i looked around and said ""i'm just trying to figure out where my beach house would be from here"", and liz, not grasping what i was saying, replied with ""jessica, you're beach house is really far from here... miles and miles away"" and in my drug-induced state, i got aggravated that she didn't know what i meant, so i yelled out, on the sidewalk of a busy street, mind you: ""NO! Not the real one!  The one that's in my MIND!!""  by the time i got to ""mind"", i realized what i was actually saying and started laughing... 

the moral of the story: smoke pot with me, it will be a life changing experience."

i grew up in connecticut.  for some reason, most people think that connecticut is filled with yuppies. this really is not true. if you have lived in connecticut, or know someone that lives there, you know the real deal.

my dad is 13 years older than my mom. they've been married for 26 years. 

i went to catholic school from kindergarten until the beginning of 8th grade. i didn't like it very much and i'm pretty sure this has something to do with why i never want to go to church anymore.

i went to public school for most of 8th grade because we moved to a different town. i was excited that i didn't have to wear a uniform to school anymore, so for my first day of public school i wore stretch pants and a long sweater with flowers on it. to top it all off, i had big red sally jesse raphael glasses. i don't know how i made friends.

i have one real brother, and a bunch of 1/2 siblings whom i rarely see. 

i failed my driver's test a few times before i actually got my license. i couldn't back into a parking space to save my life.

i've had 4 cars, but i only crashed 1 of them, and it was because i drove to the mall during a snow storm. 


the first cat i ever had was named jethro and he was a gray tabby, he died when i was 7 years old. to this day, i really only like gray tabby cats.

i can walk around with my toes bent backward, put my legs behind my head, and turn my arms completely around because i'm double-jointed.  cirque de soleil will be calling me any day now. 


i have been going to college since 1999 and i still don't have a degree. it's not that i'm a retard or anything, i just keep dropping out and going back.

i go shopping way too much. 

when i was 5 years old, i was obsessed with boy george. i wanted to marry him because i thought he was pretty. 

i had a lot of imaginary friends when i was little. my favorite one was named amy.  she lived in florida.

i had braces for almost 2 years, and i still wear my retainer to sleep at night. it makes me look really cool, especially when i wear my glasses.

my mom insists that i would look better as a blonde and she thinks i should wear red lipstick.  i think i would look like amanda lepore.

my cousins, hilary and stephanie, are my best friends. 

i've known my friend angela since kindergarten. she lives in indiana now. we just talked on the phone yesterday. 

i don't like cooking.  i'd rather eat at restaurants.

i fell off a jungle gym when i was 5 years old because i thought a boy at the park was going to throw his boomerang at me, so i let go and i split my chin open on the way down.

my dad has a male friend named dyke. 

i saw a cockroach the size of my thumb in the subway yesteterday.  

when i was in nursery school, we had a thanksgiving dinner and i drank a big glass of egg nog thinking it was milk. i almost threw up at the table.

in 1989, my parents took me to see the bangles.  it was my first concert.  they bought me a gigantic t-shirt.

i took dancing lessons for 3 years. i had to wear a lot of spandex.

i was a cheerleader in 5th grade. i got a trophy and they spelled my last name wrong. 

i won a raffle at school once, and my prize was a statue of the virgin mary. i didn't really know what to think about that.

i was obsessed with the b-52s when i was about 12 years old. i thought they were the coolest people ever. i wanted a bouffant wig really bad.

i love candy.  if i ever get diabetes, i might kill myself.

i have never broken a bone.

i used to make my mother take me to the movie theater to see some weird movies, i.e. ""hairspray"", ""big top pee wee"", etc. i enjoyed them, she thought otherwise. 

i only have one grandparent left. my mom's mom. she is 86 and wears sweatpants. i am envious. 

i really want to sing ""we built this city"" by starship at karaoke, but most places don't seem to have this song.  

i met my roommate, mariana, at school. we experienced professor lampley together, and also bianca... who still owes me $13.00!

i hate beer. i drink vodka or wine.

i went to 7-11 and bought a slurpee nearly every day over the summer of 2004, until i moved to brooklyn. 

when my mom told me she was pregnant with my brother, i choked on a piece of candy. 

i was a vegetarian for over 5 years. i started eating chicken again earlier this year. i will never eat beef again. 

i went through many different phases in high school: hippy, grunge, alterna-teen, goth, sxe/hardcore, raver... but i was mostly goth, and apparently trying really hard to find myself.

my longest relationship was 5 1/2 years. he's married now and lives in arkansas. we're still friends.

if something says ""low fat"" on the package, i don't buy it.  i will be able to notice the difference in taste.  i don't care what anyone else says.

i saw nirvana in concert a few months before kurt cobain died. 

when i was in 9th grade, i got a perm at the jc penny salon.  a few words of wisdom: don't ever go to the jc penny salon!

i used to tell my brother that he was adopted and his real parents were nudists, and they were going to be coming back to get him really soon, so don't bother packing any clothes.

i know all of the lyrics to ""mr. roboto"" by styx.

my parent's used to call me ""dooley"" when i was little because i would cry whenever my dad would sing that song, ""hang down your head tom dooley"".

i decided to cut my own hair the day before my kindergarten school picture.  i didn't do a very good job.

i don't really like wearing perfume.  i'd rather smell like soap.

i had bright pink hair when i was 19.

whenever i try to win something on ebay, i always lose the auction.  even when i try to snipe people at the very end!  i don't get it.  

i eat subway for lunch almost every day. not today though, i'm having a bagel.

the first job i ever had was at a clothing store called ""dots"". i was 16, and i got fired.

i really wanted to win ""class individual"" in my high school yearbook, but i lost to a girl named becky... she had a mohawk.

my brother has yet to call me jessica, and he's 14 years old.  for many years i was ""sis"", now he calls me ""baboon"".  there is a long story behind this. 
i am the furthest thing from pretentious.

the first person i ever made out with was some guy at a rave that was really high.  i was 15.  he liked my silver dress.  i'm pretty sure i was also wearing blue lipstick.  clearly i was a hot babe.

a bum once told me that i need a nose job.

i eat a lot of junk food.  i have horrible eating habits.

i used to go to the salvation army every friday after school when i was about 14, mostly because i thought it was really cool to shop there.  i owned a lot of polyester.

my first boyfriend was named jason.  he was the neighborhood paper carrier.  i think i was 13.  we only hung out a few times, we mostly just talked on the phone.  

i like being single more than i like being in a relationship.  i'm too independent for my own good, this is causing some problems.

i had my nose pierced 3 times in the same spot.  i kept taking it out.

i hate sports.

i was eating a cinnabon on the subway once, and the man sitting next to me stared at it the entire time.  it made me feel slightly uncomfortable.

the cure was my favorite band all through high school and beyond.  i guess i have a thing for dude's that wear makeup?

i don't go out nearly as much as i should. 

mariana and i once walked from chelsea to the world trade center to soho to union square to the lower east side and then back to the east village to catch the subway back to brooklyn. my legs hurt when i got home.

i have one tattoo and it is a giant jellyfish that takes up my entire lower back.  i don't think i want to get anymore, but this is subject to change.  besides, how can anything else compete with that?

i once had a jetta and wore a lot of abercrombie and fitch clothing.  

i don't dance very well, but at least i know this.  

i prefer pizza hut to most other pizzas.  

i get very excited when i see celebrities on the street, even if they are b-list celebrities.  i saw steve, ""the dell dude"", at the bedford avenue station and almost died.  

to contradict that last statement, i see james iha from the smashing pumpkins out and about almost weekly, he no longer excites me.

i saw a man wearing a long, black, cape-like jacket run down the stairs into the subway once.  i called him batman, and he thought this was fantastic.

i own barry manilow's greatest hits on cd, and i listen to it often.

i go to starbucks every day, sometimes twice.

i am the biggest dork i know.  

i sing a lot, and not particularly well.  mostly it is songs that i made up on the spot.  i can freestyle like none other.  

i try to avoid public restrooms at all costs.  they are always disgusting. however, i have noticed that if they have a candle burning in the bathroom, it makes it appear nicer.   

i used to tape ""120 minutes"" on mtv every sunday night and then watch it when i got home from school on monday.  it was the highlight of my week.  

i have very strange dreams and they are usually in color.

i make fun of everyone.  usually not to their faces.  

i went through a brief phase where i thought dumpster diving was cool.

i also went through a brief phase where i thought dreads on white people was cool.  

both of those were jeff's fault.

i like to say things in public that will embarass people.  sometimes this doesn't happen on purpose.

i wish ""you can't do that on television"" was still on nickelodeon.  

i had my wisdom teeth out when i was 15 years old, and my dad tried to be nice by getting me a milkshake after the surgery.  i couldn't suck it out of the straw.  

i have never been good at math.  in fact, i hate it.

everyone thinks i have a great job because i hardly do any work and get paid a lot of money.  okay.  i guess i really do have a great job. 

i was very reluctant to switch over to cd's from cassette tapes.  i liked tapes!

i saw meatloaf at the mall once.  he was signing autographs by the elevator. 

my dad has had the same hairstyle as long as i can remember.

i tend to give everyone a nickname, sometimes they aren't very nice.  you may not want to ask me what yours is.

i was straight edge for a long time.

there's more.  maybe i'll come back to this later."

"event","As of today, there is officially only 19 more days until my birthday.  This is both terrifying and exciting.  Terrifying because I am another year closer to 30... bah!  Exciting because with each year that passes, I can see how much I've grown and changed.  Since I moved to Brooklyn in the summer of '04, I have gone through a love/hate relationship with this city.  One day I am overly happy and ready to take on anything, other days I want to pack up and go running back home to mommy and daddy.  But, the longer I stay, the clearer it becomes that I am here because this is where I want to be, nothing is really keeping me here.  I could leave if I wanted to, but the truth is, I don't.

As I walked out of my lovely little apartment in Greenpoint yesterday, I looked around and breathed in the cool morning air, and I skipped down my front steps, hearing the leaves crunching beneath my boots, and all I could do was smile like a big bafoon, which to strangers, I'm sure, looked ridiculous, but I just kept thinking to myself... I love this place.  I love where I live!!  Finally, I'm happy.  It's long overdue.  

Nearly everyone I know who moved here from somewhere else in the world, hates it their first year.  I'm not sure what it is, but before you move here, and you just come in to visit, New York City seems like this magical place, and the thought of moving here makes your heart beat a little faster.  Then the time comes, you find an apartment, you start looking for a job, you make some friends, and you think life is grand!  This is until the time comes to write that first rent check to your landlord, and none of those jobs you've applied for have even called you back for an interview.  When you see girls walking down the street in beautiful clothes, and you're still wearing the old rags you've had for years because you can't afford new things.  When you step into a bar, and they tell you that the drink you just ordered, which is served to you in a small plastic cup, is $8.00.  It's a tough place, I will admit, and everyone you meet has their fair share of problems, but sooner or later you realize just why you moved here in the first place, because you love it.  There is no where in the world you'd rather be.  And after a while, someone calls you back about a job, writing those rent checks becomes second nature (but it's still a little painful), you find out about stores like beacon's closet with lovely second-hand goods at extremely reasonable prices, and that bars in Brooklyn usually only charge $4.00 for drinks, plus they're less crowded and the people are much cooler... and suddenly, things aren't so bad anymore.  

So basically, this was my own personal epiphany.  I ain't leavin'.  
I love you, Brooklyn."

"event","It's been a while since I wrote anything here.  Actually, it looks like the last time I used this was when school had just got out for summer, and now it starts up again next week.

Ah, summer vacation...  It's not really the same unless you're under the working age, or have parents that don't want you to work.  It's kind of sad to realize that I don't really have a summer vacation anymore, unless you count that one weekend I spent at the beach, or the one I spent floating around my parent's pool in Connecticut.  

But, I did have a summer fling this year... I guess you can call it that anyway.  Four months of fun!!  We ended things this past weekend.  I was sad at first but then realized that it definitely wasn't going anywhere. I think part of me just wanted to be in a relationship with someone again so badly that I looked past the whole part where we weren't really connecting, and by that I mean, falling in love... We'd hang out and have sex once in a while, which isn't really the basis for a long-term relationship.  Oh well!!  I still think he's a really chill dude, and we'll probably remain friends, who knows.  

Anyway, I'm supposed to be going out with another boy this week, possibly Friday.  Hopefully that goes well, but I'm not getting high hopes yet.  I am way too picky for my own good.

Today is my father and ex-boyfriend's birthdays.  Wait... Please ignore the fact that that sounded like I was talking about the same person, my father is definitely NOT my ex-boyfriend.  I digress, it was kind of weird dating someone that had the same birthday as my father, but I guess it just proved the age-old point that girls will look for a man like their father, which is totally GROSS!!  Anyway, my Dad is 60.  Hurray for Ronnie!  

I am having another thrilling day here at the office.  Sipping on my coffee and listening to the receptionist's radio blasting some old school hip-hop jams.  It's mildly entertaining."

i just watched american idol for the first time all season.  i hate this show, but i'm bored.  the girl won, but i was kind of wanting the southern dude to win.  i don't know why. he wasn't very cute.  actually, neither of them were.  i liked clay aiken, i wish he could be on every season.

i'm freezing right now, and of course, since it's may, the heat is off in my apartment.  since my landlord pays the heat, he has it shut off already.  so, i'm basically bundled up like a homeless person in my apartment.  crazy shit.

i also have my period and really bad cramps.

i've been smoking these fancy cherry cigarettes that make me cough like a motherfucker.  they're really strong!  i don't think i'm going to buy them anymore.  all that bronchitis i had as a child has fucked my lungs up something fierce... but mariana says they're strong too, so maybe i'm not as much of a pansy as i think i am.

in other news, this hellish semester is finally over!  i had some seriously shitty classes, but the fall semester is going to be mad easy.  i only have to take 2 more classes and then i get to peace out of the lovely f.i.t. for good.  

i swear, the mta has it in for me.  now that school is done and i have all this free time in the evenings, they go and fuck up the subway schedule so that it's not running from midnight to 5:00 am all week!!  so unless i want to spend a good hour getting home after a hot night of whatever, i'm better off just staying here.

remember a couple of months ago i was saying how i was offered a job with my old company, and it paid lots of money, etc?  well, i sort of forgot about it for a while and then i talked to the guy last week, and they totally still want me for the job and now everything is moving really fast and i have to meet with them next week... under any other circumstances, i would be really excited about this, but the problem is, i really like my job that i have now.  it's nothing special, i'm just a receptionist at a real estate brokerage, but i seriously LOVE all of the people that i work with!!  they're so awesome.  for the first time in my life, i wake up in the morning and i actually don't mind going to work!!  this is the sort of thing people dream about, and i'm giving it up for more money and a nice benefits package!?!  i don't know man, i defintely could use the extra $$ since i'm living on my own and have a fierce shopping habit, but at the same time, i'm in school and don't want a job that's going to stress me out... and i have a feeling that this one will...  but how i can turn down $40K a year??  and paid vacations?? and that glorious benefits package??   

i can't wait to go home wednesday night and talk to my parents about all of this crap...  even though i already know that they're going to say, ""take the job"", but i'll feel better about this whole thing if i actually hear it from them... 

and if this new job totally blows, i only have a couple of years before i'm completely done with school forever and then i'll get a job that i really want... but what do i do in the mean time??  UGHHH!

the other thing that's really bothering me is, after i get my degree in may... do i want to keep going to f.i.t?  do i even want to stay in new york?  do i want to move back to connecticut (highly unlikely)?  do i want to move somewhere else entirely?  I HAVE NO IDEA!!

i saw i <3 huckabees last night and it was a truly amazing movie, and i have a new found love for mark wahlberg (aka marky mark minus the funky bunch), jason schwartzman had his moments where i thought he might be kind of hot, but then in the next scene i'd think he was disgusting, so i'm on the fence about him.  jude law looks really arrogant all the time, naomi watts is annoyingly cute all the time.  and i'm not quite sure why i just wrote a whole paragraph about the attractiveness of the characters in the movie...

i'm watching a show called ""the scariest places on earth"" right now, and there's a group of high school girls from the mid-west spending the night in an abandoned sanitarium... this can only get worse, i anticipate lots of screaming in the next few minutes.  i've been in places like this before - i had an urban exploration phase a few years back - and it's really not that scary... people who are still alive are much more frightening than dead ones.  oh god, these freakass bitches just saw a mirror and all went screaming and running down the hallway... hahahha.

i have a midterm tomorrow in my product development class and i started studying for it earlier today, and then stopped because i think a retard could easily pass this test without studying.  one of the things i have to know is ""what is a private label""...  are they serious?  i should've gone to a real college.  i don't even think i want a career in the fashion industry... but i'm just finishing up my degree at f.i.t. because the school does have a respectable name and i'm almost done, so there's not sense in switching majors/schools now."

"event","being back in connecticut this weekend has forced me to come to some realizations about life... number 1 being, i can never live here again.  i love my family and my friends, but just being here is so different now that i don't live here anymore.  i guess it's ok to be here for a few days, but if i had to wake up here every morning, i think i would kill myself.  it's just a completely different way of life, and i really am not into it at all, and i seriously wonder how i managed to live here for so long.  however, this realization is a good thing, it makes me even more sure that i did the right thing by moving to new york.  on a whim, i asked my parents to sell the house and move to queens or something so i don't ever have to come back to connecticut... but as i expected, they pretended not to hear me.  well, i guess i only had 1 realization this weekend... but it was a big one, so that's reason enough for me to not have to give a number 2.  

my dad took me to super walmart last night... i guess that could be reason number 2, my town now has a super walmart, complete with white trash employees!! anyway, i digress...  he bought me tons of groceries, a shelf, and curb your enthusiasm season 2 dvd... all of which are coming back to brooklyn with me tonight.  now mariana and i have 10 more episodes of larry david enjoyment... good times, good times."

"event","Please raise your big toes and repeat after me:

     As a member of the Faux Paux Sisterhood, I pledge to follow The Rules
     when I wear sandals and other open-toe shoes:

     I promise to always wear sandals that fit. My toes will not hang over
     and touch the ground, nor will my heels spill over the backs. And the
     sides and tops of my feet will not pudge out between the straps.

     I will go polish-free or vow to keep the polish fresh, intact and
     chip-free.
     I will not cheat and just touch up my big toe. I will sand down any
     mounds of skin before they turn hard and yellow.

     I will shave the hairs off my big toe.

     I won't wear pantyhose even if my misinformed girlfriend, coworker,
     mother, sister tells me the toe seam really will stay under my toes if I tuck
     it there.

     If a strap breaks, I won't duct-tape, pin, glue or tuck it back into
     place hoping it will stay put. I will get my shoe fixed or toss it.

     I will not live in corn denial; rather I will lean on my good friend
     Dr.Scholl's if my feet need him.

     I will resist the urge to buy jelly shoes at Payless for the low, low
     price of $4.99 even if my feet are small enough to fit into the kids'
     sizes. This is out of concern for my safety, and the safety of others. 
No one can walk properly when standing in a pool of sweat and I would hate to take
     someone down with me as I fall and break my ankle.

     I will take my toe ring off toward the end of the day if my toes
     swell and begin to look like Vienna sausages.

     I will be brutally honest with my girlfriend/sister/coworker when she
     asks me if her feet are too ugly to wear sandals. Someone has to tell her that  her toes look like they've been dragged behind her car on the way to work and no sandal in the world is going to make her feet look good.

     I will promise if I wear flip flops, that I will ensure they actually
     flip and flop, making the correct noise while walking and I will swear NOT
     to slide or drag my feet while wearing them.

     I will promise to go to my local beauty school at least once per
     season and have a real pedicure (they are about $15 and worth EVERY penny). I
     say spend another $15.00 and get a even better one.

     I will promise to throw away any white/off-white sandals that show of
     wear...nothing is tackier than dirty white sandals... !"

"event","i decided that maybe it's time for an update...

school starts in a couple of weeks, i'm kind of excited about it and then i'm kind of not... i don't know what to think of it. all i know is, i'm gonna be one tired lady come fall semester.  constant work and school will be the death of me.  

i got a haircut on friday, it looks very cute... but i don't feel like posting pictures.  sorry.

summer is almost over... i seriously can't believe it. i think it's because it felt like i didn't have one, working every day and then (most of the time) being too tired to do anything else.  i miss being a kid... when summer vacation was like the highlight of your life, well, next to christmas and birthdays.  spending days at the pool, or the beach, eating ice cream, seeing your friends everyday, slumber parties, movies... god growing up really sucks. 

anyway, time for bed... monday morning is fast approaching."

"event","siren fest was yesterday, and the only good thing about it was modest mouse, and the 10 minutes i saw of ted leo.  too crowded and too hot. waiting in a long line to use a porto-potty and then for french fries, isn't usually my idea of fun, but it was either that or piss myself and starve?  anyway, i was up fairly close to the stage for modest mouse, so i thought they sounded really good... but from what i've been hearing, the people who were further back said it sounded awful."

"event","i finally got over my horrific sinus infection... my face hurt for like 3 days, and then the antibiotic i was taking made me nauseaous (sp?) so i just stopped and figured the sinus infection would just go away on it's own... and it did, it just took longer.  anyway, now i'm pain and mucus free.

i ordered new glasses, and i could've picked them up yesterday... but my mother forgot to tell me they left a message on the answering machine, so by the time i heard it, they were already closed.  now i have to wait until monday or tuesday to get them.  they are seriously the coolest glasses ever, i may never wear contacts again.

siren fest is coming up... and MODEST MOUSE is playing this year!  i absolutely love this band, you have no idea.  

and, i got my acceptance packet yesterday for F.I.T... so it looks like i'm definitely going back to school this fall.  scaaary."

i'm going to phoenix records today with greg, liz, and hilary, and if any of them tries to buy the new cursive album, and there's only one copy to be had... i will fight them. i mean it.  

i could've went to see ben folds last night, but none of us felt like driving to mass. so, we went to a diner instead... yeah, that sounds like an even trade.  greg tried to convince me that tony danza lives in milford, but i don't know if i buy it.  i mean, if you were tony danza, why would you live there?"

"event","i heard ""the beautiful people"" by marilyn manson on the way home from work today... and i totally had high school flashback.  i actually fell in love with my first serious boyfriend because we both liked marilyn manson... pathetic?  i don't know, the relationship lasted for 5 years and a number of different phases... so you decide.  i wasn't even a big marilyn manson fan back then, but i did like them... i was more into the cure in high school, but that's not really important. i had a great group of friends then... there were seven of us, and we were together constantly. that song just brought back so much... the black lipstick and the pink hair, the time we stayed out all night, and since none of us drove yet, we just walked around the town and slept in an abandoned warehouse, sneaking into the locker room of the private high school and stealing backpacks of unsuspecting students as they swam in the pool (we acquired something like 15 graphing calculators), spending nights in cemetaries.  come to think of it, i was a lot more adventurous back then (or stupid)... i wouldn't do half of that stuff now.  there's so much more, but it's just too much to list.  oh those crazy teen years."

"event","it's official... i'm going back to f.i.t. (the fashion institute of technology) this fall.  things fell through with the college i was planning on going to here in connecticut.  i met with an advisor yesterday, and i really didn't like him, the school, or the schedule i would have, so i decided that maybe i shouldn't go there... makes sense, no?  

so i came home, cried to my mom and grandmother for like a 1/2 hour about how i can never go back to college and the rest of my life is going to be horrible... and somewhere along the way, i realized how much i want to move back to new york.  a little while later, hilary and i took like a 2 hour walk all through downtown new haven just talking about everything, and it all really became clear that i just need to do this and not look back.  my friend/roommate from f.i.t. the first time around, suzanne, just recently moved to los angeles from florida with nothing, and she landed an amazing job as a visual assistant to bcbg.  she absolutely loves it... and when you hear your friends doing things like that, following their dreams, there's no better motivation than that to get you off your ass and start doing something you love, ya know?  life is too short to be miserable.

i'm going to take 1 or 2 classes this coming fall semester and have to commute from home which is really going to suck unbelievably (2 hours each way on the train... bleh) on saturdays, so i can still work and save money, and then eventually move there.  luckily, i didn't have to apply to the school again, i just had to mail back a form saying i want to come back.   i've been wanting to go back to new york ever since i made the mistake of leaving... and now i'm going back.  hopefully i won't get blown up by terrorists."

i had my hair cut this week, and i actually like it.  i know it's corny, but i absolutely love my hairdresser.  not only can she cut hair amazingly (is that a word?) but she didn't make me feel like an asshole when i left the salon...  you know how sometimes you go to the salon, and after all the haircutting is done, the ""stylist"" gets a little hairspray happy, and you walk out with a giant rock-hard poof on your head, and then you go to pay and the receptionist looks like she's going to piss herself as she tells you, ""it came out really nice!"", then you make the walk of shame out to the car, hoping no one sees you before you have a chance to get home and wash your hair?  well, that didn't happen this time."

i had to take my cat to the vet today to be ""altered"" as they call it... aka, he's getting the snip snip.  i felt horrible the whole way there, he just stared at me through the little door on the carrier,  he had no idea what was going on.  i don't think i would feel this bad if my mom's friend's kitten hadn't recently DIED after being neutered, but i guess he had some sort of genetic disorder, and the anesthesia affected his heart and killed him.   anyway, i really just want today to be over so i can go get him and have this all be done, and i'll know that he's going to be ok.  oh man, i sound like some weird old cat lady... that'll totally be me, living in some scary run-down house with about 45 cats and no husband, and all the neighborhood kids will throw rocks at my windows, and ring my doorbell and run.  i'm putting too much thought into this."

"event","valentine's day is the stupidest day of the year... but on a happy note, i got to spend it with my 3 favorite ladies- liz, steph, and hilary.   our original plan to go to ""bar"" and get their famous mashed potato pizza was ruined by the fact that hilary isn't yet 21 and they wouldn't let her in because they consider themselves to be a brew pub, and not just a restaurant.  blah blah blah.  so, we found this out after we had just payed $7.00 to park the car, and the asshole at the parking garage wouldn't give us any money back.  with that mindset, we trudged through new haven in high heels and skirts, among other things, trying to find a place that would let us in.  our mission wasn't successful, so we went back to the car, and went to t.g.i.fridays and waited about 45 minutes just to sit down (which was to be expected, since it's like that everyday and that day was particularly special being valentines and all...), we had a shitty table surrounded by windows!! it was so friggin' cold, we ate with our coats on... until we convinced the waitress to get someone to turn the heat up... and she did, it rocked.  after dinner, we went to liz's for a little while, then after we came to the definite conclusion that there was absolutely nothing else for us to do... we called it a night."

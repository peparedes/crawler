You like partying and politics - and are likely to be young and affluent.

You're less religious, traditional, and uptight than most Democrats.

Smoking pot, homosexuality, and gambling are all okay in your book.

You prefer that the government help people take care of themselves.

Ok, but I hate saxophones, Clinton, Democrats, and US politics.
Otherwise, right on target."

"event","Yea, so it's february and the cruise trip is coming up, yay. Was sick, stomach hurt, so I was out of school today. One thing I notice is everyone has a LJ that has something interesting in it. Of course, my life isn't very interesting, so I'll just try and find one of those question things to answer so you can tell how truly BORING I am =P.

stuff's pretty good. friedman has started to annoy me, though i haven't annoyed him, he thinks well of me but i find some of what he says to be empty and without purpose. I'm sure i'm not alone.

now just sitting my lazy ass down to watch tv. i'm always leaving my AIM up, never putting on an away message, so it looks like i've been on for several consecutive hours. ew. so if you im me and i don't respond, i'm probably ""doing something else"" (no, no that)

"event","It's almost the holidays. Accidentally forgot to hand in my movie review for my Facing History class, and I was planning to do that tomorrow.
Some asshat decides to compensate for his lack of balls by writing a bombthreat on a desk, so now all these people are disappointed over Winter Wonderland, and that just sucks. Otherwise, nothing different. Going upstate until Wed. or Tues. so I'll be back then. I might show up online, and my cell phone (521 9091) will be on.
That's all for now.

"event","Here's another blogthing a friend recommended me :-/. Not many answers lol. Anyway, today was nothing special, nothing new, except for the fact that the roof, the roof, the roof was on fire in the sixth building. Oh, wow, 1st period is extended. Big whoop. Everyone was freezing outside then too. I also notice how chaotic the halls are becoming at the high school. I think that the high school is falling into total chaos, which is unbelievably cool.

"event","I decided to do one of those stupid things that describe yourself in your Livejournal, for the hell of it. Here goes.

<b>The Ultimate Politics Survey</b>

Describe your stance on:

Abortion: I don't like it, but it would be foolish to make it illegal. So many women would get illegal abortions that there'd be way too many deaths. 

Affirmative Action: I think society should be colorblind. The person matters, not the ethnicity, race, etc. This is the only thing I'm kind of moderate on. 

Age of Consent: 16-18, whenever you feel is right. 

Animal Testing: If it gets cures, sure. Unnecessary pain inflicted on them is wrong though. 

Death Penalty: I don't care for murderers or rapists. There's a population problem already. 

Downloading Music/Movies: Don't care. 

Drug Decriminalization: Yes in terms of less dangerous drugs, definitely no to cocaine or heroine, etc. 

Factory Farming: Don't care. 

Free Trade: Bring this shit down. Now.  

Funding of Arts: If it makes society happy. 

Gay Marriage: I have no right to tell people who they can and can't love. 

Gun Control: As long as the owner is known to be a stable, law abiding citizen, it should be legal to own guns. 

Immigration: It's trouble causing. 

Hardcore Pornography: If you want to view it, go ahead. I'm not gonna tell you what to do. 

Human Cloning: If it is for the better, sure. 

Miltary Draft: No one has the right to send anyone else to die. 

Minimum Wage: Raise it, people need to live, not just get subsistence wages to keep them functioning. 

Prostitution: It keeps human nature in check. 

School Vouchers: Bad. 

Taxes: If it's for education, medicine, welfare, and other things that matter, let them go up. 

United Nations: A good step towards peace between nations, though the US still causes trouble. 

Universal Health Care: Necessary for any society. I don't want to have anything to do with any person who wants to make someone have to pay for their suffering/injuries. 

War on Terrorism: Great. Arrest/detain/exile Bush first. 

Welfare: Good, so noone has to starve.

Lab Partner: Dick Chainsey
Mr. Hayon
Irak Lab

                            IraQ LaB
Purpose: To make up really convincing excuses to drop bombs on some country with folks that aren't good Christian folks. I can't spell the name of this country so I've had to ask Dick to type it fer me. I don't like usin' them big words.

Materials: Tanks, troops, a dumbass Texan president, his corporate puppet master, and a bunch of old grayhaired men who make up funny ideas so that they can find something better to do than sit around and make Pepsi commercials.

Data: Umm, since Dick sed that the Dayta that we was givin' was 
un-rEE-lie-uh-bull, I should just mayk up mah own. He sed it wud help me get in touch with mah own violent inhebityons, or indescriptions, or ambitions, I don' reckon I remember that there mighty long word so I amn't gon' get y'all confyoozd.
Saddam Hussein (thanks for teachin' me to spell this Dick! I know those prolonged study sessions in that thar ""undisclosed location"" took ther toll on yer thumpin' thing in yur chezt! I's gonna mayke you prowd!) is a big fat meany hed who I suspec'k haz som weppons of them ass deconstruction...or de-evolution? Sawry dick but the grammar monkey onleh tawt me how to peel bananas! 
Oh my gawd, I just said a word with ""evilution"" in it. I must nao insert sebral o' dem bib-ull verces to mayk mahself feel bettuh!
Osama Been Laid In is a terrist. And that's bad. Terrist bad. Terrist very bad. I've been readin' this funny lil' book by a man by the same first name as me! George! But he ain't George W Bush, he is George Or Well! I like this funny storie cuz it's about a farm with a pig named Napoll Leon, and he reminds me of him, because--...No dick i took my ritalin...I DON'T WANNA MISS THE SCOOBY DOO MARATHON DICK!!! Alrit Alrite I'll just say Osama's Been Laid In is a very bad man. I was trying to read mah pet goat and that there bastard had to go n' ruin mah day.

Conclusion: I'd put this in but I've already started one of them pre-emptive stryks. So I'll just land on an Aircraft Carrier and say mission accomplished. Then the terrists will magically be pacified by mah display of manly macho texas airman. I knew them two days in the Nashun-all Gard wus comin' in use!"

"event","I finally got a livejournal! So now you stalkers have something a little more tangible to look at. Maybe tangible isn't a good word to use but you know what I mean.
     So life is...static.
Nothing's happening, nothing good, nothing bad, just...nada.
So that's that, nothing new. SO EX-expletive-CITING!!!
     I'm in an indifferent mood really. Everyone's been telling me how they liked my article on ""Why Americans Don't Vote"" to tell the truth after these elections I don't even give an (expletive) about what happens. Go (expletive) yourselves, 58 million jackasses. 
     I'm also pretty sure the FBI is onto me. With those weird clicks on the phone, to those ""wrong numbers"" and other shit. So there. If I never post another entry it is probably because I'm in Guantanamo or Alcatraz. Send postcards.
     Another weird thing. I don't dream often, if ever. Lately I've been having seriously weird dreams, creeps me out. Sometimes it gets me so upset that in the morning I find myself drinking orange juice. That's so not me. Orange juice...
     You're probably thinking this is just another livejournal, but I wanted to make mine unique, because my nursery school teacher said I was special. So screw the rest of you. See my next entry."

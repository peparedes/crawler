"event","During one of our YM conversations a few days ago, <lj user=""sugarcages""/>&nbsp;and I were discussing food and the topic of baking randomly came up. She mentioned she would want to bake in my family's kitchen, and so on a whim I invited her over to make some good ol' apple pie! We got so excited, we ended up inviting a few more people. Bakeday for two became bakeday for... seven (if we count Sol-chan...lol!). <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v99/laikaken/food/applepie_3.jpg"" /><br /><lj-cut><br />We used <a href=""http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/deep-dish-apple-pie-recipe/index.html"">this recipe</a> from the Barefoot Contessa herself, Ina Garten. Some modifications were made to the filling and are written below. However we made sure to follow the pie crust recipe as close as possible. Only difference in the crust is we used Crisco instead of vegetable shortening - which can be found in Landmark, Trinoma. We also didn't own a food processor big enough for the job so we followed the hand-made procedure by <a href=""http://www.joythebaker.com/blog/2008/11/apple-pie-for-your-soul/"">Joy the Baker</a>. (note: recipes stated were doubled... for more pie, of course!)<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v99/laikaken/food/applepie_1.jpg"" /><br /><br />Modified Filling Recipe:<br /><ul><li>4 pounds apples, peeled, quartered, and cored. (we used 60% green apples, 40% fuji apples)</li><li>1 lemon, zested</li><li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice</li><li>1 cup sugar</li><li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li><li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li><li>1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li><li>1/8 teaspoon ground allspice</li><li>eggwash (1:1 egg to milk ratio)</li></ul><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v99/laikaken/food/applepie_2.jpg"" /><br /><br /> If you've read the comments about Ina's recipe, one thing is clearly stated. &quot;The crust is divine!&quot; And we, hands down, have to agree. This pie crust recipe is a keeper!<br /><br />Also, some of the reviews state that the filling was too sour. We wanted to avoid that possibility by tasting the apples first then adjusting the recipe. We added a bit more sugar, removed the lemon juice and used 2 tbsp of orange juice instead. We also skipped the orange zest (because it wasn't firm enough to get the zest off... lol). A good call, I'd say, because the green apples were much too tart.<br /><br />End product was good but not perfect. There were mixed opinions about the tartness of the filling. The sour taste of the green apples were particularly noticeable if you happened to bite into it without some accompanying crust or ice cream. However, if the bite is mixed with every component of the pie, it's &quot;just right&quot;.<br /><br />For anyone who is going to try the recipe, I recommend using 60% fuji and 40% green apples instead.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v99/laikaken/food/applepie_4.jpg"" /><br /><br />&quot;Mmmmm... Pie...&quot;</lj-cut><br /><br />   <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class=""multiply:no_crosspost"">&nbsp;</p>"

We should have been home Monday evening but most likely we will fly tomorrow, Wednesday morning.<br><br>It's not all that bad though, I get to eat nice foods and sleep in an airconditioned hotel room. Down-side is, it's been raining non-stop so going around isn't easily done. I have nothing to do except sleep, eat and watch TV. I didn't bring my DS because I thought I'd only be here for around a day. Sadness.<br><br>Oh Sunday was fun. When I arrived from the airport, I met up with my family to head to Bais ( a nearby town) and go Dolphin-watching. We really thought we wouldn't see any but after around 40 minutes of riding in a boat, we spotted a pod of dolphins, consisting of roughly around 20-30 members. They even swam along side our boat and we would clap whenever they surfaced (locals say it keeps them curious). We all acted like hyper-active children, yelling and cheering at the dolphins. I bet they were as much amused with us as we were with them.<br><br>After that, at around lunch time, we went to a nearby sandbar that had houses on stilts. We rented one for a few hours, had our lunch there and even swam. The rain wasn't so bad at that point yet, but we were feeling the cold winds already. I didn't stay in the water too long, the waves were too strong and it was getting cold. Plus I was too damn full because of the food.<br><br>After that, we headed back to Dumaguete, spent most of the time (until today) resting in the hotel, visiting friends and eating out (also an eetsy bit of touring, which we did today). <br><br>Did I say already that I mostly just ate and slept?<br>  <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

"event","Which ended up to be a meeting with Yugi and Oja as well! XD<br><br>Haaay nako! Buti naman nakapagmeet na kami ni Ela sa wakas! Sobrang nakakamiss kaya tong babaeng to. We met at around quarter to 4pm at trinoma today. At first it was funny cuz we were a few feet away from each other but didn't notice the other's presence.<br><br>I told her I was going to meet Yugi as well at 4pm, so we decided to walk around the newly opened Landmark department store muna. After that, we met Yugi then waited around an hour for Pam.<br><br>Ela insisted we eat at Kimono Ken at SM the Block, and when we got there, lo and behold! Oja just finished eating her meal! LOL. Impromptu talaga. o_O<br><br>After our meal we headed to the old SM mall since Pam needed cloth for work. I introduced Oja, Ela and Yugi to ""Bake and Churn"", a stall that sells yummy ice cream cakes and cake ice creams. :) we ordered Mango Sansrival Icecream. <br><br>Then after that, we next headed to Bubble tea to have our fix for milk tea. Yummy... as always I went for the chocolate milk tea. Pam had royal milk tea, Ela jasmine milk tea and Oja green milk tea. And Yugi had none.<br><br>We headed back to Trinoma after drinking bubble tea and went to timezone. How lucky! There was an empty videoke booth! Yugi was first to sing, then Pam. Ela had to be forced to sing in the beginning but after her first song, she was showing signs of getting addicted to videoke. Hahaha! They forced Oja to sing next, who sort of sang a song but didnt finish it. Ako, ayaw ko talaga kumanta so sorry na lang. XD<br><br>At around 10pm, Ela had to leave so she went ahead of us. Time zone was about to close na rin pala so the 4 of us left 15mins after ela. Tapos nun, tumambay kami sa McDo of west ave and chatted (about making money and stuff!) until we parted at 12mn.<br><br>It was a fun day.

"event","Got myself a new boy hamster from Bioresearch during my visit to Megamall with Pam yesterday. I named him Tiramichu because of his color, and he's really adorable. Yes, I plan to mate him with one of my female hamsters named Milch (my friendly white hamster who is Psycho Yumi's daughter) when he's grown up a bit more. He's kinda jumpy but I'm letting him get used to people holding him. At least he doesn't bite, and does so only when startled. (like what he did to that dumb bioresearch personel. buti nga! di kasi marunong maghawak ng alaga.) <br><br>I'm also slowly introducing him to the hamster ladies under my constant supervision. Hamster-chaperone! Tiramichu lives in a small wire cage, and from time to time, I put it in the big aquarium where Yumi and Milch are. That way, they get to interact but are separated (for safety reasons) by the wire-cage. I also already put him and Milch together in his cage for a few minutes and he seems eager to do his mating business already! LOL. But he's too tiny to actually get on Milch. Poor baby. As for him meeting Yumi without the cage to separate them... I'm a bit hesitant. Yumi is really aggressive and Im afraid she might hurt poor Tiramichu. No sex for you anymore Yumi the hamster-hag.<br><br>So yeah! Hopefully I'll get baby hamsters with nice colors soon!<br>  <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

With a pretty menu displayed outside it's doors, we decided to give ""Bubble Tea - Tokyo Milk Tea Place"" a try today when we saw it's Megamall branch.<br /><br />Frankly, the place was empty when we dropped by at around 12nn, which is probably due to the fact it was new. However, the inside was very pleasant. And as Pam puts it, their lighting made the place even more inviting. The color theme was cute as well - it reminded me of celery or leeks, for some reason.<br /><br />They serve Japanese fusion cuisine and specialize in Tea beverages. Meal items cost around P150+, while their drinks cost P60-100, depending on the size and toppings you add on. <br /><br />Pam and I ordered the following: (Pics taken using Pam's camera-fone... I really should bring my digicam everywhere I go. -_-)<br /><br />Pork Katsu Curry (served with Egg! o_o)<br /><img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://images.laikaken.multiply.com/image/1/photos/upload/300x300/RvuC0QoKCngAABi7ZxI1/DSC00185.JPG?et=a%2CvI5rrEhhvIZxUJZjXyoQ"" /><br /><br />Teriyaki Chicken Doria (casserole dish)<br /><img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://images.laikaken.multiply.com/image/1/photos/upload/300x300/RvuEmQoKCngAADd1B0Y1/DSC00187.JPG?et=vwKmU4tY8mDjtv%2BWSMioaw"" /><br /><br />Chocolate Milk Tea and Royal Milk Tea<br /><img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://images.laikaken.multiply.com/image/1/photos/upload/300x300/RvuFIQoKCngAAEkRIMI1/DSC00184.JPG?et=vnljHvu7aCr7dC5y8w0Rkg"" /><br /><br />And Ika (Squid) Fry<br /><img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://images.laikaken.multiply.com/image/1/photos/upload/300x300/RvuFcQoKCngAAE9A7Fo1/DSC00186.JPG?et=mXQiB7Ix2bo3suCvgB7W6Q"" /><br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the beverages. The Royal Milk Tea and Chocolate Milk Tea were light and refreshing. Also, the chocolate flavor did not stick to my throat as some choco drinks do, thus I did not need to wash it down with water. Plus the flavor of the tea did not disappear even with its infused flavors.<br /><br />The way they served their curry was somewhat new to me as well. (Eaten with egg? That's a first.) The casserole was also interesting with the surprise of gooey Mozzarella lying between the rice and chicken. But watch out for that first bite! It will burn your tongue. @_@ The Ika Fry, on the other hand, seemed like normal Calamares until you try the sauce that comes with it. I would describe it as Japanified Fishball Sauce. XD<br /><br />All in all, Pam and I had a great meal. With just a budget of P200-250 per person, you can get your fill and enjoy their refreshing beverages. I would definitely want to go back there again and try the other items on their menu. I recommend giving this new place a shot!  ^_^V<br /><br />Btw, they have a website at http://www.tokyobubbletea.jp but there isn't any content in it yet."

"event","Well, I have been to the orientation last friday, just a breath away from getting employed. I was handed the contract already but at the end, I asked to be given time over the weekend to think about it. Actually I did not need so much time because evening came of the same day and I already made up my mind not to sign the contract.

It's really depressing. I enjoyed the orientation thoroughly and I was truly getting excited working for them. But I had to remember my top-most priority, which was to earn and save money for my culinary schooling. The job wasn't gonna help me at all. *sigh*

If only I lived nearer the location, where transportation was not a problem. If only they decided to assign me to a nearer place. If only they raised my salary by just a bit. So many ifs... the job really isn't meant for me, I guess.

Tomorrow, I will head to their office in Makati to pick up my requirements which I can use for other job offers. Such a pity. I wanted to do this so much, I've been dreaming about it for 2 nights now. :(

Other news:

I had my very first class in ISCAHM last saturday. That was mom's birthday as well. The class was fun. We learned about basic sanitation when working in the kitchen, as well as knife skills and the names of vegetable cuts. So many french words to remember. @_@ I also got my new chef's jacket, apron and toque! I can't wait for next saturday~

For her gift, I got mom a bottle of orange-scented body wash from Marks and Spencer and a Chocolate Log-cake from ""Baked and Churned"", which I will write about that in another post. We didn't get to eat out for dinner that saturday night though, so we ate out for sunday dinner at Italiani's. The employees sang for Mama, which I took a vid of. It was very amusing. XD 

I'm still very full right now... and to think it's been over five hours since I ate dinner. @_@ I took pics of the food we ate, which I will use for a review when I have time."

"event","I doubt this entry would make much sense as I'm running on low energy levels right now... but i just need to get this out:<br><br>I'M SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THEIR OFFER. I can't believe that I got caught off-guard like a deer in front of headlights and signed the goddamn conforme. How the hell should I know what a conforme was? I never saw any of those prior to this. I know it's my fault I didn't speak up sooner, but I think my brain stopped accepting signals from my body when I saw the basic pay they planned to give. (yeah, yeah... I know it's a dumb excuse, but that is what really happened.) I now fear I can't negotiate the job offer anymore because I signed the conforme but I will still inquire the details tomorrow. I just hope that their benefits will balance everything out. If I am not satisfied, at least I don't have to sign the contract. I just have to make sure I don't panic like what happened yesterday. <br><br>But the problem is, I really would've wanted to do this job. I was really excited. Some people might say, ""So, isn't it enough that you love the job, even if the pay is not so desirable?"" Sorry, not for me.

I can't even feel enthusiastic about my upcoming cooking classes with this thing looming over my head. I'm just relieved that I will get closure tomorrow. I must.

Location: Eagle Star Condominium, F. Dela Rosa St., (near KFC Katipunan)<br>
Cuisine: Japanese<br><br>

<span class=""insertedphoto""></span><span class=""insertedphoto""></span>First an explanation: I figured I am bound to write more about food and restaurants in the future, so Pam thought I should entitle my food reviews a specific name. The term I decided to use, ""foodgasm"", was a word I used in one of my past entries describing Tokyo Cafe's wonderful menu. So from now on, when you see the word ""foodgasm"" on the title, expect it to be a review/recommendation of sorts about... well... food.<br><br>Anyway back to topic. Kamirori is a quaint japanese restaurant found at Eagle Star Condominium along F. Dela Rosa St., very near KFC and Banco de Oro along Katipunan, QC. Price range is around P200-300 per head. They used to be the order-then-pay at the counter restaurant, but just recently they changed it to your typical sit-down-and-order-from-the-menu place (are there terms for these? -_-). <br><span class=""insertedphoto""></span><br>As for recommendations, Pam and I like their <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Beef Gyudon</span> very much. After Shin Ramen Tei (which unfortunately I'm unsure if it still exists), Kamirori's Gyudon is the next best thing. Might I add, they also serve <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Omu-rice</span> (short for Omelette Rice) which I got interested in trying after watching Lunch Queen (one of the current j-dramas I'm into - but that's another story). It wasn't superb as I imagined it to be but it was a good experience. The serving is quite big too! Lastly, I would recommend their <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">New York Cheesecake</span>. In my opinion, there are 2 really good cheesecakes I've eaten. This is one of them (the other being Tokyo Cafe's Japanese Cheesecake). I don't know who Kamirori's supplier for this dessert is, but I haven't found this same cheesecake anywhere else.<br><br><span class=""insertedphoto""></span><span class=""insertedphoto""><a href=""http://laikaken.multiply.com/photos/hi-res/upload/RuwWwQoKCngAABLmUlg1""><img class=""alignleft"" src=""http://images.laikaken.multiply.com/image/1/photos/upload/300x300/RuwWwQoKCngAABLmUlg1/DSC00105.JPG?et=KxKBOG9nir8PTkQoKWFwOg"" border=""0""></a></span><span class=""insertedphoto""><a href=""http://laikaken.multiply.com/photos/hi-res/upload/RuwXTQoKCngAABXhLag1""><img class=""alignleft"" src=""http://images.laikaken.multiply.com/image/1/photos/upload/300x300/RuwXTQoKCngAABXhLag1/DSC00104.JPG?et=DUHx3kJcTg4GCNImV52e%2Cg"" border=""0""></a></span><br>Left: Omu-rice and a ripe mango shake. Right: Philly Cheese Maki<br><br>So there, my first official foodgasm sort-of-review! Kamirori is a good and inexpensive place to satisfy your cravings for Japanese food and good cheesecake. To anyone reading this and will suddenly decide to try out the place, do leave me a comment after eating there! :P"

"event","I've always been curious what it's like to work for Starbucks and be a barista. So yesterday, after being contacted via mobile phone, I went to an interview for that position at Rustan's Coffee. There were around 10 of us in the batch of interviewees and most of them had backgrounds in the food industry, not including me. After quite a lengthy wait, they had us take a short essay exam and answer a few questions regarding our backgrounds and reasons for applying. <br /><br />I must say, I'm pretty grateful Miriam College taught me how to speak properly in front of an audience and how to&nbsp;<stroke></stroke>answer (read: bullshit) essay questions without worry.<br /><br />So anyway, after the short interview our results were given immediately, if we passed or not. Fortunately, along with two others, I was one of them! They said we are to expect a call from store managers who will be hiring us within three weeks. They also noted that we can't choose the branch we want to work in, but they will find us a place that is accessible from our homes.<br /><br />Now, all that is left for me to do is wait and apply for other jobs. <br /><br />----<br /><br />Finished watching Bambino last week! It was great even though the main character was starting to annoy me. And the stories of the other characters that scattered around the main plot made everything all the more interesting. (Yona-san and Kuwa-san is so cool and Kozue-chan is really cute!)<br /><br />Up next on my list to watch: Lunch Queen. I'm going to borrow my copy from Liz, who recommended the title to me. According to DramaWiki, Lunch Queen's rating were even higher than Bambino's, so I'm excited! And as you expect, it's also about food!<br /><br />Yey for J-dramas! XD<br /><br />----<br /><br />Pahabol: I just got a statement of my account from Philam today. And guess whaaaaat?? From my principle cash of 20k in June 2006, it grew to 29.2k this July 2007!! That's almost 50% growth in a year - which is big shite!! I'm so happy! I have money for the next cooking short course I plan to take~! *dances*"

"event","To be more precise, I need cash. A lot of it. Why? Because I am planning to take up a year of culinary arts, hopefully by January of 2009. The entire thing costs P300k and by June 2008, I would have half of that via investments alone.<br><br>Yet, If I really plan to go to school by the start of 2009, having 150k by June '08 is simply not enough. I need a job now and I need to save up now. I need to put more into my investments. And what's even more difficult is, culinary school is not the only thing I'm planning for. I want to own a car and of course, I still intend to live on my own (comfortably!) sometime in the future.<br><br>Basically I'm planning my finances for years to come. One thing I do not want is to tie up my salary completely that I will not have room for leisure and other things that are spontaneous. I am also looking at the option of loaning, whether from the bank or relatives. I am also taking into consideration possible scholarships and help from family but I will not expect them.<br><br>Sigh, it's a tough thing to think about. But I figured, if this culinary path is what I really want with my life, then its a very worthy cause in the end.<br><br>... So, anyone here has a job offer for me? :P<br>   <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

"event","Well, thanks to two people who mentioned this show and my recent craving to immerse myself in j-drama, I have decided to download Bambino! Its a show about this country-side chef-boy who is trying to make it in the busy and chaotic kitchens of Baccanale, a popular restaurant in Tokyo.<br><br>And what can I say? I have only seen 3 episodes so far, but I am totally addicted. Wanting to be a chef myself, I am thoroughly enjoying the set where most of the series takes place and the sight of food in almost every minute of the show gets my gastric juices churning.<br><br>I am not really a fan of Jun Matsumoto, but I think he fits the main role well. The rest of the cast is amusing too (I like the character of Kitamura Kazuki - Yonamine-waiter-sama)! And... the opening song by Arashi is starting to grow on me, haha!<br><br>Anyway, to whoever is looking for some new j-drama to watch, I recommend this! Its a biased recommendation but heck, so what? XD<br><br>---<br><br>Speaking of chefs, I finally went to ISCAHM to pay the initial P8,000 for my classes! Wai~ I'm so excited! They even asked me to fit a jacket already!! :3 Supposedly, my classes should begin on Sept.15 but the current batch had a session cancelled (I think because of the recently passed storm), so the next batch where I am enrolled at has been moved to Sept.22, which also happens to be my Mom's birthday.<br><br>Ohhhh!!!

"event","Finally! I'm so happy that Kohikan's localized incarnation has finally opened a branch much nearer than Mall of Asia! Pam and I have been itching to eat there again for a while now, and when we heard the news of The Block's branch, we immediately scheduled for a visit a week after Tokyo Cafe's opening day. (We figured to let the place settle first, so to avoid the opening mishaps a restaurant could have.) So last saturday, we promptly headed to the mall to have a nice dinner.<br><br>Okay, I admit that we were feeling a bit frivolous that day, over-joyed to dine in the said place. We ordered quite a lot: An order of Caesar Salad, Pizza Margherita, A Kani Ciabatta Sandwich and Tokyo Boneless Chicken. Thankfully the servings were just right and we were able to enjoy every item without feeling bloated after. We even had room for dessert which would be a slice of Japanese (baked) cheesecake, a cup of Royal Milk Tea and my favorite Tokyo Cafe item, the Symphony. <br><br>If foodgasms ever existed, I came many times over. LOL. And I apologize for the lack of pictures, but I think it is against Tokyo Cafe's policy to have pictures taken from their menu. In the end, Pam spent close to a thousand (She treated me! Byuu~! =3 ) and I made sure to tip them well. I was so pleased that I even wrote a short note for the establishment and inserted it in the bill folder, hehe. I don't do that often but I really enjoyed my meal and I guess it wouldn't hurt to tell them about it.<br><br>After dinner and a lot of walking around, with my money this time, we watched Hairspray. It was very amusing. Seeing John Travolta in drag was just too hilarious for me. And I laughed even more (Pam too!) when I said that his musical number with Christopher Walken reminded me of my parents! HAHA! I think I also want the OST. Hmm...<br><br>Anyway, it was an interesting day. We had errands to do before going to the mall, such as delivering groceries and visits to the hospital. But nonetheless, it added up to an over-all splendid Saturday. =^_^=<br>  <!-- multiply:no_crosspost --><p class='multiply:no_crosspost'></p>"

I can't wait for the new episodes and I want to see new chapters already! :D<br><br>2. Bataan - Regardless of the storm and floods, we pushed for our trip to Raven Resort in Abucay, Bataan. The water was cold but I had fun! The food was great too, thanks to Yugi's relatives. I want to go back there next time, and hopefully the weather will be more pleasant. Oh, and Pam is finally learning free-style swimming! Hehehe... you're next Yugi! &gt;:)<br><br>3. Intramuros - Got dragged out into the sun on Monday. Got to taste sampaguita ice cream at Ilustrado, which is not so bad but is something I probably wouldn't eat again in a long time. It was too strong for me, the smell i mean, and it affects a lot on how i taste food. I also ordered a strawberry and mango panacota. It was yummy but I think it was kind of over-priced. The menu was kind of steep as well, I wonder if the rest of their food is worth it?<br><br>4. Culinary lessons - Update! I have gathered the funds for my classes! Hurrah! But now, my bank account has been sapped and I need a job again. Lol. So if anyone here has something for me, please message me. Hehe.<br><br>5. Driving lessons - Yes, I am finally learning bit by bit. I managed to drive up into our driveway on my first hour. Kuya says I learn fast and have a good feel for the gas and clutch. I hope I remember my lessons, since I don't get to practice everyday.<br><br>p.s.

"event","Slightly disappointed with yesterday's (saturday's) outcome. Pam, Tia, Efu and I were neither able to go to Japanime or watch the Mechanical Circus. On the other hand, I was able to satisfy my month-long craving for sisig at Dencio's. That's one out of three things, at least.

Other interesting things for the day: 1) We discovered a nice cafe at the cinema level of Trinoma that centered mostly on chocolates. It's called Max Brenner's and the two items we ordered, a chocolate truffle cake and chococcino, were so divine! Pam and I decided to return there soon to try their other items.

2) It's a bit shallow but a while back, even though it was&nbsp; already 2am (of sunday), McDonald's was still serving ice cream. They usually turn off their machines by 12mn, so it was a streak of luck that I was able to have a chocolate milkshake and Pam a strawberry one. Yummy!

3) Sigh~ I was able to spend a lot of time with my mecchan today~ (even if it happens a lot, it doesn't get tiring!) 

4) I want to own a panty with a strawberry print on it! XD

Over all, it has been a good day. ^_^"

O_o<br /> <br /> I like how this one turned out a lot. The sketchiness, the perspective (that killed me just to get it right.) and the pastel colors. It seems the washed effect is really my specialty. (actually I think its just because I suck at other styles! lol!)<br /> <br /> I like how Konochan's hair came out best. Initially, Secchan was not as cooperative as Konochan when I was coloring them, but fortunately, she decided to behave for her princess. ^_~ <br /> <br /> They look a little bit more adult here too. My style tends to do that, I guess. How old do you think they are here? I'm thinking 19 or 20?<br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy.

"event","Last sunday Mom called me over to have a serious talk with her. With my pending resignation, she wanted to know what I was planning to do after. At first, I did not think much of the question and proceded to answer by saying things like intending to learn how to drive and taking a short break.

She then elaborated by asking what I will do after that. I assumed at this point, she wanted to hear that I intend to work again after my break. So I told her that yes, I do plan to work again. She asked where I wanted to, and I gave a vague answer by saying, ""I just want to avoid graphic design jobs for now."" I told her I might get an English teaching job, like what Earl, Ela and Nechan are doing right now. 

She replied by asking, ""But is that what you really want to do?"" 

The conversation took quite a turn from there. Apparently, what she really wanted to know was what I intend to do in the long-run. So I told her I was still interested in studying Culinary Arts.

Her reaction was quite surprising. Not only was she happy that I was still actually interested in cooking (I just never brought it up because I know how expensive it is to study that.) but she also started talking about her ideas of putting up a bed-and-breakfast business. She mentioned that she was slightly sad that none of her children seem interested in what she and my Dad are doing in the farms but she was also glad that my interest could be related to it. 

Anyway, our talk went on and she told me that she was willing to help me shoulder the expenses of culinary school. If thats what I really wanted.

sooo .............. Culinary School...! Shet. Wow... I'm effing excited. X_X it feels so tangible now... *bounces in a corner* godilovemymom! *squee*

I'm thinking of starting really soon. We'll see how this plays out. ^___^"

"event","well, at least by 2 people anyway... <br /><br /><b>I reveal... Calorie Counting Technique! Lose weight steadily! </b><br /><br />Ehem, anyway. So people have been asking how I'm losing the weight. Though I would have wanted to boast it was exercise, that is not the case. I've been basically just counting the calories of my everday meals, which I realize can be b-o-r-i-n-g. And sadly, its this preceded reputation of counting the calories in your meal is the reason why most people avoid it in the first place. I don't blame them really.<br /><br />And that is why we love the internet. Say hello to <a href=""http://www.fitday.com/"">Fitday.com</a>! Now we don't have to manually count the frickkin calories of every bite we take. The site does that for you. Basically you input the food and amount you've eaten for the day and poof! It totals the calories for you! Sometimes though, because of the Philippine food culture, you have to improvise on certain items. (though Kare-kare is definitely hard to figure out @_@)<br /><br />So anyway, just how would one know how much to eat? Well to find out, you go <a href=""http://www.theloseweightdiet.com/lose-weight2.html"">here</a>. (i advice you to read all 3 phases though) Scroll somewhere in the middle of the page, and you will see a calculator. Input the neccessary information and poof! You have the approximate amount of calories you need to intake PER DAY to maintain your current weight. But you are interested in losing weight right? Simply subtract 500 (or maybe a little over 500) calories from your estimated daily calorie maintenance level, then from that point you should be losing 1-2lbs per week after starting the diet. An important note: <b>Losing 3lbs and above in over a week's time just with this diet is not recommended.</b><br /><br />Remember also, that at one point, when you've lost a reasonable amount of weight, your calorie maintenance level may have adjusted as well. So be sure to recalculate if you feel you have stopped losing weight. (more info on this on phase 3 of the previous link)<br /><br />So there! This diet is very helpful for those who have no time for exercise too. ^_^ If you can't burn the calories, then reduce it. Hope it helps guys!<b><b></b><img src=""file:///F:/WAFU%20FILES/Pictures/wallpapers/rosa_chinensis2.jpg"" alt="""" /></b>"

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won't you please, please help me?

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won't you please, please help me.

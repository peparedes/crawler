Things are going good. I think I have and internship for the summer working in a gallery !
I have been on spring break this week and I have been trying to catch up  on all my work, and I am being only 1/2  as productive as I would like.
Anyway, I've come to the conclusion that being at home stresses me out more then when I am away. My parents treat me like I am naive and I don't know how to do anything and then they contradict themselves saying, they will let me make my own mistakes. Lies. They are really good at guilt- tripping. I really hate this economy right now. I am going to save save save. It's going to be hard for me because I am such a spender but I cannot spend anymore. It's not even an option at this point."

The only thing is that I cannot get wireless to work on it. I can plug in the LAN cable and the internet works fine, but when I want to establish a wireless connection, my computer says that the router's signal is too low. However my computer is right next to the router :( I don't know what is wrong.
In other news, tomorrow is my birthday :), and I have exactly one week left until school.

He has been&nbsp; my idol since I was 15 and it was so surreal to finally hear him live. He is touring with Alison Krauss, and I am by no means a country fan, but I love what they have done. I would see that show again and again and again and again. They played a couple of Zeppelin songs&nbsp; including a slowed down blues-y version of ""Black Dog,""&nbsp; ""Black Country Woman,"" and ""The Battle of Evermore."" I heard that they were going to play ""When the Levee Breaks"" which is one of my fav. Zep songs, but they didn't. :( Either way, I thought the concert was amazing."

  So early it's still almost dark out.
I'm near the window with coffee,
and the usual early morning stuff
that passes for thought.

When I see the boy and his friend
walking up the road
to deliver the newspaper.

They wear caps and sweaters,
and one boy has a bag over his shoulder.
They are so happy
they aren't saying anything, these boys.

I think if they could, they would take
each other's arm.
It's early in the morning,
and they are doing this thing together.

They come on, slowly.
The sky is taking on light,
though the moon still hangs pale over the water.

Such beauty that for a minute
death and ambition, even love,
doesn't enter into this.

Happiness. It comes on
unexpectedly. And goes beyond, really,
any early morning talk about it.

I am getting so frustrated with my job search. I have no clue how many places to where I have applied, and I have heard nothing back, even with follow-up calls. Seriously, I have only had two different jobs since I was 15, showing that I am committed. I have a 3.9 gpa, so I would say I'm pretty responsible and motivated. I have a clean appearance. WTF??? I kinda just want school to start, I have 2 jobs lined up on campus. I will be making over $300 every two weeks just for living in a dorm and pretending to discipline residents for any unruly behavior. I also applied to be a writing tutor, which I would love to do. All my friends already ask me to proof-read their papers, so why not get paid for it? If that doesn't work out, I'll just work in the library. I just have to get through these two months job-wise.

 In other news, I think that my dad might be going back to school to get a bachelor's degree. His job is paying for it, and I am really happy/ proud of him. He always stresses hard work to my sisters and me, and it's good to see that his hard-work is paying off.

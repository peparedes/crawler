...you see him burning things in his wheelbarrow, and the fire's almost as tall as he is.</i>

No joke.
I was going outside to practice some baseball, and i smell this almost like mix between a bonfire and that stuff they use to sodder  copper pipes together.

Then i glance over and see my neighbor in his backyard.
A second look reveals that he's burning twigs and other things in his wheelbarrow.  
WTF.
We live in New York, not Alabama or Mississippi.

The smell was nauseating.
My mom was cooking and every 5 minutes she's like ""What is he doing over there?!  I should call the cops...or the fire department."" 

There are some crazy people in this world."

"event","<center>I read of a man who stood to speak 
At the funeral of a friend 
He referred to the dates on her tombstone 
from the beginning...to the end. 

He noted that first came her date of birth 
And spoke the following date with tears, 
But he said what mattered most of all 
Was the dash between those years. 

(1934-1998) 

For that dash represents all the time 
That she spent alive on earth... 
And now only those who loved her 
Know what that little time is worth. 

For it matters not, how much we own; 
The cars...the house...the cash, 
What matters is how we live and love 
And how we spend our dash. 

So think about this long and hard... 
Are there things you'd like to change? 
For you never know how much time is left, 
That can still be rearranged. 

If we could just slow down enough 
To consider what's true and real, 
And always try to understand 
The way other people feel. 

And be less quick to anger, 
And show appreciation more 
And love the people in our lives 
Like we've never loved before. 

If we treat each other with respect, 
And more often wear a smile. 
Remembering that this special dash 
Might only last a little while. 

So, when your eulogy's being read 
With your life's actions to rehash... 
Would you be proud of the the things they say 
About how you spent your dash?

<P>band--okay, but it seemed like no one really cared that we had a concert tomorrow and we suck.&nbsp; I got my NYSSMA thing back and got 22/28, which completely sucked but i deserved since there was 3 weeks that i didnt even <FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><EM>look</EM></FONT> at the piece.</P>
<P>chorus--im tony, and thats all that happened.&nbsp; He had the most lines, which is why i chose to be him.</P>
<P>H/C and Spanish--notin</P>
<P>Math...Mr Moon's <STRONG><FONT color=#ff6600 size=5>REALLY</FONT></STRONG> good at drawing shapes..no joke.&nbsp; Hes a nice guy and i feel bad that he has a mild lisp.</P>
<P>SS and ES and <EM>lunch</EM>--a blur</P>
<P>Tech--had chamber chorus instead...Shane had a cut on his arm and being the idiot he is, tried to wipe his blood on every guy in the chorus.&nbsp; And we we all yelling <FONT color=#cc0000><STRONG>""Get away from me, i dont want <FONT size=4>AIDS.</FONT>"" </STRONG></FONT></P>

"event","<P>today...started out crappy, but turned out okay</P>
<P>i woke up to catch the normal bus, and when i was walkin to my bus i remembered i had Chamber Chorus this morning...</P>
<P>(<STRONG>Wait, didnt i have to go in early today....O CRAP, I HAD CHORUS!!!!...Mr. Wings gonna kill me, especially since i barely know the music.&nbsp; I missed so many rehersals already bc of OM.&nbsp; I hope ill still be in the concert</STRONG>)</P>
<P>^^^That was conversation with myself on the way to my bus^^^^</P>
<P>I got on my bus, and went to school.&nbsp; I then remembered i had gym, and didnt bring my gym clothes, and thats bad especially when u sweat like i do.&nbsp; And then i remembered that i put my good shoes on today, when we go outside for gym. (<STRONG>Dammit..im gonna be so pissed if they get all dirty</STRONG>) It was all ok tho, bc we stayed inside for gym, and i didnt sweat a lot either :)</P>
<P>Then Home and Careers.&nbsp; And guess what katie, i got anesthesiologist and one of my top 10.&nbsp; And i also got OB/GYN, which was a little gross.&nbsp; I wouldnt wanna spend 20 years of my life, havin women open up their legs so i could have a ""look see.""...<FONT color=#999999 size=4><EM><STRONG>(Pretty creepy)</STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P>Spanish was cool.&nbsp; We had Mr. Finklestein as r sub.&nbsp; He goes ""u guys better get ur work done, or im gonna turn into <STRONG><FONT color=#999900>Mean, Mean, Mr. Finklestein</FONT>.</STRONG>""--It was <EM>hilarious.</EM></P>
<P>-breezed thru Math, SS, ES, lunch...we played pickle, which was fun..., and tech-</P>
<P>I then walk into ELA, and katies tellin everybody how i was her ""lifesaver"", by printing out her rough draft.&nbsp; And Mrs. Brennan goes <FONT color=#993300 size=4><EM>""hes such a good friend""</EM></FONT>, and i could tell she meant something else by it, bc she said it kinda weird...</P>
<P>And that was pretty much my day, if i left nething out, feel free to interject, otherwise</P>

"event","<P>The Math test was actually <EM>really </EM>easy.&nbsp; I finished it and had 35 minutes<EM> LEFT!!!&nbsp; </EM>After we finished, Mr. Smith brought in his board games and me, Adrianne, Michelle Hesari and Anna played CONNECT FOUR.&nbsp; It was really fun (even tho Adrianne beat me, and was tellin everybody she beat the <FONT color=#006600 size=5><EM>""genius.""</EM><FONT size=3><FONT color=#000000>)</FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp; <FONT color=#000000 size=3>I hate when ppl do that.&nbsp; It makes me feel out of place or something.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>1st...nada happeng</P>
<P>2nd...Mrs. Gerard treats us like we're five or something.&nbsp; ""My hand is up"" and my personal favorite...today she taught us how to handshake.&nbsp; Who does that???</P>
<P>3rd...nuttin</P>
<P>4th...im not a big fan of shapes, but on Mr. Moon's last day were gonna have a party...hopefully....and thats gonna b awesome.&nbsp; I just hope Mr. Adams doesnt make any cookies (Yuck)</P>
<P>5th..SS.&nbsp; It was odd bc it was the highlight of my day.&nbsp; I never met a teacher who said ""YO"" be4.&nbsp; It was kinda weird, bc he would say YO to get our attention.&nbsp; Listen bud, ur not my ""home-dawg,"" so dont say yo to get my attention.&nbsp; And my hamster at home has more brain matter than this guy.&nbsp; I was askin Marc for a piece of paper, but he wasnt listening, so i kept repeating it.&nbsp; Then the sub goes ""WHAT""..and then realizing how much of an idiot he was, he pretended to zipper his lips and covered his mouth.&nbsp; Me and Kierstan were crackin up.&nbsp; Poor guy, but he made himself look so stupid.</P>
<P>6th-ES..Mr Kunz made a cloud for us, and i found out he likes Eminem and Jay-Z.&nbsp; Some ppl i know dont even know who Jay-Z is, so i just thought id share that.</P>
<P>7th and 8th..nada</P>
<P>9th..the movie finally got a little interesting, with the whole date thing.</P>
<P>The bus ride..fun...wet,&nbsp; yet fun.&nbsp; Gabby's throat was hurting so i gave her a water bottle.&nbsp; She got mad at the kid, so she wanted to throw water at him, but i was was the first one to get wet, so i got her back.&nbsp; She wet the kid, and another kid who was bothering her.&nbsp; After that, i wanted to blow a bubble (long story), and i took it away and blew one.&nbsp; After that, i gave it back to her.&nbsp; She then pretended to get some bubble juice on me (she really didnt i just thought she did.&nbsp; So, i spilled water on her, and she half drenched me.&nbsp; So, all in all, it was fun</P>

<P>That math test was pretty easy, but i was so freakin tired from last night.&nbsp; I had a baseball game from 730-1030.&nbsp; Even <EM>ANNA</EM> got home be4 i did!!!!&nbsp; And i was so frustrated bc i was pitching and gave my team like 4 chances to get one.last.out.&nbsp; And then my coach took me out, when i did mothing wrong.&nbsp; When u give ur team 4 ground balls, and they either let it through there legs or throw it away,<STRONG><FONT color=#cc6600> HOW WOULD U FEEL!!!????!!!!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>1st 2nd and 3rd were okay, nothin too special.</FONT></P>
<P>4th- Math.&nbsp; It was like a blast from the past.&nbsp; Playing with shapes is very relaxing, and brings back great elementary school memories.&nbsp; Its nice to do something easy and fun for once...like a break from my hard, stressful life.</P>
<P>5th-SS.&nbsp; I just dont like that class.&nbsp; SS has always been my <EM>least </EM>favorite subject, and Mr. Sager doesnt help.</P>
<P>6th-ES.&nbsp; We talked about clouds and that somehow led us to talk about anvils and cartoons...how roadrunner always dropped anvils on Wiley Coyote.</P>
<P>7th and 8th, N2M happeng.</P>
<P>9th.&nbsp; We watched Anne Frank, and like yesterday, it took us like <EM>HALF</EM> the period to find our spot.&nbsp; I just like that its a nice relaxing way to end the day.</P>
<P>Bus Ride---<STRONG>WORST EVER!!!!</STRONG>&nbsp; I hate the retarded 7th graders.&nbsp; They think their <EM>sooo</EM> cool and <EM>sooo</EM> funny, but their just immature and gay.&nbsp; They need to <STRONG>GROW UP!!!!</STRONG>&nbsp; It also didnt help that there was no one to talk to....</P>

<P>I had a baseball game, which we lost.&nbsp; I went 1-for-1 with a walk, which i was happy with.&nbsp; And i came in to pitch with bases loaded, 2 outs, and i got a strike out.&nbsp; Very proud...</P>
<P>Got home, but missed my oboe lesson.&nbsp; It was gonna be my first one<STRONG> EVER.</STRONG>&nbsp; I got home at 230, and thats when it started, and its only in Newburgh.</P>

<P>Woke up later bc i didnt have to go in early...i love those days.<BR>After i got dressed and ate and stuff, i watched the circle of life over again. (my dad taped the concert) And after my solo was over, i thought i sounded horrible.&nbsp; Shane hit the nail on the head.&nbsp; I have a ""<EM><FONT color=#ff6600>unique</FONT></EM>"" voice <FONT color=#666666>(whatever that means)...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>So i got on my bus and went to school:</FONT></P>
<P>Gym...played wiffle ball.&nbsp; Was okay, nothing exciting.</P>
<P>H+C...watched this dumb movie about careers.&nbsp; It didnt even say nething about doctors (which is what i wanna be, by the way)</P>
<P>Spanish...test. Pretty easy.</P>
<P>Math...Mr. Moon got a haircut, and he told us he was a volunteer fireman and how he got called yesterday really late because some kid was choking or somethin, and when he got there, the family already left to bring the kid to the hospital.&nbsp; We were tryin to get him to tell us more fireman stories, but he had to teach us.&nbsp; Oh well..hes becomin more cool the longer we have him.</P>
<P>SS...Im sorry katie, but i didnt bring it up.&nbsp; Chris did.&nbsp; I just said ""Guinan.""&nbsp; But it was hilarious.&nbsp; ""<FONT color=#996633 size=4>Beaver Choppers</FONT>""---LMAO!!!</P>
<P>ES..test. Nothing special.</P>
<P>Lunch...ate food and played screw ur neighbor.&nbsp; *fun game*</P>
<P>Tech....Shane was tellin me how his mom thought i had an awesome voice and stuff.&nbsp; I just dont think i do...especially after hearing my self on the tape..ouch</P>
<P>ELA...We were supposed to watch ""Anne Frank,"" but i dont think neone did.&nbsp; We were all just talkin...my favorite way to end a day/week</P>

Being born on the 12th day of the month (3 energy) is likely to add a good bit of vitality to your life. 

The energy of 3 allows you bounce back rapidly from setbacks, physical or mental. 

There is a restlessness in your nature, but you seem to be able to portray an easygoing, sometimes ""couldn't care less"" attitude.



You have a natural ability to express yourself in public, and you always make a very good impression. 

Good with words, you excel in writing, speaking, and possibly singing. 

You are energetic and always a good conversationalist. 



You have a keen imagination, but you tend to scatter your energies and become involved with too may superficial matters. 

Your mind is practical and rational despite this tendency to jump about. 

You are affectionate and loving - but very sensitive. 

You are subject to rapid ups and downs.</td>

"event","Wow.. I've always thought i'll be a bum for a year after graduation. But then i crashed my sister's car (actually a jeepney crashed into me!) and i felt sooo guilty about it that i told myself i gotta pay my mom back for the wreckage that the accident made. So I finally passed my application form in Ateneo and submitted my resume in The Little Gym.. Guess what, both schools accepted me. But then, you won't believe this, I turned down Ateneo!!! hahahahaha! Our Department Chair Miss V is gonna kill me when she finds out i declined Ateneo!! hahahahaha! I just declined them yesterday. They asked me to report last Thursday at 8am but i overslept so i wasn't able to go.. So they called me up to ask why I didn't turn up and i finally told them that i have another contract waiting for me anyway so it's ok... There, so I declined Ateneo... Who in their right minds would do that???? hahahaha! Anyway, I really wanted Little Gym ever since.. With my ever so hyper attitude, mas bagay ako dun sa totoo lang. Plus, I'll have opportunities to go abroad. Little Gym is an international company/school so they have branches all over the world so sometimes they send their instructors for training abroad... there... oh well... I hope everything turns out right. I'm still waiting for their text as to when i could pick up my contract.. oh well.. hehehehe! goodluck to me! I'll be part of the working force soon! wow...

and btw, i've already paid my mom for the wreckage that i made with the car... so.. wala na kong utang, may trabaho pa ko.. di ba? hehehe!"

"event","Yesterday was the birthday of my friend.. (Happy birthday anne!=p) She had a swimming party at Malacanang Park. I had so much fun coz we ate a lot, had a few drinks and swam.. Among my friends that were there were Lev, Kate, Rio, Pao, L.A., Rock, Jay, Francis and Ianne.. Grabe, sa van palang papunta Malacanang laglagan na agad.. Gago talaga yun si Ianne! Wala pa namang kaalam alam sila Kate Rio and Lev. Well, I told them not to believe Ianne coz we all know that he's a major stirero... Shet.. Pagdating Malacanang we went directly to the pool yun pala dapat dun muna kami sa house nila Anne. So Anne came using their scooter to fetch us going to their house there in Malacanang Park. Tapos ayun, umpisa na ng tawanan ang lokohan kase namatayan ng makina si Anne.. bwahahahahaha!!!!!! Yun pala no more gas yung scooter. bwahahahaha! Anyway, nung eating time, si Anne naman ang nanglaglag... sabi ko kila Lev wag talaga sila maniwala... Then wala akong alam si Pao pala kinausap sila ng matino and sinabi nanaman same thing pero this time sinabi niya na no stir.. So parang ako... PAKSHET OUT AKO DIYAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! amputa! ayoko talaga ng ganun! bwahahahahaha!!!!! So, in short, kagabi medyo tablado night lang naman ako... kung ano-ano ang tinanong sakin na ako mismo di ko alam ang sagot. Hay... Pero in fairness ang saya lastnight... tawa ako ng tawa... I really enjoyed the night! bwahahahha!!!! I'm sure everybody enjoyed too! It was a fun-fun night! Worth it ang hindi ko pagsama sa mom ko(who left for a 1:30pm flight yesterday) sa Davao.. hahahaha! Oh well, there's a party again tomorrow.. Si Lev naman ang may birthday.. hehe! Ang saya! Can't wait! hehehe.... I really had fun yesterday! I love you guys!!!!! =P"

I really love these people coz the first time i hung out with them I never felt out of place.. They were so nice. Lately, I've been going home around 9 or 10pm coz we hang out everyday kung san man kame abutan.. But usually sa house ng isang katropa namen.. Why am I writing this? Sabihin na naten na sobrang thankful ako na nahanap ko tong mga toh especially ngayon na naghahanap ako ng mga kasama sa gala.. Kase yung other set of friends ko hindi gala eh.. opposite ko..

Anyway, yesterday was fun-fun day! hehehe... nagkaroon ako ng biglaan na lakad. hehe! It started with the teachers day at ateneo wherein we brought food for them (kate, jess, kiri, len and me!). Then of course ayaw ko pa umuwi so i asked the 4 if they have any plans and kunhg pwede sumama. and kaboom! my ""gala"" day started. Apparently kate has birthday party to attend to at shakey's galleria so sinama niya kame ni Len. And Len on the other hand has a test in Accenture sa Makati. Dahil nga ayaw ko pa umuwi pumayag akong sumama sa kanya sa makati. After galleria, we bid Kate farewell and went to shang to park the car and take the mrt going to ayala. When we got there, hinatid ko si Len sa sakayan ng Ayala loop (buti nalang alam ko kung san yun!) then nanood na ko ng sine sa G4 to kill time. I watched Firewall.. ok lang.. Anyway, after watching the movie twice natapos din test ni Len and we ate at Food Choices. We had to make madali coz baka masarhan kame ng Shang and hindi kame makauwi coz yung car nga nandun. haha! grabe mrt! sardines! phew! umabot naman kame sa shang and nakabalik din sa car. Pero sobrang i had fun ng day na toh coz biglaan and i never expected na si Len yung makakasama ko gumala at mag window shopping sa Galleria, Shang, SM Makati and G4.. hahahaha! tawa pa kame ng tawa! sobrang nag-enjoy talaga ako! Biro mo, 4 malls in one day?? san ka pa? hahaha! oh well... sa uulitin nalang! ang saya talaga! hehe!

I really miss the play!!!! Waaahhh!!!! Sa totoo lang, what I miss is the company, then the play itself. Anyway, going back to the gimik.. I was the one who initiated the inuman. I've missed everyone sooooo much that I had a text message sent out to the cast last Tuesday (Jan 31,2006) na we should have our own victory party. Then yung crew I invited them nung nakita ko nalang sila sa school. KABOOM! Friday came and ang daming pumunta sa Shade! Wohoo! Ayos pala pag ako nagyayaya eh.. hehe!

We were early sa Shade.. wala pang 6. We ate muna then inom na agad. We all had San Mig Light lang. Walang Red Horse eh. I told myself 1 bottle lang coz I have a flight to catch tomorrow early morning. Pero ngerk ngerk.. syempre I ended up drinking 2... anyway, buti nalanbg we started early coz maaga din nag-alisan mga tao.. atorund 9 medyo paubos na ang people. Pero masaya pa din! Woohoo!!!!

I'm not just speaking for myself but to everyone that's been involved in this play for the last 4 months. Everybdys' spirits are so low at this time. We are all so weak emotionally and physically. We need to take vitamins, kilograms of vitamins! I really need some ego booseters right now coz my mind is a whirlwind of images. Can't even think straight. Distractions come from all directions. God help me! I need energy! Physically and emotionally! And if you REALLY know me, to say that I need energy is something that you should be worried about coz normally, my energy is thrice the energy of a normal person..

So we had to bring it to the shop yesterday only to find out that it needs reformatting due to a corrupted operational system.. So.. goodbye pics, videos, songs and worst.. THESIS! But good thing my gropumate has a copy of our thesis in her computer. Anyway, since it needed reformatting, i was only able to get it this morning. How did i get it? Woohoo! I drove! All by myself! Yey! Accomplishment! That far all by myself? I have to congratulate myself! I'm so happy! hehe! Pero of course I can't hide the fact na namatayan ako ng makina kanina. heehee! pero in fairness ayos naman yung driving experience ko kanina noh! haha!

I had to go to school around 2 pm for play rehearsals. My friends were there because they had practicum kanina. We, ateneo people are not required to go to ateneo this week coz it's their exam week. So we're sort of having a vacation right now :p. School was the same, quite busy coz it's the educators week. I miss MC. I don't go their anymore, every morning i'm in ateneo. I'm really glad i was their (MC) kanina.. We finished past 9 na. So while waiting for my sundo, I saw Gel arrive using Yen's car (she drove it from the parking lot). I was like, ""you drive???"" sabi niya: ""Yeah, student's license haha!"" So I rode it with her and grabe! tawa kame ng tawa coz ilang beses na kameng muntik mabangga or sumubsob sa gutter! Ang bilis niya magpatakbo and ang ingay nung break kase biglaan siya kung tumapak! No wonder some of our friends went down the car when they arrived sa lanai kanina. Sabi ko: ""ako naman! i've never tried matic!"" i was afraid pa before driving coz first time ko nga mag matic. Pero in fairness mas smooth pa ko magpatakbo kay Gel ah! Nagulat din ako! Hehehe.. ang saya! wala lang.. ang sarap mag ""drive trip"" sa school. hehe! Basta I'm so happy kase I found out na ok na pala talaga ako mag drive.. well, compare mo kay Gel.. hehe! Basta I'm so happy and Proud? hahahahaha! ;p"

"event","Last Monday was the day when we got our grades for 1st sem, everybody amazingly has high grades.. ALthough we still have one grade missing, from our Measurement and Evaluation subject (our teacher was Mr. Mogol). I think more than half of the class reached the Dean's List average but all of us can't rejoice yet coz we still have a subject hanging, and it's not the easiest subject too (it's basically math ok?). As for me, even though i surpassed the average of the required Dean's List grade, I'm not expecting to be in that list much longer. I'm sure my missing subject would pull it down. Pero para saken ok na din.. at least my grades are high.

Yesterday (Tuesday), was our registration/enrollemnt. I saw more classmates, then during the afternoon when some of us were huddled together on the couch (the famous couch under the stairs of the college building) killing time, I realized na I missed these people na.. Sobra! You know how much I love my block, and here they are again sitting in front or beside me after not seeing them for almost 2 weeks.. It feels so good to see them again coz I swear they really make my day. They are my source of energy, they are my inspiration. What great timing that I saw them that day. My life as I knew it was already going downhill because of the many things that I'm doing. Iba talaga yung feeling pag kasama ko sila. Parang sobrang contented.. I couldn't ask for anything more.. Parang everything's gonna be okay coz I'm with them. Wow, that sense of security, I'm surely gonna miss it.. hay..

Today was the 2nd day of Beauty and the Beast 2 rehearsal/workshop. It went quite well, buti nalang ang galing ni KWENG! Woohoo direk! The best! This play is surely going to gobble up my life for the next 3 months. Mahirap pero kaya yan! Kakayanin..
I miss my friends though.. I don't see them that much anymore and I need them right now. (Lalo na yung tatlong nasa Cebu! Huhuhuhu!) I'm becoming fragile physically, emotionaly and intellectually. This is a test of how strong I am, and I will be strong for this. I need to. This is my life, love it or leave it."

So what did I cause? TRAFFIC! Hahaha! And to whom? School buses that are on their way to Holy Spirit (yes our house is near Holy Spirit QC)! So can you already picture how pathetic i looked yesterday? haha! As in I looked like the girls on TV whom you see shrieking at every turn of a corner and ending up bumping head on with another car or a trash can. Hahaha! Well, as for me, I also bumped into something. Guess what, the gutter! Hahahaha! My mom kept on laughing. Including my friend Cha Garcia who wento home with me (and she could be considered as my 1st pasenger in the car!). It was so humiliating and at the same time funny. Those are one of the my experiences that I will never ever forget! Oh well, hopefully tomorrow I'll have another driving session. I really gotta learn how to drive due to my very hectic schedule!

Including pics of last year. wow.. it had an amazing effect on me. i suddenly remembered things.. it made me happy, at the same time it made me sad. why? because those times would never happen again.. i really had fun during those times from what i can remember. and now, new schoolyear, wow.. we're actually seniors now. this is our last leg of school life. everyday as i go to school my conscience once in a while reminds me to make the most out of this schoolyear. i have to cherish my times with my block/classmates. Who are actually the best guys in the world! They're actually the reason why i feel sentimental almost everyday as i go to school. we've all been close in these 3 years and i've been very, very, very attached to them in all aspects that just thinking of the fact that next year during this time we'll all be in our seperate lives makes me cry like a little girl who just lost her favorite doll. Some i might not see for the next 25 years.. some i might never see at all again... (sob's!) oh well, i'm happy that i feel this, and not.. happy because at least i'm conscious of my reality and can make the necessesary adjustments for it which are cherishing, loving, nourishing, enriching, appreciating to the fullest and marking deep in my heart everything that's happening now. I REALLY LOVE YOU GUYS! YOU HAVE NO IDEA! [i think i'm gonna cry again...:-(] ...sad because of the reality of life. sad because of the fact that this is going to happen and there's nothing i can do about it. (another sob!) oh well, my most powerful option right now is to turn to God ask Him to help me (and us all) with these realities of life. may we all be able to adjust and be happy wherever, whenever and whatever will happen. Thank you God! You're the best and I trust You in everything... Just take care of my very, very, very, very wonderful and much loved classmates. [to the readers and to all the others... to tell you the truth, i can't find an adjective that will fit what my feelings are towards my classmates.. if there's a word that is bigger than love, then that's it.]"

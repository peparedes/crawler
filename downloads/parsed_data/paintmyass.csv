"event","Okay. The following maybe graphic or not suitable for those who have never had a crush. I had a dream last night involving myself, some old friends from high school, and <B>CHRIS CONLEY</B>! If you don't know who CHRIS is, he is the lead singer of <a href=""http://www.savestheday.com"" target=""__new"">saves the day</a>. Well I was sitting at a table with papers and things in my hand (I knew I was at school) and this blonde boy was sitting next to me talking about what we should do with our project and then he looked up at me and I knew it was Chris!!!!!!!!! I was so flustered...flabergasted...speechless...I said hold on hold on I'll be right back and I went to my friend Megan. I don't talk to Megan anymore in real life, but she was sitting at a table with some other people and I was like OMG IT'S f*&^ ING CHRIS!! HE'S HERE!!! She was like ""well go to him"" (kinda sarcastically, not caring much). I went back and we worked on the project a bit then he asked me if we were all alone and he closed the door to the room we were in and came over and started kissing me. I took off my top and my skirt and sat on a table, then layed back on the table. It felt so real what I was doing, but in real life I'd never be that bold to do something like that EVEN IF it were Chris and something like this happened. It was me but it wasn't me. And yes, I'm a virgin (for the inquiring minds). Needless to say, I woke up with a HUGE smile on my face.

At work today I was doing an ad and this guy had come in and was acting pretty weird like he wanted to leave but didn't. Finally he exited and the alarms went off and these cops came RUNNING after him. I jumped out of the way cause I was in the middle of the aisle. This dude had taken like 8 cd players from electronics!!!!!!! It was crazy. Then he tried to talk his way out of it and the security guard was like SAVE IT SAVE IT! LMAO. I was laughing cause they had pinned the guy up and he didn't even try to run or get away before they caught up to him outside.

That's all. Happy Halloween. Be Safe. Blessed Be."

"event","I went to a casting call site yesterday and submitted some info about myself including pics, experience, etc. I was emailed back by a producer making a film in New Jersey and he invited me to come to the casting call. Among the things he noted in his email was that some characters maybe required to be nude. Me personally, I think the body (in general, male or female) is a beautiful thing. I have no issue with it whatsoever. The problem is... my family. my friends. What if they see these film a few years down the line? What if I become this famous actress that is known for not doing nude or brief nudity roles and then some paparazzi dick pulls out this ONE movie and makes me look like the total hypocrite that I am? Okay, now I'm being silly :P And what if I have children and they wanna see the kind of work I've done and they stumble across this film? I know I'm ""predicting"" too many what-ifs, especially seeing as I haven't even been selected yet, this is just the audition. I've decided not to take this role.

Today I've just been debating in my mind to take this role or not. Also, I've been thinking about my brother and his girlfriend who have a baby due TODAY as a matter of fact. I bought some baby things from work today- a layette, bibs, socks, shoes, and a sleeper. And it didn't even cost me 5 bucks. Thank goodness for employee discounts!!! :) I wanna learn how to add pics to my blog (but maybe thats only for paid accounts?) .If it is for paid accounts, guess what.. the pic next to my name will be the only one you will see for a while. WOW. I got emails to reply to. Catch ya later :D"

"event","So I'm off today and sitting here playing with one of these virtual pet thingys I got off ebay. I know I planned to re-sell these, but those nano babys are so cute!! LOL. Plus I'm hella bored, as usual. Work sucked yesterday. Had a psycho looney guy come in right before I was about to leave and he started screaming about clearance towels!!! LOL. I tried my best not to get upset or anxious. I don't know how I can work in a Department store to begin with, being agoraphobic and all. People make me nervous. I'd prefer to work like my buddy SEAN who can sit on his ass and make websites all day and not have to worry to much about dealing with lots of strange people. So what am I gonna do all day? Watch dvds? Get Fatter? Take my ass outside? Yep, I like the last one best. Cya latersz"

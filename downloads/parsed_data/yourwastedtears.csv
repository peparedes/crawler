"event","today was a somewhat interesting day. i didnt go to work <i>again</i>. *sigh* yeah, i know, i need to get it together. anyway matt and i got up and came to my house. ooo i made my baby ghetto sandwiches and rice :) we stayed at my house for a while and played with my dog, and then we left to go back to matts. we didnt do much but watch tv for a while, and then we went to see his grandma to talk and have lunch. yes, we are fat kids, and yes, we eat alot lol. after that we went to harford mall so i could go to victorias secret and hechts. then it was back home for a nap and back to my house to get ready for school. 

school started out rough. first, there were no parking spots so i had to park at the end of the lot that was furthest away from my class. not that i mind walking, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT ITS BELOW 20 DEGREES! so i get inside and get somewhat warm, and get up to the fourth floor where my class is (of course the elevator is broken) only to find out - my class has been moved downstairs to the first floor! so i have to walk all the way downstairs (which bothers me because stair wells make me a little paranoid). i get into class and it seems alright, except it looks like most of the seats are filled (its a small class). my hands were full, so i ask this one guy to help me fold out a desk (we have the small ones with the folding chair/desk combo ~ hey its photo what do you expect), and this is the cruddy fucks response - <i>well uhh i would help you but well not all the seats are taken yeah im not trying to be lazy but uhh yeah</i>. whatever. floofy haired motha jerk. plus our class wasnt heated well, so it was chilly the whole time. after i got past all of that, it wasnt so bad. my teacher seems pretty nice, and the other students seem alright. all we did was go over the course, introduce ourselves, and go on a photo taking scavenger hunt. it seems like its going to be alright. i cant wait till it gets warmer! 

yep yep. so now im home and just ate dinner/watched the mtv challenge. next its exercise .. shower .. homework .. and bed. I AM MAKING MYSELF GO TO WORK TOMMOROW! 

im off to work out. later sweeties...

"event","oooo ok so last night was supposed to consist of me staying home and doing my laundry, cleaning, getting everything ready for school etc etc. instead, noamel asked matt if we wanted to go see undying - he said he wanted to hang out with us like high school lol, plus he said he hadnt really seen me since the last undying show several months ago. so i got ready and went back to get matt so we could go.
 
   first we had to stop off at his grandparents restaurant. mmm and his grandma offered me dinner (but i had already eaten). after we left we headed off to the show. 

   all we saw was monger= silly ~ i cant take them seriously, misery signals= pretty good, and half of undying= mmm. 

   faces= alex (no sean), zach, noamel, and noamels nice lil girlfriend. mel and dom were supposed to show, but couldnt find the depot. ehhh :(. 

   not only was it cold as shit, the show was running late because for some reason they had an almost hour long break. so we left around 1130/1200 and went to dennys. the food was terrible, but we had my favorite waiter :) 

then it was back to matts and straight to sleep (really kids just SLEEP)...

today shall be filled with most excellent chinese food and bad horror movies (arent you jealous). and on that note im going to get back to the tv ...

"event","<h7><b>matthew and christina ~ the history</b></h7>

<i>well it all started on a baseball field. i was 13 i think, or something really close to that. anyway, my friend karrie and i were walking to the aberdeen middle school to see my boyfriend at his baseball practice. while we were there a boy whos name we wont mention decided to grow some feelings for me, completely disregarding the fact that my boyfriend was on his team. i never liked the boy as more then a friend, but friends we became none the less, and so we started to spend a considerable amount of time together. this boy happened to live about two blocks away from me, on ford street, and had a friend/neighbor named matthew. one day he introduced us, and thats how it all began.</i>

the boy eventually decided he didnt want to have feelings for me anymore. whatever, we never were anything anyway. however, i did get lucky enough to remain friends with matt. at first it wasnt much, he just sat in front of me on the school bus. then he decided he didnt want to ride the bus anymore, so we would walk to school together. every morning he would be waiting for me at the top of the train tracks. then he finally got a car (mind you i couldnt drive yet, being that im a year younger than him) - a blue station wagon! wo0t. it didnt matter what it was though, back then a car was a car. so yeah, we would ride together, stand side by side in the halls in the morning, go to the mall together, etc etc.

<i>people always thought there was something between us. whisper whisper ~ matt likes you : are you two together : isnt that your boyfriend? i guess i always just disregarded that stuff. i dont remember how or why, but something aparently went wrong. i dont know what happened, but i remember us starting to argue. i know it wasnt alot, and it wasnt important, but i vaguely recall something was up. and then, my parents decided to move, and within a few months, our house was sold, and i was gone. i told everyone goodbye, and most people i lost contact with.</i>

one day many of us were reunited, but it wasnt under happy circumstances in the slightest. i was a senior, a friend passed away, and alot of us came to pay our respects on the day of his service. i saw alot of people that i hadnt seen in close to a year, one being matthew. i dont remember much from that part of the day; there wasnt much talking, just crying and hugging. one thing i do remember was our ride to the burial plot. it was raining hard and we all had to cross over the bridge. curtis and i were in the car, and before we knew it, slam!, we were in an accident. we get out to see what happened and who hit us ... turns out it was matt. we ended up spending the next few hours with the police. goodness what a day :(

<i>after that matt was gone from me for another several months. skip forward to the summer, right after i graduated. one day i was over karrie and brians, and somehow karrie had got word that matt was back in town, living with his grandma. you have to understand that this boy was hard as shit to track down. anywho, we decided to go visit him. i just remember him coming to the door to talk to us, and my jaw practically hitting the floor. OMG matt was fine as hell! im surprised i didnt mess myself. we couldnt talk long because i think he had to leave or something, but we got his number and stuff. karrie told me she didnt think he had a gf, and although i wasnt single, my relationship was over, and so i was trying to hook that shit up. a few days went by and i got up the nerve to call him. i talked his ear off about unimportant crap, and was trying to move myself on in, only to find out HE HAD A GF!!!! ahhhh, how did that happen? i was kinda upset, but i tryed to play it off (after all i didnt come right out and ask him out or anything, so i figured it was still a salvagable situation). we talked about me coming by or something sometime, and i said something like, "" i miss seeing you and hanging out with you, and how we used to be pretty good friends"". then the deal crasher ~ matt said, ""yeah i used to drive you to school or whatever"". wow that made me feel like shit. i never went over.</i>

ok now skip forward to the winter time. my 18th birthday finally arrives. im stoked! - or at least i was, until i crashed into a tree, totalled my car, and almost killed myself in the process. damn what a day! this is only important because a few weeks after my accident i run into matt again. curtis and i decided to go to best buy and we saw matt and noamel in the checkout line. the general consensus - i looked like death warmed over. yep i think that pretty much sums up that part of the story lol. 

<i>doot de doot doo! over a year passes and we didnt see each other. then one night brian and i decided to go see hatebreed at the thuderdome. well, hatebreed didnt show, but matt did! i saw him come in and walk to the other side of the room. i kept debating on whether or not i should go over and speak to him, and so i finally did. and he blew me off! he basically ignored me and talked to brian the whole time. i was really hurt and upset. what an asshole!</i>

months go by. lots of shit goes down for the both of us. breakups always seem to suck, until you find out that other people that youve been interested in forever are also breaking up. as bad as that sounds, its actually a really good thing. so .. now we are at the month of september. karrie hears yet again that matt is back, this time at his moms house. one day she pays him a visit and they talk and exchange numbers. i hadnt talked to her for a few weeks, but when i did and she broke the news to me, i asked for his number so i could ""clear up what happened at the hatebreed show"". so i called his house and left him a message to call me - and he never did. so karrie and i waited a few days and tried again. this time he was home, and invited us to come to see him in 25 ta life for his birthday show. we said ok, and told him he had to call us within the next few weeks. and he called - ME! i was upset cause he called when i was at work and i missed him. so i just called the next day when i got out of work at the office. we went out all day and caught up on everything, the next day we went to long island NY for a 25 show, the following day we went and saw hatebreed. 

<i>thats pretty much how everything went down. weve spent almost everyday together since then. he finally asked me to be his girlfriend on our way home from a show in upstate pennsylvania. things kept moving right along, and on christmas eve he asked me to marry him. of course i said yes! its so funny because we spent a large part of our lives together, and yet our lives havent even really began yet. hopefully we will continue to have a blessed future. thank you to everyone who has wished us well.</i>


<3<3<3<3


<b>and the morals of this story are:</b>

i got off work at 1.30 *yay*. i went over to matts, and we decided to brave target. it wasnt too bad, plus my jimmy was working oooo <3. after target we rode up to my house in the hills, so i could get changed, and stop by ms elizabeths. i gave her the gifts i got her and stuff. it was nice. plus she got to meet matt again, this time on better terms lol. we only stayed there for 10 minutes or so, and then we left to come back to aberdeen to go to his grandparents work christmas party. we were mildly social there for a little while, and then we sat off in a corner and ate dinner with his grandma. that was nice. definately better then the party. after we ate we said our goodbyes and went off to look at christmas lights. we went everywhere - aberdeen, havredegrace, and churchville. which actually wasnt everywhere, but it sounded good. matts favorite house was this one that was all weird and blinkey. i thought i was going to have a seisure. we were about to go inside matts and he was like - lets wait out here for a few more minutes. so we just sat there and talked and then -

<i>he asked me to marry him</i>....

<3<3<3<3so now my hand is a little heavier :) go us lol. ooo so yeah then we went inside and watched tv for a bit and then i had to come home.  oooo and it started snowing. it was so pretty (but slippery ugh). was supposed to go to late service, but it was canceled due to the weather.

wednesday, december 25th-
got up at 730. opened presents until 9. ate and got ready to go to matts. called justin on the phone (which completely brightened my day. i thought he may just need a phone call, to let him know that he was thought of on the holiday). drove over to matts. went to matts grandparents. stayed for about and hour and a half. drove over to my dads parents. spent a few hours there. drove to my moms parents. had a really good time there <3<3<3 thats my heart - familia is where its at. left with my sister and went back to pick up matt. drove over to jimmyXedges house to exchange gifts - my best friend is the greatest boy ever. drove back to my house so matt could open his gifts and talk to my mom. took pictures with my web cam. drove back to matts to spend the night. the end.

best presents -
talking to justin. my ring. seeing my family. my new pink bible from jimmyxXx. my angels from my aunt. my camera. the presence of christ in my life.



what a great 2 days. i hope everyone else was as blessed as me . <3<3<3<3

"event","i didnt go to work this morning because the ice was too bad around my house. instead i sat in my mommas bed and told her stories for an hour. then, oddly enough i sat on the couch in my dads family room, sandwiched between my parents + the dog, and watched that old jim carrey movie about him and the vampire chick. i havent had a moment like that in years. i actually felt good, which is so very odd. for once we were actually a unit. for an hour i was consumed with love for my parents. where were these moments all my life?

my mom went into the spare bedroom to wrap presents. i followed her so i could talk to her for a while, mostly about matt. i talked for what seemed like forever, until i fell asleep on the futon. 

i wanted to go back to bed but i started to wrap the rest of my presents that were left over from last night. i just started thinking about everything that is going on right now. 

why cant i just be happy? all i ever want on christmas is to just be loved, and it always gets screwed up. so now i have someone, who loves me very much, and i dont know how to handle it. i guess its the old be careful what you wish for deal. i feel like no matter what i do, and no matter who im with, its always wrong. all i ever do is act selfishly and upset people. i know i should do the right thing and try my best to make him happy, but i feel that to do that i may have to leave him. how can someone truly be content with me, if all i do is make them cry. im so used to being the one on the receiving end. how did it end up like this? how did i become this person? can it be fixed? how? i dont know what to do anymore.

talked to an old friend. i need to go on vacation. maybe soon.

im going to go to sleep. quiet is probably good right now.

today was rather uneventful. matt and i woke up and showered and went out. we went to the town house to talk to his grandma and eat. shes so nice. i hope she likes me. im really trying to work out what we are going to do for christmas. something so simple is becoming very complicated. anywho. we got our eat on and went on our merry way. matt took me to see his aunts house. we didnt go inside, but the outside was pretty, intimidating, but pretty. we didnt do much else except come home to sleep for a tiny bit. i wasnt feeling well so i decided to leave to go to my parents house. i need to clean up and get all my christmas stuff together. *sigh* im hungry so i think im going to get off here and eat. hopefully ill be able to sleep tonight. i guess we shall see..."

woke up pretty early for us. matt missed his home depot meeting. oops! we got ready and went to bel air walmart. couldnt find anything we were looking for except matts toothpaste, so we went to aberdeen walmart instead (walmart hopping - damn we sound sooo white trash lol). guess who we saw? brian p and ex brian x. double argh. brian p at least nodded to us, ex brian x on the other hand, just looked away. whatever dude. its so childish how he is acting. its not my fault he broke his edge. if he wants to be mad that i wont date him largely because of that, well too bad. at least i have standards. anyway, i was so flustered that i hid in a clothes rack for a few minutes. trust me i do know how ridiculous that was. matt just laughed at me and gave me a hug. we walked around for a while and picked up what we needed (matts grey hoodie, toothpaste, and delaneys care bear). we were both hungry so we went and got some chinese food and then went home. we took a nap for a while and then left for the ottobar. we got there just in time for age of ruin. SOOO GOOD. we stayed for darkest hour, even though at first we werent going to, but since we got there so late, matt wanted to, and i didnt mind. after the show we talked to dan o R (who has very nice teeth ~ im bringing him a birthday cake candle next time we see him) until erin came over. now let me just say that i dont care about her and matts past, its none of my business, but from meeting her once and forming my own opinion, i dont like her. i felt she was very rude, and it was uncalled for, not to mention distasteful. im going to leave the rest of my thoughts on that to myself. we saw luke, fubu, and rick 25 at the show. it was over very early so we went home. that pretty much sums it up.


..saturday..
i got up kinda early so i could start my laundry and as usual i didnt finish it. argh. i called up jimmyXedge to tell him i was driving over to ""tha deen"" to come see him. he gave me my birthday presents - john mayer's ""room for squares"" and a tshirt (home made grey shirt with justin timberlake and rhine stones on the front, and shining star in black glittery letters on the back). greatle oozle bam boozle <-- thats me being happy ha ha. jimmy is the bestest best friend anyone could ever have .. but now back to our day. we left aberdeen and drove down to white marsh mall to go shopping. i got a much needed hair trim. i had the hairdresser laughing the whole time. we walked around alot, but didnt buy much except for my workout dvd and a present for matt. ohhh <b>parking lot drama</b> - i tried to use my keyless entry but it wouldnt work, so i was like damn my battery is dead!, i then proceeded to use my key which also didnt work, maybe cause it was someone elses silver civic and mine was two spots down lol. after white marsh we went to taco bell in bel air to get our taco salad jam on *rock*. next it was off to best buy to purchase cds and cdrs. heh i spend way too much money. im pretty sure thats all we did before came back. i went home and took a shower and packed up to go to matts. i was supposed to go to church, but matt made dinner plans for us, so i didnt go. mmm we went to mango grove. tore that ish up fo sho!!! less then 30 bucks and we ate so much. happy birthday to me :)"

i got off work at 2.30 *yay*, so i went to matts. we stopped at target to get christmas cards. i would have liked to be out longer, but we had time restraints, so i had to drop him off and leave right away. i talked to sean and alex on the way home. turns out we ARENT going to sc next weekend. oh well. i had to hurry home so i could shower etc to go out. i got ready and went over to steves. he took me to lancaster and payed for me out as my birthday present. we stopped to eat at this sit down deli called issacs. it was cute - they bring you a bowl of pickled objects as you order and all the sandwiches are named after birds. it reminded me of jane for some reason. i had a good veggie wrap :) after we ate we went over to a youth center type place for a show. it wasnt anything loud or violent, just the violet burning. the violet burning = soft, pretty, christian. i had a good time, but it made me sad. *sigh*


..thursday..
snow. snow. snow. work. prayers with olivia at lunch. more work. digging my car out of the snow at work. my house accompanied by matt to get my wallet. to overlea to rick ta lifes to get matts wallet (yeah we both have a problem with leaving them places). stuck in ricks lots in my car. to white marsh mall so matt and i could both get presents for each other. back to matts. home."

*from my sister*
<i>weird squishy pink thing, bracelets with different color beads, card</i>
*from my aunt*
<i>glass candle holder that has two parts - the front is circular with a white angel on it and the back part that holds the candle has raised stars (its one of those ones where the candle is behind the circular glass part, so that you cant see it when its lit, but it lights up whatever is on the glass), pink candle, money, card</i>

*from robbie*
<i>im supposed to be gettin something soon cause hes broke right now and cant afford to ship me anything (its ok i still luv ya)</i>


.<b>part three</b>.
~ the disappointment ~

to those of you that didnt do anything for me .. if you didnt know then thats ok. if you just forgot im really upset with you, especially if you said you were going to do something for me. i dont even care about material items! you could have just said - ""happy birthday, im glad God gave you life on this day 20 or so years ago"". whatever.


.<b>part four</b>.
~ the sadness ~

i cried on the drive to work, i cried when i first got to work, and i cried at matts. i just hate my birthday. im not ungrateful for life, not at all. its just that it always turns out bad. i remember it starting when i was in high school. the first couple years the problem was that my parents just didnt listen to me. the next year i remember, the problem was that my boyfriend at the time completely ruined it for me, no details needed. the next year i almost died. last year i was alone. this year my friends hurt me. well people that are supposed to be my ""friends"" hurt me. 

i just started thinking about the way that things have gone down between me and everyone i know this year. cruddy things people have done, and the fact that they have too much pride to try to rectify the situations. ive thought about how i have changed, and wonder if it has even been worthwhile. well i know it has been, but it just makes me sad that people cant make themselves better. that they cant just look within and above and see their faults and try to fix them. *sigh*  


anyway - happy birthday to me. to all of you that wished me well, thanks, i love and appreciate you.

*****


*my aunt and her fiance show up ~
ok, i used to really dislike my aunts fiance. he still annoys me, but he was actually being really nice to me. alot of times he acts like hes too good for me. this time just seemed different. i suppose thats good since we are going to be family in a few months. he didnt even tell too many stories this time lol.


*my moms parents and brother show up ~
my uncle is a retarded crack head. no, im serious, he is. i thought he was supposed to be in jail right now, but hes not. i dont like him because hes done bad things to my aunt and grandparents. i know some stuff he cant help, but hes demented. 

over the past few years ive been under the impression that my grandfather is uncomfortable around me. i think its because of my appearance. i guess im intimidating to some older people, and he doesnt know how to talk to me anymore. this makes me sad because i really love my grandparents.

my grandma is the ish. shes so funny. i love her. shes just classic. 


*my dads parents and older brother dont show up ~
this isnt surprising. ever since my grandma got sick a few years ago my grandfather doesnt like to bring her out. needless to say we dont see them very much. i dont feel like getting into anymore details on the situation. it breaks my heart.

my uncle didnt want to come over because my mom said he couldnt get drunk. i like my uncle alot, but that just sickened me.


*my uncle, his gf, and my cousin show up ~
ok, to make a long story short - my aunt and uncle are in the process of a divorce. its too long of a story to try and explain why. thats why my aunt wasnt over, even though my mom would still welcome her in our house. 

my uncles new gf isnt at all how i expected her to be. she seemed ok i guess. she looked kinda like a tall blonde mouse. i really shouldnt talk bad about her. she was asking me about soy milk and stuff. at least she was polite.

my cousin is gaining alot of weight, most likely due to depression, plus my aunt is big. i worry about her health. 

my uncle, is a jerk. he wasnt even in our house for 30 min, and began to insult me. 
(<i>first</i>) he has my cousin come into my family room where im watching tv. he points at me and says, ""see her face? dont ever come home looking like that"". it was something to that nature, and was refering to my piercings.
(<i>second</i>) after i changed i went into my dining room to see what my mom thought about my outfit that we (my cousin, sister, and i) picked out. he kinda leans in towards my dad and says, ""shes really lost weight"". now that may seem nice, but it wasnt. it was said in a way meaning that i was fat before, and now im decent. and no, im not taking that wrong, you have to know how he is and the tone it was said in. i was just like, ""actually ive gained weight in the past few months, i was smaller"". he just replied with something like, ""well you look better"". whatever.
(<i>third</i>) as im about to leave, he tells me to come over to him. he turns me around so my back is towards his gf. then he says to her, ""yeah, her hair used to be this long (points to the center of my back). now she just chops it off and looks like a boy"". HELLO! i may be tomboyish, but since when do i look like a male? the funny thing is his gf has as short as hair as i do.
(<i>fourth</i>) as im walking out the door he yells, ""hey christina, dont hit a tree"". seem like a harmless comment? not really. a few years ago on my 18th birthday i got in a car accident and hit a tree. i almost died. now tell me how funny and innocent that comment was.


*i change 5 times because im disgusted ~
my uncle made me feel like complete shit, and i felt the need to change. i know that im not beautiful. i dont expect other people to think that i am either. but did i deserve all that?


*matt and i go see THEY ~
what a terrible movie. i cant believe i wasted 17 of my hard earned dollars on that. its ranking up there with 8 mile on the trash meter.





so yeah, that was my day. i know it seems like i was being really negative, but i was just trying to paint an accurate picture of what happened. i am thankful for alot of things though (the short list - my mom, my family, matt, jimmy, all my other friends, the fact that justin and kelly are happy, my pets, Gods gracious gift of love, health, life, etc). i hope this entry explains why i was feeling so crappy yesterday. to anyone that i was a jerk to, i am sorry, i didnt mean it. i hope everyone had a good holiday.


love always,
christinaXmichelle

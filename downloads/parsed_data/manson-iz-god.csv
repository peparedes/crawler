lets just say things are goin as planned. so im not worreied about shawn. Life moves on, right?

---- Im changing my life around. Im not giving my heart away just like that no more, i mean it. Things will go slowly instead of quickly, I need to find someone to love. . More importantly, im not goin to get close to any body who thinks im hot, once they tell me that i try to get to know them. 

---- do you ever sometimes feel as tho your soul has been riped from your very body? i feel this way. and it gets worse n worse everyday. i just dont see me being in love with anyone. the more i venture through people , the less likley  i see my self with anyone. I feel lonley and incapable of being in love. I dont see how thats ever goin to change.

I got to many text books and shit , it sucks ass becuase i have like a bazillon. It kills me sometimes. + Shawns like 21 yrs old, so i guess theres reason to make me wait until im 18 to fuck. i axed him if he were gonna sleep around n hims said no :) and i trust him. Says he wont cheat on me either. :) thats good to know. But i dont know if i can believe he will not screw around for four years. thats a long time for somebody i got grundy a shirt for his birthday and such. hes supposed to be in shcool and stuff but hims not. Hes in 10th grade which is just good, mark gibson is in 8th grade and hes a major hottie and such :)RYAN the lil bastard has been ignorin me this year unlike last year when he wasnt , he was all into talkin to me last year but this year its like... just ignore her so im all like, yeah ok, w.e . its not like i need him to talk to me or anything . i havent talked to octavious in a while he must be having alot to do or something :( :( it makes me sad. i kinda miss him. but all works out eventualy i guess. I am in jogs this year.which is just awesomeness. BOBBYs being an ass and not talking or looking HE EVEn rOLLS HIS EYES AT ME , How FUCKIN gay is THAT ??? alot if you ask me  and i think hes just stupid and immature. Barry and sarah broke up , he was cheating on her behind his back and telling her he wasnt but he got suspicious when i was all like , yeah i talked to shawn , who caught him in the barn but didnt tell us, we heard from somebody else about that. i think i would be hurt if i found out that shawn cheated on me :(.. Ive been tired latley. Im getting my hair straightened sometime or other. It needs it anyways. And we have a shit load of fuckin rules for school this year that are just getting on my nerves.  MR DAVIS IS A COCK hes the worst princable like ever known and hes assistant princable, i could just imagein if he were PRINCIBAL. oh well. He can kiss my ass. There was a crazy ALMOST fight on the bus over people bulling people and such like that, I wanted to see it but one wouldnt fight and the other one would. Justin baker is such a hottie.

I have no desire to be apart of life much longer. ive never let it out, that  i was a cutter of my own pain from within. my arm . my legs .but isnt that the whole thing that started it?, the fact that i didnt have anybody, the fact that im alone, the fact that i have no outside prettyiness, the fact that i am a nobody. The whole issue , wasnt that about be alone ? and just not having that comfort there. Maybe? im just not sure what started it. it just happened, and its like an addiction, the addrenalin rush you get, the feeling after wards, the emotion that never has to be shown, officaly you have no emotion after that. none before because you take it out on your arm or leg, or wrists. it never matters if things change or not, becuase people just be nice so that you dont kill your self, well people, i can see through it , the fake smiles, the fake good times, the fake laughs all the fakeness. and i no longer care. i no longer have a reason. no reason to care about anybody, much less my self. myself i could deal without. so honestly why stay here for something thats not there, something thats not real, something that can just break through or can just be torn down. I am alone. and im staying that way."

"event",".. Cant wait till i go to schoo i guess, i cant wait to cry.... just cant .. crying is like cutting, such a sudden rush of adrendalyn for me. although crying gets me  , i happen to like to be alone, by myself. knowing no ones around to tell me everythings okay, is just fine by me. i was meant to be alone. alone or die early. so onward marching britney spearses .. you and your plastic boobies.. 

anyways to the REAL feelings

I made a huge cut .. about 5.5 inches s on my stomach on tha left side... it is on the right lower side. hurts like hell but not as painful as bobby has let me down. i feel like shit. and i have a feeling im sinking down into a deep depression. i cant eat anymore. food is disgusting, and i cant sleep. i must stay awake, if i sleep  i dream and if i dream its about bobby, so i dont dream. i stay busy and try to not get distracted. i just stay as busy as a motherfucker. i miss him like hell but , its not like im gonna win the fuckin brods compition between me and christina. shes very pretty. but thats okay, ill end up meeting the guy of my life and hell rock my world. .. but until then , i feel myself sinking into a deep depression, so get ready for the grey days... on ward storm clouds, get ready for a tornado of hell

any ways

 OMG holy shiz , OCTAVIOUS is so damn hott.. WAYY hotter than nicole was explaining.. tee-hee.. i have a sexy buddy .. how hot is that ? 

.. since i want to be pretty, i shallnt eat and that way ill be skinny. im kinda okay with the way my face looks... except my eye color. most people like, i hate, i want brown eyes. 

cadilacs getting bigger. shes now older and shit i guess, hell i dunno, dont keep track. atleast shes not bottle fed anymore.. 

my current outfit : panties , and black and purple bra.. how hott is that

tee-hee 
damn , im failing ... and nobody cares, which makes me just wanna fail even worse

and to top it off, i havent talked to grundy in forever. i miss him bunches, more than hell ever know. .. i just wish he could understand how much i have feelings for him. i havent talked to him .. for about three weeks now. thats so sad. it depresses me.. 

onward .. to the outside world.. lata"

"event","today, i was seriously depressed. i didnt go to school. i locked myself in my room, refusing to go to school. since i dont have a lock on my door, i shoved all of my things up agianst the door. it worked i guess since i didnt go to school. im failing school, mrs blanton told me so. its oaky though. its all because all day i cant get bobby off my mind. i day dream alot just so i can see him. im so hurt.  ive made a plan to punish my self for being so stupid. im not going to eat. its my own stupididty ive lost bobby. ive been annoying , stupid and just me. so i need to punish myself for my bad doings. thats the only thing i know to  do right now. mrs cunningham saw my cuts and wanted to talk to me and shit. i just did the -nod nod- thing like i was listiening. but i wasnt. my life so sucks right now. no true firneds or anything since ive lost all feelings for anyone. everyone ive got close to has left me. i got a little close to octavious and, hes gone, grundys gone. bobbys WAY gone. sarah - well shes her. theres no way im getting close to a chick anyways. i guess my reasoning for being on earth and on life , is to be a loner. i had a dream last night that i was all alone. i commited suicide in my dream. in my dream i lived in a trailer. so yeah. i can already tell whats going to happen and shit. but its not gonna help now to get close to anybody. it hurts and thats all ive got on my mind. im afraid to get close to anyone. i dont think i will."

MY JOURNAL

omg wow.. i miss bobby so much. i dont see how i made him that mad at me. i didnt do anything to him. i need him. i guess ill get over it but, i feel SO bad. its so rough living with out somebody who you've given your whole trust withing and love to. its hard to feel anything with all the depressed emotion. when you love someone and they dont love you back , it hurts. it hurts bad. it hurts down deep ,where feelings arent supposed to go. somewhere girls arent supposed to reach. we females are sensitive. yeah and such. and i have no feelings for grundy anywhere , whicih amazes people alot. he used to be the god in my life. ive changed. grown. became someone unknown. i dont even know my self. i cant find myself. i need a guy. and that guy i need is bobby. without him , i am so alone. i havent been the same. i hate being used. i need that special touch of a guy that i dont get. and the lyrics above explain how im feeling. so i must go.. later beotch"

"event","Hes all i talk about anymroe, its really not fair to him because all he wants to do it like , not evenlook at  me. So its not fair to make him hold on to something he dosent even like or wanna look at. i know im disgusting , so theres no reason to even try him with all his sexiness. my cat pissed on me. thats ass. nicoles lucky to have a guy like octavious , he relly cares about her. i wish i was as pretty as nicole. or skinny like emily, or pretty like her also. im failing school still and i am a loner in school. i walk the halls alone. not fair really. there as a pair of girls under wear in the hallway . it was hilarious , rodney broke up with his g/f she was crying and threatning to kill her self. rodneys hot. i like ryans smile hes cute as well. i love everything about ryan. hes just like, perfect. he has a nice body and EVERYTHING. grundy, well i cant think of him that a way even though i do because hes cute, hes sexy , nice , and hes there when no one else is , but he dosent like me that way. maybe i should go out with jeremy or robbie, i know sarah likes him, robbie dosent like me so hes out, and i dont like jeremy but he has a soft touch, that makes me want him , haha, bunz is kinda like ryan, hes just too perfect. i have a visual aid due in mrs collins. SHE IS A BITCH by the way. she hates me. everytime im in her class shes bitching over stupid shit, so i quit doing work in her class. im failing math as well. it sucks because i really need to pass math. im doing good in socail studies though, and in science and art. mrs cunnigham, my art teacher is awesome , she smokes weed. and she even gave ryan some of it for three dollars, which is two dollars cheaper, but of ocurse no bodies gonna tell, that'd be narking. which is really stupid of anybody to do. i took my sisters shirt, because she like, has the prettiest clothing. haha, and i think i need to start thinking about a job for my job shadowing thing report, sucks ass big time. i really hate sarah shes getting on my last nerve. i can tend to be annoying and whiney. but thats okay. NO ITS NOT. damn people. anyways i think i really need to think about how i act in front of people and around people and shit. it really gets me a bad name. i heard octavious is cute ^_^ hehe. i wish i could see a picture of him. he sounds adorable.. mrs hazelbaker bitched at me today bcuz she said i was talking because i was in the back of her class dancin around and making hand motions and moving my mouth lip singing. heh heh. she could have yelled  at me for disruption of calss instead of talking. stupid cunt. 

i need a life. so ill go MAKE one up, yes make it up"

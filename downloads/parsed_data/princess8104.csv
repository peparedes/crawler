I have moved out of my parent's house and into an apartment so I haven't had any access to the internet and when I was living at my parents house my sister was always on the computer.  But everything is going good in my life.  My job is going well I hopefully will be getting a raise here shortly.  I have been with the company for 6 months it's time for one.  I haven't been doing much of anything really my life really kinda sucks now that I am thinking of it.  But Cristina emailed me and told me to post and made me realize just how long it's been since I have posted.  So thank you Cristina love ya!  Much love to Kristen too!  Talk to you guys later."

"event","Hey everyone!  Yea! LJ is back.  Was worried there for awhile what with their power outage and everything.  I have been a busy little bee lately.  Between work and going out pretty much every night.  Except for the night before last night I stayed home much to my parents surprise. They asked me if I was sick I told them no I just wanted to stay home.  I played my golf game on my PS2.  A few nights ago our group all went out together and had a blast going from Slick Willie's to O'Shay's and then back to Scooby's house to drop Cristina off at her car then we went to Cody's house and then went back to Scooby's house.  That was a fun night.  No stress, no drama.  Fun was had by all.  My mom's birthday is today and I have to do the family thing tonight (blah).  I am off of work for the next 3 days.  I don't know what I am going to do with myself except bore myself to death.  Good thing is, is payday is Thursday.  Not that I am going to get any of it but whatever.  Okay well I am going to sleep now cause I am tired and just got finished wrapping my mother's presents for her.  Love ya everyone!"

"event","Fixing to go to work, not really dreading it but dreading the part about having to be alone all day in the Christmas store.  It gets so boring over there with no one to talk to.  That's why I always try and call Kristen or read my book (or smut hehe ;)) Sometimes I just sit there and twirl my thumbs and think.  Sometimes that isn't good though cause then I get to thinking too much and I don't know never mind I have to go finish getting ready for work."

"event","Hey everyone!  Haven't posted in forever.  Sorry about that.  I have been really busy lately with setting the Christmas store up at work.  And yesterday Cody and I were supposed to work in there but we got shut down!  We were told that we weren't authorized to have that space.  Lord, we were 9 times kinda pissed.  I think Cody was more pissed than I was.  But anyways, my week has been nothing but crazy.  I have lost 10 pounds so yea! for that.  My mother had to take in a dress that I am wearing today for the play ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and I got the dress last year.  :)  Then hopefully we will be back in time for the wedding but if we aren't then Shannon really wants to go to the reception.  Who knows it's all up to the timing.  I am excited though.  I haven't been able to write anymore on my book been kinda in a writing block lately so I have resorted to research right now.  Researching the witchcraft and sex scene stuff.  Okay well hope everyone is doing okay.  Talk to everyone later."

"event","Hey everyone!  Sorry I haven't posted in forever just haven't gotten on here.  I have been working nothing but mornings lately and it sucks cause I can't seem to get myself up in time to come here and post before I have to leave for work.  Oh well.  As you all know my life is going okay right now nothing bad has happened to me or rather my life doesn't suck at this particular moment.  It was good getting to hang out with Kristen a little after work tonight.  I don't ever get to see her anymore if we aren't working together and then we are in two separate stores.  But what can you do?  Let's see found out our manager is leaving and the assistant manager is getting the store so that is exciting.  We don't know yet who is going to be assistant yet though.  The Christmas store opens on Nov. 5th so that whole week after Halloween is going to be hairy trying to get all of the Halloween stuff down and setting up the Christmas store.   I am going to see my brother in Beaumont this weekend.  Hopefully he is doing well.  I miss getting to hang out with him.  I wish Halloween would get here already.  The people in the Halloween store (the customers) are getting on my nerves.  I can't help that we are out of half the stuff that these people want!  It feels weird that I am up this late and I know that I don't have to be up early tomorrow cause I am off!  :) YEA!  These morning shifts are killing me.  But you know me can't stay away from the hangout.  But I have been leaving earlier than I would have normally stayed because of the simple fact that I have to get up so damn early and get to work.  I have lost another 3 pounds!  I need to fully get back on my diet and actually start walking around my neighborhood.  The weight hopefully will start deterioating (or however you spell that damn word) fast.  Hopefully by next summer I will look really good.  I am not doing this for anyone but myself.  Personal gain is what it is all about."

"event","I haven't posted in awhile sorry.  I have been working mornings and then staying out late after work and coming home and crashing.  Only to do the whole routine over in the morning.  Blah!  But yeah the trip to the house was fun with everyone.  My thoughts have been running about a million miles a minute this past week.  I just have alot going on in my head that I don't know exactly what to do about.  One thing that sucks is that I twisted my ankle yesterday morning.  Yeah I know klutzy me.  But oh well.  It really feels weird to be at home at 9:00 at night and not be out at IHOP.  But I figured I needed a break from IHOP and I was tired and my ankle has been bothering me ever since I got off of work today.  It's really funny how things happen that you don't even expect to happen.  I don't know, that was a random thought that popped out of my brain being one of the million that are swimming around up there.  I have written down in my notebook about my feelings and that has helped some but still that hasn't helped me come to the conclusion on what to do.  Oh I had to throw away a dead hermit crab today.  That was so gross.  I used the tongs on everything I touched even the toilet paper that I was wrapping it up in was touched by the tongs.  Those things stink so bad.  :(  Cody I have your mask with me so whenever I see you next I will give it to you."

"event","Hey everyone!  I just had the best time at IHOP.  :)  When I got there Cody, Jacob, Issac and Cody's friend were there and I sat down with them and chatted awhile.  They left shortly though.  All was well.  I continued doing research for my book.  Then a very good friend of mine Allen came in and said hi to me and we talked for a few minutes and then he said that he needed to go study cause he has a big test coming up.  So again I went back to reseaching.  A little while later Kristen calls me and we talk for almost 30 minutes that was cool.  Probably an hour later, I went over to Allen's table to talk to him some more.  You know to see what he has been up to that sort of thing.  Then I let him get back to studying.  I go back to my table and read.  A couple of more hours pass by and then I decided that I was tired and I was going to go home but I went one last time over to his table and sat and talked to him.  We talked about a lot of stuff.  I don't know what it is about him but every time I talk to him I always feel better about myself and I look at life in a whole new perspective. :) He makes me want to succeed in the things that I am doing (and all that good stuff)  I don't know.  But seeing that it is 3:30 now and I left IHOP at 3:15 I need to go to bed I am tired.  :)"

I know Spike didn't mean anything by that comment that he made but I think now that I have thought about it all that it was just as Kristen told me the ""proverbial icing on the cake"" but everything is okay now I hope.  I will see all of you guys at a later date!  :)"

"event","My life feels like it is spinning out of control.  In some ways I enjoy life and then in others I feel like I am all alone in the world.  I can't seem to do anything right and everyone is pretending to be nice to me but on the inside they are really telling me to shut up or something.  I have been thinking about my life alot these past few days and I don't know how to go about changing it.  Everything about me is wrong.  I can't seem to do the right thing I don't look like the right person.  Let's not even start on the subject of how I feel about my body.  These past few months I have been trying to soul search and I feel like I am head butting a brick wall.  I don't know how I can go on living like this.  Living this way really sucks."

Um let's see what else....not much else to talk about or rather can't think cause I am really tired.  And I want to go to bed but can't yet cause I don't know why.  I miss you Cristina!

"event","Let's see my day was an interesting day.  Started off by going to the college to visit with Kristen saw a few old buddies, that was cool.  Then went to Highlands to get the last part of my perscription filled (cause I need happy pills)  LOL.  for my ADHD and then went to the cemetary to visit with my great grandmother and put some flowers on her grave.  Then I went to go and decided to pamper myself a bit and went and got a pedicure and got fingernails (YAY!)  That was fun.  Went to work at the Halloween store for about an hour and a half.  Kristen and I decided to wait for our boss to get back from vacation tomorrow cause we didn't know what the hell we were doing.  Trying to put displays up and it wasn't working.  Oh by the way Cody, I have your fangs set aside.  :)  Then I treated Kristen to dinner at Chili's and then went to Wal-Mart and got Princess Diaries 2 soundtrack cause one of my favorite songs ""Break Away"" by Kelly Clarkson is on that.  Then came home to visit with my sister.  Will be up at IHOP later though.  Toodles for now though.  :)"

I am trying to do character analysis' on my book that I am writing and can't come up with as much information as I would like.  Thanks to Spike who helped me with one of the characters.  I couldn't think anymore.  The work party that I went to tonight was a blast.  Had a ball, got a little tipsy.  But sobered up at IHOP.  :)  Oh well time to go to bed cause I have to get up and go to work early tomorrow."

"event","IHOP is always great fun. Saw the gang tonight well minus Kristen cause she had to go home early cause her mom wanted to see her.  :) Love you Kristen!  Then after the crowd died down a little Rebecca and Casey were there and we decided (me, Rebecca, Casey, Mike, Spike, and Whitney) to go to the bowling alley and play pool for awhile.  So we did that and then we went over to Rebecca's apartment to shoot darts for awhile.  Her cat scratched the hell out of my finger. :( I am so tired but I can't seem to get to sleep.  Third day staying out all night long and getting hardly any sleep.  Thank God I don't have to work tomorrow at all.  I do have a party that I am going to tomorrow night though.  Okay now that everyone is up to date on my day talk to you later! :)"

I am so glad that I have Sunday off and I can actually relax and not do anything.  But yeah the things that we learn and do at IHOP.  I am still wondering why the hell Spike decided that he had to lick my phone before giving it back to me?  Oh well. will post more later."

"event","My day was very eventful...not really...went to work, then went to IHOP, found out that drama apparently happened last night at IHOP but wasn't there to witness it so not sure on what it was exactly.  Good news from work, my store was number 3 in sign-ups for the Hallmark card for the last week that the contest was run so that was pretty awesome.  Our assistant manager is throwing us a party (with alcohol involved of course)  :)  Saw Whitney Simpson at IHOP talked to him for awhile talked about people from Barbers Hill...all in all it was a good day.  Sorry guys I forgot that you (Kristen and Cristina) can't get out in the week.  Hopefully we can get together over the weekend.  I am craving Mexican food again.  :)  (and the guys on the side)  LOL."

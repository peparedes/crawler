"event","here i am agen.. with nothing to do.. nothing in my brain.. ive had one of the most boring phone calls of my life! i was sitting there, on the phone and not talking.. i resorted to listening to the radio and waiting for my friend to talk to me about something. when i realized that nothing was gonna happen, i tried starting another conversation but all my friend answered was ""ah ok"" or ""ah yeah"" or ""oh.. pake ko? (in a non-joking way)"".. i cant believe i even tolerated that. if the better me was on the phone awhile ago, i wouldve put it down earlier. i was just ticked off cos i can't talk about anything with this friend anymore without thinking about what his/her reaction. i just really don't like it when people don't listen when i talk because i genuinely listen when they do. i mean, its alrite with me if people make me ""bara"" or joke around with things i say cos i sometimes enjoy that. i just don't like feeling that people don't care when i talk about some things and then expect me to listen and care for the things they have to say. to be really honest, i really don't enjoy talking to this friend anymore. i feel like he/she doesnt listen, doesnt care and all he/she cares about is him/herself.. the whole time i was talking to this friend, i was wishing that i was talking to someone else.. now, i feel like ive jus wasted 2-3 hours of my time.. 

i have a new favorite movie: finding neverland.. hehe i found it really nice and entertaining because of all the visual effects and the colors in the movie. i remembered how much i loved peter pan too. hehe when i was little, id pretend to be wendy and my life-sized (well, it was life sized for me that time--i was around 4-5) pink panther doll would be peter pan. haha! pathetic i know but i didnt hav any other playmates.. gem was too small so she was practically useless.. haha! 

i didnt really do much today since i woke up at 4pm. i went to guia sayao's debut yesterday and guess who i saw there?? GERA!! i saw ralph! haha but i dont think he recognized me cos i didnt really talk to him or anything.. hehe he's with therese posas pla! wlalang.. (gela, are u jealous!? haha).. it was really fun though! jacx and guia's family was so fun! super laftrip ung cousins nila.. we stayed at the hotel til like 1-2 am and we were jus drinking and laughing the nite away.. heheh! im such a bad drinker.. i didnt drink any shots but i think i got a hangover from champagne! wahaha loser! im already an adopted del rosario.. diba jacX?? hahah! ive never had so much fun in a long time..

ive been reading the da vinci code for the past month (or two) now and i still havent finished it! ive got only a few chapters left but somehow, i think i hav to go back to the start cos i totally forgot what happened in the story (damn exams! made me frget it..) 

oh oh ooh.. jax and i went to a bathroom in rustan's this afternoon and there was this woman in one cubicle who was super tagal!! she was taking uber long in the bathroom but we didnt really mind it since there were two other cubicles available anyway.. then, all of a sudden, this really loud gurgling sound came out from the cubicle followed by a stink that was worse than my fart (and i tell u, my fart's really bad na!)! hahaha pucha laftrip un.. jax was getting super dizzy while pissing!! haahhaaha

2. if i go to admu, big chance that im also getting a car cos how am i going home during the weekends if i dont hav an effin' car?!?! but, if i go to dlsu, my parents are gonna be in makati all the time.. haha!

But in 1801, his<br>confidence began to disappear as his hearing<br>slowly deteriorated, and in 1818 became<br>completely deaf. He sank into depression and<br>paranoia, and was viewed as an eccentric by<br>others. Though musical tastes had changed in<br>the 19th century (people then preferred light<br>rossini operas), Beethoven's genius as a<br>composer was still known and respected.<br>Beethoven died in early 1827 during a<br>thunderstorm. Sources say that Beethoven rose<br>up and lifted his right fist as thunder lighted<br>his room, and soon after, sank into eternal<br>sleep. His funeral was attended by around<br>30,000 people.

WHAT!?!?! whats with the rain!? and it didnt drizzle ha.. it poured! i also noticed that on the mejo right side of the screen, the rain was less intense. oh oh.. another pang-asar pa.. after they kissed under the rain, they put their arms up as if theyve just won in some olympic game! its soo not romantic... dammet.. this makes me want to go into the movie-making business more! i wanna make movies that are so much different than the crap that theyre making us watch now...... if Richard Gutierrez wasnt cute there, i wudve stepped rite out and thrown my popcorn at the screen! hahah ... oh, and Angel Locsin was fat ha! huever's planning on watching that movie-- dont na.. watch something else.. like dreamboy..

"event","what did deriz get for christmas?? out of all the things i want, i got none! hahaha i got a really nice pair of green socks though. :) its funny, the person hu gave me green socks this year is the same person who gave me orange socks last year.. haha good thing im in dire need of green socks for my new green shirt! heheheh! i cant wait to open my other presents! my family has this tradition wherein everyone has to wait til new year's eve to open their presents cos that's when the whole family's together. i guess it's nicer that way since you have more time to buy presents and you don't have to rush everything before christmas day. 

    oh yeah, i also went to intramuros 3 days ago. it's sooo nice there! last time i went there was in 1999, i think and everything still sucked. now, there are lots of nice stuff there. we had to tour some of balikbayan friends around so my parents and their friends decided to go to intramuros. i was supposed to be a ""tour guide"" but then it was also my first time there! it was funny cos i was even more awed than the balikbayans! oh oh oh and i could pass for a foreigner (oh yeah oh yeah!) haha i was talking to my friend in english and this vendor comes up to me and starts yammering in hard-up english...it was really hard up cos i couldnt understand a thing! i had to ask him to repeat in tagalog.. haha and he just looks at me in disbelief and shyly repeats what he said in tagalog. hhehehehhe   heeey.. that kinda flattered me! 

    watch aishte imasu (sp?) heheh.. its really nice.. and its not super kaduper dramatic. it wouldve been a real kilig-fest if dennis trillo wasnt gay! hehe but its a really nice movie.. i also watched the one of kris aquino.. hehe there were funny moments but then it started to get kinda dragging cos of all the time lapses. its weird tho.. they tell you that it's already after 5 years but everything's the same... then afeter 2 years, then after blah blah years... ah ewan! heheh but its cute cos of all the gay stuff.. haha! i watched two gay movies in one day! hoorah! gay power! bestfriend-- if ur reading this.. i know what ur thinking!! hahahah brandon boyd!! oh yeah!!"

    to all those who read the long entry bfore this, i suddenly had a change of heart. i don't want him anymore. ive been praying for him to improve but i guess it wud take much more than that. if he changes for the better, then maybe. but, if he doesnt, then nevermind. he may be gwapo (to other girls, i never really liked how he looks) and stuff and he may have what some girls want but i want more. i want something more internal. id rather be with someone simpler, and more down to earth. all i can really do now is just pray that he finds someone who will help him change for the better and not tolerate him. ive gotten to know his parents and theyre not really pleased with his attitude. i jus pray that he would change, become better and make his parents proud of him. they are such great people."

Thought I heard your voice yesterday
When I turned around to say
That I loved you baby
I realize, it was juss my mind
Played tricks on me

And it seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
And I just can't believe
That we're through

I miss you
There's no other way to say it
And I can't deny it
I miss you
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

Is it turning over this time
Have we really changed our minds about each 
other's love
All the feelings that we used to share
I refuse to believe
That you don't care

I miss you
There's no other way to say it
And I, and I can't deny it
I miss you
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

I've got to gather myself as together
I've been through worst kinds of weather
If it's over now
Then I'll be strong
Can't believe that you're gone
I've got to carry over

I miss you
There's no other way to say it
And I, and I can't deny it
I miss you
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

Oh there's no other way to say it
I can't deny it
I miss you baby
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

Oh no other way to say it
I miss you baby
There's no other
That you're deprived of me now
That you're deprived of me now
I miss you
Said I can't deny it
I, I, I, I miss you baby
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

"event","damn.. im depressed.. i remmber margie, jax,kath, gela and i were talking about ""voids in our lives"" and im kinda missing the void in my life.. i dont know why but its kinda hard not to. i can't really explain it but sometimes its jus really sad. i keep on wondering what it would have been like if nothing went wrong with us. it was almost perfect. we got along really well, shared the same thoughts, most of the same interests and we could talk to each other about anything and everything and there is something, a connection, that we both feel and thats what makes it hard to let go.. when u trace it to the beginning, the real reason for all our problems was only one person. and i can't get rid of this person, no matter how much i want to ( i don't really want to.. but.. ah basta! u know what i mean!). she's my mom. it's just that she can be really strict sometimes. it drives me nuts but i know naman that she's jus scared for me.i really appreciate the fact that she cares a lot for me but sometimes, i just get too strangled..sometimes, i cant breathe. it was better for both of us to separate cos if we didn't, then our lives would have been ruined. we would both get too distracted and we'd just fight a lot. sometimes, i don't know if i did the rite thing.. sometimes it feels rite, sometimes, it doesnt. i dont know if he's coming back.. i guess we'll just see. 
     oh oh oh.. dont u jus hate guys who pretend to be so polite and so nice jst so u can like them back!?!  ts so effin irritating!! there's this guy.. i wont mention his name anymore.. haha and when me and toot broke up, he started texting me and bla blah blah.. then he keeps on flattering me and shit as in its so obvious that its so fake! pucha... he's gonna go to one of the deep circles in inferno!hahaha mag-faflatter na nga lang, obvious pa! sobrang loser pa.. kasi i ditched him ( i knnw, ang sama pero u would too if u were in my place!).. we were texting him and i pretended na i was gonna go to bed na so i said, "" cge, i hav to go to sleep now. text u nalng tomorrow or something. nite!"" eh, i dont text guys first unless its soemthing super impt.. as in i wait for them to text me then i text back.. haha he was waiting daw for my text!! kakapikon!! arrgh!! and get this, he has a frgging girlfriend! srap whapakin! and are we obliged to reply to quotes?? diba hindi??? haha he was askng our other friend if i was mad at him cos i wasnt replying! what was i gonna reply?? ""thanks for the quote.. send some more later?"" tsss... do i sound mean?? cos im not mean! im just a bit irritated................................................
.................. ok, im happy na ulit! hehe im going to the gym on friday with the buffeteers (is this true ba?? cos im going if it is!)!!! im gonna buff myself up like _____buff!! oliver james rules! <--- diba margie, gela??? hahaha oh oh.. more bad news.. my ""bestfriend"" gela broke up with k-tel today... hahaha now, she's on a rebound with aisa! hahaha 0_0  im sooo bored now that ive ""released"" my anger! hahah

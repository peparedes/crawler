"event","Hey guys, Eilidh has forced me to become addicted to Warcraft online.  Being a good mom, I've addicted my son.  He had a rough weekend because of it.  It could only happen to my son.

I hear him call to me, mom I've died & I cant resurrect.  hummmm I say let me see.  I take a look and he is stuck in the ocean with no way up the cliffs to get back to his body.  He's very frustrated & no telling how long he tried to fix it before he resorted to mom.  A quick check of the map shows that he's off of an island surrounded by the same cliffs, no port to be seen!  Crap J-Mo howed you get there?  Well, he says, I wanted to see what it would be like to fall off of a waterfall...  Well, you found out didn't ya!!!  I must admit I tried for a while to scale the cliffs, but no luck.  I asked him why he didn't resurrect at the spirit healer,  ohhhh didn't think of that.  Anyway mom finally saves the day by realizing his spirit could die if he goes out to see away from the land.  well alrighty then dead spirit it is!!  Figured either it would die or he'd discover America.  This time when he died, we resurrected at the spirit healer.  

ooookkkaaayyy  crisis averted, back to throwing away J-Mo's non-played with toys.  I'm trying to empty his room so we can repaint and refinish his floors.   Boy the kid has some crap!!  uh oh  a coupla hours later there's another call from my addicted son!   (Hey this is not your kid, WoW is educational, he's already learned not to throw himself off of a cliff! 

What's it this time?  Well, J-Mo tells me he put his money & his supplies in the bank so it would be safe & it won't give it back unless he joins a guild, that costs money, which he just put in the bank!!  I look at his stats, Crap!!  not only does he not have any money, he's used his armor until it & his knife are broken!!!  He has no supplies or protection and the game doesn't have a setting for tin cup & begging for money.  huuummmm maybe they should just for this contingency.  He asked if he could just start another character, but I told him no.  Ok J-mo decides he'll go swimming with the girls after all & I sit down to figure out how to get him out of this mess.  humm he needs money & I know he can sell animals that he kills in the woods, so I take his unarmed Rogue character to the woods, he's level 6 I figure he could probably punch a level 5 to death if need be, right?!  Well the place he is located doesn't have any creatures on it, that figures.  There's a ship he can catch & it costs right, it's free!  I know it's a fictional world.  I hop the boat hoping for another town near a low level woods.  I know feeble hope.  I did find a new place but the animals were all way above his level & they keep monkey stomping his character!!  I spent lot's of time resurrecting & searching for new places.  Forget this place, I hop another boat & head anywhere else.  I end up on the continent where my character is, but I don't recognize the area at all!  and the monsters here don't even register their level, must be really high. By this time Justin comes back & tells me to keep going inland.  I told him I'm calling Missy to see if she can find him & give him something, but she's still out of town it, so no luck there.  I don't know if she could have helped anway.  I guess inland it is.  We die many times, but find a griffon that could fly him to safety, but my experience with griffons are that they costs money,  uhhh we have none of that.  I want to get back to the port & try another area, but we'd have to go through the same creatures that have been stomping his tail for the last hour.  Oh great there's a portal here, let's go anywhere's better than here.  He walks in & it declares that only level 20's can use.  Well doesn't that just figure.  Okkkaayy back through the monsters.  We head back the way we came.  Of course all of the monsters attack, but we're in luck we spot another player going in the same direction as us.  We decide to follow him so he could clear the path for us.  Eee-gads it worked  we make it back to port, with minimal deaths & his experience levels have improved in unarmed combat.  Still not killing anything though, just good a dieing.  I'm ready to hop another boat & go anywhere else,  J'mo is sick of watching & wants to try again.  He sits down & heads for a griffon, which he hops on & says I'm flying back to my normal home.  To my shock the griffon takes him!!  I said hey how'd you do that you had no money.  Oh he says they don't cost money, I ride free.  I yell you could have told me that back at the other griffon before we died our way back here!!!   oh, is his only response.  Then he shows me where the bank is that stole his stuff, then gets his things out!!! It's just the money they won't let him have.  I throw my hands up.  Of course all of his stuff is still unusable except for the hearthstone that could have taken him back home if he hadn't left it in a bank.  We go to a merchant to sell a weapon or something so he'd have money but even the merchants don't want broken stuff!  Figures, wait he has an extra pouch, we sell that, he fixes his armor, and I leave him to his fortune.   I can't believe it.  I'm going back to moving his room, crap wait I have to cook dinner.  Save me from WoW or crazy 7 yr olds.   Oh, and he's learned another lesson, don't trust banks, hahaha

And you wonder why it's hard to get anything done around the house!"

I'm still going to Dredda's graduation party, trying to get my pre-study done early so one night out won't hurt me.  Saturday when I take the test I'll find out if I was wrong.  I'm hoping there will be no problem making home that afternoon for J-mo's birthday party.  It'll be cutting it close.

"event","Well, our newest addition Nala, has gone into heat!!  crap, I knew I needed to get her to the vet, now I have to wait until she's over it.  We've kept her locked in the house, but she did manage to get out a few times, and we have a visiting white cat in the yard calling for her all the time!  ugghhhh  J-mo told me he wanted her to have kittens.  Well I don't plan on it happening, but if it does Roz u get ready because you owe me one, since you made me have Starsky!!  

on to other worries.  Sweety-Pie's right eye went cloudy, so he had to go to the vet today.  Turns out he lost a fight and was probably scratched in the eye.  He's on antibiotics & eye pain drops.  He hated going to the vet, but he did very well and didn't claw up anyone in the office.  J-mo said he deserved a kitty treat and wasn't happy until we stopped by the store and got some.  Sweety-Pie just turned his nose up at it.  haha go figure.  He has to go back on Friday to make sure it's healing.  Hopefully his vision in that I will return, we'll have to wait and see.

Take care!"

After dropping K off at a friends for the night, having a flat & Dale changing it for me, and rushing to make it before the movie started...we walked in as the Indiana Jones preview was ending, we enjoyed an awesome movie!!!   I liked it better than the last few Spiderman movies!  Great story and action."

Had a great holiday.  Loved seeing our friends and having fun just visiting.  We'll have to do it again.  Hopefully by then we'll have the painting on the house done.  I appreciated Roz trying to get me motivated to sew on new projects.  I've got the fabric now I just have to get started.  

Fireworks were great.  We did lose the top of our pool, but it needed replacing anyway.  The kids enjoyed the show!

"event","Okay I've finally made some me time to post about the Disney trip.  Bear with me I'm not as silver tongued as my swamp gorilla half.

Drive:  humm, we got on the road at 12:30 am Saturday morning so we would be at the hotel about lunch time Disney-time.  I drove the first 4 hours being that I'm a night owl.  We both took naps Friday night to be ready.  Dale had gotten some books on tape so I listened to Rogue Angel.  Pretty interesting and Saturday night I tried to get Dale to let me hear the last 35 minutes of it at the hotel (which he tried to do, bless his heart), but I feel asleep before it even got started good.  We ended up finishing it on the way home.

Saturday:  We made it to the hotel - Allstar Music with the hopes of being able to find Amber & Sveinn & lucky us Amber was at the counter when we got there.  The hotel had messed up our Magical gathering (we were supposed to be roomed next to each other) but they fixed it.  We had to drive to the parking lot to catch the buses to the parks though, since we knew we didn't want to have to carry dragging children from the bus to the room 5 buildings away.  Worked out fine though.  
Kaitlyn needed a swimsuit & they didn't have her size at the hotel, so I got directions to Walmart.  No, I never found it UUGGGHHH but 3 toll roads, a stop at McD's for directions, then settling for a Super Target that I spotted we settled on a heart one-piece.  Good thing because it was the only one that wasn't a skimpy 2 piece bicini that I refused to put her in.  We finally made it back to the hotel just in time to get to the bus to head out to our dinner reservation.  - Yes, much to Dale's chagrin I had made several reservations so that the kids could meet Disney Characters.
No park scheduled day, but we had dinner with the Princesses at the Grand Floridian.  J-mo wouldn't take pictures with anyone (kin to his daddy).  I thought Cinderella's stepmother was the coolest!  She had great facial expressions and demanded that I not 'judge her' when I had the audacity to call her an 'evil' stepmother.  I got a picture with her too!  We were tired and were in bed by 9:30 pm.  Kids loved the ride on the monorail.

Sunday:  We went to the Magic Kingdom!  The park wasn't crowded and true to kid form the kids wanted to ride splash mountain first!  We grabbed a double Disney stroller & headed out with Sveinn & Amber.  We paused only for a minute for the photo of us in front of the castle.  Kaitlyn told her dad he probably wouldn't get wet.  haha she lied!!  We met up with Sveinn & Chloe at the ride and the line up was:  Dale & K'bug in the first seat, Justin & me in the next, then Sveinn & Chloe behind us.  We actually kept the picture from the ride & we were all soaked by the time we made it off the mountain. haha  I'll try to get the picture scanned in tomorrow for you guys. J'mo, Sveinn, & myself are the only smilers!  Chloe decided there were too many dark places on that ride.  Of course my kids would ride it as many times as we were willing to wait in line!  Sveinn & family separated after Splash Mtn for more young kid-friendly rides.  We had breakfast at Cinderella's Castle & Jasmine even took a picture with Dale.  haha he looked like a body-guard.  Then on to the rides Thundermountain railroad & Space Mountain were also a great hit.  We are definitely a family of rollercoaster buffs!  J-mo did NOT like Haunted Mansion, Dale kept teasing him about riding it again that night.
This was a special night at Magic Kingdom the park stayed open until 3 am for hotel guests.  Unfortunately, we were so tired from the drive we were drooping by midnight and headed back to the hotel.  Dale was already complaining about long lines & the crowds.  For Disney it really wasn't that crowded.  

Monday: MGM definately Dale's favorite!  Everyone loved Tower of Terror!  Got fast passes for Rocking Roller Coaster, not that it did any good since that line was still an hour wait!!  Amber had gone in on the single rider line so managed to talk the kids into doing it that way & save the fast pass for later.  Sounded like a good idea at the time & the kids agreed, but the closer we got to the rollercoaster the kids started regretting their decision because they wanted to ride with us.  Single riders ride with the odd number person in a group.  We told them it was like riding with a buddy.  That worked, Dale rode first so he'd be waiting when the rest came off the ride.  It was a lot of fun, but way short for the amount of line time.  We came in later with the fast pass, and got to the ride a lot faster, but then they evacuated the building, so we didn't get to ride it.  bummed
Tried to get J-mo to become a Jedi-cadet, but he was too scared to raise his hand & try.  It was cool because the cadets got to practice sword fighting with Darth Vadar!!  He was perfectly happy with just seeing Darth Vadar from a distance.  We rode the Star Tours ride 3 times!  very cool!  We went to see the Power Rangers & Kaitlyn got her picture made with the Yellow girl one, J-mo stood in line with daddy to see the red one, but then refused to take a picture with him.  I bet you can guess how thrilled Dale was to wait in line & NOT get a picture.  We met up with Sveinn & fam at Hollywood & Vine for lunch, but they said they weren't going to stay around for the Fantasmic show that night so we moved on to the Indiana Jones Stunt show.  We had fast passes for it & showed up on time, but it was still standing room only.  Dale spotted us some seats anyway though & I thought they were great about 3 rows from the stage on the far right.  Anyway I wanted Dale to raise his hand to be part of the extras picked from the audience.  Dale wouldn't have any of that, so I started raising my hand.  I never dreamed they would pick me & when she asked for the blonde in the blue shirt I just looked around and Dale said it was me.  haha  So I hammed it up in front of an audience waved at the kids, looked scared, intimadating, and shopped on cue with the others.  We even had Ciaro outfits to wear & signed disclaimors in case we were hit by exploding trucks hahaha!  It was a lot of fun & I think the kids got a kick out of seeing me goof off up there.  J-mo had never seen the movie so they're in the living room watching it right now.  Kaitlyn & Justin both got rifles for keepsakes.  Hey I'm from MS we encourage a healthy respect for guns!  No I didn't have to kill any racoons while we were at Disney!!  Dale said one good thing about MGM was there weren't any rides to get wet on!  Well, we went on to eat dinner because there weren't any seats at the first Fantasmic show at 6:30, so we stood in line at 7pm for the 8 o'clock show.  Problem was we were going to let the kids go to the bathroom & we got separated by the crowd.  We used the cell-phones to find each other, but I couldn't get to him.  So I used the emergency lane to catch up to where they were, Dale was trapped a lone with the kids in a huge crown.  You can just imagine how great a mood he was in to be trapped in a crowd!!  Anyway Kaitlyn & I went to find seats while Dale parked the stroller & took J-mo to the bathroom.  He was surprised to see we got front row seats directly infront of the railing.  Wow, he was finally impressed!!  Now, Fantasmic is done on a big lack with an island in it.  Mickey does this great light show & characters come out on boats or on the island.  It also has images shown on sprayed water.  Yes, I said water.  It shoots straight up into the air and becomes a projector.  You should have seen the look I got from Dale as the sprayed water proceeded to douse the first 3 rows of people watching the show!!  'Oh, did I say we wouldn't get wet at MGM'  hahaha  We were soaked by the time the 25 minute show was over.  This was also late night for MGM so we got bracelets & Star Tours again & Kaitlyn & I stayed late to see Muppet 3-d & ride rides.  Dale took J-mo back to the hotel.

Tuesday:  We had breakfast at the Polynesian Hotel with Lilo & Stitch at 7:30 am.  Justin actually hugged Stitch & took pictures with him.  This was Epcot day.  We rode Mission Space, Test Track, visited Figment & his show while Dale rested, met up with Dale for Honey I shrunk the Audience, saw the underseas with Nemo & did Turtle talk with Crush.  We walked around the world & got autographs, listend to the Kodo drummers in Japan, stopped to see the lame belly dancer at Morrocco, she just couldn't compare to Roz!  Met up with Sveinn & Amber at Princess Storybook for dinner.  Then rode 'the best ride in the park' according to the Norwegian waitress.  It was called Maelstrom in Norway.  It turned out to be just a boat ride, good thing was everyone got to go in the same boat including little Emily.  Well, Dale et al were done with the park by 7:30 so they went back to the hotel.  Kaitlyn decided she wanted to hang with me the die-hard park hopper!  We stood in an hour-long line for Soarin, which was awesome! then hopped over to Magic Kingdom for Splash Mtn & Thunder railroad.  

Wednesday: Dale still said MGM was his favorite, so we headed back to MGM & saw the Lights, Action, Motor cars Stunt show.  Dale loved that one!  Still couldn't get justin to fight with Darth Vadar so after Muppet 3-d we hopped over to Epcot for Chinese food & got Mulan's autograph.  Dale was done & went back to the hotel with the kids to swim.  I hopped over to Animal Kingdom that was doing they're late night for guests & road Mnt Everest 5 times in a row with single rider line.  Awesome awesome awesome!  Definately my new favorite ride.  Then rode Dinasaur & Primevil Whirl & drug my tired but home.  Good thing I left early my lovely husband had locked himself out of the room and was hanging out with Sveinn drinking in the park in front of our room.  I was lucky he was still able to walk to the room!  He said the kids would wake up even when he beat on the windows & door.  haha guess they were really tired too!  We were still in bed by midnight so by SCA standards we were really being wusses.

Thursday:  Last day at the parks.  The family went to Animal Kingdom and rode all the rides I'd riden the night before.  We also went to It's tough to be a bug; thankfully with a fast pass.  We had Thanksgiving lunch at the Rainforest Cafe'.  Which was awesome! the kids loved the elephants & gorillas coming alive.  Dale even got a picture with the gorillas. It was too funny the gorilla turned as if looking at him when I took his picture!  Yet again, Dale went to hang out at the hotel.  The kids opted to go with me back to Magic Kingdom for a last night of rides.  We rode all of our favorites, don't think I mentioned Buzz lightyear, then watched Spectral Magic parade by the main entrance.  I think the kids liked that as the finally.  Then were in bed by 11.  

Friday:  We checked out early & still had 2 counter meals left on our pre-paid dining plan.  Man, I can't tell you how hard it was to eat all of the meals that was on that plan!! definately the way to go.  We ate breakfast at the hotel, then went to Downtown Disney.  Even though it was black friday we got there early enough that it wasn't horribly crowded, yet!  Got Dale a last minute Grumpy t-shirt to celebrate his stay, then we had lunch at a sub-sandwich place to finish off the dining.  We were on the road for home by 11:30.  Still didn't make it in until 9:30 pm.  I managed to stay awake to get some grades done for school  You know I didn't take homework with me on vacation.  

Saturday:  You say rest up after the trip, right?!  Nope, we're still trying to get our house done so Dale painted the porch room (ceilings & walls) & I painted the 2 walk in closets (ceilings & walls)  

Man I'm beat!!  My feet hurt before, but now my arms hurt too!  I think I need a vacation!!

Good news though, we ate constantly it seemed because of the dining package, and I didn't deny myself the desserts that came with it.  However, I was definately power walking everywhere.  When I weighed in Saturday morning I had only gained 2 pounds!!  I trade 2 pounds for all of that any day.

I hope everyone else had a great week too!!

Love ya,

"event","Well, I've been extremely busy lately between school & the house, but I decided I wanted to go to an event that I could be laid back (and ok take a protege).  So even though I should have stayed home worked on the house and caught up on grades, I went to LA.  

I wanted to get out of town early so it wouldn't be late when we got there & have more time visiting.  Of course that didn't happen.  The contractor told me he needed the toilet & fixtures for the bathroom by Monday, so he could finish (and I really want him to finish it!)  Instead of rushing home after school I went to City Building Supply and found everything I needed as well as a window insert (non-opening) so there'd be some natural lighting in the bathroom.  That put us leaving the house at 5:30 with starving kids and me.  That meant a 30 min stop at a ""fast food"" drivethru. uggghhhh.  We managed to get to site at 10:30, which I guess was in the scheme of things.

Kids were asleep when we arrived so I made the beds with them sleeping in the car then poured them into bed.  Went out and found friends so that I could hang out until 2 am.  Ok, definitely not a Seth, but for me that's pretty good.  Yes, I had to listen to witty comments about how Elvira was doing.  I may never live wearing that Elvira costume down!  So I crawled into bed with Justin hoping to sleep late since I didn't have any need to be up on Saturday.  Of course I have 2 children who won't let that happen, so by 7:30 I had the children dressed and eating breakfast.  Yes, that meant I was beat, but the thought of a nap during children's activities sounded good to me.  I purposefully did not sign up for the assasin's tourney for that very reason.  But no that wouldn't work with Eilidh the Assasination nazi on the ball.  She convinced me to sign up, so I made Roz sign up too.  Wasn't going down that path alone.  Edward had complained that morning that only 2 people had signed up, but by the time Eilidh had finished there were 50 people playing. You know me if I'm playing I'm all in.  My first mark was someone named Alianora, I had to figure out who that was while watching out for someone after me.  I finally found her, lol, it was Magdalena's daughter Allegra.  She was an easy kill I found her walking up the road with her sister and asked her if children's activities was breaking up (she had been with me when I'd signed mine in).  She stopped and talked with me, so I killed her easily.  hehehe  That started me getting into the swing of things.  My next mark was a girl named Aria.  I found out who she was (she was sitting by the fighting field), but as I walked over to her I noticed this little four year old walking toward me with an evil look and a dagger in hand.  Crap, he was after me!  I couldn't get my mark because he was near her.  He looked like he was about to cry when I took off in the other direction.  I saw him pout and run for a lady that I assume was his mom.  I couldn't help it, I didn't want to die that early!!  So I noticed they were following me so I ran into the yurt cabin, cut through the back, and headed straight back to the field and my mark.  I did note I didn't see the evil zombie kid with the dagger!  I came up behind Aria and slit her throat. hehehe She then gave me a fighter's name.  He was talking to Mo'tan on the side of the field.  I walked up behind him and slit his throat.  I noticed that Baroness Barbara got them moment on her camera.  haha  this was getting fun.  He gave me Fergus's name, lol, that was easy, he was by the field too and I knew who he was, sweet.  I went up to him and sliced him across his belly, saying your dead.  He said no I'm not (Oh crap I realized they must have given a skin contact rule to the poison daggers), so I sliced he throught before he could blink. He sighed and said ok, now I am.  hahaha still going... He gave me Sir Loric's name!  Cool he's on the field too this was going to be easy.  Then I noticed the zombie kid had made it back to the field and was heading my way!! oh crap!  I ran to the opposite end of the field to keep our distance, but he was following me around.  I wasn't close enough to get to Loric now and if I moved on Loric, the kid could catch me!  I was debating on whether I she try for Loric anyway, I could easily out run the kid and his mom, when Patty's daughter, Denise kille me!!!  I was in shock, what, you can't have me the zombie kid is stalking me!  She laughs and lets me know she killed him by the yurt.  Man, I forgot that could happen!  Still it was a cool run and a lot of fun.  Now everybody know a child's mentality?  One track mind.  Like a ghost with his last desires keeping him going!  While I was standing there with my jaw open, zombie kid came up behind me and cut me with his dagger.  I was surprised then tickled that he actually got to get me (even though a little late), so I scouped him up and said ""you got me"" and kissed his neck.  You could tell he was tickled!!  Seemed like a sweet kid, I was glad he didn't have to be disappointed by not getting me.  

Hey things were back on track, I had played for Eilidh and could still get that nap, but crap it was almost lunch time, so I got the kids and got them lunch.  Plenty of time for a nap when they went back to children's activities, but I had agreed to help with the children's scavenger hunt.  Silwyth from our group shows up at lunch and says he heard he'd missed the assassin's tourney and that they were going to have another after lunch.  He really wanted a chance to kill me himself.  I laughed, we had held a tourney a couple of years ago and he had failed at killing me then and he wanted a re-match.  You know me I can't pass up a challenge even if I am tired!  The new tourney would start at 3pm and that would give me time to help with the children.  Their scavenger hunt was finding bugs!! plastic thank goodness!  It was like an Easter egg hunt for bugs. haha  The kids had a blast and both of mine came home with a ton of bugs that they're very proud of.  Then started the A.T.  

I knew my first mark, but didn't know who had me and he was with two other assassins.  I decided to try to go to Ashi's leather shoe class.  I noticed my mark was following me, so I wondered if one of them had my name.  (Oh, I had changed garb between A.T.'s so I could throw off people if they didn't know me (I know, not likely).  On my way to Ashi's class I saw Patty running away from some kids, she saw me and asked me if I was still alive.  I said yes and she asked me if I knew this person and showed me her card.  It was Silwyth.  (Evil grin)  Why yes, I know him and I pointed her straight at him, he was qualifying for fencing!  I chuckled and when on to Ashi's class.  I was trying to pay attention to Ashi's class, but it's hard trying not to be close to people and take part.  I did bring home notes and told him later I wanted to take it again.  Bethany's son, Kenny, came into the class and tried to kill Brigit, not my mark, but her boyfriend, Griffin, stabbed the boy to defend her, and he is my mark!  During this A.T. if you defended and stabbed your attacker, they had to go to the basketball court, before they could come after you again!  plus if you killed your mark, they then got to be part of your mercenaries and could kill your marks for you.  Cool plus!  Anyway as Kenny distracted my mark, I came up behind him to kill him, but he realized it and started trying to get me, so I was deflecting and stabbing for skin, but he was totally covered but for his face.  I was flailing and closed my eyes because he was slashing at me.  That's a bad idea by the way, I ended up stabbing the poor guy in the eye!  I was mortified.  He was having trouble finding his contact.  When everything settled, Ashi (who was also an assassin) killed Kenny by getting Kenny to come look at a shoe to see if it would fit him.  Griffin found his contact under his eyelid & was non-the-worse for the abuse he'd taken.  He did cover his eye everytime he came near me after that.  He gave me my new mark, which was Ashi!  sweet, already in the room with him.   I just went up to him and at the last second he realized I was after him, but I sliced his hand before he could get me!  He was now a merc for me and I went after Lady Agnes, who I had seen getting a ready for a shower before all this business started.  When I went looking for her I found her chasing an 11 year old at a full run!  Wow, I thought maybe she'd be tired out by the time I got to her because I knew I couldn't out run her. lol  I figured she figure out I was after her but she was so intent on killing hers that she didn't notice me catch up to them.  I killed her just after she'd kill the younger girl.  I then enherited her daughter as my next mark.  She had been doing well and had several mercs with her that sent me twice to the basketball court!  Agnes was now a merc for me as well and couldn't get anywhere near her daughter either.  I went back to Ashi for help.  He said no problem, Beth likes him.  He was right.  He walked right up to her and killed her before she knew danger was near her.  ha sweet!!  We then had to get a young guy named Eric.  Another runner (homey doesn't run), my running merc was Agnes, she, Beth, and Ashi went after Eric.  Agnes trapped in the brush of the woods and got him for me!  Sweet!!  Oh I forgot to mention I figured out Aria, which I had killed during the first A.T. had come after me, so I knew she had my name.  I had been doing very well at avoiding her and she obviously didn't have any mercs, since she hadn't gotten to me.  She was the mark that Eric gave to me.  My merc's took her out for me as well.  That made me winner of the 2nd Assassin's Tourney!!  woohoo  It was a lot of fun, but it ended at the end of children's activities, which meant nap time was not an option and it was almost time for court!  I did take great pleasure in letting Silwyth know my hand in his demise. -smile

Making the protege' of Bethany Bacon happened without a hitch.  Magdalena was there with me, had hoped on Kris too, but they are tyring to sell their home.  Bethany & he family went home after court and we went on to feast.  Which was awesome.  Kaitlyn & Kate served drinks and sat with a couple of time to get a quick bite.  They stayed up for roasting marshmellows at Eilidh & Edwards tent, then went to bed without arguement.  I continued on, shared out the margaritas I had so I only got one glass, then Patty fixed me 2 of her frozen daiqairis.  Then we relaxed at the fire pit to hear Elazar stories.  The only song I heard was from Eilidh ""Ghost Rhino's"".  Finally got to bed around 2 am again.  Boy, it was a long ride home!

Great event though.  Felt like I'd met a lot of people, which I probably wouldn't have if I hadn't taken part in the Assassin's Tourney."

"event","My husband love me!! We decided to try a different restaurant than our standard Mexican or Chinese.  Dale took me and the kids to a Japanese restaurant in H'burg.  Loved everything from the soup I only got a taste of because Kaitlyn liked it and took it all, to the sushi appetizers which Justin despised and announced he hated this food (more for us), to the shrimp teriyaki main course!  All of it rocked!  Even Justin decided he loved the place when his chicken teriyaki kids meal got there and he liked everything.  Since it was my birthday we ended the meal with fried icecream over pound cake.  The four of us shared it which was a good thing since it was a huge bowl.  I definately feel like I've had a weeklong setback on my diet.

Then when went to see ""The Rock"" in The Game Plan.  I thought it was hilarious in spots & cried, so I guess that makes for a good movie.  Of course I still cry at Shirly Temple movies.

Overall a great birthday!"

"event","Well I went to see Harry Potter without the kids thanks to my husband.  I didn't want them to go because the book was intense & I didn't want it to scare them.  I needn't have bothered though, they cut out so much of the book that it wasn't frightening.  I liked the new headmaster, but everyone else got shafted on screenplay.  I feel that if you haven't read the book you'll be lost as to what's going on and what the wizards in training can do now.
Of course that means your basic non-reading movie goer will be blissfully ignorant that they've missed anything.  The special effects were great!

Just biding my time until July 21st!"

Kaitlyn's shocked look as she went bouncing off the screen door trying to come inside.   (Yes, I laughed before I asked her if she was okay)

Lillian & Kaitlyn deciding it would be cool to grease the hot tub down with baby oil...and Roz almost killing herself when she figured out what they'd done!   

Colc stripping to the buff and running around the condo as we non-chalantly ignore him with our drinks in hand.

Lillian bringing down a kite by pulling the string down hand over fist; then Fergus giving up on the hopeless knot.  It only took a couple of determined pelicans to untangle the jumbled mess.   (Yes, Eilidh & I are that patient; and obviously a great team.)

Me having a flash back when the restaurant we walked to had a working game of Galaga that I just had to play!  Yes, I still sucked; but it was great trying to meet those challenge stages.  (never did capture an extra starship)

Watching Fergus bury Colc in the sand; then me turning the sand into a merman tail.  Colc helped of course!

Ken running toward the surf to get his feet in the water; then making an about face and racing back to the dry sand to get away from it!

Having a wave slam me into Dale; which is where I wanted to be in the first place.  :o)

It was a lot of fun and a lot of great memories!"

"event","Tuesday afternoon Kaitlyn fell off a trampoline at a friend's house and broke her arm just below the elbow.  Of course my family doctor was already closed, so I took her to the after hours clinic (figured I'd get her seen there quicker than ER).  She screamed and cried the entire trip; the only time I could get her to stop was when she was telling my what had happened.  So I tried to get her to talk about it as much as I could.  There was noone in the waiting room so we got sent back quickly (it's the same place she went when she broke her hand doing flips with another neighbor).  I tried to warn her about the x-rays.  She howled when they tried to straighten her arm out for them; and got worse when they tried to rotate her thumb for a different angle.  I felt so bad for her.  The docter was the same one that had delivered her, when he retired from his own practice he took a job with the after hours clinic.  He wouldn't even explain anything, said a bone specialist was coming over from the ER.  The doctor said she would have to have a partial splint cast from shoulder to wrist.  They didn't want to do a full cast because of the dangers from swelling.  (I found out from a coworker that her niece lost part of her arm because of a full arm cast!  Due to swelling.)  They gave her codeine and she had to wait over night to get the partial cast put on,  She was taking codeine as often as possible for a couple of days, but now she only takes it 3 times a day.  Just complains of itching now.  The doctor said if I had broken my arm the same way I would have had to have surgery, but her bone's still growing so it should heal fine.  The neighbor felt so bad they took down the trampoline.  It was broken anyway and she was the third accident on it.  The bad part is now I find myself having to do her homework, or at least the writing for her.  She's really very smart.  It's great to hear her think out loud so she can tell me what to write.  She has a friend helping her in class.  She can't even wiggle 3 of her fingers on her right hand yet.  I told her to keep trying to, she should be able to in 2 weeks or so.  She's very sensative to being uncomfortable.  I'm sure none of you had noticed that.

On another proud mama note:
She made Principal's List on her report card (all A's)
Justin made Honor Roll, he had 1 B.  
Can you read the pride in my typing?  Now if I can just get Justin to keep his name off the board!"

"event","I did take the kids to Pep's Point.  This is a water park.  I was a little nervous because Justin doesn't like to wear floaties anymore, but he also doesn't swim well.  He can tread water and swims under water like a frog.  They had a section that was child sized that Justin liked because it had a slide, but mostly they jumped off the pier just to climb back out and do it again.  Of course the biggest hit was the water slides.  We did it together, I teamed up with each of them, and they eventually did it on their own so I could sit in the peanut gallery and watch them go.  It was a lot of fun.  The kids say we'll have to do it again with daddy, so look out Dale one day of your visit home is already taken."

"event","Well Kaitlyn's mad because I won't take her to Pep's Point water park today.  I told her we'd plan for Wednesday.  I need to takle Justin & her room and de-clutter.  We have to run out today & get a replacement net for the pool the old one finally died.  Justin's playing Knights Kingdom on the internet.  It's a lego online game.  He definitely finds some cool games.  Justin told Kaitlyn last night when she was complaining about having a hard time playing the Jedi game. ""You watch tv & I play the computer!""  He's too funny.

Later"

"event","Well Easter has come and gone.  I'm feeling kinda down about it.  It would have been a lot better with Dale home.  Plus, Kaitlyn spent the night at a friends tonight so it's kinda lonely.  Not that Justin is gone or anything, but he spent most of the afternoon playing games on the computer, then requested I fix the den tv to show cartoons that he wanted.  I didn't see him except to stop for a burger on white bread.  Had to disappoint him with no actual buns.  ha  Figured he'd get over it.  Anyway he brought his sweetie pie pillow to me and asked me to stitch him up.  He loves on his cat pillow so much that he keeps ripping the stitches out at his neck.  So I stitched his neck & ear.  Then fixed a hole in his pants with a Mickey Mouse patch.  I know boring stuff.  

I tried to move the pool back in line today.  No luck, that sucker's heavy even with no water in it.  I tried to call Robert, but only got the answer machine. They must be working on the coast again.  I'll just email them to see if they can help.

Kaitlyn had a sun burn when she came home from the birthday/swimming party.  I told her she should have put on sunscreen.  Then put on some blue aloe cream to soothe it.  It still bothered he slightly this morning, but the redness had gone down a lot.  She went to spend the night with Arianna today and I told her to wear a shirt if she went swimming again.  (of course she didn't)  How do I know?  She called me 3 times apparently just to chat.  My sweetie missed me.

Speaking of sweetie, I heard from Dale at lunch.  It's so good to hear his voice.  The kids talk about him all the time.  Justin asked me today why daddy didn't come home for weekends anymore.  I told him he was in another country, too far away.  I don't think he understands that he's not at Camp Shelby anymore.  He still asks me if he's where the tanks are.  We both try to explain it to him, but he just knows he wants him to come home.  I must say, I know how he feels.

We'll it's getting late.  Maybe I'll feel better tomorrow."

"event","Well, I tried to make a picture disc for mom and her computer won't recognize it.  I'll look at what's wrong when I go home.  I'm glad now that I left the finished kitchen pictures on my camera so I could show mom from that.  The trip to mom's was uneventful, Kaitlyn slept the entire way.  Justin kept me company though.  They were both very well behavedk.  Got to see Sheri for a bit before she left for work, then mom, Leah, Kaitlyn, Justin and I went to see ""The Wild"" at the movies.  The kids stayed interested the entire time.  I only had to hush Justin a few times,  he's kin to me and likes to talk during a movie. Then Justin got his feet stuck in his seats and even I had a time getting him unstuck.  I thought about just telling him 'you did it stay that way till the lights come back on, but I was afraid the whailing would start next.  I did manage to get him out and didn't even lose his shoes.  The rest of the movie was without incident.  

Mom said Marci wouldn't get here until after 8 so I gave up on getting home at a reasonable hour.  I just helped her bring in her stuff, so I'm going to go visit for  a while.  She had a Jackson County Katrina documentary book (like mine from Jones County). I can't wait to look through it.

I told Dale last night to call on my cell, cause I would be here until after dark.  I guess I knew something would keep me.  Mom did try to get me to stay the night, but I'd rather go home after dark than drive early.  Kaitlyn has a birthday part to go to tomorrow.  She'd freak if she missed it.  I'm looking forward to Easter, but I still haven't managed to get Easter baskets for the kids.  They're always with me.  I did sneak Justin 3 presents while we were at Target.  He never was the wiser."

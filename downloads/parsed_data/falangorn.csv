<i>The Scarlet Pimpernel

Hunt for the man
Comb the city, every street, every grate
Put a guard at every gate
Drag him out, shout the moment that you find him!
Damn!
Knock in the doors, lock up the city
Track him down through this town
And be quick about it...now!
How the devil do I ever prevail when I'm only a man?
I can never be duped by this scurrilous phantom again

I wasn't born to walk on water
I wasn't born to sack and slaughter
But on my soul, I wasn't born
To stoop, to scorn, and knuckle under
A man can learn to steal some thunder
A man can learn to work some wonder
And when the gauntlet's down,
It's time to rise and climb the sky 
And soon the moon will smoulder
And the winds will drive
Yes, a man grows older but his soul remains alive
All those tremulous stars still glitter
And I will survive!
Let my heart grow colder and as bitter as a falcon in the dive!

There was a dream, a dying ember
There was a dream, I don't remember
But I will resurrect that dream
Though rivers stream and hills grow steeper
For here in hell where life gets cheaper
Oh, here in hell the blood runs deeper
And when the final duel is near
I'll lift my spear and fly
Piercing into the sky and higher
And the strong will thrive
Yes, the weak will cower while the fittest will survive
If we wait for the darkest hour
Till we spring alive
Then with claws of fire, we devour like a falcon in the dive!

These are the days! Yes!
Days of glory, days of rage, and the dream
And the dream of Paris preys on my bones
Gnawing night and day and clawing through my brain and
No, never bend! Never kneel!
Rend him to bits! Bite!
Now, the beauty of the fight
I'm not a man to hunger for blood, but the spirit can cry
To be younger and fiercer and fly
Piercing into the sky and higher
And the strong will thrive
Yes, the weak will cower while the fittest will survive
If we wait for the darkest hour
Till we spring alive
Then with claws of fire, we devour like a falcon in the dive!</i>"

"event","The battle has kept me from writing here; finally there seems to be a break in the line that I may linger long enough to put these words down. Conditions at the front are not terrible, though I can sense morale has slipped these past few days. First the clanking, terrible war machines that lent a new meaning to the word 'destruction', now we turn our swords among innocent peasants fallen under the hag's spell. No good can come of this, it is a slaughter - not a battle, and the troops know it. I pray that soon we may break through the aerial defenses and attack the Citadel directly, though unseasonable - and likely magical - bad weather keeps the troops grounded. I fear also the toll that this battle will take upon our home, already shaken by the pangs of battle not yet a year ago. Certainly Kass has not attended to it with the care and love that we had! It is a tangible symbol of his stolen sovereignty, and no doubt before long he will wish it gone. 

The outlook is bleak, but I have faith that soon our fate will change."

Two nights ago, as the red light fell to black, and the signal fires were lit all along the Citadel walls, I saw something strange - or rather it was the lack of something that I noticed first. The silken banners of Lord Darigan were gone, the spires of the Citadel strangely naked without their adornments. And as I neared I saw a commotion gathered at the Academy where I, my father, and generations before me had been trained in the art of war. There was Kass, smug amidst the smoke and rubble of what was once the Academy's great hall, the confused and angry ranks eyeing him suspiciously. 

You may think me a coward for turning back to the shadows, rather than challenging Kass outright, but you would be wrong. He is supported by his guard and his followers, to attack him would be suicide. No, I have a far better plan; more ignoble in the short term, perhaps, but in the end I believe we will restore the rightful ruler to the throne. 

I dare not write here the location to which I will bring my troops; those who have shown loyalty and candor will be given the signal to join me later. All intruders will be repelled and no quarter given to spies or traitors."

Good heavens above, this is awful! I have been searching the Citadel from flags to floor but I can find no trace of Ripper.

I speak very little Drackonack, but I am firmly certain that dear Ripper was never unhappy with me. Could someone have stolen into the Citadel in the depths of night to take him away?

Ah, what a relief it is to be within these Citadel walls once more! Though at times I may find them stifling, after two weeks of battle I am more than happy to rest my weary wings.

While I cannot divulge too much detail, a small band of pirates were sighted above the bay. A small squadron of soldiers were dispatched to run them off, only to be surprised by the rest of the brigands who were lying in wait. Reinforcements were necessary, the dense terrain and the less than noble nature of the enemy made the battle unexpectedly difficult.

Our superior numbers and equipment soon sent the churls fleeing for the hills, with little more than minor scuffles all around. 

It is with anticipation that I return to find our gardens nearing completion, for the Lady Ketawyen I know is fond of the black roses, and with luck they should soon be in the full bloom of summer. The thought had crossed my mind, of course, that I could take them to her, but this idea sends tremors of fear through my very bones. How is it that I can face death without flinching above the battlefields, and at the same time become a trembling fledgling at the memory of the sunlight upon her wings?

I must away, Ripper is needing to be fed.

As is the way of things, life seems to be returning to something like normal around the Citadel. Of course, hushed rumors echo in the corridors that with the destruction of the Orb, that our kingdom will never again know its former glory. To this I say, ""Rubbish!"" There is no shame in our appearance, fierce though it may be, possessed of a certain savage beauty... particularly the female Eyries... ah, but I wander again.

For reasons beyond my comprehension, someone (I shall not name names) brought a wretched Turmac into the Citadel yesterday evening. The beast is an unholy terror, eating anything within its grasp and leaving puddles on the fine stonework floors. Thank goodness Ripper hasn't yet come across it, I imagine they would take instant dislike to one another. It has, quite appropriately I think, been named ""Skarl"" for the time being.

As you, Gentle Reader, have undoubtedly heard, our revered Lord has not exactly been feeling himself of late.

Following our triumphant victory over the forces of Meridell, our Lord has been acting in a most peculiar manner. This culminated some weeks ago when he appeared to erupt in living flame. (You cannot imagine the chaos this caused with the furnishings.) He has similarly become rather larger than his usual height, and must be confined to the larger chambers of the Citadel. Perhaps most un-nerving of all, he has taken to spontaneous and raucous outburts of maniacal laughter, and he seems to do so at the most inappropriate moments. For example, two days past the cook appeared to explain the substitution of the Kau steaks that were on that evening's menu; when his Lordship suddenly burst out in an eerie cackle, muttering about raining fire and destruction from above.

Please do not mistake my frankness for doubt or uncertainty; my loyalty has been tested before and it surely will be tested hence. I feel that in this, his time of need, I am given the chance to prove the mettle of my character.

The morning past we were concerned to find His Lordship nowhere within the Citadel. Harried with worry, I sent scouts to try and locate him, and to my surprise, received word back that he was engaged in a great battle.

A great battle, without including us! 

His Lordship was splendid to see, his noble profile licked in dancing flame as he struck down wave after wave of attackers. I and his most trusted advisors gathered around to watch, but were helpless to turn back the tide of angry peasants. The fighting raged all day and into the night, and it was only on the afternoon of the following day that our Lord's strength began to fail him, and he collapsed upon the ground with a great shuddering. 

It took an effort by all to bring him safely back to the Citadel, and he now rests within his impromptu chambers. He is slowly recuperating, although his mood does not seem to have improved with his health, as I learned when I entered to deliver one of the bushels of flowers that his well-wishers have left on the Citadel doorstep. 

All in all, a shaking experience, but we are all the wiser for it, I suppose. One day we shall look back fondly and say, ""My Lord, do you remember when you caught on fire and tried to destroy everything? Ah, those were the days.""

I shall take my leave now, for this entry grows long, and still more flowers accumulate on the landing.

Yours, 
Falangorn"

I had a lovely surprise this morning, OneDayMore came to the Citadel to visit. Quite a lady, she is ~ her rather cheerful exterior hides a warrior's heart. She fought for our Lord Darigan during the battle to reclaim the Orb, and has a few scars to show for it (with much pride, of course). After a pleasant brunch, she revealed the true motive of her visit: She had brought along her weapons. 

""I'm not using these now,"" she explained. ""Why don't you keep them?"" 

She opened her satchel to reveal a fine armory, indeed. I must confess to a pang of jealousy, but as it is now my turn to wield them, that soon faded. I am eager to test my skills ~ and theirs ~ against a worthy opponent.

Now, if only I could come across a set that would fit Ripper's paws...

Today is, of course, Shoyru Day. A peculiar species, in my opinion, but not one shared by many it would seem. They possess some of the darkened grace of our Lord Darigan, with their horn-tipped wings, but then they seem to lose it all somewhere with the giant eyes and round heads. Their apparent popularity is, frankly, mystifying to me.

Though perhaps not a fair analysis, as I've only met few individual Shoyrus ~ one of whom, being a mutant, is surely not representative of the species as a whole. There is one, Lord Severus by name, who often takes tea with Lord Malfoy, and he seems a noble fellow, if a little strange. I dare not say so while his owner is present, she has a great many curses and magical scrolls that make even my heart quiver with dread. 

And of course, the famous Antorcha, whom I have not had the honor to meet first-hand, but I saw her often above the fields of battle. Follower of the traitorous Skarl she may be, but a bold and fearless fighter, and she has my respect for that. No doubt our victory would have been even more complete were she not in their ranks. 

Later I shall write a little more about myself, my history and such, but I must away, as dear little Ripper is eating the curtains.

"event","Today a plan was set in motion.
Not a World Domination sort fo plan (though that may be in the works, rather a fix my teeth so I can fix other issues type plan.  By the way, you should ALWAYS floss, believe me, you don't want to learn teh way I have had to.
Dental cleaning went okay, a little disconcerting considering they use a sharp metal implement and scrape it alng your teeth, if a snag is hit, they pull harder.  I'll never loko at fishing the same away again.


Today's philisophical drivle:

Members of a Policing Force (Deputy Sheiff Dpt., County Police, City Police, etc.) violating the law:

Personnaly I feel that those charged with enforcing the law should be held up as examples of the law they so nobly serve.  They must be paragons of what is the law of the land; they should at all times be setting an example, both while in uniform and out.  Else, by what right do they judge (yes, officers of the law do judge your actions) the actions of others?
I consent that officers of teh law are, by their very nature human and subject to the frailties of the human condition.  Each must struggle daily with doing what is right and not giving in to the temptation to make an exception regardless of recompense.  We all face that challenge, it is entirely possible that a person might be the clerk of a store, facing the temptation to skim the till.  The doctor faces the temptation to molest a patient, etc.  There are repercutions for these breeches of trust, often based on the occupation of the violator.  Every industry has it's own method of self-correction and enforcement of the rules set down for all.  For many this is the Police.
However, the policies for self-correction within most law enforcement agencies I have personally dealt with are disorganized.  Seemingly in an attempt to discourage people from lodging complaints about the department. For example, the Fulton County Police Department requires that you lodge the complaint with the offending officer's supervisor.  If the person isn't in, you must call again when they are on duty, nobody else will hear the complaint.  This is rediculous, and seemingly serves no purpose other than to discourage the average citizen from taking an active role in helping the Police department from improving itself and dealing with issues of the officers.
Perhaps this is due to the reactionary nature of most individuals.  Very few folks take receiving a citation well, they often become flustered and angry, because they got caught.  They might seek to revenge this ""wrong doing"" by lodging a complaint against the officer, seeking to discredit them or at the very least blow off some steam.  This is childish behavior and should not be tolerated, so before calling your local law enforecemtn agency and ldging a complaint, ask yourself this ""Why am I calling to complain?  Am I seeking to make the department better by bring to their attention a potential issue I had with an officer, be it a minor law infraction (such as failure to use a turn signal) or a lack of proper training (such as an officer being un aware of a new law, or change in the law) or am I merely calling to make trouble for the officer because they dared to write out a ticket for my own unlawful actions?""
It upsets me when I see an officer speed without immediate reason (it is often difficult if not impossible to tell when an officer is speeding and when they are in pursuit of a suspect and do not wish to announce their presence).  Moreso when I see an officer litter, fail to signal or yield right of way, or park illegally to carry out a private transaction with a company.  These are all minor infractions of the law many commit on a daily basis, officer of the law or not.  However, should we be ticketed for this infraction, we honor our punishment, pay the fine, etc.  There is no easy system for officers in this matter.  So rare is the instance where one officer will ticket another it can be said to be impossible bu it is not.  The possibilty exits, however teh issuing officer will become ostracized and viewed as a traitor to the family.  It takes a seriously heinous crime that threatens the credability of the force to even hear about an officer being reprimanded.  This threshold of action is damaging to the image of any police department, since all minor infractions become ignored while major ones are quickly swept out of the public eye.  This does little to endear the officers to the hearts of those already within the negative re-enforcement situation, that is, the people being ticketed ona  regular basis.  We tend to see the police and seeing themselves as ""above the law"", our perception is flawed, I will admit, but it persists nonetheless and should be addressed because it is a system which breeds abuse and corruption.

This is all for now as the train of thought has been derailed utterly."

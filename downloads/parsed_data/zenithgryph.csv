08) Any Tattoos and/or Piercings? Explain where.  None.

11) What is your favorite sport?  Does car racing count? (NOT NASCAR!)
12) Do you have a Pessimistic or Optimistic attitude?  Kinda both.

22) What color eyes do you have?  green
23) Ever been arrested?  nope

32) In one word, how would you describe yourself?  Crazy.
33) Do you believe/appreciate romance?  I probably wouldn't be in a serious relationship if I didn't....
34) Favourite and least favourite food?  I have too many favorites and least is lima beans.
35) Do you believe in God?  I'm firmly agnostic.

Black and any other dark colors are the HARDEST.

So when I'm outside waxing my car, don't make a remark about how hard it must be to keep white clean.  I'll just correct your false assumption.

There, you've been informed."

October 2002

Dr. Laura Schlessinger is a radio personality who dispenses advice to people who call in to her radio show. Recently, she said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22 and cannot be condoned under any circumstance. The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a east coast resident, which was posted on the Internet. It's funny, as well as informative:

Dear Dr. Laura:

Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific laws and how to follow them:

When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?

I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?

I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15:19- 24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.

Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?

I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?

A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?

Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?

Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?

I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?

My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)

I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.

Your devoted fan,
Jim"

"event","Finals are coming!  Finals are coming!  I have three finals that I'm pretty sure of.  Two of which are this week (stress much? NEVER!).  It's kinda weird that the semester is almost over.  School becomes such a part of my life, my routine, that to think that it might be over for another semester, it throws off my whole balance to life and makes me a little anxious.  I don't like to think I can't adapt (I think quite the opposite, actually), it's just perhaps I'm just reluctant to do so.  I like my routine.  I like my life and to see something that's such a large staple of it change makes my head a little nervous.  

Summer is coming, though!  Warm weather, bright skies and spending time in the sun!  This time, my summer won't be taken up by a 50+ hour work-week, either.  I have two classes I hope to take, so only 6 credits.  A class in Revolution taught by my favorite teacher before he goes on sabbatical... and probably one on Microeconomics -- assuming SOM accepts me.  My GPA for the moment is a tad bit low, not low enough for SOM to deny me, but it still makes me mildly nervous.  Worse comes to worse, I'll make it into CASL, boost my GPA some and apply again.  I don't think it'll be necessary since the required is 2.5 (?) and I  have a 2.70.  It'll rise!!! TRUST ME! IT WILL RISE!!!

So far, so anxiety or ""Uh oh, WTF did I do?"" moments in changing my major to PS/Finance.  I like Poli Sci, so I'm really happy.  Besides, it'd be way cool to work for the government (NOT the political side, the policy side, mind you).  Finance is gonna take a little effort to get through, but will be better when I'm taking the classes for my concentration.  But thinking of a great melding of a PS degree and a Finance degree gets my mind in places like the Federal Reserve, SEC and other organizations that make my mind ""SQUEE!!!!"" with delight.

Michael takes his classes for an EMT soon.  I'm so anxious for him.  I know he'll do well (I WILL MAKE HIM!), it's just the first step on the path that he wants to be in.  I feel nervous and excited for him.  Things will be tight, but we'll get through together and I want to see the accomplishment when he's done and passes wonderfully, when he gets a job as an EMT... when he moves on to be a paramedic.  I'll be right there and even just thinking about that far away day fills me with a bit of joy and pride for him -- even though the day isn't here yet.  Just the knowledge that it will be one day is enough to make me really happy.  He'll do awesome.  And I'll be behind him the entire way.

Oh, and Saturday was our two-month anniversary thingie-ma-bober.  We didn't do much, but I'm so pleased.  Two months with an amazing guy!  I don't regret a single day and even during a few disagreements and hurt feelings, I still love every moment I have with him.  Every time I see him I smile and every time he touches me I feel utterly content.  

Although, at the moment, my head is being a pain in the ass... Ugh."

"event","I love Toyota's opinion at the end.  Fuck GM.  It's just a stupid internet poll, but it's really fucking sad that GM feels the need to do something (borderline) dishonest just to save a little face to some random anonymous net-surfer who typically doesn't put any face on internet polls.  

<i>By Keith Naughton
Newsweek

Updated: 10:38 a.m. PT March 10, 2007

March 10, 2007 - GM may have to hand over its crown to Toyota this year, but it's determined to beat its Japanese rival in at least one race: the Newsweek.com's readers poll. In an online survey accompanying a story I wrote with Allan Sloan about why Toyota is overtaking GM as the world's largest automaker, Newsweek.com asked readers this week which company they thought made a better car. On Monday, Toyota was several laps ahead of GM, by an 80-20 margin. But by Friday, GM was leading by an 83-17 margin, as the total respondents had mushroomed to 80,000 from 14,000.

Turns out GM was orchestrating a get-out-the-vote campaign that would make Karl Rove proud--something that became clear to me when a GM employee called me on Thursday, frustrated that our software wouldn't let him vote twice. (You can't). It seems that on Thursday morning, GM PR official Katie McBride had sent an e-mail blast to the company's worldwide workforce of 318,000 and 7,000 dealers, asking them to vote for GM in our poll--a highly unscientific survey, like all internet polls that invite audience participation. ""It's time to stand up and tell the world we're proud of who we are, what we build and how important we are to the U.S. economy,"" she wrote, including a link to our website.

If GM is embarrassed to have been caught ballot-stuffing, the company isn't showing it. When I called Katie McBride Friday afternoon to ask about her e-mail (which I learned of from a reader's comment), she readily admitted she'd written it. She told me she'd received ""six or seven"" e-mails from co-workers around the world who were trying to generate votes for GM on the story. ""It was going on out there virally so extensively that we thought we should make people aware of it,"" she explained. ""People could vote however they choose to vote. There was no intention of doing anything underhanded.""

GM's top PR man makes no apologies, either. ""I don't see anything dishonest about it,"" said Steve Harris, GM VP of Global Communications, who directed McBride to send the e-mail. ""Did it skew your survey? Very possibly. But I don't see that as a problem."" When I gave Harris the latest results showing GM with a lengthening lead, he was ecstatic. ""I think that's great,"" he said with a laugh.


Did GM do anything unethical? After all, internet polls are driven by reader passions, and are more a form of web entertainment than meaningful measures of public opinion. ""No, I don't even find it distasteful,"" says Poynter Institute journalism ethics instructor Kelly McBride (no relation to Katie McBride). ""It sounds like good old-fashioned politics. And it shows that GM has a lot more loyal employees, or maybe desperate employees, than we may have thought.""

Toyota found the whole thing amusing. ""If GM feels they need to do this, then let them rock and roll,"" says Irving Miller, Toyota U.S. VP of PR. ""But if I were a general consumer and saw that lopsded number (in GM's favor), I'd say, 'this is crazy,' and not put any credibility into it."" The bottom line, though, is that Toyota's U.S. sales are up 10.9 percent this year, while GM's are off 6.4 percent. That's one vote GM is finding difficult to reverse.</i>"

Every little noise people make is inching my aggro meter up a notch with each second they're there making noise.  People talking on their cell phones make the aggro meter jump a few notches instead of just one.

This week has been a week of laziness and procrastination.  I have a 4 page paper due tomorrow... haven't started it.  I'll have to get on that today, seriously.  I'm just really wanting a break.  I can work like a mad-man for only so long before I start to JUST NOT CARE.  And, I'm reaching that point, I think.  Tomorrow is, at least a day off.  Going to relax at home, finish my paper (at least in the comfort of my own home!) and do a whole lot of nothing else. Saturday is the world series (GO TIGERS!) and Sunday and Monday are extra bonus days... Yeah, 4 day weekends and I'm STILL in need of a break?!  People in 9-5, 40 hr work week jobs are laughing at me.  Hey, buddy, you try working for no pay on shit you don't want to work on, that you probably suck at doing and have noclue about how you're doing in them.  Just... fuck off or something.  This is MY sob story, goddamnit. :P

Yeah, that's the other thing... At OCC, there was an easy way for me to judge how I was doing in my classes.  There was either the school work that was graded and returned, or there are the tests or the progress is put up on a website for you to take note of whenever you wanted.  There are sorta the same things here, but this place is so new, the pressure to do well so much stronger and the work load so much larger and different that even when I get back papers, assignments and exams with A's and other good grades, I'm still plagued by uncertainty.  It sucks.  SUCKS I TELL YOU!

I think... on Saturday... I'm going to Dave's house, gonna watch the World Series and get totally plowed.  I need a little release like that.  It's not that I use alcohol as an escape or get-away.  It's not necessary, but the little stresses and worries are omnipresent, even when I'm enjoying my weekend.  Get buzzed or way fucked up and all those things get drowned and lost in the buzz and blur of the alcohol.  It's nice, just for a while, to not have that small-but-constant pressure.  Of course, if you're bad at it, you get the hangover at the end, but you begin to learn where your limit is. ;)

Anyhow, I'll wrap this up... homework calls.  One stupid discussion question to do, begin the 4 page paper (at least make an outline) and get some math homework done?  I doubt I'll get to the last one.

<lj-cut text=""Nerdy, geeky, fandom thoughts here""> 

I'm also thinking of writing a story.  I don't mean to work on anything to the extent of NaNoWriMo, but something just as a little release.  Writing all this stuff for school gets my juices going, and I start to begin to realize that not only is writing (ok, TYPING) fun, but I think I'm pretty damn good at it.  Of course, I've got way too much stuff to do to work on it more than an hour here or there, but I think it would be a lot of fun.  I'm putting around the idea of a WoW-themed short story.  It's just a nice medium that I already know the story to, and so do a lot of other people... so it's easy to work with.  Probably incorporate a few guildie's chars in there to have a little fun and make them try to figure out who I'm talking about.  Eh, just a fun little side-project.  Gotta have that release.  I just need to get a good idea.  I want something short, but nothing too short as to just be a page or two.  I want this to be a real short story... meaning 8 pages or more.  Which means, of course, that I have to find an idea that is not only simple enough to be condensed like that, but also long enough to be easily stretched out without being too tedious.  Since the main char would probably be my hunter, I was toying with the idea of using the epic bow quest.  Thinking upon that, I still think it's probably a good idea, I just need to sit down and do a little outline to get it all fleshed out.  Of course, the quest is meant to be solo, so I'm going to have to take some creative liberties with it to make it more story-worthy and more able to incorporate extra characters.

K, I'm off to get some work done, and all this typing and coffee has made my hands to jittery to type non-stop like this (typing out class questions has pauses -- thinking time ;) )

"event","I always used to assume maybe I had a small case of being arrogant.  I always thought that everyone else in the general populace of the world was pretty stupid.  


I was right.


How do I know the general populace of the world is as dumb as shit?  Because they cannot read or understand traffic signs.  

Really.

I can vaguely understand why people don't obey the ""No Turn on Red"" signs; they're just really impatient and turn anyhow.  Or maybe they're completely unobservant and didn't notice.  To the latter, I have to wonder why they drive at all.  ""No! I didn't notice the guy right in front of me was stopping!""

I can sorta understand why ""Yield"" signs become stop signs; people are completely and utterly paranoid that all other traffic is making a lethal bee-line for their vehicle and intend to make themselves a modern sort of kamikaze.

And I guess I can even stretch my mind enough to fathom why people would so blatantly run stop signs on very busy roads; they're impatient, assume you're gonna stop and, hey, even if you don't they'll just sue the fuck out of you anyhow.  Emotional trauma, didn't you know?  They're scarred for life.

But what I cannot, under any stretch of my imagination, begin to fathom why people disobey signs like ""DO NOT ENTER"" and ""ONE WAY"".  Really, the signs aren't there as helpful ""guidelines.""  It's not a sort of ""Hey, we'd prefer it if you don't come in, but if you do that's ok too.""  It's a ""OMFG YOU'RE SO DED IF YOU COME IN HERE!""  Yes, D-E-D.  You're too dead to have a use for the A.  Signs like the ""Do Not Enter"" sign and the ""One Way"" only signs are like huge neon lights in blood red.  Traffic comes from these places which are adorned by the signs.  Often.  Going down those avenues will probably result in an accident, a death or a very PO'ed fellow driver blearing his horn and screaming at your idiocy.  Of course, the offending driver usually just screams back at how he had every right, etc, etc.  Really.  

This is how I can tell most of the people in the rest of this country is stupid, dumb, completely ego-tisical or at least have a major case of ADD.  READ people, READ AND HEED."

Thankfully, both PoliSci and Math had a test yesterday, so no new content or homework to worry about.  Today, my focus can be on COMP270 and that book....except, shit, there's my online class too.  Bah.  

COMP270 is easy.  Have to find a job ad, create a resume for it and a cover letter.  I had my resume all set up and newly polished from the co-op office and because of the job fair that was last week.  So, just went on Monster, printed out an ad for a job I might be able to score (if it wasn't in Delaware, lol), slap my resume on it and just write up a quick cover letter.  Easy.  

Will read more of that book next shift since it'll be in the Sun/Unix lab and, despite my computer science major, I'm still a bit clueless on how to deal with that OS.

"event","From <lj user=""zoethe"">, <lj user=""theferrett""> 's wife.

My entry yesterday elicited an unexpected reaction from some people. To summarize, it came down to, ""you shouldn't treat the ability to cope as superior to the inability to cope.""

Except, it is.

I realize that a statement this blunt is probably going to make people angry, and it may cost me a chunk of my audience. But I'm going to say it anyway: the world doesn't care about your problems, and if you let them rule you, it will punish you for them.

You're not supposed to say things like this. Everyone is supposed to be able to feel good about themselves and never be judged for their disabilities.

That is a big lie that the world tells you to make itself feel better about the reality: it judges. This isn't about me judging anyone. Some of the people I have referred to as my heroes are people whom circumstance has rendered unable to cope with the world in the way the world would prefer. But they will tell you that they have to overcompensate for their disabilities, and that there are times when they can't, and the world does punish them for it. It's not vicious or intentional, this punishment. It's just a grinding fact of life:

The less you are able to cope, the more the world will leave you behind.

I know this, because I've had it happen to me. When I went to college, I did not cope particularly well. Oh, I graduated with a B+ average, but I did it on the strength of my innate writing abilities and good memory. I wasted a lot of time, got a basically worthless degree, and skated. I had no career goals and no future plans, and it showed. Even though I felt like I was doing my best, coping to the best of my abilities, I did nothing to excel or stand out. Grad school was even worse. After developing my program, I never went back to my advisor. I took classes and floundered around and pretty much wasted two years. I would go out of my way to avoid the building housing my advisor's office, telling myself that tomorrow I really would call him, really would get myself on track - but right now I just couldn't cope. Ergo, I have no master's degree despite two years of courses. The world does not look upon this fact and say, wow, she had a rough childhood and she really felt like she was trying her best; we should give her the job anyway just because she tried. Nope, the world says, Master's Degree required, so why are you even applying, you loser?

Even now in law school, there are times when I get overwhelmed. Last spring I handed in a paper on which I knew I could have done better, but I did all that I was physically and emotionally capable of doing. I simply could not put one more scrap of myself into it. The fact that I was going through Kristi's surgery, a lot of other turmoil, and carrying three other very difficult classes had no impact on my grade. My effort was an ""A"" effort on the sliding scale of how much I could manage, but the grade on my report card was a ""B"".

The job world is the same. Certainly everyone has understandable life crises - death of a parent, illness, accident - and your fellow employees will rally 'round for that. But if your crises are weekly - fights with your significant other, disputes with your children/parents/landlord/neighbor, your own inner turmoil - and those crises reverberate in the quality of your work product, people are going to get sick of you pretty damned quickly. They smile at you through clenched teeth and say, ""No, it's okay, I understand."" But what they are thinking is, ""what the hell is wrong with you?""

Because every time you fail to cope, someone else has to cope in your place.

Coping in your place is stressful because they already have their own issues, so yours are an unanticipated burden for which they have not scheduled. If it's happening more than once or twice a year, your most sincere apologies begin sounding hollow to the person who works through lunch to cover your ass.

You can accuse me of being unfeeling or uncaring, you can shut out my words as cruel, Randian, or heartless. You can rail against the unfairness of it all. But the world will inexorably grind on, and it will grind you. And it doesn't care how unfair that is."

At least once a day, I'm struck with awe at the intelligence of the men who founded our country. I'm a pretty smart guy - and yet when I think about the approach they took when they founded America, I realize I'm not that bright at all.

Part of my admiration stems from their commitment to democracy and the rule of the people - at least as they defined people. It's a pretty well-known fact that if he'd wanted to, George Washington was so popular that he probably could have installed himself as ruler-for-life, thus effectively ending the idea of democracy before it began. In fact, in 1776 during the worst part of the war, Congress gave Washington absolute power for six months, basically giving him full reign to be a dictator. But here's what he said:

""Instead of thinking myself freed of all civil obligations by this mark of their confidence, I shall constantly bear in mind that as the sword was the last resort for the preservation of liberties, so it might be the first to be laid aside when those liberties are firmly established.""

You have to like a man who thinks like that when absolute power is handed to him.

But the most amazing thing the Founding Fathers did was that they stared reality right in the eye and bowed to it.

You see, a lot of people don't care about results. They're determined that everyone should be moral and upright, and are continually furious that people aren't acting out of sheer benevolence. Their end goal is not to stop harmful actions of the amoral, but is instead to instill morality into everyone who does not believe as they do.

The problem, of course, is that morality is a strange and wondrous beast; either you have it, and feel good when you take a certain action, or you don't. I mean, we've all had that weirdo conversation with the religious fanatic:

""If you give up having sex and devote your life to Zoroaster, your life will improve!"" they cry.

""Why?""

""You'll be clean! You'll feel like a new person!""

""But I feel fine right now,"" you say, confused that someone would think that sex is wrong. ""I don't feel bad when I have sex, and giving it up would only mean that I'm preventing myself from doing something I enjoy for no gain whatsoever.""

""You sinner!"" they cry. ""How can you not know that sex is bad?""

And that is ultimately the flaw with moral arguments; they rely on the other person having a conscience. If you're the sort of scumbag who mugs people in alleyways, obviously you don't feel too guilty about it - otherwise you wouldn't be doing it. To a mugger, saying ""You should do that because it's moral"" pretty much reads as ""You should give it up for a feeling of happiness that will never arrive.""

It's hard to instill that sort of emotion into a fully-grown man.

Thus, there is a need for disincentives to convince the non-moral. You may not be inclined to stop rolling drunks out of the goodness of your heart, but if you know that a cop will throw your ass in jail if he catches you, that might stop you. You might not stop riffling through someone's valuables because other people tell you it's wrong, but you probably won't spend an hour trying to crack a lock on a safe. You might not have a problem with farting loudly in public, but you'll get the hint when you stop getting invited to parties.

For moral people, there's moral arguments. For everyone else, there's punishments and disincentives.

But to the folks who are determined to make everyone moral, the ""lock your doors to prevent robbers"" theory actually conflicts with their goals. After all, when the fear of a prison sentence is all that stops a guy from embezzling money from grandmothers, he's not moral. Remember, the end goal is to get people to do it out of the goodness of their hearts, not to prevent the actual crime. And should the crime occur, the question is never ""What, if anything, could the victim have done to prevent this?"" - since, as someone who was moral, the victim never has any choice or responsibility in what was done to them - but rather, ""Who should be blamed?""

In other words, to the moral it's more important to assign blame than to stop the harmful action. The debate never centers around, ""But what would have prevented the victim from being harmed?"" - instead, it's ""How can you say that my friend, who got drunk and fell asleep in an alleyway in the worst part of town, is to be blamed for the assholes who stole her purse?""

Should you suggest ways for the victim to make his or her life safer, suddenly you're excusing the behavior of the animals who do these shitty things, even if you're trying to figure out the most efficient way to stop these shitty things from taking place. They'd rather spend their time shouting about how people should act, rather than actually stopping the people responsible.

There's a surprising number of people like that out there.

And yet the amazing thing about the Founding Fathers is that they didn't give a rat's ass about morality when they designed our government. They didn't want to know how humans should behave; instead, when they designed the government for this country, they asked, ""How do people actually behave?""

They looked at the idea of just having people just vote on everything, and said, ""You know, people are fuckin' stupid. If we let them vote on every issue, they'll never vote for anything that involves sacrifice. Nobody ever wants more taxes, or to start a war even when it's totally necessary. Crap, if the country had voted on this war, we would have given it up in 1776 just before Washington crossed the Delaware.""

""Okay, so we need a guy who can make unpopular decisions once in awhile. What about a President?""

""Hell, they'd elect anyone who had a nice smile and had won a war. We should give the President power, but if we let him be the only power then he's gonna take over the country in no time flat.""

""Well, what about a Parliament to counterbalance him?""

""The problem with it is that no matter how we divvy it up, people are gonna get their panties in a wad. Go by population, and New York starts voting in the everything they want. Go by a simple state count, and then everyone else starts boning New York. And if the people don't feel represented, we'll see riots in a decade.""

""How about both, then?""

""Good. Let's have one part with rapid turnover to get the quickest laws into place, and another part with a slower, more deliberative body that can be shielded from the whim of the crazes that pass every two years. If they have to, they can get rid of the President, but a ludicrous amount of people would have to agree on it.""

""Hang on, though; like you said, people are pretty dumb. The majority is a tyranny, and they'd start pushing everyone else around the second they gained power. Freedom is about having people you don't like talking shit about you, and God forbid Congress and the President line up to vote free speech right out of existence.""

""Or crap, once people get into power they start extending that power. We've got nothing to stop folks from extending Congressional terms to twenty years apiece. How can we stop that?""

""Um... we'd need a politically-isolated judge - someone who can't be bribed, or threatened with the sack - to have the biggest power. We can't give him the power to make new laws, or he'd be a tyrant, but he sure as shit could block the dumb-ass laws and Constitutional bastardization that people come up with.""

""So he'd be the guardian of the Constitution?""

""Yeah. I like that. But shoot, that means that we'd be giving one guy total power for life.""

""What about a panel of judges, then?""

""All right; a group of people, spread out over various Presidential terms, who can get elected only by, um, passing Congress and the Presidential seal of approval. It's not the greatest solution - they'll still be ludicrously powerful - but it'll have to do.""

""Excellent. So what we've done here is to create a situation of political landlock, with the individual states (as represented by Congress) lining up against the President. The only way they can get anything done is if enough people agree on it from all over the damn country, both from the quickie-elect Housers and the long-term Senators.... and if the country agrees on some dumb-ass law that throws away everything we worked for, the Supreme Court will vote that shit down.""

""Good work. Let's go home and have our slaves cook us a meal.""

The amazing thing is that the system was designed to correct humanity's faults. The Founding Fathers assumed that our country would contain mad, power-hungry bastards who could gather immense masses of idiots to sweep them into power, and they created a system that would blunt that power.

That's such a baldly functional piece of design that we should all bow down in awe.

They didn't put their hands on their hips and shout, ""By putting up safeguards to prevent the President's power, you're sympathizing with the amoral! People shouldn't elect bad Presidents, and if they do it's not the honest voter's fault!""

They looked at people and said, ""There sure are a lot of bastards out there. What can we do to stop them?"" And God bless them for that.

Oh, the Founding Fathers weren't perfect; as mentioned, they owned slaves and were all men who didn't think overmuch of women voting. (But at the same time, it would have been really easy to change the Declaration of Independence to say, ""All white free men are born equal,"" or even just sort of quietly remove that clause to avoid angering the South.) They didn't anticipate gerrymandering. They didn't foresee how powerful the media would become. And they certainly didn't see how the winner-take-all mentality of Congress would polarize the electorate and actually reduce people's choices...

...but cut 'em a break. It was the first democracy in ages, and when the Greeks did it they voted on everything. Their design was light-years ahead of its time, and it's stood the test of time to this day through a Civil War and hotly-debated Presidential elections. If the people really care about something, the people can stop it. (The sad thing is how little the people care about things, but that's an issue for another day.)

In the end, the Founding Fathers asked one simple question: How can we build a country that will stand up against the bastards who will inevitably want to plunder it? And that planning has served us well.

Take a bow, guys. You've earned it."

"event","Dave and I were nerds and saw Star Wars yesterday at a 12:20a.  We were first in line and got good seats right in the center.  

He had been reading reviews of the movie all day from the people who thought it sucked to those who thought it was ""TEH_BESTEST EVAR!!!1!""

In my opinion?  It's damn good, but it does have it's low points.  Some of the acting and dialogue is a little wooden and forced.  The begining is too slapstick, almost like SpaceBalls.  Dave made a comment that Lucas had to have some humor in there -- the rest of the movie is so dark.

Indeed, it is.  It is a very very dark movie.  There are no high points.  It's almost disturbing.  We left in a state of awe (and exhaustion -- we didn't get home till 3:30a).  The movie is mindblowing, but it doesn't seem right to call the movie ""good"" because it was so dark.  Nothing ""good"" happened.  Anakin falls to the Dark Side, a buncha Jedis die and other bad stuff.  There's nothing ""good"" there, but it's not a ""bad"" movie.  It's definitely one of the better ones, regardless of the patchy acting in some places and the beginning being so... off-key.  

I have one gripe, in that Padme' is shown as being about 6 mo or 7mo pregnant -- there is NO way she's delivering babies at that stage (or, at least babies that aren't premature).

Overall: astounding.  4.5 stars out of 5

I'll keep this a little short, since it's so easy to delve into spoiler material.  The movie is definitely worth a see.  Don't expect a happy ending, don't expect feel-good material.  The movie is very dark and almost upsetting.  And please, don't bring your children -- it is rated PG-13 instead of PG for a reason (namely the former sentence)."

Possibly because I'm dreadfully tired?  I attempted staying up, waiting for Dave to come home from his presentation.  He got home at 3a, I was out by 2a.  Oh well.

Maybe I'll have more energy after some food.  Just not sure if I want to eat now or not.

"event","I pampered my car today.

It really needed some time with me.  It had been months without a good wash or wax.  So, today, I washed it, hand-waxed it, cleaned every bit of the wheels, cleaned the windows, applied Rain-Ex to the windshield and touched-up any little dings in the paint.

Ah... it's so nice to have some time to bond with your car.  

My baby. <3 <3

It's really shiney now.  Yey, shiney.  

I'd provide pictures, but I haven't any for now.  

....

I'm tired.

Dave is obsessing over Star Wars: Episode 3's release next week.  He watches the trailer every day without fail.  <3 my nerd. XD

Dan went AWOL. :/

And my mom hasn't returned her phone calls??? So much for wishing her a happy Mother's Day. At least she isn't anal about it like some OTHER people's parents. *rolls eyes*  I love my family's lack of cohesion sometimes! :P

My car is shiney.  Car-bonding time is love.  Alan Rickman would be jealous... if he only knew!"

Since yesterday, for some odd reason, I can't access Google.  No Gmail, no Google.  The connection times out.  AIM won't let me sign onto it either.  Dave cannot access Google, too.  So I'm thinking something's up with maybe Comcast's networking stuff?  Since I KNOW Google wouldn't be down for two days.

Any ideas?  It's kinda frustrating not being able to check e-mail (regardless of the fact I hardly get any).

Also, since I can't log onto AIM to ask you, are you up for Red Robin tomorrow?  (If you get this by tomorrow... X.x)"

Seriously.

If you were a female, and you heard his voice, you'd SO understand.  I think I could orgasm on his voice alone (although he ain't half bad on the eyes, either).

"event","Well, kinda over.  I have one more final to take -- my JSP final.  I have about 45min until I have to drag my butt over there to take it, but I really don't want to.  My mind is already checked out of the school mindset for about a week or so.  I think I desperately need a break from classes, but I need 6 credits this summer to work at the lab, so I don't get a break, I get a reduced workload.  Hopefully that will be enough to get my mind into any kind of motivation.

Motivation, exactly what I'm lacking right now.  I have a lack of motivation to do anything, be it class, cleaning or even WOW.  Yes, you heard right, I'm lacking motivation to play WOW.  Amazing, isn't it?  Mind you anti-WOW people that I'm in no way taking a hiatus, maybe just reduced playing time?  OR more like I'm just refraining from playing my main religiously -- regardless of the fact I'm 4 levels from 60.  

I have no desire to take my JSP final.  I will, of course, I just don't want to in an extreme way.  I'm so apathetic to any type of class right now, I don't care what my grades are.  I don't care what my GPA does (oh, the H0RR0Rz!), either.  I just want some time off.  I want to lay in bed and not be called a lazy slacker, I want to sleep, regardless of whether or not a GORGEOUS day is occuring outside.  I just want some time off, my mind is slipping into a deep apathetic state in which the only thing I really enjoy is time with Dave and friends (although the latter is rare).

I now have 26 minutes until my JSP final.  I guess I'll go try to study and get this over with.  Wish me some luck -- I'll need it."

The college had a fire alarm last night and interrupted my JSP class -- normally I wouldn't mind, but he was in the midst of giving out extra credit -- which I desperately need.  I still snagged 5 pts before the alarm interrupted it all.

B- on the Accounting test... -.-  a low for me.  I dislike journal entries.  For some reason it MATTERS what gets written down first!  Ah well, still confident I'll get an A on that class.  

I should be studying for POL2610, but, really... I don't want to, regardless of the fact there's a quiz today.  I've aced everything in that class -- I guess one so-so quiz won't fuck up the perfect grade too much there. XD

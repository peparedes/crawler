"event","jenny and me went and sat at this pool till this kid barfed but i wanted to go anyway because im not so good at just sitting around usually and im super bored. i wanna go do something but i think im totally bugging the hell out of kyle and bill and aaron and dave by now because i show up there all the time and im like, ""hey wanna get high"" and im sure they dont mind the getting high thing but i talk and im annoying i just dont know exactly when i get TOO annoying. i do at work because jennifers eyes sorta start to roll back in her head and you get tell shes beginning to contemplate how much trouble she'd really get into if she just offed me right there in the middle of dearborn music and dropped me in the la shish dumpster, how long it would take for someone to find me, but thats still a whole other thing. 

i wanna find my guess who cd and just drive as far as i can. go down to ohio and be like, ""WHAT UP BILL DO YOU LIKE MY PEDICURE? NO? YEAH I KNOW THAT DAMN CHINK FUCKED IT UP I THOUGHT SO TOO. AND I DRAGGED MY TOES ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF A POOL."" 

it really fucks me up when bill comes home. because its like, while he's here i have such a good time even though usually it gets fucked up and we dont get to chill as long as we'd like and everything like that, but once it gets back into this swing of things where i hardly ever get to talk to him its just bull. i know im just a crazy fart and all but it sure made me feel better talking to him more often. even when he was at school i got to talk to him online a whole lot more. but he might be here in the fall, so thats cool.

in further news when i grow up now im gonna be an archaeologist and dig up dinosaur bones and make inca displays and be cool shit its gonna be great. this time if i change my mind i hope i either do it before i go to a university, or after im done with school so i can use my dug up dinosaur money to do something else, because that massage stuff was crap and a half. BUT IF ANYONE WANTS TO BUY A MASSAGE TABLE AND CHAIR THAT WAS HARDLY USED, ITS ALL YOU. ILL EVEN THROW IN SOME FREE MYSTERY PRIZES JUST FOR FUN. plus real photos of the loch ness monster and ufos.

my moms gonna be home soon, i gotta find something to do.

so i feel real bad about leaving work early all the time. i mean i didnt yesterday, and it was cool, but today i did and i think i did 2 times last week. i shouldnt do that, so that i can keep my job. 

my mom was talking to me about something and she got proud of me and was all happy and excited because i did some crap and i kept giggling and my mom said my breath smelt like smoke and commented what kind in a happy fashion possibly just joking like, haha she was smoking cigarettes but i will suggest pot, but i dont really know. so my dad pops in and goes, ""did you smoke a joint?"" and i was simply all, yeah, and continued talking to my mom and i dont know if she caught it or not because niether of them seemed to really care. my dad sighed a little i think, but other then that there was no uproar of dissapointment. so i thought it was fun to sit there stoned and have them know and be retarded and have an excuse to be. 

it sorta happens often - being stoned around them and being retarded - because im stoned and dont care, but this time it was extra special. 

work sorta sucks. it doesnt and its cool but im on to the medium level of the fill-in crossword puzzles and i just cant handle it."

i went and saw harry potter on friday. i like the book better but i cant deny how glorious the movie was in its own rite.

i quit massage school like, last week because i totally dont like touching people and i dont have the attention span to stand there for an hour or two touching someone. so im gonna take 2 more classes at occ in the second half of the summer and in the fall i guess im gonna have to pick up a 12 credit schedule so that i can stay on my dads insurance because i want my meds back.

i need to pick up a pack of cigarettes before tomorrow.
i need to go get a joint somewhere and smoke that before the hours up because it seems like right now, i could totally smoke a joint, pass out, and be happy as pie. AS PIE.

i have to get up tomorrow morning for work from 9-3. then i have to run and go home and get all my shit and then run and pick up my mom then run to school. i hope i finished all the shit i needed to do for that class because i know im not gonna go check and i know i did at least more then half of it so its gonna be cool either way."

"event","so i went out and took kim to go see shrek 2 and jimmy came along and i guess my aunt was going to alans for the night so jim was supposed to be in as soon as i left to come home because i couldnt stay over because i have work tomorrow morning and an hour and a half before i leave jimmys decided hes going to a movie. then he decides he isnt going to a movie until 8:30 and im leaving at 8 so no matter what kims gonna be home by herself late at night where storms are a possibility. and he isnt coming home until 12:30 or about. so my 14 year old cousin is in a house all alone because she's tired of getting pushed off on grandma where so has to sleep in her attic where its spooky as fuck, if she does get the chance to stay at home shes being watched by her older brother who if he doesn't leave for the night until 12 or 12:30 which most 18 year olds would do on a friday and saturday night sits around with her in an empty house. i only get the chance to go out there once in awhile, i havent been out there for an entire night for 2 weeks. i mean i understand my aunt finally has something going on that makes her happy and she really should think of herself for awhile because it doesnt seem like many people are thinking of her in the way that she wants maybe if that makes sense but i really wish that kim could have more of her attention. she wants her home on weekends, and i know things cant seem to go both ways so everyones happy because one someone wants one thing and the other someone wants another thing but i think it all sucks and it sure is a sad situation.

i called kim like, 5 times throughout the night just to see what she was doing. im totally annoyed the fuck out of her im pretty sure."

"event","so my dads cleaning out the garage and some guy just rides up on his bike like, ""OO, GARAAAAAAAGE SALE"" so now we've got a garage sale going on. all we have to sell is a bunch of ass garbage and one of those big rolling coke coolers that are in like, party stores. and it doesnt roll right because i launched myself across the garage in it acouple summers ago and fucked something up. 

my moms getting home at like, 2 and im gonna take the new car to my aunts and take my cousin to a movie. i missed berkley days last weekend and felt bad, then i missed going out there last night because everything was like, flooded from hurricane canton yesterday afternoon. 

my mom gave me a talk last night when i came home about how she likes the adult im becoming or something because i didnt bitch when i didnt get the car at 5 to go out with bill and because i cleaned when she told me to and because i came home when she was scared i'd get washed away by the storm last night. i know she feels a lot better about the things im doing because im not hanging out with trash anymore. which makes sense. im glad im not hanging out with trash anymore too. her allergies are real bad right now and i feel bad when i come inside from smoking and she coughs when shes all the way in the other room bad enough to yack within the 5 seconds before i get to the shower. 

i burnt my hand on the top of the oven the other day.

i took back pop bottles and got 6.90. 

i think im gonna give jayme a call later and see what she's doing tonight. bill's leaving for cincinatti in like, an hour.

and now im gonna go get ready to take off because its like, 1 somethin and i wanna take off by 2 when my mom gets home so i can get there by 2:30 and go to a movie at 3 and get out by 5 and maybe end up having dinner with my aunt and cousin and leave berkley by 5:30/6 and be home by 6:30 so i can dick around all night."

AND IT WAS THE SHIT

so i dropped the history of rock class because it was nothing i thought it would be. i mean at any other time i'd take it because it would be sorta cool, but right now im hoping for that job to come through and i just dont wanna work so hard because it seems like the english class is gonna be hard enough and all those damn muscle quizzes are coming up at the aaimt."

i went to the other school this morning and wouldnt shut up the whole time i was giving my half of the trade

then i hung out with bill and i got this worm in my sandal and i thought it was mud and so i was like, ""theres mud in my shoe"" and i squished it when i walked across this puddle because it was just mud and then it turned out to be a worm and gross, a worm

then i went to the other school

then i went over to jaymes

my dad overdrafted my accout and im pissed because GOD DAMMIT now my account is overdrafted by 20 some bucks and GOD DAMMIT so now tomorrow my mom has to write me a check and i have to go put it in my bank and GOD DAAAAAAAAAAAMMIT

"event","so last night i went to my aunts and helped kim with some project and painted a bunch of popsicle sticks and today dan came home from boot camp for his 12 hour leave or whatever it is and his heads all shaved and hes got numbers on his clothes and i cant really tell whether hes happy or not. i cant imagine he is where he's at but id like to think hes not completely destroyed about it. not that he's a real negative person or anything. i promised kim i'd go out there next weekend for berkley days or whatever it is.
bill got outta jail friday so we dinked around ann arbor.
tomorrow being mothers day and all i guess im giving massages to my mom and grandma and planting flowers and theres a family dinner and all. i got my mom a little gong for her classroom and a book she read me when i was little. 
i got new earrings and i broke one."

"event","I was walking down Grand Avenue in Swanton with Sue Nadeau, a lady I used to know in high school. Again, like in my other dreams, it seemed like was younger in this dream, perhaps 13 or so. There was snow on the ground, and we passed by a schoolbus. The bus was partially up on the sidewalk, and there were no kids in it. The bus driver was out on the sidewalk, just standing around. [After waking, I recognize him as one of the security guys up at Brigham Autoliv.] We talk to him a while, and he mentions that they make him shovel a lot of snow. I say ""But that's not the job of a bus driver!"" and he goes on to explain about how it's not like that nowadays. We wish him good luck and keep walking up Grand Avenue.

Sue and I are talking, and suddenly it's more summery weather, and there is no snow. She stops to investigate a shrub, like she's looking for something. ""Seeing if it's still there,"" she says. I say, ""Leave something there for the kiddies, eh?"" [I seemed to be referring to marijuana.] And she shrugs, not finding anything and keeps walking.

At this point, Sue is on a bike and is riding ahead of me, but I'm distracted by something wrong in my mouth. I wiggle a tooth with my tongue, and it falls out. It's a left-side bottom-front tooth, and it came out painlessly. Where it came out, the tooth bottom was flat except for a rim around the edge, and the bottom had some sort of bluish film on it. I panic, thinking how mad my dad will be, since he paid for my braces. I keep the tooth held tightly in my hand, and I turn around and start walking home, planning to turn onto Platt Street from Grand Avenue. [I was apparently heading in the direction of the Gradeschool.] My walking turns very slow, and I get very annoyed that the faster I try to walk home, the slower I seem to go.

*WAKE*

<I>NOTE: The losing of the tooth seemed to be the most real-seeming part of the dream. I could see the tooth in detail, and in the dream, I would occasionally run my tongue over where the tooth used to be, and I could feel the texture and taste that mushy-salty ""tooth root"" taste.</I>"

"event","The subject was me, but it seemed it wasn't really ""me"" as I exist in reality. It was a girl, about age 16. It's kind of sketchy, but it seemed she lived with other people, mostly female, and they had some sort of duty to do, serving dinner and cleaning house and working in the large carwash outside. Their uniform was a white shirt and black skirt, but for some reason ""I"" couldn't find a white shirt, so I had to go with a pale lilac one. Nobody seemed to care, even though I made sure to explain my situation to anyone I met.

Later, it turned into a visual more like Ultima Online, where I was watching above myself, and I was exploring the world. When I'd get near an object I could pick up, it would glow blue. When I got near an NPC, they would glow white. When I got near a door, it would glow yellow. There were blue bags and scrolls on the floor, but for some reason, I could not pick them up. This frustrated me.

The view shifted again, so I was aware of myself playing this game, and Derek was watching over my shoulder. I went to change some options in the game, with Derek telling me exactly what to do. Well, I wanted to customize it to my liking, and he didn't like that and got all upset. I could hear him go into the other room and call Brody's house, leaving a message for Brody to call back when he got up ""since it's 4am"" because Derek was so mad at me for changing the settings in this game, he wanted to go to Brody's.

"event","I can't remember a whole lot of this dream, but I'll recall what I can.

I was living in my mother's basement, and it seems like I was younger than I am now, perhaps in my teens, 16-18 maybe. The basement seems like it was much larger than mom's basement is in reality. She was letting me have a party down there, and several people were invited, including people I knew from school, and some guy named ""Tim"" who I apparently knew in the dream, but doesn't correspond to anyone I actually know in real life.

Everyone came over, and people were sitting around on couches and talking and having a good time, but someone mentioned that we were being too loud. I went upstairs and asked mom, and she said we weren't. I noticed that Riley Kempton was at the party, but staying upstairs mostly with my parents. I was glad to see him, so I sat on the couch next to him, me on an actual cushion/seat, and him sitting on the arm of the couch. I hugged him around the middle, but for some reason, promptly fell asleep because he was very comfortable. I opened one eye (in the dream) and saw that Christmas lights outside spelled out ""RILEY IS COMFORTABLE"" and I told him about it and everyone laughed.

I don't remember much else, except I think it was mentioned in a group conversation that we should all go to Costco and get food and drinks since there were so many people, and someone mentioned Greater Fox's Cunning Potions from Neverwinter Nights.

"event","welllll this whole week has been hell so you shall here me complain a tid bit, but just a little, cuz im redundant.

so it started on wed, when i got my wisdom teeth pulled, and my teeth were really really impacted and practically on the bone sooooo the cut my cheeks all the way up to the front to get to my teeth, which caused them to put stiches in them, which caused serious swelling which made it impossible for me to shut my mouth becuase the swelling went under and over my teeth so if i bit down, i bit down on swollen gums! woo hoo! ok enough of that sort of bitching, now for my shitty day

so today i woke up in serious amounts of pain but i knew i couldnt miss more school. so i compermised and decided to go in late, and in theroy this was a good idea, i would go to french and math and during advisory and 8th i would talk to my teachers and get make up work.  butttttttttt no today was may day, which means that during advisory when i was supposed to be getting work from teachers i was actually eating lunch and during math class and 8th period i was actually outside playing with little kids games such as freeze tag and tug of war.  this sounds fun right? get out of classes at the end of the day to play outside? and usally this would be, but i was in sooo much pain, and the only reason i came into school at all was to get work, but instead i was dealing with a bunch of wild 5 year olds.  so in the end, i went hoem early and spend about an hour at school all togther and druing this house i watched a movie in french class.... fuckin a i could have been in bed sleeping"

hmm but soon to be over, but then then i shall need to deal with the weekend....
butttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt! guess who called me today and made things wounderful!?!?!?!?! 

sam freaken wolf! yayyyyyyy!

out of the blue he called me just to say hello! aw i heart my 0T3'ers  you guys are the fucking best. and the fact that you can do whtaever the fuck you want infront of me/on the phone with me just help remind me how close we were last summer(sam did his buisness in el bathroom while on the phoen avec moi) some might find this weird but i found it comferting! haha ho hum

well i have to go to dance tonight which sucks maijor amounts of ass, but next week i shall not be there.  which should be for a good reason, the strokes concert which will be held in niagra falls.... oh but no jamie isnt allowed to go to her favorite bands concert well becuase shes lucky enough to get her windom teeth pulled! yesssss!(sorry about the 3rd person if that really pisses you off, i know for some of you it does so i  shall stop it)

tomorrow i have the rest of my french test, i took my speaking part on it, didnt do to shabby, i should do well on this chapter test its purdy easy so im looking foward to a easy grade! but just to make sure im should prob  go study some more 

so currently it is pouring which i am enjoying a lot, and theres lightning! yay! and thunder and lots of good times but i fear the rain will end soon which is a bummer, becuase i love nothing more but listening to the sound of a thunder storm... sigh

and tonight is the final friends but i havent really watched a lot this year becuase dance is during it, but i still am  a big friends fan so it is being taped and im very excited to see it.  and im sad becusae well its friends! 

and i could bable on about nothing for a really long time so i will stop becuase i can tell you are already geting bored with me.

love to all"

"event","well today is sunday, which means i had work...goodtimes? i think not i did finish my homework tho, and restarted and finished my favortie book(the perks of being a wall flower) reeeeeeead it!! i love that book, every time i read it i always feel differently about myself in some way.  this is very insightful of me considering its 11:20 at night and i already took my sleeping pill.  which actually might have to do with this mind set.  its strange fighting this pill, i guess you could say its like being high, but since im not really into the whole pot scene, i dont actualyl know what ebing high is like.  yup! im just that cool 8) my oh so sad attempt for sunglasses. 

well anyways last night i went to the guster concert! yay! that was amazing in itself,   but i also saw jb there! which made me sooo happy! and on a random tangent but i guess still connecting i saw linz! and the connection there is that i havent seen either in a very long time.  actually i saw linz semi recently at grahams but still it was a while ago.  but i went to get a bagle sandwhich with me madrea and padrea and wee little brotherdrea who is actually a lot taller then me now.  and guess who works there! linz! yay! lol that made me laugh and really happy all at once! the end of that story. 

 today  it rained a lot.  i love when it rains.  i honestly dont know why it puts me in a better mood then the sun does, but maybe its becasue if im depressed it just kinda lets me be.  unlike the sun, the sun comes out and its all bright and happy and if your in a bad mood that kind of light and heat dont invite you to just be ok with not being happy for that moment.  everyone needs sometime to just be there, just be depressed.  annnnnd rain is soo soothing.  we have these skylights in my house and if you sit under them its the coolest noise, the rain drops directly onto the glass.  i love that.  

i could go on about random for a very long time, but im going to stop because im just in one of those moods.  hmmm im not sure its a good mood, not a bad mood, im just there i guess. just kinda there...."

"event","well i havent updated in a while pretty much becuase nothing at all has happend.... ug boring ass life. and today is easter...but im jewish! ha! that means no chocolate bunnies or marshmallow chicks for me:( and you would think all these little jesus people would have all these high morals and be obsessed with sharing... but they are not. so no easter yummies for jamie, just matzah... good yummie in my tummy cardboard

i love jews but come on i love dark chocolate easter candy too:(

 well today i leave for toronto...wooohooo... uh no.  fucking shoot me in the face is more like it! ug picture this, are you picturing? my mom my dad and me in my condo well thats not to bad but then you add in my 13 year old little brother ok so its starting to get bad but oh wait... then timmy is comming too! yay! that means 2 13 year old lovley little children to deal with for the whole week. ho hum im done bitching i guess.  

highlights of toronto- in my condo we get cable! so even if we dont have it home we have it there ha! the logic, there is none. um what else? sometimes we go out to eat not that often becuase theres a kitchen in my place and we just go food shoping and make real dinner.. um we go shoping which is good but only when we actually buy stuff haha which isnt very often we tend to be the window shoping type...

 ug hahaha and hmm what esle is good? well nothing really becuase i will just be sitting around all day watching tv all day just like i could be doing home but oh no its better up there becuase im away from my friends...hmmm and maybe just maybe if the interenet is working i can actually stay in contact with people but sometimes the interenet likes to be a fuckerrrrrr and then i cant. lol i really need to stop bitching becuase i sound like an ungreatful brat. i love my parents and they do everything for me, and i am very greatful for what i have and for once in my life im not being sarcastic(my passover words of repentments and easter good cheer)

well lovely lovies i love you allllll and hmm well i guess when  i  get back i shall talk to you or maybe sooner if the whole lap top internet combo are being my friend.

"event","when ever i see cory i just cant go wrong.  no matter what i always end up in a good mood:) tonight he came over for passover which for him is his frist ever jewish experence! haha oh man oh man. and he got to meet some of the agostinellie's which is good, becuase now when i brag about how damn sexy he is to my cousins they know first hand how right i really am! ahahah oh dear.  anways dinner was delish! soup and turkey and mashed potatos and salad and hmm what elese? i forgot but all i know is that is was very yummie!!! then cory and i and my cuzzes went up to the loft and we watched american idol! hahha yes! 

well today during school wasnt as much as a good time.... ho hum

nothing actually happend today im thinking my highlight is my french oral part of my test i got a 19/20 and a 18/20 so im veeeery happy about that!  and during french mark and i were drawing on the white board which is something mark loves to do...lol he draws this little thing he calls mega death and i told him he needs frends so he drew mega sucks and mega jew.  well i had to embelish the mega jew, cuz well naturally i felt the need. lol he ended up looking soo cool! haha yes! curls sticking out from his keppah very jewwww.  oh and sucky newws kane told us today that we can no longer read my favorite book as our last book of the year. but now we are reading as you like it.  which i guess i wont mind im just pissed becusae the perks of being a wall flower is an increadble book and you should all read it! it is the best book i have ever read.  ug anyway fucking privite school! fuckers make us read at least one shakespear book a year.  see how much im learning there? i cant even spell his name

hahah the jrs did something that was exreemly funny tho. so in the nook they had our whole class picture(if you dont know anything about harley our whole class picture includes like 40 kids) and they did the montreal trip survivor game. hahah so they frist crossed off all the people already suspended and then i think the ones from there that will be expelled and then the ones who are still in school but will eventually not be anymoer... haha and then the other kids that have just randomly left our grade... so my graduating class is down to about 30 kids....

so there was a vistor today and it was this kid adam.  i used to go to sunday school with him b4 we ahd our bar and batmitzvahs.  he is a strange child that one... i think he used to have a hit list... how the hell is he giong to get back into harley? (i think he went there in 3rd grade i guess) oh well

oh and actually jam was pretty funny today
in class he said somehting about going anti clockwise and we were all like uh what? and he said again anti clockwise... ok jam theres no such hting and hes fighting with us about it and were like no its counterclockwise.. and he goes no way! so we ended up making him look it up in the dictionary. haha i mean come on hes an english teacher! and the fact that hes from south africa does not let him off the hook.  

so in chem today zach shumway was making up a lab and he was partners with me and hes so pompous.  i have talked to him b4 and thor was like zack you will work with jamie and he looks around the room like he has no idea who i am... uhh i go to your schoool... and if you havnet noticed...there like 150 kids in the whole upper school.... so he comes over and is like hi, im zack and i just gave him a vary sarcastic oh, really? hi, im jamie. stupid fucker i hate ass holes.


hmm i had something else to say but it is forgotten now... i guess its back to my homework which is what i really should be working on.. oh well

children keep making it happen ;)"

"event","today wasnt too eventfull, it kinda sucked actually, and someone took one of the couches from our hall way i guess as an april fools joke but it really sucked becuse it was just in the little kids french room... so that was the best prank i guess.. pretty pethetic but when my dad picked me up after school we went and got coffee that actually was a good time. mmmmm and well frankly im kinda pissed becuase i have dance tonight and a really big chem test tomorrow and i cant skip dance to study for it becuase well i always skip....ho hum i almost feel bad about it but not really. so right now i shall be studying for it becuase its harddd as a bitch.  are bitches hard? i dunno

 well anyway this sat i start my art class with sam which should def. be a great time im pretty excited because i havnt been able to take classes at all latley which is a shame becuase of our amazing new art wing, i heart the new art wing! 

haha oh there was 1 some what funny thing today tho, liz was talking about her dream last night and she was talking about how weird it was and then i relized wow, i had a really weird dream too.  which i shall tell you right now... so we are in scharas history class and bailey takes out a joint and is like hey, can i smoke? and of course dr. schara says ok becuase well.. thats what all ex. hippies would say right? and so she just starts to smoke in history when dr. dolan comes in and someone in the class says he dolan, arnt you going to stop her? and well since its dolan he of course says no! and then he trys to get in on her pot, but well bailey wouldnt share. haha i found this pretty amusing.  the end.  i hope you enjoyed it.

 oh! and then bailey later today comes up to me and is like hey jamie! i just rememberd! i had a really weird dream about you too! i guess it was from eariler on in the year but she said she was throughing a party for just harley kids and lukerr and i went up stairs and started to have sex and i guess we were really loud about it so everyone left the party and i think bailey was mad at us becuase of our loud sex going ons people left her party. haha im sorry bailey!"

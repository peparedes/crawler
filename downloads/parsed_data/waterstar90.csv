"event","I'm veg partly for health reasons and partly for ethical reasons. I used to feel a lot of pressure to go vegan--to do more for the animals, to feel morally consistent--but I don't anymore.
For me it's a matter of balance. I care about animals, I care about suffering people, I care about my friends, I care about my family, I care about my own happiness and comfort. Sometimes I choose the animals--I politely decline any meat offered to me. Sometimes I choose my friends and family--when they bring me cookies or take me out for ice cream I accept. Sometimes I choose suffering people--I donate blood to the American Red Cross, which can save peoples' lives, even though they support some animal testing.
So for me, it's not that I don't care about dairy cows or laying chickens, it's just that sometimes I decide that something else is more important to me than they are. I think veganism is great for some people, but my priorities are slightly different."

"event","I've decided to become more active in the LJ community as of TODAY. For the last few months since I've joined I've only been viewing other journals and occasionally making a comment, but, NO MORE. So heres a short intro...

My name is Jacquelyn, I'm seventeen years old and an Aquarius. I live in Southern California with my mother and sister in a tiny apartment. I've recently finished high school and I plan on attending the local junior college in the fall, then I want to transfer to UCLA and get my BA in biology. 

That's all for now."

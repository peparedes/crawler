"event","Hey.&nbsp; This is a real special thanks to everyone who showed up last night at ""How My Parents Ruined My Life 2"" at the WeHo church and to all the freakin' cool ass people who came and made awesome signs during those long days at the LA Sports Arena last week.

I'm going to go nurse my Titan-and-Wolf-inflicted battle wounds and start writing for the next ""Parents"" show on, June 10. &nbsp;

In the meantime, I highly recommend buying and reading Robin Benway's new book, ""Audrey, Wait.""&nbsp; She is the next big thing.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; www.robinbenway.com

Hugs,
Sean"

"event","Tomorrow it's all over.&nbsp; Ashley and KC are in town and tonight we hung out with Kristopher.&nbsp; it was a high school reunion in West Hollywood because I'm about to go up against the death-defying obstacle course of the summer on prime time TV.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; the whole thing is just weird.

I feel such a mixed bag of emotions.&nbsp; I'm sitting in a locker room most days lately with guys from all over the US.&nbsp; Athletes.&nbsp; Real athletes who have kids, wives, girlfriends, and whatever else that makes them all-american and straight.&nbsp; I'm nervous.&nbsp; Are they embarrassed that I'm here?&nbsp; Do they wonder what got me on this show?&nbsp; Are they afraid I'm looking at their dicks?

But they're all really nice.&nbsp; They stand up for me against those big beefy muscle gods trying to kill me.&nbsp; One even hugs me on camera.&nbsp; They give me tips on how to sumo wrestle.&nbsp; Being the gay athlete doesn't seem to matter in this locker room.&nbsp; It's nice.

Tonight KC showed me a text from the high school bully that I keep remembering when I go out to compete.&nbsp; Matt Hansen, upon hearing the news that I've been selected said, ""Is this a joke?&nbsp; Don't they want real athletes?""

Matt said what I've been thinking all along.&nbsp; I grabbed his number and took my own negative feelings out on his insensitive message when I texted him:

I'm doing this show because of the experiences I had with people like you in high school.&nbsp; It's disappointing that after all these years you didn't have something positive to say.&nbsp; I hear your wife is pregnant.&nbsp; Good luck with your baby.&nbsp; All the best.&nbsp; Sean

I'm thinking, probably over-thinking...as one of the producers said.&nbsp; I would love to win, and though I'm certainly the underdog, a win would be really nice.&nbsp; Especially now, because of Matt.

I can't let it ruin what a fun night I had tonight.&nbsp; Besides, I've already won; I got to meet the Hulkster.

My dad called to tell me he's proud of me for not giving up.&nbsp; I kind of am, too."

"event","It was a horrifying experience that I will never<i> not </i>cringe over.&nbsp; I was about 8 years old.&nbsp; I wasn't quite so fat yet. Just kind of queer and uncoordinated.&nbsp; I was doing something in P.E. class called ""Monkey Bars"" where you climb across bars, only I couldn't get across the bars.&nbsp; I wasn't strong enough.&nbsp; My classmates, including the girls, could all do it.&nbsp; And my classmates, <i>especially</i> the girls, started cheering for me to get across.&nbsp; I was so embarrassed beyond belief because I was so physically terrible at all things.&nbsp; People were being forced to cheer for me, I figured, and that literally gave me hives.<br /><br />PE class moving forward was a series of being last choice for dodgeball, which I kind of started to relish.&nbsp; I was usually 5th or 6th to last. There was a slight down syndrome girl who usually got picked after me and an overly-hairy-for-10 guy who had a twitch that was usually last because he couldn't control his farting.&nbsp; The teacher would allow the picking to be done in front of everyone, boy-girl-boy-girl...then they would get to me and someone would always say, ""You can't put two girls after each other!""&nbsp; RAW RAW...Funny, if you're an asshole.<br /><br />When I knew I wasn't an athlete I started overeating and watching wrestling.&nbsp; I wasn't good at football, so I wasn't good for anything.&nbsp; You grow up in a suburb and don't play soccer and you are invisible.&nbsp; If your parents can't brag about your baseball prowess, you spend tuesday and Thursday afternoons watching reruns of Punky Brewster.<br /><br />My mom called my 9th grade PE teacher to tell him that I was physically clumsy and that I'd never learned to throw anything, which my PE teacher announced to all of us 14 year old boys before we stretched.&nbsp; ""Go easy on Hetherington.&nbsp; He's a late bloomer.""&nbsp; I felt my pancreas, my appendix, my kidneys, and liver all trying to exit my body as fast as they could....<br /><br />then... <br /><br />Two weeks ago I was selected to compete for a slot on something so physically out of my realm, I can't believe it.&nbsp; I went to a boot camp.&nbsp; I sucked.&nbsp; I could not dive, I could not tread water.&nbsp; I could not climb a rock.&nbsp; I could barely swing sideways on rings.&nbsp; I was supposed to play fight on a platform with someone holding a padded PVC pipe.&nbsp; I fell down in 10 seconds.<br /><br />I had to climb a 15 foot tall pole and swing off of it onto another pole 15 feet away.&nbsp; it took an average of 8 seconds for the other competitors.&nbsp; It took me 10 minutes.&nbsp; Something awful happened as I stood shaking with fear above the ground.&nbsp; People started cheering me on.&nbsp; I began to sweat.&nbsp; i was 8 again.&nbsp; I wanted to die.&nbsp; i was right back there in PE.&nbsp; People being forced to cheer because I'm such a baby.<br /><br />I was sure I wouldn't be selected to move forward.&nbsp; The girls were better than me.&nbsp; I sucked hard, 21 years later.&nbsp; <br /><br />Today i went to go be fitted for a uniform to wear because, oh yeah,&nbsp; I was fucking selected to move forward.&nbsp; The excess skin from my weight loss is still there, and pushes the spandex out like crazy.&nbsp; I look like an elephant being given away for Christmas, wrapped in a tiny cellaphane balloon about to pop.&nbsp; I'm about to compete in front of a very large audience for the next 10 days and then it will be reviewed publicly this summer for the world.&nbsp; <br /><br />My biggest fear is not heights or water.&nbsp; It's gym class.&nbsp; That's why I became a personal trainer. I thought I could somehow become a weight loss superhero showing people how to be healthy without Mr. Marlette's Badminton coaching and group showering checklist.&nbsp; <br /><br />I called my mom to tell her how hard bootcamp is.&nbsp; She said, ""I don't know why you don't let me call these...what did you call them?&nbsp; Producers? Let me tell them that this is not your strong suit.&nbsp; I mean, Sean, we took you to Easter Seals to learn how to skip.""<br /><br />But I have learned how to do everything I need to learn for the experience.&nbsp; I'm not terrible.&nbsp; And the people in charge call me ""inspirational"" for my weight loss and career as a trainer.&nbsp; I'm trusting them this time and have instructed my mother she is not allowed to call ANYONE to make excuses for me.&nbsp; Nor is she allowed to remind me of how I played T-ball until I was 15.&nbsp; And I'm also instructing all of my clients that they are not allowed to use the word ""can't"" when they are in my presence.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can't...err...I won't be defeated by my fear of gym class in this case, either.&nbsp; If there's anything I've learned, it's that gym class was ALWAYS supposed to be fun, anyway.&nbsp; It's the system that made it suck. And as a trainer, and as a competitor, I have the power to change that...maybe for a nation.<br /><br />"

"event","So&nbsp;I'm finally done at CPK.&nbsp; What a difference a year makes.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don't miss it yet.&nbsp; I'm enjoying my new job of training people and writing for ""How My Parents Ruined My Life"" full time.&nbsp; I kind of feel like a doctor in a way.&nbsp; My clients range from men to women, gay and straight and all of them are trying to lose weight.&nbsp; They want help and they trust me, and I'm so glad they do.&nbsp; I'm no doctor, mostly because I care about them all and spend more than 3 minutes with them.&nbsp; I see myself then and now in each of them.&nbsp; I'm watching them jump so high and then land wondering how they did it, not really believing their bodies could move with coordination.&nbsp; It's so much fun to watch!<br /><br />Money is scary right now.&nbsp; But it's also really exciting.&nbsp; It's forcing me to be really careful.&nbsp; I feel like I'm playing that old DOS based computer game <i>Lemonade Stand </i>where you set a price, mix a recipe, and keep a budget for supplies daily to run a lemonade business in New York City. I'm doing ok with it.&nbsp; I make coffee at home now. I make lunch instead of...<br /><br />OH, yeah.&nbsp; Here's the best part.&nbsp; Since I left CPK, there's no more midday trips to the fridge to steal bacon.&nbsp; There's not a mad dash for a triple espresso.&nbsp; I'm not filled with rage over having to make dressing on the side.&nbsp; I'm regaining my sanity.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not using food to fill my heart back up when the flourescent lights and 10% tips steal it away.&nbsp; I'm not counting my hundred dollars a day while eating a full sicilian pizza add mushrooms and chicken, hoping no one is noticing how hard it is to control my overeating.<br /><br />I wish I had the discipline to just suck it up and deal.&nbsp; I was powerless over waiting tables.&nbsp; I know so many people who can work there forever and seperate it all when they go home.&nbsp; I couldn't.&nbsp; I don't want to go where my mom and dad did, hating their day job and coming home to brood about it until 10 PM when they started ironing their clothes for the next day.&nbsp; My anger at work was rooted in my fear.&nbsp; I couldn't avoid fights with the kitchen manager.&nbsp; I never trusted the general manager.&nbsp; Who cares, though?&nbsp; It didn't matter.&nbsp; I'm sure they were nice people, but I was wasting so much negativity over the fact that I wasn't doing what I wanted to be doing and taking it out on everyone in my path.<br /><br />My man says that my energy is completely different after just a couple of weeks.&nbsp; I think he's right.<br /><br />Three days before I quit, I asked if he'd sit with me at the La Brea tar pits while I burned my sweat-stained Oxford shirts.&nbsp; He didn't understand why I needed that.&nbsp; For me, it was all about making sure I had nothing left to remind me of the experience.&nbsp; It was so bitter.&nbsp; Here's how things have changed:&nbsp; Yesterday, while running around my house preparing for my next client, consulting on someone's home gym, and plannning a hosting gig I have this weekend, I realized the shirts were still in my laundry.&nbsp; I had forgotten how important it was to angrily and spitefully torch my uniform in a symbolic inferno.&nbsp; I stopped for a second and thought about it.&nbsp; If not for CPK, I would not have gotten the hugest gig yet (which I still can't talk about but it's going to be on TV!), I wouldn't have been able to support myself out of living in that damn Herbalife office, and I wouldn't have met my boyfriend.&nbsp; <br /><br />I realized then I didn't need to burn the shirts, so instead, I just pissed on them."

"event","For about 4 weeks, with the exception of my week in New York, I've changed a habit about myself that I'm so proud of I must tell you.&nbsp; I'm starting the morning very healthy.

Ok, here's the thing.&nbsp; I love the morning time.&nbsp; Ever since I was a kid, my favorite time of day are the 4 hours after I wake up.&nbsp; I've never been a late sleeper, even when I go to bed late.&nbsp; I love reading in the morning.&nbsp; i love showering.&nbsp; I love exercising in the morning, but most of all, I LOVE breakfast.

I'm not healthy all day, but I like being healthy in the morning because nothing gets in my way in the morning.&nbsp; The phone is quiet.&nbsp; The house is empty.&nbsp; It's great.

After 5 years of being healthy, I know what I need to put in my body to look and feel great, and about 4 weeks ago I started experimenting with how to get EVERYTHING I need for my skin and my soul and my muscles first thing in the morning.&nbsp; The hard part was developing a morning diet that wasn't high calorie.

I made a smoothie recipe that doesn't taste like a smoothie.&nbsp; it's a beautiful blue-purple colored, four fucking course meal in a glass with a side 6-ounce cup of high-in-antioxidant flavored coffee, one 8-ounce glass of water, and an 8-ounce glass of my green, white, and yerba mate blend iced tea (email me for that recipe if you want it.)

My skin is clearer and less red.&nbsp; My energy is better.&nbsp; My sleep is deeper.&nbsp; And my ambition is stronger.&nbsp; 

here is my recipe for a PERFECT 554 calorie smoothie called the Sapphire Smoothie that will leave you full until lunch, fill you with fiber and quality proteins, settle the constant guilt and panic over reaching your daily fruit servings, and start your day a tad more joyful.&nbsp; HINT:&nbsp; While the recipe is precise, you can cut out the tedious measuring by blending the non-frozen ingredients once a week into a ziplock ready pack.&nbsp; 

BASE:
3/4 Cup Water (0 Calories)&nbsp; *6 oz toward your 3 quart a day recommendation
1/2 Cup Unsweetened Soy Milk (35 Calories)&nbsp; *prevents heart disease, low sugar
1/4 Cup (Non Fat Lactose Free Milk (22.5 Calories)&nbsp; *better for skin and digestion
3 Ice cubes (0 calories) *another 6 ounces of water and thickness toward your smoothie

Fruit:
1/2 Banana (50 Calories) *Eat the other half for another 50 calories so you get to chew something, protects against anemia, high fiber, tastes great
1/2 Cup Frozen Blueberries (50 calories) *It's the best food for you on the planet.
1/2 Cup frozen Strawberries (30 calories) *You're up to 3 servings of fruit now!

Supplements:
2 Teaspoons Flaxseed (15 Calories) *Cheap, increases circulation, replenish skin, tastes better than salmon, high fiber
2 Oz Aloe Vera juice (4 Calories) *Replenish skin, no taste when mixed with fruit, improves digestion
1 Splenda (0 Calories) *who doesn't love sweetness?
1 Scoop Muscle Milk protein (150 calories) TASTES AWESOME.&nbsp; High in GOOD fats.&nbsp; high in Fiber.&nbsp; 
1 Scoop Isopure protein (105 calories) *make sure to match protein flavors. I like cookies and cream and strawberry. Isopure protein is the best protein quality in the world.

Extra:
1/2 tablespoon unsalted crunchy natural peanut butter (52.5 calories) *A small portion of natural peanut butter goes a long way.&nbsp; It's that little indulgence that makes the shake.&nbsp; Add it at the end.&nbsp; Nuts are a great source of fiber, protein and love.

I'm serious.&nbsp; Your skin and your energy when combined with green tea and a cup of coffee will change almost instantly.&nbsp;"

I can't think of a more exciting time in my life for American politics.&nbsp; As a social minority, watching the constant coverage of the Democratic primaries has been inspiring and validating.&nbsp; Our focus is on choosing a woman, or an African American, or maybe both, to undo the wrongs of the Conservative non-vision.

What we are finding in this election year is that unlike 2004, so-called ""family values"" are not as important in choosing a leader.&nbsp; We have seen that candidates who focus on abstinence, verbal gay-bashing, and trying to reverse abortion laws are terrible with money and worse with fighting terror.&nbsp; And that's a damn shame for Mormon Bank accounts everywhere.

We need a candidate who already knows that we are all equal under God AND the law and that we have bigger fish to fry then legislating morality.&nbsp; America finally gets it.&nbsp; We're talking for the first time in 10 years about Universal Health Care.&nbsp; We're passionate about bringing 18 year old kids home before they lose another limb, or their precious heartbeat.&nbsp; We want to stop home foreclosures and raise up the middle class.

And we're trusting the minority profiles we never thought were options in our country in Clinton and Obama.&nbsp; Either way, as a gay man, I win because I am somehow represented by a leader who bucks the norm and who has promised to have empathy for my struggle per her Vagina or his culturally giant penis.&nbsp; 

And why does a racial and a gender precedent seem so important?

Because unlike 2004, when President Bush threatened to write discrimination into the constitution and we elected him anyway, Americans now have seen what executive discrimination is capable of.&nbsp; We have a president who has set a bad example for compassionate conservatism.&nbsp; Hurricane Katrina and all of the death and poverty and destruction that followed has shown us that Republican WASPs are not our compassionate friend, they're actually biggots.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're our alcoholic grandfathers that forget to tip and love to rage.

I'm so happy to see the homemade signs, the conversations among strangers, OPRAH endorsements, Bill Clinton exhausted from his travels, young people registering, my mom asking me who to vote for...I'm so happy and proud for the first time to be an American and I'm so excited for tomorrow and my first trip to New York to watch it all go down.&nbsp;

How do you know when your fears about life are real and maybe probable, or just imagined irrationally as a way to avoid the complexities of adulthood?&nbsp; On what day do you decide to go for it and risk it all because you can, instead of wondering if their is just too much evidence telling you no?

When do you see your past as just that: the past, and not likely to happen again...and how do you know that your past didn't exist to prepare you for problems staring you in the face?

How do you know when you're just creating drama and how do you know when you're just trying to protect yourself?

Everything I knew a year ago is different now. My opinions have all changed.&nbsp; My thinking is no longer black and white.&nbsp; There is no good and evil, just shades of gray that I was never able to articulate until now.&nbsp; My dreams are different and my dreads are darker.&nbsp; I cry now during movies and I'm actually listening to people when they talk.&nbsp; I'm making eye contact.&nbsp; I say, ""I'm sorry"" and I mean it.

I don't hate girls.&nbsp; I don't think everyone's trying to kill me.&nbsp; I don't NEED to eat THAT.&nbsp; I don't feel bad about sleeping pills.&nbsp; 

It's all up side down.&nbsp; I'm sorting it out now.

I miss you.

I'm ok.&nbsp; I sound a lot more dramatic than I am.&nbsp; I'm learning to try not to control my external enviornment so much and work on my internal, as prescribed by OA.&nbsp; This new way of thinking is just scary sometimes because I'm so used to controling everyone and everything around me, leaving me alone with just a basket of onion rings.&nbsp; ;)

Becoming a trainer to help people lose weight seemed a lot sexier before I bought my test packet.&nbsp; Since I've gone to the workshops and started studying, and talked to other trainers...it kind of scares the crap out of me.

I look at these trainers.&nbsp; Beefcake dudes, many are hot and stupid and I feel two major negative thoughts:
1) This job is for idiots.
2) How can I train people when I don't have a perfect body?

It is so sales-oriented.&nbsp; And my dad is a salesman, so I have that in my genes, I think.&nbsp; But I think the people I can really help are the overweight guys and girls who are ready to make a change.&nbsp; I know them.&nbsp; I am them.&nbsp; And here in LA, those people don't really pay for a high end gym membership...obviously.&nbsp; I never did, either.&nbsp; So somehow, Grandma, I've got to either learn how to sell to non-fat people WHO MAY EVEN HAVE BETTER BODIES THAN ME (most of them) or walk up to the few fat people at the gyms and say, ""Hi.&nbsp; You are HUGE.&nbsp; Let's go for a walk.""

Is there something shameful about taking people's money to coddle them through bicep curls?

So, what makes me different from the rest of these people?&nbsp; Well, I did it.&nbsp; I lost the weight these people want to lose, assuming I work with people who want to lose weight-and I kept it off.&nbsp; I know how to do it and I want to help.&nbsp; And any time someone, including myself asks the question, ""What makes YOU think you have the balls to train people?"" I just have to look at the pictures on my myspace page and note that if I don't put myself out there to help, they may never find help at all.

Thanks for your help.&nbsp; May I have some pancakes please?

Love,
Sean"

"event","I'm sitting in my living room, a wide open space listening to a slow tune by the one and only Reba Mcentire,&nbsp; ""New Fool at an Old Game"" and it is cheesy and exactly how I feel.

A kid out of school trying to find my way/but i don't know the rules/teach me how to play/im just a new fool at an old game

Change is everywhere in my 29th year.&nbsp; My job is about to shuffle, my roommate is moving out soon, I'm discovering OA and had a major breakthrough about my family.&nbsp; Something has been constant through it all during these last 6 months, and that's my relationship, but even that's new, and especially new for me.&nbsp; Sometimes, with all the turbulence and excitement around me I get defensive and agitated and start to question my love life. Is this love? &nbsp; Sometimes there's no turbulence at all, and I'm not used to not living in Chaos, and that's when it seems appropriate to blow a hurricane into my day.

I have this fairy tale check list of what I want in a man, and if the checklist doesn't match up perfectly every so often, I panic.&nbsp; Is this love?&nbsp; Am I settling because I'm more judgemental of these people than he is?&nbsp; EEEEEWW...he did THAT before he met me...sick.&nbsp; I hope he washed his hands afterward.&nbsp; Is he a republican?&nbsp; He didn't laugh at my hysterical joke...he. just.doesn't. get. it.!&nbsp;&nbsp; He is staring at that guy and he's standing next to me.&nbsp; What an asshole.&nbsp; Can't he wait till I'm gone to cruise?&nbsp; Oh, he's not cruising.&nbsp; He's trying to get that guy's attention because he's our waiter.&nbsp; WHY IS HE WEARING A SCARF IN L.A.?

But most of the time the checklist DOES match up, and then sometimes I panic and wonder what to do with the success of our relationship.&nbsp; Fuck, THIS is love.&nbsp; I have a white picket fence with him, the kind you read about.&nbsp; We're perfect together, seriously.&nbsp; People groan when we cuddle. And that's scary because now people know I'm happy.&nbsp; I'm making eye contact and being vulnerable.&nbsp; Shit.&nbsp; There must be a gas leak SOMEWHERE. &nbsp; And that makes me wonder, ""Do I have the work experience to complete this job? He's a maserati but I learned to drive on a Ford F150.&nbsp; I'm totally going to get&nbsp; fired, like that time I got hired to do payroll."" Sometimes with just a phrase or a tone, I feel 13 again and really fat and wonder why the fuck I have a lover and I get scared. But I'm not fat (163.2 lbs to be exact, and no sugar or compulsive eating in 56 days!"") and I do have a lover...and I'm still a little scared.

And sometimes I want to violently shake him and say, ""YOU DON'T REALIZE WHAT A BETTER FUCKING PERSON I AM SINCE YOU CAME ALONG!""&nbsp; And I want to punch him in the shoulder like a buddy, over and over...then shake him some more and say ""YOU MAKE ME SO FUCKING HAPPY AND IT SCARES ME!"" Then I want to start biting him and say ""I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO MAKE THIS RELATIONSHIP WORK AND I WISH YOU CAME WITH A WORK BOOK!""&nbsp; Then I'd start pinching his cheeks really, really hard and ask, ""DO YOU MIND IF I FUCK UP A FEW HUNDRED TIMES AND STILL CRASH AT YOUR PLACE!?!?!?!""

But I gotta stay cool, because now he's bleeding.&nbsp; And that's not love. Or maybe it is."

This fucking sucks.&nbsp; I ran the half marathon two weeks ago and then started training for the LA marathon.&nbsp; My left knee has been in a lot of pain since and I've had to stop running.&nbsp; My doctor think I shouldn't run the marathon, so I decided I just needed better shoes.

I bought running shoes and a knee brace today after taking 10 days off.&nbsp; I got less than a kilo away from the house and already my knee is sore again.&nbsp; I hate this.

I love running.&nbsp; I can't stop.&nbsp; Further, it's how I stay fit.&nbsp; It's a big part of my life, my confidence, my security.&nbsp; No matter where I go, I always have time and space to put on some shorts and take off.

And now I can't.&nbsp; I'm scared of getting fat.&nbsp; I'm afraid I've peaked physically.&nbsp; I'm afraid I won't be able to run a marathon before I'm 30, you know, like everyone else.

I decided I'll just go lift today instead and try to take the treadmill class as a walk tomorrow, so my trainer can see what I'm doing wrong.&nbsp; Since I won't wait tables from Friday thru Wednesday, I'll lay up and just hope I get better.&nbsp; Say a prayer for me. Ask the big guy to help me out if he's not too busy planning the conception of the next Spears child.

"event","Dear Grandma,

I inherited two things from you:

Your mug collection
Your irrational fear that someone might not like you.

Only I realized that when you did it is was because you really felt like you had to work harder to make people like you, probably because you were short.&nbsp; I did it because I was fat and invisible, but I'm not, anymore.

I process it in different ways, most recently by saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.&nbsp; Sometimes I meet new people and I'm afraid they will think I'm a deuche bag so I'm quiet or real risky with a joke, or I stutter.&nbsp; Or sometimes I just say the wrong thing all together.&nbsp; Like Today at work, a coworker started crying and asked me to make her laugh so I said, ""I Have JAUNIDICE inside my WEINER.""&nbsp; She didn't care for that one.&nbsp; 

Last night I met someone at a party, a friend of my boyfriend...real pretty gal.&nbsp; I said, ""Hi.""&nbsp; She said, ""OH MY GOD, IT's SO GOOD TO MEET YOU!&nbsp; WHY HAVEN'T YOU COME TO OUR WRITERS GROUP?""

I felt kind of on the spot, like I don't go to my boyfriends writer's group because, it's HIS writers group, for one.&nbsp; Second, I've been in writers groups with a lot of women, and it's a lot of whining and child molestation stories and conversations about flow levels and I don't care for those conversations because I don't really flow...and further, grandma, why does every woman I meet, who finds out I'm gay start talking to me like I'm fucking JACK from Will and Grace?&nbsp; Women go from ""He's just trying to fuck me so I'll be an ice bitch"" to...""Oh wow he's gay...I wonder if he can hook me up at Crate and Barrell.""

Now I'm not saying this girl was DOING that, I'm sure she wasn't in fact...but I was nervous and when I'm nervous I get shy or I make a joke-- so when she asked why I don't go to MY BOYFRIENDS WRITERS GROUP I said...""because I'm a garbage man, not a writer....""

Not the funniest line, I know.&nbsp; Not even very coherent, probably.&nbsp; 

But I could have responded with, ""Because I hate women.""&nbsp; which I don't, but in that moment, kind of did....and i tried to be somewhat cool.

She didn't get my joke, neither did my boyfriend.&nbsp; I'm not sure I got it, either.&nbsp; Here I am trying to be fucking charming as fast as I god damn can to get closer to the Sam Adam's tap just inches away, and I stumble and say something awkward.

It turns into a conversation with my boyfriend this morning that's kind of heated, where he says he just wishes I didn't feel so awkward around new people, didn't try so hard, could get out of my head, could seperate being on stage with being off.&nbsp; I get angrier and angrier that I'm not the schmoozer, the people person he is.&nbsp; Even though most days I don't have time to return the emails and phone calls I get from friends...because I'm lucky enough to have a lot of friends who know I AM a people person...

And now we're kind of fighting and I feel like a psycho, an asshole, a fat fuck...all because I I'm afraid that this girl thinks I'm not as funny as I should be to be dating her friend.

I'm laying there in bed and I realize the only person who doesn't feel good enough about me is me.&nbsp; But the boyfriend doesn't give a shit if someone thinks I'm weird.&nbsp; And if he did think I was too weird to date he'd dump me and I'd find someone who didn't.&nbsp; But he's ok with it, anyway, so why am I making this into such a big fucking deal?

Because I'm a Hetherington.

I Yam whose I YAM.&nbsp; I say weird things sometimes.&nbsp; I'm inapropriate on a rainy day, sometimes on the partly cloudy ones, too.&nbsp; I think penis jokes are funny.&nbsp; Sometimes, I forget rules and people's feelings.&nbsp; I'm also funny and honest and your grandson, and that makes me totally hot.&nbsp; It doesn't mean I'm not going to try to be a little more adult even when I want to put a whooppee cushion on an uppity casting director's sofa.&nbsp; I will try.&nbsp; But when the joke bombs and I get called on it, I'm not going to blame anyone else, nor am I going to fear becoming public enemy number one.&nbsp; I'm just going to write you a note and tell you, because you think I'm a freakin' genius.&nbsp; I love making you laugh.

Tell Grandpa that last night I called someone's hometown ""The asshole of creation"" just like he would have, and it killed.

Love,
Sean"

I finally shared this morning in one of these meetings.&nbsp; We read a story about someone who was handicap and planned her whole day around overcoming her handicap, then realizing she couldn't fix her disability she'd abuse herself with food all night.

I realized that since I've lost weight and discovered my excess skin, I plan my mornings around exercising, taking abs classes, spinning, and weight lifting hoping that I can make it go away.&nbsp; Then, when my belly is still there three hours later and I start hating myself, I look to the rest of the world--my friends, my boyfriend, roommate, my coworkers, strangers, to validate my body in other ways to make up for the disappointment I feel.&nbsp; 

When that doesn't come, because no one can validate me more than I devalue my own body, I punish myself with food.&nbsp; Out of fear, I start the same crazy workout over again the next day.&nbsp; IT. SUCKS.

I keep remembering the story you told me of how you became an alcoholic.&nbsp; That grandpa would come home drunk and mean and you got sick of feeling it, so you thought, ""If I can't beat 'em, I'll join 'em.""&nbsp; It makes me think that in some way, each day I go into things optimistic like you did, and then some crazy asshole steps up to my soul around lunchtime and treats me like shit, so I turn into one also.&nbsp; That crazy asshole lives somewhere near my earlobe and is a serious retard, but his house is made of brick so he's not going anywhere.

Both you and grandpa found your way out of the drinking before I was born, and I hope I can, too with food.&nbsp; I continue to use your voice as a shield when that asshole pokes at me when the morning glory wears off.&nbsp; 

It's really nice to visit with you again.&nbsp; And sooner or later I'm sure the people who see me everyday will appreciate not having the responsibility of validating me...because I'm getting it from you until I learn how to do it myself.

Damn my hair looks good these days.

Love,
Sean"

Tonight I will not be going to a meeting, but I will tomorrow.&nbsp; 

I ate a dinner salad with shrimp and chicken and goat cheese for dinner, but I'm still a little hungry and I'm going out to dinner with my boyfriend before a show.&nbsp; 

i really want some toast with butter, and maybe some jelly and an egg or three and a hamburger patty.&nbsp; But I'll probably settle for toast, because what I really want right now is something carby and buttery.&nbsp; I'll make it wheat.

The meeting last night had no gay men and that made me sad.&nbsp; I think more gay men should save themselves from food addiction and body self-loathing, and now!&nbsp; but that's probably because it will take the attention off of me.&nbsp; The people I'm meeting are all telling my story, male or female, gay or straight.&nbsp; I eat for 2 but exercise for 4, I hate my body, I hate my brain...but when I work through the bullshit I feel ok.&nbsp; 

It's a good feeling to know I just have to get through one more meal tonight, and that the hardest part of the day is over.

Going to work and waiting on people...preparing THEIR food and drinks and watching them slurp it down without crying or getting fat makes me want to pinch them really hard until they bleed...instead, I usually drink coffee or overeat in the back--but it's been almost a week now, and I'm dealing with it in other ways...imagining each of them imploding.

Miss you.

I went back to the gym today to lift a little weight.&nbsp; I went because I miss it, and because I haven't seen a couple of friends I like to touch base with mostly, but I was also a little afraid of being fat.&nbsp; I stayed off the cardio and my bumm knee, which sucked but I got a ton of sympathy about it from various acquaintences, which I milked like a prized cow.

I purposely got there at 9:30 since I knew I could only stay until 10:30.&nbsp; I worked out for an hour.&nbsp; I ran into a friend who also used to be heavy and told him about how powerless I feel and what I'm doing about it.&nbsp; He kind of shrugged it away as being just another bad day for a gay man when I told him the story I told you last night.

The weirdest part though, was that I ran into another friend, his ex, actually...and he's always probing into my life...asking me about my boyfriend, my food issues, etc.&nbsp; He's doing his dissertation right now to become a therapist, and he's also in recovery, so he's not being a dick, he's just really interested.&nbsp; So I told him what I was doing, also...feeling kind of backed into a corner by his sincere questions.

He was thrilled for me and encouraged me.&nbsp; We talked as we lifted.&nbsp; he told me things he's noticed about me, that I work out too much, that I seem discontent with myself. I was glad I wasn't crazy.&nbsp; We talked about addiction and his struggle...it felt so good.&nbsp; Someone out there gets it.&nbsp; More people than I thought.

I left at 10:30 like I said and came back for lunch before work.&nbsp; I had a turbo tea today but have no plans to go buy them by bulk.&nbsp; I think I'm kind of over that nonsense, but you know, one day at a time.

I think I decided today that Crunch is a bad place for me right now because I can't stop comparing myself to the V-Shaped muscles that snort coke in the locker room.

Lunch this afternoon was awesome. One small piece of chicken, a bowl of soup, and a sugar-free pudding.&nbsp; IF I WAS A FITNESS NAZI, I'd say it was 500 calories.&nbsp; I made myself some homemade iced green/white tea.&nbsp; Now I'm off to work.&nbsp; I remembered a conversation we had once while I was in the shower last night.&nbsp; i want to see if you remember it.&nbsp; I'll drop a note this evening if I have time.

Love,
Sean"

And you can be an alcoholic and still be hot.&nbsp; Look at Lindsey Lohan.&nbsp; On the other hand, overeaters look like Louie Anderson.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm a fucking joke if I own this.&nbsp; People won't even believe it.&nbsp; I'm not fat, so how can I be stashing powerbars in my car in case I'm stuck in traffic for more than 25 minutes and still eating 7-8 meals a day?<br /><br />I hate that I have to be honest about this, but this is when I turn to you.&nbsp; You were always honest...always funny...always sweet, too.&nbsp; I want that...not to be it...just to feel it from you.&nbsp; I miss you.<br /><br />Love,<br />Sean"

"event","Hi Grandma,

I'm sitting here in my kitchen writing you a letter, though you've been dead for almost 10 years.&nbsp; I'd like to think we've both grown a lot in that time, you from 4 feet 11 inches to something taller than the clouds...and me from 275 pounds kid to Border's book Club Preferred Club Card holder.

I'm writing you to ask a couple of favors.&nbsp; Remember when I was a kid and we'd come to visit, you'd read the bible to me before bed and make me do my prayers on my knees asking God to bless the people around me?&nbsp; I never wanted you to leave that room so we'd try to bless everyone, including the hummingbirds we'd fed that morning, the feeder that would bring them back tomorrow, your next door neighbor who may have been using crack, your hairdresser who was the nicest black person you'd ever met, and the butcher for having grandpa's ham ready on time so you could make him his favorite sandwich to eat during the 5 'o clock news.

Well that was all I really knew about God as a kid.&nbsp; That he made the good things happen and all you had to do was ask.&nbsp; And after he did it you should say thank you if you think of it, but that he kind of already knew you were thankful.&nbsp; He also kind of knew what you'd ask for, too, so if you forgot to ask--he usually had your back.&nbsp; The older I got and the further your memory drifts away from me, the harder God has been hiding from me.&nbsp; Some people think he's a stage manager on FoxNews.&nbsp; Some think he's looking for a frisky touch in a public bathroom.&nbsp; Some think he's not even a he, but a she and that he may have nothing to do with Jesus.&nbsp; Some people think he's a fat Asian guy!

And it's kind of fucking with me.

So I'm in my kitchen right now, and I was affraid to come in here to write this to you, because being near the kitchen is so close to the fridge and the pantry and I skipped abs class today so I'm all nuts right now.&nbsp; I feel scared and fat and unsettled.&nbsp; I don't feel hungry but I know that doesn't mean I couldn't eat.&nbsp; I'm wearing long p.j.'s but that doesn't mean I can't feel frumpy for not having been to the gym in three days.

You never knew me this way, actually.&nbsp; You only saw me fat and happy and told me how handsome I was.&nbsp; You thought I was funny and sensitive and sweet.&nbsp; You saw me asexual and unlimited in potential and though at times you were just some old lady who didn't know her head from her ass, I kind of believed what you thought of me. 

Until I actually became it.&nbsp; 

I'm just about done writing this letter to you and I stayed away from the kitchen.&nbsp; I'm not hungry nor hateful.&nbsp; I'm kind of peaceful and relaxed as I get ready for work.&nbsp; I didn't even ask you my favors yet, and you seem to know what they are.

When i think of God these days, your presence keeps tapping me.&nbsp; I liked your God as a kid and it took care of me, and since I think you're with Him now, or at least closer than I am considering JetBlue doesn't fly out of West Hollywood yet, I'm going to try to check in with you a little more often and ask for you to help me get through the day without hurting myself with complusive behavior.&nbsp; I hope that's ok.

And I'm going to cover up the scale and the mirror with you and your various knitting projects because those numbers and images sting like Kerosene sometimes.&nbsp; I'm going to remember how I used to school you in UNO 22 rounds in a row and then roll my eyes in boredom at your praise of my brilliance.

There will be some shitty moments during this time, but that's when I'll need you most so tell grandpa to ""Make his own God Damn sandwich!"", just like you did back then.&nbsp; And if I somehow forget to thank you or ask for help...I hope you'll send me a text or something..."

"event","Fat people don't care what they look like when they're fucking.&nbsp; 

C'mon, you've seen big black girls dancing.&nbsp; They'll grind those rolls up against the hottest guys in the club and leave them begging for more.&nbsp; They'll cook a sausage under those arms while they're giving a hand job.&nbsp; They'll open their legs and won't give a second thought to the smell of burned almonds wafting through their thighs.

But once you've lost that weight, if you're so lucky to do so, it's a different story.&nbsp; There was a time when I was first skinny that I couldn't even go to a club and dance because I saw myself as I did before, a lispy John Candy.&nbsp; And I still remember the first guy I was ever with.&nbsp; I kept my shirt on while I blew him.&nbsp; True story.

That was in December of 2003.&nbsp; As I approach 4 years on November 29 of reaching my goal weight (under 172.5 pounds) I still have those days where dancing, or bouncing back into a cock, or laying naked with another makes me want to be invisible.

For a long time I satisfied this by masturbation with porn.&nbsp; i was alone and could see hot guys who couldn't see me. &nbsp; We all got what we wanted.&nbsp; Then I added a partner here and there.

I avoided positions where the looser skin would hang and swing back and forth like pork in Chinatown.&nbsp; I preferred being on my back, especially with a girdle or some kind of small cat laying atop my abdomen, sheilding my shame from the various gentlemen.

I preferred latinos, asians, and blacks because they seemed to appreciate the extra fat as I perceived it.&nbsp; Also, their English was usually bad and so they didn't ask questions.&nbsp; This is the shit that goes through my mind when I should be writhing in ecstasy.&nbsp; My boyfriend now is white, and I never thought I'd be into that.&nbsp; He'd want to know what it was, why I couldn't always stay hard then, why I couldn't cum without some serious dedication to the craft of cumming.&nbsp; Because in my mind it was a craft, nearly impossible magic like a ship in a bottle.

I thought he'd never appreciate my need for Barry White CD's or an occasional giggle to lighten this very SERIOUS mood I'd created in bed.&nbsp; FOCUS.&nbsp; He's getting louder, so he's close...and you, SEAN HETHERINGTON are still kissing his neck and thinking about how weird it is that you have a penis inside you.&nbsp; I thought he wouldn't understand how I like it rough sometimes, how sometimes I just need to be talked to like a bitch.&nbsp; Wait...that part is just for me to hear.

It took months and it's ongoing, really for me sexually to get to the place the rest of the world is.&nbsp; To me, when someone says, ""It's JUST sex"" they're missing the point.&nbsp; My fat ass didn't have it, real sex until I was 27.&nbsp; I'm a Christian like that...or just a rookie.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong.&nbsp; I love sex...I love it too much sometimes...and I LOVE it with the guy I do it with consistently.&nbsp; My challenge is to get to a place where sex IS JUST sex, where I take it for granted like the rest of the teenage girls in the projects, and I'm close...I'm close...I'm...so...close....FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (pass the cigarette)

If it's true that ""Sex is the best a human being can feel physically"", then I'm on my way.&nbsp; Right now, I'm working on the mental part and that's worth the work.&nbsp; It pays tenfold.&nbsp; The older I get, the more I love my body and the more I want to fuck myself, and I'll be doing that all day November 29."

"event","A guy who asked me on the first date if I'd like to move in with he and his mother in Korea town, a guy who asked if I'd pee on him, a guy who collected teddy bears, a guy with a kid and a sex addiction, and a few guys who were absolutely perfect...so perfect in fact that I couldn't stand talking to them...

4 years of serial dating, stabbing expectations in the heart after 3 weeks of dating at a time, dreams of being happily committed--buried like an episode of Dexter.

Sentence fragments that do not lend well to quality writing...

After breaking things off with an awesome guy last Spring I gave in and decided to be single...maybe even celibate.&nbsp; I wasn't asking for a guy anymore.&nbsp; I was asking for answers.&nbsp; Why was I looking so hard for a guy to make my life complete?&nbsp; I had finally stopped sleeping with people because I was lonely and bored, and I stopped overeating for the same reasons.&nbsp; I was getting it.&nbsp; I was hanging out with my friends more, and being alone more, too.&nbsp; I was so balanced and comfy walking alone to get sushi on Friday nights and going home to write, and falling asleep just before 11 PM, instead of spending the evening getting torked and blowing someone behind PinkBerry.&nbsp; I was reconnecting to the fat person in my soul in a way, the outsider that grew passionate about being non-sexual, about being alone and enjoying my space.&nbsp; I was Miss Independent...I was the Kelly Clarkson that Kelly Clarkson wants to be.

I was figuring out how to end my 20's. I discovered some of my life's purpose.&nbsp; The first time I had the nerve to say what I wanted to do with my life was to a guy I met one night after my set at the Akbar this past summer.&nbsp; I just trusted him.&nbsp; I felt like I knew him.&nbsp; 

I was funny again. I was writing more and performing more and loving that, too.

But now, I had met this guy and I'd promised myself NO MORE...no more looking for a guy to make me forget about reality so I could live with my head in the clouds, who I'd only have sex with a couple of times, anyway.

But when love takes you in, and trust me, love does takes you in--it's so hard to fight because the feeling is so euphoric...especially at first when he's not asking you to pee on him.&nbsp; ""MOM, I'M IN LOVE.&nbsp; WHY?&nbsp; BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO PEE ON ME!!!""&nbsp; I met someone who I liked hanging out with more than anyone else, and we do almost every day.&nbsp; We go on Weekend Trips together with NO BREAKS FROM EACH OTHER FOR DAYS AT A TIME.&nbsp; No time for me to leave and fix my hair or think of witty topics to dazzle him with my charming yet manufactured hilarity...just me, warts and all, with him during the silent times of nothingness....&nbsp; 

It's the first time I've really felt true love.&nbsp; Can you believe it took me until 29 to find it?&nbsp; You've seen what a snack I am.&nbsp; 

I am&nbsp; so ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" in my attachment to him.&nbsp; Spending time together is just what we do and even after four months, it's so new to me--a person who grew up alone or with non-sexual friends as my safety shield to the outside world.&nbsp; 

He's the only person I've had sex with since the day I met him.&nbsp; Isn't that so weird?&nbsp; And it's awesome (seriously, he's a great lay).&nbsp; It feels like our bodies were designed as custom electrical sockets.&nbsp; We're a Home Depot dream accessory.&nbsp; And even when we fight, it's time we get to spend TOGETHER.&nbsp; We don't fight over right or wrong.&nbsp; We fight over understanding.&nbsp; We're the healthiest gay actor/performer son of crazy people couple I know of.&nbsp; It's scary.

It's scary.&nbsp; The fat person in me is scared because I never thought I'd ever leave sushi night (solo) for Bennigan's to share a Turkey O' Toole (add tomato).&nbsp; The gay person in me is scared because I'm not out being burned by the latest trick at the gym.&nbsp; The independent bitch in me is scared of losing myself, that I'm allowing a guy in to make my life complete and DR. PHIL SAYS THATS WRONG!...I'm scared...and that brings out the worst in me.

But he brings out the best in me.&nbsp; And that's what I was missing before that night at the Akbar."

Same price.<br /><br />Ok, then I'd put a dent in&nbsp;some loans and debt that friends have.&nbsp; I'd anonymously pay their bills.&nbsp; I'd hold like $200,000 for this.&nbsp; I'd quit my job for a year and take classes.&nbsp; Improv, acting, writing courses five days a week.&nbsp; I'd buy a couple lifetime gym memberships.&nbsp; 200,000 more to cover tuition and fees for all this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />50,000 a year in living expenses for the next two years also.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd only use Charmin.&nbsp; I'd buy brand name fabric softener, too.&nbsp; I'd fly once...just ONCE on an airline without boarding groups.<br /><br />Oh, and I should buy a condo to invest in property.&nbsp; I'd pay cash since my credit sucks.&nbsp; I'd want a nice place close to the 10 freeway that didn't need a bunch of work.&nbsp; Two bedrooms with nice windows.&nbsp; Here in LA that'd be 1.5 mil.<br /><br />Oh, I'd buy my parents house for a half million, too.&nbsp; WAY more than they paid and charge them rent.&nbsp; Like $7.45 per month.<br /><br />My bills would be paid...everything...Everyone who helped me survive during these hard years would feel like I appreciated them for all the support they give me.&nbsp; I'd be on a 24 month schedule to become a star in the comedy world and if it didn't work out, I could still go back to CPk and start over but with a free house and car and a Wrestlemania under my belt.<br /><br />Oh.&nbsp; that other 12 mil.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; People shouldn't have that kind of money.&nbsp; Well, people should...but not ONE person who didn't really earn it.&nbsp; That's Paris Hilton wage.&nbsp; People with that kind of money invent religions in bathroom stalls over a line of blow.&nbsp; I want just a little help, then I want to make triple that on my own.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So instead, I'd give it to charity.&nbsp; I would.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; I'd give it to the faggiest group of under dogs I could find.&nbsp; I'd start a pFlag under a bridge in Topeka, Kansas with GOLD tables for them to sell pink lemonade and cupcakes.&nbsp; </p>"

"event","I think it would be fun if you had sex with your partner in holiday themes.&nbsp; 

On Halloween it's lots of Candles and the Thriller album.&nbsp; Maybe you spook each other by randomly thrusting and yelling ""ARGHHH!""&nbsp; Or like on Arbor day, instead of planting a tree---you skip the condoms and try for a baby.&nbsp; On Canada day you take turns being on top.&nbsp; At Easter you hide behind your stuff naked with multi-colored zig zags painted on your belly and hope they find you.&nbsp; At Christmas you put a stocking on your wiener.&nbsp; On Grandparents day you skip the Viagara and blame your impotence on your fake hip.&nbsp; on July 4 you declare your love in caligraphy notes burned at the edges, then get drunk and bang on a river dock, just before dumping boxes of Costco sized teabags into the water.

It's Halloween and no one is knocking for candy.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; God damn I have to poo.&nbsp; And I know that as soon as I poo, the door will ring.&nbsp; I will wipe poorly, etc., etc., etc.

On New Year's Eve you hire a bunch of drunk teenagers to bang pots and pans together while you make love.&nbsp; On Martin Luther King day you just have phone sex, since only one of you will have the day off from work.&nbsp; On Pearl Harbor day you put on a lei and rape someone.&nbsp; 

WHERE ARE THESE KIDS?&nbsp; Is it because I live in an apartment?"

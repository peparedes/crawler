Wave Runner's rock the house!!!! i want a cottage on the lake!! oh well...today, i went out to breakfast with the love brids and lauren...im not to sure about this whole lauren thing..its kinda weird..Especially since Ray hangs out with her too! thats just fucked UP!...Anywayz, after that B-ton and IQ hung out again for the first time in a long time..i had a massive head ache so i didnt feel too good and i rammed into the back of jessie's car! WTF was i doing! i am soo pissed for doing that..im glad she doesnt hate me becuase i would kill someone if they ran into me, even if they were a close friend.  Bryan and Jessie are having problems again but i dont want to get into that becuase it is not to be shared with the viewing public.  Anyways thats all folks!
Good fight, Good night!"

I hate jealousy its just a terrible feeling and I'm dealing with it currently. I was hoping you guys can comment and help me with this issue T_T! its tearing me apart inside and it just sucks.

I went to my friends party and on the way to the park we picked up one of his friends that i met once because she used to go to school with them. She was really nice and sweet ! Kindda reminded me of myself.

first let me tell you this:

Well i also like one of my guy friends, but now im trying to forget about him because i feel that he'll just hurt me anyway. he likes to flirt with other girls to make them feel special and that is just not right. It tears me up inside because i actually fall for his ""charm"" and yet i dont want to love him. He also thinks I'm geeky because i love anime and cosplaying (which i tell him i am because ...i am ^^) but then says it negatively and im thinking but your just like me but worse (he's a kinky guy), he probibly thinks im dumb too because for some reason its like the things i do and dont mean to do or say just come out wrong u know? i normally dont act like that around my other friends  !! so two things are agains me im a geek and dumb. I feel frustrated too because i know thats not me and not what im all about. He's like really confusing too because he says that he wants other girlfriends later on(flings he says) but he wants his actual wife (if u will) to like anime, cosplay, smart, blah blah. He told me once if i knew anyone thats cute and likes to cosplay and i said no because im the only one . so why would he say that because he knows i dont have other cosplaying friends that he'd be interested in . i know his taste too. he's picky. And i sometimes think ""am i your perfect special someone""? so its just very stupid and i dont know what to do anymore.

Ok! so back to what im talking about with jealousy: 

so the girl that we picked up! we dont really hang out with her cause she's more of a foreign friend. like she's not in our inner circle and we only seen her twice ! haha! ok so we were hanging out but i notice that the guy i like but dont want to like is always with her. I felt jealous then. I hated it. not them but just the fact i was jealous and feeling very terrible and broken inside. He'd occationally come over to me and poke me to make me squirm and give me attention but still i felt so jealous of the other girl. When i met her for the first time he was paying more attention to me and not her. How do i get over him? How do i stop feeling jealous and having this aching feeling inside? I think i'm just a jealous person. I had no idea. I never felt this way before. I feel like crap T_T !"

She senced some one was watching her from a tree and turned to see who it may be. No one but a cold gusty breeze. She could swear she heard a echoing chuckle. Lost in a daze she didn't noticed Duncan and her brother standing near. ""Hey, wake up!"" Toushiro said cheerfully. ""Is there something wrong?"" asked Duncan a little worried. Her eyes darted around a saw a figure spying them from a corner of the next house. She got up and ran to him. She could hear flapping wings a felt a great chilling wind but once she reached the corner he was gone. Her brother and little friend ran to her and asked what made her so worried. ""I there was someone here"" she said confused. A few minutes later it started to snow and there echoed the name ""Ashdel...""

I was also looking at Bermann (i dont know anything about them) also because there's no doubt that he wont fit in (shiro has a big head *cough cough*) and he's also tall.He is a little too mature for me though but i love to look at him ^_^ ! 

i was also looking at the F-16 head...hmm i donno. 

I also like tony!! always have haha!! but he's pretty much gone and very hard to get XD !

i guess i can try saving up for a FCS and if there is a limited doll that i absolutely love then i'll buy that one??? 

I'm still sticking to my original vampire idea haha ^_^ ! I really want a purple eyed doll so i'll go with that ^_^ ! uhh~ i always want more XD! and there is no way i can get all of them that i want T_T . *sigh* if only if only!~"

http://img.ecinter.net/co_img001/lutsdoll/etc/kdw02black-01.jpg

"event","wow it was awesome! I didnt get to enter in the oneoff lotery but i still had a great time!
Ok on with the report! 

After church i changed into my costume which is the character on my icon! sorry guys i totally forgot to take picture of actual people but i have pictures of dolls! But you can probibly find those on DOA ^_^;;! so me and my family drove for 2 hrs and once we got there it was very strange to see men in maid outfits XD ! once we got over the shock my parents droped me and my sister off. 
We stood in linke for maybe 10 min. and were greeted by the volks staff! Mr. shegeta was dressed as a pirate or a muskateer? Mikey was dressed as suiseiseki from rozen maiden and the only other i  knew the name of was haruhi from suzumiya haruhi. 

I sat down at a table and met these really nice ladies! I forgot their names T_T  sorry! i remember the tsukasa girl though ^0^ ! i had fun chatting with them, running around,looking at oneoffs( the camera man was filming me taking pictures of them O_O!!), eating food, chatting with the staff, ect.

I got to talk with Hide and (forgot her name) the woman dressed in a white japanese top and red skirt! they were both really nice! If i remember correctly Hide workes at the kyoto volks store and the girl worked as a faceup artist. We talked about naruto (they were both fans ^-^) and the girl took a picture of me ~ all that time we were waiting for the bathroom and hide knocked on the door and i think one of the workers felt i'll. poor guy!

After all the voting and costent winning they did the lottery!!! round one was $20 to the volks store, second round was $30, third round was $50 (i think), then came the seitenshi T.T! i got $20 so that eliminated my chances quickly T_T!

but it was fun!! my first experiance was really great!

I havent posted many pictures of my resin friends in a long time so i decided to take some today!
Kisa has a new wig from volks(http://volksusa.com/w9127.html). It suits her very well and im happy with it ^_^! She also has on a dress made by Atelier Momoni (http://www.denofangels.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17959).

Toushiro is happy because he finally has shoes!! yay for new shoes!!~ Plus i finally got the go ahead from him to extend my bjd family. He wants someone else to talk to besides his sister. Which is fine by me ^0^!

on another note my mom all of a sudden asked me to look out for chinatsu for her. which is strange because at first she didnt want to get her but now that she's hard to get she wants her *smacks palm on forehead*. So if anyone has one for a good price feel free to tell me ^_^ !

Another good note! Im going to attend the volks halloween party! ive said this before but now im going for sure! its going to be fun~!! i Havent gone to one of these before and im getting excited! for some odd reason i dreamed that my dad one a yosd in bingo O.o! so weird! hope that actually happens!hahahaha! 

oh yes and let me introduce Roxas to you! he's a ken ^_^ ! man i so hated puting him together! he's still loose but at least he's together. my fingers hurt so bad T.T! But at least i got to practice putting a faceup on him!!

"event","well lets see i have all of this week and next week is finals and then!!!!!! SUMMER VACATION!!!! so looking foward to that! just need to do some last min. assignments ^^;;! i also need to save my money for japan. wonder how much my cousins are bringing...i'll have to ask them later. anywho~ besides japan i need to have some extra cash for the ""volks store mini meet with Alyson""!! hope she can come! i think i'll get Toushiro some grey eyes and eyelashes for him and kisa. Oh! and see a ji named shane! haha cant wait! hmm and i must say i think im getting interested in SD13 Tony now x.X ! i like how mature he looks compaired to Toushiro. i think it'd be fun to have a mature-ish doll around. i really like those hounds too but i dont think they are me. if u catch my drift ^^;  but if i do get Tony i think im only gonna get the head cause with the body its really expensive T.T ! but ya he wont be bodyless for long. haha no not gonna leave him like that. But yes im so glad that i finally have a place to talk about doll stuff ^^ !

toushiro:hm? your already thinking about getting another one? jez -_- !
ten10:well...sortta
toushiro:dont do that buy me something!
ten10:ok...how about a faceup. u need one Xp

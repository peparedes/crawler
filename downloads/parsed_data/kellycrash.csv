"event","Bailey went back to school this morning.  She had been on a 3 week break.  Jacob was sad to see her go.  He kept saying, ""too! BAILEY!""  Meaning, ""I want to go to school too with Bailey"". 

Now we are home watching Max & Ruby and making the grocery list and menu for this week.  He's asking me for milk and putting a sippy cup down my shirt.  Thanks little guy.

The menu for this week is oh so exciting:

grilled cheese
soup

tacos
Mexican rice

hamburgers
french fries

breakfast for supper

pizza 

and the rest we'll just wing it.

We still have no house prospects.  I'm so frustrated.  I don't feel our realtor is really doing much to help us.  She's not very proactive.  She's probably frustrated with us.  Daniel wants new and the existing homes in our budget he's not too interested in.  If I email her it takes days to get a response.... Maybe I expect to much?"

I'm so frustrated with our house hunt.  We should be able to find a great house, no?  I mean it is a buyers' market, no?  Ugh.  So we did find a great house.  Nevermind it's got a pond in the backyard.  Nevermind that you can hear the Mass Pike from the yard.  It's a great house.  It's a good location for commuting and for places we go.  The two big negatives didn't scare us away because the pros outweigh the cons.  So we made an offer.  Our realtor said the avg. price per sq. ft. is about $140.  She measured the house to get the actual sq. footage or close to it.  We offered $160 sq. ft.  Still about $20k less than they were asking.  We expected them to counter and we expected to come up.  They countered at 3k above their asking price? wtf?  We countered back at their asking price but asked for closing costs to be included.  All we got was ""we're thinking about it...""  

So, we started to look into other options.  It's been 14 days.  2 days ago our realtor said they accepted a full price offer since the weekend on the house.  For real?  or a tactic to get us to come up on our price?  Before she mentioned this I was thinking of offering them their asking price and not asking for closing costs, but now I don't know what to think.  We're inclined to wait it out and see if it really does go under agreement.  I expected the listing status to change by now, but I have seen it take a week or so before the realtor's actually change it online.

Meanwhile we have no place to live in 2 months.... There are always options. Not like we'll be homeless, but this is just very frustrating.  I want to know where I am going to be living."

"event","<p>Not sure who still reads this or not.  I am very bad about posting here, but I update Facebook alot more often these days.  It's such a cool thing for reconnecting with old friends and keeping in touch with family all at the same time.  

We've been busy!  We put our house here in Apex/Cary up for sale in October.  After 41 days on the market we went under contract.  We are due to close 1/15/10.  I've got my fingers crossed all the hurdles we have to get through go smoothly.  The first one is over and done with.  The inspection went fine with only some minor things to repair/fix and that has all been taken care of.  This coming week we have the appraisal.  As long as everything appraises fine we should be all set.  The only other thing that could go wrong is something with the buyers' financing.   We signed a lease the week of Thanksgiving for a house about 2 miles away. 

Why are we moving only 2 miles away?   Daniel was layed off in February of this year &amp; although he was not out of work for any length of time, the job he accepted right away doesn't pay as much as he was making prior to.   Daniel makes really good money &amp; it was ridicolous really for us to be struggling and worried about finances.  He makes enough to cover the mortgage &amp; then so, but he could see the savings account slowly dwindling down month after month.  So, we decide to sell our house instead of being house poor.   We will be able to pay off a 401K loan he took to buy the house and be in much better shape.   Daniel also wants to move back to Massachusetts eventually.  Our goal is to have Bailey finish 1st grade here in June 2010 and relocate back to MA over the summer.  So the lease on the rental house is only for 6 months.  Hopefully, Daniel can obtain employment back in MA to make this all happen.  If not, no big deal.  I really love it here and this area.  The rental house is amazing!  I love it too.  It's not ours tho and there are things about it I would like to change, but we can't and shouldn't because it's not ours.  So whatever happens and wherever we are is fine by me.  I do miss the family up in Massachusetts.  I feel alone here in NC.  Although a great thing abou being here is that I get to see my family a lot more often than I ever did in MA that's for sure, but it doesn't feel like enough.  I want the kids to feel like they are a part of a family that is more than just us.  I want them to grow up playing with cousins and hanging out with Aunts/Uncles, etc.  

We celebrated our 10 year wedding aniversary last month.  It was actually on Black Friday!  We went shopping that afternoon at the mall and Daniel takes me into a jewerly store and asks if I want a &quot;Grandma ring&quot;.  Not sure what the heck he was talking about.  He showed me the sign.  It was a really cool looking ring.  I tried it on and it was beautiful.  I however wanted to look around.  You can't just spring this on a girl like that.  It requires shopping and looking and comparing and all that.  So we looked at one other store &amp; left.  He says, &quot;why didn't get you get something?&quot;  So we dropped the kids off with my brother &amp; came back to the mall.  I have finally figured out what I wanted.  One store we went in had a very helpful sales woman who really steered me right.  They had the best price, but were an unknown entity to me. Never heard of it.  So then we go to another store and their price is slightly higher.  The next store their price is higher &amp; they have no stores in the North East.  They were telling us about their great warranty, but no stores in New England.  So the next store was the same store Daniel purchased my engagement ring.  They had what I wanted and they have stores everywhere.  They also had another ring that was very beautiful.  I couldn't decide.  One was a simple aniversary band and the other was one of those 3 stone diamond rings with diamonds channel set in the band.    I loved them both.  I was joking with Daniel and said can't I just get them both?   I was seriously just joking and he was like sure why not!!!!!    Oh my.  So lots of bling for my aniversary.  I'm a horrible wife tho.  I still have not done anything for him.

I was planning to wrap up a gift I bought him in aluminum foil. (10 year aniversary is tin) &amp; bake him some cookies and put them in a cookie tin and a card of course.  I just never did it.  &amp; Now that I've written it down here he will see it and it won't be a surprise anymore.  Ugh...  I wanted to make the cookies from scratch and I just can't get motivated to do it.  Trying to pack, keep the house clean, etc. is driving me bonkers.  

We have 41 days till closing to finish packing.  I'm waiting for the appraisal to be done so I can really kick this packing into high gear.  Meanwhile our house is still at an active status and we are still getting showings!  Tomorrow is our 3rd showing since going under contract.  It's been stressful trying to keep the house show ready with 2 kids who like to make messes.  I've relaxed a bit since going under contract, but every time I get relaxed another showing pops up. 

I'm going to miss this house, but I am looking forward to what the future has in store for us.

This kids are going great.  Bailey's doing awesome in 1st grade.  She's so fresh, and bratty, and rude, and and and....   I am trying hard with her, but doesn't seem like I'm making any difference with her.  I wish I had some sort of instruction manual that what tell me what to do with her... At the same  time she can be really sweet and loving and a great big sister.   She has good days and bad.  Amazingly she ony exhibits this behaviour at home.  Her teachers have always bragged on how  polite and sweet she is and they never have any problems with her there.  I'm relieved, but wish she acted that way at home.

Jacob is surprising me every day with words he says.  He's getting quite the vocabulary.  He's mostly just a parrot tho and repeats a lot.  He worries me with what he eats or doesn't eat.  He almost always eats a good breakfast, but lunch he barely touches most days.  Supper same thing.  He loves bread.  I am trying not to worry, but I feel like he's always hungry.  I used to offer him something I know he would eat if he didn't eat anything. But I figured that was part of the problem.  Now if he doesn't eat then that's it. I don't offer anything else. He has to wait till the next meal time or snack time.  We only have 1 set snack time and that's 3 o'clock when Bailey gets home from school.   I would like to cut that out altogether, but I think Bailey would have a coronary &amp; not sure I want to deal with the fall out.  Sometimes around 10 o'clock Jacob will want something.  He'll go fuss at the counter  where the bananas are or at the refrigerator.  lol... I do give in.  I figure if the kid is at the point where he's asking for food then I will give him something.  

Wrapping this up now and making a mental note to come back and write more often.

"event","<br />It has been 10 weeks since my last entry.&nbsp; Time slips away so quickly these days.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm now trying to think back to the months of Aug. and Sept. to remember the highlights.<br /><br />Bailey tracked out the last week of July and 2 weeks at the beginning of Aug. &nbsp;It was a fun filled track out!&nbsp;O.M.G.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; I just remembered WE&nbsp;WENT&nbsp;ON&nbsp;A&nbsp;DISNEY&nbsp;CRUISE!!!!!!&nbsp; That was awesome!&nbsp; The first week of Bailey's vacation was spent frantically getting ready for our trip.&nbsp; Daniel again booked it so last minute. &nbsp;He booked it about a week in advance.&nbsp; There was the drama of the birth certificate/passports that had to be obtained.&nbsp; Daniel really wanted me to have a passport, but the more I looked into it I&nbsp;realized how ridicolous that was going to be to obtain.&nbsp; It probably would have cost $500 + dollars to get one that quick.&nbsp; I had a birth certificate, but it wasn't good enough for travel outside of the United States.&nbsp; I&nbsp;soon found out that the State of South Carolina issues a long form birth certificate acceptable for travel, but it can only be obtained in Columbia!?!&nbsp; I&nbsp;found a place to order it online for a reasonable fee.&nbsp; I ordered it on Monday around 10am.&nbsp; They gauranteed the bc in 3-5 days.&nbsp; We were leaving on Fri!!!&nbsp; So I was prepared to have to take a trip to Columbia to pick it up myself.&nbsp; Columbia is a 3.5 hr drive from here!&nbsp; Luckily, my birth certificate arrived in plenty of time on Wed. morning.&nbsp; That was faster than I had anticipated and I was so relieved!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had Bailey's birth certificate luckily.&nbsp; Jacob's we did not have however.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a fun filled adventure in downtown Raleigh to get that one.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;located the building where we needed to go but unfortunately there did not seem to be any parking nearby.&nbsp; I&nbsp;believe we walked 3 or 4 blocks from where we ended up parking.&nbsp; We get there &amp; the man asks what I'm there for.&nbsp; When I tell him a birth certificate he asks what County was the birth.&nbsp; I say, &quot;Wake&quot;.&nbsp; He proceeds to tell me I&nbsp;can get it much cheaper from the County.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;was at the building where they did birth certificates for the entire State.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ugh... I should have paid the money. &nbsp;It would have been worth it to not have to tromp around Raleigh with 2 kids.&nbsp; So we walked back the van. &nbsp;I wasn't exactly sure where we we were going. &nbsp;The man had handed me a map, but I wasn't sure why he was sending me to the Bank of America building.&nbsp; I went to the County Courthouse instead to be told I&nbsp;needed to go to the BOA building. LOL&nbsp; It was a close walk relatively speaking so we walked on over there.&nbsp; Got what we needed and headed home.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we got all our&nbsp; travel documents taken care of. &nbsp;We had to make sure we had the right clothes for cruising is an adventure and we are not used to having to dress up around here.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;have plenty of clothes I&nbsp;could wear, but I&nbsp;needed some shoes.&nbsp; Jacob had no pants whatsoever that fit him so I bought him a couple of pairs&nbsp;&amp; some collared shirts.&nbsp; Bailey was all set. &nbsp;She loves dresses and had plenty to choose from.<br /><br />On to the cruise!&nbsp;<br /><br />We drove down to FL Fri. night and stayed with Daniel's Dad in Deltona that night.&nbsp; Sat. we hung out with Grampa and just took it easy.&nbsp; Sun. we got&nbsp; up early and drove down/over to Port Canaveral, FL.&nbsp; The drive was uneventful, but&nbsp; seeing those gigantic cruise ships was SOMETHING&nbsp;ELSE. &nbsp;Wow.&nbsp; That was incredible.&nbsp; &nbsp;The check in process at the Disney Cruise was so easy.&nbsp; I'm trying to remember the particulars of the luggage.&nbsp; I think we just pulled up and unloaded it and someone took it away.&nbsp; We then went into the terminal checked in and waited for boarding. &nbsp;At check in photos were taken of the entire family for security and other purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; We registered Bailey for the Oceanear's Club. &nbsp;We were issued a beeper with that.&nbsp;&nbsp; We could drop her off there at any time and she could play and participate in the activities there.&nbsp; Whenever she wanted she could let them know she was ready to go and they would beep us.&nbsp; She went a few times and really seemed to enjoy it.&nbsp;I'm getting ahead of myself here.<br /><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So we board the ship Sun. around 11/12ish. &nbsp;I&nbsp;know we went right to lunch so it was about that time.&nbsp; We ate lunch at Beach Blanket Buffet.&nbsp; I&nbsp; sat down with Jacob while Daniel and Bailey went through the line.&nbsp; I had noticed some curdled milk on his shirt and wiped it up.&nbsp; We were eating lunch and I wasn't too impressed with the food.&nbsp; Jacob was fussy and I was almost done so I&nbsp;was holding him. &nbsp;He felt hot and didn't look like he felt good.&nbsp; All of the sudden he starts vomitting all over me!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; I&nbsp;was freaked out!&nbsp;I had read online that a mom was questioned abou the health of her kids and one had vomitted within 24 hrs of boarding the ship and she was not allowed on!&nbsp; Since we had not debarked or set sail or whatever the term is I&nbsp;was so afraid we would be asked to get off the boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I discreetly as possible left the restaurant and found a bathroom where I&nbsp;could change myself and Jacob. &nbsp;Luckily I had extra clothes with me because everything I&nbsp;read said to pack an extra change of clothes incase your luggage is not delivered in time for dinner.&nbsp; The Disney Cruise is pretty casual, but they ask passengers to wear no jeans or shorts to dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I changed the both of us into our dinner clothes.&nbsp; So our vacation really started off with a bang.&nbsp; After that tho he seemed fine.&nbsp; He was a bit feverish but it didn't last long.&nbsp; I'm not sure what was up with him, but he recovered quick.&nbsp; I&nbsp;believe he gets carsick.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems like he throws up a lot after being in the car.<br /><br />&nbsp;It's getting close to my bed time so I&nbsp;need to wrap this up. &nbsp;Hopefully I will remember to come back and post more about our trip.&nbsp; It was the best vacation I've ever had.&nbsp;</p>"

"event","I'm tired. &nbsp;Not sure why considering I&nbsp;was asleep on the couch last night from like 8:30pm and there were no children in my bed.&nbsp; I'm going to enjoy the heck out of this last hour before my busy time starts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully the kids won't bother me too much.&nbsp; Bailey's doing her homework and Jacob is probably up to no good.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;hear him pushing a plastic chair around on the floor.&nbsp; 

Yesterday I had a tooth pulled.&nbsp; I have been putting off having it pulled for years and years. &nbsp;It doesn't bother me at all or I should say didn't.&nbsp; It was a weird tooth that grew in when I was in my 20s and it was really crowding my other teeth &amp; food got stuck in between it and my other teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;So anyway, it was a long overdue appointment.&nbsp; &nbsp;Having the tooth pulled wasn't too bad, but the whole thing just sucks.&nbsp; Every time my tongue touches the area I wig out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;didn't eat anything yesterday after breakfast.&nbsp; Daniel brought me a milkshake home tho.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't eat anything today till about 2 o'clock.&nbsp;

Today,&nbsp;both kids had a dentist appointment.&nbsp; I am so thoroughly disappointed in how the whole thing went.&nbsp; I&nbsp; need to be writing to the dentist office to express my disappointment and frustration with the appointment.&nbsp; Too lazy to get up to get an email address from the business card I&nbsp;took from the office.&nbsp; We had a hygenist that really should NOT have been seeing patients.&nbsp; She was so obviously new and didn't have a handle on the computer system or how things go in the office or even where equipment was stored, how the xray light worked or anything. &nbsp;When we were done with Jacob's appointment she gave me the toothbrush she used on him in a plastic bag.&nbsp; Usually when&nbsp;&nbsp;Bailey has an appointment we get a new toothbrush, floss, tooth paste, flossers, and she gets to pick a prize.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bailey was disappointed she didn't get to help pick a prize for Jacob. &nbsp;Usually during the whole appointment the kids earn &quot;blue bucks&quot; and at the end they get to pick a prize.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl didn't have a good repore with the children at all.&nbsp; 

Before we had even gotten started with Jacob they came to get Bailey. &nbsp;She didn't want to go without me and I didn't blame her! I was mad.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;said that she wouldn't go without me. &nbsp;I&nbsp;had no idea the appointments were set up like this and had I&nbsp;known I wouldn't have scheduled it this way.&nbsp; So they had to wait for Jacob's appointment to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;A hygenist came to take Bailey, but she wouldn't go. &nbsp;Then the doctor came and tried to get her.&nbsp;&nbsp;I said no.&nbsp; I do not know what the hell they were thinking, honestly.&nbsp; 

Jacob's teeth are fine and they saw no problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;So we go back to the room where they do the teeth yanking.&nbsp; Bailey's very nervous and the hygenist does nothing really to make her feel happy or excited about being there.&nbsp; The other&nbsp; hygenists are so good with the kids, but this one has no personality whatsoever.&nbsp;&nbsp; She's really upset and they start talking to her about her Barbie doll and that seems to take the edge off and the laughing gas starts to work. &nbsp;The doctor initiates this conversation and the hygenist gets in on it, and I&nbsp;join in as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally is calm and the dentist gives her a shot to &quot;make her gums go to sleep&quot;.&nbsp; She has some pain with that.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dentist checks the xray and his notes before he yanks the tooth.&nbsp; It was pretty quick.&nbsp; She didn't cry at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were asked if we wanted to keep the tooth and we said yes.&nbsp; 

As we're waiting for the paperwork to check out Bailey reminds me that we don't have the tooth.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the hygenist for the tooth. &nbsp;She goes back to get it. &nbsp;She reappears and says, &quot;someone already threw the tooth out.&nbsp; I'm sorry.&quot; &nbsp;WTF?&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so mad. But I&nbsp;didn't want to upset Bailey. &nbsp;I really wanted to give someone a piece of my mind, but it wasn't the time for that with two kids with me.&nbsp; Bailey got to pick a prize.&nbsp; The hygenist just tells her she has 25 bucks to spend.&nbsp; Really? $25?&nbsp; She should have been able to pick anything from the prize wall that she wanted for having&nbsp;a tooth pulled.&nbsp; She ended up with a plastic jelly bracelet with beads on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp; know it really doesn't matter to me and Bailey didn't notice anything amiss, but the appointments just didn't go the way I&nbsp;expected so this was just icing on the cake.&nbsp; She didn't need any of the junk, but it's a part of the appt.&nbsp; &nbsp;Her last appointment was so much better with lots of smiling and laughing and she was excited and happy to be there.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know it's a tooth being pulled, but it could have gone so much better.&nbsp; 

We had to wait around quite awhile at the end for the paperwork to check out because the hygenist didn't know what she was doing. I thought my arm was going to break off holding Jacob.&nbsp; I finally brought them to the play area because it was taking so long.&nbsp;

&nbsp;So that's that.&nbsp; 

Fri. night we came home from dinner and we had no electricity.&nbsp; All the breakers had flipped.&nbsp; All of them came back 'cept 3.&nbsp; We had no electricity in the bedrooms, a bathroom, and the laundry room.&nbsp; The garage door was acting funky &amp; Daniel's computer seemed to be toasted.&nbsp; The TVs weren't working.&nbsp; Turns out a tree in our yard was hit by lightning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel thinks his computer will be okay with a new motherboard, video card, and the TV card, but how can you be sure?&nbsp; Luckily he was able to save everything off the harddrives. &nbsp;He's hoping to have someone look at his computer and have the insurance replace the whole thing. &nbsp;I mean if lightning destroyed all that the rest of it could be on it's last leg.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wouldn't trust it to last.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, luckily for him there are gaurantees on the motherboard and video card.&nbsp; His&nbsp; printer is also not working and we have someone coming out tomorrow to fix it under warranty.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had an electrician here yesterday to fix the 3 breakers. &nbsp;The A/C dudes were here to fix the air conditioner yesterday too.&nbsp; Then the dudes that installed our tvs came to check out the equipment.&nbsp; 3 of our plasma tvs are not working right.&nbsp; The downstairs tv clicks when it's turned off.&nbsp; It's very bizarre.&nbsp; &nbsp;The TV in our bedroom has a green line that goes down the side of it when it's on. &nbsp;The TV in the theatre room doesn't seem to work at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sat. Daniel took the cable boxes and the cable modem to the cable company to get replacements.&nbsp; Today we had the garage door fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So getting the computers replaced&nbsp;&amp; the tree taken out are the last things we'll have to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of our laptops seems to be toasted also.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a receiver and a few dvd players that were taken out as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; There might be something I'm missing.&nbsp; We have a lot of electronic crap."

I'm still loosing weight.&nbsp; I&nbsp;did have a gain one week, but ever since I've been consistently down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my last two weigh ins were down 1.5 &amp; 0.9 lbs.&nbsp; One good week and one okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget how much I&nbsp;gained in the weigh where I was up. &nbsp;It was less than a lb tho.&nbsp;

I become anxious about having to go to the bathroom and it just makes it all worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would go and then lay down and almost immediately the cramping would start over again and I would be up again less than 5 mins later.&nbsp;&nbsp; This went on several times before my body was done and let me sleep.&nbsp; I think I got maybe 3 hours of sleep.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't feel too bad right now.&nbsp; I went for my nightly walk for the first time in 4 days.&nbsp; Because Dr. Google has told me so many scary things about what's going on with me I'm kinda freaked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;need to make an appt. &amp; see my doctor for a checkup.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"event","This is my 3rd attempt to post an entry tonight.  I should click on that ""save as draft button"", but no.  I have disabled the touch pad and hooked up my mouse.  

I've been in a funk lately.  Staying home alot does it to me.  I need to think of some things we can do in the mornings after we drop Bailey at school.  I usually come home and eat breakfast & sit at the computer for a bit checking email, Facebook, etc.  Then we straighten up and clean up the breakfast dishes, go upstairs & put away or start some laundry, play in the playroom, then it's nap time.  I fold laundry, watch some tv, or sometimes even nap.  I do this very rarely, but rocking Jacob in a dark bedroom practically puts me to sleep.  Sometimes I give in.  Most of the time I sit and think about all the things I want to do while he's sleeping.  

Thinking of things we can do in the A.M..... 

<ul>
<li>go to the park before it gets hot</li>
<li>go to the mall and play in play area and run around mall before stores open</li>
<li>go for breakfast at Mcdonalds/ChickFilA and let Jacob play in the play areas</li>
<li>go grocery shopping</li>
<li>go to Walmart/Target</li>
<li>go for walk</li>
<li>go to library</li>
</ul>


 Hmm.. not sure what time the mall opens their doors, but I should find out.  I need to do something 'cuz the funk I get in during the week is just depressing.  I put go to library on the list, but I don't think that opens till 9 or 10.  I'll have to check on that too.

Enough of that... On to weigh in news! 

I was down 3.7 lbs on Friday! I'm down 32.2 lbs total.  17.6 lbs to go till I reach goal #1. 

Last Sunday I went shopping.  I went out with the intention of buying socks for Jacob.  I swear it's friggin' ridicolous trying to find decent socks.  I want some boy socks.  I don't want bobby socks for my son! Really.  Maybe I'm crazy, but the fold over socks are just weird to me for boys.  Anyway is it too much to ask to find some thin socks with rubber on the bottom and the size?  Friggin' socks.  Anyway, I didn't find what I was looking for at Old Navy.  I did get Bailey some capris and a few shirts.  She loves capris and her current ones are getting very old and ragged and holey and too little.  She has one pair of capris she wears a lot with a hole in them! She's had them since we lived in MA!!! LOL.   It's hard to believe she's wearing the same pants she had when she was 2.  

Anyway, I went down the strip mall to another store looking at clothes for myself.  I picked up a few things and took them to the dressing room.  I had to get smaller sizes than I had anticpated.  I tried on a really nice black sundress, but I was afraid it would get too big too fast and they didn't have a smaller size to try.  It was $50 too so I passed.  I got 1 outfit of a jean skirt and tshirt.  My skirt was $15 and the shirt was $10.  I don't want to spend alot and just wanted something different to wear.  It's not that different considering I wear tshirts and jean shorts almost everyday. LOL   It felt so good tho to have to get smaller sizes.  

Sun. or Sat. my brother called (last week).  He's going to bring my niece up for a visit on the 27th.   She'll stay with us about a week and then my Mom will come to visit and take her home.  She's 12.  So big and so grown up now.  Bailey will be out of school for a bit on the 30th.  We'll have to think of some fun things to do with her."

"event","Most of the week has been pretty uneventful. &nbsp;Rinse, Wash, Repeat.&nbsp; We get up at 7am and I change a diaper or not, then get the kids breakfast, pack a lunch or not, and make sure the kids are dressed.&nbsp; 7:50ish to 8 o'clock we hop out the door to get Bailey to school.&nbsp; Then we come home and I have breakfast &amp; Jacob begs for my food, or not.&nbsp; We hang out downstairs till Daddy leaves for work. &nbsp;Some days Jacob is so overcome with grief at Daddy leaving we follow him out the door to wave goodbye.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob enjoys sitting in the driver's seat for a minute.&nbsp; Then we wave goodbye.&nbsp; Then we clean up the breakfast dishes and goof off or start some laundry or whatnot.&nbsp; Nap time comes around 11am or so sometimes sooner.&nbsp; Then while Jacob naps I try to get some things done around the house. &nbsp;I clean up whatever disasters Jacob has made and try to straighten up the house a bit.&nbsp; Some days I even have time to take a shower and eat lunch afterwards. &nbsp;It depends on how long he sleeps.&nbsp; Fri. he woke up about 2 o'clock and we ate lunch and then go Bailey from school.&nbsp; 

After we picked her up, We went to Great Cuts!&nbsp;&nbsp; LOL...&nbsp;&nbsp; Me at Great Cuts, imagine that?&nbsp; I would never in a million years go there for my hair, but for Jacob I figured what did it matter. &nbsp;He's a boy and a baby at that.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was imagining a little bang trim and a little trim around the ears and a trim in the back. &nbsp;Boy that lady really cut his hair like crazy.&nbsp; I was imagining I wouldn't get $10 worth of cutting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was excellent!&nbsp; He didn't make a peep. &nbsp;He sat in the chair and sat relatively still.&nbsp; He would have fallen flat on his face if he had moved much tho.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was such a good boy. &nbsp;He just sat there sucking on his binkie while she cut his hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looks very cute.&nbsp; I'll have to take some pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't his first haircut tho.&nbsp; Grandma of course got those honors.&nbsp; I wasn't sure when we would see her again and his was looking pretty scraggily.&nbsp; The lady even used the buzzer thing on him.&nbsp; I couldn't believe how good he was and neither could the ladies in the shop either.&nbsp; 

On to weigh in news!

This week I was down 2.2 lbs!!!!!!! Total lost 28.5 lbs! &nbsp;Yay!&nbsp; I was getting a bit discouraged the past two weeks, but we're back on track!&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","The kids are watching Bindi the Jungle Girl on Discovery Kids.&nbsp; Bailey more so than Jacob. &nbsp;Jacob is currently trying to stand up on a plastic kid chair. &nbsp;Mommy said, &quot;No, Jacob&quot; &amp; now he's pushing it around.&nbsp; Good boy, I guess.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't really like things pushed around on my hardwood floors, but&nbsp;it&nbsp;is preferable to standing on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bailey has finished her breakfast and is now cleaning the table.&nbsp; I only asked her to wipe up the syrup she spilled on the table, but she's decided to clean the whole dang thing.&nbsp; Good Girl!&nbsp;:)&nbsp; 

Bailey seems to be doing really well in school.&nbsp; A couple of weeks ago she had a note sent home saying how well she did on her latest math assessment.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was so proud and happy.&nbsp; Kindergarten is nearing the end.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuesday 6/16 We have &quot;Meet the Teacher&quot; for first grade!&nbsp; Her last day of K is 6/30.&nbsp;Then she has a few days off and starts 1st grade on 7/7.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm anxious to find out who her teacher will be.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have heard there is only going to be 1 teacher on Track 3 1st grade this coming school year.&nbsp; Currently there are 2 teachers, but due to budget cuts there will only be 1 class.&nbsp; I'm hoping her teacher will be Mrs. Sessoms.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have heard the other teacher is harder on the kids because she used to teach 6th grade and expects alot more out of her students.&nbsp; One Mom said that her daughter would do well no matter the teacher, but she's tough.&nbsp; She said she wouldn't want her this teacher for her son who is slower to pick up on things.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Bailey just took a jug of syrup from her brother. LOL)&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I'm hoping it's Mrs. Sessoms because I&nbsp;feel she would be a better fit with Bailey.&nbsp; 

Jacob is into anything and everything.&nbsp; We had our first ER trip with him this past Sunday.&nbsp; We do not have the upstairs gated at all.&nbsp; He's never gone near the stairs at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; He walks right past them and doesn't usually try to hang out near the stairs or go down them.&nbsp; Well Sunday we were in Bailey's room and I wanted to change the sheets on her bed.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was going to my closet to get them and had called Jacob to come with me.&nbsp; I didn't even get to my room when I heard him falling.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the worst sound I've ever heard.&nbsp; I&nbsp;ran but there was nothing I&nbsp;could do. &nbsp;By the time I got there it was all over and Daddy had picked him up.&nbsp; Oh my baby.&nbsp; He was crying and crying.&nbsp;&nbsp; After we got him calmed down I saw a big bump on his forehead. &nbsp;Daniel felt we should take him in to get checked out.&nbsp; I got Bailey out of the bath tub and she got dressed. &nbsp;I called his doctor to see where she wanted us to go, but had to leave a message.&nbsp;&nbsp; The urgent care his doctor sends patients to after hours was already closed.&nbsp; So we headed to the closest hospital where he was born.&nbsp;&nbsp; We waited forever.&nbsp; The doctor who examined him was very good with him and found nothing wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;He just had a bad bump on the head thankfully.&nbsp;

"event","Wow it's been 3 weeks since I last posted.&nbsp; Over that time we've all had some manner of cold or something making us feel yucky.&nbsp; I think the worst of it has passed.&nbsp; Nothing too terrible, but just enough to make me feel like crap. 

So let's catch up on the weigh ins:

5/22 - down 2.2 lbs
5/29 - down 0.4 lbs
6/5 - down 0.7 lbs

Total lost: 26.3 lbs

I attribute the cold for the past two weeks and the less than steller weight loss.&nbsp; I'm trying to focus on it being a loss.&nbsp; A loss is a loss is a loss.&nbsp; It's on the right path, but just meandering along.

I have been very slack with my water drinking.. speaking of which I need to get a glass. brb.&nbsp;&nbsp; So yesterday I drank a zillion glasses of water. &nbsp;I think it was like 60oz, maybe more.&nbsp; So just out of curiousity I got back on the Wii this morning and weighed myself.&nbsp; I was down 1.1 lbs! Yes! &nbsp;So&nbsp;I must continue with the water drinking.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also very delighted to see I went from &quot;Obese&quot; to just &quot;overweight&quot; WOOHOO!&nbsp;LOL&nbsp; I have 23.5 lbs to go to reach my first goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I've mentioned before that was the weight I was before I got pregnant with Bailey. &nbsp;It was still not the ideal weight for my height, but I was happy with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I'm not sure how to sequeway into the next thing that has been on my mind lately...&nbsp; I'm disappointed with the lack of family around. &nbsp;We moved here to be closer to family, but yet we hardly ever see them.&nbsp; My Mom will come visit for the day but won't even stay over night with us much less a week.&nbsp; It would be really nice to have a Grandma that's more involved and hands on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel and I have been out alone just once this entire year.&nbsp; We could get a babysitter yes, but we don't.&nbsp; It would be nice to have a Grandma that would come and give us a break. &nbsp;Someone that could help out.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know the distance is an obstacle, but come on we used to be 12 hrs away and now we're only 2.5 hrs.&nbsp;&nbsp; My brother here I see him about once a year at Christmas and he's 20 mins away.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's very busy with his family and their school and sports activities.&nbsp; We have called on him exactly twice to do us a favor. &nbsp;They were so great to take Bailey for us when I had to go into the hospital with Jacob.&nbsp; I don't know what we would have done without them.&nbsp; I am so grateful they were able and willing to help.&nbsp; I&nbsp;love them so much.&nbsp;They are great people and if we ever needed anything important I&nbsp;know they would be here for us.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just disappointing. &nbsp;I so wanted my children to know my family to play with their cousins and have close relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; The relationships are certainly better than they were with us being in Massachusetts, but not exactly what I&nbsp;had in mind.&nbsp; 

Daniel is not happy with the way his job is going.&nbsp; He's of course extremely fortunate to have found something so quickly after finding out about being laid off. &nbsp;We're grateful for any job and especially one that seemed to be a good fit financially.&nbsp; He knows how disappointed I am that we don't see anymore of my family than we do.&nbsp; I've been joking around with him about moving back to MA.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp;miss having family around that is involved and cares and wants to see us.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I really love it here.&nbsp; I love the weather, I love the area, our house, the neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;I love that we can go outside and play pretty much year round, the beautiful parks, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love that Bailey has lots of friends to play with.&nbsp; The grass is always greener...&nbsp; 

Daniel applied for a job in Worcester.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows what will come of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had to sell our house now we would probably lose 20K or more because of the falling house prices and the terrible economy.&nbsp; That is if we could sell it at all.&nbsp; This area hasn't been as deeply impacted by the economic downturn as others, but it's not what it was.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't see us really going anymore anytime soon.&nbsp; I have mixed feelings about it all.&nbsp; 

Bailey seems to be enjoying school much more now that her days are shorter.&nbsp; We got a note sent home last week that she did really well on her math assessment.&nbsp; I was so happy to hear that. &nbsp;She has been having such a hard time in math.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

So, that's what's been on my mind lately."

"event","Sunday we went down to SC to see my Mom for Mother's Day.  I was totally bummed I forgot to bring her present.  We had a nice visit.  Mom made yummy food.  I got a haircut! Woot! Jacob was not acting  like himself.  I thought he was just  overwhelmed with all the people he didn't really know.  Sunday night tho when we got home we took Jacob's temperture and it was slightly elevated.  I gave him some Motrin.   I took him to the doctor on Monday.  Just before we went I took his temp and it was 103.7.  He was so pitiful.  Poor dude.  He has made a full recovery tho and is  back to his old self.  By Wed. he was fever free, thankfully.

Bailey went back to school on Wed.  She only has 1 more week of 21st  Century left.  I am so happy.   Going to school from 8am till almost 5pm is just too long of a day.   She hates going to school because of it!  That's not what we want.   I'm so so glad it's almost over.  Kindergarten will be over on 6/30.  She'll have a week off and then start 1st Grade on 7/7.  

And now to weigh in.... 

I'm down 2.4 lbs this week! Down 23 lbs total.  26 lbs more to go till I reach my first goal."

"event","Aunt Pat & Uncle John arrived a week ago today.   I'm so tired! We were BUSY!  

Sat.

They arrived and we hung out Sat. morning until lunch when we headed out to eat at Boston Market.  Daniel went to BEST BUY.  Woo.  LOL   We took them by the grocery store to pick up some things for making cookies and breakfast, etc.  

Daniel took advantage of having people we love and trust babysit the kids.  We left them awake! We actually went out to dinner & a movie.  Imagine that! That was nice.  We ate at Outback and went to see Sunshine Cleaning.  It was a nice evening.  Wish we had more opportunties to do stuff  like that.  Daniel talked to me alot about work and what's going on there.  At Best Buy (we were killing time before the movie started after dinner) he even showed an interest in things I was looking at.  I was shocked at that.

Sun.

We went to the Zoo about 2 hrs away.  We walked about 5 miles around that zoo.  Everyone was way tired after that.

Mon. 

A day of rest.  While Jacob took his nap, Aunt Pat & I snuck out to the grocery store to do the shopping.  I was able to leave Jacob here with Uncle John and Bailey.   Then we headed out to eat at RED ROBIN for lunch. 

Afterwards I left the kids to go get my eyes examined and pick out new glasses.  That wasn't cheap & took FOREVER!

Aunt Pat cooked her delicious sphaghetti & meatballs for us that night.  I made a salad.

Tuesday

My plans for this day fell through because it rained.  We ended up at the mall.  Bailey had allowance money saved and wanted to spend it along with her coupon at Build A Bear!   She got a new dog and a new outfit.    That was cool and fine by me since she spent her own money.  

Then we hit up the icecream stand.   I ordered a kiddie size, but prolly shouldn't have had any at all.   

Then we were at Justice for Girls and I wanted to get Bailey a new bathing suit.  They had SO many TANKINI's to choose from.  They were all cute.  Aunt Pat bought the suit and I bought the matching flipflops.  Then Aunt Pat had to get something for Jacob.  We ended up at Gymboree and she bought him a bathing suit and a shirt.  She's too much!!  She's awesome.  I was thrilled she bought them something I would have needed to get them anyway.  That was really really nice.  

I made a ham, mashed potatoes, green beans and rolls for supper.


Wednesday

We went to Pullen Park in Raleigh.  I bought tickets for everyone to ride the train, and the merry go round and for the kids to ride the kiddie boats.  Jacob looooooved the merry go round.  He was laughing and everything.  Just as we were getting off the train the downpour started.  We waited till the rain was letting up and made a run for the van.  The rain had practically stopped by the time we got there.  We were soaked & headed home.  

That night I packed for our surprise trip to Virginia & loaded the car up.  Bailey suspected NOTHING! 


Thursday & Fri.

After breakfast we headed out towards Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA.  Uncle John thought it would be cool to take a Ferry over the James River.   So we did and boy oh boy was that some kind of adventure.  We got off the interestate onto some country roads.  They were one step above dirt.  They were twisty, narrow and deserted.  There were some houses here & there. The ferry ride was cool.  I wish I had thought to take Jacob out of his car seat for a few minutes.  I didn't realize the passing was 15 mins long.  I think I knew, but I was just a bit nervous about it.  

After we crossed the river we were very close to our hotel.  We checked in and went swimming right away.  Bailey was so thrilled.  The next morning we headed to Busch Gardens. 

About the Busch Gardens trip... I thought the place was cool.  I looked at the map, but wasn't really paying attention to it.  I was pretty much just going wherever and letting Bailey do whatever and just enjoy herself.  I didn't have any type of agenda.  But in hindsight we didn't see much at all of the park. Well I guess we did hit the main kiddie areas and cover most of that, but we missed seeing a lot.  

I thought it was really nice.  The food was even good!  It was terribly expensive, but at least it was good.  Usually theme park food is crap and costs a lot.  But this was really yummy.   

I think I would rather go to Busch Gardens than ever step foot into Disney World again.  I mean really!  I love Disney, but I do not want to deal with that heat or those crowds.   Disney is just too much really.  I think if we ever do Disney again I'd like to just spend 1 week at 1 park.  I have no use for MGM or Disney Studios or Animal Kingdom or Epcot.  

We headed out of the park around 5ish pm and didn't actually make it on the highway till about 6pm.  We  stopped about 7:30pm for supper and then got back home around 11pm last night.


Sat

Today we ate lunch at Chick Fil A.  Daniel had to run an errand to Home Depot and then we all went to the mall so I could pick up my glasses.  Then after that we drove around and eventually ended up at the airport where we dropped them off to catch their plane home.

 I'm so tired.  I need to go to bed right now.  Tomorrow we head to SC to visit with my Mom for mother's day! woo. 

Goodnight.

Oh, no weigh in this week.  I'm taking a vacation from it.  I will be back to normal starting Monday with walking and eating and everything.  I will weigh in on Fri. 5/15"

I'm worried about this coming week.&nbsp; We have company coming &amp; we will be eating out a lot.&nbsp; I'm going to try to be good and not worry too much about it.&nbsp; Not sure if I will be able to get my exercise in or not, but I&nbsp;will try.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to treat this like a vacation week and as long as I don't gain, I'll be happy.&nbsp; 

Since we're having company I have focused this week on cleaning the house.&nbsp; I actually got a good start on it the week before Bailey tracked out on vacation esp. upstairs.&nbsp; I swept, swiffered, and mopped the kitchen, family room, foyer, dining room and back hallway yesterday.&nbsp; I have never done the whole downstairs in one day.&nbsp; It was an adventure.&nbsp; I got a good start before Jacob got up from his nap.&nbsp; I&nbsp;put him in his highchair while I finished up.&nbsp; Then the family room he was loose!&nbsp; He was walking all over and sliding.&nbsp; I would map and then go behind myself with a towel to dry.&nbsp; The foyer, dining room and back hall I put him back in his highchair.&nbsp; Poor kid!&nbsp; Oh well. &nbsp;It's done.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only room in the house I&nbsp;haven't gotten to is our master bathroom.&nbsp; It's not bad at all, but I would like to scrub the shower, toilet and clean the floors.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't feel compelled to get right on that for some reason. &nbsp;LOL&nbsp; 

It's Friday &amp; the kids have been through enough torturous cleaning this week. &nbsp;We're going out for lunch.&nbsp; I have no idea where we're going at this moment, but I just know we need to get out of the house for awhile."

I might really like a Y membership, but I don't have one.  I've lost 19lbs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even tho I don't have all those things.  What do I have?  A treadmill & a nice neighborhood for walking.  Oh and I haven't bought any crazy diet foods or pills or shakes.  Exercise and watching what I eat.  Oh, I do have Wii FIT!! Although I haven't been using that as of late.  It got me started tho.   

Today's weigh in brought me a 4lb loss!  Wow.   It's too fast.  I know, but I haven't been starving myself or anything.  I eat 3 meals a day and even have a snack.  We eat out too.  I'm not eating salads or every meal either.  

I been using the dailyplate.com to log the food I eat so I can see how many calories I'm eating.    It tells me how many calories I can eat to lose 2 lbs per week.  It gives you credit for exercise. 
I walk every morning or night around my neighborhood.  I drove my route today and discovered it's 2.2 miles.  If the weather is not good I use the treadmill or take a break.  I was doing Couch to 5K, but as the workout progressed all I could think was ""I HATE running.""   The run/walk workout was cool, but I just cannot see myself running for 15 or 30 mins at a time.    So I'm going to walk.  I love walking in my neighborhood.  I take the dog with me most of the time.  I love seeing my neighbor's flowers and beautiful yards.  I love being outside and feeling the air.  I also enjoy listening to music on my IPOD. Although soon it's going to be stifling hot.  Not sure how much I'm going to love that.  I'm hoping I'll get through the hot weather without skipping a beat by walking early in the morning or at night."

"event","<p>See I'm not so sure if I'm going about this all right.&nbsp; Since I started on 3/1 with this new watching what I eat and exercising thing I was weighing in on Friday via Wii Fit.&nbsp; I like that it keeps track of your weight without me having to find a pen and paper to do it myself.&nbsp; Plus it won't get lost.&nbsp; Anyway, I think I&nbsp;need to start keeping track of it the old fashioned way as well.&nbsp; Wii Fit says I'm down 2.7lbs from last week.&nbsp; 15lbs total.&nbsp; Go me!! :)&nbsp; It's no question I've lost weight. &nbsp;Wii Fit is accurate, but I weigh in fully clothed with shoes on.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am sure to wear the same clothes or same type - shorts, tshirt, sneakers so that isn't a factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;You tell the game how heavy your clothes are and it deducts 4lbs for heavy which I choose every time because I'm wearing shoes.&nbsp; So... I am not exactly sure how much my clothes weigh so there is probably some inaccuracy there.&nbsp; I think I will also start recording my weight on the regular scale as well so I&nbsp;can see the difference.&nbsp; Which means I&nbsp;need to run upstairs and get naked before I eat breakfast. LOL&nbsp; See why I haven't done this in the past?&nbsp; <br /><br />So I'm excited that I'm down 15lbs!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Go me.&nbsp; I've never been skinny, but I'm not happy with how heavy I have become.&nbsp; I&nbsp;gained 50lbs when I got pregnant with Bailey and it never fully came off.&nbsp; Thankfully, I&nbsp;only gained like 15lbs with Jacob and I was back to my prepregnancy weight shortly after delivery.&nbsp; But somehow in the year since he was born I put on 12lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal is to be about the size I was before I got pregnant with Bailey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I get there I'll decide where to go next.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;was happy with my size before I got pregnant with Bailey so we'll see.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bailey tracks out for 3 weeks 2 days today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel says if I want to go to Massachusetts to visit it's okay with him.&nbsp; I just dread dread dread that drive and not only that but being the primary care giver 24-7 for both of my kids without help.&nbsp; Yes, I know there will be plenty of family around to help, but ultimately they are my responsibility and mine alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's Mama that has to get the kids their baths and down for the night.&nbsp; Jacob is not an easy child.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bed time in a strange place without his crib is scary to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The alternative tho is to stay home with a bored child who will drive me absolutely up a wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a doctor's appointment on Monday so I can't go anywhere before then.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;need to talk to Aunt Pat and see what she thinks about us staying with her.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>"

Daniel's Aunt Terry passed away yesterday.&nbsp; She was a really nice lady.&nbsp; We had a nice talk last night about her before we went to bed.&nbsp; He's planning to fly up to MA so he can attend the wake/funeral. &nbsp;I wish we could all go, but it's too expensive and would mean Bailey would have to miss 2 days of school.&nbsp;&nbsp; She visited our house here in NC once when she came to go to a wedding of a friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also gave them a little tour of RTP, Durham, and Raleigh.&nbsp; Daniel took them to Frankie's Fun Park and tried to get her Aunt into the gocarts, but she wasn't having any of it.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; We saw her briefly when we visited MA last summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;She worked at the hospital where Bailey was born. &nbsp;We caught her for a min when she was coming back from lunch and then we visited her for a few minutes in her office.&nbsp; She gave both Bailey &amp;&nbsp;Jacob little gifts.&nbsp;&nbsp; She showed up for work one day last week and was complaining of something.&nbsp; Her coworkers told her to go get checked out.&nbsp; A week later she's dead. &nbsp;So sad.&nbsp; 

Yesterday was my official weigh in day and I'm down .2 lbs this week.&nbsp; :(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm trying to focus positively and realize that a loss is better than nothing and that the good thing is I haven't gained.&nbsp; Then today I weigh in and I'm down like 1.3lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weight flucutations kill me how that happens. LOL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Week 4 of Couch to 5K&nbsp;is KILLING&nbsp;ME.&nbsp; It's pretty tough. &nbsp;I think I'm sticking with week 4 for awhile.&nbsp; I will try to challenge myself with faster walking / running speeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am so not ready to run for 15 mins at a time which is what's coming up, I think.&nbsp; 

Today my Mom is coming to visit.&nbsp; We're going out to lunch and celebrate my birthday with her.&nbsp; I am not sure if she's staying overnight or not. &nbsp;I get the impression she's just here for the day.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; Now I&nbsp;must get my sweaty stinky self in the shower."

"event","&nbsp;So I've been exercising regularly. &nbsp;I started Sunday two weeks ago with 20 mins of Wii Fit.&nbsp; Then after talking to a Mommy friend I&nbsp;decided to add Couch to 5K&nbsp;to my routine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've lost 4.7 lbs since 3/1 and&nbsp;this week I&nbsp;lost 2.9 lbs.&nbsp; Although my dear husband was so nice to point out that Wii Fit was only a game.&nbsp; So I guess I haven't really lost anything and that all my hard work is for naught.&nbsp; After I drop Bailey at school, I&nbsp;come home and do 30 mins of Wii Fit.&nbsp; I usually do the aerobics exercises - 10 mins of the Free Run, 10 mins of the Free Step, Super Hula Hoops&nbsp;&amp; the Short run.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate running in place. &nbsp;It really sucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob doesn't really like any of this.&nbsp; He is content for like the first 10 mins.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm stepping he tries to get on the board and I&nbsp;have to step around his little fingers.&nbsp; When I'm doing the Yoga he legs to hang on my legs.&nbsp; At some point I throw him in the pack n play which he hates.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

After my 30 mins it's time for breakfast.&nbsp; I&nbsp;feed Jacob and get some cereal for myself &amp; then get Jacob down for his nap around 10am.&nbsp; After he's down I grab my IPOD and head to the garage.&nbsp; I'm on Week 2 of the Couch to 5k.&nbsp; I start out with a brisk walk at 3mph for 5 mins.&nbsp; Then I start running at 4mph for 1 min. 30 seconds.&nbsp; Then Walk at 3mph for 2 mins.&nbsp; And that goes on for 20 mins.&nbsp; Run/Walk/Run/Walk/Run/Walk.&nbsp; After 20 mins I&nbsp;slow down to 3mph for a 5 minute cool down for a total of 30mins.&nbsp; The past two days I've gone about 1.65 miles.&nbsp; 

I'm really enjoying it too.&nbsp; I feel so much better.&nbsp; I've also been going to bed much earlier.&nbsp; I'm usually in bed no later than 11:30pm these days.&nbsp; I have my lovely husband to thank for the new bedtime.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he has been invaded by body snatchers because he has never ever in our whole 9 years of marriage ever gone to bed this early. &nbsp;It started when he was sick and has continued. &nbsp;He has a couple of late nights here &amp;&nbsp;there, but he's pretty consistently in bed by midnight these days.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's really weird.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;think it helps that he has a new job and they want him in the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;His coworkers show up later, but they also work later. &nbsp;He is up and out early and home a little before supper time.

I'm really loving his new job. &nbsp;I enjoy having him out of the house for a change.&nbsp; Although I do miss having him around. &nbsp;I'm trying to decide what to do with Jacob when I go to the dentist.&nbsp; I guess I'll have to drag him along.&nbsp; I'm not sure how well that will go over.&nbsp; I guess I'll have ask when I call to schedule the appt. if it's okay.&nbsp; Any other doctor I&nbsp;bring him along no problem, but dentists rooms are so small and confining when&nbsp; you're in a chair with someone's hands in your mouth.&nbsp; 

I know Daniel hates commuting to work&nbsp; and thinks it's a waste of time, but I think this is better for our family. &nbsp;When he's home he's here for us and the children.&nbsp; Having him work from home was kind of a tease in some ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's here but working so he's not ours.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he also was here to see every step of Jacob's firsts. &nbsp;Now he can only see them when he gets home.&nbsp; But I'm loving him being here and not working at 5:30pm or so.&nbsp; Also he never goes back to work after dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","It&nbsp; started off really badly, but it turned into a glorious day. 

Daniel wakes me up saying, &quot;It's 7:30.&quot; &nbsp;WHAT???&nbsp; We get up at 7am.&nbsp; My stupid friggin' cell phone alarm didn't go off.&nbsp; The phone's time didn't automatically update. &nbsp;WTF???&nbsp;&nbsp; Bailey was very good about it.&nbsp; She was up and got dressed pretty quick without any compliant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacob was still sleeping also.&nbsp; I woke him up. Bailey ate her breakfast and I&nbsp;packed her lunch and out the door we went.&nbsp; We were on time and not late!&nbsp; 

So I&nbsp;come back home and I'm about to start doing my&nbsp;Wii Fit stuff &amp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;was making sure the doors were closed to keep Jacob out of the bathroom, pantry, etc.&nbsp; so he couldn't get into trouble while I&nbsp;was exercising and he walks/cruises over to me and he smells.&nbsp; Time for a diaper change.&nbsp; Eww it's all over his leg. &nbsp;I&nbsp;carry him at arms length up the stairs.&nbsp; It's very nasty.&nbsp; I change him and clean him up as best as I&nbsp;can.&nbsp; So he's all cleaned up and downstairs we come and I notice there is poop on the floor and in the cabinet he plays in.&nbsp; GROSS!!&nbsp;I&nbsp;cleaned that up.&nbsp; Then finally got the 30 mins of Wii Fit in.

&nbsp;Then we had breakfast.

Nap time for Jacob.&nbsp; He went down fairly easy.&nbsp; He always is so tired by 10am he goes down real easy, but we were running behind today.&nbsp; I come downstairs at 10:30am after putting him down.

Then it's time for Couch to 5K.&nbsp; I'm started Week 2 today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's 30 mins. &nbsp;Then I&nbsp;go upstairs &amp; take a shower.&nbsp; I'm so hot. &nbsp;The weather is so warm and I practically take a cold shower.&nbsp; 

After I get dressed I&nbsp;straighten up my room and the bathroom and head downstairs.&nbsp; Clean up the kitchen as I hear Jacob waking up.&nbsp; Lunch time!&nbsp;&nbsp; We eat.&nbsp; Jacob likes the Gerber Ravioli things and he had some applesauce to go with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Then upstairs to clean up &amp; go grocery shopping.

Jacob likes to scream.&nbsp; I do not like that .&nbsp; He was mostly good during our trip, but he screamed occasionally.

Jacob plays while I put away the groceries.&nbsp; 

Then I sit down and look for some sandals online while Jacob plays.&nbsp; He walks like 5 steps and surprises me.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;Then it's naptime.&nbsp; During naptime I sweep the kitchen floor.&nbsp; Then as I'm headed upstairs to fold laundry the door bell rings.&nbsp; It's one of Bailey's friend's wanting to play.&nbsp; She's not home&nbsp; yet I tell her. &nbsp;She wants Bailey to come over when she gets home.&nbsp; Ok.

Ugh.&nbsp; Jacob wakes up. &nbsp;He had less than 30 mins for an afternoon nap.&nbsp; Darn kids.

I&nbsp;attempt to sort laundry.&nbsp; Jacob rolls on clean clothes.&nbsp; 

Then it's time to get big sister from school.&nbsp; I pick up Jacob and he's pooped again.&nbsp; YUCK.&nbsp; Change diaper and go get sister.

Why was it a glorious day? &nbsp;Well because the weather is absolutely beautiful.&nbsp; I exercised. &nbsp;I took a shower even. &nbsp;I&nbsp;even put on makeup.&nbsp; Imagine that.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp;&nbsp;"

It is an absolutely awesome day. &nbsp;The weather is so nice at a balmy 67 degrees.&nbsp; Absolutely perfect! &nbsp;My son slept all night in his crib last night! YAY.&nbsp; Jacob normally sleeps there every night, but since he's been sick with a bad cold he's been in our bed.&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp;He took about an hour and a half nap in his crib this morning! Woo! I am so happy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to straighten up and do a little cleaning while he napped.&nbsp; I'm thinking about a walk after lunch, but I have a basket of laundry that needs folding, need to change the sheets on our bed, &amp; straighten up and vaccuming upstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; My beautiful baby boy wasn't interested in eating his Gerber Graduates meal which consisted of ravioli and green beans.&nbsp; Instead he's eaten a mini bagel and now he's having some pineapple.

Bailey's at school.&nbsp; We were arguing this morning over what she would wear. &nbsp;She wanted to wear a dress, but her tights are in the wash.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no idea it was going to be so nice or she could have just worn socks.&nbsp;&nbsp; We usually pick clothes out the night before to avoid this fighting in the morning, but we had her friend over late &amp; didn't have a chance to.&nbsp; 

Our neighbor across the street was going to a meeting for the homeowner's association. &nbsp;I offered to watch her daughter which is really no big deal. &nbsp;Bailey was OVER&nbsp;THE&nbsp;MOON with excitement. &nbsp;She's 7 and absolutely no trouble whatsoever 'cept sometimes she and Bailey can't decide on which movie to watch or what to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than that they are great.&nbsp;&nbsp; She came right before supper.&nbsp; They played for a bit then came to eat.&nbsp; Charlotte had already eaten, but she said she'd have some mashed potatoes.&nbsp; Bailey was so silly. &nbsp;She sits down and asks Charlotte, &quot;So, how was your day at school? &nbsp;What did you do?&quot;&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; She thought that was the silliest thing ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was happy to have someone else at the dinner table.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After supper they went upstairs to play.&nbsp; At some point they decided they wanted to watch a movie. &nbsp;I put one on for them and Charlotte said, &quot;I didn't have dessert.&quot; Talking to Bailey.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So I got the girls some cookies and milk. &nbsp;We don't usually do dessert during the week, but made an exception for our guest. &nbsp;They were thrilled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Mom showed up around 8:30pm to get her.&nbsp;"

"event","My day is no where near over.&nbsp; The busiest part of the day is right around the corner.&nbsp; 

I feel like I've been busy all day, but I haven't really gotten much done.&nbsp; I&nbsp;do admit I was lazy while Jacob was napping.&nbsp; I layed down on the bed and finished the book I've been reading.&nbsp;

7am - the alarm goes off. &nbsp;I&nbsp;get up and wake Bailey.&nbsp; Jacob is still sleeping. &nbsp;We go downstairs.&nbsp; I make her some breakfast and pack her lunchbox. &nbsp;Make sure she has her backpack all set.&nbsp; 

7:15am - Jacob wakes up.&nbsp; I go upstairs to get him.&nbsp; I bring home down &amp; fix him some milk in a sippy cup.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He drinks it!&nbsp; I'm surprised. &nbsp;Last time I gave him a sippy he looked at me like I had two heads. &nbsp;He must have liked this particular cup better than the last one.

7:30am - upstairs to get Bailey dressed for school.&nbsp; I put Jacob in the crib to finish his milk.&nbsp; While Bailey dresses I make her bed and straighten up her room a bit.&nbsp; I help her with her socks and brush her hair.&nbsp; 

Then I change Jacob's diaper.&nbsp; Most days I&nbsp;get him dressed as well, but it seems pointless. &nbsp;Today I didn't.

7:50am - I rush into my room to brush my teeth and throw some clothes on.

8:00am we're out the door to school

8:10am home with Jacob.&nbsp; Just the two of us.&nbsp; I put dishes away that were drying on the counter from last night.&nbsp; Clean up Bailey's breakfast dishes.&nbsp; Straighten up kitchen. &nbsp;Check email, facebook, etc.&nbsp; Chat with mommy friends online.&nbsp; Change poopy diaper. &nbsp;Ugh.&nbsp; 

9:00am&nbsp; Feed Jacob his breakfast.&nbsp; Eat some breakfast myself.&nbsp; Clean up dishes and wash Jacob's highchair tray.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean up Jacob and highchair and whatever fell on the floor.

9:50am Take Jacob upstairs for nap

10am to 11:45ish Jacob naps.&nbsp; I read.

12pm&nbsp; Jacob plays in my room while I check email.&nbsp; Jacob dumps a box of cheezits on the floor.&nbsp; Jacob goes in crib.&nbsp; I get vaccum from downstairs and attempt to vaccum.&nbsp; It doesn't suck up the crumbs.&nbsp; I check hoses to make sure they're not clogged.&nbsp; The cannister was empty.&nbsp; I check the sponge filter thing and it looks fine.&nbsp; I use the hose disconnected from the vaccum to suck up crumbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

1pm I get Jacob some lunch.&nbsp; Had some green beans, potatoes, &amp; carrots left over from out dinner last night.&nbsp; More of it ended up on him and the floor than in his mouth I'm quite sure.&nbsp; I attempt to feed him a jar of squash.&nbsp; He keeps stealing the spoon from me.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's covered in food. &nbsp;He's a huge mess.&nbsp; He really needs&nbsp; a bath. &nbsp;I try to straighten up a little while he eats. &nbsp;The kitchen is a dumping ground for EVERYTHING.&nbsp; It's so annoying.&nbsp; 

2pm I take Jacob upstairs to clean him up, change his diaper, and get him dressed for the day.&nbsp; Seriously, if I&nbsp;had dressed him in the morning he would have needed an outfit change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Jacob plays while I figure out something for lunch for myself.&nbsp; 

3pm I take jacob upstairs for a nap.&nbsp; He sleeps for maybe 30 minutes.&nbsp; While he naps I clean out the vaccum some more.&nbsp; I clean the filter and bang on the cannister some more to release goobs of dirt.&nbsp; I go upstairs and use on of those dryer vent brushes to try to clear more dirt out of the cannister. 

3:30pm We go in my room.&nbsp; he plays I straighten up a little.&nbsp; 

4:30pm&nbsp; We come downstairs.&nbsp; Jacob plays.&nbsp; I sit down to google something and write my journal.&nbsp; 

&amp;&nbsp;wow now it's 5pm and it's time to get Bailey from school.&nbsp; 

What an incredibly boring day.&nbsp; I swear I get nothing done although I feel like I've been pretty busy all day."

"event","Fri. morning we wake up.&nbsp; Daniel asks Bailey if she's sure she wants to go home instead of going to Animal Kingdom.&nbsp; She says up and down no, she wants to go home and play with her Barbie Dream house.&nbsp; We had enough of it all and were ready to go.&nbsp; We got a quick breakfast at Captain Cook's Cafe.&nbsp; Daniel said we had 4 snack options left on our dining plan and to use that to get something.&nbsp; I thought poptarts would work.&nbsp; I got 3 and Bailey wanted a candy bar.&nbsp; Normally I would have said no, but we had to use up these credits and I didn't care on what.&nbsp;&nbsp; We get to the register to find out we only have 3 credits. &nbsp;I was going to just buy it but then I realized I&nbsp;did not have my wallet with me.&nbsp; So I told her we would put it back.&nbsp; Oh my spoiled child!&nbsp; She was not having any of it. &nbsp;She fussed, cried and carried on.&nbsp; The lady at the register said, &quot;Here. &nbsp;Mickey wants you to have this.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't really happy about it.&nbsp; I don't like taking things like that and I'm not especially happy that Bailey got her way by crying and fussing like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp;don't like to reward that type of behaviour.&nbsp; I suppose I should have said, &quot;No, thank you.&quot;, but I did not. &nbsp;I was loaded down with a stroller with pillows stacked on it and a couple of bags &amp; Jacob sitting in it.&nbsp; 

We sat down, fed Jacob some baby food and left the happiest place on earth! &nbsp;Yay!&nbsp; We headed back to Grampa's house.&nbsp; We had lunch at McDonalds and stopped at Walmart for formula and Daniel bought something at Home Depot.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think it was a toilet seat for a toilet in Grampa's house.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were only at Grampa's a short while.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were on the road around 3pm headed back home!&nbsp; 

I read my book till it was dark then I played with Daniel's iphone.&nbsp; The kids slept.&nbsp; Bailey watched a movie or two.&nbsp; We stopped on the way home at the worst Burger King ever. &nbsp;The food was so nasty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were people behind me in line that hadn't even gotten their food when we finished eating and left!&nbsp; 

We got home around 11pm.&nbsp; We put the kids to bed.&nbsp; I went to bed also.&nbsp; Daniel stayed up and unloaded the van and his suitcase.&nbsp; 

Trip over!"

"event","Day 4 is actually Feb. 10 - Jacob's 1st birthday!&nbsp; We headed to Disney Hollywood Studios.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel was disappointed that the Stunt Show wasn't going on during our visit.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our first ride was Tower of Terror!&nbsp; We got a child swap pass.&nbsp; Daniel &amp;&nbsp;Bailey went on the ride first.&nbsp; I was really surprised she was up for it.&nbsp; She didn't want to go for a 2nd ride tho with me.&nbsp; I hated it.&nbsp; I'll go on any ride, but I hate those up &amp; down falling rides.&nbsp; 

We had lunch reservations at the Sci Fi Dine In so we made our way over to the restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were early so I looked in a gift shop around the corner.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did mention to the hostess that it was Jacob's Birthday.&nbsp; The restaurant is set up like a drive in movie theatre.&nbsp; The restaurant is circular &amp; appears to be enclosed by a wooden privacy fence.&nbsp; There's a big screen with Sci Fi stuff playing.&nbsp; Old stuff.&nbsp; Nothing gorey or anything.&nbsp; In the middle are car tables.&nbsp; Bailey sat in the front seat and Daniel and I in the middle. &nbsp;We had some hitchhikers in the back.&nbsp; Jacob sat in a highchair just outside the car.&nbsp; To the left were a set of speakers.&nbsp; Where the dash would be was a couter/table to eat on.&nbsp; The counter was illuminated by a soft/low light so you could see your food somewhat.&nbsp; It's really cool, but I don't care for it.&nbsp; I don't like the idea of eating in a car while watching T.V.&nbsp;&nbsp; The food was so so.&nbsp; I had a cheese burger that seemed overcooked.&nbsp; The waiter seemed kind of blah.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure if that was part of his &quot;thing&quot; or not.&nbsp; I imagine it must get boring serving people who are staring at a screen.&nbsp; He did sing Happy Birthday to Jacob and brought him a huge thing of icecream with a candle in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; We exchanged it with Bailey. &nbsp;She got the big one and Jacob got Bailey's kid's meal icecream.

We rode the Great Movie Ride, Toy Story, &amp; saw the Narnia exhibit.&nbsp; We saw an Indiana Jones show.&nbsp; We left fairly early from the park.&nbsp;

We got back to the hotel and had dinner at Captain Cook's Cafe.&nbsp; We got back to the hotel room &amp; got the kids their baths.&nbsp; Jacob was in bed at a decent hour for once.&nbsp; We watched the fireworks and boat show from our room and then Bailey went to bed around 9pm. 

Dh played chess on his computer.&nbsp; I read my book and took a bath.&nbsp; A very relaxing evening.&nbsp; 


Day 5


We went to Epcot this day.&nbsp; I'm really drawing a blank. &nbsp;We did the Nemo ride. &nbsp;The wait was minimal.&nbsp; We had reservations at Coral Reef for lunch.&nbsp; This was a really cool restaurant. &nbsp;Our table was right beside of the tank.&nbsp; At one point there was a gigantic fish right beside of us.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was insane.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; The food was ehh...&nbsp; &nbsp;We were happy to have bread before our meal.&nbsp; The ambiance is that of a really nice restaurant.&nbsp; One that we probably wouldn't normally eat at. &nbsp;My brother had mentioned it was pretty cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was steak on the menu so I thought Daniel would have something to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;It came with something he wasn't interested in and he asked for fries instead and that was fine with them. &nbsp;I should have ordered the same. &nbsp;I ordered some type of chicken.&nbsp; It was okay, but I wouldn't order it again.&nbsp; Bailey had grilled chicken.&nbsp; For dessert Daniel &amp;&nbsp;Bailey had a make your own sundae.&nbsp; Just about all the adult desserts had some alcohol in them and Daniel was not diggin' that.&nbsp; He ordered his from the kid's menu!&nbsp;LOL&nbsp; I forgot what I had, but it was just okay.&nbsp; It was some chocolate thing &amp; icecream.

The rides we did - Test Track.&nbsp; The wait was entirely too long.&nbsp; It said 40 mins but it felt like an hour and a half.&nbsp; Soarin' was cool. &nbsp;I hadn't been on that one before.&nbsp; I wish Bailey would have gone with me or Daniel, but she refused.&nbsp; I don't blame her after going on Tower of Terror.&nbsp; While we were waiting for Daniel to do Soarin' Bailey &amp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;did the Land boat ride.&nbsp; He wasn't gone too long and I had a child swap pass to do the fast pass line.&nbsp; Meanwhile Daniel took Bailey on the Land boat ride again!&nbsp;LOL&nbsp; 

Daniel and I&nbsp;both did Mission Space.&nbsp; Daniel was telling me several people died after riding it.&nbsp; There are now two versions intense and more intense or something like that.&nbsp; I did the more intense version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hated it!&nbsp; I hate dark enclosed spaces.&nbsp; I was warned several times about it and I think that made it worse. &nbsp;It made me think about it more and more and by the time I got in there I was just like ugh.&nbsp; I was glad when it was over.&nbsp; 

Daniel wasn't interested in World Showcase.&nbsp; We went to Mexico and Norway to do the boat rides and then we left.&nbsp; I wasn't about to argue.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like World Showcase, but it seems like a lot of gift shops and restaurants and not much to really do.&nbsp; We've done it several times so I was fine with leaving.

We went from Epcot to the Contemporary for supper.&nbsp; We were told they had some normal American food at the Contempo Cafe.&nbsp; That's a joke.&nbsp; Dh did find some yummy pasta tho. &nbsp;I hate a turkey sandwich that had APPLES&nbsp;on it. &nbsp;WTH?&nbsp; Who puts apples on a turkey sandwich? That is just wrong&nbsp; It was pretty yummy once I took those off.&nbsp; 

We saw father in law's woman in the gift shop. &nbsp;She works there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bailey was excited to see her and gave her a big hug and she got some stickers.&nbsp; 

We got back to the hotel and did baths and got the kids ready for bed.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think we missed the fireworks this night, but we watched the boat show again.&nbsp; I'm sure we missed the fireworks because I remember Daniel saying he wanted to get back to the hotel before they were done. &nbsp;He didn't want to run into a huge crowd trying to get on the monorail.&nbsp; 

More reading, and playing chess and just relaxing.

Day 6 

We had a character breakfast at 1900 Park Faire at the Grand Flordian.&nbsp;&nbsp; We got there early and looked around the hotel. &nbsp;The Grand Flordian is very cool. &nbsp;It reminds me of my Mom a lot because it's really her style.&nbsp; I am not sure what happened, but I&nbsp;was not with Daniel and Bailey and when I came upon them she was all upset.&nbsp;&nbsp; She saw that they had a tea party with dolls set up. &nbsp;She was upset that she didn't get to take part in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel got mad and said &quot;haven't we done enough for you?: blah blah blah.&nbsp; I totally see his point, but she doesn't understand any of that or how much it costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked over with her and took a look at it and read the sign to her. &nbsp;She was happy about that. &nbsp;I told her we couldn't do it this time, but we would keep it in mind for next time telling her it's very expensive.&nbsp; I believe it was like $250 for the tea party.&nbsp; You get a doll with the package. &nbsp;A doll that sells for $50 in the gift shop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That seemed to help for me to explain it to her.&nbsp; 

We finally get into breakfast.&nbsp; The table was small. &nbsp;I had a hard time keeping things out of Jacob's reach. They had a coffee pot and coffee cups I&nbsp;should have asked them to take away immediately, but it was quite chaotic and it was a buffet.&nbsp;&nbsp;So while we did have a waitress she wasn't around much.&nbsp; It wasnt at the top of my mind to ask either.&nbsp; I had two plates in front of me - one for me and one for Jacob. &nbsp;It was annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I went to the buffet the first time I didn't think of getting him something.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;went back to get a few things for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bailey was thrilled to see the characters - Alice in Wonderland, The Mad Hatter, Winnie the Pooh and Mary Poppins.&nbsp;&nbsp; The food was fine. &nbsp;We stuffed ourselves 'cuz we planned on skipping lunch since we were having a late breakfast. 

After breakfast we headed back to the Magic Kingdom to do the stuff we missed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We did Buzz Light Year - line was waaay too long.&nbsp; We did Cinderella's Carosel, the Mad Tea Party, etc. We did the Little Mermaid Show, and Story time with Belle.&nbsp; By this time we were just tired of the parks.&nbsp; The lines were too long and it was just too crowded. &nbsp;We headed back to the hotel.

Daniel and Bailey rented a little boat and rode all around the 7&nbsp;&nbsp;Seas Lagoon.&nbsp; I came out on the porch of our room and could see them for a bit, but they went really far away and explored all the areas of the Lagoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;They both really enjoyed that. 

Afterwards we headed back to the Contempo Cafe at the Contemporary for supper.&nbsp; Daniel got the pasta again and I opted for a burger on a multigrain roll.&nbsp; Ugh. LOL&nbsp; It had big seeds all over it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was fine. &nbsp;I actually couldn't tell the difference between it and a regular roll.&nbsp;&nbsp; We got back to our hotel fairly early and watched fireworks and the boat show. 

It was time to pack up the place.&nbsp; I had been packing up a little while Daniel and Bailey were on the boat.&nbsp; After the kids were asleep I finished up. &nbsp;Daniel took it all out to the van so we didn't have much to take out of the room in the morning.&nbsp; 

Daniel actually paid an extra $10 for park passes for Fri., but we had enough. &nbsp;We didn't even want to go to Animal Kingdom!&nbsp;

Ok. &nbsp;Must wrap this up. &nbsp;I have a baby that wants his Mama."

"event","The day started as usual getting up with the kids around 7am.  I got Jacob a bottle and Bailey had some Apple Jacks newly purchased by Daddy at the store.  I brought Jacob to Daddy so he could drink his bottle while I got dressed.  I took a quick shower.  I was excited to see how my hair turned out.  Because I went to bed with wet hair it looked extremely wild.  I'm in dire need of a haircut also.  I didn't have much time to check it out, but it didn't like crazy or anything.

Bailey got herself dressed while I was in the shower.  She was wearing a pair of her new jeans and looked very cute.  I wear jeans and a tshirt also.  Daniel got up early and dressed Jacob and loaded up the car.  I fed Jacob some babyfood & Apple Jacks before we set out for Disney World.  We stopped at Walgreens so I could buy sunscreen & bottled water for Jacob's bottles.

We were on our way to Disney before 9am.  We arrived at the Polynesian just before 10am or thereabouts.  The bell cap dude unloaded our van.  I felt like we had waaay too much stuff.  Our room was ready tho!  We asked them to bring it to our room but Daniel got stuck at the Conceirge's desk longer than he thought.  They couldn't deliver it because we weren't in our room.  Oh well we'd get it later.  We checked out our room.  It was quite lovely.

Our room at the Polynesian had a lagoon/Cinderella's castle view.  I was so excited about this because it meant we could see the fireworks without having to leave our room! Yay!   The room was very much like the room we stayed in last time we were at the Polynesian.  I thought it was cool it had an iHome for your IPOD.  I thought we would use it, but we did not.

We couldn't linger in our room to for long.  We had to make our way to the Magic Kingdom for our 11:50am lunch seating at the Liberty Tree Tavern.

We rode the monorail from our hotel to the Magic Kingdom.  Daniel switched our reservation for Bippity Bobbity Boutique from Fri. at Downtown Disney to Cinderella's Castle shortly after lunch.  I was so excited about it and hoping Bailey would love it.   She was complaining and whining a bit and it just annoyed me so much because I knew of the surprise we had in store for her.  We couldn't stop and see everything she wanted to because we had to make our way to the restaurant.  We were early so we just sat around and looked at stuff.  

Lunch was pretty yummy.  I had some chicken/pasta thing.  Daniel had like a thanksgiving feast thing with turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing & green beans.  Bailey had Mac N Cheese & chicken noodle soup.  For dessert I had a yummy brownie w/ ice cream, Bailey had some type of ice cream & Daniel had strawberry shortcake.  The Liberty Tree Tavern was my favorite restaurant this this trip.  Unfortunately or fortunately it wasn't a character meal.   

After lunch we did the Haunted Mansion.  We checked out some gift shops.  I had to buy a hairbrush because when I made the reservations for Bippity Boppity Boutique I was told to bring one, but I totally forgot.  So I paid like $11 for hairbrush at the Magic Kingdom.  

Then we went to our reservation at Bippity Boppity Boutique.  Bailey was pretty excited.  She picked out Jasmine.  I was surprised, but it was probably because it was one princess outfit that she had never had before.   I let her pick out what she wanted from the outfit, shoes, tiara, etc.  I didn't care.  This was for her & her special treat.    She got dressed in her outfit and before long it was time to get her hair done.  She got her hair done, nails painted & makeup also.  She looked so cute.  We left the boutique and took her down to Main Street to get her pictures taken.  They turned out really cute.

After that we saw a parade, did some rides.  Aladdin's Magic Carpet ride, Big Thunder Mountain, The Jungle Boat, etc.   We ate dinner at Cosmic Rays in Tomorrowland.  After that we hit a bunch of rides in quick sucession.  I believe there was a parade going on and we were able to get  in & out quickly.  We did Winnie the Pooh, Snow White's Scary Adventure, It's a Small World & Peter Pan.  Then we headed back to the hotel.  We were rushing through the Magic Kingdom while the fireworks were going off trying to beat the crowd.  

We go back to the hotel & I rode with a very tired Jacob back to our room with the bell dude & all our luggage.  He tells us that the boat parade starts at 10pm.  It actually started at 9pm.  It's very cool and we could see it all from our room.  We sat outside and listened and watched.  These boats have these large wire signs that light up.  The first few are a dragon, then a whale, turtle, dinosaur, King Triton.  The music is very cool.  I can't describe it.  One song is ""Do the Dinosaur"" I think & Ariel's song.  In the end it all converts to"

"event","Trying to get my head back to Sunday of our trip.  I tried to write on like real paper and stuff, but I could never find the time.

Oh yes.  It was very odd being in the house of my father in law knowing he had a woman in his bed.   I thought it very weird and not really appropriate considering he was having company.  Couldn't he have had his booty call some other night?  So Sunday morning I got up with the kids early as usual.  I gave Jacob a bottle and searched FIL's refrigerator and pantry for something to feed Bailey.  He had some Multigrain Cherrios and milk.  Bailey wasn't interested.  She thought it very odd that Grampa kept his bread in the refrigerator and dismissed the idea of having toast.  She claimed she wasn't hungry.  Very odd behaviour for a little girl who wakes me up with the words ""BREAKFAST"" just about every friggin' day of her life. 

FIL and his woman get up not too long after.  He makes the introductions.   I'm polite, but not overly friendly.  I'm really just weirded out by the situation.   Bailey makes friends with everyone. She doesn't care.  She gets the woman to color with her and they've bonded.  She kept complaining about her back hurting tho as if coloring was hurting it.   FIL was holding Jacob near her when he sneezed all over her.  She didn't like it one  bit, but I couldn't help but think ""Go Jacob!"" LOL  He was spreading the love, I guess.

I feed Jacob some baby food and then go to get him down for a nap.   It never happened.  I was a little pissed at this point because I had been chasing him for hours keeping him out of trouble.  He was getting into everything and anything.  Meanwhile I had to put up with FIL and this woman while my dear sweet husband was SLEEPING.    So escaping to the guest room with Jacob was very appealing.  I tried to rock him, but no such luck.  He wouldn't sleep.  I just hung out for a bit with dh tho.  Meanwhile FIL decides he's going out with Bailey to get donuts.  I venture out while they're gone hoping to see that the woman had left as well.  Nope. Her car was still in the driveway.  She must have gone with them to get donuts.

Somewhere in all this I escaped to the bathroom for an hour to shower and get dressed.  I had enough of it all.   

The lady finally left sometime before lunch.  Daniel emerged from the bedroom and started messing around with Grampa's computer which was quite annoying.  We went out to Steak & Shake for lunch.  The specials are all $3.99, I think.  It was quite crowded.  The kids eat free also.  It was a good deal & fairly yummy.   

After lunch we went to Wal-mart.  I needed formula, shampoo, conditioner & Motrin for Jacob.  I also ended up buying him several shirt sleeve shirts & a couple of pairs of shorts.  I didn't have any warm weather clothes in his size.  

Then we went to visit Uncle Frankie & Aunt Carolyn.  Daniel fooled with their computer .  Bailey tickled Uncle Frank & Aunt Carolyn and they were just in awe of Jacob & everything he was doing and getting into.

We tried to visit Aunt  Babe, but she wasn't home.  

We headed back to Grampa's house.  I attempted to read, but was unable to because I was constantly chasing after Jacob.  I tried coloring with Bailey a bit while Grampa played with Jacob. Daniel was working on his Dad's computer.   

Daniel went out & brought back Quiznos for supper.  

Jacob had a bath.  Aunt Babe came to visit.  Bailey had a bath & to bed they all went.  For the next day we were getting up early to head to Disney World! 

While the kids were sleeping I packed up all our stuff.  Set out our clothes we would wear the next day.  Got bottles washed and ready.  I did laundry.  & Talked to my mom for about an hour.   I colored my hair light reddish brown, I think.  I went to bed with wet hair.  I slept very badly the first night there and not much better the 2nd."

I&nbsp;know this and that's why I usually pack and then go back and take stuff out well there was just no time for this.&nbsp; I was running around like a mad woman trying to get everything ready to go.&nbsp; I wasn't happy. &nbsp;The kids weren't happy.&nbsp; Daniel was grumpy.&nbsp; &nbsp;It sucked.&nbsp; We finally get in the car about 5pm.&nbsp; Daniel is annoyed it took us so long to get ready to go. Well HELLO.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean really. &nbsp;Who plans a trip &amp; leaves for Disney World in less than 24 hrs?<br /><br />We arrived at Grampa's house around 2am.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacob was WILD.&nbsp;&nbsp; We probably didn't get settled until 3am &amp; that's probably earlier than we actually did.&nbsp;&nbsp; Grampa has a guest room with 2 twin beds.&nbsp; Daniel pushed them together so we could sleep with Jacob.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bailey had to sleep on the floor. &nbsp;I tried to make it comfy for her by putting a bunch of blankets on the floor to cushion it a little.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was not interested in sleeping on the couch.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now I must go unpack and straighten up and do some laundry and that sort of stuff.&nbsp; I'll be back later to write about Day 2 of our vacation. <br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","I really love Craigslist.&nbsp; I always seem to have something for sale on there.&nbsp; Right now it's baby stuff.&nbsp; The CL in this area is extremely active.&nbsp; We have sold so much stuff on there.&nbsp; I sold all of Bailey's baby clothes &amp; other misc. baby stuff as Jacob no longer needs it.&nbsp; Daniel has sold his motorcycle, his car, computer monitors, etc. &nbsp;We've sold furniture &amp; other misc. household stuff.&nbsp; 

I have been dealing with a lady for about 3 weeks now who wanted 3 items I had for sale totalling $20.&nbsp; The first day she was supposed to come we got a bunch of snow so I figured she wouldn't be coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she said she could come Sun. or Tues.&nbsp; but I never heard from her.&nbsp; She emails me &amp; calls me Tues. morning saying she could come after she dropped her kids off at school, but I wasn't here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like she couldn't have made the plans the day before? Hello?&nbsp; I had written her off because it had been 4-5 days since I had emailed her last and didn't hear from her.&nbsp;&nbsp; So she said she was coming the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next day she calls &amp; says her kids are sick and can't come.&nbsp; So by this time I'm like screw it. &nbsp;I've got other people interested in the stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I sell one of the items she had wanted, but she had told me on the phone that she wasn't that interested in the bouncer seat.&nbsp; I sold it 2 days ago and emailed her to tell her so.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She was supposed to come today for the stuff and she emails back and says it's too far to drive &amp; she doesn't need it just yet for just 2 $5 items.&nbsp;&nbsp;WTF?&nbsp; I'm so freaking pissed.&nbsp; &nbsp;They may be only $5 items, but if she had to buy that shit it would be closer to $40.&nbsp; 

Just annoyed man.&nbsp; I hate CL&nbsp;people. &nbsp;They're so damn flakey.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;haven't bought much off of there, but when I have I have followed through and came when I said I would.&nbsp; She said she's in downtown Raleigh which is 20 mins from here.&nbsp; Big friggin' deal. &nbsp;Like I live in the boonies or something.&nbsp; What a moron."

"event","I just downloaded a new client for posting to LJ.  I usually use semagic, but for some reason I couldn't d/l it when I tried.  Daniel installed Windows 7 on my laptop & I had to reinstall my LJ stuff.  I'm not much liking this LochJournal at all.  

ANYWAY, Today was a nice day.  It didn't start out that way tho.  It started about 4am when I was awakened by that pesky baby Jacob.  I bought him into my room to sleep, but as usual the moment I push him over on my pillow instead of my arm he wakes up and starts his stuff.  The last straw was a head  butt at 4am.  Geez kid.  I got him a bottle.  I changed his diaper.  That was the problem.  He was soaked and his onesie under his sleeper was wet even.  Bad Mama!  Who wants to change diapers at 4am?  Not me.   So it's 5am before I get him settled with a bottle.  Then I am listening to him drink and wondering if he's sucking on air.   I'm sure it was somewhere close to 6am before I drifted off to sleep.  Not too long after that I feel a 5 yr old body cuddled next to me.    She lays there for awhile before she starts getting restless for breakfast.  I'm not in a good mood and tell he to go to her room.  Too late.  Jacob is awake now.   I look at the clock and it's not quite 8am yet.  I'm usually up at 7am.  I got to sleep in a whole 45 mins.  Yippie.

Jacob goes down for his nap a half an hour early at 9:30am.  I take a shower and make sure Bailey is dressed and ready to go.  Jakey baby wakes up early around 10:30am.  I get him dressed and off we go about 11am.  I wasn't sure where we were going.  I just wanted to go.   Daniel had a phone interview at 2pm and he kindly asked that we scaddle so there were no screaming noisy children in the background or stressing him out.  We didn't have to leave so early, but it was a good incentive to get out of the house.   It's so easy to just stay home.  Everything is easier at home with Jacob.  

I ended up going to McDonalds.  We got lunch and found a table in the play area.  I fed Jacob & Bailey ate.  Then she played till she had her fill and was thirsty.   Lots of running around & sliding.  By this time  it had gotten a bit warmer outside.  I headed to the library for books.  I was hoping one of the books I had requested online would be there, but nope.  Not yet.  Bailey picked up a huge amount books and I found one.  A  big thick book with tiny type by an author I've never heard of.  It's called ""An Outrageous Affair"".  I hope it's good.    Then we went to the park for an hour & 45 mins before coming home.     I put Jacob down for his nap and just chilled.  Bailey watched some T.V.    After T.V. & chillin' Jacob had woken up & we headed out to the garage to vaccum and clean the van.    Bailey was such a HUGE help.  Seriously.  She is the best little helper when she wants to.  I vaccumed and she cleaned off the dash .  Then she vaccumed the way back.  We were done in less than an hour.

It was pizza night.  The pizza was yummy & we watched Karate Kid III.  I had never seen that one so that was cool.  I saw one & two before, but never three.   Bailey enjoyed it a lot and was up doing her karate moves.  She's such a nut.

Bailey was really super the past two days and earned a prize tonight for all her hard work around the house helping Mommy.  Usually it's just something from the dollar store, but Daddy bought her a movie and told me to put it away for prize night.  Ella Enchanted.  Right up a 5 year old's alley with all that princess/fairytale stuff.  She wants to save it for the next pizza night."

"event","Bailey's on school vacation or &quot;track out&quot; for the next 2 and half weeks.&nbsp; She's been acting so bratty, ungrateful, and unappreciative lately.&nbsp; I usually take her all sorts of places if we're staying home. &nbsp;The children's museum, the science museum, playdates,&nbsp; out to lunch, shopping, those inflatable jump house places, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the behaviour and also our uncertain financial future, we'll just stay home for the most part.&nbsp; I do need some things as you may have noticed in my post from yesterday. &nbsp;I still don't have those things because I don't like to interrupt Jacob's naps &amp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;just didn't feel like going to another store yesterday.

Bailey now has her very own ipod!&nbsp; She's all excited about it.&nbsp; She inherited my shuffle. &nbsp;It's perfect for her.&nbsp; I'm listening to the music Daddy loaded up on it for her. 

Jacob is fussing. &nbsp;I imagine he's sleepy considering he woke me up around 4am.&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as he is laying on my arm he is pretty content.&nbsp; But if I roll over and move him over to the pillow he won't go back to sleep.&nbsp; So he was up for the day around 6am.&nbsp; Mommy doesn't get up till 7 unless he's screaming his head off.&nbsp;

"event","I'm sure it's no big surprise that Wal-mart truely sucks. &nbsp;I've known it for a long long time.&nbsp; I do shop there occassionally tho because it's not far away, they have an abundance of stuff and the prices trulely cannot be beat on most things.&nbsp; 

I&nbsp;was only going for a few things today, but I figured it was worth it because I would save a few bucks.&nbsp; The only necessities on my list were 1. formula for Jacob &amp; 2.&nbsp; a can of Bar Keeper's Friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bailey wore a sweatshirt to school that was a hand me down from her cousin.&nbsp; She likes it and it keeps her warm. &nbsp;She likes that if she gets hot she can take it off and just wear a tshirt that's underneath.&nbsp; I&nbsp;knew they were only $5 at Walmart so I told her I would check to see if I could get her another one.&nbsp; 

They had none of the 3 things I&nbsp;went there to get! NONE!&nbsp; Ok, so they did have sweatshirts, but NONE&nbsp;in the size I wanted. &nbsp;NONE!&nbsp; WTF?
I was so mad.&nbsp; I would have asked someone if I could have found anyone and I surely wasn't walking around a big ass Super Walmart for an associate to ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;

So that's my Walmart sucks story for the day. 

Daniel is getting laid off from Fidelity on 2/6.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; He's updated his resume and put it up on a couple of job search sites. &nbsp;He's applied for 3-4 jobs now,&nbsp;I think. &nbsp;This morning he got up at like 6am to go meet with a recruiter dude about a job. &nbsp;His boss told him if he needed to go interview just bill 8 hrs anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this recruiter dude wanted to meet with him so flippin' early. &nbsp;Oh well.&nbsp; I'm hoping something comes of it.&nbsp;

We've been doing a few things to save money because in this economy who knows how long it will take him to find a job.&nbsp; I called the electric company &amp; inquired about when their off peak times are.&nbsp; In the winter it's 1pm to 4pm &amp; 9pm to 6am.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So I've been waiting to those times to do laundry or run the dishwasher.&nbsp; I moved the heat back to 68 vs. 70 or 71 or 72.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ate out this past weekend 2 vs. or normal 3 times.&nbsp; I&nbsp;imagine we'll scale that back even more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel called to cancel our landline, but turns out we didn't have to. &nbsp;He was able to combine our cell phone bills &amp; landline bill into one and the landline is only costing us like $10 vs. the $75 we were paying before.&nbsp; We cancelled Netflix.&nbsp; I wouldn't mind canceling the cable t.v., but Bailey would have a flippin' fit.&nbsp; I'd really like to save money where we can without affecting&nbsp; her too much, but I think we really could do without that. &nbsp;We can watch DVDs that we own or watch stuff online.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a whole thread on my local playgroup board about people who do not subscribe to cable or internet. &nbsp;It's 3 pages long of people posting saying they don't have it &amp; don't want it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Luckily, I&nbsp;hope anyway, Jacob will be coming off of his $50 a week formula soon.&nbsp; I'm hoping to transition him to whole milk when he turns 1!&nbsp; I have to call his doctor and ask about that soon.&nbsp; My little baby is going to be 1 on 2/10.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's growing so big and strong. &nbsp;He's such a joy when he's not screaming!&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't get him down for his 2nd nap yesterday and he was awful near supper time screaming and carrying on.&nbsp; But when he's well rested he's such a silly&nbsp; happy baby.&nbsp; 

Bailey is doing well in school 'cept she's having a bit of trouble recognizing her #s to 30.&nbsp; She will tell me 12 is 12 and sometimes she'll tell me it's 21 and other times she just doesn't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She does very well with 1-10, but sometimes she has trouble with 8, 6, &amp; 9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her teacher reccomended she start attending a program sponsored by the YMCA called 21st Century.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's after school and they have a grant that pays for it.&nbsp; She's hoping when they come back from track out she can start.&nbsp; 

Today is her last day before she tracks out for 2 and 1/2 weeks.&nbsp;

Gotta get Jacob down for a nap."

We moved all this way to be closer to family & it seems the only way I see my Mom is if I pack up & take the kids to her house.  We're only 2.5 hrs apart.  I try to get down there once a month to visit when/if I can, but since Jacob was born it's just too hard.  She hasn't been to my house since April.  It makes me sad.  She was supposed to spend the night with us, but had to drive back home tonight because she has to deal with some stuff at work tomorrow.  I understand, but am disappointed.   She didn't even tell me till I called her this morning.  We cleaned up the guest room and bathroom and everything for her.  Oh well. LOL. It needed to be done anyway & we're having company on Sat. So it's all ready for him.    I know she's old and everything, but she's not dead! She won't go anywhere by herself anymore.   It just makes me sad, but I guess I should be happy I get to see her more now than I did when we were in MA.  We'd only see each other once a year then.  She's been here 3 times this year.

Daniel said the other day, ""You do know this probably the last year she's going to believe in Santa?  She's too smart and asking too many questions.""  What??  No way.  I believed for a lot longer.  Till I was at least 10 or more.   Last year I bought her this Princess storage stool thing.  Daniel hid it in his server closet quickly one day & I didn't know where he put it or I would have moved it.  Well she looked in there before Christmas and saw it and wanted to know what and who it was for.  Daniel told her it was her cousin Brittany's.   She accepted that no problem.  Then she got one exactly the same from Santa.  She still talks about how Brittany has one too.   She's even talked to Brittany about it, but she has no clue what Bailey is talking about and just says yeah & ok.  So tonight Bailey was asking what we did with Brittany's.  I told her we mailed it to Auntie's house.  LOL  So she's questioning things and I think she wants to be believe.  She believes in Santa, but she does not believe her brother crawled to the store to buy her a Christmas pre sent.  Every time I tell her, ""he crawled to the store & picked out your present all on his own.""  She says, ""TELL ME THE TRUTH!""  I guess a big fat guy climbing down the chimney with a sack of toys & flying through the sky with reindeer is just a lot more believable than your baby brother crawling to the store all on his own. 

I'm hoping we can keep Santa real for a few more years at least.  I don't know tho.    This year she asks me, ""Is that Santa or just someone dressed up like Santa?""  I have always said, ""it's Santa!""  Daniel told her that sometimes it's just someone dressed up like Santa to help out the real Santa."

"event","He was diagnosed on Fri. 12/5.  I had been to the doctor with him on Wed. 12/3 also.  He had a terrible cold and was pulling at his ears and not sleeping well.  He has been sick since 10/23 although he seemed much worse this past week.   We were at the doctor's on 11/13 as well for his 9 month checkup.  I suspected he might have an ear infection, but he was sleeping through the night and was not running a fever so I dismissed my suspicions.   At the appt. it was discovered he had a bulging ear infection & was wheezing.  So needless to say we didn't get any shots at that appointment, but 3 different prescriptions.  An antibiotic for the ear infection, pain drops for the ear, & albuterol for the wheezing.   He was due for a recheck of his ears last Thurs., but he was so sick I didn't to wait another day so we went in early.   The doctor said his ears were fine and that he just had a bad cold.  Thursday he ran a fever most of the day and was vomitting after eating.  He was gagging on all the mucus in his throat.  Fri. we went back because I suspected he was wheezing again.  The doctor told us to return if we heard it.   I was afraid at fithat I was just being a paranoid mother.   He clearly wasn't feeling well and I know there is nothing to be done for a cold, but he was so miserable.  Turns out he had another ear infection and was wheezing.  When the nurse was taking his vitals tho he was so quiet.  I thought great.  They'll think I'm insane.  So while we were waiting for the doctor I let him crawl around on the floor.  Sure enough by the time the doctor came in he was coughing and carrying on the way he does at home.  He was tested for RSV & it was positive.  We were given a nebulizer machine to bring home and an antibiotic for the ear infection.   The first day I gave him round the clock neb treatments every 3-4 hours.  I still am giving them to him, but I'm not waking up in the middle of the night to do them.  I'll give him one while he's sleeping before I go to bed.   He's not sleeping great.  He'll start the night in his crib and be in our bed after an hour or so.  He was up at midnight last night.  The neb treatments make him hyper/jittery.   

Must wrap this up.  Jacob baby likes the computer too much and makes typing very difficult."

"event","Bailey has been tracked out (on vacation from school) for almost 3 weeks.  We've had a low key, but fun filled time.  It's really the perfect time for a vacation at home because there is just so much to do this time of year. So far I'm diggin' year round school.  

The first Sun. or was that Sat.? of track out we went to the Ganyard Farms Pumpkin Patch in Durham.  It was the perfect fall weather that day.  To me it didn't seem like a real pumpkin patch.  They call it Agri-tourism.   The pumpkin growing doesn't look very serious.  You could I guess pick your own pumpkin from  the ""patch"", but to me it just looked like yeah this is how real pumpkins grow, but didn't look big enough to support the # of pumpkins they sell.  I could be wrong about that.  Sounds like a good topic to post about on the playgroup board.  Those Moms there know everything. LOL  

Later in the week we attended the State Fair in Raleigh.  Everyone raves about Fair Food.  I guess it's a guilty pleasure type thing, but I have never eaten anything at the Fair that I have really enjoyed.  I might be going to the wrong vendors.   Daniel took off a day of work so we could go during the weekday when the crowds aren't so bad.  We spent tons of money on ride tickets, admission, fairfood, games, etc.  

Then the 2nd weekend of track out we headed to SC to visit Grandmama for her birthday.    Oops, posted about that already!

 Mon. we have an appt. at Duke for a consultation (or so we thought) on Bailey's warts.  She's covered in them.  Her hands, wrists, knees, etc.    When the first appeared I asked her pediatrician about them & they said to use Duofilm.  We tried that pretty religiously & it kept them from getting bigger, but they didn't go away.   Well that was just too tedious and Bailey would get to where she didn't want me to do it.  The meds. get on the good skin around the wart and it hurts.   Well we did it off & on.    One doctor prescribed Aldara which is a creme for genital warts & Tagament a medicine for ulcers.  Apparently a side effect of the Tagament is that is kill warts.   Aldara cost $200 for the script & it didn't seem to help.  I had refills, but it was so flippin expensive.  If I had seen any improvement I would have had it refilled no problem.  The Tagament was just really disigusting medicine.   I tried it myself to see what it tasted like and it was just nasty.  I got her to take it for about a month tho.   It didn't seem to help either.      I also didn't like the idea of giving Bailey meds for ulcers when she didn't have one. 
We switched pediatricians when Jacob was born & they referred us to a dermatologist.  The dermatologist put cantharidin on her warts.  I thought wow, finally a solution to our problem.  I was so hopeful, but it didn't work.  She had 3 treatments with that plus more Tagament.  So off to Duke we went.  They treated 27 of her warts with a laser.  She cried.  Poor thing.  It hurts, but not as bad as freezing would hurt.  The PA said it was like a rubberband snapping her.    It's been almost 2 weeks.  I am  not sure if it's working or not.  They asked us to wait 3-4 weeks & let them know what's happening so they can get her back in for another treatment.

Wed. of the 2nd track out week we had a neighborhood Halloween Party.   

& Friday of course was Halloween!!!!!!!! Daniel took Bailey out to lunch.  Jacob & I went to vote! That night  Bailey dressed up as a good witch & Jacob as a pumpkin.    I dressed up in my witch costume that I've had for years.  I took the kids trick or treating while Daniel handed out candy.    

Sat. I took Bailey out to lunch and to see Beverly Hills Chihuahua.  

Sun. I stayed home with Jacob while Bailey & Daddy had lunch out & went to a birthday party for one of her classmates.

Monday we did the grocery shopping and I dragged the kids to Durham to check out Babies R Us and a couple of other stores.   Bailey hated it.  LOL.

Tuesday. was Election Day!  I took Bailey out for lunch at Red Robin & we went to the mall.   We didn't buy anything although I tried.  There was waiting to use the 1 dressing room at The Children's Place for like forever.  Some woman comes up behind me & knows we're waiting for it and asks if they can use the restroom to try on clothes.  I didn't know you could do that or I would have asked long ago.  So the associates lets the woman go in.  I was PISSED.    I stood there waiting a little longer and asked if there was somewhere else we could try on clothes.  Nope.  We could wait for the restroom.  NICE. I said I had been waiting and that woman had come up behind me and didn't even wait 2 mins before asking to use the restroom to try on clothes.  I put the clothes on the counter & left.   I should probably email TCP & tell them their stores suck for only have 1 dressing room.  

Wed. I took Bailey down to Raleigh to Marbles Children's Museum.  We ended up eating lunch at a McDonalds in the ghetto.  I felt weird, but sure was glad OBAMA had won and they all seemed to be very happy.  So that was cool.  Definitely not the place I would have wanted to be if he had lost.   Seriously, if he lost I would have expected rioting.   I would have stay home if that had been the case tho.  

Thurs. today we had to get the van's oil changed.  Big fun.  Other than that we just stayed home.

I'm not sure what we'll do tomorrow.  I was thinking since the weather is supposed to be nice we would go to the park in the afternoon."

"event","I planned a trip to see Mom earlier this week.  A couple of days later Jacob comes down with a yucky cold.  I was seriously considering canceling the trip, but it was Mom's birthday & I really didn't want to disappoint Bailey.  She was really looking forward to it.  She gets so excited.

So we leave the house around 10ish AM.  Jacob sleeps most of the way.  We arrive around 12:30.  I give Jacob lunch.  Mom feeds us.  We give her our present.  Then we head for the hair salon.  I notice while we're there getting our haircuts that Jacob has tons of yellow goop in his eyes.  I use a burp cloth and some warm water to try to get it out.  His eyelashes were caked.  

We were meeting my brother's family at Red Lobster for dinner around 5pm that evening.   Our dinners just arrive when I notice Jacob has pooped and it's all up his back.  I hold him at arms length while I carry him to the bathroom. 

I get him there and get him on the changing table.  I see that he is indeed covered!  I am using wipe after wipe, but am making no headway in the giant diaper explosion.  I know I am going to run out of wipes and I had a container full (travel size).   When he's reasonably cleaned up I ask someone in the restroom if they would stand beside of him so I could grab some toilet paper & wash my hands.  I remember I have a sample of some wipes in a side pocket of the diaper bag.  I find those and strip Jacob to get him cleaned up.  He pees!  Ugh.  My changing pad gets soaked.  

During the time I'm dealing  with this, the stall to my right is the handicap stall.  The door opens and a woman is standing there with her pants down around her ankles.  She's wearing some black lacy underwear and stockings.  She's an older woman - very much older - don't get excited.  LOL  She says something that I make out to be ""I'll help you with the baby if you can help me with this..."" & she's pointing to her crotch.  I don't know if she was wearing depends or what she wanted.  I didn't care to find out.  I said, ""I don't think so.""   What the hell??  That was bizarre.  She asked another girl who looked like a teenager.  She actually looked like she was considering helping the woman.  She must not have because a woman who works at the restaurant ended up helping her.   

The employee also stopped to talk to Jacob and actually got him calmed down.  Jacob was very very upset during this whole ordeal.  He did not like any part of it.  She stayed talking to him while I got him dressed.  She held him for me while I crammed everything back in my diaper bag and washed my hands again.   I had mentioned to her the older woman & that's when she said she had helped her.  I was like ""oh!"" foot in mouth.  I said, ""you're a better person than me.""  

I get back to the table and everyone is finished eating dinner and Mom was actually out having her after dinner cigarette.

I eat and we head back to the house for cake.

Jacob fell asleep in his car seat so I put him in the guest room and  let him sleep there.  He woke up and I gave him a bath and a bottle.  I had the hardest time getting him to sleep.  After like an hour of trying I finally layed down with him and he fell asleep on the bed.  I surrounded him with pillows and went to see about getting Bailey to bed and to visit with my Mom.  Around 11:30pm I went to bed.  I moved Jacob  to the pack n play. He stirred a little, but settled down for a little while.  I couldn't sleep.  I had like 3 diet cokes at dinner.  I was wired plus being in a different bed.  Jacob woke up around 1am.  I tried to settle him back down.  His eyes looked so bad he was crying and crying.  I actually thought his eyes were swollen shut for awhile.  He finally opened them and they were like slits.   I know he had the goop before we got to Mom's house, but I think the air in her house and the hair salon just made it worse.  Mom smokes and she smokes in the house when no one is there.  She smokes outside when we're visiting,  but the particles are still in the air.  I didn't smell anything, but when we come home our clothes always smell like Grandma's house.

So around 2am I decide since Jacob wouldn't settle down & I'm getting no sleep that we need to leave.  I had given him a bottle, held him, etc. and nothing I was doing was comforting him.  I knew that he'd go right to sleep in the car.  I pack everything up and take it out to the car.  I wake up Bailey and we're on the road by 2:20am.  I left a note for my Mom.   Her husband woke up around 4am and got the note.  They were up ever since worried about me.  She waited till 10am  to call tho.  I feel bad, but I was going nuts and had to go.  Jacob fell right to sleep in the car and I think I got more sleep by just coming on home.  Jacob slept till 8am in his car seat.  I brought him in and  put the seat in his crib.  He never woke up.  I think he stirred a little when I put him in the crib, but went back to sleep.   

I gave Jacob a bottle around 8 and then brought him back to bed.  I got a couple of more hours sleep while Jacob napped.  I'm ready for sleep now.

Tomorrow we have an appt. at Duke for Bailey.  It's just a consultation for laser removal of her warts.   I'm hoping this is the solution I've been hoping for.  Poor thing is covered in them."

"event","That's what it feels like.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some days I love that my husband works at home and others I wish he'd get the hell out of here.&nbsp; Actually, I have to admit it's great that I know I&nbsp;just have to call him to the dinner table from his home office instead of wondering if he is working late or stuck in traffic.&nbsp; I always know he'll be on time for dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's great that he's here to deal with the cable people or the landscaping people or whoever else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, he was bitching yesterday about how loud the TV was and that the dog was driving me nuts and he couldn't get any rest.&nbsp; It just pisses me off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Get yr ass out of bed before 10am. &nbsp;Go to bed at a decent hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been trying to get in bed before midnight so I don't even know what time he comes to bed anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; He never gets up before 10am unless he has a meeting or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; So now he's resting/sleeping I&nbsp;am being nice and not turning the T.V. on.&nbsp; In awhile when he comes downstairs to work in his office I won't turn the T.V. on for I don't want to disturb his work.&nbsp; It SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Usually when he's downstairs working I&nbsp;go upstairs. &nbsp;I'm not a couch potato and watch T.V. all day or anything. &nbsp;I just like to turn on the news while I'm cleaning/straightening up/playing with Jacob.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I turn on&nbsp;CNN the friggin' news stuff is one volume and the commericals are a LOT louder.&nbsp; So it's impossible to keep the T.V. quiet because I&nbsp;can't hear it over whatever noise Jacob is making. &nbsp;If I turned the volume down it just wouldn't make any sense to even turn it on 'cuz I couldn't hear it. 

I really want to vacuum and mop the floors down here today. &nbsp;It needs it so bad, but I like to watch TV while I mop/clean.&nbsp; Housework bores me to death!!!!!!!&nbsp; I can't put my Ipod on 'cuz i&nbsp;have to be able to hear Jacob.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;tried wearing the IPOD the other day &amp; I&nbsp;couldn't hear him very well while he was napping. &nbsp;I had the volume turned down low and everything. &nbsp;But anyway... So being a housewife can bore the SHIT&nbsp;out of you. &nbsp;Having a tv on for company, noise, information, entertainment, etc. helps me get through the day while I&nbsp;go about my business of being the maid, mommy, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;But here I&nbsp;sit being quiet as a mouse so my flippin' husband can sleep till 10am or 11am or whatever while I've been up since 6:30am.&nbsp; 

It would be nice if he got up earlier and stopped working at 5pm.&nbsp; But no. &nbsp;He works straight up until dinner time. &nbsp;No matter whether dinner time is at 5:30 or 6:30pm.&nbsp; I know someone has to make a living here to pay the bills and all, but it just seems he keeps his own schedule family be damned sometimes.&nbsp; 

Tomorrow he's getting up early to take Bailey to Karate.&nbsp;&nbsp;That should be interesting. &nbsp;Last weekend he was in such a piss ass mood after getting up that early.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he complained of a &quot;headache&quot; when I wanted him to feed Jacob so I could get a shower/dressed/etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nice, right?&nbsp; I don't get a day off for a headache, a cold, the flu, or whatever else ails me.&nbsp; Why should he?

Ok. vent over.

Love ya honey."

"event","Today Bailey had her 5 year checkup.  This is the first time we've had consistent care by a physician that we see *every* time we go to the doctor.  Bailey has been with me for all of Jacob's doctor appointments.  He's had 4 appointments & I've taken Bailey in for 1 sick visit.  So she's had plenty of opportunity to get to know the office & the people.  The nice woman at the front desk is always the same.  The nurse is the same.  The doctor is the  same.  It's just the 3 of them.  I love that.  Bailey felt very comfortable there.  Too comfortable actually. LOL  She was a mess and so full of herself.  It was almost embarrassing.  She hardly let the doctor get a word in.  

Bailey didn't need any shots because we got them all at her 4 year checkup.  Yay!  She's 52lbs and 3ft 7in.  Her eyesight & hearing are good also.  The nurse brought in 3 cans of Alimentum for us to take home for Jacob!   How cool is that?  It wasn't even his turn, but since we were there they stocked us up.  It's not a regular size can, but whatever.  It's free!"

"event","To move South?  Visiting here the last few days has been so nice.  We were able to leave Bailey & Jacob with relatives overnight!  That was so nice.  So nice to be able to sleep late for once.  We've had others we can hand the kids off to for a few hugs, cuddles, burps, etc.  Not that it would be like that day in and day out if we were living here.  Of course the day to day responsibilities of the children would be ours, but occasionally to have family close enough that they would want to see the kids.  The excitement and joy Bailey gets out of hanging out with Aunt Pat, Uncle John, Auntie Cheryl, & even Daniel's good friend Ernie is priceless.  She was so cute tonight.  We went over to Ernie's apartment and he was telling her about this book he was reading called ""Weird New England"".  Then he told her about a strange light he saw over at a house across the way & something about an old well nearby that had been covered up.  She was so intrigued.  She said it had to be ghosts or goblins or witches.  She talked about it the whole way back to the hotel.  So anyway, I'm wondering if we did the wrong thing by taking her away from so many family & friends.   Yeah down South we have awesome parks, beautiful tree lined streets, nice weather, etc., but she's missing out on so many wonderful family and friends.   

I love my family, but I feel so detached from them.  It's like if they see us great, if not that's okay.   We've created our own individual families and extended families aren't important.  Maybe it's because we're at different places in our lives.  My brothers' children are so much older and they're just in a different place now.  I don't know.  I can't even really put into words what I'm feeling. But I love it that up here when you have a birthday party you invite the child's friends and all the cousins too.   It's a big party not just a kid party, but a celebration that includes Aunts, Uncles, etc.  I wanted that kind of thing for my kids.  The past two birthdays Bailey has had in NC I invited my Mom, & my brothers and their families.  My oldest brother from SC made it to both with his kids.  He values family.    My Mom couldn't make it to 1 party & I completely understood she had already made plans  to be away.  My brother who lives right nearby less than 20 mins from our house couldn't make it to either party.

Today I met Cheryl at McDonalds for lunch. After lunch we headed to the park to hang out and play.  Brittany complained she was bored and it was hot.  Bailey & Tyler had fun playing tho.  After that we went to the mall to hang out.  We just stayed in the food court play area for the most part.  It gave the kids an air conditioned place to run around & play together.  I sneaked away to check out the Children's Place and my addiction - Gymboree.   I bought an outfit for Brittany, Bailey & Tyler at the Children's Place.   Brittany was wearing pants that were at least 2 sizes too small.  They were too short, but she said oh well they're capris now.   Cheryl said the kids have tons of new clothes, but they don't wear them.  So weird.  I wouldn't let me kid leave the house wearing clothes that were 2 sizes too small.  Heck, I wouldn't even have that in my house!! I would have gotten rid of them already.  I guess since I don't have 3 kids and 3 jobs tho I just don't understand how it is.

I think from now on I will be buying clothes for the kids instead of toys or crap they don't need."

"event","We're in MA for the next two weeks. We left Fri. after Bailey got out of school.  We stopped in Maryland for the night around 10pm.  I noticed when we pulled off the main road that there was an IKEA across the way.  I have always wanted to go in one to see what it was like.  The next morning we checked it out.  I liked the furniture stuff, but the other stuff was just okay.  I really like the kid's stuff too.   Daniel bought the kids each a toy & some of their chocolate bars.   Bailey went into the Smallland for a little bit while we looked around.  I went through it really fast.  Seeing as how I wasn't buying anything I didn't look at anything in particular.  Just walked around to see what it was like.  I thought it was decent quality & the prices were good.    I wish there was one closer.  Charlotte is supposed to be getting one, but that's 3 hrs.  

We arrived in MA around 7pm at Aunt Pat's house.  She held supper for us so they cooked us ham and potatoes, and corn.  It was yummy home cooked food.  We stayed there Sat. & Sun. night.  Sun. we went to the Franklin Park Zoo in Dorchester.  It's a cool zoo right in the middle of the ghetto.   Pretty odd.  It was just my kind of zoo tho - nice & small.  :)  Bailey & Jacob really enjoyed it.   It was the perfect weather - overcast & cool.  It started to rain  at the end and we left soon after that.  We all ended up skipping lunch that day and we were starving when we got back to Aunt Pat's.  She put out some cheese & crackers while she finished up the spaghetti & meatballs.    It was yummy.    Oh... I almost forgot!   Uncle John made Bailey M&M pancakes for breakfast.  She was thrilled.  Then after breakfast she made Aunt Pat's famous chocolate chip cookies too. Bailey had to add some M&Ms to the cookies as well.   It was a jam packed day.  

Monday, Bailey convinced me to make her M&M pancakes <insert eye roll here>.   That was fun.  Everyone in Aunt Pat's house  had left because they had to work.  It was just the 4 of  us.  So anyway, it was a  trip trying to find everything to make the pancakes.   It probably took me longer to find everything than it did to make & eat them.   Oh... Forgot to mention that Jacob got us up at 5:56am!!   Uncle John leaves for work around 5:45am and that set our dog Storm off which in turn woke  up the kids.   After breakfast and clean up I started getting  our things packed up.   After I fed Jacob his 2nd feeding I went upstairs and Daniel was awake so I started getting things up there packed up.  I got a shower and then while Daniel was checking his email and checking in with  work & fixing Uncle John's computer I loaded the entire van!   That was fun! NOT!  LOL.   We have a ton of stuff with us.  1 suitcase for each of us plus a couple of other smaller bags, a laundry basket of stuff, etc.    Around lunchtime we leave to get some lunch & head towards the hotel.  By this time I've been up for 6-7 hours already.  I'm ready for a nap.  

We check in at the hotel.  Daniel was trying to get us upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite, but there were none available.  So we are stuck with a studio.  We head towards Rutland to drop off our dog with Aunt Kathy.  The hotel charges  like $75 a night to keep him here.   We hang out visiting with  Aunt Kathy & then  head to Charlton.  O.M.G.  We sit in the driveway just looking at the disaster of a yard.  There is stuff everywhere just tossed here and there.  No rhyme or reason to it.  Daniel calls to see if anyone is home because  Cheryl's van isn't in the driveway.  The phone is busy.  I  go to  the door with Bailey.  The screen door is still missing hardware so it's hard to open.  I had to pull it open anywhere I could get a hold on it.  There are cigarette ashes and butts strewn on the steps in front of the door.   We see the kids standing in the living room so we walk in.  They are happy to see us.  We can barely walk in the place.  There is stuff everywhere.  I don't know why I was surprised.  But every time I talk to Cheryl she tells me how much work she's done and how much stuff she's gotten rid of.  I don't know why I thought maybe since she knew we were coming that she would  have cleaned up so we could visit.  I'm just so annoyed.   

Bailey just asked me if we could go to Auntie's house.  I said, ""No.  We can't go there.  There's no where for us to sit.  There's no where for Jacob to play.""  How sad, huh?  We come visit once a year and she can't even clean up her fucking house so the kids can play.  Such a loser, slacker, lazy, ass.  Can you tell I'm pissed off? 

As soon as Jacob eats we're going to  leave & go to the park, I think.  I'll call Cheryl and let her know where we are in case you wants to join us.  By the time she gets out of bed & dressed tho we'll have had enough of the park & ready to go somewhere else.    This is how our trip will go because they spend all morning in bed because the kids don't go to bed until  11, or 12 or 1am.   So the  mornings we'll be on our own.  She'll want to get together in the afternoon.   We'll have a few hours before supper time  when we'll join Daniel when he's done work for the day.   

I need to make plans with Ashley to go to the Art Museum.  I want to go to Davis Farmland one day with Bailey.  

Today we need to get to the store and buy some  snacks, bottled water, diapers & stuff.  Cheryl wants us to go with he to help Tyler pick  out a bed for his room.  I don't know why she's  bothering.   He doesn't sleep in there.  He sleeps in his Mom's room in her bed.  The Dad sleeps on the couch.  Ashley was  sleeping in Tyler's room when she was there.   <strike>She moved out</strike>  I don't know if  move is the right word.    More like staying at her boyfriend's  house.  He lives with his  Mom.  I don't blame her tho.   Anything is better than staying at her Mom's house & being a built in babysitter."

"event","So Daniel just laid it on me that he wants... wait a minute.  Is it layed? or  laid?  hmmm.  Whatever.   He just told me tonight that he wants to go to Massachusetts when Bailey tracks out in 2 weeks.  TWO WEEKS!  WTH??  Going to MA with 1 kid is quite a feat, but TWO?! AN INFANT?  Heaven help us.  Not that I'm a big believer in that type of thing because I'm not.  He mentioned it like hours ago and I'm just NOW starting to freak out.   It really didn't hit me  till now what all I have to do between now & then.  What the frig is the weather like in MA this time of year?   It could be hot as hell or you could be starting to feel the smell of fall in the air.  O.M.G.  A little notice would be nice.  Geez.  

So much to do in so little time.

1. get appt. for oil change. i think i need like the 30K service.   yikes. that's $$$
2.  get a haircut.   ugh.  that means going to florence to see mom.  
3.  put all of our appts. on my calendar 
4.  & reschedule as needed for when we'll be away
5.  schedule a mail stop
6.  ask neighbors to keep an eye on things

Poor Jacob.   There is no way I can carry enough water with me to last 2 weeks.  Is there? He drinks about 35 oz a day.  Good thing my life doesn't depend on figuring  that out because I have no clue.  Good thing I know how to Google.  128oz = 1 gallon.   I'd need to take about 5 gallons of water with us.  Holy friggin A.  I wonder if we can drink 5 gallons  of milk between now & then so I can save the jugs to be able to reuse  them for water.    Am I totally being insane?  Because I remember my Mom telling me about a trip to the beach she took with my brother Jimmy & how she had used different water to make his formula & how awful his poop was because of it.    Good lord.  I'll be bringing a friggin' blender with me to mix up formula.  Unless we're staying somewhere that has a blender.  Hmmm.  CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For Jacob
- 5 gallons of water
- blender
- stroller
- formula
- bumbo seat
- cereal
- tons  of burp cloths
- bibs
- tshirts, shorts, pants
- socks
- diapers
- Robeez
- blankets
- bottles
- pacifiers
- bouncer  seat
<strike>- exersaucer?!</strike>

Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Did I just put exersaucer on the list?! He loves that thing.  I guess since we'll be on vacation I can  depend on  dh  to be around to watch  him while I take a shower or wash bottles or make formula so I shouldn't really need an exersaucer, but dammit he loves that thing, I think.   He really spits up a lot while in it so maybe not.   Yeah we can probably scratch that.

packing for myself should be easy since  all i wear is shorts & tshirts.  i'll throw in a pair of jeans.  a dress or two.  last time i only took  my crocs.  boy are they comfortable, but i could probably use a couple  more pair of shoes. xpalladoicious.  

goddammit.   

no, i really want to go.  i love the thought of spending 2 weeks with  my family without most of the distractions of everyday life.  bailey will be SO excited."

"event","Yesterday, because of the issues I'm having with Bailey & not listening & not cleaning up her toys, I told her there  would be no TV today.   

It started out with whining and fussing.  We got out early to go grocery shopping before lunch.  I was so impressed with her offering to help me.  She took 2-3 bags at a time.  I gave her 1 to start & she said ""I can carry more"".  She even helped me put the groceries away.  She's such a big helper. 

Instead of watching TV this  morning she played in her playroom.
After lunch she played some  more in her playroom. 
This afternoon she was on the computer quite a bit too.
She actually helped me make supper, set the table, gave Storm his food, etc.   

It was actually a pretty nice day.

& For a reward for being such a good girl today i let her watch 1 episode of Scooby Do before bed."

"event","I wake up at some point  in the night to a fidgety baby.  He sleeps in his bouncer seat near the foot of the bed.   I think he  might be hungry, but I bring  him to bed with me & give him a pacifier.   He settles down and rests  some  more  with  me.   Either the  fidgetiness returns or  Bailey comes to get us up.  We go downstairs for breakfast.   This can happen anywhere from 7:30am to 9am depending on - when Jacob last ate, what time Bailey went to bed & wakes  up, etc.  Bailey gets her own breakfast.  I get Jacob's medicine ready to give him.  This consists of finding the bottle, cutting open the packaging, getting the pill cutter and cutting the pill.  He takes Prevacid for his reflux.    Every other morning I have to cut a pill.  Obviously every other morning I have half left over to give him.  I go sit at the desk in the  kitchen with Jacob  lying in my lap.  I hold the 1/2 pill inside his mouth near his cheek till it dissolves.  It's usually a minute or two.  Then I give him 1 tsp. of water  with a syringe to wash it down.  Then comes the longest 15 minutes of the  entire day.  We have to wait 15 mins till he can eat after taking the medicine.  Some mornings are better than others, but usually he's fussing if not outright crying.  He's hungry.  

Poor Bailey is fending for herself because when he's upset I can't even think straight.  I am just focused on him & trying to keep him as calm as possible.  During this time I try to get her some milk, but most of the time she has to wait.  After I give Jacob a couple  of ozs of formula he's calmed down  some.  I can turn on some cartoons and get  her some milk.   Some  mornings are worse than others.  At first I was following the doctor's instructions of dissolving the Prevacid in  1 tsp of water and administering that way.  But the instructions said to wait 10 mins for it to dissolve and then 15 mins after to feed.  That was 25 minutes before  he could eat!  I did some reading and this is much easier on everyone. 

Bailey's been out of preschool for a full week.  Last week we went to the library,  had ice cream, did the grocery shopping, & errands.   Nothing particularly fun.  She didn't seem to care.   Daddy took her to see a movie Thursday evening.   She also went to lunch with him and to the comic  book  store one afternoon.  That was the day we found out Suzy-Boy died.  Suzy-Boy was  her Beta fish.   She was reasonably upset about it.  I was so proud of the way she has handled it.  Not overly dramatic.  Just enough upset, but not overly so.   He got himself  stuck  in a shell that was in his bowl.  

This coming week we are going to the car dealer for some service in Durham.  That is a hike,  but there are a couple of stores I want to visit while we're over that way.  I'm in search of a Laptop Lunchbox  System.  I want to check one out in person before  I order online to make sure it's what I want.  I always have to pop into Babies R Us when we're over that way & Nordstrom.   I guess we'll make a day of it.  

We're going to see Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium with ""playgroup mommies"".   That  should be interesting with Jacob in tow.   I'm hoping if he gets fussy I can just ask one of the Mommies to keep an eye on Bailey  if I need to step out for a moment.  It's a free movie.  The theatre is doing free summer movies for the kids.    We're doing that on Tues.

Wed. we're going to a picnic in the park with playgroup mommies.  

Thurs. I had planned to go see Stacy's Littleland Band, but this past Thurs. we went & Bailey wanted to leave before it was over.  She said it was too loud & too crowded.  :(  He actually put on a pretty good show this time too.  He played a lot of his songs from his album & Old MacDonald Had a Farm.  She seemed to enjoy it at first.   The last time we were there he was plugging the Goddard School across the street from the coffee shop he was playing in.  It was awful.  In the middle of the show the owners came up & spoke to the crowd.  It was bizarre because here we are a bunch of stay at home moms and these people are talking to us about a daycare?  weird.  I was apalled that all the Moms were being so rude and not even listening to them & carrying on conversations.   But then again I was annoyed Stacy would do that too.  He's gotta  make a living I guess with 3 kids of his own.

When we got home on Thurs. we just hung out here.  Daniel asked us if we'd heard about the fires burning in the Eastern part of the state.  I had no clue.  We went out to get the mail and the smoke was horrible.  I heard on the news that Wake County 911 had received 300 calls reporting a fire in their neighborhoods.  The 911 dispatchers  had to explain it was smoke from a fire hundreds of miles away.   We heard it was a ""Code Red"" day.  Everyone was being advised to stay indoors due to the very poor air quality.

Fri. I checked the news site and it was  another ""Code Red"" day & even tho it looked fine out they said there were particles of ash floating in the air still.  We just stayed in till we went out to eat at IHOP for dinner that evening.  

Today we didn't do much.  Bailey & I went out early this morning to do secret Father's Day related things.  Daniel got up & took  pictures of his motorcycle.  He's wanting  to sell it again, I guess.  With having Jacob,  working at home and everything he just doesn't get much opportunity to ride it.  I was worried something went wrong with his job or something because he loves his  motorcycle, but it's not the case.  We ate lunch & he drove into the Ford dealership to look at their vehicles.  I think the Ford Edge is a nice looking vehicle.  The Tarus X  is just a strange looking vehicle, imo.  The salesman spotted us right away and came over.  Daniel was moving the van & I was talking to the salesman.  He wanted to know if we wanted  to trade in the Odyssey.  LOL  I had no friggin' clue what was on his mind.  I said I didn't know whether he wanted  to trade the van or his car.  Boy did I feel like a dumbass.  Oh well.  I think  he's just kicking around the idea of trading his  car & seeing what's out there.  The dude was  telling us about the Ford Flex.  It's supposed to replace the Freestar.  I looked it up when I got home.  Boy is that an ugly piece of shit.

I've been looking for the Wii Fit thing.  No one has it.  I asked at the Walmart near our house and the man said he hadn't had any in 2 weeks.  We were there 2 weeks ago when  he made the announcement over the loud speaker that they had Wii Fit in the electronics dept.  Daniel asked if I wanted it then, but I didn't know much  about it.   Now I'm hearing how cool it is & it's nowhere to be had.  I didn't quite realize how in demand it was/is.  The man said he gets 50-60 calls a day about it.  They don't know when they'll get more.  I don't really feel like stalking Wal-mart. 

I started walking again last week.  I was so annoyed Thurs. to hear about the Code Red thing & the air quality because I really wanted to keep it up.  I haven't walked since.  Fri. was another Code Red day so I didn't bother.   I wasn't planning to walk on Fri. or Sat.    Sun. - Thurs. was my plan.  I strap on the IPOD and off I go.  I enjoy it.  The time to myself.  Checking out the neighbors porch furniture and  their flowers.  I'm wanting something for our porch  and trying to figure out what that is.  Seems like every other house in the 'hood has black rockers.  Seems to be the cheapest & most practical & best looking way to go, but dammit I wanted something different.   I refuse to spend a ton of money on something that will sit  outside and get dirty.

Jacob is such a smiley little guy.  He is great when he's  not screaming or  spitting  up all over me.  
Bailey is so  smart and  she's  always cracking me up.   I especially get tickled when I hear her giving her Daddy a hard time.  She sounds  just like  me.  I try hard not to laugh because she's being quite rude, but I can't help it sometimes.   She likes to use words like ""certainly"" & some others I'm drawing a blank on.   She's a mess.

We finally moved her to a booster seat a couple of weeks ago.  She had been in her Britax  Marathon since she was  about 4 months old.  We found a Graco highback Turbo booster seat at Target that was pink & super cute.  It was pretty inexpensive so I got it for her.  I am just so sad about it.  I feel like she's not as safe as she was before.  I really wanted her to wait till she outgrew her Marathon... But at the same time I was  anxious for her to move on to the booster.  I don't know why, but I just felt like it was finally the time.  It goes against everything I have read  tho and I'm not so comfortable with it.    She sits very well in the booster.  I lock her seatbelt every time I  put her in it tho.  She was telling me in the beginning she was  moving around a lot.  She's not used to that so I lock her seatbelt so she feels more secure.  She gets annoyed, but oh well. 

Jacob is  4 months now.  We go for his  check up on the 23rd."

"event","We started out late this afternoon.  Bailey's allowance money was burning a hole in her pocket.  She had saved it for 3 weeks and with this week's allowance she  had $20.  We stopped at Learning Express.  It's a cute little toy story with some nice stuff.  They have a huge selection of kid's Crocs, Jibbits, toys, Kettler tricycles, Plasma cars, Corelle Dolls, etc.  She wanted these Medieval figurines.   They were pretty expensive.  Daniel was able to talk her out of them by saying we were going to the mall & the Disney store.   She ended up at Build A Bear.  She wanted to spend her $$ on a bear.   She has several Build A Bears.  A bunny, a purple bear, a kitty, a dog, & now a white bear.  She spent $28!  Probably would have been less if I had saved the coupon we got in the mail recently.  I threw it out because I couldn't imagine myself letting her get another BAB.  She had so many already.  Letting  her spend her allowance money is hard because she  wants to buy junk & stuff she doesn't need.   Daniel said, ""I though you said no more build a bears?""  I did, but everything she wants is junk so why not. It's her money.  Maybe next time we can direct her towards buying herself a movie or something.  She always wants to buy toys.  Toys she doesn't need.

Bailey starts kindergarten on July 7th.  She goes for 1 day that week.  They have a staggered entry that week to do assessments.  We have ""Meet the Teacher"" on July 11th.   It's totally weird.  There is only 1 kindergarten class on Track 3 so I don't know why we're meeting the teacher after the  first day of school.   Today at the mall I got her some  new sneakers for school.  I need to order her backpack.  

( I'm watching a movie & the convertible this couple is sitting in has no headrests.   What's up with that?  You can see they were removed.   I guess it was easier to film the scene without them?   Probably thought no one would notice.)"

I've never said anything like that in my life nor has Daniel.   She didn't get it from us.  I have no idea where she picked this stuff up."

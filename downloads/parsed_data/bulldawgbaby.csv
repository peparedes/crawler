"event","I went to shoot some hoops the first time in 3 years.. a lil rusty. When i was in high school i bought a basketball.. Everytime something was bothering me, i went to the courts for hours and threw the basketball in the net. there was nothing like the sound of the whoosh of the ball going in that made me feel better. of course most of the time I spent chasing the ball but when i came home everything that was bothering me seemed so clearer.. and my decisions were great.. last time i did this before tonight was when we were evacutating for hurricane ivan. I remember i wasn't the only one shooting hoops that night because nick was outside doing the same thing as i was about to do.... nick was a friend of mine from that year. 

The thing that made me want to go shoot hoops tonight was the things between me and him. I am sick of running i am sick of pushing. I figured he was worth a shot after i told him all the things i have went though he still stayed and told me that everything was cool and no worries.. A few weeks ago i was going though something and i did something i told him i used to do. he told me how I was better then that and that sometimes with life u have to take the ups with the downs. that night after he left I thought everything was cool between us (We got into a fight that monday). I hate fighting with him. I don't do in on purpose. I swear i don't. when we fight I am misrible. I have felt that way twice. We don't always fight or argue.. we actually used to get along great.. 

In high school he once told me something that had to do with being yourself. it was something he wrote in my yearbook. then reminded me of our lunch time discussion. The next year after we graduated I missed him horribly. cause there was no one to really joke around with during down times at  jd. I saw him that year i was shopping in the mall and i remember saying to myself ""I hope he doesn't see me"" but he did he smiled (that oh so sexy smile) and i returned it. that day i was so happy. i dunno y i felt like i was on cloud nine. 

3 years or so passed.. I was searching around on myspace after kay added me. i had to read his profile cause he had no pictures of him. It sounded like him so i added him as a friend. I posted a picture of me and him at prom just so he knew it was me or something i dunno. 2 nights later we exchanged screen names and phone numbers.  we talked on yahoo for two hours. he told me i never gave him the time of day back in high school. i laughed at all his jokes back then. I remember him giving us a 20 min summary of a scarey movie i remember when he went to hattiesburg for something and entered a contest. I voted for him cause i really wanted him to win... that night after we talked i went to sleep a lil depressed cause i missed him so much and remember how much he made me laugh. 

we talked the next day about some stuff.. then that night i went to dinner I told allison i was not feeling to great because of him. I missed him so much and that made me feel a certain way. she told me a funny story I went back to my room to eat and got on the computer a few mins later i got an im from him my heart when up in my throat. that night we talked on the phone. I told him after that it was so good to hear his voice... 

i came home on the 22nd we planed on going to see a movie.. we went and saw harry potter. i don't remember much about the date but i remember when ever someone asked me how it went all i could say was he kissed me and i could go into detail about that. everything from what was said to how his lips felt. 

the 26th we hung out and watched 2 movies. it was his pick because there's nothing i really wanted to see.. and i was tired and just was like whatever u want to see is great.. the first movie to me was boring. the second one was ok but the thing that made it great was laying in his arms. 

the next time we went out we saw a movie.. it was funny.. not something that i would watch all the time but i'd watch it when i'm down. we talked some more in his car on the way back to my house he dropped his cig and he found it but it was a good laugh.. when he walked me to the door we hugged kissed a few times and joked around. 

the last two times we chilled in my room and i was ok with that. 

sometimes when i go to sleep convos play in my head. or these dates play in my head like i am watching a movie.. monday replays in my head constantly. but its more in slow motion... for a month i felt like i was living someone else's life. cause shit like this just doesn't happen to me. i came to the conculsion tonight that i had something great and i fucked it up.. i tend to do that a lot. but now i am sick of pushing and i still feel the same towards this person as i did on the 22nd of dec."

"event","U told me one time that you would try to give me whatever it was that i wanted. All i ever wanted was u. U would be really happy that i haven't been listening to anyone. I know i was in the wrong.. U told me once that it bothers u that i think we argue.. I tell u i don't want to argue with u but mainly i am just saying ur probably right. U told me on the phone I don't know u. Thats true because the more i opened up and felt comfy with u the less u were with me. It bothered me on monday when u told me that u really liked me. It keeps going back from that. Always has. I didn't know anything until u told me on wednesday that u liked me u took it back less then 3 days later.. 

That day in hattiesburg when we spent two hours on the phone talking. right before u got off the phone u told me u'd call me at 8:30 the next night and i didn't have to wait for ur phone call or anything. I did. because i wanted to hear ur voice. I told kassie that month that it really feels like i was living someone elses life or I was dreaming and i didn't want to wake up. When I went to class after everytime we talked i had a smile on my face for no reason. because for once. i was happy and u made me feel that way. I fell hard for u but i was confused over the fact that i didn't know if it was something i was telling myself to feel or something that was real. I was depressed about school and i let it get to me... I never meant to blow up at u on the phone in fact right after i hung up i was thinking of calling u back. U told me u never know whats bothering me cause i don't tell. When i do tell u whats bothering me this happens.. it happened 2 times not all the time but 2. 

U told me that ur not going to change. I never wanted u to change the one thing that bothered me about u wasn't enough to make me not want to be with u. Because u told me that, that was in the past. I don't always bad mouth u. U can ask anyone that i talk to they know how happy u make me u always have even in high school.. I thought last night of memories from high school and we were talking one day at lunch about online people. and i made the comment when someone asks me sex (as in gender) i say yes please. and u looked at me and repeated it and laughed... that was the first time i ever talked to u. When u weren't asking me to have my 17 kids. we did get along pretty well.. there were times even then that i got on ur bad side (just not as bad). That time u went to Hattiesburg (i think) and u and 2 other guys did that thing for truth.com or something it was some contest. i told u that i hope u lost. I voted for y'all as much as i could cause wow thats talent. I remember one morning i was over talking with phillip and them and u gave us a 20 min thing on scary movies. I never laughed so hard in my life up until a few weeks ago that is. 

that friday u were over here was the only tiime i laughed harder. cause it was so much fun.... sometimes when i did something again it was a lil turn on to hear u get a lil demanding. cause before that its like can i kiss u can i do this.. Always asking damn. LOL... i never lied to u. I wouldn't have told u the things about me if i didn't feel comfy with u. for some reason I was like might as well tell him what he's getting himself into before anything happens just in case. 

when monday happened. all i could say was i hate him so much.. I had to hear no u don't and sad thing was they were right. I can't think of anything that makes me feel that strongly towards u.. I hate fighting with u i really do. I don't do that on purpose I swear to GOD i don't. thats why when we talk in ur car on the phone in person or whatever i say I am not going to argue with u thats only when u start saying No no no christine... 

I know i told u this like 20 million times that i never ask u to defend urself. I ask yes or no questions i need no explaination unless u want to give me one. I mean depending on who u talk to that knows me u might hear everything from i did drugs and got drunk with one guy to i fucked the ftball team..  I quit listening to people that i know that don't like you. kassie told me the other night that she should have those feelings of strong dislike towards u and i shouldn't because atleast u made me happy for awhile. I like how i feel when i am with u. there is nothing that will change that. U honestly make me want to be a better person. I am not this girl that u saw this past week.. i really ain't. I don't care about ex's. I don't care for drama and u know that. I am more flexable and u have seen that. I didn't constantly ask u why u are smiling after i told u once that i am not used to that.. i told u about patience. and u told me about benifit of the doubt and i give u know. I do. I do trust u, if i didn't i don't think i would have went with u to the movies.. when u told me that u tried to make me happy. hun if i wasn't happy being with u then why would i have wanted to see u or agreed to doing things with u? mainly stuff that was more then friends.  
 
I dunno what to say except i hope u do call me so we can talk. -k-"

"event","i woke up about 2 weeks ago looked in the mirror and said today is gonna be a good day. I was finally happy. Not because someone made me happy but i remembered something he had said and it made me laugh. 

I woke up a week ago. thought today is gonna be a good day. I looked around. and thought about the night before. He looked at me and told me he liked me. I was excited. Finally to hear those words  i had everything i ever wanted and more. 

I woke up today looked in the mirrior and thought well atleast the sun is shining.. the only thoughts i had was lets see if my computer is working. cause i was having some issues with it last night. 

Last night I reflected on my life. while listening to Tupac. There is something about the song thug manison that makes me wanna medate with lit candles and just not think. That song kind of reflects parts of my life. I had highs and lows. I have highs and lows in friendships/relationships.  

When I thought of the bastard I compared him to. I didn't mean it bad. me and the bastard wasn't really friends and things between me and that ass had a bad ending. 4 times in my life i had been so low and so hard on myself that i cut. I know people care its hard to explain when everyone wants to judge/ offer their advice. I wrote a entry in here sunday jan 22 nd. that was me trying not to do something cause I heard his voice telling me that I am better then that. and remembered how he held me when he was telling me that. I wrote that i was confused when it comes to him. cause its been like hot and cold since dec. 8th. 

I thought the 18th everything was cool when he looked me in the eyes and said I like you. If i knew it was gonna be taken back I wouldn't have felt the way I did. 

I woke up today with the sun shining and went and took a walk. I remembered for a split second what it was like to be on top of the world then a few days later feel like your world has been ripped right from under you.  then I thought of him and how happy he made me. The laughter. the tackling to get a sweatshirt out of my hands. The semi-fighting because somethings he did was a real turn on. LOL. I haven't felt this way towards a person in a long time. its hard for me to let others in because i am afraid that I'm gonna get hurt.. for some reason with him it was different I never felt like he was gonna hurt me and i let him in. I don't regret it. I really don't 

I was talking with a friend of mine last night about how lindsey had a miscarrage.. I feel for her... and I talked a lil about my situation. for the first time i am not confused about how i feel. I really like him and care for him but I can't do anything about anything any more. I am not this person. I know I am not.. I am not verbally jealous. I feel it and then think oh thats stupid. I don't agrue i hate confrontations thats why sometimes i say i don't care. and i do usually mean it... a week ago i was happy. Today I am breathing.. Tomorrow.. i dunno......"

"event","I wasn't what he wanted. He wasn't what i expected. 

Since I pissed him off after calling all his other girlfriends/flings sluts. we probably ain't talking until he comes back. Also i wouldn't get off the phone when he wanted. he told me to talk to him over the computer cause he couldn't pause his game and was doing 2 things at once. (playing his game/ talking to 10 other people).. I got pissed and said that thing about his other chicks. When he was over here wednesday I kind of felt it. even more so when he was on his phone saying that he's chillin over at his homegurl christina's house. He said it about 4-5 times before he corrected himself. 

Hard feelings i have none. I can't even feel at the moment. i walk around in a daze most of the time have been since that monday i blew up. Its everything negative. Maybe in my mind i didn't want to see the bad. sad thing is i compared him to brady. I'm saying wow right now. I can't believe i said that. I told Candy about the brady comparison and she told me what i already knew. 

We find excuses to back out. Mine was him using drugs in the past. his was my friends/cutting/the way i talked/ coped an attude when i didn't/ negative things. I cut once. I don't always do it. i haven't done it since last monday and am never gonna do it again. I am getting a punching bag soon that way when i feel a certain way i have something there to take my anger out on. I called my father last night for the first time in years and said ""thanx for fucking up my life u sorry son of a bitch"".

 maybe i should of used his friends as an excuse. its fun to see stuff posted on myspace that leads me to think stuff other then what he says. Also he compared me to a chick that he slept with (personality wise) . I think that was pretty low. because everything he doesn't like about her (personality wise) I am gonna think he doesn't like about me. if i ask him any questions he starts defending himself. I never asked that. I was told back in december ""if you hear something about me ask me and i will tell u the truth"". that few out the window when I asked him if he does drugs he told me he did and asked if it mattered what he did. then when i didn't answer that question he asked if i was gonna hold it against him. Maybe I should have because he seems to Hold everything against me.  

no matter what i tell him he won't believe me. I knew that for a while. there was a strong:  like and care for him  and i  was willing to except his flaws. but how can i except his flaws when he can't except mine? I am not a perfect person. i told him i was messed up in the beginning. I told him everything i think he needed to know and he said it was fine and everything was peachy when in reality it wasn't. 

I spent 3 hours telling my mom everything thats all i could do.i'm talking every thing. He didn't pop my cherry he stretched it i am sure. it didn't hurt until after he left that day. but that day is gone like everything else is. just a distant memory or a dream. I woke up. I saw things as they really are.. things between us has never been great. we never had that strong of a friendship until recently.. if it lasts i will be amazed. 

 I was crying cause i was hutting.  when ever i feel down i think of all the good times i had  when i was in high school before i moved to mississippi.. and i dream about one of my guy friends and in that 8 hours or so of sleep i am happy and content. and i am gonna go now because i explained everything to him in a lengthy email. and I thought as much as i could I am still confused but it isn't a good confused any more."

"event","umm yea today has been messed up. I dunno how i feel (i say this b/c one min we're talking the next we're just friends i know we're friends first and for most. but how it jumps back and forht gets confusing) .. Things have def. changed from the way they were. I hate it. back decemeber when ever i was online we'd talk. He'd im me while he was playing a game and that used to get on my nerves. He told me that friday we ""kicked"" it would i rather not have him talk to me at all? 

we talked about what I wanted in a relationship. I want trust and communcation and i was getting that up until i blew up at him on the phone. Then the commuication went down to a minium. I am trying to deal with it. and keep myself  busy so i don't think of him or have the urge to want to talk to him. 

I am trying so hard not to be negitive. I was told no depressing chats, no negitivie thoughts and to keep everything positive. sometimes thats hard. How can i tell him things that he wants to know if he doesn't talk to me in return. sometimes i feel like i'm fast b/c of all the things we have done. I don't regret it but it makes me think wow..

I have two pairs of gauchos soon to get some more cause those things are comfy for running around the house in and wearing when i don't really wanna get dressed but need to type thing.. I came to the desion after the last time not to wear them around him. but then I was thinking I know that will fly out the door like no kissing no cuddling. i enjoy his company but i dunno anything any more.  

I am more depressed over my school situation and to hear my grandma's voice when i told her what i was doing about college sort of got to me tonight and reason why i have thoughts and feeling around 10pm.

 i wish someone told me that this wasn't going to be as bad as it is. where it conserns him  i get told that i fight him. I really don't sometimes i am feeling a certain way at the time and I really don't want to feel that way. I am not mad, sad, crappy, or any other negitive feeling towards him but i wish I got more of a response to things I've said. I actually felt bad last night that one of my friends had to be my entertainment. It wasn't because i was bored I just really wanted to talk to anyone that would listen. not really talk about him or advice or feelings but talk to talk.. talk about the good ole days in high school, talk about things that are going on now. just random thoughts thats how i am with most of my friends.  

with the ""if you wanna fix things you wouldn't fight me"" I was feeling a certain way in the fact that i didn't want to be that close to have a close personal discussion b/c I was feeling really crappy when he showed up. I didn't even say hi when i saw him.I went and walked half way out to his car and when we hugged all i could say was ""i'm sorry"". He asked how i knew he was there. I was standing on the porch when his car came up. Then he asked about my pants. Cause he wanted to know how many pairs of gauchos I acutally had and i told him two. We walked into my bedroom He layed half on the bed and then we kind of sat there and agrued over come here. cause he wanted me to straddle him and then lay down (uncomfy when he's feeling frisky lol). we didn't really talk about anything until he saw the cuts on my arm. then He held me in the most uncomfy position and i told him everything so he'd let me up i didn't lie. I did try and thats something i'll admit.. I got up and got something to drink came back sat on the floor while he took up most of my bed. then i moved some pillows he moved back and we layed there for a while. we did make out and fooled around a lil. lots of laughter and lots of holding.. 

he told me the difference between friends that date and people you date. I was told not to completely shut him out and if i have to to call him and tell him whats going on with me. then to do that. Then i was told nothing depressing or negative anymore.. it really hit me right then when all this was said. I dunno what to think about it. I know sometimes u have to look at the flip side but at that moment i really didn't want to cause i spent the last two days looking at the flip side to everything.

I don't need any more vivid dreams about him. and ones i am actually remembering.sometimes i wish i could go back to dreaming about stuff i never remembered the next day. I don't need all his attention or time thats for sure. but i would things to be like they were. you know a phone call once in a blue moon because he wants to tell me something. or an im just to bs around nothing serious nothing deep.. i had enough of tapping into my emotions for a LONG time. I had and heard enough drama and shit that i think if i hear or have any more i'm gonna scream. I miss hearing you so wild. 

I know not this week but the week after I'm gonna try to start some craft projects to keep me busy after i clean up my ""cave"" and in periods of this week and next i'm gonna look for a job. i dunno what else i can really think of. I am not depressed about my situation involving him. i am more so bumed about school and bored to death so i needs me a job.

<lj-cut>a convo between me and a friend about something i do..: 

 chuckles61032: I rubed his shoulders for no real reason 
K: ah.
chuckles61032: i am like that. i knew how he wanted me to rub his braids while before he left he was watching the parkers sitting on the edge of the bed I got behind him and started rubbing his shoulders. I saw his head move forward and back and i quit 
k: LoL
chuckles61032: i didn't know if he was enjoying it or not 
chuckles61032: but I am like that its one of my things
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
chuckles61032: he wanted me to rub his braids some more and i was like well i really don't want to cause i knew he was tired..
K: LoL he would've fell asleep in your arms.
chuckles61032: more like in my lap. 
chuckles61032: I am like that though you know that song cater to u. thats what i am like 
K: LoL.</lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""what i like about him"">
what i like about him:
-how when I am feeling down he knows the right thing to do/say to make me laugh.
-his hugs 
-his kisses/ thick lips. 
-just being happy when I am with him. 
-watching movies together 
-talking about anything
-the look he gets on his face when i hestate to kiss him/or when i laugh b/c of something that he did
-hearing him tell me that everything is gonna be ok/ small lectures about things (cause if i think that if i have to explain something to him its not worth doing it) 
-him playing with my hair/rubbing my shoulders for no real reason 
-tackling me to get a sweat shirt out of my hands and then falling on the bed laughing. 
-trapped in the closet 
-cuddling 
-his smile 
-his impressions 
-listening to/watching him sing/dance in his car 
- the voice i hear on the phone (the i'm so cool and laid back that it doesn't matter) 
-how mellow he gets when his braids are being rubbed. 
-his cologne 
-when he is serious about something. 
-his style (always looks sharp) 
 what i don't like about him: 
-some of the lectures that he can give i know he doesn't mean it but its just the way he can say things sometimes.

entire reason for posting this entry: i want him to know that when it comes to him I am confused. because of how we go from one thing to another then back to one thing. I also want him to know i am not in the best of moods right now and it has nothing to do with him. all I am asking of him is if he shows up and i look like i've been crying not to sit and tell me everything is gonna be ok. sometimes i need to cry sometimes i need to scream/vent/yell and most of the time I don't want to hear anything about how things will get better and how sometimes failures happen."

One of my friends: LoL

One of my friends: like wait, you said the new job was in burmingham (hyst) right? like what's it next to?

One of my friends: now you think date?

me: something just clicked	
One of my friends: LoL

One of my friends: LoL
One of my friends: it's like magic?

One of my friends: ah
me: idunno i thought of that as i was throwing clothes out of my closet. 
One of my friends: it's funny what you'll think of when you're cleaning.
me: yea i know i normally listen to music but tonight i was talking to myself cause something was bothing me. and i looked at the picture of me and him at prom. 
me: i know i used to laugh at all his jokes and turn red at hearing him telling me the stuff he told me. and when he wasn't telling me those things he was half way decent. and we did seem to get along. 
One of my friends: ah
me: yea.. sad
One of my friends: how's that sad? you got along. that's a good thing.
me: my horoscope said i was gonna wanna reflect
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
me: i'm more like whips and chains. handcuffs a lil love tap type thing.. 
me: the ludicris song
One of my friends: LoL.
One of my friends: don't tell him that...
One of my friends: he'd be sayin what?
me: he knows a few things 
One of my friends: make love to me...
One of my friends: LoL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
me: there are things he does that makes me laugh.. there are things he does that i enjoy.. and then there are things he does that make me think <i>okay...</i> 
One of my friends: LoL
me: yea 
me: i told you when he was licking my lips.. 
One of my friends: ew no.
One of my friends: and thanks for keeping it in...
me: we were kissing and he took his tounge and was running it over my lips.. 
me: i actually enjoyed that.. 
me: when he was trying to get my tounge into his mouth he said come here why isn't your tounge leaving your mouth. now everytime he tries that move on me i start laughing
me: he tries to suck on my chin that makes me laugh really hard. 
One of my friends: ugh

One of my friends: ugh...

One of my friends: LoL
me: and he told me
me: i also found theres a spot on my neck that he kisses it feels oh so good. and he hasn't don't that in a while 
me: i try to tell him this stuff but some how i always forget. 
One of my friends: LoL
One of my friends: when you do, he'll use it against you...
me: i know.. like the thing about the thick lips..

"event","me and ""him""  got into it last night. i felt bad for blowing up at him on the phone. i told him i wanted to be with him and he said <i>oh you say that now</i> Ive been saying that since day1. The worst thing we have gotten into it about was drug usage.. thats the only thing that bothered me the most. 

what bothered me about the whole christina shit was he told me his last relationship was 3 years ago. Christina happened 1 year ago so i heard. but its something I don't care about because that was before me. So why did i bring it up. i have no idea. i didn't want to talk about it when we did.. I am not listening to anyone i am sick of pushing I am sick of running.

i was willing to wait and still am willing  to wait on him until after his birthday. I am not saying that to be saying that cause i never say something i don't mean. He asked y the questions, i don't wanna find out something terrible. sometimes i say or do something that i didn't mean to do. Yesterday was a prime example. 

 I really as much as i had said this am willing to work things out. I am sorry and i don't know how many times i can say that.. I have been crying since sunday and it has barely stoped. I asked for a second chance he said <i>we'll see after i get back.</i> 

we were talking about above all else we're friends. I said no cuddling or kissing. He goes i cuddle with my friends... if we're up in the air then I don't want to cuddle cause its gonna make me feel worse then how i already feel. If i ever feel this way again towards someone its gonna be a miracle to me. Cause I am so ready and willing to give up on any chance to be happy.I had to hear that I am always pissed off at him. that is not true never has been. The phone convo last night was just something that I was like <i>I really don't want to talk to you right now</i>. I wasn't in a good mood and the way my voice sounded it wasn't how i meant it. 

theres so much more i wanna type but i can because right now all i wanna do is cry and feel horrible.. 

I was happy when jennifer just lent her ear and didn't give me advice just told me that it was good i am willing to wait.. and that it was good that when he says he's gonna call he does, when he sees me online and talks thats good. she didn't do what everyone else has been saying ""oh he doesn't care about you"". like he told me he was being honest cause he could have just went down there did his thing and came back acting like nothing happened."

"event","I've been feeling pretty crappy since yesterday. What concerns me the most is the fact that he thinks that he makes me mad or frusterated or irrate.. He doesn't..  I opened up about something that i don't really share with people cause I know they'll judge me. then He comes back tonight with some thingmabout how people never listen or pay attention to what he says. I DO!! 

I don't talk about sex with him because i remember who I'm talking to and I clam up or shut down. yea its something I guess i need to work on when it comes to covering topics with him. I know i corked up (thats how he put it) on tuesday when we were talking about where his hand was the previous week.. I said I just moved it back cause he asked ""was that so bad"" and I didn't wanna hear it. then he wanted to know if it was and I noticed a car in front of us and made a comment about it.. But where his hand was actually wasn't bad.. 

it was sad to hear that he's not as attracted as he was but still is attracted. I don't know if I still feel the same ""like"" as I did.. I know that the kisses on the lips need to stop because one day one person isn't gonna feel the same anymore and its gonna break the others heart (i'm tearing up as I type this, because of just the thought of it bothers me). I enjoy kissing him don't get me wrong. 

I once told him that the max time I could ever be mad at him is 10 secs. because after those 10 seconds he has me doubled over in laughter.. He said he was gonna shorten that time to 5 seconds. the 10 second rule still stands because i keep thinking of all the sweet gesters that he does and how much he makes me laugh.I was mad at him once and mad at myself at the same time for being mad at him. The main point of me being mad was the hypocrit he was being, I forgot to remember that he forgets a lot of things. 

I care deeply and right now it hurts.. I have to get this out of me right now because I don't think I'll be able to sleep until I do. I hate when I feel like we are argueing or fighting. He once told me that it bothers him that I feel like we argue. 

I remember the First time I heard his voice in 3 years, that was a nice thing.. Mainly we talked about my music preferences but it was just so comforting to hear him. 

I enjoy anytime I get to spend with him now, I don't even care what we do. Thats weird to me because in high school sometimes I couldn't wait to get away from him, but he said he was sorry for how he came at me. 

If i had one wish I would wish that he was as attracted to me as he was when I first asked him.. :(( 

I'm gonna go now.."

Kay is probably still up in Philly so I doubt I'll be hearing from her. 

Is it wrong to not know what you want out of life? Is it wrong to care so deeply for someone but have no idea if you feel love for them or just a strong like? Why is it hard to get a straight forward answer out of certain guys? Maybe its me and the fact that I am used to ending something before it starts.

When I'm with cory in his arms I feel like nothing could happen to me. I feel security. lately after we've ""hung out"" i wake up the next day with a smile on my face feeling like I had the greatest sex in the world the night before even though nothing happened. when i hear him being a lil demanding its a small turn on and it makes me want to do whatever it was that i was doing to get to hear it again"

"event","acutally USM is the correct term.. There is nothing like going to a party school but every now and then it starts to feel like High school and grade school all in one.. 

Some dip shit thought it would be a great idea to set varies things on fire last night over in McCarty.. then I think last semester someone set off fireworks over in Bond Hall.. I mean its like WTF.. Their parents Money at work here I guess. 

Shit I forgot to copy my notes for Trev. Oops. Between writing a paper and my only class being cancelled today I kind of forgot.. I've been trying to go back to sleep since I walked back to the dorms. Thursday-sunday are my days to catch up on what lil sleep i have missed during the week. Well atleast thats when I come down from my caffine high.. 

I hate when people hand out stuff over by The Hub.. Its like dude their just gonna throw it away right after you give it to them.. 

20 days and counting.. I get to go home to alabama and chill out for a couple of weeks before (hopefully) coming back here.. Just what I am looking forward to.. 

I get to be blind for atleast one more day becuase mail on the coast is running late and my glasses had to be sent off.. GRR. IT sucks because I think trev was sick of me leaning over and asking what the teacher wrote on the board. And appearently he thinks I can read lips.. I mean I can but when a person speaks fast its like Damn dude.. 

So right now I am sitting in my ""jail cell"" (dorm) getting ready to fall asleep hopefully.. I haven't been sleeping well period. During thanksgiving when I was at home I passed out at 9pm. I got 12 hours of sleep the night before.. Weird.. I guess REM thingy kicked in.

Some guys need a Game for dummies or something like it. I swear like when justin says stupid shit its like ""do u honestly think I am impressed by that shit."" GRR. I don't understand why I have to have the most preppiest guy attracted to me.. 
 
Well that wasn't the case in high school. I had the most countriest guy attracted to me but I wasn't complainning(SP?) because, HE was: HOT, a good friend, we ran in the same circle (kind of). He always made me feel good about myself. And since he's friends have big mouths I knew that he liked me.. AWE!! LOL. But that was then this is now.. I'll get over it.

Adios"

Paul my stalker from Long beach has left me alone for a whole week. Thank God. I told him to fuck off 20 times and I had to explain to him for 30 mins why I didn't want to meet him. Rich boys that never been rejected need to get a life. I mean if someone tells me to leave them alone I do.. Then he IMed me back like a day or so later trying to give me advice. the advice was how to act if I ever met anothe short tempered person. I was like Dude I am as short tempered as they get.  Then I left him with this: If a girl tells you to leave her alone you don't keep talking to her.. and if you do what you do to me online in real life to a girl then she might slap you with a restaining order.  I mean like keep coming around after he is not wanted. so i went to Myspace today to see something and he wrote: girls can't live with them can't live without him"". My saying is ""guys that can't understand the words: no, hell no, fuck off, leave me alone, and other choice words. are not worth my time."" 

Also guys that holler (not holla) at me like I am cattle. excuse that is not going to get me to come over to where you are to hear your lame ass pick up lines..

<lj-cut text="" this is so WRONG""><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""20""> <tbody><tr> <td align=""center""> <font size=""5""><b>Kermit the Frog</b></font><br> You scored 45% Organization, 41% abstract,  and 79% extroverted! </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <font size=""-2"">This test measured 3 variables. </font><p>
<font color=""red"">First, this test measured how <b>organized</b> you are.  Some muppets like Cookie Monster make big messes, while others like Bert are quite anal about things being clean. </font></p><p>
<font color=""blue"">Second, this test measured if you prefer a <b>concrete</b> or an <b>abstract</b> viewpoint.  For the purposes of this test, concrete people are considered to gravitate more to <i> mathematical and logical approaches</i>, whereas abstract people are more the <i> dreamers and artistic type.</i></font></p><p>
<font color=""green"">Third, this test measured if you are more of an <b>introvert</b> or an <b>extrovert.</b>
By definition, an introvert concentrates more on herself and an
extrovert focuses more on others. In this test an introvert was
somebody that either tends to spend more time alone or thinks more
about herself. </font></p><p>
You are <b>mostly</b> organized, <b>both </b>concrete and abstract, and <b>more </b>extroverted.</p><p>

Here is why are you Kermit the Frog.</p><p>
<font color=""purple"">You are both somewhat organized. You have a good
idea where you put things and you probably keep your place reasonably
clean. You aren't totally obsessed with neatness though. Kermit is also
reasonably tidy. He'll even dress up for interviews. <br><br>
You both are sometimes concrete and sometimes abstract thinkers. Kermit
spends a lot of his time as a reporter collecting facts, but he is also
the author of the dreamy song ""The Rainbow Connection."" You have a good
balance in your life. You know when to be logical at times, but you
also aren't afraid to explore your dreams and desires... within limits
of course.<br><br>
You are both extroverts. Kermit gets along with everyone. Sure a few
folks annoy him, but that's just because they are annoying. Kermit
likes to meet new people when he does his job as a street reporter. You
definitely enjoy the company of others, and you don't have problems
meeting new people... in fact you probably look forward to it. You are
willing to take charge when necessary or work as part of a team.</font></p><p>
<font color=""purple"">  Oh, and in case you were wondering, Kermit starred on Sesame Street years before The Muppet Show.</font></p><p></p><p>
The other possible characters are<br><b>
<font color=""brown"">Oscar the Grouch<br>
Big Bird<br>
Snuffleupagus<br>
Ernie<br>
Elmo<br>
Cookie Monster<br>
Grover<br>
The Count<br>
Guy Smiley<br>
Bert
</font></b>
</p><p>
If you enjoyed this test, I would love the feedback! Also if you want
to tell me your favorite Sesame Street character, I can total them up
and post them here. Perhaps your choice will win! </p></td> </tr> <tr> <td align=""center""> <img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/users/168/570/16957172787179881552/mt1130108378.jpg""> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br><br><br> <table cellpadding=""20""> <tbody><tr> <td> <span id=""comparisonarea"">My test tracked 3 variables How you compared to other people <i>your age and gender</i>:<blockquote><table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""4""><tbody><tr><td valign=""middle""><table bgcolor=""black"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""1""><tbody><tr><td bgcolor=""#b2cfff"" height=""20"" width=""36""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td><td bgcolor=""white"" width=""114""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign=""middle"">You scored higher than <b>24%</b> on <b>Organization</b></td></tr><tr><td valign=""middle""><table bgcolor=""black"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""1""><tbody><tr><td bgcolor=""#b2cfff"" height=""20"" width=""32""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td><td bgcolor=""white"" width=""118""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign=""middle"">You scored higher than <b>21%</b> on <b>concrete-abstra</b></td></tr><tr><td valign=""middle""><table bgcolor=""black"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""1""><tbody><tr><td bgcolor=""#b2cfff"" height=""20"" width=""137""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td><td bgcolor=""white"" width=""13""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is2.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign=""middle"">You scored higher than <b>91%</b> on <b>intro-extrovert</b></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote></span> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <table cellpadding=20><tr><td>Link: <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=4525550649363613939'>The Your SESAME STREET Persona Test</a> written by <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid=16957172787179881552'>greencowsgomoo</a> on <a  href='http://www.okcupid.com'>Ok Cupid</a>, home of the <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/oktest3'>32-Type Dating Test</a></td></tr></table>"

<br>
I am actually once again looking forward to going ot american history..
All because of the hottie in the class.. I used to look forward to
history until I found out that a certain somebody has a girlfriend..
but then monday my interest in that class has to do with Mr. Hottie.
thats what I am calling him. <br>
<br>
School is going ok.. I don't really think I should have gone up to USM
but I am trying to make the best of it. I mean I've been in worser (if
thats even a word) schools to where I hated it so much.. But I
made&nbsp; few friends and had some fun atleast.. But I don't think you
can compare College and Public schools.. Its like comparing apples and
oranges.. I dunno.. thats all I can think of right now. <br>
<br>
I am studied out. MIDTERMS SUCK.. I was mad about my Nonwestern history
exam when I studied for hours and then it was a take home. After we
spent the hour in the class writing in those blue books. Which I think
for the final in that class I am gonna be safe and bring two of the
blue books.. just in case.. <br>
<br>
I think I got about a C+ on my philosophy exam.. well&nbsp; atleast C-&nbsp; on it. <br>
<br>
I love my computer.. I can listen to music while I do my work. I have a
lot of CDs but not the ones with like my uber fave songs like: 45, and
losing my religion. <br>
<br>
I am dreading actually going to Non west cause of Justin.. That dude
makes me feel uneasy. I mean ok I used to like him before he reminded
me of someone.. But when he started reminding me of that person I was like OH
HELL NAW. 
My feet are so cold. I really wished the people in charge in the dorm
would turn on the heat. Atleast to where it wasn't like really hot but
warm. <br>

midterm. which is good and brought my grade up a lil bit.. All I need
is a c to pass this class but I need like a 2.6 to get into the
teaching program. I might take a year off or something soon. because my
mom was talking about her transfer going though.. <br>

spanish
is frusterating instead of saying Se (sa) I said Si (see) and the girl
next to me said its sa. I was like F""K you and the funny thing was my

<br>
Justin
has staring problems. Or atleast he had fun watching me squirm in my
chair as he was looking at me for the first 3 mins before class even
started. I finally just put my right hand over my face so I wouldn't
see him at all (he sits on my right) then I was so thankful that
someone walked in the door and directed his attention else where.<br>
<br>
I
feel like I am in a funk thats hard to get out of. I need more of a
break from school then jsut the weekends.. It really sucks that fall
break was taken away. Something my roommate always bitches about but
she has a 3 day weekend every week cause she doesn't have a class on
friday.<br>
<br>
The subject is about the fact I miss Eddie L. Yea for all the people
from Clovis NM,&nbsp; I will finally admitt I liked him LOL. I dunno I
given up on all guys that remind me of Eddie..  The sad part I always say that and it never happens. I
think I am slowly changing from what I was like in high school to now..
I am getting more out of my comfort zone. I hate it a lot but it works.
I know I've changed a hell of a lot from 6th grade to now.. <br>
<br>
I miss Scott sometimes. and Phillip a lot.&nbsp; Scott is a great guy
but he probably has a girlfriend cause guys like him don't stay single
for long.. Phillip.. There isn't any way I can describe him cause there
are no words to express anything about him and it wouldn't do him
justice. <br>
<br>
Why I miss phillip a lot right now. A guy in my american history class
looks just like him except Phill is a small med build and this guy is a
med to large build.. Weird. I know its not phillip cause I never forget
a face.. I thought it was cute though I was looking down the hall and
then I would look across the hall (cause he was standing right in front
of me on the other side of the hall) and He would look somewhere else..
:) I feel like I am in high school all over again. <br>
<br>
I miss scotty cause I have no one to really pick on that will actually say stupid things back to me.. LOL. <br>

I honestly don't care because I don't want him. Plus it didn't hurt he was looking at me and I look uberly cute today in my green sweater from aeropostale (SP??), and my gorguis (SP) hip hugging blue jeans. LOL. I love playing hard to get sometimes when it comes to certain guys. Justin honestly isn't one of them at the current moment.. but the look on his face was priceless. almost like the deer in the headlights look he had friday. Oh by the way the best part of class is it was cancelled but we still had to turn in our papers to the dude that works in the office at the history department. 

The conversation I was having was about school and majors and feeling dumb every time I go to the history department. Also about people butchering the English Language. I can't stand it and it drives me up a wall. But I know I am not good at grammer and spelling. Also not good at typing. 

what else. If a GUY told you ""I like your purse"" what would you think?? Now take that statement and add BDUs.. Well a nice ass truck with like 3 guys in it drove pass me as I was walking from my dorm to class. This guy leans out the window says ""I like your purse"". Now me normally would say thanx. I did and smiled. But then the oddest thing hit me. No straight male has ever complemented me on my purse or fashion sence. So it kind of made me feel good. Like last tuesday a guy complemented me on my hoodie that is uber skaterish that my mom picked up for me cause of the awesome designs. Gay-dar went into effect at that time (i have nothing against gays.. if a gay guy complements me then I know I am doing something right.)."

<P>Teacher was talking about the football game in which tulsa won. I was like well I left way before the Half (i get in games free well i think I pay for it thru my tution i dunno). I was like well some drunk (bastard) kept hitting me in the back. so I moved. and the teacher was like well in elementry school it means he likes you. I was I wanted to slap him. But I moved then someone else started hitting me. Justin at this point, I could hear him laughing. So the teacher was like It was just a bad game for you. I said I was happy that USM lost. The teacher goes you have issues. I said nope. I hate this school and it wasn't my first choice. Justin got real quiet. LOL. </P>
<P><STRONG>I enjoy going to USM</STRONG> (don't get me wrong)&nbsp;but its like sometimes&nbsp; I hate it. One bad apple doesn't spoil the whole bunch but to me it makes the school look a lot worse and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. </P>
<P>In fact speaking of the problem I've been having. It started up last night Right on Time. 11:45 pm. I got up and left went and watched Fox news.. there was nothing else on tv (also I was in the lounge). </P>
<P>I saw Tan (first floor North RA) I had to tell her I was sorry for being rude to her last week (well more like last wednesday). She said thats ok. and asked whats wrong I told her about my problem but replied I already spoke to Rita about it and I hope it gets settled soon. Tan then said I could go visit her in her room to get out of mine. I told her that I go to people's rooms or hang out in the lounge until bed time and then go in my room to sleep. She was like Oh ok. Tan's cool, I jsut don't want to be on her bad side. Besides Rita and selina, I get along with tan.. </P>
<P>The other RA's are cool I just don't talk to them as much. Or i don't see them as much.. </P>

<P>I&nbsp;am gonna start working out with Megan (MJ), she heather's roommate. I told her I would work out with her&nbsp;and when she goes jsut to knock on my door. This was when she was talking about working out with someone. </P>"

"event","I have to wait about a week or so on my lap top. but I did get some awesome jeans and Cds along with food (fruits yogert, tv dinners, hot pockets, oatmeal, grits) and dvds.. Watching finding neverland tomorrow. 

I left close to half time cause I got sick of being beat with those damn thundersticks that get handed out by Forest general hospital @ every game. 
The first time the drunken idoit behind me kept hitting me with them. the first was in the back of the head so I moved my hand to touch where he hit and he goes ""i'm sorry"" I was like ok. but I didn't turn around because a player for tulsa had a nice ass.. :). SO he lended into my ear and was like ""i'm sorry for hitting you in the head"" then he hit me again in the back around the rib cage area. and then again. so I got up moved to the bleacher below me. The girl in front of me turns around and was like you know its broken. I said well better then getting beat about the body like a pina (SP). she was like yea you have to sit lower cause their nothing but drunks up there. How i knew he was drunk (the guy that was hitting me) not only could I smell it on him but just the way he was acting. 

I got back to my dorm heated me up a hot pocket and got a coke. Watched the vin diesle movie where he is like a babysitter.. ITS SO CUTE.. and watched bits and pieces of the longest yard. gonna watch finding neverland tomorrow or thursday.."

"event","Lizzi and I, last night were going to the 3rd floor (around 10:30-11 pm) we took the elevator. There was another girl there and we were talking about wearing heels cause her shoes were so cute (high heels). Well She got off on the 2nd floor and I hit the 3rd floor button the elevator moved and we went down to the first. as we were climbing the stairs to the 3rd floor we were doubled over in laughter. It was so funny. She told me ""we will not  tell anyone about this.""

"event","How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it
How do I deal with 
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career
I gotta take it though it's heartbreakin'
It's something that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live...how do I deal without you"

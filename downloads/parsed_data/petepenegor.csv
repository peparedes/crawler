"event","so yeah an i come back from oshkosh after working 73 hrs this week and i have to go back up in an hour with some mexicans that are picking me up at my house.  4 of us are gonna be up there for a week during the EAA festival driving around looking to see if tents are in good condition, plus we drink (it's company policy).  the girls that tend to the flowers are hot, ima try to get their numbers and what not...

if you guys wanna come up to it we can hang out while i'm working and drink, you can even spend the night in our trailer, there's plenty of beds, like 14 and theres only 3 people staying there cause the other guy lives in oshkosh.  the event starts monday till the 31st i think.  call me

"event","what is up?

it shows that i dont update this thing much but i'm trying you slut.

so this week and the next i will be in Oshkosh setting up for the EAA plane show.  we set up like 300 tents which is lame.  i'll prolly be up there with a bunch of mexicans too, who lack the ability to speak english.  it should be a kicking ill time.  i want to go to the actual event this year becasue it seems like it would be interesting with all the shit they have.  so if anyone would be interested in goin get in contact with me, otherwise just feign interest.
<img src=http://www.airventure.org/2005/about/images/sport_pilot_tent.jpg>

this weekend should be fun though since i'm goin to chicago for the intonation music festival (www.intonationmusicfest.com) with nate, greg, and kelly.  maybe even nas who is gonna be in milwaukee friday night, but we'll see.  i have yet to order the tickets but i'll soon get on that, along with your mom.

what am i reading you ask? well, its a book called The Right Stuff, by Tom Wolfe.  my bro got it for my b-day, it's about the first astronauts and everything they had to go through.  conveniently it's appropriate for me, it seems solid.

i must go since shamoon is coming over to ""chill poolside"", that's code for dirty hot sex poolside, i think, but in any case i gotta be prepared.
does anyone actually read this?"

I went to the Umphrey's show last night, it was good until I got super sick and puked during the 2nd set.  I didn't even drink or anything, I think it was because the only thing I had to eat that day was a brat at the game.  I then proceeded to have skittles, a bag of potato chips, and a pepsi at the show."

"event","Monday through Wednesday I was up in Oshkosh working at the fly-in.  Same old same old there.  Thursday I worked half a day then my parents picked me up so we could drive up north for the Penegor Family Reunion, which takes place every 5 years.  I wasn't at the last one because I was in Australia, so I hardly new anyone.  There were a bunch of cousins my age that I hung out with which was pretty cool.  We stayed in Ontanagon, the town my dad grew up in, at his old house.  Thursday night I did nothing after we arrived, except view Unforgiven, one of the top westerns out there.  Friday was the big ass golf outing with like 100 people.  It was a scramble.  We ended up 3 under and there was a tie for first at 5 under.  They had to go to extra holes to determine the winner.  After that I went to a cottage down the street that some of my cousins were staying at, they had a keg...I got smashed, and I smoked a bowl with some of my cousins.  The next day my brother Joel, his wife Carolyn, and I took our boat out on the river and then out into lake Superior.  It was nice and relaxing.  Later that day was the big ass dinner.  I had the prime rib.  It was exquisite minus the fact most of it was fat.  At dinner people told stories of family and such.  After dinner my parents left because I was the designated driver for my bro and his wife because our house was an hour drive from where dinner was.  We went out to this bar where most of the rest of the family was.  I got kicked out since i'm not 21 and don't have a fake.  We couldn't really do anything else since I was the dd for them, so we walked back the the car and the battery was dead.  Apparemtly my bro came out to get his cigs before dinner and left the keys in the ignition.  So with that we decided we were gonna just stay at the hotel the dinner was at with everyone else.  My brother and sister-in-law went back to the bar and I went up to a hotel room with a bunch of my cousins who couldn't get into the bar either.  We drank some brewskies, smoked together again, and then played some cards.  I got to bed on the floor of a hotel room at like 4:30.  It was a great family fun filled night.  The next day was the picnic and family pictures.  We had some sweet pasties and what not.  There was another keg there but I really didn't drink any.  My cousins and I played some volleyball and then we(my parents and I) had to shove off.  It was a kick ass time, I never new how much the rest of my family rocks.

"event","Just got back from another sweet week in Oshkosh for the EAA dealie.  It was freaking hot the entire time and I now have an exquisite farmers tan.  I drank like 6 bottles of corona with my mexi friends while watching the Mexican soccer team in the copa americana.  They also introduced me to some stellar mexican rap, including Dae-p and the Dyablos.  We went to taco bell later and one of them asked me to ask this white girl for her phone number (since he doesn't speak hardly any english) which I did.  She turned out to be 16, he's like 23.  The mexis have all jumped on the bandwagon of calling me by my nickname, cunado (with a tilde on the n).  The started calling me this after they found out I have 2 sisters.  It means brother-in-law, because they act like they are gonna marry my sisters.  The EAA grounds are pretty big so we have to drive around in different Karl's party rental vehicles.  I was driving this pick-up truck and I floored it right before this small hill.  It was so sweet, I got a second or two of full on airtime.  

In other news, my new computer for college came while I was gone.  I'm pumped to set it up."

<P>The work hasn't been too bad, a lot of screwing around.&nbsp; The grounds are pretty huge so we are usually driving from one end to the other tearing it up on the gravel paths doing donuts and what not.&nbsp; One guy had those little 1 shot bottles of vodka and was mixing them in his orange juice while he was working.&nbsp; He also snorted some coke or some shit before we went out one night and was super geeked out.&nbsp; The last day he even made pot brownies.&nbsp; There are guys that work for use temporarily, or a temp, and we figured one of em smoked a few bowls during lunch.&nbsp; He was acting real crazy and asked me for some soda because he had cottonmouth.&nbsp; He was a little bitch because he didn't do anywork and had to leave early because apparently some mechanic put oil in his window washer container. &nbsp;Another guy whose one of the more important workers because of his knowledge of clearspan tents bought a whole bunch of fireworks before he got up.&nbsp; He was lighting em off while we were working all the time.&nbsp; He even shot this rocket thing at the site manager.&nbsp; This job has its benefits for me, not only in pay.&nbsp; It's good physical activity and also since there are so many non english speaking mexicans that work there I get to practice my spanish all the time.&nbsp; Theres like 300 tents that have to be put up and i'm going back next week, monday to friday, to continue the project.&nbsp; </P>

"event","Last night was pretty crazy seeing Crosby, Stills, and Nash while it was pouring rain.  I got my admission ticket from a sweet scalper for only $5.  It rained basically non-stop from the moment we stepped off the bus to go to the show till I arrived home.  I was so soaked.  My Sauza kept me warm though.

"event","I thought Talib Kweli preformed well, but the show was way too short.  It was only one hour.  The other thing that pissed me off was at one point in the show Talib asked for people to come up on stage that knew how to break dance and what not, a bunch of people went up and did ok.  But then it somehow turned into all these white guys dancing real bad and flashing ""gang"" signs to the audience.

When we were walking thought the crowds jared found one of those little flashing lights that you'd expect to see at raves.  He would go up to people a flash it at them and make some face.  I loved how the only reaction he provoked in guys was an aggressive tone and the guy acting like he wanted to fight.  One young gentleman replied ""Keep looking, ya fucking faggot!""  Wow, how classy."

Speaking of concerts the Beastie Boys will hopefully be touring soon.  The tour has been delayed since Mike D. had a baby.

Just found out today at work the next week I will be going up to the EAA place to put up tents.  The thing is we are gonna be staying over night monday through friday and going to be paid to sleep there.  I'm going to be bringing in the big bucks."

just got back from New York as well, and it was loads of fun.  I went with my parents to see my sister whose living there now.  My sister and I also went to the Dysfunctional Family Picnic concert, it was amazing...the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Brand New, Cypress Hill, The Darkness, The Beastie Boys, and the Strokes.  The Beasie boys were awesome, and after their set, one of the announcers (the black lady from the howard stern show) said that they had a special guest for us.  This guy came out with his hat real low and no one knew who it was.  The crowd went wild when he raised his head and everyone realized it was Jay-Z.

My flight to new york was canceled.  So i'm here for the night and have to get up at 3:30 in the morning to get on the next flight in.  Apparently there are thunder storms in NY and they can't land?

In other news, i'm remaking the BC Pictures site because I just bought the domain bcpictures04.com, it should be up soon.  After that I will be able to add tons of pictures, never go over the bandwidth limit, and have no ads pop up.

I worked from 7 to 430.  Most of the time I was packed with some mexicans in a truck driving to madison and back.  We put up a 100 by 40 foot tent for these guys who worked for some beer distribution company that was handing out steel reserve.

"event","Just got home from a sweet 12 hour shift at Karl's Party Rental where I work.  I was scheduled from 8-4 but somehow got dragged into 4 more hours.  It was good though, this lady forked over $100 to me and this guy Israel for putting up two tents that she was supposed to for this church event.  Plus all the other stops we had to make were real simple.  

We had some interesting conversations about different things, like how his brother sometimes hits his girlfriend and another time when the girl was mad at his brother so she told her mom that she gives him head all the time.  Seems like a nice family to me.  

He also told me this story of how about 7 guys worked at Karl's for about a week or two and then they all just didn't show up one day.  Apparently they just worked to make enough money to go to a Phish concert and when someone called them to find out what happened, they basically said that they were rich and didn't need to work.

And another time this guy took a truck to set up a bunch of tents or drop some shit off.  He told the people they had to pay cash and then just booked it out of town.

Izzy's 100% mexican, but I was lucky since he's the only one there that speaks fluent english"

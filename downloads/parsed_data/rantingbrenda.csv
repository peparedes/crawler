"event","- List 10 things you want to say to people but you know you never will.
- Don't say who they are or who you're referring to.
- Never discuss it again.
- Tag 5 people to do the same.

1. You're my best friend but you annoy me so much sometimes and sometimes I feel like you don't let me ""grow""
2. In no way are you attractive or hott, get over yourself
3. I'm glad she treated you shitty because you deserve it
4. I've had a crush on you for such a long time now but I don't think you like girls, not in a gay way, but you just don't like girls. or maybe just me.
5. You may be jacked but you have a receding hairline. ouch.
6. I wish you weren't so fucking creepy
7. I will never like you, so stop trying so much
8. I really want to kiss you everytime I see you
9. I'll probably never get over you, and the sad thing is that you're not worth my time. 
10. Just make a move because I know you want to"

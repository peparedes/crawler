and today- celebrating the last day of Christine being 16, me her n downie got in some crazy water fight. rolled around in the grass you know how that goes. then we got us some 20 minute workout lol anyways..

i realized- that i'm so lonely =[ it's so important to have people that care about you, if you didn't.. i think it'd be really hard to live. that's just me of course- i had a little nervous breakdown.. these past couple of days have been some serious <b>unneeded drama</b> ((if YOU know what i mean)) oooooh well. i guess i'm kinda at that point where i'm ready to be with someone again- i don't like being <i><b>alone</i></b>.. it's, boring.

"event","so i guesssss i'll update since everyone is telling me to..

my trip to Europe was pretty cool. we flew into Switzerland and drove to Paris. the first gas station we stopped at was basically my first traumatizing moment (sp?).. i couldnt figure out how to open the doors (these were some serious European doors) so i just kinda stood there and some local just gave me this look like i was an idiot. finally i figured it out and walked over to the bathrooms, and into the one that i thought was the womens. so i go in and open up the stall door and there is a fuckin hole in the ground. and im like hmmmm, i dont know how to do this and i dont really feel like peeing on myself so ill just wait for another bathroom. so i walk out of the stall and their is two little boys in there, so now im assuming i walked into the mens but i really had no idea. so i leave the bathroom and there is the same man as before looking at me like im a fool as i try to figure out how to get out of the damn gas station. it was pretty embarrassing. alright so we drove to paris, and to be honest it wasnt anything too exciting. went to the eiffel tower and the arc de triumphe and le louvre, all the big things, walked down the champs de lysses or however the hell you spell it, its like the main strip. i dont know its basically what you would think it would be .. then we went to strausburg,france.. which was just a little town and it had this freakin HUGE cathedral that was built in like the 1200's .. then we went to dachau which is the first concentration camp ever. they had like 22 barracks.. and each one is about the size of two portables. now put all of palm bay high into those two portables. thats how many people they put in each barrack it was pretty sick. then we drove to this walled city called rothenburg, its like something disney would recreate. imagine living in a town where you cant get in unless guards let you, it was crazy. but its easy to communicate in germany cuz basically everyone can speak english. o ya that brings me to my next embarrassing story. ok so all the country's over there are little like states, but as soon as you cross the border everything changes to the next language. you could have one gas station in france thats in french and one 5 feet away but if its in germany everything is in german. so we go into this german gas station, and i know.. NO german, i mean none. so my grandma calls me out and points to a sign that has the little restroom symbol on it and the word ""HYFERSHNOOGIN"" next to it. so of course we assume that means restroom. so we walk in a look at the chik workin there and my grandma says the word and we both just bust out laughing and this girl gives us the most blank stare like we were crazy and is like ""do you need to know where the bathroom is"" in perfect english. i was like niiiice. so you at least those bathrooms were real toilets. so then we went to salzburg, austria where mozart grew up. it was a cool city we ate at a restaurant that was the oldest in europe, it opened in 900. then we went to Venice, Italy and everything there is so... dirty. its the place where you cant have any cars and their is water going through the buildings and stuff. their is all these little boats that italian dudes row people around in. it was really neat but since all the buildings are so close together things get kinda dirty and their is nats and stuff and it was just kinda aggravating. plus at this point in the trip i was really missing my american food and language. the next day in venice i got soooo sick and was throwing up and like couldnt move so i stayed in bed all day. the next day my dad lost the freakin keys to the car so it was like a 5 hour procedure to get a new car. that basically ruined the whole day but we drove to Cinque Terre.. the Italian Riviera. it was really nice it was like mountains right on the water and 5 different cities that you could walk to our take a big boat to. i didnt get to see much of that place because i got sick again the day we were gonna go out and ended up going to bed at 5 that night. the next day we just drove back to switzerland where our flight was gonna be the next morning and i just stayed in the hotel room. i was living off ritz crackers and coke for 3 days so i wasnt really in the mood to explore europe anymore. i always wondered what it was like to live over there and if they had wal-marts and chain restaurants like us and i found out that it is completely different over there. they have this one fast food thing called ""autogrill"" on the side of the highways and McDonalds, but thats about the only fast food i really saw. most restaurants are just random places without much selection. and i only saw one wal-mart. lol.. going over there i realized i need a modern town. everything in europe is sooo old and old buildings here and some history there and its just completely different than america.

wow that was long and probably really boring to read but im so not in the mood to go into detail about my trip. thats why i havent updated, i was waiting for a time where i really wanted to explain it but that time never came along.


i decided, i love palm bay.

i dont talk to anyone anymore.. just, my little crew. it's quite, odd. but i like it. i hope summer gets a bit more exciting.  <3"

so at state on friday.. everyone got straight excellents except for women's and men's ensemble (chamber choir ensembles) we got superiors.. which was kinda, weird. mrs.albright said she didn't care about the ratings because those were the best performances she's seen in the past 3 years. she said they were definitely superior to her, and to me thats all that really matters. wow for pride, they put us in a room that had like, stairs and different shaped platforms and all this crap, so we couldnt even use our own platforms. it sucked, why would you put a show choir in a room that has an uneven floor? but we managed to squeeze into this little area in the back of the room that had three levels.. so we just did it there. and out of 70 schools in special category, only 7 got superior.. so they stepped it up a lot. but whatever.. the whole day was just- weird. last year was a lot better i thought, the auditorium here was half the size of palm bays! i was like wow.. and especially compared to UF's last year, it sucked badly. but oh well, at least ryan wasnt puking this time :) haha. la di da.

anyways


another concert gone unnoticed.. i don't think anyone understands what music means to me. it's honestly all i have, i mean.. everyone at some point in life has a passion for something, and i've already found mine. and i NEVER sing for anybody- and i finally got myself a solo that was apparantly fit for my voice, but.. of course nobody cared to come see. at least my family is always there for me. it's not just a stupid high school chorus concert to me.. it's something i put effort into ever day im at school, i dont think i could go a day without having my two chorus classes.. something about music and the voices of everyone coming together that seriously eases me of every hard thing im going through.. but then when its over, and noone was there, i just feel worse. oh well..
state competition tomorrow for chorus. i love seeing mrs.albright smile. i love being the best and making her proud.

i freakin love singing."

i'm sick of feeling like this. my mind changes every two minutes. i'm always sure of one thing- and that's you. but everything dealing with that, confuses the hell out of me. it's obvious what i want, and it's obvious what i won't get.. right now. so why do i have to worry about it so much when i know eventually i'll be happy? why do i <b>need</b> to have someone else in my life to make me smile? i don't choose to be like this, and if i had the choice believe me i'd be a lot more happy when things weren't going exactly as planned.. but sometimes we don't have control over the things we want to. sometimes you just have to deal with what you're given. i know life could obviously get a lot worse but i have a lot of stress that.. nobody understands. i know it may seem like i throw a pity party for myself everytime i write in this damn thing but 1. that's why i made it, and 2. i usually only concentrate on the social part of life thats bringing me down, god knows how many other things are going on in my life that stress me out but - this isnt a pity party - i'm like the fuckin boy who cried wolf ""goodnight"".. lol, <i>you</i> know what i mean. has anybody seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? somebody hurry and invent the technology to erase memory of certain people/things.. i would be so much better off.. maybe i wouldn't be so doubtful in myself and anything that wants anything to do with me. maybe i wouldn't question every thing somebody says to me. do i really make myself look that confident? i must be good at fooling all of you, if that's what you think. there's so much more....   and does it really make me feel better to get all of this off my chest? or worse to realize, why i'm not smiling..

to niv's house, we didnt go.  who wants 4 day old cookies anyways? sorry Joe. lol

another night of, nothing. o well. i really had no desire to do anything and it seems like im always going out of my way to stay out of the ""party scene"" due mainly to one big problem. yea, you can figure that one out. sucks i have to give up my fun for all of you bastards. j/k.

this town really isnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be, i mean.. what else can you do than what we have to do here? my problem is always 1.money 2.lack of friends 3.too much drama   haha so sad

lately i've been so laid back with drama, i honestly dont care what anyone does anymore. i'm sick of talking shit about people and im sick of hating random people for no reason (and people doing the same back). im sick of stereotyping and judging. im so sick of everything. i just want to meet some new people and stop being so stuck in this boring life i have. grrr. 

i'm going to bed, or something.    goodnight </3

i laugh when i hear the stories.. :)

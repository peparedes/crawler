"event","where to begin, first this had been the most fucked up year of my life. ive lost loved ones, fallen far into a bad place. to top it off, i have nothing plesant so far and here we are nearing 2008. sometimes i guess when everything is down and out all you can hope for is more. &nbsp;well these past weeks have been an eye opener that not all in life is totally bad, its what you make of it. i have met a few new people and reconsiled with a few lost friends and have been feeling alot better in some ways. i remember myself now, and the person i once was, and thats the best feeling ever. how good it feels to be back. watch out world murphy will rise again!"

"event","There's this real goofy guy at work, Bob. He works kind of the night shift and has a reputation for just being strange. He sings and dances a lot. Makes dumb jokes like when I&nbsp;went out on the barge and asked him &quot;are we going yet?,&quot;&nbsp; he took off his hat and said &quot;going? no it's gone&quot; and rubbed his baldness.&nbsp; This morning in the course of conversation about the state of television he says almost out of the blue &quot;Every day I&nbsp;go home and for an hour I watch fox news and get indoctrinated. Just gotta get my hour of indoctrination.&quot; I thought &quot;Wow, so this weirdo hates fox news and is probably one of&nbsp; those serious union democrats. What a bad face for liberalism.&quot; But I didn't say anything about it. 

Later when we were tying up the barge back at the berth I asked him real cautious like I always am about politics at work: &quot;So you're happy about this whole health care thing?&quot;

 &quot;Happy?&nbsp;Hell I'm not happy. That's gonna cost this country a lot of money we don't have.&quot; I said I thought it would actually save money. He said &quot;I don't know believe that one.&quot; I said it was because it would put a new payroll tax on people making over&nbsp; 250,000.

 He said &quot;Well, that's gonna cost a lot of jobs. It's the people with money that create all the jobs.&quot; &nbsp;I gave him back something like&nbsp; &quot;well that's trickle-down theory but a lot of people believe it's the other way around. His reply:&nbsp;&quot;That's a fact. People with money create the jobs. I&nbsp;only deal with facts. Not opinions like that.&quot; I left it at that. I'm not sure if I regret not bothering to explain what indoctrination means. 

I don't believe Democrats will ever be able to pass something really difficult like climate-change legislation or single-payer healthcare, if they can't get the support of the people the party really helps, the lower and middle-class and the unions, and all the morons living off of unemployment at the tea party rallies and watching fox news. A little populism now and then wouldn't hurt."

The glossy covered creamy papered Edgar Allan Poe collection I&nbsp;read when I&nbsp;drove to North Carolina with my family in 7th grade&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; killing the cat was pretty disturbing then<br />3.

Up in the Old Hotel and Other Stories &nbsp; Joseph Mitchell&nbsp;&nbsp; best journalism/end of the world kind of nostalgia/NY&nbsp;book which also does more than due diligence on Staten Island<br />7.

"event","I feel as if I have been fucked by a god. My lips are tingling, my cheeks are flushed my nose is running, and I was so completely unaware and uncaring of how violently I was shoving food into my face that I discovered a whole new feeling in the joy of eating alone. I recommend the food at <em>Chavella's</em> on Classon as pretty much the best Mexican food to be had in this world or the next, or at least Brooklyn, specifically the potato &amp; chorizo taco and the chicken chipotle one. Please remember to put on the sauce as this makes all the difference. <br /><br />My Uncle Mark called me earlier today, drunk. It's what he does. Calls me up a little tipsy, sometimes so much as to be a little offensively dumb, other times -like today- just enough to make him voluble. I guess he's sort of a lonely guy. I'm sure he has friends but he doesn't have any kids so I think that puts a lot of extra time on his forty-something year old hands-as well as the hole my grandfather very visibly left in his life. But he does things. He said today he was trying to figure out why his tractor suddenly didn't want to go into reverse. I guess he was taking a break from working on it to call me. Anyway, he called up to ask if I had finished a book he gave me, <em>Grey Seas Under</em>, which is the story of a salvage tug in the mid-20th century that reads sort of like a badly put together series of newspaper articles with lots of meaningless names and dates.<br /><br />This brought him to talking about as he has told me more than a few times, the fact that him and his brother rebuilt the engine, drive-shaft, and all the accessory bearings and gears on a tugboat from the 1920s when they were kids. They did it for Jack Drury, whose family has been friends with mine since the 1940s, and owned a dairy equipment company and large industrial yard on the Kill Van Kull, and they were paid $1.25 an hour. &quot;Not much money, even then&quot; I&nbsp;said and he said &quot;Yeah, but we learned.&quot; And then he talked about kids these days. One facet of the &quot;kids these days&quot; um...discourse...is that they don't have any mechanical skills, which seems pretty valid to me. Not literally, but I think the gap between the regular college-educated person and a person who &quot;works with his hands&quot; is a lot wider than it used to be, because of specialization, the income gap, divergent technology and much else. It's something that bothers me a lot because I'm on one side of it and my family and co-workers are on the other. Not that I&nbsp;seem to them a clutz or a spazz or an total moron like some people. I can change my brake-pads or run a bobcat and I have some idea what journals and bearings are but I don't know what a crocus cloth is and I can't tell what my uncles are talking about when they get into an hour long debate about tractors. So it fascinates me and I&nbsp;do want to learn more. <br /><br />Today in the shower (of course) when thinking about what my uncle told me, I&nbsp;realized a good opportunity has come up. He and my uncle David spent a whole summer taking the bus across the island and then coming home covered in grease with towels wrapped like turbans around their heads. By an odd coincidence it&nbsp; was the same one my great-great grandfather, Emil, had worked on for over a decade as the engineer. The interesting thing I&nbsp;found out today is that Emil would not set foot on the thing. It can pay to hear the same story told over and over again. You think to ask different questions.He would tell my uncles stories like how he took down all the plumbing, wiring, gears and whatever else from the ceiling of the engine room and replaced it so that it was just one foot higher so that he didn't have to bend his head when walking around, and he would give advice, but he adamantly refused to go near it. Even when the boat was part of the regatta in New York Bay for the nation's bicentennial, he refused to go. My uncle just said &quot;You could never tell with those old-timers. Sometimes they worked for sixty years on the water and they never wanted to set foot on a boat again.&quot; It could make a good story with a little digging, and gives me a chance to learn about more what tugboats must have been like to work on when the work was a little more serious and dangerous.<br />"

The captain slams on the horn repeatedly, but one of the truck just backs up toward him.

Fuck you!&quot; The captain, who has a heavy New York accent, shouts &quot;Fuck you and fuck your mother!&quot; The driver, an Albanian, comes back &quot;Fuck your mother!&quot; The captain then tells him &quot;Fuck your mother again and go fuck a donkey and go back to your motherfucking country you fucking raghead&quot; and drives away.

"event","Haircut today. My beard is thinned down to almost nothing and my haircut is boyish and clean. The barber took liberties like always but I let him. It is me being a women in a novel, like what I was reading today in the diner, a feminist novel <em>Pig Tales</em>, which made me feel gross so I had to switch to my other new book. It felt good to cut my hair. To have my hair cut. Beards have pros and cons, sometimes they are the tangible evidence of sloth and filth and insecurity. Though mostly it is purely functional-my winter sweater. I wonder often about people's comments: &quot;Nice beard&quot; &quot;It suits you&quot; &quot;I wish I&nbsp;could grow one like that.&quot; Do you really think that much about beards? Do you want one that much? Beard is something to be grown between twenty-one and thirty.<br /><br />I&nbsp;bought a bunch of stocks recently and now have to check them incessantly. It is time for another internet fast. This technology is creeping forward too quickly recently. A bunch of people sitting around an apartment, it is only a matter of time before the laptop is taken out. How many iphones are whipped out in bars? Rising on par with the weather for conversation filler is the latest youtube phenomena. (I don't get the Christian Bale one. I have played through many sides but it is still weird and pointless. I&nbsp;prefer <em>Alabama Leprechaun </em>or <em>Otto the Cat</em> anyday. Guilty as charged.) It's all fine but I wonder if its penetration is too viral, too quick, too fast for the losses to be noticed. I think about the very deep loss of literacy and focus. Of course this is the story of the past century but we had that whole postmodern dash which in some ways acted against it. That was a constructive self-consciousness which is no longer active, shot itself in the foot. At least I think it did. But we must be always vigilant.<br /><br />Pop culture and the co-opting of it is sort of the answer but I am the least knowledgeable person in the world when it comes to this. I can't remember the words to any song-To <em>Happy Birthday.</em> I am a very blind man. It leaves me quiet at parties with geeks that I like.<br /><br />There is dangerously little breathing room between the baby-carriages and me. There is the mass of rich people in Park Slope who have slowly but surely taken over Prospect Heights and there is just the few blocks of Carribeans mixed with Yuppies between me and them. I felt this today when I&nbsp;was assaulted at the closest coffee shop to me by a number of small German-speaking children. Small children. My stop, Franklin Avenue, is the last for white people. It is embarassing. Segregation is rotten. <br /><br />Took the train to Bay Ridge because I was already drifting out into that part of Brooklyn to get my haircut. The black barbers in my neighborhood would surely make a disaster of my hair which is straight as spaghetti. One day I should try it for kicks. Southwest Brooklyn is nice. The idea of being in a corner, of it being a neighborhood with a more permanent family-centric feeling, and the lack of any dominant ethnic group or race. That place, at least, is not segregated. But there are no blacks, though many Arabs. Recently, I have consciously tried to lay off the driving and it pays off. To sit and read and stare at people and figure out what books they're reading themselves leaves me much calmer than driving down the same streets alone even if it takes much longer.<br /><br />I will take the bar of Norwegian chocolate I bought in Bay Ridge out of my jacket pocket and get a glass of milk and take myself to bed and finish reading <em>Kavalier and Clay</em>, which I&nbsp;got today at the library. It is so good and soothing because it is pure fun and well-written. I will do my best to wash away the chocolate with the milk but I&nbsp;will still go to sleep without brushing my teeth for once because today is the last day on earth. I go back to work tomorrow.<br />"

I had eggs with peas this morning. Good idea.

Edit: This means a non-dry omelette sprinkled with peas just before the last drops of good solidify. Peas are my long secret love. They have been hidden, even from me. I have strong memories of eating peas as a child, lovely peas, very sweet.

My grandmother told me a story about peas recently. She said there was a girl in her elementary school that nobody liked very much, though nobody disliked her much either. She would sit on her porch and when my grandmother passed by she would say ""Would you like to come and share some peas with me?"" And she would open a can of peas and heat them up and they would share some peas.

Finally, yesterday, after four months, they got back to me about my license renewal (school actually started in September...) only to inform me that they had lost the documents I sent them. 

Apparently, the teacher who I filled in for for a semester at Tottenville High School shot her husband in his sleep. This, kids, is why its bad to be a teacher or a policeman (he was) in NYC. It drives you insane. I never her met her except in a sex dream in which I reluctantly made love to her obese self in a restored Federalist wooden boat.

Speaking of those boat things, I now work on the <i>Scotia Sea</i>, out of Philadelphia.  It is probably the easiest job in the world. I work a week on (living on the boat) and a week off. My principle challenge is not watching too many bad DVDs, as we do an average of two to three hours work per day (whilst I am still getting paid for twelve hours). Mostly we bring oil and ship's stores out to foreign freighters. Sometimes we take their crews ashore. The company is an odd place because they were bought by the largest marine transportation company in the country and soon after that all the rivals of this larger company stopped doing business with its (now) subsidiary. On the bright side, I will eventually transfer to New York Harbor (ancestral homeland, higher pay, busier), and/or Alaska or Seattle. 

I had originally worked in New York for the same company my great-grandfather and grandfather worked for, Great Lakes Dredge and Dock. It was dirty and I was constantly  being woken up off-shift to go out on deck and be dirty. I made hella money because of over-time but the chief delight was the other deckhand, who I worked closely with. He had two cell phones. One for his personal use, and one for the <i>police</i>! He told me some great stories about going to jail-yes, child-rapists, even if they are 6'6"" Hells Angels will be made to cry, have their clothes burned, etc, if they go to prison, marriage-he once burned all his wifes clothes in his fireplace which caused a ten foot high flame to shoot out the top and required the fire department to fill his living room with water, ash, and half-burn clothing, and how to treat ""foreigners""-he had endless stories about his relationship with Slobodan Peepovitch, a dumb Croatian who he apparently convinced the Washington  Monument was known as ""Genocide Park,"" and was a tribute to John Wayne.  The captain was also a sweet guy from Port Richmond with the heaviest New York accent I've ever heard not from a guido. He would wake up everyday and growl about his coffee and ask me questions about teaching and then growl some more in commisseration. Somehow, he knew my great-grandfather and said he was ""a nice guy."" He remembered the boat he had worked on.

Just so you know that Staten Island is not composed solely of guidos. This

Italo Calvino (<i>If On A Winter's Night A Traveler...</i>)
J.G. Ballard (""Concentration City"")
conversations with Tom Matthew about dystopian technological future,
<i>The 400 Blows</i> (platonic love, hands)
unlistened to voicemail from Steve

I asked Steve, the police officer, ""Is the city fully...besieged?"" I had to think about the word besieged before I used it. It was difficult to accept that it was the correct one.

""-Yes, there's no safe way out now."" 

I left him and wandered across the city to one of the defensive walls. Just piles of things and dirt stuffed between and on top of houses, thirty or forty feet high. It was a very large city. From the wall I could see far across it and it looked domestic and defenseless, familiar houses and buildings; garbage was uncollected and seemed to be discoloring what seemed so normal to me. Small groups of people milled pointlessly in the streets where there were very few cars. 

Tom Bonelli came clambering down from the wall. We had a conversation which I can't remember. I wandered away again, alone.

I found Tom Matthew and James. We walked slowly and talked quietly with lots of silence. I told them we could not get out of the city anymore. That we would probably get caught if we tried. They were non-plussed. They seemed to have accepted this already. 

""But"" I said, ""Bonelli has something that is worth getting out of the city."" 

   ""-What is that?"" 

""Some kind of engineer's documents."" 

I immediately regretted telling him what Bonelli had because I realized they would torture him if he were caught, and make him tell. I should have told him as little as possible. 

""We should try and get out in the middle of the battle."" 

Tom walked beside me. I looked over and I saw that I was holding his hand. I was surprised that we were holding hands but I realized that it made sense considering all that was happening. I looked up at him and smiled, amused that what I was about to say was true.

"event","I just watched ""Communion"" with my sister. It is pretty ridiculous. Christopher Walken is Whitley Streiber, the abductee. At the climax of the movie, he dresses up in a black suit with a funny hat and goes to see them. They dance for him, give him high-fives and then explain how he is a chosen one. I still have residual xenophobia when I'm in the deep dark night but I was absolutely non-plussed by the movie. Then I went on a communion website and read this little exchange:

<i>Interviewer: The assumption that the visitors are ""lifting"" cigarettes doesn't imply that they're taking anything else, like food. In my opinion, their apparent activities are staged for the benefit of the witness. It's likely that their seeming preoccupation with earthly fixations is projected, and might not even have anything to do with material objects, per se. I think more in terms of holograms or induced perceptions. 

Whitley Streiber: I halfway suspect that they smoke. I've gotten dozens of letters from people who smell cigarette smoke when they are around. If they do smoke, it is going to freak a lot of people out totally, including me. Can you imagine finally getting to go to the mothership and discovering that the place is full of cigarette smoke? That they smoke like coneheads and they don't care about cancer? It's a nightmare, I must admit. And surely only that! </i>

I thought this was hilarious. Aliens stealing cigarettes! Then I remembered this weird experience I had where I drove down a deserted road in the middle of the woods recently and smoked a cigarette. I was kinda freaked out because it was pitch black and I felt sort of vulnerable with the window open. In the car, I started writing a story about an alien who comes out of the darkness, takes my cigarette, smokes it and leaves. I remember it as being very vivid and I liked it. Though I didn't get to finish it because I was creeped out. I looked at it later and thought ""why the hell would I write a story about an alien smoking a cigarette? why would I think that a ridiculous idea like that would work?"" I was temporarily chilled by this coincidence, and again a few minutes ago when the dvd player went on screensaver mode and turned the room black, but now I am ok."

I will be sticking around here until she's better. My mom is frazzled because...her father died of complications from an intestinal surgery just recently. But I'm sure she will be fine because she's eighteen, and healthy (yeah, my sister, not my mother). My brother is incommunicado for two weeks for his ""indoctrination"" to the maritime academy. He will be the only person I know whose college experience consists of waking up four days a week to be in his uniform in formation at seven a.m.

I had a dream last night that I was with a girl I used to date. She no longer speaks to me. That's what you get for trying to bribe a girl to your apartment with a bottle of Jameson. Even if they are alcoholics. And you were trying to make up for something you said about their eating disorder. And you wanted to show her your dog. Because she likes dogs. 

We were with and her bandmates. We were in their apartment and we had a sort of fun wrestling match, her and I. I think she won. Then something happened that everyone liked me. A sort of universal revelation/validation. I don't remember what it was, of course, but it was something creative. Then I noticed that she had a cage with a harris hawk in it-I don't know why it was a harris hawk but it was (or at least I called it that-on looking at pictures, it appears to have been either a kestral of some kind or a peregrine falcon)-and the cage was too short so the hawk was on its side. Then there was a rabbit in the cage and the hawk and the rabbit were fighting. It was brutal with the rabbit having the hawk's head in its mouth and the hawk scraping and clawing the rabbit's face. I thought we should stop them, but she said she wanted them to be friends. 

On waking up, I e-mailed her the dream with the additional comment ""I thought you might want to know what my subconscious thinks of you."" Then I went back to sleep. I intended it to be amusing but I think maybe I've inadvertantly insulted her yet again. I don't really care and am surprised that I dreamt about her but still, I hate to keep insulting people unnecessarily. 

And yes my dreams are always pretty straight symbolic stories. I'm an open book to myself, evidently, and with a flair for fairy tale narratives.

I hope I like this boat thing. Its what my father does and nearly every male member of my family on both sides. My dad's dad was a lighthouse keeper, etc. while in the Coast Guard. His dad was a rum-runner during prohibition. Most likely, his ""family"" moved from Maryland to Staten Island in the 1800s as a result of being in the oyster trade.

My mom's dad did not like working on the ocean because he missed his dad a lot while he was a kid but he tried it out for a while and owned sailboats throughout his life. His father was an engineer on a boat-fulfilling the stereotype that all Norwegians are carpenters or sailors (is there something I'm missing?). When I went to Norway last month with my grandmother and uncle and cousin, we would introduce ourselves, to people who did not know us, first by saying we were relatives of Ule Sigvartsen. Him, they wouldn't know. We would have to call him by his nickname: Ule ""Storm"" and then they would understand. He got the name from his reputation for going out fishing in the middle of storms that would keep the other fisherman holed up in the fjiord. And everyone we met was either a carpenter or a fisherman-the older folk that is.

Genetics and family history is bullshit but there is something mystical about following footsteps that go so far back. Something unfamiliar to every other aspect of life. The irrational nature is probably the main feature of it. And traditions should only be thrown away with care. I am practicing my knots.

I am usually woken up by my dog, Clio, who wants me to take her for a walk. She will stand by the bed and bark. Then I'll look at her, half-asleep and cranky. She'll stare at me. I'll say ""Go away"" or ""Later"" and she'll stare. I close my eyes and go back to sleep. She'll leave and then come back again later and try more insistently. She'll bark and stare me down and I'll tell her to leave, but then she'll just stare harder and either emit an unearthly high-pitched groan in which she doesn't open her mouth, or sneeze nervously. Occasionally I'll placate her by letting her sleep at the foot of the bed, but she'll always wake me up again later, standing in the same spot, staring. 

But it gets me out of bed.

I drag a bathrobe and slippers or yesterday's clothes on, depending on my ambition, and walk her in the garden or behind the neighbor's house.

Then I come back and eat a small breakfast and begin reading and procrastinating work. People call and then I leave to come back again and repeat.

"event","<a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/10/9/53028/9378"">Staten Island's dearest Congressman, Vito Fossella, is evidently vulnerable.</a>

Also interesting for the talk about the double-speak of an intelligent Staten Islander.


<a href=""http://ny13.blogspot.com/"">And this is a blog on getting rid of Fossella, and his slithery ways.</a>


Elsewhere in politics: I think its cloyingly amusing that our best hope for Iraq might now be a strong-man...like Saddam. Or weird ideas <a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-2404311,00.html"">like this.</a>"

"event","I have finally come around to the notion that Dick Cheney runs the government. And that the world may end in ruin.

I now teach English at Tottenville High School. I want them to die. I understand my 8th grade teacher social studies teacher now. He talked about driving around Staten Island in a tank, and machine-gunning people. He put up his hands and made the blowing up noises, so far as I can remember. He might have made the actual machine gun noises. And he threatened to shove his foot up people's asses. But its all worth it because of about five to ten people.

I have infinite respect for some of my teachers: mainly Ronaldson and Roach. They seem like virtuosos.

If I don't get fired for some reason I want to go to Mexico or somewhere next summer.

The College of Staten Island is not just as bad as I heard it was: it is much much worse.

I like apples and I like fall. 
I like doggies and I like you all."

"event","Spending time at my parent's house is unsurprisingly boring, but it does give me the chance to become familiar with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bestselling_novels_in_the_United_States"">American best-seller lists of the 20th Century</a> on wikipedia. I'm enraptured. While I at first thought that Winston Churchill had an unheralded history as a best-selling novelist (in the top ten in 1915,-14,-13,-10,-08,-06,-04,-01, and -00, I later discovered that he was not the prime minister, but an only slightly extraordinary man from St. Louis.

As I expected, the past decade seems pretty inglorious compared to most decades, but the early part of the century actually doesn't seem any better. The high point of quality best-sellers seems to have been somewhere in the 60s, I guess, with it sort of tapering off in either direction. Right about the apex of the middle-brow, as David Brooks argued <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/16/opinion/16brooks.html?ex=1276574400&en=ac30f1a386a6ebae&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss"">here.</a>"

"event","I just took the LAST (Liberal Arts and Sciences Test), which all New York Teachers are required to pass. It made me happy. There were questions that were actually mildly difficult. A lack of political correctness. Conservative viewpoints. One short text which argued that cities were more politically responsive when they were run by corrupt local bosses. And, the crowning candy(?), the essay was on the sweetheart of my intellectual eye, building and development regulation: 

I started out with a mild yet reasonable argument of economic necessity and wholesome community goodness, along with the caveat that it was inevitable that individual property rights were trampled in these everything-killing times, and I ended with a cynical open-ended statement regarding the ability of ""the people"" to be responsible and far-sighted. It was  a satisfying masterpiece of twenty-five minute standardized testing, I tell you.

Now I'm off to the subject-specific (English) test, and then my sister's graduation/brother's birthday party. Of course my mother didn't inform me that it was happening until yesterday. Relatives, dull awkwardness, here I come."

"event","To celebrate my birthday I bought myself out of library debt. I only had to pay twenty-five dollars instead of fifty, which I was pretty sure was the actual amount. Either I forgot that I paid part of it off or my mom went in and paid some. 

But in my victory, I sow the seeds of my demise: I filled two shopping bags with books, cds, and dvds. Prime catches: The Complete Short Stories of Vladimir Nabokov and The first five books of John Ashberry in one volume. I also bought, for one dollar, Tempus Interludium-Interdimensional Solar Mechanics (Of Atoms and Astronauts). On the back: ""...although He makes no claim, they all know him as 'the man of Galilee!"""

"event","Enjoying Sedutto's again today. When I came in the tables were filled with kids playing magic. So they still do that. That's reassuring. The big old dirty with the beard was here with a large metal object that looked like an anchor lying on the floor next to his table. Then they all left and were replaced by a woman with red hair and a pink shirt who took a sip from her coke and then passed out in the booth. Eventually she woke up and read a Christian pamphlet. But over and over. I am drinking my chocolate milkshake which the hot girl wearing the KISS shirt got for me after much silent deliberation. The classic ugly retarded person that works in the back brought it out.

I'm only here because I fell asleep for my job interview. More correctly, I went home, started believing it was at three-thirty instead of two, fell asleep, and then spontaneously recovered enough intelligence at two, when I woke up, to realize my mistake,and reschedule. The lady there seemed to have some kind of logical explanation for my mistakes, which does baffle me, but thats ok.

I discovered the house two away from mine is a landmark designed by Ernest Flagg. Ernest Flagg was a mad architect and Staten Island cheerleader for most of his life from the late 1800s until 1947. He designed the Singer Building, a classic of Beaux-Arts architecture, which once was the tallest building in the world, and, even today, holds the record for largest inhabited structure ever demolished. Ironically, as ever, he wrote some of the first modern zoning laws to prevent over-development. He also built the colossal mansion (""Stonecourt,"" which is kind of a lame name) which I've discovered on the street behind ours. And, where it not for Rockefeller getting the UN to vote on his proposal eight minutes before Flagg's reached them, Staten Island, could very well have been the site of the United Nations. All this has my nerve endings in a bunch. Also the fact that I was so keen on the house before I knew it was designed by Flagg. Props to my discerning eye."

Some Living Things I Hate and Love

Love (I actually like many of these more dead than alive, but that's ok)

birches
the Brooklyn Botanical Garden
old growth forests
butterflies & moths
the old tree at the Conference House
fruit trees (still living and in fireplaces)
lettuce
Haddock
the New State Mollusk
the Chittenango Snail
very small flowers that grow in bunches
funny looking wildflowers like <A HREF=""http://www.rideau-info.com/canal/images/nature/img-breeches.html"">Dutchman's Breeches</A>
tough, old, thick patches of grass like the kind i remember eating lunch on <A HREF=""http://whttp://stavanger.clickwalk.no/images/stavanger/3/98/2l.jpg"">here</A>
ents
butterflies and moths
Spruce trees

Hate

canadian geese
pigeons
cheap softwoods
most lawns
invasive streptococcus (this is gross and should not exist)
stds
sticker bushes
invasive people
pretty much all invasive species actually; i think everything on thist list is 
pretty much all invasive species"

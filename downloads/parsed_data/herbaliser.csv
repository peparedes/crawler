<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/sets/72157634946699411/with/9446781773/>backpacking near Cathedral Rock</a> - 8 miles total

And I have a bike, too. It's a 1995 Raleigh, but it's in really good condition.

Last weekend Reg and I picked 4 pounds of blueberries at the U-Pick in Bellevue, then we totally lost our shit at Hempfest (literally, my wallet and Reg's bag of ""medicine""). I found my wallet at least. Reg found another kind soul to give him medicine. 

We're starting up Munchkin nights every Tuesday (or at least something every Tuesday) so Reg doesn't go crazy from me not being around, or something like that. 

Reg and I are supposed to go to Colville this weekend but I really have other stuff I'd like to get done, like lead a friend on a vision quest. (Oh yeah, I bought a Djembe at Hempfest.) Also, Slutwalk."

"event","So I found one of <a href=http://www.bikepedia.com/QuickBike/BikeSpecs.aspx?year=1995&brand=Raleigh&model=C30>these</a> on eBay for under $200. I mean I don't know, maybe I got ripped off, but bikes seem to hold their value a lot more than cars, since it's easier to keep them in good condition. It's leaving AZ right now and I'm all excited. Gotta get a helmet I guess. Other than that I'm not going to go overboard in gear - my furthest ride will be my work commute at 5 miles or so. 

(I was loaned one for a Saturday trek and have been obsessed since. Well, I was considering getting a skateboard, but I think this will be a safer choice. There's a reason ""like riding a bike"" is a metaphor for so many things.)

Reg and I are going camping with friends this weekend, then taking a few days to do an actual backpack (not exactly sure where yet, but probably around Leavenworth). I'm hoping the bike arrives before then, or is there when we get back. That would be sweet."

"event","We watched the Michael Fassbender vehicle <u>Shame</u>. It's amazing. He's basically a sex/porn addict, although his sex is exclusively with prostitutes or one-nighters. Usually the latter don't even make it to his place. Anyway, he's finally forced to try to deal with a woman as a real person - his sister - and he doesn't do so well. Really amazing film. I mean, not as good as <u>Stoker</u> but still great."

There was a huge misunderstanding after I called Reg up and asked if he thought we should get married for tax reasons, he said he'd have to think about it, and I heard NO and cried and sniffled the whole rest of the work day, and I didn't want to go home, and I finally did, and he told me I was silly, and there's no other person he could possibly imagine marrying, and he thought I didn't care but he felt we were already married. And if it really mattered we could go to the courthouse this week, but I don't think that's necessary. So um, you should REALLY come to Decibel Festival, is all I will say right now.

It was utterly serene and calm. We read Sherlock Holmes mysteries - him with his lumpy paperback, me with my sleek Kindle - roasted hot dogs and marshmallows for s'mores, and got sunburnt. Monday morning we woke up and it was gray, and the battery of the car wouldn't start. Fortunately we had a spare in the trunk, hahah. 

I wish I took pictures of the truck that got cut up from running into a boat propeller, but I did get a pic of the <a href=https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/984125_10151638683485240_800175132_n.jpg>lady who spun out on the merge from 90 to I-5N.</a>"

Clearly the most expensive counter at Nordstrom but I was trapped. I exaggerated my helplessness to some degree (you guys have seen my pics, I'm not totally clueless about makeup) by playing up the 'Soft angle. ""After 3 years I'm out of practice! ""<p>&nbsp;</p>(I did wear some makeup at other jobs, so as I said, an exaggeration.)<p>&nbsp;</p>She applied a fancy ""deep sea nutrient"" moisturizer which felt <i>amazing </i>on my overheated skin. Then a tinted moisturizer/foundation and then concealer. I absolutely want the concealer, it erased my undereye circles. And then cream blush, holy god I looked five years younger. (And I already look under 30 without makeup.)<p>&nbsp;</p>Finally eye stuff, she did close to what I do but with a fatter pencil on top, and fully outlined the bottom with a small one. And lipstick out of a liquid tube.

"event","But the fact is, I haven't like bought any new clothes that actually accentuate the weight I lost.<lj-cut text=""TW: weight, weight loss, body image""> I just sometimes get shocked in the shower - WHERE DID I GO! b/c I put on about 15 lbs in 2010-2011 and then lost it last Feb/March, and then another 15lbs after that. Those 15lbs were simply the one or two pounds I'd gained every year since dating Reg. One doesn't go from 26 to 34, in an established relationship, without putting on a little weight. 

So, now all my clothes from before meeting Reg fit me. Correction - my clothes from HIGH SCHOOl fit me, except for the size 4 jeans which I had made cutoffs out of years ago anyway. I'm definitely a little bigger than I was in high school, but not very much. Seems to be edging at 4/6 for pants and 2/4 for shirts. In ladies sizes. In Jrs it's more like 5 or 7. And yes I still wear Jrs sometimes, where else do you get cute shirts that show off your boobs? I mean, when you don't have any. I can't fucking understand how I can wear a 32C and not really have cleavage to speak of. (My boobs pretty much don't gain weight. I went from a 36A to a 32C, which just means that the band size shrunk four inches and my boobs shrunk one inch.) My thighs are 22inches, they may have been smaller in high school but I'm amazed to look at my legs, which have always ALWAYS been larger than normal. I always wondered how chicks walked around on spindle legs, and now I'm almost there. Well, ok, my thighs still touch and make that cute little triangle. 

I think I'm a bit more accepting of how I look when I'm not wearing pants. I definitely have a 32"" waist (although my designer jeans insist it's 27"") around my navel, apple shaped, but I also have a 38"" ass, so that's reasonable. So with a shirt off I can see the spare tire, but with only pants off I see skinny legs, something I'm just not familiar with at all. And I even have to wear a belt with my ""skinny jeans"" since my legs are apparently bigger than my hips should be, or something? 

The look this past year has been sweaters over tights, although I didn't have cute tights till December, and I still don't have that many cute sweaters. Not that I want to wear what everyone else is wearing, but I want it to be a conscious decision, not a ""I haven't been shopping in 8 years"" default. 
</lj-cut>
I got a makeover at the (unfortunately) most expensive counter at Nordstrom's Friday evening, the woman took maybe ten minutes to make me look five years younger. (And yeah, I already look pretty young, I know.) She gave me some free samples after I spent far too much on moisturizer, but I figure once a month I can afford something like this. The cream blush was to die for. I looked like I'd had just a single glass of wine, all aglow and fresh. So, we'll see. She did think I had to wear sunscreen while working with computers - has she not heard of LCD screens? - and mentioned lots of MSFT women felt clueless. I don't feel clueless, I just wondered if I could do better. And like I said, she did. Someone else said I looked like a doll, by which I think he meant unnatural, but I figured I wasn't going out in daylight so whatevs. 

Anyway, part one of turn into a woman is almost complete. Clothing will be next. I swear I'm going to buy cute stuff and pay an asian lady to tailor darts into it so I look like I do have a waist, and all that. Whew!"

The driver of the carpool was actually close to my own horrible skill level, as he'd been going twice a week or more since December. DANG. So we went back and forth, from Holiday to Express to 360 back to Express then up and down Express, then up and down 360. Never taking any blacks of course, which means to get from Express to 360 area, we had to float over new snow that was about 2ft high. If you're skiing, you have to go REALLY FAST to get over that sort of soft powder. 

Anyway, good times. Got numbers so if I want to, I can go skiing without Reg again. But I really want to go to Stevens this weekend, so ... yeah."

He's got Powerpoint slides and all. Coming from the C++ background I do, it's more like a refresher, so far anyway. I mean, I did a semester of C in high school, then mostly C++ in college, and a couple terms of Java. Then three years straight of Visual Basic. But, yes, I haven't really coded much since 2002. 

Which ends up being good for this class, because syntax is the trickier bit to learn, and I've forgotten specific syntax, but I know structure, so I was correcting the teacher and showing off a little with !(x || y) == (!x && y) kind of things.

Wednesday night I had plans but dropped them for girlfriend-emergency. When a friend gets dumped, you give them booze and benzos, right? And tell them stories about how embarrassing your own exes acted, and all that rot.

A few years ago (before I got into fanfic) I was writing a story about boys and girls in Seattle, and one of the girls was a half-black, half-Jewish liberal poly stereotype. Anyway the book stalled b/c I kept going to backstories on everyone's college years, including the liberal girl, who lived in a house with other poly people and they all slept with each other and everyone was happy with the situation, except her female FWB who wanted more than a couple dates a month. 

(I WONDER WHAT THAT STORY MEANT.)

Ahem. Last night we went skiing, night skiing at Snoqualmie Pass. First skiing of 2013, next apparently we're going to Stevens. Heh. It was bloody awesome. The only bad part was when Reg accidentally took me on a lift that only had black paths down. I tried my best, but about halfway down I fell, and every time I tried to get up, I just slid down. (It was around 29F so very slushie.) So I figured I'd just slide the whole way down. Reg was impressed at how well I was able to control my sliding, but it was just like normal skiing: you point them and you go THAT way.

Also been trying to see if I can get into the <a href=http://www.lesswrong.com>Less Wrong</a> community. I love the site, have for years, but most of the people who post there just seem completely humorless and unintentionally misogynistic. Not all of them, just most. So maybe I should try to steer more people to read the sequences on how to hack your brain, at least, so people realize that just because you act like you believe something, doesn't mean you really believe it."

"event","So I&#39;ve had like 3 root canals that I need to pay for, so everyone is giving me money for xmas so I can do this. Basically my insurance ran out on the 2nd one and I couldn&#39;t not get the root canal. I mean I suppose I could have just had the teeth pulled but they were frontish teeth, not molars. I already feel like a gap-toothed hillbilly.

So yeah, a couple shirts and candy and random stuff - Reg paid for my new tattoo for part of an Xmas present, and also he got me a <a href=""https://twitter.com/laural/status/283439866132451329/photo/1"">sweet necklace</a>. And some new gloves since I dropped one at Mission Ridge.

Plus we were going to go to <a href=""http://crystalmountainresort.com/The-Mountain/Webcams"">Crystal Mountain</a> for the 25th, and gloves would be awesome. It started snowing on the drive up - it&#39;s much closer than I realized, but that&#39;s partly because there was no traffic. We went to Rainier area a few times over the summer, and the traffic was always terrible on a nice day, but this time nada. So we got there before noon, traded in the corporate passes for <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/8312393424/in/photostream"" target=""_blank"">gondola passes.</a>

I am not an awesome skier, and I have mainly NOT skied while it snows. It was not quite what people call &quot;Washington Concrete&quot;, but it was close. A bit too warm and too much fluffy shit that you just basically snowplow into. I mean, I normally am good at falling on my ass when I ski, but on that last bit of the bunny slope, I was going really really fast and hit a drift and faceplanted like whoa. So that wetted out my jacket, and filled my goggles with snow, and I had a really hard time just getting up. The weather finally calmed down around 2:30pm, but by then my muscles were feeling the burn of trying to keep control in the deep snow. I am totally sticking to groomed runs if I take up cross-country, I swear.

When we got home Reg wanted to watch <i>Schindler&#39;s List</i>. I&#39;d actually successfully avoided it for years, I mean, I knew the basic plot, but Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are pretty goddamn awesome in it. I told Reg they should make a sequel, set in 1950s Saudi Arabia oil plants. Well, ok, maybe not, but the premise appeals to that black hearted cynic inside me. Afterwards naturally we watched <i>Die Hard.</i>

And I know that almost no one in Seattle reads this, but I&#39;m <a href=""http://www.skileavenworth.com/lessons-programs/ski-snowboard-lessons"">planning to go to Leavenworth to improve my skiing.</a>"

The first one: woah so violent/more explicit than the movie w the violence/serial killer shit, kept me up at night, had to read HP to calm down.

The second one: OMG FUCKING AWESOME

the third one: Lame courtroom drama and um sitting around in a hospital instead of beating up dudes? bleh.

In general, the whole detailing-every-little-thing-that-Lisbeth-does-all-day was annoying. I don't know if that was the translator's fault or not, but the books just seemed kind of all over the place. I mean I realize Lisbeth is more analytical and that's how she thinks, but it's boring. 

Anyway, the movie was great, the Reznor soundtrack and the direction made a kind of boring book freaking awesome, and Rooney Mara as well, a perfect Salander. Maybe the books were hyped up too much, like Harry Potter, I dunno. 

In general I'm in love with Lisbeth Salander though."

"event","The hotel where the Jurassic Park film crew stayed was ruined by a typhoon towards the end of filming, so it's a nasty looking death trap full of rats now. We drove by it every time we went up the east coast of the island, but I didn't feel like trespassing without sneakers. And you don't wear sneakers if you can avoid it. ""Why the hell did I bring all these long-sleeved shirts?"" asked Reg. (So no pictures of a nasty rotting hotel.)

We got in on 12/1 before 2pm, but I frankly didn't want to do anything but go to bed early after we settled in just before sunset. We stayed in Poi'pu, which is sort of the southeast corner/just past the eastern part on the southern coast. Day 2 wasn't bad, <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/archives/date-taken/2012/12/02/>went up the eastern road</a> back past Lihue and Kapaa. The timeshare we stayed at for a week wasn't available any more than 6 days, so on the last day we had to go to Kapaa and stay there. Anyway it's a small small island, you can drive around the main roads that (almost) circle the island in probably two hours. And it only takes that long because of the sloooow drivers. I got some rays, a swimsuit and a pineapple, and then we went to to a Mediterranean-themed restaurant for dinner back in Poi'pu.

The one problem with this time of year is the sunset is like 6:15pm or something silly like that, and sunrise is 7am or so. This wouldn't normally be a problem I guess, except that there's no nightlife to speak of on Kauai. So we'd go to bed relatively early (1am) and get up at 9am. Day 3 wasn't very nice in Poi'pu, so Reg and I drove west along the southern shore, and stopped at the <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/archives/date-taken/2012/12/03/>Russian fort</a> in Waimea and hung out on the rocky shoreline there. (The <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Fort_Elizabeth>fort</a> is now just a few walls of rock that are almost 200 years old.) It got a bit crappy again when we returned, which made grilling steak a pain.

<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/archives/date-taken/2012/12/04/>Day 4 had lots of pictures</a>, as we drove on Waimea Canyon Drive through Waimea Canyon State Park. The weather was the worst yet, about 70F and windy and cloudy as we got higher and higher up. At the very end of the road is an <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/8267877804/in/datetaken/>overlook to the northern coast</a>, which really has terrible weather (over 400inches of rain a year), but as a result is quite lush. It's known as the Na'pali coastline, and this is the bit of the island where the roads don't circle. You have to see it by boat or air. 

We went back (well, all of us but John and Katie, who were determined to hike) to Waimea town, bought some cookies and shirts and another pineapple. The weather was finally getting to rain, so we didn't stick around that long. We stopped in Hanapepe and hit the swinging bridge that's just like most suspension bridges on WA Forest hikes. Reg wanted to check out the bookstore, which had lots of crazy old books for reasonable prices, including a First Edition set of Churchill's history of WWII. All six books for $40. Reg was psyched indeed. Unfortunately at this point the rain was really coming down, so we went back to the hotel and thought about dinner. Reg's dad had been raving about the Puka Dogs, so we figured that would be fine, since Katie and John were still hiking. Reg and I put on TCM because <i>The Sting</i> was on. (We have cable right now but are not in the habit of watching it.) We also watched the 4 hours of lightning strikes, dang.

<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/archives/date-taken/2012/12/05/>On Day 5</a>, we decided to go to Hanalei. Although there was a miscommunication, and Katie and John (who had their own car) took us to Ke'e Beach instead. Well, it was pretty nice there, too, but it's where the northwest road ends, right near the Napali coastline, so it was really far, and not super warm. After about an hour, we drove back south, to Anini beach. There's a park area where people can camp, but the end of the road has a nicer area for wading. But the sun was going to set fast, and we wanted to go to the <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/8267981070/in/datetaken/>lighthouse</a>. The lighthouse costs money to get in, so we didn't actually go to it, but stayed at the viewpoint where you can see about 6 kinds of birds flying and nesting. Then, dinner at the Bistro nearby. Decent prices for really good food.

I'd wanted to try surfing the previous day, but there was no opportunity. So Day 6 we called up one of the Poi'pu surf schools and got a spot for a noon surfing lesson. I also picked up some shorts (I'd gotten a shirt the day before) and changed into them. So, if you've never surfed, you first have to learn how to stand up. We practiced that on the ground for about half an hour, then carried our boards using our heads (ow, ow) to an area on the beach. Then we paddled out a little bit to wait for appropriate waves. Paddle two lengths then stand up. Easier said than done. Then, paddle back out, against the current again, and listen to the instructor remind you of what you're supposed to do. Chest up, hips up, right foot forward first, then left foot. Much easier on the ground than on a wave, of course. Anyway, repeat that for about an hour, or till you think you're going to die. I did finally manage to stand up all the way to the beach twice, and two other times on my knees. I also <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/8267982272/in/datetaken/>fell into rocks. Ow.</a> Reg and his parents were snorkeling and swimming with a sea turtle in the meantime. 

I was pretty much dead to the world by the time we had lunch, I have to say. Not only was I exhausted from using muscles I don't normally use, I was starving and wanted an entire pork sandwich to myself. And a pineapple daiquiri. We went back briefly then hung out on the beach till almost sunset, when it was getting a bit chilly. I mean, I personally don't think that 75F is an appropriate temperature to sit in surf at. I really prefer 85F for swimming, and it was a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/8250302141/in/datetaken/>really really nice day</a> for surfing.

<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/archives/date-taken/2012/12/07/>Next day</a> was the day we had reservations on a catamaran to see the Napali coastline. Unfortunately I got seasick and couldn't really look anywhere but the horizon without wanting to hurl. So I don't really have many pictures. But I did see dolphins. And also whales. Oh, and while everyone was having dinner, I saw a shark fin, too. <a href=http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=93991888-693c-4ba8-af85-dff956e6c2ef>Reg got</a> some <a href=http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=915a5db5-f3b9-47fe-94ea-7e71c940df6b>stitched panos</a> though. We also saw a nude beach, and a few waterfalls (not many b/c of the drought, haha), and a beach full of sea turtles. 

On day 8 we moved to our new hotel and went back to Hanalei. Pretty much hit every single shop that we hadn't hit before, had lunch in the second story seafood joint with a nice view, and I made an appointment to get a tattoo on our last full day out. We also went back to Anini Beach for a while; Reg and I found some homemade swings in a tree down the way. Had sushi for dinner, at a place where they had cameras set up over the sushi chef guy, and showed it on the big screen TVs. Kind of nifty.

Day 9 John and Katie were leaving, so we had breakfast together and caught some rays behind the hotel. (This one was right smack on the beach; the other one was fairly close to some big rocks.) It was a lot windier than I'd expected so I had to make sure I didn't lose my hat. Finally they took off, and then Reg fell asleep for a while. The weather turned by 2pm and Reg was still asleep by 3pm, so I got to drive in the rain back up to Hanalei. My tattoo was 4pm and we got there about 10 minutes early; it's about 35miles but people were actually driving at a reasonable pace. So there you go. I got a turtle with a wave in it. The tattoo guy was recommended by one of the galley slaves on the catamaran - she was originally from Seattle so we took her advice. He was kind of a crazy libertarian type, really anti-government except that he thought Arabs should be put in camps. ""For their own safety."" I managed to get him and Reg talking about WWII so that was a little more comfortable. Anyway, <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/8260991865/in/datetaken/>small tattoo</a> so it wasn't too long. 

And then the next day, it was time to go back. I took a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/archives/date-taken/2012/12/10/>bunch of pictures</a> before checkout, and a few at Lydgate Beach. We weren't sure were to eat lunch, so I looked up on Yelp and found a hole in the wall - literally - near the rental car place. So we got burgers and then returned the car. And then the airport. I think I got pulled aside for a random search, but after seven minutes or so no one had searched me, so I just went to the gate. Probably shouldn't have pink hair if I keep flying."

He did half the ""movies"" in CA - it was more like 6 movies in one, you might say. The Wachowskis did the rest of them, and well, you know, you could tell. I like weird sci-fi action as much as the next nerd, and they do it pretty damn well. 

Oh yeah and Ben Wishaw was in this too. And Tom Hanks played more roles than anyone else. Sometimes you forget the man actually won a bunch of Oscars for a reason, but also that he's a damn fine comic actor. 

ANYWAY IT'S GREAT OMFG"

The wedding of Reg&#39;s (female) cousin was on Sunday afternoon, so we didn&#39;t come back till Monday. Also, Veteran&#39;s Day.The wedding was a standard small-town church wedding - except I&#39;d never seen a LUTHERAN ceremony before, that was ok. I mean, less ridiculous than Episcopalian, but more &quot;God-y&quot; than um every wedding I&#39;ve been to since 2002?</p><p sab=""1590"">So yeah, Pachelbel and 1st Corinthians and a poem about penguins. (Um.) And her best friend singing a song, which I mentally replaced with &quot;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNFESCrGgI"" sab=""1591"">Growing on Me</a>.&quot; (Same vocal range probably.) But that was about it, and we lit candles then blew bubbles and it was over. I still was fairly rude during, whispering &quot;Replace LOVE with SATAN&quot; and &quot;Aren&#39;t ordinary people adorable?&quot; to Reg, who couldn&#39;t stop giggling. At least I didn&#39;t immediately think &quot;This is a total farce&quot; as I used to. (That&#39;s what happens when the first big wedding you attend is your brother, ok.)<br sab=""1592"" /><br sab=""1593"" />Anyway, Reg&#39;s sister Katie was taking a million pictures as they had no real photographer - what a horrible thing to say, Katie has two photography degrees - she just isn&#39;t a &#39;professional&#39; photographer right now. I&#39;m sure she had a rough weekend being the documenter, esp. as she doesn&#39;t drink. I got Reg&#39;s dad to take pics of me and Reg, since we don&#39;t usually dress up, and when we do we don&#39;t think to get pics of us together. But I was wearing an extra shirt under my dress and it made my tummy look way bigger than it actually is. Er, I hope. The dress was bought from Korean eBay, so it&#39;s a bit form-fitting on my (non-Asian but still short) frame.<br sab=""1594"" /><br sab=""1595"" />But finally they finished and we all headed to the reception. DJ started off playing quiet &quot;dinner music&quot; (a lot of country and Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers. Maybe he thought they were country. The brother of the bride sat with us, the &quot;cool table&quot; I guess? Reg&#39;s other cousin (his dad has a sister too) Em and Katie sat with us - and they are pretty cute girls, I&#39;ll admit. Reg&#39;s cousin is only 23, so he still&nbsp;kind of looks up to Reg in some ways. (Probably the wardrobe and hot girl.) He even joked about driving around his cousins - &quot;most chicks I&#39;ve ever had in this car!&quot; - the other night.<br sab=""1596"" /><br sab=""1597"" />The food was really good. I mean, most weddings under 50K don&#39;t have the best food, and even when they have decent food it&#39;s usually not still warm? But this reception food was really damn good. From the salad to the beef to the mac&#39;n&#39;cheese. Man. That beef is still making me smile. Reg&#39;s cousin didn&#39;t have silverware, since he just sat at our table by pulling his proper seat (with the other groomsmen) to ours, so he picked up his piece of meat with a spoon and let it kind of fall into his mouth. It was kind of gross, really.<br sab=""1598"" /><br sab=""1599"" />When the proper dancing started, it was still too much country. Like, entirely 2000-era stuff. Maybe one song I recognized from my high school friends, but on the other hand, as I told Reg, I don&#39;t even know all the lyrics to &quot;Friends in Low Places.&quot; At which point Reg pretended to sing it Eddie Vedder style. Later on, the DJ played some of the groom&#39;s favorite hair metal songs, like the Crue and AC/DC and even &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot; (thanks, <lj user=""bart_calendar"" />, for ruining that song for me), but it was still a lot of country. And also Elvis. And ALSO &quot;Stayin&#39; Alive&quot;, which does still remind me of Travolta with a paint can, but also of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpLPmfBUb34"">Moriarty</a>. The DJ even played a crappy dance song or two for the kids. We had to ask our phones to discover it was LMFAO. Oh boy.<br /><br />(Oh boy. Kids are 23 now. Born in 1989. YIKES.)<br /><br />There wasn&#39;t any liquor, which wasn&#39;t surprising but still a little disappointing. Wine tends to make me sleepy - white wine anyway. I had a few glasses and Reg&#39;s second cousin - who is a big lush as his wife is also - met us at the bar table. Hahah. We also met (well, I met) some guy from Reg&#39;s past. He just remarried, and his new wife is pretty cool. Talked about blowing her ears out during &#39;60s concerts. (The dude was a little sketchy - he last saw Reg when Reg was 17 or so, and was excessively friendly at the reception. I was all &quot;latent homo&quot; and Reg was all &quot;DUH!&quot;)<br /><br />So all in all it was entertaining. The brunch was more staid but we had bacon and mimosas. Well, I did, Reg&#39;s bacon was cold and also he was driving at first. The drive back was pretty awful, not just because we kept fighting over music, but also because it was snowing and then raining, and four hours of driving in a cloud is trying. Even Reg&#39;s mom admitted to us later than she fell asleep. Katie and Em obviously - Katie had been running on Diet Rockstar and nothing else, poor girl.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t really want to go back, but Reg pointed out that we&#39;ve <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRVCtbfuDqw"">Japandroids </a>tickets Thursday. Ok then.</p>"

Saturday walked about five miles up the hill to Chism Beach, then Sunday I just went to the post office and saw <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/herbaliser/sets/72157631830207391/with/8113723976/>THAT</a> and I was like OMG. And then lost my relatively new sunglasses. Boy, I'm annoyed about that.

We spent a ton of time with Keely while she was here, and I think my liver doubled in size or something. Also, I really am sick of staring at the four walls inside my apartment, having been in the outside world so much. Although I'm still kind of ""meh"" about people when I'm sober. That's fine. It's all fine. I'm just saying, it's ALL fine.

Oh yeah, I watched the first few episodes of <i>Elementary</i> and they annoyed me and Reg (who only saw two minutes) so bad we had to watch the BBC Sherlock pilot again. Reg has finally watched the entire six episodes (he was stringing out the pleasure, or something) but I fell asleep in the middle of ""The Reichenbach Fall"" so I have no idea of his reaction to John and Sherlock holding hands. He liked the ending a lot though. I was like ""Martin Freeman crying is kind of like watching kittens getting strangled"" and he was like ""Totally."""

"event","Reg and I watched <i sab=""3874"">We Are Legion</i> last night, which is all about 4chan (/b/) and Anonymous becoming more than just a Lolz movement. It&#39;s kind of crazy, because Reg is rereading the Illuminatus! trilogy right now, and I was like &quot;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange"" sab=""3875"">JULIAN ASSANGE </a>IS LIKE A LESS SMOOTH <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illuminatus!_Trilogy"" sab=""3876"">SIMON MOON</a>!&quot; I mean, forget postModernism, we are post 1984 right here, through the looking glass. If you&#39;ve been on the internet before 2004, you knew that attacking Scientology was a good way to get your server shut down. In the movie we watched this Nebraskan kid who basically ran a program that&#39;s like the &quot;evil&quot; version of SETI at home - it just hits &quot;refresh&quot; on a website till the website gets <a href=""http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/DDOS"" sab=""3877"">DDOS&#39;d</a>. I mean, he was one of like thousands who did this, but because he was a rural kid who wouldn&#39;t be able to get a good lawyer, the FBI went after him. And like an idiot, he admitted what he did to the FBI.<br sab=""3878"" /><br sab=""3879"" />So, yeah, he goes to jail for a year, and has no computer access for 2 years in total. But that&#39;s the end of it, once his sentence is over there is nothing else they can do to him. I mean, I know it looks bad that you can actually go to jail for a DDOS attack if you have a shitty lawyer, but this is literally the worst that the Scientologists have been able to come up with. I don&#39;t condone death threats, which apparently they got on their 1-800 line, but they couldn&#39;t get the five people who did that. And if you were clever enough to run this Ion Cannon program through a proxy (which, honestly, should be a default option, script kiddies), you were gonna get away scot-free. This is a huge deal, that the Scientologists, who have all this money and power, are basically now impotent.<br sab=""3880"" /><br sab=""3881"" />And that&#39;s just the start of it. The movie shows how some hackers basically set up old school IRC and modem lines for Egypt when their government shut it down. Basically, it&#39;s now impossible for a government to completely close the lines of communication, no matter how hard they try, even if they&#39;re machine gunning down people in the streets. It&#39;s truly amazing.<br sab=""3882"" /><br sab=""3883"" />Unfortunately the movie ended with the whole &quot;occupy ***&quot; thing, which I&#39;m sure a year ago actually looked real. But with all these other Anonymous &quot;movements&quot; there was an actual goal in sight. I understand the Occupy kids were mad, or unemployed and sick of it, but it seems like the Occupy kids were merely allied with Anonymous, not actually utilizing the power of Anonymous. Which is understandable - people on 4chan either have jobs or at the least have computers in their parents&#39; basement, not really the same exact people in the Occupy movement. So that sort of annoyed me, including that footage of a movement in which nothing actually moved.<br sab=""3884"" /><hr sab=""3885"" /><br sab=""3886"" />And then I went to see <i sab=""3887"">The Perks of Being A Wallflower</i>, based on the book of the same name. Well, loosely based, like most books made into movies, but I rather enjoyed it. Although they kept the same music references from 2000, which made the soundtrack basically my college years. I wasn&#39;t sure if that was just the writers being lazy at first, but I think it was. I don&#39;t actually believe that the youth of today listens to &#39;80s music. I didn&#39;t believe it in <i sab=""3888"">10 Things I Hate About You</i> either.<br sab=""3889"" /><br sab=""3890"" />But as a painful reminder of being a teenager that listens more than talks, it accomplished that goal, oh yes it did. Watching the one you want with someone who treats them like crap. All this painful horrible teenage angst, along with the thrill of not knowing what the night will bring, something wonderful, something poignant, the movie brings it all there. It&#39;s a nostalgia-fest for anyone who was a teenager in the &#39;90s, and probably before and after. (I mean, I wasn&#39;t, so I don&#39;t know. I just know that music is powerful as hell for me, and the Smiths put me there.)<br sab=""3891"" /><br sab=""3892"" />Anyway, very emotional, evocative of not just the misery, but also the hope, that being a teenager entails. I mean, I think most of us had rough years, but there was hope too, even if it was mostly&nbsp;after we got out of our house. There&#39;s a lot of sympathy for Charlie&#39;s pain, but there&#39;s also the cautious optimism that things actually are going to be good for him. Despite the fact that he still has THREE MORE YEARS of high school..."

I left after Biosphere for many reasons, not the least of which being it&#39;s the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SEATED VENUE I&#39;ve ever sat in. Granted my high school had a little money, the auditorium doubled as a movie theater, and my college &quot;auditorium&quot; (ie where we saw Squirrel Nut Zippers) was um, at Duke. Still. Nonetheless. I absolutely refused to go to the Saturday ambient event for this reason, and I swear to god unless say U2 plays there, I ain&#39;t goin&#39; back.<br /><br />But it didn&#39;t really matter since my tooth was flaring up, then aching after a flareup. I tried to get in touch with a couple people - since the few people I recognized at the BPH were giving me the cut direct - but they were having issues. So I just went to Dragonfish, had deep fried bacon and chicken satay, then bussed it home. NBD, watched <i>Avengers </i>again till Reg got home and passed out on the couch. That was really ok, I was worn out from Orbital on Thursday and wanted to save some energy for Saturday&#39;s show."

"event","So Wednesday I went to collect my <a href=""http://decibelfestival.com/"">Decibel Festival</a> pass (brought to me by the kind folks of <a href=""http://www.xlr8r.com/"">XLR8R</a> and random number generation), then rode the bus downtown to get Reg&#39;s <a href=""http://www.showboxonline.com/eventdetail.php?id=37179"">Matthew Dear</a> ticket. Unfortunately the box office closed at 6pm and the Green Room didn&#39;t open till 7pm (it was 6:50), so I just walked up to Triple Door and said &quot;hey it says I need a ticket from will call?&quot; and they&#39;re like &quot;right on sit here next to someone you don&#39;t know.&quot; Which is as expected when you show up 5 minutes before something starts. I ordered my drink and made zero talk with the guy next to me, except when I discovered they had free wifi.

I've only been to one other similar thing in SF with Steve, where you sit at a fancy table and get service during a show and all that. I have to say it is choice, and the sound almost made me want earplugs. First person to do their ambient thing was decent, although the visuals were very cool. Next person was awesome, and also playing at Neumo's later. Third person started out too ambient for me, beach noises and crickets chirping, but got better. He was also playing at Neumo's later (dvDub and Monolake).

So I ran back to Showbox, got Reg's ticket, then ran up to catch a bus to Neumo's. Except that a) my phone was at 2% power and b) the only card I had any money on, was about to have a big payment clear. But I checked the ATM and it was fine. You can see what's coming, can't you.

I had a powerful lust for chips and salsa, so I stopped at Poquito's for a margarita and chips. The guys sitting next to me at the bar were making me giggle with their WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT POLITICS IN FRONT OF MY GIRLFRIEND/talking about politics game. The guy with the GF had more nuanced views, while the single man was just going to go ahead and vote for Obama. Eventually, due to the aforementioned hilarity, I borrowed the single man's phone to call Reg to beg him to pay my bill. 

Since he and his friend overheard me, they bought me a shot of tequila while the GF was having a smoke. Secret drinking, the best way to make friends. Not that I remember their names or anything. I do remember them saying ""No more politics or Gettin' Pussy talk."" And I was like ""Fine with me, I don't like pussy."" And then of course we proceeded to do just that. On my part I quoted some Bill Hicks at them, and reminded them that in WA your vote for the president counts for jack and shit. For the latter, I told single guy that chicks tend to hate beards, aside from those girls that actually like it a ton (and the girls that are indifferent). I pointed out that his friend had a GF and she probably made him shave every day or something.

And finally my boyfriend arrived to save the day. We were both annoyed at each other, but he still agreed to pick me up at 1:30am while he hung out with a friend of a friend who just got dumped. So I walked over to Neumo's (where Monolake was hanging out in front of the Fish Fry place eating some fish'n'chips) and began dancing. Saw Jason and told him my phone was dead, and that he'd be my walkie talkie. That worked out ok, we danced near each other by the speakers in front.

I put my jacket, hoody and purse down in front of the speaker for a while, but my purse totally got jacked from that locale. Kind of freaky and nerve-wracking - I was convinced someone had stolen it, and my dentist-prescribed meds were in it. (I did retrieve it Thursday afternoon intact in every way.) The 3 drinks (hell, more like 5, big ass margaritas) made me not care so much, and enjoy dancing a lot more than I normally would have. Although every time I accidentally danced onto a cute guy, he allowed it to happen exactly twice, then backed away and began using his smartphone in a very intent and purposeful way. I came to the conclusion that these not-so-young men were gay or had girlfriends. (Actually, the gay ones just backed away casually, now that I think on it.)

So after the show we started an informal poll, that guys over thirty who were at least moderately attractive tended to have girlfriends. Two guys had wedding rings and the third guy was under 30 so not relevant to the poll - besides he had a neck tattoo so it wasn't a real surprise that he didn't have a girlfriend. However, he started talking about getting mugged for his bike, and fighting back by using the bike against the assailant/would-be thief. That was sort of sexy. Fortunately Reg showed up before I could tell icky neck-tattoo guy that I found guys getting into fights an attractive quality.

Thursday I spent half the day playing phone tag with my dentist's office, since he's the only actual doctor there, and he was home today, but I did manage to get the scripts filled before 2pm. I was hoping it'd get called in before my lunch instead of after, but there you go. At least my pho was absolutely bomb. PHO BOMB. I wrote a review on Yelp.

I wasn't really feeling up to schlepping to Seattle before it was time for the Orbital show, but Reg wanted to get there in time for the opener. I bussed up to Neumo's, retrieved my purse (Kindle and Matthew-Dear ticket intact), bussed back down and went to the front of the stage with Reg. Paul Chambers was opening, he was mixing loops and stuff into music-type songs, and I enjoyed these sort-of songs, except that they kept lasting 3 minutes or so. That just isn't right, man. I mean, I like glitchy minimal techno as much as the next nerd, but when you do the same thing that Vegas pool DJs do, it's not a good thing.

But so by the time Orbital was almost ready, it was so packed I could barely find Reg again. The brothers came on stage to ""Time Becomes"" (first track off the brown album), and then their second number was a super remix of ""Halcyon+On+On"" which I attempted to bootleg. (Holding up a recording device in the air is always a tricky situation.) And they kept on playing for two hours, and I think I developed what I used to at raves, that is to say a ""Natural High."" It's a combination of great music and hard dancing that just makes your brain go OOMPH, and it's awesome. 

On the way to the bathroom I got Quent to come up and dance in front with us, and then after the show, while everyone and their brother (and probably their mother, for that matter) shared a cigarette. We said HI to all the people we haven't seen in 3 years, and the people who moved and came back just for the show, and that was nice. Q & K and us made our way to Dragonfish, which Reg and I hadn't been to since Steve's 2010 February visit, ye gods. The Happy Hour menu is even better now, I must say. I could have gorged myself on small plates. And some young man from Detroit mistook Reg for a DJ. 

Anyway, bit of a rough start, but getting awesomer and awesomer."

"event","So, I don&#39;t believe there are evil people in the main, just evil actions. The one exception is the sociopath, or psychopath. (Depending on what literature you read, the former word is simply a nicer word for the latter. Same with Narcissist, actually.) I think seeing <i sab=""1215"">Thor</i> and <i sab=""1216"">The Avengers</i> renewed my interest in these beasts (since I stopped reading The Last Psychiatrist a while ago). Even in <i sab=""1217""><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Without-Conscience-Disturbing-World-Psychopaths/dp/1572304510"" sab=""1218"">Without Conscience</a></i>, Hare points out that only people that ACTUALLY scored highly on the psychopath checklist(TM) can be legitimately called psychopaths. Otherwise it&#39;s just a cluster of behavior traits that are highly correlated but not necessarily sufficient. That is to say, just because someone appeared in this book as an anecdote doesn&#39;t mean they are an actual psychopath. So in the following paragraphs, assume &quot;psychopath&quot; == &quot;someone who got a very high score on the Psychopathy Checklist&quot;.<br sab=""1219"" /><br sab=""1220"" />The two most interesting things (to me) in the book were the results of experiments. One, in fact, got rejected because &quot;these brainwaves can&#39;t be real&quot;. Psychopaths and normals were hooked up to EKG readers and shown both a jumble (UEHKAH) or a word (APPLE) on a computer screen, and they had to click as fast as they could on the real word. Normals scored higher in general, but especially on &quot;emotionally loaded words&quot; like LOVE or DEATH. Psychopaths scored the same on all words.<br sab=""1221"" /><br sab=""1222"" />The other experiment involved scaring people - just with a loud noise or electric shock - and the psychopaths had NO fear response at all compared to the normal people. This is the result that is more relevant for humanity, I think. Because fear is how we condition ourselves. Reg saw one of his young cousins run and trip and fall, over and over again. Sure, young kids have less fear, but he also locks his grandparents out of their car for fun. &quot;Wait till he starts torturing animals,&quot; I said. There was a case in the book of identical twins, one normal, one seemingly without conscience. She began flirting with older boys/men at the age of four to get her way.<br sab=""1223"" /><br sab=""1224"" />And this leads into <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706593/""><i sab=""1225"">Chronicle</i></a>, a surprisingly excellent film, and definitely the best &quot;fake found footage&quot; film. (If it&#39;s a mockumentary, it&#39;s in the style of a real documentary, not just found footage. Fakumentary? Have these people ever seen a documentary?) Also it takes place around Seattle, so you get lots of Space Needle shots. I&#39;m a sucker for that shit, partly because it&#39;s also hilarious and unrealistic. &quot;We&#39;re in Ballard! Now we&#39;re at the Space Needle!&quot; &quot;We&#39;re downtown! Look, the Space Needle!&quot; Ok, it wasn&#39;t quite that bad in this movie, since it was filmed on location.<br sab=""1226"" /><br sab=""1227"" />Anyway. Andrew Detmer is a loner whose mother is deathly ill, father is an unemployed drunk who doesn&#39;t see anything wrong with beating his son, and his only friend is his cousin Matt. Andrew decides to start filming everything (hence the title) that happens to him. The first twenty minutes are establishing this, showing the bullies find him as pleasing a target as his father does, and that he basically has no idea of how to interact with girls his age in the least. His cousin Matt is slightly more socially apt, and uses philosophy to try to pick up girls, and impress Steve Montgomery, the most popular dude in school.<br /><br />The three of them find something weird outside of a rave, and the video futzes out, and when it starts up again, we see they have <b>superpowers</b>. Telekinesis, mainly. They have a lot of fun playing with Legos and other shit, that&#39;s the second third of the movie. Mostly just pranks and other funny stuff. But power begins to corrupt, and Andrew, who clearly already had some sort of dispersonalization traits, goes further into himself. He practices his abilities more and ends up the strongest of them. It&#39;s implied a little that &quot;the alien&quot; gets into him, but I personally thought it was just him. He uses the term &quot;apex predator&quot; to describe himself, and that is certainly a good description of a psychopath. (I mean, he still feels bad about his sick mom, but at the end that is all he seemed to give a crap about.)<br /><br />Anyway, yeah, the ads made it look like a comedy, and the first half is pretty jokey, but it starts dark and stays dark, even during the humor. It definitely is not the happy-feel-good movie <i>The Hulk</i> was, for example. It&#39;s almost painfully realistic, but the guys bro-ing around makes it fun for as long as that lasts. And then it gets REAL dark. Highly recommended. (Superheroes, bros, and power corrupting? Yeah, man.)<br />"

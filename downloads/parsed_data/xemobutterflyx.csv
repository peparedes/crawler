"event","20 Questions to a Better Personality

Wackiness: 64/100
Rationality: 34/100
Constructiveness: 60/100
Leadership: 90/100 

You are a WECL--Wacky Emotional Constructive Leader. This makes you a people's advocate. You are passionate about your causes, with a good heart and good endeavors. Your personal fire is contagious, and others wish they could be as dedicated to their beliefs as you are.
Your dedication may cause you to miss the boat on life's more slight and trivial activities. You will feel no loss when skipping some inane mixer, but it can be frustrating to others to whom such things are important. While you find it difficult to see other points of view, it may be useful to act as if you do, and play along once in a while.
In any event, you have buckets of charisma and a natural skill for making people open up. Your greatest asset is an ability to make progress while keeping the peace. 


So. Fucking. True"

"event","Really need someone to help inspire me to write fanfiction. I don't feel like writing it anymore, just reading it. I think it's because I'm always busy writing for school, and too tired to write fanfic in my time off. 

Anyway, saw New York Minute today. CHUCK COMEAU IS THE COOLEST! he gets to say LOMAX! while he is drumming. And that makes him cool. But he was cool before that anyway! :P but yeah.. I'm on a simple plan kick after watching the movie, went and played Addicted on my bass. 

Since my last update, I have named my Bass. HERSHEL VON LICHTENSTEIN IS THE COOLEST BASS EVER! and i bought him a new strap this week. It's pink furry leopard skin and it's badass. Hershel's looking great. :) 

Also me and mella have decided to revive BENT WOOKIE! remember that name kids, it will be written in the stars one day! :P I'm going to be bassist, mella will be vox, naomi will be guitar and phoebe will be drums. Hopefully we'll get to writing this hols :P but yeah. 

also in news, paul is coming to brisbane! i haven't seen paul since AGMF and i miss him. (typing without capitals is the new black :P)

but yeah that's about it at the moment. i can't wait for SP's new album, picked up NFG's new album and it's fantastic, I couldn't be happier with the result of their hardwork on that record. It's just kick ass. Also anticipating The Used's new record, that should be great. Also heard a rumour they are touring here this year! :D WOOT! but yes i think tomorrow i might write some fanfiction. If i have the inspiration."

I had the weirdest dream the other night. I dreamt that some people and I were on a religious retreat, and we were studying Jeremiah 6. You know how sometimes in a dream, you see someone you know really well, they don't look like them but it just is them? well that was happening to me... but with a bible passage.. (weird, I know).. anyway so our retreat instructor told us to lie down in a ditch and pretend we were Scarlett from Jeremiah 6 (YES I AM AWARE THAT I AM REALLY WEIRD AND CREEPY). Anyway...so this retreat thing finished with us standing on this big platform that overlooked a night sky over brisbane and there was this huge storm. The thunder and lightning was right in front of me, someone came up behind me and told me that thunder was God clapping and for some reason that got me really really emotional.. Anyway I turn around and there is the mountains right in front of me.... but theres this big stadium thing and so i start walking towards it... and I see halfwayout and the used are playing a gig on the stage in there (what a fucked up lineup :P) So Jono from HWO comes up to me and he's like ""Hey kayla can you take my trombone back to your house for safe keeping?"" and i'm like ""Yeah ok"" so i grab Jono's trombone and i get my parents to drop me home where i deposit the said instrument and go back to the concert hall. I get there and halfwayout and the used have finished their sets.. so Jono comes up to me again and gives me an AllAccess like as a thankyou gift and i go backstage, and i'm wandering down all these corridors they're all twisting and turning and there are like people making out in them and stuff. I grab my bag and get a pen and my 'the used' cd out and i'm like prepared to get an autograph, so i keep walking down all these corridors and i get to this door and i open it and the used are in there all having showers.... then i woke up....

IT WAS FUCKING WEIRD! 

anyway so i decided to read Jeremiah 6 and see what it said.... This passage freaked me out : 

 ""The Lord said to his people, ""Stand at the crossroads and look. Ask for the ancient paths and where the best road is. Walk on it and you will live in peace.""

What do you guys think? :P"

Here it is

<lj-cut text= ""Emo Song"">

Lonely thoughts and sad memories 
She only had a paper heart, so thin and fragile 
Little girl in the transit lane, two tears shed and a prayer said for me 

She came walkin' in, her lonely eyes screaming hold me close 
A small smile on her face, I began to tremble, affraid that she would melt my lonely glass heart, filled with so many cold tears 

Fears let loose, crazed thoughts of you and me 
You move like a women on fire but burn so slow in my mind 

Affraid of you melting my lonely glass heart, you so scarred of its cold tears staining your all to think paper one 
So fragile yet longing for a touch 

All I wanted to do was brush the messy hair from your beautiful face, but I was worried your eyes would see into my shaking soul 

Love left for the taking and fears given over to 
Two lonely hearts, glass and paper, if you break mine I can only break yours 
Hold me now, hold me close

causes war. You're out to expose imperialism, militarism, and nationalism for what they

Author: xEmoButterflyx
Fandom: The Used
Pairing: Quinn/Jepha (My fave!)
Rating: PG-13 or R? for now anyway, rating will go up
Dedication: To the Used who inspire me in everything i do.
Notes: This is just a prologue, I want to know what you think, so i don't get enough reviews I will not continue. Hopefully this will not suck as much as i think it does.
Summary: Wow... another rape-fic in the Music Fictions communities, as if we haven't seen enough of those already. But I like seeing pretty punk boys in pain so it doesn't matter, i know i'm cliche :P 

<lj-cut text=""Depths"">

Quinn POV


A smile graced your lips and curved upwards into your cheeks, making the corners of your eyes crinkle. You strode towards me, wrapping your strong arms around my waist. Your hands came up to grasp the back of my head and pushed my lips towards yours. Your kiss was dominating and I could taste the alcohol on your breath, I quivered inside. Your lips lingered on mine as the passionate kiss ended. I smiled shakily at you, as your eyes suddenly lost those warm, deep blue depths and became frosty. Your lips curved into a sardonic smile.

'Oh Fuck,' I knew what was coming. I closed my eyes and braced myself for the inevitable. Your hand raised itself into the air and crashed down on my cheek-bone with frightening speed. My head whipped to the side and a whimper of pain escaped my throat as blue flashes exploded behind my eyelids. You laughed, and started sucking on my exposed neck. Your lecherous tongue, unwanted by my body, left a trail of spittle down my jugular. 

You ripped off the thin t-shirt that covered my torso and quickly set about unbuttoning my pants. I didn't struggle, you hated it when I struggled and you punished me when I did. You punished me untill I was no longer able to move. 

I watched as you started unbuttoning your own pants and I quickly felt bile rise in my throat. You kicked my knees out from under me and I dropped to the floor like a sack of shit. You kicked me in the side until I I rose to my knees, laughing at each tear that fell and each shriek of pain that emitted from my body.

You forced yourself into my mouth and I started to bite down hard in protest. Your expression grew dark and you reached down and pulled my hair warningly. I released the pressure and slowly started to suck you off. Soon after, you moaned one last time and shot your disgusting, vile fluid down my throat. I swallowed it with difficulty, and fell to the floor, dry heaving, hopelessly.

You kicked me once and I crawled shakily, over to the bed. You were saying degrading and hurtful things to me as you beat my defenseless body, but I couldn't hear you. I was somewhere inside my mind, where life was good. I didn't hurt constantly there, it was a place where you loved me and treated me like a boyfriend should. 

I lay there helplessly, comatose as you rolled me onto my stomach and forced your way into me. I felt this burning sensation in my lower abdomen and the pain got worse the faster you went.

I absently noted that someone was screaming as I listened to you moan.

""Oh Fuck, Quinn. You're so fucking tight, oh Jesus.""

As you had your fun and finished up, I thought I felt something go funny inside me as you collapsed and I realised the person screaming was me. I was writhing on the bed with your vile presence still inside me. 

As my sobs quietened down, I started to look around. You'd scrambled up quickly and had stopped your torrent of insults. Your gaze was directed toward the door and my vision gravitated there too. My tears welled up again and my face heated in shame as I saw my band mates standing at the door, shocked. They'd seen the whole thing, they stood there silently with shocked and disgusted expressions on their faces. 
I absently looked at the clock on the wall, 'Oh they're here to pick me up for practise.' I also looked down at the bedsheets. 'Theres a lot of blood on here,' I thought as my vision turned hazy and my world faded to black. 

Jeph POV


I stared in shock as Quinn's boyfriend, Nick, pulled out of him and noticed our presence. Quinn's pain-filled brown eyes wandered over to us and we watched as tears fell down his bruised and battered face, as he collapsed, exhausted, on the bed. Beside me, Branden's shock wore off and he covered his mouth as he rushed to the bathroom. The sounds of his retching reached my ears, seconds later.
Bert stormed over to Nick, a dark, clouded expression on his face. His hands twitched as he curled them into fists and punched Nick. For such a little guy, Bert could pack some power. As Nick fell, dazed, to the ground, Bert continued his assault and I felt my leaden feet move towards Quinn's prone form on the now blood-stained bed. His face was pale, he needed a doctor. 

I rushed to the phone and dialled the ambulance.

""Hello?""

""M-my friend, h-his boyfriend has just raped him, he-he's unconscious and bleeding. I don't know what to do. Please help him.""

I started to sob as the lady on the other end of the line asked me Quinn's address and other information, my answers automatic. She then informed me that an ambulance was on it's way. The phone slipped out of my numb fingers, as my knees buckled, sending my form crashing to the floor. 

I heard the sirens in the distance as Branden stood in the doorway, face pale and hands shaking. Bert's outburst of violence had ceased and all that could be heard was Quinn's gaspes of pain as his unconscious form twitched on the bed, soiled in his own blood.

End Chapter.
So tell me. Does it suck? Should i never write again? Is it good? Should I continue? I know I'm not original but i have fave character abuse syndrome and i can't help it. :P"

I'm back in brisbane, once again alienated from most of my friends....


I DONT"" FUCKING CARE ANYMORE! It was the icing on a cake of despair and misery.... and I couldn't deal. And i'm still not dealing too well and this year will be one of the most important of my life and i've only been at school for one day and i'm not coping with that already. I""M SICK OF THE PRESSURE TO FIT IN THE FUCKING MOULD! Sometimes i just wish i could go back to the days when life was good, simple and before all the shit that went on at school. The things i've seen imprinted on my mind forever, and they're never going away. Events that so drastically shaped who i am today. I'm more unsure of myself, a little more reserved. People rarely actually acknowledge when i say something important, but as soon as i say something funny, silly or cheerful, they're ears are open and so are their mouths, ready to make me the butt of their jokes once again. 
I feel so fucking ignored all the time. No one really listens to what i have to say, I love my friends dearly but i just constantly feel this extra barrier that keeps me from them. And i feel like i'm constantly cheating myself, sometimes i just wish i could tell my friends how they make me feel. but they don't really care, they don't bother too much with me. I guess the fact that i just stand there and not try to fit in doesn't help my situation."

THE BEST THING IS LOADS OF SHOPPING! i've saved up so much money for this trip, I can't wait. Hopefully I will get some fanfics done while i'm gone too. I'm thinking of writing a Benji/Tony or a Mike/Rob. But we'll see.

Happy New Year!

I went to a party the other night.... it was so shitty. No one came and all everyone did was smoke up and get drunk, and considering I don't do that stuff and the place was drowning in RnB and Hip Hop.... yeah well it was just not my style. But i slept at my best friend KT's house and that was fun we didn't get to sleep till 4, and we had to wake up at 7 so she could go to work... hhahhahaha i was sooooooo tired... 

No one ever comments in my journal so i'll assume no one reads it. so yeah i'll just write whatever i want cuz i aint going to offend anyone cause no one reads this... ahahahahhahah! :D good for me. 

Lord of The Rings kicks ass... the nerd shop at chermside made a huge model of Minas Tirith and were so proud of themselves they had wraiths and Gandalf and dismembered soldiers and the trolls. I thought it was great till i saw the sign, proudly stating ""The Battle Of Minas Tirath""... ahahahhahahaha.. i know how to spell Minas Tirith and I'm not a worker at the nerd shop! I wanted to run in there and prove the nerds wrong but the shop was closed and i was also running to get in line to see RoTK. Awesome Aweomse Awesome (etc.) movie :D"

I will dedicate
And sacrifice my everything for just a second's worth
Of how my story's ending
And I wish I could know if the directions that I take
And all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing
Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what i've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Help me carry on
Assure me it's ok to use my heart and not my eyes
To navigate the darkness
Will the ending be ever coming suddenly?
Will I ever get to see the ending to my story?
Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what i've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
So when and how will I know?
How much further do I have to go?
How much longer until I finally know?
Because I'm looking and I just can't see what's in front of me
In front of me
Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what i've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer"

Jack longs to be someone other than himself, he's searching for something but he doesn't know what it is he's searching for. he can't find the solace in his routine, he longs for change. unfortunately life doesn't always turn out the way it does in movies...."

"event","Its Christmas time and I feel like i'm not where I belong. I feel out of place, awkward, and extremely tired. I don't feel cheer. I just can't seem to lift my spirits this holiday season. I have no idea what is wrong with me, I get like this and I can never place what exactly it is that is wrong. I'm so very tired of holding my mask of happiness up for everyone. I've been doing so well lately, and I've slumped again. My shoulder muscles are tight, and i feel high strung all the time. I'm constantly worrying about everything. I'm worrying about EVERYTHING! 

I have horrible dreams that plague me, I don't get enough sleep because I swear I have some kind of insomnia. I don't know whats wrong, this always happens and i can't do much about it except try to distract myself from the feeling that something is missing inside me, hopefully, like every other time this happens, the distractions will be enough to numb the pain."

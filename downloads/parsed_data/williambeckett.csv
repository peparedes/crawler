"event","thanks to popular journal sites, my road to trendville was a short one. i do not know whether i am flattered or annoyed. in other news, andy is sick with mono so spencer from hi(p)v is filling in for him for the rest of the dates. i am really scared that this might make us suck a little but i think that as long as i act a little more homosexual on stage it will cancel out. oh well, as long as we go on before straylight run everyone will continue to think we are amazing. tomorrow is our last show with soco and i would totally act all ""thank god"" about it but they have a cult around here so i will refrain. maybe i should stop insulting the bands we are touring with??? if my research is correct my birthday is coming up soon, michelle nolan you are throwing me a birthday party"

Music Series: GET YOUR GROOVE ON, UTADA'S LISTENING PARTY
Please join Sephora and Island Def Jam for an evening of beauty-full music with international pop sensation, Utada. Come rock out to tunes from her new album ""This Is The One"", then listen to the stories behind the music from the artist herself.

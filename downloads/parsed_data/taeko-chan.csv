"event","I am feeling very empty today.  This Wednesday the master came home, and shortly after his wife and children arrived too.  We all seemed very happy to be together again.  Well, since I work weekdays we decided on Friday night to party a bit, to see about getting drunk a bit at least.  After a short period the wife went to bed so that she could care for the children in the morning.  Master and I stayed up, talking alot.  Towards very late in the night Master asked me to give him a blowjob. I told him that I was worried that if I did that I would be injuring the feelings of the wife, whom I have become very attached to, and even attracted to.  I planned on telling her on Saturday how I felt, but I did not want her to be upset as she has been feeling possessive of Master lately.  I do not recall all of the conversation that went on, but I answered truthfully about what I felt.  He said I was wrong though, and that it was only him who should worry about how she felt about it, not me.  I told him that if that was true then I would gladly do what he requested, but he said it was too late.  He said I am no longer to be a pet, but to be a part of the family and that is all.  

This means I can no longer acknowledge how I feel about the master and his wife.  He says that the only difference is that he asks instead of demands anymore.  The truth is the atmosphere around the house has been different ever since he got here.  He says he is uneasy but refuses to say how he could become more comfortable.  

I love him very much, and I love her almost as much.  I am not a lesbian but damn if she doesn't make me feel like doing things to her that I would never consider with another female, and have never thought I would feel that way.  It breaks my heart what he said, and that I can no longer allow myself to feel that way with them. 

I feel so empty inside, and I don't know what to do."

"event","It used to be that I could remember the time before the eviction, and it was vivid and bright.  All the good times that we had and the love that was shared at the house.   When the eviction happened I held onto these memories and used them to fuel my desire to change the situation back to the better.

But now as I am closer to getting everything back together then I have ever been all I can see are shadows and darkness, the lonely and insecure times I had at the old house.  In less then a week I will be moving in to a new house, getting it ready for when Master joins me on January 12.  Though his wife has decided to end the pet relationship, Maser has since the eviction said that this is his house and he will decide what is going on.  And also since them he and the wife have been quarreling quite a bit, and even talked of divorce.  

Master asked me quite frankly a few months ago how I felt about the wife calling off the whole arrangement.  I said I was afriad of hurting the wife's feelings, but that I very much was happy with the pet situation.  I am always working to better myself for Master, to please him in any way he wishes.  

And I have thought about it alot, what I truely want is to be there for Master, in every way that he wants.  But I am afraid of how rough it is going to be."

"event","The Wife just dumped all of her emotional garbage on me, and man it was a doozy.  She is very depressed and is not really seeking to blame it on others but has made me feel utterly worthless just by saying it all.  She obviously doesn't like the fact that the Master uses me for sexual things, as she repeated many times in her ranting that she feels so worthless because she is so easily replaceable.  Of course that makes me feel horrible because I am who she is referring too.  She laments the current state of the house, saying that she hates working because baths are forgotten, the kids aren't read to, and one of the children isn't getting schooled.  Now I know there are some things I am not good at yet, but I stil try my hardest to get everything down.  The way she said it though made me feel like all I do is neglect the children.  I am trying to balance the children, the chores, and my new job all in one, and it is not easy for me.  No matter what I say though, I guess I am not doing well enough in her eyes. I try so hard to please her.  She even said she was not sure if I was just corageous or Stupid because I live the way I do, and that... The way she was talking to me really hurt.  I know she is depressed, but it still hurt anyway.

Now she has me really depressed too.  I hope I can be more cheerful before Master wakes up, or he might wonder what is wrong.  I don't really want to talk about this him."

"event","I am a big, whirling ball of emotion today.  I have several negative emotions swirling around vieing for the top spot.  As the day that Master goes into MEPS draws ever closer, I worry about what is going to happen afterwards.  Silly fears really, but I worry he won't like me anymore.  Already I am not as pretty or talented as the Wife, but I work very hard.  Master has been acknowledging this but he is so strained and tired lately from working out to get him in shape for Basic training.  He will be gone approximately 5-6 months in Basic and AIT, and I hope to have a very pleasent surprise for him when he returns.  I want to work out to get down to 126lbs before he comes back.  That is over 100 pounds I have to lose!  Much hard work but for Master I will do anything.  He really likes women with smaller figures and big breasts and long hair.  I am going to grow my hair out again, but this time take really good care of it so it is healthy and doesn't look half dead.  My hair is shiny and soft now, if I work hard with it, it will stay that way when it gets long.  Long hair is a pain but for Master, anything.  I am going to try and see if the Wife can teach me more cooking, and she is going to teach me to drive.  Realizing how much work I have to do to make myself better makes my ego drop a bit though.  I always had a low ego.  But I will get through it, I know I can. 

I am going to write Master almost every day, if not every day, that he is in Basic.  I plan to make it a habit.  I will miss his training though, I am always eager to learn more and it will be sad that he will not be here to help me.  I feel sorry for the Wife because this is going to be a very long time that he is going to be away from here, the first time he will be away from her for so long.  I don't know how well she will handle it, but I will be here to help support her.  

Already for some reason I feel better.  Maybe I should use this blog more often to work out my feelings."

"event","Oh the shit has really hit the fan lately.  Because Master is out of funding for his book, he finds that he must do something to get money, and unfortuately the only guarenteed job where we live is the Military.  This is horrible for him and I have been trying to find every way that I can so that he does not have to go, but I find everything lacking.  It hit home really hard today when I was going to change the baby and found that we were just about out of babywipes, and not enough money to get more.  I was donating plasma to get small ammounts of money but it ended up making me really sick when I was not recovering from the donation quickly enough.  Now I am barred from donating for a little while.  The wife is attempting to get into the military too but she has alot more wieght to lose than Master does and it will not prevent Master from going in.  If I did not weigh so much, and if I did not have all this hardware in my back I would do it myself just to prevent Master from going in.  If he goes into the army he will lose the creative spark that fuels him writing his books.  He was so close too.  I cry for the dream that is about to die, and with no one to see it go.  

I love you Master, and I will write to you every day while you are gone.  And I will lose the weight like you want me to, and when you come back I will be thinner and pretty with long hair.  But I shall miss your hugs, and the way you smell, and the lectures you give me teaching me how to be a better slave for you.  I won't forget what you taught me, and I will work hard.  I want you to be proud of me when you finally get to come home."

"event","Please forgive me, I felt like letting my feelings about The wife out so this is rather long.

********************************************************************************

Well, she is still a person who causes me some anxiety.  I know her and feel as though she is as close as a best friend or sister to me.  Family to me when I have none.  However, it did not used to always be this way.

Before the master made me his pet, I was working for him.  For almost a year I worked very hard at improving myself and doing the work that he had for me.  The house we lived in together, Master, the wife, their children, and I, was pretty peaceful most of the time.  However it was not all harmony.  Many years ago, before the wife met Master, I was dating Master.  I was a much different person then, self centered and rude, but Master put up with me.  I fell in love with Master but betrayed him for something foolish.  He then met the Wife and married her.  The Master though thought I had much potential, and talked about me alot.  After he saved me, he convinced the wife to bring me into the house as a worker for them because I had no home, and nowhere to go.  

The wife however had not had such a good time of life before meeting and marrying Master.  Many women that she met were conniving backstabbing bitches always out to steal their man.  The wife also had an anger problem, and thought that I was out to get Master as my husband and boot her out of the picture.  This thought was fed by the fact that Master talked about me so much.  So she hated me, before I even came into the house.  I tried my hardest to make her a friend, oblivious to the fact that she hated me so much.  I was often a source of their arguments.  If Master gave me a compliment, she would go off on him.  It was not a nice situation.  I learned to watch what I said and what I did around her to make sure that there was no conflicts.  She actively campaigned Master to kick me out of the house over the littlest failures.  Every attempt I made to reach her, to make her see I was not a threat failed.  I was devistated.

Recently though, about a month before I became Master's pet, she started to change.  She had decided somewhere inside of herself that she was not acting like the person she wanted to be, and she has changed much for the better.  Shortly after her change Master proposed the idea of making me his pet to her, which surprised me too.  I still had feeling for Master, strengthened by the fact that he saved my life.  But because it was not right to show my love for him, I never did and hoped it would fade.  Now I am glad it didn't.  I enjoy my place in this world, more then I ever have in my entire life.  There are a few things I still have to get used to, but for the first time in my life I am truely content.

The wife's attitude towards me seems very friendly now though.  I do not interact with her nearly as often as I interact with Master.  In my position the way he wanted it was he takes care of all my needs and I do whatever he says whenever he says it.  The wife is an authority and I take orders from her, but Master rules over all, and if what she wants conflicts with what Master wants, it is Master first.  The wife does not worry about this much and likes it this way because she does not have to worry about my needs.  I am a big help to her as well with the children and the housework, many things she used to do herself before the pet arrangement was made because her attitude was such she did not think she could trust me very well with her children.  

Since then we have gotten along much better, but I am worried about the wife.  I wonder if someday she will not revert back to the behavior that she had before, when she hated me and did not want me around Master.  I still find myself hiding from her, not that I don't tell her the truth, but I worry that I will do something to make her mad and I am carefull about what I say or do.  (such as the strictest interpretation of the rules that were established.)  I overdo how careful I am sometimes, and it can make it harder to talk to her.  She has explained to me why she was that way, and her feeling towards me and my position, but I am still scared sometimes.  What if I make a mistake and lose this happiness I have found?   

I am working hard so that this is not a problem anymore, but I hope I don't have some many times that I fail him in the future!"

"event","I keep meaning to update this but usually I am too busy to get a chance.  Tonight though I have the house to myself and the children, who are taking a nap.  If master found out about this journal I think he would be quite upset.  But sometimes you need someone to talk to...

I love master dearly but I know I am not perfect.  I wish sometimes I were though.  I have failed to do what master wanted me to do three times this week.  Not only did I severely dissappoint the master but now I don't get what I want.  I feel very sad and lonely today because I have not been touched in over a week.  :(  I have not been physically touched or rewarded by master in over a week.  

This makes me feel very sad and lonely.  I hear him and his wife talking about thier sex life to their friends and such, but I have not even recieved a pat on the shoulder.  Even small physical or social interactions are important to me. I miss the feeling of his touch, the sound of him telling me good job.

It is making me very sad, and if they ask me what is wrong I cannot tell them.  It borders upon breaking a rule that is set, and I have done poorly enough already."

"event","Sometimes it is so hard to do what the master says, but I always seem to manage.  He wore me out this morning and now wants me to stay up and take care of the children while he and the wife sleep.  *Yawn*  The children are sweet though.  And my stomach is upset for some reason.

I wish I could curl up in my room and sleep.  Things are going well today.  He seemed to be pleased with me this morning, and that gives me a nice warm fuzzy feeling.  I worry though that maybe I am not doing all I can, so I am going to strive to work even harder for him.  

The wife did something that hurt my feelings though.  I am not really sure how to talk to her about it.  Last night we were playing around and laughing, and she starts bringing up my shortcommings and laughing about them.  She laughed and so did he but I don't think she noticed I got quiet.  I am all too aware of where I fall short and I don't need to be reminded, let alone laughed at for it.  I think I will pass talking to her about it unless it happens again.  I would hate to offend her, and I don't think it is my place to bring that up."

"event","My self confidence seems to be the biggest problem I am having with this.  He says that he is going to teach me to be better, and he is even going to train me in martial arts (of which he is damn good at) so that I can lose weight.  But when I think about it, if I compare myself with his wife I fall short in every category.  Just today I was taking care of their children and when I was bringing one of them some oatmeal I dropped the bowl and got it all over the kitchen.  I am such a klutz.  It took me a half hour to make sure that all the oatmeal was cleaned up and there was no glass on the floor.  The wife will not be pleased about this, it is not the first time I have broken dishes.  

Little things always happen to me all the time like that, like when I do laundry I could take the utmost care to do it right and have something come out with bleach spots on it.  Fortunately that is not often though.  

And panzer667 you said this sounded like an anime.  That made me smile because it gets even worse if you hear the whole story.  The reason I agreed to do this is not only because I love him, but also because he saved my life.  If it wasn't for him I would not be here, and that's part of the reason why I love him so much.

I think things will go well if I work my hardest, so that someday I can help him make his dreams come true.  That's all I wish."

"event","I have come upon a strange situation and I feel that I must talk about it and still retain my anonymity.  So I turn to the mass media and hope that maybe someone out there can sympathise.  My situation is hard to explain so please bear with me as I lay it all out and see if that helps.  

Recently I have found myself in a very odd position, and I an getting such horrible feelings of inadequacy that I wonder sometimes if I wouldn't just be better off leaving the situation.  Unfortunately that is not an option though.  You see, I am now the ""Pet"" of a man I am very much in love with.  He is married, and his wife even approved of me before he accepted me into the household.  

Now that is strange enough to digest but let me explain.  At one point I was dating this man, then we had a breakup and he found someone he married.  A few years later I come across him again and start working for him.  Well sad to say my feeling for him did not die down much during the two years of separation.  I did the honorable thing though and justly kept the feeling to myself and did my best to work my hardest for him.  I love the man dearly and I guess he saw through what I was hiding.  A week ago he approached me and discussed the whole Pet idea.  Basically I would become his property, totally subservient to him.  In return I would recieve food, clothing, anything I needed or wanted.  I just would have to do whatever he says, including sexual acts with him.  And his wife was in approval of this.  Truthfully I liked the situation, and agreed.

The problem is though that I am horrible at everything I do.  I cannot cook, I am only passable at taking care of children, I do decent housework and laundry but often make mistakes, I break things on accident, and sexually I was a virgin until recently and cannot even preform well.  His wife is much better at everything.

The only thing I am good at is trying very hard to do my best.  Often though that is not enough and I end up hurting someone or breaking something.  I don't know what to do or how to improve.  And it hurts me emotionally to think I would do something to offend him.  

I am not sure what to do, but I think the best thing is to try my hardest.  Maybe one day he will tell me he is pleased with me."

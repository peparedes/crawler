"event","I looked back at all of my old entries and comments that I have made on other peoples LJ's.... wow... things have changed so much. but even though it's bad why things had to change, I'm glad it happened :) Everything has made me see everything and everyone in a new light. I used to be the girl that wanted everyone to like her... I used to be the girl that dreamed of a 'perfect' love, and a perfect romance to go with it and that perfect life...

But now I'm the girl that says fuck it. You have to be perfect to find someone great to 'love' you, and I'm not... So I say fuck it all. And fuck everyone to.It's about time I live for me and no one else. I have my own issues. My own needs. I want to have fun. I want to get drunk and do stupid things. I want to get high and escape myself and all of this thought bullshit.

But most of all I want to be happy...

and I think I am now... yeah...it's hard at times... but I now know I could never feel more happy.

I'm happy.

So fuck all of you :)

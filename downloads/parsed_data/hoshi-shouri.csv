"event","This is the first time in my life I've ever taken a real interest in politics and felt invested and really American.&nbsp; I realized it's because I've never been able to relate to any of our presidents.&nbsp; This time, I can, and I actually <em>feel </em>like a tiny piece of this country now.&nbsp; I've always had a personal patriotism, but since taking part in this election, it's the first time I've actually felt <em>proud </em>to be American.&nbsp; I feel so fortunate to have had a hand in an amazing historical turn our country has taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnitude of&nbsp;this time&nbsp;is almost overwhelming.<br /><br />Listening in history classes, I took in all the information, but could never really understand how people could feel so passionately about something that they would go out on a ledge for their beliefs.&nbsp; After this year's election, and the atrocity of that Proposition 8 passing, I understand.&nbsp; When something is so much bigger than our individual selves, when it's to better not only our generation, and today, but the future of our country, our children and even the world, people find the courage to reach beyond their grasp and do their duty in striving for a truly free and equal America, in all aspects.<br /><br />It's a great time to be alive.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""The Inagural Address"">My fellow citizens:<br /><br />I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition. <br /><br />Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents. <br /><br />So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans. <br /><br />That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.<br /><br />These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land - a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights. <br /><br />Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America - they will be met. <br /><br />On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. <br /><br />On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics. <br /><br />We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.<br /><br />In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted - for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things - some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.<br /><br />For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.<br /><br />For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.<br /><br />For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn. <br /><br />Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction. <br /><br />This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.<br /><br />For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act - not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do.<br /><br />Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions - who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage. <br /><br />What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them - that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works - whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account - to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day - because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.<br /><br />Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control - and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart - not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.<br /><br />As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more. <br /><br />Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.<br /><br />We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort - even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.<br /><br />For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus - and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace. <br /><br />To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West - know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.<br /><br />To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.<br /><br />As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment - a moment that will define a generation - it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.<br /><br />For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate. <br /><br />Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends - hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism - these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility - a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.<br /><br />This is the price and the promise of citizenship.<br /><br />This is the source of our confidence - the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.<br /><br />This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed - why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.<br /><br />So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:<br /><br />&quot;Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].&quot;<br /><br />America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.</lj-cut>"

"event","So I clicked on the username of a person who left a fairly tacky comment in Toshi's journal (in my opinion) and to my horror found that their entire journal consisted of nothing but quizzes, surveys, and bullshit of that nature.  Which I realized is usually all I update with.  So I apologize and promise that never again (or at least a substantial amount of entries from now) will you have to read about what color I am.  lmao

Wow, when was the last time I updated?  I forget.  I'm just too drained when I get online now it seems to do anything but talk to Dylan.  Which is really the main reason I get on anyway.  I'm excited I get to see him again for Spring Break.  Next month.  haha  It's funny how little time we've actually BEEN together, when we've been going out.. wow, six months now!  Almost seven!  hahaha  Yay!  ^____^

School is going again, I get to take Dramatic Structures and Genres, Directing, Introduction to Psychology, and Fundamentals of Printmaking.  And then I work in the shop Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  I hate school still.  Printmaking is fun, but art always is.  It's a lot of work though!  I never realized!  I don't know how Harley did this for so long!!  I mean, it's fun, but maaaaan!!  I'm messy enough without adding ink to the equation.  :/  But yeah, I hate school.  And I'd REALLY like to go audition for ADV (especially since I know people in the theater department who work there, and that just frustrates me) but I feel so unsure of myself as to how to go about it, and if I'm even good enough.  I feel like it's been so long since I've gotten to act in anything, I'm not sure I still remember how to do it.  I'm afraid I've forgotten basic Acting 1 things that I should always have engrained in my brain.  Sometimes I wonder how excited I even still am about theater.  If I even have the drive to try anymore.  I feel so small.

Oh I also forgot to mention how much I hate Directing.  haha  The faculty member teaching the class is one of the only members who knows my name, and it's because she hates me.  lmao  Yay for me!  I hate going to that class and listening to her talk about herself and how great she is for an hour and a half.  I hate how everyone fawns over her and laughs at shit that isn't even funny, just because they think sucking up to her will make her love them.  I hate the theater department here and how full of themselves they are.  And I hate that I don't fit in at all.  Not that I wish I were like any of them, but I wish SOMEONE would at least say hi to me or learn my name.  (It's not a hard name to remember.)  I eat lunch alone in the hallway by the mainstage because I don't even want to be around those people.  THAT is ridiculous.  There's ONE guy that says hi to me everytime he sees me, and I don't even know HOW he knows my name, but that always makes me happy.  I just can't believe how unhappy I am at this school.  Maybe I just should have stayed at Sam.  I skipped school two days this week.

Wow, I think this entry is depressing enough, so I guess I'll just stop here.  haha  Pizza's going to be here soon, and Dylan will sign on in a bit, and that'll cheer me up.  He always does.  ^_^"

I auditioned for A Midsummer Night's Dream this morning.  All I did was a sonnet.  It went fairly well.  Yay for eye contact with the director.  lmao  Although, I wrote her a note last year, not realizing she was staff, so... needless to say I hope she doesn't remember that.  hahaha

Now I have lots and lots of graphic design homework to do today.  I'm going to get my project 2 done first, then my sketches for Tuesday, and the study for my Logic quiz on Monday.  I'll probably do more of that tomorrow too, just to make sure I pass it.  I am thinking about watching One Pound Gospel while I eat lunch, and making a phone call before I get started though....  haha

Justice League, Inuyasha and Wolf's Rain tonight!  Woo!  I love Saturday.  ^_^

So I'm back in school, and it sucks sucks sucks.  I barely have time to eat lunch anymore between all my long ass art classes, and working in the shop as a carpenter, but at least I get paid for that.  Still though, I'm going to have so much art homework, it's going to blow my mind.  I've already had to drop my art history class, because the professor changed the class from Monday/Wednesday to Monday.  And that's it.  And it's all webct/study on your own/watch me fail the class bullshit.  So that's no more as of an hour ago.  Just Graphic Communications, Color, Logic, and Human Origins.  Whee.  #1 slacker, right here baby.

Uhhhh.... summer summer summer is over over over, but that last bit of it was amaaaaaaazing.  haha  Greatest concert ever, super fun week in NYC with wonderful people, and lots of fun making fun of retarded otaku in Baltimore with Acreses.  hahaha  I'm excited I get to see them again next week!  ^_^  Their birthday is tomorrow too!  Lucky them, I have to wait until October...  :/

Let's see, let's see... make this a little personal I guess...  uhhh...  I'm really unconfident in my abilities as a carpenter, and I feel like a fake art student because I'm not taking it seriously, and why should I, I'm an actor...  I'm freaking out about my course load for the first time in my life... for some reason no matter how much sleep I get I'm still exhausted all day...  I have to work through the anime showings on fridays.... and I hate the two hour commute I endure daily, though Mr. Mayer certainly helps.  haha  Okay, QUIZ TIME!

<P><IMG src=""http://hometown.aol.com/starling63/painting1.jpg""></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Click for massive Takahashi goodness!""></P>
<P><IMG src=""http://hometown.aol.com/ehins247/painting2.jpg""></P>
<P>Here's a closeup of the large One Pound Gospel panel.&nbsp; It was the first one I did, so I was really nervous about screwing up getting started right away.&nbsp; I had a lot of trouble with the ink I used NOT drying, and smudging a bit, but I kind of like the way that looks on this one now.&nbsp; This is probably still my favorite one.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://hometown.aol.com/ehins247/painting9.jpg""><BR>Here's Angela.&nbsp; This is the only larger one with the word bubbles in it.&nbsp; I was trying to avoid them, but it works for this one.&nbsp; I knew I wanted a panel with the cross thumping over like that.&nbsp; I'm still not really sure about the colors I used, but my cousin really liked them.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://hometown.aol.com/ehins247/painting10.jpg""><BR>Lum and Ten were the last ones I painted, since they're actually on the large 'background' canvas.&nbsp; Painting them was a bit of an afterthought, but I really like the way they came out.&nbsp; The flash came out a bit odd on this shot.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://hometown.aol.com/ehins247/painting3.jpg""><BR>For whatever reason, the flash bounced off the texture of the canvas on their faces, it doesn't actually look exactly like that.&nbsp; I knew this was the panel I wanted to use though, so I'm lucky it's one of the only Inuyasha manga that I own.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://hometown.aol.com/ehins247/painting8.jpg""><BR>This was the second one I did, so I wasn't really sure what I was doing still.&nbsp; I really like the way it came out though, espeically Soichiro.&nbsp; My fat little Piyo chick could be better, but it's really hard to draw on canvas!&nbsp; And a few weeks after I thought I was done with the whole project, I actually went back and painted over Kyoko with a lighter flesh color.&nbsp; I'm much happier with how she looks now.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://hometown.aol.com/ehins247/painting4.jpg""><BR>I really like the way this scenario looks.&nbsp; I don't think it really makes sense unless you know Ranma, but I still think it's cute.</P>

<P>I'm really, really happy with how it came out.&nbsp; My teacher didn't really know any of the characters, but he still really enjoyed it too.&nbsp; He said it was nice how it still told a story and characters in the main panels appeared and could be pointed out in the background collage.&nbsp; Everyone I showed it to thought it was really neat, but it didn't mean anything to them.&nbsp; It means something to me, but I don't want to be the only one to enjoy it.&nbsp; That's why I'm giving it to Harley and Dylan for their birthday.&nbsp; I know they'll really appreciate it.&nbsp; Probably more than anyone else ever could.&nbsp; I made it FOR both of them anyway.&nbsp; As soon as I had the idea in my head, I knew if it came out well, I was going to give it to them.&nbsp; So I was thinking about both of you the entire time I was painting it.&nbsp; You'd better give it a good home though!&nbsp; Whenever I actually get it TO you.&nbsp; ^_^</P>

"event","Wow, that was a fun week, and now I'm back home, bored as ever.  haha  School starts on the 23rd, so there's something to look forward to...   :/

I could go through every day that I was gone, and recap all the fun I had, but since Oshi worked so hard on her page, <small>and I'm incredibly lazy,</small>  I'll just link to it.  ^_^  http://oshidori.dyndns.org/nyc-rw.html

The only thing she didn't cover, were the four days before New York that Dylan was here with me.  And that's because she wasn't here!  haha  It was a lot of fun though, I was really surprised that it wasn't 'weird' at all, between any of us.  It was like we'd all been friends for a long time, which while we've been talking to each other online for a bit, isn't quite the same thing.  haha  Talking on the phone helps, I guess.

But Dylan, he's great.  I was really happy with how things went while he was here, that was the most fun I've had in a very long time.  And man, that concert.  That was the best concert I've ever been to, in my life.  haha  It was amazing.  And it was the company that probably only added to how great that night was.  I was really nervous right before he arrived, and by 'right before' I mean standing in baggage claim waiting for him.  haha  He's exactly how I imagined he would be though.  Well, better, of course, because I couldn't have imagined him <i>exactly</i>.  I guess I just mean that it wasn't scary, or disappointing at all.  Every moment with him was fantastic, and I'm sad that entire week is over now!

New York and Baltimore were great as well.  Oshi and Dru are really pretty up close in real life.  I mean, I knew they were attractive from pictures, but I didn't expect them to be sooooo pretty!  hahaha  And it was the same with them, everything was completely natural and comfortable.  I had so much fun getting to see parts of New York that I might not have otherwise, and her friends and brother and fiancee were so much fun as well.  I got to ride a lot of trains, which I've never done before!  haha  I was a little nervous about meeing Harley in Baltimore though, because I hadn't really talked to him much before getting to meet him, but he's great too.  I think some of the most fun I had was just hanging out in their room Saturday night watching cartoons with Dylan and Harley.  It would have been great to get to hang out with all four of them all together more often, maybe we'll have to take another trip together somewhere sometime.  ^_~  haha  Because I had a ton of fun with all of them, but the convention itself was sort of 'blah.'

I miss everyone now though!  haha  It sucks.  But I'm really glad we all got to spend some time together, and I'm insanely happy that we all got along so agreeably!  hahaha"

I want to show everyone my art final, but there are a couple people who I don't want to see it yet.  When I get back I will, because then they will have seen it.  I'm pretty proud of it.  I can't stop staring at it.  haha

Well, you'd think being done with summer school (All A's by the way) would free up more of my time to waste online, but not so much.  I've been cleaning, and cooking, and babysitting my dad while my mom goes out of town.  And now the week of summer I've been awaiting for nearly three months is finally here!  AAAAHHHHH SO EXCITED!!  ^_^

Speaking of which, I have to go clean the upstairs bathroom.  Not that cleaning it will make it any less ugly.  :/

And I don't really see the point in getting <i>too</i> personal on here.  I <i>tell</i> the people the things I want them to know, my whole life isn't EVERYONE'S buisiness.  :p  Not to be rude, just how I feel.

Mama's been making me clean all day, it sucks.  I had to go through all the VHS tapes upstairs.  She wants me to hang up all my clean clothes, which I do need to do, but it's sooooo tedious!  I've been wanting to watch Labyrinth for DAYS now, especially since I bought the new collector's edition.  Thanks for bringing that to my attention, by the way, Rachel.  ^_^  I also need to get started on my final project for painting.  It's going to be.... interesting.  haha  I really want it to turn out well too, so hopefully it can be a gift for a couple someone's.  I just need to work out a few more of the technical details, and decide on a few more things.  I'm really, really excited about it though.

That's really all I've got.  I'm very excited about the end of this month!  haha

I still have to pack too, Akon tomorrow.  I'm not really all that excited about going anymore, but I gotta pimp Dru's art and I do want to see DAI.  I guess I'll just wander around by myself and try to keep from spending money for the rest of the time.  It should be fun though.  I hope.

<lj user=""purpleusagichan"" /> stole my art towel.  :p

"event","My grandmother died about half an hour ago.  I don't have anymore grandparents.  I was prepared for it, but I'm still shaking.  I'm glad I got to talk to her, and say goodbye and everything.  I'm really going to miss her, and I may be the only person who does, which sucks.

Brian's moving to Florida next week.  He's going to save up for a car and then go to California to write and, hopefully, finish school since he's so close to being done.  I'm going to miss him, he's the best friend I've got here.  I wish him luck though.

I'll probably never be able to watch that Raising Helen movie again after today.  It was cute though, for anyone else interested in seeing it.

Well, I should probably end on a good note at least.  Somehow, doing nothing, I've managed to go down two sizes.  So now I'm a 4 instead of a 6.  And I start summer school tomorrow.  So maybe <i>actually</i> working out will result in some muscle.  And hotness.  haha

I hate that I suck at being a housekeeper!""  lmao  And then she goes ""Why are you laughing?!  I do!  And I didn't teach you all correctly, and you all suck too!""  :p  hahahaha

I actually did stuff today.  I went to the post office and cvs (for the first time ever) and the mall and chik fil a, but only for sweet tea.  Yay alone day.  I was going to go see Day After Tomorrow by myself too, but I had a headache.  Still do.  :/

I bought some clothes and Get Backers vol 3, Tuxedo Gin vol 6, and Angel Sanctuary vol 1 (thanks Oshi :p).  I take a really long time when I shop by myself.  Like, forever.  haha  I go really slowly.  That's how I am though.  *shrugs*  It was nice to get out of the house for once.

I woke up this morning sometime before 10.  Darth's alarm clock was going off in his room, and his door was locked, which meant he wasn't home.  So I had to call him to tell him to come home and turn it off and figured I might as well just get up.  woo for getting up at a decent time.  Man was I tired though cause I didn't fall asleep until almost 6 am.  Figure that one out.  I may take a nap in a bit, but CA wants to play isketch, so I'm off to do that.  woo!"

11.  omg it's Fukai Mori, but it's a MIDI FILE!!!  haha  I must've gotten it off the Inuyasha Companion.  It's actually not horrible.  haha

"event","<b>A Monkey In Time</b>

On a smarmy and speedy morning, Star sat under the moon. It was Valentine's Day and she was all alone. Her ear ached in sorrow for the secret love that she could never share. How could she expect Miroku to love someone with a luminous automail?

Anxiously, she began to recite a poem she had composed. ""Ah, my love is like a slimy luxurious computer, all on a summer's day. I wish my Miroku would fly me, in his own shiny way...""

""Do you?"" Miroku sat down beside Star and put his hand on Star's cock. ""I think that could be arranged.""

Star gasped cunningly. ""But what about my luminous automail?""

""I like it,"" Miroku said stealthily. ""I think it's fluzzy.""

They came together and their kiss was like a circus peanut; ungodly, yet everlasting..

""I love you,"" Star said mysteriously.

""I love you too,"" Miroku replied and flew her.

They bought a Tiger, moved in together, and lived quietly ever after.

--------------------------------------------------

<b>Star and Miroku</b>
by William Shakespeare

Enter Star

Miroku appears above at a window

Star:
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the monkey, and Miroku is the Tiger.
Arise, fluzzy Tiger, and fly the smarmy pokeball.
See, how he leans his ear upon his cock!
O, that I were a glove upon that cock,
That I might touch that ear!

Miroku:
O Star, Star! wherefore art thou Star?
What's in a name? That which we call an automail
By any other name would smell as slimy
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say ""like a circus peanut; ungodly, yet everlasting.""
And I will take thy word; yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove short.

Star:
Swain, by yonder smarmy pokeball I swear
That tips under the moon the shiny computer--

Miroku:
O, swear not by the pokeball, the luminous pokeball,
That stealthily changes in its luxurious orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise luxurious.
Sweet, tardy night! A thousand times tardy night!
Parting is such speedy sorrow,
That I shall say tardy night till it be morrow.

Exit above

Star:
Sleep dwell upon thine ear, peace in thy cock!
Would I were sleep and peace, so quietly to rest!
mysteriously will I to my fluzzy automail's cell,
Its help to fly, and my slimy automail to tell.

---------------------------------------------------

<b>A Shiny Day To Fly</b>

Star stepped stealthily out into the fluzzy sunshine, and admired Miroku's cock. ""Ah,"" she sighed, ""That's a smarmy sight.""

Miroku climbed off the computer and walked quietly across the grass to greet his lover. Star patted Miroku on the automail and then tried to fly him anxiously, but without success.

""That's all right,"" Miroku said. ""We can try again later.""

""I'm just not luminous,"" Star. ""Not as luminous as the time we flew under the moon.""

Miroku nodded cunningly. ""We were speedy back in those days.""

""Our ears were younger, and we had a lot more fun with them,"" Star said. ""Everything seems slimy and luxurious when you're young.""

""Of course,"" Miroku said. ""But now we're short, we can still have fun. If we go about it mysteriously.""

""Mysteriously?"" Star said . ""But how?""

""With this,"" Miroku said and held out a tardy monkey. ""Just take that with some water and in half an hour, you'll be ready to fly.""

Star swallowed the monkey at once and sure enough, in half an hour, they were able to fly mysteriously. They flew like a circus peanut; ungodly, yet everlasting.. Three times.

And then the neighbour told them to get off his lawn.

-----------------------------------------------------

<b>Quietly Tripping</b>

Star tripped along mysteriously. She was on her way to meet her lover, Miroku, for Valentine's Day. She smiled to see a Tiger hopping along, carrying a pokeball in its mouth.

Star was almost under the moon when she came across a tardy cake, lying alone on a slimy plate. ""That must be a treat from my luminous bear,"" she said to herself, and tripped over to it. The cake looked shiny, so she ate it.

It gave her the most speedy tingling sensation in her ear. ""How unusual!"" she said and continued tripping to see Miroku.

When Miroku came out to meet her, he took one look and fell over.

""What is it?"" Star cried anxiously.

""Your cock! And your automail!"" Miroku said. ""They're fluzzy! Can't you feel it?""

Star felt her cock and her automail. They were indeed quite fluzzy. ""Oh, no!"" Star said. ""I'm a man!"" She, or rather, he started to cry. ""It must have been that tardy cake you left for me. Did you know what it would do?""

""I didn't leave you any cake,"" Miroku said. ""I got you a monkey. It must have been that smarmy man who lives nearby. He acts a little cunningly, ever since he flew a computer.""

""But how can you ever love me, now that I'm a man?"" Star sobbed.

""Well, I never knew how to tell you this,"" Miroku said stealthily, ""but I actually prefer men. And I think your cock is really short like that.""

""Really?"" Star dried his tears. Star kissed Miroku and it was an entirely luxurious sensation, like a circus peanut; ungodly, yet everlasting..

They spent the night having entirely luxurious sex, until the cake wore off suddenly.

Everything was rather awkward after that.

You know you want to.

And I only used Miroku because how embarrassing would it have been to have read ""Star admired Dylan's cock""?  Yeah, that's right.  Pretty darn embarrassing.  :p"

IY was good.  So was Wolf's Rain, as well as Gundam Seed.  Funnily enough, it was the third episode tonight, and I've only ever seen the first two.  It's the only 'Gundam' show I've ever been even remotely interested in.

"event","<P>So....&nbsp; I just got out of bed about an hour ago.&nbsp; :/&nbsp; Looks like studying all day just turned into studying all night.&nbsp; Apparently there were all these tornados and crap out here where I live too, <b>and I slept through all of it!!!</b> That'll happen when you have a room with no windows.&nbsp; (All those confused click <A href=""http://hometown.aol.com/starling63/hoshihome.html"">here</A>.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I had quite a bit of fun last night at the end of semester party for anime no kai.&nbsp; I haven't gotten to play video games in a while and it was nice to kick Fracois's ass.&nbsp; ^_^&nbsp;&nbsp; hahaha&nbsp; Although, I did want to beat down Eric at Super Bust a Move, and that never happened.&nbsp; Maybe sometime this summer.&nbsp; I can't believe he's only 18!&nbsp; I thought he was like 20-22ish.&nbsp; My little sister's just turned 18!&nbsp; So odd...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So I got into my car yesterday afternoon to head over to Oberlitzer Hall for the party, and I felt like changing cds for the two second drive over there.&nbsp; I wanted to hear something off one of my special John Mayer cds, so I'm looking for it, and it's not in the sleeve, it isn't in a different case, it's not in my backpack, and it certainly isn't in the player so I freak out for a second and call my mom to ask if there is&nbsp;a cd sitting in the driveway (because one of them slid out of the sleeve when I was getting into my car that morning, but I grabbed it) and she's like ""Yeah, it was in the grass next to the driveway.""&nbsp; And I'm like ""IS IT OKAY!?!""&nbsp; Yes, it was fine.&nbsp; Wooo&nbsp; I was actually scared there for a few minutes.&nbsp; Appallingly scared.&nbsp; Over a cd.&nbsp; See what you do to me?&nbsp; :p&nbsp; (You know who you are.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Another new Inuyasha tonight!&nbsp; Woo!!&nbsp; I've really got to get used to this Saturday night thing, I'm going to have to write it down somewhere so I don't forget like I did last week.&nbsp; :/</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I wrote another poem yesterday.&nbsp; Meh.&nbsp; Not my favorite.&nbsp; No title.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>----------</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Miles &amp; Coltrane</P>
<P>Miles &amp; Coltrane</P>
<P>All I ever hear about is</P>
<P>fucking Miles &amp; fucking Coltrane</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Mayer's singing about them</P>
<P>Matejka's writing about them</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong, they're brilliant</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But what of all the</P>

I go sit outside and think about all kinds of crap that <i>isn't</i> art homework.  <small>Mostly someone whose name begins with a lovely, semi-round, D.  -^_^-</small>

I'm on my dad's screename right now, so none of you lovelies can im me.  Believe me, I want to talk to you, I'm just trying to be a responsible adult here and I'm failing miserably.  If this week doesn't kill me, my father might for failing 2/5 classes.

I made dinner too.  Papa wanted Teriyaki Chicken, which I've never made in my life.  I whipped some up though, and DAMN if it wasn't the second yummiest dish I ever did make!  (The first being this shrimp and pasta thing.)  Seriously, it was awesome.  Especially considering I whipped it up from scratch.  I totally rocked that Teriyaki Chicken.  Oh yeah.  So at least if I accomplish nothing else today, I fed my family wonderfully yummy food.  And I built a bunch of stuff in crew this morning.  Woooo

Now about that art homework...."

Kent would let us out of art an hour early on the day I'm staying up at school because Brian's play's at 7 tonight.  Bastard!  Good thing he's hot or I might hate him a little.  Man, I was up until four in the morning finishing that homework.  It was so meticulous and tedious.  Arg.  And I wasn't even very happy with it once I was finished.  Stupid ink.  So yeah, up too late doing homework, had to skip my shower this morning because I overslept and now my hair looks bad.  :(  I'm so vain.  haha  Maybe when I get home tonight I'll hop in the shower and fix my hair all cute-like.  Then I can take those pictures I promised and I won't burn in hell for being a liar.  ^_^

So <lj user=""neuroticme"" /> is the best ever cause he's my FMA hookup.  Yeeah.  Oh, and I'll go to that poetry thing with you on Friday, you'll just either have to give me directions, or a ride.  haha  Directions I guess since I have to go to that officer dinner right after it.  I'm still debating on whether or not to change after the showing, or just wear semi-fancy clothes to school.  I really hate changing clothes in the middle of the day, so maybe I'll just do that.  Meh.  We'll see.  *so indecisive*

Oh man!  It's only 4:30!  I'm going to be here until 7!  And then I have to watch Brian's stripper play.  Ah well, I'm a good friend.  And he really is a good writer.  Plus one of his actors is reeeeally cute.  haha  Oooh, I'll see if he has his laptop when he gets back, maybe I can watch some FMA...  mwahaha  It's a plan.

So I went and got ice cream with Amy and Matt earlier.  Katy wouldn't go though, because she SUCKS!  :p  It was more fun than it should have been for me considering the two of them didn't really talk to me, but I don't usually go anywhere but school, home, or the drive between.  Yes.  I'm lame.  And I had a single scoop of margarita ice, if you're wondering.  It would have been better with tequila.  haha

I'm tired, but also hungry.  I guess I'll sign off in a bit and work on that homework a little more.  Maybe eat something.  Or just die.  Whichever comes first."

Last night during the show I watched FMA 5-8.  I even had three of the other guys on crew watching it with me.  That show is so great, I just love it.  And Francois' bringing me 1-4 and 9-12 tomorrow!!  I also downloaded all the manga Toriyama's World has translated, and I'm loving these characters.  I haven't been this excited about a show since Maison Ikkoku.  ^_^

I should be doing Astronomy homework right now.  Slacker, slacker.  I should also be studying for the makeup tests and final for that class.  Can we say cram?  I think we can.

I love Cirque du Soleil, but this Solstrom show is bad.  Like, William Hung bad.  Okay maybe not that bad.

Someone go buy me John Mayer sheet music.  Pweeeeeease?  *big weepy anime eyes*

I got my hair cut yesterday, I really like it.  It's...... well i guess the only word is sassy.  I'll probably have a picture later to show those of you who won't see me at school tomorrow.  If you care.  haha

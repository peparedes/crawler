"event","Marty wakes up at home with a huge hangover. He forces
himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple 
of aspirins and a glass of water on the side table. He sits down
and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed.
Marty looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotless, clean. So is the rest of the house. He takes the aspirins 
and notices a note on the table ""Honey, breakfast is on the stove,
I left early to go shopping. Love you."" So he goes to the kitchen 
and sure enough there is a hot breakfast and the morning
newspaper. His son is also at the table, eating. Marty asks, 
""Son, what happened last night?"" 
His son says, ""Well, you came home after 3 A.M., drunk and 
delirious. Broke some furniture, puked in the hallway, and 
gave yourself a black eye when you u stumbled into the door."" 
Confused, Marty asks, ""So, why is everything in order and so 
clean, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me?"" 
His son replies, ""Oh that! Mom dragged you to the bedroom, 
and when she tried to take your pants off, you said, ""Lady, leave 
me alone, I'm married!"" 

A self-induced hangover - $100.00 
Broken furniture - $200.00 
Breakfast - $10.00 
Saying the right thing - priceless"

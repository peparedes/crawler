I am updating this journal for the first time in ages, because I've been in prison.

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! I'm so ugly. Don't look at my photos pleeeeeze.

I want to say thanks to my dad for giving me my own computer and digital camera. Here's a photo of my room. The weather in Ontario is cold. I have nothing more to say.

So I found this old meme thing in my backlog of entries. Thought I'd run it again as an excuse to post for the 1st time in 18 months.

"event","Five years ago today, I was taking OOTP home from the bookstore.

I only got to Chapter 6 before my sister, who was ten and should've known better, spoiled the ending for me.

After finally finishing it a year later, it was my favorite. I found I could really identify with CAPSLOCK!Harry and I loved him not being really sure of who he is anymore.

I got into fanfic several months later, which was quite nice for me after the disappointment of HBP.


Eleven months ago today, I was taking DH home from the same bookstore.

I ended up liking it a lot, because 
a) it went back to focusing on the Trio
b) there wasn't much Ginny, who I didn't much care for in HBP (she seemed too Sueish in there, which is why I've only skimmed her parts when rereading it)
c) Dumbledore's backstory
and the little details I'd remembered loving so much, stuff like Potterwatch and Neville (and Kreacher) PWNing

But I hated Harry-crux, which diminished my liking of OOTP because the change in Harry's character ended up all being because Scar-crux was acting up. I also hated the unsolved Mystery of the Veil. Why introduce a non-cliched way of killing someone and then never bring it up again?

I think I love GoF the best, because we have the focus on the Trio and so many interesting little things too, like Voldemort's rebirth, the introduction of the Pensieve, the Quidditch World Cup, Harry's resistance to Imperius, things like that.

I still have my original copy and the strange memories accompanying it. I remember thinking the book smelled like Mexican food (yeah, I was a strange kid).

*goes back to wondering why Crouch didn't just turn Harry's toothbrush into a Portkey*

I'll end with this...in Soviet Russia, secret keeps YOU!"

*is not disableing comments on account of this is my first entry in a long time*

Here goes:

1. Why am I so attracted to your excess amount of knowledge? Sorry for making you do all the work on that Physics project last fall.

2. Quit spazzing about self-assessments, okay? We don't even have them for another month.

3. Dude, stop being such a jerk. Jokes about bodily functions during Shakespeare class are NOT FUNNY. Second grade was EIGHT YEARS AGO, for crying out loud.

4. You are the most ANNOYING kid in Geometry class. Try doing us all a favor and keep your mouth shut, okay?

5. *sarcastically* Thanks for being so OVERPROTECTIVE of me. You're the BEST.

6. Let's get something straight. That gift you gave me three summers ago was the cause of my lifetime hatred of Build-A-Bear and the Fourth of July. No more giving me gifts just because you feel sorry for me, okay?

7. I so did NOT appreciate your lesson on why drugs and alcohol are UBERLY BAD FOR YOU. I learned that stuff THREE YEARS AGO in Health class, and I would appreciate you not trying to teach all the students this stuff next year, though you probably will anyway.

8. *sarcastically* Thanks SO much for putting me in a CERTAIN BOOK CLUB four years ago and helping to fire a certain Spanish teacher three years ago. This is why I now greatly despise the place where you work.

9. Your daughter was the cause of much of my misery in elementary school. Thanks for nothing.

10. Dude, remember that drawing you did of that sculpture at the art museum four years ago? Why ON EARTH did you choose to sketch THAT sculpture, out of all the sculptures available to sketch? Were you OUT OF YOUR MIND?"

"event","I am quite happy that I actually remembered Hobbit Day (even though I recall reading that Hobbit Day is really the 22nd) because I completely forgot about Talk Like a Pirate Day this year (it's on the 19th, and, yes, it <i> is </i> an actual holiday, and I wish I had remembered to celebrate it because I am geeky like that). Must remind my Fantasy Literature teacher on Monday that Hobbit Day was on the 22nd, because it will amuse her.

In other news, I need to go to the library this weekend. That is where I am doing my community service for school this year, and my advisor is requiring me to get my supervisor to sign this Stupid Yellow Form That Is Required By Law (not that I know what the law is). My supervisor, of course, is nothing like Madam Pince, or else I would be doing my community service elsewhere. My advisor is also requiring me to ask all my teachers on Monday what homework I have not turned in to them. I must do this, or else he will kill me, and that would not be good. Also, my Physics class is the spawn of Satan (in other words, boring as hell) and I am only taking it because I need the credit. 

Normally, of course, I would be at school during this time, and therefore not updating my journal, on account of we can only do that at lunch, which ends at 12:45. However, today was a faculty retreat day, which of course means no school.

Now, without further ado, here are my newest Harry Potter musings that you have all been waiting for. Alas, you must click on the lovely LJ cut to see them.

<lj-cut> I do not have a FictionAlley username, but I follow the Can't Stand Remus/Sirius thread on there religiously. Recently, there was a very lovely post on there explaining how even though Remus/Sirius is Anything But Canon, the books are very pro-queer. The character of Remus Lupin, although not gay himself, shows what it is like to be prejudiced against because of something you have no control over. Argus Filch, as a Squib, is very much like a man who is gay and deeply ashamed of it. The Kwikspell letter in particular is eerily reminescent of a letter promoting an Ex-Gay Society (or How You Can Banish Your Satanistic Tendencies).

That being said, I think that the first time Alfonso Cuaron read book!POA, he misread 'brother' as 'lover' in the now-infamous line ""embraced Black like a brother"". That explains why both the Shrieking Shack Scene and the Werewolf-Transformation Scene in movie!POA were portrayed as they were.

"event","So I finished HBP a couple hours ago and I found that Rowling's writing style, which made the first five books so (for lack of a better word) 'magical', appears to have fallen by the wayside and deteriorated. It feels very odd to realize that this, THIS, is the new canon, and not some mediocre piece of fanfiction. I wish I could turn into an overpowering teacher and say ""I expected better from you, Ms. Rowling. See me after class.""

In reality, however, I'm going to cut JKR some slack. She is, after all, only human, and I got quite a good laugh out of Chapter Five. Still, I am sorely hoping that Book Seven meets her old standards, seeing as she won't have to deal with a pregnant woman's crazy hormones (in the words of my mom) when she writes it."

{squees like the nerdy fangirl she is rapidly becoming}.

In other news, I unfortunately did not finish <i> 1984 </i> this past week, and I will not be finishing it today, as I do not want to end up rushing through the rest of it, desperately trying to finish it in the final hours before HBP. I said I did not want to have to end up reading <i> 1984 </i> and HBP at the same time, but I just realized that the stories are so remarkably different that it will be quite simple to avoid getting the plots mixed up. 

That is all I have to say, at least for now. Oh yeah, one last thing. Does anyone know when my computer will stop being a git and actually allow me to access my memories?"

Must finish '1984' sometime in the next five days, on account of it will be too confusing to keep switching between '1984' and HBP, the latter of which I kindly request that you not spoil for me. I am sure you all know better than my little sister, who tragically spoiled OOTP for me two years ago, causing me to postpone reading OOTP beyond Chapter 6 until the end of last September.

In other Harry Potter news, I just recently realized what "" 'brotherly hug' my arse"" refers to, and I have an announcement to make regarding that.

The announcement is this: I would like to remind everybody that the HP movies are not canon, and should not be treated as such. Among other things, I do not believe canon!Remus has a grotesque (In My Opinion) mustache that (In My Opinion) causes him to resemble Hitler. Ditto for The Shoebox Project (it is not canon and should not be treated as such).

I have also begun to read HP fanfiction. I skip longer fics since I don't have the time to read them, and I skip the graphic ones since I don't care for them. I am also very picky about what ships I read, including slash. Two fics I particularily like are in my memories under 'The Late Night Visitor' and 'Slashy Ravenclaws'.

I haven't written anything of my own yet, but I do have an idea for a ficlet involving The Good But Rare Ship Of Neville Longbottom And Susan Bones. I will post said ficlet here if I actually manage to finish it. Wish me luck!"

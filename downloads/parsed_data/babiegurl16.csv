"event","well well well.. first day of class.. was ... ok? i guess? i cant believe i was actually late for my first class. o well, who will notice me walkin in when there's 1800 other people in a big convocation hall? i told myself yesterday that i would start talkin to sum ppl and actually start making friends---but i didn't.. well couldnt.. becoz think again.. i prolly wont see the person that sat beside me today till when? after that i had to kill 3 hrs time b4 my next class... it was a long time.. there was a point when i was strollin along the street feelin quite lonerish.. how sad.. 
now that i'm actually starting skool.. i dun feel that i want to leave home as badly, becoz all the fun from frosh is over and i realized that everyone's gona be quite busy w/ schoolwork anyways, that it wont matter where u live.. altho, sum ppl may disagree w/ that.. but if u cant tell, i'm tryin to convince myself to like toronto and like UT.. sigh*.. need to enjoy myself, i need to make my own fun"

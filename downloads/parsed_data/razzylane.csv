Sir Edwin Arnold (1832-1904)</b>

Somewhere there waiteth in this world of ours
for one lone soul, another lonely soul -
Each chasing each through all the weary hours,
And meeting strangely at one sudden goal;
Then blend they - like green leaves with golden flowers,
Into one beautiful and perfect whole -
And life's long night is ended, and the way
Lies open onward to eternal day.



<b> Anne Morrow Lindbergh, b. 1906 </b>

When you love someone, you do not love them all the time, in exactly the same way, from moment to moment. It is an impossibility. It is even a lie to pretend to. And yet this is exactly what most of us demand. We have so little faith in the ebb and 
flow of life, of love, of relationships. We leap at the flow of the tide and resist in terror its ebb. We are afraid it will never return. We insist on permanency, on duration, on continuity; when the only continuity possible, in life as in love, is in growth, in fluidity - in freedom, in the sense that the dancers are free, barely touching as they pass, but partners in the same pattern.

The only real security is not in owning or possessing, not in demanding or expecting, not in hoping, even. Security in a relationship lies neither in looking back to what was in nostalgia, nor forward to what it might be in dread or anticipation, but 
living in the present relationship and accepting it as it is now. Relationships must be like islands, one must accept them for what they are here and now, within their limits - islands, surrounded and interrupted by the sea, and continually visited and abandoned by the tides.

<b>Kaleel Jamison </b>

Relationships--of all kinds--are like sand held in your hand. Held loosely, with an open hand, the sand remains where it is. The minute you close your hand and squeeze tightly to hold on, the sand trickles through your fingers. You may hold onto some of it, but most will be spilled. A relationship is like that. Held loosely, with respect and freedom for the other person, it is likely to remain intact. But hold too tightly, too possessively, and the relationship slips away and is lost."

It feels so good to take a weekend to myself.  I worked a half day on Friday, then headed up to Detroit with Amanda and Katie to see Mr. James Blunt.  After a good dinner (with Baileys :p)we went to the show.  I can't wait for his next album.  There're gonna be a few really powerful songs on it.

I worked another half day Saturday, then saw V for Vendetta which was wonderful and went out to dinner again.  Then out for more Bailys haha. I normally head back up to school at this point in hopes of not getting too far behind on the homework, but since I'd given myself most of the weekend, why not take the rest?  So I stayed at my parents again and was able to get my oil changed for half the price it would have been to take it in.  :p

Spent Sunday morning working on my car with my brother, or more aptly keeping him company as he worked under the hood.  Took a nap lol.  Went out to dinner again.  Crazy!  I can't remember the last time I went out this much.  Then I got ready to head back up to school.  It's so bizarre to have my dad's car for the week.  I keep feeling like I left something at home, which I guess I did lol.  Though I do have to say that I'm a bit nervous about what the repair bill for my dear car will be...

But I've been in a bit of a who cares mood lately.  As is evidenced by the fact that I spent an entire lovely weekend in Monroe relaxing and catching up with people rather than hurrying back up to campus in an attempt to make some progress in the ridiculuous amounts of reading I have every week.  I'm not even sure how I'm going to pay for my car repairs yet...lol.  Let's hope it's not too bad.  *crosses fingers*"

I'm weirded out.  I really am.  They have cars that can park themselves now.  Are you kidding!?  If you can't park a car, you shouldn't be on the road.  Aside from which, I don't need a car that's operating of its own control - cause that's just creepy.  And to have a car that senses when an accident's about to happen?  For one, my eyes do a pretty good job of that, and for two it automatically applies the break once you lift your foot from the gas pedal (which presses against your foot telling you to lift it).  How is a car supposed to judge the conditions of the road?  The whole concept is just bizarre to me.

She now became this dough-faced little man standing by the blackboard, pink chalk in one hand, white chalk in the other.  On one side he had written, in large white letters, 
MUSLIM GIRL, and drawn a vertical line in the middle of the board.  On the other side, in large pink letters, he wrote CHRISTIAN GIRL.  He had then asked the class if they knew the differences between the two.  One was a virgin he said at last, after an uncomfortable silence, white and pure, keeping herself for her husband and her husband only.  Her power came from her modesty. The other, well, there was not much one could say about her except that she was not a virgin.  To Yassi's surprise, the two girls behind her, both active members of the Muslim Studens' Association, had started to giggle, whispering, NO wonder more and more Muslims are converting to Christianity.""

~Reading Lolita in Tehran

After you get done reacting to what you've just read, you start to think don't you?  How true is it that so many Christians don't live by the Bible?  Or choose only those rules they feel applicable to themselves as an individual?  We all hear stories about how 'corrupt' students at Christians schools are and how prevelant drug use is.  We also know those who seem to lead an upright Christain life.  But how many of them suffer from vanity or selfishness?  How many lie or cheat in the little things because they ""don't count""?  Just because as a whole they are viewed in a positive light, doesn't mean the deviations should be ignored.

By the same token, how many women from Middle Eastern countries come to the states to study, then before leaving, have surgery so that their virginity is 'restored'?  Hey, just as good as new.  Why bother telling anyone the truth?

There are so many facets to the image each individual presents to the world that are false or that painted over to appear positively, that we choose to ignore.  Is it because, well, they're a good person.  Or maybe you don't want to hurt their feelings.  Or maybe it's never going to change.  Or maybe you're guilty of the same or similar actions and let he who is without sin cast the first stone.

But why is so much duplicitousness accepted as a part of everyday life?  Many of the above traits are done in ignorance or because a person can justify within themselves that they still have a strong faith and don't need to ask forgiveness because whatever act they have committed and continue to commit isn't 'wrong' since it is socially acceptable.  No one has ever personally called them out to tell them otherwise, so they look to the examples sitting on the pews surrounding them and tell themselves, ""I'm not the only one, it's ok.""  Which in so many ways is worse than simply owning up for your own actions."

I'm taking intro to women's studies this semester and I had my reservations, but I figured that it would be interesting overall.  Well, apparently my reservations were warranted.  Class was cancelled last week and our first session will be tomorrow night.  Our prof emailed us the syllabus and we're using ecompanion with the course.  She posted questions there that she wanted us to answer that all related to the 'messages' we've recieved growing up regarding women, race, men, etc.  I know exactly what she's asking us to think about and I'm sure we'll discuss stereotypes and such in class which should be interesting.  But the way she was phrasing these questions was starting to get to me.  Then I get to one that asked about what ways I as an individual participate in the path of least resistance.  I saw the course listing, I know there are only 2 guys in the course so I know this is a pretty loaded question.  I mean, by the same token, why not ask about a time when we chose the path of most resistance and the reaction, if there was one, to that?  The whole set of questions was geared to our life experiences yes, but the prof seems to be assuming that we all come from a background of fainting spells and fawning for a man to deign to speak to us.  Give me a break.

She even asked us - and I quote - ""other than opening doors for women, can you share specific examples of behaviors by men that can be oppressive to women.""

Since when has opening doors been oppressive!?!  What a crock of shit.  I mean come on.  It's just a polite gesture.  If you have a problem with it, try opening the door for some guys or something.  What a ridiculous question.

As a complete sidenote to the above quotation, it amazes me how devauled works of fiction are.  People assume they only serve an entertainment purpose, but without works of fiction, I wouldn't have the interest in History that I do, or the same ability to write.  I've picked up so much factual information and been able to learn about so many different people and aspects of society through reading.  I've been introduced to other perspectives, and read about countries from around the world.  Granted I couldn't give you a detailed report on the economic factors of war (my current fiction read introduces this concept) but because I've read about it I have the pegs placed in my mind for further knowledge to build on."

Others have the ability to love freely and without thought of consequence.  They can meet a person and never fear for what they say or do because it comes from the heart.

So many people have an inner beauty that shines through in their daily lives.  From the little actions to the grand gestures these people show others what it means to think positively.

Then there are others.  Perhaps they understand many of these things, but only show particular traits to those they are most comfortable with.  They may not always have the right words.

They may have thoughts that are worth hearing but remain internal because they don't know how to express them or are never asked for their opinion.

How I wish I could surrender my soul;
Shed the clothes that become my skin;
See the liar that burns within my needing.
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
How I wish I had screamed out loud,
Instead I've found no meaning.

One of the best lyrical song openers I've ever heard."

"event","Well the stress levels have just gone up a few notches.  After the expected week of midterms turned into a month, I've been looking forward to a break next week.  Unfortunately, I'm really going to have to step it up as I realize how much is left to do this semester, and just how many more projects are due.  And of course a lot of it's due right after break.  Ugh.

So in Greek History today, Holoka did some acting.  Very cool lol.  He also asked the class whether they believed marriage was essential to having a happy, fulfilled, succesful life.  To give context, in the ancient world marriage for a woman was essential and meant that they had achieved success in life.  There were even epitaphs of young women who died before they were married that lamented their single status.

He asked the guys of the class first and about 5 of them raised their hands. (Their response referred to their own lives)

Then he asked the girls.  No one raised their hands at first, then one woman asked about children and he said that children were included with marriage.  She was the only female to raise her hand.

Pretty telling of how the times are changing I suppose.  Any thoughts?"

"event","The future. Life's greatest mystery - even when you think you're sure, you're not.  

It's easy for me to say that my brother's relationship is sad.  But who's to say I may not make similar choices at some point in the future.  I know.  Me.  I'm pretty outspoken when it comes to not settling and the negative aspects of being content rather than happy, and all that.  But we all know how my sureties have panned out in the past - not as I expected them to.

It's easy to approach life thinking you get it, that you understand what's before you.  Then you look back and see the things in your past that make you realize that you just don't get it.  There's always going to be something ahead of you where you won't know how to react, or you'll make the 'wrong' choice.  

And you'll still go on believing that you get it."

"event","Harry Emerson Fosdick's thoughts on war (1878-1969):

Anyone who speaks of the glory of war is ""morally unsound.""  We paint war in bright colors, Fosdick said, along with rhythmic movement"" and the ""thrilling music of the military parade.""  But that is not war.  ""War now is dropping bombs from aeroplanes and killing women and children in their beds;  it is shooting by telephonic orders, at an unseen place miles away and slaughtering invisible men;  it is murdering innocent travelers on merchant ships with torpedoes from unknown submarines.""  Who can dare call this kind of war a ""crusade"" - literally, a bearing of the cross?

Strong words."

"event","From an article in The Weekly Michigan Argus from 1860:

Hints to Young Ladies

Mrs. George Washington Wells, in Life Illustrated, offers the following good hints to young ladies:  

Don't sit down at your crochet work or emroidery unless you have first mended that hole in your stocking.  No use crowding it under the heel of your shoe-rags, like murder, will out, and they speak with terrible loud voices and at inconvenient season's sometimes.

Don't undertake to write skim-milk poetry when you feel a little disposed towards enthusiasum.  Go and do a kind action or speak an encouraging word to somebody, if the feeling must have vent.  Depend upon it, you will be better satisfied afterwards.

Don't pretend to be angry because gentlemen have the audacity to look at you when you promenade Broadway in your best bonnet.  What do you go there for, if not to be seen?  The more you affect indignation the more the offending wretches won't believe it.

Don't pay thirty or forty dollars for the aforesaid bonnet, and then complain that ""Pa"" is in such narrow circumstances you can't afford to give twenty-five cents in charity.

Don't eat blue and yellow candies the whole time, like a mouse nibbling at a pine-apple or cheese, and then lament because you have no appetite for dinner.

Don't keep a gentleman waiting half an hour, when he calls, while you put on your lace and ribbons, and arrange curls; he is not a fool, whatever you think on the subject, and will probably form his own ideas upon your original appearance.

Don't run and hide, like a frightened rabbit, when a gentleman puts his head into the room where you are sweeping or dusting.  If there is anything to be ashamed of in the business, why do you do it?

Don't proclaim to the world that you can't exist without six Paris bonnets in a year, and that life would be a burden without an opera box and diamonds, and then wonder that young men ""sheer off.""

And above all, when someone does propose, don't say no, when you mean yes!  He may take you at your word.

If you follow all these precepts you may one day succeed in getting married, and that you know is the summit of all earthly ambition.

Upon first read, all I could do was laugh and think how ridiculous.  But believe it or not there is some good advice buried in there.  Well, except for that last line or course.  Just thought I'd share my amusement."

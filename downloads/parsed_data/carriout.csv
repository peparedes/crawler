"event","It's been a little while and I know I made the right decision.  I'm happier with Ben than I've ever been and love the consciousness of maturing and growing.  I feel like I'm constantly learning and a considerable portion of it is outside the classroom.

Last weekend was great.  Some couple friends of ours helped Ben and I housesit on Saturday night.  Let's just say I somehow gained the nickname ""Eve"" and Ben danced to Bootylicious while making pelvic thrusts.  Good times, good times.  

Honors is GREAT.  It's by far my favorite class.  I can tell I've matured the most in that I'm become deeper, more generally ponderous.  For instance, Ben and I had a 5 hour conversation with some Muslims over religion.  It was AMAZING.  I'm seriously considering a triple major in poli. sci. and joining the Ashbrook Program.  Ben told me I should the very first day we met....maybe next sememster is a good time to look into it.

*sigh* Ben=very very happy Carrie.

He's coming home to Columbus with me this weekend.  While my dad won't be home, I'm excited he'll get to meet my mom.  (He met Heidi when she came to visit about a month ago.)  Saturday, we're going to a party at OSU so I can meet his older sister.  Ahh, so many introductions.  I like that he knows little about where I'm from and I don't like it at the same time.  For example, I'm a hard core city girl, whereas he actually chops wood. (one word=YUM.)  So I guess in my own roundabout way, I'm just hoping things go off okay.  

Last Monday we had to get a suit fitted for Ben for Ashbrook events.  I went with and his mom and I bonded really well.  Right when we were about to leave, she leaned over and whispered something in his ear that I couldn't hear.  As we drove away, I, attempting and achieving ultimate irresistability, asked him what she said.  

She said I was perfect. 

I'm on every kind of high that's legal right about now.

Looking forward to Harvest Day with Tera and Andrew!!!"

"event","I don't think I've ever been so unsure of where I stand.  I knew a part of me would become a different person at college; bloom a little and become ""a leader of the future"" or some shit like that.  Now I'm not so positive that I like the woman I have this ""great potential"" to become.

There are days where I'm happy with the choices I've made and life is great.  These are the days where my smile seems inpenetrable and I regret nothing.  I convince (?) myself that I'm happy in the new lifestyle I've chosen for myself.  

There are also days where I smack myself upside the head and wonder why I sacrificed what I knew was great for something that was temporarily satisfying (?).  On days like that I feel extreme love for someone that I do not feel for the person I am with.

Today is one of those days.  I feel sick to my stomach, left to wonder if I really fucked things up this badly.  It never takes me this long to get over someone.  Especially when I initiated the break-up.  Alas, I digress.  

Today Ben and I were supposed to meet up once we got into town.  Ben called me while he was on his way to the campus.  He invited me to a play at his old high school this Friday.  Sounded great to me.  Then I found out that his ex-girlfriend was the stage manager and he had told her that I was still together with my ex-boyfriend and that he and I were just friends, no strings attached.  

This made me realize I never had this problem with the Wes.  Wes never once lied to someone about the fact that we were together.  Ben wants me to pretend for his ex that we're not dating.  Suddenly, all the great things about Wes pop into my head screaming, ""What's wrong with you?""

What bothers me most is that even I don't know if I'll feel the same way tomorrow.  

I refuse to pretend to be someone I'm not in order to make someone else happy.  

Wes told me that I needed to show proof of growing more mature.  Well, this could be the swiftest kick in the ass."

"event","The rightmost corner of my room is no longer visable to the naked eye.  It is more assorted than chocolates, with polka dotted bags and brown boxes in various shapes and sizes.  

Tomorrow I move out.  Okay, so technically today, but I don't count it as a new day until I wake up in the morning.

I got some dayyyyyumn good tips tonight because I told people I was leaving for college in the morning.  Let's just say I made more than what most people make when working holidays.  For example:

Me:  I leave for college tomorrow morning.  Can I get you something to drink?
Customer:  Well aren't you adorable?!  Here's a $10 tip!
Me: A Coke, then?

Seriously, I got a lot of tips like that tonight.

Thus, I treated Wes to florescantly iced vanilla cupcakes and a pumpkin pie.  (It's times like these I wish we were living together; it'd be so much easier to grocery shop if we had someplace to store our wares.)  Side note:  they ALWAYS put too much icing on those cupcakes.  If there's more icing than cake, then somewhere, there's an incredibly hyper child running around somewhere.  I actually feel an odd pulsating in my veins at the moment.  If it's sugar related, I'm going to eat another.

No classes tomorrow, just weekend orientation until Monday.  (Duh.)  If any of this weekend's activities involve a. the human knot b. getting in line according to birthday (without speaking, of course) and/or c. singing, in any way shape or form...

I will suffer through it because I have to.

My first college party this week...Jill and I are gonna get WASTED and have fun puking and throwing sawdust on it.

Just kidding."

"event","So I leave on Saturday.  I'm packing eight bazillion brown boxes to shove into a dorm which is the size equivalent of an airplane restroom.  So many people view college as ""the next step"" or some metaphorical beginning to the second book in a trilogy.  I, however, am what they are referring to as a ""non-traditional"" student.  I've been taking college classes since shortly after my junior year of high school ended.  

Thus, I'm choosing to view college more like the new and improved edition of an old book.  The story is basically the same, but it's no longer in shitty first draft hell.

I'll also be picking up more work time while up at Ashland.  Note to readers:  I've been a waitress since April 2005 and really enjoy what I do.  It helps get me through school and I get to socialize and eat for free at the same time.  I've become really good friends with my coworkers here in Columbus and hope to be able to adjust fairly easily on my first day in the Ashland store.

I find myself anxious to leave.  Sure, I'll miss my family and Wes, but once I've got a goal in mind, I like to get started on it right away.  I've decided to double major in English and Psychology and will be going to school through the summers so that I can graduate with two Bachelors by the age of 20.  It's not that I feel hurried or that I'm trying to put my life on fast forward.  I just want to work hard so that I can do something I love as quickly as possible.  On top of carrying two majors, I'm in the honors program and will most likely be studying in Florence sometime in the next two years (during the summer).  

My roommate is incredibly amiable.  I've talked with her many times and we've already met.  Nothing like these two coeds I saw conversing at the Drive-In orientation back in June:

Girl 1:  Hi, you're my roommate.
Girl 2:  Yeah, I know.
Girl 1:  I have a boyfriend in Toledo.
Girl 2:  I have a boyfriend in Zanesville.
Girl 1:  Are we understood?
Girl 2:  Yep.

*both walk away from each other, never to talk until the first day of school*

Wes has shared many a story about ""towel under the door"" signs gone whore-ably wrong.  I'd prefer not to create my own.

Tomorrow is packing day and I'm staring at my suitcase with a vengance."

"event","LIFE CAN BE SO BORING.  I need a good dose of fun right now.  Im going camping this wknd so thatll spruce things up a little.  IM starting to get a little po'd about losing my phone, because this is my second one and my mom says im not gettin another one till i get my license if i dont find it. so call it and tell whoever has it to give it back because they wont listen to me...either that or noone has it and its out of batteries. so a couple nights ago, monday, was the worst night ever. it was just bad...dont ask. 
This is like the busyiest week of the year in my family since there are three birthdays within 5 days of each other. Im gettin sick of cake, and Golf clubs...my dad bought them all new sets of clubs since we are joining a golf club.  We now have 8 sets of clubs in the ""golf closet."" thats like our bikes...(we have 13 bikes)lol...wow. 
tommorow we get to dissect crayfish. My bio teacher thinks i need to be a surgeon because last time we did disections i managed to perfectly remove all the skin from our specimen without noticing because i was bored.  It ended up being the class demo for a good dissection procedure.  I got lucky is all im saying.

We went body boarding at the beach and some waves on friday were def. massive. bug enough to knock me off and bruise my leg gainst some shells.  the drive was horrible.  12 hrs. w/ a lot of ppl in 1 car = bad.  But at least i watched some movies. (thanks JB) but yeah... i dont want to go bk to school. and im not ready to start swimming again either.

"event","So this weekend was actually pretty good.  Friday night i went to watch scetionals.  Saturday I went to the YMCA, bestbuy and the mall. Then i was supposed to meet some ppl for the bobcats game in the foodcourt.  Then someone kept calling my name and i was really confused but it ended up being alexa, brianna, kristi, and natalie.  So i talked with them for a while while and waited for everyone to show up. waited (o and earlier in a magazine store, i was buying a twix bar and the black guy in front of me was buying  a playgirl...........)Finally we all left for the bball game....the girls wanted to come...but it was a very very good thing they didnt.  We get to the game...in line to get tickets and they tell us that they ran out of 10.00 ones and none of us had enough $ to buy $30.00.  So we left.  (we knew that vanful of mexicans would beat us to the ticket line.) we sat in the parking lot for like 20 minutes deciding what to do...so we decide to go bowling.  Brent didnt know how to get there from the coliseum so he took a really long way...hwy 51 instead of 4-85.  so we get there like 20 min after everyone else.  its 7:15.  We go inside and wait in line for a half an hour....7:45  THEN the guy comes and says sorry but theres b-day parties goin on and the league is in the other room so we can get all 12 of you ONE LANE AT 9:45.   we were like screw that. so we waited in the parking lot trying to ecide what to do...30 minutes later a cop pulls up and tells us to disperse because we were 'essentially loitering' by trying to decide what to do.  so we stand there for like 5 ore minutes trying to figure out what the hells goin on...so we all just give up and are like screw it lets go home... so the ppl with no ride home are basically screwed, because all our parents were out at movies w/ cellphones off thinking that mrs. baskwell would bring us home after the game we were  supposed to be at.  so we end up cramming six ppl into mike biehl's truck and he takes us back to brian nelsons house :( so me greg JP and brian show up at his house and play basketball till midnight after we spent like 45 minutes getting a hold of our parents and stuff.  spent the night....went to breakfast home. Interesting night.  Today i played my new xbox game Brothers in Arms which rocks. then i worked out a little ran and went to the golf course..driving range for an hour... home for hw then down to huntersville for the last night of finals. now i just wasted a really long time typing this so i gotta finish hw...peace"

"event","Wow, its been the longest weekend.  I swam great at the meet, but missed my sectional cuts by .2 of a second in the 100 and 200 fly.  Saturday I went to lunch @ Qdoba wit Jnathan, Chandler, Joseph, Alexa, Brianna, and Bryanna. I broke 3 forks trying to eat my burrito.  Then casey came in, and I ended up going to her house with the girls.  We watched a modern rendition of Romeo and Juliet, with guns, cars, etc.  i thought it was hilarious.  Imean,its a sad story, but they killed it.  I laughed alot, so did everyone else....besides casey, who cried.  any ways, now ive gotta finish my Homework, sleep, eat, eat, and eat.
Peace, good luck at sectionals sectional ppl."

Is Harry coming back as Gryffindor seeker or is it still going to Be Ginny?
And if Harry does come back would Ginny consider being a chaser? 

I was going to have Katie hold Quidditch Team Tryouts as soon as school started. 

These are the positions that need to be filled...
2 chasers
2 beaters (I can't remember who replaced the Weasley's, but it said that they weren't very good, So I figured they can be replaced as well. That leaves more spots open for anyone who wants to have their character join the team)

leave a comment and let me know what you think...."

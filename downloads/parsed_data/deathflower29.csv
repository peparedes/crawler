okkkkkkk i was this mad at the mall.  so i went up to one of the model things and starting beating the crap out of it...then i took my bag and chucked it at it and i scremed REALLY loud...then my bag broke and my $$ went flying everywhere and everyone went running. then i had one of my rampages.  i still feel like that so right now i am blasting music.  then as me and my freind were outside she threw my bag in the bushes so i dove in and grabbed it and screamed and took her money and threw it everywhere.  so i grabbed a heavy metal cahir and was getting ready to chuck it at her...but the security came and they looked at me...so i smiled and put it down...ANGER! anyways...that was my life..........*screams*"

"event","Just got back from the gym and thought I'd check LJ since I haven't posted anything in a couple months.  Like the title says, classes in grad school are rough.  All my classmates are pretty old, and it makes it difficult to associate with them on any level besides school work.  Even the simplest questions make me feel awkward like ""What'd you do over the weekend?""  You usually expect the answer of ""studying"" or ""going out with friends"" something along those lines, but when I ask these people, it's more like ""I took my kids to their soccer game"" or ""I'm trying to refinance my house""  Makes me feel too young.  

The other thing I'm starting to dislike about these people is that they seem to be those people that whined their way through their degree.  I'm actually really enjoying my physiology class.  I find a lot of its applications when I'm in the gym and just everyday stuff, and I think the prof lectures very well.  The tests although difficult are at a level that I think is indicative of graduate level work.  I did all right on the first test and I was actually the person that set the curve for the second test.  I mean, I studied my ass off to do it and everything, and I feel that it shows.  But there are little bitches in the class that keep complaining to the prof about how unfair the class is and how he should restructure it for them.  It's really ridiculous because they spent almost the entire lecture (2.5 hours) bitching out the prof.  If I was the prof I would have told them to get the fuck out, but the guy took it.  So I guess he's going to be making the class more straight memorization rather than the application of theory, which I liked and think it's better for this career :(  I thought it was especially stupid that the complaints they raised were ""It's been years since I've been in school, so you should slow it down so I can keep up.""  It's like they think the class should be slowed down for the slowest person... bleah.

Oh yeah, isn't it sad that Christopher Reeve died?  :*(  I was really rooting for him to walk again.  I got so caught up in his death that I bought the Superman movie collection (Yes, I know that III and IV sucked), and I learned the Superman theme song on piano (it doesn't work every well on piano).  I missed that movie they played on A&E that he directed before he died though.  Anybody catch that, and how was it?

Adventures in TAing is great.  Haha, I get to BS with the guys and flirt with the girls, but still have one of the highest averages of all the sections.  Not bad for a first year TA, huh?  I dunno if I'll do it after this year though.  It sucks because their tests are usually around my tests, and the last thing on my mind come test time is holding review sessions and office hours.  Plus the grading exams is a bitch.  I'm stuck on campus into the evening grading papers on the weekends.  Oh yeah, GTP has learned a lesson in flirting with students, watch out for the crazy ones.  Stalking = bad, I'll leave it at that."

Well, it didn't seem like they'd make it that big of a deal since nobody was planning on coming up to Seattle if I walked.  I'm getting kinda tired of it, but a good kind of tired though.  It's the type of tired like going out and performing a free concert and people cheering you on kind of tired.  Oh well, it's not like I'm getting tired of getting money though.  

A cool thing about these get-togethers is that I get to see a lot of my cousins that I haven't had the chance of seeing since I went off to college in the first place.  Everybody looks a lot different from before.  Haha, and they all think I look hella big now when in actuality I'm still a lightweight.  

The weirdest part of the night was this jailbait that was the sister of my cousin's girlfriend was like trying to flirt with me :ugh2:.  And she ain't no regular jailbait that's on the verge of graduating into legal woman status neither.  She was 14 years old.  She's younger than my brother.  In addition, she's from the LBC and talks ghettofabulous.  Haha, but I'm sure there are some friends that would be like :hitit: *cough* Nat *cough* Eugene.  She drank my alcohol while I was getting some food at the buffet :squint:.  Since I didn't feel like gambling tonight, I decided to just watch over the youngsters and play some games at the arcade myself, because I had heard that the fighting gamers of Reno hung around this arcade.  All I played were scrubs, and my brothers at Marvel, who beat me all the time now by the way.  Anyways, while I was playing the jailbait gave me a back rub.  I was like :eek4:.  I swear people were looking.  It would be hit it and go directly to jail.  Jesus, I'm glad my parents came to get me when they did.  Haha, I was liable to freak out at any moment.  Haha, I still don't understand jailbait and their fascination with me.  I need to be attracting college coeds, not highschoolers, ya know?

It's time to give thanks for all of our good fortune in having friends and family that loves us :hug: I personally thank all of the people up here for putting up with me these past couple of years.  I give thanks to my friends back home for not forgeting Pip Daddy even though I've only been home about 2 months out of the year.  I thank my family and alcohol (oh noes!) for getting me through troubled times.  I give a big, fat ol' thanks in knowing that I'll be done with my undergraduate study in 21 days :bigok:

It was fun on Friday hanging out with Isaia and his friends and roommates.  It was a little awkward since everybody there was pretty much a part of his Bremerton group, but meeting new people is :cool:  The captain is booooomb!

Saturday was hella funny.  We jacked the punkasses upstairs' keg that they just left outside and turned off all the lights.  You could hear them freaking out upstairs and running all over the place looking for it.  Finally Sideshow Bob comes down and starts banging on the door and we leave him hanging for five minutes before opening up.  He's all like, ""Hey, you guys know what happened to my keg!?"" all :madfawk: like.  Phil told him with a straight face ""Nah, man, I dunno... Haha, just fucking witchu!!""  It was hilarious.  That guy looked like he wanted to start something, but that woulda been stopped fast since all the guys that live up there are big pussy A&F type boys.  Haha, none of them probably weigh more than a buck fifty.  After we gave them back their keg, we ended up drinking half of it to get our prefunk on.  Haha, that was kinda pointless because Jared's car took a big shit and started swerving all over the place so we had to come back and call it a night.  All good though, a weekend of nothing but free alcohol, I can't complain.

P.S. to girl at upstairs party: Stop staring at me!  If you want to talk to me, do it instead of looking creepy with your flushed face. :ugh:"

Not much has been happening since I last updated.  I guess I didn't update during the break because I was having too much fun at home!  By the time I got back to school, I have been busy with the same old homework and studying.

Anyways, I just finished taking a test for Pchem today, it wasn't too hard.  Basically if you did the homework and understood how to do the homework problems, it was okay.  I'm hoping I did pretty well on that.  I have one more midterm on Wednesday before having a little break from the testing.  

So I bought Viewtiful Joe and Castlevania Lament of Innocence from Gon last night.  Well, as usual, I haven't actually got around to playing them yet.  I'll probably hit it up this weekend sometime.  Thanks though, Gon.  By the way, we're gonna have to catch them movies sometime right soon, because we're gonna be hella behind on movies once Matrix Revolutions comes out!

I've been getting back on schedule with lifting again this week.  It's been kinda erratic these past couple of weeks because Eugene kept bailing on me.  Oh well, now that I have two regular partners in Hobey and Tam, I can have more flexible lifting times.  Plus Hobey's getting into shape for track, I might as well start doing endurance and sprint training anyways.  I was thinking about joining a men's basketball league after school's out.  Might as well get back into playing form now.  Hehe, none of that weak ass halfcourt shit.

They're the guys that act like jackasses and get violent when drunk.  Hehe, to add to that problem is they're hella lightweights when it comes to drinking too.  I guess with time they'll figure out that drinking is about being social and trying to keep a buzz isntead of getting piss drunk.

Hobey's girlfriend seems pretty nice.  She didn't really talk to me very much during the night, so it was hard to really get a feel for her.  But it was her birthday, and I felt bad that she had to be at that sausage fest.  Haha, oh well, what can I do when I'm the only one that's 21 and these guys wanna chill?

Pak-sensei was nice enough to take us out to sushi later that day too.  It was good, but not as filling as I had hoped.  I'm used to all-you-can-eat sushi back home in the No-town (I didn't make that up, I heard it on the radio) and not the pay by the piece bullshit.  Oh well, t'was good.  

We ended up going to Alki beach afterwards to play volleyball, but we didn't have a net, go figure.  It wasn't much of a volleyball game.  It was actually very gay, but it was funny to see Pak-sensei falling all over and diving for the ball.  Haha, I don't think she likes me very much for accentuating how short she is.  So you mean short girls don't like being called ""cute, l'il munchkins""??  Yeah, I think Mr. Will Ma has a thing for the TA and was trying to like grope her in the sand.  Haha, what a fag.

The best part of the day was I found out that bitch Conway went out with Allison in the past and they broke up on less than good terms.  Haha, he was hella bitter that day when he saw her driving her Benz.  He was like professing his life story to Hobey who was trying to get away on his skateboard.  Haha, it gives me all the more reason to like Allison more and hate Conway more.  I reiterate, What a BIIIIIIIITCCCCHHHHH!!!!!

I dunno what's going on, but I'm tired really early on now.  I sleep between 9-10 and wake up at 6.  Maybe I have a thyroid problem or something.  Maybe I'm getting old.  Fuck that shit!  I am not a lightweight!

"event","Verbal abuse is just as detrimental if not more detrimental than physical abuse.  When they're used in conjunction, the combination is lethal.  When you're told that you're useless and stupid for a long enough period without repreive, you eventually start to believe the words.  Once it starts, you're stuck in the grasp of a downward spiral that's outcome is bleak at best.  When you lose your own self-worth, you take all the physical abuse that's thrown at you with the metality that it's your own fault for getting hit.  Nothing anyone can say to you can change that, until you've resolved your self-confidence issues.

In a young woman's life, if you lose your only strong father-figure in your life early, you're faced with a fork in the road.  You may grow stronger from the experience and become increasingly independent, or may develop dependency issues with men as you search for a replacement father-figure.  The latter path has a tendency to lead to the abuse explained above.

So when you have dependency-issues and trying to keep a happy home that you never had during your childhood, you're presented with quite a dilemna.  Which is more harmful for your children and yourself, to keep quiet about being abused while trying to keep the image of the perfect family, or to break up the abusive relationship while it's still early?  Not ever having to face this before in my life, I never knew how to feel when I saw those PSAs on spousal abuse.  Mmm, I guess you never know until it hits home...

Haha, I don't think she likes me very much but she's gritting her teeth and pretending to like me to get to Jerry.  Oh yeah, and get this, she's only 15 years old.  She's one of those brainy kids like Luna, except she's extremely weird, even for a 15 year old.  P.S. shave your moustache!

Well, I guess I didn't get around to going out tonight, but I most definitely will try to make it out tomorrow night.  Lifting, basketball, swimming, and then HIIT tuckered me out too much today.  I ended up sleeping from about 4 until 8:30.  I actually thought it was 8:30 in the morning when I woke up!"

"event","Nothing special going on today.  It was the usual school, lifting, studying.  I think my Japanese TA is getting tired of Jerry and me.  I was eating Subway in class for the first 15 or so minutes of the class.  I think Nat's right about me getting blacklisted by teachers' and TAs', but I suppose it's for good reason.  Oh well, they can't complain if I keep up in the class, right?  The TA, Yamaguchi sensei is cool and all, but I think her random calling on people isn't so random.  Jerry and I get picked on a whole lot in that class :\.  Hehe, we learned the verb ""to drink"" today and the TA asked whether we drank beer or not.  I told her that I do and she got all surprised because she didn't think I was 21 yet.  Hmmm, never thought I looked that young, but I guess it's an Asian thing?  T'is a curse.  

Jerry kinda sorta started lifting with me again, but it seems to be taking up too much time for him.  He'll be cutting back the number of days he lifts at the IMA to about 2-3 days now instead of the full 5+.  So I guess I'm gonna be going solo again this quarter for certain days.  Oh yeah, I'm teaching Jerry how to swim.  He's picking it up pretty quickly.  It's going a lot quicker than last summer, but I guess there are fewer ""distractions"" this summer.  He should be swimming like a pro in a few days.

So the countdown to Nat leaving continues!  It's down to 8 days now!  It's Nat's last weekend here in the states.  What're we gonna do?  Get that fool hella faded with all his friends!  Word!!"

Oh well, all in all, a fun night.  DSD had a puketastic night.  I spent all my money on getting Nat and Kris into Contours and trying to convince two biatches to kiss.  Haha, that European guy is the biggest fag ever.  He should be taken out back and shot.  Somebody should tell him that his fake accent is weaksauce, and he should stop trying so hard.  Oh well, I'm assured that next week I'll be paid in full for getting these fools into the club.  What's the difference between me and you?

"event","Hmm, according to Nat, he's going to be going back to Thailand on the 17th.  Boo!  Oh well, his lolligagging and tom foolery are to blame, I suppose.  He can't get a decent job over here, mainly because of his lack of connections on the professional level.  If only he would have done an internship or two while still in school.  Nat needs to look into see if he has HADD or ADD because he has problems paying attention or continuing to work at one place for a prolonged time.  But for all the issues he's had, I'm gonna miss him because he's an all around good guy.  He's a generally goofy guy that'll perk up your spirits when you least expect it, and he'll give you some golden advice due to his MANY years of wisdom.  I hope he gets over that pinching pain in his upper back one way or another.  It's a rather debilitating condition for him at the moment.  I hate to see one of my broly's not able to lift or sleep for that matter."

Everybody in the class seems to have had some experience with learning Japanese except me it seems.  Hmm, maybe I'm just slow on picking this stuff up?  Bleah, I should finish up Friday's homework and start on studying for the Chapter 1-2 quiz for Monday.

On a lighter note, Jarvis came up to visit for half of this week.  Well, his primary reason wasn't to visit me but to go to his cousin's wedding.  Heh, well, it might've been his primary reason to come see me, since he tried to skip out on any of the activities the family had planned up here.  We ended up just going out for some drinks with Nat, Nat's friends Brett and Amy, and DSD at Dante's yesterday.  It was pretty fun, plus it was my first bar experience in Seattle.  Haha, I'm sure Amy appreciated our conversation on the waitress' breasts and hotness.  Anyways, Jarvis left for home earlier today and should hit Reno in a couple of hours.

Lifting has been going on as usual, just no spotter for this quarter.  Everyone went home and Nat seems too injured to do anything.  Oh well, my workouts get done within an hour when lifting by myself, so I can't complain.  The IMA is nice during the summer because there's really no one there, but the people that are there are such idiots.  I feel like I'm endangering my life when I'm lifting next to them.  When I see how they lift incorrectly or hear about their ""accidents"" in the gym I'm like :ugh2:."

This little exercise is more to help Wingo out than me.  That fool promised me a mad, big present for my party tomorrow.  It doesn't seem like Jon A. is gonna be making it tomorrow though. :\  Somebody pick that guy up and somehow get him outta working tomorrow.

I think my endurance is finally buidling up from the drop sets now.  I should get good gains from these once I start turning it up.  Hehe, I guess I woke up my roommate yesterday with my jump roping.  Well, that's what I get for jumping rope at like three or four in the morning, huh?  Oddly enough, he doesn't ever wake up while I'm running on my treadmill, go figure.

Jon Mar is on again for the trip to Vegas because his brother told him the wrong day for his graduation.  That should be cool, but my friend back home, Mike is now skipping out because his grandma isn't doing so well.  :(  I hope she feels better, because his family hasn't been doing too well lately.  Hopefully I can get Dave, the Chris' and Jake from back home to come along too.  It'd be a shitty trip to have just me and Mar down in Vegas with two hotel rooms.  Haha, I guess we'd graduate from medium pimpin' to big pimpin' then, right?

So it's almost three in the morning and I'm just sitting around doing a little studying for my Music 162 final on Wednesday June 11th... my birthday.  It shouldn't be hard though, and I'm sitting at about a 3.7 in that class right now, anyways.  

Today's (or is it yesterday's?) final in Human Sex was gay, but not much more gay than the usual tests in that class.  Oh well, hoping for a 3.0 in there.

Well, I missed lifting today, because I was tired, but I got fifteen minutes of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) running in and thirty minutes of skipping rope in instead.  Oh well, it's probably better not to lift today, since that probably dropped my test levels considerably.  Heh, tomorrow is a different story.  I'm gonna hit the weights hard with Cheezy.  

I'm gonna be twenty-one in less than twenty-four hours.  I don't know how I should really feel about that.  I've been waiting to turn 21 for so long now, but is it all hype?  Will drinking lose its appeal?  Did you know that moderate drinking over time actually preserves your genital tissue to the point where it is more elastic in old age?  But I digress...  I hope everybody is gonna show up for the lunch and/or dinner on Wednesday though.  I would like to get together with everybody since it doesn't seem like anybody up here will be able to make it to the Las Vegas portion of my birthday party.  But I can't get too shit-faced on Wednesday, because I got a flight to catch on Thursday, all right, fellas? ;)"

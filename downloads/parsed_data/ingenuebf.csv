Work was fine, but before that, Kevin calls me up about four times too tell me that my bio for the show was long.  So I cut it.  Cherie calls me back and tells me that it doesn't make sense.  That hurt me big time.  I mean, I put what I put down because I didn't want too thank anyone in particular.  It's just upseting that I couldn't do what I wanted too do in there, so I put what i usually put and thanked cherie and laurie and whoever feels they're important.  It's not like I mean it, but whatever.  Plus dealing with THe shape of Things is getting too me.  Jesse can be demanding sometimes and I can't have him walk all ove me because of setting he doesn't like.  If I'm directing this piece I should be allowed too just do whatever the hell I want too do.  Above all else, my scene for directing, my actors quit on me!  It's like I get people too help me out and they quit days before.  It sucks and I need new people!  GOod thing Bri and Theresa said they would do it.  I'm just not in a great mood right now.  Not at all."

"event","All right.  I'm going too rant about things, but it's just going too be all in fun.  Not that same ol' ""I HATE THE WORLD!""  stuff.  I just need to express my thoughts right now.

The Shape of Things:
I need too be more prepared.  In fact.  I need too be more responisble in dealing with Jesse, Bri, Karina, Norm, Zolia and Theresa.  I need too be better acquanted with what I want, more then what I need.  Because what I want will come out of what is needed.   I love my cast, and my crew, but I need too get more involved.

Theresa:
I made a discovery the other day.  I'm very very comfortable with this woman.  In fact... we kissed.  That's how comfortable I am with her... and it's not on a level of emotions.  It's leveled with friendship, having fun and the respect I have for her wittyness, smart ass comments (which is a turn-on) and her being herself.  I can't love her like I wanted too, but I can love her for what she's giving me.  Point being, I'm becoming more comfortable with this whole idea of dating around.  ALso with more of my thoughts of other women, even those that are my friends... for a start; there are certain girls that I have inquired of what it is like too kiss them.  Not just kiss (mwah) kiss.  I mean full on Kissing.  Kissing was just a thing that turned me on, and in a way it still can, but I would love too make those inquiries, maybe not known, but I can still think about it.  Friends like Ashley, Karina, Tatiana, not Roschanda, nooooo... and yes even... (drum role please)... Brianna... I think Bri may be an excellent kisser.  Of course I'll never know, but anyone who's kissed her can tell me, and that would be good enough for me... I love you Bri...

Kissing:
I have been told that I am a good kisser... So I've been told.

Kevin Slay:
Kevin is starting too become a great friend, and soon he may become someone I work for.  Mr. Slay has offered me a position in teaching children acting for several hours starting when?  I don't know.  The thing is I would LOVE too do it, but that may interefier with Colorado....

Colorado Springs, CO:
I made this desicion last year, December time.  I made it because of choices that are different now.  Changes in my life that are different.  People that have come into my life that have changed my views.  Well, along with that, people are changing my views of staying here, and I would love too... but I feel God is calling me out there, and he may not be, I don't know.   I feel it, and it feels right.  I feel it coming down to the point where I'm getting these different opportunities for jobs and relationships that my judgment is being tested.   That's something I'm praying about.  Honestly and truley praying about what I need and should do in the next months of my life.

Love:
I love thai food, I love wrestling, I love acting, etc. etc.  Most of all I love love.  All my life I've put myself in the back burner and let what needs too go happen.  If that means sacrificing myself, then so be it.  I've been thought as a child from family or friends or whatever that it's okay too help others.  In fact... I love helping others, even when they don't need help.  Like say they forgot money at home and then I go ahead and by them dinner, WHy?  Because my heart tells me too do it.  I don't do it for rewards.  I do it, because it's natrual.  In fact... Besides my father, I think I'm the nicest guy I know.  And I'm being honest and not humble for once about that.  I love too love people.  I'm not going too change for anyone, because it's not nessicary.  SOmeone's going too love me for who I am, and someone has, and someone will again, and someone does.  Whether I dated them or am friends with them or related too them, the love is and will always (knock on wood) be there.  Love is great... I'm not sure what people are afraid too feel that.  But they should, because love is greater than anything out there... even sex... where do you think sex comes from? Love!  

Final Thoughts:
All you need is love...  That's it.  That's all I have too say about that.

Take care and God Bless"

"event","I let things get too me easily.  I really do.  For people it might be a bad thing, but for me, I'm not sure what too think of it.  First off, I like hanging out with some of those people at Citrus.  It's cool and what not, but when it comes down too it, I'm not fond of being their friends.  For the sake of La Lista Negra and what not, I'm honored too work with them.  They're wonderful people on stage, and I thought so off stage as well.  I'm starting too dislike them as a whole.  I'm not sure if I'm making sense, but yesterday something was done that wasn't that great too me.  I mean, I didn't happen too me, but I felt bad for some people, and what I did is didn't do what was told.  I'm just going too stop there.  They may not realize what they did, and I'm not expecting them too understand what they did, but it hurt me a lot.  In due time I'll get over it, but for some reason, I don't want too be apart of that kliq anymore.  Stuff they've said about friends that I care about, and stuff they've done too people that have no clue how too defend themselves.  Plus myself, I'm stepping back because I'm not how too defend myself.  The only thing too do is leave this all behind when I leave to those Rocky Mountains.  The one thing I'll be leaving behind is love.  Sure, I'll have love when I go, but special bonds in these past years, my whole life, I'll be leaving behind.  I'll miss Bri, Herb, Kristin, my parents, Shannon, Gilbert, Jesse, Michelle, my grandparents, Andrea, Monica, Dakota, Convict, California, Pasadena, my roots, and more... But I'll miss my life I lead.  I'm becoming something without the negative, and I'm leaving the positive behind.  I don't want too leave, but then again I do.  I'll miss some and just leave the rest as hope they'll grow too be better people.

I'm not sure if this says anything about anything typed, but last night I had a dream... From what I can remember, it was at night in the parking lot of an elementary school.  It was myself, Krystal, Bri and possibly someone else.  All I can remember is this; I went too the trunk of my car too put a sweatshirt on, and I had on a tang top or a wife beater on.  Krystal comes too hug me, and I told her ""Don't touch me.""  She doesn't, and I back off and said ""I'm going too the restroom.""  I go to the restroom at a dark and closed school.  Go into the restroom where it was dark, looking for the urinal.  I saw a toilet in the dark on the floor.  The seat and the toilet were on the floor.  Behind me was an open way too the playground of the school with no door.  It was dark and all I can see was the fence that surrounded the basketball court outside.  I go back too the toilet and then look back again, and see someone, I'm not sure who, behind me and out comes a gun.  The person was more of a shadow, but yet I could see it was someone about my height.  He pulls out a gun, and I move too the right and leave as he fires the shot heading towards the door.  That's when I wake up.  I'm not sure what it means, but I'd love too find out.  

 Please stay safe people.  Take care and God Bless"

"event","I can't wait too leave.  Then again, I'm doing the same thing I've been doing most of my life.  Running away from my problems.  Because I've been haert broken, upset at people's ignorance and just plain disgusted at what I've become, I can't wait too leave.  It's wierd, becaue as much as I want too leave, a whole lot of me is saying ""stay and deal with it.""  FIrst off I want too finish school and actually accomplish something that I can be proud of for the rest of my life.  I thought it would be marrying that one true love, but for some reason, she decided I wasn't good enough, and decides too break up with me, and two weeks, TWO WEEKS later be with someone else.  HOW is it, that I'm still getting over her, and she's been through three guys just like that?!  I mean, why is it that simple too just fall out of love, and decide too be with and possibly love someone else, when I'm here at that same spot I was four to five months ago.  How can I still have her on my mind everyday, wondering what will happen too us, when there is no ""US"".  It's just me alone with her alone with other men.  One who's just better with business and has his own studio, one who's better looking then me and ALL the girls love, and another I don't know much of, but possible a better person too be around that's not me.  I loved what she's given me, but for some reason I tend too cling onto that love that I was given and can't let go.  I possibly can move on, but there's no one out there that really wants too be with me.  One girl already made me mad because she said that she wasn't ready for a relationship, then she goes and finds someone else.  Am I not handsome enough, am I too sensitive?  Am I too loving?  For gosh sakes I can treat a women better then most men out there.  But all women want is too be treated like crap!  What the hell?  I'm not changing for anyone so I can go out of my comfort zone too treat some dumb broad like crap!  Because the girls that want too be treated like crap are plain ignorant.  I've been confused most of my life, and it hasn't been easy.  But now that I know what I want, life's not giving it too me.  Do I deserve it?  No, I don't.  I mean I realized what I love, and I can't have that anymore, or at least not right now.  Love is the greatest thing in the world, and when  you share that love with that special person, who knows what can stop you.  I've experienced it and I adore that feeling so damn much.  WHen it's taken away from you, you feel it so damn much!  That's honestly what I feel like right now.  I WANT TO LOVE!  I want a family and I want someone too take care of.  And it's eating the hell out of me right now.  There's not a day that goes by in mind, what I would have done with that love that I had for six months.  I would have made it last, and I would have sacrificed my heart and my life all in the chance too make love work.  But now, I have too move on.  Is it hard?  Yes.  Why?  Because I'm a nice guy?  Because I'm sensitive?  Because I'm human, and I have feelings and emotions.  Most may say they want a tough guy too be with.  I'm not tough.  I'm not tall, I'm not handsome, I'm not suave.  I'm a man who knows what he wants and I may sound cocky, but damn it, I know how too treat a woman.  I will take care of them, I will make them feel special, and I will make them feel like they mean something.  Love is not a game too me.  It's not about how many numbers you get at a club.  It's not about seeing what girl will go out with you and take home too have sex with.  It's not about FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS!  It's about what's in your heart, and right now I may be sexually frustrated and frustrated that I don't have anyone, jealous and what not, but I'm not going too change my life for anyone just so they can like someone else.  I want them too lvoe me for me, just like I love them for what they bring too this world.  One day I'll meet my love... again, but as I cry myself too sleep tonight, I pray there's a woman out there that wants love and not games.  I pray she'll be in my arms for the rest of my life."

"event","I had a week.  Not a good week, not a bad week, it was just a week.

I found out the   girl that I liked.  Kind of still do, is seeing someone.  Which sucks because, well, I think she lied too me.  WEll, she said when we first met that we weren't going too day, because she was too busy and she was looking.  She's dating someone and I found out from K.P.  I was pretty bummed about it, and I just let it go after a day.  But it's just like it use too be.  I like a girl, she's not interested, I get bummed, I move on.  Only this time, I know this may not be the best idea, but I'm looking, not looking but feeling for a relationship.  I know I shouldn't since I'm leaving... I really, really want too take care of someone.  I know it sounds all pussy or whatever, but I really want too love someone, and of course, it can't be just any ol' girl, it has too be someone special too me, and I yet too feel that with anyone.  Well... that's not true, there is someone in La Lista Negra that I'm very attracted too, but the problem is, I have a friend that likes her a lot as well, so holding back too let my friend fall in love with her is something that I have too do.  Because I know he'll be heart broken if someone started too date the person he likes, especially if it's one of his best friends.  Believe me I went through that last year, in some ways.  I love the guy and I don't want too hurt him, but I'm really attracted too this person, and I don't think it would be right.  I do feel lonley, but that okay, because I've been through a point in my life where I didn't date anyone for a year and a half.  I wasn't interested in anyone, I just went along with myself and just went foward with my life.  Of course I met my first love, and the rest is history.  Right now, I have this love, and at night,  I always find myself hugging a pillow.  I know this may sound wierd, but I have an addiction.  It's like sex.  I mean when people get addicted too sex, I""ve heard, that they want more and more of it.  I have this addiction where I just want too hold someone.  I feel it in my upper body, and that makes sense, because I feel it in my heart more then anything.  Plus the tension in my arms where I just want too hold on too someone and just never let go.  I find myself doing that a lot when I'm sleeping.  It was pretty scary, because I fell asleep at herb's house with bri and herb, and I woke up doing the same thing.  I was hugging this pillow that I felt should be real.  It's a strange addiction, but it's coming from my heart.  I love people.  I really do, and I hope and   pray too GOd that I fall in love with a wonderful love that I can hold and know that she's being wanted and loved...

Take care and God Bless"

"event","Oh the Weekend.

My parents are out of town which is nice, because I love having the place too myself.  No parties, no friends over, just too myself.  I LOVE IT!  Though I had too take care of Convict.  His back legs went out on him.  He's getting old.  In fact, I still making a decision on whether I want him too suffer or not.  I hate too do that.  I really do.  He's walking.  I mean, he's able too walk, but for some reason, they go out on him once every hour, it seems.  So I've been letting him sleep with me at night or whenever I'm in my room.  I've had him for 14 years I believe.  He's been with me through a lot, and all he does is wag his tail when I come home and kisses me when I feel bad.  He's a calm dog that loves everyone... especially the ladies.  Whenever I have a lady friend over he loves sitting next too them.  It's funny.  

Friday I went too shop till I drop at the Brea Mall(I LOVE THAT MALL) and I saw Tyler.  I hadn't seen him for a long time.  I was shopping for a gift card and I noticed him.  It was crazy.  Talk for a few minutes, and I left.   I saw him at Nordstroms.  That's where he works.  CRAZY!

I talk to Bri the other day, and I pray and hope she does the right thing... meaning, that her heart is the one that does what she wants and not everyone else.

I got the movie ""Dummy"" with Adrien Brody.  It's a indie film and I'm pretty excited too watch it.

Michelle called me.  She's been busy.  Her last day at JPL is Wednsday and she wants too get together and celebrate her leave.  That'll be cool.  I really enjoyed listening too her leaving a message.  She's a sweet girl.  

I'm off too bed.  I have rehearsal for La Lista Negra and then work.  It's a good Sunday.

Take care and God Bless."

"event","<P>It's been one of those weekends (how many times have I written that?)&nbsp; My car stalls on Saturday, and the I borrow my parents van on Sunday, and the tire pops on that!&nbsp; OH MAN!&nbsp; I had it!&nbsp; I finally just stood in the cold as I was crouching with my head between my legs just praying and praying too keep my mind free of anger.&nbsp; I took a deap breath and went on my way for this week.&nbsp; La Lista Negra had a big impact on me and I wasn't happy about that outcome, but for some strange miracle, Laurie had come and talk too me about it.&nbsp; I didn't even tell her or even show her I was upset.&nbsp; She talked too me about why she didn't even cast me in the role(s) I thought I was getting.&nbsp; She didn't even need too do that.&nbsp; IT just made me happy.&nbsp; I understood, and took the advice from her.&nbsp; Thank God for people like her.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Yesterday went on as I was just thinking and thinking about stuff coming up.&nbsp; In that, I was thinkign of someone. Someone who usally don't think about all that often, except in the past couple of days.&nbsp; Michelle is someone I would love too start a relationship with, though considering everthign that's going too happen, I'm not sure if that's a good idea.&nbsp; I also considered that her and I are way different.&nbsp; Well, I usually like that, but in this case it's me (Junior College), her (USC).&nbsp; That's a big difference.&nbsp; VERY BIG DIFFERENCE, but we'll see where it goes.&nbsp; I really would love too just start something with her, but I'm afraid of getting too attached and not being able too see her for two years...&nbsp; Well see what happens.</P>
<P>On a lighter note... <STRONG>THE OSCAR NOMINATIONS</STRONG> were announced this morning.&nbsp; I'm pretty excited with the nominees.&nbsp; Some I have too question, but here are the nominations for this years <STRONG>ACADEMY AWRDS;</STRONG></P>

<P>I'm pretty excited about this.&nbsp; ""The Aviator"" went on too grab 11 nominations.&nbsp; I'm definet that it'll recieve Best Picture and Best Director.&nbsp; Usually when you win Picture you get the direction as well, and I believe they'll give it too Martin Scorsese who hasn't one an Academy Award for direction.&nbsp; I do have too say that Clint Eastwood recieved two nominations for directing and acting... I'm not sure if should have recieved that nod for acting.&nbsp; In my opinion, though&nbsp; I haven't seen the movie, Liam Neason should have revieved that nomination for Kinsey, though I'm glad Laura Linney recieved a nod for that same movie.&nbsp; Also Natalie Portman for Closer and Cate Blanchett for the Aviator.&nbsp; Eternal Sunshine recieved two nominations, and deservingly so for Original screenplay and Kate Winslet, who was the best thing that movie.&nbsp; Johnny Depp gets his second nomination for Finding Neverland.&nbsp; Before Sunset, a movie that I totally forgot about comes in and swoops up a nod for Best Adapted Screenplay, along with Finding Neverland, Motorcylce Diaries, written by one of my favorite playwrights.&nbsp; But it'll go too Sideways.&nbsp; I'm afraid that the original screenplay won't go too Etertnal.&nbsp; Vera Drake will probably take that spot.&nbsp;<BR>JAMIE FOXX, who I am in love with right now.&nbsp; He recieves not one, but two Academy Award nominations for Ray (a given) and a suprise Collateral.&nbsp; For some reason, I thought the Academy was going too overlook his role in that Michael Mann film.&nbsp; Jamie Foxx will get Best Actor but will not recieve Best Supporting.&nbsp; That'll go too CLive Owen for CLoser.&nbsp; And last but not least, Don Cheadle.&nbsp; Need I say more...&nbsp; There you have it.&nbsp; It's going too be one heck of an Award show.</P>
<P>By the way. the one's highlited are the one's I'm picking too win at this present time.</P>"

"event","Well, I slept.  It felt great, but I still fill emotional.  That's okay though, because you know right now, I deserve it.  I should cry if I need too or just vent whenever I want too.  Say I LOVE YOU too whomever and just be mad at whoever and whatever makes me mad.  I'm human, I've realized this, and soon enough I should be more out foward with my mind, if need be, and too a certain extent.  Today was just a day too be thankful for, just like any other day.  I'm alive, and I'm healthy.  I have family and friends that love me.  I have a special heart towards certain people, and too top it all off, I think I'm the nicest guy that I know.  That may work against me, but I do it, because I love it.  It may bother me, but HELL, if I want too put people before me, I should.  It's been the way I've been brought up.  I'm not nice for the sake of being nice.  I do it, because I mean it.  I've always been a person of good heart and it never made my head big.  It's only been for what I feel the world should do for people that aren't as lucky as myself.  I grew up with a humble background.  My father wasn't there for me as a child.  Well as far back as I can remember, my dad had been an alcoholic and abused drugs as if they were candy.  That's from birth to age 5.  I saw that and I remember it.  Ironically.  I can only imagine what my brothers saw at age 9, 15, and 17.  It sticks out in my mind what my brother Ernie did for us.  What he did for my mother.  With that, my father had too follow in my brother's foot-steps.   He succeeded and just became a better man for it.  I look up too him a lot.  That doesn't happen all too much.  I mean, out of all my friends who's father's left them, my father's the only one that came back.  I'm fortunate for that.  You don't realize how many times I thank God for a wonderful life.  Even though I complain, and sometimes get mad at my folks, I love them too death for what they've done for me.  I'm not sure I love life as much as most people love it, but I respect it as what it's given me and what it's tought me as a person.  Hell, I'm 22 years of age,  I have learned so much and want too continue learning more.  I'm going too continue being who I am, and am not going too change for anyone.  This is who I am and what the world has too accept.  In my opinion, I wouldn't want too change me...

I just got one of the greatest compliments that I can recieve as a person... It's something I'm never, ever going too forget...
-Thank You Kristin."

"event","This is such a great place too vent.  Which is what I love too do, but not in the mood or in any mood too talk to people that I associate with.  School peers.  It's something I'm not loving right now.  I woke up at 2am after I was at school until 11pm for second call backs.  I went too work, with a smile on my face but really  tired.  I didn't start too feel the drowse until hours later.  Which really then made me  upset with some of my actors for Shape of Things, but considering what's going too happen with La Lista Negra, it's going too be a lot harder getting some things done.  First off, I may be rambling about certain things, but I'm trying my hardest too forcus on my main subject, which is me.  I went too school too look at the cast list for La Lista Negra, and I got in.  In all honesty I'm not very happy about it.  I thought, not too sound confident or cocky, but I thought I was going too get a bigger role.  And I'm coming from the heart when I say that.  Though I'm pretty humble about this, I never make it a big deal for me too get big headed about certain things.  For some reason, I wasn't happy that I got ensemble.  Though, I know I'll get over it.  I have so many things too worry about though, so it won't be a big deal.  Right now it's not, but it just hurts a little... maybe it's because I'm tired.  Any-way, I had too vent that.  Because I was telling people that it was cool that I got in, and it is, but I just wish bigger... doesn't everybody at one point or another?

AFter I got out after Directing, I met Michael Ceraso, who I hadn't talked in awhile and went with him too Pasadena too go eat at Dona Rosa's.  Where we suprisngly, and I do mean suprisingly saw Michael Grady and Susan.  That was cool.  Ceraso and I were just hanging out talking abotu random things, because I really like talking too him.  For some reason, he has a certain intelect that I like about him.  If only he came with breast and longer hair then I'd probably love him.  His height can say the same, I've dated girls who're taller then me... MUCH MUCH TALLER!  After that, he was going too see ""The Assination of Nixon"" at the Lemele, so I dropped him of there.  

I talk to Kristin, which was cool.  I'd called her about Shape of Things, and we talked about stuff.   I guess her and I are cool.  Though we're still wierd around each other, I'm sure.  Though we did talk about other things as well.  So it may be wierd but Eh- what're you going to do?  Today had it's highs and lows.  Right now, one of my highs is too sleep because I'm tired.  I'm not sure when I'll wake up, but I know I'll have a great sleep.

I'm not trying too sound selfish here.  I have feelings and I just wanted too express them.  I've been feeling very emotional lately, and I just needed too express that.  I'm emotional, I'm moody and am getting better about certain things.  So, I hope that I can just get better by being positive and forcefull with certain things.  SIGH!  I'll be all right."

"event","I guess the system was down.  That's what everyone's been telling me!  Any-who, I'm not sure where too start...

I really don't know...

Okay, I'll start.

I'm worried about a lot of stuff.  It's not getting too me, but it's on my mind, and what better way too let my worries out  then good ol' livejournal... I still have feelings for her.  What makes them strong?  Where does it come from?  Obviously I still remember those times we laughed, cried(more me then her), held hands, kissed, had disagreements(very little), argued(smaller then the disagreements), and so on...I think I worry about that she's moved on, and I haven't.  She found a better person too help her and too take care of her, and I thought I would be able too do that, but unfortunately I couldn't do that as great as he can.  I would have loved too take care of her.  I would have made her do whatever she wanted.  Hell, I would have married her, worked two jobs, so she can stay teach and then stay home with our beautiful children.  I would have worked any job that would pay for my wife and my children too live and be   happy.  I would have given the world too her... You know when I'm writing this, I'm not emotional.  I""m not sad, maybe a little, but I'm not letting this get too me.  I would have made it worked.  Though, I'm not sure if that's what she wants.  I know she wants a family, and children.  Her and I had the same dreams.  We then linked them together.  Was it too soon for two young adults too even talk about marraige, because in my heart, I felt it was the    right thing too say.  We talked about our wedding.  We talked about who was going to be our best man and maid of honor.  We talked about our children's names and how we would raise them.  We had a little disagreement on whether too raise them catholic or christian, and I let her raise them catholic.  We even talked about our honeymoon a little... It's funny, but I still have those same dreams... and I'm sure she does as well, but those dreams have nothing too do with myself, and unfortunatley for me, I have too make that decision that those dreams have nothing too do with her.  Call me crazy, call me nuts, I don't care, I want a family.  I mean, I would do it now if I could, and struggle my   way too make ends meet.  I make fun of my cousin's whohave children already, some of them were out of... all of them were out of wed-lock, but I do ironic enough get jealous that they're able too create a new beginning for a child who'll hopefully grow up in a better world then the one we live in today...  Like I said, I really want a family.  I want a child, or two, or seven, and I want them too be happy with Dad and Mom.  I want Mom too be able too stay home and take care of our children and take them too the park as they meet other children on the metal dome that looks like an igloo.  I want Mom too talk to the other Mom's about life, or about what they saw in the issue of Glamour magazine.  I want her too fill free too ask me if she fills fat in those $100 pair of Layne Bryant jeans she brought with my American Express that I only use for her and emergencies.  I want her too fill free too ask me if I'm cheating on her, or too come home when I stay at the office, or at Starbucks late.  I want her too cuddle under my arms and my body at night when she fills cold, and when she doesn't fill safe, she would role over at night too ask me too hold her... I know it sounds stupid coming from a guy, but  damn, in the long run, what guy wouldn't want a women too love him?  YOu know I thought about a lot of this stuff when I was with KRistin.  Why?  Because I was able too... Like I said I wanted too marry her... I saved some money too by her a ring... I was going too do something that went out of my way too really show her I loved her...  Her birthday would have been our one year anniversery.  The day after I was going too host a party at my house for WrestleMania, like I do every year.  I was going too drop my party, and go with her too Las Vegas, and give her a ring that I don't know if I would have proposed too her or asked her too stay with me for more years as a commitment ring, but I was going too get her a nice ring with every penny I earned just too show her I loved her.   She knew I did, and knowing her, I wouldn't have too buy her a ring.  But that's what I wanted too do.  That was a plan that I had in mind... I'm sorry to say that There's no more dream for me that I can do that with her.  She meant a lot too me, and you know what, she still does.  I hope she's happy.  I know she is, but I hope she always is happy.  There may be times where she's not, and that;s fine, because life's like that, but in general, I pray and hope that she's happy.  I would love too thank her for   what she's given me for the year of 2004.  I would love too thank her for loving me the way she did.  I just wish she knew what she meant and means too me right now.  As an ex-girlfriend, as a friend, as a best friend, but more importantly, as a  person... a special person, but a good hearted and beautiful, inside and out PERSON."

Tuesday night, I went over too see Michelle.  She's an old friend from work, who I use too like, but never made the move too ask her out.  The reason... because we worked together... not really, but we were in the same department, but since I'm not at JPL, maybe we can just...  I don't know.  Anywho, we went too her apartment that she's been dieing too show me.  She goes too school at USC, and I went too check out the whole atmosphere.  That was cool.  We had dinner at this cafe she lives over, and I had the best rib-eye steak in the WORLD!  Well, it's probably the only rib-eye steak I had, but it was GOOD!   We then went upstairs too watch movies.  IT was cool spending time with her.  

Yesterday was stress on a stick, on my day off trying too get things done with shows and whatnot...

Today I went into work, and I felt like crap.  I mean not like crap where I'm hung over, but my chest was hurting.  I'm not sure what it was, but when we started getting costumers, I started too feel some pain in my left part of the chest, where my heart is... I was a little worried, and still am, so I may go get that checked.  I decided that I want another job.  I'll still work at Starbucks so I can roll over the hours too another store in Colorado, but I really want an office job.  So I'll be getting that set-up.  Any-who, that's wht I meant, when I said I feel wrong and I don't know why.  If it continues too act up I should see a doctor...

It's already the 11th of January, and I'm creating problems for myself that aren't even there yet.  I'm realizing this right now, as I was Laying down in my room.  It seems as though I'm freaking out about A LOT of things right now, and they haven't become an issue yet.  It's about Jesse, the show, people knowing my business, April, my audition, school, love, work, EVERYTHING that I can think about are not even there right now.  It sucks but I'm soo freaking out about it.  I'm not sure why.  Right now, I'm mad at Jesse for some odd reason, and I can't point a single problem why.  It might be what I think it is, or it could be Shape of Things, or it could well be just wanting too blame something on somone, I DON'T KNOW!  Then I'm mad at work, well, not at a specific person, but just a certain happening that I'm very upset over, plus my audition for La Lista Negra.  I seem to just lose interest, but then I regain it, but then I lose it, but I then it comes back.  Plus Jesse AGAIN, for calling me and telling me that I leave long messages!  It's like I wanted too call him back and just say ""WTF!""  There's a lot in my mind right now, and I just want it too be gone right now.  I'm feeling VERY emotional at this moment, and that's not the way I want too start off my year.  BEcause I can't help my emotions, I guess I have no choice too let them rome...

"event","I haven't updated in a while.  Well the New Year treated me well.  I did something that I wanted too do for a couple of New Years.  First, I had too work.  Then I got off at 11:30pm.  At that time I went to San Dimas Canyon Park.  For some reason I've been going there for a couple of months just too think. I went there this time with no one there, and I prayed too the New Year.  It was amazing!  I mean... with everything that's been going on with my life, for the past couple of months I just wanted too be alone.  I thanked him for everything that I've been going through, and the happenings in my life.  I prayed for about an hour, and then drove for another hour and prayed again.  It was cool.   I did have too work that day, but it was nice.  I enjoyed it.  Last week, I've been working and getting ready for my move too Colorado.  I hate too see me go, but I know this is an opportunity I need too go through with.  I prayed about that on New Years.  I also prayed for everyone I know, that they would realize what's important too them and that they recieve a grand gift that will benefit there lives.  I know it sounds corny too people, but I really needed it.

Last week, I worked and got ready for Colorado.  During my time I recieved a call from Tatiana wanting too know why I didn't sign up for her show.  I totally forgot.   I didn't forget about the auditions, but I forgot too sign up.  In the long run I thought that it wouldn't be full, but it was TOTALLY PACKED!  With signing my name, there was only one slot left.  SO I'm glad she called.  That was neat.  I went there and saw her and saw Mark Porter, who I haven't seen for quite a while.  That was cool seeing him.  I soigned up and my auditions Thursday at 9:40pm!  I need too memorize my monologue.


Today was cool.  I worked, slipped at work like three times.  Went to the bank and saw my old science teacher Mr. Phelps.  That was REALLY COOL seeing him.  I love that man very much.  He was involved in some contreversy at school a couple of years ago and last year as well.  He  wrote a letter too the board of education stating that the lack of students who are failing are african-americans and mexican-americans.  He basically stated that they are not paying attention in class, and are always talking and being disrubtive.  People took offense too that statement and told him he was being a racist, but he was being truthful.  He got suspended, and he left school for awhile.  This year they let him go.  I'm not sure what he's doing, but it was nice seeing him.  HE has a beautiful wife and a lovely child.  

That was my day.  Nothing too extravagent.  I'm talking too herb now, so I'll talk too him for awhile and go to bed too be at work by 4:15AM.  WAH000

"event","The year is rounding off.  2004 has been something else.  I've experienced a lot in this year alone. I got a great role in a wonderful play.  I fell in love,  I was heart broken, I ended a great three year job, I started a new and wonderful occupation, I made plans for my future, I started a new change in mind, and above else, I believed in myself towards the end.  I made it through this long and wonderful year.  I learned a lot.  I went through a lot of things many people would only dream of going through.  I met people that I find fascinating.  Though some of them I wouldn't associate myself with, and some of them I would like too keep as a friend in the long run.  I had dreams this year.  Many of those dreams changed into a reality.  I had a wonderful relationship that may have ended bad, but I learned from it, and I loved every single moment of it.  I learned a lot from her, and wish her the best within the next New Year.  My family and I have become a little bit closer this year.  I went through emotions with them that I never thought I can show them.  I wish them the best for the New Year.  I made wonderful friends this year, some young, and some older then respected peers.  I wish them the best for the New Year.  Above all else, I met a new idea for me.  I see the world a little different now.  It may not be artsy or poetic.  I may not see what's entirly outside the box, but I notice things that I have that I never will take for granite.  I see myself coming out of what I had been inside of.  It may be a closet, or a shell, or ever that box I mentioned before, but it's time for me too be more open with who I want too be.  The resolution is too be more aggresive with myself... I wish myself the best for the New Year.   Happy New Year.

"event","CHristmas is over, which is good and bad.   I think people forget the true meaning of Christmas which is bad, but that whole idea of spending time with loved ones is just utterly B.S.... well, the holidays making us think we have too be with someone for the holidays is BS.  I'm somewhat going throught that right now, in fact I""m going through a lot right now.  I'm not sure where too start.  With any good Mikey journal, I'll just write.  

Christmas Day I went too the Skirball museum with my cousin Robbie.  We went too go visit the exibit on Einstien.  That was fascinating.  there was a piece, not the Einstien part, but there was a piece in the Skirball that was depecting time from where people were typing different types of chats and it was somewhat composed in a rythym.  IT was very creative.  And it looked like the messages were from that very instant.  Fascinating.  VERY FASCINATING.  After the Einstien exhibit, we went through, briefly, the holocaust exibit.   That was really cool.  I""m very fascinated with the Holocuast, I'm not sure why.  But I am.  I want too go back and just thorughly look through there.  After the museum, we took a drive on Mullholland Drive.  That was cool.  During the drive, we spotted a fox.  My cousin Robbu put on the breaks, pulled over, and chased it.  After a couple of minutes we lost it.  We then try too find the Hollywood sign.  I mean, we could see it, but we wanted too go near it.  We didn't have time, but we found a road that could lead us towards it.  One day or night, I""m going too just go see it.  that's somewhat of a goal before i haed out.  

After that, I got ready for work the next day.  Or today.  I opened for the first time today.  That was fun.  We were busy Today!  My GOSH!  The Starbucks cards were not working.  Everyone came in too use there Starbucks cards that they recieved for Christmas and they weren't able too use them because our registers wouldn't except them.  TRAGEDY!  ABOVE ALL ELSE, we had no frappacino mix.  we couldn't make Frappucino mixes for anyone.  IT was bad.  People were angry, and we had too deal with them.  But I made it through my shift this morning.  Hopefully the rest are fine after I leave.  

A lot to think about.  I mean a lot.  I'm not sure where too go in this type of situation.  I'm thinking about a lot right now.  I mean, I have these feelings that I want to share with someone, but I'm not directing them towards anyone.  The only person that I could, I can't.  I realize how different it would be if I were too go that route again.  If it were too work, it would be so different.  I can't go back there anymore.  But that's the only place I want too go back too.  I'm not sure why, but I can't help feel that way.  She seems happy right now, and that's what I want for her.  But in a sense, I want that too come from me.  It sounds selfish I know.  I'm not sure if I""m still in love, or if I'm in love with her again, or if I'm missing her.  I saw her a few weeks back, and that love wasn't there.  Now that she's not here,  I think it's back again.  I feel really really wierd right now.  If it happens again, I""m not sure what will happen, since I'm leaving.  I'm definit on leaving, no matter what happens here.  If I find the true love of my life, I'm still leaving, if I get a part in a film, I'm leaving.  I'm not sure what's going on with me right now.  I feel really out of place.  I'm sure if it's because people have someone and I don't... I really wanted too marry her.  I think it's because I wanted too follow in the footsteps of my brothers.  Both Ernie and Gilbert married there respected wives young, and Shannon met his girlfriend in high school.  I wanted that in my life.  I didn't think I was going too get it until I met her.  I met her and fell in love, and figured that she would be the one and only for me, only she changed for the better, and I changed for the worse.  When that happens, there's no in between.  She's so much higher then I am right now, and I'm just in the bottom of the pit.  I may still have feelings for her.  Though I can't let her know that, because she's moved on too someone who's a much better person then me.  Plain and Simple.  He's got looks, talent, smarts and just a great guy.  I know I can't go back.  I know I can't have her again.  I know that her not enough too love me again.  I'm not sure why I feel the way I do, but with her I can't feel no love.  She gave me everything I needed, and I just haven't recieved back from her... I know in the back of my mind that we won't be together again.  I know that.  Maybe that is somewhat of a load off, but what i want most of all is for this too become that dream I had in April..."

It's funny though, it's not an emotional movie, but considering the states of what had happen, it really got too me, though I wasn't sad, I was very happy.  It was something that just made me cry, not for sadness, but for joy.  It was cool.  I cried in movies before, but this time it was crying because it was just overwhelming.

I got a call from Sarah, my lovable stage manager, at work asking if I would go in to work and fill in for someone..  Guess what I did? I did.  I got a reward for it.  I got the MUG REWARD!  She usually calls people and they can't do it.  She called me and I was open.  I was there from 9am - 5pm.  It was cool.  I like working at Starbucks.  It's a reward in itself.  I'll probably think otherwise in a few months.

I think I know why I want to run now and get fit.  Well, I either want a tattoo or a belly button ring piercing.  I know the piercing may be gay, but I think it'll look cool.  But that gives me motivation to get healthy.  So, I'm going to go run and get fit in the mext few months before I go too Colorado.

I didn't ask her about it, but she told me that much.  That's scary.  That is a fear of mine working at a store.  Well, she's really cool about it, but it still a little scary.  After work, which was cool, I got ready too hang out with Theresa.  She took me too Buca de Bepo for my birthday and then I took her too Amoeba Records.  We had a cool time.  There was something intersting that went on, all of a sudden, we started holding hands.  I didn't know what too think of it.  I don't think she didn't know what too think of it as well, but it didn't bother until after I got home.  I wasn't sure if I was falling for her.  I know she likes me, but I""m not sure if I feel the same for her.  In al honesty, I'm not over everything that's been happening.  It may sound wierd, but I'm over Kristin, but my emotions are still there.  It's wierd, but that's how I feel.  Considereing everythign that's going to go on with me moving to Colorado, I'm not sure if it's appropriate too get into a relation with anyone.  But in my new passive aggresiveness, I know I can turn her down if I have too, and she can do the same thing, if needed.  Either way no one will get hurt.  We talked about fooling around, and she brought up a good point.  One of use is bound too get attached.  I'm not worried about me getting attached... it's her.  Any-who, I'm not worried about it, as much I thought I would be, but I do need time away from people too just adjust right now.  I know                my friends hate that.  I know they hate me doing things ALONE, but I feel better off that way.  It's just the way I am. I""m trying new ideas in my life and I'm sticking  towards them.  Moving, being more controlling with my work (directing and work) and just trying to gain trust from certain people."

"event","Thursday's gone and it flew by so quick.  It was my birthday yesterday, but it was just another day for me.  A few calls came my way and that's about it.  IT was nice too hear from people that I don't talk too call me up and wish me a happy birthday.  It was nice.  Though it was my birthday, i was worried about something that was happening.  ONe of my actors for Shape of Things, KArina wants too get someone else invloved as a ""CO-DIRECTOR"".  I was afraid this was going too happen.  I didn't want it too, but you know, it's something that Karina got Norm too  approve of and now I have too deal with it.  Basically, I don't want Roo apart of this project.  I can't be passive about these situations anymore.  I can't have people walking all over me like they usually do, so I put my foot down and I have too let KArina, NOrm and Roschanda know that.  Roo doesn't like  the play, espeically the characters and has a way of ""tweaking"" the show.  Too me the play's written the way it's suppose too be wriiten.  I love the characters and am investing  a lot of time into this.  So, yeah, there's no way I can let people walk all over what I want.  It's somewhat of a New YEars Resolution too not be passive and be more aggressive about decisions.  I wish I learned and was thinking that in from the beginning of the year until the end.  

Went to College Night at CCV.  Met some cool people and just loved the guest speaker.  I was spoken too again.  Let's hope and pray it sticks.

TOnight's our holiday party for starbucks.  I""m stoked about it.  I have too cancell on Theresa, but I hope she'll understand.  I'm off too work.  Caio.

"event","This might be a lot harder then I thought.  Right now I feel really out of it.  I'm not sure what too feel  right now.  Sounds funny huh?  Well, it's not.  I thought I was jealous.  Maybe I'm more then that.  I thought that I was in love, but I figure that it's not the feeling.  I thought I felt out of place... yeah.  I think may be it.  I do feel out of place.  In fact.  I don't know why I should stay in California for long.  I think I am making the greatest decision I can.  I love a lot of people here in town.  I really do, but do they love me as much as I love them.  I know for sure there's at least one person that doesn't love me as much as I love them.  Or maybe there might be another person added too that mix.  After all, they are dating each other.  One follows his/her heart towards the common piece of love.  Whether it's a person, or whether it's a hobby, or maybe a life time goal.  You follow your heart and you lead it towards your happiness.  What is being happy?  Lately, it seems in order too be happy, you have too be in a relationship.  It's the holiday season, so why not?  Society has made it a Commandment too be with someone during the holidays.  Excuse my language, but that's complete and utter Bull Shit!  Though that's what people around me are in.  It's not thier faults that they're in love, and again, there's nothing wrong with being in love.  It's a wonderful thing.  But what's wrong with being alone?  I can't seem to find a complete answer for that, other then the fact that your not spending money with that person.  You get too do what you want to do without talking too your partner about it, and sutff like that.  I can say that I'm happy right now because I've been focusing on my future.  Though, why is there a whole in me right now, because it's still the present.  It will always be the present for me.  It's never going too be the future.  Of course I'm correct, but I understand what planning ahead for yourself   means and all that crap.  I'm forcing myself too do things I don't want too do... date, eat, sleep, love, find interest in someone, help out other people, be kind, don't be rude, don't be jealous, keep shit too myself, etc., ect.  I'm almost having it with certain people in my life right now.  In fact, for some reason people who I thought were my friends, are turning out too be people I have too deal with for six more months.  Damn, these holidays are killing the hell out of me.  Every year I do this too myself.  This time though, I'm not going too do anything about it, because that's always my first impulse.  Getting gifts for true friends, I'm not going too do that.  Moving on, from what?  There's nothing there anymore too move on from.  Going too Kristins New Years Eve  blast.  Why should I go and watch JEsse make out with my ex-girlfriend, and why should watch Kristin make out with one of my good friends?  In fact I don't think I'll go.  ""Though that means you'll be alone for the New Years"".  That's all right with me.   I need too just look foward instead of looking back.  Forcing me too do those things is making me go back what i was, and even if I was happy then, I want something new for me.  I love Kristin, I love Jesse, I love my parents and my brothers, I love my friends, and I love a lot of people... But... why am I not the one being loved by me?   It seems that I love and love, and love people, and the one person that I'm not in love with is me.  I don't think about myself.  I put people before me, and I take everything with a grain of salt.  SHouldn't I be happy as well?  I would say ""what's the point?  As long as everyone else is happy, that's fine with me.""  Now I should say ""Yes... Yes I should be happy.""  In looking towards following my heart, I've missed a person that probably deserves my heart more then anyone... and that person is me.

i got a face like a limp handshake
hair like an accident scene
i've been waking up slowly
savoring the same old dream
and somewhere between
the folds of your memory
i was sleeping soundly
oh, yeah
hell yeah
if you don't ask the right questions
every answer feels wrong
i was a terrible waitress
so i started to write songs
and i don't know how i feel
but i wonder if you feel like me
do you ever get wrapped up 
in the folds of my memory
oh, yeah
hell, yeah"

"event","Yo!
The weekend is over and I'm already stressing over ""The Shape of Things"".  It still like six months into it goes up, but I was trying too do my part of the directing process and break everything down as much as I can.  IT'll be fine.  The one wierd thing is that the first part frustrated me on where I want too put the first scene.  Aggrivating.  Very much so.  I have a lot on the mind.  In fact I couldn't sleep last night.  I was thinking about some stuff that was on my mind, and stupid me, I called Kristin.  I talk too her about some stuff and all she did was probably nod and say Mm-Hmm.  Needless to say I'm probably the last person she wanted too talk too right now.  I called her at 1:30am because she was up at that time.  She had said that she was going too work early.  That stuck out in my head at the time and I called her.  Again, she didn't sound pleased too hear my voice, but of course it was 2am in the morning, so whatever.  I just called too talk.  I had some stuff on my mind that I wanted too talk too her about, but I have too realize that I may want too talk, but   she deifitnetley does not want too talk too me about anything.  It's wierd I have too say.  Though it's more wierd on my side more then it is on her side.  I wanted too talk to her about something I'm going through.  It's    relly wierd too explain so I won't go into detail like I usually do with this journal.  Basically I""m jealous of everyone that has someone.  People are happy because they're in a relationship or just plain fooling around.  People who aren't are sad about the holidays.  Right now, I'm jealous but I'm not looking for anyone.  My heart is not leading towards anyone... SO I thought.  There was someone I couldn't stop thinking about.  It was the unlikley person that anyone would think about.  It was wierd.  In fact I had that feeling inside of me when I was thinking about her.  I still have that feeling inside me right now thinking about her.  It's wierd.  The only thing I can do is act on it.  I""m the guy and I have too do that in this situation.  So, we'll see how that goes.  The only thing is if this person and I get involved, it'll be hard because I'll be leaving in seven months... for two years at that.  So all these things running through my head, and this week is probably going to go by real slow or fast depending on how I feel about this.  three more days until my birthday and all I can think about is leaving next year and her and the shape of things.  I need too just CALM DOWN!

I spent last night going through the script for ""The Shape of Things"".  T'was cool.  I went to get some Dona Rosa and just figured out what I want too do... and nothing, so far.  I've changed my mind about the first scene SO MANY TIMES!  I'll have too check out the Little Theatre before the semester ends.  

I woke up this morning with a CRAZY dream.  It was real crazy.  In fact I have too ask someone about it.  I'm going too look it up.  It had Kristin in it a lot.  I'm not sure if she's the main focus of my dream.  I think she symbolized something that I want.  Not neccarilly her.  I hope I'm right.  Any who, I woke up with that dream and fell asleep too another wierd dream continuing with her in it.  So I'm pretty sure that she symbolizes something that I want or need in my life.  

Today I work, after that I'm not sure what I'm going too do.  I'll probably get ready for school this week and study for my government and math test this week.  ARGH!  Then my birthday is Thursday.  I""m not sure what I""m doing.  probably nothing.  We'll see.

Last week of finals and school and the last week before Christmas.  Happy Holidays too all.

I have this wierd craving for Dona Rosa.  I'm going to there and get something too eat and work on ""The Shape of  Things"".  That'll be cool.

I looked into the school in Colorado Springs, CO.  They have a pretty interesting enviroment over there.  I want to visit it, but I just don't have the time.  I'm going too send for some brochures and see what I they can offer me.  I took a peak into the theatre department and it seems interesting.  We'll see what the haps is when I go there.  I'm going too talk to a counsler next month about transfering my grades over from Citrus too Colorado and see about transfering from there back over here, or too another great school.

I have a lot on my mind and I'm going too refresh it with some mexican food right now, then I have too get up tomorrow for church and then work.

"event","It's been a crazy and full filled day on Friday.  I got up and went with Jesse to talk to Cherie about putting on ""The Shape of Things"".  She actually gave us the OKAY!  I mean, for some reason I thought she say no, but man I'm TOTALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS!  You have no idea.  I'd be directing it, Jesse, Norman, Brianna and Karina will be in it.  That's going to be great.  The thing is, I've been thinking about it day and night for the past couple of days.  I know I'll think about it more.  Especially tonight when I just make time for it and nothing else.  

I worked at Starbucks, and did some modulation with time logging and and what not.  It was boring, but then again it was fun.  The peopel there are really nice.  I like them already.  Most of them went too my church in Pasadena so I know a few of them.  Interesting though, I wonder if God put me there with them too learn, if you will.  

Afterwards I went too Fullerton too see ""The Winter's Tale"".  It was well done.  I have too say that the sound, the backdrop, the whole lighting and most off, THE ACTING was fantastic.  David, who I went too go see was terrific.  I've never seen him this physical as a character type actor.  I guess it's easy too play a character actor.  I mean, it wasn't that big of a stretch for him.  He was funny.

After David, Kim and I went to T.G.I.Fridays.  We talked.  She seems really cool.  I enjoyed a lot.  It was nice because they or it didn't make me feel like the third wheel.  It was great.  I think she's a great girl for him.  THey've been together for nine months.  They seem really happy.  In fact, David has been out of a job for awhile.  He's been dealing with money problems and she took him in too live with her.  I mean that was really sweet of her.  It was great too catch up with him, and getting too know her.  

I left the premise of Fullerton on my way home.  I was pretty happy.

Though things got wierd after awhile.  I was on a high of happiness.  In fact, I was impressed about how Kim let David into her house, that I did something stupid...  It was stupid because I was thinking in a different light.  I was happy about what Kim did with David that I went on my cell phone and wanted too call someone.  I had that feeling in me again.  That loving feeling in me.  Thinking I called Kristin too just say hi, I got my house number... It was really wierd.  I realized what i did, and I started too wonder why my mind went back too her.  I called her too ask her something, that I would have asked her if she was still with me, and it's funny that I didn't get her.  I erased her number out of my phone and replaced it with my own.  That was wierd.  Of course I thought about why my mind would go back.  I probably saw how happy Kim and David were and my heart went back too how I felt about Kristin.  I don't think it was bad thing, but I thought, ""What if I'm not over her?""  I thought about that and I just can't go back that loving memory anymore.  It's wierd that it happen.  Though I haven't talk too Kristin for awhile so she is becoming something that was in the past.  WHich sucks in a way because I would want that friendship again.  It's wierd.  It's very wierd.  Then it also has too do that she has someone great.  Someone who I'm jealous of.  If I was her I would pass up me for Jesse.  I would.  He's a smart, handsome, funny, charming, and above all else a caring person.  Something I lost with myself for quite awhile.  I know I'm not smart and handsome and charming, but I do care.  Like, when Kristin first saw Jesse, he thought he was handsome... didn't think much of me until she got too know me, and several months later we get together.  DAMN these holidays.  I'm starting feel those blues right now.  Like I said I think the reason I'm feeling like this is because everyone has someone.  I feel left out.  Everyone spending time with a loved one and I'm not.  My heart's not with anyone and I hate too be with someone for that purpose alone.  It wouldn't be right.  Any way I have Starbucks class today and I need to get ready for it.  Caio

"event","<P>Today was a nice day. I woke up this morning getting ready too meet Bri for our scene. I had this wierd craving for McDonalds breakfast. A heart attack later, it was all right. I met Bri too run our scene. I then ran some errands which ventured me towards Hollywood where I picked up The Shape of Things, not Shadow Box. For some reason I got the plays mixed up in my live journal. None-the-less, I read it, and I loved it, and I defitnetley want to direct this next semester. I came up with some great concepts for the play. I pretty much have the background, and the setting. I talked too a lot of people about lighting, stage managing and even costumes. I talk too Michael Montenegro and Kevin S. about lighting and stage managing. I talked too Zolia and Maria about helping out with tech backstage. I also talked too Becky about costume and she was thrilled about it. So all we need is the green light from Cherie. That would be the one thing Jesse and I are going too talk to her about. I'm very nervous so I think I'll let him doo the talking. Most of the talking. Bri and I did our Shakespeare scene and sad too say that it was our last class with Brent. I will totally will miss that man.&nbsp; He will be doing a production of Aida next year and I hope too see it in January.&nbsp; That would be great.&nbsp; Even if it hits Colorado Springs, CO that would be awesome.&nbsp; I could check him out over there as well.&nbsp; If he does.</P>
<P>I ventured towards Fullerton too see David in ""Winter's Tale"" but wasn't able too get through traffic.&nbsp; So I missed the show, and so I decided too go to CCV for College Night, and I miss that as well, so I went home and decided too write in my live journal thingy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do want too talk about something.</P>
<P>Speaking of Jesse, I was talking too a friend of mine today, and we were talking about my life and what not, and he asked about Jesse.&nbsp; He doesn't know him but he knows about what's going on.&nbsp; He asked if I was jealous of Jesse.&nbsp; I thought about it for about a second, and quickly replied... ""Yes"".&nbsp; But the thing is I've always been jealous of Jesse.&nbsp; Well, when I first met him, I've been jealous of him.&nbsp; Here he is.&nbsp; This great looking attractive guy, who's smart, funny, and just about the greatest human being you'll ever know,&nbsp; I think I have a right too be&nbsp; jealous.&nbsp; It's something I would love too have.&nbsp; Most importantly, he's totally has God behind him.&nbsp; He's a christian.&nbsp; He's everything a girl would hope for.&nbsp; Many girls love him too death.&nbsp; I don't know how many girls have mentioned they had crushes on Jesse.&nbsp; Or still too this day have a crush on Jesse.&nbsp; So yeah I am a bit jealous, but not of the fact that he's dating my ex-girlfriend.&nbsp; Why's that?&nbsp; Well, because that's something that happen and I can't do anything about it.&nbsp; But it's not a threat too me.&nbsp; It doesn't even concern me in any way.&nbsp; So that's that, but... I've known Kristin too have a crush on Jesse ever since they met.&nbsp; I'm sure she had a crush on him while her and I were going out.&nbsp; I know I'm going back too the past, but I can remember times Kristin would ask me question about Jesse and certain things about that subject.&nbsp; Certain things she'll be able too find out now.&nbsp; IT somewhat hurts a little knowing she ""ALWAYS"" had a crush on Jesse, and that does include&nbsp;when her and I were together.&nbsp; I can't help but think what would have happen if that would have happen then.&nbsp; Of course it's something I was thinking about and am not sad over it, just pondering a thought that I&nbsp; was thinking about.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really loved her... and it kind of seems that God was putting me there for them to get together.&nbsp; It was somewhat of a roadblock for her too Jesse.&nbsp; It's just something I think about.&nbsp; I pray about it a lot.&nbsp; I;m also jealous that he has someone, and I don't.&nbsp; Again that's my mind set when my friends are with someone and I'm not, but the thing is I'm not looking.&nbsp; I'm not in love with anyone or interested.&nbsp; My heart isn't in that frame right at this point, but I'm still jealous.&nbsp; I am and I can't help that.&nbsp; I love the guy too death and jope the best for him and Kristin, but maybe I should be praying for me then for them.&nbsp; They seem happy, and I kinda feel a little out of place.&nbsp; I'm not sad, I'm not depressed, I just feel out of place.&nbsp; It's also everyone has someone.&nbsp; Most of my friends&nbsp;I should say has someone too fool around with or are with someone.&nbsp; Which again, I'm feeling out of place.&nbsp; I don't want a person too have fun with, at least that's what I feel right now.&nbsp; I rather have someone too be with for a strong relationship, just like Jesse and Kristin, Karina and Christina, Josh and Cherryl, David and Nicky, Shannon and Andrea, Ernie and Audrey, Gilbert and Monica, Brian and Vanessa&nbsp;even people like Bri, and Theresa are having fun right now.&nbsp; You know.&nbsp; It's a little hard when the holidays are around when you're just alone.&nbsp; I have friends, but this is a little different.&nbsp; Especially when I have a birthday next week, I think abotu this a lot.&nbsp; I seem too pass it by all right when it comes every year.&nbsp; So I'm just jealous of everyone out there, especially Jesse.&nbsp; I don't need anyone, in fact I don't want anyone for this sole purpose because it's not a great purpose too have someone during the holidays.&nbsp; If anything I want love, and nothing more.&nbsp; Fooling around is cool, but for myself, I have too fully invest in that person in order too ""have fun"".&nbsp; Right now it's not where my heart is.&nbsp; I do wish everyone the best of holidays next week with finals and for the holidays in the next couple of weeks.&nbsp; May your heart filled with joy and for that special person in your life as well.&nbsp; GOd Bless, and have a happy holiday.&nbsp; That's a wish from me too all those happy and fooling around couples.&nbsp; I love you all very much.</P>

Only a few people know so far.  I told my parents, Ernie, and I told Jesse about it as well.  The reason I told Jesse is because of the play he wants too put up, it may be for the summer.  The decision has been made.  I will be leaving California and will be going too school in Colorado Springs, CO for two years.  I'll be living with my oldest brother Ernie and his family.  They agreed too it.  I'm very excited about this.  I really am.  Next year seems it's going too be better then the last.  I had a great 2004, and probably an even better 2005.  This will be great.  The plan is too live there for two years and go too school without disctraction and get work done.  I'll come back and go too school at a University.  I'm very, very proud of the decision!  I'm so looking foward too it.  Not a lot of people know, and that's where I want it too stay.  My parents know, Ernie knows, and even Jesse knows.  I'm sure if Bri read this she'll know, but that's all I want too know so far.  I'm not going too tell anyone about this.  This is a little secret that I'm going too keep, and when the time is right, probably after school ends, I'll tell people.  This is a new direction in my life and I'm following my heart.  I love this decision a lot, and I'm sticking with it.  Thank God for all of this.

Before I entered class, I talked with Jesse about a production of Shadow Box at Citrus.  It's a four person play with some great scenes.  I'm not sure how Jesse wants it too be done, but if I'm not mistaken I think he wanted me too direct it.  He has an idea for it, and we're going too one day over the holiday sit and talk about it.  He 's going too pitch the idea too Cherie come next week.  Him and I and a few other people want too round up some folks for a production of this.  Jesse came too me with the idea.  I found it too be an awsome idea, and hopefully it'll get up on its feet next year.  I talked too him about my decision next year, and he said it wouldn't conflict with that.  I'm pretty excited about this.  I wouldn't be directing all of it.  I'm sure they know what they want.  They have an idea of the style they like too perform.  I'll be there too just put them where they need too go.  I'll talk too Jesse about it over the weekend, and he'll then pitch the idea towards Ms. Brown.  This will be a great production if it's given the okay.

I talked too Ernie about my decision.  He said it was fine.  I talked too my parents about my decision, and they said it was cool.  I'm going to research more into it, and pray more about it.  IT's a crazy thing for me too do, but I think and I know I can handle it.  This is going too be great!  Like I said thought of this today, and I'm sticking too it.  I want this really bad, and I think this is where my heart is leading too.  This has been a CRAZY couple of months!

The reason I thought about it, is that Starbucks is a job that'll be able too do something like this.  I'll be able too benefit from it, and I think it's a really great idea.  I have too pray about it.  I have to talk to my folks and my brother about some information about it.  It's a crazy idea, and it's going too require a long time.  To do it is one thing.

"event","Okay.  There was a joke played on me yesterday that I forgot too share.

Yesterday I went too IN-N-Out too eat.  Came home driving and had lots of soda in me.  Duing my drive home, I really  really had too go to the restroom.  I mean BAD!  In fact, I decided too just wait until I got home, because I was somewhat there.  Going home on the freeway I realize I had too go, and traffic in San Gabriel is TERRIBLE!  I'm driving and all of a sudden, I get off the freeway... IT WAS THE WRONG EXIT!  I never got off on this exit before, and I had too turn right while cars were going towards my left with no stop or lights on that exit!  I still have too go, and that's when I realized that God, or possibly my grandfather was playing a funny joke on me.  I tried soo hard not too laugh, but damn I really had too go, and I didn't want to pee in my pants.  I get off on this exit that I don't know where it is, and make my way towards my normal route.  I finally get there and the red light hits, and I'm not allowed too turn on a red light!  Again, I'm realizing that the joke is being played.  I turn with peopel driving slow, and finally hit the street I needed too turn on.  ANd stupid me, I'm still drinking that soda, because I'm thirsty!  I get too Mission, and there's no left turn only.  It's just a green light, and yield too the light!  I'm not sure how many cars were coming this way.  Never have this many cars went this way.  Again, I'm trying sooo hard not too laugh, because it's just funny!  I turn, and a car accident almost happen, and I finally went home!  Got out of the car, open the back door to the regular house only too have Convict sitting next too there wanting too go inside the house, which he's not suppose too, and he  dashes in there.  I try too get him, with me still needing too go.  Finally grab him, put him back in the laundry room and go to the restroom!  My goodness I've never laughed soo hard towards a joke like that.  Any-way I thought I write it down because I do not want too forget that!"

"event","I woke up this morning studying for one of two test I have too take for Govenrment!  For some reason I'm stressing out over the final.  It's going too be hell.  I have too study for those two test.  A paper that's due tonight, A scene with Bri that's do tomorrow, and a math test that I have next week.  Although I'm not really worried about the math test.  Ad you know what the sad part abotu everything is... MY BIRTHDAY lies on FINALS!  Every damn year!  What's up with that?!I'm use too it.  Last year for my 21st Birthday, I did absolutley nothing!  I did take two finals that day and night.  So I did something.  though this thursday I'll have one final for math, and that's it.  So it's not that bad.  I probably still won't do things next week.  I wanted too plan a party, but the holidays are sort of a bad time too do those, because people are throwing holiday parties and most people are going home for the holidays.  It kind of sucks, but like I said before I'm use too it.  I just hope I get what I want for my birthday and Christmas.  That's a present from God though...

With everything going on, I start working today at Starbucks.  YIPEE!  I'm very excited about it.  I know I'll hate it later, but right now I'm lovin' it!  T'is going to be a great day.  I work out afterwards, go too government, and come home and slumber my problems away.

I had a dream last night!  For goodness sake I forgot about it!  But I do remember one piece of it that made total sense too me.  What does nudity mean in a dream?  I've always wondered that.  I know it means something and I can't put my finger on it.  Also, what does it mean too stop time?  I found those accpects of my dream interesting.  I stopped time, and some people in my dream were naked.  Plus other things happen, and right now I'm drawing a BIG BLANK on what else happen.  CRAP!  Okay, well that was the jist of it.  Any-who.  Stressful next couple of weeks and a new beginning for myself with Starbucks.  Take the care.

Take the Care and God Bless"

"event","A lot has happen today.  Great things, tragic things, accomplished things, and overall and nice day too be living.

Woke up this morning with the intention too do something CRAZY!  I did it!  I... CUT... MY HAIR!  Well, my barber did.  It's all the same.  Last night talking with Becky, I was told too live life too its fullest.  Of course cutting my hair is a start, but I took her advice and didn't look back towards it.  I woke up, pressed it so it wouldn't get tangled, and cut that long hair I've been growing for a year.  It was somewhat symbolic.  If you think of Samson and his long hair, how he gained stregnth from it.  I figured a change had too be done and cut the hair too give me stregnth.  I guess it can work like that.  Samson didn't have his hair, and he ate some spinach and he got stronger.  Well, that was the Popeye version I remembered when I was a kid.  I got too school, and it seems  I wasn't the only one who cut his or her hair.  Bri cut hers, and so did Jesse.  Although I was told I was hot with it, so go figure.  Karina and Niel where the biggest compliments, because, well getting a compliment from a gay guy ROCKS!  Plus recieving one from a lesbian is sure as hell cool.  She doesn't like men and she said I was HOT! All I have too say is ""SIZZLE""!

Great things happen, but a tragic lost was told.  Krystal Whiteside lost her younger brother.  He was 21.  I hope I'm saying this right but he died of Muscle Disentary.  It sounds right, but I'm usually wrong, but he was handicapped all of his life, and was actually suppose too die three years ago, but lived another great three years.  It's a blessing in a way that he's not suffering anymore, but the lost is very devistating.  I was told by Krystal that her parents are taking this hard, and Krystal herself is not doing so well.  If anything, losing someone has a great affect on someones person.  I remember losing my grandfather three years ago.  Becky told me a story of her father that died a year and a half ago.  She's going too be dealing with it.  Especially around these holidays it can be tough.  I felt ashamed of myself when both Becky and Krystal told me about their tragic losses.  Here I am thinking losing Kristin was horrible, these beautiful young ladies won't see their loved ones again.  I'm not saying I compared the lost too Kristin too thier losses, but I think I'm better off knowing I can move on with this.  Krystal will not move on for awhile.  I pray for her, her family and a peaceful resting in peace for David Aaron Whiteside.  

A lot was learned today.  Here's a scene from this morning that I learned from.

(Setting: Little Theatre 10:30am)

Audra:  OH MY GOD! I thought we were meeting at 10:30am!?

Laurie:  No, we were suppose too be here at 10:00am

Audra:  OH MY GOSH! I was tired and I didn't realize...

Laurie: It's okay Audra!  Fill out this questionare.

(Several Minutes Later)
Audra: MY GOD! I Feel So BAD!... You Don't know How bad I feel!

Mikey:  Let it go Audra!!!!... (Mikey thinks about what he said...)

Mikey's Mind: **Did I just say that?**

(Curtain Call)

Basically, I told Audra something I should have listen too.  The advice was given, and it was probably more for myself then anyone else.  I've been dealing with this burden about what happen too me several weeks ago.  Now, Kristin has forgiven me... I don't know how many times, but she's forgiven me.  Still I couldn't help but feel bad for what I did.  Talking with Becky yesterday, and saying what I said too Audra, am going too take that advice and run with it.  Lesson Learned!

Went to go visit my grandparents.  They loved my new haircut.  Basically, they hated the old style of my long hair!  Grabbed some Thai food, and went on my way back too school.

Went too Shakespeare.  BRi and I worked on the scene, and I have too say, that it's funny as hell!  Or maybe not!  It's very physical, and I'm loving it!!!!!!

Before that, I had a great talk with Jesse.  In fact, I think he was worried what I would think about the situation.  For one, I'm very happy for them both.  I could care less, even if they didn't tell me, because I can understand why they wouldn't.  I love them both very much and value what they've done for me.  I told him, if the situation becomes bigger then it should involving other people, I am going too put my foot down and basically do the right thing.  I'm willing too lose friends over this, if it gets out of hand.  I know these people at Citrus.  They LOVE too get involved in othe peoples business!  They've done it before, and I know they would too do it again!  But if it happens, I'm putting my foot down firmly.  Kristin, Jesse, Bri and myself don't need this.  Of course, Kristin doesn't have to worry about it that much, only for Jesse's sake, and Bri, in my opinion be fine.  Jesse will have too go through people disliking him for what he did.  I'm sure I'll get the whole ""You shouldn't talk too him for what he did!""  In fact I know that's what Karina wanted too talk too me about today.  Well, again, I'm willing too lose friends over this situation because I feel people won't understand the true meaning of what happen.  Kristin and Jesse were just following their hearts.  It just happen too be at this particualar time.  I learn in the past couple of months that following your heart is something people should do.  If Kristin didn't follow her heart, she wouldn't be with me.  If I didn't follow mine,  i wouldn't be with Kristin.  If Kristin still didn't follow her heart after our break-up then I'm sure she would have been miserable.  I personally do not want that for anyone.  Especially Kristin.  I love her too death, and am willing too let her follow what she feels right.  In fact following that, I'm currently following my heart. My heart belongs too no one.  Lately I've been looking for something with people, and figured that I need too let my God let it happen.  He's done it in the past, and he'll do it again.  He, and he alone knows what's right for me.  Following my heart right now is not leading me too anyone in particular, though it's leading me too my family, to my friends, and too myself.  I've learned from what I did wrong as a person, and as a psycho.  I learned from wrong and right.  I learned that hurting in life is something we need or should experience.  It may make us stronger, or weak, but in the future, we learn from its knowledge.  Pain for me right now is weakness leaving the body.  It's making me a lot stronger then I'd hope for.  I'm not looking for love.  Love is something that should be felt.  I don't feel it, but when I do, it'll be worth that wait.  I have nine days intil my birthday and 18 days until Christmas.  I've been thinking of what I want.  It's a thing that I can't give myself.  It's not material.  In fact, it's more then what I deserve.  I don't even deserve this, but I do want it.  It's saying a lot too ask for, but I would love Kristin's frienship.  As a matter of fact,  I would love too be her best friend.  That's a very strong present too wish for.  I mean, it's something that I can't pick up from any store or place that sells things.  It's something I have too earn.  It would mean a lot for myself if I can get that.  I don't deserve it one bit out of my life, but I'm asking for it.  That's all I can say about that.

Take care and God Bless"

Got up! Stretched! Wrote in my live journal!  Went to bed! Got up at 11am.  Did some homework! Talked with Becky!  She's AWESOME!  I figured if I can't date her, then I might as well be her friend, because she's freakin' amazing!  I love her!  well, the parts I know of her.  I hope too get too know her more.  Worked out!  Ran for 2 miles.  Best EVER!  Went to El Pollo Loco.  A child recognized me from SHowdown.  I said Hi.  Ate some chicken and rice, and worked on bri's and I scene for Thursday!  It's quite HILARIOUS!  Went home listening too A MIGHTY WIND soundtrack.  Nothing but folk songs on the album.  It's GREAT!  Came home and did another live journal!  There and there.  I'm talking too Bri right now about CANDY!  That's RIGHT, CANDY!  

Tomorrow I'm something SHOCKING!  and possibly STUPID!  But it's something I WANT TOO DO, BECAUSE I just thought about it an hour ago!

"event","I have too confess something.  I basically told some people that I don't have a live journal anymore, but I decided too write a new and better one for my benefit too just start my new and exciting life over. I'm very excited about this one, and hopefully will just keep on bettering my personal life with struggles, heart aches, and even the good stuff like love and crap.  
 
YEsterday was cool!

I first got up and went to church!  I went to Christ Valley of the Church (CCV) and I loved it.  I'm thinking of joining it.  It looks great.  The people there are nice.  I met this one guy named Mike.  He greated me too some people.  It was awsome.  Pastor Chuck was cool.  I felt someone speaking too me about pain today.  I have this burden that I'm trying too deal with right now.  It has too do with the fact that I hurt someone that I really care about.  I did this awful thing too Kristin last month, and for some reason, I can't get over the fact that I made her mad.  It's something I can't get rid of.  I basically called her last night or text her and wanted too talk too her.  Realizing that she wants too leave the past behind her, I decided not too talk too her about the situation.  She then found out that that's whay I wanted too talk about and didn't want anything too do with it.  I really upset her.  She's forgiven me for the incident, but I can't let that pain go.  I mean what I had with her I don't want too forget, but apperantly she does.  It's hard too phathom, but I'm sure it's for the best.  I treated her with disrespect after we broke up.  I can't believe I did it, and I just can't stop thinking about it.  I prayed for the pain too go away, and I feel it'll take me awhile for that burden too come over me.  I have no feelings for her, but I do miss that frienship we had so tightly.  I really, really need to get over it!  I pray it'll go away.  The cool thing I learned was that don't be afraid too ask God for what you want, in the long run you'll benefit from the results.  How crazy and awesome is that!  I'm coming back this Tuesday for Bible Study.

After service, I went to Brianna's house in La Habra.  We had some Panda Express, talked and we worked on our Shakespeare scene, and I have too admit, this one is going too be cool.  We made some really great choices.  We then messed with Herb online and then I went home.  She seems too be cool.  We talked about the situation we're in right now, and said we have each others backs if it gets out of hand.  The situation is going to stay between the four of us.  I thank God Kristin doesn't have too worry about it as much since she's at La Verne.  Jesse and Bri will have that issue with folks.  I'm there too stop any nonsense that occurs towards Brianna and towards Jesse from nosey people at Citrus.  I'm honestly willing too lose friends if this gets out of hand.  I love all three of these people with all my hearts and don't want this too get out of hand.  I pray it stays safe and everything and everyone is happier in the long run.

I had the courage afterwards too call Becky.  I was thinking about it all day in fact.  She's a great girl that I really want too know.  To make a long story short... Her and I have a date today at 2pm.  I'M SO HAPPY ABOUT THAT!  I can't believe it though.  I mean, I asked her out... She said yes, and I'm just happy about it.  Talking too beautiful women is hard for me.  i can't muster the courage too even say anything too them.  It's happen this year alone, and already I'm off too a great start.  Though we're just going too talk.  I'm not sure where we're going, but I know it'll be cool.  She said she LOVES double doubles from In and Out!  You wouldn't see it with how skinny she is.  

Talk too Norman.  Thanked him for helping me out.  He seemed cool .  Had some lady friends over when I was talking too him... GROWL!

TEN MORE DAYS!  22!  That's just me getting old!

Take care and God Bless"

"event","Dearest Journal.

I had my last and final show of the YEAR!!!  Am I excited that it's over?  In a sense.  I was in three prodctions this semester.  

""100 Dresses"" went well.  We went to so many different schools touring.  It was fantstic.  Of course getting up at 4:00am to be at school around 6:00am was actually not that bad.  I'm more of a morning person right now, so it worked out well.  Touring the different schools was a blast.  Children love our portrayals of characters they read about.  Whether they laughed or cried, or just plane had fun, it was really cool.  I had the chance too work with Laurie Woolery.  How amazing was that?  It made my day working with her, especially during all of the emotions I was going through at that particular time.  I learned a lot.  I can go into detail about what I learned but I don't want too bore myself reading it later. 

""The Curious Savage"" was fantastic.  I was added into the mix as one of the inmates.  I couldn't see the play done any other way.  First off I believe the friends I made in that play were just the greatest people in the world.  Everyone poured their heart out in those characters.  Norm and I have admitted that our characters were the best.  Because we said so, and if anyone has a problem with that... then they can basically go do something too themselves... HMPH!  Learning a new character from scratch was amazing character work.  I had set myself on accomplishing what I wanted in my role as ""Eugene"".  Cherie Brown, who I have worked with this whole year, has been amazing towards my knowledge of becoming an actor.  I worked with her in three shows as an actor under her direction and as a co-actor.  She's amazing!  When she acts, she does exactly what she teaches!  I LOVE THAT WOMAN!  I would have eight of her children... I'll even birth them, HELL!  Her and I have birthdays back to back from each other.  It's awsome!  I'm December 16th and she's December 17th.  I'm going to get her something great!  Like something funny! HA! I love her!

""Showdown at the North Pole Corral"" was fun!  Playing Maurice Le Vile De La Nasty has been a delight!  WOrking with Hilary is amazing!  I have so much respect for that woman because she's so damn funny and sarcastic! I LOVE IT! You don't know how much I love sarcasm!  Especially in a woman!  The experience with working with Allison, Kristie, Ashley, Roschanda, Tony and Norman is that I love them all too death!  I have so much respect for them!  It's amazing working with them.  I've met a lot of great people in this show, starting off with Christina, who's a little darling.  She's talented and very very cute in her own way.  Alex, who was our Santa, is funny as hell on and off stage.  It's fantastic!  Jordan is someone who I just freakin' love too death!  Well, not in that way, but he's an amazing guy.  That's someone I would love too just hang out with and chat with.  He's cool.  I've met more techies on this show then any other.  Shawn who I'm going too hang out with soon, is a really awesome person.  He's just funny, and a great person.  Him and I just talked abotu stupid things and just laughed.  He wanted too hang out, so that'll be cool.  Theresa is sweet.  I had my doubts about dating her and I wouldn't.  But I love her frienship dearly!  It's one of those things where I can be comfortable around her and tell her anything.  She's cool, and I hope we remain really cool friends.  No more driving out too Rancho Cucamonga to go see her though!  That's too damn far!  Becky... THis girl is great!  I couldn't stop thinkin about her this past week.  Oh my goodness, she's adorable!  I got her number, and now! I have too call her! That's the hard part!  That's the part I hate more then anything.  Why? Because I don't know what too say.  But I'll be cool and just take it one step at a time.  This show was a great learning experience.  You learn how children think and you see them have a grea time, and only wish you were there with them.  THat's my understanding of entertaining children.  You always have too communicate the story too them.  Always.  This made me realize that I may want too be an elementary school teacher.  I want too learn more about this and weill persue this dream if it kills me.... Well if it kills me then I guess I won't be a teacher then.  OH POO!

Everything is over and one thing i learned was staying positive with yourself helps a great deal.  I have a tendacy too see the picture a little bigger then peopel whatever it may be, but I need to see what structure everything has become of this fantasic year.  Every year I think about it!  How much have I grown?  This year has given great things too be thankful for.  I really know I've been blessed with many beautiful things.  I think back from January recieving ""Jaimie"" from Hot L too meeting new and exciting people.  Plus the heart ache I went through with a devistating blow.  You learn and you learn, and I know I'll learn about this year more in the next five to six, to my life is shrivled and I'm on my death bed.  I recieved beautiful things and I may have taken them for granite, but now I Look back and thank my Lord for what he's given me.  I was happy. I was hurt, I was crushed, I was in love, I was hit, I was loved, and above all else I was learning.  December 16th hits this year as ny milestone of look back at what a great year it was too be 21 years of age.  December 16th hits and I turn 22.  What I want for my birthday is too be able too look back at my mistakes and fortunes of this year and never, ever take them back!  I learn from the best and from the worst!  I would want too know that everything I did this year, was me moving on from the best year of my life too another year, and so forth.  However this year ends, I'm thankful I learned from everything and can let my life float on.

Take care and God Bless"

"event","Saturday is here.  The only thing that I can't seem to phantom is that I usually get things wrong most of the time.  It's a little annoying too me.  Theresa and I hung out and oddly enough I had a great time.  We went to Victoria Gardens and got Hilary some chocolate for the show.   We then went to Barnes and Nobles to read some books, and then went up too this place where we could basically see the whole county of San Bernardino.   For some reason, it was fascinating.  I enjoyed the whole scenery of lights flickering and what not.  It was beautiful.  We talked for a good two hours about random things.  I seem too be doing some dumb things right now as well.  I had a wrong impression of Theresa.  She's a great person.  We won't get together in any way shape or form but she basically has a good heart about things.  She wanted too throw a suprise party for me, but everyone was too busy too do it right now, which I undestand because of the holidays.  She's a sweet person.  

I was thinking about my dinner with Kristin right now, and had this feeling... that she might have not enjoyed what she was talking too.  I changed, but I feel when I look back on it and even when I was talking too her that I felt that I was pushing the fact that ""I'M OKAY"".  Which is a little annoying too some people, but right now the uncomfort is coming from both sides, more her then me though.  I feel it'll take so much time for us to even start talking again.  I admit.  I screwed it up by being beligerent and stupid about handling the break up and honestly I wish I can take it back.  It still bothers me that I did that.  I don't know why.  I want her frienship relly bad, but I guess not bad enough for her too get hurt again, so I can't push that factor towards her anymore.  It's all up too her now.  I have too stay away.  I really do.

Showdown closes tonight, and if I can et everything out of my head, then I think wwe'll have a great show.  I want to talk to becky today.  I hope that goes well, plus everything else right now.

"event","Today was cool.  We had the show and then we went out too eat at BJs.  Hilary was so great, that she paid for the whole cast.  IT was awesome.  I had SHrimp Scampi pasta, and some po-tater skins.  Talk and joked with Norm and Jordon.  It was nice.  

I talked to Sean today.  He seems like a cool cat.  He goes snow boarding and surfing.  Something that I want to take up.  It sounds interesting.  He was telling me that he's a mascot for the Anahiem Ducks.  They have a few mascots or people who do it and he's one of them.  That's so cool.  We chatted and he seems like a cool person.  Someone I would like to just talk to more.

I found out something today that was cool.  Becky, who's name I thought was Amanda is interested in me as well.  What are the odds?  SHe's also very involved with her family which is a big turn-on.  She takes care of her grandmother and her siblings.  I think that really great for her.  I said that I would ask her today but I figured I do that tomorrow.  It's tomorrow or never.  

Theresa and I hang out tonight.  Should be interesting.

"event","I had my dinner with Kristin.  It was what I expected.  She figured it wasn't a big deal as well so I'm glad we just talked about what was going on in our lives.  I talked too her about this new girl I'm smitting.  She talked about her new beau and it was cool.  We went to Sizzler and ordered a salad bar.  It was a little uncomfortable, because of everything that was going on but we basically talked and just forgot about things.  It was great.  I'm not sure when we'll see each other again, but I'm glad we had a new step in our future frienship. 

I have an issue.  The issue is named Jenny, Theresa and Nichelle.  I'm not sure what the problem between them is but they trying so hard to pair people up.  That's not the whole problem.  It bothers me that they get involved in other peoples business.  It bothers me so much.  I've had it with them.  So, I've decided... not to tell anyone anything about anything going on with me.  Right now there is a situation between Bri, Jesse, KRistin and I.  It's not a big deal, but people are going too find out and they're going to make it a big deal.  I'm going to put my foot down if anything happens between the three of us.  Kristin is not at the school, which makes it a lot easier for her, but I know there's going too be DRAMA!

On the other hand, I FOUND OUT HER NAME!  It's not Amanda, it's Becky.  Sean told me.  I'm smitting this girl soo much.  I think I'm going too ask her out tomorrow.  Why not?  What do I have too lose?  Tis a great day and a great week for yours truley... Amen."

"event","Tis the second day of December and NOW, I'm getting syked for my birthday.  I'm not sure what I'm going too do, but it should be fun.  Theresa's taking me out on the 17th, which I'm a little scared about.  I'm really scared about it. BUT, I'm going go and have a great time.

Twas the third run of our show today and a success.  I did jump K.P. and Allison's lines today and I felt bad about that.  For some reason, I thought that they were repeating themselves and thought they were stuck, so I just jumped in with my lines.  OH WHATEVER, the show went well today.  After I talk to the children who love the play.  It was great.  We're practically soled out on both shows Saturday.

I got to talk too Amanda today... a little.  Here's the thing... Her name may not be Amanda.  That's what I thought it was.  For some reason I thought Tony knew her and that her name was Amanda.  I have too figure out what her name is.  She's soooooo cute.  I think I'm in love... I think.... I think... Well maybe not.  But I am soo interested.

Tonight Kristin and I have dinner together concerning something she would like too talk  too me about.  I have a thought on what it is.  Like I said, if it's what I think it is, then I'm fine with it.  Of course we're at a place where she  feels uncomfortable around me and I may as well, but not as much as her.  I did some stupid things and I'm SHOCKED she even wants to talk let alone have dinner.  Maybe she wants too talk again.  I hope so.  I value her frienship.  I really do.

I have a doctors appointment today about some headaches I've been recieving.  They're not bad.  But I had them a week or two ago and now they're gone, but I want too talk too a doctor about it.  

That's my day, and my night.  Caio!"

"event","You know it's funny.  This year, I haven't been looking too foward too my birthday.  It's not because I'm getting older and all that.  But I have this thing this year where I've been getting a lot of great things in my life.  I've had a wonderful 2004.  It's been marvelous.  The thing I want for my birthday is too have everything back too normal.  It's going that way right now.  Normal for me is too be happy.  I've been very happy this year, and I'm going end the year very happy.  I have my 22nd birthday coming up in sixteen days.  That's the last day of my finals and it's the day I want too do something... Although, I'm not sure what I want too do.  I may, or may not grab friends together too hang or something.  We'll see.  It's always hard because it's the begenning of the holiday season and everyone leaves.  So we'll see what I can do in a couple of weeks.  SIXTEEN DAYS!!!!

Today was great!

Showdown today was great.  The children love my character.  I'm excited about that.  One thing I love is that they get so involved with it and just have a great time.  After the show when we're passing out candy canes, the children come up too me and ask if I really like Ms.  Delila.  In the show, my character, my evil character has a crush on the heroene, Ms. Delila DeLovely.  They get into in when they ask me if I really like her.  So I play along and just have fun.  IT'S GREAT... ONE of the wonderful reasons I want children of my own.  Another great reason on why I want too become an elementary school teacher.  I want too be there to just enrich their minds with wonderful knowledge that they can use towards their life of their future.  I LOVE IT!

After I went to Starbucks for the interview, BUT it's NEXT WEEK!!!  So, I have an extra week to just chill before I can have some fun working again, plus I have too send my resume too some offices that I may want too work at.

Tomorrow Kristin and I have dinner concerning something she wants too tell me.  I pretty much, I THINK, I know what she wants too talk too me about.  I senced it for a couple of weeks.  Who know's though?  I may be wrong.  But if it's what I think it is, then I perfectly legitamley okay with it.  I've moved on too my own future and am happy with anything she wants too do.  I really mean that from the bottom of my heart.  We'll see where this dinner takes our bondship.  I'm excited in a way because she wants too talk over dinner.  I mean, we could have just talked on the phone, but this might be a good start too an even better friendship.  (Crossing My Fingers Everything Goes Wonderful).

Tomorrow I have ""Showdown..."" once again, and before that, I want too go work out.  THat requieres me too get up early and too be at school by at least 6:30am.  I work out for an hour, run, grab something too eat, get ready for the show, and then Shakespeare.  ALSO, I want too talk to Amanda more.  I really dig this girl.  I mean she's been on my mind all the time.  I really want too talk too her, BUT I have too talk to Theresa about us, because I don't want her too get the wrong impression about what I want.  Too reiterate(sp?), I told her I wasn't ready for anything because I'm still getting over my ex.  It's been several weeks and I'm over her now... I don't want too tell her that, because she said when I was, that she'll be there waiting... NOW that I moved on, I don't want too date her.  Now I have too talk too her and set this right.  The one thing I don't want to do is hurt her.  I better tell her now, before it's just too late.  WISH ME LUCK!

SIXTEEN MORE DAYS and then TWENTY FIVE MORE DAYS.... What do I want for my birthday and Christmas?  World Peace?  Possibly!  A new shirt?  well, it's better then an old.  OH How about SUSPENDERS?  Yes, some of those rainbow kind.  Oh this will be the joy of all of my birthdays...  Now, what too get people... I'll think about it the day before...

Take care and God Bless"

"event","Well Well Well.  Another post and another great day.  After I had ""Showdown...""  I went to grab something too eat at El Pollo Loco.  That was good and then too Shakespeare.  Bri and I are doing a scene together from Act I, Scene III.  I""m playing Fool and she's playing Viola, who's personating Cesario.  T'is funny.  

Went to hang with Bri and Jenny before I went too work out.  Jenny asked me too be her scene partner for ACTF in Arizona.  If she picks a scene between a a male and female, then I said I would.  So cool.  Arizona will be fun!  

I went to work out which felt really really great!  I worked out and  ran for 1 and 1/2 miles in under 14 minutes.  isnt' that cool?  I was soooo freakin' pumped and not tired after the mile.  IT was cool.  During the run I started praying asking God too make my heart stronger and what not.  I basically prayed and just let him talk too me as much as I can.  After the mile I had a great feeling in me.  

Kristin called me.  Suprise.  She wants to do dinner on Thursday.  She has too talk too me about something.  I may have an idea of what she wants too talk about, but I'm all ears for her.  This is a cool and nice step for the future.   Whatever she needs too tell me, I'm ready for.  I'm hoping for the best and expecting the worst.  

I then went to church  for bible study.  I was a little late.  So they almost started the next class which was Women's Bible Study.  

So I left, and went home too watch Jeopardy! and watched Ken Jenning get beat!  H & R BLOCK!  Oddly enough, I knew the answer!  

Something cool... ""You Outta Know"" by Alanis Morisette was written about her ex, who was Dave Coulier... yeah the dude or Uncle Joey from Full House.  Isn't that far out?

I met this girl today.  Well I seen her around, but just talked too her more today.  Her name is Amanda.  She's soo cute!  Her and I chatted a little.  We were passing out candy canes too the little childrens and we were just talking and messing around.  She's cool.  I want too get too know her more.

Speaking of women, Theresa, I think is head over heels for me.  The thing is, at the time she wanted to date me, I wasn't ready too date because I wasn't over my ex.  Now that I am, I still don't want too date.  She has this idea that she'll be the one I'll go too when I'm ready.  I haven't told her that i am, but I don't think I can right now.  I found out that her, Nichelle and Bri are going lingire shopping next week, and then she wants too take me out for my birthday.  I don't know if I'm ready.  Jenny said that whenever she talks too her, it's always about me.  And sometimes about how she wants me... and I MEAN WANT!  I'm not ready for that, so I'm not sure what's going too happen in the next week or two... HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOO ME!"

Projection is something I can handle, but diction is something I need to get the hang of.  That'll be hard with this character... ""Maurice La Vile De La Nasty"".  Cool name.  The children loved it and some of them remember me from a ""100 Dresses"".  That's cool.  

Later on I have Shakespeare, then I'm working out, and then I'm going to Bible Study at CCV.  That should be cool.  I""m pretty excited about that.  I don't know why.  ALl right, take care and God Bless."

"event","MOnday is here, and I'm ready for anything that happens this week.  I""m expecting the worst and hoping for the best.  That's all I can do right now.  I have too create a checking account today, I have to call Starbucks back, I need to see about another school in the future, a new church too go too, and then I have too be at school at 4:00pm for rehearsal and then a preview night for ""Showdown..."".  It's going to be one of those long days, but I'm not going to complain about it.  I have to write my resume, and I have to check on a lot of things today.  Busy. Busy, productive day.

Last night I did the driving around town without a stop.  I did stop too talk too Michelle who I texted.  She's a cool gal.  I use too work with her at JPL.  Interesting when you don't see that person anymore how much you start too miss them.  I mean, that's happen with my ex and now for some reason her.  Hmm.  Went driving and came across Mt. San Antonio College where I was thinking about going in the fall of 2005.  Then  I went to CCV, a church where I think I want to go.  They have services on Tuesday where I might check it out, but defitnetley on Wednsday because of College night.  THat's something I need to get into.  

Of course I've given up on waiting for my ex response too the letter.  I know it's been the weekend, and she got it on Thanksgiving, but I think for some reason, that she doesn't want to be my friend... at all.  ANd I Have to be fine with that.  It doesn't hurt me as much as I thought it would.  Besides, we're beginning different styles of lives.  I have too say though there isn't a day that goes by telling myself that I wish I did things differently.  I really did.  I choke, I learn.  What else can I do but wait once again for her trust.  That's what i want.  Forget everything else.  She's already forgiven me, but long wait, and I do mean long wait is for her too just say hi, and for us too move on, or  me too move on.  It's funny though, because the more I think about her, little by little it goes away.  I haven't seen her, talk too her or had one conversation with her in the past week, and that's a big step.  It's not a game I'm playing.  I'm basically waiting for her too call, and say she trust me again or at least she feels comfortable with me as a person.  Time dwells all wounds and right now time is defitnetley on my side.

Feel free 
Throw it down (the caution blocks you from the wind) 
Hold it up (to the rays) 
You wait and see when the smoke clears 

You live you learn 
You love you learn

"event","Well Well Well.  I have come back from having lunch with Theresa.  She's an all right girl.  I'm not sure if anything will happen between us.  We'll see.  She really likes me, and I'm just wanting too hang out.  Her and I had lunch at Denny's today.  She'd mentioned how much different I was.  You see, in the past couple of months, I've been really moppy and sad because of incidents.  When she met me, she liked me, and I was afraid she was liking someone that wasn't there.  She saw the real me today, because I was just in a chipper mood today and she basically liked that as well.  Though she was a little shock too see me just say stupid crazy things or sing for no apparent reason.  Any-who, I like her, but I'm not interested in her in any form of dating.  She likes me a lot, and I just don't want too hurt her in that way.  I am interested in a few people.  I just think I should keep my options open because I am single right now, and shouldn't look for anything.  I'll just let it find me and take it from there.  

Went to the church today and I have too say... well, I didn't go in because services start at 10:00am and that's when I had rehersal.  So I'll go next week.  That'll  be cool.  I'm home now, maybe I'll do some studying for some test this week and get ready for finals.  That'll be cool.  PLus I might read ""Oh Dad Poor Dad, Mama's Hung in the CLoset and I'm Feeling Sad"" again.  It's a funny play.  Take care and God Bless"

"event","HA!  My grandmother walked in on me while I was in the restroom.  T-was funny.  Today I'm going to a new church, or at least, I'm going to try to go too it, because I don't know what time it starts.  It's in La Verne and it's a Methodist church.  A Buddy of mine use to go too it and he said it's pretty cool.  Then I have rehearsal, and then looking for another job.  Macy's is cool, but that's just seasonal, and I have too spice up my resume and start a move on.

Last night I went too be bed early so I can get ready for this day.  We'll see how it all works out for me.  Church, rehearsal, Job Hunting, and then sleep."

"event","Yesterday I started my new job at Macy's.  It's not that bad.  I had too do training with the register.  That seemed like it took forever.  Pretty much did.  Four hours later I was ready to leave... and I did, because I was there from 1:00pm - 2:00pm and did training from 2:00pm - 6:00pm.  I leave at 6:15, so I had a good one hour and fifteen minutes of work.  T'was cool.  After work, I went home and just slept until I could.  I woke up at 10:00pm, and went to Denny's.  For some reason the drive from here to San Dimas gives me a kick in the pants.  I've actually grown acustomed to the peopel work there now, since I've been going pretty much every night now.  THat's sad isn't it?  Well, I've been going to just be by myself.  I've read, wrote letters and just did whatever I can just too be away from society.  Right now, I can't hang around people.  It's not that I hate them, but being by myself right now helps me out.  I love it.  I don't have too pay for anyone, I can talk to myself about anything, and I don't have too argue with anyone about anything.  It's cool.  Though afterwards I managed too do a little driving.  I drove from San Dimas all the way to Chino.  THat's far... if you take the streets.  I just drove and didn't want to stop.  I managed too take the freeway back from Chino all the way to San Gabriel.  Then I went too bed.

I've been thinking a lot about my life.  What do I want?  What do I need?  What is it that God wants?  All these crazt ideas in my head, and all I can come up with is this... I want a family some day.  I mean, I think that's not common in today's society.  People are avoiding marraige and having children.  More people now-a-days support abortion.  I want a family.  I really do.  I want too have children and raise them so they can be our future.  It sounds nuts but I'm being completely honest with myself right now.  I've been thinking about this for weeks.  I don't have that much in my life right now.  I'm settling on a holiday job right now, and I don't have that much money, but I want too start something that I can finish with pride... and I want that in my own family.  I want that struggle and I want too be happy.  I hope this is the right thing too want even at my age of 21.  I'm somewhat adventerous, but I can settle down now as well.  Why not?  I mean I will someday, and I just feel it's the right thing too do.  I may be talking out of my behind right now, but I just want what's best for the future.  Any-who, that's whats been on my mind and I know it could change, but right now that's what I want.  LAtely, all these girls I've been dating, I've been wanting too see if they would make good mothers... I know I shouldn't do that, but man, for some reason, a family has been on my mind...  I'm not sure why... Take care and God Bless."

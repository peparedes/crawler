obama AND mccain both only associate russia with ""putin"" and never mention the actual president--dmitry medvedev...weird?

and mccain thinks:
 ""russia is a KGB run government. i looked into mr. putin's eyes and i saw three letters--K, G, and B""

seriously, mccain is living in the past. the KGB doesn't exist anymore."

"event","America, please fucking tell me:

What is the big deal between USA/Georgia/Russia right now? For all of you who DON'T know the problem, read this, and then please tell me your opinion--who is wrong here?

GEORGIA started a war on ABKHAZIA and SOUTH OSSETIA (two regions attempting to be INDEPENDENT from Russia as they were a part of the USSR--Georgia was, too, until they broke off in '91) because GEORGIA wanted to take over those two regions to make them ALSO GEORGIA. Ok.

So RUSSIA went in with PEACEKEEPER troops to SOUTH OSSETIA and ABKHAZIA to save them from being attacked by GEORGIA trying to take them over. Ok, ok. 

SO...

RUSSIA did not penetrate into GEORGIA farther than a city on the Black Sea called GORI--RUSSIA did not go into TBILISI, the capitol of GEORGIA. Now the troops have held back but have decided that they will keep 3,800 or so PEACEKEEPER troops in ABKHAZIA and SOUTH OSSETIA to protect the regions from being taken over by GEORGIA because RUSSIA wants these two regions to have their independence.

Now AMERICA helps out GEORGIA by sending them military goods and whatnot (it's a good thing they're sending medical help for civilians, though, but damage to civilians in SOUTH OSSETIA and ABKHAZIA was not done by RUSSIANS, but by the GEORGIAN REBELS) to help ""stop the RUSSIANS""--although the RUSSIANS are for independence and peace.

So GEORGIA cries to AMERICA that RUSSIA is bad when GEORGIA started this all.



PS--little twist: American troops were in Georgia 1 week before this started (on August 7th, 2008) for a ""training mission""...Interesting. Now, why is America making such a big deal about Russian troops being in Venezuela for a ""training mission""--is it because America and Venezuela don't get along? What did America think about Russia and Georgia not getting along when they had their training mission...? Hmm.




Is this all serious??? What do you think?"

"event","I find it hard to let go--you're entitled to know that you've brought me nothing else but bliss, a great deal of frustration, and a voluntary occupation. You're driving me insane and off the wall...
We were free to choose each other, but now it seems different--have you placed me where I stand? We were afraid to lose each other and it got us this far. I have no bags to pack, no suitcase waiting in the hall. 

How did we forget? How could we forget?

So for months I'm going nowhere until I seize the day and place myself behind the wheel...Or I could end how I don't want to--the opposite of what I planned--I can watch the ships when they're abroad, or become a joke when people see me. It wasn't meant to be this way, so we'll give it days and days and try to make it easy. Once I believed I could approach it, but now I have faith placed in the things you call fate."

All I want to hear is everything's alright. Because I left my mind in the train station, my thoughts in a taxi, and my heart in reception. The last thing I saw was you. I called you because we've grown apart. This may seems absurd but I'm in the dark and somewhere at the end of all the air out there. 

I will always call because it's all that I can do."

There's not a milligram of Amoxicillan around, and I'm taking these weird Syrian antibiotics that are supposed to be really good and ""EXPENSIVE"" (but they were like $12 for a pack of 10...the economy here isn't that great). I had a temperature of 102 yesterday and I'm in a lot of pain.

<big>""The residents of Bend have an incredible fascination with burritos, and have therefore erected a number of burrito stands and dug many a burrito-centric hole in the walls, nearly all of which are fabulously cheap.""</big>


Do we SERIOUSLY have that big of a fascination with BURRITOS?

Westboro Church. I don't think it's much of a church, but a CULT. I can't say that I support troops being in Iraq, but these people cross the line. I came across these videos on www.liveleak.com --a really good site if you want to see all the videos the media isn't really showing you... I'd look at the last video, it's the best. I'm absolutely SHOCKED.


I thought this shit was FAKE...But it's real. This is a real man with real beliefs in this bullshit, I don't understand how people can be this way. Again, I'm really sorry if these videos offend anyone, the messages are awful in them. You want to know what the WESTBORO CHURCH website is???? www.godhatesfags.com --what the HELL.

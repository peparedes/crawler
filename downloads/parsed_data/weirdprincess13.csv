"event","Ok, i have 2 tell you wat happened 2day! I was hiiiiiilaaaaaaarious! For some reason my 2 sisters were totally hyper and for some random reason the older one (charis) stole Danielles trackies, and then sensibly, put them outside. So my little sis is hopping around using a jumper to try and cover her knickers (this didnt work by the way) she was reluctant to go out into the garden to get the trousers which is understandable considering the circumstances. But in the end she had to, but whilst she was outside charis cleverly locked her out their. So she ended up standing their trying to get her trackies over her bum and cover up!"

"event","I neva actually manage 2 write in my journal about anything remotely interesting. My life is not completely boring, I like it anyway. I juts dont see why i should write about it seeing as its interesting to me, but no one else. Because i kno my friends, my sisters and myself. Most people who read this wont kno all 3 at least. 

My sister sleep walked into my bed last night, she had no idea why she was there which was v.funny. eeeeeeerrrrrmmmmmm...

I'm really missing my old m8's, (if any of you are reading this: Busy saturday?)my only consolation is im making some new ones and other relationships r improvin, even tho ther still iffy."

"event","Hello!!!!!!!!!!!! I have just deleted my old entries cos the wer full of crap. Here is my first new entry.

Today I came back from the Thirst Houseparty which is the christian youth thing. it was fun. i feel confident in my relationship with God again which is supergood cos i was feeling pretty worried about that. 

I want to get involved with the whole 'make poverty history' thang. i saw some stuff in tanzania which i desperatly want to change. 

Cor this is even more crap than my old journal. I'm so messed up at the moment i have so much i could write but i feel apprehensive to reveal myself. I dont know what i can tell you that will releive me without giving away to much. 

I could tell you that ive pretty much lost an important friend in my life, we've only grown apart but i cant help but feel as if somehting important has ended. You could even cal it the end of an eara, an end to a part of my life which i dont know if i want to leave behind. I guess the basis of this realisation is me changing schools and creating new friendships, never with the intention of leaving anyone else behind. but now i somehow dont see any reason to make an effort, and they seem to think the same. 

In the midst of those problems i am confused about relationships too. Well confused may not be the word because i know what i want it's just getting it and knowing whether i should/could have it that confuses me. 

A while ago i felt really confused about my faith to. Even thought i knew that Jesus is my lord and he died for me and that the bible is the truth i didn't feel the same presence in my life. Luckily i now feel spiritually revived and happy not only with God but with myself.

I'm going to stop now

Lots of Love Lauren"

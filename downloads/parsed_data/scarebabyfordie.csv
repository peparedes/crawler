He had been on the committee for delegating school funds this semester and there hadn't been any discussion of this whatsoever. </p><p>""Where did this all come from?"" Shinya said aloud.</p><p>""From Morikawa-san of Morikawa Industries...said it was a gift, a token of his appreciation for everything the school is doing."" Kurama-Sensei said. His face betrayed the apprehension he was feeling. ""Something's not right here."" He said blankly.</p><p>""So, it's paid for?""</p><p>""Yeah. I guess so. I better get to that teacher's meeting. Say, have you seen Niikura?""</p><p>""No, his name was on the absentee list today.""</p><p>""Apparently, he's won a scholarship and there's going to be an award dinner for him.""</p><p>""Huh. Also from Morikawa-san?""</p><p>""Yes. It's a full scholarship to any prestigious college he wants. Damn, something is really fishy. Well, I'm going now. Excuse me."" With that Kurama-sensei headed down the hall at a quick step and turned the corner, vanishing from view.</p><p>Relieved that no one spent an exorbitant amount of the school's money on something as useless as video equipment, he turned around and slowly headed toward the gym. He hated P.E.</p><p>Sitting on the bleachers, Shinya fiddled mindlessly with his shoelace. The other students were dribbling and passing basketballs, but he claimed that he'd hurt his ankle so he wouldn't have to participate. The gym doors flew open with a metallic squeal, causing him to look up from his feet. His eyes followed a tall, lanky, strong-looking male student he'd never seen before as he entered the room. His classmates greeted the newcomer enthusiastically. His name was Die.</p><p>The red-haired man caught the basketball that was tossed at him and a game of four-on-four began. Die was a really awesome player. Shinya felt his cheeks warming as he silently cheered for his new hero.</p><p>P.E. passed quickly and the bell for the end of the period echoed through the gym area. Die and his fellow players whooped and hollered as they headed toward the changing rooms. Shinya followed, keeping his distance. He really wanted to be like the rest of them and have fun, but transferring from a polluted city school made him susceptible to illness or at the least, a general feeling of tiredness. Gym was stupid anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shinya tried to hurry but attempting to cross the entire length of the school and run down two flights of stairs was nearly impossible with only ten minutes between the end of the student committee meeting and the beginning of his next class.</p><p>Bounding down a flight of stairs, his foot struck the top step the wrong way and he flew headfirst down the stairs, crashing into someone who had been running up the stairs at almost the same speed. Both fell and rolled to the bottom of the staircase.</p><p>At first Shinya couldn't move. His body was pressed tightly under the person on top of him. Then he turned his head slightly and stared into the handsome face of Die. The man was just coming to and looked back without really comprehending any of what just happened. Then Die smiled.</p><p>Trying to pull himself up, he pushed up with his arms and started to get off of Shinya, but then he cried out in pain and collapsed back onto him.</p><p>""Aw, damn. I think I dislocated my shoulder."" Die said.</p><p>Just then, Takimura Sensei appeared on the top step and stopped dead at the sight of them.</p><p>""Wait! It's not what it looks like!"" Shinya yelped but the sensei spun around and went back upstairs in obvious embarrassment. ""Oh great, Die, now he thinks we're together!"" With that being said he shoved the other man off him.</p><p>""Ow?"" Die replied playfully.</p><p>""Oh man. I forgot you were hurt.""</p><p>""I'm not. You were so cute I couldn't help but have some fun with you.""</p><p>""Jerk."" Shinya started to get up but Die caught his arm and pulled him back down into a sitting position next to him. ""Hey!""</p><p>""Hey yourself. Say, my buddies and I were going to the Hydro Club tonight. You wanna come?""</p><p>""Huh? Me?""</p><p>""Well, you're the only person in this stairwell. C'mon, it'll be fun!""</p><p>""I never went to any place like that before, are you sure I won't embarrass you?""</p><p>""Um, dude, Takimura totally thinks we're getting it on and you think going to the club with me is embarassing?""</p><p>""Good point. Ok, I'll go.""</p><p>""Cool. You have a car, right?""</p><p>""Oh, I see. You just want a ride in the limo.""</p><p>""Sure, if you've got one. But man, I'm totally glad we're a couple.""</p><p>""Whaaaat? Stop that right now.""</p><p>""I can't help it, I'm a man in love!"" Die said teasingly.</p><p>""I oughta..."" Shinya glowered as he rose and began heading down the stairs.</p><p>""Hey, I'll see you after school?""</p><p>""Yeah, yeah, whatever."" He looked up at Die and saw that dashing smile beaming down on him. His face reddening, he turned away hurridly and quickened his pace down the steps.</p><p>Kyo stared blankly into the distance. The shady spot in front of the school was a favorite meeting place of most students eager to start their weekend. Each group clustered in anticipation of what they intended to do. The otaku were making plans to wait outside a store for two days to obtain the only copies of some weird anime. Tokyo University hopefuls were heading to the library for some heavy studying sessions. He was now sitting in a group full of jocks. Die had told him to meet him here. He was incredibly uncomfortable as the whole kendo team had plopped down on either side of him, casting him odd glances.</p><p>""Hey, you guys!"" Die said as he leaped from the wall above the group. He was greeted warmly by them all and then grabbing Kyo around his shoulders, he began introducing him to everyone.</p><p>Kyo went through the introductions letting the bigger men know he wasn't a threat and they turned out to be rather friendly. One of them, a senior named Hachibaiachi, gave him a long curious look but then smiled as if he'd made up his mind about something. ""Hey, Die, you said you'd get us a ride in style.""</p><p>""I did. I wonder where he is. I'll go look."" Die dashed off leaving Kyo to Hachibaiachi's intense gaze.</p><p>""So, Die invited you?""</p><p>""Yes. If it's a problem...""</p><p>""No, no. Just Die only invites people who have something to offer to the group and I was wondering why, but it seems like he just likes you.""</p><p>""I don't understand it myself. He always picked on me so mercilessly...""</p><p>""He likes you but I thought you were with Kuji.""</p><p>""Wha? I'm not gay or bi or whatever! That's just Kuji's way of messin' with people.""</p><p>""Actually if you saw the way Kuji actually messes with people, you'd know the difference between him being mean and being a flirt.""</p><p>""Flirt? What? You know Kuji?""</p><p>""Yeah, we went to school together briefly back in the day. Except then, I was his target. You see, Kuji's definitely gay but he's repressed about it. He torments the people he really likes.""</p><p>""Geez. Doesn't he realize I'm not gay?""</p><p>""Oh, I'm sure he does. He hates himself for liking you.""</p><p>""Huh.""</p><p>""Only difference between you and me is that I liked him back and still do.""</p><p>""Wow. Does he know?""</p><p>Just then, Die returned escorting a graceful-looking man and introduced him as Shinya and the guy who was going to let them ride in his limo. He was obviously of a wealthy family with good social standing so the group was somewhat intimidated, but then they realized he was just as nervous around them and their obvious strength.</p><p>""So! Let's go clubbin'!"" Die said cheerfully and motioned for Shinya to lead the way.</p><p>Shinya stared up at the big glowing signs for the Club Hydro. The whole place had scores of people milling around the front seeking access into the stronghold of the youth of elite society. Young, hip, and subsisting entirely on their parents' good fortune, they were able to purchase the expensive, trendy apparel needed to make a name for themselves among others their age.</p><p>With a sudden realization, Shinya saw that not even Die had been here before. They stood behind him as they exited the limo hoping that upon seeing him that the bouncers would not question their right to be there.</p><p>""Oh, so that's the game, huh? Use the rich kid to get in?"" Shinya whispered harshly to Die.</p><p>""Yeah, but you gotta admit this place is impressive. C'mon lover, back me up. We're both gonna have fun tonight."" Die replied in the same quiet undertone and grinned as Shinya scowled in response.</p><p>The bouncers eyed all of them up but with a quick glance at Shinya's ID, their whole demeanor changed. Suddenly, they became very friendly, realizing this was a rich man's son bringing his friends to the club and ushered them in, apologizing profusely for not recognizing him earlier.</p><p>Club Hydro was a huge place. The walls had water streaming down in front of them on large plates of glass and waterfalls interspersed between the various booths selling light toys and noisemakers. A gigantic dancefloor boomed in the distance beyond some cleverly placed tables. Waitresses in bikinis served drinks as the skidded around the floors on blue rollerskates. </p><p>""Wow. So that's why they call it Club Hydro.</p><p>Suddenly, the house lights came up and an announcer asked for everyone's attention in a loud booming voice. ""Ladies and gentlemen, the Ro-Ro Dance Party Contest is about to begin! Grab a partner and register now if you haven't yet. There are only 15 minutes left! Please register!""</p><p>""Aw, dang."" Die pouted. ""We just got here and we haven't met any chicks to dance with yet.""</p><p>""Why don't you just ask your little boyfriend if he'll dance with you?"" asked Tobi giving Shinya a nudge.</p><p>""Huh? What is this all about?"" Hachibaiachi asked Tobi. Any hint of gayness in other men always interested him.</p><p>""Takimura-sensei totally saw these two making out in the stairwell today. Overheard the whole conversation between him and the nurse. Shameless. Truly shameless!"" Tobi teased.</p><p>""That's right man! Anyone who talks smut on my boy better be ready to face the consequences!"" With that, Die planted a kiss right on Shinya's cheek.</p><p>""Oh, come off it."" Shinya said pushing Die away as everyone laughed.</p><p>""But seriously Shinya, would you dance with me? The prize is too good to pass up."" He was eyeing the new gaming system gleefully.</p><p>""No.""</p><p>""Please?""</p><p>""NO!""</p><p>""Pretty please?""</p><p>""No...""</p><p>""C'mon...or I'll kiss you again.""</p><p>""Oh, god, not that.""</p><p>""I'll do it!""</p><p>Shinya sighed before agreeing. If he didn't do this Die would never forgive him. ""Alright, whatever.""</p><p>""Yes! Let's go sign us up!"" Die and Shinya headed over to the registration table.</p><p>""Awww. Isn't that sweet?"" Tobi snickered.</p><p>""Shut up. Without a partner Die wouldn't have a chance at that new gaming system that nobody else has yet."" Hachibaiachi smacked the back of Tobi's head playfully and followed the others to the dancefloor ringside to watch the contest.</p><p>""Ow!"" Tobi ran after Hachibaichi. "" Hey, wait up! Isn't there another prize for the girl in this contest?""</p><p>""It's a mystery gift. See the three large boxes with the hearts on it? The winning girl will get to pick one. A little extra cuteness for the ladies I guess.""</p><p>Just then, the lights dimmed and the announcer officially opened the contest with another loud booming oratory. The faster-paced categories went first, but they didn't see Die or Shinya.</p><p>""What category do you think they signed up for? Do you think they were in time?"" Tobi asked in puzzlement.</p><p>""Yeah. I know they have a limit on how many couples can sign up for a category..."" Another announcement silenced their conversation. The mood of the room changed as the couples competing in the slow dance category took their places. Everyone stared in amazement as Die led Shinya to the floor. Some people snickered but the music began, a soft lilting tune from an ancient romance, and then were surprised at how easily Die swung Shinya around. Die was a superb leader and Shinya was very good at keeping up. Across the floor they waltzed until the music faded away and the two of them stood, embracing eachother, unable to take their eyes off one another.</p><p>""Thanks Shin. You were great.""</p><p>""You too.""</p><p>Suddenly the two realized they were being stared at and pushed eachother away.</p></font>"

"event","Chapter Four: Consequences <br /><br />Toshiya slowly opened his eyes. Curled up next to him was a pretty girl whose name he couldn't remember. He had pleased her and her smile whispered the promise of good money. <br />Just then, the door to the hotel room shattered inward as a spray of gunfire flew across the room. Toshiya sat bolt upright and the girl clutched him, screaming in terror. Three fierce looking men burst into the room. One grabbed the girl and drug her outside. The other two pulled him off the bed, punching him in the stomach as he fell to his knees with gasp of pain. <br />""Never touch Boss' girl. Ever!"" yelled one as he kicked Toshiya's face with a steel-toed boot. As he was saying this, the other one slid on a pair of brass knuckles. <br />Toshiya looked up in terror as the armored fist came flying at him. Everything flashed in blinding white pain and then mercifully went black. <br /><br />Kaoru lay facedown on a soft bed. He tried to move but his body was wracked with pain. Remembering vaguely the things that had been done to him, he clenched the sheets in disgust. Rolling over on his back, he stared at the unfamiliar ceiling, wondering if his parents were missing him. When he had gathered his strength, he got up slowly. <br />Limping to the bathroom, he ran a hot shower. He stood in it gratefully as the smell and sweat of his molester washed away. One thing was sure, he was thoroughly disgusted with himself, his father's boss, and Toshiya; the twerp who pulled him into that wretched club. <br />Wrapping himself in a towel, Kaoru went back into the living area of the penthouse suite. Hanging on a small hook on the far wall was his school uniform, clean and pressed. A vase of red roses sat on a table beneath it. <br />As he walked over and started to dress, he saw a note lying propped up against the vase. Opening it, he read it aloud, <br /><br /><em>""Dearest Kaoru, <br />You are a wonderful person. My gratitude for your company cannot be expressed with mere words. With that, I've discharged all your debts owed to the host club and beg of you to continue to be my most intimate friend. Believe me when I say that your kindness will not go unrewarded. <br />M.S.""</em> <br /><br />""Fuckin' pedophile."" Kaoru muttered and tossed the letter in trash. A bag sat on the floor next to the wastepaper basket. He reached in and pulled out the video editor he had bought. Grateful it hadn't been left behind, he returned it to the bag and hoisted it over his shoulder. Kaoru didn't even give the suite one last glance as he left. <br /><br />Kaoru headed in the direction of the train station. His pain had faded and his mood was improving. The major question on his mind at the moment was whether he should go home or go to school. He was already late. Sensei Kurama was probably upset that he hadn't returned with the editor in time. <br />He was muddling these thoughts over in his head so intently that he nearly tripped over a person lying on the sidewalk. <br />""Damn drunks."" Kaoru growled but then did a double-take; realizing this wounded being was none other than Toshiya. His face looked terrible, and his body was covered with blood and bruises. ""What did you do last night, playboy?"" <br />Toshiya looked back at him through swollen eyelids. ""I...She...was his girl..."" he replied slowly as the fresh wound on his cut lip split open again. <br />""Well, I hope you're pleased with yourself."" <br />""I'm sorry Kaoru, you were right. You are always right."" Toshiya's eyes welled up with tears. As much as Kaoru had been humiliated the night before, the pitiful sight of this boy begging for his forgiveness dispelled his urge to exact revenge. <br />""C'mon Toshiya. Let's go to the hospital."" With that he reached down and pulled the battered man-child to his feet; letting him lean on him for support. Slowly they headed in the direction of the hospital only a few blocks over. <br />""Thank you, Kaoru."" <br />""No problem."" was his only reply."

"event","Chapter Three: The Geek and the Playboy

	Kaoru sat in the AV room, stabbing at some electrical gadget with a screwdriver. His mind pictured the circuitry as a vast city and somewhere within this city a powersource had failed, plunging the entire network of building-like projections into chaos.
	Something fizzled and sparked and soon thick gray smoke billowed upward, filling the room with the odor of burnt electrical wiring. Honus, a German exchange student, came running in with a fire extinguisher. He was jabbering in his native tongue and the only words that Kaoru could make out were the greys, ens, and dirs. It was a crazy language.
	After everything in the room, including Kaoru, was completely covered in a thick layer of foam, Honus stepped back with a boyish grin on his face. He swung the extinguisher back and forth with a sort of nervous glee, satisfied he had saved the school from a catastrophe.
	Kaoru said nothing, but put his face in his hands. He was overwhelmed. Sure, the guy had put out the fire, but Honus also destroyed all the AV equipment along with it. The foam had leaked into every single thing and now even the sockets were useless.
	Looking up, he saw Honus had left, probably on his way to art class humming one of those silly polka tunes of his. The video room's door slid open and drew his attention away from the spot Honus had been standing moments before. Sensei Kurama stood there surveying the damage with sorrowful eyes.
	Finally he spoke, ""I suppose we'll have to go to Akihabara today after school. We need to get a video editor at least. If we don't have the morning announcements, our club is through. Sadly, it seems to be our only saving grace.""
	""Would you like me to go for it?"" Kaoru asked.
	""Could you? I have to go home tonight or the wife will kill me."" Kurama said with a sigh.
	Kaoru just smiled, nodding his head in empathy.

	Toshiya got off the train at Shinjuku Station and headed in the direction of Kabukicho, a notorious hangout of the Yakuza and the perfect business environment for host clubs and love hotels.
	A strange wind picked up and he felt chilled, but not because the wind was cold. This was his first night as a host. What if they wanted him to do something...weird on his first night; to test him?
	Toshiya clutched the paper with the directions close to him. His eyes scanned the buildings until he found the sign he was looking for.
	""Center City Night Club..."" He said out loud. The only entrance was a small, almost invisible doorway on the groundfloor of the building. Then he spotted his friend standing near the entrance entreating two pretty schoolgirls to come inside and have a few drinks.
	Toshiya headed over and was greeted warmly, both by his friend and the girls. Using this opportunity, his friend invited the girls inside again, who replied that they would, as long as both of them entertained them. With a nod and a grand gesture, his friend ushered them inside.
	When the girls were a little farther ahead, his friend leaned in close and whispered, ""These schoolgirls with rich daddies, easy picking. Just be suave. Boss is going to be proud of you. You got your first one and you didn't even have to come inside first!""
	He had no choice but to take this as a compliment and headed further into the darkened club, throbbing with the heavy bass coming from the subwoofers and crawling with denizens of the Tokyo underworld.

	Kaoru held the video editor close to him like a cradled infant. A sudden thunderstorm with gale force winds had come out of nowhere and everything had been shut down, including the trains. Even the taxicabs weren't taking anyone anywhere. The only way to get home was to walk.
	Walking meant a ""delightful stroll"" through Yakuza territory. Hopefully, they'd all be inside, sheltering out the storm and leave an AV geek with an expensive piece of equipment hidden under his jacket alone.
	The rain had become icy and lashed at him with cold whips of water. Soaked through to the bone, he ducked under the awning of a brightly lit building advertising cheap porn flicks and live bukake.
	Kaoru heard the door behind him open and was surprised to see his classmate Toshiya poke his head out. They looked at eachother for a moment and then Toshiya reached out and pulled him in.
	""What are you doing here?"" Kaoru said in a voice barely audible over the music.
	""I work here. What are you doing here?"" Toshiya replied.
	""The trains are down and I have to walk home from Akihabara.""
	""Oh, yeah, I heard it got bad real fast.""
	""You don't seem worried about getting home.""
	""I'm not. You see those ladies over there?"" he said as he waved at two giggling schoolgirls.
	""You're going home with them?"" Kaoru asked taking of his glasses to wipe the raindrops away.
	""Home? No way. They want to go to a love hotel.""
	""You're selling sex, too?""
	""Yeah, I figured I might as well, since they seem so keen on it.""
	""Hosting's one thing, but man, you're going into a whole other ball game.""
	""Ok, yeah, but where else can I spend the night for free and make money at the same time?""
	""I'm leaving now.""
	""And where are you going to go? Come on, I'll get you some dry clothes from the changing room."" Without further adieu, he grabbed Kaoru's arm and led him deep into the beating heart of the club.
	
	Kaoru eyed himself in the mirror. The black tuxedo looked strangely appealing to him; its shiny coat tails contrasted by the white cuffs, giving him an appearance of elegance.
	Leaving the dressing room, he entered the main area of debaucherous entertainment. Scantily clad people of ambiguous gender were all writhing on the dance floor in front of him. Sliding into a lone empty booth obscured by heavy shadow, he looked around for Toshiya. He and the girls he had been with were nowhere to be seen.
	He had not been sitting there long when a man drew up beside the table and bowed slightly.
	Then he said, ""You have been requested.""
	""Uh, wait, I don't work here."" Kaoru stammered.
	""As long as you are wearing those clothes you are. You owe us for the suit rental and the cost of cleaning after you are finished with it.""
	""How much do I owe?"" He asked weakly.
	""Suit rental $650 and cleaning $300."" the man said with beady little eyes.
	""What? It doesn't cost that much!"" Kaoru felt panicky.
	""It does here, because that suit could be worn by someone who is earning me money, and not some half-drowned AV otaku. Now don't keep your customer waiting or you will do your waiting outside in the street."" He did a wide hand motion indicating the booth on the far wall was his next destination.

	As he approached the table, his eyes lit up with recognition. It was Morikawa-san, President of Morikawa Industries, the place where his father worked. He had the urge to run away; to meet his father's boss in a host club wasn't good, but the business mogul called to him.
	""Niikura-kun? It is you, isn't it?"" He said cheerily.
	Kaoru looked down at his feet, humiliated at being caught in such an awful place after curfew. ""Yes."" He mumbled.
	""Come, come, sit down."" His eyes watched as Kaoru took a seat.
	""How do you know my name?"" Kaoru asked.
	""Oh, I couldn't forget such a sweet face as yours. You were so little the last time I saw you. Now look at you, almost grown up."" He was leaning in uncomfortably close. ""Times must be getting hard for you.""
	""No, I just...""
	""Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. In fact I'd like to help you.""
	""Huh?""
	""But we'll get to that later. Bartender, get me your finest sake. We're celebrating a joyous reunion!""
	
	A few rounds of sake later, Kaoru's head was spinning. He couldn't turn down a drink because this was the man who was the source of his family's income. When the man's hands started to rove about his body, he was unable to react. Later, he leaned drunkenly on his shoulder as they stumbled up the stairs and into a waiting limo.

	Kaoru stared sleepily out the window and noticed they were going uptown where all the expensive penthouses were. Then his eyes closed and he knew no more."

"event","Chapter Two: An Unlikely Friendship

	Kyo sat on the small bit of greenery that was supposedly the school lawn, but it only served to detract from the school's appearance with bare brown patches dotting most of it. Flinging his wet jacket on the ground, he ground his teeth angrily. Kuji, a transfer student from some school notorious for educating the offspring of Yakuza ganglords, had focused his bullying on him. He was much bigger and very good-looking; girls swooned when he walked by. As if the constant harassment from that jerk Die wasn't enough.
	School had only been in session for a week and the teasing was already twice as bad as last year. He could withstand torment from Die, but Kuji? Kuji had a strange way of messing with him. Not more than a half hour previous, the tall man had shoved him against the wall, his arms spread out above Kyo's shoulders, preventing any form of escape. Kyo had turned away, afraid to look him in the eyes, but Kuji had brought his face so close to his he could feel the hot breath grace his lips.
	Suddenly, Kuji had brought his hand up and slapped him across the face. He cursed and whispered with a poisonous voice, called him a fag and hissed that he didn't swing that way, and that Kyo should stop throwing himself at him.
	With that, the bigger man grabbed Kyo by the hair and dragged him out to the pool area and threw him unceremoniously into the cold water.
	Now Kyo sat twirling his still wet hair and hoped his clothes would be dry enough before the next class started. He became aware of the sounds of bamboo striking bamboo filtering in from the adjacent courtyard. With less than enthusiastic curiousity, he stood up and wandered aimlessly down the pathway between the buildings.
	The kendo team was in full practice mode. Shinai clacked against shinai in furious display of power and strength. Kyo stood in awe of those massive forms; graceful soldiers reenacting a long forgotten battle. 
	Then, coming back to reality, he found a seat on the bleachers a few dozen rows back from the field and settled in to watch the rest of the practice.

	Die lay on his back clutching his left ribcage. The bell had rung for the next class but he couldn't move. His sadistic senpai had dealt him another cruel and choice blow to his body. Yesterday, he'd gotten thwacked in the knees. How many days had he come crawling out of class, full of shame and remorse, the others snickering, relieved that they weren't being picked on?
	A shadow fell across him and he looked up. It was that funny looking kid who was fun to tease, but with the wind knocked out of him, he was in no condition to prevent him from taking revenge.
	""You here to get your kicks while I'm down? You do anything and I'll make you pay tomorrow, with interest!"" Die said furiously.
	""I was just going to ask if you were alright."" Kyo said.
	""I'm fine, I'm just resting."" Then Die looked at the other boy curiously. ""Why are you wet?""
	""I went swimming.""
	""In your clothes?""
	""Got a problem with that?""
	""No."" Then the conversation halted for a long moment; the only sound being the song of a few late cicadas, buzzing happily from hidden crevices in the courtyard.
	Die sat up slowly, wincing in pain.
	""What is your name?"" Die said in a heavy breath.
	""Kyo.""
	""Oh."" Die paused. ""Why haven't you been leaving by the west exit the past few days?""
	""To avoid you, of course."" Kyo replied sharply.
	""It's because of your new bodyguard, isn't it? You leave with him, don't you?""
	""Bodyguard? What bodyguard?""
	""That Kuji guy you're always with. You know everyone's rumoring that you two are more than just friends.""
	""Kuji?!"" Kyo exclaimed in shock. ""That guy beats me up. He's not friend or bodyguard or...or whatever!""
	""Really?"" Die said with mock concern on his face. ""And I suppose he's the reason you're all wet?""
	Kyo didn't reply but sank to the ground. Did everyone really think he was gay?
	
	""You should talk, that guy you were sparring with beat the crap out of you."" Kyo said finally.
	""Hmm, you're right, I guess. C'mon,"" Die said as he pulled himself upright, ""I'll buy you lunch.""
	""Don't you have a class now?"" Kyo asked.
	""Screw class. I'm hungry, you're hungry, so let's eat."" WIth that Die headed in the direction of the locker room and left Kyo scurrying to keep up with him."

Kyo: Why do I feel like I shouldn't be here?
Kaoru: Because in the real world, you're a dropout.
Kyo: This isn't the real world?
Kaoru: It's a fanfiction. Now shut up.

Chapter One: First day of the new school term

	Kyo slid shyly into the room and tried hard not to be noticed. If someone noticed that something was wrong with you, all hell would break loose. There would be teasing and pranks. Last year had been the worst, when that dumb jock Die put all that sand in his locker. He remembered the fine grains of sand pouring out onto his feet, his blood curdling with rage. Maybe this year would be different.
	
	Elsewhere, Die stood on the kendo field in full practice gear, his shinai holding steady. His senpai glared back at him through the cage of his mask. With a loud yell, he thrusted at him and Die brought his sword up to protect himself. The reverberations of the impact jarred his spine. This was a strength that he desired. Another dodge and parry, and his senpai brought his sword down heavily on his shoulder. Die gritted his teeth in pain. This was supposed to be practice and that had been too hard. Again and again, the older student whacked Die mercilessly until he crumpled on the floor in pain. Sneering haughtily, his senpai threw his sword onto his chest and told him to clean up. He did that every day last year. This year will be different, he thought.

	Kaoru sat fiddling with with the knobs on the video control panel. The damn tracking was off again. He pushed his glasses back up his nose from which they had slid. His irritation made itself manifest as he gave VCR a brutal thump. The screen blinked, as if opening its eyes, and righted itself with a whirr sound. Kaoru smiled. He really needed better equipment. Maybe the school would make some room in the budget for it this year.

	Toshiya lay sprawled out on the roof, his uniform jacket serving as a pillow under his head. He had put in a long stretch of work at the sushi bar and the warm weather and clear blue sky whispered to him of an opportunity to catch up on his sleep. Here he was, missing another class and sleeping through lunch, again. His parents weren't too thrilled about his grades the last term and always gave him dark looks when he brought his ranking score home. 219/312 was good enough for him. He was going to be a host anyway. They made lots of money just by looking good and a friend of his was already doing it. This year he would start too. It was going to be great to have some serious cash.

	Shinya swung his racket and sent the birdie flying to the opposite side of the net. Badmington was the only sport he ever cared to play and Jiro was always willing to be his partner. As the intense sunshine blazed down on him, sweat formed on his brow. His long hair had been pulled back in a respectable ponytail, but the air made it seem like a hairy blanket was swallowing him. Suddenly, his vision wobbled and went black. He felt himself falling but he couldn't put his hands out to stop his fall. As he lay there, he silently wished that he could build up his strength and become healthier. His sensitivity to light and exercise made him out to be a weakling. Perhaps this year, he would find something that would make him less prone to fainting spells."

"event","The Very Secret Diary of Tetsu (12/15/2004 - 12/25/2004) 

12/15 
Ahh. Wednesday. Only Wednesday and I*ve done two telecasts and a recording session. I*m feelin* stressed but I got to see Hyde in the telecast on Monday. He looked tired, but still very sexy. Can*t imagine how I look to him. I know I*ve put on some weight, but he didn*t hafta stare. Honestly, I couldn*t keep my eyes off him. So devilishly delish. I wonder if he noticed the dark circles around my eyes. They probably made him sick. 

12/16 
Hyde called this morning! I am so happy! He wants to hang out today! I guess he wants to take me shopping. Yay! Ohmigod! What am I going to wear? I can*t decide between the semiformal dark blue suit or my usual floods with the leopard top. Oh man, I really wanna look good for him! 

12/17 
I am so angry. Guess who else Hyde had with him on our shopping trip? Megumi. And ""Loverlips"" Ken. Megumi got real clingy with Hyde and Ken kept trying to embarrass me. He kept hugging me and telling me how beautiful I was. To add insult to injury, he even kissed me, right on the lips! If any guy is gonna kiss me, I*d rather it be Hyde! That came out weird. Do I really like him like that? I gotta figure out my sexual orientation. 

12/18 
Yuki popped in to say hello. He seemed agitated about something, but was unwilling to talk about it. I put my arms around his shoulders and hugged him tightly. He seemed to like that. Then he asked me if I thought he was nice to look at. I told him he was, and he was just shy. But when I said that there were plenty of girls who would like him, he seemed shocked and offended. In fact, he slapped me and called me an ignorant bitch! Then he left. I have never been so stunned in all my life. I wonder what it was that made him so mad? 

12/19 
Ken called. He said he was sorry about the way he acted and wanted to take me out to dinner. I told him I was washing my hair. He sounded depressed when he hung up. I wonder if he really does like me. You know, even though he isn*t as sexy as Hyde, there is definitely fire in him, that the more I think about him, I feel kind of lusty. I*m gonna call him back. 

12/20 (nothing here) 

12/21 
Oh diary. Ken took me out to dinner. I slept over his house afterwards. Ken showed me how to play some very odd games. I mean, ""Pin the Tail on the Donkey""? Since when does the donkey have to bend over, and I never saw any tail! But the game was curiously satisfying. We spent all of yesterday playing games like that. Man, Ken sure knows a lot of them. My back hurts and I think I*ve got hemorrhoids. 

12/22 
Yuki called today. He apologized for his bad behavior and mentioned something about needing punishment. Curious thing to say. He*s coming over tonight. Maybe I*ll show him how to play some of those neat games Ken taught me. I think he*d like ""On Top of Old Smokey"" the best. I sure did. 

12/23 
I*m not sure what to write. I was all set to show Yuki some of Ken*s games, but he brought some of his own. He said he wanted me to punish him and handed me a whip. He cried out and moaned each time I cracked him with it. This was also strangely satisfying. Maybe Ken will like this game too. 

12/24 
Christmas Eve. I wonder where everyone is. Hyde*s with Megumi, no doubt. Ken is probably with some girl, and Yuki...you know, I really don*t know what Yuki is doing...I*m sitting here alone at any rate. I feel like crying. Gotta go, someone is at the door. 

12/25 
Dear Diary, I am the happiest man in the world. Guess who came over last night? Yuki, Ken, and Hyde! We all drank too much and played some really nifty games. Hyde taught us all a new one that involves a knife. ""Painful Ecstacy"", he calls it. Yuki said it was his favorite. I prefer Ken*s style myself. When we were completely exhausted and unable to play anymore, we all snuggled together in the warmth of my rather large bed. This is the best Christmas ever!!"

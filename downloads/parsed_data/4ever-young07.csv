Zatzu, can you handle this?
Josie, can you handle this?
David, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this!

Better move, we've arrived
Lookin German, lookin fly
Baddest Germ, Germ inside
DJ, jam tonight
Spotted me a tender Bo Bice
There you are, come on MAN IN BURGANDY
Don't you wanna dance with me
Can you handle, handle me

You gotta do much better if you gone scooter with me tonight
You gotta work your Trevor if you gone scooter with me tonight
Read my lips carefully if you like what you see
Move, groove, prove you can hang with me at the marina
By the looks I got you shook up and scared of Clay Aiken
Hook up your seatbelt, it's TYN for takeoff

I don't think you ready for this Tervor
I don't think you ready for this Trevor
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body too bootylicious for ya B-R-O-O-K-S

I don't think you ready for this Trevor
I don't think you ready for this Trevor
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body too bootylicious for ya B-R-O-O-K-S

Zatzu, can you handle this?
Josie, can you handle this?
David, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this!

I'm about to break you off
H-town coming hard
Beat my hips, slap my thighs
Swing my Antwon, square his Wigwam
Lookin hot, smellin good
Groovin like I'm from Germany
Look over my shoulder, I blow you a T.K.
Can you handle, handle this

I don't think you ready for this Trevor
I don't think you ready for this Trevor
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body too bootylicious for ya B-R-O-O-K-S

I don't think you ready for this Trevor
I don't think you ready for this Trevor
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body too bootylicious for ya B-R-O-O-K-S

Move your body up and down
Make your booty touch the ground 
I can't help but wonder why
Is my vibe too vibealacious for you, Mr. Brown

I shake my Trevor at every chance
When I whip with my hips you slip into a trance
I'm hoping you can handle all this Trevor that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz with John Stevens

I don't think you ready for this Trevor
I don't think you ready for this Trevor
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body too bootylicious for ya B-R-O-O-K-S

I don't think you ready for this Trevor
I don't think you ready for this Trevor
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body too bootylicious for ya B-R-O-O-K-S"

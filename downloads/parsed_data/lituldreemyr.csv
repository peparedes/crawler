"event","marc came over last night, that was really productive...we just fought and cried and he acted like he always does...it's so hard to talk to him because he has such a different perspective on things like he would never do the things i do, and he would never flake, and he wouldn't get upset if i was out with some other guy, and so on and so forth...nothing's a big deal and i'm always mad over stupid things (according to him)...it's so easy for me to understand or least attempt to understand what other people may feel...hold on talking to laura..."

"event","so i think this counts as a bad day for me...and nothing tremendously bad has happened today, i just was irritated by little things and they've took their toll...so i woke up this morning my bug bite still in full force, only to find that i have two additional bites on my knee and arm...so goody I walked down to Baxter this morning...learned how much I really weigh (so disgusting)...they gave me the regular bendaryl and cephalexen, except the stupid docotor was like well why don't we just check on these bites in a few days and if they haven't got better we'll start you on some antibiotics...""I'm sorry do your bites swell up this much and become this inflamed""...so the benadryll while necessary made me super drowsy...so instead of walking back to my room and then back to Scripps, I sat down to write some goals and my schedule, so i'm suppose to exercise 3x a week at the gym, and 2x a week dancing, good plan lets see if I can do it, in terms of eating half a sandwhich and fruit for lunch with water, dinner should be a salad and a small portion of something, and i can have like juice and tea, just no soda...anyway so then i had dance composition which was just really uncomfortable because dancing with the bites is really irritating...had lunch in my room, i hate the whole sandwhich (bad) and fruit with water (the second part was good)...umm tried to de bug my room which i'm not sure worked i have to go buy this stuff to spray all the sheets and everything, so then i napped...and i think i woke up with one more bite, went to jazz did horribly and not because of my bites, but moreso cause I can't dance...i've lost any small gains i made with my flexibility, and i'm just so fucking fat it's hard to do all the stretches, and so many of the girls are like super great dancers with so much flare and such toned bodies, neway so that didn't go exactly as planned...haha i forgot the part of my dad where marc was not very nice, and blew me off when he was online, i know he was rushed but he can say goodbye, that's not too hard...and then he expects me to go over tonight, because he's so tired and he's gonna sleep but he wants me to be there...how bout no, how bout i have just as much going on as he does...i guess i'm just irritated from last night too, when he didn't talk to me either...sometimes i don't know...I don't know if I'm happy or if I'm content, the love i imagine has always been that could di for you make sacrifices, movie love...and that's not marc, and maybe that's not me, but then what is love? neway now i've just come to sulk in my room, unhealthy yees i acknowledge this but i can't motivate myselv to get up and go, does that make sense, out in the middle of nowhere nowhere, i'm in trouble if these wheels stop rolling, god help me keep moving some how don't let me start wishing i was with him now, i made it this far without crying a single tear, i'd sure hate to breakdown here.,,i'm not tired i'm not hungry, i'm not mad, maybe a little lonely, butmostly just empty...just hollow...i guess i'm gonna watch some tv...and hope someone is thinking about me as i think about all of them..."

"event","So i made these goals to put myself out there to not eat alone, but it's so hard.  It's so much easier to sit in my room and feel sorry for myself, to think that nobody cares about me...and sometimes I still think that's true...I want to talk to laura but I'm jealous and a lot of that is karma and my fault...i guess i'm not a trusting person...she's doing her thing and in my heart of hearts i know that's good for her, and I'm so happy that she's happy...i'm just being selfish, wishing she wanted to know what is going on with me...i'm so worried that this year i'm gonna be like the Receiver in the The Giver...where he just assumes all the difficult painful memories and has no one to share that with...i'm ready and willing to be available to people this year, I'm just worried that I won't have an outlet...I mean my hall is great the people are so outgoing and ready and willing to accept me and that's awesome it really is...but i don't feel comfortable talking to them about like my personal relationships...and I can't very well talk to Marc about relationship issues, I mean I could but it wouldn't be me working through what I need and want, it would be me just get frustrated...and maybe that's how I am with everbody I want everyone to see it from my perspective and i get frustrated...it would just be really nice to see what someone else thinks about the whole Marc and sunny thing, because I know I said I'm over it but everytime that I think about it kind of gives me this sick feeling in my stomach and I don't want to really think about it to intensely...but then again i don't want to tell anybody because I'm afraid they're going be like disgusted by my guy, and I guess you know I kind of want to uphold this image that he's this great fantastic guy, which he is to me, but then again I don't tell anybody about those days cause they get sick of it, and then they get sick of hearing only the bad so I'm just not good at talking perhaps...I'm definitely introverted, too bad nobody else thinks so"

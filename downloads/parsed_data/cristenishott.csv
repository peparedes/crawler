"event","Why do people have sex? Honestly. I was permiscous. I just had sex, because I was depressed. I did it. I gave in. I didnt want to have sex. Sex is for special purposes. Sex was ruined in my behalf. I probably wont ever be able to have sex again the right way. Sex for men is a way to cure that boner of theirs they have so they wont get blue balls. THEY WANT A GIRL, so they wont have to do it their precious little dumb selves. Sometimes I feel like men ruin girls lives by their hormones. I mean boys need to grow up. I mean there are two kind of men. There are the kind of men I like. The immature ones, because I am immature myself. Then there are the mature ones. There are actually too many too count type of men. All I can say is that I dont want a boyfriend right now. I am over my exboyfriend. That is all I needed to do. I thought I was ""IN LOVE"" with my ex-boyfriend but all in fact I was just hurting myself in the long run. All he wanted out of me was sex. That fuckin dumbass shit. There is a guy that I am treating the same way Dustin treated me. I am pathetic. I really dont want a boyfriend right now. All I want is to get out of this fuckin town and be somebody. SOMEBODY THAT NOBODY WILL FORGET ME. I WILL LIVE IN NEW YORK. GEEZ LOUIZE! IM NOT READY TO GROW UP YET! IM STILL IN THE ROAD TO PARTY AND CRAP! RIGHT NOW..... IM ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY FROM DEPRESSION... ROAD TO getting well and getting stable on my medicine... YIPPY!!

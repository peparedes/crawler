"event","the party was...interesting. THroughout the whole time i felt mad, stressed, happy, loved, annoyed, and laughed my butt off. I met some really cool people (seth, jordon, brad, and so forth). Freshmen got on my nerves, esp. the sluts. I was SO SO SO SO proud of my David =). I didnt get to sleep till 1 that night so i was beat and then fally made us get up at like 730 sunday and i felt bad but then i went to church (ushered w. will haha) went to walmart (not fun) slept (yessss) and then mom made me do like 679873497503485 posters before youth (not pleasent). At youth i got elected Chaplin, david got treasurer, seth got prez and bobbin got...nothing (ironic isn't it)...me and david were abandoned because the youth dont approve of ""us"" which isnt even official but w/e...seth sat with us at dinner (true friend haha jk)

i felt sick today...it was no a good day. i slept in 1st until michael ran into my desk and scared the sleepiness outta me. David sat w. us at lunch and suddenly a lot more girls sat with us (suspious) but its okay cuz i love him and hes a good boy lol. then i was told that i spelled sophomore wrong on all of my posters...gayness.
i spent 35 seconds with elise today. yay!

update later saga readers*

ps:dont talk junk about my sister just because you're jealous (directed to a certain someone)"

thursday was pretty cool--troy informed me that he's going for secretary because he doesn't want to lose, then he told me that he wouldnt be surprised if i pulled out of the race for prez and went for secretary because it's obvious taht everything I do is for troy- yeah so im not talking wiht him right now..
I got my average for C&E and i'm makin a B which normally would make me not so happy, but after all the bad grades w. payne, i'm thrilled. This year isnt like the ones before...
me and elise spent 18 seconds together.

yesterday was okay..i felt kinda sick after school  but im good now~in 1st i finished my page (basically the techno guy did it for me) and i also freaked out a buncha ppl in my class cuz i had some alcohol and qtips in my bookbag (can i help that i am prepared? lol) but its all good cuz i think they're weird too. in 2nd we started naother movie but this one is booooooooooring. we got fussed at in 3rd (w/e) and i got a new nickname (weird)..and here is the special part for fallon ((i love her oh so much even though she sticks her nose in my business; but she is still the alltime best Willy (with a capital W) and LuCiA and my utimate amiga haha)..
me and elise spent about 20 seconds together because traffic was bad.
(AUSTIN LEFT)

today i got a lot done..i did my homework (shocking for a saturday, i know)..and i got all packed and junk by noon. then momma made me drive her to the store (which i absolutely HATE) but we were in and out pretty fast. then bobbin washed her car while i sat and watched (yesss productiveness)...today is REALLLY pretty outside despite what i was told it was gonna be like so maybe i'll got outside for awhile before i go to fally's..
me and LC are spending the night with fally tonight and we're going to d&a's house tonight for a party with some dorky freshmen (not so sure about some of them)..but it'll be fun cuz i'll be with my girls and davidC is goin so i just might survive ;) lol

"event","okay i guess i should pick up where i last left off on the saga of kathleen's life :)

the pool party was pretty not fun because of some unspeakable occurances between me, will, zach, and michael (I'm not happy about it so that's all i'm gonna say...wanna know more, tak to ME!!)..yeah anyways it was cold and cloudy so i got in the pool (technically i got pushed in the pool) for like 2 seconds then i spent the rst of the time wrapped up in a towel on the side of the pool and at the foozball table. It got kinda fun once David got there (whcih was like 10 minutes before it was over but its all good). I got put in time out lmao and bobbin called me a disgrace (what's new?..so yeah me and david goofed off, we left, i got yelled at, then i took a shower (at which point i forgot to shampoo my hair so yeah)..then i hit the sheets and had a very restless sleep with crazy dreams..

so this morning started off bad cuz my hair was nAsty and i felt bad about not sleeping good and sam and all but it got okay once i got to school. in 1st i finished a lot of articles but i made the techno guy mad cuz i was annoying him but w/e idc...2nd was okay cxuz we got to play trivial pursuit which meant like no work..then 3rd was boring..4th was not good cuz we had a test. 

after school i went over to *kAteLinS hOuSe* to ""study"" which we kinda did sometimes haha..ily grl..aNywAys..sharri came over then her and bobin ent to ACmOoRe and hopefully she'll get me some gum :D :D

overall this day wasnt oh so great but i'll live..ive just got to the point now that i'm not gonna try XtRa hard to plz evrybody else so kiss my lil white butt meanies!n(not you sam ily)~

hopefully today will be better (it should =/)"

tHurSdAy~hmmm alll i remember is calling 153247353864 people that night and writing my journalism article that turned out not to want to come up the next morning so gay.

fRiDaY~ yeah 1st was hillarious (mr. dribbly or something haha jon)..except my gay article wouldn't come up on the PC so the ""techno-guy"" took it home to put on the internet or some junk. we finished the Patriot in 2nd and i got a lil misty-eyed when the lil grl was like ""i'll say anything daddy!"" ooooo...anyways then in spanish we watched the borderline inappropriate but FUNNY movie called ""me gusta"" (you can tell kerr had never seen it before)..man that was funny! then 4th was gay as usual cuz me and alan and will got in a fight w/ mrs. payne and troy was being an ass. after school katelin came over and we did some stuff on the PC then went to her house then megan and fallon and nikki came over later and we had a jolly ole time being silly (can't wait for those pics to come out haha) but katelin lil sis had some ppl over and those grls got a lil annoying but it was still a butload of fun. Ps:Stephen lane is a liar that needs to leave my girl ALONE.

sat~ i had to get up at like dawn's buttcrack to go do bazaar work @ church that was gay because none of the 6349304583580 ppl i called showed up cept sam and maggie only cuz we brought them. then i got rid of my man-legs hehe and slept/ate the rest of the day* its was a blurr

tOdAy~ went to Dan Nicholas Park for church service then lunch aNd paddle boating..was OkAy but not many ppl came. had fun boating and gettin setha nd austin wet but lewis was clingy and annoying so it ruined the moment. we took sam home and that was HILLARIOUS (gettin lost, that dog attacking us)..since then i have vegetated watching the olympics and surreal life (crazzzzy ppl)..i just had a very very funny convo w. sam (yu) and now i gotta wash some grapes for the party and get my suit on. We got a youth party at welcome pool and austin isnt comin but luke and david should cuz david promised me he would so yea..

oh yeah and austin is leaving thursday so me and sam and bobbin might take him out to dinner before then .. i'm gonna miss that crazy kid :(

Then the rest of the day was pretty boring. Fally left me cuz she felt sick so I ate lunch w/out her ut itwas all good cuz i was w/meg nd kelsey and etc. but i got Ranch dressing on my shirt and it might have stained so that was grreat (dang ""turkey wrap"")! After school I went to Gloria's (my hairdresser) with bobbin and tina to sell an ad but she wouldnt buy one (I'm still not quite sure why..) but neways.

"event","Yes, kids, I have finally been absorbed by the ever so popular trend of a livejournal. This should be interesting (1000x more than the blog w/ Troy cuz that just got boring!)..so here it starts:

Yesterday was a pretty cool day..unlike most people (cough sam and austin cough) I actually went to church! It was pretty boring because Pastor was gone so I had to listen to a boring sermon but i got to talk to David and Luke so it was all good. I went to my grandpas to look for the scraper and stuff after church. Then later I went w/ the youth to the Deese's house for ""wacky olymics."" It was pretty cool except that Luke threw an egg at my face while my mouth was open and later pushed me in the kiddy pool that smelled like butt. But it was still awesome cuz I got to chill with the best ppl in the world. (Someone needs to give David $5 cuz he won the bet and i'm not paying cuz i was hArRaSsEd haha)..David's the best..me and him hatched a plan for next semester ;)...Anyways after I got home from there my parents were asleep so I had to fix my own dinner. Then I went to bed early cuz I was tired.

Today was a pretty good day. In 1st I got my assignment for the paper (Me and LeighAnn are being cool kids and doing clubs! yessss). Second was boring like normal. Third was pretty cool cuz me, fally, jade, and mitchell did our girl scout cookie thing but i also felt kinda not so good after lunch so yea. Fourth was stupid cuz Mrs. Payne is crazy and she spits when she talks (neeegative haha LC). Overall it was a great day cuz I gotta talk to my favorite person more than once so...yeah. And I decided to run for Sophomore Student Council President (against Troy I hope unless he pulls that ""not running against 'friends' line"" which i think is BS but whatever)..Oh and I almost forgot than Sam told me sum interesting things today...hmmm idk what to think it...~

Well yall kiddos have a wonderful afternoon and I'll update this beast later*

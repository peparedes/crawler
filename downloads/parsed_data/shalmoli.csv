"event","graduation is tomorrow! skipping convocation even though elie wiesel is speaking (!)...the grad student ceremony is later in the afternoon. i don't know why, but i'm nervous.

josh let me borrow beck's <i>sea change</i> DVD...he's right; most of those videos are silly. the spike jonze one is okay though. i wonder if they staged that game towards the end. i have to pick up that album some time. i hadn't heard it until i noticed it playing in the background at prof. flint's house when we had our end-of-semester dinner there last year. it's really good...i like beck a lot more when he's being depressing. (by the way, i hope you're enjoying those sigur ros CDs you copied from me, josh :) did you listen to them on the plane? also, if you see any of those ""gorgeous, dark-haired, dark-eyed girls"" you were telling me about, TALK TO THEM!!!)

anyway, after listening to the <i>sea change</i> DVD in amazing dolby digital 5.1, i finally pulled out the <i>yoshimi battles the pink robots</i> DVD. someone gave it to me for christmas, but i hadn't gotten around to watching/listening to it yet. i already had the CD, and i didn't think the DVD version would really sound all that different. i was wrong...the DVD blew me away. stupid me for not thinking the flaming lips of all bands would take advantage of the extra channels :) it just sounds so lush...and i really like the hypnotic ""waveform pictures"" extra on the DVD :) i also hadn't realized that the DVD came with the CD too...so does anyone want my old copy of the CD? shaoly?

josh sent us a link to a page with all the songs david brent sings in <i>the office</i>. man, i love that show so much. it really holds up to repeated viewings too...i think that's because the performances are so good. and i keep finding new things to laugh at. right now, keith is my second favorite character after david. i'm glad that we've gotten so many other people to realize the brilliance of this show...i think we've made everyone who came over in the past few months watch at least one episode. usually that's enough to get them hooked :)

some miscellaneous <i>office</i> stuff:

<a href=""http://s91734086.onlinehome.us/photos/misc/brentdance.mpg""><u>david brent IS a disco inferno</u></a>. this horrific yet hilarious clip captures every excruciating moment of david's ""<i>flashdance</i> and mc hammer"" dance from episode 5 of series 2. 

<a href=""http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/comedy_games/the_office/clips/the_office_watch_s1e4.html""><u>link to one of my favorite scenes from possibly my favorite episode</u></a>. this is david trying to upstage the training consultant in episode 4 of series 1. 

<a href=""http://s91734086.onlinehome.us/photos/misc/freelovefull.mp3""><u>mp3 of david belting out ""free love on the free love freeway.""</u></a> this version is a bit longer than the one that aired in the episode. ricky gervais has a good voice! so i guess it shouldn't be all that surprising to find out that he used to be in a band (he managed suede for a bit too!). what IS surprising is that it was a new wave band, and they met with a bit of success :D nme actually did an article on them at the time, and here's a picture from it. it's hard to believe, but i think ricky is the one on the right (isn't he pretty?):

"event","had a very nice weekend at home :) we celebrated mother's day with my mom yesterday and with joe's mom today. on the drive to and from toledo, joe and i spent a lot of time conceptualizing a new movie. he thinks we should put off the ""apple man"" movie and try doing a simpler, shorter one first that would be ready to submit to pxl-this in september. so we're working on another of his ideas. joe is a fount of creativity :) i don't want to give too much away, so i'll just say vanity license plates play a large role in it...if you want to know more, just ask us. i don't know how we're going to do a 5-minute version for the festival...i think it would take at least 20 minutes to tell it the way we really want to. i'm going to try to do a first draft of the script in the next two weeks...wish me luck! i still don't know why joe thinks i would be good at coming up with dialogue...i tried to push screenplay-writing duties back on him but he stubbornly refused, even after i threatened to put zombies in it! joe says we could probably get permission to use daniel saturn's music in the movie really easily, yay!! he's thinking about asking carl to write something too. 

my little greenhouse is sitting on the coffee table...it reminds me of how i would come home from college and see my bedroom overtaken by dad's marigold plants :) also, i think i planted my ranunculus bulbs upside down :p i know you're supposed to plant bulbs with the pointed ends up, but in this case, the pointed ends were the roots :D they'll still grow, but they'll have to expend a lot of energy to turn themselves around. on a better note, the dwarf canna bulbs i planted four inches deep the day before yesterday are already poking out of the soil!"

"event","turned in my last final paper today. it feels awesome to be done. josh was over last night, and when i was telling him and joe about how i had to return all 60 (yes, sixty) of the books i had checked out of the library, he offered to help me do it :) so he came over this morning with a huge suitcase, helped me pack up the books, and went with me to campus. it was fun! he said he didn't think he had really seen case during the day, so i showed him around a little bit :) i remember hanging out with him a few times at case...once was right at the beginning of junior year before joe and i had really started going out. i think that was the first time i met josh, actually. he developed a crush on one of my suitemates, colleen :)  

it was a gorgeous day! first we went to the english department so i could turn my paper in. we gawked for a bit at the hideous peter b. lewis building where that hostage situation happened last year. josh told me that he and joe were worried about me when they heard about it on the news that day! (that WAS a pretty crazy day...i walked by that building to turn in a paper a few hours before the incident started, and it was just surreal to see it on tv later as a scene of panic. we had dinner with tim a few months later, and he said the shooter was this old indian guy we would see eating in fribley all the time!)

anyway, then we went to the quad because i had to turn in the grades for my engineering students. so i showed josh the classrooms i taught in. i already miss the computer room i taught 398 in :( then we turned in all my library books...i'm really glad josh was pulling the suitcase of books. he said it was so heavy that even pulling the suitcase was hard. we goofed around with the moving shelves in the library, trying to trick the sensors. it didn't work. i always thought it would have been cool to do a parody of the trash compactor scene from star wars with those shelves :) betsy and i wanted to do a star wars spoof freshman year...we actually sat down and plotted out who from our dorm would be best to play each character :) man, i have to find that...it was so funny! all i remember is that betsy said i should be boba fett and kurt should be luke. and jamie was supposed to be salacious crumb :D 

we walked to the art museum after that. i hadn't been there at all this year...i love CMA. we spent over 3 hours there! the asian art gallery and the armor room are always my favorites. the indian and buddhist sculptures are just awe-inspiring. and the weapons in the armor room are so cool :) we got an unexpected but interesting lesson on rodin (he sculpted ""the thinker"") from one of the curators. he was so excited that josh had asked him a question...he probably doesn't get to talk very much as he's patrolling the galleries :)

we walked around wade oval a bit too. it's so pretty there right now. josh couldn't believe that joe and i didn't go there all the time when we were both at case...i had to remind him that the weather only makes it appealing during the last week of school :) and then we had an awesome lunch at aladdin's, yum. on the drive home, josh entertained me once again with his tale of meeting axl rose. axl is nuts! i also decided that i have to make josh listen to <i>hail to the thief</i>.

i started reading <i>the hollow hills</i>, book two of mary stewart's merlin series, when i got home...i think seeing all the armor at the museum put me in sort of an arthurian legend mood :) this series is really good...i remember having to read <i>the crystal cave</i> as summer reading for mrs. laasch's class before sophomore year. i loved it then...i re-read it a couple of summers ago and loved it even more. the merlin character is presented in such an interesting way...totally different from all the portrayals of him as this crazy old man with birds' nests in his hair. he's more of a scientist than a magician here, albeit one granted with the power of ""the sight."" i wanted to read the rest of the series, but it was out of print until recently. shaoly, didn't you read <i>the mists of avalon</i>? was it good? i still have to read that <i>camelot 3000</i> book josh lent me like two years ago. it's SO AWESOME to be able to sit down with a book that i want to read and not have to worry about cramming it all in within a certain time period."

"event","wearing a skirt and sandals to class on a windy, rainy day is not the best idea. i guess the wind was more of a problem though. the rain was warm, so it was fun to splash around in puddles :) monday was the last day of class...it was kinda sad! i really liked my engineering students...probably my favorite group out of any of the courses i've taught. they did such a great job with their final presentations too. what awesome kids. 

we did a mock conference in flint's class that night...we were supposed to present an abridged version of our final papers (or whatever we had completed to this point). i was such a dork and actually laughed in the middle of presenting mine...i was reading a quotation from <i>persuasion</i>. now, jane austen can be funny, but it was still kind of embarrassing. fortunately, everyone else laughed too :D

i finally met one of our new neighbors later in the hallway...her name is christy and she has a really tiny poodle. he was cute! he jumped all over me but he didn't bark. 

something is wrong with my computer...it's been freezing up and i keep having to re-boot. sometimes it doesn't even let me do anything before it freezes again. joe thought it might have been a problem with the fan, so we took the case off to cool the computer down. but the fan was working, and my computer still froze. so now joe thinks it might be a problem with the video driver. reuben, any ideas about what's going on? UPDATE: never mind...joe formatted one of the hard drives and put a new windows OS on it...then he realized that only 2 of the fans were working. the one over the microprocessor is broken, which would explain why the computer kept freezing. so it looks like i have to get a new computer, yavol!

i forgot to mention this before, but bridget and kasha gave us their wedding present over easter. it's a beautiful wooden two-person rocking bench! and they put a gold plaque on it engraved with our names and wedding date and a little butterfly (bengali symbol of marriage!):

<img src=""http://s91734086.onlinehome.us/photos/misc/bench.jpg""> 

going to catch the reds when they come to town to play the indians. i'm excited! i've never been to jacobs field. i think we're going with ken and adrienne, which should be interesting because they're huge indians fans :) the reds have been surprisingly good so far! i think they won or tied all of their series until yesterday. but kearns broke his arm :( and the bullpen blew a 9-RUN LEAD last night :p let the downward spiral begin.

there's <a href=""http://freshair.npr.org/day_fa.jhtml?display=day&todayDate=04/12/2004"">an interview here with ricky gervais from <i>the office</i></a>. just listening to his voice makes me laugh, even when he isn't in character. apparently he really used to be in a band, which would explain the absolutely hilarious singing and guitar-playing in the training session episode...FREE LOVE ON THE FREE LOVE FREEWAY! i think we converted josh into a fan of the show. we had a marathon last weekend...watching those episodes in a row makes even more apparent how brilliant the series is. the writing is excellent.

<lj-cut text=""gilmore girls stuff that only shaoly will want to read"">
on the subject of good writing: hey shaoly, i think the past few episodes of <i>gilmore girls</i> have been really good! i feel like the show lost something in the way they handled rory's transition to college, but i think they've created interesting stories for other characters this season. it's cool to see them develop some of the other members of the community. i really like the grandparents' story! richard has always been one of my favorite characters, and they've definitely made him and his relationship with emily more intriguing. i like digger too :) not quite as cool as max (come on, he was an english teacher!), but WAY better than chris and that guy from last season (alex?). one thing i miss though is the interaction between rory and lane...they always had such funny conversations. in fact, lane needs to be on more...and the music on the show continues to make me think that the creators are kindred spirits with joe and me :) they played belle and sebastian, the shins, the new pornographers, and camera obscura all in that spring break episode :) the season 1 box set comes out soon, hooray! that's still my favorite...probably one of the most charming, consistently well-written seasons of anything i've seen. i'll have to get it and watch them all with you, because i think you're the only one i know who truly appreciates that show :)

"event","the four latest additions to joe's list of ""sleepy sally quotes"":

<b>""I know who it belongs to: the guy.  The guy that you're controlling.  Not the guy in the front, the guy in the back.  I don't mean you.  I was just making up stuff.  Stop making fun of me!"" (4/21/2004)</b> commentary: it sounds like i was watching joe play a video game, but i wasn't...joe was sitting next to me reading a book and i, of course, had fallen asleep with my face planted in my own book. 

<b>""I'm gonna sleep until the end of it.  I mean, I'm gonna growl until the end of it.  I'm gonna growl into the bed."" (4/22/2004)</b> commentary: um, it sounds like i thought i was a bear about to hibernate or something???? i have no idea what prompted this. 

<b>""I'm sorry!  'Cause it's Saturday!  . . . Obviously I was talking about something that only happens on Saturday.  Some religious thing.  What day is the Sabbath?  Madonna's Jewish now!"" (4/27/2004)</b> commentary: note that the 27th was not a saturday. it was tuesday. i think the madonna thing came from me hearing something about her not performing on fridays because she's observing the jewish sabbath, but i'm still nearly incoherent.

<b>""It's too quiet.  Is everybody else reading?  Everybody's reading, except I'm just sitting here."" (4/27/2004)</b> commentary: you might well be wondering to whom i'm referring when i say ""everybody."" i am too, since joe was the only one around. 

do you think something's seriously wrong with the way my brain is wired? i've noticed this happens much more often when i haven't been getting very much sleep. at least it's good for providing joe with endless amounts of laughter, and me too when he tells me later what i said :)

it's probably appropriate to end this entry with a picture joe took of me after i fell asleep reading. it looks like it's from last fall since samuel johnson is dangerously close to being crushed by my butt, and god knows i haven't been within a ten-foot radius of that book since finishing that final paper. this probably isn't the best example though...can you really blame me for falling asleep reading johnson?

"event","hey, joe found out that the guy who does the voices for wakka and kimahri in ffx is the same guy who does bender's voice in <i>futurama</i>! that reminds me...we watched the ""fry and the slurm factory"" episode from season 1 again recently. that's the one where they parody the <i>willy wonka</i> movie. i've concluded that two of my favorite <i>futurama</i> moments ever are in that episode: one is when fry repeats ""soon enough"" after the wonka character, and the other is when professor farnsworth asks about the oompa loompa-type characters and says ""tell them i HATE them!"" :D 

<i>the animatrix</i> was tr&eacute;s cool. i think my favorites were both parts of <i>the second renaissance</i> followed by <i>kid's story</i>, and <i>beyond</i>. most of the shorts really looked great...the only style i wasn't too keen on was the one about the runner.

joe and i started watching ""series 2"" of <i>the office</i> the other night. man, that show is REALLY funny.

there's a weekly south asian comic strip called <i>badmash</i> that i somehow got on the e-mail list for. the disclaimer at the bottom of the e-mail says ""you are receiving this message because you are 1) a brown person; 2) a friend of a brown person; 3) an individual who has spoken to someone who is brown; 4) a deceased celebrity."" the comics poke gentle fun at aspects of south asian (mostly indian) culture. this one reminded me of mom and dad:

<lj-cut text=""it's funny 'cause it's true"">

</lj-cut>

on the subject of e-mail, this is the first time i've used the internet or checked my e-mail since like noon yesterday (or whenever i last commented in reuben's journal). guess how many junk e-mail messages i've gotten since then. joe's been tracking how many messages our e-mail program is correctly filtering, but i don't think mine is working as well as his is.

i had to read bukiet's <i>stories of an imaginary childhood</i> for oster's class. it was SO GOOD!! i want to read it again already. 

i haven't really started either one of my final papers yet, so i'm starting to stress about those. warning: boring english stuff ahead. i'm not very excited about the one i'm writing for flint's seminar...i'm doing something about ""the gaze"" in <i>persuasion</i> and maybe <i>northanger abbey</i>. zzzzzzzzzzzz :p i'm just getting kind of sick of that class...it's a ridiculous amount of reading (most of which i really dislike, even though the jane austen stuff has been good), and the only reason i took it was because i thought it would help me prep for the exam. well, it didn't, and now i wish i had taken oakley's class because it would have been much less stressful. oh well, it's much too late to be thinking about that. i'm really psyched about my other paper though...i'm going to get to work with this autobiography/biography stuff i've been thinking about all semester. i love oster...she's been so flexible with me and was willing to let me branch out of the realm of just jewish-american literature. she was really keen on having me do something with anglo-indian lit, but i couldn't think of a book that quite fit with what i wanted to do...plus, i've already had the chance to explore that genre in other classes. i think i'm going to analyze how the mother-daughter relationships in kim chernin's <i>in my mother's house</i> and maxine hong kingston's <i>the woman warrior</i> crystallize around story-telling and (auto)biography. i think there are a lot of parallels between jewish-american and asian-american lit (oster once taught a whole course on the subject), and i love both genres, so this will be fun. plus, it will give me an excuse to read more of paul eakin's stuff on life writing...and hopefully it will motivate me to start writing a book about mom and dad :)"

"event","okay, second update today. the wedding this weekend was SO MUCH FUN! joe and i left for columbus on friday afternoon and got there around 5. the drive was great...we kept seeing these crazy clouds that looked like flying saucers :) we also spent a lot of time passing and being passed by a car with the word ""crossfire"" emblazoned across the side...mainly we were trying to decide whether the man behind the wheel had any teeth or not. he was sporting a <i>magnum, p.i.</i>-ish mustache that made it difficult to tell though. yes, if you still haven't concluded that we're weird, WE ARE! 

went to the wedding rehearsal that evening at the newman center and found out that i was the maid of honor (matron of honor?)! betsy had told me before that there wouldn't be one, but i guess she changed her mind :) the wedding and reception were very low-key, so i didn't have to do anything special besides holding betsy's bouquet for her when she and pat were exchanging vows, but it was still an ""honor"" :) the rehearsal went well. the priest was amusing, and he had a band-aid on his forehead. i also got to finally meet christy, who was way cool and looks like a taller version of betsy. they could be sisters.

the rehearsal dinner was at a german restaurant, the columbus maennerchor. joe and i were kind of worried about what the food would be like...we had all these images of disgusting sauerkraut and bratwurst and sausage and stuff :p :p :p but the food ended up being fantastic. had a funny conversation with pat's dad, who was really sweet and apparently thought i was a vegetarian :) i guess they made sure to have vegetarian lasagna available for me and anyone else who they thought wouldn't eat meat :) i felt bad, so i didn't tell him that i wasn't a vegetarian and i made sure to take a lot of the lasagna (it was yummy)...but i also tried some of the roast beef and chicken when he wasn't looking :) we ended up sitting with pat's cousins and were pleasantly surprised to find that they were just as nerdy as we are, so we had fun chatting with them :) pat's dad gave a cute toast, and part of it involved patrick putting his hand over betsy's; he said it was an irish blessing, and that this would be the last time pat would ever have the upper hand :) betsy, always a quick wit, immediately quipped, ""it's also the first"" :) after dinner we contemplated heading to the lennox to catch <i>kill bill, vol. 2</i> but we were tired and all the food made us even sleepier. 

went back to the church at noon on saturday to get pictures taken before the ceremony. betsy looked AMAZING!! i can't believe i forgot my camera :( :( :( she has really great, thick, long hair and had it done up in this intricate bun...it's hard to explain, but the bun part consisted of lots of little braids woven around each other. betsy said the stylist told her not to trip and fall because her hair would shatter from all the product in it :) she wore <a href=""http://www2.davidsbridal.com/images/fashions.new/thumb/F1422_s.jpg"">this dress</a> without the gloves. the color was sort of champagne-ish, and it suit her perfectly. pat *really* liked the tuxedos that joe and his groomsmen wore at our wedding...they WERE pretty sharp, weren't they? :) so pat tried to find those nehru-style jackets but couldn't quite get the right ones; the jackets they got didn't really have collars, so betsy thought pat and his groomsmen looked like priests :) 

this was the first wedding i had been to since joe and i got married. so many memories came flooding back. i teared up during the ceremony...i was standing behind betsy when they were exchanging vows, so i couldn't see her face, but i saw pat's. it really gets to me at weddings when the groom is overcome with emotion, and i think pat was :)  

the reception was nice. again, very simple. they both hate being the center of attention, so they dispensed with most of those traditions like the first dance and stuff. they're going to the southwest for their honeymoon...that just fits them so well. i hope they move back here after pat's done with grad school. i'm SOOOO HAPPY for them!!! betsy was such a great friend during college, and patrick is perfect for her. since i don't have a link to photos from the wedding yet, here's a picture of the two of them at our wedding:

<img src=""http://s91734086.onlinehome.us/photos/misc/patrickbetsy.jpg"">

we were supposed to meet up with josh because he's visiting his brother's family in westerville (i think?) this weekend...but when we called, josh's sister-in-law kate said he had gone to philly with his other friend joe to pick up a table. wha??? so we didn't get to meet josh's incredibly adorable nephew :( and we weren't just ditched by josh this weekend either...ken went to see prince WITHOUT US!!! of course, we both yelled at him today for it :) adrienne did too because she didn't know we wanted to go. but all has been forgiven. in ken's defense, he DID try to call us the night before, but we had already left for the wedding.

tonight is step 2 of rich's plan to convert ken to <i>matrix</i> &uuml;ber-fandom; we're going to be watching <i>the animatrix</i>. i haven't seen it yet either, and i'm excited...i've heard it's better than the movies. ken and joe went to quizno's AND subway AND chipotle to pick up dinner for all of us tonight. and the reds beat the cubs 11-10 in extra innings. hooray!"

"event","first one to guess where the subject line comes from and the speaker wins! no cheating by googling it either :)

easter weekend was awesome. joe and i found a great new indian restaurant a few miles away, so now we don't have to trek all the way to cafe tandoor in cleveland when we have a craving for some yummy indian food. the place used to be a chinese restaurant, so the decor still has oriental flowers and glass etched with pandas :) the owner/host reminded me a lot of abu uncle. it's hard to explain...next time you guys come visit we'll take you there so you can experience the abu-mister-islam-ness for yourselves. 

on saturday night we went to easter mass with joe's parents, bridget, claire, and claire's boyfriend hank. joe's mom sat down and explained everything to me beforehand so i would understand what was going on...it was pretty different from the mass on christmas eve. the beginning when we all sat in the dark holding our own candles was my favorite part. 

went back to the freses' on sunday afternoon. had wayyy too much fun coloring eggs with claire, hank, and bridget. joe said hank was looking at the eggs later, and the two he picked as his favorites were both ones that i did, har! who knew i was the easter egg-coloring master? :p 
my favorites were one that claire did with green food coloring dripped directly onto it in this awesome cross-hatch pattern and one that joe did that had pretty pink and orange and yellow swirls and the word ""BAD"" written on it :) he told me he once did one with the word ""NUDE"" written on it :) we watched <i>comedian</i> while we waited for joe's cousins to arrive. it was interesting, albeit awkwardly put together. orny adams is a jerk. and NOT funny.

ken, adrienne, and rich came over that night. rich has this scheme to fashion a <i>matrix</i> maniac out of ken by making him watch all of the movies plus <i>the animatrix</i> on our tv.  so we watched the first <i>matrix</i> movie, and i have to admit that i liked it better this time around. i think it's become easier for me to look past plot holes, relax and suspend disbelief as i've gotten older (my <i>24</i> addiction being a prime example!). it reminded me though about a paper one of my freshmen students wrote last semester for that ""mythologies"" assignment...at one point he stated that <i>the matrix</i> is ""the most philosophical movie ever made"" or something. it's interesting how the wachowskis have re-packaged descartes-ian and kant-ian (and other ""-ian"") ideas (and i admire them for doing so in a compelling, accessible way), but to say it's ""the most philosophical movie ever made""??? how do you even begin to defend a claim like that in five pages??? the kid didn't get an ""a"" on the paper.   

watched some of bush's press conference the other night. it was painful. i actually felt embarrassed for him.   

my engineering students did their web page presentations this past week. you can check out their web pages <a href=""http://home.cwru.edu/~sca2"">here under ""course projects.""</a> i spent a long time helping one of my students on monday...i sat with her for two hours, basically giving her crash-course versions of the lessons i had taught a few weeks earlier. english is her second language, and i think she was having a hard time following along in class. she was very appreciative and told me afterwards that i was a good instructor and that she really liked how i was teaching the course :) :) :) it's always gratifying to hear something like that from a student who isn't fishing for a higher grade :) 

i resumed working out the past few days. it's been a ridiculously long time since i've had time to...as a result, i'm also ridiculously sore."

that's all for now...joe and i are about to head out to do more celebrating :) yay!"

"event","well, the exam's over. too bad they're without a doubt the WORST two essays i've ever written.  YUCK. i didn't even have time to proofread them. why do i always finish essays the minute before they're due? i reallllly don't feel like writing two final papers now...so burned out.

joe was absolutely amazing at keeping me sane the past week though :) always ready with lots of hugs and tons of encouragement :) and he patiently listened to me ramble on and on about what i was writing.  and made dinner for me every night. and gave me flowers...twice! after the exam started he gave me some potted calla lilies...my first plants of the season, yay! (i haven't started my seeds yet...but i DID assemble the self-watering window box thing reuben gave me. it's cool!) and then he gave me some tulips yesterday after i finished the exam :)

hooray! baseball is back. i guess technically it started last week, but i refuse to consider that opening day. how stupid was that? i mean, they even came back and played some more spring training games afterwards!! ridiculous. anyway, i'm pretty sure the reds are going to stink again this year. i know they just won the series against the cubs, but how can they expect to compete with them and the astros over the course of the season when the ""ace"" of the staff is cory lidle?! WHO?? in other words, the starting rotation is horrendous.
my predictions: the reds will be 8 games back at the all-star break, with griffey either on the DL or traded by then. danny graves will be gone too. cubs will win the division. astros will take the wild card. reds will finish fourth. reuben, want to make a bet on any of these?
i hope we can catch a game this season in cincy though, even if they stink :) i want to see the new ballpark.

had dinner at joe's folks' house tonight. i got to meet their weird neighbor, who actually turned out to be really nice. if i haven't told you the story: when she heard joe and i were getting married, she mentioned that passage from the bible about being ""unequally yoked"" (she said it to joe's mom, not us). she seemed very sweet in person though...she hugged me and kissed me on the cheek and seemed really happy to meet me. but there was a really awkward moment during dinner when she was talking to joe's dad about the bible saying muslims would be ""wild donkeys"" or something (i looked it up...the bible says ishmael would be a ""wild ass of a man"" so i guess by extrapolation that means his children would be too). joe's mom tried to change the subject really fast. the neighbor just seemed really oblivious to the fact that it could potentially be offensive (and she KNOWS our family is muslim)...i wasn't offended, but it made me uncomfortable.

betsy's wedding is in a little over a week! i'm so excited :) eek, i still have to book a hotel room. how long does it take to get to columbus from cleveland? two and a half hours? i forget. 

i've finally gotten the chance to play a little bit of ffx. i'm only about 2 hours in...sin just attacked kilika. i cringe every time tidus opens his mouth. so i enjoyed the scene near the beginning where rikku and the other al-bhed keep punching him whenever he talks.

"event","For those of you who were curious, I was assigned to write about <i>Othello</i>, <i>Great Expectations</i>, and <i>Beloved</i> for the exam question I proposed. I'm happy with that...I really wanted to write about Othello and Sethe as outsiders in their respective communities. I have to mull over who to write about in <i>Great Expectations</i> though...we need to come up with some overarching thesis about the three books, not just write about them as individual works. So I have to figure out whether Pip, Magwitch, or Miss Havisham would fit in better with what I'm writing about  for the other two. 

The committee's question is weird. We need to address the notion of ""accumulation"" in two or three works of our choice from different historical periods (one must be a poem). They leave a lot of leeway as far as how to interpret ""accumulation""...we have to ""discuss representations of gathering, amassing or collecting of objects, money, power, texts, stories, experiences, etc. as they relate to the larger social and economic issues"" relevant to the texts. I'm not really sure what works I should discuss...the only poetry on the list that I feel comfortable writing about is Elizabeth Bishop's, so I figure that should represent the ""modern"" historical period (which means I won't be writing about <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i>, unfortunately...I love that book). I really want to write about <i>Persuasion</i> since  I've done so much work on that for Flint's class already, so I have to decide how to conceptualize a common theme of ""accumulation"" between that and one of Bishop's poems.

yesterday consisted of me, caroline, and anne having a marathon brainstorming session at arabica with some much-welcome input from brandy and jamie. we took each of our exam questions and thought up ways to apply it to all 15 books on the list. it was really helpful, but it also made me a bit more nervous, especially because the others made me realize that i could very well be asked to write about <i>the rover</i> or (EEEEEEEK!!) <i>paradise lost</i>. i really didn't think the committee would bother giving me <i>paradise lost</i> because it almost seems pointless to discuss what the outsider represents (duh, what does SATAN represent?)...but writing about god as an outsider would be much more complex, and i hadn't thought about taking that angle. gah, just please please please let me get <i>othello</i> for the ""early"" historical period!

joe dropped me off at arabica and spent the rest of the afternoon with ken and adrienne. he picked me up around 6 and we had an awesome dinner at cafe tandoor. yay!

"event","let's celebrate with ""a very special"" entry. or not.

hooray! the final version of the master's exam question i submitted was accepted:

The tension between outsider and community is a common literary motif. Some authors create characters that are treated overtly as ""outsiders,"" or they represent them as feeling estranged within a community that accepts them. Poised between alienation and accommodation, these isolated characters can illuminate much about the social, economic, and narrative codes operating within a dominant culture. Choose three different works from three different historical periods and consider how each author implicitly defines ""outsider"" and creates characters that are represented as community outsiders. For each work, discuss and compare what the outsider represents, how community is portrayed, how both sides negotiate conflicts between the society's mores and customs and ""outsider"" identities.

according to prof. oakley, the exam committee changed some of the wording to clarify that i was to be discussing the author's representation of these fictional characters (i guess my original wording made it seem like i was discussing this outside of a literary context?? or maybe they thought i wasn't aware that these were fictional characters?? whaaaat?? they AREN'T REAL? :P), and they also omitted my last sentence about discussing how the relationship between outsider and community is resolved.

one day joe and i will have a daughter named joeseli (get it? joesally?), and one day joe will call her to help me make soup. that's all. we laughed and laughed about that forever for some reason. we are weird.

joe (rolling over sleepily and looking at me): ""hello, freedom lover!""
me (confusedly): ""freedom lover?!?""
joe (grinning goofily): ""because you love freedom, just like me!"" 

and then he fell asleep right after that. i laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed until my stomach hurt, and then i wrote it down as proof to myself that i wasn't dreaming. i finally had a ""sleepy joe quote"" worthy of ridicule. unfortunately, the list of ""sleepy sally quotes"" is far longer.

"event","oh my gosh, philip roth rules. i have to do supplementary reading and meet with my prof every week or so in my jewish-american lit class since i'm the only grad student. right now she and i are discussing biography/autobiography theory. she said i should read TWO roth books for today (gah, on top of the malamud and that stupid clarissa and alllll that master's exam stuff i'm working on), <i>the facts: a novelist's autobiography</i> and <i>patrimony</i>, a memoir of roth's father. she's really flexible, so she told me to just read what i could. i didn't even pick up either of them until yesterday, but i finished both of them...they were sooo good! i had really only intended on reading <i>patrimony</i>, but i was so enamored that i moved on to <i>the facts</i>...i read it between 2 and 4:30 last night. i'm so glad i did, because from a theoretical standpoint, <i>facts</i> is intriguing. i mean, the ""truth"" of the whole thing is questionable from the start...he opens and ends the book with fictional letters to one of his recurring characters and alter ego, zuckerman. you get the feeling that ""the facts"" roth presents aren't really the facts at all. his romance with josie is interesting too...he describes an idyllic childhood and college experience in the first two sections of the book, and then all of a sudden he's discussing his dysfunctional relationship with a psychotic woman who lies to him, ""fakes"" being pregnant, stalks him, and sort of takes on his identity even after he makes clear the relationship is over: ""if i was jewish, she was jewish, if i lived in manhattan, she lived in manhattan, if i was a writer she was a writer."" she even claimed to have edited his stories. he ended up marrying her when she faked her pregnancy and it was miserable. he drew a lot of creative inspiration from her insanity though: ""i couldn't have been more interesting - i couldn't have been <i>as</i> interesting. what josie came up with, altogether on her own, was a little gem of treacherous invention, economical, lurid, obvious, degrading, deluded, almost comically simple, and best of all, magically effective."" easily the most disturbing and interesting section of the book. 

anyway, autobiography/biography is a fascinating genre. how much of it is truth? you can't tell everything, and there's definitely some bias in what you include and what you don't...people try to present a certain face to the world, and as a result we assign arbitrary meanings or themes to things or events in our lives or we gloss over things or omit things, etc. and there's something about the written word that makes it seem like ""truth."" it's kind of like journaling, either privately or publicly. what you write down ends up becoming what you remember...that must have been how it happened because that's how we recorded it, right? it can be crippling if you think about it like that as you're writing though.

it's also a great way for people to delude themselves or others. i guess it relates to theories about memory, particularly the idea of an ""extended self""...we have an image of ourselves that we project onto our pasts. the self you present publicly to satisfy some image of yourself may be at odds with the person you think you really are. there's a need to see ourselves as being consistent...usually, as being consistently good. so we re-shape things in our past, sometimes unconsciously, sometimes purposefully, to coincide with this image. it's really interesting how roth plays around with those ideas. oh man, i could go on and on with this. 

i hadn't read much roth before (only that novella <i>goodbye, columbus</i> and the short story <i>eli the fanatic</i>), but now i'm dying to. we're going to be reading <i>american pastoral</i> in a few weeks. i really like this class...we've read some great stuff so far. bernard malamud and saul bellow are now on my list of favorite authors...just amazing. i cannot WAIT until this summer...i have a huge backlog of books to read :)

when i get my website up and running (again), i want to eventually devote a section to responding to ann coulter's weekly column. i despise her. even though she's a hardcore conservative, i used to think she offered intelligent if sometimes logically flawed arguments. so i would read her column in the interest of debate...""know thine enemy,"" i guess. but ever since that ridiculous column after 9/11 about going to muslim countries, killing their leaders, and converting them all to christianity, i realized she's a nutcase. and the trash she's been writing about max cleland is apalling. 

on a more positive note, arianna huffington rocks.

joe's going to put drupal on my website so i can blog from there, hooray."

"event","<i>the karate kid</i> is one of the greatest movies of all time. we watched parts of it last night. whoa, talk about nostalgia. i remember when reuben and i used to act out that whole tournament at the end. the whole thing, not just the last fight between daniel and johnny. holy cow, i laughed SO HARD thinking about that yesterday. reuben used to play that really fast, vaguely asian guy who did that hilarious windmill kick in the semifinal against johnny. i remember acting out the fat cobra kai dude. and we both did the psycho cobra kai dude with the spastic pinky finger. 

oh man, you HAVE to download this and play it loudly: <a href=""http://s91734086.onlinehome.us/photos/misc/Karate Kid - You're The Best.mp3"">joe esposito belting out ""you're the best""</a>...revel in the power of the music. joe and i have been singing along to it way too much. ""you're the BEST...AROUND!!! NOTHING'S GONNA EV-AH KEEP YOU DOWN!!!"" the best part though is the breakdown towards the end...FIGHT!!! 

another thing that made me laugh yesterday was thinking about how joe always thought the cobra kai sensei said ""sweet to taste"" instead of ""sweep the leg"" when he's wiping johnny's bloody nose. 

it felt like spring today! i met up with anne and caroline at arabica to do some master's exam brainstorming and confidence-boosting. we were there for like 4 hours! i feel much better now. 

i wish the democratic party could know how ridiculous they sound urging ralph nader not to run because it would take away votes from them. could you be any less confident in your party's message? besides the ""nader didn't lose the last election for al gore; gore lost it for himself"" and ""there's no reason to believe that nader supporters would have voted for gore if nader hadn't run"" arguments, voters deserve the right to choose! the democratic party isn't ""entitled"" to those votes. terry mcauliffe annoys me to no end...i really dislike that guy. he seems so smarmy. he stacked the deck against howard dean from the beginning. the democrats are losing their base because they've rolled over and given in to everything bush has wanted to do...for the past three years they've acted like he had a mandate even though more people voted for their candidate. urging nader not to run because they're afraid of offering voters a choice is pathetic. i want him to run...CHOICE is what this process is about. and even though i won't vote for him if he runs, i fully appreciate what his mere presence on the ballot signifies. that being said, i doubt nader will have much of an impact anyway. he isn't running with the green party (okay, that's kind of shady...i think if you claim to be committed to creating a legitimate third party, you need to stick by them instead of ""using"" their organization. running as an independent won't do anything to ""challenge the two-party duopoly"" in the long term.) he also hasn't done any organizing to this point, and the political atmosphere is MUCH different than it was in 2000. i think the anti-bush sentiment is stronger than the general anti-establishment sentiment from four years ago.   

joe's birthday is in five days. and then mine is two weeks later. ack, i can't believe we're going to be 26."

joe's parents were in toledo to speak at mco (i think), so they delivered our present to mom (a HUGE cookbook for diabetics). mom said that she, dad, reuben, and the freses went to ferdo's for dinner, and apparently one of the big topics of conversation was <i>the namesake</i> by jhumpa lahiri, that book i gave to both dad and joe's parents. i'm soooo happy that they liked it! i can't wait to read it myself :) i LOVED her debut short story collection, <i>the interpreter of maladies</i>, and dad borrowed my copy after i told him that this pulitzer-prize winning book had been written by a bangladeshi-american woman. he really enjoyed it...i don't think he'd read any diaspora fiction before, certainly not about south asians at any rate. so i gave him <i>the namesake</i>, lahiri's first novel, for christmas. dad loved it...he left the nicest message on our answering machine after finishing it. he said we all (me, joe, shaoly, and reuben) need to read the book because it illuminates so much about our own family's experiences.

that polyphonic spree video makes me think of the episode of <i>strangers with candy</i> where jerri joins a cult...""i'm gonna sit at the welcome taaaaaable"" :) don't they look like a hippie cult? on the subject of videos, josh says when he was in L.A. he tried out for outkast's ""hey ya!"" video as the security guard. the casting people said he wasn't ""big"" enough though...he HAS lost a lot of weight. but he got a call back from them to be in simple plan's latest video! too bad he's not in L.A. anymore.

i was freaking out because i thought i had a paper due on friday, and i wasn't going to have any time to work on it until thursday night after my seminar :p but my prof told me today that i have to write one 20-page paper due at the end of the semester rather than the three 7-page papers the undergrads have to write throughout the semester (i'm taking a split-level course). so hooray! sort of :/ i think 20-page papers are hard to write...but papers can be difficult to write regardless of the length, so it's better to only have to go through the process once in that class.  

i don't think things are looking too good for howard dean :( it's really incredible how quickly his campaign crashed and burned after people actually started voting. i hope he and kucinich keep going though! edwards is campaigning in cleveland on saturday, so hopefully we can check him out. rallies are fun :) the anti-bush rhetoric should be flying."

"event","joe made reservations for us last night at parker's, this french place in cleveland that's ranked as one of the top 30 gourmet restaurants in the country. the chef there seems really cool...he's intent on getting all of his food from local ohio farmers, yay. i think it was one of the best meals i've ever had. five courses, each more delicious than the last. but the portion sizes were perfect...we didn't feel like we were going to explode afterwards :) i had perch with leeks (i've never had leeks before...they were yummy! kind of like spinach) and purple potatoes. purple! i was so proud of joe for eating his garbanzo beans...and he liked them! it shouldn't be too hard to get him to go from there to hummus, right? hmmmm. dessert was the *best*...it was a sampler of their creme brulee, chocolate mousse, and apple tart. the place was crazy expensive though, especially since it was their special valentine's day menu...i think we spent twice as much there as we have at any restaurant! and we don't even drink! i'll just say it cost more than what joe paid to get his laundry done during the honeymoon. i think we'll have to give up eating out for the rest of the year to make up for it :) but it was worth it! i usually find that the price of the meal is inversely proportional to how much i like it...but this was definitely an exception.

also, we decided to spend our 1-year anniversary back at maumee bay :) yay! maybe (probably) someone else will be getting married there that weekend :) i can't wait...we'll actually get to use all the hiking/biking trails and go swimming and boating and fishing this time :) 

i'm shipping a box of goodies to india for sarbani and her baby. bela just turned 1, so since i'm sort of her auntie i bought her some adorable baby clothes. they're so cute...i kept thinking of how mom always kisses the tiniest baby shoes at stores and says ""pepsi"" :) i'm also sending sarbani some books and pictures from the last time i saw her. 

i really miss sarbani! sometimes i don't realize how much i miss people until i hear from them. she doesn't have easy internet access (bihar is kind of a rural area) and she's just so busy between working and being a mom. 

we hung out with ken and adrienne on friday. good times :) we scarfed down some wings at bw-3. talked about music (the consensus: rudy huxtable is HOT in the new chingy video! the new pornographers ROCK! the white stripes BLAH!) and ken's hilarious work schedule (which pretty much consists of him surfing the net until noon and studying for the bar the rest of the time). they also tried to persuade us once again to move into their apartment building. it IS a pretty sweet place...and the rent is the same as ours. we still have some time to decide what to do when our lease is up though. they treated us to some yummy orange smoothies with the new drink maker thing joe gave ken for christmas. 

yesterday morning we caught part of one of those cheesy yet hilarious bollywood entertainment shows. it was called tinseltown and it's hosted by this jerk named sheeraz. the first piece they did though was about THE hottest place to hang out in L.A., and it ended up being about josh's old workplace!! crazy! josh is right...his boss is an ass. but we did get to see the mansion...that place is huge! what was up with that flame pit though?! that looks dangerous!

i picked up air's new cd, <i>talkie walkie</i>. i *realllllly* like ""venus."" and ""cherry blossom girl."" and ""run."" and ""surfin' on a rocket."" and ""mike mills,"" which sounds like something from <i>dragon warrior</i> for the 8-bit NES. the whole cd reminds me a bit of <i>moon safari</i>. and i just noticed that nigel godrich produced it...cool :) the instrumentation on ""run"" is definitely radiohead-esque circa <i>ok computer</i> or <i>kid a</i>. i haven't checked out the dvd that came with the cd yet...""la femme d'argent"" is on there though, yay :)"

joe has been working on a ""secret project"" at keithley...it's so secret that he's the only one who knows about it :) he decided to work on it for a few hours on saturday and sunday because too many people were asking him what he was doing when they passed by his desk during the week. he asked me if i wanted to tag along on sunday...he got to see what i did at namsa when i was working there (he still gets a kick out of ""L-929 mouse fibroblast cells"") but i hadn't had the opportunity to see what he does at keithley. it was really cool...i'm so proud of him :) i bet he'll land a job with nasa some day :)

josh has been in town the past few days. we got to hang out with him last night. i'm glad his mom is okay...i've only talked with her a few times, but she seems like a really wonderful person. we made josh eat one of our crazy super-lean spicy hamburgers with a million ingredients...i can't give away the recipe though because it's top secret :) you'll have to come over and try it sometime :) josh liked it, yay! AND he danced a jig with me (i use the word ""jig"" loosely) :) josh is cool :)

tim russert sucks. he's totally a closet republican. he was such a jerk to howard dean last year on <i>meet the press</i>, but he lobbed softball questions at bush during the 2000 campaign and once again yesterday. <a href=""http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/pressingissues_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2086684"">10 questions he should have asked bush</a>.

we watched part of a dog show on tv the other day...i really need to see <i>best in show</i> some time :) all of the dogs were adorable though. beagle puppies are the cutest things EVER. does anyone know where the picture is of pepsi sitting next to that tiny ball? i think that was the day we got him. is he actually going to be 7 this year? i can't believe it! i was telling mom about the dog show, and she says we all need to get beagles some day. then they can play with each other :) they ARE pack dogs, after all :) we have to wait until we get a house though...i would feel sooo bad keeping one cooped up in the apartment all day! they need a yard to run around (and bark) in, preferably with lots of rabbits nearby :) a pug would be a good apartment dog though...andy and erika brought theirs over when they came to visit around thanksgiving. his name is gimli :) i used to think pugs were sort of weird-looking, but gimli was SO cute! he had a really wrinkly, smooshy face with such sweet eyes :) welsh corgis are also REALLY cute. <a href=""http://corgi.ncn.com/ALBUM/album.htm"">the pictures here</a> are making me melt. one of my profs used to bring his corgi to work with him, but then case banned pets on campus :( 

a cat might not be bad until we get a house though. leia was great when we cat-sit her while the freses were in australia. isn't she cute?

<img src=""http://s91734086.onlinehome.us/photos/misc/leia.jpg"">

i don't like cats nearly as much as dogs, but they ARE fun to watch, especially crazy ones like leia :)

i finally found the <a href=""http://www.comedycentral.com/mp/play.php?reposid=/multimedia/tds/colb/cobert_6135.html"">the piece that stephen colbert did about cookie monster</a> on <i>the daily show</i>. it's not <i>quite</i> as funny as i remembered it, but close :) man, little kids are hilarious. as is stephen colbert.

teaching has been going really well. it's not the most exciting material to teach, but it's easy and actually has immediate practical applications for the students since they'll be graduating and in the workplace fairly soon. i've already gotten one e-mail from a student who said he's been able to put his 398 ""skillz"" (as he says) to use after just a few weeks of class. he's president of case's ddr club and had to write a proposal to request more funding. it must have been good, because he received more funding than he requested :) it's really gratifying when students say i helped them :) the ESL students i worked with in the writing center were the best in that sense...i really felt like i was helping them, and more importantly, THEY felt like they were learning something. aida and nurit were probably my favorites...they're from kazakhstan and israel, respectively. besides being super enthusiastic students, they were just really cool and interesting people :) we would always get off topic and have some amazing conversations about ""the immigrant experience."" i miss tutoring! it's fun to work one-on-one with students.

rich is holding a rehearsal for his new show at our apartment right now. joe and ken and adrienne are going to be in it along with some of rich's other friends. the poster is hilarious...it's a take-off on n.w.a.'s <i>straight outta compton</i>. the funniest part is that rich used joe's prop gun from <i>lawn statues</i> in it...it's pointed straight down at the camera so you can totally see the orange cap on the barrel screaming ""FAKE GUN"" :)

- prof. umrigar was on npr this morning talking about being a writer. it was really cool...the panel said some pretty inspiring things about writing as a career. now i want to start that biography of mom and dad :) but i can't!!!

"event","i'm seriously excited about the new hampshire primaries today. i need help. i'm a politics junkie. i mean, who wanted to be a political columnist when they were in junior high?! me. i don't know if part of it has to do with being the child of immigrants (i DO know that part of it has to do with me being a nerd), but the democratic process in this country thrills me more often than not. even during the recount debacle in 2000, i really felt proud to be an american citizen, as corny as it sounds. if something like that had happened in bangladesh, for example, you can bet there would have been violent riots and just complete chaos. but the people here went about their business and had faith that everything would work itself out. and even though the outcome wasn't what many of us (the majority of us, actually!) would have liked, we got over it and moved on. i don't know, maybe part of it has to do with people feeling somewhat detached from the goings-on in washington, but part of it is also steeped in (again) faith in the <i>principles</i> of the system. that doesn't make much sense, i know...i'm still struggling to explain it to myself. i'll try to clarify it as this election year unfolds :)  

i don't think i could say that i'm ever embarrassed to be an american citizen...mom and dad have sacrificed too much and worked too hard to come here for me to feel that way. i can *definitely* be embarrassed about our leaders' actions and be frustrated with our government at times, but i am never sorry for the rights i have here. who knows what kind of life shaoly and reuben and i would have had in bangladesh if mom and dad didn't have a sense of ambition?  

on the subject of bangladesh, joe and i might be going there with dad and uncle and uncle's brother-in-law andy at the end of the year. it's VERY tentative right now, but the prospect is exciting! i haven't been there in years, and joe has been really keen on going for a long time now. he's read so much about its history and culture...i think he knows more about bangladesh than i do! my grandmother would love to meet him too. if we go, joe and i won't stay in bangladesh the whole time; we'll probably split the time between there and india. i've never been there, and i'm DYING to visit. taj mahal, here we come. maybe :) and hopefully we'll get to see my best bud from college, sarbani...she's been living in bihar the past few years.

i had flint's seminar tonight, so i didn't leave campus until 7. it was soooooo pretty when i was walking back from class! the field behind guilford glittered pristinely with a fresh layer of snow, the wind swirled the gently falling flakes in slow spirals, and the crunching of my footsteps was the only sound breaking the otherworldly stillness. the scene made me happy :) 

i swear the parking garage is haunted. i kept hearing this creepy ""aaaaWOOOOOO"" moaning-type sound as i was heading to my car. eek!

the drive home was NOT fun. it was definitely ""make your own lane"" on 271, and my gasoline light came on about halfway home. don't tell mom. she'll freak out.

kerry 91%
clark 86%
dean 85%
edwards 77%
lieberman 75%
bush 6%

"event","<i>home movies</i> was great on sunday. josh, we taped it for you (i don't know when you'll actually get the tape though). i think you're going to like this one...shannon, fenton, AND walter & perry all made appearances. 

isn't it funny that ""HE HATE ME"" is going to the super bowl?

waaaaah! i'm going to DIE this semester. i don't know where i'm going to find the time to do everything between taking classes, teaching 398, and studying for the master's exam. i'm already feeling stressed out...the first week alone had me staying up until 4:30 in the morning a couple of times. 

it's amazing how much time i need to devote to teaching. i feel like i'm prepping more for each session despite the fact that i'm lecturing far less than before. the course is going better than i expected though. teaching a class of mostly final-semester seniors is wayyyy different from teaching first-semester freshmen, in a good way. you can check out my course website <a href=""http://home.cwru.edu/~sca2"">here</a>...i'm still working on it. i have to fix the menu on the left. 

we watched (and mocked) bush's state of the union address last night. as expected, it made me angry. it definitely came off as more of a kickoff to his re-election campaign rather than a call for cooperation as the state of the union speech typically is. some thoughts: 

     - how funny was it when he noted that the kay report had ""identified dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program activities""? it sounded more like <font size=""4""><b>""WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION</b></font>...<font size=""1"">-related program activities.""</font>

     - what was up with that ridiculous non-sequitur about steroids in pro sports? he basically just said ""athletes are role models. steroids are bad. stop using them."" that's it. he didn't propose any committee or program or initiative or whatever. just ""stop doing it.""

     - i was glad to see that SOME democrats had the guts to applaud the fact that the patriot act would expire next year. bush didn't seem too pleased about that.

     - the nonsense about ""no child left behind"" also made me laugh. wasn't bush going to be the ""education president"" before 9/11? instead he CUT funding to his OWN PROGRAM. way to go. 

     - the speech just made even more evident the fact that this administration has done NOTHING on the domestic front besides infringe on civil liberties and inflate the federal deficit. fixing the health care system? shoring up social security? balancing the budget? 250,000 new jobs (ohio alone has LOST that many since bush took office)? what happened to all of that? he was in toledo today by the way, right next door to good old namsa. 

i really don't know who to support for the democratic nomination. i've liked dean since that first debate last summer. he's possibly still my favorite, but some of the things he's said have bothered me. i can't quite put my finger on it. i have no idea why the media is making such a big deal about his concession speech after the iowa caucuses though...he was clearly trying to rev up his campaign workers after a disappointing showing. people are overreacting when they're questioning whether he has control of his emotions. i wonder if mom and dad are still going to those meetups for dean. i do NOT like kerry...not now anyway. he's much too rehearsed and polished and al gore-ish and ""establishment"" and smug and patrician. john edwards is kind of intriguing...even though he voted for the war, he has a pretty positive message and seems like a good guy. he's not very experienced though...he would make a good vp candidate. clark is sort of a question mark. he would definitely match up well against bush when it comes to national security, but is this guy really a democrat? he voted for nixon and reagan and was praising bush's actions in iraq as recently as last april. obviously, people can change, but i don't know if i quite buy clark's turnaround just in time to run for president. plus, he has no experience in public office. he seems *extremely* intelligent though...if he's the real deal, i think i could support him. i like a lot of what kucinich says, but he has NO chance of getting the nomination. lieberman is a nice guy, but he's far too conservative and ""bush-lite"" despite his insistence to the contrary (but i DO feel kind of bad for him about the whole ""al gore endorsing dean"" thing). sigh, there's yet another debate on thursday night. maybe it will help narrow things down (i doubt it).

i just realized that i haven't gotten a haircut in several months. i need to find a good stylist in cleveland. barbara at david broadway in toledo was awesome, but i don't know if i'll be able to go home until spring break. my hair is so weird. i wish i had shaoly's hair...hers is so thick and straight and shiny! mine used to be like that...then i hit junior high and it got all wavy and unmanageable :p

- yoplait custard-style key lime pie yogurt
- triple vanilla ice cream 
- peanut butter crunch being on a 2-for-1 sale at the eagle (can you tell i went grocery shopping on the way back from campus?)
- <i>this is the modern world</i> by the jam
- cooking delicious meals with joe (indian food tonight)...i think our culinary skills have advanced by leaps and bounds since getting married. it's fun to do all that work when you're cooking <i>with</i> someone :) we're going to try one new recipe a week...this weekend it's going to be country captain chicken, yum. 
- that snowy and beautiful field on pettibone where the dilapidated barn used to be (but it would be even cooler if the barn were still there)
- my class with prof. oster
- final fantasy ix...i &hearts; vivi! 
- hopefully <a href=""http://www.square-enix.co.jp/dvd/ff7ac/""><i>final fantasy vii: advent children</i></a>...the trailer looks really cool. sephiroth was definitely one of the best villains in the ff universe. it's hard to forget how much the <i>final fantasy: the spirits within</i> movie sucked though. but i have a soft spot for ff7...it just felt so EPIC. hopefully the story will be better than the one in <i>spirits</i>.
- since i'm on a final fantasy roll, nobuo uematsu is awesome too. as is yoshitaka amano.

joe and i watched some of that matador dvd...good stuff. the yo la tengo video with the guys from mr. show was a particular favorite :)"

"event","i feel bad. i wish i didn't have so much work to do this weekend! ken was feeling kind of bummed and wanted joe and me to come hang out tonight, but i just have too much stuff to do for monday. so i told joe to go since i would be working all night anyway, but ken realllllly wanted me to come too. i guess he has a christmas present for me (!), and he kept telling joe ""it's always better when sally's around"" and he even offered to help me with my work :) then he said i should just come over and do my work on their computer and emerge periodically to give hugs to joe :) he also really wanted us to stay over and try out his apparently awesome new sleeper sofa. it was very tempting, but i KNOW i wouldn't get any work done as much as i would try! waaaah :( so i didn't go. but i DID make joe go...he doesn't get the chance to hang out with ken much these days. 

i don't know what's going on in the apartment below ours, but it's big. and i think it's happening right under where i'm typing.

some of <a href=""http://www.bushin30seconds.org"">these anti-bush commercials</a> are amusing...joe should have totally entered the contest though :)

we made chicken parmigiano last night...it was *awesome*! joe made his special spaghetti sauce instead of the one in this ridiculously easy rachael ray recipe though:

<lj-cut text=""you must try this"">
**********
Parmigiano and Herb Chicken Breast Tenders
Prep Time: 15 minutes 		Cook Time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 BIG servings 		 

Ingredients:
Olive oil, for frying
1 1/2 pounds chicken breast tenders
Salt and pepper
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 large eggs, beaten with 1/4 cup water

Breading:
2 cups Italian style bread crumbs
1 cup shredded Parmesan
6 sprigs or stems fresh thyme leaves, stripped and chopped, 2 to 3 tablespoons
6 sprigs fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped, 3 tablespoons
2 handfuls chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

Chicken Parmigiano, recipe follows

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place a nonstick cookie sheet in oven with a tin foil liner.

Heat 1/2-inch oil in a large nonstick skillet or frying pan over medium to medium high heat.

Season chicken tenders with salt and pepper. Wash hands. Place flour in a shallow dish. Beat eggs with water in a second dish along side the flour. In a third dish, combine the breading ingredients. Coat chicken in flour, then egg, then bread and cheese mixture. To keep your hands clean, ask for plastic gloves at the butcher counter. To ease your clean up, try using disposable tin pie tins for the flour, egg and bread crumbs.

Cook chicken until deeply golden on each side, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to cookie sheet in preheated oven and finish off for another 5 minutes cooking time. Cook chicken 5 or 6 tenders at a time in a single layer, adding additional oil if necessary. If the chicken begins to brown too quickly lower heat slightly. Serve chicken hot or cold with green salad or, complete as a Parmigiano.

Simple Tomato Sauce for Chicken Parmigiano:
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 small white onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14 ounce) can chunky style crushed tomatoes
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 cup chicken broth or stock
A handful fresh basil leaves, torn into small pieces
Coarse salt
1 1/2 cups shredded provolone
1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
1 pound spaghetti, cooked to al dente

Set water on to boil for pasta and prepare according to package directions for al dente. Before coating chicken, add oil, onions and garlic to a saucepan to cook medium low heat. Stir occasionally for 10 minutes while you are working on the chicken. Add both cans of tomatoes and a cup of chicken broth and bring sauce to a bubble. Reduce heat to a simmer until ready to serve. Stir in torn basil and season sauce with salt, to your taste.

Place a little of the sauce on the chicken tenders, top with the shredded provolone and Parmigiano. Place in oven or broiler to melt the cheese and then serve. Coat the hot, cooked pasta lightly with sauce then serve.

i've been sick the past few days. don't tell mom...she'll immediately call me and talk my ear off for 20 minutes about drinking juice and eating soup and gargling with salt water (BLECH) and washing my hands etc. etc. :) i haven't been sick in a reeeeeally long time. joe made me take some ""cold-eez""...they're these zinc supplements that look like lozenges. they've really helped! 

the pictures from the new mars rover are amazing.

waaaaah, i don't want to go back to school! the semester starts monday :p where did the holidays go? i have to finish planning the syllabus for the class i'm teaching. i got assigned to teach engl 398, this horrible ""english for engineers"" course :p oh well...at least i won't have nearly as much to prepare for or grade. that'll give me time to study for the master's exam. 

brrrrr, it's COLD today! very much looking forward to hawai'i this summer :) reuben and shaoly, you need to convince mom and dad to plan a family vacation for the same time and place...how fun would that be?

got back to the apartment this afternoon. one of our fishies died while we were gone :( i think he might have been sick...he hadn't been eating much lately. the other fish is fine though, and so are the dwarf froggies. watched the bengals blow their shot at the playoffs by losing to the browns, booooooo :p why couldn't the browns have played like that last week against baltimore? at least the ravens won against the steelers, so it wouldn't really have mattered if the bengals had won anyway. oh well...there's always next year! hope springs eternal :) it HAS to if you're a bengals fan! 

joe wants me to co-write his next movie with him :) i'm excited! joe has come up with the beginnings of a plot, and has one scene pretty well developed in his head. lately we've been brainstorming ideas for the antagonist, but joe keeps shooting down all of mine, grrrrrr! it's okay though...we agreed that this would be a collaborative effort, so i've been rejecting his ideas with equal vigor :) for some reason, joe wants me to be responsible for the dialogue, to ""inject the human element"" into these characters, as he says. i don't know why he thinks i would be particularly good at that, but i'll give it a whirl :)"

"event","rundown of the past few days:

<lj-cut text=""christmas with the freses"">

the freses have this system for giving presents in that we're sort of ""assigned"" the people we get gifts for. everyone ends up giving/receiving a ""large"" present, a ""medium"" present, and a stocking full of stuff. a strict budget limit is set for each category too. so i went christmas shopping with bridget on tuesday to track down some presents. it was really cool to get the chance to hang out with her. she's an awesome person...definitely bound to do some great things in her life. on the way to the mall, we passed by a scene of honeybaked ham-induced mania! cars were backed up for about half a mile, all waiting to get to the honeybaked ham store! there was actually a cop directing traffic into the store's parking lot. people love their ham on christmas :)
 
i had to run to the library at case on wednesday, and joe tagged along so we could do some last-minute shopping for stocking stuffers. i really love hanging out with joe :) it sounds silly to say that about your own husband, but it's true! it was cool to be back on campus with him too :) the library was a little spooky...joe and i were the only people there except for the librarians. we had lunch in that crazy new shopping plaza on cedar, legacy village. that place is HUGE! we ate at stir-crazy, this fake-y ""asian"" restaurant, but the food was decent. the snow really started to come down by then, but we got home safely.  

we spent christmas eve with the freses. decorated the tree, ate christmas cookies, sang carols, and just had some nice family time. i also went to my first midnight mass. joe warned me that i would probably be the only non-white person there, but that didn't bother me...it happens a lot! hudson is definitely ""whiter"" than sylvania, and i didn't think that was possible. it was funny that we ended up sitting in the same pew as the only other minorities in the church, and they happened to be indian :) mass was interesting. the only other one i had ever been to was way back in 6th grade when i was looking at potential junior high schools to attend, and my parents made me spend a day at st. joan of arc in toledo. i think it kind of disturbed me back then, but this time around it didn't. i wasn't able to take communion, but i DID receive a blessing from the priest. we ran into ken, adrienne, ann and mr. walczak afterwards. ken was wearing a heart monitor! i hope he's doing okay now. 

we spent the night at joe's parents' house. the next morning joe's mom made a yummy breakfast, and we also got to eat some of her awesome candy cane bread. we opened stockings and presents afterwards. joe's mom went nuts with my stocking! i don't know how she stayed in the budget limit! i got joe's dad a cd by tom harrell (this schizophrenic trumpeter) and a bunch of sugar-free candy for his stocking. i gave bridget a pair of jeans, a purse, and money for her trip to mexico, and i gave claire volume 2 of the mst3k dvd collection (<i>pod people</i>! <i>cave dwellers</i>! <i>angel's revenge</i>! and shorts!). bridget gave me a fancy new computer chair, which i REALLY needed. and it has a massage function! i'll probably fall asleep when i'm typing my papers :) she also gave me a cute messenger bag, and a new winter hat, scarf, and mittens set. claire got me mario party 5 for gamecube, yay! i mean, yavol! 
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""christmas with the ahmeds"">
we left the freses' house around noon and went back to the apartment to pack up stuff and wrap presents before we left for my folks' house. the drive was a little long because it started to snow harder the closer we got to toledo. we had carl's awesome motown mix cd to keep us company though. it was great to get home and see my family, the dog, the christmas lights, the tree, everything. i love being home :) mom made so much good food too :) curry, chicken korma, parathas, shingharas...yum!

we opened presents after dinner. i gave dad jhumpa lahiri's new book <i>the namesake</i>. he really liked <i>interpreter of maladies</i> after he borrowed it from me. (this was a big ""media"" christmas for dad! mom also gave him a book, al franken's <i>lies and the lying liars who tell them</i>, joe gave him satyajit ray's apu trilogy on dvd, and reuben gave him season 2 of <i>24</i>, among other things). i gave mom a paper shredder (she actually wanted one!), a gift card, and a set of candles (she loves those). joe and i gave reuben <i>sword of mana</i> for gb advance, the <i>pirates of the caribbean</i> dvd, and a gift card to best buy. we gave shaoly a gift card to amazon and a messenger bag (we can be twins). gift cards are big with my family because no one ever says what they want :) 

i received some really great presents. thanks everyone! mom and dad gave me some books (gah, i have to wait until the summer to read them!), some cds, a digital watch, a sweater, a new omelette pan (and it has a lid! thank you thank you thank you!), and some other cool stuff. reuben kept handing me my gifts to open in a certain order. i should have realized he was up to something, but i didn't. first he gave me a couple of classic psx games, final fantasy vii and final fantasy ix. awesome! then he gave me four more games to open(!): final fantasy x (YAY! i WILL turn joe into a final fantasy maniac, bwahahaha!), suikoden III, kingdom hearts, and wild arms 3, all for ps2. this was strange, because joe and i don't have a ps2. reuben knew we were planning on getting one, but we were waiting for the price to come down. so he said that we HAD to get one now that he had given us all these games. but when he handed the last present to joe, we discovered it was a PS2!!! reuben definitely went all out with presents this year...he's such a generous guy :) 

the rest of last night was devoted to scarfing down tons of food, playing games, watching dvds, and being silly. a great christmas :) i love the holidays and i love being with family :)

"event","happy 16th birthday to my sister :) i can't wait to see her and my brother tomorrow!

d.c. was fun :) the drive down there was beautiful...lots of mountains and winding roads. i love when snow sticks to the trees. georgetown has a great campus (shaoly, you should add this to your list of colleges to apply to). bridget lives down the street from the house in <i>the exorcist</i>! the infamous steps from the end of the movie are there too. we looked at them but didn't walk down them...too creepy :) and josh, bridget's roommates remember you fondly :) we stayed with joe's *awesome* cousins ned and robin in their *awesome* new house. they have the two sweetest, most adorable kids ever. holy cow, they were SO CUTE! 

went for a terrible jog today. i was only out for like 20 minutes. the light snow flurries turned into a blizzard as soon as i stepped outside, plus the roads were too slippery :p 

i can't believe we've been getting so much snow already. joe and i are going snowboarding again some time soon. we went once during our junior year at case, and i returned with my knee sporting the biggest bruise i've ever had. i fell on every trip down the hill. i think the problem was that i chose the wrong foot to lead with...when the dude at the lodge asked me whether i was right-footed or left-footed, i just figured ""left"" because i'm left-handed. wrong! i realized this on my first run, but i decided to tough it out instead of exchanging the board since the lodge seemed like it was miles away. so i'm looking forward to trying again, this time with the right type of board :)

okay, <i>24</i> is officially back on track. but we have to wait THREE WEEKS for the next episode! waaaaah!

<lj-cut text=""more 24 nonsense"">

quick comments: 
- whoa, jack and claudia?! what about kate?
- phew, i hope anne is gone for good. probably one of the most boring characters ever in the <i>24</i> universe. what happened to lynn? did she survive that fall in season 2? she rocked...i always thought she and the president would have been a good match...
- was jack really going to blow away chase? or did he realize the gun wasn't loaded? easily the tensest moment of the episode...
- chase is an idiot, by the way. a well-meaning idiot, but an idiot all the same...
- i bet the competing buyer is nina, but as much as i want to see her back on the show, i think she's been the ""surprise"" element enough times already. joe thinks it could be marie."

I've probably asked Joe to do that line from <i>The Ben Stiller Show</i> about a million times the past few days. And every time it's made me laugh so hard my stomach hurts. Joe does really good impressions :)

We're going to Washington, D.C. for a couple of days this week to hang out with Bridget and bring her home for the holidays. Should be fun...I haven't been to D.C. since the summer before college. Maybe we'll eat some more yummy Ethiopian food :) 

I think we're seeing <i>Return of the King</i> with Ken and Adrienne (*must remember to burn those CDs for Ken*) right after we get back from D.C. And we've already planned on seeing it again Saturday as part of our LOTR marathon/birthday celebration for Shaoly. I can't wait! 

Josh called us a few days ago...it makes me happy to hear him happy :) He really deserves it. He told Joe to tell me that I'm an ""awesome dude,"" which cracked me up :) I KNEW he would like NYC! It's much more his style than L.A. I told him to check out some of my favorite places: MoMA, Serendipity 3 (*drools at thought of frozen hot chocolate*), SoHo, Strawberry Fields in Central Park/""IMAGINE"" mosaic, FAO Schwarz (toys galore! and Han frozen in carbonite!), ice rink at Rockefeller Plaza...sigh. We need to visit him there :)  

Who-dey! The Bengals won! The defense was Swiss cheese, but the offense put on a show. Plus, the Ravens lost, bwahahaha! 

<lj-cut text=""Bengals as division champs?! Hell is on the verge of freezing over"">

Yes, I'm a geek for writing this down, but who knows the next time the Bengals will be in the playoff hunt in December? After 12 years of unbelievable futility, I'm excited :) I checked the NFL tie-breaking rules and I think these are the possible playoff scenarios for the Bengals (I'm assuming they'll have to win the division to make it to the postseason; the last wild card spot will probably go to either Miami or Denver, especially after the Browns choked yesterday):

1. Easiest would be to run the table and win the final two games against the Rams and the Browns. Even if the Ravens beat the Browns and Steelers to also finish 10-6, the Bengals would have the edge. The first four tie-breakers with the Ravens would be a wash: head-to-head competition (even), division record (even), record vs. common opponents (even), AFC record (even). But the Bengals would have the edge in the fifth tie-breaker, strength of victory (winning percentage of teams they have beaten), especially because finishing 10-6 would mean they had beaten the Rams (who at worst will finish 11-5). 

2. Lose to St. Louis, beat Cleveland, and Ravens lose either game. Bengals and Ravens would both finish 9-7. The first tie-breaker would be even, but the Bengals would win the second tie-breaker by being 4-2 in the division vs. the Ravens' 3-3 mark.

3. Beat St. Louis, lose to Cleveland, and Ravens lose either game. Bengals and Ravens would both finish 9-7. The scenario would be the same as if they both finished 10-6; the tie-breaker would come down to strength of victory with the Bengals again having the edge. 

4. Both the Bengals and Ravens lose their final two games. Both finish 8-8. The Bengals would win the second tie-breaker by being 3-3 in the division vs. the Ravens being 2-4. 

So basically, the Bengals' ""magic number"" to clinch the division (any combo of Bengals wins plus Ravens losses) is two. Should be a crazy end to the season :) Obviously, the Bengals are in the driver's seat. If they win, they don't have to worry about what Baltimore does. But St. Louis is *tough*...they have the best record in the NFC, as many offensive weapons as the Bengals do, and they've been nearly unbeatable at home the last few seasons. Playing on the road is difficult...the Bengals crumbled under the pressure last week in Baltimore, and I bet the Ravens' raucous fans contributed to their problems. But that's what the home crowd is supposed to do. St. Louis will be a huge test (the Rams won't back down even though they've clinched their division...they'll be playing for home-field advantage in the playoffs). But while the Ravens have an easier schedule ahead on paper, I think they'll have their hands full with the Browns and Steelers. Some pretty heated rivalries are at stake there, particularly with the Browns. I can't believe I'm typing this, but GO BROWNS! GO STEELERS!

While I'm on the subject of football, I found <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/story?page=bottom10celebrations"">this story</a> amusing. Numbers 5 and 6 are my favorites. I don't understand why the NFL is so uptight about endzone celebrations. They're hilarious. That being said, Horn's cell phone stunt was ridiculous. How does calling someone qualify as a ""celebration""? Lame. 

Reuben just sent me some pictures of him at work. I'm impressed that he gets his own cubicle :) (I have to share an office with three other grad students :) At least we each have our own desk!) I'm really proud of Reuben for getting a good job right out of college!

"event","i love <i>24</i>. you have to suspend a huge amount of disbelief to enjoy it, but it's really fun once you do. jack bauer is insane...you gotta love him. i caught up on seasons 1 and 2 on dvd over the summer (after seeing how obsessed joe and rich and josh and dad were), and compared to those, i thought this season was lagging a bit. i like the new characters...chloe (a.k.a. ""david cross's ex"") is great, and i think chase is a nice addition as jack's partner. the storyline just seemed to be progressing unevenly. i know the other seasons took four or five episodes to really get going...this season didn't seem to be hitting its stride yet though. 

but HOLY CRAP! what was up with that plot twist last night??? every episode ends with some kind of a twist, but last night's was NUTS...best one of the season so far. 

<lj-cut text=""many questions and some comments...spoilers within, so DON'T READ unless you've been keeping up with 24"">
********************
are we supposed to believe hector is stupid enough to trust bauer again??? and why didn't gael say anything to chappelle about working with almeida? did he think chappelle would nix the whole plan, whatever it is? why did he try to escape from CTU instead of just explaining everything? what's the deal with kyle singer? why were salazar's people so bent on capturing him and holding him in a containment cell when they knew he wasn't actually infected? and is this plotline about the president's girlfriend going anywhere? it's the dullest story in the show right now, not to mention completely ridiculous. and what about the ending to last season? are they going to explain that? and WHERE'S NINA?? you KNOW she has something to do with all this :) and sherry too! bwahahaha :) 

chappelle was hilarious last night (""chloe is a pain in the ass"" almost made me stop missing mason). chloe's apology to kim was great too. and dessler striding coolly down the hallway towards gael as he was pointing the gun at her was awesome...for a moment there, i was worried she was going to be joining her husband in the hospital. not that she would have been there long anyway...seriously, tony back at CTU like three hours after getting shot in the neck? time to suspend disbelief :)

"event","i have this bad habit of never finishing journal entries. most of my journal is private, but i have a number of entries that i intended to make public and never completed. i'm going to start making those public; the only people who read this are close friends and family anyway, so you guys will forgive me for having a.d.d. and not finishing anything :) so here's the first one (originally written on saturday, hence the above date)...i'll let you know when i've made older entries public:

yay! the semester ended yesterday! now i have to get started on my final papers :p i have two 20-page essays due in the next week and a half, gah. 

<lj-cut text=""click here if you're an english nerd and dying to read my rambling reflections on my essay topics""> i have the one for my adaptation class fleshed out pretty well in my head. i'm going to write about the colonial undercurrents running through mary shelley's <i>frankenstein</i> manifested in the creature and safie, and then i'm going to discuss how alasdair gray's <i>poor things</i> brings those undercurrents to the forefront in the character bella baxter. i'm also going to bring in the epilogue from v.s. naipaul's <i>in a free state</i>, as it inspired one of the central moments in <i>poor things</i>, the alexandria incident. i haven't spent much time conceptualizing the one for the samuel johnson class, but i'm planning on using my presentation on <i>journey to the western islands of scotland</i> as a springboard. i think i'm going to end up writing about the genre of travel literature in the 18th century and the role it played in developing english perceptions of ""self"" and ""other"" in light of imperialism. the samuel johnson piece is particularly interesting because it deals with scotland, a country that occupied a sort of nebulous space between colonizer and colonized. as much as johnson approved of the scots taking on the characteristics, language, and tastes of the english, a sense of melancholy permeates <i>journey</i>. my thesis is going to revolve around the idea that even though johnson firmly believed british culture was the pinnacle of civilization and that assimilation was inevitable (i'm going to use some interesting definitions from his <i>dictionary of the english language</i> here), he ultimately mourns the loss of a scottish national identity, particularly in the highlands. i love how i always manage to work some type of colonial/post-colonial angle into practically every paper i've written for grad school :)

went for a couple of nice jogs this week. i really like running in the cold! it seems much easier for some reason...maybe the cold numbs my muscles so i can't feel them getting tired :) or maybe i run faster just to get back to our warm (roasting, according to some people) apartment :) 

i'm really excited for josh...he got a super cool job lead in NEW YORK CITY! i &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; nyc! what an awesome town. he got called back for a second interview, and this time he gets to meet the famous client. i hope he gets the job...i'm sure he would have an even more amazing time in nyc than he did in l.a. :)

mariokart double dash is ridiculously fun. baby luigi is my favorite :) joe and i have been playing obsessively this past week. we're trying to unlock the all-cup mode (you have to place first in the 150cc special cup), but the rainbow road has been our undoing every time. i think i must have set a record for most times falling off the track :)"

"event","the shins last night! i had class late, so i met up with joe and bob for dinner at tommy's (i think i could eat those spinach pies every day and never get sick of them...yum!) and then we headed to the beachland. great show. the lead singer looks like kevin spacey with a beard. the bassist looks like <i>breakfast club</i>-era judd nelson. and joe thinks the keyboardist looks like dan ackroyd. speaking of the keyboardist, he showed everyone his dukes of hazzard watch and held it up to the microphone so we could hear that it plays ""dixie"" :) bob and joe wanted me to include that in the setlist, but i don't think it counts :) 

setlist (i didn't have a pen, so i started writing it down with my eyeliner pencil (which was in my pocket for some reason)...i borrowed a pen from bob later when i realized the eyeliner was nearly illegible):

1. pressed in a book (what a great way to start the show)
2. kissing the lipless (one of my faves off the new album)
3. when i goose-step
4. one by one all day
5. turn a square (AWESOME)
6. pink bullets
7. caring is creepy
8. mine's not a high horse
9. girl inform me
10. saint simon (my current fave off the new album...it sounded just as good live. the vocals were gorgeous, particularly the ""mercy's eyes are blue"" part)
11. girl on the wing (yay yay yay yay yay)
12. eating styes from elephants' eyes (rooockin' old track i hadn't heard before...i'll have to pick up that e.p.)
13. weird divide (i don't think they intended to play this one, but someone shouted out a request for it and they obliged...they're such nice guys :) )
14. so says i
15. young pilgrims
16. gone for good (i LOVE this song...it reminds me of wilco for some reason, especially the ""get used to the lonesome / you must atone some"" part)

encore:
17. new slang (some jerk kept yelling drunkenly for this one in between EVERY SONG...i almost wish the band HADN'T played it)
18. those bold city girls (a girl in the front requested this one...james mercer sounded pretty surprised that she knew about it and said they HAD to play it because she must be a hardcore fan :) i'm glad she requested it...i hadn't heard it before, and it's a good song!)
19. the celibate life
20. destroy the heart (house of love cover...GREAT britpop song!)
21. know your onion! (probably my favorite shins song, so i'm really happy they played it :) even though the aforementioned obnoxious drunk guy got to dance up on stage during it)

it was awesome to finally see the shins in concert...i really really liked <i>oh, inverted world</i>, but the new album <i>chutes too narrow</i> just blew me away. mercer has a great voice and such an interesting sense of melody...the hooks in his songs are sublime and emerge in unusual places. some brilliant, poignant lyrics lie beneath the catchiness of the songs as well. and it all sounds even better live. we had a really good time at the show :) bob and joe are hilarious together :) they kept coming up with ridiculous plans to meet the band, most of them involving me punching mercer in the stomach for some reason. bob said i could get away with it because i'm small. somehow, i didn't think it was a good idea :)"

"event","wow, junior senior ROCKED last night! so much fun. they played at the newly relocated and revamped grog shop. it's bigger and cleaner than the old grog shop, but i don't think i like it as much. i think the band played everything off the album, and then finished with a medley consisting of an original rap and covers of ""twist and shout"" and salt 'n pepa's ""push it."" crowd kinda sucked though...joe noticed some people on the far side of the stage giving the band the finger the whole time :p someone also threw a cup of beer on stage at senior :p we met them afterwards, and joe got them to sign his poster. junior was impressed when joe said he had been following them since ludo x :) joe must have been ""the only one in the world"" who had, according to junior :) we didn't stick around for electric six. i listened to one of their albums at borders a few months ago and didn't really like it.

the opening band, rasputina, was horrible. josh and joe kept whispering hilarious asides about their suckiness...the girl next to joe was a huge fan though and kept casting dirty looks their way. i don't know how she heard what they were saying. i met up with betsy in the lobby after rasputina's set, yay! it was so great to see her :) we mostly talked about how her wedding plans were going. i'm so excited for her! i can't wait :) we found her after the show too...she has a crush on stuart now :) as everyone should :)

Tuesday was the most gorgeous day I can remember in Cleveland. I spent a long time sitting and reading on the fountain in front of Guilford, marveling at the leaves and the sun lighting up the field behind the library. Later in the evening during our seminar break, the sky stopped me in my tracks as I was passing the window on the second floor landing. The sunset was amazing (almost as awe-inspiring as the one on our wedding day)...my prof spent the break out on the porch, and said the sky reminded him of going to the opera as a kid and watching the curtain rise on the action.    Wha??? English professors are funny :)    

I'm SO EXCITED about Junior Senior tomorrow night...Joe's had their debut CD for 2 YEARS, so he's been waiting forever to see them! He predicted back then that they would break into the U.S. market. I was skeptical, but he was right :)"

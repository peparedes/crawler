On Saturday I have been to Dominion again. There were a lot of people laughing at me. I think I like goths. They are so friendly and the chicks ... *giggedy giggedy* (hehe, I learned that phrase very fast, didn`t I ;P )
I think I will have to get some new outfits for clubbing... I will ask Mom2, what she thinks :)

Mom1 had to say goodby to many people that evening and mom2 was dancing a lot. She was chained up and so was not really able to hold me a lot, but my new friend Liam from Derry looked well after me :)
There seemed to be many goodbyes at night, when we left and so it took quite a while until we were able to make our way to the airport. But hey, at least I boobgrabbed a hot American chick that was about to leave as well ...
There I spent my last hours with Mom2, had bad mocha and finally had to leave her to her flight. All sad , but Mom2 hugged me a lot in the taxi back to my new home and now here I am.

Yesterday I spend mainly sleeping and relaxing and got more hugs so I wouldn`t get too miserable.
Mom2 told me that this evening a really cute Canadian chick is coming over and I`m really looking forward to it :) ... oh and on the next weekend I`ll go up to Derry with Mom2, uncle Alan and Canadian and will see my friend Liam again and rock around :)"

During <lj user=""silke_germany"">'s time in Ireland I was allowed to go out into a ""night club"" for the first time in my life. They obviously took me to the Domnion, where I got my first real kiss from R.! It was great!
Now I'm really sad because my mom No.1 is flying back to Germany tonight and she doesn't know, when she'll be able to come back to Ireland for a visit or if and when my Mom No.2 will be able to go to someplace in Germany near to where she lives. So I guess a lot oof phone calls will be necessary so I don't miss my Mom No.1 too much. 
But I'm also quite happy because I get to spend a lot of time with Mom No.2, <lj user=""nodis""> and uncle <lj user=""alan_ie"">."

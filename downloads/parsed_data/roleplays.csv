The dark shadows of the Misty Mountains cast their veil of homely thickness across the camp of the Dunlendings. A handful of fires are lit here and there, and few are awake at this hour.

By one of these fires sits Morningson the vagabond. He sits with his legs crossed. His coat hangs from his shoulders and his hat rests on the ground next to him. His packs are nowhere in sight, as is his sword.

The tramp has been scarce with words lately, and has not been around that much. There is no specific aura of gloominess about him, however, as he sits by the fire and enjoys an occasional puff of Old Toby.

[Ryanne]
Restlessly, Ryanne sits up in her tent, a hand rubbing at her brow before she thrusts upright, waving away her guards. Her guards stand up, but do not follow, not closely allowing Lady Bear some space as she shuffles out and then stretches, looking up into the night sky.

Her arms back, she massages her hips before she turns, nose up to sniff at the air.

A quick glance and the red gold glow reveals the source. A moment later, Lady Bear approaches the stranger, giving him a warm smile, ""That's some good smoke ye're burning, Morningson.""

[Morningson]
Smoke trailing from his nose like a flowing beard of cotton, the stranger smiles and says: ""Aye, it certainly is. My favourite."" His eyes turning from the fire to Lady Bear, he explains: ""It is a common curse of those who trade it; they cannot resist tasting their wares every now and then.""

Something about the man is very surprised; however, his voice is soft and polite as he greets the Lady, saying simply: ""Good evening to you, Lady Bear.""

[Ryanne]
""May I?"" Ryanne motions to the fire, ""I understand full well how that can be. My brother smokes enough of his own stock that he's his own best customer. I've oft wondered if this grass smoking would tan the insides of the body just like tanning darkens and dries the hide of beasts.""
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

[Morningson]
The man of the North shrugs lightly. ""Some old smokers cough,"" he says. ""But few, I know, would trade their pleasant habit just to get rid of a cough.""

""I was under the impression that people in Dunland do not smoke,"" he says and, with that, offers his pipe to the Lady.

Turning his eyes back to the fire, the man says frankly: ""I heard my companion had bothered you. I apologise.""

[Ryanne]
Ryanne bursts into laughter, tactfully softened the outburst after the first initial few notes, her hand waving away the offer, ""Nays, nays, I dinna smoke that though the smoke itself does good. There are some few who do use the pipe. Picking up foreigner habits or so me clanfolks 'plain to me sometimes. Ye must have seen Warren smoke?"" She drops to knees, feeding the fire a few more sticks before falling back, sitting boyishly, knees up and against her chest.

""Pleasant depends on who's being pleased, Morningson. Ehs? Who's bothering me?"" Lady Bear tilts surprised eyes at the stranger, her placid mien strangely shadowed in the night.

[Morningson]
The stranger shakes his head slowly. ""No,"" he says, ""Warren did not smoke even though I offered."" And he smiles in thought.

Glancing at the Lady, he holds council with himself for a fraction of a moment, and then, after a smoke-free breath, he explains: ""I thought I had perceived my friend Bert being nosy and overly curious around you, Lady. Asking too many questions, considering that your people are dealing with a treasure besides the troll.""

Nodding, he turns his eyes back towards the fire. ""We do not belong here,"" he says, ""for these are none of strangers' business. We are packed, and will be moving on before long. We do not wish to overstay our welcome, for you have been wonderfully hospitable.""

[Ryanne]
""Then he must have shown more restraint in his old age than his maturity!"" Ryanne retorts, her headshake one of disbelief, expelling a deep breath, ""Mayhaps I wrong Warren. The aged should be allowed their little pleasures before they're called back by Kiern."" 

Leaning her chin across her knee, Lady Bear's eyes gleam fire, reflecting the flames as she listens, ""Was he?"" She continues looking into the fire, ""Mayhaps. It takes two hands to clap and perhaps he asked too much, but I could be counted guilty as such. Seeing how I indulge in conversation with him as well. Ayes, I know ye both ain't Dunlendings, that ye be these mercenaries that Jarrett call 'rangers'. And Berrrt have brought meat to the pots when the supplies had not arrived."" She seems to feel a need to talk, her mood, one of restless changes of thought. ""Perhaps he reminds me of me Da...""

The northman does not say a word. Silence shrouds him, his eyes glinting in the shadows below his brows. He looks at Ryanne for a while. Yet her words go unconfirmed. And as her words trail off, they fade into the trustworthy bosom of a nightly darkness.

Eventually, the vagabond's eyes move along the Lady's crouched frame, measuring her long-boned legs until finally being focused on the fire again. He sucks in a long, patient breath of smoke, and opens his jaw to let the mist flow from between his lips like a dancer's veil far away from these lands.

""Have you made your peace with Captain Borumha?"" asks he, then. His voice is quiet and peaceful. As if nothing had been spoken by the Lady Bear.

[Ryanne]
Ryanne stiffens at the question, her eyes narrowing against the flames before slowly those gray round to examine Morningson, ""My peace, Morningson? With the captain? How do ye mean?""

The tall stranger leans backwards the slightest distance, indicating that no offense was meant. ""The other day, when Bert caught the bird for breakfast, Captain Borumha went silent, somewhat tense, when you arrived,"" he says. ""That was all. I wondered if you had had a disagreement. I meant not to indicate anything. I see I was mistaken.""

Ryanne remains silent, gray examining the stranger's tact before they slipped into the shadows, turning silver then black before she turns them back to the flames. The anonymity of the night cloaks the darkness, casting an air of confiding fraternity before she exhales deeply. Her voice is troubled, inwardly turned as she speaks, ""Ye're a perceptive man, Morningson. But somehow I expect no less from ye. Ye impresed my hard and that impressed me, when I was told of ye by Warren many moons ago.""

[Celbadar] 
Bard?

As though the word has power to summon, a gentle strain rises from near, within the camp -- the peaceful chords of a lullabye.

[Morningson] The stranger's pipe has run out by now, and he flips it upside down to drop the ashes into the fire. He has had enough, apparently, as he takes out the box he keeps his pipe in. Still he remains silent. A sudden humble vibration emanates from him, as he certainly finds no way to react to the Lady Bear's words.

Then, as a true friend, his companion lets his song be heard. A smile spreads across the vagabond's lips as he turns to look into the direction of the song. ""Bert is coming,"" he says in a tone of ease.

[Ryanne]
Perhaps she might had said more, the shadows seemingly gathering about her expression, one moon-faded to a pale silver. Ryanne parts her lips. A whisper of a sigh? The release of a troubled mind? The starting of a first word? Yet that would remain lost in the night as the music floats on the air.

Lady Bear's stiffness gentles, her chin sliding past so now her cheek rests on her knee. The darkness gathered within Ryanne flees, a smile playing on her lips at Morningson's declaration. Like a bell that is rung. She is amused. ""Ayes, yer Berrrt comes. And sweetly does he play. Like my da used to a long time ago.""

[Celbadar] 
Bert is coming.

Indeed.

It is not by footstep nor voice that his arrival is heralded, but my gentle melody. Even as it grows closer, it grows softer; and when his figure appears within the ring of firelight, he cants his head to Morningson -- and then to Ryanne, whom he addresses in soft, smooth tones: ""May I join your fire, Lady Bear?""

[Morningson] The younger of the two vagabonds only looks up at the elder, and nods a brief greeting. There is no place for greetings between the two, since for days they have been drifting more or less in each others' company.

Carefully, the man puts his pipe in the box and latches the lid.

[Ryanne]
The sun rises brightly off the snow covered tops of the Misty Mountains and Dunland Highlands.

Falling silently, Ryanne sits quietly, her eyes slitted as she listens, her breathing quietly, effortlessly rising and falling with the rhythm of the music. As it fades, her eyes flutter at being addressed and she does not look away from the fire, her left hand sweeping eloquently her pleasure to the older man's company. She tilts a glance at Morningson, watching him put away his pipe and breathes out, ""Tis a box specially fer the smokes?""

[Celbadar] 
Those few soft words are all, it seems, that Bert has in him tonight. He sits on the ground at the fire's side, his movements slow and studied, and stretches out one leg before him; the other, tucked beneath.

Seated and settled, he rests his harp on his knee and bends his head over it -- and the lullabye continues.

[Morningson] ""Pipes are fragile,"" the vagabond explains. ""I have snapped a couple when climbing or crouching. A box will keep this one unharmed."" He puts the box on his lap and looks at the bard. Closing his eyes, he listens to the music for a while.

Then, in time, he speaks to the musician: ""Are you packed, my friend? I believe our time to leave has come.""

[Ryanne]
""A good gift then."" Ryanne smiles, closing her eyes again as she lets the gentleness of the strummed tune sweep over her. She rests lightly, returning to her restful pose. ""Yer music lulls and soothes, Berrt."" A compliment delicately spoken before she referenced Morningson's words, ""I will miss yer playing and tales when ye both leave. Ye're like guests who know the second part of a tune I remembered only the first part one. I thank ye.""

[Celbadar] 
""So soon, Morningson?""

The words are spoken only after long silence, and they blend well with the music -- only by looking up, firelight catching eyes of grey, does Bert draw attention. But he tilts his head, acquiescent.

""And yours is a hearth a traveller loathes to depart, Lady Bear,"" he adds gently, the tune never faltering, silver notes rising to cradle the stars.

[Ryanne]
""Tis a hearth that's born of need and blood, Berrt. Would ye could have shared the true hospitality of clan's hearth though then truthfully could ye say that mine hearth would be one to be missed."" replies Ryanne, her command of Westron surer with the renewed exposure of both dwarves and human strangers, ""When would ye leave? And where would ye go?""

[Morningson] 
""Yes, Bert,"" replies the younger traveller. His voice is not demanding; it is the kind of a voice that one uses to ask for a mutual promise to be fulfilled.

A frown appears on Morningson's face. He is puzzled. He looks at the Lady for a brief moment. Then he looks at the box on his lap. Biting his lower lip for a second, he takes the box in his hand and slides it under Ryanne's knees.

""A gift from a lout,"" the man says with a smile.

[Celbadar] 
The player bows his head once more to Ryanne's words, and when he raises it, a smile graces his features. ""Then someday, 'ere I grow too old, I hope to share a true clan's hearth.""

Still, the music continues, flows, settles on the midnight breeze.

And Ryanne's questions? They go unanswered by Bert, though his eyes flicker to Morningson -- letting him lead and reply.

[Ryanne]
Ryanne straightens as she asks her questions, her gentleness fading as she resumes her formality, her position wrapping her in its cloak of cool composure and control. Yet it stays its hand, cracking briefly as a raven brow forms a high arc as she looks down at Morningson's box, puzzled. ""Morningson?"" Understanding floods in a moment later.

Lady Bear leans down, sliding the box out and then holding it back to the younger man. Her smile is contrite yet bright, ""Achs, nays, my words weren't a bid fer a gift from ye. My careless command of this strange tongue. Tis that seeing it has given me some means to reward those of my clan with the same item.""

[Morningson]
""I am ready to depart before dawn,"" says the young stranger, ""but any time tomorrow is as good."" Looking at Bert, he suggests: ""Perhaps we could drop by at Kierkegard before moving on? We still have to decide where to go.""

And he smiles at the Lady Bear again. He seems to be thinking of something to reply regarding the pipe, but he eventually gives up, saying nothing. He turns back to look at the fire and scratches his upper lip absently with his thumb.

[Celbadar] 
""Wouldn't mind that,"" agrees Bert softly, bending his head once more over his harp as he shifts to a deeper, more mournful tune. ""We'll go at dawn. Though I owe a song before we leave.""

And with that he falls silent -- a stubborn silence -- and does not emerge from it until the melody is finished.

[Ryanne]
""Morningson?"" The lilt questioning as Ryanne's hand remains outstretched, holding the box before she blushes, looking young and girlish as she pull her hand back. Laughter springs alive in both eyes and lips, ""Achs but I was forcing ye to accept a gift back after ye've gifted it."" She shakes her head, pauses and then drops the box into her lap, reaching behind her neck to untie the pendants that nestle against her throat. 

On her palm rests worn leather strips of bear-red and stag-blue with a bright forest wulf-green are braided together. Three pendants arranged between five bear teeth are threaded onto the make-shift necklace. The first is a bone carving of a sleeping bear caught in the act of stretching. The second is a smooth cylinder and the third, a thumbsized carving of a stag's head.

[Morningson]
The look on the northman's face is nearly frightened, for so surprised is he. It is now his turn to lift his arms and spread his finger in a vain, confused reaction of modesty. But he is caught in his own trap, and so he sighs, and so he swallows, and so he extends his palm to receive the gift.

""Thank you, Lady Bear,"" he says quietly.

[Ryanne]
Ryanne's gray eyes is solemn, as she lays the braided leather over the man's palm. Her attention fully on Morningson despite the lovely tune that Bert plays. The fourth pendant of a bird is clutched in her other hand, against her chest while she nods towards the first three that rests in the northman's. ""Tis a poor gift in exchange but those were made by mine own hands. When I was a simple crafter. Each represents one of the three clans that rules Dunland and my hopes that one day, my people would be one again.""

[Morningson]
The stranger withdraws his hand now, the fingers still spread wide, and looks at the Lady's gift with a distant, dreamy gaze in his eyes. ""It is a beautiful gift,"" he says. ""I will treasure it."" He brings his other hand up to the palm and touches the pendants with the tip of his finger. He examines the braided leather in silence. A comfortable silence.

[Ryanne]
Ryanne watches, her fingers playing with the remaining pendant in her hand, ""The colours of the strips are the colours of the clans. Red is mine, green fer the Wulfs and blue fer the Stags."" Briefly she explained before she closes her eyes, enjoying both the comfortable silence and music that all too soon ends.

Heaving a sigh so deep that it rattles in her throat, Lady Bear's face seems wistful and sad. But just as the music ended, so does that moment. She picks up Morningson's box from her lap, her chieftain role recloaking her as she stands. Graciously in formality, Ryanne offers her farewells, ""T'was Kiern who brought ye here and only He will know if we will all meet again but good winds guide yer travels.""

[Morningson]
""It has been an honour, Lady Bear,"" replies the vagabond quite awkwardly. He slowly lifts himself up to his feet, careful not to squeeze the braid in his hand. He looks at the tall Lady in the eye and says: ""May your God care for your people in the coming battle.""

Then, less gravely but still quite honestly, he concludes: ""We will meet again in time. I will be looking for news of your expedition. The next time I pass by Dunland, I will be sure to look up your clansmen.""

[Ryanne]
Ryanne offers a faint smile, ""My clan and family would recognise those pendants and fer love of me, offer ye some safe passage through Bear lands through to Kierkgard Dun."" With that last, she offers Bert a warm smile, a nod and swiftly heads back to her tent.

"event","Cinnamon, cloves and honey. The crisp tang of mulled apples overlays that of wine and rich viands served in the Mar Vanwa Tyalieva as steam mists from a large pot brews in the centre of the talan. A small gathering of edhel, some dressed plain, others more richly lounge on seats as the keeper of the place arranges the benches around the room. The forester, eyes gray and remote sips at his mug of the apple cider as Oretaurnas waits. For what is unclear as soon, eyes turn to the black-haired ellon and he steps forward to the clear space, clearing his throat.

A little breathily, the forester looks about him, lifts his mug and with his eyes manages to call some quiet with a second clearing of his throat, ""Mellyn, we are gathered here today to share our memories of our kin from within and without Lothlorien in order that we may drink and pay proper respect to their memories and their deeds. Tis said we cannot choose our family and kin but that we can choose our friends."" Oretaurnas pauses, looks about him solemnly, ""Would anyone have a tale to share?""

The mulled cider is a rich brown-gold as Bellaegis ladles some into his mug. He looks up as Orentaurnas steps to the center of the talan. Eyes attentive on the forester, Bellaegis slips to one side and works his way back to a seat at the edge of the space formed by the benches, steaming mug held before him.

Hushed whispers fall softly upon the air from one side of the Mar, where two ellith sit, both clad in gowns of green. One elleth speaks something softly into the ear of the other, Aluirwen, who smiles with whatever this quiet message is. Perhaps it would seem that Aluirwen would whisper something in return but for the words of Oretaurnas that catch her attention, brightening her eyes.

""Ah, but I have a tale, mellon,"" she calls, lilting words just loud enough to be heard. ""But... Does our host not have a tale he wishes to recount?"" So continues Aluirwen as she smiles toward Oretaurnas. ""...Perhaps to initiate us all in the ways of story-telling?""
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

Eyes shifting and with some adroit adjustments, space is made for those who continues to enter. Three bodies away from where Bellaegis sits, another ellon seconds what the alluring green-clad Aluirwen suggests, ""Yes, Oretaurnas! You often whiled our labours in the woods with stories that your grandfather tells you, give us one friendships that the elves hold dear.""

The forester rubs his nose, his mug against his chest and after a side glance at his friend in the audience, nods, ""Tis fair enough. I'd start the tale. It's a different story.. one about ... humans.""

The pot of mulled apple cider sits fragrant in the centre of the talan, the steam raising upwards through the branches of the tree where the afternoon sun shines golden through, making shadows that dance within.

""If you start a tale, I pray you finish it as well,"" chimes in Aluirwen from her seated place, a trace of laughter upon her words. Though, at mention of the story's subject, she seems rather surprised, blinking thrice at the forester.

""Ah, but Chance Is Always Powerful,"" breathes her companion at her side, as she looks toward Aluirwen. ""And it is indeed a strange chance that the first tale be of friendship and the Secondborn.""

""Ah, indeed,"" agrees Aluirwen, nodding slowly. ""But let us hear his tale, at the least.""

The ellon who had seconded Oretaurnas's storytelling raises a brow, ""About humans, Oretaurnas? Why.."" The forester shushes his friend and continues with his tale, ""I am not sure who told this tale to my grandfather or if it is a true one. But I always remember this story because WHEN THE CHARACTER OF A PERSON IS NOT CLEAR TO YOU, you could LOOK AT HIS FRIENDS to judge his quality. Tis a tale about a human who loved the sea. He was a prince of Numenor, the island kingdom raised from the sea by the Valar as a gift and reward to the Men who had remained faithful through the dark years of the First Age."" The forester gestures with his mug, the golden rays of the afternoon sun haloing about his raven head as he nods vaguely westwards, ""He was called ""The Mariner"", and his name signifies ""of the trees"" because he was a noted tree steward and forester.""

Bellaegis has watched the exchange quietly, his mug half-raised, his face half-smiling. He turns full attention now to Oretaurnas as the forester starts into his tale.

""Among some,"" comes another voice, crisp and clear in marked tone even amongst such company as this. ""Friendship with the second-born is a necessity, for we find in them an ally against a common foe, even as others would freeze what small corner of the world they may. Speak on, storyteller,"" he encourages, standing amongst a small retinue of his own folk, crowned with a ring of woodland flowers

Bellaegis turns his head, hearing the voice. He rises from his seat to bow.

To the Elven King's right, and slightly behind, a stately dressed elleth, conspicuously lacking her left hand sits in quiet repose. Aewidhrin's face is turned to the story teller with catlike intensity and attentiveness, though she gives but a subtle nod to her Lord's assertion. As ever, the lackhanded councillor remains boldly stoic and reserved, expressionless and silent.

The story is introduced, and Aluirwen seems to settle in for its duration, smoothing her skirts across her lap. ""Such information he recites,"" she says quietly to her companion. ""I do hope he truly understands what he speaks, though, for LEARNING WITHOUT THOUGHT IS merely LABOR LOST...""

The crisp speech from another demands her attentions, however, and though perhaps the unsettled look upon her mien speaks to her discontent at his words, her lips form no further words for now, grey-coloured eyes turning back toward Oretaurnas, awaiting more of the tale.

The Woodland King, far though he is from his realm, accepts the bow with a wan smile, and a nod only slightly less subtle than that of the elf to his side. His words heard, the King to the Nandor of Mirkwood is seated once again.

Oretaurnas twists his head at the unexpected interjection, eyes searching and finding the small band and he flourishes a bow to the speaker, resuming his telling, ""Necessity or choice, tis hard to say but indeed in this case, there was a friendship well made. This same human, this 'Mariner' who loved the sea, came to learn the craft of ships and there met formed a bond with the last High King who led the Noldor, Gil-galad. Tis from this bond that helped repulse an onslaught by the Dark One through much of the Second Age.""

Moving his arms apart, the OIL OF REFINED POLITENESS in his manners as he slants a glance at Aluirwen as if he had overheard what the ellon had said, ""There my tale is done. The strength of one friendship though it may not last could work much good.""

""But that friendship does last, Forester"" Bellaegis calls quietly from his seat. ""Surely, do we not see the token of that friendship even now?"" He points toward the western horizon, where a single, bright star shines.

As if he had timed it consciously, Oretaurnas's tale ends as the sun slides behind the horizon. The star that Bellaegis points to glitters sharp and bright and the forester slowly nods in agreement, his own gaze following the direction of the Imladhrim's arm, ""You speak true, Bellaegis. Sometimes when we forget in our daily pursuit of living to remember. Though LEARNING IS NOT COMPULSORY. NEITHER IS SURVIVAL. Yet we need to learn and continue to learn to survive.""

A quick jerk of his head and the forester smiles, ""Who would tell the next tale?"" He sidesteps to the centre, where pot filled brewed apple cider simmers.

A quick jerk of his head and the forester smiles, ""Who would tell the next tale?"" He sidesteps to the centre, where pot filled brewed apple cider simmers.

""A short tale,"" comments the companion of Aluirwen. ""But a true one,"" returns Aluirwen, perhaps a lingering sigh upon the words, a sigh perhaps admitting some ill done. ""And... I suppose one should not TREAT HIS FRIEND AS IF HE MIGHT BECOME AN ENEMY, when he speaks of the Secondborn.""

But, as Oretaurnas calls for the next tale, Aluirwen is reanimated in her motions, and she stands from where she sits, a flourish of green skirts her only accompaniment. ""I will tell the next tale, if our host finds it suitable.""

Aewidhrin listens to this exchange, ""I have a story to share, of an unlikely friendship amoung the firstborn and second born."" The councillor offers, her gaze turning to Thranduil, ""By your leave, my Lord.""

""Ah, but if there is another tale of friendship between Firstborn and Secondborn,"" continues Aluirwen, ""let it be told first.""

Thranduil nods, beckoning his councillor to rise. ""I too would hear your tale, Aewidhrin; if our host would yield for you to tell it."" He smiles, turning in his seat to regard the handless elf.

Aewidhrin turns her gaze to Aluriwen, bowing her head with glimmer of a smile tugging at the corners of her lips. ""I will try to keep it brief then. I will tell of the bandits in Dale, though I will forewarn my audience,"" she says as she begins to rise from her seated position, ""This will not have its roots in deep history. Look not for any lingering symbolism at the end!""

Slipping in quietly amongst the numbers gathered here, Elingail joins those sat around listening to the forth coming tales. 
 
Small white flowers have been carefully twined into her raven tresses like stars scattered across the night sky and her flowing green skirts kiss the ground as she walks. 

The forester's gray eyes flit between the two ellon who speaks up almost simultaneously and hesitates uncertainly. A good tactic as during his brief moment of hesitation, Aluirwen graciously accords the floor to the second, ""But of course, the Golden Woods has started off with the first telling and who better to follow that that of cousins from the other wood? Please."" He yields ground, moving to the side and leans against the bole that runs through the platform.

This news brings a strange look to the face of the king, his brows raised in silent question, though he remains mute at the start of this tale.

On the heels of the Imladhirm healer, comes another from the valley. Broad shouldered, clothed in jerkin and leggins of midnight blue. It is Elrond's eldest son. He slips quietly in among the crowd, as a cat slips sinuously between the flowers of a garden. He takes a place beside Bellaegis and nods greeting to the hunter, folds his legs under himself, and fixes his silver eyes upon the speaker.

Bellaegis inclines his head as Elladan approaches and scoots over on the bench to give room. His eyes remain on Aewidhrin as well, though a smile tugs at the corner of his lip.

""It was a pleasant day, as I recall, midsummer, when I was sent on a diplomatic errand to Esgaroth. With me, my husband, Bronwe, and it was our intention to address the grievances that had so earlier disturbed our wood when one of the Tauredhrim were attacked without provacation by a man of Brand's people. It was our misfortune, to come upon a caravan of Naugrim."" and this word is met with only the faintest of sneers fromt he councillor as she nearly spits it out. ""Through their noisey and bothersome distraction, bandits fell upon us both. And were not all this troublesome enough, but I found myself overwhelmed and struck hard, trussed and slung in a sack like so much chattel!""

Elladan raises a brow at the final words, and leans forward, rests his elbows on his knees. The whole of him speaks of curiosity, and intent listening.

As it is surely decided that Aewidhrin will tell the next tale, Aluirwen seats herself once more, smoothing her skirts as she does so. As the story begins, the lorekeeper quirks an eyebrow at the subject; and perhaps at the content she seems surprised, her grey eyes wide. At the least, this surprise is accompanied by a touch of curiosity... of what might happen next in the tale?

The indignation rings true in the lackhanded elleth's voice as she continues, her eyes bright as she retells this, ""And what low place they would find to deposit me, but a rat infested hole in the ground, what I surmise must be a cellar."" She sniffs, ""A base fate for a diplomat. However, I was not alone, in the cellar. Bound with me was a man of the village, and one of whom I'd seen before.""

The King's smile fades at the turn of the story, but it does not vanish. His lips part, though he does not interject, even now. He turns instead from the storyteller, his wan smile is warmed, as he offers it along with a nod of acknowledgement to Elladan.

The shift of the Aran's attention is both seen and felt by the Herion, and Elladan eye's meet Thranduil's. He offers the King a broad, easy grin and nods deeply, warm respect at play with merriment in his gaze.

While Aewidhrin's anger crisps her words, she remains calm through the telling, ""What barbs he slung at me staled the air, and certainly made for an unpleasant cell companion."" At this point, Aewidhrin's tone turns lofty, abd one may easily imagine that the barbs certainly went both ways. To this, however, the councillor makes no mention. ""It was by careful reasoning with the man, that I convinced him it was in our best interest to set aside our grievances, even though his towards my people were greater, and see to our escape. A previous injury, as it were, gave me the benefit that knots at the wrist were easily be overcome.""

This last observation, brings a mild chuckle, if a rueful one from the King of Mirkwood, his attention once again is turned towards the telling of the tale.

Leaning forwards, Elbows upon knees, chin upon hands, smiles and acknowledgments float past Elingail unnoted, for she is intent upon the story told and of course her teller. 

""That's one trick I would like to learn, Lady."" The comment comes somewhere from the left of the audience, the voice slightly impish. Several around the speaker hushes the young ellon who retreats into a blushing silence.

Oretaurnas speaks up over the sudden surge of whispering, ""And both of you are now friends?"" His interest clear in his question.

Aewidhrin hesitates now as she continues, ""Great was our efforts to escape, and each one foiled. Little food was brought, and little water. Our hope began to wan as they moved as at night, and by the sounds of it further from the village. What ransome they hoped for, I do not know..."" A troubled frown passes the elf's lips as she recollects, and pauses in the retelling. A glance turned towards Thranduil. ""It was resolved, by bravery on my kin's part. The Feredir, and my Liege were there, as well as Lord Gelbard's people in their efforts."" 
 
Her frown deepens for a moment, adding quickly, and almost under her breath. ""And the Naugrim might have beent here too."" Stress on the might, and little stress given to the Naugrim at all. 
 
""But yes, the time we had, and the courage I lent him and hope he lent me, we are now forever bound by the incident. What grievances we had, forgotten, solidifying our people once more.""

Though Bellaegis's eyes and face give full attention to Aewidhrin, he nevertheless reaches, without looking, and sets his mug down on the table at his right hand. That hand snakes under his cloak and then withdraws, holding half-palmed a small flask of plain silver wrapped in a tooled leather sheath. He leans forward with his elbows on his knees as well, arms crossed, an image of attentive listening...

... and, very lightly, taps the corner of the flask twice against Elladan's right elbow.

The King rises, at this, the end of Aewidhrin's tale. ""Indeed, there again was a great friendship reignitied,"" he says, ""That began when Bard the Bowman slew a great scourge that had long held over his land. Once again, the carelessness and greed of the Naugrim brought darkness over those lands, only to be foiled by both Elf and Man, as we sought out the foul brigands across the lands that lay between the Greenwood and the Long Lake.""

Elladan smiles softly to himself as Aewidhrin delcares the friendship born by the adversity in her tale. 

And then... a tap on the knee, Elladan looks down and the smile grows to a broad grin. ""Tis a good tale,"" he says, as his wide hand wraps around the silver flask. ""For when friendships among individuals grow broader and create fellowships... tis a blessing for all."" 

And the flask is slipped quietly into his pocket, with a small, barely noticeable wink to the hunter. ""My thanks,"" he mutters to the Arferedir.

The proud councillor bows her head once more as Thranduil begins to speak, taking a respectful step backwards to offer him the floor with but a bare rustling of her robes. Her cheeks have been quite flushed by her heated retelling of the story. ""It was for the better, in the end for both of our peoples. Even after all that, the Naugrim had naught but trouble in their stony hearts and vitriol to spew. Would you believe they fancied that I had made the Bandits attack their wagon? It was well that Gelbard spoke for my integrity, though he need not have.""

Bellaegis gives a deep nod at the end of the story, though its direction might be taken both ways, and murmurs, ""Well told.""

Lights are quietly brought out to push back the evening shroud as retelling of tales proceeds. Their soft glow cast over those gathered at benches placed around the space where Aewdhrin stands, her story just completed. 

""Another fair tale of a fair pairing, Lady. Well said, Lord, said."" Oretaurnas takes a step back to the centre of the stage, addressing both Ndaedeldhrim, ""Adversity does bring the worst and the best. True friendships are hard to make, and harder to maintain. FRIENDS MAY COME AND GO, BUT ENEMIES ACCUMULATE. There is mulled cider for those who desires it, the keeper has decided to only serve that this evening given. Aluirwen? Would you now tell your tale?""

One of the Dunedain enters the flet upon the ladder just as Oretaurnas speaks her platitude. She nods to that worthy, then slips along the edge of the crowded room to an empty place at the back, near to an open screen so that the sky stretches out over the treetops behind her. 
 
Cider curls her nose, however. If the elves have their own flasks, so does the Kildeer; Saidonnen slips one from some hidden pocket of her elven gown, and holds it unashamed in her hand against some unforeseen need. 

The King yields his own place upon the floor, sinking down to be seated once again. He murmurs to Aewidhrin, ""A tale well chosen indeed,"" a look passing from King to Councillor, and with it a smile, before his gaze seeks out the next tale-teller.

If anything, Aluirwen seems surprised and perplexed by this tale of Aewidhrin. So perplexed, in fact, that it seems she as yet has no words to offer, no query of her own to add. But, perhaps all this is relieved as Oretaurnas calls upon her, and, indeed, the lorekeeper stands to her feet and approaches the open area.

""I would tell my tale, mellon. And yet, I will not speak of the Secondborn, but of a friendship... of a love which, by NECESSITY, HAS NO LAW."" Perhaps here the voice of Aluirwen halts, perhaps abruptly, grey eyes following the entrance of Saidonnen. But, soon enough, the elleth looks to begin her tale.


Bellaegis reaches and retrieves his mug of cider, then sits back, eyes on Aluirwen as he takes a sip.

Aewidhrin concedes the floor to Aluirwen, moving towards the service where the mulled cider has been set for the guests. A cup for herself and one for the Woodland King procured, balanced expertly in her right hand, the lackhanded councillor returns to her seat at the King's right. 
 
Extending the drink to him, she nods, ""Thank you, my Lord. I thought it was appropriate."" Turning her attention to Aluirwen, she lifts her drink to her lips.

His gray eyes slip to his Galadhrim kin who had yielded to the second story teller, crooking a finger to the green-clad finger Dinlom, ""Unless our kin from Rivendell has a tale to share as well. Both Lothlorien and those from the Mirkwood had their turn..."" Oretaurnas starts to say when Aluirwen seems speechless. He grins when the ellon regains her composure and he gives way. The arrival of the latecomer is noticed and the forester nudges one of those holding a tray, towards the human.

Aluirwen perhaps seems a bit uneasy as she begins, but the fluidity of her words is little affected. Her tale is told not quite in the same manner as the previous two, but rather more like a song than a story: melodic words that lilt almost as if a little chant.

""An elleth young and fair and tall there was supposed to be:
Hair of black and eye of blue like summer sky had she.
Love had she for bole and leaf, for stars and for the night,
For sunlight warm and shade so fair, for birds that take to flight.
But dancing loved she most of all, and there within the wood,
She danced and spun and twirled about, as much as she possibly could.""

Elladan accepts a mug of cider. But he also pulls the silver flask from his pocket. He uncorks it, snifs... contains a laugh, and takes, instead, the mug of cider. ""We may yet, Oretau-"" but he stops himself as Aluirwen begins her tale. 

Quietly, barely above a whisper, he says to Bellaegis... ""Where in the name of the Valar did you find this?"" and his eyes indicate the flask.

Bellaegis lowers his mug and, crossing his arms over his chest, holds it at his left side. His head is cocked and his eyes on Aluirwen, but he murmurs (barely loud enough to be heard by those on either side) ""From one of the Men here from our side of the Mountains. Traded him a dozen and four brace of arrows for it.""

""The night-winds whispered tales to her, accompanied her dance,
And one such night in starlight clear, something caught her glance:
A tiny flower wild-growing beneath an arbor tall,
With petals of the purest white; the elleth was enthralled.
She kneeled before the flower white and gazed upon it long,
She smiled and she named it ""friend"" and sang to it a song.""

There is joy in the fluid, sing-song words of Aluirwen, as the elleth described in the tale finds her friendship.

Thranduil's gaze remains, resting peacefully upon his face. ""Indeed it was,"" he murmurs, his smile broadening once more, as he accepts the proferred cup, ""A fine tale indeed, and were I the judge, its instruction would bear a great prize.""

Elladan's merry gaze rests firmly upon the elleth, the whole of him apparently intent upon her tale. But his low spoken words, etched with fine humor, are for the hunter beside him. ""A brace of arrows for this? By the smell of it, mellon, you fared the worse in that trade.""

Saidonnen appears to listen attentively, but the scent rising from Elladan's flask draws her swift and sharp gaze in that direction. She looks, if it can be believed, all but appalled! 
 
But the flask is corked up again, and she returns her attention to the storyteller. Quietly she uncaps her own flask, and the scent of it, while sharp, is not unpleasant. She adds a generous dollop into her cider, and tucks the flask away. 

""Every eve when night would fall, the elleth would appear,
And watch the starlight dance upon those petals white and dear.
Those days of visit turned to weeks and then to seasons chill,
And one even when the elleth came, she found a striking ill.
The wind brushed by, its icy fingers causing her to hurt;
And naught was left of flower-friend but petals in the dirt.""

As the story recounts this sorrowed moment for the elleth in the tale, the tone of the voice of Aluirwen changes as well, a sad colour to her words.

Aewidhrin nods to the king and smiles, but she gives the elleth telling the story her full attention. Letting the cup rest lightly upon her knee, her face turned to the story teller.

Adroitly, Oretaurnas weaves along the back while keeping an eye on the tray-bearer who approaches Saidonnen as he silently makes his way towards the son of Elrond, his head lowering as he approaches the Imladhrim, his voice evenly low as he says, ""Lord, you said something? I did not catch ..."" He coughs, eyes moving left and right of the Herion, sniffing suspiciously before coughing again.

Elladan leans back to better speak with Oretaurnas, his toros at an odd angle to the bench. ""Yes, friend,"" he whispers. ""I may have a tale to tell, if you've time and room among the lists...""

Perhaps Aluirwen would better notice the bit of activity surrounding the son of Elrond, were she not so wrapped in her storytelling. Her voice softens, the words growing more quiet, more filled with a sadness as the tale of the elleth and her flower-friend continues.

""The elleth wept, her tears shone brightly in the starlight clear;
She wondered why she ought to have to lose a friend so dear.
All through the winter's months she danced beneath that arbor tall,
Hoping that her flower-friend would answer to her call.
Though she sought and though she called, naught she found 'neath star:
The starlight 'gainst the petals white was but a mem'ry far.""

Bellaegis frowns faintly, raising his mug to hide his lips. He says nothing, though, and his eyes stay fixed on Aluirwen as he takes a sip.

At first the story continues in words yet spoken quietly, but then the voice of Aluirwen grows in hope and in anticipation, telling finally the joyful conclusion of the tale.

""The chilly breezes finally left, and warmth had come again,
The green returned, the skies were blue, a breeze rushed now and then,
The elleth danced as e'er she had done, came near to that tall tree,
And looking there, her eyes alight, what then did she see?
A tiny flower, hale and white, was where the other had been!
She danced for joy, she sang anew: 'My friend has come again!'""

The King's gaze as well remains upon this new storyteller, as the verse continues on.

Saidonnen drinks deeply of her doctored cider. But she is attentive still, and there is no unkindness upon her face. She nods once in response, and crosses her legs. 

A swift smile at Elrond's son's request, a short nod though Oretaurnas glances sharply at one of the elves to Elladan's left. That elf grimaces at Oretaurnas and the forester eyes that ellon fiercely, hissing ""Drink if you must but outside, mellon. Would you have the keeper of Mars Van Tyalieva serve you naught but tea for the rest of the year?""

"event","Hmphing at his target's look of injuried innocence, the forester resumes his conversation, ""I will place your name. I am sure it will be a tale worthy of notice, Lord."" He straightens, a last remonstrating look for those around before refocusing his attention on Aluirwen. In time for the conclusion and with swift alacrity, the forester praises, ""To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides. Well told, Aluirwen, well told. Are there any others who would add their tales of friendship?""

""I have a tale to tell,"" offers Saidonnen, raising her cider cup. 

Elladan's gaze drifts to the Ranger. With a wry, sidewise grin he lifts his flask to her - a small movement, noticeable, perhaps, to few. 

Still grinning, Elladan offers a nod to Oretaurnas, and returns his gaze to the tale teller.

Bellaegis nods and smiles broadly as the story completes, lifting his mug in toast.

Expectantly, the Galadhrim forester waits for Elladan to speak up though when the human offers, there is no hint of that faint hesitation before Oretaurnas sweeps his arm, inviting the Dunedain to take the spotlight, ""Of course, a tale."" There is a restlessness among some of those seated, an exchange of eyes and subtle jostling though none speaks up against. There is a polite smile on Oretaurnas's lips.
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

Having finishing her tale, the lorekeeper gives a brief curtsey toward Oretaurnas for his praise. To her place Aluirwen then retreats, her path marked with swift steps and a flourish of green skirts. After seating herself, she, perhaps absently, smooths her skirts, eyes of grey surveying the gathered, lingering longer upon some, then warily regarding Saidonnen as she speaks.

Elladan lifts his mug of cider. ""Here here,"" he calls encouragingly, smiling toward the Kildeer. ""A tale from the North!""

Saidonnen pauses only long enough to drain the last draught of cider from the cup, then rises to move toward the front. As she passes Thranduil, something drops at his feet--her pocket was not secure, and here is a gift for the King of Mirkwood! 
 
She notes it not, and turns smoothly to face the assembly. ""Aye, a tale, but not of the North,"" she says in accented Sindarin. ""Rather, I carried it with me out of Gondor, acquired from one of their excellent tomes."" 
 
Without further explanation, and no moral forthcoming, she moves straight into her tale: 
 
Beneath an old wall, that went round an old castle, 
For many a year, with brown ivy o'erspread, 
A neat little hovel, its lowly roof raising, 
Defied the wild winds that howl'd over its shed 
The turrets, that frown'd on the poor simple dwelling, 
Were rock'd to and fro, when the tempest would roar, 
And the river, that down the rich valley was swelling, 
Flow'd swiftly beside the green step of its door. 
 
The summer sun gilded the rushy roof slanting, 
The bright dews bespangled its ivy-bound hedge, 
And above, on the ramparts, the sweet birds were chanting, 
And wild buds thick dappled the clear river's edge. 
When the castle's rich chambers were haunted and dreary, 
The poor little hovel was still and secure; 
And no robber e'er enter'd, nor goblin nor fairy, 
For the splendors of pride had no charms to allure. 
Golfin climbs up the ladder from the terrace below.
Golfin has arrived.
[Saidonnen(#15784)]  
The Kildeer, hands clasped before her in the manner of an orator, continues: 
The Lord of the castle, a proud surly ruler, 
Oft heard the low dwelling with sweet music ring, 
For the old Dame that liv'd in the little hut cheerly, 
Would sit at her wheel, and would merrily sing: 
When with revels the castle's great hall was resounding, 
The old Dame was sleeping, not dreaming of fear; 
And when over the mountains the huntsmen were bounding 
She would open her lattice, their clamors to hear. 
 
To the merry-ton'd horn she would dance on the threshold, 
And louder, and louder, repeat her old song: 
And when winter its mantle of frost was displaying, 
She caroll'd, undaunted, the bare woods among. 
She would gather dry fern, ever happy and singing, 
With her cake of brown bread, and her jug of brown beer, 
And would smile when she heard the great castle-bell ringing, 
Inviting the proud--to their prodigal cheer. 

And more from Saidonnen, unabated: 
Thus she liv'd, ever patient and ever contented, 
Till envy the Lord of the castle possess'd, 
For he hated that poverty should be so cheerful, 
While care could the fav'rites of fortune molest; 
He sent his bold yeoman with threats to prevent her, 
And still would she carol her proud roundelay; 
At last, an old steward relentless he sent her--
Who bore her, all trembling, to dungeon away! 
 
Three weeks did she languish, then died broken-hearted, 
Poor Dame! how the death-bell did mournfully sound! 
And along the green path six young bachelors bore her, 
And laid her for ever beneath the cold ground! 
And the primroses pale 'mid the long grass were growing, 
The bright dews of twilight bespangled her grave, 
And morn heard the breezes of summer soft blowing 
To bid the fresh flow'rets in sympathy wave. 

Then, finally: 
The Lord of the castle, from that fatal moment 
When poor singing Lorwen was laid in her grave, 
Each night was surrounded by screech-owls appalling, 
Which o'er the black turrets their pinions would wave! 
On the ramparts that frown'd on the river, swift flowing, 
They hover'd, still hooting a terrible song, 
When his windows would rattle, the winter blast blowing, 
They would shriek like a ghost, the dark alleys among! 
 
Wherever he wander'd they follow'd him crying, 
At dawnlight, at eve, still they haunted his way! 
When the moon shone across the wide common they hooted, 
Nor quitted his path till the blazing of day. 
His bones began wasting, his flesh was decaying, 
And he hung his proud head, and he perish'd with shame; 
And the tomb of rich marble, no soft tear displaying, 
O'ershadows the grave of the Poor Singing Dame! 
 
Saidonnen bows from the waist, then moves promptly back to her chair. 

Golfin comes up the ladder. He was caught up in finishing a piece of jewerly and thus he is late. He stops and politely listens to the poet and when she is done he claps politely and moves to find a place to sit near the back of the gathering.

Bellaegis sets his mug on the table and claps as Saidonnen bows. He leans back, though, and murmurs faintly to Elladan alone, lips barely moving, ""I am sorry, Herion, I thought it all had such a smell....""

Aewidhrin's nose visibly wrinkles for a moment, as if only now she is catching a whiff of what is coming from Elladan's flask. A unmistakable scowl of repulsion briefly makes an appearance as she turns to regard what Elrond's son holds in question.

Elladan too applauds, his gaze thoughtful upon the Ranger. To Bellaegis, he offers a quiet nod. ""Tis rather like the smell of new scat... mixed with bad whiskey. I think I shall offer it to the ground beyond the hallowed woods of Lorien. If the ground will take it.""

In a louder voice, the Herion address the Kildeer. ""The men of Gondor,"" he says, ""write songs of worth and weight. Well sung, mellon.""

Golfin is just comming into the area himself. He moves twords a place to sit at the back of the fathering.

""With that, I would concur,"" Aewidhrin mumbles, glancing to Thranduil now as she rises from the bench. ""I think it is time that I depart and see to the others. I've not heard tale of Devora in some days.""

The Woodland king retrieves the flask from the floor, for it has come to rest squarely beneath his feet. Turning it over in his hands, the King opens the small flask, to pour into his own cup, with a swift gaze from the human speaker, to the half-elven lord. Noting his Councillor's look of distaste, he lets the flask pass into the folds of his cloak, as he raises his cup in salute. ""Fitting,"" he says, rising to his feet, ""That a tale be shared by one of the secondborn, when two have been told of friendships forged therewith. A fitting end, if it were, for I too must retire."" He glances back to Aewidhrin, and then to Elladan, as he begins towards the ladder, his final words directed to Elladan, ""Perhaps when all the tales are told, you might join me, to tell me of these last tales.""

Oretaurnas's gray eyes is widened, stunned by the tale told by the Dunedain, his silence stark before he ventures, ""It's friendship indeed, .... mellon. Such friendship that would wreck such wild justice as just revenge and dark retribution."" The forester exhales, swallows and then looks towards Elladan, ""Would there be others. Perhaps our kin from Rivendell would have a brighter tale to share? Lord?""

""They have much time to ponder such matters, my Lord,"" Saidonnen answers Elladan. ""It is well known the relationship 'twixt Lord and peasant there, and such tales serve to remind them of the consequences when that is defiled. They are possessed of a steadfast nobility there, for all it is much besieged."" 
 
She rises to bow to Thranduil, then watches her flask travelling away. ""You may count on it, my Lord,"" she says to his invitation. 

Elladan raises a hand languidly. ""I've a tale, though of what worth I cannot tell.""

The cider pot boils low again and more spices are added. Benches are arranged around the centre, lights bright as the evening presses on. Saidonnen has just left centre space, her tale done while Oretaurnas looked towards the Rivendell contingent to share a tale, the others having had their turn.

There is a rustling in the back as two figures enter in the room. Elnara enters first and waits at the door. She wears a blue and silver gown, the sleeves reaching the ground, and wears a grey cloak of the Galadrim. She glances back, looking to see if her companion had made it up alright. ""Forgive our lateness, mellyn. We too, have a tale to tell."" She sits in the back so as not to interrupt Elladan's story.

As folk come in and folk leave, Saidonnen takes the opportunity to sidle along the edges of the gathering and place herself near to Bellaegis, behind Elladan's newly abandoned chair. ""Why are they not allowing spirits to be served?"" she murmurs to Bellaegis. ""I have known them to serve a very fine ale in other days. It seems cruel to force this hot apple mash on us, when the day is so fine and the work so thirsty..."" 

Elladan uncoils from his seat, stands at his place a moment as Elnara and a Galadhirm unknown to him enter the room. A nod and a grin are offered both. And then with his wide hands wraped around his steaming mug of cider, he begins.

""This is a story that may or may not be true. There is argument among its principle players as to its veracity. For in all truth it happened so long ago, and at such a green and early age for the tale's main characters, that memory may indeed play false for each."" 

Elladan pauses, his feline gaze slips swift and light from one upturned face to another. A slow grin pulls bright light into his eyes. ""But I, for one, believe it.""

Curulomion strides in...late as usual, but unsually not clad in sable. While his tunic and undertunic are still of that shade he wears a new robe of rich sapphire, edged in silver and with a tasteful design of scrolls and leaves embroidered on it in silver. He moves quickly to stand by Elnara's side. ""Late we are indeed,"" he intones in his grave way. ""Too late to share our tale, methinks."" His nostrils twitch. ""But tale or no...I would find it most pleasing to have a glass of caranyulda. Would that please you as well, Elnara?""

""It does not look like there is any. I believe that all they have is cider... I was told there would be wine, but aparently that was false,"" Elnara says, making movements to hush him gently, so as not to be rude to Elladan.

Bellaegis shakes his head at Saidonnen without a word, his gaze taking in Elnara with a smile as she enters - a smile not shared with the one that loudly follows her. He turns his attention fully back to Elladan, then.

Saidonnen sits back in her chair, accepting another cup of cider sulkily. But when she looks up at Elladan, her expression has resolved into attention and, indeed, anticipation. 

Elladan offers a grin and a wink to Bellaegis and Ranger Saidonen, and continues. 

""Long ago two brothers as like to each other and mirrors face to face, were soon to be born"" Elladan's grin quirks merrily, ""I have no idea who these brothers were, mind you,"" he adds an aside ""none at all, mellyn.... So it was that these two waited anxiously in the warmth and dark of their pre-life life. They did not, in all truth, realize that they were brothers. Nor did they realize that they were separate from each other. They spoke as one, and breathed as one. Ate as one and slept as one. And as they grew they found their quarters grown ever more cramped. 

""Soon... they understood that they were beings independent of one another - particularly when the elbow of one was thrust into the jaw of the other. Or the knee into the back... and so on.""

A pause. A sup of cider. The steam from the mug wreathes Elladan's fair face.

""Came a day, when the situation grew intolerable. 'Brother,' said one, 'move over, would you? This is the fifth time today you've stuck your thumb in my eye.' 

""The other frowned and rather than rolling aside pushed his brother with his shoulder. 'Its your heel that's been under my chin all day. Why don't you wrap your legs around your ears and stop complaining?' 

""They were, to all intents and purposes, at an impasse. What to do? Without a word... They kicked, simultaneously. Their mother shivered, and laughed. And they heard her say 'Alright then. One of you must come first.'""

Bellaegis chuckles, a sound quiet, rich, and deep. His expression is fully engaged, enrapt even, as he crosses his leg of his left knee, settling back in full attention to the words spun.

Curulomion lets himself be hushed and satisfies himself with apple cider...getting a mug of it and then moves close to his friend again, waiting for her to decide where to sit. One who looks like enough to Elrond to be his brother or his son (though Curulomion has to admit he never heard of Elrond having any brother save the long-dead Elros Tar-Minyatur)...but he has no desire to interrupt so he simply sips his cider and waits...and the humour of the tale is, as always, utterly lost upon the Dark One. And it is not that Elladan is a poor storyteller

Laughter, low and melodic, bubbles through the Kildeer's lips as she watches Elladan. She covers it with her hand, but her eyes are shining with suppressed mirth. 

Backing from the stage, Oretaurnas feels the edge of a bench and without looking, sits down unknowingly beside Aluirwen Dinlom. Moments into Elladan's tale, the forester mutters almost to himself, damp hands rubbing along his thigh, ""The tales grow taller and stranger, methinks. The afterborn, flowers, screeching owls and now the before born..."" A slight shake of his head and a quiver of rueful laughter before the Galadhrim abandons himself to the tale.

Elladan's voice grows low, he leans forward to speak to each and every edhel in the room. 

""The brothers looked at one another. And each grinned into the others eyes. Thought passed between their twinned souls quicker than words, but words were spoken. 'Wrestle for it?' they both said, and before the words were complete, these twin brothers were grappling in their mother's womb. Hands and shoulders, small legs trying trip the other's.""

Elladan's eyes widen now, like a cat's in the dark, and his grin grows downright Cheshire. ""It... was... a... fierce and merry struggle, friends. It ranged around the womb, small space though it was. And their mother laughed with it, held her hands over the dome of her belly and laughed at the vigor of her sons.""

Bellaegis smiles still, but the last words seem to settle somewhere deep in him. His hand comes back to rest cupping over his mouth, hiding his face partly from view.

Elnara looks over to Curulomion as she sees his slight confusion as she drinks her cider happily. ""He is Elladan, son of Lord Elrond. He has a twin brother by the name of Elrohir,"" she whispers to her friend, pulling him down next to her gently, careful not to spill his cider or hurt him in any way.

Curulomion lowers his head to whisper back softly. ""I knew that he and the Lord Elrond were related somehow. I see the resemblance in the face...a twin. That will be only one I have seen...and the only other twins I know of are Ambarussa; Amrod and Amras, the youngest Sons of Feanor.""

An air of jesting drama hangs about the Herion as he pauses his tale, stands upright with easy, languid grace. ""You know the end, of course. The elder was victor, and born first. Now, the younger sometimes claims foul play, and says the elder played him cheat with ropes and a foot in the belly but.... that is the younger's tale. And not this one.""

Another pause. Elladan's smile softens, the bearing of leonine frame gentles. ""The rest of their tale is yet untold, but unfolds daily. Sufice to say that these two brothers..."" 

A pause again, a search for words, and the merry silver eyes drop, fix upon the steaming mug. ""These two brothers share a friendship unlike any known in Middle Earth. For they share one thought. And one mind. One mine held in forms. And for the honor of their family, and the honor they bear each other... they walk the wide world, joined even when apart. And wrestling, betimes... for old times sake.""

""Hear, hear!"" calls Saidonnen, laughing at last as she raises her tankard in salute. ""It is truth, mellyn, that I have seen for myself, for none are more formidable than Elrond's sons."" 

Bellaegis's breath escapes from behind his cupped hand. He drops it, then, and raises the tankard in his other hand in silent salute. Something still catches in his eyes, and he blinks a few times.

""Aye! Even if neither is the taller one!"" Elnara shouts merrily. She turns to glance to Curulomion with a smile. ""Shall we, then, mellon? You are the eldest, so you shall speak first, I think."" She takes his hand and stands, looking to lead him to the center, where they would stand together and tell their tale as one.

Curulomion hangs back. ""Wait, Elnara!"" he cries, actually raising his voice. ""We have not been given permission to speak and I do not know how I do something like this! Wait!""

Laughing as he propelled himself upright, Oretaurnas replies, ""Both kin by necessity and friends by choice, the best of both worlds, Lord. Tis a fine tale and none here would not share your belief for sure!"" He glances around and then takes a step forward, ""More tales to share, mellyn?"" He looks around the room, eyes skimming and touching on any would have words to offer.

Elladan laughs, a deep merry chuckle that rumbles from his chest, and he bows with a curt and merry flourish to those assembled. As he walks to his chair, he passes Elnara and smiles. ""Hanging from a tree branch, Elrohir is the taller. And friend,"" he says, shifting his gaze to the ellon that accompanies Elnara, ""enjoy the telling of your tale, for I know I shall."" 

A merry nod is given Oretaurnas, and then Elladan sitsng with a contented heavy thump, and looks to the Kildeer and Bellaegis. ""I think you should try the brew from my flask, Saidonnen. Bellaegis traded well for it.""

""No, he did NOT,"" asserts Saidonnen, wrinkling her nose. ""I smelt it across the room--I believe the Breefolk use it to strip paint from fences, but they most assuredly do not -drink- it. Though it might be a fine remedy for the morbid sore throat."" 

Elnara's hand raises. ""We would, if we would be allowed to tell the tale together,"" the elleth says, waiting for Curulomion to catch up to her. She smiles to Elladan, winking. ""I thought you said you were the taller one?"" She smiles wider, moving up through the seats to the center.

Bellaegis gives the faintest of grunts as he lifts his own mug. ""Well."" The murmur is faint. ""The flask will be of some use, even if the contents are lacking."" He blinks again and rubs at his eyes once, then looks at Elnara and Curulomion as they stand, ready to tell their tale.

""Herion,"" Saidonnen says imploringly, leaning forward. ""Could you not influence the barkeep--just a little--to serve some ale? Or even wine? This cider is fine for one mug, but it grows over-sweet and cloying on the tongue cup after cup, and I know Dinlom ferments a most excellent vintage here..."" 
 
She sits back then, and turns her attention to Elnara and Curulomion, still managing to look most parched. 

Curulomion finally steps forwards to the place Elladan has vacated...and he looks like he would rather be in a orc-den. His hand shake and he wipes one over his marble-white brow. His eyes close...but a gathering of strength and his eyes open again as he strides to join Elnara. ""Our tale is in two parts,"" his melodious tenor rings out. ""The first is mine, the second Elnara's. But for my part..."" He takes Elladan's form to twist first person to third person. ""Not so very long ago,in a clearing deep in Lothlorien's golden wood, there lived an edhel, all alone. Long centuries before his father and mother had sought the Havens (at about the time of the unrest in Moria that happened), and now he lived on, alone, for he had been raised wtih just his father and his mother, outside of this fair city. He had no friends, he seldom spoke; there was no need to, for he was alone. He did not feel, for there was no need to feel; the last thing he remembered feeling was the pain of his parents' parting from him. Much as they loved each other, they wished no part of the wars and unrests on these shores and so they left...but the lonely edhel felt the call of the Sea less strongly; he loved the Wood too much to depart, though he was pained at the seperation. So he taught himself not to feel, so he would not feel pain."" He shifts restlessly, his hand seeking Elnara's. ""So he grew grim of mein, almost mute, a living shadow among the world. He wore black always, so none might see him, a black cowl so none might speak to him."" Here he pauses...for breath and to gather his nerves.

The blue clad elleth takes her friend's hand, gently squeezing it for support. ""The family of the other was quite similar to this edhel's, though not in the smithing trade. For many generations, since the founding of Imladris, her family had protected the Valley, either as guards or as simple citizens willing to fight for the Valley. Her father accompanied Lady Celebrian to the Western shores when she was very young, and her mother followed when she was four hundred years old. After her mother left, the elleth moved around the outskirts of the Valley, rarely venturing in. Not long ago, she returned after she had found her father's old flute, and discovered she could play. Since then, she has made a home with her kin in Nos Forodren, and became a member of the guard, as her father before her."" Here, Elnara pauses, forcing her emotions to behave themselves for once. ""On a journey, there was an attack on the party. She and another each lost a hand, as well as a little of their spirit. The Lady Galadriel saved their lives, and so they healed far sooner than any expectations.""

Bellaegis cocks his head toward his shoulder, listening. At the pause in Elnara's tale he gives a brief nod.

Elladan smiles, a picture of innocence. ""You think it has worth as paint thinner Saidonnen? Really? I shall have to take it to the artisans then."" His gaze flicks to the speaker and he keeps it there. But his whispered words, now are for Bellaegis. ""I think this, friend, is an escapde that will haunt you for many years."" He leans to the side and nudges the other with his shoulder. ""And I hope it makes you laugh as well""

Saidonnen smiles at Elladan, but her eyes remain fixed on the story-tellers, whom she gives a faint nod of encouragement. 

Curulomion raises his head, a strange warmth coming into his voice that usually is never found there. ""Finally, the edhel came to this fair City to live. Not becuase he was lonely, for he had long ago ceased to feel anything at all. But he came for he wished to learn the ways of a scholar and it was only in the city that he could find the ones to teach him. Nos Aderthad was his house and so he moved there, taking the smallest and most remote talan in the family tree. He stayed there most of the time, working on his studies, leaving all alone and wanting just to be left alone. It was then that strangers came to the Wood, the company of those who had lost a hand. He saw the lady who had lost her hand and there was a great festival, like unto this one."" Now Curulomion's eyes go downwards and he shifts restlessly again. ""One of the days there was a bardic contest and the Dark One came to hear it, a casual passing that aroused his interest in things of history and so he stayed. He listened to song after song and was pleased with none of them, for they all seemed shallow and of modern things, neglecting the greater people and events of the deep past that he loved so well."" The glirdain swallows hard. ""A call went out if there were any more to sing, and so the edhel went up to the stage. He sang as he wanted to, not what was popular, nor (as he did not realize) what was the theme of the contest. Many hated him for this; their hearts confirming that the Dark One was arrogant or half-mad, if not both. He was informed of his mistake after his offering and in shame retreated to the audience and there he sat (feeling shame for the first time in centures, if not thousands, of years) near the two that had lost thier hands on the journey.""

Bellaegis raises his mug in front of him mouth to hide his faint, murmured reply. ""Not as much as if you had taken a drink of it without smelling it first, Herion."" His expression is completely bland, his eyes on the two as they speak.

Elnara continues the tale. ""When she was well, the elleth attended a singing contest, were the dark clad edhel made a mistake and sang a song that was not of the theme. He sat near her when he was done, and she comforted him about his mistake. They began talking afterwards, and he told the elleth of his family, and how he had sealed himself off from the outside world because of the pain of their crossing."" Finally, Elnara breaks from their third person format for the ending. ""It makes me sad that he had not any friend to turn to, or that he found himself unable to come and seek help among you But it does gladden me that I have been given leave to stay and be a friend to him. I do not stay only for his sake, but also for mine. And yet, I feel that the choice may not have been so right for me had I not attended the song contest and met him. Our tale, too, is still evolving, and I hope our friendship is one that will not fade as the blossom, but remain forever in bloom."" Elnara blushes and moves to leave from the center, pausing to allow Curulomion to follow.

The Kildeer listens along, and her face is impassive. But when the two have finished, she joins the polite applause. ""Is not the Dark One..."" she murmurs very softly, brow creasing as she leans forward to her Elven companions once more, ""...not a way of referring to..."" She sits back and looks rather pointedly southward. 

Curulomion bows formally and low, well knowing he will end up getting yet more grief for his mistake at the bardic contest. He moves to follow Elnara back to their former place. ""I think they doth guess, Elnara,"" he murmurs. ""Now you be displeased to know me, for their dislike of me for my veiwpoints will fall upon you as well.""

Bellaegis applauds as well, a quiet smile on his face. ""Well,"" he murmurs, turning his head back, ""let us hope that is something said no more of this one.""

Elladan pulls the flask, still corked, from his pocket and thumps it down upon the table before him. His wide hands applaud the couple, and he smiles encouragingly toward them. To Saidonnen, however, he replies ""True,"" he says, a serious tone in conflict with his merry smile. ""But she is young.... She...."" 
He does not finish. A pause. A decision. And Elladan leans toward Bellaegis ""There will be time yet, for this flask,"" he says, his voice now in concert with his mien. ""And the future of its contents is still unknown friend hunter.""

""Dip an arrowhead in it and see if it melts,"" advises Saidonnen, eyeing the flask dubiously. 

It appears that Bellaegis takes great delight at Elnara and Curulomion's tale, for he laughs quietly but openly now as he applauds the departing pair.

The Kildeer is not one to remain silent when things must be said, though she is well known for her absolute silence in battle. She rises, and regards Curulomion gravely. ""We are all come here in friendship, mellon. Do not suppose us ill-disposed toward you--I, for one, know you not, and dislike you not. Give me your hand, and I will call you friend without shame."" 

""I shall not ever be sorry to know you, mellon,"" Elnara says softly to Curulomion, then smiles as she overhears Elladan and Bellaegis. ""What is the flask, then? I shall try it, without smelling it first, and tell you if it should indeed be used as paint thiner."" She reaches for the flask gently, and takes a sip. She shudders and hands it back. ""Paint thinner it is, my friend."" She turns to see the elleth approach Curulomion, and she smiles. ""I knew something good would come of this...""

Curulomion raises his head and does halt at Saidonnen's words and turns to take the stride needed to put her in arm's length. His long fingers extend from the sapphire sleeve...could they be so pale becuase Curulomoin has not been out in the sun much for centuries? ""I am Curulomion, lady. Glirdain and former jewelsmith.""

Elladan gaze follows Saidonnen. His grin remains firm and merry upon his face. He does not stand, nor interrupt, but observes for a moment or two....

Bellaegis lifts his eyes and watches the Kildeer as she approach Curulomion. He glances at Elnara's expression, only just then seeing her take a drink and moves to take the flask from the table, saying in an undertone ""I will replace it with two of decent quality.""

""Nay,"" he says at last to Elnara. ""This, dear friend, is not a drink for you,"" and his grin is warm. ""It is used to strip paint from furniture. Distasteful, at best.""

His gaze slips again to Curulomion and the Kildeer and rests on them lightly, languidly, looking for all the world like a cat watching birds from a window.

Saidonnen, nothing daunted, clasps that hand with her own fair and callused one. ""Well met, Curulomion of the Galadhrim. I am Saidonnen Broneryn, Ranger of the North."" 

Curulomion bows low to the Dunadan. ""I will say that this is the first time I have met one of your people."" He bows formally. ""And I admit I find myself somewhat at a loss. Over three thousand years I have lived...and yet my path has not yet crossed with that of your people. I am not at all sure what to do.""

""I agree, Elladan. By the way, I have almost finished remaking the picture I had made of your family, and should be ready in time for your return to the valley."" Elnara watches Curulomion with interest, smiling as her friend meets one of the Second Born for the first time. ""Just speak to her as you would to any of your kin. To any of us here.""

""Bid me welcome in Lothlorien and then go about your business?"" suggests the Kildeer, with merry eyes. ""It is customarily how a new friend is greeted."" 

""Or You could share a drink with her, friend Curulomion."" Elladan lifts his knee, rests his arm lazily upon it. He lifts his mug of cider in salute and sips. 

Resting the mug again upon the table, he smiles at Elnara and raises a brow. ""Have you indeed? Oh, that, I should very much like to see. But no rush, of course. You can show me when we get home.""

Curulomion is not merry and has never been known to be so, but he does bow again. ""Welcome to the Wood and I would be well pleased to hear that you are enjoying yourself here."" Then he turns to look at Elladan. One of the sons of an Elven lord, of Noldo blood in part, talking to him? ""Did you say something to me, Heru?"" he asks, showing his usual tendancy to lapse into Quenya (for the High Speech was often used in his home, his father from Ost-in-edhil and all) Then his keen eyes at once seek for any jewelry that Elladan wears, and then to drink it in with its intense gaze, almost devouring it. His hands twitch and then twitch again...and again, the long fingers snapping.

The flask, retrieved, is hidden away. Bellaegis looks at Elladan, then back at Elnara. Elves are starting to move around the room as the contest reaches its pause, maybe its end... he stands as well, murmuring ""Your pardon"" as he moves away.

""Alas that another sip of cider would surely choke me as quickly as yon foul brew,"" the Kildeer remarks, as the flask is hidden away. ""And yes, Curulomion, I enjoy myself enormously. Nothing is so congenial as a night of rest without fear of ambush or attack."" 
 
Now that the story-telling is ended, Saidonnen draws an ornate--if battered--pipe from another of her infamous pockets, and draws her chair back a bit to the window. The cross-breezes are drawing air nicely out it, and she contentedly hums as she tamps pipeweed into the pipe's bowl, then lights it with a twig held to a lamp momentarily. ""If I can have no ale, then I shall have a pipe instead,"" she says

The cross-breezes are drawing air nicely out it, and she contentedly hums as she tamps pipeweed into the pipe's bowl, then lights it with a twig held to a lamp momentarily. ""If I can have no ale, then I shall have a pipe instead,"" she says, inhaling happily as the smoke is drawn neatly out the window. 

Elnara sits heavily next to Elladan. ""I'm not going home, mellon. I have chosen to remain here, and have been given leave by your father to do so."" She smiles at the smell of the pipe, reminding her of home, and Bilbo's love for smoking. ""Ah, the smell of a pipe... Bilbo is just one I shall have a hard time saying good bye to...""

Curulomion does not apparently like smoking too much for he backsteps more twoards Elladan and Elnara, his hands still twithcing for a feel of jewelwork beneath his hands. He coughs once and manages sucessfully to strangle the second spasm.

Elladan cants his head to the side, regarding Curulomion with his paradoxically merry and feline gaze. ""I did indeed friend."" With his wide right hand, he waves toward Bellaegis, and invitation to stay, should the other take it. ""It was a merry offer to share a toast with Saidonnen. But as she dislikes paint thinner and cider, perhaps you'll share pipeweed with her---"" Curulomion's cough stops the words in his mouth, and he smiles.

Elnara's words reach him through both smoke and coughing, and Elladan turns entirely to her. The others in the room momentarily forgotten. ""Not coming home?"" A pause. ""Mellon, the valley /is/ your home. Why?""

Strange, this coughing, as the smoke is nearly all blown directly out, leaving almost none to waver around the Kildeer's nostrils. ""Few can truly appreciate a good bowl of pipeweed,"" she remarks, sanguine. ""But come, where is that forester chap? Do we wait judgement?"" 

Bellaegis moves across the room, over to the edhel who was arranging benches earlier. He stops and speaks to him, gesturing toward the back of the room whence he came. The other pauses, looks... Bellaegis speaks again. This time the other nods and moves off to another part of the talan, returning with two large pewter tankards which he hands to Bellaegis.

Curulomion blinks, starting to relax around Elladan finally. ""I think it would please me well to share some cider with ye both since I can not have caranyulda."" Then he leans over to Elnara. ""His jewels are so cunningly wrought...by the same or similar to the hands that forged his father's. How I wish I did dare to..."" He breaks off, quite aware that Elladan can no doubt hear every word he is saying. ""But look you...the workmanship..."" For once the icy eyes flash with emotion. ""How I wish I dared..."" he mutters again. ""But always...no.""

Elnara burries her face in her hand for a moment. ""Not again..."" she whispers, wishing she did not have to tell the tale again. ""Here feels more at home than the Valley... As I told Lord Elrond, I feel drawn to this place, and if I were to leave, I would leave a part of me here with the wood. I cannot explain it... Perhaps, as terrible as this sounds, the Valley was only my home because of my love of its people, not because of the place. I feel as though I belong here, like I can do a great good by staying..."" She trails off, once again overcome by emotion at the explaining. ""I will miss you all... terribly..."" she says softly, her hand covering her face again as a tear creeps under it to move down her cheek.

A small v forms between Elladan's sable brows. And as Elnara's tale unfolds, he rests a wide hand upon her hand, covering it. 

""Then it is a cause for joy, my friend."" The Herion's voice is like the whisper of a breeze, heard and felt as well, filled with the gloaming light of the world beyond, and tender. ""And my heart feels joy for you. I well know the call of these woods, and their beauty, and the air of blessedness that holds sway here. I came here often as a child, for the love of my mother's mother. And by her name, and my mother's name, I bless your choice, and you."" He smiles softly, cants his head to better see her lowered face. ""Be at peace. And know that now two realms call you sister.""

Bellaegis, returning, pauses behind the Herion's seat, mug in each hand. He steps back and sets one on the windowsill by the Ranger with a nod, then returns to extend the other one just far enough that Elladan can see and retrieve it if he wishes. His face is impassive, though his eyes do move to Elnara briefly.

Curulomion looks to Elladan and then bows. ""She has been accepted into my house, Heru,"" he informs Elladan. ""I know many there and will see that all will be well for her. I know many, though I do not often speak to them. She is my friend and has helped me. Now it is time to return the favour. I only hope I will do it well...I am a stranger to friendship and still learning how to be one. And THAT be truly a hard lesson indeed.""

A soft sigh slips out at the rendering of the tales, the gossip breaking out at the conclusion of the tale as Oretaurnas stands forth once more, eyes skimming the room, ""Are there more tales that any others would share?""

Elladan lifts his hand from the silent Elnara, and wraps it around the handle of the tankard. A swift glance to Bellaegis, a nod of hearfelt thanks, and he drinks deep as Curulomion speaks. ""Then you shall have my thanks, mellon. For she is and shall always be a sister to us in Elrond's Vale, and my friend.""

He looks then to Oretaurnas and waits to hear if more tales will flow this evening. 

When none speaks up again, the forester turns away, a hand swift across his brow before he smiles, ""Anone, I thank you all for the coming. The tales all speak true, in their different ways of friendship, of Firstborn and beasts, Of The Younger Children of Iluvatar and of the Before born."" At the last, he slants an amused grin at Elladan, ""I will let the audience decide and take their voices. I cannot decide for I deem all narrations this evening, winners.""

Weeping elleths and jewel-fixated edhels... Saidonnen is happy with her pipe, though she looks such gratitude at Bellaegis that none can mistake that the tankard is most welcome. The pipe's blue smoke curls away over the treetops beyond the room, and the Kildeer busies herself with the ale. 

Curulomion nods to Elladan. ""I thank you, Heru."" He is not comfortable enough to be so informal around Elladan. ""I will do my best. Then he simply stops speaking, standing with Elnara and the son of Elrond, content to sip his cider and once again watch and not speak.

Bellaegis slips around and into a vacated seat not too far from where Elladan sits by Elnara. Elves are starting to drift away from the talan now, most standing and talking. Laughter ripples across the room, reflected brightly off polished wood.

Elladan chuckles softly, offers Curulomion a nod, then leans far back from the table, nudging Saidonnen with the cold round cylinder of his tankard. ""You wouldn't happen to have another, would you?"" His impish gazes fixes on the pipe and he grins, broad and easy. ""Bellaegis has not, I'll deem, ever sampled pipeweed.........""

As the gathering broke up and drift into smaller groups, the black-haired forester walks to the side of the talan, letting those who would vote on the stories approach him. And come they did with lively Whispers and babbling mutters as some gestures to the Dunedain yet others towards the the Galadhrim smith and the Imladrim guard, yet more chimed in naming son of Elrond. Tribute was paid, the mention of Dinlom and Aderthad resonate and drift back into the general exchange and Oretaurnas's placid mien is ruffled as he looks to and fro, back and forth. 

At the far end of the talan, several plump leather flasks had been lain out on a table. Tooled from different shades of brown leather, the similiar-looking containers shaped to be held in a hand, had been made to be hung from belts. Warm caramel swirls and flourishes decorate the textured material, the spouts of each stoppered by gemmed wooden plugs wind with leather. Finally, finally Oretaurnas nods empathically and goes off to hold conference with the keeper of Mar Van Tyalieve. As if by arrangement, the flasks with their different coloured gems are quietly distributed to those who had stood and told their tales.

"event","The festivity of bardic congress continues through the days and through the nights, the Mar Van Tyalieva serving more than share of those revellers as song, poetry and laughter rings gayly within, cares forgotten for the while. At the front, banging a table with his mug, the keeper attempts to keep some quiet while tales are being exchanged.

The forester, Oretaurnas sways in his stance, dancing a little as he imbibes more of the brew served by mugs and then continues with his tale, declaring, ""It was BEAUTY who KILLED THE BEAST! Which beast ye might ask? The beast of love."" He sighs with exaggerated grace, a hand pressing against his chest, ""Slayed, slayed.""

At one of the tables sits a young elleth, her blue eyes sparkle as they flicker over all those gathered in the MVT. They rest with a glimmer of ammussement on the ellon Oretaurnas jsut as he is speaking. A small smile tugs at the corners of her lips as she hears his words. Her slender fingers lightly tap the mug sitting on a table before her as she gives a slight mischivious shake of her head all calls out into the din at Oretarnas, ""WE ARE EDHEL OF ACTION, LIES DO NOT BECOME US. Especially you""

Festivities, indeed. And those of Dinlom are not likely to miss out on such things as festivities: particularly if said festivities involve song and wine. Thus, the Mar would seem quite the suitable place to find Aluirwen, both songstress and one of the Dinlym. The rustling of skirts accompanies the motion of the Indiri finding a seat amidst the revelers, a drink in hand.

""Indeed! Ai, indeed!"" she agrees, nodding toward Thoniel. ""Come now, mellon!"" she calls to Oretaurnas now, a lilting voice rising just above other noise in the Mar. ""Such a strange tale pains me, and YOU MOCK MY PAIN in telling such a tale! Let us hear a fair tale!""
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

""But wait, wait! You've not heard the rest of the tale."" declares the black-haired forester, his hand dropping back to his side as he turns to face the two elleth who speak up against his story, ""I know I'm not of action, not like others."" He points at randomly picked faces in the crowd, most of whom serves duty at the border, ""But I have other action!"" and mimics the the motion of digging and then that of holding buckets, his eyes glinting with mirth. ""IT IS SUCH A WEIGHT TO CARRY, SUCH A WEIGHT to have none of you appreciate my talents. But on with my tale... Where was I? Beast of love. We edhel know much about love."" He looks around for agreement on that point.

""'Tis true, I suppose,"" assents the grey-eyed elleth, tipping her head to one side a bit, as if weighing the truth of the edhel's words. ""But such a weight we should not let you bear, at the least,"" she continues, a small smile perhaps akin to a mischievous smirk at her lips.

""Of love we may know, but we know naught yet of this Beauty you have mentioned. What of her?"" queries Aluirwen, merry words continuing straightaway. ""Has she eyes of blue and hair of gold? Ai, but I should hope not, for BLONDES ARE SCARCE AROUND HERE, and none shall do aught but think upon the tale's strangeness. But, nevertheless: continue, continue, even if she have hair of gold! For if we must hear this tale of Beauty and Beast, let us hear it in full.""

A wide smile of mirth and mischief breaks across the elleth Thoniel's face. Her eyes flickering to the other elleth who speaks, even if she is a Dinlom:p She gives a slight shake of her head as the forester continues to speak before inturupting him again, ""What do you know of love?! If you knew so much about the 'beast called love' you would know that THE FIRST DUTY OF LOVE IS TO LISTEN and yet you dismiss what we have to say!"" Her voice is light and jesting as she speaks on the verge of laughing. Her laughter erupting like an over filled stream at Aluirwen's words.

""Rare indeed are elves with golden hair, rarer still are those who do escape from this beast. But ... Mellon!"", Oretaurnas widens his eyes at Thoniel's words, both hands against his chest, ""I did not know, maiden! This is so sudden? Is that a declaration? Such weighty words and you speak so freely to everyone?"" He grins suddenly, thrusting a hand up to ward off any repercussions, ""Anone, I jest only! Lest anyone leaps to Thoniel's defence. Tis said that tis good to LAUGH AT YOURSELF FIRST BEFORE ANYONE ELSE CAN. But love is not a jest, it is a beast because it can both lift to great heights while dashing you from those same heights with just a smile. The tale of Beren and Luthien.""

Thoniel's bright eyes widen slightly as she laughs mirthfully at the ellons words. ""A decleration? Oh yes my undying love for YOU"" she jests dramatically, one of her slender hands flying to her throat in mock desperation. Her eyes flicker mirthfully around the room before murmuring to the elleth beside her, ""I think he has the WRONG PANTS on, he doesn't seem to be getting any blood to his brain""

""Ah, what wit have you, mellon!"" calls Aluirwen to Thoniel, tracings of laughter upon her words. She takes a sip from her mug as Oretaurnas speaks, and is hardly able to swallow before laughter is heard from her once more.

""Aye, aye, methinks you may be on to something, mellon, that something is not quite right with him"" she says to the elleth, then raising her voice so that all may hear what she says next. ""But is it not also said that LAUGHTER IS THE CLOSEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE? If all is taken as truth, would this not put you two on very friendly terms?"" The jest is in her eyes and in the tone of her words, teasing upon each word.

""I AM NOT STUCK-UP! Would you like less distance between us, mellon?"" The forester gets deeper into the jest as he pretends to move forward, a step taken towards Thoniel while Oretaurnas wraggles his brow.

""Or you?"" offers the forester, glancing towards the first elleth who teases, his gentle manners boldened by drink.

The elleth in her green dress laughs lightly, scooting her chair back as the elon nears her with his waggeling brows. Her chair almost tipping over as the legs his a plank sticking up slightly from the floor. ""Aluirwen what do we do with ellons who have drank too much?!"" she calls over laughter to the Dinlom Indir. As her turns to th other elleth she stands up suddenly, ""Look, he speaks lovely words to every elleth!"" she says loudly in mock jealousy over the laughter, ""Just goes to show YOU CAN NEVER PLAN THE FUTURE BY THE PAST, especially if that past includes an ellon!""

""Or me?"" laughs the Indiri in reply to Oretaurnas, who then turns to Thoniel. ""Ai, what can we do, mellon? What more can we do but play his own game against him!""

Again laughter falls from the lips of Aluirwen, but his is soon halted, and she, too, stands from her place. It would appear that she joins in the game with an over-dramatized motion of flipping her dark hair over her shoulder and a demure smirk written upon her expression. ""Lessen the distance AS YOU WISH, mellon, though I will not guarantee your safety! For dangerous it is for he who approaches without caution when he deals with both the beast called love and a beauty!""

"event","Morning has come to Dunland, and an icy one at that. The heavy wooden doors that shield the Hall of the Chieftains from winter's ravages are trembling slightly, and the wind rises and falls like chanting voices ... nay, those /are/ voices. The gruff tones of a guardsman, answered by lighter wind-muffled speech. And then the door opens a fraction, just enough to admit a swirl of gritty snowflakes and a slender figure whose cloak is too snow-encrusted to give any sign of clan. That slender figure grunts and, without raising its head, leans back against the wooden doors to shut them, cutting off the guardsman's ""Damn weather'd freeze Kiern's own b-"" off in midsentence.

Braziers burn smokily within the Hall, more light shedded by a few torches in their sconces over the table where two heads, one white and the other raven-black are bend over a scroll. Warmth spreads from the glowing fireplace, the arid stench of burnt wood thick in the room. Two guards in red loiter by the fire, both straightening as the slender form entered through the door. A sing-song drone breaks off as the door shuts, the older head looking up followed a moment later by the female black head.
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

The new entrant takes a few steps forward into the room before shaking snow-clad shoulders, sending a neat halo of white to rest at the feet of the doomed painted Forgoil, and revealing naught more than a cloak of dirty dun, well-patched and seemingly cut-down from the odd way its hem hangs. A moment later, though, a pair of youthful hands emerge from the cloak to push back the hood and free a head of dark curls that haven't seen a comb in a long while (and do a rather good job of hiding their owner's features too, one wonders if that is intentional). Only a boy, it seems.

The lad blinks in the smoky air. ""Infirmary that way?"" He jerks his head toward the inner door. It's probably hard to see in the dimness - he's addressing the pair of readers rather than the guardsmen. As his eyes adjust his gaze moves on, but then jerks back to rest on the scroll and he mutters an injudicious, ""Huh?""

Waving her guards back to their seats as she answers, ""Ayes, the infirmary's within the keep. Though the healer was called away early this morning. Ye're need of healing?"" The woman motions the lad closer, eyes examining the young man curiously."" 

Her companion grins widely, noticing the new arrival's reaction at seeing the scroll, his hands sliding wide to the edges of the scroll, holding it down.

The lad gives a sceptical snort. ""Healing? Me? Not likely!"" His features have already arranged themselves into a scowl by the time he tears his gaze away from the parchment and looks at the woman who's addressed him.

Perhaps it's her features, perhaps it's merely the presence of guards, but the youth seems to realize that his curtness might be unwise, for he clears his throat and adds on a reluctant explanation. ""Cav's ill, so I was sent to get herbs. Ele- ele-something."" The youngster's voice drops an octave on that final word, and the scowl returns, this time accompanied by a flush of embarrassment - suddenly he's seemingly very interested in that piece of parchment again.

A cocked brow, a sideway glance at the older man when he chuckles and a smile twitches Ryanne's lips as well, ""I see. A strong lad. Come, come closer. I dinna bite. Ele- ele.. Elderberry? Elecampane?"" Ryanne suggests two names quietly, ""Fer Cav... Wait, yer face is familiar. Yer Barseg's boy?""

The white haired man glances keenly at the young man's interest and looks down at the scroll as well.

The lad listens to the herb suggestions without looking up. ""Wasn't elderberry. Maybe the other-"" His shoulders jerk at the mention of Barseg, however, and at that point he /does/ look up, frowning. ""He's my Da,"" he admits, tone kept carefully even, and he regards Ryanne warily for a moment before tacking on, ""Why?"" Scroll and its keeper forgotten for the moment.

""Achs, Barseg's son. Ye must be Breveg. Ye've grown tall since the last time we've met."" She examines the lad intently, ""Ayes. Is yer father in Kierkgard Dun again? I've been meaning to go by and visit but the clan took much of my attention. How is yer Da?"" She pauses and then shakes her head at herself, ""Let's get ye that herb ye came fer. What aids yer brother? Breathing problems from the cold winter?"" 

The old man, Bear's bard from Creatrach waves over to one of the servers who lingers in the shadows. A young woman approaches, glancing at the trio at the table and smiles, her brow and smile silently acknowledging the hail.

The youth's suspicion fades a little as Ryanne speaks - perhaps he'd been braced for rather more hostile words? His stiff shoulders relax as he answers. ""Da's in the City, aye. Can't do much travelling in this weather."" Despite the cocky grin on his lips, there's a trace of bitterness in his tone, and his voice cracks again halfway through the sentence. His cheeks flush once more, but he takes a few deep breaths and manages to answer Ryanne's other question without his voice breaking. ""Cav's got the coughing sickness. It keeps me awake at night."" Despite the surly tone, the lad does look just a /little/ concerned. ""Does this- this elecamping thing help with coughing? Da'll skin me if I get it wrong""

""I ain't a healer."" admits Ryanne, ""I started my apprenticeship and the lessons slowed when I found myself stumped with that."" She jerks her head at the scroll, ""Confounded wriggling worms.""

Warren the bard laughs, ""Wot? Ye're saying the time we've been spending together trying to teach ye to read has gone a wastin' then, lass? Shall I stop the lessons then?"" 

Sheepishly, the Bear woman rubs her ear, ""Nays, tis strange but I be finding some joy now that I make sense of the curves and straight lines. But as I was sayin'. Ain't a healer but I do remember Elecampane helping with the breathing. I watch Master Ajax mixed it into water so that the old woman could breathe better and the cough grew gentler. And he added garlic to her diet too."" She motions the server over with a smile, ""Would ye please request elecampane from the infirmary? Tell them Lady Bear requests it and that I'd make it good with the Master Healer when he returns.""

Breveg is drawn out of his self-preoccupation long enough to listen to the exchange between Lady Bear and bard, his features registering blank puzzlement. ""Worms?"" He glances at the forgotten parchment, comprehension dawns and before he can stop himself it bursts out: ""But that's Forgoil stuff, isn't it?"" His voice cracks on the 'it', and this time it's more than mere awkwardness that brings the flush rising in his cheeks. He bites his lip, consternation all too clear, and temporizes, ""Uh. That is ... I didn't mean ..."" Silence.

The server nods and moves away, trotting towards the passageway, her head turning over her shoulders inquisitively at the lad's outburst. Her expression turns regretful but quickens her steps, the pit-pattering sounding almost like running before the footfall fades away.

The guards look over, resettling when Ryanne smiles reassuringly at them before letting her gray eyes slide back to Breveg. The bard is already watching the lad, quiet.

""Nays, ye meant what ye said. And tis well said, though perhaps not tactfully."" replies Ryanne readily. She puts her large hand on the scroll, the rasping of skin against old paper as she gently strokes it, ""I felt as ye did when I first started learning to read, Breveg. Why am I contaminating myself with some knowledge that wouldna serve any purpose but as someone taught me otherwise, very well indeed."" A hand creeps up to poke at her left shoulder, a wince flashing as she continues, ""Know yer enemy as ye know yerself and ye can fight a hundred battles with no danger of defeat. Not knowing is what had brought our clan to where it was four years ago.""

Breveg swallows hard at the response his outburst has brought, studiously avoiding the eyes of the guards and sending a resentful glare after the departing server. As Ryanne speaks he chews on his lip, tenseness still apparent despite the expression of polite interest he's trying to summon up for her words. ""I see."" Even if the tone of his voice suggests he doesn't, really. Then a frown tugs his brows down past those tangled curls. ""Four years ago,"" he echoes. ""Oh."" And if that last word is an octave lower than the rest, what of it? Surely to one his age the years can be of little import? Breveg shifts from foot to foot, once again looking in the direction the server had gone, this time as though willing her back.

A smile creases Ryanne's eyes though that did not show on her expression as she watches Breveg's reaction. What more she would have said remained unspoken when the server enters the room, that woman's breathing harsh as if she had hurried, a small packet in hand. ""Ah, here comes that elecampane. Give my regards to yer Da, Breveg. Tell him I will come by soon. A visit, not one with intentions."" The bard snorts, looking down at the scroll, quietly chuckling to himself.

The lad's relief when the server returns is ill-concealed, and he practically snatches the packet from her with no more than a nod as thanks. ""I'll tell Da,"" he responds to Ryanne without meeting her eyes. Clearly Breveg is eager to escape, for he jerks his head toward the door and adds a muttered, ""Um ... I'd best be going. He'll be waiting. Thanks for the herbs,"" he clears his throat to cover another break in his voice, hesitates and then for the first time manages a respectful title for the woman he's been addressing, ""Lady.""

He twitches the hood of his cloak up, then his steps take him hastily toward the door and back into the snow (and the wind that would freeze certain appendages of Kiern's own, if not a hardy youth ...)

"event","The crew of the ship are in a fine mood as the time of the auction comes near.

""Think they'll have enough gold to make it worth selling them anything?"" one crewman says playfully. ""Rather their gold than them, if ye take my meaning!""

Caius smirks at this talk by the Haradrim. The whole exercise of this auction is amusing as he calls, ""Selling? I think you mean ransoming..."" The northerner does not stop to banter as he continues his own private preparations.

""Dunno,"" another sailor says. ""These savages come in all different tribes, I think. Rob from one, sell to the other. Convenient.""

Knowing a thing or two about the locals, Caius shakes his head, but keeps silent as he pulls out a barrel high enough for child to stand on and be seen by the crowd.

""We'll have to keep them well back from the ship though,"" another crewman says. ""I don't want to risk them trying something fancy. Keep plenty of folk on board, and watching out for tricks, I say.""

""Aye, they may try to take back their kin by force. Best to show them a show of force ourselves and get the upper hand."" Caius pushes the barrel just so and then seems to be finished with his own work. Perching himself on the barrel, he sits and watches the sailors move around.

The whole field between where the Terondis is moored and the old South Gate of Tharbad has been cleared out, making a fine field for a crowd to gather. A kind of platform has been set up not far from the ship, and there some of the crew and a few other folk are working on setting up the apparatus of an auction. A few of the crew are standing around not busy, but apparently told off for sentry duty.

""We got guys on the ship keeping an eye out over the water,"" one of them says, ""So we got it easy: just keep an eye on the crowd.

It is morning: by the time the auction begins, it will be a bright and dry 10 a.m.

Upon the platform rests a large barrel meant for a child to stand on and be seen by those below. At the moment however, it is a seat for Caius, a northerner who seems to be a part of this endeavor, though what part he plays remains to be seen.

One of the Haradrim guards drums his hand on the barrel. ""All right. Where are those bidders?"" His scimitar is quite visible.

Sniffing at the air, The Dunlending by the name of Barker just sniffs as he waits for the activities to begin. He might be Dunlending, but he has some coin to spend. He don't wear completely the furs some wear. He has made his money and he spends it right, including some fabrics from Bree. He folds his arms and just waits for the first item up on the block.

News of the auction had spread. Though attendance at the event is 'invitation-only', the flotsam from within Tharbad drift towards the black-sailed ship, gawkers pushing against make-shift barriers around the cleared space while buyers sauntered or slunk towards the stage. Toal pushes his way through the crowd, a large club hammering those slow to move as he cleared a path for his leader, Affey. The large man is accompanied by his old father and a small entourage and he looks angry, yet a aura of fear hangs over him.
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

Glancing around at the Haradrim and then the gathering crowd, Caius gets himself up off his barrel and then walks out to the middle of the platform. Surveying the possible customers some more and noting their apparent relationships with the local riff-raff, he turns and speaks softly to a lieutenant, who wanders off to bring up the first of the morning's merchandise.

One of the guards draws his scimitar as the crowd gets bigger. ""Gotta make sure they stay proper intimidated,"" he says to his companion. ""The captain says, once they bought from us, we got a market we can come back to another time ... but this time, if they decide a rescue's the way to go, we got to make'em regret it just as long as it takes for the blood to run outa their throats.""

One of the corsairs from the Terondis, a 'wise' salt named Zadok, stands by the auction area with a few other corsairs. They talk loudly, guffawing and snickering among themselves, all-the-while keeping watch. Zadok wears dark, loose-fitting clothing. His round, kind face is wrinkled from both age and the sea air.

Shorter than some, slim and lithe, a quiet man in dark clothes slips unobtrusively through the crowd. Hooded brown eyes move from person to person as he passes them, sizing them up as potential opponents? Potential distractions? Lerrik settles himself where he can see the platform easily, fingering the hilt of the short sword hanging from his hip.

Another of the guards already has his scimitar in hand, resting lightly against his shoulder while his dark eyes survey the crowd that has gathered. Salim coughs, and looks to his fellows nearby, saying, ""Best be getting a good profit out of this lot... Seems there are plenty of them to be bidding."" The Corsair scratches at his chin. ""Long as they stay quiet. Though I guess I would be up for a scrap if they get outta hand...""

The captain of the Terondis, one Ishrac, stands on the ship watching. It seems almost as if he's letting others handle this for him, and is focused all and only on his ship. He walks up and down the deck as if letting off nervous energy.

Step, click, step, click. Jhunar approaches his brother and the corsairs that accompany him, not even changing for the occasion. No, he still bears his nasty clothes, and seems proud of it. With a snort, muffled by the long nose-hairs of his nostrils, the old Corsair holds his fuzzy chin up high as he approaches Zadok. One foot forward, then a swing to the side as his peg-leg plants firmly after the first. ""I'm gonna git me some real purty lookin' one today, I am!"" he declares to them before he is quite there. Not a long distance, but his walk is dreadfully slow.

""One of the girl's pretty sweet. Wouldn't let me sample the goods, captain wouldn't, but I might make an offer. Good teeth, good hips, strong, pretty even."" That is one of the Haradrim standing near the platform.

A sharp slap rings in the cool air of the morning, a gasp and a child's cry hastily stifled while a woman's voice rises in anger, abruptly cut off by another clap of hand against flesh. Shortly after, the lieutenant rounds the corner, leaning forward as he drags a resisting childish form, the hands of the young girl held on tightly by a woman, held back by two other guffawing men. Red marks the woman's face as she attempts to kick back at her captors but is easily overpowered.

At the first childish cry, Affey straighten, eyes blindly scanning the end of the boat and only when the child is finally stood up on the keg in the middle of the stage, does that large man relaxes. The older man beside, Grandda Affey exhaled a loud sigh of relief, ""It's not her, son. It's not her.""

Lerrik's head moves, abrupt but smooth, towards the cry, and passionless eyes consider the child, move briefly to the woman and then return to the girl.

Barker looks off towards Jhunar for a moment, his arms still folded across his chest until they start bring out the first of the items for sale. He leans his head slightly, trying to get in a good look. She looks young enough. Maybe able to break her in good and quick for work.

""You sure none of them are local?"" the guard who was talking earlier says. ""Long as they're not from round here, they seem eager enough.""

Zadok nods to Salim. ""A mighty fine profit. I intend to bid myself, seeing as there's a slave I might want."" The old man smiles knowingly, raising his eyebrows to accentuate his remark. 

As his brother Jhunar walks toward them, Zadok's smile turns to a glare. ""You wont outbid me, Jhunar! You're always trying to outdo me, but by the Eye, I will get my way!""

Caius looks back as the child is brought out. Once she is placed up on the barrel for all to see, he lifts his hands, calling for quiet so that he might speak to the crowd. ""Friends, friends, FRIENDS!!!"" Silence for the most part reigns.

""Welcome! It's getting on toward noon, so let us begin!""

In the morning light a lone rider approaches the scene of the auction from the south. The rider is swathed in a black cloak, his head stooped as though from a long journey. And by the appearance of his horse, it has been a long journey indeed. 

Both horse and rider are gaunt and mud covered as walk slowly up to the back of the crowd. With grey eyes, bleary and wind-blown, the black clad arrival surveys the strange scene before him, content to sit atop his horse at the rear of the crowd. <Repose>

A couple of the guards turn then, glancing toward Caius, then back toward the crowd. Even on the ship, some of the guards turn to look at Caius as he speaks.

Zadok's glare is returned, though it looks hilarious coming from the cross-eyed Jhunar. After a moment of glaring at his nose, the old corsair fist shakes at his brother. ""Zadok, I ain't got to outdo you. I already gots the looks of the family! You lookin' more like the old family dog! Nyah-hah hah!"" he declares, grasping his scrawny mid-section and sneering at his brother. But he quiets, and turns his attention to the stage. Then sends a glance to Zadok, only ready to bid if his brother does.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Down the shore the ruins of Tharbad stretch, their nitred rocks overgrown with long grasses. The walls are reflected in the wintery light upon the river. Their shadow covers a broken tower upon the river side, its forgotten doorway an empty pit.

There is soft mud before the ancient threshold though, and there heavy hoofprints mark where some wayward cowherd has sheltered an oxen or some strong beast for the night. If one were close, they could hear the deep breaths of the horned beast hidden in the ancient stone place.

If one entered, they may find something far more dangerous, for doom waits here.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
The girl-child up on the barrel can't be more than seven years old. Reaching up and taking her hand, Caius leads her in a little spin, showing off her dark hair, dark eyes and muddy dress from all angles. With the little girl facing the crowd once again, Caius reaches up and pulls open her mouth to reveal some nice white teeth.

""The bidding will start at TWENTY SILVER PENNIES! Do I hear twenty?""

Darrith grunts a bit and waits some more. The first item isn't for his liking, and he is just going to suffer through it until a sutiable piece of merchandise comes along.

""I ain't no dog!"" Zadok says angrily to Jhunar, his dark eyes flashing brightly. ""Every'un knows that I gets all the women-folk if I wants 'em! None resist my charms."" He then turns to look at the child with keen eyes, examining the skin, hands, hair, and face. ""She be mighty pretty -- young, too. Just what a young feller like me needs."" He raises his hand to show that he is ready to bid for the girl, but only after a quick glance to see what his brother is doing.

The little lass's mouth trembles, her wish to bite down on Caius invading fingers bring in her tear stained expression yet she holds back, eyes creeping back to where the woman had been dragged away. Studiedly, she looks away from the crowd, head tilted defiantly high yet the trembling in her fingers and her thin frame betrays the fear within.

Caius looks around and spots Zadok lifting his hand. ""Twenty there, is there thirty? Can I say thirty?""

Lerrik leans forward a little. ""Aye,"" he says in a soft harsh voice. ""Twenty..."" He looks around swiftly to see who he might be bidding against.

""Ropes 'n chains ain't charms, Zadok!"" Jhunar chortles, reaching a hand out to slug at his brother's shoulder teasingly. He then turns his attention from the little girl to the corsairs around him. ""This's charm, right 'ere, it is! Ain't no man got a smile like this, 'n ain't no woman can resist it!"" he adds, spreading his lips to show off his nasty little baked-bean teeth. 

Then Jhunar tosses a hand up quick after his brother, announcing, ""Thirty!""

Unseen, other eyes watch the proceedings. Hidden watchers, doom-bringers... 

""Pfah... I'm not spending any of me money on stuff that we already -have-..."" Salim says back to Zadok. ""Plus... it's all good enough to just watch."" Dark eyes watch the bidding begin, noting each face of each person who gestures their amount. ""Too much for me already, anyways,"" he says with a laugh, fingering his nearly empty coin-pouch.

Barker rubs at his chin before lifting his own hand. ""40."" He calls out. He looks around at the other bidders for a moment before looking back at the girl.

Caius smiles at Barker at the sound of forty. ""That good man back there for forty. Can I say fifty? Fifty for this dear, sweet little thing. A hard worker to be sure!""

The Terondis is not beached. When the captain arranged her mooring, he rigged a rope ladder out to the shore, and the ship is anchored in the main current, facing downstream, as if the captain is a congenital pessimist.

The South Gate provides shelter to a dark-haired pair, a man and a woman, in cloaks of grey. Inconspicuous, they are, merely leaning against the stone and watching the auction some distance away with decidedly bland expressions.

""Fifty,"" Lerrik says. He is very still, but a corner of his mouth twitches, and the persistent fingers never cease playing along the hilt of his sword.

""Blazes!"" shouts Zadok as the price shoots higher and higher. ""Fifty-five,"" he says slowly, raising his hand once more. ""I won't let you outbid me, Jhunar! Your bags don't have much gold, I reckon.""

A scowl crosses the rider's features as he perceives what is underway and his horse fidgets nervously as though judging its rider's mood. Pulling his cloak about him the newly arrived stranger dismounts to calm his ride. 

""So how do ye know she's a good worker? And healthy?"" An onlooker shouts.

Mouth ajar, Grandda Affey looks at the young child on the cask, noting her limbs and compassion softens his wrinkled face. Corey Affey looks away from the girl, disgust on his face and starts when his father's clawed hand reaches out to grasp his, ""Father?""

""Bid, son. I canna abide the thought that somewhere Tig might be suffering the same fate. Please.""

A wince of pain and fear tightens Corey's eyes and a moment's thought later, he calls out, ""Fifty one!.""

""They's full enough t'outbid you, Zad!"" Jhunar retorts, shooting a sneer at his brother. Stumbling forward on his peg-leg, he tries to put himself in front of his brother, as if blocking him will somehow stop him from bidding. At the same time, Jhunar screeches out, ""Fitty-five!""

Barker looks around at all the bidders again before lifting his hand. ""65."" He calls out loudly, his voice clearly able to be heard across the area.

Larrik's bid is met with a nod from Caius, who wraps an arm around the little girl's knees in a fatherly gesture. ""I hear fifty. But come now, how can I part with her for anything less than--- Of course she's healthy, sir, you have my word!""

The northerner smirks at Corey. ""Don't insult me or this child! Yes sir, fifty-five! Can I say SIXTY?""

The bidding goes swift and barely after his bid, the price rises and Corey swallows, ""Fifty-six!""

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Long ago, the men that lived here passed away. They left the relics of their strength as monument to heros past and the might of an enemy they could not face. The walls are one, for still they stand, dark and high and mostly whole. Another lies mostly unseen beneath the waters, only the falling towers to either side of the river betray what once it was.

From within one, eyes watch what passes through the gaps in the tower walls. The stamp of hooves upon the mud-covered stones within betrays the presence of the beasts.

All holds the hint of something soon to pass that will not be pleasant for those for whom it has been planned.

65. Lerrik pauses, considers; or one might presume that is what he does - there is little or no expression on his face. Finally he shrugs, a faint movement of one shoulder beneath the rough cloth. ""Seventy.""

Zadok glowers. ""She ain't that purty,"" he says, looking down, shame-facedly. ""I best wait for a different slave. She weren't purty at all. Waste of money, if you ask me.""

Caius lifts the girl onto his shoulder and steps up to the edge of the platform. ""Sixty-five is the bid, can I save seventy? Seventy for this. A new daughter, a new wife! What's a few more silver pennies?! Seventy, thank you, sir. Can I say seventy-five!?""

""Seventy-fi-- ooh no!"" Jhunar changes his mind halfway through. Turning his head, he squints the un-squinted eye at Zadok, snorting. ""What? Oh yea, I's wonder'n when you was gunna stop.... I ah.. I'll stop too,"" he adds, glancing to his peg leg, waving it around in the dirt. ""I ain't want that one any ways...""

The girl is deposited back on the barrel and Caius surveys the crowd once again. Looking a bit pleased to have gotten this high, he calls, ""Seventy once... Seventy twice...""

Banedil lets out a hurrumph. ""76."" He finally says after some thought. He frowns gently and sinks his shoulders.

""Seventy-six is the bid from that man back there with the frown! Who's going to save this little thing from having to go home with Mr. Frown?!""

The dark-haired man in the gate glances at something behind him casually, then to his accomplice he murmurs something.

The child shrinks a little at the outpouring of voices, her nose oozing a wet rivulet as she continues to stare away from the men in front of her, her eyes seeking for the woman hidden behind the barrels. A loud gasp as Caius raises up high, her hands convulsively grasping at cloth and the man's hair yet even now she takes care with her strength. From her vantage, the lass looks down at the eager eyes and greedy hot mouths and her trembling grows stronger, her dark eyes desperately casting about until they cross that of the oldest man in the crowd.

Incongruously, Grandda Affey offers the child a smile, one of courage and strength, mouthing something at the young girl. Curiosity strips some of the terror and she leans forward, eyes blinking tears away, tears that courses clean lines down her grimy face.

Placed back down on the barrel, she eagerly seeks that old man again, holding his eyes.

The towers. Ruins to the uneducated eye, but the Dunedain built such things to last. And so an aura of impending doom rises about it like the miasma of the nearby swamps, thick and fetid and immediate. 

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
""I were gonna let you bid all yer gold on her, Jhun, to make a fool of yerself,"" says Zadok. ""Like usual. Such a fool as never was born.""

A faint scowl mars Lerrik's smooth forehead, then he nods, almost with resignation. ""Seventy-seven...""

Clawed fingers dig into Corey's arm and sweat breaking about, Affey calls out again, ""Seventy-seven and half!"" He mutters, ""Father, my purse isna bottomless!""

""Yeah? ... Yeah? .. Well.... yeah?"" Jhunar retorts, narrowing his cross-eyes at his brother. ""How 'bout shut up Zad? Yeah, how's about that? ... You jus' be mindin' yer own golds, 'n how's about lettin' me mind m'own?""

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Swift and lithe figures slip into the tower so gracefully and difficult to spy they are as bird shadows darting over the land. Seven in number they lapse into the darkness of the ruined tower pierced through with glancing sunlight, the ravaged tones of the slave auction haunting the wind. One very tall figure leads them, pushing back his hood when he enters, and Elrond calls a soft greeting in a musical tongue, ""I bring unexpected yet welcome guests. My son and folk from Imladris.""

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Caius looks less pleased now as these men dicker now over this girl by a single silver penny. ""Seventy-seven is the bid!"" Caius leans forward and calls to Corey, ""We're not taking 'halves' here, sir. Only full silver coin!""

Barker looks towards the Corey boy before chuckling out. ""78."" He shakes his head slowly before laughing under his breath.

""Wot! My coins ain't good enough fer ye?"" retorts Affey, shaking off his parent's hold to hitch his belt into place, ""Ye dinna state that out front! Half is a half!""

The black-clad rider pauses suddenly, hand resting on the neck of his horse. Dim grey eyes narrow on the boat in the water and the men running the auction, and suddenly he pulls his hood deep and turns his horse away from the crowd. 

""Well, if you don't know the rules, maybe you ought not to bid."" Caius looks away indignantly from these local yahoos and catches Barker's bid. ""Do I hear seventy-nine?!""

""Eighty,"" Lerrik says impatiently, after turning half around to stare at Corey.

""You hear nothin'!"" Zadok shouts loudly at the auctioneer. ""She ain't worth more than that!"" He looks disappointed, perhaps because he really wanted the girl for his own.

Indignation lights Corey's expression and he steps forward, ""Local yahoos? Who do ye think ye are?"" Patting the pouch at his waist, he continues glaring at the others around him, ""I want that lass. Toal!"" A stoop shouldered man comes forward, hefting his club, ""Ye watch who's bidding against me!""

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
In the same tongue, if accented, one of those hidden within replies. ""Welcome indeed."" The figure, engaged in calming the oxen, pushes her hood back a bit, and resolves herself into Saidonnen Broneryn. ""A more welcome sight I never saw, I think."" She nods then to the scene beyond a narrow slit in the stone wall. ""A -child-. They are selling a -child.-"" The Kildeer shudders, an ineffable sadness and revulsion warring in her eyes. 

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
""Eighty!"" Affey stares hard at Lerrik, ""And one more. And one more."" He wags a finger at his opponent.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
""Good,"" a grim and low voice answers, ""Are you master of the beasts of the field as well as the elves of the Valley, my lord?""

The hooded figure to whom it belongs has not turned to look on he to whom he speaks. His figure is black, silouetted, before the sunlight shining through the spaces in the tower. The shape of his bow curves from his left hand and his sindar accents cannot be mistaken. He says at last, ""It is passing hard to fire bow and drive these yoked beasts forth."" Dour it is spoken, for this is Thangil, of old the Shield of Gil-Galad.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Lerrik earns himself a grin from Caius. Zadok is ignored. Apparently, the auctioneer is happy enough with eighty. ""Going once! Going twice!---"" Caius glares at Affey. ""Eighty and one is the bid...""

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
""This ... ...,"" the man at the gate murmurs in a quiet voice. ""... ... timing ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... all now.""

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Barker sighs out. ""Let's stop with this now and make this fun. 100."" He calls out. He nods towards the auctioneer. He is going to earn his coin today.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Elladan in slips beside his father.... nods greeting to those already in place. His mouth becomes a hard line at Saidonnen's words, his gaze glacially cold. ""A whispered word to those oxen may help,"" he says to Thangil. ""Position us where you need us, mellyn."" A wide hand indicates the others that follow behind them. Each and every one bears the signs of hard riding, and battle.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Not even bothering with talk, Caius looks back to Corey and Affey. ""It's one hundred silver pennies. And we don't take sheep or their wool, so don't try and think you're going to barter for this girl.""

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
""Ready?"" a faintest of whispers, barely above a breath, comes from the lips of Tinduial, the raven haired companion of Eithaforn. She rests seemingly relaxed against the wall, long cloak wrapped about her, formless in the shadows.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Lerrik's hand slips down the sword hilt a little, touches a pouch with the very tips of his fingers. He turns a grim look on Barker. ""And five."" It is almost a sneer now.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Bellaegis does not speak as the harsh accents of auction - beings sold as beasts - drifts through the gaps in the tower walls, but his left hand flexes and regrips the bow at his side. His eyes are half-hooded - under his lids, they are as hard as the slate of which color they bear.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
A brief nod is given to Lerrik. ""Five and one hundred silver pennies is the bid. Will anyone go higher?"" He looks to Corey and Affey again, waiting to see if they'll add in the price of their village in order to purchase the girl.

Barker catches Lerrik and just chuckles out. ""Well, then. Why and ten then?"" He says with a grin, lifting his hand to make sure the auctioneer know it is a bid.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
""Few like to be yoked, even oxen,"" answers Elrond, ""and though I am no master of beasts, I may be able to help them realise there is freedom in what they do this day."" He crosses over cracked flagstones choked with dirt and weed, heedless of the the strong scent of the animals and marshes, laying a hand upon the back of one of the oxen, murmuring something.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Aware of his father's eyes hard on his back, Corey hesitates, ""One hundred silver pennies? Coins? Bah!"" Lerrik's challenge brings Affey's entourage's eyes around and he mutters, ""Fer a mere lass, father..."" Before he can bid, Grandda Affey calls out, quivery voice, ""One hundred and ten. And fer each bid, I will add one until that lass is mine."" The old man limps out to stand beside his son. ""No child, no child shall be stolen from us while I am alive."" His old eyes is steady, though drool rolls down from the corner of his mouth.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
""Look at them,"" Eithaforn sneers, his voice low as he grinds his foot into the dust. ""Braying like asses; bartering coin for lives. I am ready, yes, Tinduial. We must wait for the signal, however. And so we do nothing.""

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Lerrik steps back, shaking his head.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Gilredil shadows Elladan. He is no more than a ghost in the night, his footsteps silent and the thick folds of his cloak hiding most of his form. Grey eyes peer at the somber folk in the tower. Words do not come, but he offers a nod in greeting and then another after Elladan and Elrond speak.

As the oxen gentle under Elrond's hand, so too does Saidonnen relax her hold upon the yoke. ""In truth, we will set them free the moment their task is done. It is good work they will do this day, and good lives they will save."" 
 
She nods then to both Elladan and Gilredil, speaking no more as she turns to watch the auction move on. 

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Cais shrugs at Barker and points at Affey. ""Eleventy-one silver pennies, and this girl is sold."" Turning rapidly, Caius points to a guard and waves for him to take away the girl. A nod is granted the lieutenant and the northerner calls, ""Bring out a woman, a nice one too. We'll see how high they want to go over something that's really worth bidding over.""

Darrith perks up at this. ""Finally, somtin' worth a few coin!"" he yells, a gleam in his eye as he fingers his purse.

Barker chuckles out and simply shrugs to see what is up next to bid. He pulls at his tunic, shifting into a comfortable stance.

""Bah, I ain't gots the coins t'be wastin' on ... little'uns 'n such! These people ain't all there!"" Jhunar announces to anyone who will listen to the ramblings of an old man. He points at his head, as well. And then, with a grunt at Zadok, the old man spits on the ground and begins wobbling off. ""I's goin' back t'da boat. Ain't no sense in so much standin' fer nothin'.""

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
""If they pull their weight and this child built stuff stays strong,"" a wary eye passes over Saidonnen and from her to ancient works in the back of the tower, ""Ours will be the better doom.""

Thangil turns his eyes back to the proceedings beyond the tower. It is a passing glance, for he drops softly from the wall, his mail making the soft hiss of steel rings as he lands. He turns a dark eye upon the gathered company of elves.

Grimly, he turns his attention to the hilts of his sword.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
As the girl is at last sold, the black-clad stranger once again mounts his horse and begins to ride slowly away from the auction and towards the gates of Tharbad. From beneath his hood he studies the ruins with a hint of interest in otherwise dead eyes, but never once does he glance back or make effort to lower his hood. 

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Tirloth's grip hardens more upon the spear she carries. She turns aside from one of the cracks and the harsh voices coming from it, as if that will lessen the sound. 

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
The lass, Benga leaps off the barrel, slapping away the guard's hands and dashes forward into the old man's arms, tears falling easily as she butts her head into that old embrace. ""<Dunael> Kiern save us, son. What beasts have we turned into that we sell and buy children in Dunland. Come child, come. I will have no more part in this."" 

The woman steps out, shaking off her captors' hold, her head high, searching for the young girl, a smile of relief breaking out when she sees her ward in the old man's embrace. Anelle is plump, regular of features and tall as are most Dunlendings, her stride long and proud as she glares into the rest of the crowd, a snarl breaking her pleasant face, hate and anger deforming her prettiness.
""You ain't got the silver, that's right!"" Zadok yells after his brother. ""You as poor as a mouse in the winter!"" Shaking his own coin purse, the soft clinking attests to the littleness of his own money.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
""It will stay strong,"" Saidonnen replies with quiet confidence. ""We may be as children in your eyes, but our methods were well learned and employed."" No malice, no anger, just immutable belief as the Kildeer looks down at the windlass yoked to the oxen. ""It will move."" 

Whatever the Lord of Imladris had whispered to the animals it has worked. They are calm, settled, and prepared to strain against the wreck of time. Elrond leaves them to stand with his folk, to gaze upon the slave auction with an unreadable expression upon his fair countenance.

Then Elrond murmurs, ""Ready the boom. It will take time to raise it, and it would be wise not to trust to the last minute.""

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
The captain seems to have lost interest in the auction, and is now standing on the rail staring downriver.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
""We might make some sort of difference...perhaps,"" Tinduial replies softly. She brings something out of a hidden pocket, a small leather wrapped bundle. Her fingers toy with it uneasily.

""I am not good with patience yet,"" she admits dryly, ""Yet one more thing in the list I have to learn.""

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Looking over Anelle with half a mind to bid on her himself, Caius shakes himself out of his staring and calls out to the assemblage. ""I see her. This ain't no girl, but a woman. Someone who can go in the fields or stay at home and watch the brats. Someone to have at your side in the cold of the night.""

The northerner eyes the locals and sneers at them as he calls, ""We'll start at five florins. Can I say ten florins? Ten golden florins for this lovely example of woman?""

""Forty silver!"" Zadok yells out for the woman, raising his hand in order to be seen as well as heard. ""Forty, I say!""

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
""It comes with practice,"" Eithaforn counsels in his muted tones. ""Someone is coming this way.""

The tall Dunadan has taken note of the hooded rider, it seems, though he avoids looking directly at him. ""Is our surprise still hidden under the spare cloak? Be sure you are inconspicuous about it.""

Elladan's gaze slips then toward his father. Mouth a thin, taut line he says nothing, but looks to his bow - checks tests the gut - pull and release. ""Patience,"" he says in reply to Tinduial, ""is learned. And rewarded."" 

He leans casually then, against the wall, looks down upon the proceedings below, disgust roiling behind the silver light of his gaze.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Pausing, Jhunar reels around on his peg, glaring at the back of Zadok's head. ""Why I oughts'ta!"" he growls, his arm either quivering with rage or fistshaking once more. And he hunkers down, wooden leg out behind himself, to pick up a small stone and lift back up. ""Bid on this!"" Jhunar shouts at his brother, reeling his arm and hucking the little stone at him before turning on his peg leg, to make what could possibly be the slowest escape ever.

Benga huddles with Grandda Affey, her sobs quietening as she gestures to Anelle and then starts to pour out her story, the old man looks grave, switching his gaze between the child and the woman on the stage. Again, he calls out to his son, his voice boding no disobedience and Corey throws his hands up into the air, his outcry of exasperation loud even in the bustle surrounding the woman. ""Five B***** florins!""

The stone hits Zadok square in the back of the head, knocking him out instantly. With a cry, the old corsair crumples into a pile of baggy clothes and loose skin and bones on the ground.

When he called out for ten florins, a reply of forty silver pennies was not what Caius had in mind. ""Come now. You're not going to take this pretty young woman home with you for pennies."" He reaches out deftly and lifts the hem of the woman's skirt, revealing a bare ankle. ""Isn't something like this worth some real money?! Hmmm?"" He smirks at Corey. ""The bid is five florins.""

Lerrik , who had bid so high for the previous item, show little interest in the woman. Instead, his eyes move ever and again to the girl, and he shifts from foot to foot, boredly.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Looking on the Lord of the Last Homely house and then to the elves about who do not move at the command, the Shield asks, ""Do any of these know ought of the works of men? They seem as younger elves, never to have known the siege works that once were faced in the Last Battle.""

Without waiting for an answer, Thangil goes down into the dim shadows where a large length of chain lies half buried and brown with rust. Pitch has been added to the dirt that covered the toothed wheels the chain feeds into, so that now the gears a black muddy mass. Quietly he strings his bow across his back and fastens a strong rope hard into the end of the chain. This then is made fast to the yoke between the brace of oxen.

With a final glance at the whole machine, the elf of the stone shakes his head. The grey gem gleams as if in mirror of the grim elf's thoughts, ""It is as ready as it may be.""

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Arms around the girl, Grandda brings Benga away, his old voice a reassuring drone in the lasses ears. Anelle shifts her head, trying to keep the girl in sight, tiptoeing to look over the heads of those in the crowd, landing back onto her heels when the pair disappears from sight. 

Snatching her skirt away from Caius's hands, that brief flash of skin quickly hidden as Anelle spits out her ire, ""<Dunael> I can see why ye all need to buy a woman, none of ye can get a woman any other way! Buy me, buy me if ye dare and ye'd never sleep safely anytime anymore!""

The captain stirs, looking downriver. Something has caught his eye, but what is not clear. Perhaps not even to him.

--------------------------------
<lj-cut text=""Summary of Scene""> 
The morning of the Auction dawned bright and cold. Rumours about the invite-only auction organized by those who sailed the black ship drew both onlookers and buyers to the scene. The auction square was packed, the bidding fast and furious as men lusted after what was placed on the block. Unbeknownst, eyes that looked upon this commerce in abhorrence were plotting to disrupt the festivities and capture the black ship. 

At the height of the bidding war, there was a horrendous metallic screech and the Dogs of Chaos slipped their leashes. An ancient defense mechanism of Tharbad was raised, arrows of flames released at 'The Terondis', setting that great black vessel on fire. Panic, terror and confusion flooded the scene. Friend or foe, none knew as everyone fled to safety. No one knows who these attackers were. Or what they sought. Or what they looked like. Some asserted that they were very tall and wielded their bows and weapons with great skills. Others claimed seeing one giant with flashing eyes, slashing the bonds of those slaves captured by the black sailors. A few even insisted that they saw pointed ears. Yet the nature of witnesses are known, people only see what they want to see. Don't they? Don't they?

Patience in the face of outrage is hard... but it can be learned when example is given. Bellaegis watches Elladan as he checks his bow, then his eyes turn to his own, his gloved thumb running along the string from horn to nocking-point. He remains silent and, but for that motion, still as the stones around them.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Caius steps back and grins. ""Oooooh! Look at that, she's feisty! Full of life! Just wait until you've got her at home, pulling weeds in your garden!""

Zadok, rubbing his head, moaning, and cursing, brightens up at the sight of the woman's ankle. ""She's a wild one, that girl. A mite bit of fun to tame, I say!"" The lust in his eyes is unmistakable.

Darrith laughs heartily at the woman's little speech. ""Haw! I like the spirit on this one! Seven florins!

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
The leathern package disappears at Eithaforn's warning, and Tinduial straightens and tucks her chin downward, masking her pale features 'neath the cowl of the cloak. The folds at the level of her hip shift, her hands putting something away...or taking it out.

The weary rider pushes on, increasing the distance between him and the crowd and simultaneously decreasing the distance between him and the gates -- and the concealed Ranger's therin. 

As he reaches the shadow of the gate the rider opens his mouth and speaks, the words which come out of it in ancient Sindarin of all languages! ""Savages."" Comes the low murmur, barely carrying, and the stranger makes to ride on. 

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Caius points at Darrith, ""There's a brave man, and wise too! Who will show their own wisdom and let me say eight!?""
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Gilredil's impassive expression turns to the slightest frown at Thangil's taunting remarks. The ancient warrior glances once at Elladan, then towards the oxen. He remains still. His bow has been in hand for some time, but he waits with arrows still in his quiver.
Long distance to Taphene: Ryanne waited and dragged as long as she could fer ye but today was last day when people could RP :)

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
""Eight silver dimes!"" says Zadok, still rubbing his head from his position on the ground. ""She's worth eight to me!"" He waves his hands wildly for the auctioneer to see him.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Eithaforn keeps his eyes fixed on the auction, but his body visibly tenses at the Elvish outcry, as though he feared they were discovered. He remains mute and motionless, however, almost like a statue, or a part of the natural landscape.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
""Brave man? Wise? When she threatens? Ye surely a trader."" mocks Corey as he makes the next bid, ""I say only a moron would and I am an idiot, eight.""

The auctioneer looks at Zadok with something akin to amusement. ""Eight F-L-O-R-I-N-S! I think that rock upside the head ruined your good sense, sir. Ah there we are, eight florins. Nine? Will anyone say nine?""

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Tinduial turns her head to look at the man who made the familiar words, not yet knowing enough to remain still. She freezes in place. Would they be discovered and a hue and cry roused?

A muscle at Elladan's jaw tightens, relaxes at Thangil's remarks. Again, silence from the warrior. He waits. And everything about his leonine frame speaks of tension, like a a bow string pulled and held.... says that he will not move from his father's side. Not this time. Not again.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Having got distracted, Barker looks up at the auction, looking around at the woman in question. ""Uhm...nine."" He calls out loudly.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Elrond steps away from the wall, ""Peace Thangil, save your barbs for those who will receive them best. Those who have bows should prepare some pitch on their arrow heads if they have not already. Fighting a fire will slow the progress of the corsair ship."" He murmurs again to the oxen, and with a loud, disconcertingly loud, noise they begin to move forward, slack ropes whipping taut, the ancient gears beginning to move with time once more.



<b>(Auction Area)</b>
""Ten!"" bellows Darrith. He glares savagely at Corey. When no suitable insult comes to mind, the large man decideds to rely on intimidation and puffs himself up, trying keep eye contact with his heckler.

The new bid comes soon after the last and Caius perks up at what could be a good quickening of the pace. ""Nine, can I say ten? Will anyone give me ten for this fiery woman! You saw her pretty little ankle! There we are, ten! Eleven! Will anyone say eleven?""

The captain tenses, as if something is making him uneasy indeed. Did he see ripples in the water?

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Having remained silent to this point, Caedhel remains as such, but nods at the Herdir's orders. He knows the time and place for his discussion is passed and so he lifts up his longbow, a gentle wooden curve with taught string already pulled across it. The elf's hand strokes it softly as he murmurs under his breath. His quiver he shifts to his waist for easier drawing, the first arrow he lifts he begins to cover with pitch, setting it aside as he prepares another.

No matter how well built, how strong the iron, gears which have mouldered for aeons are not silent when moved once more from their long rest. They screech! They sound as the rending of stone from stone, and turn but slowly to take up slack long left to the ravages of time. Slowly, with a sound that would make a troll cringe and cover his ears, the ancient winch begins to turn; and from across the river, its brother gives an answering shriek. 
 
And something stirs beneath the waters of the river, a small ripple from the very edge of the towers where each meets the river's rush... 

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
The captain frowns and turns quietly to the sailor beside him. ""Get everyone but the minimum for security on the ship,"" he replies. ""Something's not right here. Quick about it, and quiet.""

The sailor freezes, knowing his captain's ways, then rushes up the gangplank, whispering to the sailors nearest the drawbridge.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Bellaegis turns at the words and the noise. Quickly he steps forward, pulling arrows in a bundle from their quiver. A bucket against the southern wall still holds pitch, enough to quickly coat the heads... four... five... six... the rest remain in place, ready to fly at other targets. He straightens and moves to the others, motions swift and fluid.

Another Elf, unnoticed by most so far, suddenly becomes a blur of motion.

Gwartad is naught but an angelic, pale face, devoid of emotion, floating above clothes that make him hard to pick out of the crowd.
Somehow, a bow appears, arrow prepared as Elrond instructed. The blur becomes solid: an Elf on one knee, aiming in a degree of 45 degrees upwards.
The breeze picks up, and the angle becomes 50.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Several sailors get back on the ship. The captain meanwhile has quietly gone to the stern, where the ship's anchor is. He keeps glancing downriver, as if still not sure what is going on, but nervous.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Elladan takes a handful of arrows and dips them in the pitch. A glance at his father... And then he proceeds to the wall where a white bird, caged, sits. Another glance.... and he opens the cage. The bird flutters forth, like a dove flushed from a ruin... It soars high above the crowd..... Grace in a place of disgrace. And signal for those who watch.....

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Minimum security is called for down around the auction, and some begin to get back aboard. Salim is not one of them, though, remaining down before the crowd, scimitar still in hand to make sure that no one tries anything sneaky. He eyes every one of them, never watching what they are bidding on. He has no interest.

With slow, ponderous steps the head of the oxen breach the gaping exit of the tower. Thangil, still wtihin, bends his bow and fires off thick hafted arrow that sings deep throated, it's burnished point gleaming in the morning sun as it arcs above the river.

Then, the sounds of oxen ring out from the tower opposite the river. Slowly, a heavy green line, choked with reeds begins to surface. Either end slithers into the base of the towers.

The Shield of Gil-Galad makes then to follow the oxen.

Muttering curses under his breath, Zadok climbs to his feet and marches back toward the ship. ""Weren't worth that much!"" he says again as he passes out of ear range.

""ATTACK! ATTACK! OFFSHORE!"" shouts the captain, drawing his scimitar and hacking at the cable. ""ALL MEN ABOARD!""

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
As the oxen go to their work, Saidonnen takes a strung longbow from her back, then reaches out to dip her own arrows in pitch. She steps past the oxen, breaking cover of the tower wall and bends to fan a hidden coal into flame. A moment later, she lifts a torch full aflame, sticks it into the wall, then nocks an arrow. 
 
And still another moment, a breath, a heartbeat, and her first arrow is alight and winging its way toward the vulnerable sails of the Terondis! 

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
The rider turns as the sounds of attack greet his ears. Momentarily his hand shifts to his side, as though expecting to find something there, but he only shakes his head and, with a moment's more glance at the ambushed auction, continues to ride away from it and into the ruins of Tharbad. 

The lore of Numenor has remained true when the hearts of men failed. The ancient, mighty cable that for so long protected Tharbad rises into the sun and wind once more.

A bird flutters into the noonday-sky. White. Alone. And from the abandoned tower, a long-forgotten relic of defenses long since unmanned.

""That is the signal,"" Eithaforn states, without regard for stealth or silence this time. He quickly tosses a cloak which until now concealed two longbows and an earthen jar of arrows tipped with pitch. A few embers retrieved from the previous night's cooking fire still smolder, and with these Eithaforn ignites his arrow, stands, and aims for the Corsair ship, soon to become a floating funeral pyre, if the Valar will it. He releases the arrow into the sky and grabs for another.

All this without so much as a look at the mounted man who startled him so only a moment before. Such things cannot be helped.

An ear-splitting squeal of ancient metal-works slides up the scale, and Lerrik's impassive face twists. His sword shlips from its scabbard with a faint hiss, and he begins to edge backwards through the crowd.

Caius hears the captain calling from the ship and he responses to the call immediately. ""Come with me,"" he whispers to Anelle as he starts pulling her toward the ship, grabbing at her waist.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Another arrow is lit, and Bellaegis strides forward two steps to stand alongside Saidonnen. The string signs out sharply and slaps the recurved ends of the hunting bow. A second flame arcs through the sky toward the deck of the rocking ship.

Elladan's arrows are stacked beside him. With cold, emotionless grace he takes up a missle, nocs it to his bow, touches the point to the torch flame.... and lets fly. It trail's behind the others, flying pheonix like toward the ship.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
The anchor comes free, and pulled by the current the ship begins to move, slowly at first. The captain leaps for the tiller. A fire arrow hits the sails and a flame goes up. Several sailors rush to oars, and begin to pull.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
The Authavron Caedhel relaxes his body and readies himself. A small ember upon the floor he approaches and lifting his relaxed bow he prepares his arrow, the flame ignites upon the tip and the archer draws back the bow, waiting upon the order. His aim practised and ready, his body taut as the string. With a snap, the arrow is loosed. The path it takes a long arcing one through the air, coming down toward the ship.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Barker blinks in surprise at the sound of some sort of attack. He reaches to draw his own weapon before making his way through the crowd, trying to escape from the attack.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Tinduial grasps the bow brought for her, and knocking the heavy arrows onto the string, she draws, muscles trembling, and looses. It arcs toward the ships like many others that light up the wintery sky. A beacon for all. It is mere seconds before a second is grabbed, two in the air before a third is reached for.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
With the Captain's call, Salim is dashing aboard the vessel, scimitar at the ready, watching as flaming arrows soar through the air to strik their sails. ""Water!"" he cries. ""Water on the fire!"" He is instantly roving to find a bucket of any sort.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Saidonnen lights another arrow, sending it flying before looking over her shoulder. There it is. Across the river, dripping with mud and slimed with waterweed, the great boom-chain of Tharbad! Slowly it rises, each inch closing the jaws of the trap sprung upon the Terondis. 

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Corey puts up his arm, ""El--- Wot in Kiern's name..?"" He turns towards the source of that horrendous screech and for a moment is stunned. A long moment that allows the attackers to release feathered volleys into the crowd, ""<Dunael> Take cover! Take cover!"" Cursing the large man charges towards the barrels, his men scattering, one screaming as he sees the raising of chains. Affey ducks and dodging others who race for shelter, while heading towards the river, to where the woman Anelle is being dragged by Caius, his arm around the tall woman's waist. He unsheathes his axe from his belt, ""<Dunael> Hold, ye son of a ***! Get yer own woman!"" He leaps forward swinging at the northern.

Elves! 

Elves emerge from the tower, following the Ranger's stride. One amongst them drops a grey hood from his head. Upon his brow gleams a bright stone, it shines in the morning light. Silently, he raises a great bow, an arrow burns upon its string.

Grimly Thangil bends his weapon and sends the burning barb forth. It leaves a streak of black smoke in its wake. It wings for the rigging of the ship beyond, the Terondis.

It is a burning messenger. The message that it sings is one of fiery death.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Sailors race for the ship, leaving captives forgotten behind, jumping off the gangplank as it disintegrates, ripping apart ... some fall in the water, scrambling up the sides. Not all may make it onto the ship in time ... and now the ship breaks free, heading straight down the center of the channel, picking up speed, but flames leap up from the mast.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Gilredil lights one of his arrows, then raises his bow and nocks the flaming shaft. The Eldar soldier takes bead on ship, then releases. *Twang* The flaming arrows shoots through the air with fury. Less than a second passes and another arrow is lit, nocked, and fired in quick succession.

Caedhel looks upon the ship he is targeting and looks at the sailors who are gathering water. With a grim nod he grips another arrow and sets it alight. This time his aim is straight, taking aim at the captain who is calling for water. *snap* The flaming barb heading toward either man or ship, the elf cares not which.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
The chaos has turned Darrith around, his confusion is evident as all he seems to be doing is turning in circles. He reaches to his belt, pulling a rather nasty looking club from his belt. He roars at nothing in particular, arrows striking around him.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
In the pale light of winter's sun, flames fly like embers called down from the heavens. The stars throw down their spears upon the Terondis. Smoke rises, tendrils curling 'round the sails and mast.

Eithaforn releases his third arrow toward the fleeing ship's rigging and grabs for a fourth. ""Come on. They're going to get away. That chain is taking an eternity!""

But still he keeps shooting.

Elrond pitches his voice calmly between the metallic shriek of the winch and the cries of the corsairs, ""Look for our chance to secure the slaves."" He then looks to the river where water seethes and roils around the rising mass of the boom as it surfaces from the river.

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
The sudden appearance of Affey does not stun Caius. Indeed, as the man charges, the northerner tightens his grip on Anelle and bracing her against his planted leg, he pivots her around to face Affey. Another arm comes up and around the woman's chest, holding her close as Caius continues to back his way toward the ship, which is not now far off.

The square is full of shouting, bewildered people; all shouting. Lerrik holds his blade up and shoves a man out of his way. But in the confusion, he too has gotten turned around - he is heading more towards the ship than away from it.

<b>(Somewhere close by)</b>
Already out of the confusion before it began, the strange new arrival on his horse only keeps on moving. Soon he disappears into the ruins, content for now to leave the madness behind him. 

<b>(Auction Area)</b>
Her expression of despair lights up as hope races through at the sight of the Dunlending racing towards her, stranger he is to her eyes but better this stranger than the devil that holds her in his embrace. Anelle starts to struggle, her feet digging into the stony ground underfoot, as her hands reaches out to rack Caius's face and hands. ""<Dunael> Let go of me, ye dogfaced man!""

Caius ducks his face away from Anelle's hands. ""Come on now, lass. You'll like it on the ship with me."" The dragging has slowed as she fights, but Caius is not about to lose what he's claiming as his.

Darrith stumbles a bit as an unseen man pushes him in the back. He roars again, this time swinging his club about in a foolish manner in the hopes of catching his ""assailant"". He glares about for a second before rushing off toward the ship where HIS (or what he thinks is his) woman is being loaded up. ""I be winning that one!"" The large man shouts as he runs, knocking people out of his way.

Letting herself go limp, Anelle attempts to slow her new abductor, her eyes only on Corey as her feet kicks and digs into the ancient dirt, old stone revealing wetly against the caked debris while Affey pants behind, grimfaced with his axe swinging in pace with his steps. The cries of the second pursuer echoes close, a few steps behind where Caius manhandles the Dunlending woman, using her body as a human shield. 

""<Dunael> Ye die now, ye filthy, slimy, mangy dog!"" Her skirt is caught underfoot and it rips. More bare legs revealed yet that frees the Dunlending woman from her confining folds and her legs kick back at Caius.

An arrow comes within inches of the captain, hitting the desk and bouncing off into the water. A burning arrow. He swears.


Elrond pitches his voice calmly between the metallic shriek of the winch and the cries of the corsairs, ""Look for our chance to secure the slaves."" Then there is the sudden clang! and the gears grind to a halt. The chain remains suspended under the river.

Caius takes a good kick to his shins and he about drops the limp woman as she sags in his arms. While Affey and Corey near, the northerner looks back over his shoulder to see his path to the ship and suddenly he gasps. WHERE'S THE GANGPLANK???

Letting go of the woman and giving her a swift kick to her backside to send her sprawling toward her menfolk, the northerner turns and sets off at a dead run, headed for the river, his scabbard banging against his side.

Elladan creates a steady rhythm of fire. Arrow after arrow in metonymic precision as he follows beside the Herdir, inseperable shadow. If he cannot stop his father's rashness, he will defend his person to the uttermost. ""Yes. And when the slaves are secured, we leave.""

Bellaegis has let loose another flaming dart, and turns now to look toward the gates. ""The slavers have fired on the crowd. A few are dragging captives toward the ship. The captives resist."" His voice carries low and clear over the twang of bowstrings, the hiss of pitch, the wrack and groan of chain and windlass. The oxen strain, their breath clouding in the cold air, but the yoke remains unmoving.

The ship is now in the center of the channel, then suddenly there is a grinding sound and it shudders as it strikes the chain. ""A chain!"" the captain says as if it is a personal insult. ""Someone get an axe! And get those fires out! Now!""

Lerrik skids a little, his boots slipping on the stones, and looks up. He is closer to the ship... with an unvoiced curse, he turns around and begins shoving his way through the crowd again.

Gilredil matches Elladan in action, if not also in mindset, as he continues to rain fiery arrows over the ship. The warrior's features remain impassive, showing little, except calm and resolve.

A frown crosses Caedhel's face as he takes aim at the Captain again, this time he fires again, loosing the arrow with a snap of his bowstring. The glinting metal shooting through the air swift as can be.

The captain pulls the tiller frantically. ""Row! Row!"" he shouts. And the sailors row, the ship bobbing up and down as the chain holds for now ... but the teeth of the gears make the sound of straining metal.

Arrows spent, Gwartad stands up in a fluent motion and speeds towards the ship and the ones making for it. As he comes up behind Lerrik, he puts his left hand out, trying to turn him, perhaps, but the man turns himself - only to find Gwartad crashing into him.

Saidonnen sends her last arrow flaming toward the ship's rigging, then stows her longbow back inside the tower. Drawing her blade, she sprints away from the wall toward the plain, where all is confusion. ""Elendil! Rangers to me!"" She holds her sword aloft, and plunges toward the fray, eager for the blood of those who would traffic in innocent flesh. 

Lost in the groans of tortured metal is the clean ring of Elrond's drawn sword. With swift steps he leaps outside past the heaving oxen running into the swirling mass of people, ""<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>""

Lerrik staggers, his arms windmilling for balance, and snarls at the man who had nearly run him down. ""Out of my way!"" Sunlight flashes down the length of his blade, and he shoves his empty hand towards Gwartad to push him away.

Bellaegis's last pitch-covered arrow is away as well. He looks at the Ranger charging forward, eyes wide, then glances behind him at the sound of the Herdir's voice. At that call he sprints forward, pulling and nocking a clean arrow as he moves into a position to fire upon the retreating slavers. The remains of the sleeve wrapped around his left forearm are stained dark again.

Exhausting his supply of arrows, Eithaforn looks contentedly at the Corsair ship as it blazes. But there is little time for revelry. He casts his bow upon the ground, draws his sword, and charges into the fray even as Saidonnen calls out.

""See to the slaves...."" muttered, barely audible in the chaos of shouts and battle and human folly. With a growl, Elladan leaps after father, pulling Nallakaure from its sheath... bright shing spike of steel. Glacial lion of war, this cat pushes his way forward into the crowd, defending the heart and hope of Imladris.

Caedhel follows Elrond's commands. The longbow returned and a spear brought forth. The tip glittering and deadly in the morning light. He forms up upon the Herdir's side, eyes looking for any foe that thinks to approach the knot of defenders.

Suddenly, on the far shore, something gives in the old mechanism, and the chain begins to sink back into the water, moving slowly down like a great snake.

Stumbling, the Dunlending woman crashes into the ground, arms and legs windmilling as she slides to a stop. Anelle scrambles back to her feet, dirt and mud covering her front and blood staining her jaw where stone had scraped the skin off. She sucks and spits the blood from her cut lip, her eyes fiery and she growls at Corey, ""<Dunael> Give me yer dagger! No one treats me like this and live!"" 

Slowing his steps, Affey chuckles as he draws his knife, handling that over, his grin of admiration. Hefting the long length of dull metal, Anelle grunts her thanks and then turns to search for those who had tormented her these long months of captivity.

The Elf takes the man's hand, a gesture of friendship or oath under normal circumstances, but this time, Gwartad pulls hard - pulling him past himself and speeding him on, away from the ship. The lithe figure jumps through the air with the momentum gained by this episode, only to find that what he was looking for is gone.

It is pandemonium, and amidst chaos, smoke and screams he skids to a halt. He stands perfectly still, until he hears a clear voice calling out.

Tinduial cast aside her bow and drew her longsword. At the cry of Saidonnen, she took off at a run, following Eithaforn as close as she may.

In the crowd, Toal leads the rest of Corey Affey's man, attempting to smash their way back to their leader who is standing beside the Dunlending woman who had just recently been offered for auction.

Not looking back, Caius hits the water and starts swimming as best he can, encumbered by his sword and clothing and the fact that he barely knows how to swim.

Gilredil frowns as Elrond calls the charge, but he immediately puts up his bow. Then his sword is out. The frown fades and then his face hardens again. He moves with Caedhel and Elladan, but his eyes scan through the crowd, as if looking for something. His attention to the surroundings is not lost to this search however.

Tirloth, having no arrows in the first place, rushes to Elrond's call. She joins the group of elven defenders, swinging spear keeping a wide distance between self and attackers, if any. 

Joining with her kinsmen, Saidonnen brandishes her blade at the nearest of the would-be buyers. ""Begone from this place, and never return, vile heathen!"" she calls out as she forces her way to the block. ""These folk are free and in our protection!"" She gestures to Eithaforn and Tinduial as she reaches the edge of the thing, the stage for such humiliation and vile avarice. 

Captain Ishrac staggers as one of the arrows fired his direction embeds itself in his thigh. Raging in pain and at the damage caused to his ship he glares angrily towards those on the shore.

""Ballista!"" he roars and a few of the crew make their way towards the heavy weapon. ""Fire on those maggots until we can get ourselves free!""

Eithaforn stands between the buyers and the two female Rangers, placing them between himself and the freed slaves. He merely points his sword at them, as though daring one to interfere.

Elrond's progress is one of the few clean threads in a chaotic weave. He makes his way directly toward where the slaves are, using his sword only a few times, and then only with the flat of the blade rather than the edge. He motions to those of his folk who follow to secure a sure exit away from the river.

Bellaegis'bow is drawn back, his right hand beside his face, but he does not shoot. The head of the arrow flashes in the light as it jerks back and forth, tracking first one target, then another. The crowd surges back and forth, friend and foe mixed and mingled. No clear shot, yet... patience...

... and the movement and call from the ship rewards him. He pivots, raising his bow higher, changing the arc as draws him aim toward those on deck.

Darrith snarls at the sight of the hated elves. He pulls up next to his fellow Dunlendings, looking to them for support in the battle. ""Aye, a fine mess we be having here, eh?"" he pants, the effort of making it through the crowd showing its strain.

Lerrik had intended to shove the other out of the way, but finds his hand grabbed and himself half-pulled, half-pushed past two other men. He growls, low in his throat, and turns as if to revenge himself... but Gwartad is past and gone. Anger distorts the man's face as he turns again, trying to make the edge of the crowd and escape.

The ship begins slowly to grind forward as the chain lowers into the water

Caedhel draws his spear into a ready position and makes way to do just as Elrond wishes. But his eyes return often to the Father and the Son. The Authavron moves forward, spear at the ready, but the elven numbers is not large enough to spread out very far, and so he prepares himself to escort the slaves as they exit.

There is a groaning sound from the other side of the river, as the gears that hold that end of the chain begin to slip.

Caius swims for all he's worth, but he's tiring fast and his pitiful little doggy paddle is not very effective. The man gasps as he opens his mouth to call for a line and instead catches a mouthful of river water.

Elladan does not use the flat of his blade. He uses his broad shoulders, feels the crack of mail upon bone and flesh as he shoves and tackles and clears a path for his father. A wild eyed man approaches, running headlong and mad dash toward the Herdir... he meets the hard pommel of Elladan's sword in his gut and crumbles.... ""The horses! Clear a way toward the horses!"" His cry to the Tirith present....

Several sailors are in the water, swimming to try to make it to the ship befor they are stranded here in this hostile country, having dropped their weapons and just struck out in utter panic. At the rear of the ship, several sailors throw out lines toward them, though it's a dicy business. Lucky if they get half of them on board.

The string snaps hard against the horns of the recurve bow as it is released. Bellaegis's arrow, cold iron rather than hot pitch cutting the air, flies in a low arc toward the sailors struggling to work the ballista.

There is a disturbance in the random movements... purposeful action, not chaotic. But Lerrik doesn't see this, lost as he is in the mass of people. He looks up, orients himself by the tower and heads towards freedom. Safety. An arrow of elves...

Even beneath the water the sound of the hull scraping across the chain can be heard as the Terondis slowly inches its way forward. The ballista is now loaded and the crew searches for a target upon the shore while Ishrac attempts to pull the arrow from his thigh.

The creaking of the gears on the far shore catches the Captain's attention and his eyes draw down slightly. ""There!"" he cries grabbing one of the ballista crewmen. ""See if you can break this cursed chain free!""

His men finally cleared the crowd and they surrounded Corey Affey, eyes darting back and forth in the confusion while those who cause the chaos took the threads of that havoc into their hands. The tall man turns first, staring at the black ship, then at those black-haired individuals who gathered at the auction block. His eyes narrow thoughtfully as he examines their stance and switching back towards the crowd, he spots heads that tower over many still milling and running about. He snorts, ""<Dunael> Come, we leave this madhouse, Toal. This isna our fight, Da was right. Dealing in slaves is bad business. Ye coming with us, lass?"" Without even waiting for Anelle's answer, Corey heads towards the clearest space, attempting to leave the scene. The Dunlending woman follows close behind, the dagger flashing brightly in her hand.

Caius starts to drown as he flails, bobbing, gasping for air each time he broaches the surface. He tires, he weakens. He starts to slip under the waters of the Greyflood... But his hand catches at a line case from the Harad ship and he clings to the lifeline as if it were that Dunlending woman he was so intent on taking with him. Sailors on board start to haul him up...

Sheathing her sword, Saidonnen sets about cutting the bonds of each slave in turn, giving each a push into the chaos that is their best hope for safety. ""Eithaforn! Take Tinduial and make for the temple; free that wretched Navigator and leave him. I will meet you outside of Tharbad when I am done here. Fly!"" 

Caedhel makes his way toward the horses, pushing any who come near out of the way with the wood of his staff. But often as not dodging around them. There are a good number of horses left, and these he sets up to defend from any who would take them, speaking to the beasts in sindarin he tells them of his need, and then turns to defend with his spear.

Elladan sees a short man running toward them as they retreat, panic written across his face, a sword in his hand. His eyes do not leave that man, even as he knocks another down, heal of his left hand shoved hard against his nose.... ""Change course,"" he whispers to the running sword bearer. ""Change course, fool.""

By this time those random Dunlendings who had come to purchase slaves or just watch are stampeding toward the south gate of Tharbad, or into the woods and marshes ... only a small knot of Haradrim sailors who have been well and truly stranded form into a clump to try to defend themselves.

Gwartad runs towards the group of Elves from which came the voice that commands him. He side-steps and ducks, jumps and skids, and it is clear that his earlier accident was a rare moment indeed, for he does not appear to touch anyone. Someone is running in front of him.

As the ballista team whirls the weapon on its new target one of the crew slumps forward with an arrow jutting from his back. ""Over there,"" Ishrac cries as he grabs one of the fished out crew members and shoves his towards the ballista.

""Fire!"" he roars, and the loud click and whirr is heard as a bolt speeds from the ballista in the direction of the gear mechanism.

Eithaforn grabs the young Ranger by the arm and gives her a light shove toward the city. ""Quickly. You can outrun me! Go!""

And the tall Dunadan sprints towards Tharbad.

Indeed, Darrith has used his club more on the people that where at the auction than the ones who have decided to break it up. This continues as he makes his general way away from the elves and the slaves, and more toward safety. He grunts under the effort of moving through the bodies, his club clearing a path in front of him.

Lerrik ducks under the arm of a tall man in front of him, and darts sideways towards what appears to be an opening in the crowd. His sword is held close to his body, but he seems not to care if he hits anyone on the way by. Indeed, his dark eyes are intent on one thing only - the next step away from an auction that has turned into a trap.

The scream of the oxen as the bolt pierces them is nearly as piercing as that of the gears when they finally give way. The oxen, who had struggled greatly to maintain the winches falter and fall, and are dragged around by the weight of the chain sinking back into the mud--this time forever. 

The enslaved were slow to realise that rescue was at hand. Physical and mental exhaustion and no hope has drained their spirit. Yet even in the depths of their inertia, the instinct to self preserve sparks at the sight of their former tormenters in retreat. With a roar, the thin, emancipated men and women burst from their weariness, fleeing their scene, heedless of their rescuers, towards the marshes, towards the ruins, even towards the river.

Caius is hauled up on deck where he is left for dead while the sailors who saved him go to other lines or go off to fight the fire and man the oars....

Freed of the chain, the ship leaps forward, the current bearing it seaward. The upper sails are still aflame.

Tinduial stumbles slightly, but takes to her heels and does as bid, she flees to the temple swiftly.

As the slaves flee to freedom, Saidonnen shoves her dagger into her belt and draws her sword once more. She drops down from the block to stand beside Elladan, watching warily on all sides for the particularly stubborn. 

Gilredil is already moving towards the horses, as soon as he hears Elladan's words. His sword is out, and he uses it with a grace born of centuries and centuries of practice. Mostly, he uses the flat of the blade, however, in combination with a few shoulder strikes, punches, and other non-lethal attacks aimed to intimidate and move more than anything else. ""Away. Away. You do not want to be here."" The large, imposing figure shouts in the common tongue to any foolish enough to cross his path, trying to open a route towards the horses. The elf reaches where Caedhel guards shortly and then continues to try and keep the way clear.

The slaves at first do not comprehend the aid that Elrond seeks to give them, instead their expressions are writ with terror until his sword shears smoothly through their chains. The Half-elven tries to calm them, guide them together, in spite of the tempest of voice and sword around them, the sky stained with smoke from the burning ship and the screams of the oxen.

You paged Eithaforn with 'nitenite and thank ye fer the RP :)'.

Suddenly seeing that they are marooned, the remaining Haradrim run for the woods, panic-stricken.

Straight towards them. Elladan shakes his head. Straight towards them this fool runs, using the narrow opening the elves themselves have created. Elladan hurls himself against the coming Lerrik, the point of Nallaklaure high at the man's throat... held... poised. ""No."" One word. And searing cold of it could scorch the earth.

Saidonnen too raises her blade at Lerrick, from the side and out of Elladan's way. It seems that if one of these men is to fall this day, the Kildeer wishes to see it happen. 

Tirloth pushes about in the crowd, barring milling people with the spear until she reaches the horses. The long pole is extended to keep a cleared radius. 

Having sustained much damage the Terondis makes it way slowly away from the scene. The Captain already searching for somewhere to put in for repairs.

Rocks fly as the wall of the tower burst asunder as the projectile crashes through it. ""-Ware-!"" Bellaegis yells, ducking the flying debris. He has reached Caedhel and skids to a halt, nocking an arrow as he looks back at the ship, which has leaped forward and, yardarm aflame, sails away down the river.

The slaves are free, though driven to far with fear to listen to calm words. Elrond watches them go, gazing over the field, to the river, the ship, and wrecked boom. Then he turns, returns to where his folk await.

In mid-run, Gwartad suddenly goes limp and drops to the ground, rolling on his side over and over, towards the group of Elves. Only the small man stands between him and his folk. As he falls, Gwartad spreads out his arms and stops, landing atop a sword arm.

The Herdir, the slaves, and the other elves have moved ahead. Elladan flicks his gaze toward Saidonnen, lip curled. ""He's yours if you want him. Not worth the time"" And with that, he sprints forward, joining the others to clear the way. The horses ahead... chaos behind.... All in all, they have had a good morning's work.

""I do not want him,"" Saidonnen says, her revulsion clear in the thickness of her voice. ""Begone, flea of a man, and traffic no more in human life."" To punctuate her words, she flicks the tip of Lerrick's nose with the finely honed tip of her sword before leaping over his prone body and making her own way off the field to safety. 
 
That'll leave a scar. 

Something... someone lands on his arm with a crack of bone, and Lerrik grunts, pain whitening his lips. He opens his mouth, gasps once, then seems to relax as the sword at his throat is withdrawn, the one holding it disappears. Too soon... a line of fire burns the end of his nose, and he jerks back, swallowing a groan at the injudicious motion.

With that, Gwartad wearily stands, watching the sword, with the revulsion of a true Silvan. He follows his folk, walking backwards slowly.

The weight is removed, nearly as painfully as it first arrived. Lerrik lies limply for a moment, his hand slack around the sword hilt, then carefully, slowly, pushes himself to his feet, cradling his broken arm against his chest. With an indrawn breath, short and shallow, he bends for the sword, awkwardly sheaths it...
...and scuttles off.

<lj-cut text=""Summary of Scene""> 
The morning of the Auction dawned bright and cold. Rumours about the invite-only auction organized by those who sailed the black ship drew both onlookers and buyers to the scene. The auction square was packed, the bidding fast and furious as men lusted after what was placed on the block. Unbeknownst, eyes that looked upon this commerce in abhorrence were plotting to disrupt the festivities and capture the black ship. 

At the height of the bidding war, there was a horrendous metallic screech and the Dogs of Chaos slipped their leashes. An ancient defense mechanism of Tharbad was raised, arrows of flames released at 'The Terondis', setting that great black vessel on fire. Panic, terror and confusion flooded the scene. Friend or foe, none knew as everyone fled to safety. No one knows who these attackers were. Or what they sought. Or what they looked like. Some asserted that they were very tall and wielded their bows and weapons with great skills. Others claimed seeing one giant with flashing eyes, slashing the bonds of those slaves captured by the black sailors. A few even insisted that they saw pointed ears. Yet the nature of witnesses are known, people only see what they want to see. Don't they? Don't they?

"event","A blizzard blows through the ruins of Tharbad. The snow dancing in the wind, tossing here and there, veiling all save a few steps around any who dares the fury of the snowstorm. Oft, there would be the sound of crashing as the chill breaks even more of the rotting structure of the formerly grand city. A few does dare the snow and the gail, two in fact. Both are well wrapped in layers of cloth though one appeared cold, teeth chattering while the second is impassive.

And through all the white haze of wildly dancing snow -- and most surprisingly over the howling wind that carries the snow into walls that claustrofobically cling around one, -- laughter might be heard. Loud outcries of a nigh maniacle joy, followed by faint words. ""... ... you mean ... do not ... ... weather?"" It seems to be approaching the twain walking.
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

""Wot?!"" exclaims the shivering man, his hand tugging at his collar, attempting and failing to eliminate the draft that chills him, crashing into his companion who halts, squinting to make out the source of the outcries in front of them. 

""Watch it, you moron."" The reprimand issued absently as the second man motions the first forward, ""Find out what that noise is.""

""The fool's on you, Kaymon!"" Again the laughter bursts from not too far away, but now it is obvious from whence it came. Two grey silhouettes stand behind the screen of white. One is rather large, the other of average height. And obviously they have noticed the other two for they have fallen to silence, or at least words which cannot be discerned thus far.

When fainly again a sound comes, it is the earlier voice again -- yet this time not as joyfull and friendly. ""And who be you's?""

The trembling man growls, his voice deepening, ""Wot ye mean who am I? Ye're in Affey's grounds and dinna recognise me? I should be the one asking who ye be!"" There is a sigh of exasperation from the second man yet he still just watches, heedless of the windy fingers plucking at his clothes, the cold not worthy of attention those snow lands and starts to form a white crust over him.

""I d'not give a horsedung for your grounds, Affey."" The voice remarks in return. Then one man begins to approach further and the large man follows. As they both come clearer into sight the front one spits. ""Nay, I d'not recognize the snowman."" The man is hairless and pale from the cold. He does not wear as thick a clothing as he should, but he scarcely seems to care. A large battle axe stands between his right hand and the ground and he leans on it. ""Ghyno's my name. An' my big fellow is Kaymon. Best remember that, Affey."" He grins half toothedly, while the large man comes to stand beside him. This one is covered in layers of wools, unlike his companion. And a large club is strapped to his back.

Snorting, the first man steps even closer, tiny icicles forming on his upper lip while he glares at the other two, ""I ain't Affey, I'm his left hand man, Toal."" He eyes the others's weapons with a smirk, ""Wot, those be toothpicks on yer back and wot do ye that?"" His chin points at the hairless man's axe.

The second man clears his throat, a none-too-gentle reminder of his presence.

""Want me t'pick yer teeth?"" The man who named himself Ghyno glares at Toal for a moment only and then turns to the silent man beside. ""An' you? You be Affey? Ye mind if we walk this land as that one seems t'?"" He gestures with his head to Toal. ""Or expect me t'recognize ye?""

The large man just stands there, silently.

""Ye could -try-."" snickers the first man, ""And I'd stick ye faster than ye could cry out 'Mama'. And I be asking ye, wot ye doing here? Dinna ye know that no one and that's no one gets past unless they've got a special invite to the auction?""

Shrugging, the second man sighs, ""Get on with it, Toal. I don't have all day to meet Affey.""

""You'd stick me, ey?"" Again an outburst of laughter sounds, but now quite closer to actual maniacly than before. ""My mama's been dead long since. You'd never hear me cry 'er name. That'd be the only reason I can think of how ye'd stick me before I'd cry.""

""Now see my scars?"" Indeed, they run everywhere and Ghyno bends his head to especially those on top of his head to Toal. ""There's my invitation, dungbrain."" He still stands unconcerned, though his one uncovered eye seems to flicker with a rage that the painted one beside implies.

Kaymon stands with a deep frown, still watching silently.

Toal splutters and starts to step forward, but the second man commands impatiently, ""Leave it, leave it. There's no time for this. I ..."" White continues to dust all who stands still in the blizzard and there is a hail, an old voice as another whitened figures appears from the foggy clime. 

""Toal? That ye?""

""Ayes, Grandda."" replies the shivering man, glaring at the others, more fiercely at his companion as he steps aside, ""Wot ye doing out in this weather?""

""'Ey, granpa. Nice t'meet ye."" An obvious smirk lifts up Ghyno's lips once more in the cold enduring weather. ""Lost the kid, 'eh?"" He lifts the heavy battle axe and places the hilt upon his shoulder. Then he begins to walk towards the old man. ""Mights be -she- ends up on the auction if she don't watch out, now."" He glances once at the large man, ere he continues on his way towards toal's grandfather.

And Kaymon slowly takes a step backwards and another, starting to disappear into the myst.

Tharbad

Fear was no stranger in Tharbad but lately, especially after the arrival of a black ship, fear had congealed to tar-like thickness within the rotten city. Wild rumours flew of sacrifices, especially after the piteous wailing and screaming that had skewered the air, late last night, from the direction of what had been a religious sanctuary. Though no blood was found, a knife identified as that belonging to Tig Affey (temped by RYANNE) had been found at the foot of a building. The frantic Affeys had sent out men, the search continuing even when the blizzard stormed through the ruins of Tharbad. More strange men, stinking of blood, had slipped into Tharbad, including a familiar scarred man, hairless with a blind eye (temped by BARAIN).

"event","The winter sky is clear and bitter cold, but the stars stand out in stark relief over Tharbad. One could almost forget that Numenor has fallen, and imagine that Varda yet looks on with her cohorts the Valar, drawing a mantle of benevolence over the once-great Dunedain city. 
 
Alas. 'Almost' is not enough. The temple which once glorified the Valar is now in ruins, testament to the weakness of Men. Not all the Faithful are gone, however. One of their daughters walks the temple precincts this night, seeing not the remains of broken men, or the fallen and eroded columns, but something beyond this night of the Third Age, singing almost under her breath in a language long dead. 

""I like that song you sing,"" an ingenuous voice proffers softly, from a lumpy form seated against a crumbling column. Becloaked and becowled, the woman, Tinduial, has her arms folded before her and in the faint light cast by the evening sky, her grey eyes gleam even within the shadows that envelop the rest of her aquiline features.

""What is it?"" comes the query, likely interrupting the reverie of her companion.

The cold snap of banners sound in the wind soaring high above towered windows that glow in the darkness, limning moon silvered walls with warmth, and all is resonant with the distant call of voices, thronging with voices...

So one sees the past as if a living dream he wanders. Something of his vision is in the song he sings softly to himself as he enters the temple. Elrond Half-elven, far from his House in the North, hooded in dove-grey, difficult to spy in the ruined darkness, calls a quiet greeting in Sindarin to the ranger. The song dies, and the city is dead once more. ""I have found something which may aid us, I deem.""

""'Tis said to be of Numenor, though I've no way to prove it."" Saidonnen Broneryn turns with a sad sort of smile as the elf-given vision fades. ""I know not if your blandishments are a gift or a cruelty, Master Elrond,"" she says then, looking past Tinduial toward the Lord of the Valley. ""But come. Tinduial will make a fire, and I will provide something hot to eat while you give your news--and we give ours. There is much to tell, and little time, I deem."" 
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

As the starlight bathes the crumbled pillars and fallen walls of the ruined temple, a tall figure approaches from the north. Despite the starlight afforded by the clear winter skies, the tall figure moves deftly between the shadows, approaching those gathered amongst the ruins unseen.

At the sound of the human female's voice, the tall figure pauses in the shadow cast by a towering archway and his glance darts between those gathered before him. Slowly and quietly he draws a sword from the sheath that sits at his right hip, and using skills learned over years too numerous to count moves silently closer to the small group. His progress, however, is brought to a sudden halt when a familiar voice talks of aid in the Sindarin tongue. Curiosity kills his progress and he listens intently from his hiding place to determine better what transpires before him

Elrond sits upon the base what was once an elaborately worked pillar, ""Nay Saidonnen, I will not say just yet. Tell me your news, that may illumine half-guesses. Too much lies in shadow to my sight here. I will say this: you are right to say that time runs short. The Haradhrim will not stay overlong.""

With deft fingers and silent movements, the young Ranger gathers the tinder and twig necessary to start a small flame. From a hidden pocket is drawn a leather package, and within it a flint. After a few strikes the smallest of flames begins, then brighter and the smokeless fire ekes a faint golden warmth into the cold of the circle. All the while, Tinduial listens, her cowl cast back to better hear and observe.

A crumbled section of the temple wall admits another, clad in a grey of his own, though mottled and stained from years of toil and ill use.

""Saidonnen? Tinduial?"" he asks, tentively, as he rounds a corner to meet his quarry, and their companion. ""Master Elrond,"" the Ranger Eithaforn speaks thus, bowing his head to the Half-elven. ""Forgive the intrusion.""

""In truth,"" Saidonnen replies, while gathering her own necessities, ""It is not mine to tell. My kinsmen--"" she nods once to Tinduial ""--have taken one of the slavers. Mine was not the watch that night, so it is their tale to tell."" 
 
Eithaforn's voice sounds then, and she half turns to face him, nodding to Glintaur in passing. ""Mind the courtesies, brother,"" she says in a low voice. ""We do not want to mark him as a being of importance. But here,"" she goes on, louder, ""are the two who took the captive, and can speak of it to you."" 

Faint light dances in crimson and gold across the hand of Elrond, ""Good even, and welcome Eithaforn. Come tell your news with Tinduial now she has lit a fire to warm it. Speak softly though, for who knows who might be listening?""

Tinduial stands, dusting off her hands. She moves to stand beside Eithaforn, and regards Elrond with solemn features.

""A navigator, Master Elrond,"" she utters quietly, ""One who guides them. He is unconscious in our care."" The latter is uttered with the faintest hint of wryness to her tone.

From his concealed spot amongst the shadows the tall elf listens intently to the conversation between the elf and the dunedain. As a small, well concealed, fire is lit and another ranger enters from the shadows, the tall elf re-sheathes his longsword and steps into the silvery light that bathes the campsite.

""Mae govannen, mellyn"" he says in a slightly lilting voice, pausing before continuing in sindarin, ""Such an auspicious company is not what I expected to find here and abouts when Hir Cirdan sent me investigate!"" Chuckling a little he says in Sindarin ""I did not realise the situation was so dire as to require your personal attention, Elrond. If I had known you had left your cellars unguarded, I would have rounded up Gildor and taken a slight detour via Imladris! But seriously, happy I am to meet allies in such a hostile locale"".

""Of course,"" Eithaforn nods to Saidonnen. He leans against a pillar, long since crumbled to rubble, leaving a stump about waist-high.

""Tinduial speaks truly. He is secure, and when he regains consciousness I intend to--"" here the Ranger pauses, seeking the correct word ""--question him.

""Mae govannen,"" he replies in kind as Glintaur makes his presence known.

Poised in the act of adding dried meat and vegetables to a battered pot, Saidonnen looks sharply at Eithaforn, just once. But she says nothing as she heaps clean snow over the dried provender, then moves to pot to a place over the fire. ""Not so refreshing as lembas,"" she remarks to no one in particular, ""but it warms the belly better."" 
 
That said and done, she sits back on her heels, her mantle shifting to cover the lower part of her head. ""We have also determined that it is as I feared; they mean to take slaves. This navigator intends selling Dunlending captives to the Corsairs at auction."" 

Elrond listens to the two rangers in silence, his grey gaze upon them, when Glintaur enters, and amusement leavens his rich voice, ""Do you think I would have left Imladris, and my wine cellar unguarded otherwise? You will find my hospitality the lessor here, but we shall try to make do. Come, Eithaforn and Tinduial have word that will greatly interest Cirdan. Has your captive a name, and in what circumstances did you find him?"" The last is said to the rangers, said gravely after Saidonnen's mention of slavers.

Nodding at the words of the Saidonnen, Glintaur's demeanor turns more serious and he adds briefly in Sindarin, ""My Lord has heard similar reports and our mariners have noted increased hostile activity along the coastline by men from the south. It is such news that resulted in him sending me and a few of our brethren to investigate. Those I travel with are camped towards the Grey Flood, but my intuition guided me to search amongst these ruins to look for clues. Little did I expect to find you all camped here!""

At Elrond's words a wry smile crosses the the tall elf's face but not wanting to interrupt further, he silently joins those gathered around the fire.

""We heard no name, Master Elrond,"" Tinduial replies quietly, as seems to be her want, ""We had to take him quickly and quietly lest he alert others to our presence. And our methods were...swift and decisive."" She folds her hands behind her back, glancing at Eithaforn for confirmation.

[Ryanne]
Shadow upon shadows waver in the dark night, the ruined nightscape palely lit by the silvery moon outside the decaying temple. The flames though concealed within the ruined temple casts a golden glow, stray light twinkling through eroded gaps in the stony walls. Few wander alone after the setting of the sun, the humans setting watch in their quarters they claimed for their own yet tonight this stray is espied by a pair of curious young eyes. 

[Ryanne]
Cautiously, warily, a slight form had crept forward, inching its way along the roofs of buildings until it lays across from where gray wraiths had slipped into the ancient sanctuary. Like a moth towards a flame, the figure squirms forward stopping only when it hears voices. Bird-like, the head angles back and forth in intent observation with each scrap of sound that escapes upwards.

""We caught him at unawares,"" Eithaforn says, and deigns to comment no more upon that subject. ""They have probably missed him by now, and will be looking for him. They have people tied up on the ship; you can hear their cries for help hundreds of yards away. They must be freed, one way or another.""

He sniffs at the air. ""That smells good,"" he murmurs, noticing for the first time today, perhaps, the rumblings of a large man's stomach.

[Elrond] 
The echo of wings haunts tumbled stone and the black stare of empty casements in upper reaches of the temple.

""Do you know where the auction will be held, and at which time? Would the auction be held on the ship? If not, we need to discover these answers,"" Elrond says.

""Within days, but this is all we know."" Saidonnen stirs the crude stew with a wooden spoon from her pack--a much stained and battered utensil, with a splintered handle. ""I presume that our captive will have been missed, and it may stall things. We maintain a watch upon the docks, and listen to whatever we can."" 

Tinduial adds her own quiet observation, ""It is hoped that we can find all we need to know in the next few hours. The bump he took was not so great as to leave him unconscious for so long. Then we might have the chance to stop what is happening.""

As a small, errant, cloud drifts across the moon significantly reducing the silvery light that bathes the campsite, Glintaur stands smoothly and unslings the pack from his back and places it quietly infront of him. After taking the opportunity to cast his watchful eye around the ruined temple surrounding them, he once again takes a seat close to Elrond, his left hand still grasping his large bow, ready for any threat that should befall the camp.

A set of wooden cups, rugged but cleverly carved to stack neatly and compactly, emerges from the Kildeer's pack. Saidonnen, silent for the nonce, ladles the steaming stew into each one. ""The meat will not have softened yet, but the watch is long and I will eat my own arm if I do not serve it now,"" she says apologetically, holding the first cup to Elrond. 
 
As the cups make the rounds, she says musingly, ""Something troubles me, Master Elrond. We are pledged to protect the folk of Eriador and elsewhere, and I know that such charity as we possess should not exclude the folk of Dunland. But in my heart, I begrudge the time spent saving them from slavery, knowing what they are."" 

""He should be stirring in an hour or two, if he is like others I have apprehended,"" Eithaforn concurs with Tinduial's assessment--rather absent-mindedly, it would seem, for his grey eyes are turned at the stewpot Saidonnen now ladles.

""Oh!"" the Ranger exclaims, as a thought enters his mind. ""The Haradrim showed no knowledge of the Eldar, Master Elrond. I am certain they outnumber us--I shall have it confirmed shortly--but perhaps there is a way we can this can be turned to an advantage?""

Idle musings? Perhaps.

Elrond takes the cup with an inclination his head, his eyes bright with the depths of his hood, ""What they are? They are your kin, whose ancestors fell under a Shadow to which the Enemy was but a servant. It is true they lacked the faith, and courage of your own ancestors, yet they are worthy of pity. Whether they are in bondage to iron chain or iron lies, they deserve to be freed. Can you say, here in the ruins of Cardolan, that even the Dunedain could not be led astray?""

A long moment of silence.

Then, ""My folk will be searching for me; it would be well if one of you watch the northern walls for them for we will need aid. You said the slaves must be freed Eithaforn, and this we will attempt. Have you spied any small river craft that we might use?""

The eyes of the watcher drifts slowly across the campsite, counting, counting, the head slanting when it spots a still body. The head drops back into hiding when the tallest one stands and makes its way towards a seated form. And slowly it lifts again when no alarm was given, large eyes peeking over the edge of the roof, to examine that last seen target. A faint gasp inhaled, quickly stifled by a small hand over its mouth, the head ducks down again.

Saidonnen only bends her head in response to Elrond; indeed, there can be no reply. But it is not taken grudgingly, nay, nor sullenly. It is only accepted, and in the next moment, the Kildeer glances upward once before tending to her task and leaving Eithaforn to answer as she hands cups to him and to Tinduial. Finally, then, she is left to her own, and she raises it gratefully to her lips. 

Glintaur listens intently to the discussion and adds in Sindarin, ""I have 5 Raindir with me, and news that Hir Gildor is making his way in this direction. However, he may arrive too late to be included in any plans we make.""

Tinduial takes the proffered cup as her stomach growls in a most unladylike manner.

""My thanks,"" she nods and brings the repast to her lips to partake. It is with interest in her bright gaze that she observes the elvenkind go about their business.

Glintaur says in Bethteur, ""<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>""

Elrond murmurs, ""<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>""

Eithaforn grasps the proffered cup of stew and takes a first mouthful hungrily. ""Thank you, Saidonnen.""

The edge taken off his stomach pangs, he considers. ""We have a small dinghy near the collapsed bridge. It is how we snuck across and snatched our captive. Enough room for five elves, though it may be a tight fit. I could probably turn up something else servicable to the task given a few hours to scavenge, but, as has been said, time is short.

""This prompts me, also, to venture to comment upon such plans as be made for the rescue of the would-be slaves,"" Eithaforn nods to Glintaur, ""Master Glintaur. How comfortable are you and your edhil with deception? I beg you to humor me--my proposal may be the inane ramblings of wandering the Wild by my lonesome for too long, but I feel compelled to propose it nonetheless.""

Saidonnen's brow creases at the strange tongue, but she says nothing of it. ""What sort of deception, Eithaforn? We all practice it, after a fashion, when we must go abroad in the world..."" 

Mumbling unintelligably to himself, Glintaur gets to his feet and stretches his back a little as though he is working out some kinks in his long spine. In sindarin he says ""Age works tirelessly on my mind these days and I realise that I left some of my belongings at the foot of the archway when I first approached this camp not knowing who inhabited it. Let me go and retieve them before we make any steadfast plans.""

Not taking the time to acknowledge Eithaforn's question, the tall elf skulks quickly out of the light of the campsite, soon disappearing back in the direction from which he originally appeared.

""Say on, Eithaforn,"" says Elrond, and the timbre of his voice alters to a lighter note, ""A Silvan is not unused to deception.""

While waiting for Eithaforn to expose his plan, Saidonnen watches Glintaur's abrupt departure with a furrowed brow. She listens, it is clear, but she also watches the shadows for the elf's return with a keen eye. 

As the tallest form stands, the watcher dips its head again, pressing its face against the rough stone of its post. As the voices muttered on fluidly, its tension ebbs and once more, the eyes lifts, puzzledly searching when it finds one missing from the camp.

Tinduial stands in silence, eyes darting from one to the other, following Glintaur from the camp, then to Elrond's reply and finally waiting for Eithaforn to reveal his plan.

Eithaforn cuts short mid-sentence as Glintaur makes a hasty exit, and he glances to Saidonnen and Tinduial, probably to see if they share in his befuddlement.

Elrond's words are heeded, however, and he makes his first, tentative suggstion. ""This hinges upon what we may learn from our prisoner,"" Eithaforn disclaims, ""yet from the conversation of the slavers, Elves seemed entirely unknown to the foul Southrons. One threatened to bring the slaves to one of your homes--Imladris, Mithlond; I am not sure--because they would surely fetch a pretty price. We send Glintaur and few of his kith in as potential buyers, to begin with.""

The Half-elven listens, almost a statue he seems he is so still, awaiting to hear all of Eithaforn's plan.

""We three will stay out of sight until the time comes to create some sort of diversion--perhaps we sprinkle the ground with pitch the night before and then ignite it; I am not entirely certain of the diversion yet--and occupy their fighters, who will surely run for us, and hopefully weakening resistance around the slaves enough to allow Glintaur and the others to free them and make an escape.""

Thus Eithaforn finishes this rough outline of his plan, and he gazes intently at the statuesque quendi, forgetting fot he moment even his meal.

The few wispy clouds that float in the otherwise clear and star-filled sky begin to coalesce, blocking the moon's silvery glow from the ruins of the old temple and its environs. A slight breeze picks up from the south bringing with it a hint of salty air from the nearby marshes. The otherwise quiet night is disturbed by the rustling of leaves as they are blown around in strange eddies caused by the pillars and broken walls

A screech cuts through the silence as a nighttime hunter captures its prey and a dark shadow slowly and noiselessly climbs up the wall of a nearby building. As its cloaked head breaks the roofline and peers towards the direction of the camp, the silhouette of a small figure laying on the roof is revealed by the pale light of the campfire below. Climbing onto the roof, the cloaked figure slowly and smoothly nocks an arrow in the bow it carries in its left hand. Moving with a stealth learned over millenia of fighting dark forces, the figure approaches the supine form.

 ""So what have we here?"" He says in the tongue of man.

""It is true that we are few, and likely outnumbered. We will keep watch upon the road for your kin, Master El..."" Saidonnen pauses, tuning briskly round and rising to her feet with the grace of a cat, hand already on sword. ""They come now like cockroaches from the very walls,"" she remarks in fluid Westron, gazing blindly up in the direction of Glintaur's voice. 

Tinduial sets her cup upon a tumbled stone block, somewhat regretfully, as Glintaur and Saidonnen capture her attention with words of warning carried softly on the night air. Her hand reaches for the dagger that sets at her hip. Her bow unstrung as it was in her pack on the ground.

Glintaur unwields Kelebguruth.
Glintaur wields Bow of the Nandor.

The only one who does not move, who does not start, is Elrond. He remains seated deep in thought. Presently he says, ""Surprise is important. Yet, what you have outlaid is of great risk for uncertain gain. Numenorean lore has not waned so fully in Umbar that we can trust that not one of the Haradhrim will not know of the Eldar. If would only take one to loosen all the threads of this weave. Your plan may work Eithaforn, yet we need to know a great deal more before we can decide. See to your captive! Also, I deem it wise to have more than one plan. If the auction is not held on the ship then we can use the pitch, with oil, to better use. Let us force the slavers to decide between their slaves, and saving their ship so they might journey home. Glintaur will know best how to approach their ship. Yet,"" Elrond stands, ""first he is seeing to our guest. It is no longer safe to meet here, we must leave.""

Head supported by the edge of the roof, eyes still skimming the ruins below, the voice behind the watcher startles the small figure yet even as its alarm, it reacts. Rolling aside, it twists upright, crouching low with a long object held out in front of it. Long hair tumbles down its back, revealing the form of a small child, a lass with large eyes who might be familiar to at least one of those down in the campsite, ""<Dunael> How did ye get here withou... "" before a stream of virulent curses follows. She glances over her shoulders, and then back at the tall figure blinking a little in the dim light and then slowly sidles further from Glintaur, ""<Westron> Sneaky tall man!""

Eithaforn nods. ""I would not venture the risk if I did not think the end worthwhile, Master Elrond. But I shall not seek to gamble the lives of the Quendi without their assent.""

This is delivered as a parting thought, for his gaze is upward, at Glintaur and his quarry. ""Saidonnen, Tinduial, I shall see to the prisoner. Follow me or no, it makes no difference.""

With a last nod of cordiality--which seems out of place in such surroundings--to Master Elrond, Eithaforn departs by the way he came.

As quiet as the shadows that surround the encampment, with many already bidding their farewells, the young Tinduial follows Eithaforn to see to their captive.

""We'd best scatter,"" Saidonnen says grimly, rising as well to douse the fire from a conveniently placed heap of snow. ""I will seek you out anon, Master Elrond."" Silently, then, she gathers up the cups and pot, heedless of their condition, and carries them away into the night, melting into the shadows nearly as effectively as the Firstborn. 

As quiet as the shadows that surround the encampment, with many already bidding their farewells, the young Tinduial follows Eithaforn to see to their captive after nodding her farewell to all present. She tilts a fast smile at Saidonnen as she departs also.

Walking slowly towards the small human child, Glintaur keeps his bow ready to shoot should she try to flee. In the common language used by men, Glintaur says ""Put down your weapon and sit on your hands. Do not attempt to flee or I will be forced to kill you, which I would rather not do at this moment.""

Elrond stands, and walks away through the temple, fading into the shadows and starlight even as his vision had earlier.

Desperately, she edges away again, eyes squinted tight as she listens to her would-be captor, glancing downwards as one by one, the shadows disappeared. She calls down to the one she recognises, ""<Westron> Ye said friend! Father let ye stay! Ye said friend!""

Too late her calls floats downwards, as the man she'd 'rescued' too disappears and Tig looks up, her head drifting upwards to the top of her confronter, neck straining as she pauses in thought and then suddenly she bursts into tears.

No silent crying for the youngest scion of the Affeys, loud sobs that ring in the air, piteous to the hearing of any humans, her knife still in her hand as she eyes the tall man in front of her.

As the girl bursts into tears, Glintaur says, once again in <westron> ""Nothing to be afraid of. Just put your weapon down on the floor out of arms reach and sit down on your hands so I know you will not try to attack me. I will not hurt you if you do what you are told""

""<Westron> Ye put yers down first. Ye scary man! Or I'd tell Father."" The lass crouches on the ground, quite close to the edge, both hands on the ground, looking up at the tall 'man'. Her sobbing continues, loud, piercing. Her dark eyes wet, tears welling over and her nose starts to drip.

The instincts for survival runs strong within those born in Tharbad and Tig Affey submits to the archer as directed. A tiny defiance though she makes. Her knife, that she kicks off the edge as if through accident, the dark blade twirling before clanging into the shadows.

Jan 13, 3037
Tharbad

Fear was no stranger in Tharbad but lately, especially after the arrival of a black ship, fear had congealed to tar-like thickness within the rotten city. Wild rumours flew of sacrifices, especially after the piteous wailing and screaming that had skewered the air, late last night, from the direction of what had been a religious sanctuary. Though no blood was found, a knife identified as that belonging to Tig Affey (temped by RYANNE) had been found at the foot of a building. The frantic Affeys had sent out men, the search continuing even when the blizzard stormed through the ruins of Tharbad. More strange men, stinking of blood, had slipped into Tharbad, including a familiar scarred man, hairless with a blind eye (temped by BARAIN).

<lj-cut text=""Description of Glintaur"">
<b>GLINTAUR's Description</b>
Standing almost 7 feet tall, the elf you are looking at commands a certain amount of attention without being intentionally imposing or overbearing. He has long silver hair that rests lightly on a pair of broad shoulders, grey eyes and a relatively pale complexion. Despite his broad shoulders he is pretty lithe and moves with a grace that belies his almost lanky physique.

The elf is dressed in exquisitely made dark green clothing of elven design and a pair of knee high soft leather boots. A silver pin, fashioned in the shape of a mallyrn leaf, clasps a long flowing cloak around the elf's neck, which seems to take on the hue of his surroundings. At his waist hangs a dark brown leather scabbard in which is sheathed a longsword and over his left shoulder hangs a well-fashioned longbow.

Carrying:
Shield of Mithlond
Bow of the Nandor
Nargrothrond Chain

<lj-cut text=""Description of Saidonnen"">
<b>SAIDONNEN's Description</b>
Where once there might once have been beauty, now there is only a weathered and grim countenance. Where once black hair might have shone like the wing of a raven, now there is but a functional plaiting of locks to join in a single thick rope at the nape of her neck. Wide eyes that might once have shown in flirtatious teasing are lightly lined and guarded, wary grey. Saidonnen Broneryn is no innocent maid, but a Ranger of the North. 
 
She is clad for life in the wildwood, in greens and greys like the shading of trees and underbrush. No gown, but a tunic of dun and green, belted with a belt of much-worn deerskin, wrapped twice about her narrow waist as if it had once belonged to someone else, someone bigger. Her breeches are of the same hue, her boots of indistinct color entirely, being spattered with mud and stained by grass from toe to top. 
 
The tools she bears are not those of a woman: longbow and quiver instead of spindle and distaff, longsword instead of needle. Her accoutrements matched with her height make her all but indistinguishable from the men with whom she serves; only her voice, low and femininely melodic, sets her apart and marks her as different
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Description of Eithaforn"">
<b>EITHAFORN's Description</b>
Loose, onyx-hued locks shorn at the shoulders frame this man's face, and a stern face it is. His eyes, their irises of a dark greyish cast, stare out from well-defined eye sockets, and his long nose matches his vertical nature. For indeed, he is nigh over seven feet high. A well-defined jaw is marked with similarly black whiskers. His skin is light and unscarred, contrasting with the red pallor of his thin lips. 

He is arrayed in earthy hues--browns and greens, mostly--with a touch of gray added here and there. The clothes, mostly woolen, he wears in layers as an adequate protection against the frequent chill of winter. Over all this he wears a hooded cloak of grey bound at his left shoulder with a broach that perhaps is his most valuable possession in terms of coin. It appears to be a golden broach adorned with a five-pointed star of amethyst. A chain hangs about his neck, the end disappearing into the folds of his clothing. Sturdy boots of leather protect his feet. 

His hair hangs loosely from his head; it has the look of little grooming, as one who has gone long without a bath. Worn and stained his clothes are in places, as though they have been used unkindly.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Description of Elrond"">
<b>ELROND's Description</b>
A long road has this one traveled, his garb stained with the memory of water and mud. He is very tall, mantled and hooded in dove-grey. The long straight fold in the cloak by his hip suggests he wears a sword, and by the easy grace of his movements there is the suggestion he knows how to wield it.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Description of Tinduial"">
<b>TINDUIAL's Description</b>
Straight raven hued hair is wound into a braid tied carefully with a leather strip, framing angular features with eyes still ingenuously regarding the world. Her smooth brow is not yet lined by sorrow. Her skin is a fine cream colour with a bare sprinkling of freckles dusting across the bridge of her nose. Lean and finely muscled, she is quick in her movements, her artists hands continually moving as though playing a musical instrument.

This woman is garbed as most of her kin; in plain, nondescript clothing. Dark wool breeches, bound to the knees with strips of thick fabric, disappearing into sturdy leather boots. Layered tunics of varying shades of brown and green, some embroidered in a delicate hand, others as plain as seen upon the back of a farmer, that can be added or removed according to variances in temperature. A grey woollen hood rests on her shoulders to be raised or lowered at the will of the elements. A cloak is bound about her neck, clasped with an iron pin, travel stained and tattered at the far edges.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Description of Tig Affey"">
<b>TIG's Description</b>
Brown as a chestnut and as prickly; the black haired Dunlending lass is sparing in her frame and small in form, yet there is strength in her gangly arms and speed in those skinny legs. Large black eyes dominate her face; a button nose, full lips, and freckles completing her face.

"event","The hour is late. Or early. Depending on whom you ask at this dark snowy night. It's early yet to the rats which scamper leaving tiny pawprints in the white, just as quickly recovered by the steady snowfall. It's late to the watchers who patrol the docks, ready to defend their territory against any who attempts to lay claim to it. A grimy hand lifts smearing more dirt across a face, weary and dark rimmed, a Dunlending sheltering under one of the nooks within the ruins of Tharbad.

Quiet footsteps crunch in rotten icy snow; dark eyes watch the night incessently: a man known only as Carter stops and stares out across the water. Dirty cloths are wrapped around his head, leaving only his eyes free. A dirty coat is held close to his torso by a ragged leather belt. Altogether he seems not terribly concerned with sanitation. And then a low rough voice calls through the falling snow. ""Are you there?""

""Tat 'ou, Carter? Where in Kiern's name have ye been!"" The man sitting jumps to his feet, standing tall at six feet and more than a bit over, his tangled hair hanging down to his shoulder. ""Affey would hammer ye fer being late! Here. Something to keep ye warm."" He tosses a wineskin across towards the other, the bag stained black with overuse, the stopper screwed in but droplets of red trickle as it closes the distance between the two men.

Teeth flash deceptively white between strands of dark cloth, and Carter reaches out, snatching the unwieldy missile handily from the air. He squirts a stream of liquid into his mouth, head tipped back; then re-stoppers the bag. ""Sorry,"" he says, sounding quite unconcerned. ""Was held up. He here yet?""
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

Rubbing his arms through his tattered cloak, the man shakes his head, shift-bouncing a little to keep his blood flowing. ""'ere, give us some!"" He reaches out to snatch the wineskin. ""Isna Affey we meeting. It's a stranger man, all dark and smelling like roses couldna touch him. Said he'd have some good to discuss with Affey but that lazy bum sent me instead.""

The wineskin is relinquished, not a moment too soon. ""Hnh."" Carter grunts, unimpressed. ""Well, where is he then, this new man of your'n?"" His dark eyes move swiftly from shadow to shadow, squinting through the veil of snow. ""S'cold out here...""

""Why am I his slave or 'umthin'?"" exclaims the man after sloshing down a mouthful, the wine flowing down the corners to wet his tunic, ""He'll come when he comes. 'nd he better make it worth the while. Say did ye hear 'bout how those snooty clansmen got their hinnies well and truly licked a few weeks ago?"" His mirth cackles as he slaps his thigh excitedly, ""Achs but I wish I could have been there to watch! Nays, to stick it into those high and mighty .."" He spits a huge glob to the side, ""Stick it I say!""

Carter chuckles in obligatory reply. It is a dry, mirthless sound. ""So,"" he says after a minute of silence. ""Any idea what he's got? Better be good,"" he echoes, grimly, and paces a few steps away towards the docks to stare into the night. ""Wimmen'd be nice..."" There is a note of predatory glee, hunger in his harsh voice.

""Wimmen..?"" The thought apparently has not occurred to the Watcher, ""Ye mean maybe wimmen with real..."" He wriggles and makes several rude suggestive gestures about the body, ""Wimmin?"" The tattered man appears so stunned at the thought that he actually stood still, letting the winesack sink down to his side, ""Now that'd be 'umthin' to think about. Though maybe, I better not tell Affey. He's strange that way, always protectin' dem womenfolk of his. D*** have ye seen the way he treats that daughter? Like a rare treasure! Not! Someday Tig Affey's gonna grow up and we'd see what we see!""

""'Course, wimmen,"" Carter says scornfully, grabbing for the unwatched wineskin. He watches the other man from mocking black eyes. ""Ain't you never seen one afore?"" A tongue slides out to lick thin lips, and the shorter man threads a grimy finger beneath his wrappings and scratches at his cheek. ""Real wimmen,"" he says, softer, almost blissfully. ""I reckon Tig'll be some sight when she's a might bigger...""

""Ayes,..."" repeats the Watcher, his voice equally wistfully, a smear of drool leaking past his cracked lips as he imagines the scene in his mind. He snorts suddenly, elbows angling to nudge at the other man, ""'ere! She's gonna be mine first! Ye may have the leavings after!""

""Pah. Little girls. Y'can have her, I'm gonna have my own, a /real/ woman,"" Carter replies. ""All growed up and all for me..."" He too drifts off into a pleasant reverie, from which he is jerked of a sudden by a noise far off. Or perhaps it is near... the muffling of the falling snow distorts all echoes. His hand falls to his hip and an inch of steel glimmers in the lack-light; wide eyes stare into the night - but nothing moves.

""Pshaw, ye wouldna know a real wimmin even if she comes and kicks yer in yer pr***!"" snarls the Watcher, ""And that Tig ain't gonna be no lil lass ferever! They grow up and she's fed well. No sirree, she'd be a sight better than those ye see in that 'orehouse by the bridge! And free too!""

Carter growls in his throat, relaxing and letting the blade slide back into its sheath with a whispered sussurrus. Snow is beginning to stick to his makeshift cap and to the rough fabric of his coat. ""Who said nothing about the horehouse?"" he demands. ""They's better wimmen than them there, I seen 'em. And I mean to have one."" He kicks at the snow, scattering it from his booted foot.

Snow continues to fall, shrouding the two men who stands waiting for a mystery stranger, one who promised 'good things' to the lawless element within the ruins of Tharbad. Carter has just been startled by a sound and his sword is drawn, an inch of steel showing in the dimlight afforded by smouldering torches and the reflection from the snow. The original watcher is glaring at the first man, ""Wot's got yer goat? And give me that wineskin back!""

""Eh? Ye've been with 'em? Where did ye get the metal to spend on dem?"" There is a note of suspicion in the Watcher's voice, ""Say... I've not seen ye fer many weeks, where have ye been?"" Almost casually, ""... found someone to give ye jobs?"" he adds that last line.

The shorter man takes a last swig of wine and holds out the skin. ""Yeah, yeah, hold on."" He looks sideways at his companion, a sly look to the corners of his eyes, though little else of his face can be seen behind the tightly-wrapped cloth. ""I been... around,"" he says vaguely, then leans forward, moved by some impulse, and lowers his voice to a hoarse whisper. ""Take a look at that!"" Something clinks in a gloved hand held out between the two.

[Saidonnen]  
Dark creates shadows, and snow muffles sound. In one of those shadows, a darker one crouches easily behind a crumbled wall, hooded and cloaked against the cold, and utterly motionless. Though there is no light to betray gazing eyes, the shadow watches... 

Shaking the bag, the Watcher tosses the sack aside, ""Bah! Ye drank all!"" Accusatory and aggressive, the taller man, crunches forward, his shoulders cracking as he straightens even more as he comes out from the nook he had been crouching in. ""Around? Show me, show me."" His fingers wriggle eagerly, unmindful of the other shadows, his confidence bolstered by the fact he stands in the quarter that is claimed by his 'clan'. ""Wot?"" He leans forward, dark eyes in a blackened face squinting. ""Where did ye get that..."" A voice of awe replaces his aggression.

Carter shrugs, grinning and showing his rotten teeth between the rags about his face. ""Seen a man,"" he says. ""Funny-lookin' feller, shorter 'n me even."" He pulls his hand back, fisting his fingers about the things he holds. ""Done paid me good, he did,"" then, ""Don't worry none 'bout that wineskin; buy you another, I will. If him as is coming ever gets here!"" Impatience growls in his voice and he looks up swiftly and around, as if willing the man to appear by his very desire.

[Saidonnen]  
Silently, the shadow leans forward with agonizing slowness. The snow gathering over and around seems to bother the shadow not at all. So is the Watcher now the Watched. 

""That the same man that promised Affey the goods? Dem those who came in that black boat we saw? Like I've been thinkin' it might have been them that got those mainlanders. So good things might -not- be wimmin as ye were droolin' about but loot from that attack on those snooty clansmen but .."" Fingers rasp against grizzled whiskers, lips twisting, his teeth glistening blackly between empty gaps, ""Consarned it! I canna wait any longer! I give 'em one more candle worth of light and that's it. Ain't gonnna freeze me b*** off on account of no-good ****!""

There is a crunching from the west, light footsteps and slowly through the falling snow, a golden glow appears.

""I dunno,"" Carter says, tucking his prize into some secret pocket or pouch. ""I never seen him before, I don't think."" He looks up with a swift glare, opens his mouth and is halted by a halo of light from the side. ""Hsst!""

An imperious voice barks impatiently, ""Come out, your curs! I've not time to diddle with fools. Come out! Come out!"" the face behind the lamp shadowed as a cloaked man walks closer to the rendevous point.

[Saidonnen]  
The lurking shadow does not move; if anything, it sinks lower behind the wall. 

Carter straightens from the half-crouch he had dropped into and takes a step forward. ""That you?"" he calls, an obsequious note entering his rough voice, and beckons with one hand to the Watcher. His other slides to the hilt of his short battered sword, and the long fingers flex. ""Has yer got it?""

""Wells?"" the feet crunch to a stop, the glow spreads a circle of gold around the black cloaked man; he remains faceless though in the bright light it can be seen that he is well shod and well garbed. A black leather hand flicks out, a yellow glint in the palm before an adroit flick of his finger and thumb sends that disk spinning into the snowy air. A faint ring of purest metal zings and then the coin stumbles onto the snow. 

""Carter."" A curt nod at the first man and a sniff at the second, ""And this is Affey, I presume?""

[Carter]
The shorter man nods eagerly, submissively, and stoops swiftly to snatch the coin from the swift-gathering snow. ""No,"" he says, standing again. ""Affey..."" He darts a look upwards. ""He were busy. Sent 'im along instead."" The dark-wrapped head nods towards the Watcher.

[Saidonnen]  
In the shadows, the lurker's shape moves ever so slightly, following Carter's upward glance. 

Though intimidated by the stranger's accent, the Watcher straightens, rat tails limp against his neck as he ingratiates himself, ""Yer chiefship, my chieftain Affey. He sent me and ..."" 

Before the Watcher could continue, the tall well-dressed stranger puts up his gloved hand, ""Enough. I don't deal with morons nor peons. Either Affey comes forward or those goods would be sold to the highest bidder! You, Carter. I told you to make sure the leaders came to this meeting. This place stinks and treasure or no treasure, I intend to leave as soon as I can sell what we raided from those caravans.""

""I told 'im,"" Carter whines. He turns and glares at the other man, sending a sharp kick sideways towards his ankle. ""Go tell 'im to come!"" he whispers urgently. ""An' hurry, you heard 'im! He'll sell it to somebody else if'n he don't!"" 

""He'll be here,"" he says, turning back to the stranger. ""Has... "" Carter hesitates, licking his lips nervously. ""Has yer got it here? Is there... is there any wimmen?"" He takes a careful step backwards in case this man should take umbrage with his questioning, and waits, dark eyes fixed on the stranger's face.

Adroitly, the Watcher tries to avoid that kick but the edge of Carter's boot slices across his calf. Blistening curses splitting the air as he fists his hand and shakes it at Carter, ""Ye ain't my **** Ma! Ye son of a horse bred with a pig!"" He does turn eastwards towards a narrow opening in one of the ruined walls muttering as he limps towards the nook, ""Affey, ye'd pay good fer this!"" 

The stranger exhales slowly, that slow breath pluming in exasperation, ""Can't -anyone- in this confounded city do anything right? And yes, Carter. There are women. Two in fact that'll be part of this auction."" Though his face is shadowed, there is a sense of disgust at the crassness of the discussion, ""Why are you interested as well?"" He mocks the shorter man.

[Saidonnen]  
One would have to be directly atop the hidden observer to see it, but the lurker stiffens. Auction... 

A smile, filled with broken yellowed teeth, spreads across Carter's cloth-wrapped face, parting the folds of fabric. ""No,"" he says after a long minute, and with great regret. ""Yer knows I hasn't got no money. Not like that... is they pretty?"" The fingers of his gloved hand flex as if stroking bright hair, and he peers into the darkness beyond the stranger. ""Has yer got them here?"" he asks, and then turns to yell, ""Hurry up!"" after the Watcher.

""Pretty? Not to me but in this backwater, as long as they've got both legs, arms and all the proper featyres, they might be considered of some beauty. The woman might be a good handful, good teeth and she should last a few years in the bed. And more once that life's over. But the chit's too young. Give that child five or seven years and it will grow to suit anyone."" The stranger's voice is disinterested, almost cynical when he described his goods. ""How many others have you rounded up for this auction, Carter?""

Carter nods, his head bobbing up and down with each description. And he sighs at the last. ""C'n I see 'em?"" he asks wistfully, then adds cunningly, ""Could tell 'em what they's bidding on..."" before pulling back his shoulders a little at the man's question. ""Couple,"" he says evasively. ""Affey, he's coming; and there was Jase said he's wanting some action; and I think some other feller too. From yonder. Be more sure t'come, he would, did he know there was wimmen."" He looks up again, a gleam running through his dark eyes, and the stranger rolls his eyes and sighs. ""All right,"" he says curtly. ""Come along... you'd best not be trying to lie to me, Carter,"" he adds in veiled threat, as they disappear into the snow. ""No, no,"" Carter's voice comes, ingratiating.

[Saidonnen] 
Only when the men have long gone does the shadow resolve into a tall Ranger, who stretches her legs slowly and stares long into the snow in the direction the men had gone. Of a sudden, she turns and sprints in the opposite direction, her dark-cloaked figure disappearing into the winter snow with little trace of her passage to be found in the morning.

"event","It is a clear night in the valley, not yet midnight. Few are out in the cold, but from the house the sound of merry singing and laughter drifts over to the forests and meadows. But there are elves who are outside even now, one of them Paithel, the Miruvorthaer. Wrapped in her cloak she makes her way along the meadow, past the huge oak, heading away from the house to the north.

Nestled three edhel high, in one of the massive forks that overshadow the path, sits Imtharbad. His stark complexion glimmers pale within the shadowy foliage, his presence well announced by the rhythm hiss of his blade against wood, the green smell of fresh oak perfuming the air as the ellon quietly works. Little curls drift downwards, clustering like snow flakes that do not melt in the dark ground underneath the oak tree. As a cloaked form passed by, he calls a soft greeting, words barely clear in the night air.

Words barely clear perhaps, yet well audible in the silence covering the meadow. Hearing the greeting, Paithel turns a bit, looking up to find out who it is up in the tree. Recognising the ellon she inclines her head and stops, glancing at the wooden curls in the snow. She does not seem in a haste, for she takes the time to enquire about his doings. ""What is it you're carving?"" she calls up.
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

Imtharbad responds, teeth glint while the lighter shade of arm and carved object lift, brandishing it forward as if a slightly closer view would allow the elleth to recognise the form. A length of wood, half as long as his forearm has been smoothened into two semi-arcs along one edge, the opposite remaining straight. ""I am not sure, my fingers shape the wood as it would, the function would come along soon enough."" His head looks back to the House and then down again at Paithel, ""You're not joining the others in the House?"" He asks quietly.

""No,"" says Paithel and leaves it at that. She is not known to join the merrymaking, especially if it's inside the house. Glancing at the as yet function-less objects Paithel nods. ""Function is not needed when it comes to art - other than the function of being beautiful, of course."" No question is in her words, yet what she means to ask is clear - is it art, or shall the object be something useful once the carving is finished?

His face wavers palely as Imtharbad nods, ""I see."" He glances back at the house, head canted to the side as he listens to the cheer faint in the distance, ""I see."" He repeats as his eyes drops to his carving back in his lap. ""I am no purveyor of beauty, though there is beauty in function and functionality. When it's finished, I would know where to use it for. But if I guess rightly, of late my fingers appear fond of perches for my birds. Those are well used and do not last as long as I have hope.""

Slowly, Paithel nods. ""Your birds? How are they?"" she asks quietly and even mildly interested, understanding well the friendship between elf and animal. For in her pockets she usually carries treats for either horses and squirrel, always concerned with the well-being of those.

A silent contemplation of the elleth below him before he nods again. This time, Imbtharbad twists and slides his way down the oak to land almost beside Paithel, his carving clipped between his teeth. In the moonlight, his paleness shimmers brighter as he smiles, ""Now that's a questions I wish I knew better. Something ails them. Not an illness but an unrest. They do not feed as well as I like. Perhaps the Master's absence has upsets them somehow. Is there news in the House?"" He slips that question out gently, his carving back in his hands, his long fingers caressing the smooth wood.

Another moment of silence passes as Paithel considers this, then she shakes her head softly. ""I have heard nothing new since the disappearance of the Herdir."" In an afterthought, she adds, ""Perhaps if you asked Arglin he'd have something to tell you."" There is a hint of sarcasm or just jest in her voice, but it is faint. She glances at the object again, now that she has a better view on it.

A muffled chuckle slips out, silvery eyes glancing over at the elleth, ""Ask Arglin? He would have something to tell, wouldn't he? But isn't that like asking the wind where it will blow tomorrow? He's a kind man but his words, flighty as a kite in that said wind and as worthy of believing."" His breathing continues evenly, perhaps his birds trouble him but Imbtharbad does not display any more concern. Noting the other's glance, the falconer hefts his carving, ""It feels like it would be a raft."" He says that sotto voce, no hint of humour in his new explanation.

The elleth raises an eyebrow. ""A raft? A rather small one, then."" Another glance goes to the object, then Paithel gazes into the distance absently. Her interest seems to fade as other things come to her mind. What things that would be is unclear, though.

Still weighing his uncompleted piece, Imbtharbad's brow cocks upwards, ""Mellon, size does not matter, it's what it would carry that determines how useful it could be when it's decided to take its final form."" Curiously he watches as the elleth's attention is drawn inwards, ""I interrupted you while you were on your way somewhere."" An apology offered, a reserved hesitation before he asks, ""You seem distracted, ...""

Immediately, the elleth's attention returns and she shakes her head. ""You did not interrupt,"" she says quietly and her bearing suggests a shrug even though she stands unmoving. Paithel indicates the object again. ""I did not say small is bad, or less useful.""

""Words can mean something different than from what it is said, Paithel. But you are correct, I read too much into what you said rather than what you mean. It could well be a raft, a light one to carry messages downstream. Perhaps along the river into the ocean and to the west."" A touch of regret tinges his voice, ""A dream only though, only just a dream.""

Paithel looks up. ""Why a dream? Do you not think the raft would make it into the west if such would be its destination?"" she asks, smiling for the first time. ""It could well be worth a try, unless you have other plans for it.""

""I could dream and hope, Paithel but would anyone know?"" replies Imbtharbad, the regret replaced by contemplation, ""It would be on faith that it would arrive in the west, and that's how we've lived, on faith."" The dark-haired ellon laughs, a light burst of mirth that fills part of the night air, the oak tree's branches seemingly dancing in time as a breeze blows through them. ""And you speak true, what harm would it do? And look, Paithel."" Long fingers wrap themselves about the midpoint and twist, separating the carving into two, ""I wondered what I was to do with a hollowed out perch.""

Thenindind, obviously in deep thought, walked north through the path, into a meadow of trees of all different colors. Walking towards the huge, old oak, Thenindind's eyes were glassy, and he only snapped out of his reverie when he heard a voice. His reverie rendered him unable to pinpoint who it was, but as he looked out, he saw Imbtharbad and Paithel. ""Mae govannen, mellyn nin. ""

""Thenindind."" Paithel inclines her head in greeting once more before turning back to Imbtharbad. ""Now, what are you going to do with the halves? Still have a raft in mind?"" She eyes the wood in the ellon's hands, being not much of an expert with the creating of useful objects.

Startled by the ring of a third voice, Imbtharbad slides the hollow carving back together again, silvery eyes sliding smoothly over his shoulder and he smiles a greeting, adding a half nod, ""You too seek solace from the gaiety in the house, Thenindind?"" 

A half shrug as Paithel asks her question, his answer laconic in the presence of a third, ""It could well be. I'd know when it's completed.""

In genuine wonder at what the two were talking about before she got there, Thenindind asked, ""Do you mind telling me what you were speaking of?""

Another smile flashes at Thenindind as Imbtharbad slides his carving into his belt, ""Naught, Thenindind, naught. Perhaps I may explain when I do not need to check on my birds. Paithel, good evening and your thoughts, I will think on them. Thank you."" Without waiting for a response, he departs almost at a trot, soon disappearing into the dark after a half wave at the other two who remains.

Laughter precedes NIONIEL and MILUIHEN's entrance into the quiet theatre, a puppy prancing about their feet, begging for treats that the student Glirdain was juggling between bites. Both startled the two already within the theatre, CURULOMION who was mediating on lessons while ORETAURNAS tend the hedge. The juggler was quick to offer the treats while Nioniel quickly introduced themselves as the Dinlom puppy continued to beg more of those baked cookies being tossed about in the air.

A quiet night, one of mediation and indeed as some (VARYA, MIA, OSTIEL) made their way along the great marble stairway while one (ORETAURNAS) laid prone by the the path. A close encounter of the shod kind led to a debate about wisdom in the houses, specifically with that of Raavindonserke Sparks dazzled as Varya and Mia exchanged veiled words, perhaps old arguments being rekindled while the forester and the apprentice healer quietly listened in. The witticism between Marchwarden and Galadriel's Companion scintillated as Ostiel excused herself for lessons and it ended when both walked away but not before Varya tossed guarded advice to Oretaurnas about whom he chooses to associate with.

Lost in his usual reverie, ORETAURNAS stumbles across CURULOMION who too was caught in admiration of the night sky. A brief exchange of names led to a discussion of their professions, the forester expressing interest in Curulomion's first choice of craft, smithing. Their discussion led to the nature of alloys. Curulomion explained how gold and silver needed iron and copper to temper their softness to enhance their usefulness while Oretaurnas appeared riveted by how the purity of metal needed to be contaminated by the baser metals to provide strength, character and function.

Ruins of Tharbad
Gossip flew within the ruins of shelter offered to a stranger who had crossed the flooded waters of Greyflood by Affey family. The excitable Tig Affey (temped by RYANNE) told the tale at the campfire to 'oos' and 'aahs', claiming to have rescued a stranger from the river as he who was being chased by wolves. ""Achs but like a big fish he was, flopping wet and carrying a sack. Kit (temped by BORUMHA) of course, she being the thief she is, tried to make off with his bag but that man, he changed that bag into a boy! A cute boy but nasty temper like Grandda when ye deny him beer!""

Talking above the laughter that rang out at that apt image, the young lass continued petulantly, ""And that stranger be rude! He demanded Grandda be his friend or give him gold! Or maybe it was be friend -and- give gold. I be a good talker. I speak that furriner tongue good. I woulda stick him with me knife if that Kit hadna squirmed forward and tried the same. And he did it again! He looked at Kit and said something and that thief, she looked at him like a cat that hadna seen cream fer months. He dinna pay -me- no mind and I be an Affey! I woulda stick him then but Father came and took pity on the fishy stranger, out of the kindness of his heart. We Affeys are kind to those less fortunate that we are ....""

The Bear militia were relentless in their training, even in the cold wintery mornings. Some including RYANNE were at target practice while other TARKRIS were practising their melee skills with wooden staves when a gray-clad man suddenly charged towards Lady Bear, brandishing a drawn long sword. Caught off-guard, her bodyguard raced to defend their Chieftain while TARKRIS stepped a pace ahead, delaying the attacker. The Bear defence failed and the attacker, later identified as the late Stag Chieftain, reached his target but strangely only tagged Ryanne.

 The attention of the Bear seems to have drawn a sour eye from the Stag Chieftan. ""I will try to run a messengers once a month through the winter,"" Yulen tells Zinzan gently, but then stops. ""Come, we have an appointment."" he adds. A nod is given from the Speaker and they turn, beginning a walk toward the fountain then past it toward the temple ruins. Guards in tow, a light wave of the hand is offered by both, somewhat absently, to the Bear.

The patrol leader's dark eyes flickers as the Stags move away and he stops again, his expression blanking before he darts glances about him and then Alexander heads back to his own clansmen. The other guards closed rank back around and the women continues walking down the line of the statues.

"event","The sun commands its dominance through the sparse afternoon clouds, its golden strength streaming bright through crevices and the doorway as a Bear guard enters, a leisurely pacing towards where the Chieftain of his clan sits at the table. Ryanne's raven hair streams loose over her shoulders while the snowy head of her bard, Warren Zevon, sways to and fro as he sing-songs the tale from the scrolls unrolled on the table. His bass voice is rich while her softer alto moves counterpoint to his crooning. Both tap their long fingers against the hard wooden surface, oblivious to the new arrival but not the remaining two militia serving as her guards.

The most senior, Alexander, raises his hand in greeting to the first man, waving him to quiet while he bends. The song breaks off as Ryanne sighs, ""What news from Creatrach, Kal?""

Those who serve the Hall move quietly completing their duties despite the visitors in the room. The fireplace glows red, the smoke rising upwards through the chimney, providing warmth on this winter day.

This fall day is granted admittance, along with a few men of the blue color, as the doors are gently opened from without. The reason? The arrival of another of Dunland's three Chieftans. As the doors near full opening by the guards on duty, two blue dressed men lead a host of three others. Behind them enters a short man in a crisp blue tunic. He is followed by yet two more men dressed in blue. In all, five men enter in a box formation with their Chieftan, Yulen Chaquel, in the middle. As the rear pairing of men clear the door, the guards slowly close these big, great doors.

Though he isn't a full-time servent of the Hall, and his duties are done for the day, Tarkris is hanging around anyway. He helps where he is needed, moving various objects and helping the other servents with their activities. Every once in a while he sneeks a peak in the stew pot, in which cooks the hares that his traps have provided; and when nobody is looking, takes a quick taste...to ensure that it isn't poisened, of course. Seemingly paying little attention to the entrance of the Bear or the Stag, he continues to mill about, helping where needed.
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

The one-armed Kal grins at Ryanne, his tone belies his serious mien, ""Captain Maelus sends his well wishes to ye and begs ye, Lady Bear, fer the indulgence of yer return to Creatrach Dun."" The grin twists into a smirk at the Bear woman's stillness, hastily answering his chieftain's silent question, ""Achs, but truly I bear his own words. The Captain took great care in his words."" 

The bard beside Ryanne snorts, his laughter undisguised while the woman asks softly, ""And what reason fer my return?"" The others around her stir, their eyes arrowing to the entrance of the Stags in the Hall while Alexander waves over one of those who lingers by the fire close, requesting for more seats.

The doors having closed, the group comes to a stop. The center man, Yulen, unclasps and removes his cloak. Light gray eyes begin to absorb the great hall, though fiarly rapidly, until his eyes come to a rest upon the formerly singing Ryanne. His expressionless lips offer neither smile nor frown at the sight before him.

Tarkris looks around for a brief second, seeing if anybody else is making a motion to retrieve extra seating. When nobody moves, the Bear trapper sighs before procuring the proper seating for the Bear guard and, after a moment of thought, the Stag Chieftan. He trys to set them up in a rough circle, one directly across from where Ryanne is sitting, and one halfway between them.

""Orcs were spotted coming from the south, Lady Bear. They skulked past our patrols but left their vile trail which was found too late. The Captain... he's concerned..."" Kal's head turn aside as the Stags approach. Ryanne's eyes remain on the one-armed man's face, thoughtful at his report, ""From the south? Mayhaps, tis Kiern's blessing. Fer us to discover how these creatures have been able to make past our defences to ravage along the borders between Redvyrne and our own. I will think on this."" 

Her decision given, only then does Ryanne turns her gaze beyond Kal. Two affable smiles of appreciation is flashed, one towards Alexander and the other towards the clansman who helps with the chairs before her still eyes examines the blue clad Dunlendings in the centre of the Hall.

The Stag Chieftan turns lightly and begins walking at a casual pace in the direction of Ryanne. One of the forward guards turns his head for a moment, looking at the other three; said three turn and being to mingle with the background, keeping an eye upon those in the room, including their red counterparts. Yulen approaches his counterpart, in silence.

The bard looks over at Ryanne, a lifted brow and as she nods to Warren's unspoken question, carefully rolls the scrolls. Curiosity brightens the older Bear's dark eyes, his hands cradling the documents lovingly as he greets, ""Good afternoon, Yulen Chaquel. A fine winter's day.""

Placidly, Lady Bear leans back in her seat, stretching her arms in front of her before crossing them while maintaining her gaze on the approaching Stag. 

Alexander saunters over towards when the chairs are arranged, reaching out towards Tarkris's shoulders in thanks. Quietly, the patrol leader mutters, ""Would ye extend yer help further and find out if ale or any such drink could be brought forth, the air is stiff, too stiff and perhaps alcohol would serve to lighten it.""

Tarkris offers a polite bow toward Ryanne after his arrangement of the chairs. He shoots a glance at the Stag guards, eyes narrowing as he studies them. The trapper jumps slightly as Alexander pats his shoulder. ""O' course sir, I be seein' what I can be findin'."" he moves off toward the stores, grabbing some help on the way.

Yulen nods back to Ryanne's greeting. ""A better day than some."" he says gently. ""Those who went to Bree have returned, your brother included."" Yulen's eyes turn in the direction of Alexander and his dealings, but return to Ryanne. ""Atleast, those will be returning are now home."" he adds flatly.

Finding the stongest ale in the hall, Tarkris and his conscripted help hurry back toward the gathering. ""Will this do?"" he mutters to Alexander before holding the spirits for him to inspect. His gaze inevitably drifts toward the men in blue, the wheels in his mind spinning hard. He finally gives up and turns his attention back toward Alexander. ""Forgive me, sir, but whut be goin' on 'ere?"" He jerks his head toward the Stag Cheiftan and his retinue.

The raven head drops, Ryanne's eyes continuing to watch as Yulen speaks, another nod, ""Ayes, I've heard that there was trouble. Nimdok was fit to be tied when he stomped into the house before he left again. Those who will be returning, Chaquel?"" Lady Bear's question, softly lingers. Her bard listens avidly.

Keeping his eyes on the scene before him, Alexander takes a sniff, pauses and leans closer for a second, longer sniff, ""Ayes, this will do. Trouble, possibly."" The patrol leader somberly jerks his head towards the Stags, ""Ye've heard the Stags lost their leader, Nekenyu Wylden to an assassination. 'afore he was formally accepted by the others in this hall. I be thinking this Chaquel might have something to say to that.""

Yulen nods softly. ""Bandits attacked near Tharbad."" he says flatly. ""Atleast two were kidnapped and more than that died."" The Chieftan pauses but briefly. ""I know that atleast one of your clan was on the trip, and I wanted to thank you for their part.""

Tarkris nods as he listens to the soldier's explanation. A simple ""Hrumph"" is all that he gives in reply as he sets to the task of serving the ale. The trapper serves Ryanne with another bow before turning toward the Stag Chieftan. He draws himself up a little straighter with pride before offering a drink for Yulen to take.

Dark gray eyes snap wide at the news, ""Bandits? Kidnapped.. at Tharbad? I am sorry to hear that. How many died? Death is a spectre that haunts those who practise the commerce trade but kidnapping, that I've never heard before. Fer what ends?"" Ryanne sidles a glance at Warren and the bard ventures an explanation, ""Slavery perhaps? I've been with other caravans to Bree many years ago but always, we've been well guarded by the Stag Watch and reinforced by the militia from our clan. Tis the first trip that we Bears had not have that many with the caravan...""

Alexander inhales at the news, watching Ryanne steeple her fingers slowly. She continues, absently offering another smile to Tarkris, ""Ayes, Nimdok kept news of this close to his chest and he took on Ayan only when I nagged him. What do ye intend to do, Chaquel."" She adds that abruptly.

The offered drink is accepted with a soft, ""thank you."" The Stag's attention turns back to Ryanne. ""A woman and a young girl were taken,"" Yulen answersnondescriptly, ""And I think slavery might be the best of outcomes."" Another pause is given. ""About ten, I have been told, were lost."" Light gray eyes turn to the floor a moment, he not having availed himself of the chairs found earlier.

The trapper takes a couple of steps back, not wishing to interfere with the conversation. His interest in said conversation has grown, however, at the mention of the deaths and kidnapping. He looks nerviously between Alexander and the Stag, his mouth opening and closing stupidly as if he is meaning to say something, but is thinking better of it. Tarkris finally takes a second step back and tries to look busy, keeping an ear in the conversation.

""Ten? Tis not many yet that's more than any clan could lose."" sighs Ryanne, ""Kiern's a hard tester of Stag's hearts this year, Chaquel. I am sorry."" She repeats the last phrase again, ""I'm sorry."" Her serene expression softens, her tone evident of the temporary change in topic, ""Yer kin, Nekenyu was a good man. This news would have strike him hard.""

Shifting, Lady Bear angles her head to take in the others, dark gray eyes lingering on Tarkris a few moments longer before they return to look on Chaquel. ""And would slavery fer those two womendolk really be one of the better outcomes? I've never been to Tharbad but from what Warren had told me, tis an isolated pit of iniquity and lawlessness. That land has always interested the Stags.. ayes?""

The Stag Chieftan sighs slowly at Ryanne's words and nods equally slowly. Though, he choses to answer the latter first. ""Slavery would beat -- well, being beaten."" Yulen pauses, weighing his words. ""Rape? Prostitution?"" he says grimly, ""And probably being beaten for getting pregnant."" The grimmace on his face at these thoughs is as darkening as a thunderhead.

Some things are so grim, they cannot help but take the attention of the world and focus it on the speaker. Knowing this is the case, Yulen redirects it. He turns toward the dais and takes a couple steps toward it. ""I knew a boy, but a few years younger than I, so full of life."" His steps stop, but his words do not. ""He died at Mathain -- in his heart. He wasn't there, but he died there. And somehow, in but what? the last year? He came back to life, not just full of life, but with enough life to share."" He turns back around slowly, continuing his metaphor. ""He came back to us with a truth: Kiern cannot lead us if we kill ourselves with the help of the Orcs and the Forgoil. I daresay, he might have succeded."" He lifts his arm toward the dais. ""I know I could never replace him, but I can follow his lead."" Yulen ends his speech, ""How can we help with the Orcs?""

Collected her composure remains as Ryanne hears out Yulen's words, her breathing even despite the dark words the Stag utters. A slight incline of her head, a curl sliding off its perch behind her ear, hanging black against her golden complexion, ""I've heard some of -that- lad's tale, and no one's truly dead. His spirit is with Kiern now and his memories live on in those who honour them and live as he would have lived."" 

Warren nods somberly, adding, ""Tis a tale worthy to be sung and indeed I've heard told that yer kin's story was told by Elrabin in Bree?"" 

Her hands fall from its pose, landing palms up on the table. Ryanne slowly continues, ""I've not stood in those shoes, Chaquel and canna imagine how any women could withstand that assault on body, mind and ayes, their spirit. They... they're irretrievable?"" Her question a hair of a whisper as she glances back at Chaquel. She leaves the last question aside for the moment.

""I think Kiern lent us his spirit back for a short time."" Yulen says, glancing back at the former home of a symbol of a united Dunland. Turning back to Warren, the Chieftan says gently, ""I wasn't there. But only Kiern and possibly his love may could know his whole tale."" Light gray eyes turn to the floor rather than Ryanne. ""Had they sent anyone after the attackers, they would have been at worse risk for a further attack. And beyond that...."" Yulen says softly... ""The Watch could take Tharbad, but the rest of the Enedwaith? Minhiriath? Eriador? Gondor? I can only hope they are with Kiern.""

Uh...if I...er...may,"" Tarkris nervously clears his throat before continuing, ""How did tha attack happen in tha firs' place? I wasn' catchin' that part of tha story, and it be seemin' ter I that knowing this be tha firs' step ter a...uh...conclusion."" The trapper shifts his weight from one foot to another, obviously uncomfortable with asking such a question.

""Orcs on the Wulf and Bear borders, bandits striking where they please in Dunland. Assassins walking with impunity into the heart of our land, killing whom they please and disappearing. Now slavery ... Achs poor Mother Dunland..."" Ryanne lists the recent problems tA brow arches as Lady Bear scrutinises the Bear trapper before she inclines her head, her small retinue shifting in their seat and feet, their restlessness indicative of their curiosity of the matter. Carefully, Ryanne says, ""That tale I would be interested in as well, Chaquel. Nimdok spoke not of it.""hat besets the land, breaking off when Tarkris asks his question.

A brow arches as Lady Bear scrutinises the Bear trapper before she inclines her head, her small retinue shifting in their seat and feet, their restlessness indicative of their curiosity of the matter. Carefully, Ryanne says, ""That tale I would be interested in as well, Chaquel. Nimdok spoke not of it.""

The Chieftan replies to the unnamed Bear. ""A man came upon the camp in the rain and asked to be let in by the fire. My Second baited him by turning his back upon him and gained our only advantage. The attack began without one unguarded inside the camp."" says Yulen, again with the flat tone. Turning his gaze back to Ryanne. ""Aye. So again, I ask, how can we help with the Orcs? Better to fight them than each other.""

""But...."" Tarkris trails off at this. It is obvious that he found the reply mediocre at best, but seemingly decides against pressing the point further. As the Stag deflects the conversation back toward Orcs, the short man returns to his duties, keeping an ear on the conversation, just like before.

Ryanne's guards stir at the bald question, surreptitious glances exchanged between the Bear miltia before Kal clears his throat, speaking up, ""Lady Bear, the orcs are of concern to our clan."" The one-armed man casts a cautious glance at Yulen, ""And the Captain ain't the only one who hold strong views about those not from our clan on our lands.""

Folding her hands in front of her, Lady Bear nods at the messenger, ""Ayes, I'm aware, Kal. Yet what Chaquel says hold some grains of sense. These orcs are our shared enemy and if they've truly come into Caerdh, than the raids that ravaged parts of Redvyrne would be the fate of our clan kin."" 

A long pause and then suddenly, Ryanne asks of Tarkris, ""What do ye think?""

The question predictably catches Tarkris off guard, and he glances around before speaking. ""Lady Bear...I think that tha Stag canna be trusted. Tha Orcs are a menace, an' as a trapper I have met wit more than ah few o' tha scum. But...I feel like tha Chieftan 'ere has some...other reason for askin' tah help wit tha Orcs so suddenly. We have been dealin' wit tha Orcs before, an' we can continue tah deal wit them ourselves....unless dere be somthin' I havn't heard yet."" The trapper seems to get bolder as his little speech continues, even throwing in some exaggerated hand gestures at certain points.

Yulen listens patiently to all of the dissenting remarks, patiently. Eyebrows raise lightly as he nods. Light gray eyes shine as moonbeams upon the Bear Kal. ""And when you die under an Orcish blade? Who's concern will it be when they take Mathain?"" solidly inquires the Stag Chieftan rhetorically. The moonbeams turn upon Takris. ""But if my reason is your desire, my cousin has already given it."" Softening a little, ""After he cursed your very existences for what you did at Mathain."" Turning his gaze back upon the Bear Chieftan, the Stag Chieftan says gently. ""We have some work to do,"" he says softly slipping his cloak back on. ""if we are to ever get past this madness.""

""Ye hear, Chaquel. This man speaks as many of my clan speaks. Memories, Chaquel. Those remain deep in yer heart fer Nekenyu and the same hold true fer my clanfolk. The Hawks were part of Bear. Tis the nature of men to conquer and build new 'empires' to prove their strength and rank and that I dinna disagree with. This when the Hawks sought to gain by stealing from the Bears, land that we hold fer all of my people, .... but as ye've said, that's water past a bridge long broken. But memories, the memories of the hideous deaths at the last Mathain Revold, those are too fresh as yet... Yet..."" Ryanne pauses, her eyes shifting to examine her own people as well as Tarkris. ""Yet a common enemy... I will think on this, Chaquel. Would ye meet with me again? In three days?""

""Yes, I hear."" He says gently, watching Ryanne briefly. ""At which point, I should then be forced to ask what fell treachery your man was up to on our trip?"" he asks rhetorically, ""Or perhaps your own brother?"" His vision turns to the other the Bear Kal. ""But that leads us knowhere but to distract us from those who would kill us."" says the Chieftan with a faint echo of a voice not heard properly here before. Yulen's moonbeams turn to Tarkris as he continues, ""And to further divide us. We are all Kiern's children. And he has promised to lead us again. Let us be there when he does."" His feet begin his path toward the door. His four escorts begin on that very step to move from the fringes of the room toward their protectee, though he has not answered Lady Bear's question.

Warren exhales loudly, the sound ponderous in the chilly air as Ryanne answers, ""Is there a snake under every rock and every bush ye look at, Chaquel. Ayes, ye could well ask. Ayan's business is clan business and my brother's his own man though he holds our kinship dear."" She does not pursue the Stag's answer, holding up a hand to her own folks who surged forward, mouths agape to argue their own points of view. Her answer short and mild to their expressions, ""I've not led us ill thus far, let me think on it.""

Tarkris grumbles while he turns back to his task, but what he has on his mind he dosn't voice in the open. Instead he begins to collect the chair that was the Stag's, as well as the ale mug. His back is hunched a bit while this goes on, revealing his embarresment at being, in his mind, singled out by the leaders of the two clans. As he reaches the stores, he takes some ale for himself, quite intent on steadying his nerves before finishing in the Great Hall.

 The Chieftan listens to Ryanne's remarks and glances around the room once more. ""Interesting question,"" he says flatly, leaving the meaning of the answer to linger. As he moves, the day is permitted another assault upon the room as Yulen and his escorts depart and the door is, again, closed.

Hall of Chieftains, Kierkgard Dun

As the Bears struggled to find replacement stone for Creatrach Dun's renovation, more bad news of orcs in Caerdh itself came while Lady Bear was in the Hall. YULEN's arrival redirected the conversation into the recent events in Tharbad with RYANNE expressing concern about the two kidnapped Dunlending women. Though not formally ratified by his fellow chieftains, Yulen's leadership of the Stag clan is not challenged as Lady Bear gladly discussed clan matters with him while TARKRIS attended to the leaders. Yet it was observed that Yulen left abruptly from the hall.

Dunlending Caravan Somewhere on the Greenway

The nanny-searchers came back to chaos. Broken carts, blood-stained canvases, carcasses of oxen being grimly harvested for flesh and hide while the folks of the caravan, both civilian and miltia (Tyrek and Ryven temped by YULEN) limped or laid bandaged or dying. Those who had gone away to hunt for food were not back yet.

Donna, carrying her baby son, came upon her cousin, Nimdok Arvey (temped by RYANNE), who was carefully wrapping a roundish object with torn strips of rags. The rags were crusty rust-red with spots of crimson soaking through from the severed head within. The Stag trader grimly poured out his account of a treacherous afternoon attack by bandits, a horde that stank of men with breath and stench of rot and decay - a horde unbeknowst to Dunlendings consisting of Southrons (Merzak temped by XIEDON) pirates, Lond Daer bandits (Scurvy temped by DINALOSS and Cap'n_Jack) and a lone CAIUS.

He also spoke of Anelle and Benga (temped by TAPHENE) being stolen from within the camp by one of the crafty attackers while Taphene was defending her family against Caius. The Stag woman was one of those severely wounded and a healer was needed. Bitterly, the Stag trader lamented the disappearance of his best oxen, Bel, among those missing as well as the loss of trade profits as the raiders had managed to make off valuable goods. Bel was last seen heading towards Tharbad after accounting for a few of the raiders's casualities."

Sept 11, 1436
Prancing Pony Common Room

A frantic Dormi came into the tavern looking for her youngest sister, Isabel ""Ruine"" Shepherd. The matron had not seen the young healer for almost two days! Young Ruine had been diligent in her care of her sister and family after Ottewell Whitethorne's imprisonment. It was unlike her to be gone this long. Her anxious queries elicited little responses; afterall this little Shepherd was a ruin to her family and a mere Bree of no rank and little value to the townfolk.

Interest was slow to kindle but finally someone finally piped out claiming that he had seen Ruine in close conversation with one of the foreigners who had left a few days ago. A conversation concerning barrels and a midnight meeting close to the Bree cells. Derisive laughter ringing to the rafters, for who would be interested in a skinny Bree lass with no looks and a rough manner. Until someone else commented that they found Bilby, the pony which is partly owned by Ruine and Gregory by the cells.

The North Gate

A despondent-looking Shepherd family slowly made their way out of Bree Town, a heavy cart pushed by the burly Bull with the almost blind, Sky trudging with Dormi and her daughter, Bella. With Ruine's gone missing, the family was unable to support themselves in the town and the decision to return to the Shepherd farm was sadly made."

Centre of Bree

 Evening had shrouded Bree when RUINE came in search of Donna and ELRABIN, dragging a reluctant nanny goat behind her with a young LUCILLE trailing behind. The Dunlending camp bustled as carts are reloaded with new goods and supplies, clearly preparing for their impending departure. HARRY, on his rounds, paused to check the caravan and collided into ROWANA. Truly an encounter of the close kind though their brief exchange appeared hot. One of the Dunlendings, NIMDOK, recognising the seamstress came forward to join in and with extravagant words attracted others to come forward. ROWANA's truant son was found by ALESWYN and the young Olsen dashed forward to rejoin his mother. BRONA tripped into the scene and like a moth to a bright candleflame, soon hovered around Aleswyn in conversation."

Healing House

It was peaceful at the Healing House, a peace that was disturbed when the visiting Dunlending, Donna (temped by RYANNE) brought in her ailing son for attention. The cause was found and a cure suggested and RUINE attempted to aid the Dunlending mother in the courtyward when a passer-by, NAMIR, entered seeking not healing but curiosity and peace. A discussion ensued, one which fired the young healer's secret desire. That flame was further fanned when ELRABIN came in search of his mate, Donna and his son. After Namir left, Elrabin and Ruine came to an agreement. A story for help to buy a goat for the Dunlending couple. The tale that the Stag bard offered was one of excitement, blood, treachery - the tale of Nekenyu Wylden."

She RPed as Ruine and Prancing Pony servers
Coraan, Haithin, Cicely, Elrabin, Pierce and Aleswyn RPed as themselves

Aug 29, 1436
Prancing Pony Common Room

A quiet lazy afternoon, RUINE was sadly contemplating her bucket of something in the almost empty room when the early evening crowd starts entering. First it was a stranger (CORAAN) who display some disinterested interest while David (aka HAITHIN) watches from the shadow. CICELY entered looking for excitement followed by ELRABIN in search of 'winks'. The Stag bard got more than he bargained for casting one of the older servers, Bessie (temped by RUINE), into maidenly blushes with his gentle touch and voice. The Dunlending is joined by his mate, CORTHEON.

As the afternoon faded towards evening, Ruine attempted to recruit David in some venture after reprimanding PIERCE Rushlight for deserting the Healing House after Trelgo and herself had offered the hapless blacksmith shelter in the winter. To those who eavesdropped, the young healer wove a tale of Ottewell, Scarlet, Roddy as well as Kylin. Cicely, that adorable hobbit child trotted around, following the Rushlight like a new-born duckling on its mother's trail. ALESWYN majestically streamed in and after moving around the common room, chose to speak with the Dunlendings. Life is never boring in the Prancing Pony. 

It is worth the time to tell of the exchange of hot words between ALESWYN and PIERCE while RUINE and the hapless ELRABIN stood by watching. The Bree trader's vehemence and mournful tone clashed against the newly reinstalled blacksmith's mournful and forceful timbre. As succinctly though inaccurately expressed by Ruine to the Dunlending bard, ""<Westron> You should not get involved, stranger. Lover's quarrel."" The quarrel ended with Pierce storming out while Aleswyn calmly soothed those overturned by the blacksmith's hasty departure."

"event","The flood gates of the grey-lined sky part -- sprinkles of droplets cast upon the Bree-landers and visitors. Dust clouds vanish as the ground softens by the water. Cart wheels drive deeper int the earth, leaving their slightly muddied marks. Despite the weather this afternoon, a heat that clings to damp tunics, merchants hark their wares. 

A red-haired woman exits from the general store, half turning to wave to a figure within. ""Good day to you, too! I shall return tomorrow with your finished garment."" A chuckle. ""Yes. I shall make sure the hem doesn't fray. Good day again."" Rowana steps out into the drizzled landscape and breathes in the fine rich air of dew and fresh baked goods. 

Slouching against the side of the general store, a stoop-shouldered Dunlending, clad in dark garments, darkened even more by the drizzle that continues to plague the afternoons in Bree. The hood of his cloak untidily flung over his long dark hair serves well enough to shade Nimdok Arvey's eyes as they dart to and fro watching, watching those who passes by. He nods to himself at intervals as if in agreement to overheard scraps of conversation.

He was starting to stretch, moving his shoulders to unkink them as the red haired woman comes out from the store. His eyes are caught by the details of embroidery against white and a brow arches in surprise, glancing down to examine the woman's hem. Absently, a hand brushes off the trickle of rain from the side of his face as he pushes off, muttering, ""<Dunael> That'd make some lass's heart flutter. Ho!"" That last exclaimation appended to attract the Breewoman's attention.
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

Startlement causes the basket to loosen from her grip. Rowana backpedals and almost tumbles to the mud if it were not for a shopper arriving. The male lays a gentle hand to Rowana's elbow to help steady the older woman. She murmurs gratitude and brushes away the damp tendrils from her face. Nimdok is given no heed for the sight at her face causes a grave expression. 

Rowana sighs and crouches to gather the fabrics when fell out of the basket. Her work muddied. Blue eyes, though saddened, do try to smile up at the newcomer. ""Ah, good day, kind sir. Are you here for the festival?"" 

Rubbing his hand across his lip, Nimdok covers his mirth at the woman's timorous reaction; that reinforcing his perception of the faint-hearted Breefolk. He paces forward to recover a scrap of cloth, unabashed by the other's inattention. The scrap is wet, its colour overlaid by the yellowish mud. He adds his own reply to the woman's question, despite it not being addressed to him, ""<Westron> Yes. Festival."" and offers that retrieved material towards the picker.

Nimdok's action isn't lost to Rowana who suspiciously narrows her eyes, though with a faint twinkle. Lips impishly tighten to a brief smile before shoved to a scowl. ""<Westron> My heart is not as faint as you'd expect,"" she murmurs, frankly reading his expression. Fingers brush when she accepts the scrap. ""<Westron> Thank you. Your language startled me. It has been long since I,"" a chuckle. She twists another muddied piece of fabric to squeeze the water out and stares directly at the foreigner. ""<Westron> How is your friend's stomach?"" 

His cocked brow arcs a little higher, a twitch catching the corner of Nimdok's mouth before it is disciplined and he thumps his hand against his chest, casting an accusing side glance at the Breeman who had assisted the woman a few moments early, ""<Westron> But of course no. Would be a churl who'd say such of a lass. Many would expect lasses to be less brave but not us, Dunlendings."" Theatrically, the Stag hunter makes that claim in his unschooled Westron, the command of that tongue not adept. 

Casually wiping his muddied hands against his cloak, the Dunlending asks, ""A long time? And which friend?""

Theatrics bypass Rowana's disciplines for she begins to chuckle behind a cupped hand. The sign of age sparks when her eyes squint with that laughter to which she graciously bows her head. ""<Westron> Then I withdraw my claim for you do bare good manners."" More smiles alight. As she fiddles with her basket in rearranging the materials, she casually answers. 

""Your friend. You both speak the same. Uses a bow? I don't know his name, but he shot my good friend in teh shoulder."" 

Continuing to reply in Westron, Nimdok responds to the woman's silent laughter, his own spilling richly forth as he nods, ""Good woman. My friend..?"" He pauses, eyes indrawn as he thinks before asking, ""Tall man, like me. With nice combed hair?"" He runs his hand through his own long tangled hair, dislodging the hood. ""Might be Tyrek or perhaps Brekvek? Brekvek is foolhardy and stupid enough to shoot an arrow in a crowd. He not a good archer.""

Flippantly the red-haired woman waves her hand in an exaggerated manner. ""Must have been Brekvek. Only the untrained archer would believe he could make that shot."" Rowana's eyes scrutinize, carrying a knowledge of archery unlike many women in Bree. When her fingers clasp the basket's handles, the callouses, old, not new, could be seen mixed with needle pricks. ""Four, nay five! Five people were tackling a pig no more than a few hands wide. My friend could have died so naturally I,"" she begins to flush at the sound of her wildish ways, ducking her head, ""punched him."" 

""Punc--? I see, it does sound like Brekvek. Achs but how I would make much fun of him tonight! That bump on head from rescuing lasses!"" Nimdok starts to laugh. ""Not good archer, Brekvek. Tell him many times. Practise but he no like listening. Men, no like listen. Ye woman understand?"" His brow wraggles at the redhead Bree, ""So why four, five folks torture one pig? Wild pig ate from yer gardens?""

Rowana's amusement plays along with the idyllic tones of Nimdok. Listening to his attempted command of Westron and his expressions draws smiles to her face. Then it lessens into a deep red tinge at her cheeks. Arms cross her dampened chest with the basket hung over her abdomen. ""I was *trying* to save the pig! The councillors had the idiotic idea to have a Wild Pig Hunt. Whomever captures or slaughters the pig would be Mayor for the Day! I thought it monsterous!"" 

Mirth still glinting in his eyes, ""Eh? Save pig? Pig make good eats."" A practical man that Nimdok is as he continues, ""But wild pig no so juicy as home pig. Home pig no run, get fat and soft. Juicy."" He smacks his lips, expressing his delight at the thought. ""Ye no like pig? Then what eat? And what this 'M-a-yor for day'?""

A hand touches her chest, thumb soothingly brushing against the hollow of her throat. Rowana's chin sets firm with eyes disregarding his amusemetn at her expense. ""Pig make no good eat,"" she echoes his verbalization. Her statement carries a hypocritical edge for her fingers lower to brush her leather belt in adverse sorrow. ""I prefer vegetables, fruits, honey, bread. I know not everyone cares for those foods."" Lips brush together in being moistened before she explains the mayor bit. ""Mayor is a ruler. Someone who creates laws or rules for the people. In this case, this winner would be the mayor for only oen day."" 

""Ruler fer day? Hehs, what strange game. At home, chieftain made by chopping head."" His hand goes across his throat. Still amused, Nimdok watches the woman touch her belt with a hint of puzzlement at her assertion, ""Ye wear animal but no animal? Meat make men."" He emphasizes his own assertion with a vigorous flexing of his left arm, ""See meat? Need meat or we die."" Simply stating the facts in his own world, ""Meat make lasses strong. Strong lasses make strong babies.""

Critically, openly, dispassionately, the Stag trader examines the Breewoman especially her hips, ""Yer broad there. Make good babies. Need meat make better babies. Bree men no so tall, eh?""

Strength though fading with age is an shadowed echo upon Rowana's body. Hips, indeed, are broad enough for babies. The dispassionate fact hardly shocks the woman who flashes him a flattering smile, before busting a hardy laugh. ""Meat,"" she manages to chuckle, ""does not determine if babies are made. Strength to child is born from the mother and father. The way we live and grow determines that."" 

Equal criticism of the Stag trader returns for her eyes scan his muscles and stature. The tip of her finger taps against the cleft of her chin. If she approves, that remains masked behind her gentle words. ""Meat adds weight and a round pot belly. You wouldn't want to grow into a bear, would you?"" She bashfully winks and ducks her head low with a hand raised to her flaming cheeks. Shock. Her eyes blink in a manner of -- did she *just* say that?! 

""No what the wise mothers says. And Mama says same too."" That last added as if it is a clincher in his defense, a brief grin flashing. ""I eat meat. Ye eat yer bread and grains. A pot belly?"" He feigns an offended pout, patting his still taut belly maintained by his rigorous schedule as a trader in rough-and-tumble Dunland. ""Me no Bear. Me sister, she the Bear."" Nimdok's eyes twinkle merrily at the flushing woman, ""Ye no 'fraid me?""

[Rowana]""Am I suppose to be?"" 

Rowana's head glances to the left and right, noticing for the first time why the question was asked. The Breefolk give the Dunlending wide birth. Some mothers corral their children from approaching, going to such lengths as crossing the center street! Her brows knit to form a brief frown. Momentary for her cheeks remain warm to the touch and she clenches her basket's handle. Light breath. She recomposes herself and looks Nimdok in the eye. 

""You're no more frightening than a hungry bear. Dear sir, orcs are more terrifying than ye. But what do you mean by your sister is a bear? Does she have a lot of brown hair?"" 

Flicking his hand across his nose, Nimdok watches the woman's reaction, heedless of the drizzle that continues to moisturize his skin as he observes with interest. A curt nod at the woman's quick recomposure from her reality check and he chuckles, ""Ye no 'fraid. Stubborn eh? I like!"" He declares that, thumping his chest with a fist. 

Solemnly, the trader nods his agreement with the redhead, ""Ye know of orcs? I surprise. No many would know of those beasties. Indeed a hungry Bear is fearsome, though a mother bear... *whoosh*"" He shakes his hand limply, expressing his supposedly tremor at that thought, ""Ayes, a Bear. Nays, my sister no have brown hair. Black hair, like blackbird. She chieftain of Bears. Like I part of Stag."" He attempts to explain the political structure of Dunland simpl

The most delicate of creatures especially the ladies in finery duck under canopies and doorways to avoid any remote chance of damaging their garments. Rowana completely ignores the weather, standing before the Stag as though the day were sunny. She merely brushes her thumb beneath the eyes to wipe away droplet build-up, but remains smiling and friendly. A laugh breaks anew at his fist chest beat. ""There is a saying about those with my hair -- we're as stubborn as a tree stump. Which means we don't stand down against orcs. And yes,"" she solmenly lowers her head, ""I know of them enough to be wary. Others here take bliss in never knowing what truly lies beyond these gates."" 

Eyes shadow to a distant thought, drawn to a dark time. She shivers before clearing her throat abruptly. ""Chieftain. How many chiefs do you have?"" 

Chuckling, ""Fire on yer head and within yer belly? Ayes, I see that. Though at home, lasses all like that."" Crow's feet creases as he lowers his arms. ""Though standing front of orcs maybe no so good no-tion. Ye make good snack."" Nimdok snaps his teeth together.

Minding the Breewoman's expression, the Stag tucks his hand into his belt, curiosity touching his eyes at her words, ""Ye knows of orcs? They no come here. No think. No seen. Many many in my home but never see here. Ye travel?"" His questions trundle forward tactlessly before answering her question, ""Depends on who ye ask. Three <Dunael> clans </Dunael> we have. And each have one chieftain."" He uses his own native word to describe the main 'families' of Dunland.
When Nimdok's teeth snap, Rowana's snap back. ""They'd discover there's more snap to this lass if they came here."" The vow roots deeply, rumbling overtones of a mother bear. The severity of her expression wans to a distinctive measure of interest. Her head tilts to the side as she tries to pronounce the Dunael word. ""<Dunael>..la..s?</Dunael>"" Failure. Butchery. ""Tribes? Hm. Family? House?"" She scratches at her forehead, chuckles, and sways backward on her heels -- a strange girly motion which draws more flushes. ""I did travel in my youth. Saw many things. Learned maan--"" She is cutoff by the sound of a boy. His bout of laughter can be heard two streets away. Attentive and concerned, she pardons herself. ""I...I am sorry. We have talked and I didn't get your name."" More laughter continues and she's torn between leaving or not. ""I...I am Rowana. I must go. That's my..son."" Another flush rises with lashes falling in shame. Self-pity. ""I hope to see you again!"" And the woman disappears into the rain soaked crowds.

Rowana RPed as herself

Aug 25, 1436

<lj-cut text=""Desc of Rowana""> 
Rowana
Between young and old, Rowana's mid-years kindly warm her slow-aging features. Skyclad blue eyes of friendly acceptance exhibit faint crowsfeet, adding a slight mysterious shroud to her past. The tall tale signs of creases on the brow show deep worrisome thought. A tinge of pink stains the cheekbones along with a tiny perk of the lips. Her skin, though smooth, is tanned and worn enough from years in the sun. Twisted and wrapped into long braid, a few fiery red and silver tendrils spill out from the ears in tiny curls. Blue ribbon knots the end of the braid. 

Rowana's clothing is a walking advertisement to her trade. A simple white peasant dress flows down to her ankles. Detailed stitches of gold ivy leaves and red berries wrap around the wrist and hemline. Clutching a rather tiny frame is a deep brown and gold corset, tied with silk laces. At first glance, the corset is rather plain. But upon closer inspection, the intricate weaves repeat an ivy leaf pattern. About her waist tightens a basic brown leather belt with a set of iron keys and a money pouch hung over the hip. Again, the ivy pattern repeats, having been burned into the leather belt and money pouch. The woman, not much for adornments, wears a single ring on her left ring finger, a simple gold weave knot.

"event","Twas a dark and stormy night... Not stormy in the usual sense... In the usual sense it was a moonless, gorgeous, summer night, pushed along by pleasant breeze giving everyone relief from the oppressive August heat.

The Bear Quarter is fairly quiet, though the are two to turn heads. They come from the temple square and they bear cloaks and hoods. Their walk is slow, as though expectant.

The hour -is- late though the night is dark and stormy in the unusual sense. The glory of a clear night, warm breeze encouraging the Bears in the quarter to linger on their porches though curious eyes turn, wondering at the sight of two cloak and hood bearers. The few militia guards that frequent the streets saunter closer, more from the desire to do something rather than the presence of duty. One, an arm missing, calls out, ""Who comes at this late?"" The question lazily posed.
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

The first of the two, a short man, comes to a stop as does the one following behind and to the left of him. The first raises a hand from within the cloak motioning the guard over, gently.

A questioning cant and Kal obligingly steps closer, ""Ayes?"" The others crowd a few paces behind the one-armed man. A few of those onlookers move closer to the edge of the road, avid observers for the moment.

The man behind produces a cloth wrapped object about a foot long and about four inches wide. ""We would speak with the Lady of the Bear."" he says hoarsley. ""Please take this to her, still wrapped."" the man behind continues, ""she will open it herself as we remain here, and she will permit the visit.""

Slightly taken aback, Kal extends his right arm, deftly wrapping fingers around the object, balancing it and then looking at the other man, the one who had offered the bundle, ""What's this then?""

[Yulen] The man in the rear says hoarsely, ""It is an item she will personally recognize."" His arm retracts.

The red-clad militia man hesitates, his fellow guards behind him rumbling before one advises, ""Open it, Kal. It might be something that could hurt the Lady."" Kal hesitates even longer, thoughtfully eyeing the 'messenger' before he firmly says, ""Stay here. Ye laddies keep them in sight!"" He heads towards a dark porch, a few houses from where the two visitors are stopped.

[Yulen] The two stay in place, hopefully right in the laddies' sights -- unless said laddies are drunk, tired, or otherwise leave their current positions.

A firm rap at the door and Kal enters. Minutes passed before the one-armed man comes out, crooking a finger to those who wait closer to the porch. The guards swing aside, a path opening to the porch before they move back into position behind these men.

[Yulen] The rear man begins walking first, stepping around the shorter man who then follows the other toward the house, slowing as they approach the guard outside the porch.

Kal stands at the top of the stairs, the door behind him swinging open and Ryanne comes out, her face in the shadows while the glow from the fireplace outlines her from behind. The Bear chieftain is tying her hair back as she asks, ""Why?""

The two men come to a stop, side by side, on this dark night, still hooded. They remain silent, watching the arriving Lady. The hoods turn enough to allow the two to look under each others hoods, then turn back to Ryanne.

She remains silent, her expression still in the shadows as she waits. From the house, the domestic sounds of a household readying for the night could be overheard. A couple of female voices, two lower bass ones and laughter.

Kal moves back to Ryanne's side while the other guards stream up the porch stairs, taking their positions, carefully concealing their nosiness.

The gruff voice says softly, but in a volume that could cover the porch, ""We would speak with you in private,"" he says dully, ""without as much 'audience.'"" A pause is given, before the voice adds, ""Please.""

The one armed guard clears his throat, ready to voice his objection though Ryanne raises her arm, her voice quiet, ""More secrets? Achs ..."" She asks, weariness in her voice though she stands tall and straight in the doorway. She starts to turn away, that half twirl a refusal when there is a soft click. Her guards start to relax though they remain in place.

Her shadowed head looks down, the bundle unwrapped in her grasp, a lighter shade of gray against her gown, her hair loosely tied back at her nape floating as the night breeze winds its fingers through the thick tresses. She hesitates, a long moment of indecision before she turns back, ""Have it yer way. On the porch then. Kal? No one interferes."" She speaks sternly as the shift militia man starts to protest.

Moving to the benches on the porch, Ryanne sits, waving to the other close by, ""Speak yer mind. The guards willna interfere."" She places the bundle on her lap. Kal accompanies, cradling a lantern and hanging it overhead before retreating so he is out of earshot but keeping Ryanne in his sight. The others disperse to the stairs.

The shorter of the two speaks in a more pleasant voice. ""Please forgive this way of meeting."" Yulen says gently, ""There is more to the death of our cousin than most people are aware."" The Chieftan, who has outlasted his cousin now pauses only briefly. More warmly, he continues, ""I am Yulen Chaquel and this is Kentri Hallen, and we are both greatful for your speeding word from south.""

Watching as the two men accepted her invitation, Ryanne's stiff posture remains though her face relaxes in a smile, the words serving as recognition. She examines the two men, her tone even, regret in that evenness, ""I am sorry it had not arrived in time to do much good. Nekenyu... He's a good man, perhaps youthful in his idealism but his heart was in the right place. Sit, sit. Ye've not come to call just on this matter.""

""Actually, it arrived in time."" Yulen says grimly, with a bit of a rasp. ""That is why the Guardian's were summoned.... They were not.... enough."" The voice stops and the gruffy one continues. ""Nekenyu and the guards relayed the message and the rest of the story to the rest of the Watch guards in Kierkgard -- including the identity of the man who would have sent them.""

""Watch guards..? The guardians in the Holy City, Yulen Chaquel? Achs but I've heard that ye've taken Nekenyu's torch and become chieftain? In place of Cortheon, who died and mysteriously re-emerged again alive but unwilling to resume that seat?"" Ryanne asks that, a marvelling tinge to her voice. ""Tis like the old tales that Warren and Elrabin sings sometimes. So unbelievable yet it happened..."" She continues her examination of the two Stags in front of her.

""We live in perilous times,"" Yulen says, putting the storm in the night. ""Cortheon's death was faked so Nekenyu could escape Kierkgard and remove Degger."" he continues, ""However, the real resurrection is of a clan whose name has not been uttered here in a long time, even in memory."" The Chieftan pauses to emphasize the next word. ""Boar.""

""Resurrection? The Boars...?"" Ryanne falls silent at this revelation, ""Where ... did ye hear this name, Chaquel? Ye be right, it has been long since that name has seen the light of day or even been uttered in this land. From the records that Warren reads to me, there is no such clan left in Dunland. There are tales of horror attached to that name but I've not heard those tales, deeming them of antique value...""

""Kentri has heard the story himself, Lady Bear,"" Yulen says softly, ""So I shall have him tell it."" The hood turns lightly toward his companion.

Gruff, gruff and more Gruff comes from the hooded Kentri. ""After your messenger told the story to Nekenyu, he came to me."" he begins, ""Do you remember the attempted assasination where Nekenyu and a foreigner spent a few days with the Guardians?""

""Ayes, I've heard that tale told."" Ryanne concurs without hurrying the other man's narration.

""When they were released, the foreigner visited upon Nekenyu for his inconvenience of being involved."" Kentri's more-than-one-too-many-drinks type voice continues, ""He 'ordered' Nekenyu to join his 'brigade down south.'"" He pauses the tail a second. ""You know he never would have said yes, even without the Degger business."" the Lieutenant of the Guard gruffs, ""So the foreigner said explictly that Nekenyu's 'head would be the first to roll.'"" The hood turns gently from side to side. ""He claimed the name Saevern and the clan Boar."" explains Kentri, ""Then your message -- we planned to get help if they came -- but half a dozen Guardians...""

Ryanne hears the man out, leaning forward to catch the odd words as Kentri's hoarse voice goes on. The light falls onto her black hair, her face continually in the shadows, sighing at the end of the narration, ""Tis a sad state that one clan's misfortune could lead others to try and profit from the chaos. So ... there is someone who believes that they hold a key to reviving this dead clan. I dinna know the Wulf Ri's mind but I dinna hold to that. Tis hard enough that keep ourselves together heart and soul with just the three major clans, the rising of a new alliance.... That path stinks of ill fer all our people."" She glances sideways at Yulen, her angled head quietly seeking the third man's view.

Yulen's voice offer's Ryanne's ears a respite. ""While there is a harmony and a balance in three, I would not make a statement now as to what would be the future,"" Yulen says lightly, ""That's a long debate."" The Chieftan pauses to change topic. ""But I would consider, after recent events, anything of the Boar to be...."" Yulen says flatly, ""a grave threat to my people and to all of our peoples. If this Saevern is ever found here again..."" The Chieftan's voice trails off...

""And long debates should be left to meetings rather than on pleasant nights like this,"" replies Ryanne with a small smile, the Bear woman too taking a sidestep away from that and allows the change of subject, ""Perhaps ye would put yer bards to work, so that all of Dunland would know of this man through song. If ye so chooses.""

Lightly her hand touches the base of her throat as she continues, ""I feel yer pain, I've heard ye were close to yer kin and I... I've some softness fer Nekenyu. His shell conceals a kind heart."" A wist of a breath slips out, ""Tis unfortunate that there was misunderstanding between us that will never be resolved now. Perhaps in the halls of Kiern, there we can seek conciliation. But to this Saevern man."" Her voice hardens, ""If what ye say be true even through hearsay, this man is dangerous.""

Yulen does not speak immediately. ""We have heard little else on the subject, though there were witnesses that night the threat was made. And we may never know what happened."" he says gently, ""Many thoughts on the subject have been discussed... But if ever it were to be a crime to be in a clan, the Boar have now earned it.""

Quietly, Ryanne looks up at her visitors. ""Perhaps. I would hold my judgement until I see better on this matter. But if Guardians were involved, Captain Borumha would be, should be involved..."" She falls silent again, her hand criss crossing over her torso, the shawl that she had worn through all of winter and spring abandoned in this hot weather, yet she trembles a little.

Almost at a tangent, her comment drifts forth, ""Sometimes I feel like we live within this immense fog, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end. When we think to attach ourselves to any point and to fasten to it, it wavers and leaves us; Yet if we choose to follow it, it eludes our grasp, slips past us, and vanishes for ever. Nothing stays for us. We live in interesting times, Yulen.""

""Interesting isn't the word I think I'd chose."" Yulen says with a light amusement, but then loses it as he continues. ""But this is a matter which would not sit well with the people."" he explains while standing. ""Hence it is not a public discussion. Kentri stands in turn. ""Stay safe, and it is good to know there is another who would stand against the madness that is the Boar."" Yulen says, ""If there is no further business, I shan't keep you.""

The weariness returned and Ryanne remains in her seat, a flutter of a hand brings the watchful Kal to her side and asks with a smile, ""Would ye escort them back safely, Kal? I will linger here a while until ye return. I've tasks fer ye to run."" 

Glancing over, Lady Bear thanks the two Stags with a nod, ""I bid ye fair sleep when ye turn in and I will see ye at the Meeting of Chieftains when ye come fer confirmation in the fall.""

Night deepens before her bodyguard returns and it was long hours before Ryanne takes to her rest. Clan Bear starts to move again.

<lj-cut text=""Yulen's Desc""> 
At a third of a foot short of six feet, this lean, muscular man's light gray eyes sit like jewels atop high precipices of cheekbones. Short mid-brown hair sits scraggly atop his traced, dusky face of taut dusky skin and thin, stretched mouth.

A royal blue tunic complete with full length sleeves hangs gently from near-flat shoulders bearing a white stag standing sideways, but facing forward. Below, tan trousers are cuffed into dull black books. The tunic is drawn together at the waist by a black leather belt holding a silver stag in the front. When needed, he wears a brown cloak with a large stag standing in place seared upon the back.""

"event","The Dunlending caravan slumps into the surrounds of Bree, stone houses to the left, wooden buildings to the right, wet cobbled stones underfoot. Roofs looming overhead enclosing the paths within an invisible blanket of hot air which presses down on those who dare brave the streets of this town, whether in search of fun or in the pursuit of more solemn pursuits. The heavy rain from the early morning has lightened to a soft drizzle, the misty raindrops staining the tunic of one Nimdok Arvey. The Stag trader has just splashed into a puddle as he jumped out from the caravan and is looking at his waterlogged boots.

Coming down the road from near the Prancing Pony is the very soaked Tyrek Zander, and the obligatory two guards -- also very soaked. This most unpleasant day leaves no fabric undrenched. ""If you stare at it long enough, the otherone will be just as wet."" says Tyrek in Dunael shaking his sopping mat of hear gently. ""And 'long enough' only means about five minutes.""
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

Canting his head, Nimdok straightens and then a lazy hand waves a brief greeting, ""Tyrek. Have ye been to that tavern then? Is it crowded there?"" Squelching his way out from the puddle, the Stag trader turns to face his clansman.

""On a day like today?"" he asks with a smirk on his face, ""It'll be worse in there than out here -- atleast hear that water's fresh."" He continues approaching. A light shrug says, ""If you wear a cloak, you sweat through... if you don't, you soak through."" Finally reaching the organizer of the trip he chuckles, ""And I still haven't gotten my the secrets of the Pumpkin Pie.""

Smacking his lips together at that memory, Nimdok chuckles, ""That woman's mouth is clamped tighter than a skinflint's purse at that local festival auction. But it was good tasting and might win ye some glad points with the lasses back home. -I- wouldna mind stealing those mushrooms meself. Those hobbits have a dab hand at cooking those infernal muckeaters.""

A gentle laugh escapes Mister-Lanky-who-could-afford-to-eat-a-few-more-pies. ""Indeed, they were good."" Tyrek says softly, ""But the ability to sell them ourselves back home would be even better.""

""The ability? Do ye doubt any of us, Tyrek?"" chuckles the Stag trader, his head shaking at his clansman's expressed reservation, ""Those who came on this trip are filled with the verve and lust fer profit, ayes, myself especially."" Nimdok admits that unreservedly. Glancing past the other man's two guards at the Prancing Pony, ""There's wealth in thar building though it be useless metal. Useless to us perhaps back home but with that, we could improve the lives of those who hunker down back home.""

Tyrek snickers absently. ""I'd a had it too, had I not had to save a bunch of them Halflings and fools from a boar they wanted to play with."" he says, looking at Nimdok who is looking over his shoulder at the sign to the Prancing Pony.

Absently wiping the drizzle that streams off his damp hair, Nimdok squints his eyes as the afternoon sun suddenly thrusts its bright rays across the rooftops and highlighting one of the Dunlending carts parked close to the Prancing Pony. ""Save these fools? Now why would ye wanna do that, Tyrek?"" The trader looks back at the other man.

""Simple,"" he says with a light chuckle, looking Nimdok over. ""You lose your mind while I was gone, eh?"" Tyrek asks with a wide grin and a jumor in his voice. ""They can't trade if their _dead_.""

Nimdok's jocular humour fades at Tyrek's words, ""Dead? How do ye mean, Tyrek?"" He asks that edgily.

""Ahhh...."" Tyrek says gently, ""You must notta heard how Bekveh got busted up while we took the long-way into Bree."" He shakes his head. ""The locals were playing catch with a wild boar and it started doing them some serious harm.""

""Nimdok, you better be staying out of trouble,"" comes a familiar voice leaving one of the many buildings about the Centre of Bree. Ayan makes his way toward Nimdok and his fellow conversant.

""Indeed, that's a tale I've missed! Catch with wild pigs? Are the Breefolks really that brave to tackle one of those beasties? I'd not thought that possible, Tyrek."" grins Nimdok, a twinkle in his dark eyes at the other man's news, ""So what did Bekveh do -this- time? Stood in the path of a charging porcine to protect a lassie?""

Nimdok's eyes turn towards Ayan as the Bear speaks, ""Achs, but ye're not -ma- watchbear, Ayan. Tis the other way. Ma sister placed yer safety in mine keeping. Have ye manage to find out what ye needed to find out?""

Ayan raises an eyebrow at Nimdok as he makes his comments to him. ""She gave me nothing to find out other than to keep you out of trouble. Unless she forgot to voice something to me in our brief meeting after I got back from Crebain to running to catch the caravan here.""

""Afternoon,"" the Stag Second says to Ayan with a nod. Turning his head back to Nimdok, Tyrek explains, ""Well, I put myself between the boar and the bree guard who as about to pass out from a nice gaping wound to the bone, and bekveh was actually trying to get the thing to charge him instead of all the fools."" He pauses suddenly, then adds out of context, ""Actually, there was this one idiot who wanted to catch the pig without killing it -- managed to buckle a belt around it and nearly got killed for it.""

""Catch a wild pig alive? Such stupidity deserves to be weeded out. Why risk our lives fer these 'fools' as ye've named them, Tyrek?"" asks Nimdok curiously, his hand swings his cloak over his shoulders, too late to shade from the rain as his tunic starts to darken with the wet. His glance catches Ayan again, a half grin at the Bear's comment, ""Achs, tisna my business though I remembered her mumbling something about tracking this merchant who sometimes comes through Dunland to Bree. She received news that there is something odd about this Renulf.""

A gentle shrug comes from the Second. ""As I said, they can't trade if they can't breathe."" The soaked man looks Ayan over gently then turns back to Nimdok. ""Besides, might also make others more willing to trade.""

""What?"" Nimdok rumbles, his sharp glance taking in the Second's reticence, ""Ye've travelled long and hard with Ayan in the caravan. Are ye not at least comfortable with his presence if not his clan?"" The stoop shouldered man rubs at his sleeve, flickering dampness of his tunic before continuing, ""Death is our lot, those of us who chooses to leave the safety of our homes, Tyrek. That's why we are glad fer the Watch's presence to guard our way. Jarrett's being a little quiet though I see he's trading well fer pipeweed. Pipeweed..."" A gust of regret is expelled as he glance back at the Bear, ""Ye're lucky ye dinna indulge in that vice, Garr!""

Ayan smirks a bit at Nimdok. ""I heard nothing of such an individual. I don't think I have ever met such a man before, at least not be that name."" Ayan looks over at Tyrek for a moment and back at Nimdok. A low chuckle rumbles from within his chest. ""Nah... I indulge in a vice that is wet and more often than not smooth.""

Tyrek chuckles gently. ""I'm not used to him so wet."" he says flatly. ""And if death is your lot, I'm sure the Breefolk can arrange a wild boar."" The second turns back to Ayan, ""Well, now that you mention it... I have heard a rumor that I believe was about this Bear here that... really says somethin'.""

""Him so wet?"" arches one of Nimdok's brow as he asks curiously, ""Achs but ye mean this rain? Jarrett's being in worse weather."" A shoulder shrugs off the subject, his eyes turning towards Ayan, ""Ales. Tosh, pukish garbage. What's I've been served anyways. Ye've tasted better?""

Ayan snorts at Nimdok and shakes his head. ""Such are those that don't enjoy such a good brew."" Ayan shrugs his shoulder before glancing at Yulen. ""A rumor about me? Do tell. I would be interested to here it.""

""Now, I could be wrong about this,"" he says gently, ""but I have I have had it told to me that a message came from you converning Nekenyu Wylden."" Tyrek pauses briefly. ""One that was not, apparently, adequately headed.""

""Maybe you should go about speaking of it so I can speak of its truth or not,"" Ayan suggests. The trapper has never been one to be kept waiting or mencing words.

The rain lightens even more as the day draws on, the conversation between the Dunlendings wringing a thirst from Nimdok and he proposes, ""Achs but let's move somewhere drier.""

Ayan raises an eyebrow at Tyrek. ""I am not sure if it needed to be adequately headed. I told the messenger to relay the danger an aggression of individuals from the south. I assume the message got to him, but it did not prevent his death from what I have heard. I can only do so much when I have my own duties to the south.""

""It was headed."" Tyrek says sadly. ""We just didn't know that it would take an army of Guardian's to keep him safe."" The bean-pole of a man sighs gently. ""Had you been, you likely would have been at the least close to dead, as well."" says the second slowly and delicately. ""But it is very good to know that even those of another clan respected Wylden enough for that."" Tyrek adds, ""If not any man.""

Nimdok glances aside at Tyrek's comment, a flush of red edging past his cloak along his neck though he continues to listen, his fingers busily retrieving his implements of pipe and weed though he lacks fire at the moment.

Ayan raises an eyebrow. ""An army? It was one man or two of them that I knew of. Why would you need an army?"" The Bear trapper seems to be a bit confused at the whole situation, not having heard everything from south of Crebain.

""Two watch guards were killed in but a moment or two,"" Tyrek says flatly, ""And then the foreigners escaped through half a dozen Guardians and out the door of the Rest and out the Gates.""

""I see--"" Ayan thinks for a few moments. ""Well, maybe we should head into an establishment and have a drink in the name of Wylden and dry off by a warm fire. Maybe even find comfort in a serving wench for the night.""

Tyrek nods, ""Perhaps so...."" The man goes suddenly silent as though considering something.

""A capital suggestion, Ayan. One that I second enthusiastically."" replies Nimdok before he suddenly asks, ""What's a-brewing in that devious mind of yers, Tyrek?"" The pipe is held loosely in his hand, the cup half stuffed and shielded in his large left hand.

Lower Staddle Marketplace

 The redoubtable Councillor Castle Bridge attempted to bring himself to the forefront by hosting the latest Art auction in Staddle. Many attended with their old 'antiques' in hopes of selling them in order to buy older ones. ALESWYN, RUINE, TATHAR were there selling as well as a small group of Dunlendings. DANIEL was on duty, killing an eye while a pesky buzzing bee kept an eye on him. Whereever these tall dark, not so handsome strangers (CORTHEON, Nimdok and Tyrek temped by YULEN) roamed, they draw attention and controversy while showing some unexpected sparks of gentle kindness especially to young lasses. A hobbit lass is sporting leaving with a coat of multi-colours, a gift from Cortheon."

"event","Like a warm blanket this late summer's night has been pulled over Lothlorien. The cloudless sky opens into a beautiful view for those who care to look up to see what is beyond their reach: the numerous stars of Varda, which have spread out across heaven's field like playful children.
And yet, the summernight is a sultry one, despite its fairness. The overhanging branches of the mighty mellryn prevent those elves that are still out in the gardens at this late hour from admiring Varda's handicraft in full glory.

And one among them is Calriel, whose long white robe and pale-golden head make her not hard to spot. She is bent over slightly, the tip of her nose almost toughing the red petals of one of the roses that call this garden their home.

Through the arch that separates the roadway and the fragrant rose gardens, stroll the edhel Oretaurnas XYZ. His head tip upwards, dark hair smooth past his shoulders and back while his eyes gaze full on the glory of Varda's veil as his feet carries him forward into the bower. Unerringly, he makes his way towards the mallorn and just two steps short of the magnificient trunk, sighs and comes back to himself with a tiny jerk of his head. The sigh soft and wistful, lingers on the night air, a marred note in the tranquility in the perfumed gardens. His night-leeched eyes skim slowly and when the woodsman sees Calriel, a smile spilts his shadowed features. A moment, he hesitates before striding towards the other, the edhel admiring the rose and he clears his throat.
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

As Calriel's white fingers pull away from the flower, a lone petall flutters to the earth. Perhaps that is why the maid's eyes do not turn towards the other that very moment, but she acknowledges his presence with a light tug at the corner of her mouth. 
""Strange it is how some things whither and some do not,"" Calriel says, her voice hollow with melancholy. When she straightens her back and turns herself towards the other, she has to tilt her head upwards to look upon the other's dark face, whearas hers is light like the autumn sun on Hithaeglir's peaks. 
""And who has appointed their years? Who knows the count of their days? And why...""
         - the maiden stops and frowns, her otherwise pallid features disturbed, but the frustratration ebbs away and the elleth falls silent.

Lightly smoothing his plain tunic over his hip, Oretaurnas's dark brow arches enquiringly at Calriel's pensive rhetoric, his voice soft, uncertain as he puts forth his penny's worth, ""Tis the way of Life, Lady. Has it not been said that life at its noblest leaves mere happiness far behind; and indeed cannnot endure it? Perhaps happiness is not the object of life, the withering of some and the blossoming of other. Perhaps life has no object. Perhaps it is an end in itself; and courage consists in the readiness to sacrifice happiness for an intenser quality of life."" He offers that evenly.

Is it a hint of surprise at the other's answer that crosses the female's features? Calriel nods thoughfully in silence, her finger trailing along the stem of one of the roses as if daring the flower to a dangerous struggle. ""It is said that the Sindar are wise, but none ever told me that they think as well,"" she says, her voice less wistful than before. ""That what you say, I must contest. How can life be the object of itself? Are we then naught but plants or animals that walk the earth? Nay, we know we are greater. But when you speak of sacrificing happiness, I find your words to be true. But we sacrifice it to gain an intenser happiness, namely rest and fullness in spirit.""

The lass withdraws her hand, which seems to have withstood its trial without hurt. ""Yet if you must know - I wish not to burden you overly with the inner struggle of my thoughts - why are we preserved of all beings? Why do we suffer life undying? And if we do depart this world, whereto then? While my heart longs for it at times, I bear no great love for Valinor, and yet we know that Aman is the destiny of us all.""

Rose Garden
You stand in a small rose garden dazzled in white, red, and yellow. Placed in an circular pattern about the garden, a walkway made up of small, uplifted ceramic tiles form rings of walking space surrounding a large golden mallorn planted in the center. Shade from its limbs splay outward over this walkspace to provide for a pleasant atmosphere. Here and there, benches, one with a lamp rising up out of the ground next to it, are placed for guests to enjoy the shade and the scenery.

To the south, a tall hedge hides the entrance to the shaded lawn. East, among a gnarly set of old oak trees, a small path leads to the Apothecary, while to the North another path leads to the Northern Gardens. To the West, a gate leads out to the Golden Roadway. Lastly, to the side, sparkling beneath a silver arch, a set of stairs can be seen leading to a talan up above. Shown by the starlight, twinkling down from the sky, all is quiet in the Garden.

[OOC] ""The Green Road is more for various jobs/guilds. The Gold Road has the gardens and the entertainment. The Silver Road the houses, and the White Road the Great Mallorn and the RC home :)""

"event","The afternoon air is warm, moist as befits the occasion, the sun shining bright overhead, highlighting the hair of those gathered in the mushroom field. Smoke wreathes the air, the every present pipes in the grasp of their hobbity owners, baskets at their foot while they wait. Wait. And wait. The crowd grows restless and an older hobbit grunts, ""So why are we here?""

His companion, a matronly figure of a hobbit whispers back, ""It's Councillor Castle Bridge. He had this bright idea of teaching us how to harvest mushrooms.""

""Harvest..."" splutters the old gentleman, ""Isn't that like teaching grandmothers how to suck eggs?""

A lass, having barely reached maturity, strolls into the mushroom field with a large basket dangling from her left arm. She munches on an apple, chewing each bite thoroughly. She reaches into her basket to pull out an apple, everytime she passes a new person. ""Fresh apple? Only one penny for a crunchy apple!""
<<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

A tall man, his length heightened by the rakish tall hat he sports, hurries through the wooden gate, sweat pouring off his brow while his hand dabs at his face with a violently spotted kerchief. Apologising, Councillor Castle Bridge greets those gathered with a wrinkled smile, ""Osh, sorries, folks. Got waylaid by a stranger who needed help getting into Bree for the festival. What a crowd, what a crowd. Just to see me talk about mushrooms?"" He mutters, looking quite pleased as he makes his way towards the front of the field, where a makeshift table has been set up. ""Well, well, well."" 

The afternoon sun burns downwards on this human, the air still and humid. The perfect place for growing mushrooms.

There is a small crowd gathered in the field, mainly hobbits though taller bodies sprout here and there, one of which is a young lass (Elsabea) barely into her maturity who appears more interested in offloading her apples instead of attending the interesting mushroom lecture of Councillor Castle Bridge.

Standing a little more removed from where any distinctive lumping of hobbits or humans have been mingling about, in awaiting the Councillor's arrival, is a Dunlending woman from the group of travelers having arrived in Bree from lands further south a good many days prior. How she ended up among those here at the harvest is perhaps a story in itself for she knows no Westron. Her name is Taphene and with her is her three-year-old daughter who looks about cautiously from the protection of the folds of her mother's dress. Taphene's twilight eyes are at current drawn to the Councillor's arrival.

Making her way through the crowd, ElsaBea swings her apple basket, still offering them to everyone she passes, oblivious to the fact that the tardy Councillor Castle Bridge has no arrived. Just as she was about to pass Taphene, she noticed the child peeking out. Backpedalling slightly, she bends down so that she meets the child at her eye level and beams a genuine smile at the lass. ""If your mama says it is alright, you may have an apple,"" she says, pulling one of the smaller ones from her basket.

To the left of the first pair of Dunlendings is another pair of Dunlendings, again a mother-and-child pairing, though the child is a mere babe in arms, swaddled and tied down against the tall human woman's chest. Donna Shields walks closer to Taphene and whispers to her fellow clanswoman, ""<Dunael> Are they having an execution here, Taphene?""

Councillor Castle Bridge glances around importantly, clearing his throat and speaks, his voice rich and booming, ""Mushrooms. Hobbits love mushrooms.""

A snort of amusement from the old hobbit gaffer at this, ""Tell us something we don't know, Bridge!""

Down towards the front of the crowd, amidst the crowd of fellow little folk, Bodobrus stands awaiting the talk to begin. He removes his hat and runs his pocket handkerchief along the inside rim, wiping off the sweat. The hobbit beside Bodo asks if he'd mind stepping aside, which he does, allowing a couple others to squeeze past. Before replacing his hat, he runs his fingers through his hair, brushing a few sweat-soaked ends off of his forehead.

Frowning down the unrepentant gaffer, the councillor lifts his arms, ""I need a volunteer!"" Castle glances around the crowd expectantly.

Benga, Taphene's three-year old daughter meets ElsaBea's gaze and offer almost boldly but with her facial features half turn away and she watches out of the corner of her eye. The little girls lips, which usually have a tendency to open a sliver over her pearly, little teeth begin to tremble and her left hand tries to wrap around her mother's leg.

Taphene, half distracted between Donna Shields and the rising commotion around and the whimper of her daughter seems remotely confused. It is apparent that she means to make Donna wait a moment as she kneels down and hops Benga up into her lap and now both mother and daughter look with adamant intrigue after ElsaBea. Taphene extends her hand toward the apple slowly, her hand in an orchish glove. ""<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>"" she asks in her native tongue.

The tall human eyes the hobbits, skimming the polite Bodobrus and then across to where the appleseller is attempt something with tall strangers, towards the back at the small human with the baby.

Though obviously ElsaBea cannot understand the language Taphene speaks, she can certainly understand the body language she employs. With a nod of her head, ElsaBea gently pushes the apple towards Benga, regarding her mother the entire time. ""Free, for your pretty daughter,"" she says, speaking very slowly and perhaps a bit louder than necessary.

The other Dunlending woman chortles at her clanswoman's child, ""<Dunael> Achs lassie, it's just an apple. Wouldna bite ye at all. This just one of dem namby pamby town lasses, no bite to them. Giving ye an apple to buy yer mother's favour. Free is free."" Donna glances over to Taphene, ""<Dunael> The town lass is saying it's free and that yer dotter's a pretty one. Mind ye, Benga doesna get too close to one of dem folks. They're soft and perfumed and might teach wrong habits."" The Stag huntress advises before turning to the appleseller, ""<Westron> Why you frighten girl?"" 

Councillor Castle Bridge points to one of the hobbits, ""You. Yes you, the one in the yellow waistcoat. Come here me."" Reluctantly, the selected hobbit ambles forward. ""Good, good. Now, we shall go through what makes a good mushroom. Who knows what we need most to hunt good mushrooms?""

The afternoon air continues to be warm and moist. The field is partially crowded by those waiting to listen to a talk on mushroom harvesting, though the older hobbit gaffers are dubious about the usefulness of such a lecture by a mere human.

Totally oblivious to the harvest, Taphene continues to crouch with Benga in her lap, taking in Donna's words but not turning. A budding smile gently eases into Taphene's expression and some of the chill in her eyes evaporates. ""<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>"" she coos to her daughter with delight. ""<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>""

Benga looks up timidly for a moment, her fear eases as her precious, little features turn into doting in response to her mother's affections. She looks back to ElsaBea and hops from her mother's lap, reaching eagerly for the apple with a bright smile. ""<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>"" she professes determinedly.

A soft padding of footsteps, and grumbling may be heard before Luci steps into view. 'Why me!' she asks outloud, hands are fists, one wrapped tightly around the handle of a small basket. ""I dont even *LIKE* mushrooms!"". Luci glances up and notices a crowd of people, and slows her pace with a frown. ""Great, now it'll take even _longer_"". The young girl doesn't seem to ever be satisfied. She crosses her arms and waits.

Bodobrus hollers in jest up at the councillor, ""What you need most is an understanding farmer, or one who's gone visiting family on holiday."" He glances to either side of himself, smiling, and begins nudging the youngish hobbit beside him knowingly.

The appleseller turns surprised eyes on the second Dunlending woman and asks with an incredulous voice, ""Frighten the child?"" She glances at the mother and child, then back to the second woman again, ""I only offered her an apple. I . . . meant no harm!""

Just as she started to back up slightly, so as to ease the child's fear, the girl hops from her mother's lap and after the apple. A quick laugh leaps from ElsaBea's mouth as she looks at the child and hands the apple over. ""Yours,"" she nods her head, reassuringly.

Forcing himself to chuckle, Councillor Castle waved the yellow waistcoat back and points to Bodobrus, ""You, you willing to be a volunteer then. Willing to put your mouth to the task? I've got this .."" He grunts, leaning down and with some difficulty, picks up and drops a basket onto the table top. "".. basket of mushrooms and it's all yours, if you can identify the different types of mushrooms."" The tall human challenges Bodobrus.

Donna rubs the back of her baby son who starts to stir as laughter rings out at the exchange. ""<Westron> No harm. But girl cry. That apple good?"" The Stag huntress glances over to Taphene, before looking back at the Bree lass.

The arrival of Lucille into the mushroom field is noticed by those closest to the wooden gate and they move aside, making room for this new human.

The little Benga gives a bubble of laughter as she smiles up at the giver of her apple and hops back toward her mother, stumbling to turn around giddily.

Taphene smiles affectionately toward ElsaBea in turn and despite the language barrier remarks thankfully, ""<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>"" Readily she takes her daughter up into her arms and stands, hopping her up around the indent of her waist.

Lucille rubs a hand over her face, letting out a slow breath before running fingers through her short hair.. mussing it slightly. She finally spots a space in the crowd, and notices a few eyes on her. She grins uncomfortably, muttering a 'thank you' as she passes. She looks down at these budding fungi and frowns.. 'Ma should've come for this.. I know Im gonna pick the wrong ones..' She walks along a little more, and comes to a small patch of 'shrooms with long stems and smaller hats. She kneels down and begins to pluck 'em one by one.

The field is crowded with hobbits and humans attending the lecture of Councillor Castlebridge. The afternoon sun is slowly trailing across the clear blue sky, warming those in attendance. Taphene with Benga is facing Elsabea. The friendly Bree appleseller had just given an apple, free (!) to the young Dunlending child while beside them Donna Shields acts as mis-interpreter to the transaction. Lucille is standing by the wooden gates, a basket in hand, watching those in the area. 

The councillor has just tossed a gauntlet down, challenging Bodobrus to come up, offering a basket of mushrooms for some yet unknown task.

The apple-giving lass ignores Donna for the moment, finishing first her exchange between Taphene and Benga. Sometimes language barriers are not quite the barrier one would imagine, for ElsaBea has not actually understood the other woman's words, but the meanings have been clear. A smile on her face, she nods her head once more in response, says ""You are welcome,"" then turns back to Donna.

Her smile fades to give way to a scowl as she replies to the Westron speaking Dunlending woman. ""Of course the apple is good. I would never hurt a child!""

The few hobbits in front of Bodobrus part, allowing him to approach the table where Councillor Castle stands. ""Absolutely willing, and more than up to it,"" Bodo answers back, his eyes growing wide as he looks upon the basket in front of the tall man. ""I ought to give you fair warning, though,"" the hobbit cautions, ""I've eaten mushrooms east to west, north to south. I fancy myself something of an expert.""

And already Benga proves that is it a delicious apple, for her small mouth gives a might bite! And the apple crunches wholesomely. It is a delighted expression upon Benga's face as she glows up at her mother, who gently bounces her for a few moments. ElsaBea has surely won over both outlandish mother and her child, for each in turn gives her stray glances of appreciation, she seemingly having eased their awkwardness a good deal.

Lucille's stomach begins to grumble as she finishes picking the last of the small patch of 'shrooms. She puts a hand over it and sighs. Truth be told, she hasnt eaten since the day before. Slowly she stands and counts what she has collected. ""Definately need more"" she mutters as she starts walking further along, eyes focused completely on the small fungi at her feet.

Elrabin wanders around the field somewhat, trying to keep out of the way and not step on anything fungal. He might be shorter than the average Dunlending, but he'll give any Breelander a run for their money, and he still has twice the height of most hobbits. There's a self-esteem boost if ever there was one. ""<Dunael> Good afternoon, ladies,"" he says to Donna and Taphene as he approaches. Tilting his head slightly, he notices ElsaBea and repeats the comment in a stilted, jarring Westron.

The Stag huntress from Dunland frowns at the appleseller's shrewdish tone, ""<Westron> I hear you person no like strangers. Why give apple? If not good apple?"" Donna glances over as a shadow enters her vision, and she sees another Bree woman, this time one gathering what appears to be motley patches of white and brown from the dirt, ""<Dunael> Taphene, look! These people are so poor, they eat dirt!""> She points at Lucille with a stabbing finger.

""An expert, eh? Good good, just what I need. You say you've eaten mushrooms from east to west and possibly all around. Now how about telling me what a good mushroom picker needs most? And I will wager something else. That you can't smell what a mushroom is just from smell!"" The tall human councillor smirks a little as he watches Bodobrus come forward to where he stands.

Though most people would appear uncomfortable around people with whom they could not verbally communication, ElsaBea does not seem to feel that way around Taphene and Benga. She stands next to them even as the man approaches. She tilts her head up at the tall man, beaming a smile at him. Pulling another apple out of her basket, she offers it to him and speaks slowly, ""Good afternoon, sir."" Then she offers, ""An apple?""

Lucille cant seem to find more mushrooms that match the ones in her basket exactly. Growing frustrated (as pre-teens often do) she just stops at a large gathering and begins plucking again. *mrawrororor* Luci's stomach just wont give up, and she makes a nasty face at the thought of having to actually eat one of these things to tide her over. She stands upright and looks around, finally spotting first the apples before the seller of said fruit. She licks over her lips and sighs, watching as the woman moves from person to person.

Taphene turns toward Elrabin and gives a slight dip of her head quickly followed by an evasive glance darting over to Donna, from where she follows Donna's stabbing finger aimed toward Lucille; she continues to what Lucille with remote intrigue as the girl gazes near them. Taphene decidedly begins to bounce Benga again, who has kept a resolute, following gaze on ElsaBea, smiling as she, with both hands, takes small bites that often have trouble penetrating the skin of the fruit.

Elrabin looks suspiciously at ElsaBea, narrowing his eyes and taking a guarded stance. He hesitates, moving one hand to near his blade while he reaches out with the other, keeping ElsaBea at arm's length. He opens his hand and waits for her to place the apple in his hand. ""<Westron> Thank you,"" he grumbles out. He glances back, following Donna's gesture, towards Lucille. ""<Dunael> They eat dirt? Barbaric!"" he snorts softly before turning with a softer mien to look at Taphene and Donna again. Just for a moment, though, still retaining some of his cautious eye for the friendly apple vendor. A little... /too/ friendly.

""What a good mushroom picker needs most,"" Bodobrus begins, stretching his reply out a bit while he mulls the answer over in his head, ""would be a good gathering-basket or a sack, without any holes in the bottom."" At this, he nods once, confidently, and crosses his arms.

Lucille scritches her nose, smudging a bit of dirt there as she satisfies an itch. Another stomach rumble urges her forward, unable to wait for the woman to come around. She glances toward Taphene, Donna and Elrabin. They seem to all be looking at her and mumbling something she can't understand. She stares for a time, as if concentrating would help her translate what they had to say. ""excuse me.."" she mutters finally toward ElsaBea. ""Are you giving those away??

Taken aback at the boldness and the glint in Lucille's gaze, Donna moves a few steps backwards towards Elrabin, uncertainty in her expression as she greets the man with a glad smile and a whispered question, ""<Dunael> Why is that one looking at us with such hunger, Elrabin? They .. they ain't child eaters or anything, aye?"" Her hands touch her own baby reassuringly as she asks. ""<Dunael> First offering us apples, while others eat dirt and now .. "" Horrified suspicion dawns into the Stag huntress's eyes.

""Wells, that's all and good. But what a good, a great mushroom picker needs is a nose!"" declares Councillor Castle Bridge confidently, leaning forward to spit his point at the shorter Bodobrus. He taps his nose and makes a snuffling noise through his honker before straightening to a chorus of laughter of those still attending to the exchange. A few of the others are turning to look at the strangers, eyes darkening in some anxiety at the back-and-forth conversation partially conducted in an outlandish tongue.

Taphene continues to present an aura of reclusion about her, even among her Dunlending kin, as if she is still not quite comfortable, despite being humored by Donna's comments. Her eyes dart away from Lucille readily and abstractly over Elrabin and Donna before she turns slowly and entirely away, the lowest lengths of her dress following last in delay. The eyes have chased her boldness away. She coos quietly over her child upon her hip and takes a bite of the apple as Benga offers it up to her before greedily taking it back. And slowly Taphene begins to wander away from the gathering near Councillor Castle Bridge.

The afternoon sun drifts across the sky, shedding its warmth indiscriminately on hobbits and humans in the mushroom field. Two separate groups are starting to form, one about Councillor Castle Bridge who is challenging Bodobrus to a mushroom sniffing contest, the other about the Dunlendings who are being fed free apples by the Bree appleseller, Elsabea. Lucille has just approached the second group, hungrily looking for a freebie apple to feed her hunger. The hunger that alarms one of the Dunlending woman.

Lucille's brow arches as she watches Donna move away from her. Surely the woman isnt afraid of her? Luci chuckles before she can help herself, simply smiling at them before looking to Elsabea with hopeful eyes.

The first Dunlending mother-and-child pair of Taphene and Benga had moved away, perhaps heading back to their own trade caravan, the girl-child still contentedly nibbling on the apple given earlier.

Elrabin turns his head towards Taphene as she goes. He calls her name after her, tilting his head back as if to invite her back. He looks back to Donna and kisses her gently on the cheek. ""<Dunael> Nay, love, they'd not eat children, I think... if they did there'd not be so many tiny people around."" His gaze hollows out a little as something else springs to mind. ""<Dunael> Unless they're /breedin'/ them for eatin'."" He places his arm protectively around Donna's waist. ""<Dunael> I ain't thought they'd eat children... I don't think they do, but don't let your guard down, aye? Strange folk live here, and ain't always kind to us.""

The applegiver hands one to Elrabin and, sensing his nervousness towards her, backs away. Now and again she darts a playful glance at Benga. She still continues to ignore the rude Dunlending woman Donna, and when Lucille approaches her she makes a point of turning all her attention to the Bree lass not much younger than herself. ""Yes, of course. I mean, momma and poppa say I am to charge a penny for them but,"" she offers a helpless shrug, dipping a hand into her basket to offer it up to the girl. ""I shall just tell them I got hungry and ate them all!""

Lucille's hopeful hungry look melts into one of relief as she accepts the apple, taking a hurried bite before thanking the girl. *crunchcrunchcrunch* 'mmm..fanxsh!' She crunches s'more and winces as she swallows the mouthful. ""ahhhh.. much better. Im very sorry that I dont have a penny. You wont get in trouble, will ya?"" Luci ponders a moment, then her eyes get wide, ""You could tell 'em that a few was stolen while you weren't lookin?""

Sighing softly, Donna moves into Elrabin's arm around her waist, ""<Dunael> Ye not think, Elrabin? Do ye know this truth fer a fact? Achs but look at that dirt eater,"" flicking her eyes towards Lucille, a shudder breaking her small frame and her arms tighten around her baby, ""<Dunael> Such dark eyes, such hunger. Ye really think they might be breeding these small ones fer food? Like cattle or sheep? In this field? Barbaric! Even the lowliest of our people wouldna eat manflesh!"" She glances back at the appleseller, her large mouth downturning in distrust, ""<Dunael> And this is the people that Nimdok says could offer us much to trade fer?""

Two smallish voices can be heard on the other side of the gate prior to it opening. One, a male voice, says, ""No, no. Just a little further I think. Perhaps in here."" The gate swings open to reveal two hobbits, one of each gender and both with similar facial features. ""Oh yes, this looks like the right place!"" Bingo says excitedly.

Lucille was writing out what she wanted to fix for thanksgiving.. 'I think the hubby has to work that nite :( 4pm-1am the next day. :( we'll just have to have thanksgiving lunch!'

The Dunlending woman winces even more at Lucille's enthusiastic crunching and munching, her dark eyes widening in some disgust, <Dunael> Pigs eat better than that, Elrabin!"" Looking past the pair of Bree women, Donna notices two new small arrivals, ""<Dunael> More of these small ones. Ye're right, they're herding them fer the slaughter perhaps. And that tall one."" jerking her chin at Councillor Castle Bridge, the huntress speculates, ""That one must be the herder. Efficient at least.""

Elrabin receives the apple and gives a slow nod to ElsaBea. ""<Westron> Thank you,"" he repeats. He scrutinizes the apple carefully and then polishes it against his tunic. ""<Dunael> Nay, I don't know it for a truth. I ain't heard any stories of it, but... they're a strange folk, love. If they did breed 'em like cattle... nay, I'd not be surprised."" He looks over to the Councillor and nods gravely. ""<Dunael> I hear rumour of a big feast at the end of the festival..."" he says, letting Donna fill in the gaps with her imagination.

""A nose for picking, well, of course... that goes without saying,"" Bodo repeats, just a tad sheepishly, as the councillor corrects his first guess. The hobbit looks back at the gathered crowd for a moment, then faces Councillor Castle Bridges once again. ""Oh, have I got a nose on me!"" he say, brushing the side of his good-sized nose with his thumb.

Another laugh peals from the appleseller as she speaks with Luci. ""Well . . . I could tell them. But they will know. They always know when I gives them away."" She looks at the other girl more carefully now, then suggests, ""Unless . . . you told them . . . nono. That would be wrong.""

Finally, ElsaBea turns to confront Donna again. ""I offered the girl an apple because she was pretty and seemed nice. Unlike you!"" she accuses straight out, mincing no words. Apparently truth is important to this lass! ""And would you stop looking at me as if I have put poison in the apple? They are wonderful, and if you wanted one you only had to ask me, and I would have given you one!"" She continues to glare at Donna long after she has spoken.

Taking the hobbit's sheepishness in stride, Councillor Castle lifts a corner of the cloth covering the basket and then says, ""Now close your eyes."" He asks Bodobrus, his gestures are grand and theatrical.

Lucille shrugs a shoulder and grins crookedly, having another bite of the delicious apple. She doesnt say a word, however, and simply listens to the confrontation. Poison apple? Surely they didnt think... Luci listens intently and frowns, she too now looks toward Donna as she speaks quietly to ElsaBea, ""She thought you poisoned the apples? Who are they, anyhow?"" another crunch of her apple soon follows, and Luci's belly starts to feel satisfied.

A late comer to the afternoon's festivities wanders into the mushroom field with a less than enthusiastic look as he surveys the large number of people and hobbits that are enjoying the time. Pierce leans up against wooden fench in the far corner, his eyes search the crowds. He mutters to himself: ""Now, where is 'e?"" He shifts his weight nervously as he waits.

""Wellllll,"" the appleseller begins, drawing out the word. ""I cannot say that she actually /said/ that. Exactly. But she was /looking/ at me like I did. And asked why I would give away an apple if it was good. So that means she thinks it is poisonous, right?""

Lucille nods slowly in suspicious agreement. ""Ya know.. now that you mention it. She looked at me and backed away when I walked over!"" Luci makes a face and squints at Donna, then looks back at Elsa. ""Ehhhh.. don't worry 'bout _her_. There are plenty of others that'll appreciate your apples! She can just stay hungry!"" the young girl nods once to emphasize her point.

Bingo peers around the field for a moment, at least moving in far enough and out of the way so as not to be overrun by anyone who walks past. Glancing back to see if his sister is following, he says, ""It looks like quite the busy place. Where would you like to start?""

Elrabin glares at the foreign girl who speaks so harshly of Donna. ""You be nice,"" he growls at ElsaBea in Westron, and the tone of his voice suggests this is not a statement of fact, but rather a command.

Bodobrus screws his eyes shut up tight, then goes ahead and covers them with his right hand for good measure. A wide grin creeps across his face and he wriggles his nose, flaring his nostrils in preparation of his challenge. ""Alright now, I'm all set...,"" he acknowledges.

Deedee, still hiding behind her brother, peeps out from behind his shoulder and looks around cautiously. ""I...I don't know, bro...Th-there's a corner over there that's not too full."" she replies nervously, pointing to a quiet corner. Then, remembering that it is rude to point, she withdraws her hand quickly. Glancing in Pierce's direction, she raises a puzzled eyebrow for a moment before timmidly nudging Bingo in the direction of the quiet area.

Safe within Elrabin's embrace, Donna blinks at the rat-a-tat-tat chatter that the young appleseller sprinkles at her, a jerk of her head backwards as spittle sprays outwards from the excitable Bree woman's mouth, ""<Dunael> What is she yapping about, Elrabin? She's like one of those mongrels in Kierkgard Dun! What is she saying?"" Growing a little upset at her own inability to understand the outpouring from Elsabea, the petite Dunlending huddles her baby close to herself, ""<Dunael> She wants money now fer her apples?""

Patiently, Councillor Castle waits for Bodobrus to close his eyes before revealing what he holds in his hand, his eyes skim the crowd, intently staring at Pierce before exclaiming, ""Ahs, Shire hobbits?"" he calls out to the new arrivals at the gate.

Looking over at Lucille again, ElsaBea nods her head. ""If she is hungry, she can dig for mushrooms like everyone else here. I thought my apples would be better than having to dig for mushrooms. Apples grow on trees,"" she announces importantly, as if most people didn't already know this.

""I was being nice, stranger. Your wife is the one who was being mean, and her a guest in our land. So you teach her to be nice, and perhaps she will be treated more nicely!""

""Lucille! THERE you are.. you wait til I tell Ma!""

A highpitched voice climbs up Luci's spine and reaches her ears. As the young girl turns, she manages to catch the sight of one of her older sisters running back toward their home. ""OOOOH GREAT!"" Luci sighs and glances to Elsa w/an apologetic look. ""I gotta go.."" she starts running backward, calling back toward Elsa, ""I'll get that penny for you! Promise!"" she waves, turns and runs as fast as she can to catch up w/her sister.

The large Rushlight catches Deedee's outstretched finger pointing in his direction, and for a moment he scowls, but it quickly passes. He leans back against the fence which gives slightly under his weight and points with his thumb to a shady spot not too far from where he's standing. ""I won't bite."" He says, half jokingly.

The largee gate, in comparison to the necomer, creeks as a young hobbit lass steps in. Her long brown curls shimmer as they slide about on her shoulders and a small grin brushes over her freckley face, but disappears quickly when she sees the crowd. Although the little face is pale, her cheeks become slightly more pink. After a moment she takes another step in and closes the gate, glancing about to oberve the scene with eyes that sparkle in a way very well-known throughout the Shire.

Bingo simply follows Deedee's nudge without question, then eyes the stranger as he leads Deedee onward. ""See, Deedee? He won't bite."" He smiles pleasantly at the stranger as he continues walking.

Elrabin furrows his brow as he tries to process the back-and-forth between Lucille and ElsaBea. ""<Dunael> I can't keep up with them talkin' so fast. Something about apples and something else..."" He looks suspiciously at the apple, then slowly raises his eyes to ElsaBea. ""Donna is not mean. You do not tell me how to teach her. You treat us nice and you will be good,"" he replies in his stiff, unpracticed Westron.

At first, Deedee looks more than a little frightened by Pierce's words. However, she follows Bingo's lead and smiles (or tries to do so) without seeming too overly nervous. Aside to Bingo, she quietly whispers, ""Do you think he wants a word with us, bro? I can't tell, really...what do you think?""

Pierce surveys the grounds again and shrugs. He turns his attention back to the little folk. Stiffly as one who has walked a great distance would, he lowers himself to the ground and stretches his long legs out. ""I've only just gotten here myself. But the walk was long."" He pulls a full water jug out of a pack, raises it to the two hobbits as an offer and then sets it on a clear patch of grass. He sets to rubbing his calves.

Perhaps she does not realize that the man before her is far more dangerous than anyone she has ever before encountered. Perhaps she does not care. But apparently she is unwilling to allow him to speak rudely towards her, for she glares up at him, ""Donna is her name? Well, Donna is mean. You tell me to treat you nice? I apologize,"" she mockingly offers a bow, ""I did not realize it was rude to offer apples to people from . . . well, wherever it is you are from!"" She takes a step backwards, the friendly countenance seeming to fade and she crosses her arms in front of her chest.

The little lass glances about once more, awed at all of the bigfolk. She sneaks off to the side, from where she watches the ongoing events. Being so small, she could easily be trampled, so she stays alert to motions and stays on her feet.

Elrabin glances to Donna and holds her more firmly in his arm as if protecting her and their son from the strange folk of this land. ""Donna /is/ not mean,"" he repeats. He holds up the apple. ""Is good apple?""

Bingo seems startled briefly at Pierce's actions, glancing at the jug, then back to Pierce, then at Deedee before finally saying, ""Ah, thank you. Very kind, indeed, but ... uh ... my sister, you see, is really very anxious to find some mushrooms and it's already getting a little late in the day.""

Deedee nods vigorously at Bingo's comments and adds, ""Oh, y-yes sir...Thank you kindly for the offer. But we really must be on our way. Perhaps another time?"" The young lady-hobbit in training, obviously is trying her best at manners as she and her brother hurry away, and she offers a more friendly smile before throwing herself into the work of gathering mushrooms.

The baby stirs in her tight hold and Donna presses her face against her child, growing agitation in her stance as she glances between Elrabin and the squawking Bree lass. Arching her brow at the frequent mentions of her name, the huntress scrutinizes Elsabea, the other woman's displeasure keen on her face and crossed arms. Addresses her man, ""<Dunael> She knows my name? Is she cursing or demanding coin from us? Achs but look how she mocks us! Is she not afraid of us? I think ye're right, this isna a friendly land, Elrabin. Why did I say I wanna come?"" 

Meanwhile at the front of the field, Councillor Castle holds his fist under Bodobrus's nose, ""Smell that and tell me what mushroom this is?"" To the educated nose, a delicately hint of apricot wafts upwards from that man's hand.

Pierce shrugs and almost chuckles. ""You ain't seen many humans have, ya?"" He asks, ""'Cause by yer talk, you not from Breehill, near as I can tell."" He man, fully seated at this point, leans back into the fence again, causing it to groan a new. ""We ain't all bad. No, we're just like you, only taller."" He uncorks the bottle and takes a deep swig, ""Well, get yer fill of Bree mushrooms, then. I'm gonna catch me a few winks."" Pierce puts his arms behind his head and closes his eyes.

From listening and watching quietly at the side, little Cicely Gamwich now understands what is going on. They are picking mushrooms. Like a shadow falling over the earth, her nose scrunches up and eyes squint, her lips curl and a face of icky-disgust becomes plain upon her features like a piece of apple pie in a bowl of soup! After a moment's more thought, the child slips out of the scene, heading to find her mother and a warm blueberry muffin instead.

Bodobrus inhales deeply the scent of the mushroom, then takes a couple extra short sniffs, for good measure.

The rude woman turns to talk with her husband in their own language before ElsaBea could have a chance to answer him. She turns away from them to glance about, and notices that the first woman and her child seem to have faded into the background, and the Bree lass with whom she'd been talking has also disappeared. ElsaBea swings the apple basket from her arm again, though this time with a little less joy than in the beginning, and moves towards the front of the crowd near where Councillor Tunnely stands talking. She glances about at the hobbits who have assembled here and, apparently uninterested in mushroom seeking, dashes away.

""Wells?"" asks the councillor, an eagerness in his voice as Bridge waits.

Elrabin smiles faintly at Donna. ""<Dunael> I'd said your name to her. And nay, she said you're mean, I reckon, but most folk here are harmless. I don't know why she gave us an apple... is a strange land, aye."" He squeezes the woman gently around the waist. ""<Dunael> I'm sorry, love. We'd do something fun later, aye? Ye don't worry any though, hmm? It'd be alright, I'd keep ye and Tyler safe."" He watches the apple vendor leave. ""<Dunael> Did you want to share the apple she gave us?""

""That's easy enough,"" Bodo laughs, finding the first challenge so simple as the be amusing, ""Always called 'em Forest Gold... not to be confused with Old Forest Gold, as that's a pipeweed, now. But to call 'em proper, they'd be chanterelles."" Still with his eyes covered, he throws a quick smile out at the gathered hobbits, as he begins backing up his boasts.

Elrabin keeps his arm around Donna and kisses his son on the head. He glares back to all the strange people and all their strange doings before he leads his family back to camp.

Disappointment flashes in Castle's eyes though gamely he hides it with a bluff laugh, ""Very good, Mr Took, is it?"" He opens his hand, a faint glint of yellow as the chanterelle rolls from his palm onto the table. ""Now perhaps another?"" His hand darts into the basket again and fisting it again, the 'shroom hidden within. This time, the scent is a ranker one, a hint of rot underlying the mushroom perfume.

Bodobrus turns his attention back to the matter at hand, the rather important one of winning that basket of mushrooms, and the ever more important one of living up to his claims. ""Now, but a moment, the nose knows, sure enough..."" The hobbit takes another grand sniff, and runs over the various names --both the common and proper ones-- of of mushrooms, quietly, to himself. However, he finally comes round to it, and gives the name. And so the game continues.

The guessing game continues as the afternoon draws on. Finally, to much accolade, Councillor Castle Bridge surrenders the well earned basket to Bodobrus before ending the event.

Staddle's (In)famous Mushroom Field
""Brilliant idea, Councillor Castle Bridge!"" replied the apple polishers around the man when he proposed the idea of delivering a speech on harvesting mushrooms.

""Like teaching grandmothers to suck eggs"" cried one of the attendees at this said lecture. An inauspicious start and it continued downhill.

It was a well attended event, humans (PIERCE and LUCILLE) and hobbits (BODOBRUS, BINGO, DEEDEE and CICELY) gathering but apples split the audience's attention. ELSABEA (temped by Aleswyn) started the ruckus with her offer of an apple to one of the Dunlending's (TAPHENE) child, Benga and DONNA (temped by Ryanne) misinterpreted the friendly gesture and words hostilely. The belligent exchange grew more scrappy and soon ELRABIN got involved as well. What these Dunlendings thought of Breefolks is unknown though speculative glances were cast at hobbits and humans."

Somewhere in Combe

The tired travellers from Dunland arrives in Combe, in time to catch the locals, which included NATHANIA, KATHERINE (temped by Megan), LUCILLE and several other weak bowel lads and lasses (temped by PIERCE and RYANNE), trying to scare themselves by sharing tales of the unexplainable and of encounters of the monstrous kind. Nimdok Arvey (temped by RYANNE) edged his way into the perimeter of the audience, sharing a pipe fire with Ellard (temped by VAREN) while some of the other graybeards doused their fears in alcohol. One of them, an OLD_DRUNKARD (temped by Xiedon) fell into a stupor as AYAN joined the circle of would-be bravehearts during DANIR's (temped by ALESWYN) tale of meeting trolls. 

The story-telling stick is passed around and the Stag trader from Dunland stepped up, offered his own tale of a cursed land from his own land. Perhaps the story was too far from the experience of the less travelled hosts as the crowd grew restive and started to leave."

"event","{Nekenyu(#6559)}         Afternoon is giving way to the evening in the Stag's tavern. Such a fine day, with a fine breeze, leaves anything indoors wanting for people. Though, supper time and drinking time are coming. The tavern, aside from the bartender and a couple serving wenches, is fairly empty.

A table near the stairs, is occupied by two people: a man and a woman facing each other at the end. In a tunic of royal blue with gray trim sits the man, Nekenyu; his short black hair doing little to obscure his swarthy skin, though matching his black eyes. The woman, back to the door, wears a gray shirt and tan trousers, though her braid of mixed browns hangs from her head down the center of her back.

Sitting at another table are two men in their midtwenties and in blue shirts. Another two sit at the bar, conversing with the tender.

{Coraan(#27572)}  
The door to the tavern opens silently, allowing the entry of yet another pair into the room; a man dressed all in black accompanies one more strangely dressed, unsavory, unnaturally looking. The two seem to move in tandem, looking quickly about the place, as if surreptiously searching. Together, they begin to move towards the stairs slowly.

{Ryanne}
The fine afternoon indeed but though the indoors might lack lustre for many, yet duty holds its own as Emdok Arvey with one of Lady Bear's guards behind him enters the tavern; a few mere paces after the new arrivals. An expansive yawn, his arms outstretched as the door swings open, he kicks it shut with a backward flick of his foot, his eyes already darting about and lighting on the pair that sits close to the stairs. ""Chieftain. A word with ye?"" The Bear beside the Stag hunter grunts, his eyes as is habitual wander, sizing the room.
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of the story here.""> 

{Nekenyu(#6559)} The silent arrival of the two, catches more than a few glances from the room, not the least of which is the bartender. He steps aside from the man across him at the bar and hollers over to them, ""You two look new 'round here. Can I get you anything to drink?"" The man he was formerly talking to, turns around at the bar to watch.

The arrival of Emdok is acknowledged with a nod, though partly eclipsed by the prior arrivals. ""But of course, Emdok."" he calls, standing gently. The woman across from Nekenyu stands as well, and turns to see Emdok. ""I hear you're softening up your cousin with gifts."" she greets him with gentle amusement.

{Voss(#1434)} The two new arrivals halt and scan the room aggressively. The larger of the two, the bizarre, squinty-eyed, armoured fellow places his hand on the large axe in his belt and begins to tap his heavy foot on the ground impatiently. His evil eyes glare at the barkeep. ""Yes,"" he begins in his foul, throaty voice. ""You can serve us the one named 'Nekenyu.' No troubles, no blood."" He grins vilely, his filed teeth shimmering.

{Ryanne}
Making his way towards Nekenyu and his companion, Emdok motions the Bear to follow, narrowing the distance. ""I've brought word of me sister. She's tardy but approaching the Holy City and send word asking fer a meeting with ye in the Hall of Chieftains. Ye've the time?""

Nearing the table, the Stag hunter's eyes glint and he mock bows at the woman's words, ""Softening my cousin? Achs but there's no softening that lass. Tis her taking advantage of me good nature."" The Stag hunter shakes his head, ""Achs but Stag women knows how to wind their men around their fing--"" His voice peeters as he overhears one of the ugliest men he's ever seen speaks to the barkeep.

The Bear had hesitated, lagging a ways as he watches the two men at the counter, a frown vee-ing his young brow as if the sight of strangers dressed in that fashion irks him. He too turns at the sneering voice and the question, his eyes darting downwards at the man's aggressive stance and hand on axe and the Bear guard seeks his own axe at his belt.

{Nekenyu(#6559)} One of the two men sitting alone sighs deeply, looking down at his cup. ""Well, Vindon, that's my limit,"" he says with a little frustration. ""The wife will have my hide if I spend any more on drink."" The man of medium build stands, deliberately but gently knocking his empty cup on its side. He turns and sadly retreats to the door. His companion merely laughs gently. ""That's how I avoid you drinkin' me under the table!"" is called out, ""Night Brego.""

The bartender gets confused. ""Sorry, man?"" he calls back, ""That's the oddest drink I've ever heard of."" A head shake further betrays his state of mind. ""And I thought I knew all the drinks in Dunland...""

Standing at their table, Nekenyu and Tirina simply smile at the approaching Emdok. ""Whenever is conveinet for her. The return to Forthunn will be delayed."" Nekenyu says warmly. ""It would likely be well to include the Wulf representative, atleast for some. Just let me know when."" His companion, Tirina laughs gently. ""All your gifts? That should soften any -- and I wouldn't know anything about that..."" she responds, ""Though it is possible I might change my mind on that subject."" The request by the visitors draws only a brief glance from the two, but no acknowledgement.

{Voss(#1434)} The large, squinty-eyed man walks over to the bar table leisurely. He stares at the barkeeper for a moment with his menacing eyes before slamming his free hand onto the table fiercely. A massive pounding noise is emitted as the man's exhibits his almost inhuman strength. ""Now then!"" he cries out, more of a growl than a voice. ""My friend and I are looking for Nekenyu. This should not be harder than it has to be, should it, my friend?"" The grin reappears as he glances at the other stranger.

{Coraan(#27572)}  
As the echoes of this outburst fade, Coraan's face remains expressionless. He gives a slow nod, with a menacing narrowing of the eyes, and the careful eye would see the movement of his hand towards his blade.

{Ryanne}
The Stag hunter stares hard at the impertinent man, wincing as the fist crashes down on wood, and slowly his brow raises at the table creaks and then cracks. ""Achs.."" Emdok mouths silently, looking around at Nekenyu and then without a second's hesitation, thumbs the Bear over. The Bear guard is reluctant but saunters to the Stag, his hand visibly on his own axe. Whispered conference between Emdok and the Bear ensues and it is with visible misgiving that he curtly nods and heads towards the tavern door.

The second stranger's subtle movement goes unnoticed, overpowered by his companion's showiness.

Unnoticed at least by Emdok and the Bear guard.

{Nekenyu(#6559)} The lone Stag at a table jumps from his seat at the hammering hand. ""Excuse me!"" he calls out, beginning to cross the room. ""I'd 'preciate it if you wouldn't be makin' so much noise."" Stopping, he puts his hands on his hips, though not far from his own battle axe.

The bartender steps back at the approach and nearly jumps out of his skin at the slamming. ""W-w-ell,"" the man stammers, ""W-w-hy?"" The mans eyes begin darting back and forth between the two strangers. Still seated, the customer's eyebrows raise at the slam. ""Mighty impressive,"" he says reaching back to the bar and lifting his cup. ""I bet they heard that down at the market!"" he says amusingly. ""And the way he's yammerin' on, I'd buy yah a drink for the entertainment.""

Nekenyu's head tilts sideways to give him a good view around Tirina's head of the two. ""This is not the way to make new friends,"" he calls solidly across to the two travellers, ""And bein' as you're far from home, you probably don't want to be making enemies, instead."" Tirina's eyes dart to the lone Stag who just crossed the room then back to the two travellers, as her arms drop solidly to her sides, each next to the gray sheathing of a knife.

{Voss(#1434)} The armoured man cackles terribly. His spoiled green eyes peer into those of the man who has jumped from his seat. In a single, swift movement he tears his great axe out of it's place on his belt and swings it brutally at the Stag clansman's neck.

{Coraan(#27572)}  
The two seem to unsheath their weapons as one, as Coraan's blade leaps into his hand and is brought to bear before him. His overcoat flutters as he whirls about, facing the larger part of those gathered, staring them down as if daring them to interfere.

""Where is Nekenyu?"" he asks, after a moment, voice level as if unconcerned with his companion's actions.

{Ryanne}
The Bear hesitates at the door, his instinct to leap into battle strong but Emdok's glare thrusts him out of the door and he disappears. The Stag hunter moves a step forward, Emdok's voice stern, ""Hold yer hand, stranger. Ye should know better than to try and draw blood within the Holy City! Even the veriest child knows of this, ye ain't Dunlendings."" His tone is strong and firm. He does not look behind his shoulder at the other two Stags.

{Nekenyu(#6559)} The Stag who had been a faithful member of the Stag Watch is the source of much blood as his head is severed from his body. The body only remaining on its feet briefly before it to finds the floor.

Behind him, the man sitting at the bar says, ""Well, damn..."" as his friend's head has been permanently lost. His own axe in hand and slicing downward at the lower right left of the rat who just took his friend's head.

Nekenyu's only response is, ""Too late for that, Emdok. Brego's not gonna be happy when he walks in with Guardians from the front gate to find his friend is already with Kiern."" Tirina's hands rise to her waist, to rest upon her two knives.

The bartender, however, makes his way to the kitchen.

{Voss(#1434)} The fine axe in the hands of the murdering squinty-eyed stranger proceed to be grasped tightly in his hands as he moves away from the corpse and comes to stand beside his ally. Evil eyes scan the room and settle upon the woman with the knives. ""There isn't need for more bloodshed from the wrath of our mighty clan. Nekenyu shall step forward, and all lives shall be spared, and our faces will never be seen again.""

{Voss(#1434)} The axe of the Dunlending pierces into the leg of the squinty-eyed stranger. He cries aloud in pain, though his cry is more one of that of a fallen animal than a distressed man. After a quick step back in painful recoil, the large man swiftly spins the handle of his great axe with ease and reverses his swing now towards the neck of this newest assailant.

{Coraan(#27572)}  
Coraan turns quickly, his midnight gaze catching the final stages of the attack as the primal cry fades from the air. His spin continues, extending to his arm; a carefully timed flick of his wrist sends his blade slicing through space towards the assailant's neck.

Nekenyu continues to watch the blood bath, fairly silently. ""Well, that would be the corpse you are looking for."" he says flatly. The woman across the table from him frowns. ""You foul...."" she calls out, inserting a few expletives. She still doesn't draw her weapons, but merely watches the second man die furiously.

{Ryanne}
""In Kiern's name, stop this madness! Ye would defile this holy ground with blood?!"" cries out Emdok as he steps forward, his hand dropping to his blade and grasping until his knuckles pale, ""Nays!"" His voice rings loud with despair as he realises his words falls on deaf ears and he watches the blood bath double.

The door burst open and six men in raven black comes through, their axes and swords drawn, the cloaks of their office whipping behind them, the face of the Bear and Brego behind them. Grimfaced, the Guardians takes in the scene.

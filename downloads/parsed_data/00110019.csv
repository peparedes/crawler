Hope for the Warriors&trade; actively seeks to ensure that the sacrifices of wounded and fallen warriors and their families are never forgotten nor their needs unmet, particularly with regard to the short and long-term care of the severely injured.<br /><br />On their own, our service members and their families are awe inspiring in the face of their disabilities and hardships - courageous and resolute. However, it is with the support of a grateful nation that they remain unfaltering in their determination and find hope and purpose beyond recovery. As a united support network, all individuals, whether of great or small means, can find an opportunity to honor those who have willingly sacrificed to defend and protect our freedom. We invite you to take part in the inspirational lives of these young men and women and make it known that they never stand alone.</font><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>"

ME.&nbsp; Everyones shortcomings all week fell back onto me.&nbsp; I&nbsp;really feel like it made me look like a terrible employee.&nbsp; I didn't take one break all week, which gets me into trouble with the union if they find out. &nbsp;I also ended up workin a lot of overtime.&nbsp; I really hope the my boss comes back and realizes how much Tara and I busted our asses trying to make everything run smoothly.&nbsp; 

So I worked monday-friday, which is bizzare, because that means that I have off Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; I'm not complaing at all about that.&nbsp; The only thing that really sucks is that I come home and PUKE&nbsp;my brains out.&nbsp;

He is sly as a fox, has the nerve of a dope addict, the stories of an old sailor, the sincerity of a politician, and the subtly of Mt. Saint Helen. He is extremely irresistible, totally irrational and completely indestructible. <br /><br />A Paratrooper is a Paratrooper all his life. He is a magical creature. You can kick him out of your house but not out of your heart. You can take him off your mailing list but not off your mind. Paratroopers are found everywhere... in love...in battle... in lust... in trouble...in debt...in bars and ... behind them. No one can write so seldom and yet think so much of you. No one else can get so much enjoyment out of a letter or clean clothes or a six pack. <br /><br />A Paratrooper is a genius with a deck of cards. A millionaire without a cent and brave without a grain of sense. He is the PROTECTOR OF AMERICA, with the latest copy of playboy in his back pocket.

It's a bar that is only open on Sunday and some holidays in the summer out in the hamptons.  It's gigantic! there is an inside, outside, and a giant tent area.  It's open from 4-8 only. It is complete INSANITY.  The bouncers are extremely strict so you can't get in until you are really 21.  It's a right of passage for long island adults.. into an alcohol induced coma on the LIRR on the way home. JOKE LIFE.  <br /><br /><br />It was really like a huge frat party.

She comes to my house visibly upset and we head into Smithtown to acquire a home pregnancy test. I tell her turn around and instead of going to wallgreens we should go to cvs to avoid traffic.  Since shes a little upset it's decided that i'm going to go in and purchase it for her. No problem! I'm 21, no big deal right?  Right!  Guess what.. MY BOYFRIENDS MOM WAS IN THERE.

flash forward to 10:30 PM.  i have a test i have to take in the morning, so i decide not to go out.  plus hes only home for a few days, so he should have a night out with his friends.  i try not to be awkward and quiet when i hang out with him and his friends, but i know how guys are when they're with their buddies.  it's different when they got their girl around. 

now it's 4:40 am.  i wake up out of a dead sleep and my heart is POUNDING. he never called and his cell is dead.  i have this horrible gut wrenching feeling and i cant fall back asleep. honestly, i was a little upset he didn't use one of his friends phones to say good luck or even just a WHATS GOOD. okay, maybe i was more than a little upset.  i have an overactive imagination when it comes to creating situations in my head. 


skipping to 6:04 am. MGMT ripps me out of my dream to alert me to a 407 number lighting up my cell. its freddy, and he wants to know what time my test is. 9 am. can he come over? right now? yes. okay. 


he came to wish me good luck and to kiss me on the front lawn in front of a car full of his drunk friends and smelling like a bar. happiest girl in the world right here."

I tried on these shorts, my favorite shorts, from the summer.   They don't fit.  I can't get them over my ass.  I HAVE AN ASS?! WHAT?! I'm happy about that but I can stand to lose a few. I have two options at this point. The first is to get off my newly PHAT ass and work out.  The secondddddd is to purchase a new wardrobe. I guess the second isn't actually possible..

"event","i'm on twitter now, as if i need to be a member of yet another online SOMETHING.  i don't even know what it is.  it seems as if twitter is based upon the idea of facebook status updates. this makes me think that the concept of what facebook status has become recently is actually derived from twitter itself, since twitter has actually been around for quite some time? 

i say what facebook status has become recently because i noticed that it no longer includes ""is"" after your name.  the whole status update began with first and last name followed by is and then the update ""caitlin steele is washing socks."" now it would simply be ""caitlin washing socks."" let's be real though, i rarely wash my socks so that would NEVER be my status update. i don't wear dirty socks or anything, i just let an entire laundry basket(or corner of my room) fill up before i make that long journey downstairs to the cold laundry room.  realistically it would be something like ""caitlin I slang in my white tee I bang in my white tee All in the club spittin game in my white tee."" 

my mom needs a twitter, she updates her fb status entirely too much. i actually found another website similar to fml and those other ones that i posted recently. this one is based upon the horror of having parents, or just family members in general, on facebook monitoring your every extremely inappropriate behavior on the internet. 
http://myparentsjoinedfacebook.com/
it's not really updated very, but i read through some if it.  i can definitely relate.  

i'm not sure where my rambling about the internet is going right now. i should stop myself now before i begin a tangent about my fascination with LOLCATS  and obsessive stalking of dlisted.com, so i will."

"event","Go placidly amid the noise and the haste,
and remember what peace there may be in silence.

As far as possible, without surrender,
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
and listen to others,
even to the dull and the ignorant;
they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons;
they are vexatious to the spirit.

If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain or bitter,
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.
Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs,
for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
many persons strive for high ideals,
and everywhere life is full of heroism.
Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love,
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment,
it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline,
be gentle with yourself.
You are a child of the universe
no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

Therefore be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive Him to be.
And whatever your labors and aspirations,
in the noisy confusion of life,
keep peace in your soul.

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful. Strive to be happy."

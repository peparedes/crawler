"event","So last night I watched Versus, it's a violent japanese martial arts/samurai/zombie/gangster flick. It's Awsome. Then I slept badly due to  bad dreams. Understandable you might say but do you know what the dreams were about? In the first I was down in Portsmouth at a party at Kate's house with Matt and everyone. Also there though was the last girl to really screw up my life. Everyone seemed to be really good mates with her. So we left the house and got on a bus, presumably to go back to London although everyone came with us, and everyone was sitting with, walking with, chatting with this girl. It was like they were all good friends with her. 

In the second dream I was in my old secondary school, in the Humanities department bizarrely (it's always the Humanities or Maths department I'm in when I dream of school, never Science). I was trying to do the same experiments that I'm doing in work at the moment and they were going wrong and again this girl was there. Then I left the classroom and I was in a kind of large house with lots of other people. We were looking for something and kept going down stairs and through narrow corridors. Once again everyone seemed to be really good mates with this girl, it was like they all knew something that I didn't I had the distinctly unpleasant feeling that you get when you suspect that something is going on behind your back. 

The last dream was set at the place I did my PhD. My friends from that time were there and we were drinking coffee in this big canteen. When I walked in they were all sitting there with this girl which made me feel like I couldn't drink with them and gave that things-happening-behind-your-back feeling. Then we all left the canteen together to go back to the lab. Then I had to get up.

Strangely between all of these dreams I was waking up to look at the clock and turn my alarm off. Ten I fall asleep and have the same kind of dream again. Shitty way to start a Sunday, especially seeing that I have to work."

"event","Right, after my last rant about Women I No Longer Like, and after chilling for a month I feel much better. Fuck her.

Lately I haven't really been achieving much, my drive to cure cancer is grinding to a halt amid realisations that no one actually knows what the fuck is going on but occasionally they get lucky and find something that works, turn it into a medicine and pretend that that was what they meant to do all along.

Recently I haven't been able to go out much (well no more than once a week to skanky rock clubs) because my laptop finally died a death and I had to buy a new computer for work (take note Fia5co) thus sacrificing some of my drinking money. But not going out is ok because I have a new love in my life, and it's called Planetside. Now I don't want people to think that things are finished between me and CoH because we still see each other at weekends when I get custody of Yang for a few hours but things just aren't that same between us. I remember when we first met everything was fresh and new and exciting and we spent all our time together. Sometimes we'd go at it for 12 hours straight on a Saturday. The problem was that after a while it all got a little stale. We tried other things, like my dark defender and the ill/rad controller but it just wasn't the same. Yang was 31 and all grown up and I just didn't get together with him as often. Then Planetside came along and that shit rocks. The sheer joy of executing people with my trusty assault rifle or hammering guided rockets into their tanks as they frantically try to escape is wondrous. The other day I was creeping along a battle field hiding behind the burnt out shells of ruined tanks with artillery and AA flak bursting all around me and tracers lighting up the battle field. I felt like a real soldier except without all the getting my legs blown off by a landmine or having my dick replaced by a tap or getting sued by the families of civilians that I may or may not recall accidentally shooting in the head whilst they were tied up and arrested in front of me. I did however get a few hate tells from some muppet I blew up with my tank. Apparently he was on my side. Like I actually care. Oh and that was another great thing: sitting at one end of a bridge in a heavy tanke using my mortar cannons to shread the enemy infantry that were foolishly trying to storm it. 18 kills thank you very much. Fia5co, you need to get a new computer. Seriously dude. Oh and Teamspeak absolutely rules."

"event","Why is it I constantly care about someone who deliberately fucks me around? I simply don't get why I can't learn my lesson and just let this shit go. I'm sure that when I was younger I was miuch more full of anger and fire and I'd have never put up with this shit. Maybe my memory just puts a rosy shine on my childhood.  Although things have been getting a hell of a lot better, the last 2 and a half years, since August 2002 have pretty much sucked ass. Over the years I've figured myself out pretty well and got to the root of all those freudian, childhood issues that fuck people's heads up and put them in therapy for years. I know what makes me tick, the downside is I know what my greatest fears, my greatest neuroses are as well. 

So a few years back I meet this girl. This girl was probably the closest friend that I've ever had. Now, considering that Matt's on my friends list and I've known him, grown up with him since we were four you can see that this girl was pretty important to me (no offence dude, but you and I have never slept together). Looking back I still can't see any way we could have been together, there's simply no other way I could have made the decisions which I was forced to make. The timing was the worst imaginable. So eventually this girl destroys my life at a time when things were really hard anyway. I'm not the only one who thinks this was deliberate, infact our *mutual* friends are now basically simply *my* friends because of how she treated me. With no prompting from me. So this girl puts me through the worst time imaginable, she actually forces me to face the things that I fear the most and were at the root of my fucked up psyche during Uni. And during all this time there was no way I could get away from her. I saw her every day and she knew exactly how I felt about her. But I lived through it, I guess I should thank her really. So as soon as I could I cut off all contact, I didn't speak to her, didn't see her and no one talked about her to me. For a year. Which gave me time to get over the worst of how I feel. And eventually we start talking again, meet up (amongst friends) and things seem ok.

So today I find that she's refusing to reply to my e-mails and has suddenly blocked me on MSN and IT'S FUCKING MY HEAD UP.

What the hell is wrong with me. Jesus wept. Just fucking kill me.


I guess when something's handed to you on a plate it's much less attractive than after it's been snatched away"

Hello there internet :)

It seems that since my last update was posted I have been unable to update any more.


LiveJournal has removed all update abilities on my account. update.

So, that has left me with this problem:
How do I vent my choloric diatribes to the internet with no functioning LJ account?

By posting an update on all my friends LJ's.

HI! HELLO!

Yet agian LJ is sucky.
LJ is my favourite tool, did I do something wrong? Or is it something to do with the way
I delete all incoming LJ e-mails.

I'm a self-cutting, angsty, no-one likes-me, hate my job/life/computer/biro, full of emotion
person and I need to tell all the INTERNET about it!

Help me get my LJ back :( My life is empty without it
Wahh wahh wahh!

"event","Right Fia5co, Mr Otella I have a decision to make. Very soon in CoH my arse-kicking shaolin ninja monk will be level 14 and able to take his second travel power. Now he can either have super speed or super jump. Now obviously super speed would be the most practical as it would allow me to run away when my arse is getting kicked however super jump seems much more fun. I'm tired of using a crappy combat jump. I want to stand on the top of tall buildings and on the heads of towering statues and adopt heroic poses. Any thoughts/suggestions?"

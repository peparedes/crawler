1. If you like Her ... ASK HER OUT already.

2. when you hug her, put YOUR ARMS around her WAIST and hold her close.

3. when u WALK next to her, get as CLOSE as you can to her.

4. if shes the only one in your life, TELL HER.

5. ALWAYS let her know how much you like her, love her, or think about her.

6. give her presents and cards for no reason, SHE WILL RETURN THE FAVOR... ALWAYS.

7. if she hangs up on you, call her right back.

8. always offer to pay, if she says NO twice, then let her pay but make a deal that you get to pay next time (date offer too!).

9. kiss her lightly every chance you get.

10. look in her eyes and kiss her on the lips, forehead, or nose.

11. if she says shes cold, dont be an idiot and say ""me 2"" and stand there, or give her your jacket so she feels guilty that your freezing,....just simply hold her in your arms.

12. dont force her to do anything shes not comfortable with.

13. invite her to dinner or somewhere where you can talk, instead of the movies.

14. try not to ask her if shes mad at you EVERYTIME you speak to her.

15. Always tell her you LOVE her only if you really mean it.

16. DONT pressure her to do anything she isnt READY to do. When she is ready, she will let you know. She just wants everything to be more SPECIAL and PERFECT. So appreciate what she does do with you.

17. DONT go and tell your friends anything that happens between you two, cause it will hurt her and make her mad...and it will NEVER happen again."

heres some sad lyrics

Martina Mcbride - Concrete Angel Lyrics 

She walks to school with the lunch she packed,
Nobody knows what she's holdin back,
Wearin the same dress she wore yesterday,
She hides the bruises with a linen and lace ohhh,
The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask,
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask,
Bearin' the burden of a secret storm,
Sometimes she wishes she was never born, 

Through the wind and the rain she stands hard as a stone,
In a world that she can't rise above, 
But her dreams give her wings and she flies to a place where
she's loved, 
Concrete angel,

Somebody cries in the middle of the night,
The neighbors hear but they turn out the lights,
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate,
When mornin' comes it'll be too late, 

Through the wind and the rain she stands hard as a stone,
In a world that she can't rise above,
But her dreams give her wings and she flies to a place where
she's loved
Concrete angel

A statue stands in a shaded place,
An angel girl with an upturned face,
A name is written on a polished rock,
A broken heart that the world forgot,

Through the wind and the rain she stands hard as a stone,
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings and she flies to a place where
she's loved,
Concrete angel"

"event","Think about this... You may not realize it, but it's 100% true.

1. At least 2 people in this world LOVE you so much they would DiE for you.

2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.

3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you.

4. A SMiLE from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you.

5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.

6. You mean the world to someone.

7. If not for you, someone may not be living.

8. You are special&unique.

9. Someone that you don't even know exists, loves you.

10. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it.

11. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look: you most likely turned your back on the world.

12. When you think you have no chance of getting what you want, you probably won't get it, but if you BELiEVE in yourself, probably, sooner or later, you will get it.

13. Always remember the compliments you received. FORGET about the rude remarks.

14. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will feel much better when they know.

15. If you have a GREAT FRiEND, take the time to let them know that they are great."

yea really bored and my headhurts so here are lyrics:



Papa Roach- Blood


I will forgive but I won't forget
And I hope you know you've lost my respect


You better watch out
If you don't know whats going on around you
You better think twice
Before you fly off the handle and lose it
You better join us
Before you get lost in the shuffle
You gotta rise against
The demons that are gonna try and hold you down


Does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love?
Does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love?
The ones you love, the ones you love, the ones you love


Cause I'm not a pawn for you to play in your fucking game
I've got dignity and I dream that I want to achieve
Under pressure, you crumbled and you let me down
I'm not deaf and all I hear are your empty promises


Does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love?
Does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love?
Does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love?
Does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love?
The ones you love, the ones you love, the ones you love


Does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love?
Yes it runs in your blood to betray the ones you love?
Yes it runs in your blood to betray the ones you love?
Yes it runs in your blood to betray the ones you love?
Yes it runs in your blood to betray the ones you love?


I will forgive but I won't forget
And I hope you know you've lost my respect


Yes it runs in your blood to betray the ones you love?
Yes it runs in your blood to betray the ones you love?

then one more:

PAPA ROACH  

Getting Away With Murder 

Somewhere beyond hapiness and sadness
I need to calculate what creates my own madness
And I'm addicted to your punishment
And your the master, and I am waiting for disaster

I feel irrational, so confrontational
To tell the truth I am getting away with murder
It is impossible to never tell the truth
But the reality is I'm getting away with murder

Getting away, getting away, getting away

I drink my drink and I don't even want to
I think my thoughts when I don't even need to
I never look back cause I don't even want to
And I dont need to, because I'm getting away with murder

I feel irrational, so confrontational
To tell the truth I am getting away with murder
It is impossible to never tell the truth
But the reality is I'm getting away with murder

Getting away, getting away, getting away
Getting away, getting away, getting away
Getting away, getting away, getting away
Murder

Somewhere beyond hapiness and sadness
I need to calculate what creates my own madness
And I'm addicted to your punishments
And I'm your master, and I am craving this disaster

I feel irrational, so confrontational
To tell the truth I am getting away with murder
It is impossible to never tell the truth
But the reality is I'm getting away with murder

Getting away, getting away, getting away

I feel irrational, so confrontational
To tell the truth I am getting away with murder
It is impossible to never tell the truth
But the reality is I'm getting away with murder

"event","why is it when i ask someone the truth they act like they dont know the truth.. why is it when u think ur happy u find something else that would make u happy? why do i get jealous so damn easily??????? y do i still like  someone who still likes me but we are both seeing someone else? why cant i just sleep for like a whole day? why do people piss me off so much!
why cant u just know the person who u r going to spend the rest of ur life w/ instead of trying to figure out who really likes u or who u like?
  some days i dont know who these people are that call themselves my friends, they just lie, and talk about u behind ur back.

 Artist: Liz Phair Lyrics 
 Song: Why Cant I? Lyrics

 
- Get a load of me, get a load of you
Walkin' down the street, and I hardly know you
It's just like we were meant to be

Holding hands with you, and we're out at night
Got a girlfriend, you say it isn't right
And I've got someone waiting too

> is, this is just the beginning
We're already wet, and we're gonna go swimming

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you

Isn't this the best part of breakin' up
Finding someone else you can't get enough of
Someone who wants to be with you too

It's an itch we know we are gonna scratch
Gonna take a while for this egg to hatch
But wouldn't it be beautiful

Here we are, we're at the beginning
We haven't fucked yet, but > heads spinning

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you

I'd love for you to make me wonder
Where it's goin'
I'd love for you to pull me under
Somethin's growin'
> for this that we can control
Baby I am dyin'

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you

 i am also really mad at zach, hes acting all stuck up and being really mean to me ever since he came to chs hanging out w/ all the popular people, it's not fair, guess i am just jealous... not like that, i miss being friends... and i guess i just have a lot of anger toward him... i might let some out toward him, i mean  get really mad inside when like emily or savannah or whoever calls him sammy or w/e , because him mariah and me started that in the summer... i guess he just doesnt care that hes leaving his friends....

heres a great song and its lyrics (i have hazel eyes too)

""Behind These Hazel Eyes""

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore...

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
....................................................

it's a great song, more songs by kelly clarkson tomorrow or somthing"

*
I looked away 
Then I looked back at you 
You try to say 
The things that you can't undo 
If I had my way 
I'd never get over you 
Today is the day 
I pray that we make it through 
Make it through the fall 
Make it through it all 

And I don't want to fall to pieces 
I just want to sit and stare at you 
I don't want to talk about it 
And I don't want a conversation 
I just want to cry in front of you 
I don't want to talk about it 
'Cause I'm in love with you 

You're the only one 
I'd be with 'til the end 
When I come undone 
You bring me back again 
Back under the stars 
Back into your arms 

And I don't want to fall to pieces 
I just want to sit and stare at you 
I don't want to talk about it 
And I don't want a conversation 
I just want to cry in front of you 
I don't want to talk about it 
'Cause I'm in love with you 

Wanna know who you are 
Wanna know where to start 
I wanna know what this means 
Wanna know how you feel 
Wanna know what is real 
I wanna know everything 
Everything 

I don't want to fall to pieces 
I just want to sit and stare at you 
I don't want to talk about it 
And I don't want a conversation 
I just want to cry in front of you 
I don't want to talk about it 

And I don't want to fall to pieces 
I just want to sit and stare at you 
I don't want to talk about it 
And I don't want a conversation 
I just want to cry in front of you 
And I don't want to talk about it 
'Cause I'm in love with you 

I'm in love with you 
'Cause I'm in love with you 
I'm in love with you 
I'm in love with you"

"event","i am going to lay in my bed tonight i think about what to do about mike and me, i mean bobby keeps telling me that hes using me and i should dump him, but last time i did and we just got back together. plus i dunno what to think, i need some time to think.... i dont know if he is using me or not,some people are like yea hes using u for ur body, and other people are like i dont think he's using u. so tonight when i lay down to go sleep, i will lay on my back and think about everything that we have dont together and everything we havnt, what i want and what is happening between us. i will hope to figure out why i feel empty and alone inside and why i wake up with him in my mind and go to sleep wondering what hes doing, and everyother minute of the day.. thanks berta for the advice: heres what she said to me:

*stolensecret1801: u should do whut u think is best
*stolensecret1801: and follow ur heart and not whut everyone is telling u to do
*stolensecret1801: u deserve to be happy and if mikes not makin u happy find *someone else
*stolensecret1801: like from my profile
*stolensecret1801: sometimes you have to r e a l i z e he doesn't care & you
could be *m i s s i n g  o u t* on someone who--->>(does)
*stolensecret1801: its better to take chances and now what the answer is than just sit and wait and never know whut could have been
*stolensecret1801: u can tell a person and who they are by lookin in theyre eyes
*stolensecret1801: hmm i get all my advice from sada tho
*stolensecret1801: shes a smart person



Sometimes I wish I were a kid again, skinned knees are easier fixed than broken hearts.

First off, I got a full time job at the museum!  I was offered the Visitor Services Associate position on July 1st, and have been keeping myself extremely busy ever since.  It would take me at least a day to write about everything I've been up to, but some high lights are seeing the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Church and teaching tour groups about Netherlandish art from the 16th century.  

Second off, I had an incredible summer.  My friends from Fordham and I have spent a lot of time together, between going on road trips to Connecticut and Long Island for grad/birthday parties, and chillin in the City.  I am positively certain that these people will be my friends for life =)

Third off, I am happily in a relationship =)  My boyfriend Pete and I have been officially dating for a month now, and he is absolutely incredible.  We met at the end of September at the expense of an online dating site =P  I never thought I'd turn to one of those, but I took the plunge after hearing about a free site.  I pretty much said, ""Hey, I got nothing to lose,"" and am happy I swallowed my pride and created a profile.  We are two peas in a pod, and have sooooo much in common.  Our personalities click, and we have the best of times together.  He met my best friend Steve a few weeks ago, and they get along great.  Pete also met my Fordham friends last night, and we had such an amazing time together.  I can't get over how well everyone got along, and it was especially nice hearing Tynan say, ""You two are gonna be great together.""

I am in a very happy place in my life, despite some of the normal misgivings I have to deal with.  Regardless, I have a great job, amazing friends, and an incredible boyfriend.  What more could a girl ask for?"

"event","It's been quite some time since I've updated this thing.  The semester is going rather well, but I still can't fathom the fact that I won't be coming back in the fall.  Fordham is my home (literally and figuratively) and I don't know how I can accept the fact that I won't see my friends as often as I do now.  One of my roommates and I went out for dinner last night, and we were talking about how we feel like our true selves around our friends at school.  Leaving that comfort is going to be very strange once we get those diplomas.  I never truly realized how much Fordham has given me.  Yeah, the administration can be quite fucked up at times, but I really do love this school.  I've met quite incredible people (with the exception of a few, but that's okay), and have learned so much about myself.  I've experienced so much, and through those good times, as well as bad times, I've been able to see how I react and relate to situations.  I'm proud to say that I've been a strong person throughout it all, and I'm so lucky to have amazing friends to be there with me through thick and thin.

Speaking of which, I've been going through a pretty rough week.  My family and I had to move out of our apartment in my grandma's house, and moved downstairs.  We sold the house, and the new homeowner is allowing us to stay and pay rent.  He's not going to live there, but owns it as an investment, and plans on renting out the upstairs apartment to someone else.  It's been so stressful because we were only given a week's notice to move everything out.  Granted, all we had to do was move things down one flight of stairs, one week is not enough time to prepare and make room for everything.  We've had to sacrifice so much, and it's so hard to fathom people other than my family living under the same roof.  

My friends have been great through this whole process.  Tynan and his roommate Clint came over and helped move my furniture on Thursday.  Though they weren't over long, they still did a lot of work, which I'm most grateful for.  My roommate Sara came over yesterday, and helped me rearrange my furniture because things were not fitting properly.  I had a vision and finally solved the puzzle (thank God cause that's been bothering me for days now).  I had to get rid of my desk and shelf that holds my records and stereo, and I hate that I lost these two articles of furniture because I don't know where I can store these things now.  

It's going to be a hard transition for me once I go home for Spring Break.  Unlike everyone else, I have not slept in my new room yet, and it's going to be so weird once I do.  I just can't believe we got to this point.  We had everything made for us, but my grandma had to piss it all in the wind.  I'm angry that this had to happen, and I wish things could have turned out differently.  Not to mention, I can see this is truly affecting my mother.  She looks sicker and sicker every time I see her.  She recently found out that her left breast is now infected, as well as her under arm on the right side of her body.  She has to undergo another biopsy (which will be some time this week) so they can remove the cancerous cells.  This has got to be her 4th or 5th surgery by now, and I don't know how much more she can take.  Just when her hair was starting to grow back, she had to start getting chemo again.  She was so excited that her natural hair was coming back, but of course, fate had to steal any ounce of happiness away from her.  

I truly have a bad feeling about my mother's health, and I don't think she has much time left.  I sound horrible for saying that, and I'm not a doctor, but I can just tell that she's sick of being sick.  I can't say that I blame her for giving up because who wants to wake up every morning, only leaving the house to see doctors.  It's such a damn shame that this has to happen to her.  She is one of the sweetest people I know, and she doesn't deserve any of this.  Of course, no one deserves to be sick, but why do bad things always happen to good people?  Of course, I'm angry and saddened over all of this, but I can't blame any of this on anyone or anything, especially God.  My grandmother (though I've always questioned her religious beliefs) had told me that she's very angry with Him.  I know that she, too, is going through a lot, but blaming it on God isn't the answer.  Instead, having faith in God is the only true remedy.  Keeping a positive attitude, too, is also key.  I just hope that when my mother does go to Heaven, we will all be at peace and won't feel that anger and frustration any more.  Of course, I don't want to lose my mother, but the reality of this situation is that this disease is going to kill her.  Being angry is not going to bring her back.  At least I know that I will feel relief knowing that she won't have to suffer anymore.  

I know I don't always show it, but all of this stuff is quite upsetting.  It's been getting to me a lot, especially this week, but I'm trying not to dwell on it so much.  Everyone knows me for always having a positive outlook on life, as well as being loud and cheery all the time.  Heck, most people wouldn't even know I'm going through as much as I am because of the way I carry myself.  I figure, displaying anger and frustration isn't going to make the situation any better.  At least being bubbly helps me get through the day and not worry about everything so much.  

Again, I can't say it enough how grateful I am for having my friends there for me.  I'm glad that Tynan came over the other day because he finally saw what I have to go through first-hand.  Yeah, simply telling him about what's going on keeps him informed, but actually witnessing it really allows it to settle in.  He told me that he truly feels sorry for me.  It's weird, I am glad that he cares enough to say that, but at the same time, I don't want his pity.  As frustrating as everything is, I have to accept it for what it's worth and just take it one day at a time.  I know I'm a strong person, and I can get through this.  Granted, I do get upset over it from time to time, but at least I know I have my friends' shoulders to cry on."

"event","Being I have free time at work, I guess it doesn't hurt to update this thing again.  I think I officially broke a record or something.  It's quite rare seeing me write here as frequently as I have lol.  

I went out with Katrina and Jackie after work last evening.  I wasn't sure how the evening was going to pan out, nor know how the vibe was going to be.  I touched on this with the girls as we were talking over a drink.  I feel that there is a slight disconnect among our friends at home.  Don't get me wrong, we all get along well when we see one another, but things don't feel the way as they used to.  We're not as close as we all used to be, and I often times feel when we try to be open about certain things, some people can get a little judgmental or not look at things in the context of the whole picture.  They nit-pick without fully understanding the depth of the situation, if you will.  For instance, my relationship with Tynan was, and has been under such scrutiny among certain friends from home.  They don't understand that he and I are best friends.  Yes, two of my friends from home got a very bad first impression of him, but that doesn't give them the right to pass judgment on my friendship with him.  I know they are looking out for me emotionally because I do have feelings for him, but that doesn't give them the right to claim that he uses me and what not.  Yes, I do a lot for him, but that doesn't mean that my efforts do not go unnoticed.  

I try to refrain from talking about him as much as possible when at home because I feel like I'm walking on eggshells.  I know if I say something, it may instigate a conversation I don't want to get involved in.  

Such discussions about him are not the only things that trouble me while at home.  Jenn confronted me the other day, claiming that I seem ""bored"" when I'm out with her and our other friends.  I don't think it's fair to make such a claim, but I'll admit that I sometimes feel like we don't have much in common anymore, and it's hard to make conversation.  I asked her if she gets offended when I invite my local Fordham friends out, and she said that she likes them, but they can be a part of the problem (in the sense that I pay more attention to them, rather than she and our other friends).  That made me feel really bad because I never meant for that to happen.  My rational was, ""Hey, we're on break, and it would be nice to introduce my friends from home to my friends from Fordham.  Heck, they're in the area, and I don't think they're busy doing anything.  Might as well invite them, too!""  I don't know why I'm necessarily being put on the chopping block for this cause I'm not the only one who has invited friends from their designated schools to meet the home team, if you will.  It's such a shame that they feel I don't give them adequate ""Bern time.""

I suppose this situation is something I need to contemplate, because I was also told that it seems like I make phone calls a lot when I'm in their company.  I'll be honest, though.  I don't feel like I do that a lot, but it's one more thing I was called out on.  I hate to say this, but I feel like I'm being attacked, but I know I shouldn't feel that way.  I know they're only voicing their concerns, but is it a crime for being a social butterfly?  I guess I do invite other people because my idea of a good time doesn't consist of hearing my friends make petty comments about what some girl is wearing, or how some guy needs to change his outfit.  When I go out, I want to go out to have a good time, make good conversation, and create laughter.  I don't want to listen to banter about how the girls in the corner are dressed like sluts, and that if that guy in that corner doesn't talk to me, he's an ass.  

Taking my friends from school out of this equation, I feel the problem is a little bit deeper than what's really on the surface.  Being we've all gone our own separate ways, we haven't had the opportunity to be as close as we used to be.  The time and distance that kept us apart has weakened some of our relationships, but I also think it's also allowed us to grow, in a sense.  I'm going to be quite frank here.  Up until college, I feel like I have been stuck in the shadow of one of my friends.  We were best friends since childhood, but once we went our separate ways, I finally felt like I was my own person.  I could do what I want, make my own decisions...I finally felt independent.  I was finally able to make my own friends, something I hadn't done in years.  I often times felt that I made friends with her friends because she was much more involved and outgoing, and it was easier for me to meet people that way.  Being out there on my own opened my eyes to new experiences and new people.  In making such friendships, I've realized that I've connected with a few other people who actually understand me much better than she does.  I'll confide in them more openly and freely before I bring certain news to her.  However, I don't know if she truly believes that we're still the best of buds that we were in high school.

One more thing I want to touch on.  I don't necessarily appreciate it when people I was never that close to think they can pass judgment on me, claiming that they really know what's going on.  If I never confided in you in high school, what makes you think we're that tight in college?  Yes, people's relationships can change in time.  Trust me, I've had it happen with a few girls from high school who I tend to talk to/see more often now than I did then.  But if we barely spoke then, and we only speak the two times that we see each other throughout the year, I think you should keep your thoughts and opinions to yourself.  

I never meant for this entry to turn into this massive venting session, but it's something that has been on my mind for some time now.  I really think that people are in denial about their relationships with others, and they can't admit it to themselves.  People change, they grow up.  The things that mattered to us in the past don't necessarily hold true anymore.  Oh, and by no means do I dislike anyone; please, don't get that impression.  I just feel that people need to recognize that certain friendships have changed, and living in the past isn't a wise thing to do.  Yes, we can reflect on the past, and talk about the past, but don't assume that all of the friendships from back in the day necessarily remain the same."

"event","I feel like updating again =P  I've been sitting here at work reading old LJ entries.  I tend to do that when I work alone.  I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia, but at the same time, I noticed how funny it is how certain things haven't changed.  Granted, the entries range from a year-and-a-half to a year ago, it feels like it's been longer than that.  Reading about sophomore year takes me back to a slightly different place, and I'm sure other college students can attest to that.  I find it rather funny how my feelings for a certain classmate ::cough cough:: Tynan ::cough cough:: remain the same, if not stronger, while feelings for a certain Marine ::cough cough:: Gonz ::cough cough:: don't even exist anymore.  The amount of stress I endured (and continue to endure) over these two is quite hysterical.  I can't help but laugh at some of the old entries I wrote.  The things I wrote about Tynan still hold true--two friends like each other a little more than friends, but can't be together because the guy doesn't want a girlfriend...Story of my life.  

The intensity I felt for Gonz, though, was incredible, and it sometimes surprises me how hard I fell for the guy.  It's unfortunate that our friendship didn't revert to the way it was prior to his  moving to California, but letting go of my feelings for him and that false sense of hope was the best thing I could do for myself.  

I feel like a much stronger person since letting go of Gonz, though, I sometimes feel weak due to my feelings for Tynan.  Regardless, I at least have the comfort of knowing that no matter what, we're still friends.  He's my best friend, and I do not lie when I say he knows everything about me.  Shit, he knows me so well, he understands my feelings and emotions even before I realize them!  (Not even joking)  If there's anyone I want to be with at this time in my life, it's him, but it's not likely to happen.  We've had this conversation so many times until we're blue in the face (and I run out of tears =P).  I can't imagine my life without him, and the thought of not seeing him after we graduate brings me to tears (I kid you not).  I spend most of my free time with him, and making that transition to not seeing him at all truly upsets me.  I know he knows how much he means to me;  I don't even have to say it.  There have been countless times I'd give him a hug and proceed to leave his room, and have him call out and say, ""I know you love me.""  As much as I don't want to admit it, that's the absolute truth."

"event","I've been home for close to a week now, and it's a shame to say that I haven't seen anyone yet.  Hell, I barely left the house since I've been back.  I couldn't take sitting indoors anymore, so I decided to take the bus to Central Ave. last evening.  I wound up buying this really nice blanket with the gift card my boss gave me.  I would've stayed out longer, but I had to make it back in time to catch the last bus.  Once I graduate, I'm making a promise to myself to take driving classes.  I can't deal with traveling by public transportation anymore, and I'm definitely not banking on anyone teaching me how to drive.  I've waited long enough...It's time I learn and get my own set of wheels.

I've been thinking about what I should do for New Year's Eve.  Jenn invited me to a club, but it's too expensive.  I'd rather sit at home and drink a cheap bottle of wine, than spend $150 for an open bar and cocktail weenies.  Some guy who graduated from Fordham two years ago invited me to a party at his place.  I don't really know him, so I don't think I'll go.  However, my roommate is friends with him, and she's considering going.  I'll have to see.  But as of now, I'm also invited to a party in Danbury, which seems like the most probable place I'll ring in the New Year.  If anyone has any other ideas, let me know =P

Okay, so I'm at work right now, and I'm flying solo today (and tomorrow, too).  I had a feeling we'd have a lot of people come in.  One of the guards thought it'd be a slow day, but we've been closed for two days now.  I can't tell if it's mostly natives or tourists, but either way, we're getting a pretty good head count--it's the Christmas season, family is in town, tourists are visiting, the weather is fairly nice...Shit, I hope people don't come around 5:15/5:30 cause I hope to be out of here by then.  I gotta make it back to Bronxville in time to catch the last bus.  See, this is what I'm fucking talking about--Public transportation blows because I can't even stay at work long enough without having to worry about bus schedules...Ugh!"

"event","I've officially been on Christmas break since 3:30 Tuesday afternoon, but haven't gone home yet.  It's nice relaxing around the apartment, chilling with my friends.  Tynan and I made a turkey dinner for everyone on Wednesday night.  With the help of Sara and Joe, we put together a meal that could feed an army lol.  On Thursday, I played the role of Betty Crocker, and made brownies and a cake for Tynan's birthday.  Though it was technically on Friday, I made dessert ahead of time so most of his roommates could come over before they went home for break.  We did, however, go out to celebrate on Friday.  Despite having another tear-jerking heart-to-heart converstation earlier that night, I put my game face on and wound up enjoying myself for the rest of the evening.  We went to one of the local bars, and danced the night away.  Unfortunately, a certain someone got kicked out because he accidentally punched the bouncer, so we made our way back to Walsh.  Needless-to-say, he almost got arrested on the treck back for public urination...can't take this kid anywhere =P  Regardless, I still had an awesome time. 

He left early yesterday morning, and I walked him to the elevator to say goodbye.  Soon after, one of my roommates left, but she'll be back tomorrow for an exam.  So my roommate, Sara, and I pretty much spent the whole day together.  She made me dinner, and then we went out to see what people were up to.  The bar scene was so unusual, though.  Barely any Fordham students were out, and it was infested with former Fordham Prep students, guidos, and underage kids from Yorktown.  Petty fights broke out: a few at Mugz's, and another at Ziggy's (which required the cops to come and break it up).  Hell, I almost got into a fight with some asshole from the Prep because he threw a beer cup across the bar, and hit me.  I went up to him and cursed him out cause he better watch what the fuck he's doing.  What nonsense...  These fucking kids should leave their bullshit at home, or simply not go out at all. 

Other than that, I'm at work at the moment.  I overslept, but still managed to get here by 10 (thank the Lord).  I was hoping that I'd get a call saying we'll be closed due to the weather, but of course, that was wishful thinking.  Once I get home, I'll probably have dinner, and start packing.  I'm gonna go home tomorrow, and may be back at school by January 5th (I have yet to decide).  Being I have work in the City, it's easier to commute from the Bronx, as opposed to making the horrific commute from Yonkers.  We'll see what happens."

"event","Although we've never been together as a couple, it feels like we broke up last night.  We decided that we cannot continue having the relationship that we have because it's making things too complicated.  I want more than a friendship, but he can't give that to me.  We pretty much laid everything on the table, and he said that he likes me a little more than a friend, but he can't be my boyfriend.  He just doesn't want that in his life right now.  It sucks because it's been this way for 2 years, and I can't get past him.  The more time we spend together, the more I want to be with him.  Everyone says it seems like we're dating, and that we should just make it official, but he can't make that commitment.  

He played this song for me as we were laying in bed together, claiming this is exactly how he feels.  Oh, how Johnny Cash has a way with words, I couldn't help but cry...

""It Ain't Me, Babe""

Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me babe
No, no, no, it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes to you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more

But it ain't me babe
No, no, no, it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

You say you're lookin' for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothin' more

No, no, no, it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

EDIT:  I started writing this entry on Thursday morning.  When I came home from work that day, he stopped by and was acting kinda strange.  He gave me a $10 Best Buy gift card (that he received for free with his purchase, might I add), then proceeded to admit that he wanted to buy me a DVD, but just didn't do it.  I asked him why he was being so nice, and he said that he felt bad about the night before.  He claimed that the vibe was off.  Since then, things feel as if nothing particularly changed from the time we had that conversation.  We've cooked each other dinner for the past two nights, hung out and watched tv...However, he did say something that really pissed me off last night.  He was talking to my roommate and his roommate about dating, and said that going to the movies is a bad idea.  So I chimed in by saying, ""Yeah, it is, because you fall asleep.""  Then he snapped and said, ""Wait a minute, that wasn't a date.""  We went to see a movie together about a month and a half ago, and he payed for me.  I took out my wallet and offered to pay him back, but then he said not to worry.  Soon after he said, ""This is why I don't take girls out on dates--I'm cheap."" Right before we walked into the theater, he told me to find us seats, and asked if I wanted anything from the snack bar.  Then once the movie was over, he hailed a cab for himself, and just before he got in, he gave me a kiss on the cheek, and went on his way.  Oh, and I can't forget the phone convo we had later that night.  I thanked him for taking me out, and he said, ""Don't thank me.  I owed it to you.""  

Call me crazy, but wouldn't statements and actions such as those imply that it was, indeed, a date?  I'll admit, as much as I want to think that it was one, I have to try to convince myself otherwise because I know he'd say something like that in front of our friends.  Why can't he just admit to himself (as well as others) that it's okay to take me out and call it a fucking date?  This kid stresses me out so much.  I need to take a vacation from him lol."

"event","So, today is my 22nd birthday...

Yeah.

Woo.

I guess being I have to work, I'm not entirely excited.  Or perhaps I got the excitement out of my system when going out on Friday and Saturday.  

Or maybe it's something else...

I was hanging out with Tynan last night, and he was constantly talking about one of my roommates.  It caught me off guard cause he never, ever brings up her name as often as he did last night.  I noticed that they've been hanging out a lot lately, and I hate to admit this, but it's getting to me.  I've never had to compete with someone to get his attention.  For two years, it's always been just me and Tynan.  Now that we live down the hall from one another, my roommates have gotten to know him and his roomies.  At first, my roommates would only come over because I was there.  Now that they've gotten to know the guys, they no longer go to chase after me, but stop by to hang out with them.  I should be happy that everyone is getting along, but I can't help but feel jealous.  I miss hanging out with him one on one.  It erks me when we're hanging out, then someone else walks in the room mid-way in our conversation and stays in the room. 

But as far as last night went, something seemed different.  I couldn't help but get the feeling that Tynan is attracted to my roommate.  He offered to make me dinner, then right afterwards, he said I should ask my roomie if she wants some, too.  When I did ask her, she said no, and on 3 occassions, he told me to ask if she wanted any, despite my relaying her message of ""no.""  He made a few more remarks, and later in the evening, I just had it.  I said, ""Well, you'be been talking about 'so and so' a lot tonight.  What's up with that?""  Then he said he just noticed that she's been down in the dumps as of late and just wanted to be nice.  Yeah, that's fine, but I can't help but think there's something a little deeper than that.  

I don't want to feel this way because it's so frustrating--I have strong feelings for my best friend, who may have feelings for my roommate.  How the hell am I supposed to deal with that?  I want someone I can't have because he doesn't feel the same way about me.  It's a kick in the stomach when he compares me to her, and says things like, ""She took care of me when I was sick.  She made me a grilled cheese sandwich.""  Yeah, well don't fucking forget who walked to the store to get you medicine, walked to another store to get you soup, cooked it, took your temperature multiple times, and tucked you into bed.  Shit, I do so much for this fucking kid, and the one thing that sticks out in his mind is the fact that my fucking roommate made him a grilled cheese sandwich on one fucking occassion!  Shit, I do so much for him practically every day!  

I need to calm down cause I know I'm overreacting a bit.  But it's so fucking hard dealing with emotions, especially when you know you can't do anything about them.  I wish I could've gotten over him years ago, but for some reason I simply can't.  And the fact that we spend so much time together only makes my feelings for him stronger.  As stupid as this sounds, he's not the perfect guy, and I don't even know why I like him.  But for some reason, I'm incredibly attracted to him (not just physically) and need him in my life.  I tell him everything, and I trust him.  But there are times when he can be such an ass, and I only want to punch him.  We definitely have a love/hate relationship, but it works.  Though we can get on each other's nerves at times, we still know how to pick up the pieces, and forget about our troubles the next day.  

But there is something I want to make clear, though.  I'm not holding myself back from meeting anyone else because of him.  People may think I do, but I don't.  In fact, I have dated other people despite liking him.  I know where Tynan stands as far as his feelings go about me. He's told me he likes me, but he can't be my boyfriend.  He doesn't want a girlfriend at this time in his life, and that's fine.  Thus, I know I can't bank on having a relationship with him.  But if I were to meet someone tonight who's the least bit interesting, I'll give that guy the time of day.  I just wish that I didn't have these feelings for him anymore, and can have a normal friendship with him.

If it does turn out that Tynan likes my roommate, I don't know how I can deal with that.  I know I'll get incredibly upset, and it's going to make things awkward for people.  Fuck...I wish I could swallow a pill that will clear me up of this love sickness I have."

"event","Though it isn't until Wednesday, I think it's safe to say that my 22nd birthday is the best one thus far.  I went out Friday evening with a group of friends from school, and it was truly a pleasant experience--I couldn't wipe the smile off my face.  We made our way to Puglia Ristorante, my favorite Italian restaurant, then enjoyed a comedy show at the Laugh Lounge.  Though some people couldn't attend, I had a wonderful time, and am truly grateful to all that showed up.  They treated me to a wonderful dinner, beautiful toasts, and countless laughs.  I can't stop looking at the pictures because it was such an incredible night.  

Before I went out again last evening, my friend Tynan gave me a kiss on the cheek and said, ""Thank you for inviting me.  I had a great time.""  That was truly the icing on the cake.  You see, he tends to spend his weekends with friends outside of college, and keeps his school friends separate from his other friends.  The fact that he gave up his Friday night to celebrate my birthday means so much to me.  He doesn't like to try new things, but he swallowed his pride and went to the comedy club.  After every joke, I couldn't help but look at him because I could tell he was having a great time--he was laughing harder than most of us.  Nothing can shake off that feeling of satisfaction.  He's my best friend at Fordham, and I want to spend as much time with him before we graduate.  I don't know how things will be once school is over, but I know I'm going to miss him terribly. 

Aside from that, two of my roommates and I went out to dinner with our friends Gina and Alyssa last night.  We celebrated my birthday again by having a self-proclaimed ""Girls' Night.""  Though the wait at Blockheads was a bit annoying, the food was great and the margaritas were fantastic.  I drank mine a little too fast and felt it just as dinner was served lol.  We went to our friend's apartment afterwards, then went back to mine about an hour later.  Gina and my friend Eric felt the need to make waffles, so they played Better Crocker for a lil while lol.  

All in all, I had a wonderful weekend, and am truly blessed to have the friends that I have here at Fordham.  They truly make my life worth living, and I wouldn't ask for better people to spend this last year of college with.

"event","Just when I thought he was out of my life for good, he contacted me.  What are the odds of that?  I received a text message from an unfamiliar phone number last Sunday, and after reading it a second time, I knew it was him.  I played dumb and asked who it was, and he revealed his identity.  We spoke on the phone for about half-an-hour or so, and he genuinely sounded interested in how I'm doing.  I, on the other hand, didn't sound as excited because I was in a state of shock.  I couldn't believe he had the audacity to contact me, seeing how he ignored me the last time he was home.  I wanted to confront him about that, but the timing wasn't right.  He was in a bus with a bunch of Marines, and I didn't feel comfortable having that type of conversation while he didn't have any privacy.    

He told me he'll be home by the end of the month, but he didn't outright ask to make plans (nor did I).  I learned my lesson from years past, and I'm not going to chase after him anymore.  If he wants to see me, he can pick up the phone and call.  But I'm not holding my breath.  He always sets me up for disappointment, and I know better not to allow that to happen again.  For instance, as we were getting off the phone the other night, he asked what I'd be doing the following evening.  I told him I had class until 9, and he said he'd give me a call around that time.  Low and behold, no word from him since he mentioned that.  Oh well...  The ball is in his court now, and I'm merely standing on the sidelines."

"event","As the semester rolls on, I can't help but get ansy about graduation.  Though it is months away, I can't help but feel that time is going by so quickly.  The thought of graduating is bitter-sweet.  Yes, I'll finally be on my way to attaining a career in the so-called ""real world,"" but the thing I'll miss most is leaving all of my friends behind.  Of course, it's all a part of growing up, as they say, but it's such a hard reality to face.  The people I've grown close to within the past four years are some of the most incredible people I've ever met.  I can't help but get teary-eyed every time I think about saying that last goodbye to my best friend here.  He and I have had a roller coaster of a friendship, but despite all of our bickering, we always know how to kiss and make up.  I believe that we will remain friends after college, but I don't know how often we'd be able to see each other.  That's something I'm going to have a difficult time with because we see each other practically every day.  Being we live down the hall from one another, it's so easy to spend time together.  Gosh, it will be a hard reality not being able to see him whenever I want once we're out of here.

I know most of my recent entries seem to focus on the theme of graduation, but it's something that's frequently on my mind.  If I could turn back the hands of time and re-live all of this, I would, but I don't think I'd change any of it.  Yes, I have gone through some of the worst things imaginable, but it would be selfish of me to say I'd change any of it; if it weren't for such events, I wouldn't be the person I am today.  We shouldn't have any regrets, but learn from our mistakes and misfortunes.

Instead, I spend my time either doing work, cooking, or hanging out with friends...primarily the latter =P  The semester is going by rather fast, but in spite of that, I'm having a blast.  It's such a scary thought knowing this is my last fall semster, though.  It feels like I was a freshman merely a week ago =P  

The thought of life after college scares me every day.  I'm going to miss my friends terribly, and I don't know what type of job I'll have.  Hell,  I don't know if I'll even have a job.  I'll be damned if I get stuck working at IGA in the months following graduation.  I highly doubt that'll happen considering I have a great job at the museum, but nothing lasts forever, right?  I suppose I should stop being so pessimistic about this, but I can't help but feel like I'm not doing much to sculpt my future.  I feel like an idiot for not looking into grad schools right away.  Ideally, I would have preferred going right after graduation, but I haven't taken the GREs, nor looked into any schools.  I suppose it would be nice to go abroad within the next year, but considering my finances and family's circumstances, that may not be a wise decision.  le sigh...What is a girl to do with her life?"

"event","Well, I think it's about time I update this thing.  I moved back to school on August 27th, and I've been having a ball.  I absolutely love my roommates, and I'm so glad that some of my dear friends live right down the hall from us.  I cannot ask for better classes, either.  My schedule is as follows:

Monday/Thursday
Hitler's Germany
2:30-3:45

Acting for Non-majors (Mondays only)
6:00-8:45

Tuesday/Friday
Art, Morality and Politics
10:00-11:45

Age of Cathedrals
11:30-12:45

So check this...upon first seeing my acting teacher, I noticed she looked quite familiar.  Throughout class, I was trying to figure out what actress she looks like, then it hit me, ""Hey!  She looks like the mother from Clarissa Explains it All!""  As I was making my way back to Rose Hill, I was almost positive it's her.  Once I got back to my dorm, I ran to my DVD collection, popped in the first season of ""Clarissa Explains it All,"" and sure enough, it's her!  How friggin cool is that?  Haha...  

Besides that, I started my new position at the museum.  It's alright, but I'm kinda bummed that I'm sacrificing my weekends.  Regardless, I need to keep in mind that I need the money.  I am still working at the History department, but that's not enough to get by, especially now that I have to buy groceries for the apartment.  I'm making ends meet, so I guess that's all that matters.

Otherwise, life is good lol.  My family is alright, and my friends are fabulous.  I miss my friends from home, and can't wait to see them, especially around my birthday/Thanksgiving.  Kat, you gotta get your ass down here at some point this year!  Well, I gotta get back to work.  Once I get my computer back (I had to send it to Compaq), I'll post some more.  Until then, auf wiedersehen!"

"event","I feel like such an idiot.  I guess I let the stress I've been going through get the best of me because I drank way too much last night.  I went to the City with Ernesto, and we chilled at a bar not far from Grand Central.  Don't get me wrong, I had a great time, but I made poor decisions that inevitably upset other people.  First off, I should not have had two long island iced teas, half of Ernesto's beer, and a shot of tequila.  Second off, I should have paced myself.  Third off, I should not have thrown myself at someone I just met on the corner.  Forth off, I should not have called certain people in my condition.  I really pissed off Tynan last night, and I'm too nervous to call him to apologize.  This isn't the first time this has happened, and I already know what he's going to say.  In addition, I stupidly called Kevin, but he did not pick up.  I just hope to God I did not leave a message, cause I cannot remember if I did so.  I deleted his number from my phone so that I won't call him like that in the future.

Needless to say, by the time Ernesto and I got back to Fordham, he wasn't too pleased with me.  He and I sat on a bench outside of Finlay, and he told me he's upset with me, and that he'd prefer talking about it at another time.  I begged that he'd talk to me then, but of course he did not.  We spoke earlier this afternoon, but we did not discuss the matter at hand.  He said that he is upset with me, but we're not going to ""break up"" over anything (keep in mind, that was a joke lol).  We've had these conversations before because I've had to confront him about his drinking on a few occasions.  I am dreading this convo because I don't like criticism.  However, I need to swallow my pride, and just deal with it.  I know I fucked up, and to be completely honest, we all do from time to time.  I have been trying to make a conscious effort to control my behavior while drinking, but I slipped up last night.  Quite honestly, it doesn't help that I went out with the intention of getting drunk.  I've been dealing with so much at home, and I definitely was in a crummy mood yesterday.  While at work, my co-workers even noticed and asked if I was alright.  Next thing I knew, Ernesto and I made plans to go out and from that moment, I knew I wanted to drink.  

This is something I have to work on, and I know I can do it.  Again, we all slip and fall at times, and all we can do is get up and keep on trucking.  I just hope that Ernesto can be understanding, and realize that he, too, has stumbled in his tracks, as well."

"event","I need to get the hell out of this house...thank goodness I move back on Wednesday.  I can't deal with this shit anymore.  If I wake up to my mom arguing with my grandma over money one more time, I am going to scream.  I understand that my mother has a very minimal income.  But she has to realize that we all can't give her money whenever she needs it.  Times are hard for all of us.  Yeah, I am working extra hours this week, but I didn't get paid yet.  Hell, I already gave her $40 this week.  As a result, I only have $30 in my pocket.  Oh, and the kicker occurred on Monday...Just as I gave my mom money, my grandma came in my room and asked for $50.  Seriously, this is fucking bullshit.  She has money to gamble every fucking day.  The smart thing to do is stop playing the lotto so that you know you do have fucking money in your pocket.  Ugh...

Besides that, things already went to shit with Kevin.  I knew it was too good to be true.  I was hanging out with Alex the other night, and I called him.  He didn't pick up, but did send a text in response to my earlier text saying, ""Hey, I had a great time last night =) We should hang out again before you go away.""  His response was, ""We will c, I'm pretty busy the next few days.""  Then I sent him a text saying, ""...Don't be shy or nervous to call or pick up my calls, 4 that matter.""  Then he had the audacity to say, ""I won't.  I'm sexually frustrated.""  Who the fuck says that to a girl after going on one date?!  Then he sent me a text saying he was ""just kidding.""  I called him back, and he said he was just joking, and that he wanted to go back to bed cause he had work the next morning.  I gave him a piece of my mind and told him if that's what he expected from me on the first date, he's damn mistaken.   Awhile later, he texted me and said, ""Hey, I wasn't looking for sex. But u're a nice gal and I am a busy person, and I don't want to waste ur time.""  In response, I said, ""Hey, you're not wasting my time.  I was just taken aback by that text.  I don't want you to think I'm not interested in you, cause I am.  I just want to get to know you better.  Ten minutes later, he sent another text saying, ""Hey, I wasn't looking for sex.  I did have a good time last night.""  

That was the last I heard from him.  I don't want to be the person to call or text him first.  If he really is interested in me, and not interested in sex, then I think he'd try to contact me to sort all of this out.  I spoke to a handful of people, and they really think he's just looking for sex.  They believe he's lying when he said he was ""just kidding"" because I called him out on that text.  They don't doubt that's what he's looking for because why else would he send something like that to a girl he barely knows?  He definitely fucked up, and it's such a damn shame because I thought things were different with him."

"event","I really should try to update this thing more often...

So, I have some great news that I'd like to share with all of you.  A couple of weeks ago, Ute, the General Manager at the Museum of Biblical Art, stopped by.  She's on maternity leave at the moment, but she likes to come in at least once a week to see how things are going.  I stopped by her office to see what she thought of the binders I put together for her.  She absolutely loved them!  We walked over to the filing cabinet so I could show her the additional projects I worked on, and she was very impressed.  She and I stood outside of my office, and she said, ""We've had a great bunch of interns this summer.  Trust me, I've seen a lot come and go, but you girls are fantastic.  And I gotta say, you especially.""  That was a total ego booster, and I'm ecstatic that she singled me out like that.  

Last Wednesday, I was walking out of my office, and I heard Ute talking about me with two of my co-workers, Michelle and Debbie.  So, I walked over because I wanted to know what was going on.  Michelle saw me approaching, and she said, ""Oh, we were just talking about you.""  Then I replied, ""So I've heard.""  She then explained that the museum is receiving a lot of visitors due to the latest exhibition on display, and they could really use the help in Visiting Services.  She knew I am looking for a weekend job during the school year, and asked if I'd like to officially join the MOBIA staff.  Ute then explained that she is pleased with my work, and would love for me to join their team as a part-time worker.  In the meantime, Debbie was sitting in her cubicle whispering, ""TAKE THE JOB, TAKE THE JOB!""  I was taken aback, and quite thrilled that they offered me a job.  I asked how much they'd pay an hour, and Ute said $10 an hour.  They then said, ""Take your time making your decision,"" but I replied, ""I think I made it already.  I'll take the job!""  

I start training on Monday, which is good considering the museum is closed on Mondays.  I am very excited and quite thrilled that they asked me.  I recently applied for a job at the school book store.  I heard it's not the best job, and I only applied there cause I really could use the money.  Now that I was offered this job at the museum, I have a better chance at seeking other positions in the museum field, whether at MOBIA or elsewhere.

In other news, I went to my friend's ""wedding"" last Friday night at Kelly's Pub, aka Cassie's.  I went with my friend Katrina, and the night started off on the wrong foot when the bartender gave Kat a hard time for being underage.  As Kat and I were trying to come up with a plan of action, this guy came outside to have a cigarette.  Moments earlier, I noticed that he was standing with Daren, the ""groom,"" so I asked him if he knows the bartender.  He told us not to worry, and if anything, he'd get us drinks at the bar.  Needless to say, I introduced myself to him, and he told us his name is Kevin.  After chit-chatting for a minute or so, we walked back inside, and he kinda shielded us until we made our way to the back.  He then walked over with his friend Steve, the bagpiper.  We started talking as they were playing darts.  As the night progressed, we talked a bit more, but not too much.  Once the wedding was over, I stood outside the bar with him for a few minutes.  He said that Kat and I seemed like cool people, and he'd like to hang out with us again.  We exchanged numbers and called it an evening. 

The next morning, I woke up to an unknown phone call, and a text message.  It was Kevin.  He and I sent texts to one another early in the morning, then he asked if I would like to go out with him some time for dinner and a movie.  He then said that I looked ""beautiful"" the night before, and that I ""caught his eye.""  ::blush::  

We went out last night, and I could tell from the start that he was nervous.  I honestly felt like I was on a date during high school, but it was a very endearing moment.  We were pressed for time, so we got a slice of pizza.  We then headed down Central Ave. to see ""Mirrors.""  Unfortunately, the movie was sold out, so we opted to see ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"" at United Artist instead.  It was just the two of us in this huge theater, until some old man came strolling in.  The movie was alright.  I think George Clooney, I mean George Lucas hit his peak a long time ago.  He needs to chill out cause this animated stuff is simply going to put a damper on the awesome work he's produced in the past. 

Besides that, Kevin and I went back to his apartment after the movie and watched the Olympics.  He has a cute cat named Sam, and he's quite friendly.  We were playing with him for awhile, and sat on his awesome reclining couch.  The most entertaining thing happened next when he yawned, stretched out his arms, and wrapped one around my shoulders.  I couldn't help myself and said, ""smooth move.""  Then he said, ""Sorry, I've been wanting to do that all night.  That guy in the theater totally ruined my game.  Plus, I'm really nervous, too.  I think I'll even be like this when I'm 40.""  So I told him I could tell that he was nervous, and not to worry.  He eventually leaned in to give me a kiss (and asked if it was alright), but I stopped him because I don't want to rush into anything too fast.  I honestly felt like I broke his heart.  So he went to move his arm, and I said that we could still sit like that.  I just didn't want to kiss him yet because I want to get to know him better.  Oh, before that he said, ""You're so beautiful...you have beautiful eyes...I think you are an awesome person...""  Needless to say, I was rather flattered by those compliments.  He seems like a really sweet guy, and I'm glad that we went out last night.  I definitely would like to see him again."

"event","He's out of my life...I deleted his number and screen name, and de-friended him on MySpace and Facebook.  I am done.  I am through with the stress and frustration of wanting to know if he truly cares.  He clearly doesn't.  

I would write more about this, and even include pieces of a document I've been writing that was originally meant to be this entry, but I decided not to.  It's senseless.  I can vent until I am blue in the face, but nothing I say, type, or express would even matter at this point.  What's done is done...I am through with him.  I have given up on our friendship because it is clear to me that he has given up on it a long time ago.  

I will say this--Despite how I feel right now, I do hope that you make it through Iraq safe and sound.  I do not know if our paths will ever cross again, but if they don't, I hope you have a good life, and it was nice knowing you...Good bye."

"event","I truly feel that my family is falling apart.  Ever since we found out we're losing the house, there has been so much tension, you can cut it with a knife.  I try to keep a positive attitude, but it's hard dealing with my mother and her mood swings.  My grandma doesn't make it any easier because she's constantly bitching at everyone, and makes you feel like a piece of shit (despite your best efforts to continue your every day routine).  My brother only fends for himself, and does what he wants when he wants.  I guess having a car allows you to do things like that.  However, he needs to learn to be more respectful to my mother and grandmother because he's not making any of this easier for them.  I think he has anger issues, too, because you can ask him a simple question, and he'll flip a shit.  He especially does this with my grandma.  Though she can get on your case a lot, I don't think raising your voice at her makes matters any better. 

Due to our financial struggles, everyone is feeling rather downcast.  I wish I can give more to my family, but I simply can't.  As you know, I have an unpaid internship, and I only work one day at IGA.  I can barely get by.  I have to be sure I have enough for my credit card and phone bill every month, and I was recently hit with a large and unexpected bill which really put a damper on my mood.  Yeah, I like to have spending money in my pocket so that I can go out and enjoy myself with my friends on the weekend.  Though, that can be a bit stressful, too, because my friends and I love hanging out in the City.  Everything is so much more expensive, and the cost of transportation can add up, as well.  I am fortunate to have a few friends who are willing to treat me every once and awhile, but I feel bad knowing that I can't return the favor.  For instance, I went to a Mets game last night, and my friend Phil paid for my ticket (not because he knows about my financial situation, but did so simply out of the kindness of his heart).  I wanted to do something nice for him in return, so I offered to buy him a beer, but he settled for a soda.  He spent $25 on me, and I simply spent $5.75 on him.  I wish I could've done more, and I should've offered to buy him a hot dog when he said he was hungry.  Ugh...I hate having to worry about every penny I spend, and living pay check to pay check.  Yes, it's common for college kids to go about their lives in this fashion.  But most of them at least have the comfort knowing that mommy and daddy can help support them if they are in need.  I don't have that comfort...My mother and grandmother come to us when they need financial help.  Hell, they can't even afford to buy a decent food order.  I feel so bad that my mother has to go through this.  I wish that I can lift this burden off of her shoulders because she has enough to worry about.  

I may continue writing this later because my brother needs to borrow my computer.  More to come..."

"event","I don't know what it is, but I'm not feeling like myself as of late.  I was in a great mood yesterday, but the second I got home, I felt really down in the dumps.  You see, when I moved back home for the summer, I found out that we're losing our house.  With that, my uncle is doing everything in his power to let us stay here for a bit longer.  Up until yesterday, I didn't let this get to me.  I guess the way in which my grandma breaks things down can definitely get to a person.  I can't deal with her, and I just want to get out of this house.  It really sucks because I have to be under this roof for another month before I can go back to school.  When I'm here, I tend to over analyze things waaaay too much, and it begins to put a damper on my mood.  When I'm at school, I can at least get up and go to my friend's room to talk to him.  I obviously can't do that now because we're apart.  Yes, I can very well pick up the phone and call him.  However, he doesn't like to talk on the phone for too long, and it's hard to have a decent and heart-filled conversation.  I know I have my friends at home, but everyone has a different schedule.  Though we've been home for close to two months now, I've only seen them a handful of times.  This summer has really been a wash out, if you ask me. 

In addition to this, I've been having really bad dreams for the past couple of nights.  I don't want to go into details, but they've been about my friend who is going to Iraq.  These dreams have been very upsetting--they always result in me losing him, in one way or another.  Ultimately, that's what I'm scared of.  All I want to do right now is talk to him, but I haven't been able to reach him for the past couple of days.  He IMed me the other night, but I was asleep.  It sucks that we're on the opposite sides of the country.  This three hour time difference sometimes makes it hard for us to talk because I've been going to bed fairly early.  He goes online late, and I tend to be getting ready for bed by that time.  Le sigh...What am I going to do with myself?"

"event","This weekend was quite boring, to say the least (well, except for Thursday night =P)  After work, I went out with Alex and Amanda.  We saw WANTED, and I gotta admit, it was an awesome movie.  Go and see it!  When it was over, we went to the Haunt, but didn't stay for too long.  I did, however, bump into my friends Tom and Paula, and met some new people (which is always fun).  In addition, I bumped into Sam, one of my friends from high school.  I last saw her at my friend Desire's house, which was back in November '06.  It was definitely nice seeing her again, though I didn't recognize her at first =P  When we left the bar, we made our way to Cross County to meet up with one of Alex's co-workers.  We then went to Frog on McLean.  I wound up bumping into Rachel, a friend of mine from Fordham.  It was nice catching up with her.  As the night progressed, Amanda and I felt a little bored because Alex was mainly spending time with her co-worker and his friends.  So I thought it would be fun to talk to random people.  Turns out, the two guys we started to talk to know a lot of girls we went to high school with.  It's truly a small world...

The Fourth of July was a complete wash-out.  I stayed home and vacuumed my room =P  It was hard making plans this year because all of my friends had different things to attend to.  I did, however, get to see some fireworks from my front porch.  It's always nice having neighbors shoot illegal fireworks from their backyards =P

I spent my whole Saturday in IGA, working for a co-worker who went away for the weekend.  I needed some extra cash so I took advantage of getting extra hours by working her shift.  I worked again on Sunday, but was in a pissy mood.  That all changed early in the afternoon when an unexpected visitor decided to buy some lunch.  I was leaning against my register, staring into space because business was slow.  I was looking out the door, with my eyes gazing at the floor.  I noticed a pair of Adidas making their way into the store, and said to myself, ""Dude, those are Tynan's shoes.""  As I looked up, I noticed the familiar cami shorts and the white under shirt.  I then made eye-contact with his face and exclaimed, ""Oh my God!""  He turned, and looked at me and said, ""Oh shit!""  Haha...we both rushed to one another, and opened up our arms for a big hug.  We made small talk, then he went to the deli to get some sandwiches.  As he was paying for his merchandise, we were talking about a few things, then I said to him, ""I had this gut feeling you were in town this weekend.  For some odd reason, a part of me knew you were staying with your friend in my neighborhood, and you'd stop by the store today.""  And honest to God, I had that feeling since Thursday night.  Anywho...He then said, ""Ya know, I had a feeling this is the IGA you work at.  I remember you telling me you see my friends shop here all the time, and I know you live relatively close to the store.  So, I was hungry and I figured you'd be working today, and thought I'd come to check it out.""  Teehee!  He totally made my day!  He said that he'll give me a call the next time he's in town.  In a sarcastic tone, I replied, ""Do you really mean that?""  Then he said, ""Of course!""  I'm holding him to it now!  Haha..."

"event","I feel like this suddenly fell on me like a ton of bricks...He's going to Iraq.

Just when I thought I was over him, my heart won't allow me to.  I've put my best foot forward, I opened myself up to meeting other guys.  However, he's always in the back of my mind.  Regardless of how I feel, he doesn't feel the same way about me, so it should be easy for me to get over him, right?  Wrong...I've been battling this for years now, and the feelings just won't go away.  My friends often times get frustrated with me because they don't want to see me get hurt again.  Hell, they hate it when they see me wear this charm around my neck.  But they just don't get it.  Regardless of the feelings I still harbor, I wear this necklace as a testament to our friendship, and I told  him that the day I gave him the other half.  We've both been through a lot, and we've been there for one another to help pick up the pieces.  Recently, I've been going through something, and he's the one person who truly helped me get back in gear, and keep a positive outlook on life.  Though he doesn't open up as elaborately as I do, he still tells me enough to know what's going on, and I try as best as I can to be there and support him no matter what.  I believe it's in God's Hands if he and I were to be together someday, but despite what life may throw at us, I'll do anything to protect and continue my friendship with him.   

We've been talking to each other a lot more as of late, and I'm happy to say that it feels like old times once again.  I was looking forward to potentially seeing him at some point this summer, but then he told me the truth.  He was planning on coming home in August.  Instead, he's being deployed that month.  He'll be gone for a year, and he's rather excited to go.  I know how passionate he is about serving this country, and I admire that.  At the same time, though, it's only natural to feel pessimistic about the fact that he's going to war.  Anything can happen, and I'll be damned if something does...

I was laying in bed for a good thirty minutes or so, but I can't sleep.  I can't help but think about things, and what I would like to say to him before he gets shipped out.  I play the conversation in my mind over and over again, and I can't help but be brought to tears.  I'd give anything just to see him one last time.  We did see one another last summer, but things didn't feel right to me.  It's hard for me to explain it, but things seemed rather off.  But I'll never forget that last hug we shared moments before he stepped into his car.  Though he mentioned he wanted to see me one more time during his stay, I knew it was going to be the last time I'd see him before he went back to training.  It was a strong hug, a long hug.  And the kiss on the cheek was a sweet one.  If something were to potentially happen, I'd be content with that being the last memory we shared together.  However, I can't help but sound selfish right now because I would like to see him one last time.  Unfortunately, he admitted that's probably not possible.  I'd give anything for one last hug, one last kiss on the cheek... 

I hate sounding so morbid and pessimistic right now.  I should be more optimistic and display great support for him.  I'll be honest, I wasn't too enthused when he admitted to using my name and address as a reference on his recruitment form.  That left a sour taste in my mouth, as they say, and I just didn't have such a good feeling about it.  I'm rather passive, and do not agree with this war.  It sucks knowing that someone I truly and deeply care for will be going there, potentially putting his life on the line.  As much as I want to be optimistic that he'll come home safe and sound, this horrible feeling resides in the pit of my gut.  I'll tell ya, it's not a pleasant feeling, and I wish it would go away.  I had a stream of dreams about it last night, one of which involved someone aiming a gun at his head.  I woke up feeling incredibly uneasy, and rather frightened.  

Once he's there, I know I'm going to have a rough time dealing with it.  My friend Matt went to Iraq, and I couldn't help but worry about him.  We exchanged letters, and talked on AIM when he had the opportunity to do so.  Heck, I even received two phone calls from him while he was there.  Despite being exhausted, he pulled through it, and made it home.  Unfortunately, he got into a horrible car accident days after being back in NY, delaying his second tour of duty.  I spoke to him about a month ago, but he doesn't seem like the same person he was before he left.  I feel that if my friend were to make it back to the States after his year at war, things won't be the same.

Although I'm not thrilled that he's going, I do plan on supporting him, and keeping his morale up.  I hope to send him letters and packages as often as I can.  He's truly a wonderful person, and has so much to live for.  When he has his mind set on something, he goes out there and does it.  Re-enlisting with the Marines was one goal.  Now setting foot on Iraqi soil is another.  He'll stop at nothing to get what he wants, and his drive and determination are quite admirable.  Though I fear for his safety, I pray with all of my heart that he'll be able to come home and attain his third goal--starting a family.  I know how passionate he is about raising a beautiful and strong family.  He'd make a wonderful father someday, and his kids would be the luckiest children in the world.  

In light of this entry, I would like to pay homage to all of the men and women who have served, and those who currently serve in the US military.  If it weren't for them, we would not enjoy the freedoms we tend to take for granted day in and day out.  I would also like to honor those who have lost their lives in the line of duty.  They did not lose their lives in vain, and we salute them for their service and the ultimate sacrifice they made in the name of American freedom."

"event","I've been itching to write something, but I don't know what.  Not so much a journal entry, but I've been toying with the idea of writing an autobiographical piece.  Yes, this journal is autobiographical, but I want to write something deeper.  I want to delve into the more personal things that have been going on in my life, but I want to write it for myself.  That is, for my eyes only.  I started writing something a few weeks ago, but I wound up deleting most of it about a week after typing it.  I wasn't satisfied with the way it came out.  I would also like to start writing poetry again, but I need some inspiration.  When looking back to high school, I found it so easy to write a poem.  Now that I've been in college, though, I've been struggling to produce anything worth while.  Hmmm...

Well, aside from that, I didn't work at my internship at all this week.  I've been home sick with an ear infection since Monday.  I'm starting to feel better now, and I'm sure I'll be fine by Monday.  I hate the fact that I've missed the entire week of work.  Though there wasn't much work to get done, I like being able to get up and go somewhere everyday.  

Oh, I forgot to mention...my digital camera broke a few weeks ago.  I brought it back to the store because I have insurance, however, the Geek Squad representative I spoke to told me I did not have coverage for accidents, ie cracked screens.  I'd have to pay about the same I paid for the camera to fix the damage.  So, I bought a new camera this afternoon.  I wasn't too thrilled with my purchase because I wanted to get the blue Sony camera, but they only sell it online.  Thus, I had to settle for the standard silver model.  Also, I went a lil over my budget.  I didn't want to spend too much for another camera, but after playing around with it, I'm glad I did go through with buying it.  The camera has soooo many great features that my old camera didn't have.  Hell, I barely knew how to work my old camera, and I had it for 2 years!  

Well, I'm gonna lay down and read my book.  Have a good night, ya'll!"

It's probably wise not to go into work tomorrow, but I can't stand sitting in my house anymore.  Blah...I called out for the past two days, and don't want to miss any more work.  I guess I'll make up my mind when I wake up tomorrow morning...

While at home, I've been in contact with someone I met a few weekends ago.  He and I met at a bar in White Plains.  At the end of the night, we exchanged numbers, and he promised he'd call me.  However, after a week passed, I didn't hold my breath anymore.  To my surprise, though, he sent me a text message on Saturday night.  Our texts haven't been more than ""Hey, how are you...what did you do today...blah, blah, blah..."" but I hope that changes.  He seems like a really sweet guy and easy to talk to.  However, it seems like he's very busy.  Eh, I don't want to get too ahead of myself here.

AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!  ::Gaining composure::  My friend Eric and I are gonna see them at Continental Airlines Arena (now the Izod Center), and I'm super excited!  I have been a fan of theirs since I was 3 or 4 years old lol.  Most people our age have never even heard a song by NKOTB, and my friends think I'm insane for being a fan.  Being my sister is 5 years older than me, I have been exposed to more dated things, such as the New Kids on the Block.  Growing up, she and I used to listen to their cassette tapes with our neighbors, Lisa and Tanya.  We would memorize dance moves and put on performances, play with our New Kids dolls (I still have mine!), and have themed birthday parties, with our favorite boy band members' faces on party favors.  Ah...this is going to be an amazing show. 

Besides this exciting news, I'm starting my internship in a matter of hours.  I'm looking forward to working at MOBIA this summer.  However, I found another internship opportunity, and plan on applying.  The development department at the Museum of New York City is looking for a new intern, and it's a paying position.  If I get it, I'd feel bad turning down MOBIA.  However, I need a paying job.  Though I'd be learning museum skills that will pay off in the future, it will be a financial burden.  My family does not have a steady income and cannot help support me.  Even if they did, I wouldn't feel comfortable relying on them for money.  Granted, I am working at IGA on Sundays, but a 5 hour work day is not enough.  Hopefully everything will work in my favor in the next couple of weeks."

"event","I'm home now.  I finished finals last Wednesday and moved back home on Saturday.  I was meaning to update sooner, but I didn't have much motivation to write anything.  Since I've been home, I feel like I'm harping on things too often.  I miss being at school because I can get up and go where ever I want, whenever I want.   With that, I can go to a friend's room, and confide in him whenever I need to vent.  But I can't do that now...  I'm sure things will lighten up once everyone is home and I start working.  However, I can't help but miss my friends at school, especially Tynan.  I swear to you, he's been in my dreams every night since I've been home.  My mom agrees with me that this is probably the case because I used to see him every day.  It would be nice if I get to see him at least once over break.

I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday, and he feels I should take down the link to my LJ from Facebook.  I asked him why, and he feels that I reveal too much in my entries.  To be honest though, I refrain from expressing a lot of things on here.  For the most part, I feel that I use LJ to recap events that have occurred, and yes, I do use it to vent.  However, I have not (at least recently) used it as an outlet to express some of the most personal things I have dealt with within the past two years.  I am considering keeping a personal diary that I can use to discuss  such things.  I very well can change the settings on my LJ and make it private, but not too many people have one, now-a-days.  It's sometimes easier for me to keep it public so that others can understand what I'm going through, without having to go out of my way to tell them.  What do you guys think?"

My friend paid me $7 the other day to do his laundry.  In addition, I washed his roommate's dress shirt because it had wine stains all over it.  I feel bad because two of my friends really wanted me to go out to dinner with them this evening.  I kinda gave them the run around, but I did tell them numerous times that I have a lot of work to get done.  I need to complete a 15-page paper, and study for 2 exams (all for Monday!).

Is it pathetic that I realize tomorrow marks three years since we ended our relationship?  Sheesh...three years sounds like a long time ago, but it feels like it happened yesterday.  Within these past few years, I've seen guys come and go, but nothing has compared to the relationship Mike and I had.  I will admit, someone special did enter my life, but bad timing, distance, and his ambitions got in the way of things.  There's no point in dwelling on that anymore because we will never be together...Hell, I'll be lucky if he even contacts me to see how I'm doing.

I received an email this afternoon from the Curator of Education at the Museum of Biblical Art.  I'm going to meet with her on Friday, the 25th for a possible internship in the development department.  I truly hope everything works out.  I desperately need an internship for this summer.  Although it's unpaid, I will take it because I need to build up my resume.  Keep your fingers crossed!

Since I've been back at school, I gotta admit, these past few weeks have been hectic, and yet fun.  I was working on papers for the past 48 hours, and I honestly can use some sleep right about now!  In addition to that, the past three Saturdays have been dedicated to going to museums for my Early Medieval Art class.  My teacher wanted us to present at the Museum of Biblical Art and the Cloisters.  Besides that, I had to do a presentation in my Intro to African History class, register for classes, work at the History department, and prepare for the Women's Choir Spring Concert (which is this Sunday).  Despite all of that, I've found some time to decompress and hang out with friends.  I went to the City last Friday night and saw The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway.  It was amazing! After that, I met up with Ernesto and Phil, and a group of us went to Blockheads.  I didn't have the food, but they make pretty good margaritas at reasonable prices lol.  Oh, a few days before that, I saw Joe Venice perform at the Ramskellar.  What a show...oh, and it was also lovely seeing my dear Thunderbear, Drew =P  

Well, I'm gonna sit here and continue listening to iTunes and drink beer in my awesome Mets pint class (Thanks, Eric!).

I'd really like to produce a deep, heartfelt entry, but I don't know where to start.  Sophie and I had lunch this afternoon, and we had such a great conversation.  I love talking to her because she helps me put things into perspective.  We reflected on our general attitudes during high school.  I think I touched on this a few entries ago, but I just want to reiterate that I felt like a different person back then.  However, I've been making a conscious effort to return to that state of mind.  I gotta say, I think I've been making some progress, but I  have to work on a few things.  Everything takes time, and I always keep that in mind.  My friend Tynan said something that really touched me the other night.  He said something along the lines of, ""You may think I don't give two shits about you, but that's far from the truth.  I think you have so much potential to do great things.  That's why I'm so hard on you.  I really care about you, and that's why I keep you around...""  I didn't know what to say because that really meant a lot to me.  He's one of my best friends at Fordham.  In fact, I think I can say he truly is my best friend here.  He's the one person who knows everything about me, and when I say everything, I mean everything.  The fact that he addressed that to me helped me realize I can do anything if I put my mind to it.  He always pushes me to try harder, to go out there and try new things.  Although he can rub e and other people the wrong way, he's someone I truly value in my life.  I hope that things won't change between us once we graduate from college. 

Before I depart, I'd like to mention one last thing.  In regards to my happiness, I think I'm in a much better place in comparison to last year.  I dealt with so much, things I don't feel comfortable discussing here on Live Journal.  However, I will say this, I was depressed last year, and I did see counseling to deal with everything.  I'm not ashamed to admit that because it was a wise and healthy decision.  In addition, I want to take this time to express how much I love my core group of friends here at Fordham.  I thought I knew who my friends were last year, but with time, I realized I was hanging out with the wrong crowd.  They did not care about my well being (despite telling me that they were there for me).  Turns out, each one of them was a back stabber, and I will never forget that.  Throughout this school year, though, I've been able to develop a new circle of friends, and they are truly wonderful people.  I know that I can trust them and rely on them in times of need.  If I had more beer left in my glass, I'd literally raise it up to them right now lol.  Fuck it...figuratively speaking, I raise my glass up to my dear friends at Fordham!  Thank you for putting up with my tears, my drunken antics, my random outbursts of singing lol...  Remember, I will always have your back.  If your cousin throws up in your roommate's bed, I'll be there to help with the laundry the next morning.  When you get beat up, I'll be there to put ice on your nose, and help mend your wounds.  When you get sick on a subway, I'll hold your hair back, then walk you back to your dorm to make sure you get home safe and sound...  We've been through a lot (especially within this semester), but despite it all, I hope you remember that I love you!!"

I was overwhelmed because I hadn't served in awhile, and was starting to second guess myself.  I don't know why I get like that at times...

After Mass, Fr. Ashman asked me if I would like to jump on board and serve Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday.  I told him I will gladly do it as long as I have a ride.  I felt so welcomed upon walking into church.  I can't shake off this feeling.  I'm so glad I'm returning to my roots =)"

Despite all of that, I did hang out with a few of my homies the past few days.  Last night, Christina took me out for dinner and a movie.  We ate at Uno's, then saw The Other Boleyn Girl at United Artist.  I liked the movie very much, however, Christina read the book and said it didn't even compare.

I'm trying to stay true to my Lenten promise--quit smoking cigarettes.  It's been a bit of a challenge.  I gave into temptation a few times, but I've been trying to redeem myself.  I also went to Confession two weeks ago.  It was very therapeutic.  Since then, I'm trying to go to Church every weekend, as well as cut back on drinking, and hope to kick my smoking habit once and for all.  I need to start respecting my body.  Since I've been living at school, I've been giving in to so many bad habits that are detrimental to my health.  Granted, most people raise the argument that we're young and we need to experience life before we go out into the real world.  However, I don't equate being reckless to having a good time.  I've done it, and now it's time to move on.  I also want to note that I was a much happier person in high school.  Then, I was a rather devout Catholic, and frowned upon drinking, smoking, and the like.  I want to be that girl once again.  I think it's time to revert to my old ways, and fully embrace my faith once again.  Hmm...perhaps I should look into altar serving at Fordham.  There's a thought."

"event","I've been meaning to write an entry to awhile now, dealing with school and what I've been up to as of late.  However, I want to take this time to write about my concern for one of my friends.  

Since the end of November, I haven't been able to reach one of my good friends from high school.  She and I are very close, and I consider her one of my best friends.  We spent so much time together over the summer, but by the end of August, I noticed something was different.  She got into a car accident, and her parents have been rather strict ever since (keep in mind they are strict all of the time).  We spoke a handful of time once school started, but we haven't seen each other in months.  

She failed to call me for my birthday, which was in November.  However, she contacted me about a week later to apologize for being distant.  She told me that her family is going through a rough patch, and she's been working very hard in order to make ends meet.  I constantly call her, IM her, and leave her messages on Facebook and MySpace, but she doesn't respond.  I spoke to one of her best friends from grade school last week, and she told me that they saw each other a few times over Christmas Break.  I was fortunate to know what was going on, but disheartened at the fact that my friend never responded to my calls, especially over break.  I know I shouldn't take it personally, but I'm very concerned.  I want to be there and help her out.  

I've been thinking about this a lot lately because today is her 21st birthday.  Ever since high school, we used to think about how we'd celebrate our birthdays, especially due to the fact that we're so close in age.  I've called her twice this weekend, and I left her messages.  I sometimes think she may be holding something against me, but that is impossible.  I've been there for her 110% and would never do anything to hurt her.  God, please watch over her and let her know that she has friends who truly care and want to support her during these difficult times."

January 6, 2008: Movies with Kyla
     Kyla, my dear friend from high school lol, took me to the movies.  We saw Juno, and I must say, it was a fabulous movie.  I have to admit, though, I was expecting it to be a lil different, but it was still a great flick. 

January 7, 2008: Galleria with Ernesto/Dunkin Donuts with Chris
     Ernesto and I went to the Galleria for a few hours, and shopped til we dropped...no, not really =P  We went to Aeropostale and Old Navy and used gift cards we received for Christmas.  Afterwards, we grabbed lunch, and he drove me to the train station.  
     In the evening, Chris and I met up and went to Dunkin Donuts.  I hadn't seen him since the summer, and it was great catching up for old times.  He's currently a college freshman, and is so excited about school.  It's awesome seeing someone so enthusiastic about school and meeting new people.  

January 8, 2008: Dunkin Donuts with Kyla and Lauren
     We went to the ""hang out"" spot just to chill out.  I also met Kyla's boyfriend.  The look happy together, by the by.  Any who, as walked into the donut shop, I immediately noticed my childhood friend, Matt.  He just came home from Iraq, and I hadn't seen him since December 2006.  It was so nice seeing him again.  He recently got into a major car accident and broke his neck.  This may hinder his ability to go back to the Marines.  He's truly passionate about serving the country, and does so with great pride.  Although I'm quite passive and hate seeing people go off to war, it would be a shame if Matt couldn't return to the military.  

January 11, 2008: Work at the History Department/Shopping with Melissa
     I went into work to help out around the office.  I didn't realize how much work was ahead of me.  Unfortunately, I couldn't finish everything in time, but it'll get done tomorrow morning.  When we closed the office, my boss and I went to Bronxville and did a little shopping at CVS.  After I made my purchase, I walked to the train station, and my sister Melissa picked me up.  We went to Central Ave. and shopped for my nephew's birthday.  He's going to turn 2 on January 22.  He's getting so big!  While we were out, I bought the Karate Kid on DVD.  Check this...it was only $4.99 + tax!  What a fucking bargain =P  I also bought the new Timbaland CD.  I've been listening to it non-stop.  I think I listened to it about 5 times today...no joke =P

January 12, 2008: Comedy Club with Ernesto and co.
      Yes...I went to another Comedy Club =P  When Ernesto and I went to Broadway Comedy Club on the 28th, we filled out raffle cards.  To our surprise, we received phone calls while we were at the Galleria claiming we won free tickets to NY Comedy Club.  Being Ernesto got the call first, he made arrangements to redeem 10 free tickets.  When the rep called me, I explained I'd be going with Ernesto, so she didn't grant me tickets for another show.  Instead, she'll keep my name in the computer for another drawing.  
     The show was great.  I met a few of Ernesto's friends, too...very nice people.  We took the bus from Fordham Rd. to the 4 train, then transfered to the 6.  We went to a pizza joint before the show, then headed over to the club.  The comedians were funny, but one guy was just ridiculous.  I saw him perform once before, and I thought he was a crack head then.  I was laughing at one of his jokes, and he heard me while on stage.  Then he said, ""My God...that laugh.  How I'd love to stick my dick in your mouth.  I could only imagine what type of noises you'd be making then!""  I was sooo offended.  A lil bit later, I called out, ""Oh, don't forget to read your hand now.""  This guy is on so many drugs, he can't remember his jokes.  Thus, he writes them on his hand.  So then he said, ""Yeah, thanks for reminding me...""  Ugh.
      Despite that, I had a lovely time.  We took the D train back to the Bronx, then hung out at Ernesto's friend's apartment.  I got home around 2:30 or so.  I was sooooo exhausted.

Now, I'm sitting in my dorm, trying to get ready for bed.  Earlier, I cleaned the room, unpacked my belongings, took a shower, and had pizza with Tynan.  We watched tv, and talked about break.  I left his room around 11:15, then returned to my room and started to clean out my desk.  I received a phone call from Steve, and went out in the hall to talk to him.  Just as our conversation was getting good, the fire alarm went off!  We all had to evacuate and stand in the freezing rain and snow.  I hope to the Lord classes will be canceled tomorrow =P  Well, I'm gonna try to go to sleep.  Guten nacht!"

This break has been going very well.  I usually dread coming home because my family drives me crazy, but so far so good.  Let me try to recap the highlights of break:

12/23/07: IGA Christmas Party
     Unfortunately, it didn't compare to the past two parties, but it was nice hanging out with Carrie and Christina.  We still had a great time running up Al's tab =P

12/26/07: Lunch with my Victory girls
     Despite all of the drama, Jenn, Ang, Amanda, Kelly, and I survived lunch at Asian Temptation.  It was nice getting the girls back together, but a few of them were missing in action =(  

12/25/07: Christmas
     Spent the day with the fam, and hung around the house.  The highlight of my day was eating lots and lots of lasagna =P

12/28/07: Comedy show at Broadway Comedy Club
     I was supposed to go with my friend Joe, but he got stuck working a double shift.  At the last minute, my friend Ernesto came with me.  We had a great time getting drunk and laughing at some hysterical comedians.

12/29/07: Hanging out with Will
     Although we walked around my neighborhood and hung around my room for a lil while, I still had an awesome time with Will.  He's one of those people who you can have a grand time with no matter what you do.  Too bad I don't see him that often...it sucks having a friend who goes to school in Texas =P

12/31/07: New Year's Eve at Ernesto's
     I finally did something worthwhile for New Year's!  For the past two years, I've stayed at home, and complained about not going out.  Not the case this year...I went to North Salem and rung in the new year with Ernesto and two of his friends.  We had a lovely time drinking beer, champagne, and wine, while watching Flight of the Conchords ::arf arf::

01/03/07: Dinner at Pizza Beat
     Dinner was amazing.  I savored Italian food with Jenn, Jackie, Katrina, Doug, and Angela.  I don't know how we pulled off a drama free evening =P  It felt so nice being able to sit back and talk about what's going on in our lives.  Despite the freezing cold, we went to Slave to the Grind afterwards.  I truly enjoyed myself that night, and hope we can have nights like that from here on out.

01/04/07: Deadline for the Metropolitan Museum of Art Summer Internship Program
      Boy oh boy...After the headache of tracking down professors at the last minute and getting my documents together, I finally submitted my application.  Of course, Fordham still has a way of fucking me over (they finally posted my grade moments after I printed out my unofficial transcript and mailed it out), but I hope my official transcript gets to the Museum as soon as possible.  

Besides all of this, I've been working at IGA.  I plan on going back to school on Sunday, January 13.  Before then, I hope to hang out with a few more people, have another IGA get-together, get health insurance, and look into more internship opportunities.  Well, I'm gonna go and watch Drop Dead Gorgeous lol.  Ciao =)"

"event","Merry Christmas, everyone =)  Today was an interesting, but good day, to say the least.  I woke up around 11am, and walked into the living room.  I waited to see if my bro wanted to open gifts with me, but he beat me to it.  I only had one gift under the tree, so it wasn't a big deal that he didn't wait.  I got most of my gifts before Christmas, so today wasn't anything special.  My uncle and his girlfriend came upstairs, and we exchanged gifts.  Then we went down to my grandma's apartment and gave her a few presents.  My sister, her fiancee, and the baby came over for dinner.  Before they came, my brother and I went on  a quest to find an open grocery store.  He apparently doesn't like lasagna, so we drove around in search for food.  The only place that was open was Nathan's.  We went in, and surprisingly, people were in there!  It was mad ghetto lol.  We ate dinner, then took my nephew out to see some Christmas decorations.  After that, we gave him his gifts and played with him until they left.  

Even though finances were tight this year and I didn't get much, this was still a pleasing Christmas.  My nephew is such a joy, and I think spending time with him really got me through the day.  

I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas, and a safe and blessed New Year =)"

"event","Sheesh...it's been a couple of weeks since I last wrote.  Well, I'M FINALLY 21!!  Ah, my 21st birthday was a damn good one.  I started celebrating on Thanksgiving.  My family and I shared a cake--nothing too formal.  On Saturday (November 24), I went out to dinner with a few friends from high school.  We went to Dom and Vinny's, one of my favorite restaurants in Yonkers.  My friends surprised me with a cake...I didn't expect it!  Afterwards, my friend Ernesto came down from North Salem, and we went to Tinkers.  Jenn came along with us, however the rest of my friends went home.  We bumped into our friend Joe, and we hung around the bar for a couple of hours.  I drank a couple of beers with my friend on Sunday night (November 25), then jumped in the shower and did some homework.  I clearly didn't go out at midnight like I planned =P  The next day (my birthday), however, felt like any normal day.  It was quite dreary, and I had a case of the Mondays lol.  When I got to work, my boss and one of the workers greeted me with a cake and flowers.  That was so sweet of them =)  After work, my father came down to the Bronx with his girlfriend and we went out to dinner.  We ate at Webster's Cafe, then went to Tinkers to celebrate.  My first legal drink was a shot of Jack Daniels.  How hardcore is that lol.  We threw back quite a few drinks, played pool, then called it a night.  They gave me an iPod Nano and jewelry.  Very lovely =)  The following day, I went to Tinkers with a couple of friends.  A lot of people didn't show up, but everything turned out great.  It was a very relaxing evening, and I couldn't ask for anything more.

In other news , this past week has been stressful due to writing papers and performing in my choir concerts.  We performed on Saturday night at St. Paul the Apostle Church in Manhattan.  It was such a beautiful concert.  The following day, we had our second performance at the University Church.  That, too, was a success.  Our choir instructor can't be any more proud of us =)  It's funny cause we only had 5 days to practice.

Besides that, I don't have major plans for this weekend.  I'm gonna go home on Friday to pick up my new state  ID =D  Then, my sister and I are gonna hit up Central Ave. so I can buy a new winter coat.  I'm in desperate need of a new one.  I hope to hang out with Erin once we get back.  I haven't seen that sexy son of a bitch since the summer.  It's about time she and I hang out =P  I also have to write two papers--one for Age of Rembrandt; one for Bismarck's Germany.  I'm definitely looking forward to that =P  Gonzo is home, so I hope we can possibly make plans to hang out at some point.  If not, I have time to see him cause he'll be home for a month.  Well, that's all I gotta share for now.  Auf wiedersehen!!"

"event","I can't believe it's a Saturday night, and I'm sitting in my room.  I thought tonight was the Man vs. Machine show at the Prep, so I walked all the way over there to find the building completely empty and dark.  I called my roommate to see what was up...turns out I went two weeks early!  As I was walking back to O'Hare, I bumped into two friends, then made my way back to my dorm.  My roommate and her boyfriend were watching something, so I decided to lay on my bed for awhile.  I tried to take a nap, but I couldn't sleep.  However, I wound up falling asleep by 9, and I woke up around 12:25.  What the hell?  I was expecting 3 different calls from 3 different people.  Oy vey... 

I suppose it's okay considering I went out last night.  I bumped into that kid Joe two times throughout the course of the night.  The first was outside my dorm, and the second was outside a bar.  I decided to go to Mugz's with my friend Ernesto and his cousin.  We were hanging out in the congested bar for awhile, but then I needed to step outside because I felt like I was going to pass out.  Once I got to the doorway, Joe was standing there.  He extended his hand, and I reluctantly took it so he could help me step out.  He told me to take a seat, but I really didn't want to.  So, I eventually cut right to the chase, and confronted him about everything.  As he was trying to explain himself, some guy started to pick a fight with the bouncer.  So Joe was forced to get involved.  I was getting pissed off because he had to deal with everyone else's problems, and simply forgot about his own.  He could tell I was getting upset, and he came over and apologized.  We continued talking, but people were constantly interrupting us.  He wound up telling me some rather personal things about himself, and I eventually put my guard down.  I felt horrible finding out some of the things he's been going through.  However, that doesn't excuse the fact that he truly disrespected me.  In the end, he did apologize to me, and we need to continue having this conversation because I feel we need to tie up some loose ends.  Hopefully we'll reach some sort of a resolution."

"event","I have to describe this dream I had while taking a nap a few hours ago.  I woke up sweating because it was that intense.  Again, THIS WAS ONLY A DREAM!

Here it goes: My roommate and I were in the room, and then we decided to go to my friend's room (I won't use his real name while describing the dream, so I'll substitute it with ""Ted"").  We went to Ted's room because I needed to do something.  Now, Ted is a straightforward guy, and he can say things that may offend or make people feel uncomfortable.  The whole time we were there, Ted and I started play fighting, then he pinned me to his bed, and he started to kiss me.  My roommate made it clear that she wanted to leave, so she stepped outside, and waited for me in the hallway.  I pushed Ted off of me so I could tell my roomie that she could head back to the room without me.  When I went back inside, he and I started making out rather intensely.  He soon started to take off his shorts and said, ""Go over there and take one out of the box.""  Then I said, ""Take what?""  He replied, ""A condom.""  Then I said, ""As tempting as it is to do this with you, I just can't.""  Then he looked at me and said, ""It's okay.""  We continued making out, but then I got a call from my grandma.  She mentioned that my Aunt Laura was gonna be around during the day, and she wanted to take me to the doctors with her.  In the dream, my grandma said she lived 2 blocks away and wanted to cover my medical expenses.  I thought it over, but truthfully  didn't want to go.  Once I got off the phone, Ted went into his fridge, and knocked over a beer.  Then he put it aside, shook the beer off his hand, then put a piece of French candy in his mouth.  He wanted me to try it, so he leaned in, and passed the candy to me with his mouth, and started to kiss again.  As we were laying in his bed, I looked across the room, and noticed that my sister sitting on an air mattress!  I began to freak out and rushed to put my clothes on.  Then she said, ""I've been sitting here the entire time.  I can't believe you guys didn't even realize.  Anyway, don't worry about it; I don't think you're a slut.  I'm not judging you.  You're my sister and I love you.""  In the mean time, Ted grabbed his cigarettes and went outside.  Before I left the room, I took a glance in his mirror, and noticed how pale I was.  Then I took a look at my hair, and realized that my hair line was receding.  Upon seeing this, I ran out of the room, and walked down the hall to go back to my dorm.  Now, the hallway didn't look like a normal hallway.  In fact, it looked like the walkways at Cross County.  As I was walking, I saw a lot of people dressed up in mascot uniforms, each representing different schools.  I assumed that there was a tournament of some sort being held at my school.  As I got closer to my room, I noticed Ted walking back.  He finished talking to some girl, and it appeared he gave her a kiss on the cheek.  I was a little pissed off, but more concerned about my complexion.  He came over to me and asked where I was going.  I told him I was going back to my room, but I'd hang out with him again later.  My sister walked past me, and I started to feel overcome with emotion, so I buried my face in Ted's chest and he held me for a moment.  Then he said, ""Hey, everything is okay.  I'll see you later.""  Once I got to my room, I noticed it was much bigger and was decorated with lots of candles and streamers.  As I walked further in, Joe (my roommate's boyfriend) came from the living room and said, ""Where the heck have you been?  Erin will be here any minute.  It's her birthday!  Her parents are waiting in the kitchen.""  I walked over to the kitchen to say hello, then went into the dining room and saw a bunch of birthday gifts on the table.  While standing there, I scratched my head, and chunks of hair came out.  I started to panic.  Just as this began to happen, Erin came out and said, ""Hey!  I know about the surprise party.  Joe didn't want to tell you because he didn't want to make you upset.  I've been in the other room the entire time.""  I didn't give a damn about the party at that point because I was so upset about losing my hair.  I started to cry, and brushed another chunk of hair out of my scalp and said, ""It's because of the chemo!  It's because of the chemo!  Erin, I didn't want to tell you, but I have lung cancer!  The chemo is making me this way!""  Then she said, ""Oh, don't worry.  I dated some guy named Anthony before Joe and I started dating.  He was sick, too.  But if it wasn't for him getting sick and dying, Joe and I never would've been together.""  Then this girl Alana walked in, and told me a similar story.  Meanwhile, their stories were only making me more upset, and I started to panic to the point in which I couldn't breathe.  I felt so ashamed and alone, and thought I was going to die right there. 

Then I woke up...

That was one of the most intense dreams I've ever had in my life.  I felt so uneasy upon waking up.  I had to go downstairs, hang out with my friend, and get my mind off of it.  I just came back a little while ago.  He asked me if I was alright, and I told him no.  He told me to calm down and relax.  So, I sat at his desk and tried not to think about it.  Then his roommate suggested having a group hug, but that didn't happen lol.  We went to the midnight breakfast instead, and had pancakes and what not.  Since then, I've calmed down and now I'm trying to concentrate on doing my homework.

These past 2 days have been quite difficult.  I guess the dream was the culmination of the stress I've been dealing with since my great grandmother's death.  The lung cancer comes into play because my mom has been battling it for close to a year now.  My grandma, sister, and aunt were involved because I've been surrounded by family for the past 48 hours.  I suppose ""Ted"" was present because we spend a decent amount of time together, and I've talked about him while at home.  

I just want to go back to sleep, but I'm scared I may have more dreams like that.  Le sigh..."

"event","A remarkable woman is no longer with us.  My great grandmother, Nanny, lived a long, healthy life.  She was born on December 20, 1913, the first child of an Italian family of immigrants.  When growing up, she learned Italian and English to help her family adjust to American life.  Her father died when she was young, and she had to help her mother raise her younger brothers and sisters.  She later married, and had 4 children of her own--James, Phyllis, Marie, and Salvatore.  

Growing up, I considered Nanny my third mother--my first two were my mom and my grandma.  Being my father wasn't around much, these three women raised my sister, my brother, and myself.  I'll never forget the countless times Nanny would babysit us, and we'd play cards for hours on end.  I'll never forget the weekends when I slept over my grandma's house, and made ""deliveries"" to Nanny after my grandfather went grocery shopping.  She'd always give me the change she had on her bureau as a tip.  I'll never forget the times she used to dance around in her pjs and slippers (a woman in her late 80s, then) doing the Charleston!  I'll never forget how she adored Frank Sinatra, and would sing parts of his songs from time to time.  I'll never forget the stories she used to tell, and how she made sure she watched the local news every night.  I'll never forget how I'd sit next to her at the table every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  She'd sit on my left, and I'd help her cut her food from time to time.  As gross as this may sound, I'll never forget the way she used to play with her dentures.  As a child, I used to hear her clicking something in her mouth, then I once saw her teeth come out ever so slightly!  I was so scared because I didn't realize that she had false teeth lol.  I'll also never forget the times she'd help me with the annual Penny Pool (if you went to Victory, you'd know what I'm talking about).  She'd collect so many pennies every year, and donate them to the cause.  I'll also never forget how she'd always have to stand in the front when we took family pictures because she was the shortest out of everyone.  She was a cute, little, old lady that everyone adored.  I'll never forget how she'd wait by the door until we came home.  She'd stand there for ten minutes or so, go into another room, then stand by the door again.  I'll never forget how religious she was.  She'd pray every day, and make references to Mother Cabrini (her favorite saint) all of the time.  She'd even give my  family members religious tokens and trinkets all of the time--signs of her love and affection, and symbols to remember her by.  I have all of the small statues she gave me on top of a shelf in my room.  I will never part with them because they mean so much to me.  

She was in a nursing home for a little over a year.  Weeks prior to getting sick, I noticed a change in her attitude, and it often times made me upset.  One of the most upsetting conversations I've ever had was days prior to moving to school.  She claimed that she felt like she was withering away, and didn't want to continue living anymore.  I suppose all of the stress my grandmother gave her was getting to her, and it was finally wearing her down.  Keep in mind, she was 92 at the time, and healthy as an ox.  She never got sick, and wasn't plagued by any life altering illnesses.  Days later, I'll never forget saying goodbye to her as I was moving to Fordham.  She was standing at the doorway crying hysterically, and it broke my heart.  I told her I would be home soon, and that I'd see her in no time.  Unfortunately, the next time I saw her was about a month later, not at home, but in the nursing home.  She barely recognized me, and she didn't look like herself.  Her hair was white--it no longer consisted of the light brown dye job she used to get every couple of weeks.  She wasn't walking around, but was bedridden, and she barely made sense when she spoke.  Nanny had such a sharp mind before she got sick and was emitted to the nursing home.  She could tell you things from her childhood, that most people would expect she'd forget.  I couldn't bare to see her laying in that bed, and I chose not to see her anymore.  I'd always ask my family how she was doing whenever I'd call home, and unfortunately, the news was always the same--she barely made much progress.  I'd never hear that she was doing better with the possibility of her coming home, where she belonged.  

The last time I saw her was over the summer.  I decided to be strong, and see her.  She was laying in her bed, and claimed to be very cold (despite how warm it was outside).  I held her hand as my dad and grandma tried to give her water and make her feel comfortable.  She didn't make too much sense when she was talking, but I did hear her say she was ""shaking like a leaf"" and said my mom's name, Debbie, on numerous occasions.  I had a feeling that was going to be the last time I would see her, so I made sure I told her I love her.  I was almost overcome with emotion, but I held it back.  

I received a call from my mother this morning explaining how and when Nanny died.  It apparently happened yesterday, but my mom wanted to wait until today to tell me because she knew I was busy at the museum yesterday.  I wish I was told as soon as possible because I've always been concerned with my Nanny's health.  I'm not sure what the arrangements will be this week, but I know it's going to be a rough few days.  

Nanny, I'll always love you.  You've lived a long, strong life, and you've done so much to make so many people happy.  We'll never forget you.  Rest in peace.  12/20/1913-11/09/2007."

"event","I think it's about time I write a lengthly entry...it's been awhile.

Ever since midterms, I can't seem to buckle down and concentrate on my work.  I'm so behind with my reading, and I don't know how I'm going to catch up.  However, I will admit that I'm busting my ass in German, and my teacher has been noticing.  I'm also very tired, and all I want to do is sleep.  I think I should start taking vitamins or something.  Ugh...

My birthday is coming up, and I have yet to decide on what I would like to do.  Last year was a complete disaster, and I want this one to be top notch.  Being most people will be home for Thanksgiving, I think I want to get my friends from high school together, and go out to dinner at a local Italian restaurant.  We went to Little Italy last year, but that was rather pricey.  I'm thinking of going to Dom and Vinny's cause it's local and inexpensive.  However, I don't know what to do after dinner.  I'll figure it out in due time.  I'd also like to have a big get together with my friends from school.  I suppose we'll go out to one of the bars in the area or something.  I'll take the planning one day at a time.

My last entry was rather vague, but I'm sure you can figure out who I'm talking about.  I've been thinking about him a lot lately.  I suppose it's because I haven't talked to him since the last time we saw each other (which was in August).  I just hope he's safe and that he is doing well.  I wish I had a way to contact him, seeing he doesn't have phone or internet service.  He was supposed to give me his address before he went to boot camp, but he never did.  It would be comforting to receive some sort of information about his safety and whereabouts.  

Well, I'm gonna go to lunch, then come back to my room and work on some more German homework.  I'll try to update again real soon."

My teacher returned our papers today (in Bismarck's Germany), and I got an A-!  I'm so excited =)  I honestly thought I was going to get a C on it, considering I wrote it the night before.  Heck, I woke up at 5:30am to finish it =P  I suppose I should stop underestimating myself.  The Frau plans on returning our German midterms today.  I'm a little worried about that one, considering I barely understand the language.  Eh...I suppose I'll have to wait and see.

Tonight is the President's Ball.  I'm looking forward to it, but I'm not as excited about it for some reason.  In the past, I would count down the days.  I guess it's because a majority of my friends aren't planning on going this year.  Regardless, I'm sure I'll have a good time.  I may hang out with a few of my girlfriends before hand, and we will probably walk over to McGinley together.  The weather is putting a damper on it, as well.  It's supposed to rain heavily this evening.  I really don't want to walk through the rain and feel gross before I get there.

Speaking of rain, it's supposed to rain tomorrow.  I have plans to go to Six Flags.  I have a funny feeling that it's going to be canceled.  I hope I'll get my money back if it is.  Bahumbug.  

Well, it's time for my lunch break, then off to German class.  Ciao ciao!!"

"event","Why do I even bother?  After a month of waiting for an apology from Joe, he finally contacted me.  He and I were supposed to meet up this evening to grab dinner, and of course, the jackass stood me up...again.  I didn't bother to call him cause it would've been a waste of my breath.  I don't understand why he expresses how badly he needs to talk to me and apologize, then does the complete opposite by ignoring me.  I simply want an apology and an explanation as to why he acted the way he did.  He started to express things to me at 5:30 this morning, but I really wanted to hold off on the conversation until we met in person.  

It's a shame because I never expected this type of behavior from Joe.  It's funny cause last night, he tried to explain that he's ""not that type of a guy.""  In response, I told him I didn't think he was, but his actions revealed that he isn't better than any jerk out there.  If and when I do speak to him, I'm not looking for rekindle anything with him.  I simply want an apology, and he'll be lucky if I even reconsider a friendship with him."

"event","I should be working on homework right now, but I'm taking a break.  I've been working on a German paper for a few hours.  I wanted to do further research on a movie we watched in class before I began writing the summary in English.  I just finished that, now I have to translate it into German.  That's going to be a lot of fun =P.  I'm sure it's going to be pure crap, mostly because I'm not sending it to my tutor.  When he looks over my papers, he corrects them too much, and then it doesn't look like my own work.  I can't afford to get another paper back without a grade.  ::le sigh::

I wish I got more work done this weekend.  I went home Friday night, came back, and hung out with my roommate and her boyfriend.  I woke up before noon on Saturday, and just hung around the room.  I went out with my friend Joe Pesci later that night and got drunk.  We went to Tinkers for a few hours, hung out with some freshman, played pool, and talked to some old guys. I laughed, I cried, and I got extremely angry when I saw a certain asshole sitting at the bar.  Then I calmed down, hung out with some of my gay friends, listened to the Allman Brothers, then went to Pugsley's.  After having some amazing pizza, I went back to O'Hare to call it a night.  However, upon going to bed, I received a call from Anthony and Cody, and was forced out of my room to hang out on Eddie's.  We sat in the grass and tried our best to avoid sprinklers and skunks lol.  The two boys then had to break up a fist fight on a few occasions.  We wound up hanging out until 6:15, then called it a night lol.  When I walked back into my building, I found some kid sleeping on a bench in the nook of the lobby lol. It was so funny, I took a picture of it.  You can check it out on Facebook =P

I woke up at ten to 2 yesterday afternoon, did laundry, and attempted homework.  However, I got caught up in watching the Rock of Love marathon on VH1.  I love that show lol.  I stayed in, despite being invited out to Tinkers.  I didn't feel like spending any more money this weekend.  Heck, if I really want to drink, I have a bottle of Jack chilling in my room =P  

So, here I am...in the library doing homework.  I should probably get cracking with some reading.  Well, it was lovely updating.  I'll keep ya'll posted with my crazy life real soon =P"

"event","This week was pure hell.  It started to go awry on Saturday.  Joe and I were supposed to go to the Mets game, however, he stood me up.  In fact, I haven't heard from him since last Thursday.  I don't understand how he has the nerve to do this despite telling me how much he likes me and what not.  This is quite unfortunate because I told him how I've been done wrong so many times, and I'm tired of it.

Things didn't get any better on Wednesday.  I received a paper back from my German teacher, and she didn't give me a grade.  She doesn't think I wrote it.  I've been trying to meet with her to explain the situation--I wrote the paper in English, then translated it into German.  I sent it to my tutor so he can look it over, and make corrections if necessary.  I merely glanced at it when he sent it back because I needed to fix up the spelling of a few words.  I would never ever hand in someone else's work.  She's been my instructor for 5 semesters now.  I feel she should know me better than that.  It sucks because I thought I was in the right by taking my work to my tutor.  However, seeking his help only screwed me over because my original work now looks like someone else's.  

Besides that, last night was an odd evening.  I was doing homework and chatting with the roomie.  Then I went down stairs to have a couple of drinks with a friend.  We hung out in his room for quite some time, went outside for a cigarette, then went up to my room to do some homework.  I don't know why we drink if we know we have work to get done!  We wound up getting sidetracked, and failed to accomplish anything.  I don't know what time he left, but he wound up leaving his notebook behind.  I woke up early this morning feeling like complete crap.  I hopped into the shower, and nearly lost an earring in the drain--thank God I didn't, cause my great grandmother gave them to me before she went into the nursing home.  I wanted to go downstairs and get breakfast, but then I realized I lost my student ID!  I started to freak out.  I searched the entire building, and even stopped at my friend's room to return his book and see if I left if there.  Unfortunately, it was nowhere to be found.  I had a limited amount of time cause I had to get to class at 9:30.  I went, but didn't feel so well.  Afterwards, I went straight to work, then went down to Lincoln Center to drop off some documents at the History department.  By the time I got back, it was 1:20, and German class was starting in a matter of 10 minutes.  I decided not to go cause finding the ID was my primary concern (if in the event I had to get a new one, I'd have to get it before 5pm today because the office is closed on weekends).  I searched my entire room, and finally found it under my bed!  Soon after, I went to work at 2:30, and here I am!  I don't have anything to do at the moment, so I figured I'd update.  I still feel like crap, but at least I don't feel like I have to puke anymore.  Ja wohl..."

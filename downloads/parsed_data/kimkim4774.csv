"event","hola today was just a regular day. minus the marching band : ( i'm so sad its over. we got a 89.25 which was the highest in centurys history at acc's and guard got a 17.4 i think which is the highest century guard has ever gotton!!! but now its over and the more i talk about band the more i want to start crying again because its over. indoor starts soon but it wont be the same since its just the guard. the drama level in my life will probably severly go up unfortuatly and dont think my wife is going to be there for me since her mom isnt gonna let her join. anyways got home and watched oprah and practiced for all county try outs which i have yet to do all year so i'm probably gonna get last chair.... or just not make it at all. oh well i've stopped caring about cello as much and moved on to guard....it just isnt as fun as it used to be....."

"event","okay so i know i just updated like i dunno 10 minutes ago but i'm totally bored so i figured that i'd takea ""what should you wear on the first day of school?"" test in the latest issue of cosmogirl and share the results with you all since i have nothing better to do.ok you''re favorite summer movie:fantastic four or dukes of hazard..well i havent seen either but i'll go with dukes of hazard.you're favorite pick me up drink:red bull sugarfree or dunkin donuts iced carmel swirl lattee....definitely the latte. you love a guy who can play:guitar or football...well i guess ideally both but i'd prefer guitar. the first thing to go into your locker...a magnetic mirror or an inspirational qoute...uh as much as i hate to say it probably the mirror. ok that means i am a glamazon..whatever that means. its says ""a style superstar like you knows how to get started on the right foot!"" okay not horrible but now i'm gonna go check my email..byebye."

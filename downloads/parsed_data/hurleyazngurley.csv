"event","so i know its been a while since i last really updated...theres a lot going on in my life right now. sometimes i hinder myself from typing out EVERYTHING i truly feel because of the fact there are actually people that's going to read this as opposed to a journal or a diary which is private and kept secret. but right now, i feel like pouring my heart out. first, id like to say how freaking great this summer has been. id say its the best summer yet! from the best spring break, to the best summer ever...i know if i had the chance to do it again, id never ask for it any different. however, time is going by really fast...i feel like the time left i have with tony is coming down to a real close end...i mean only because he's going to college soon...i even went appartment shopping with him and theyve officially moved in. at the same time, im happy for him you know? but deep down, i really dont want him to leave. i wish he could stay here with me instead of having to move out far away from where he's always lived...far away from the beach and the nice weather...all the way to pomona...but of course im happy for him, and excited for him and he did promise to come see me whenever he gets the chance to. im not too worried about the distance...its an hour away, and of course i understand that he's going to be in college and he's going to be spending a lot of time in class, plus working...but i can do the whole distance thing. i said that everytime id be waiting for him to come back to me would be completely worth the wait. after seeing him then days without seeing him would just make the next visit so much more worthwhile. the one thing im really just concerned about is how much i hope he doesnt find another girl there...a better girl who he has interests with and someone he can relate to better...a girl that can be there for him because they'll be both in the same area...and you know? all that stuff that im really scared of...because i've fallen so deep for him at this point...he doesnt know how much and telling him through words isnt enough to express how i really feel. he and i have just grown to be really close and he understands me and supporting me and everything i could ask for. HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE ME LAUGH LIKE IVE NEVER LAUGHED BEFORE. im SO happy with him...even if there are times we fight and i cry, all those times seem so insignificant to me. our fights just make us stronger. and closer. because i never like fighting with him, and i dont believe he likes fighting with me, so i figure that our fights are one of the best things that could happen to our relationship because it would only want us to become better to each other, to make sure things like that dont happen again and we make up. i love making up...after a day of not feeling his kiss or holding his hand or just seeing him smile...its the best feeling ever to be able to come back to that. its not that i dont trust him either, being so far away from me and all that. im not afraid of the fact that he's going to cheat on me or whatever because...our relationship is deeper than that. i trust him. i just...dont want him to leave...gosh he's not even the only one to go...a lot of the other friends ive met and have had to chance to become close with are leaving to go to college too...i just feel like time is seriously going at ultra top speed and no one can slow it down or change it and its making everyone go away. i wish this summer wouldnt have to come to an end. but, like we all know, summer will eventually become fall...and everyone goes their seprate ways. right now, or i mean, this time i have left until he goes to school...u know, ive just been enjoying with him :) I LOVE being with HIM. i just hope he misses me when he's gone. but for the mean time i know ill just make the best of the time i still have left with him. i love him so much...<3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333"

im so effing glad today is finally over.

for another.
i wish it never came.

so, lately i, ((as well as everyone else who took freaking APs this past week had been stressing out about tests and what not)) have just been a total wreck. ugh. seriously time went by so fast. to think that in the beginning of the school year, ferron JUST told us about may 6th and how thats the day of our AP test and now its freaking over. i wish i could get a second chance at somethings thats happened this past month regarding school stuff. ugh. but im so over it. i AM glad that today's done with. we were so nervous...i remember going to bed last night and the last thing i thought about was APs, i had a dream about taking my AP test, i woke up saying ""paris is worth a mass"" -_- ((haha if ur in euro...you'd get it...lol)) the test was at 1 but before then we all kinda just reviewed and stuff...getting even more nervous about it. i seriously felt like puking at one point. then we had lunch. pizza...and soda? lol. yayuh. good stuff. we didnt finish until like 5:30...then finally got out of that hell hole. 

then...tony, mark and kevin picked me up in mark's TIGHT WHIP!!! hahaha damn. nice car, fool <333 drove over to starbucks where tony's car was...swithed rides...then went to the homie rob's house to pick him up and then we all went over to my house to play pool. i totally owned those bitches ass today. beat every single one of them in a row. DAMN STRAIGHT! haha. the only time i lost was the last game me and kev played again coz i totally had a brain fart and thought i was supposed to sink my 8 ball in a different pocket. i woulda won that shit anyway. haha

after that...around 7:30 ish, we headed over to the liquor store...bought stuff? went over to tony's and met up with james, tomo and ken. poker night, baby! tony and i played in teams against everyone and we totally were winning at one point but got kinda loose at the end...oh well. kevin end up owning everyone towards the end of the night. 60 bucks in the pot. haha

so yah...thats pretty much my whole day...home right now about to crash coz im really tired...tomorrow should be good. hang out with jill and everyone else in the afternoon, then party at night! its about tiiiiiiiiime!! ((finally))

"event","i find it quite difficult to religiously keep up with blogging every night or at least every other day. but right now, im doing my best to find the time to do so. plus, i just feel like avoiding homework which i know for sure is the last thing i should be doing. but whatever. what can u do?

so today was pretty fun.

<b>late start</b>
for once, in a cool while. went to breakfast with tony <3. met him at louis' coz i had to take my sister to school since she didnt have a late start, and end up having to finish my english homework there coz i totally disregarded the study guide questions i was assigned to have done by today. i got pretty much all of it done though. anyway, we ordered the ""louis special"" i think? and it was incredibly delicious!! a bombass omlet, with sausage, hashbrown and toast. aw man. good stuff. we had to eat kind of fast though coz our schedule was to leave byh 8:30 ish, just enough time to pick up james and go to school. then we found out we had to pick up another friend of ours on the way and we thought we were gonna be late but turns out we made it to school in 10 minutes, compliments to tony's <3 hawt driving skills. haha. 

so school went by pretty slow, as usual. but it was alright i guess. felt kinda tired by 4th period, which always happens for some reason. i always get really sleepy around noon ish. maybe its because of my whack ass sleep pattern. then lunch came around...it was a really chill afternoon...finally after a couple more periods school was over...headed over to the library with nicole and nina and we did some homework and studied...we hadda kill time before the AP review session which was at 6. we end up going to la salsa too, and just brining our food to the review session. went by pretty fast, actually. and we finished right on time too. after that, i went over to taco bell to get my baby something to eat since i knew he was working till closing, all by himself today so no one could cover for him when he got hungry. and i felt bad, so i decided to surprise him :) plus it was another excuse to just see him since we weren't going to be able to see each other again until tomorrow.

::SIGH::
i cant get enough of that guy. i always get butterflies just thinking about him :) awwwwwwww i miss him <3. hehe

well, i have other things to say but im kinda running out of time, so ill post again, later. 
thats it for now.

"event","ok. here goes. 

so this is my first real blog entry where i'll be filling you in on my day and things i felt and remembered. it started off pretty fast to tell you the truth. but that may just be because of the fact that i woke up late this morning and had to rush my ass to get ready and be out of the house by 7:20 am. so i woke up. did all the morning stuff, ran outta the house by 7:25. a bit late. traffic's a bitch when you're not on the dot. anyway, i get to school and im supposed to meet tony <3 at the stairs before he has to go to class. i get there but he's not there yet...=\ so i walked to my locker to put stuff away and walked back and we ran into each other. :) lol. 

aww i missed him. 
::GETS BUTTERFLIES:: 
haha that happens everytime i think of that guy. 
::dreamy sigh!!::

 ^_^ 

ANYWAY!! hahaha he had to go to class, and i went on to the gym...ran 2 freaking miles again today. ughhhh this whole PE thing is getting really old. i CANNOT wait until the quarter ends and i get to switch back to tennis because freaking PE is such a pain. but we get to swim on friday? free day. i think thats what Shaw said. so whatever. anyway yah...went back into the gym at 9, played around with stupid badminton stuff. i hate that sport. its not even worthy enough to be called a sport. 

-_- ((no offense)) 

finally the period was OVER. went back to the locker rooms to change and what not. met up with tony <3 at my locker and hung out at snack at the spot with everybody else. thennnnnn my lover walked me to 3rd period, kind of coz we left kinda late and he had to get to class on time too. so we seperated at the bottom of the stairs. 3rd period was real lame though coz we were talking about this stupid book called tale of two cities and i didnt get to finish reading all the chapters i had to get to and i was SO freaking clueless. luckily i had sparknotes :) hahahaha but yah. lame ass. that class went by REALLY slow. tony invited me to go to out to lunch today, but we end up not going coz the other ppl we were supposed to go with decided to change their minds. no big deal. plus i woulda started hyperventilating again. hahaha maybe not. but yah. i end up getting a salad but for some reason it tasted a lot more boring than usual. so it wasnt all that great. gave the rest to tony <3. 

so we all just pretty much hung out all lunch and talked and everything. towards the end though tony and i went to the office coz i had to make an appointment to see my EA. uggggghhhhhh schoooooool. -_- what an effing pain! >_< ANYWAY!! hadda go to 5th...tony <3 walked me to class and french was pretty boring too. i hate all this stuff we're learning right now, its so freaking hard. i have so much homework these days. 

but whatever, next subject.

so afterschool i met up with my tony <3 and we went to mr. lucky's with james, rob, and christy. played some pool for a bit, hung out and what not. good stuff. i havent played pool in a while tho so i was kinda... BLAH. but its ok. haha now i owe james 5 freaking dollars. but he owes me 3. haha after that we went to 7 11 to get some food...and thats when things got kinda weird...

for some reason i felt there was a lot of tension between me and tony...like...when i got back into the car and he was gonna take me home...iono something seemed wrong...=\ i cant really put my finger on it though...but we weren't even talking...usually we'd hold hands while he's driving...or kiss at the red lights...but for some reason like...i dont know. we just weren't. i asked him what was wrong and stuff and he said nothing, and he was fine. but i didnt believe him...not really. i just know something's up. i might be wrong but then why were things so weird?? omg i seriously started crying right when i got outta the car...went home and called up james after a bit...=\ uggggghhhhhh. i just wish i knew whats up...im so sad because of it...

anyway...i think im gonna go for now, i still have things to finish up with...so ill blog again later. keep u guys posted on everything. 

so yah. stay up, guys.

non stop till i think
ive said 
every thing 
every word 
i feel
they were right.
time does heal.
and here am
not shedding one tear
but instead,
holding your hand...
trying to look pass all the bad things that 
seem to make myself upset
but with you i always seem to forget
about the times i felt hurt
times when i thought he was a real jerk
coz now that you've come along
it seems like things are better
so warm inside, dont even need to wear a sweater. (haha)
when im with you
i just feel so comfortable
not worried about ever feeling i might be too vulnerable
just, care free.
letting you take me to the places i longed to be
back to where i can fall
fall back to the things, ill give you my all.
fall back without a thing to hold
and just let love unfold.
so i know i told you we'll take it slow 
day by day
just going the flow, as we go
but trust me.
when i know its right 
it'll be you and me, baby
ill be your girl
you'll be the one ill dance with
as you hold my hand and watch me twirl...
and thank you.
for understanding the things i say
for letting it go my way
just give it time.
just enough time for you to finish readin my rhyme
by the end of this
i hope you'll understand the real true bliss
that you give,
one of the things im enjoying
these past few days that i live
knowing you're by my side
no longer do i need to hide from feeling again
now i let myself go when
you kiss my lips
hold my hips
grasping my hand so tight
we're locked fingertips to fingertips.
and i know
the last thing i wanna do is let go
coz with you i feel new
wanna start a new chapter in my life
with you."

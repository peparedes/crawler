i feel my life... slowly coming to an end... but it takes so long...
i feel this pain... within my soul... like someone stole my life...
i feel my heart beeting faster and faster as i fall to the ground...
i feel the rush of this gay ass life... pounding in my face...
i want to leave... i want to die... i want to go away!!! 
someone take my life from me... i no longer want to stay!!!"

"event","well today was a fun filled day with some close calls. i was with kim , joe and nick and we were driving around and i needed kim to hold the wheel for me and so she did but then she started to tell a story and forgot she was holding the wheel and we almost crashed into like a mail box and a telephone pole. it was wicked frickin scary. then further into our trip we were coming to the end of a road and when we got to the end of it there was cops and flashing lights every where because there was a huge accident. and i am not going to lie i was scared shitless. then when i was with courtney we were driving and a dog ran in front of my car again .....twice actually. and yesterday a dog did the same thing . i think that i have bad luck when i am driving."

"event","well it has been a while since i have made an entry but whatever. today i came to the conclusion that i am a complete slacker, because i found all of my college applications when i was cleaning my room and none of them are filled out. which is pretty lame so i really need to do something about that. on the other hand we are leaving for florida in on week from today. i guess i am kinda excited, but not really but i think once i get there and stuff i will be wicked pumped. and plus i will be with some of my good friends that i really dont get a chance to hang out with that often. but i will miss my friends that arent going....aaron , tom , derek, courtney :(  .ya know what when we get back from florida it is going to be the end of february.... that means only have march, april (w/ vacation) and most of may until we graduate that is wicked frickin scary to think about , cuz it is all happening way to fast , and we have prom and shit. this is wicked lame but dont get me wrong or any thing i wanna get out of high school and stuff but i dont know what i am going to do when i am actually done. well there is college and shit but i dont know it sucks cuz it is confusing but there is nothing you can do you can only go with the flow and try to make some thing of what you are doing. growing up kinda sucks in some ways"

"event","<P>sweet today is a snow day... hurray! so i got up and got ready for school today, then my mom calls saying that i have no school and that she forgot to tell me.... i was wicked pumped. lol i wasnt the only one who didnt know that we didnt have school. sweet so i have been thinking a lot lately, and i hate it cuz&nbsp; it always seems like i only see they negitive side of things, and then i get all like paranoid and shit.i was reading someones journal and they were talking about where we are going to be in like a year or something and i started to think about where am i going to go to college , am i even going to get into college, am i going to see my friends any more. its stupid shit like this that makes me want to forget about every thing and just go back in time to the summer. that was the best time ever!!! and i will never forget those times, every thing just seemed perfect, i&nbsp;spent my summer with the people that mean the most to me doing whatever we felt like doing....&nbsp;i saw this in someones journal and it is so true: the reason why people hold onto memories for so long is because memories are the only things that dont change when every thing else does.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

"event","well my weekend went well so far, i am sad that it is almost over though.on friday i hung out with kim and danielle at danielle's , plus who ever else was there. it was a good time:) but  kim and i had to leave kinda early because we had to get some sleep cuz we had the SATS the next day. so the SATS sucked my balls. kim derek and i made fun of all the groton kids... i am pretty sure they made fun of us too but whatever... the test was long and boring but there is nothing you can do about that. then afterwords derek and i hung out and tom came and then we went to kims and we had fun there. but then she had to go to work so the boys and i went with tom to get his eyebrow pierced. and then we just went to my house and chilled until kim got out but then it started snow wicked bad so my mom wouldnt let any of us leave at all so we just stayed at my house and watched a movie and shit. we missed out on a good time at kims though:( but derek and i both fell asleep @ like 8:30 or 9 cuz we couldnt go out. then today at work it was so fricken dead @ the store it wasnt even funny. the store was open three hours before the first customer came, to buy a paper, who does that, whatever. and right now i am @ home, i just got done shoveling out the driveway and i am going to go out for the day or for a while with aaron. it will be fun. i wished that it wold have snowed mostly today instead of yesterday cuz we wouldnt of had school. whatever"

"event","well i dont know, things lately have been really weird, and i dont know how to explain it. i have hung out with a few different people than i normally do, like i hang out with danielle a lot and ryan, but thats not a bad thing. but i really miss hanging out with my ""old"" friends. it sucks because i havent hung out with them in a while and it bothers me because they mean so much to me, they are a huge part in my life. and i have tried to hang out with them but it just never works out, and i dont know what to do. it seems like things lately have been wicked stressful and shitty. i have the SATS coming up tomorrow, i have college things to do , essays to write, classes to pass and a bunch of other things. i think i need to get things straightened out... i know that sounds lame because many other people have said that and they never do , but i really think i need to just let tings lay low and let them fall into place, cuz that is really the only thing i can do. and about my friends, i guess i just have to try harder to make things work so we all can hang out again... like the old days....like the summer."

"event","why do people have emotions? like seriously, they suck wicked bad. i swear to god there is no good emotions. there are emotions of anger and hate, which are bad emotions. love is a bad emotion, because love hurts, i mean you seem like you are happy and every thing is good but then you just end up getting hurt. so really why do we have them. you can never win.... can you. dude fuck emotions. so i am going to go from being all like sad and shit to happy. but whatever. i just want to thank a few of my friends... thanks for always being there for me and shit. i am glad to know that i will always have someone to trust and to talk to. you guys always make a good situation out of a bad one, and you all ways know the right things to say, you guys are amazing."

"event","to start this entry off, here is part of a conversation with one of my friends......

If you took the $160,000 you would spend on college and spent it on condoms ($.83 each), you could have sex 132 times a day, or 5.5 times an hour.  If that sounds excessive, you could have sex 3 times a day, buy a keg per day (for entertainment), a Cadillac Escalade, and still have $11.85 left over for weed every day for 4 years...what the hell are we doing here???????  

that would be wicked amazing!!
 anyways i went out with ms. kim today. we were having a good time. we went to the mall and just shopped for a little while.  i bought earings and kim bought nose rings.  then we came home cuz we were tired and it was only like 7:45pm. but whatever. i also hung out with sam  today, we just sat at my house and watched mean girls and ate ice cream, that was fun too.

so i guess the roads were bad today. we shouldnt of had school today, even though the roads werent bad in the morning. but one of my friends had a close call with some trees, and i was scared shit-less when he called to tell me , but i am glad everyone is ok though. but yeah i am ready to pass out, so i think i will.later"

"event","<P>well today was wicked boring and sucky, what else is new. so i went to the hell hole&nbsp; people call school, then tom and i left school early.lol tom was freaking out he thought that we were going to get cought.... what a loser. anyways then i went to work, i had to work 3-6. it is such a short shift but it seemed like it was never ending. i am not going to lie, i was about to hurt myself, then i came home thinking i was going to hang out with someone, but that didnt happen. so i called up other people and they were being lame and praticing for a concert and ohters were doing homework... come on who does homework... jk i give credit to anyone who does their homework. so i ended up sitting at home doing nothing, and it sucked wicked bad. but what can you do? i ended up talking to kim on the phone for like 45 minutes, which was wicked nice</P>
<P>well yesterday i hung out with someone who i havent hung out with in like forever, and it was nice. we were happy and having a good time.... weird huh? lol there was some funny things happening , like everyone was speaking spanish, i swear to god , they really were. and lol we went to get hot fudge sundays at mc donalds, and she was like "" hi can i have ummm..... two hot fudge sundays."" and they guy was like swannanoutswidat. lol it was wicked fricken funny. lol then she was like ahhh...ummm..(like 2 minutes later)... hot fudge. i guess you all had to be there, but whatever it was wicked fun.</P>

"event","<P>well i am sitting in photography again, doing nothing like always...fun! anyways, my weekend was pretty fun i guess. Friday night i hung out with aaron , ryan , kim ,matt and ted(for a few), we mostly just chilled with kim at her work until when she got out. when we got ready to leave and go to aaron's house ted, matt and ryan left before we did, then i left andaaron was behind me. on our way i saw flashing lights and i was like oh watch it be ryan and company... it was , there was three cop cars that pulled them over. when i saw it i was scared shit-less, i saw a cop with a flash light on the side of the car searching... not to mention that they were&nbsp;blazed and they had shit on them and all, so kim aaron and i were all thinking of what was going to happen. eventually when they got to aaron's house , they said that they got a warning for having a inspection sticker that expired. it was wicked scary. anyways&nbsp; i ended up staying the night at aaron's with him, kim and ryan, then i had to get up @ 5:50 to go to work... it sucked.</P>
<P>After work i hung out with them again until kim went to work and ryan went home. aaron and i decided that we were going to go visit kim @ work, but my mom was gay and said that i couldnt cuz the roads were bad. so i stayed @ home until 9 and then i went out with tom and derek, and eventually kim and aaron came to. </P>
<P>on sunday i worked 6am-11am, then 12pm-9pm, it sucked my balls but&nbsp; it was 14 hours of time and a half($10.50/hour). whatever but today sucked... for some reason i am in a bad mood but not. one of my friends told me that he thinks that i just have a lot going on right now and i have a lot spinning around in my head, and that it is causing me stress. but i dont know, i really am thinking about some confusing things , and some bad things... but i dont know, i think that i just need to figure things out on my own. so sorry if i have been an ass or bitchy to anyone lately</P>"

But whatever i need to go find something to do cuz i am wicked bored"

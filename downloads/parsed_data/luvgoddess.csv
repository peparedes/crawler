"event","OMFG!  I just wrote a whole big long thing about what I did today... so I guess I'm gonna type the friggin thing again...

Well, my busy day all began at 7 am this morning... Last night Zack said that it was ok that I came out there and we could hang out.. I was like yay!  He mommy said yes.  hehe.  So I go to bed at about 3am and set my alarm for 6:45.. so i totally got no sleep!!  

WHen I got up I took a shower and got ready.  I told my mommy that I was going ot Michigan's Adventure with Heather, Mike, and Jade... just so that I could actually go.  SO by 9 I am ready to leave.. and my mommy gives me sum money that im supposed to be using to get into the amusment park.. but instead it was used for gas.  I leave my house at 9:30am and head east on 9f towards Lansing.

It was soo cold out!! I had the heat on!  I was freezing.  I get hungry by like 10:30 and I stop at McDonalds for breakfast.. yummy!  And I am once again back on the road.  From here on its basically a straight shot for like an hour and a half... Then it got REALLY confusing!  Like I go sooo lost! I went ot sum ghetto 7-11 to use a phone.. but none of their 4 phones worked!  Blah.  SO I went inside and ased them for help.. and they just got me more lost... and more confused.  SO then I find this McDOnalds and I ask the people working if they know where the hell im going... and they're like I dont know where West Bloomfield is... and im like damnit!  THen some guy waiting in line sayz that he can get me there and gets outa map and shows my exactly where to go.. turns out that I'm not too far away!  

So I go on this road called MiddleBelt and i am going toward 14 mile.. and I am looking at my map.. and i guess I am not really paying attention very well.. cuz i rear-eand someone!  And I'm like omg!!! ANd i break out and cry... And the guy says hes gonna gonna call the police cuz there is no damage and i was like 'omg thank you soo much'  If he called the popo's.. id be dead by my rents... So I finally get to his street at like 1pm and i pass his house! so I turn around and go back.. and hes outside and i get outside for like 2min,,, then im back in the damn car.. lol. We go to sum mall.. I think it was called 12 point or sumfin... and we wallk around and go in fun stores.  He turns out to be a fun guy.. just like who i thought he was.... After about 2 hourse of being there... and trying to kill Zack(lol) we decide to go to a movie.  But we can't get into American Pie 2 without proper ID or an adult...  SO we sit outside for like 30min and debate who is gonna ask someone to buy us tix.... and apparently it was my 'job'.. so i asked some lady who like totally ignored me.  ANd then some other lady had oer-heard our convo and so she has her husband buy them.  The next step was to find someone to be our 'parents'.  So Zack sees sum guy and asks him.. but he sayz no.. i mean who woulnt wanan be our rents? lol.  ANd then he sees a guy on the soccer teams dad and he sayz he'll take us. yay!

The movie was really good!  It was fucking hilarious!  I recomend it. lol.  I laughed my ass off.  THe movie was done at like 7 and i was starving.. I hadn't eaten since breakfast!  So we go to McDonalds and we eat sumfin there.  Then we decide to go ot Target and walk around.  Good fun.  I saw a huge spider on the ground and Zack makes me go by it!  THen I have fun tickeling him. lol.. great fun.  Then it was like 8pm and I need to take him home.  So we go back ot his house.. and he relooks up the directions to get me home.. just so i dont get lost. Awww :)  And then I leave at like 8:30 or so... :(

Zack is a great guy.  But only problem is he lives really far away from me.. blah.  I really wish he didnt.... I think we would hook up... blah, in my dreeeeams.........."

I called him today and we talked for like almost 2 hours.  And lives like a million miles away... well 3 hours... but still!  And we were supposed to do sumfin tomorrow... buts his mommy says he cant.  Blah, oh well.  He had to go to soccer so I'm all alone.... :(

Now my sister wants me to drive her and her little friends to a movie at like 6:45... not something I am looking forward to.... But oh well, as long as they are giving me money for gas... it's all good.

Shawn said he'd change the oil in my car at 6 for free.  I mean, if hes gonna do it for free, of course I'll have it done... but i dont know if i can make it.. blah"

Then my mommy told me to go buy bagels... and i was like okay.... actually i think i was the one who wanted them.. she just told me to go to the Bagel Beanery to get em.  That was fun stuff.... Then I got home and I was bored... SO i called up adam in Lowell... He tells me to come out there and im like ok... I grab him the battery powered fan that belongs to my sis (cuz its too fucking hot) and i grab sum m and m's.  Thing is I don't really know where I am going... cuz i dont know where Lowell is....

So... I drive on 96 heading east toward lansing... and I keep thinking im lost.... Like nothing looks familar and theres SOOOOOOO much traffic! I'm like damnit.. I dont wanna turn around..... So i figure the next exit ill go to a gas station and ask for directions... but where the hell is the next exit???  So I am driving for what seems like forever and then i see the next exit... and its Lowell!  I was like omg...  

Blah... while i was hanging out with Adam... Shawn calls and asks me if I want to see a movie with him... I was liek definently.. I havent seen him in forever!  So I meet him at Meijer.. cuz I dont know where he moved to... and we sit in my car for awhile while this huge ass storm is forming!!  I mean like all the sudden its pitch black out...  We then decide to see Rush Hour 2 at 9:00 at the Ada-Lowell 5. But its only like 8... So we sit in the car... Then I needs gas. Shawn offers to pay... aww how nice.  We drive to the nearest Admiral... then it starts to pour... We get gas in the POURING rain.. BLAH!

The movie was goood... However I kept thinking that there would be a tornado and we would all die... but o well :) When the movie is over... I drive him home.. He lives in the middle of no where!  Sheeshers!  I thought I was gonna hit a tree, a deer, or a person.... blah.  But we made it to his house safely... even tho i was scared... THen me and his doggy chased froggies :) 

Blah... that was my whole day... I havent even checked my email yet... maybe i should.....

"event","I was just looking out the back door when I saw him... the asshole.  I guess now I have to explain who the asshole is.  His name is Steve Wright and he goes to Creston High School.  He is 16.  I went out with him for a month... and that was just about the worst month of my life....  It was filled with its ups and downs... basically only downs....  It started out perfectly... Then i found out about him... He did drugs, stole things from people, and treated his family like shit.... But thru all of this.. I still went out with him.... He told me he loved me...  Then a bunch of shit happened.. particularly this event..  I called him at my neighbors house and he said that my friend Kaytie Mansel was over there. And I was like alright lemme talk to her... She gets on the phone and calls me a fucking bitch and Steve doesn't like me anymore. And then she hangs up on me.  (And lemme add something to this, the day b4 this happened i had sprained my elbow and i had it in a splint and a sling and i was taking morphine and vicodin.) I get up and tell my mom 'I'm going to kick Kaytie Mansel's ass' and i leave.  Like my mom is chasing after me now.. cuz im all messed up and starts to threaten me to get me not to do it.  But i dont listen and i go over anyway to kick her ass.  I get to the door and act normal and ask if i can talk to Kaytie... my neighbor answers and says shes in the basement... I go down there and punch her.... She then attacks me... It's a cat fight.  Me with a busted arm and everything... My mom is suddenly there trying ot get us apart... we're screaming and scratching eachother... kicking and hitting...  My mom gets me off her and Kaytie goes upstairs.. I follow her and start to kick her... then Steve comes and hes like dragging me away and he punches me in the arm... I mean, woah, a guy just hit a gurl.... So i punch him in the face and give him a bloody nose... Then I like collapse on the ground outsde screaming...... blah.

Hes an asshole... straight up.  My parents banned him from ever comming around here again.... but still he comes.... I'm scared... 

The other day... I had been drinking and he came to my neighbors door where i was.... and i walk outside and he pushes me onto the cement... leaving me with a bruise on my arm and cut up feet and legs.....  People dont realize that this guy is a jerk... I dont know how many times i need to tell them......

People are stoopid... thats all i can say... I've had enuf of this abuse........"

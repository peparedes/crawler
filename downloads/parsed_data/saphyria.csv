"event","Wow. It's... been a really long time since I've updated this LJ. I take full responsibility (as I should, because it's my LJ).

Anyway! Meme.

<i>Comment to this post, and I will list five things I associate with you, They might make sense or they might be totally random. Then post that list, with your commentary, to your LJ (or just add a reply back to me). Other people (including me) can get lists from you, and the meme merrily perpetuates itself.</i>

My words, via <lj user=""skidmo"">

<b>Kittens:</b> I have always loved cats, and more often than not, they love me back. Fuzzy, warm, adorable, affectionate when they want to be, full of personality, and much less needy than dogs. Ironically, I am also horribly allergic to them. I can take all the antihistamines and decongestants in the world, and still, at some point, I will reach the point where I can no longer sleep because I will simply stop breathing if I don't keep concentrating on doing so. I know this from experience.  

Twice in my life, a roommate and I have taken in a kitten, and twice in my life I've gotten to the point where I had to choose between sleeping and breathing.  Once in college, where it turned out that the kitten really preferred my company to my roommate's, though my roommate is the one who found/adopted without asking me/wanted to keep the kitten in the first place.  Irony.  I named the little calico Edelweiss as a kind of in-joke, before my roommate finally took her home to Texas and let me get back to sleeping/breathing.  The second time was in grad school, where my roommate and I both agreed to take in the little tortie that had been abandoned near our apartment. She was adorable and affectionate and a delight to have around. We called her Meimei, but after a while it got again to the point where I could not breathe, so we had to take her to the humane society.

<b>Tesla:</b> TESLAAAAAA! *throws bloomers* I've been a fan for years of this RL mad scientist. I read stuff about him, and wonder how he could've been real.He was just so cool. The Tesla character on Sanctuary just solidified my love of him, even though I know the portrayal on the show is nearly completely different than how the man was in RL. It doesn't hurt that J-Yo steals every scene he's in by sheer presence alone (and is really hot. There, I said it.).

<b>Cooking:</b> I am fond of cooking, but I haven't always been. I think it's just since I got out of college that I've taken an interest in experimenting with food. I have a large collection of bookmarked recipes, both online and in cook books I own.  My favorite cook books are <i>Cooking for Geeks</i> (though there are relatively few recipes in there for a book of its size. It's mainly a geek's guide to the science behind cooking. It shows you on a molecular level why you can't beat egg whites into a meringue in a plastic bowl, and talks about the temperatures at which specific proteins in steak denature, making a steak ""medium"" or ""well-done"") and my 3-ring binder of the 1950 <i>Betty Crocker Cook Book</i>. It's kind of hilarious, full of recipes that no one these days would ever make (Ring of Plenty, I'm looking at you!) and information such as ""what is tea?"" and tips on how to be a good housewife (lol).

<b>Librarian:</b> It was only in my last year of college that I came to the conclusion that Library Science was the right fuzzy science for me. I was an English major, History minor, who didn't know what she wanted to do after college. I knew I loved learning things, but I loved learning things about theoretical physics just as much as I loved cellular biology, gender politics, literature, technology... anything. I couldn't decide on any one subject or find anything I wanted to <i>do</i> with any one subject. So I realized that the best way to learn things about those subjects might be to put myself in a field where I could also help others learn about them. Librarianship just fit. I've always loved helping others learn, and my altruistic streak was made happy by the feeling that librarianship brought, that by offering information to those who are seeking it, I'm somehow making the world a better, less ignorant place.  

I've since taken a job in my state's archives, which has more of a historical bent than most research or public libraries, but has much the same feeling. I work with people who are writing books on historical topics, as well as people who are trying to find out where their families came from, and piece together their genealogy. It's great.

<b>RP:</b> Milliways is my first-ever experience RPing.  I've played console RPGs, and some MUDs in the past, but I'd never participated in anything like an LJ-based RPG. It was 2004. I was seventeen, and had just graduated from high school. I'd finished this book series a couple of days before, the <i>Old Kingdom</i> trilogy by Garth Nix, and had loved them. Though to be honest, I'd been annoyed that my favorite character of the series, one of the lesser main-characters whose snark was everpresent, whose aims were unclear and whose loyalties were questionable (my favorites tend to be this. See Tesla, above.) had been made so interesting, but hadn't been developed at all. Too much was left unexplained. I mean, his one major speech about his reasons for what he's doing gets <i>interrupted</i> by the main character attacking the person he's talking to, and we never get to hear the rest of it. I was kind of annoyed.  

Then, while reading though Harry Potter fic reccs at <lj user=""copperbadge"">'s LJ, I saw an advertisement for this new, pan-fandom role-playing game. I checked it out. It was awesome. I got in trouble with my parents nearly every day for two weeks for staying on the computer so much, just reading threads and hitting refresh. I snuck out of my room at night after my parents went to bed, to check for new posts.  After two weeks of watching, I finally summoned up my courage and created a journal for the character whose story I felt was incomplete, and applied. Haven't looked back since. ^_^"

Lovely fade to Mina from Vlad, so that his image lingers as if looking down at her.

""Vlad has outsmarted us again!"" Well, yes.  You keep discussing your plans within earshot of Mina, who you've already mentioned is having her mind read by Dracula. Wake up!

Van Helsing is all ""Heheheheheh, my creeping at Mina has finally paid off! OHSHI-""

"event","Real-time commentary! For the first half, at least.

<lj-cut text=""Cut for length, because dear lord-"">
Dramatic narration! Hi there, Anthony Hopkins.

Vlad does not realize how much that armor makes him look like a lobster. And that dramatic-silhouetted-on-red battle? Looks giggle-inducing hilarious. The Wilhelm Scream didn't help, of course. ^__^

Dear 1992 Keanu Reeves: Over-enunciation and stilted acting do not an Englishman make.

Oh lord his accent is so superbly Dracula. The movie even pulls it off with only a moment of ""omg cliche!""

And no, he does not drink........................... wine.

Heee. Dracula's shadow never quite matches his movements. *giggles* Ahah! And the teleportation where his shadow doesn't move with him at all. Nice.  Hell, the shadowplay in this movie is everywhere and well done, always just this side of too much.

""Forgive my curiosity, Count, but why ten such locations with such precision around London?""  ...My first thought was that Vlad would turn out to be a James Bond villain.

Lucy is hilarious (*coughcoughHORcough*), but isn't convincing. Like, at all. Mina's actress would make a good Sabriel. (*later imdb's* Hey! Winona Ryder!)

Personal space seems to have been a concept not yet invented in Vlad's time.

...Harker apparently has no survival instinct to speak of, because he has Dracula behind him, <i>helping him shave his neck.</i>

Keanu just sounds like he has a cold, trying to do an angry English accent.

Oh, this movie. It hits all the high points and memorable lines. (Dracula: ""Ah, the children of the night, what sweet music they make."" Keanu!Harker: ""WTF, Crazy Gary Oldman! AND WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU SPIDERMANNING UP MY WALL?!"")

Okay, the fact that Dracula shuts the door behind him before his shadow gets out of the room shouldn't make me think of Peter Pan. SOMEONE GET THE SOAP.

...Rats are scurrying along the underside of the steel truss bridge holding up the castle's ceiling.

In all seriousness, customs at the Transylvanian border must've confiscated Jonathan Harker's survival instincts.

Keanu!Harker: LADY WITH NO SHIRT TOUCHES MY KNEECAPS! MY REPRESSED 19th CENTURY SELF CANNOT HANDLE THIS PASSION!

Ignoring all the bland ""passion,"" why are their lateral incisors sharp and not their canines?

So Dracula barges in, angry that his brides're sexing up Harker, who ""belongs to"" <i>him</i>.  Apparently. Harker wonders if Dracula is going to sex him up too. Why do Dracula's brides act like puppies?

And Harker flips his shit at the baby.  Really amusingly, too, since it's Keanu (and since Dracula's evil laughter is amazingly infectious).

This movie didn't need any more Lucy. She's annoying.

Also yes, this is completely accurate. In rainstorms, young ladies in expensive (and rather sheer) dresses always giggle and flounce about in the gardens getting completely soaked while cameras swirl dizzily with them. (On the off-chance a vampire might be watching them, of course.) And then they kiss, causing the London Zoo's collection of monkeys and wolves and iguanas to go completely insane.

Dracula is also a werewolf.  The peace treaty is signed, forever ending the war between the vampires and the lycans.

Dude. Ow. Mina, wear a bra when you're running down stairs. OW.

*cackles* Dear lord, Lucy's scarlet diaphanous accordion dress. I can just see that thing hanging in her closet with her every-day clothes.  While Mina tries to find her, wearing a couple of silk sheets she happened to pick up on the way out the door.

""Lucy! Lucy, you're dreaming! You totally didn't just enthusiastically bump genitalia with a wolfman on top of a tomb!""  (late 19th century England was SO INTERESTING, man.)

MINA.  BRA.  PLEASE.  OW.

Personally, were I Dracula, I'd have killed Renfield just to shut him up.

The muted, old-fashioned style of the scenes where Dracula is walking the streets of London is actually really cool. Mina's tiny tophat, however, is ridonkulous.  Her immediate dismissal of Dracula upon meeting him, again however, redeems her somewhat.

Then she goes and screws it up.

PERSONAL SPACE, VLAD.

...<i>His</i> canines are the ones that elongate for him, while is brides' lateral incisors are elongated...

Oh Harker. ""...these may be the last words I write. Dracula has left me with these devil women... I'm totally not enjoying myself...."" >_>

Oh, hey! Anthony Hopkins. Hi, Anthony Hopkins! Awesome.  

NOT YOU TOO, HOPKINS. PERSONAL SPACE. AUGH.</lj-cut>

Okay.  Second half of the movie to come later. Now I sleep."

The Author of American Ornithology Sketches a Bird, Now Extinct
by David Waggoner

(Alexander Wilson, Wilmington, N.C., 1809)

When he walked through town, the wing-shot bird he'd hidden
Inside his coat began to cry like a baby,
High and plaintive and loud as the calls he'd heard
While hunting it in the woods, and goodwives stared
And scurried indoors to guard their own from harm.

And the innkeeper and the goodmen in the tavern
Asked him whether his child was sick, then laughed.
Slapped knees, and laughed as he unswaddled his prize,
His pride and burden: an ivory-billed woodpecker
As big as a crow, still wailing and squealing.

Upstairs, when he let it go in his workroom,
it fell silent at last. He told at dinner
How devoted masters of birds drawn from the life
Must gather their flocks around them with a rifle
And make them live forever inside books.

Later, he found his bedspread covered with plaster
And the bird clinging beside a hole in the wall
Clear through to already-splintered weatherboards
And the sky beyond. While he tied one of its legs
To a table leg, it started wailing again.

And went on wailing as if toward cypress groves
While the artist dew and tinted on fine vellum
Its red cockade, gray claws, and sepia eyes
From which a white edge flowed to the lame wing
Like light flying, and ended there in blackness.

He drew and studied for days, eating and dreaming
Fitfully through the dancing and loud drumming
Of an ivory bill that refused pecans and beetles,
Chestnuts and sweet-sour fruit of magnolias,
Riddling his table, slashing his fingers, wailing.

He watched it die, he said, with great regret. </lj-cut>


And just because I like them, and they've been stuck in my head lately:

<lj-cut text=""Spelling, by Margaret Atwood"">
Spelling, by Margaret Atwood

My daughter plays on the floor
with plastic letters,
red, blue & hard yellow,
learning how to spell,
spelling,
how to make spells.

I wonder how many women
denied themselves daughters,
closed themselves in rooms,
drew the curtains
so they could mainline words.

A child is not a poem,
a poem is not a child.
there is no either/or.
However.

I return to the story
of the woman caught in the war
& in labour, her thighs tied
together by the enemy
so she could not give birth.

Ancestress: the burning witch,
her mouth covered by leather
to strangle words.

A word after a word
after a word is power.

At the point where language falls away
from the hot bones, at the point
where the rock breaks open and darkness
flows out of it like blood, at
the melting point of granite
when the bones know
they are hollow & the word
splits & doubles & speaks
the truth & the body
itself becomes a mouth.

This is a metaphor.

How do you learn to spell?
Blood, sky & the sun,
your own name first,
your first naming, your first name,
your first word.</lj-cut>

The Health-Food Diner

No sprouted wheat and soya shoots
And Brussels in a cake,
Carrot straw and spinach raw,
(Today, I need a steak).

Not thick brown rice and rice pilaw
Or mushrooms creamed on toast,
Turnips mashed and parsnips hashed,
(I'm dreaming of a roast).

Health-food folks around the world
Are thinned by anxious zeal,
They look for help in seafood kelp
(I count on breaded veal).

No smoking signs, raw mustard greens,
Zucchini by the ton,
Uncooked kale and bodies frail
Are sure to make me run

to

Loins of pork and chicken thighs
And standing rib, so prime,
Pork chops brown and fresh ground round
(I crave them all the time).

Irish stews and boiled corned beef
and hot dogs by the scores,
or any place that saves a space
For smoking carnivores."

I hurt.  Mom and Dad are getting tired of hearing my worries and fears for my health, putting it off as fibro or over-active imagination.  Which, having my dad sound so exasperated and belittling while I'm trying not to have a heart attack doesn't really make me feel better at all.  Thanks.

I just wish I could figure out what's wrong with me.  Once I know that, I'd know what needed to be fixed.  I keep on wanting to compile a list of symptoms and check myself into a hospital.  Hand them the list, and say, ""Find out what's wrong, and fix me.""

Though the blood results also told me I was a bit anemic, so I need more iron and B-12.

Then they sent me to the hospital for an ultrasound.  Turns out I have a couple of cysts on my left ovary that's been causing part of the pain. He says that if they were going to cause any trouble, there'd be a lot more symptoms than just pain. Sooooo comforting. >_>  So I just have to get a follow-up ultrasound in a couple of months, to check on them.  He didn't give me anything for the pain that still plagues me from rib-cage to pelvis, though, so that's still <i>peachy</i>.

"event","So, re: my previous post on my health, I went to the doctor.

Apparently, I have something called splenic flexure syndrome, going along with the whole irritable bowel thing.  It means that pockets of air in my colon have been pressing on the nerve in the bend of the colon next to the spleen, keeping it from telling me that I need to use the bathroom.

Meaning that I'm literally (not just figuratively, this time) full of it.

Or was.  They gave me the stuff they give people when they're prepping for colonoscopies.  Yeah.  Three hours of drinking vaguely pineapple-flavored salty slime every ten minutes.  Six hours unable to leave the bathroom.

I hurt more than I did before.  I had been stretching my colon, and now it's like a rubber band that had been held stretched for too long.  It hurts because it had gotten used to being stretched, and now isn't.  I feel like I need to use the bathroom all the time.  My bladder and kidneys hate me.  Heck, my body from the ribs downward hate me.  My intestine is cramping and grumbling, my fibromyalgia has caused knots to form in my posture muscles, meaning that the striated muscle is hurting on top of the over-stretched smooth muscle below.  I ache all over.  I'm tired.

I woke up the morning after spending the 6 hours (until 5am) in the bathroom, to find my abdomen had exploded with pain.  I nearly passed out, I know it.  I couldn't feel anything, couldn't think.  My mom and dad were scared, I was so pale.  I was scared, but couldn't really feel it.  I stumbled into the kitchen and fell into a chair, holding out my hand for something, anything.  I was severely dehydrated, having expelled all the liquid that could reach my intestine the night before.  I had no potassium in my system, nor any blood sugar to speak of.  

One chugged 7up, a potassium pill, and fifteen minutes of burping later, I felt nearly human. It didn't last. All my family was visiting for my grandfather's 90th birthday party, so we had a 13yr old, a 9yr old, a 3yr old and an 18 month old running around the house, along with a considerable number of family members, some making shit jokes at my expense (love you too, guys). And I got to help host a reception/party for 60 people, doling out punch and helping clean up spills, chatting with people I hardly knew (or straight-up didn't know) all that afternoon.  I was on my feet the entire time. 

Then a family supper, and more talking. I was glad to see them all, since I so rarely get to, but I wish I had felt better.  I could have enjoyed it more.

 People left, this morning.

Including my parents, so I'm alone with my hurty, light-headed self, tonight.

And I have an 11-hour drive tomorrow.

From ribs to hip and everywhere in between, front and back.

And I have no idea why.  All my fibromyalgia tender points feel like they should be showing massive bruises.  It sometimes feels like I pulled something, or I slept crooked, or have been sitting with bad posture forever.  Then other times it feels like I'm bloated, and stiff, and can't move right.

I can point exactly to the eight points on my side that are where the hurts center around. Front-left ribs; stomach up and left of navel; hollow of left hip; left side just up from hip; left ribs under my arm; back ribs under my left shoulderblade; mid-back on left side; and back of hips just down from the small of my back. 

I just can't tell you whyyyyy.

Mom says stress, causing fibro to go into high gear and causing the irritable bowel syndrome that goes with it, which okay, I've been under a bit of stress lately, but that's nothing new.  Nothing to make me hurt <i>only</i> on my left side for a full month.

Dad says it's acid reflux, which... thanks for the concern, but it's really not.

<lj-cut text=""The prisoner, Admiral."">
~*~*~*~
""The prisoner, Admiral.""

""Good. Sit him down,"" she replied, not turning from the view of the warships of the 7th Alliance fleet afforded her by the wide windows.  ""And you are dismissed, sergeant.""

""Ma'am.""

Hearing the soft whoosh of the doors closing behind the sergeant, leaving the two of them relatively alone, the Admiral turned from her view of the black to take her first look at the prisoner.  The young man sat in the only chair in the room, arms tightly bound behind his back.  His pale skin showed the bruises clearly, the uncut hair shading his eyes.  She could see the signs of malnutrition and hard living on his frame, but clearer still were the signs of sullen contempt in his stony silence.

""You've been found aiding, hiding and transporting deserters from among our troops, young man,"" she stated, as clear as an accusation made in court.  A court the prisoner would never see.  ""From among the Independents as well, interestingly enough,"" the Admiral added as she strode over towards him.

The prisoner gave no response, neither lifting his head nor making a sound.

""Some of them had been good soldiers, with promotions ahead of them.  Pity that they shall all be executed as deserters because of you.""

""Not because of me,"" the prisoner rasped in a quiet monotone, not looking at her.  ""I don't make people fight for causes they don't believe in.""

""For those that can't see the bigger picture, we like to hope that we can <i>help</i> them see it,"" replied the Admiral, secure in her belief.

The prisoner did not acknowledge her.

""Do you not see the importance of this war?"" she tilted her head, gazing almost incredulously down at his inscrutable, expressionless face.  ""Can you really not see beyond your own situation to see the good we are trying to do? The peace we are seeking to create and that the Independents are seeking to destroy?""

After a long moment, the pale prisoner lifted his head to look up at her. His voice, rough from disuse, was a quiet growl. ""I believe we all are doing what we feel is right.""

""You are leading people to their deaths, aiding deserts, prolonging the war,"" she snapped, stepping quickly forward to grab the prisoner by the throat, forcing his head back so that he had no choice but to look at her.  ""You could help end it quickly, but your short-sighted selfishness keeps you from seeing it.  You could do... so much good."" Her voice faltered at the last, almost changing her accusations to a plea.

""What good can one make, if it is created through the merciless sacrifice of unwilling victims?"" The prisoner hissed at her, gaze blazing fierce and rebellious. The Admiral could feel the tendons in his neck, tight with strain, under her hand.  ""What good is there to be found in something built upon the blood of those who had different definitions of <i>Good</i>?  What ends are there that can justify those means?""

Their gazes held one another, each unblinking, one collected but strangely tinged with sorrow, the other suffused with fury.  At last, the Admiral dropped her hold on the prisoner's neck, letting him fall forward.

""Does this mean you won't volunteer?""



""You know I won't.""

""No,"" her voice was quiet, her eyes rested on his bowed form with sadness.  ""I know you won't.""

The Admiral took a breath, held it, and let it out.  ""But you will wish you had.""

He looked up at her.  The sorrow was gone from her face, hidden behind the cold authority in her eyes.  ""You had built quite an elaborate system of hiding places and transport lines in such a short time.  Almost commendable, really.  Your lines of deserter-smuggling stretched across eight worlds, across both Alliance and Independent lines, and you were certainly not the only one involved,"" she stated, looking down at him as coldly as a judge.  ""You will be telling us the identities of your accomplices and the locations of all your hiding places, and the names of all the ships and captains who were helping you transport the deserters from one place to the next.  You will be helping us find the deserters and put an end to it, helping us end this bloody but necessary war, and thus helping us do some good in this 'verse.""

Her gloved fingers gripped his hair, pulling his head up and back once more. ""You will be,"" the Admiral enunciated very clearly, ""a fully contributing and upstanding asset to the Alliance's cause.""

""Never,"" the prisoner growled, his pale face flushed with anger.

""Sooner than you think,"" she answered softly, her palm resting gently against his cheek for a moment, ""my dear brother.""  

He didn't see it, but there was hurt in her eyes when he jerked his head away.

The Admiral's voice rose a moment later in a command. ""Guards.""  The doors opened again with their sterile, metal whoosh.  ""Take the prisoner to Room 101, for processing.""

So!

The twentieth of January was an awesome Tuesday, all-round, but most of the awesome from my perspective happened before 1pm.  

First off, my Rare Book Librarianship class is a class full of Geeks Like Me.  Most of that class was spent huddled at the head of the table, around our professor as he brought out some of the best of the Lilly's collection for us to look at and touch, while teaching us the signs to look for that might make something valuable.

Deciding to get the best out of the way first, as otherwise we'd be standing around him staring at the cart where these specimens were, rather than paying attention to the other pieces... he started with showing us the collection's Shakespeare First Folio.

<b><i>I GOT TO HOLD AND LOOK THROUGH A FIRST FOLIO OF SHAKESPEARE.</i></b>

It was rather amazing, to say the very least, though I still remember what he pointed out about page restoration, rebinding marks and such, for us to learn to pick up on.

The second piece brought out was the Lilly's Caxton Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, which had been bound in oak and tanned pigskin.  Someone made the reference to ""pale leather"" before I could, which sparked a merrily diverting discussion on the small collection of books the Lilly <i>does</i> have that <i>are</i> bound in human skin.

We also got to see Ian Fleming's first type-through of <i>Goldfinger</i>, with its crossed out and re-crossed out title choices, and Earnest Hemingway's high school yearbook, and the high school student literary publication where his first work, ""The Judgement of Manitou"" was first published. ^_____^

Alas, we didn't get to see the first edition <i>Tamerlane</i> by Poe, as it was on display for Poe's birthday, and ""the plexiglass cube it's displayed in weighs a ton."" *grins*

And then we were let out of class early so we could go have snacks in the next room, surrounded by the huuuuuge collection of 19th and 20th century puzzles that was recently donated to the Lilly, and watch the inauguration.  

Which was the crowning moment of awesome as far as last Tuesday went.  I wasn't the only person in the room who got misty-eyed.

In other, more recent news, there's eight to ten inches of snow outside.  A full foot on my car hood.  My car is a snowdrift.  It's that very fine, powdery snow that's awesome for snowshoing and skiing... but horrible for anything concrete like snowballs and snowmen.

The only thing it's good for, other than causing one's fingers to freeze off (see also Saph trying to clear off <lj user=""raindrenched"">'s car last night for an <font style='background-image: url(http://misc.inexistent.org/sparkle/sparkles/glitter.gif);color:inherit; padding:2px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 25px;'><font style='background-image: url(http://misc.inexistent.org/sparkle/sparkles/glitter3.gif); '>adventure!</font></font> to Target.

A pretty scene from campus, before yesterday's Extra Heaping Helping of Snow happened:

And apparently, there's been an ice-storm so bad that the NW part of Arkansas, where our cabin-in-the-woods is, has ground to a halt.  All the area universities are closed.  Reports are saying that an inch of ice is coating everything, uprooting trees that fall under the weight, causing others to explode as they freeze, expanding with nowhere to expand <i>to</i>.  Our neighbor up there grows pines on his land to sell as Christmas trees, and he's lost his entire spread, bent double or snapped under the weight.  He's been trying to cut the trees that have fallen across the road, so he could see how our place fared, but so much debris is blocking the way, he's not been able to check in on the damage at our cabin.

No one can get in or out of the area, right now, until the bulldozers are brought in, and no one has any power there.  Mom and Dad are really worried.  They've poured their hearts and souls into this cabin (pictures of which can be found <a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v448/saphyria/cabin/"">here</a>), and they're worried that the damage might be extensive.  People have been saying it's like an F5 tornado hit.

Lovely.


So, that's my life right now, from the highs to the lows.  I have a new character to bring into Milliways, soon, probably tomorrow if I can brain again.  At the moment, however, I'm going to try and finish up a scarf, then read.

Our Christmas has been quiet so far. Doesn't really feel like Christmas yet.  Family comes in tomorrow evening, and we open presents as a big group after lunch on Saturday.  It'll be a bit smaller than usual, this year.  Jim and Haruno are in Japan, though we'll see them this summer when we go over for their wedding (^___^), and Mike, Mary and Meredith can't make it due to work scheduling.  So.  Only seventeen of us attending.  

Mom, Dad and I traded presents though, this morning.  They got me the fourth season of Dr. Who, which we started on today.  They've not seen it yet, so we'll try to finish it by the time I head back to Bloomington.  (I watched the Doctor Who Confidential about the end of this season and started crying again.  Dammit.)  They loved the socks I knit, and both wore them most of the rest of the day.  Except for when dad had to take his off because they were making his feet too warm.  *smug*  Pics and stuff will be up at <lj user=""good_thread""> soon enough.

Crash course in MAC-using!

Crazy.  

So.  Hopefully I'll be around tomorrow.  Hopefully, the day after.  

This may send me home for Christmas break a bit earlier than I expected, if I'm going to be mostly cut-off from using my computer.  *eyes it* 

Anyone know what might be wrong?  Whenever I turn it on, it starts up... and either freezes on the Welcome screen, or just as it gets to my desktop.  It never loads the desktop the whole way.  Usually just the MacAfee virus scanner icon shows up at the right of the bar at the bottom of the screen, and then it stops.  The little light that shows that it's working on something goes out.  Annnnnd nothing happens.  I can't click on anything.  Usually, and this is weird, I can click about five times before it freezes completely.  Not that those clicks will actually *do* anything other than make the computer eventually freeze.

It's really frustrating.  

So.  I may not be around.

*sighs*  This means I won't even be able to watch a movie while I work on my knitting.

Or listen to my music.

 It's by Denise Levertov, one of my favorite poets ever. 

<i>The Wings

Something hangs in back of me,
I can't see it, can't move it.

I know it's black,
a hump on my back.

It's heavy. You
can't see it.

What's in it? Don't tell me
you don't know. It's

what you told me about--
black

inimical power, cold
whirling out of it and

around me and
sweeping you flat.

But what if,
like a camel, it's

pure energy I store,
and carry humped and heavy?

Not black, not
that terror, stupidity

of cold rage; or black
only for being pent there?

What if released in air
it became a white

source of light, a fountain
of light? Could all that weight

be the power of flight?
Look inward: see me

with embryo wings, one
feathered in soot, the other

blazing ciliations of ember, pale
flare-pinions. Well--

could I go
on one wing,

the white one?"

Little-to-no sleep last night, thanks to our upstairs neighbors playing DDR or ""Walk like the Elephants!"" or whatever it is they do from 1am to 5am every night that involves running thumpily across their floor adjoining our ceiling.  But I was fine for the drive, amazingly.

-Ten hours (and 20 minutes) in a car, counting the one stop for lunch and gas refill, will take a lot out of you.  BUT!  It means you can prove to the world that, at 68mph, you can totally make it from Bloomington, Indiana to Blytheville, Arkansas on three-quarters of a tank of gas.  *smug*  My Sinisterly Salacious Steel-Grey Mazda Six (it's official title), which my dad said would never get above 29mpg, outdid itself with 32.6 mpg on that leg of the trip.  *pets it*  Of course, impatience meant that the wonderful first 3/5ths of the journey, with its 32.6pmg record, would quickly come to an end.  Driving at 72 the rest of the way made sure that most of my newly-full tank of gas was gone before I reached home.

-I'm currently backing up my computer stuff onto my mom's external harddrive, since I've been having worrying computer problems lately.  The Time Remaining bar happily fluxuates between 30 minutes and 224 minutes remaining.  I think it's unsure.  Once it's all safely stowed, however, it can crash as it likes.  It's going to the repair shop over Christmas break, anyway. 

-I really would like to thread tonight, but I'm operating on about 2 hours of sleep and 10 hours (and twenty minutes!) of straight-on-til-morning driving, right now.  Once I'm sure my computer stuff is safe, I'm heading to bed.  Those I have slowtimes with, forgive me?

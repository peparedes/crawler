Shes only in 4th grade and she doesn't need one but her friends have one and she wants one so of course we went through our old stuff and I found my old ones and gave them to her! It's such a family moment i've become really connected to her though... We really get along.... But, the other one ooooooooooo no no no never in a million years would we agree on something. Oh well at least I have my young innocent one. I'm loosing my voice and it sucks very bad! Damn cold! School has been boring as usual. We had our lil TAKS test thing today it was so stupid.... only 28 questions... It was very very simple. Life is to short to hold a grudge so everyone out there that doesn't like me I really don't care anymore.. I used to care alot but really those people don't matter. Anyways I have no recent love interests it's kinda bland right now in that area... No one really special. Give it a 2 weeks things will change. They always do.

So, I find this one guy who I am totally falling for but at the same time there's another boy. Here's a good example of how I kind of feel, this morning I saw a hummingbird skipping from flower to flower tasting all the flavors instead of just staying at one sucking all of the flavor till there's none left. I find it hard to concentrate on one boy I don't know why. I like to meet all different types of guys not just stay with one for a long time. I don't know what to do? I don't want to go out with this one guy yet because what if this other guy is good for me too? What do I do? I can't tell him that I like other guys or he'll be sad and that's the last thing I want for him. I need to make a decision...But, why? I think i'm going to have some fun with this for awhile... haha. Shhh...Don't tell anyone."

All day she was like avoiding me and Rachel it was the funniest thing ever. She's such a fuckin skank.. And so many people are after her ass now... She's leaving Anderson because she has no friends except Lauren G. who's a hoe too... And she can't even defend herself...How sad... Too bad when kelly leaves Lauren won't have any friends..

It was really beautiful I was with my sisters and daddy. Then I came back to Ambies house we went with some people to someones house and chilled there till about 12*. Then went back to my 2nd home (Ambie's house). We just hung out. Before that we went to a chinese food place and me and amber were short 2$ so we told them that this was all the money our mother has till next week and she just wanted to feed us. Yeah, today we got up at 2 then eat then we went and cleaned and we have been cleaning since. We have successfully cleaned Amber's room and she's finishing her bathroom right now. Tonight we are going to hang out with some of our really cool people that we know and go to their casa. Then don't know what!! And, I can't decide on who to like now. I suppose nobody.

and everything is changing
yet sometimes it all feels the same
unconditional love sounds so wonderful
but no one gives it..
i cant figure it out 
why everyones out to make themselves look better then everyone else?
its like everythings a dream
since dreams are just like life
how can you tell whats a dream and whats not?
i need a meaning
a meaning to live..
how can i find that if i dont know what's real?
a reason."

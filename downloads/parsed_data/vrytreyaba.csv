"event","I found mispelling occurs (in Alla/KI combined) 10 times  as much I saw/did the same thing in my English subject for 17 years of education.
What I mean by mispell is really a mispell, not a typo.

Save -> saev is a typo.
Raise -> riase is a typo.
Typo is usually forgivable. Some people (like me) can type very fast so that they swap some words by neighboring keys.

Compare -> compair is a mispell.
Complain -> complaint is a mispell.
Then <-> than is a mispell.
Your <-> you're is horrible mispell. 
I want to say ""Go kill yourself, if your main language is English"", but that's too cruel.

My perspective seeing how people write written English has changed for past 2-3 years.

What this ""bad habit"" lead to? mispelling absorbed word from other language.

I still remembered my Korean friend complained how hard English is because there is no consistency pronouncing two different words using the same vowel: ""Car"" and ""Bad""

Not to say I'm a spelling NAZI or something... I sometimes do intended mispell/typo to make my sentence funny.
So, if one day you find I write English in wrong spelling. That's an intended error and you have no right to complain :P"

LOL @ sky pact pros/cons
It was already messed up since long time ago
when there were 7 NA LSs. It's already cramped when it comes to farming day

add the Gil sellers and JP players. That place will be totally cramped.
How long do you think earth day is? 48 hours?

From my POV, those who agree into sky pact only are those want to defend their time because that period is good/perfect for them. In the other hands, LSes that don't get the time they want / shafted into bad time period, of course, will not agree to sky pact and rather compete with others.

But when it comes to competition, this is where the mentality of players got rotten.

now I'm just waiting for ProjectXI done and I can enjoy administrated Vana'Diel
SE's servers are just too cramped now... and GM won't do jackshit about reports from the players, etc etc. I'd have to agree <a href=http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/setView/reviews/loadReview/44/gameId/74>mmorpg.com rating</a> about customer service"

luckily, Yunii still invite me for newly added TM mission. So, thanks a lot guys. I really appriciate your offer ^^
It's really rare people invite me for fun thing

We pretty much start TM8 (mercenary life) until the Royal Puppeteer part. We got all the Jody's Acid for popping the fomor NM in Caedarva Mire (access through Nashmau).
<lj-cut text=""complete spoilers here"">
So we did it this evening
Popping the NM

After we got the key item, we went back to Naja, and now porting to Dvucca Isle stagging point.
Zoning to Arrapago Reef, we take the CS on the ship deck (around the center of the map)

The battle goes like this:
our strategy: have a kiter(yunii, BRD), some kiter healer(Azzam and Anomaly (2 BLM)), and 2 DDer, (me and Ayasha(WAR)), and a DDer healer(Aruni (SMN), but she concentrate too much on yunii)
first round is 5 fomors. they hit pretty weak (about 30 damage... even lower than easy prey ochu in Wajoam)

Think like it's CoP6-4 BC mamet stage. They are squishy squishy. But annoying as hell since they have absorb TP move

second round... now we got 5 more fomors + COR fomor captain. The objective is to have the fomor COR HP to 20%

his defense is not as squishy as his underlings' I can say it's pretty much a high IT level for 75. That slug shot took about only 11% of its HP

and I think we underestimated this BC too much by zerg rush and low cure on DDer

"event","rated by the order of interest:
<li><b>Stealth Shot</b></li>
seems cool... -10 enmity can be very helpful, If barrage ""bug"" is left as is now, probably we can see
Stealth Shot + WS -> Barrage (no hate) -> PPA + WS

<li><b>Flashy Shot</b></li>
Very useful... but 20 minutes init recast time make me cry... If they make it 15 minutes, I probably, without doubt, placing 15 points on this category

<li><b>Recycle</b></li>
Saving money is good, but it's not neccessary :P

<li><b>Snapshot</b></li>
35~55 less delay won't give you any marginal improvment in exp and probably HNM too, not to mention if you reduce your delay below 530, the TP gained droped drastically


Probably I'm going 1 or 2 stealth and 3 flashy, or 3 snapshot (if the delay reduce is 5% per merit)"

hit fast, decent damage... but probably not much thing you can do for performance optimization

Thief
hit fast, possible spike damage every minute, can solo... interesting, but I don't like the low number on normal hit

Warrior
decent-high damage, wide range of offensive and defensive skill, gear, and abilities. good all round. but same thing with MNK.. not much to do to for performance optimization

Beast Master
the best solo job on wild. probably the potent highest DD in PT w/ pet. 1st option for soloable job

Dark Knight
best melee spike damage. accuracy can be acquired by some good endgame gear. but it just hard to get all the adaman...

Dragoon
uh... no comment. I haven't PTed with them since 50. same reason again with ""not much you can do to improve performance""

Ninja
similar to war. solo can be kinda tricky. but ugh... can be more expensive than rng

Ranger
my favourite job. Plus since the update, getting quick TP is really tricky

Samurai
probably my 2nd favourite. Because you need skill on timing the TP gain. damage probably average on per hit and WS.. but heck, I'm really impressed by SAM/NIN WS spamage on deco weapon PT.

Blue Mage
no comment... I haven't killed a single creature with this job. I heard it's really good for soloing up to mid 30.

Puppetmaster
people say sux... I have no comment. never got any of them in PT

Corsair
best XP job for experience++, but again, this is hybrid job. Unlike PLD which is not a hybrid of WAR and WHM, COR have noticably less attack and accuracy on ranged attack as well as lower performance (on average) compared to BRD. (and lol to 0 damage on god)"

WAR/NIN: 68 DEX = 34 accuracy
269 Axe = 200+62.1 = 262 accuracy

Head : Optical hat = 10 accuracy
Earrings : 2x Assault earring = 4 accuracy

extra : life belt = 10 accuracy
total gear 2 = 57 accuracy

*(I believe no WAR use sniper's on endgame xp huh?)*

overall total w/o food = 343~353 accuracy
overall total w/ food = 394~405 accuracy

RNG/NIN :

240 Axe = 200 + 36 accuracy = 236 accuracy

(OK this is kinda crap, I know RNG is not designed for melee)

ranged :

<lj-cut text=""See the long complaint"">
I think it's not the RNG only problem. I believe people perspective on DD is now concentrated on NIN,WAR,and MNK mostly. Let's see what make them seems strong.
NIN : 
- sub /WAR for attack up on berserk
- Sub /WAR for <b>double attack</b>
- <b>high evasion and parrying along with utsusemi</b> for very high survavibility.
- <b>dual weild trait</b> easily make them one of the fastest TP gain along with <b>wide range haste+ gear</b>

WAR : 
- berserk, agressor : <b>3 minutes attack and accuracy up</b>. compared to RNG sharpshot.. they're much superior (although we don't know what's the +accuracy sharpshot was/is)
- <b>utsusemi /NIN for survivability</b>

MNK : 
- focus : 2 minutes <b>accuracy up</b> with similar number of aggressor's
- boost : similar to berserk with slightly lower <b>attack boost</b>
- subing /WAR for <b>berserk</b> complementing the <b>boost</b>
- subing /WAR for <b>double attack</b>, complementing the <b>kick attack</b>. This make them one of the top TP gainer
- Martial arts trait which work really really nice on 75
- very high survivability with <b>high HP</b> and Chakra

Basically, there are 4 commons strong points of which those jobs shared:
- good atk+ up ability
- good acc+ up ability
- quick TP gain
- high survivability

Let's see the other other jobs:
I think I can make 2 categories of unpopular job:
1. Unpopular job but still have their own strong point:
THF :
- <b>Pretty quick TP gainer</b>, and <b>SATA+WS makes very good spike damage</b>
- <b>No acc+ and atk+ traits/abilities</b>
- Quick TP gain from triple attack
- many haste+ gear available for TP gain

SAM : 
- <b>Master of TP</b>. very useful in the fight where you rely heavily on skillchain. <b>And there are a lot of fight in endgame needing Skillchain-Magic Burst.</b>
- can sub /WAR for double attack, enhancing their TP gain
- can sub /THF for SATA+WS, making their spike damage higher

2. Unpopular job with very low quality traits/ability or low identity
DRK :
- actually a good DD. <b>Master of Atk</b>. Equip wise, they are the same as Warrior. <b>They are much better in atk+ trait/ ability, but don't have any natural acc+ trait/ability</b>
- can sub /WAR for double attack, enhancing their TP gain
- can sub /THF for SATA+WS, making their spike damage higher

DRG :
- high soloability
- <b>little acc+ and atk+ trait</b>
- can sub /WAR for double attack, enhancing their TP gain
- can sub /THF for SATA+WS, making their spike damage higher
- <b>Is there any fight where jumps are highly essential?</b> make such battle exist!

RNG :
- Master of accuracy. But seeing the ranged accuracy performance right now... I can say it's <b>ironic</b>
- can sub /WAR for atk+ up, <b>BUT low HP and defense make their survivability very low</b>
- can sub <b>/NIN</b> for higher survivability after Sidewinder/ Slug Shot, but <b>no atk+ trait/ability at all</b>. This <b>forces ranger to eat attack food</b> for acceptable damage. But given the <b>ranged accuracy is broken</b>, what can they expect?
- subing /WAR gives <b>no benefit in double attack</b> since almost no RNG go melee-heavy right now
- very essential at kited mob fight. <b>BUT what are the mobs that (highly) need to be kited in the game? King Behemoth, Chlevnik, and Kirin. That are the only 3 as far as I can think</b>

The bold part is the important part... they should've reconsider balancing them through all the job

So we tried again Divine Might. Thanks for Ryusuizen encouraging me getting the members... Though I made wolfblood upset in the end m_(__)_m. Just remember me I still have to pay you on september if you still haven't got this one

"event","it's funny how I found people in forum lately are posting a similar question which I had just answered less than 2 weeks ago, maybe there even 2 similar questions asked with the relevant title. People should use search button if they have access to the feature.. or at least.. browse at least 3 first pages.. it won't take so long or taking so much time loading 2 more pages of list of thread.. heck I even recommend people browse first 5-7 pages if there is similar question being asked.

3 similar topics in 5 pages... it's really annoying.

These people are just... too lazy to use their brain. and those who are more knowledgeable are seems to be their slaves of gathering information. I'd prefer forum = discussion place. not for asking particular question where it has been answered a while ago. A forum should be neatly packed with good arguments and information, so users can browse for particular information easily w/o neccessarily see any stupid arguments. And I really hate it when it becomes flaming place *point KI*

someday.. let there be 100 similar topics with 900 other non-distinct topics in the first 5 pages where 80% of the content is hardly a opinion-based argument (wrong opinion. yeah, a wrong one )

anyway.. gotta study for monday and wednesday midterm

what now? I got even careless what's happening on pandemonium. I currently have the least motivation ever going back to the game.
my RL is better than what I experienced in FFXI : no daily drama, no need to think about inflation, no need to deal with some retarded people. and I feel I gained something more per time in RL rather than in FFXI.

I need to catch up with my relatives too in term of RL achievement. my far cousin got accepted in microsoft singapore directly below the command of the director. my other cousin will be accepted in the job after he completed 1~3 months training and will have nice salary too.
yeah, I have the potential. I just don't wanna let this troublesome thing snag my real goal

So, simply said : I don't have any intention going back to the game
... at least for now, I'd say so"

by 28th january I suspended my account for the 3rd(?) time...

like to give some comment about RNG post patch. end game xp/merit PT invite seems to be very few compared to pre-patch
everybody now prefer WAR and MNK for DD. But, I only wanted to say that being a WAR or a MNK is definitely not an-auto-self-uber like people think in pre patch RNG

RNGs just now need more money to spend on better ammo, and gear, like WARs and MNKs were. but I'm thinking to be the best WARs, MNKs, DRKs, or <insert any awesome DD job here> , you'll need to spend more on the gear rather than you'll need to spend if you're aiming to be the best RNG (exclude relic weapons please)"

by far, I can only think bow is the best weapon for this fight all round, perhaps you'll need to use gun for mammet (because you'll have to try to keep the fighting areal small). I never got AoE with bow and never pulled hate either (i don't use any sidewinder till it turns crazy)"

and today I broke naelandra's Odorous knife. I thought the knife is lv 70 synth so it'll be ok. but meh >.<
so I paid her back because I said yes and yet failed the synth
Bontaru asked me next after I broke naelandra's knife and I said ok, but I may not even have enough money to replace. so to be safe I ran to sandy blacksmithing guild and get adv. support. It was a success. 50k for me ^^. Thanks Bontaru

so what are the important things happened?
<lj-cut text=""question about kurrea fight"">
yeah, since Emilee got the trousers, I asked her how the fight went. basically the prime thing is 
1. bring kurrea far away from the pop.
2. SC - MB to deplet its HP fast. otherwise it'll come back to pop place and eat another buff every 30 secs

now to get that tav. ram meat.
oh and thanks for the Diatryma meat, Yunii. I appreciate that.

I'd really like to do it on last 2 weeks of December, anywhere on there. I hope I can get people for this

wait... I forgot to mention osode? mmm I don't think I need it because:

(no etude)

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v493/vzx/051028_sky_05.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
(with +STR etude )

yeah.. so +40 STR is what I got from 2x STR etude. if I didn't get that, my +STR is 18 (sole sushi), so that's about +22 STR bump up
and I did STR swapping when doing PPA sidewinder, giving +14 more STR, so the total is +54 STR to sidewinder the suzaku

but the number only gone up by 50 at most and that's coming from 14 extra STR :/

on the other hand I tried the coeurl sub on seiryu and got 572 Sidewinder on it. 
416 vs 472 = over 160 damage up, moreover suzaku is greater bird where ranged damage should be doing more damage on it.
so the answer still the same for max damage >.> racc+ on equip / merit combat skill and +atk food when fighting

watch out for the bushes...

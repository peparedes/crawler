"event","wow. so my dad put the laptop on his credit card, and i pay him
monthly. i move into my apartment on the 27, but im leaving on the 23
bc i can't stand my parents. ha ha ha. <br>
well i mean, i just keep getting into fights with them. today i went to
ikea and i got a futon mattress for my awesome futon my sister made me.
and a desk! its so awesome, i mean it has a place for everything. those
ikea people must think a lot, i want to work for them. it has a place
built in, like a little wall you can write on with eraser marker, and
its magnetic, and it has a place for cd's and dvd's and books and odds
and ends, on i fell in love at first sight. <br>
<br>
yesterday was my last day at work. it went alright. im going there
tonight to treat my parents to dinner for their birthdays. yeah they
are getting pretty old, its a good thing all their kids are grown up
and a grandkid has popped out already. <br>
my weird boyfriend bought a new house by his new college, in his new
town. (no need to say im jealous i think you could pick that up
yourself) hes all about that right now... yeah.. <br>
i have been so lucky, since i only worked three days this week i got to
hang out with people i should have hung out with a long time ago. like
katie fitzerwack, and katie rielly and becky and julie, and christa!
awesome times. i went ot kings dominion and then katie and i went
shopping for back to school, she saved me a whole ten dollars! what
about that 'ish? don't you wish she could do that for you?!?! <br>
im in a really good mood if you havne't noticed. <br>
<br>
i opened up a bank of america account the other day. i feel so old, i
dind't even have my dad go with me, i set it up myself. i get checks
with this account, and i get to sign my name and everything, and the
card will have my little picture on the bottom of it. wahoo. <br>
<br>
dude, i haven't packed, at all. my room looks so messy, but i have to
have it straight before i leave otherwise that will be something that
my mom will get on my everytime i talk to her, ... even though i will
have no power over it cuz im at college... <br>
<br>
i got a new phone, its sooo pretty. maybe this one will last, i don't
think ill throw this one into the air, or throw it against the wall, or
drop it into a cup of water(haha danielle), or let donut fungus grow in
the charger part. i made a promise to it that i woudln't let anything
happen to it, like nemo's dad did in the beg. of finding nemo. yeah, im
weird. but its so ... confusing, it has alot of colors in everything
and its so complex... maybe summer and the blonde has gotten to me and
i have sunken to a new low of stupidity.<br>
<br>
last minute hang out time ends on the 22,tomorow, bc i think i have to dedicate all of monday packing. <br>
call my cell bc again...i have very few numbers.<br>"

"event","<P>SO, i haven't updated in awhile. I've been working a lot, not that it shows in my paycheck. I went to NJ the other week, i swear i thought it would get easier throughout the summer, but everytime i see that boy it gets harder to walk away. I went to OC just this past day and it was cool. </P>
<P>I've come to the conclusion that im not the person i was when i left charles county. I still haven't made the decision if its a good thing or not. I don't have any problem with who i am now, except for the fact that i don't mesh as well with some people that i did before. I haven't even seen katie fitz since i have been back. Weird or no? I mean its my fault. But my point is even though everyone says it, ""oh college isn't gonna get between us"" it does. (this doesn't have to do with any particular person, in general). I just don't even know who i am when i am down here, i am living two seperate lives, i think everyone who goes far away to college does. Its different people, different environment, rules, priorities... two different worlds. When i come down here i don't fit it where i used to, and its been driving me up the wall this summer. I don't feel right around people bc i don't know how to feel. </P>
<P>I thought identity crisis' were when i came to school with mix matched clothing or avril-like clothes. I've never heard of it when you are going into your second year of college. But thats whats goign on with me right now. I feel like the only people that understand me, well the only person that understands me is bryan. Everythingi s just so weird for me right now. But goign to the beach, at night i went out there by myself and watched the waves and thought, until the cop told me i wasnt' allowed on the beach then. But in those few minutes i was i realized that i just want to have fun, i need to its summer after all. I can have fun by myself or with other people. I like both, so i am just gonna have fun, lose every ounce of drama that surrounds me and fill it with happy people, if you wanna do that too im your girl. I just really wanna have lunch with katie.</P>
<P>I wanna hang out with other people too, but like i said before i don't have your freakin number. Yeah thats you katie rielly and julie and becky. ha. So yeha hit me up, and hopefulyl i won't be losing my cell phone for a long time now. </P>
<P>wow it feels good to let some thoughts out.</P>"

"event","well i haven't had time to realyl use this thing. 
but i have a few funny stories that need to be logged.
this past weekend was awesome, very very awesome. I played softball and went fishing, played badminton, asshole (AND THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WEEKEND I WAS ONLY ASSHOLE ONCE, I WAS EVEN PRESIDENT AND VICE MANY OF TIMES...) football catch, and oh it was just awesome. 
**i also saw the movie CRASH, i seriously, seriously, recommend it to EVERYONE. its one of the best movies i've ever seen. seriously.
I got to spend five days with Bryan, now really, thats just awesome in itself.

Now for the real funny story... its the weirdest experience i have been in so far...
(sorry if this grosses anyone out, it wasn't my intention, but the point is hilarious)
ok so i have this big ""surgery"" thing to go to, so i get there and they take me to this room and they are like ok we need to check your body pulse and blood pressure and whatev. and so they do, then they put me in this rooma nd they said to change into scrubs, so i do, full scrubs, the ucky apron and the hair wrap and the footie things, and then they are like ok we are gonna go to the surgery room now, and im like cool and i start walkin and they are like no... sit in this chair, so i do, and they said lay back, and it lays out, and then roll me across the center into the surgery room like i can't walk or something, then they are like, are you ok to get on this bed? and im like yeah... and so i do, then they cover me with tons of blankets, and then they make me lay my arms out on either side one to constantly monitor my blood pressure and the other my pulse, and i saw my heartbeat on a machine and heard the beat and everything like i was on ER or something, then they put this sensor thing on my thigh, and a tourniquet around my ankle to cut off my circulatoin and then they make my foot an ugly color and then they put all those sheets on top so only the part of my foot shows, and then they do the injection of numbness and things start rollin, and its over in like ... 3 minutes
and all of that shit just for a fuckin wart, and they wouldn't let me walk again, and they bandaged it up to my ankle,like an inch thick,so i had to get the ucky blue shoe to walk in and i was laughing the WHOLE time bc it was hilarious the measures they went through for this
PLUS they gave me a prescription for tylenol codeine if the pain got to me
is that weird or what?!
so the first chance i had i ditched the shoe, got it rewrapped so i could where my work shoes, and it hasn't bothered me at all....

yeah so i have two jobs now. i really like the Gustavo's one, i haven't realyl technically started the other one, but tomorow i will... i am learning spanish from the mexican chef's, everyone there is realyl awesome and warm hearted, its a great place to work at i think. 

as you can see im in a really good mood. thats rare for the past couple of days so yeah. yay."

"event","well since all my college friends are doing their im home entry. i wanna re-do mine, bc it was whiny and yeah..
I didn't want to be home, lol. But i think now that i got back into the grove it will be ok. Its killing me being away from Bryan, i didn't realize it would be this hard. I didn't realize how much charles county could change. Its true, its not the same home i grew up in, people keep moving down here, and things keep popping outta the ground(things like buildings... not crops..)
I really didn't see much people from college until like.. friday, so seeing christa and julie and katie and becky, ... and beating them all at bowling [;)] was really fun for me. THEN i saw bobby and went to stephen mattingly's on saturday and saw matty and john and erica and carl and joey peel and *sigh* well just a lot of people and that was good times. SO i am doing good now. And i saw jessica on sunday, but we missed the chocolate covered strawberries. 
I am currently employed at Gustavo's. Come, eat, tip well, because i get 2% of that, lol. I am a bus girl/ soon to be food runner, so i can be a waitress one of these days.
I should be packing... but uhh what a procrastinator i am. My house is still a crazy mess, and everytime i try to clean something my mom yells at me. There was this random kid at my house, and i was watching her, and she punched me right above the boob, it hurt a lot. She was only three years old too, i wanted to punch her right back, but ever since i broke my phone i am learning to restrain myself...
yup, can't' wait til tomorow, back to dirty jersey for some good ol' campin. Im gonna stink..."

<br>
I was so excited about coming home. Its my first whole day home and i
am stuck in some bad situations. They all lead back to money problems.
I am really hoping i get this job, my interview is tomorow and i am
passive nervous. I am kinda mad that i missed the Finch concert, but it
also meant i got home sooner, and i guess its true, i didn't really
want to be driving three hours back that late. I am going camping with
Bryan and some of his frat dudes on memorial day weekend. Thats all i
have ot look forward to. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My house doesn't feel like home. There are so many
vehicles in the driveway, and people here non-stop bc my mom's dream of
fixing up the house has finally come true. My grandparents moved out of
their house to an assisted living space, since my grampa's been in
pretty bad shape. All the stuff my parents didn't want thrown out is
now in my house, not like we didn't have enough extra shit in here
already. Some rooms are half painted needing to be finished and
everything is just crazy. I wanted to cry bc i felt so ... not
belonging here. I was so afraid about the day i would come home and it
woudln't feel like ""home"", and that day was yesterday. I told my mom
today that i will paint the rooms if she gives me the color, i want to
help out as much as i can, bc i can see my dad is getting burnt out. I
also don't want bryan to come down here thinking i live in this wreck,
lol. Im growing up. Christan said that i have matured, just that im
different, she said it wasn't in a bad way but you know how ppl don't
want to put you down. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need this job, and another one. My dad took out a
14000 loan for this years tuition, and next year isn't going to be any
better, well it will bc im not living in the dorms, but i think i lost
my scholarship bc of my grades... I need to stay with tennis now, and
request for more money. And i need to get a weekend job up there too.
My dad said i am going to be paying for my rent, thats 300 a month. I
am going to be piss broke. Plus i need to pay for my ocean city trip
somehow. My truck is indeed broke again, i dind't even get to drive it.
I have to prolly find money to fix that too, since our mechanic is the
one here non-stop helping to close in our carport. I need money just to
get by for now too, my parents never gave me money, i always had a job,
and now i am broke trying to figure out how i am going to get by until
my first paycheck. Looks like i have to go to my sister again. I hate
being so dependent. I am going to be so busy, its a good thing though,
bc it will get my mind off missing bryan. <br>"

"event","<P>Wow. this past week has been so busy. Obviously, lol, i haven't even had enough time to put thought into updating my journal. I am so happy to say that studio and tennis is over. I wish my final review went a little better. Its not that i got bashed or anything, i didn't get to present half of my work because we ran out of time. I was really really mad about that. </P>
<P>Lets see.. i went rock climbing!!! This past week was spring week at our school, so they had fun activities going on throughout the week, like rock climbing, foam parties, and spring formal. I got up that wall so quick! I beat a lot of guys, GO GIRL POWER! haha, jk. I went to the spring formal because one of my friends won MS NJIT (go nikki ;)) so she got free tickets. It was ok. </P>
<P>I just realized that the formals New Jersey people had, even at their proms are totally different than ours. They get sit down dinners, and we have some meatballs on the side, lol. It happens i guess... </P>
<P>I have had the weirdest dreams lately, like ones that are so close to reality, like reliving what i did that day but in a different way, i can't seperate dreams from reality anymore. But last night i had a really bad dream, you could call it a nightmare actually. It was with strictly NJIT people, mostly the guys at NJIT. I was at some party and there were some really creepy guys that i have never seen before. They kept hitting on me, not the kind of ""hitting on"" that is like i want you, but the kind that is like im going to get you, whether you like it or not. They wouldn't let me be, or leave, i was stuck there. I kept looking for my guy friends but the only ones i could find i coudln't get near. I finally found one of my good friends, and he tried to get me out, but they killed him. It was really bad, i know this sounds so weird guys, but it seriously freaked me out. I woke up to an unsettling&nbsp;phone&nbsp;call, and couldn't get back to sleep. I am so freaked out by it.</P>
<P>So really... i don't have much to do here besides my math and CIS classes... and those end soon too, but my finals aren't til may 9 and 10. Then im still stuck here till the 14, but then ill be home for THREE WHOLE MONTHS!!! And i can go see my niece, and drive my truck, and relax. HAHA, no, find a fucking job lol. I need to work hardcore this summer. </P>
<P>But otherwise, im so happy.&nbsp; ;)</P>
<P>AND FOR ALL OF YOU WHO ARE MAD BECAUSE I DIDN'T CALL. WELL I AM SORRY! I REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TIME YESTERDAY UNTIL I WAS INFRONT OF A COMPUTER WAITING. </P>

"event","<P>ive been soo busy, actually im so busy right now i shouldn't be wasting my time on this, but sometimes writing helps me. </P>
<P>I had my mid review for my final prohect on monday, it went pretty well actually, i was in a good place, and then like... thursday it took a turn for the worst. Everyone around me has issues they are dealing with, so do I. I hate that because how are you supposed to help your friends when you can't even get your own life straight? </P>
<P>Lately everything has been tennis, tennis tennis. We had a match on wednesday, friday, saturday(today) and we have one tomorow. Im so aching. I guess the only good thing about it is im really improving, people always told me im inconsistent, and now i am very consistent.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I don't know when im going to get this archie work done, im trying now but im so tired i can't think. After my tennis match last night i did sneak in a girls night, because i needed it. I went with Amy and Hala to see Miss Congeniality 2 and it was pretty good. Then we went to some odd diner and had depressingly bad food and finally slept at Hala's house.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Im working backwards. Its been a beautiful week. Maybe thats why im so unfocused on my work. I have alot due on monday, grr. I cna't believe my final is in less than two weeks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;But i would like to declare one thing. I've met a guy, and everything has been quite--- <EM>quite</EM> well.&nbsp; Im in the ""giddy"" stage and i think thats the only thing keepin me going now. // :) \\</STRONG> </P>"

"event","oh how i wish i enjoyed this weekend, i have been busy. Busier than if it was a regular weekday... It was irritating, missed the best party of the year... and had tennis which was ok. Im still debating on if i want to do it next semester. Im sitting here in studio with one shoe on because the other got a major knot in it by ONO. THANKS. Im on the verge of being done, i just have to finalize my renders and put my auto cad drawings into corel, then into my power point
Im just nervous about the review i guess. My crit says there are going to be like 4 other dudes there, which is annoying since its just a mid review. But atleast no print outs!
I also only have a 10 oclock class tomroow so i can work on it then too. So its not that bad,... just FUCKING IRRITATING! I've had enough. 
The nurse here is so stupid, i went there the other day because my eye was swollen, and she was like oh you prolly got hit(because i was wrestling with the guys) and she said to put ice on it, so i did. But it got worse, a couple days later it looked almostl ike i got punched, so i went back, and i saw the doctor this time, and she was like oh you have a stye... have you been putting heat on it? and i was like no the nurse told me to put ice on it,... and she was like yeah you've been doing the wrong thing. So because of her stupidity, it escalated to this. I had to go buy eyedrops,a nd the lady woudln't accept my insurance number so i had to pay full price, which was 17 dollars for a bottle the size of my fucking thumb... Pissy day i must say, never got better either... It was good like... on wednesday when christan and bobby came, miss them already. PEOPLE SHOULD COME VISIT MORE OFTEN___ ITS FUN TIMES.... i swear i will put up pictures soon, i just gotta find my USB cable... ah im a mess..."

"event","<P>So my tennis match was in southern pennsylvania on saturday, so my sister and mom drove up and got me. I got to be home for easter!! I tried to see as many people as i could on saturday, but it sucked because i got back at like... 830, so my time was limited. I saw jessica and jessica, and that was really nice to catch up with them. I saw Katieeee and her bro, and we watched kill bill, i forgot how scary it can be. And i saw danielle, christan, and bobby. I can see they are shutting me out already. the one night i come home and christan spends it with bobby instead of me... whatev! lol. Its so weird, when i come home, i love spending time with my friends, but when im just driving around in my car i feel so... outta place, or its realyl weird, like something is missing. Im so scared of the day that i go home, and its not home anymore. Thats like my greatest fear because i love it soo o o o O much. But then i woke up butt ass early on sunday and went to church. The church that i used to go to when i was a wee little pickle. It got renovated since then, Leena Vansickle was there so i said hi, and guess what? She went there when she was little too, she remembered me. It just goes to show that i really don't remember much from growing up, my memory is SHOT. Then i went to my grammas for dinner. It was a suprise for well everyone because they didn't know i was coming down. My gramma from the other side and my uncle and aunt from the other side came, and so did my aunt and uncle from this side. It was so cool seeing everyone, especially since i haven't seen my uncle and aunt much when i was growin up because they were in nevada. It was really an awesome dinner, awesome food and dessert. Then i played pool with my dad and uncle and sis' and my uncle kicked my ass. Everytime i was about to get a shot in he would block it. He said ""grace its a dog eat dog world out there, and you're wearing milkbone underwear."" hehehehe I also beat my sister in GIN which by the way never happens. But she won the 2 outta 3. Then i hopped on my greyhound and went to newark. It was PACKED, and the traffic was really built up, but i was only like... half an hour late, lol. Got back, went to studio... and then slept.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There is the play by play if anyone wanted to read. Sorry i flooded your friends page.</P>"

It used to be that i loved tuesdays and wednesdays because i get out of classes early so i can semi enjoy the rest of the day. Now its all this leftover work i have to do then, i really don't have much time to breath up here. I do today tho! My tennis match got cancelled, so the only thing we do have is practice, and thats why its 3 pm and i still have my pj's on. So yeah, i am movin' on and it feels pretty good. My critic likes my studio work progress, and just wishes for a little more, *sigh* it will come, lol.

well my awesome NJ people came down with me, and even had enough guts to eat dinner with my family at captain billy's, the troopers they are.. i <3 them. saturday i was with juls and christan. and sunday i was with my mom and went to baltimore city with christan(supposed to be steven, but hes gay) missed the show, went to eat, almost got in a bad accident, but it was oh so fun. picturs im sure will be here later.
i think whats eating me is the fact that... ill come out with it. Danny isn't coming home this summer, so basically everythign that i've held onto for the past... few months, haha really 6 months is... useless. Don't start anything you can't finish, just one word of advice. But yeah, im tired, and need a good nights sleep..."

I don't know, it just seems like even though college life up here is realyl exciting and im meeting alot of people i still feel like i ""lived"" up my life a lot, or as much as one could, when i was at home. I think its that i can't drive up here, its driving me crazy. I might be able to bring my truck up here next fall... who knows *crosses fingers*. ONE MORE DAY TIL HOME! cannot wait, its been dragging here, but not so much. Will came to visit, and not everything went as planned(does anythign?) but it still worked out. Ive been thinking about next year and when i move into the apartment off campus,... even though its really really incredibly close to campus, im not gonna be able to just get in the dorms and hang out like now... its gonna be different. Mike isn't gonna be able to wake me up every morning, im prolly just going to lose my relationship with him as a whole. That got me worried, i mean first Will, one of my best friends up here leaves, then Mike and i won't talk as much, and he is my other good good friend up here.. whats next?

<P>Good news? I challenged a couple girls on the tennis team and won, so i was supposed to be playing number six singles yesterday, but the number five girls couldn't come, so i played 5 and i won! and i still won my doubles match! so that means im UNDEFEATED in doubles (3-0) and singles (1-0). Also there was this dude there that offered me a job to teach little kids tennis, crazy cool, extra mula! Im just happy theres only 5 more days til i go home. I cannot wait, i will be busy though. That sunday i have to go see the coolest band ever, and then on wednesday i have a tennis match in philly, and somewhere in between there i have to go to NC to visit my sister and niece... so if you wanna do something better book it quickly... so sad, i wish i had two weeks home, or hey FOREVER! ok i lie, i love college, but i wish it was closer to home, and a couple of other things... </P>"

She was kinda like an added gramma, always came to our family stuff, snuck me money, and made me update her about my life. I never thought she'd die anytime soon, then again its not something i think about. This just makes me want to go home even more. I can't, i have tennis, i can't make the funeral or the viewing. Im not ready for my relatives to start dying, its not like i can ask god to wait. I am in college, i barely got to see them when i was home. I like spending time with them, but everyone has such busy lives, i wish there was some kinda way we all dind't get so wrapped up in other things to realize hey your missing out and need to be with your family. 
I haven't lost someone close to me since i was in second grade and my grampa died. He was the coolest, but i was too young then to understand. Now i do and its awful. Its just a big shock to me, but everythings gonna be ok."

I am gonna be my happy usual self. *sigh* relief is in the air. And what relief it is, being that spring break is only 2 weeks away. I really do miss everyone too, so yeah *sigh* happiness surrounds me at this point.... except this snow thing. thie only good thing about snow sometimes is that it cancells class, and well... it hasn't helped me get out of my 830's, so at this point, i am calling it a waste. But it has gotten me out of tennis practice, which is a plus."

so i don't understand some people, if you make an excuse it better be good. Or just tell me the real deal. I got screwed over in a way i didn't think i would be. Some of it might have been my fault, but i had my corners covered, cept one. In the big picture, its prolly like a gift from god that it happened. But right now it kinda sucks, makes me look like the loser. But some people are good at that, kinda like its their job. Ill be ok, its not worth it, and yeah.

"event","ah the feeling of the night before a projects due. its been awhile. im glad to say i didn't pull an ""all nighter"", but a ""half nighter"" plus i don't have an 830, so iwill get a respectable amount of sleep. (as respectable as you can get). wish me luck guys, all ive heard and gotten was criticism. so i kinda see the outlook for tomorow. who cares right about now, i just need to get this done, study for my math test, practice till one and crash till my test on friday. then relax and then crash til my tennis match saturday. its like so busy for me this week. gahness."

to prove how much i love home i went through great measures... 
missed tennis practice
missed the big trip to NYC with AST
missed my saturday studio
my project is due next thursday
math test next day
im sick
ran (literally) across campus
$145 train expenses
just to get home. and i have to say, it was all worth it. the banquet rocked. i decided to be the good person and stay sober, for the most part, and i have to say seeing your cheif and old guys get in on the dance floor...and ""take it to the floor"" and remember it.. yeah thats fun
being home without danny makes me sad though. so poop."

"event","<P>since valentines day is approaching, and i am in a bad mood, i thought i would declare my thoughts on valentines day now....</P>
<P>love is a crazy thing. some say its a devotion to another person, a feeling. you can feel loved, be in love, make love, give love... all those things. but to actually know what love is is unnatainable. I being me, haven't been in love, and i don' t know when i will be. I ""love"" my friends and sisters, to the point that i know. I ""love"" my family. But to be able to put those feelings into words is the problem for me, and most of the world. </P>
<P>They say you only fall in love once, ha. i don't think so. I thought i was once, nah, definetly not. I think i will be soon... but who knows when people don't call. </P>
<P>This was going to be the first time that i thought i wouldn't care what happened on vday, i would get a call, i knew i would, and i would be perfectly happy. To be honest im giving a lot up now, in hopes that it will all pay off for summer. I don't think i will get a call on Vday, and I can't really be mad, hes a busy person. </P>
<P>But here i am goign crazy over something thats still a week away. I was going to be fine, and i will be, its just all this Vday love is getting in the air and catching the sorrow love bug. </P>
<P>Don't worry, i brought my anti vday shirt, so i will be rockin that on monday. HA</P>"

"event","i really just want to go home. and when i am, my parents or sister aren't even going to be there. i miss them. i miss my family. im tellin you guys, seriously you don't need to go to a school that far away. a few hours will cover you. i miss the way my dad makes stupid jokes, they way my mom pushes me to be the best, and the way my siser takes me away on the weirdest adventures. the way i could spend my time with myself and think. the way everything was perfect when everything wasn't. i cannot wait. but unfortunately that feeling cna't happen until summer when i see danny... maybe spring break?????  hahahah or not bc architecture is lethal at this school
see you guys in a million years..."

"event","<P>haha i wish i had motivation. im working on it. i really wish i had my computer in my room. i can't believe how scummy some people can be. some people are gonna die... well close to it. i never realized how much it hurts me when i see my friends hurt. i hate it, i just wanna hurt those piece of shits. </P>
<P>im going in circles. im not a good person. all lies, i just wish i could go back. </P>
<P>ive discovered in this world everyone is a scumbag, everyone is a sinner, nobody is better than anyone else. </P>
<P>have you ever thought about people who get hurt, and the person who hurts them?</P>
<P>lately i have realized that even though i was the one always getting hurt, that sometimes its not the hardest position. i think its harder being the one that hurts people. Think about it, you get hurt too, and you can't just get over it, other people hate you bc of what you do, and the guilt just piles up. those are my scattered random thoughts. </P>

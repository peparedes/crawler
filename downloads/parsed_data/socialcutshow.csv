remember when everyone was either a preppy kid or a ghetto kid, and if you were punk rock people thought u were gay?

and now its all punk rock kids and like 9 preppy kids who the punk rock kids think are gay.

and its fucking retarded.

im looking at a 400 dollar order to american eagle that is my near future.

theres a big fuck you going out from me to every emo/hardcore/punkrock/ska kid who think that the only way they can gain the recognition as that stereotype is to dress that way. fuck you. a big fuck you.

you dont need a studded belt to listen to hawthorne heights, or face makeup to listen to marylin manson.

1. big effing trip this weekend. pretty much the highlight of my entire life to hang out with Tom Kalnoky (and if you dont know who he is,and more importantly the reason he is so amazing, your a fucktard and i dont want to know you)
2. me and the wife have finally gotten the divorce. its not on the good terms i have always planned it to be on, but hey. there isnt too much i can do about that. the second i realized that i didnt want this was when i asked myself ""if you saw her with someone else would it make you mad"", and that answer took about 3 seconds to come up with. partially because i was watching Stroker & Hoop, and its 4:44am....i think if it was under different circumstances, i would've gotten the world record.
3.drums.
good ol' drums.
lets just say im comin back to my baby.
4.CCRider show on Halloween. Pearl Street. all my fucking friends better be going ( oh they will, watch me hassle their asses til then)
5.Arial. 
Good ol' Arial.
Lets just say they are looking for a new drummer and we know each other. it'll be fun to start playing out again.

other things on the horizon-
driving soon!
contacts coming soon!
ear piercing! wicked hardcore!
i need to buy some new ska cd's!
emo music is still for fucktards (which is my new favorite word)!
Home Movies got moved to 5:30 am on monday mornings. guess what time im getting up now.

be back soon with more awesome updates.

I loaded 52(i counted) of my cd's onto my iTunes this past week...but for the past few days all have been listening to is Keasbey Nights.

""Keasbey Nights""(for those of you who dont know, and if you didnt know this, then your probably someone i hate...excluding gothy) is Catch22's first cd, and it was written entirely (lyrics, horn lines, everything) By TOM fucking KALNOKY who is a big inspiration to me and some of my friends...he is just an absolutley amazing musician. 

so anyway, he wrote this entire cd when he was a junior/senior in highschool, and it is highly proclaimed as one of the best SKA albums ever (the best ever according to TAANG is Turn the Radio Off by RBF, and i dont think anyone could deny that)

getting best ska album ever is like the biggest compliment ever. and he did it in his highschool days.

Knowing that your company is vegan-friendly, it will be a real pleasure to
work with you guys!  We talked to our label and everything's cool.  All the

From now on, I'll be the one in charge.  Mart is too busy working on other

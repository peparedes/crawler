2:05- we are getting just a little hungry.. we walk around looking in the little shops in new orleans square when we find a mime.. he ""talks"" to us.. then he tell us he has a surprise for us.. he takes us upstairs.. (ok i'd be creeped out if it wasn't disneyland haha..) we get a happy birthday phone call from goofy.. how fun is that?? then he takes us to the balcony overlooking new orleans square and we sing happy birthday.. some people sang with us other just stared at us.. ha..

3:15- we try to go on splash mountain but hillary and i don't feel to good.. so we just walked around looking for a more calm ride.. which means that we also by pass thunder mountain.. so yeah.. we notice that the line is short for peter pan is short.. so we hop right in.. then we get into this big discussion about divorce.. man.. pilar needs jesus.. muy importante....

4:00- we head to toon town.. (we looked for boat boy but he was on his break or something).. we took some pictures in toon town but then pilar ran out of film so we didn't have too much else to do there.. and we were a little big for the rides and stuff.. so we just decided to head out.. 

4:30- we walked all the way to tomorrowland to go on space mountain again.. but its broke.. so we do the honey i shrunk the audience thing.. ha.. i love it when the rats climb on you.. we had a deep converstation about kissing.. and hillary, ""likes ryan!!""

4:55- we decide it would be really cute to go on the storybook land thing at night.. just as the sun is setting.. so yeah.. its cool.. we didn't see boat boy so we are a little disappointed.. i want pilar to talk to him.. it'd be great.. haha.. chelsie says that he helped us out of the boat but i don't know.. we got to sit in the front and everyone sang to us again.. 

5:15- we are running out of time.. walking around looking for something to do.. so we decide to do indiana jones again.. our last ride.. but on the way there we remember that we didn't do the jungle cruise yet.. so yeah.. it was fun.. our tour guide was hillarious.. except he had done the same jokes like 100 times already so his delivery wasn't too great.. ha.. but it was fun.. and then we went on indiana jones again.. no line at all.. and there was this really cute guy with an indiana jones hat on.. points for hillary.. haha.. 

6:00- we head back toward the front.. just as we get to the locker area it starts to rain.. hillary is starting to get sick.. chelsie takes her to the bathroom and pilar and i go to buy candy.. but she gets an umbrella instead.. then we meet the huntsingers and we call my mom.. she's on her way.. 

6:30- we leave the park.. my feet hurt.. we start singing songs in really strained voices.. people think we are freaks.. we stand out front waiting for my mom.. pilar stands with hillary while she throws up and me and chels just talk about random things.. 

6:45- my mom finally comes to get us.. we are wet, cold, and hungry..

man.. this weekend.. i'm still feeling it.. i'm even skipping swim practice so i can catch up on the sleep here.. ahh.. let see.. 

saturday: i picked up chelsie and we went to the leg rally.. it was really cool.. i'm glad that we went.. walking around camarillo looking for dumb stuff.. nice.. sorta like the hfc yunky only on a really small scale.. and then we went bowling.. and yeah.. cool cool.. so later that night was sadies.. i picked everyone up around 6 and we got our pictures done.. i think i looked stupid but i really don't care.. and then we attempted to have dinner.. yeah.. we had to wait 45 minutes for a table at fridays.. but we didn't know it was going to be that long.. but whatever.. the food was ok.. and then we headed to the dance.. yeah the music was weird.. and the lights made me really sick.. i thought i was going to puke.. yeah it was nice.. haha.. so yeah.. and then we went to lazer star.. fun fun.. i'd of rather have went to bed, but it was still cool.. oh yeah.. then i broke curfew while trying to take everyone home.. haha.. 

sunday: choir practice.. fun fun.. actually i did have fun.. i love our music.. its the coolest.. except for those dumb actions.. i have no clue how mrs. wilkinson expects me to do them.. i can't sing and move at the same time.. :) so yeah then it was time for kim's party.. but i didn't want to go because i was mad at chels.. so i just stopped by and we swaped presents.. and then chelsie and hillary came over about 9:30.. we got all ready for disneyland.. it was soo much fun.."

"event","tonight was seriously the best.. ok not like ""the best"" but it was soo totally awesome that i can't even explain it.. we all met at chelsie's at 4:15.. poor chels.. hillary kinda left her hanging there on the hair deal.. but i think she turned out looking really super cute.. i think we all looked nice.. even jonathan.. i have to admit he looked really good in his tux.. ha.. so then the parents took picture after picture after picture.. like seriously.. my mom took 2 rolls.. man.. but i'm sure it will be worth it.. 

so then we all piled into the '87 suburban and drove to the school to get the professional photos done.. there was soo many people there.. so we had to change our dinner reservations to a later time.. but it all worked out.. dinner was interesting.. i had never been there so i didn't know what was good or anything like that.. so i closed my eyes and picked whatever.. yeah, i really didn't like it.. it was sorta weird.. but whatever.. it was ok, i guess.. i'm just too picky.. you know me.. the dinner was really nice though.. the chairs were a bit stiff but still.. it was soo cute.. i wish i had a picture of us all in our formals, holding hands, and saying grace.. cute cute.. 

so after dinner we walked around old town camarillo for a bit.. actually, we just walked to the church and said hello to whoever was there and took some pictures in the courtyard.. then we headed to the dance.. 

man.. i hate dancing soo much.. and the awful music that they play there.. it was horrible.. but i tried to have fun despite the fact that i was extremly uncomfortable there.. but jonathan seemed to understand that so it was ok.. we danced to a few slow songs together and that was really nice.. chels and jimmy seemed to REALLY enjoy it.. haha.. woo hoo chels.. getting a little close there.. 

so after hillary's court dance soul train thing we left the dance for bowling.. that was really fun.. bowling in our formals and sparkly socks.. how cute.. i wish we could have stayed there longer but whateer.. it was fun.. except for the drunk people that were in the lane next to us.. they were scary..

so after bowling we all came back to my house for breakfast.. my mom went all out.. it looked like a mini buffet at the hilton or something.. she set up that little food warmy thing and had eggs, bacon and sausage, and hash browns in there.. and then she had a bread basket and toaster set out.. there was like 3 types of bagels, bread, and energy bread things, and little muffins and stuff.. and she set up a drink cart thing and there was coconut fruit bowls and.. man.. it was soo awesome.. my mom is the greatest.. 

so after our 12:45 breakfast ryan and jimmy sang to chels and hillary.. david, jonathan, and i sat in the kitchen and laughed our butts off.. haha.. it was super cute of them, but absolutely hilarious to us.. and then everyone left.. 

and just when i thought the night could not be more great.. josh calls.. at 2 am.. haha.. actually i'm talking to him at the moment.. so i should go now.. to concentrate on my hunky man.. haha.. barf.. kidding kidding.. ahh.. i am soo sleepy.. but too happy to sleep... :)"

i'm all ready.. and let me be the first to say, i look gorgeous.. kidding kidding.. i love my dress.. its really what i wanted.. i bought 2 other dresses, but i am going to take them back since i didn't like them.. i don't know.. but whatever.. i am more than happy with what i have now.. its a hot pink sorta shiny ball skirt and then i just got a plain stretch black spagetti strap.. kinda high black sandles.. and a necklace and a bracelet with little pink flowers of it.. its really nice.. and a little flowery body tattoo for my retardo muscular back.. :) 

and like i spent forever on my makeup.. ok, not forever but i wanted it to look really nice.. i lined my eyes in a black pencil, which i never do, so i think that was cool.. and then i had a silver glitter liner thing that i used and this awesome pink shadow.. ahh.. its soo cute.. ok i bet you are getting really bored with this, but whatever.. its my night, let me have it.."

"event","i love my hair.. it was sorta expensive, but i absolutely love it.. its soo cute.. and it's like exactly what i had wanted.. i saw pilar at the supercuts so i asked her to help me with ideas.. she wanted me to pick something simple, but i really liked this one thing with a french twist in the back and like 8 sections in the front and then curls.. its soo pretty, i'll show you pictures when i get them.. so that's what i had done.. it took forever though.. like and hour and a half.. and i have about a half pound of wax and gel and then a whole can of hairspray in my head.. i'm serious.. if i'm not careful, my head could spontainiously combust.."

"event","i can't believe its finally here.. seriously, i have been waiting for this weekend for such a long time.. so today was the beginning.. well actually the whole week was the beginning.. each day had a theme to get ready for it.. pretty stupid i think, so today was like the first major day.. starting with the rally.. 

it was soo cute.. the homecoming court is soo adorable.. so they did their whole presentation and stuff.. way cute.. and then they announced the entire varsity football team.. hello.. that took like 10 minutes.. well at least 5.. there is like 50 people on the team.. seriously.. but all in all it was really fun.. 

and then afterschool my mom took me to target so i could stuff to make our homecoming supply bags.. i'm soo smart.. they had a camera, socks (to go bowling in), body shimmer, and a cute little keychain.. oh yeah, and gum for after our stinky italian dinner.. and then we all headed over to the football game.. 

it was a really good game.. not that i really follow football much or anything, but it was highly entertaining.. and we WON!! woo hoo.. and then they did another court presentation thing.. it was soo nice.. hillary and her daddy looked soo cute.. and ava looked absolutely gorgeous.. ok, hillary, you looked absolutely gorgeous too.. :) 

so after that we all went over to chelsie's house to go swimming.. it was freezing out.. thankfully the pool was heated though.. so it was nice.. better than i thought it would have been, but thankfully we aren't doing it after the dance.."

"event","guess what i had for breakfast.. a big bowl of rocky road ice cream with chocolate syrup.. yum yum.. i'm such a pig.. anyways today was pretty uneventful.. i had choir practice this afternoon.. fun fun.. mrs. wilkinson was on the women's retreat so jimmy lead the music.. interesting!! man i really love our cantada.. its soo cool.. its called ""CODE RED- Christmas in the ER"".. its super cool.. and the songs are soo fun.. i'll tell you more about it later..

 and then after that we all sat in the rec hall and tried to do our homework.. jimmy and i had our first tutoring session.. except he didn't know he was suppossed to help me so he wasn't much help.. he needed to have brushed up on the material, so he was lost.. and i didn't get anything done.. so i am going to get another ZERO tomorrow.. oh well, just another one to add to the list.. 

so after that we picked pilar up and i tutored her in geometry for a little bit.. i wasn't much of a help considering i could only help for 45 minutes.. and freshman year was soo long ago.. whatever.. i tried.. so then i went back to church for youth group.. 

there was a really good message today.. about lies and how we fall victim to them.. it was awesome.. and the music was great.. (i got to stand by nate so it was even better).. then we ate homemade pretzels and played sardines again.. its getting a little old, but its always fun.. haha.. 

homecoming is in 6 days.. i'm soo excited.."

"event","ahhhh.. well first an update from last night.. we lost.. can you believe that? well one of our best guys was injured on the second play, so we were really struggling.. but we didn't lose by that much.. but after the football game we all came back to my house.. my mom made soo much food for us.. so we played pool and ate and ate.. and then we decided to watch a knights tale.. well i sorta fell asleep, but everyone else watched it.. jimmy and jonathan left about 12:45 and chels and hillary went home at 1:30 when the movie was over.. i felt bad because i fell asleep but i was super tired.. 

anyways so i didn't get up until like 10 this morning because i was exhausted.. and we left for northridge around noon.. i love the northridge mall.. soo cool.. man, we looked for like 2 hours for a dress.. but i just didn't see anything that i really liked.. so i just picked this one black dress.. its nice nothing great but whatever.. its sorta not me.. but whatever.. its black and i basically never wear black because its soo plain.. but i got some glittery eyemake and jewelry so, i think it will look ok.. i'll post pictures later..

and then we just shopped around for normal stuff after that.. i got some cute pants for 8 bucks.. so i'm happy.. and then my dad took us out to dinner at the outback.. blah blah.. he has eaten there like 8 million times..

"event","woo hoo.. today is our rio mesa football game.. they are soo going to lose that it is not even funny.. i am serious.. (hopefully) ok so today was pretty great.. actually its been awesome soo far.. i woke up at 530 for morning workout.. it felt great.. i had swam 2.2 miles before most people even got up.. WOW!! so then i had to rush to get ready and dry my hair in the hand dryer.. so it looked pretty awful.. but who cares.. so i was pretty chipper most of the morning.. and we had a sub in spanish class so we just played around a lot.. ryan reidmiller wanted people to touch the bar in his chest.. haha.. that was the best part of the day.. kidding kidding.. 

so then we had our rio mesa/homecoming court rally.. pretty funny.. the cheerleaders and football players did this stupid dance/cheer thing like they were pretending to be the rio team.. it was pretty sad.. and worst of all i saw kyle gunther's butt.. gross!! (he was wearing a red and black lace thong)

ok so anyway.. they announced homecoming court and guess who is sophomore princess??? hillary.. isn't that the coolest.. (she's chelsie's sister and like a super good friend of mine) so, i think its soo cool that i get to go to homecoming with the princess.. 

well pilar is coming over soon so we can get ready for the game.. and then afterward everyone is coming to my house to watch a movie and play pool.. should be fun.. well, gotta go..

"event","man.. i haven't updated this thing in a while.. i've been a little busy.. i have soo much to catch you up on.. let see.. 

i injured my lower back and tailbone doing yoga.. what a dork i am.. i guess i should stay away from all that ancient stuff.. actually it was adapted yoga so it had nothing to do with relgion or worshipping the sun but its still weird.. so i had to stop swimming this week because it hurt soo bad.. that was pretty cool, but i really needed to have been at the pool since i have a meet in less than a month.. ahh.. 

hmm.. i got 2 grade referals in the mail.. man.. i am doing soo bad in school.. there are too many people in the classes so there really is no teaching that does any good.. and math and chemistry are impossible to teach to yourself.. man jocy.. you have a quiz over balancing equations?? i had one of those the first day of school.. now we are doing really weird stuff in the stoichometry chapter.. i don't get it at all.. AP chemistry sucks.. 

but despite all that.. today was pretty awesome.. pilar and chels came over after school and we got ready for dinner and the football game.. fun fun.. and then we met everyone for dinner at texas cattle company.. it was fun.. there was like 15 of us there.. 

and then my mom drove half of us and ryan's mom drove the other half of us to the football game.. it was soo fun.. we totally beat palmdale.. but another one of our players was injured.. ouch.. i think he broke his leg.. oh well.. football is a dangerous sport.. and then we went to mcdonalds and got in trouble for throwing fries.. oh guess who is going to homecoming?? yeah, jonathan asked me.. and i told him yeah.. but just as friends.. i'm just not too into the whole dating thing right now.. i know its weird hearing me say that.. but whatever.. i mean i have a ""crush"" on a lot of guys.. but that's all.. who needs boys beyond having something nice to look at?? haha.."

"event","man.. today was soo fun.. we had a topper's night.. it was suppossed to be a girl's night out.. but.. it turned out to everybody and their men.. well not really.. so it was me, pilar, chelsie, and hillary.. and then brent allen came because he was staying the night at chelsie's (their mom's are best friends).. so then it would be weird with just him and the girls, so ryan came.. and then jimmy stopped by after we had gone to baskin robbins.. all in all it was super fun.. david didn't ask pilar to homecoming like we all thought was going to happen, but it seems to be a sure thing.. maybe tomorrow even.. 

as for me.. still no homecoming date.. actually,  i think johnathan holden is going to ask me, chelsie is sorta forcing him.. i wish it was someone else, but.. under the circumstances.. he'll just have to do.. kidding kidding.. he's way sweet and funny though.. oh well.. its just homecoming with friends not marriage, right??

hmmm.. and before Topper's Night we had a combined swim pracitce.. it was really cool.. we were sized for our suits and then we played games and ate cake.. that's what swimming is all about.. haha.. 

tomorrow is movie night at the youth group.. tell you about it later.."

"event","ok everyone.. hold your breath of this one.. guess what i got on my chemistry test.. a 21%.. is that crazy or what?? i can't believe it.. actually i can but whatever.. on the curve its still an f or a really low d.. but still.. a 21%.. my chemistry teacher told me that i should probably drop the class because i obviously don't have enough time to put into it.. which i honestly don't.. its either ap chem or swimming.. and i pick swimming.. so i tried to switch into a normal chemistry class.. but there is none.. like really.. none.. every single one is full.. so i was going to have to take oceanography.. haha.. so i decided to just stay in ap chemistry and hope for the best.. oh well.. who knows.. i am just doing soo bad in school this year.. ahhh.. 

well on the bright side.. i think jonathan might ask me to homecoming.. chelsie is sorta pressuring him too, but not sure about this one.. so i'll just have to see how things turn out.. i really hope so though.. 

well i'm not in the best of moods.. so i think i'll get ready for bed..

then today i got to skip swim practice to work on a project with chelsie for our video class.. fun fun.. actually i am glad i didn't go swimming because i'm a little sore.. i tripped yesterday while running around the pool (i know, i was asking for it) and i really bruised my shin all up.. but anyway.. or video is pretty cute.. simple but that's all it had to be.. i think my video is only like 2 minutes long.. haha.. oh well, it doesn't matter..

"event","haha.. i love that movie.. it was on the movie channel the other day.. anyways.. today was pretty fun.. actually it was great except for chemistry.. we had a test of 16 questions and i only answered 6 and i don't think i got all the answers right anyways.. how awful is that? but i really am thinking about just dropping into a normal chem class this AP junk is just a little much for me.. i just don't have enough time to put into it.. anyways after that we had our first rally of the year.. it was pretty cool.. juniors won the class game.. as usual.. GO 2003!! woo hoo.. and tons of people complimented our class shirts that me and chels and pilar made.. they are soo cute.. GO SCORPS!!

so then afterschool i went to the grocery store with my mom.. oh wait.. did i tell you about video class.. this weird guy, actually he was sorta cute, but anyway he came up to me and was like.. what's your name? and i said.. nicole.. well i told him after being sorta mean about wanting to know why he cared.. but anyway and then he asks.. are you really a junior.. hello?? is this guy a retard.. i am wearing a class shirt that says JUNIORS and my name right under it.. what a bozo.. 

well anyways.. so afterschool and after grocery shopping i had to go to the pool to turn in my meet form.. i think i am going to skip this meet but i have to go to the next one.. that's cool.. we get to stay the night at a hotel and all.. cool cool.. anyways so i turned in my form and stretched with the team and then left.. and then pilar came over and we got dresssed all cute for the football game.. and then we met chelsie there are 630.. yeah.. we lost.. but whatever.. it was because our best running back was injured.. poor mike card.. he suffered from a serious concusion and he couldn't move his legs when he was taken off the field in the ambulence.. but i think he is going to be ok.. 

so after than we all went to mcdonalds.. it was fun.. i really like chelsie's boyfriend jimmy.. he's super nice.. i'm glad that she found someone like him.. now if only i could.. haha.. well i'm getting a little sleepy.."

they football games and stuff we cancelled for tonight so i'm not sure what i am going to do.. there is a memorial service in constitution park this evening but i don't know.. (and remember to light your candle at 7..)

school was pretty much boring as usual.. my brain is soo fried that i pretty much just vegged out after lunch.. i was like sleeping with my eyes open.. and then out of nowhere my history teacher asked me a question.. ha.. i had no idea what we were talking about.. so i just said ""the british were better off financially.."" and then he kept asking me questions about how they were better financially and whatever.. so i kept on going.. adding in whatever.. apparently i was wrong though.. i thought it was pretty funny.. the class thinks i am like a bozo though.. i got a 75 on my math test.. actually i'm pretty happy with that.. and i got a 6/15 on my chemistry quiz.. which is like a high B after he curves it.. i love mr. p.. he gives this huge curve.. its great.. you can fail the class all year and if you get an 5 on your AP test.. then he gives you an A for both semesters anyway.. isn't that the coolest.. well not much else to say at the moment.. just trying to get by.. day by day.."

shanesha left a posting about notradamous.. all i have to say is wow.. but then again only God knows what tomorrow may hold.. i really can't talk about it any more.. its too difficult to think about.. but remember above all.. during times like this when we feel like we could turn our back on God for these tragedies..

"event","*this may be a little boring for most of you but i wanted to capture everything about this awful day.. so that i will never forget the tragic event.. 

september 11, 2001.. 9-11-2001.. 911.. a day that will change life as we know it.. i cannot even begin to say all that i am feeling right now.. its like we have just witnessed the beginning of the end.. and i know that some people think i am going overboard in my thinking but i feel this is a starting point to the inevitable.. things will never be the same.. 

i woke up at 605 when my mom told me to turn on the news.. a plane had just crashed in new york city.. little did i know, how much worse things would get.. minutes later as i watched katie couric report on the crash i saw a fully loaded passenger plane slam into the second tower of the world trade center.. it was horrific.. i sat in complete shock that this had just happened.. i got dressed and while eating breakfast another plane crashed into the pentagon.. i couldn't believe it.. we were listening to a guy give a report about the twin towers and all of a sudden he starts yelling that a plane has just crashed into the side of the pentagon.. he was standing right there.. to see that happen made me sick to my stomach.. america was being attacked.. before heading into my car i watched one after another the twin towers collapse.. i cried.. 

upon arriving at school we learned that yet another plane had crashed on its way to perhaps camp david.. how could this happen? 4 planes hijacked?? thousands killed.. i started to deny it.. laughed it off.. i even made a joke about the pentagon now being called the tetra-gon.. in 2nd period we learned that 10,000 people we killed in new york today.. 10,000 innocent people were now standing in front of their creator.. i went to the bathroom and threw up.. 

we listened to the news for pretty much the rest of the day.. a lot of people didn't even care.. steven was more concerned about ""football practice being cancelled because of a stupid bombing"".. 10,000 people.. or football.. its amazing how some people can take this soo lightly.. maybe i am over-reacting.. i just can't help to think that this might be the beginning of world war 3.. it was clearly an act of aggressive war.. i don't even want to think about what tomorrow may hold.. 

its weird.. we were talking about freedom in america just the other day.. and i said ""youth in america take for granted their freedom because we have never had to stand up for it"" or something like that.. and that a true test of freedom would show us how valuable it is.. its sorta like i asked for it.. a true test of freedom.. of america.. its tragic.."

my grandparents came up this weekend.. pretty nice.. on saturday i went out with pilar to watch the princess diaries.. man that was such a cute movie.. i liked it a lot.. its like one of my favorites now.. well not that extreme but it was really good.. although mandy moore is an awful actress.. then we went to the outlet mall and did nothing because our outlets are worse than gpo.. really.. we have tons more stores but they are boring stores like cooking and perfume and all that.. blah blah.. so then we went to ross and played around there for awhile in there ugly clothes.. and then target to get some makeup.. pretty fun.. 

today we didn't do much.. watched enemy at the gates.. sorta boring but i'm really into those world war 2 stories.. i'm a freak, i guess.. and we had a barbeque.. and i did my chem homework.. wow sounds like i had a blast.. haha.. hopefully tomorrow will be better.. i think i am going to go over to chelsie's and borrow some clothes for second week of school outfits.. sounds like a weiner.. haha.."

"event","man.. i can't believe how busy school has been.. i basically haven't had a free moment since tuesday until i fell asleep at 830 last night.. well junior year at adolfo camarillo highschool is off to an incredible start.. let me fill you in on all the happenings.. 

 the first day i drove me and adam to school and we had to park down in the lower parking lot.. well for those of you who don't know lower parking is right next to the agricultural barn so its smells like sheep and poop and stuff.. soo gross.. but anyways and i almost tore the door off my car.. haha.. what a dork.. someone pulled up way to close to me as i swung my door open.. 

so first period i have pre-cal honors with mrs. jung or hung or sung.. i can't remember.. but she is super nice.. she sorta reminds me of jocelyn's mom.. really.. i don't have many people that i know in that class but its ok because its first period and i am usually sleeping anyways.. 

then for second i had english with mrs. valdez but then i got that changed into chelsie's english class because of a scedualing error.. soo thankful for that one.. i hate mrs. valdez's accent.. i have no idea what she is saying.. 

third period i have spanish 3 with mrs. denny again.. i'm happy about that because i really like her.. she is such a great spanish teacher.. way better than mrs. beaton.. no offense.. and hillary transfered in there so i'm really excited about it..

and then i have AP chemistry with mr. priggen.. he is super nice but a little weird.. his eyes do this weird thing.. creepy.. and the class is way hard but i'll manage, hopefully.. and the cool thing is that if we fail the class we still get an A if we pass the AP test with a 5.. man.. the AP test is going to be super hard though.. well whatever.. i'll manage.. first week of school i've had 7 hours of homework in there.. man.. but i really like the class.. 

then for lunch our new principal makes us only sit on half the campus.. its soo dumb.. so we had to give up our normal lunch area and sit under this tree that has bees in it.. it is awful.. lizzy already got stung.. 

fifth period is AP US history.. the class is super boring.. the teacher reminds me of mr. beaton.. but i think it will be cool after a while.. hopefully.. 

then sixth period i had waterpolo.. but since the season doesn't start until november we have to take PE until then.. (due to a long series of events).. well i dropped that class first day.. yuck.. PE?? i think not.. so i am in video production now.. pretty scary.. the people are pretty weird in there.. but whatever.. its better than running the track.."

i don't think i've been on this thing for at least 2 weeks so i won't even try to catch you up on all the stuff that has been happening.. although it really wasn't that much.. i redid my bathroom though.. it looks really cute.. like the ocean with little fish and stuff.. only problem with it is that the ""seaweed"" likes you unstick itself from the wall and make it into the toilet or the shower.. :)

well school starts in exactly one week.. yuck.. actually i'm looking forward to being back with my friends and stuff.. it gets really boring without most of them.. chelsie doesn't even come back until friday.. and then i have to spend the whole weekend with family and then school starts.. i'm excited.. i get to drive adam to school.. isn't that the coolest or what.. ok well i'm going to go now.."

"event","man.. we just got back from our lovely week long vacation.. it was soo fun.. we did like everything there is to do.. ok not really but it was a blast.. we left sunday afternoon to go to my aunt's house.. which is like 3 hours away.. it really doesn't seem like that long if you keep yourself busy.. we played memory games and stupid stuff like that to keep my cousins entertained.. and then we spent the night at my aunt's house.. i like it there.. but it a little too farm-ish for me.. i'm a city girl, definately.. 

so we left early monday morning to head to the lake.. lake san antonio.. it was like an hour from their house.. and it really was a nice ride with all these animals everywhere and stuff.. so beautiful.. we had a picnic on the lake and then we went swimming in the beach part.. basically it was just a sandy area of the lake, but it was soo nice.. and the water felt soo good.. it smelled grosss, but whatever.. 

then we had to check into our cabin.. haha.. that was my dad's idea of camping.. renting a 3 bedroom cabin.. actually it was more like motor home without wheels but inside it was like a hotel.. soo nice.. it had everything.. even a dishwasher.. haha.. we were really roughing it.. and i even got to feed a deer a peach.. it ate it right out of my hand.. it was incredible.. 

then on tuesday and wednesday we rented a boat.. that was soo fun.. amazingly my dad knows how to drive a boat.. i learn something new every day.. haha.. and we also rented this inner tube thing to drag behind it.. that was like the funnest thing ever.. but i got really sunburned on my stomach and back where my racing suit usually covers up.. i didn't think it was immodest to wear a two piece.. it was just my family.. seriously no one else was there.. it was soo perfect..

then we went back to my aunt's house wednesday afternoon.. took showers and headed to the fair.. it soo fun.. we were suppossed to watch carrot top give a free concert, but that wasn't exactly my kind of thing.. so we just went on the rides.. bad idea.. after being partially dehydrated and having water legs from boating all day, the last thing on earth that i needed was the tilt-a-whirl.. i had to go home early.. it was awful.. thankfully, i didn't puke.. 

then we came home.. its good to be back.."

"event","well, i just got back from the fair and destiny's child.. long story.. my cousin bought me this tickets like forever long ago for my birthday.. that was in november.. and for 30 bucks each.. i felt obligated to go.. so i took my friend pilar and we had fun.. two great christian artists opened for them and that was just about the coolest thing.. stacie orrico and rachel lampa.. i can't really figure out why they opened for destiny's child though.. actually after having attented the concert i think differently of them.. now before you think me evil for having attened, i'll admit it myself.. i really hadn't planned on staying but i let temptation get the best of me.. anyways like i said.. i think differently about them.. i actually think they are christians but just a little confused with what they are doing.. they sung jesus loves me.. and then followed it up with bootylicious.. they even gave their testimonies and stuff.. so that was interesting.. 

anyways after the concert we cruised the fair grounds for a bit.. i had a churro.. yum yum.. i love mexican pastries.. yum yum.. and i tried to win a goldfish.. i didn't.. and then we rode the bus home.. it was soo fun.. for some reason i started thinking of the new kids on the block.. and i started singing the song ""the right stuff"".. haha.. pilar was soo embarressed but i got the girl in the seat in front of me to join in.. haha.. 

then today we left my aunts house and arrived home in good ol' camarillo at 430.. we had tacos for dinner.. and now are in a pool tournament.. i lost to an 8 year old.. hahaha.. i'll update more later.."

we went ""camping"" again last night.. i almost like doing that.. even if it is only in the backyard.. but we set up the tent and we roasted marshmallows in the barbeque.. it was soo cute.. 

and then today we went to the movies.. jurassic park 3.. is that who you spell it?? whatever.. it was a pretty retardo movie.. they just keep adding dumb sequels to it.. the first one was like perfect.. sequels are soo pointless.. whatever it was a nice way to spend the afternoon.. too bad chris wasn't working today.."

hmm.. my mom got in a big fight with this one lady.. she was being really rude to us.. she asked my cousins a question and she didn't know and then she started freaking out like we were making fun of her or something.. honestly i have no idea what she was soo upset about.. but my mom yelled at her.. it was kinda funny actually.. 

anyways.. the rides were soo fun.. they have these huge family slides and then speed slides.. fun fun.. my favorite was this one called the wedge.. its like a huge skateboard ramp.. sorta like the one at tarza but this one is way higher.. at least 4 times higher than that one.. i loved it.. 

what else... oh yeah.. some lifeguard gave me his number.. haha.. i'm not going to call but still it was cool.. he was soo gorgeous.. but really why would you call some guy you had never met before and he lives an hour away?? stupid.. well i need to shower.."

(its about half an hour away from mi casa) anyways, we got there really early because nancy reagan was going to be there signing books.. pretty cool.. to be honest, i had no idea what she looked like.. but now i know.. haha.. so she signed some books for us and it was pretty cool.. considering the only other famous signature i have is from jaci velasquez.. so like i was saying nancy is all old and wrinkely.. but cute.. old people are cute in their own weird way.. you know.. 

hmm.. then we decided to go to dinner because there was no swim practice today.. (substitute exercise for food.. haha) anyways we went to hometown buffet because you can eat tons and tons of food for like 7 bucks.. but the main reason we went there was for a celebration.. today my dad had to get a physical (just like iris).. and the doctor of course told him he was fat and HAD to lose some weight.. soo tonight was his last night to eat whatever he wanted.. i seriously think he had two whole fried chickens himself.. haha.. 

and then we came home and watched the wedding planner.. its actually a pretty good movie.. no cussing that i remember.. hmm.. yup, don't think so.. and it wasn't all into sex, drugs, or whatever.. innocent enough.. whatever.. whatever.. 

oh and then i bought some cd's too.. i got the new avalon cd (even though i heard it wasn't as good as the last one, a maze of grace).. and i got the mary mary cd.. cool cool.."

1. HOMELESS PEOPLE- they are soo funny.. and scary.. but funny.. you meet people who think they are elvis and jesus.. they live on condoned appartment stoops and as of recently a small group of about 20 have made a parking lot near the LA helliport their home.. they've even set up tents.. 

2. REAL MEXICAN FOOD- this stuff is awesome.. way better than my grandmas.. and it blows carmens out of the water.. PS.. carmens is soo not even mexican food no matter what mrs. beaton tells you.. its wonderful.. 

3. SIMON WEISENTHAL TOLERANCE MUSEUM - this is the coolest musuem in the world.. it has soo many interactive things about tolerance.. games and movies and quizes and computers and cards with little jewish children.. haha.. its the best museum and you learn soo much.. 

4. LA BREA TAR PITS- ok.. a giant pit of tar with statues of elephants and stuff in it.. the coolest.. and it like a world famous thing, you know.. it was the centerpiece of the movie ""volcano"".. even though the movie sucked.. the pits are soo neat.. and it smells like a big fart.. but that just adds to the whole experience.. haha

5. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD- need i say more? celebrities are imoralized on the ground you walk on.. 

6. the CHINESE THEATER- my hands are the same size as judy garland.. its soo fun to play there.. and if you want to have tons of fun.. stand in the middle and shout ""holy cow! its mel gibson"" the tourists totally freak out.. haha.. 

7. SUNSET BOULEVARD- soo cool.. since its like a cross street to rodeo drive it has tons of stores but most of these are way cheaper.. they have this great betsey johnson outlet with the coolest purses and shoes.. 

8. TRAFFIC- what's the world largest parking lot?? the 5 freeway.. haha.. its a great place to people watch.. 

check back tomorrow for more great reasons why LOS ANGELES is better than NYC"

"event","i was just browsing through some journals and some topics just made me think.. and since this is my journal, i'd just like to post my comments on the issues.. 

1. CHEERLEADING.. ok.. now lets be serious here.. most people that commented on the issue of it not being a sport, have never really seen a cheerleader in real life.. most people here attend private schools and have no personal knowledge on the subject.. now don't get me wrong, i think cheerleading is pretty stupid and i love making fun of them during football games.. (i've made up my own satirical cheers and mi amigas and i preformed them in bio class once..) but anyways, these girls work hard enough to be considered athelets.. they work as hard as the soccer players.. i think why most of you don't consider it a sport is because you buy into the steriotype you see on TV and stuff.. 411 from the inside.. cheerleaders are not gorgeous (mine are pretty scary.. some are ok..) they are not always popular and mean and stupid.. (i know one who is in calculas sophmore year and i also know a really fat girl on the squad).. give them a chance.. ask mccarty.. haha.. 

2. CONTEMPARY CHRISTIAN MUSIC.. really.. why are some people so against it? are you trying to say that God only inspired music in the 1800's?? now.. i understand what's right for some people is not for others.. but really, those people who think it is wrong.. i'm just curious why you think that way? i think ccm is great.. it praises God.. what more do you need??

3. MILK.. does anyone really believe that stuff roleigh said about homogenized milk?? it totally creeped me out.. 

4. MOVING.. did i start a trend or what?? i leave and then everyone starts following me.. man.. well for all those people struggling with the ""m"" word.. jocy, lauryn, iris.. don't worry girlies.. things will turn on fine.. keep your priorities in mind and good things will happen.. trust in God.."

we had a pretty ok fourth of july.. ok being honest it was awful.. no one showed up for the party and normally 50 peeps from mi familia are there.. it was sorta disappointing.. and then my mom and i got into a fight and she told me she hated me.. i know that she didn't mean it.. but still.. i don't know.. it hurt.. i'm still not over it.. whatever.. let's move on.. 

fireworks were ok.. i got this 49 dollar pack that i shared with adam.. pretty cool.. we set up a finale show.. with these 2 huge rocket things.. but mine wouldn't light and it looked sorta dumb when it finally did.. 

then we went to pick up my cousins to stay with us from this week.. thats always pretty fun.. i like having them here.. like 2 little sisters.. so cute.. we were going to go camping in our backyard tonight.. but amber wasn't too excited about the idea.. maybe tomorrow.."

hmm.. my mom burnt the food today.. she went over to tell the neighbor that her sprinkler was brokena and it turned into an hour long gossip fest of the neighborhood.. so dinner was extremely well done.. it was like charchol.. but everyone was too hungry to care.. of course we all got blamed for it.. i don't get it.. why do mothers always think they are right? its like they get themselves confused with the papal state of divinity.. ok, for the record i don't believe the pope is divine but i was watching this show on religious comparisons and it was really cool.. that just made me think of it.. but like i said i think its a bunch of baloney but i don't want to get into an argument here.. so if you believe it.. thats your thing.. actually this is my journal so i really don't care what you think.. not in a bad way but you know what i mean.. my journal = my thoughts, ideas, and beliefs..

My new bow is very interesting - I chose a longbow this time that has a lot more string tension...its feel is very nice and its lightweight, so I'm happy with it.

What I'm not happy about, however, is the rate that the people at the designing company demand designs from me. They're so slow - I can easily get four drawings done in one week. I believe this is what you call failure to look into the work ethic of your workers. Pathetic, but the pay's good so I'll have to bear it."

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""fluffy puff marshmallows""><br />Yoruichi finally found her passport and of course it was in the last place she looked, the very last box, but she had it now and that was the last thing she needed. Well, no the last thing she needed to accomplish. She still needed to tell a couple more people she was leaving, especially Ishida. So after she called him, she made her way from her dorm room over to his place. Yoruichi managed to make it over without her nerves getting to her. She didn't really feel like leaving Ishida and she didn't really feel like telling him anything new. But she knew she was going to. It was always important to tell your brother what was happening, right? Yoruichi sighed as she knocked on the door. Yeah, but it was always hard to hurt your brother. <br /><br />Ishida was curled up miserably in the couch. He was offset and sullen at Yoruichi's forced leave - but if he was to see her again it had to be done. He had answered to phone and perked up excitedly when she said she'd come before she left but soon the boy became downcast at the thought of her leaving tomorrow or even today. So here he was, in his snug corner of the couch, waiting for his ""sister"" to arrive and say her goodbyes. When he heard the clack of wood against bony fist, Ishida jogged to the door and opened it despite his slightly disheveled look. <br /><br />She tried to smile, but nothing came to her lips. She didn't even say hello as she inched her way in. Instead she looked down at his feet. She stood there for a few minutes, or what seemed like at few minutes as she tried to figure exactly what to say. <em>It had been easier to talk to Kaien,</em> Yoruichi noticed. <em>Because he's older? Because he's not as emotionally invested in her as Ishida is?</em> A silent shrug passed over her shoulders and she finally looked him in the eye. ""On Friday. We're leaving on Friday."" <br /><br />He sighed in relief. Friday. And now that he thought about it, frustration too. It would give him a lot of time to think. Too much time, in fact. He almost smiled, but it came out to be a sad frown. Turning his head towards Yoruichi he quietly said, ""We should probably go to my room so that we can both sit down."" <br /><br />""Sure,"" she nodded. She slowly started on her way there as all her thoughts floated around waiting to be let go. ""It'd probably be best to sit down."" <br /><br />""Yes, it would..."" The air was awkward between them. They were more...uptight, and wound. Ishida could feel it and he didn't like it - not one bit. When he reached his room, the black-haired youth flopped down on his bed and toyed with the edge of the box that he had compiled the paper cranes in. <br />Yoruichi walked over to the desk chair and sat down once more looking at the floor. She couldn't understand why this was so hard. Well, she could, but she didn't want it to be. She also didn't feel like leaving everything behind, but she didn't want Kisuke to get hurt again. ""He's getting better. I guess that's a given. How are you?"" <br /><br />He wished she could stay but it was not to be. Why did he wish for her to stay even if his feelings weren't that way for her? Because she was precious to him, he had decided after asking that question to himself earlier that day. Precious, and that's all she needed to be. ""I'm...fine. A bit stressed out -""<em>over you going away,</em> he silently added in his mind, ""but I'm okay. You?"" <br /><br />""I'll tell you the same thing I told Shunsui. I'm fine, which is a lie. I'm trying to be fine, though."" She looked up and gave him a half smile. ""Do I look too thin to you?"" <br /><br />Ishida laughed quietly. ""It's just like you to do that. I suppose it's probably to keep others from hurting themselves worrying over you..."" He reached over and poked her in the arm. ""But I know you're trying your best to keep us comfortable and unsuspecting. And no, you don't look too thin...why?"" <br /><br />A real smile showed up. ""On Sunday whe- Sunday Kisuke noticed that I lost weight. I don't think I look that bad, so I was just wondering. Yeah, I'm trying my best. It's just hard."" She sighed. ""I'm scared that they'll follow us or be waiting for us when we come back."" <br /><br />Sunday. It was a holy day to the west and Christians, and blood had been spilled - not for anything just, of course. So it was dark, and tainted with the swirl of sin. ""It's good that you're worrying. You're not skinny at all either, but what you need to do..."" He felt strange saying this to her but it was true. ""Is loosen up."" - and so did he. Tossing her one of his extra pillows, he motioned for her to follow him out. ""As immature as I find it to be -"" He smirked as he walked and talked. ""I find it ironic that I seem to be on the opposite end of the relaxed spectrum for once."" Reaching his slightly spacious living room, Ishida held his tightly ahead of him when he reached the center, his sharp blue eyes exposing a ""en garde"" look as he set his glasses down by his balcony door. <br /><br />She caught the pillow raised her eye brow, but followed anyway. ""Loosen up? And why should I loosen up now?"" It was when he took off his glasses that she figured out exactly what was going on. It was something she last did when she was around ten and she remembered angry parents. ""You're going to go easy on me, right?"" <br /><br />He gave her a mock glare. ""Easy? On you? Despicable. Come at it, you."" And he really smiled because he figured that she would be a rambunctious individual soon. <br /><br />Yoruichi laughed and walked slowly up to him. ""But I was going to go easy on you."" She shrugged. ""But now I won't."" She moved the pillow to her side and wipped it around to try to hit him in the side. <br /><br />Bringing it to his own flank, Yoruichi's daunting speed almost caught Ishida off guard but he spun around to hit his sibling when he realized there was no padding on the ground. ""Hold on, I'll be right back"" was what he said before he rushed into his room, snatched 8 of the large cushions that came with the apartment and dumped them all on the battleground, spreading them out evenly. ""Can't have you hurt before you go..."" <br /><br />She yelled at getting hit, but stopped everything when he told her to hold on. Yoruichi stood there and watched him bring out cushions. ""I guess that would be bad, but you know, I don't get hurt that easily."" She took her pillow and hit him again as she laughed. ""I can't say the same about you..."" <br /><br />Ishida gave an oof of surprise as he flopped down on the cushions with force. That was quite a blow, but it was soon to be bested as drapes of black hair lashed out, following three blows of pillow. <br /><br /><br />Yoruichi laughed again upon seeing him fall. She quickly stopped, seeing him come after her again. She took the hits and hit them back. It was the greatest thing she could have been doing at this point. It was giving her mind a rest. At this moment, Kisuke didn't exist, Shunsui didn't exist, and all the pain she held inside didn't exist. What did exist was carefree laughter and Ishida, the one who cared enough to make her feel like a child again. <br /><br />Ishida smiled as they exchanged blows, feathers beginning to fluff around the place. He was making her happy - it was what mattered if she was going to survive the biggest run of her life. Nothing but Yoruichi was the most important for she had to live for another day and what if she were to die and not have a nice day at all before her death? This was what opened that opportunity, and amidst his and her laughter the Quincy tackled the feline-ish figure and fell, tussling and tassling and laughing. <br /><br />She fell back and continued to laugh as she stayed there, not wanting to move. She just wanted to laugh forever. ""Do you think you're winning?"" she asked as a feather fell on her outstretched arm. ""You know, the last time I did this the maid came in and yelled at me for making a mess she didn't feel like cleaning. And then my mom came in and yelled at me. It's nice to know I'm not going to get yelled at this time."" <br /><br />He just lay there as well, his head on her stomach and his lean frame on its side with a smile. White fluffs of feather landed in his hair but Ishida didn't bother brushing it off - he was too comfortable. ""I don't know if I'm winning or not. All that matters is that I'm having fun, and that you are having fun."" Laughing slighty, he added, ""I'll clean up, there's no need to worry. And I'm sure it is nice not to be yelled at..."" He smiled again and nuzzled her ribcage with the top of his head. ""If someone saw us right now they could mistake us for a couple with all the fun we're having..."" <br />""But we aren't, so we'd have to beat them up and tell them that, right?"" Ishida turned his ocean depth eyes up at Yoruichi's yellowish-orange, a happy look on his features. <br /><br />She moved her hand to ruffle his hair. ""Yeah, I'll take the first shot. You can finish them off."" Yoruichi laughed again, moving her hand from his head. ""It's nice to just let everything go and have fun. Don't forget to have fun when I'm gone, okay? Talk to someone...Sakura's a nice girl. Talk to her sometime. And I'll try to call if that's okay with you."" <br /><br />Ishida squirmed and laughed as his sibling tousled his hair, brushing a couple of sensitive spots. ""Sure..I'll finish them off."" Sighing, he said, ""I'll be sure to have fun and talk and anticipate your calls."" Ishida poked at a ticklish spot twice. ""It'll be no fun without you here though."" <br /><br />She laughed even though she didn't feel like it, but poking a ticklish spot did that. ""I'm sorry. I know I'm the brightest spot in your day, but you're just going to have to wait for a while. I'll be sure to bring you a present or two. We're going to Canada and New York at first. I'm sure I'll find something you'll like."" <br /><br />""You're the only one I can approach without feeling awkward,seeing as you're the only person I've talked to at all for a long time...but I can't help it if you leave. You don't have to get anything for me, but if you want..."" The male tilted his head up and then down before nuzzling her ribs again. ""I'll miss you."" <br /><br />I do want to, so I will. And you shouldn't feel awkward talking to people, but I guess it is hard to at times."" Youichi closed her eyes and sighed dramatically. ""I'll miss you too, but I'll be back before you know it. Then we can share stories, drink milk, laugh. I just don't want to find out that you spent your time worrying about me and not enjoying life."" <br /><br />Ishida curled up by her, tired. ""You're right. I should hope for the best while you're away - there's no use in worrying."" His piercing blue orbs peered into hers once more as he craned his neck upward, resting it on her shoulder. ""I'm so worn out...and I'm glad you got to relax today,"" the Quincy murmured softly. <br />DranzerMSX0: *resting it on her shoulder with hesitance <br /><br />""There isn't."" She tilted her head to lean it against his, trying to stifle a yawn. ""Yeah, these past couple of weeks have worn me out. It seems like you've finally got to relax as well."" She yawned again. ""I could fall asleep right here."" <br /><br />The night-haired boy tried to stifle a yawn as his eyes began to droop. ""I could too..."" He couldn't have imagined such closeness with Yoruichi before - it was different though, he supposed. ""Do you want to stay and take a nap or something? Or do you have to go?"" <br /><br />Her eyes drifted shut again as she tried to will herself to stand up and leave, but she couldn't. She enjoyed this time and she knew that if she left, everything would come barreling down on her and this nice relaxed state would never return. ""I should, but I don't really want to. Do you think I could just stay and take that nap?"" <br /><br />He smiled sleepily. ""Your choice."" Standing up, he almost stumbled as he got his thick blanket from his couch and dropped it down on the mass of pillows. Secretly Ishida hoped that she would stay - he didn't want this relaxed state that almost never happened to end, but the male took his shirt off and crawled under the covers, eyes drifting lazily and almost completely shut. <br /><br />""Alright,"" she said, stretching as he stood up. ""I'm going to stay."" Yoruichi opened her eyes and watched him get a blanket and crawl underneath. She moved closer to him and placed a light kiss on his dark hair. ""Thank you."" With a smile, she moved into a comfortable position and closed her eyes, feeling sleep coming to take her away. <br /><br />Feeling her lips pressed against his head, Ishida found it soothing - it was pleasant, not awkward. She was now next to him, drifting into the peaceful land of slumber...and here he was, staying awake. The boy conceded to sleep and let his eyes droop into the pool of rest and his tiredness. And as he fell asleep, the Quincy reached his arm out despite dim vision and found a shoulder, pulling it towards him in an embrace - he had no idea why he was doing it but he did it anyways, succumbing to the sweet desire of rest.</div>

"event","after a couple of days of experimenting (that i have not posted in this journal), milk works like a charm on my strength. I'm slowly recovering due to the milk and the fact that I'm vomiting less helps. To further back this up - there's no more of the occasional spit of that sanguinary liquid otherwise called blood. whole milk (the kind that has no fat removed, etc.) works wonders but I tend to have to go to the bathroom a lot afterwards.

Hell, I'm even able to type in a proper manner once in a while."

So I took a look at Sakura's userinfo and her birthday's coming up in a month.

I remember the Quincy tradition, but I'll have to put it aside this time for her. Her bow must be made with the strongest of hands, and her kimono must be the most beautiful in all the land.

I have to do this for the one that my heart belongs to, as of the current time.

<lj-cut text=Quiz><img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/S/SA/SAM/sambamama/1138380117_OrionPiano.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""sad, anime""><br>You are a PEACEFUL person.
You are the epitome of Tranquility, always at ease
<br />with yourself. You tend to think more
<br />logically than emotionally(meaning that you
<br />do not always follow your heart). You are a
<br />seemingly warm person and you rarely get mad.
<br />People look to you whenever they need someone
<br />to confide in, for they admire your ability
<br />to listen and not judge.

Your traits:
*Forgiving
*Maturity
*Gentleness
*Virtuous
*Wisdom
*Sensibility
*Calm

Your color: White/ Silver
Your Quote: ""Better than a thousand hollow
<br />words is one word that brings peace.""

The arrow, drawn back
Death, the intended target
Success bleeds forward.

The arrow pierces not.

The heart, in sadness

The mind, stays restless.</small>"

His hair and bare top was matted with sweat, as he had been here for two hours shooting continuously. The black haired teen's shoulder relaxed as he stopped to catch a breather. He hoped that after the lesson his student wouldn't be as strained as he was right now. Shooting rapidly was a chore for all competitiongoers but it was an essential part of the race - many, many points were awarded for being the fastest.

Removing his glasses to rub them clean for a second, a blurred figure in the distance with wrapped lower arms waved at Ishida and he smiled, too tired to pull on the top part of his clothing and to run and greet Sakura."

"event","...it's the anniversary of that day. My shoulder joint and arm remember this, as they're bleeding profusely from <s>big</s>small cuts <s>that I slashed</s>from training. It hurts so much but it's a reminder at least.

It's a painful reminder of why I musn't forget.

And now, I present to you, The History of the Quincy.

<lj-cut text=""The Lost History of the Quincy"">

The Quincy. No one has heard that name before...their existance has dwindled slowly but surely, and this is their tale.


The Quincy are a long line of talented archers that have had many traits passed down throughout the years - a sense of drama, seriousness, desire for authority, a taste for fish. Generally the Quincy are quiet, reserved, dishonest and unappreciative with themselves and their capabilities. Also, the Quincy rather dorky as well, but this is only the case in recent years. Having been previously revered in archery, Quincy are often endowed with a talent for sports like tennis, boxing and fencing as well, seeing as these sports involve arm strength mostly. And for some unknown reason a birthmark in the shape of a cross is usually somewhere on a Quincy's body.

This race of long-range warriors began about two centuries ago. When archery was a great sport and was abundant as a skill among the samurai, the Quincy were well known throughout all of Japan. They were much like policemen - honorable, law-enforcing and sometimes even gluttons. Except policemen would subdue criminals, and the Quincy would kill. The policemen had no big problems with the Quincy, but eventually the Quincy were becoming more renowned than the policemen because they got bigger, better kills than they did. Eventually the policemen buzzed about a massacre of the Quincy. The police no longer would respect the Quincy, even going as far to kill torture some of them when there was no crime done. This occured after the decline of samurai and the beginning of the 1900s.

 The Quincy eventually grew angry at the policemen for killing their kind and they lashed back, killing policemen when they got in the way of their hunts. Eventually, the rivalry grew so bad that the two groups came to a supposed compromise...but in actuality the policemen were planning a long-term massacre. Over the next century the Quincy were purposely eradicated under the cover of natural accidents, but most of the Quincy were eradicated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The policemen eventually began to stop Quincy killing but traditional policemen carried the job on. Eventually, the Quincy reached the brink of extinction with five families left. Only one of these five families survive today with two members.

And so is the tale of the Quincy, who have struggled to remain in existance to this very day.

"event","So I got an English assignment today right after Rangiku and I had a chat at recess- to write an essay about my family's history.

<lj-cut text= RP Log - Of the Quincy and Sakura>
 Rangiku sat on one of the benches outside the school and flipped through her magazine in a bored manner, her schoolbag sitting open next to her with a mess of papers sticking out of it. She really didn't mind school it was a good few hours that took her mind off other things but she despised recess at least when none of her friends were around since she was so easily bored. With a loud sigh she slapped the magazine closed and tilted her head backwards, throwing an arm over her eyes to try and block out the annoying sun. 

Ishida walked around the school's courtyard feeling absolutely bored. He couldn't bear himself to think about Sakura; her archery lesson was to come soon today or next week. Looking towards the exit of the school grounds, a bright dazzle of light caused him to spin around and stare at a irritated Rangiku, who was trying to block the same dazzle of light out of her eyes. The first thing he noticed was that she was wearing slightly revealing clothing. Namely, a rather tight top that....showed off her bust, which was something Ishida did not want his mind on.

 ""Matsumoto-san...if I may inquire, why are you wearing such clothing? It's not a good idea to show off your stuff to all the crazy males in this school, you know.""
""Huh?"" Rangiku pulled her arm away from her face and blinked at the darkened figure. Her brow's furrowed slightly as she tried to remember his name, she knew she's seen him at the party this past weekend but his name never really stuck or maybe she was just to out of it to remember. It was something something with I, she knew that much though. Picking up the magazine she shielded her eyes and glanced at him again.
""I'm wearing it cause it's the school uniform?"" The sentence came out more like a hesitant question than a real answer. 

 Ishida gave her a puzzled look. If there was such clothing, his flirty, pink haired friend-now-archery student would have worn it everyday for everyone to see. ""I had no idea that the school sold that kind of clothing as a uniform...""

""They ran out of shirt and refused to let me take one of the guys."" 

She shifted her legs and shrugged some. It wasn't like it really mattered to her, she was more than enough comfortable with her body to walk around like she did. 
""Not really my fault and well it's not like it bothers me so why should I worry?"" 

Ishida nodded at the first answer. It was a common procedure; in fact how could he have forgotten? Orihime had worn a shirt like Rangiku's last year and he had a couple of nosebleeds when his eyes opened to her breasts as she peered over him, asking if he was okay.

""You should worry because you might get some unwanted attention...not all the boys at are school are nice, but I think you know that.""

""Yeah I know, thanks for the concern Ic...Is... ah what's your name again?"" Yes, Rangiku was well aware of the male population of the school, she's even heard rumors that they'd started a fanclub for her breasts - something that she wasn't sure if she should laugh at or feel offended by. 
""It's nothing to worry over really, I'm a big girl after all."" She flipped some of her hair back over her shoulder and grinned at him. 

He grinned back at her when she tossed her hair back confidently and sent a smile towards him. ""My name is Ishida Uryuu; I'd prefer my last name - Ishida."" No one really called him Uryuu but his father, but he hated his only living parent anyways so it didn't matter. ""And sometimes, even big girls get in trouble...no?""

""Ishida, yeah that's right. I got to remember it this time. Look I appreciate the concern but I haven't faced any trouble yet that I've been unable to handle one way or another."" She shook her head some before stifling a yawn. Rangiku wasn't know as one of the sportier girls in school but it didn't mean that she never worked out, actually one of her better kept secrets was probably the gym in her parents basement.
""Sorry I'm not that good with names and apparently I'm still a bit behind on my sleep from the party. Speak of which, I saw you there right? Did you have fun?""

Ishida understood. People usually were fine without concern, but why take the risk of not being concerned? And it seemed like she was tired...and enough that she didn't remember his spin the bottle experience with her. ""Everyone gets tired; its natural unless you're Gaara. And yes...I did have lots of fun for the short time I was there.""

""Huh? Gaara? Yeah he's that weird looking kid right? Cute redhead with insomnia. I've heard a bit about him. Never actually talked to the guy though I think Sakura said he was a bit pissy or something."" She frowned and tilted her head some before looking back up at him.

Ishida laughed a bit. In his mind, he said <I>There goes my resolve not to think about her.</I>""He is somewhat pissy...he's an extreme introvert. Sakura did a number to him, made him a bit more sociable...did that to me, too. That girl is crazy...""

""Myeah, she's a good girl though. Reminds me a bit of myself when I was younger. I think she's on a crusade to make the world a far more friendly place or something. She seems to be doing a good job at it though."" 

Ishida's legs grew tired, so he sat on the ground by Rangiku's bench. ""She is doing a good job at it but sometimes I think she overdoes it...especially with me.""

Rangiku glanced down at him and nodded slightly as she leaned forward and placed her elbow on her knee, resting her chin on the palm of her hand. ""..what makes you say that?""

""I really don't know...she's just...more suggestive to me than other people. Messes with my head a lot because normally, I'm not very sociable at all but she makes me want to communicate. Heh...she makes me the exact opposite of what Kurosaki says I'm like...""

""Hehe, is that so?"" She was unable hold back a large grin as she looked at him, seemed someone had gone and fallen for the ditzy pink-haired girl but Ran was pretty sure there were others as well. 
""What can I say, girls have a tendency to mess with your minds. It's a favorite past time thing we have~.""

Ishida saw where this was going. She thought that he had a crush on Sakura? He didn't, but he did, but he didn't...he was just confused about his feelings for her. ""Orihime doesn't mess with my head...and by the way, if you think I have a crush on Sakura...I don't. Crush is a bad word for it...""

Rangiku's grin grew as she tapped a nail against her cheek. ""Aha... and what might be a better word for it then? And Orihime is as innocent as they come, she probably doesn't even know the meaning of the word mind-game. Sure she's sweet but she's innocent~."" 

Ishida smiled at the comment about Orihime. She was innocent for sure...
""I guess a better way to say it is...I'm confused about how I feel about her. I haven't known her for that long; I can't just say that I like her right away because that would be foolish. I need to know her better to know how I feel about her, y'know? And you're right about Orihime...sweet and innocent. Oblivious, unlike Sakura, to innuendo.""

 ""I think Sakura's pretty innocent to a fault too, I'd probably blame that Kakashi for any or all of her little stunts she's pulled. I bet he's the reason she's as she is. I mean kami have you see what he walks around and reads all the time."" Rangiku rolled her eyes and laughed, it was nice to talk to someone sometimes that didn't just nag at her or stutter all the time. 

Ishida laughed. ""I don't think its just Kakashi....I think she decided to make herself that way. And everyone knows Kakashi's a porn freak; if you don't then you have been living under a rock for a long time.""

""Well that's true. But I still think he's partly to blame for it. I mean come on, she's been with him for what? Since she was 12? He's bound to have had some impact on the girl. ...maybe he's something to look at then."" Her brows furrowed slightly before she started grinning. 

""Maybe he is something to look at...we dunno if Sakura's ever gonna start reading porn anyday, no? Or if she's gonna start shooting arrows better than me, or start sewing and taking up after my habits...But who knows...Kakashi doesn't seem like he has sex a lot does he? I believe the term is that he doesn't seem oversexed."" Ishida grinned after saying that.

Rangiku just shrugged some. ""I don't. I don't even know the man, but from the rumors he apparently gets around a lot. I don't think she'll take up on his habits though she's got a mouthful of her own that girl, whatever you do. Don't offer to go shopping with her unless you're ready to look at lots of pink things - that is one thing I do know about her."" 

Ishida snapped out of his amused state into an alarmed one. ""You're already assuming that I'll end up asking her out? Society's stereotypes these days...""

""Oh come on Ishida! Like you haven't already planned to~"" The look she was giving him was a clearly amused one as her grin grew a bit wider at the panic stricken look on his face. 

""I already said that my feelings are jumbled...I can't do it. My conscience kills me when I know that she is attached to Kakashi. There's something more there...something that I shouldn't try and intrude on...""

""Well who ever said you had to be more then friends with the girl. All I'm saying is that you look like you do want to ask her out, so why not ask? I mean it's not like she'll kill you over it or something.""

 Ishida sighed, then said,"".You are the first person to have heard this...feel honored. My family...I live in such a bloodline called the Quincy. The Quincy are a line of almost extinct archers; I am the last child of the Quincy. They do not tolerate failure, and when distinguished archers see me, they know me because of..."" Ishida turned towards Rangiku and undid the first few buttons of his uniform. A birthmark that looked like a cross sat on his chest. ""That is the Quincy mark...my father still is alive, so if I fail in asking her out, it is still considered a disgrace. To the Quincy, everything is a matter of success or disgrace.""

""So.... you cant ask her out due to the risk of her turning you down and that would be seen as a failure? Crap, that sounds like a dull way of life."" Rangiku nodded slightly and stared at the birthmark for a while before leaning back against the bench again with a slight frown on her face. 

Ishida nodded. ""But someday...I'll take my shot. I don't know when...or why I'll be crazy enough to do it, but I'll take the risk. When my father is...away, on trips out of town, I'll do it. For the pride of myself...and the Quincy.""

 ""And perhaps, my arrow will land near her heart...perhaps I will not fully succeed but I will remain close to her. Maybe that'll be enough for me someday...""

""Someday huh? Sounds like a plan, just make sure you don't wait until it's too late okay. Cause you'll spend the rest of your life regretting it if you do."" Rangiku gave him a saddened smile as she stuffed her magazine into the bag with the rest of the papers and stood up. 
""Thanks for the chat Ishida, but I need to go unless I want to be late for class."" All the talk about emotions and losses were getting to her and her thoughts was beginning to stray into territories where she didn't need them to go. 
Ishida smiled. ""It was nice talking to you too...I hope you learned something about me. See you then...Rangiku."" Ishida broke into a jog towards the school, snatching up his bag that some 9th graders were about to kick around.

I wonder...Rangiku, should I write about my bloodline? I'm sure that'd net me an A but I dunno..."

"event","i just played a few games of quake.. first one i lost. 2nd, i beat ranger by like 1 frag (i was down by 4, he was at 9 and i then came back to win!).. then i reset my demo bind and recorded the last game, which i won by 4 frags i think! :O

i made a conscious effort to strafe (it's hard to remember..) and to aim lower w/rl but i *was* playing better than i did yesterday.. yayy!!

i cant wait to go over this demo w/chris tonight."

"event","you know, fuck lj. christ. i'm not writing this entry all out again. here it is, bulleted (HAHA FUNNY UNINTENTIONAL PUN)

. chris showed me around q3dm1 last nite
. i played bot ranger today on 'hurt me plenty'
. warmed up, beat him once, then recorded demo
. watched it with chris
. good points (word for word from chris):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. good basic rules of engagement (no charging w/o a health advantage, etc)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. good awareness of item status
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. good prediction aiming technique
. bad points:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. poor movement (need to use strafe more often to navigate the map better)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. poor enemy awareness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. poor rl technique (need to focus on splash damage more)

thats it. if this fucker doesnt post, oh well. :P"

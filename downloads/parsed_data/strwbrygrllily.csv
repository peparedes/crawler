I don't remember who exactly has what (or really what exactly I lent out), but if you have a book or two, I was wondering if you could remind what you have, and if you're done can I possible get it back to add to my alphabetized book shelf?  Muchas gracias!"

"event","Already into week...three, is it?  Ugh.  Things are going as they usually do at school, with the added bonus of having my own room and usually edible food to eat for dinner.  It wasn't too cold today, and the snow melted enough that I could see stripes of grass through the not-quite-permafrost.  Drama is keeping my stress level high, although it is drama of the internal kind, created by external factors I don't know how to control/fix (annoyingly ambiguous and imprecise, I know).  Study group fallout.  Readjustment fallout.  I have a cold and I'm starting to break out (zit in my dark undereye circle - didn't know you could get 'em there), and I'm trying to decide if it's from stress or just from living in a small town where disease incubates quickly (not that that explains away the zits).  Working on finding a job and things to do with my life and maybe an idea of what to do with my life, as the end of college is quickly approaching, I find...  I'm much more productive when I'm extremely busy.  And being extremely busy will keep me from thinking too much.  On a more amusing note, I got invited to a red-light district party this weekend, where the attendees are supposed to dress like streetwalkers.  How sketchy is that?  :)"

I'm also surrounded by my junk just begging to be put away, so I guess I could do that and it would help with the boredom.  Despite this boredom, I don't want class to start tomorrow.  Yeeech.  

Like I said, bored out of my mind.  I have back entries of the daily haiku written on a piece of paper somewhere, but it hasn't emerged from the move-in rubble yet.  So, for yesterday and today...

January 19th: 
Glad to be back here
Come in my room and you just,
Fuck things up.  Thank you.

Snow, snow, everywhere

Hermit I become."

So I've been writing food-related haikus lately.  Nothing wrong with that, right?  Ma made gingersnaps, and they taste best hot out of the oven.  I made a pecan pie, but have not yet mastered this particular pie's baking technique - thus, it was mushy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Never fear, I will prevail eventually!"

First of all...what was a woman doing sitting on his lap?  Isn't that for the kiddies?  Second of all...why?  Poor guy, getting groped while just trying to do his job.  (What am I talking about?  He probably liked it.)

A surgeon took a picture of a patient's penis with his cell phone during surgery because it (the penis) had the words ""hot rod"" tattooed on it.  He (the surgeon) is now facing ""disciplinary action.""

I don't know if I'll have internet access for any of the rest of the trip, so if you don't hear from me on LJ or FaceBook or email or whatever, it's probably because I'm in remote rural areas that don't like Wi-Fi.

"event","Hi kids.  Japan is fun.  Monday I actually have to start going to class.  I'm scared of Kansai-ben and my host family (whom I haven't even met yet).  I know, calm down!  I'm trying.  But I went to this Buddhist temple today and did the fortune thing, and I got a BAD one.  REALLY BAD.  So now I'm scared of everything because the monks told me my life SUCKS!  

Moving on, if I for some reason haven't already told you about it, you should check out my travel blog website photo album video files amalgamation of DOOM.  It is fun!  At least, I hope it is. I'm a bit behind in the journaling department, but I think I might catch up on the looong ride to Kyoto.  Here's the link: http://web.mac.com/janislabelle/

Let me know what's going on with y'all.  I'm having mucho fun abroad, but I still feel quite a bit disconnected from everyone!  I'm working on buying some stamps soon, so I can send out the first batch of postcards.  

Well, most go organize my life.  Ciao!"

"event","I can't believe I'm leaving for Japan on Wednesday.  A bit scary, but not *too* scary.  Whereas last week I was in a hysteria and near tears most of the time and positively convinced I did *not* want to go on the study group, now I've calmed down and am looking at things from the proper perspective.  Also, it probably helps that I finally called Yo and got the scoop on visas, sending luggage to my host family, and directions to the hotel.  Since, y'know, I'm a dumbass and am getting there a day before everyone else.  :)  

So yeah, I'd like to see people before I leave...  Let me know if you have any free time in your schedules before next Wed., if you please.  Additionally, you all know how much I like sending postcards.  If I have not already harrassed you about it, please email me with your address if you would like some delicious mail from across the ocean!

What has happened lately of interest...

Projekt Revolution was awesome.  Effing fantastic.  There wasn't a single band there that I actively dislike, and even the ones I'm not particularly fond of put on an entertaining show (case in point: My Chemical Romance).  Placebo was awesome.  I think all the guys in HIM were high for their whole set.  MSI was great, except for the guy with the hairy back in front of my who kept flipping his greasy hair in my face, leaving streaks of sludge across my glasses.  And then the part where I thought I was going to pass out in the bathroom afterwards wasn't too great either...but def worth it.  There's just some sort of street cred inherent in surviving an outdoor concert in full summer heat in Arizona.  Of course, Linkin Park was the best at.  They sang all my favorites (except for My December and A Place for my Head), and it just went by too fast.  So fast I even forgot about the 12 year old MCR fan next to me who kept poking me with her poster.  :D

I had another burst of prodigious reading last weekend.  Eclipse, Magic Study, Jinx, select short stories from 21 Proms, started re-reading A Great and Terrible Beauty, and am about halfway through Blue Bloods right now.  I'm currently trying to choose which books to take to Japan with me.  I need ones that will last me awhile, that are not hardcover, that I won't mind re-reading while I'm there.  So far I'm thinking...Freedom & Necessity.  I haven't read it, but everyone loves it and it's pretty long.  Tithe, because I could read it over and over again.  Maybe some others.  I'm also way into audio books lately, so I have a couple Harry Potters in my iTunes (courtesy of the library) and I figure I can always purchase a couple through the iTunes store if I get desperate.  

I hate the Quizno's on Thunderbird near CeHS.  You should boycott it.  I've told the story many times, so here's the condensed version: The owner of the restaurant treated me with the utmost disrespect regarding a coupon I had, and continued to harrass me while my friends and I were trying to enjoy our meal even after I had offered to pay the full price for my sandwich.  I am composing a choice-ly worded letter to coporate.  That's how angry she made me.  It was one of those things where a complete stranger was just so rude for no reason whatsoever that it ruined my whole day.  

I heart Richard Simmons.  He makes me feel oh-so-happy about exercising and life.  Hooray!  

Best quote ever, inspired by the cereal aisle of the grocery store: ""I like my men like I like my granola...naked, fresh, and crunchy.""  

Okay, of to clean, organize, and otherwise occupy myself on my day off.  

Oh!  I almost forgot my whole reason for posting.  I got homework express-delivered to my door today.  From the professor leading the study group.  It's one of those things, I don't know whether to laugh or be depressed.  XD"

"event","Imelda Staunton is perfect as Umbridge.  Reverend Snape makes me giggle.  Bellatrix is in Fight Club.  Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is strangely attractive.  Also, his costumes were bad-a.  I wish there had been more Tonks.    I also expected Fred and George's departure from Hogwarts to be a little more...spectacular?  A word of advice: Go pee before you see, or you will suffer.  Like I did.  :)  

I really want to go see it again.  

Mini-rant:  As for Dumbledore...I've heard the Mugglecast people debating about which actor was better.  The first actor (whose name escapes me), when he said those crazy Dumbledore-y things, he just sounded senile.  I've always read Dumbledore in the books as being very intelligent, a little strange, and still completely in his right mind.  I did not get that from the first actor.  The new one is better.  Usually when he presents Dumbledore's more interesting lines, he hits it in that he sounds completely lucid and as far from senility as possible.  Still, sometimes he says things and sounds really mean (case in point: ""Shouldn't you all have some studying to do?""), and the Dumbledore I've read in the books does not say petty things like that.  Thus, I stand by my prior beliefs: Ian McKellen would be an awesome Dumbledore."

P.S.  My mom is excited about the South Beach Diet and enlisted me to be moral support and do it with her.  So if I'm really pissy for the next two weeks, it's probably because I'm not eating anything that tastes good.  Just so you know."

"event","So I'm checking my LJ friends page, la dee da, just putzing around before I go to bed.  I see a post by one of the authors I think is amazing and have friended on LJ (Cassandra Clare, in case you're interested), wherein she is excited because in the Canadian equivalent of Borders they have this thing called the Junior Advisory Board where 5 kids get to pick books they like that are then highlighted in all the Canadian-equivalent-of-Borders stores, and one of the kids picked her book, City of Bones.  She posted a photo of the display.  It has a picture of the kid who picked her book, and the book on display.  I look at it, do a double take, and feel like I got suckerpunched in the gut.  This kid looks like he's TEN freaking years old.  I am shocked by the fact that I share reading tastes with a 10 year old boy.  I am feeling flummoxed, trying to comprehend this particular imbalance in the universe, when I notice the things sitting on my desk.  Lisa Frank stamp, Hello Kitty notebook, toys from Sonic.  My playlist of bad '80s music providing the night's soundtrack.  And I begin to think reading tastes equivalent to those of a 10 year old fit in here.  And I ask myself, who *is* this strange person sitting at the computer, living this life?"

Yuck.), drinking soap-flavored chai (apparently I can't do dishes), and writing with Sharpies until I get dizzy, I'm surprised my body hasn't revolted against me yet.  I guess there's still time...I'll have to see what delicious morsels I can dig up for dinner.  :)

I really need to write my Core Japan paper.  I wrote the intro this morning, which was unbelievably difficult for no real reason...it took an embarrassingly long time to do.  :(  Must go work, now.

Now my throat is all scratchy and painful and post nasal drip is going crazy and I have a huge headache and my ears hurt and I'm dizzy.  I'm terrified this is going to be just like last year's post-Spring Party Weekend sickness that made me want to die.  

I also have three papers to write, a couple tests (who gives a test right before a final, honestly?), and loads of reading.  

Additional fun and games: The guys bathroom was supremely trashed this weekend, and since no one fessed up the whole goddamn floor had to go in and clean.  Am I a guy???  Do I use their fucking bathroom?  Was I responsible for all the cum in the showers that Buildings and Grounds refused to clean up???  (overshare, I know, it was overshared to me too)

Let me think about it...  NO.

It was fun while it lasted, although I'm pretty lightheaded right now from not only walking all the way back up the hill from the courts, but also from walking up 5 flights of stairs back to my room.

"event","I just read ""Blood and Chocolate"" by Annette Curtis Klause.  I originally picked it up because I heard it was being made into a movie, and that pretty much all the YA authors I idolize idolize Annette Curtis Klause.  It was good, but I'm not going to sprint out and buy everything she's ever written.  It was actually pretty depressing, and I'm curious as to what they did to make it into a movie...I feel like they must've raped it to make it more palatable to audiences.  Hm...NetFlix can satiate my curiosity, I suppose.  I guess some of the characters just irritated me and I wasn't really in love with the voice/style of the writing, but it was still good.  It's no Tithe, but I suppose I shouldn't hold everything to that standard.  :)  It was definitely preferable to Frankenstein and the Tale of Genji (both of which must be finished in their entirety this weekend...::dies::).  

What book is next for me to consume?  I'm pretty sure I've read more books for my own enjoyment in the past 2 weeks than I have in the rest of my time at Colgate.  I have ""The Red Tent"" which I borrowed from Peggy last semester and started, but had to stop because it was messing up my Bible knowledge in Western Trads.  I can just imagine me scrawling on the final...""Everything I need to know about the old testament I learned from The Red Tent.""  That would've been awesome.  XD  So I could finish that, or I could finish ""The Naming,"" which I started over winter break.  I always have Hokkaido Popsicle under my bed (it goes everywhere with me, like Tithe).  I have Eragon, I have Inkheart, I have some historical novel about a spy called the pink carnation.  I have some Jacqueline Carey under my bed, as well as some Terry Pratchett Michelle lent me (I promise, you'll get it back soon at the rate I'm reading these days).  

Ugh, my head hurts and I feel dizzy and I feel the build up of mucus in the back of my throat that signals I'll be drinking lots of water soon.  I really, really hope I'm not coming down with the 12 thing everyone has been getting.  I do NOT need to be sick right now.

There was another purpose to this entry, but I can't remember it right now...

"event","Oh, I forgot.  I meant to chronicle my Strange Occurrence of the Day (henceforth to be recognized as SOOTD).  

Today's SOOTD: The Captain Crunch Files

So, I was walking downward into the spiraling maze that is Dana Arts Center, a.k.a. where I work in the University Theater box office.  I made it all the way to the ground floor where the office is, only to find that the girl who has the shift before me scooted out of there before I arrived, the result of which being that I had to trudge back up all those flights of stairs to where my boss-type-thing's office is and obtain the key to the room from her.  (In case you're wondering why I don't just walk in on the ground floor where the office is, it's because it's actually shorter to go from my dorm, to the roof of the building, and walk down through it than to walk around and down the hill to the normal entrance.)  Anyway, I walk in her office and there's a guy sitting in the chair next to her desk, and they're talking.  As I glance at him, I realize I'm trying to discern whether he's a student or someone else.  He had the appearance of someone who could either be an upperclassman or a very young professor.  I guess that really doesn't matter though, and that was just me being curious.  They pause their conversation as I walk up, and I say good morning to Maxine (boss-type-thing) who is a real grab bag, I never know whether she'll be super-nice or super-stand-offish.  She seemed on the nice side this morning, seeing as she actually smiled when she said good morning back.  As she's digging around for the key, I turn to look at the UIP (un identified person), who appears to be fixing me with a stare.  He had reddish hair and an indie-beard (do you know the kind I'm talking about?), and he wore glasses, and his clothing screamed theater kid (not surprising, since this does take place in the theater building).  He just seems like the kind of person who doesn't buy the whole Colgate prep thing and just does whatever, which I respect immensely.  But that really has nothing to do with anything - suffice to say, my weird kid radar had started bleeping.  So he's kinda looking at me and I quirk an eyebrow at him, because it's early and I have a test to study for and actually forming words takes too much effort.  The inkling of my weird kid radar proved to be spot on when he opened his mouth and said: ""If I asked you to elucidate all the possible dangers of eating Captain Crunch for me in the next two minutes, could you do it?""  

I blinked, and then something in my mind clicked and just decided to go with it because this was so much more interesting than the questions I usually hear and expect, like ""What's for dinner at Frank?"" and ""What happened in class today?"" and ""Do you have any beer?""  So, I explained that I didn't think it would possible for me to betray Captain Crunch in that way because it's my favorite cereal.  

""But, what about the crunch?  Don't you have to let it soak in the milk for a little while, or else you'll get little pieces of cereal impaling your palate and gums!"" he said indignantly.

I mulled over this valid argument before responding.  ""I kinda like my palate being stabbed..."" I mused, trying not to sound creepy.  ""It's better than soggy Crunch.""  

He raised his eyebrows and leaned back like my counterargument was actually a good one.  ""Ah, so we've finally found one..."" he said to Maxine, who was dangling the keys in front of me.

As I left the room and headed back down the winding staircases of doom to go do work, I was making a valiant effort to not burst out laughing in the creepy, echo-y silence of the arts center.  But seriously...what are the odds of having a conversation like that?  Maybe I'm going to be initiated into the Brotherhood of Those Who Adulate the Underlying Masochism of Captain Crunch.  I think I am in desperate need of more experiences like this to brighten up my otherwise uninspiring existence."

"event","I did it again.  The book thing, I mean.  Except I read all day in the box office instead of staying up till three in the morning.  No, instead I'll probably be staying up till three writing my French paper and studying for my Japanese test.  I think I'll skip reading Frankenstein.  

That Amazon order didn't last long at all.  I think because I haven't read books I actually want to in so long that it all just burst forth in the past two weeks.  Or maybe all my hostility and frustration in the school department has been sublimated into me becoming a voracious reader (no, I did not read everything ever written by Freud in the last week).  

So, go read ""Poison Study"" and ""City of Bones.""  At least Poison Study's sequel is out right now, with the third on the way...  As for City of Bones, the sequel, despite the fact that it's been already been edited and turned in (no I'm not a creepy book-stalker), will not come out until April 2008.  A freaking YEAR away.  I can't deal with this.  City of Bones was good, but it leaves you with this sort of unsettled, where-the-hell-is-this-going-to-go feeling, so I'm pretty sure the next book should be on the shelves of Barnes and Noble (actually, Amazon would probably be more up my alley considering my current location, but they unfortunately do not have shelves), like, tomorrow.

Also: Is it sketchy that I'm going to try to con my mom into detouring to Chicago on the way home from school so I can go to a Holly Black/Cassandra Clare booksigning???"

"event","So, books were a bad choice.  I thought I would pick up Tithe and read it over a couple weeks during my free time, so that when Ironside came out I would be all up-to-date and ready.  Instead, I finished it on Saturday.  Yesterday, my Amazon order came unexpectedly early and, seeing as it was Monday evening, I was hopeless to resist the lure of something new to read.  So I picked up Poison Study at 6:30, could barely tear myself away to take pictures for the newspaper at 8, and when I came back from that I read straight through until 3 a.m.  Perhaps not the best choice, but it was a good book.  Only problem is, now none of my homework is done and (more distressingly) I want the sequel.  Boo!  If only I could read my textbooks with comparable passion.

I'm currently looking for suggestions for books to read.  I've been craving some urban fantasy, but anything you've read lately (or ever!) that you thought was worthwhile, could you please make some recommendations?  I'm as much a literary hedonist as I am a music one, so anything, anything at all...  

I'm seriously just thinking about going to bed right now.  I'll just do my Japanese homework at the box office tomorrow morning.  

How is life in the rest of the world?  Write me a haiku.  Y'know, in honor of National Poetry Month.  I don't care what it's about.  It would make me very happy, though.  :D

So I was punching and shaking and jumping into the machine, trying to dislodge the chips from where they were stuck.  If I weren't starving, it would have been funny that at least two tour groups watched me in horror as they walked by.  I can just hear the tour guides now...  ""Don't worry, she's not our *typical* student...""

It reminded me of the time when I was taking Chinese at GCC and my food got stuck in the vending machine (why??? it always happens!) during the break in the 3 hour class.  Right as I launched myself into the machine to reclaim my dinner, this really attractive guy walked out of a nearby classroom and gave me a funny look.  So, I guess this cloud has a silver lining: Tour guides are *not* hot, and I don't need to impress them.

Ha, search for the ""Build God, Then We'll Talk"" video by Panic! on YouTube.  I'm pretty sure you have to be registered to watch it because of its ""questionable content,"" which probably also explains why it's not on TV.

Seriously, if I dole out a meal plan credit for a freaking meal at the freaking Coop, I expect it to be edible.  I don't even expect it to be *good*, mind you, just suitable for consumption.  Now It's almost 9 and waves of stomach acid are sloshing angrily in my tummy and I don't have a dinner meal plan to use and I don't want to go out after 9 into the pouring rain to walk *back* to the horrendous Coop-place to use a late-night meal plan on another disgusting meal.

I can't wait until I live in an apartment and have a real kitchen and real food.

Bah bah bah.  Life sucks this week.  Two exams down (one executed poorly, the other executed okay-ly), many more to go.  Japanese one was okay, she didn't throw anything too crazy at us like she did with the last kanji quiz.  Core Japan midterm sucked ass, the suckiness of which was accentuated by the fact that I spent so much time studying for it.  Out of the list of 42 IDs he gave us, only 5 were on the test (two of which I'm pretty sure we never talked about in class).  Still, I rocked those because I studied.  Then for the multiple choice, I knew a whopping 1 question for sure.  I just guessed on the rest and managed to rack up an extra credit point because I happen to have seen Seven Samurai and could answer a question related to it.  After all that biznass, I had to do two essays.  And, out of the three he gave us to prepare, he managed to include the one I was least prepared for.  By that time I had only 15 minutes to write each one, so they kind of were terrible.  Fucking sweet.

I know I should work on massive reading assignments and my paper, but I really just want to sit and stare off into space and brush my hair.

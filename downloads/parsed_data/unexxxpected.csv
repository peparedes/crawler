I got my little kid in child development, shes cute but she doesnt listen to a word I say or care that I'm even there, its kinda funny cause I have to  chase her around the room everywhere to keep up with her. Oh well.


I got my permit today, how exciting. I almost failed the eyesight test though. I need to get my eyes checked now, wtf.

School has been stressful and my grades are now starting to drop, eh oh well I'll live.
I need to stop being lazy and actually go to a driving class, ive signed up but havent gone yet. 

Well thats all.

I cant wait till I go up to uconn one day and spend the weekend there, and next weekend me n mandi might possibly be visiting abe over night, that would be a blast. Anyways I'm tired and dont feel good. Off to bed."

"event","School sucks..as always
For ASAP(active students against prejudice) lisa,mandi and I are trying to have some sort of concert which will be bringing all different types of music together, we've talked to our advisors and they agree with our idea but now we have to convince our stupid principal whom we've been told probably will not like this idea, but screw him.
We talked to scott from doublethink and he said he would absolutely love to do it so they will be there and once we find out the details we will be emailing the smyrk, and some girl in asap said her boyfriends a dj so we will have music playing between each band.
If anyone knows any band that might be interested in this that would be helpful.


Anyways, my birthday is on wednesday. woo hoo. 16 finally.
Tomorrow is 2 months for Nate and I. how exciting.
I feel like crap right now."

But anyways school is really hard this year and missing today probably wasnt the greatest idea, I'm pretty behind in history and I have no idea whats going on in pre calc.

Yesterday hung out with Nate :) I kicked his ass in everything we played. 

I'm looking forward to this weekend. Friday I'm going to the north haven festival with nate. but saturday im going to the east haven one and joe and possibly ciro will be coming down from uconn :). Sunday I want to hang out with nick because im not sure when he goes back to college  I want to see him before he goes. I should probably warn him about this.

Like ive always been close with mandi tony and abe but after today being able to laugh the whole entire day over stupid things I've realized how much these people mean to me and how close we really are. Like i can do or say anything and they wouldnt think any less of me, but abe is sadly leaving us for college on the third and things wont be the same :(. anyways after leaving tony and abe me and mandi went to the doublethink show and got to see scott, hes such a nice guy. Hes like such a happy and loving person that it can really cheer a person up. I was sad that doublethink didnt win at battle of the bands. they really should have and im not just saying that because I love them.

Today was one month for me and nate, well technically since its past midnight i should say yesterday..but oh well. Hes a great boyfriend and means a lot to me.

anyways im off to bed soon Im visint joe and ciro tomorrow at uconn that should be fun."

It was good to see people that I haven't seen in awhile, and I know ciro joe and abe appreciated it and were having fun. It was really good seeing nadia and nathaly and hearing there crazy stories of what they've done over summer. It was kinda sad when everyone left and we gave them all there final hugs before they leave, its not like I wont see them again but I dunno it wont be the same. But hey it happens, eventually we'll all be leaving.

Summer is over in a few days and that sucks. I have no idea how I'm going to wake up early, I haven't woken up early once all summer. This sucks. and I still have to answer the questions for summer reading. ughhh. 

anyways, its one month for me n nate tomorrow. woo hoo. sadly i wont be able to see him tomorrow though, I'm going to a doublethink show which I've been dying to go to."

Its sad because now that its been almost two weeks, it seems like shes been with us for a lot longer then that and Im so used to seeing her everyday that its going to be weird. These two weeks have been like the best of my summer, we've had so much fun. Its been a lil crazy at times to plan things but thats allright.

Things sometimes are going crazy with nate, we both have crazy schedules and rarely have time to see eachother. I see him like once every like 10 days and it gets annoying. Its a rough start but im sure itll get better. Sometimes i wonder though. Everyone gets doubts. I just sometimes don't give things a chance.I over think everything."

I've been having so much fun though I dont want her to leave, ill miss her. The other day I went to lake compounce and had sooo much fun. But now im dealing with the sickness and sunburn. I felt like crap but i still went out last night. We went to some cafe in new haven and some lady who referred to herself as shakespeare lady wanted to recite some shakespeare for some change. THen we went back to abes house and played ddr and kkr. It was an interesting night. We had to bring maria back to her uncles house which is an hour away, so we left at 12 and didnt get home till about 2:15.

Today im goin to toads place to see rickys band again. Nate will be coming with me so that will be fun. well I gotta go get ready."

"event","Well today was a very stressful/exciting/emotional day. We were supposed to pick maria up at the airport at 6:05 and around 430 mandi came to my house and abe should have been there in a few minutes to pick us up, then we realize we cant get a hold of him so we call tony and make him walk down the street to find abe, it turns out abe was asleep and his alarm clock didnt go off--so lets just say we were running like a half hour late which was a lil stressful, it turns out her flight was delayed so that bought us some time we got there around 630 and searched around until we found where her plane came in. You dont even know how crazy it is to see someone walking towards you that you havent seen in three years, at first we couldnt tell if it was her, but then the hugs immediately started and my tears, ofcourse I started crying, it was very emmotional. but then things went right to normal as if she was always here with us. Anyways, we went to dennys right after that and our waiter thought we were stoned because maria said ""im stoned""..and we were acting like morons..so we attempt to leave and ofcourse mandi has to leave her trademark of being clutsy and walked into the sign completely knocking it over and breaking it, making an extrememly loud bang in the restaurant, that was the funniest thing ever. So after leaving there we went to one of marias relatives house and layed on the hammock and just chilled, it was nice. It was sad to leave her, even though we will see her saturday, well that is all, goodnight.

He made me chocolate covered strawberries which is the cutest thing in the world cuz i told him how much I liked them. So we went out to dinner then rented the butterfly effect which was an awesome movie and then we just hung around for a bit. I walked him out to his car and he told me not to look and he takes out a rose and then he says I know u think my memory stinks( i always make fun of him cuz his memory is terrible) but i remember that today was a month since our first date and then he asked me to be his girlfriend, it was sooo cute and ofcourse I said yes, for awhile I had doubts about where this was headed..but after tonight I know that I can stop doubting it and that we can be together.

I guess its like I want to be with him, but then at the same time I worry that I'm not ready to actually be with someone. I dunno I'm stupid I think i over analyze everything and always worry about things instead of just letting myself be happy. I mean he seriously is the perfect person for me, yet why do i have those second thoughts. Its weird and annoying. but anyways he has a surprise for me on wednesday but knowing him it will be something corny, and its the lil corny things he does that I like the most about him

Anyways, I went to tonys house today. joe abe and matt were there and we did absolutely nothing, I had to go home early and forgot to call luigi and tell him that i couldnt hang out with him later and now hes mad at me and I feel like shit like seriously.

After the show we all went back to my house and made dinner. Me n mand made chocolate covered strawberries which are the best thing on earth, but I think they  made me sick, I ate way to much. Then we played this cool play station thing abe bought and just hung out, they didnt leave till about 3 in the morning. Yesterday we went to olive garden, which is so stupid of me seeing as how I need to save money for when maria comes down, which is in 4 days by the way. WOO HOO! We are going to have a lovely trip to some airport in new york. but anyways after dinner me n gel slept at mandis dads house. Saturday I think is the Korn concert which I'm not to excited about, but who could decline a free ticket and I'll get to hang with maria so itll be ok. Today I think ill be hanging out with Nate, I miss him already.

Doublethink kicked some serious ass, they sold the most tickets for the preshow so they got to play for the real show and I was so happy for them :). but man scott smothered us in love tonight and so did his friend who is a girl and it was weird because she knows me as the girl with the ass so when she approached me she bent down and looked at my ass to make sure it was me, and then said she wanted to see it. That was reallllly weird, but shes nice(in a weird way) But anyways, thornley was good as well. the other ones I didn't really enjoy, I'm not gonna lie but I did enjoy staring at the bass player who was extremely hot.

but yeah now im enjoying a yummy wendys salad. I bet your jealous.

Since abe is going to be a cook he made us an awesome dinner, fun times.Joes party was also fun, there was a lot of ppl, but there wasnt tooo many so at least we had breathing room. Nates in vermot for a week, its been 4 days. I miss him dammit.But he says he has the perfect date planned for when he returns, and he swears on it.

Casey just informed me he saw orlando bloom in new york, he swears he did. Don't know if i believe him, but I am jealous if he did. Dam him.

Anyways me being the cook I am cooked us up some shrimp and then we had ice cream MmM. We also acted like immature losers and had mandi call random ppl and talk to them. We did actually catch angelicas boyfriend in a lie, which I dont think was one of our better ideas to call him cause I don't know if there mad at each other or not now. 

On a random note my phone talks. When ppl call it says there name. Its kinda creepy though, the ladys voice scares me.
On another random note I think we might be getting a new car possibly.

"event",". Well haven't gotten around to updating lately, my days have been busy lately and my computer has been crappy. Last weekend was awesome. Three days Grace concert was a definite fun night. A 12 year old girl was arguing with Tony's brother because a lot of people were sitting on the ground cause our legs hurt and she couldn't get to the front so she started acting likea bitch because her 6 year old sister couldnt see. Oh man, a 6 year old definitely belongs there too..right? but it was kinda funny when she asked him if he wanted to know what she had for breakfast and then said a whole bowl of I dont care. Yeah, that was hilarious. We all slept at Tony's house that night and the next day we just all hung out.

Finals are coming thursday and I'm not looking forward to them. Dammit. Next year is going to be way too hard for me. Taken all honors classes and 1 AP class. I'm gonna have to try harder next year i guess :/ ...Im tired

"event","well lets see this weekend was very very eventful with some good and bad things..where to start..

prom on friday was well to say the least interesting...I cant really say fun..but interesting describes it well. I was running late on getting ready, me n mandi were plannig to meet with some friends to take pics around 4...but the lady who did my hair was running 40 minutes late and the lady that did my makeup was running late also, so i wasnt ready till like 4. I had to take like 100's of pictures it was crazy. Our limo driver was physco and I'm not even kidding, I've prolly told most of you all about him. Mandi looked pretty, as well as everyone else. I didn't really dance much beause mandi wudnt dance..our dates wouldnt dance, and I felt to bad ditching them but I did end up ditching them for like 20 minutes and danced with some friends so that was a lot of fun when I did that. I cant wait to get the pics developed, I'll prolly post some up here later on. after prom was kinda gay so we left early. Went back to my house and slept there...

Saturday went to the movie to see shrek 2 with mandi mike and ron, shrek 2 def wasnt as good as the first one and it was too short in my opinion,oh well. Right after that me n mandi went back to my house and waited for abe tony and joe to come over. Problem was we were locked outta my house and the garage wouldnt work. So me n mandi spent like 20 minutes out in the cold playing with the garage code. We even kissed the garage hoping maybe it would open if we did. Then we realized that the battery was falling out and u had to hold it in and then it worked! We all watched Battle Royale which is a very sich but intersting movie.

Sunday was the best me n mandi woke up and immediately started baking a cake for abes surprise graduation party. We then made signs and banners, got ready and then went to tonys house. We set up all the decorations at his house and then realized we needed balloons sooo we walked to A&P. when it was finally all done tony called abe..we all hid and joe was being an idiot and trying to ruin it. Thats when I turned into a bitch and got pissed and was screaming at the kid.Oh well he had it coming. It turned out nadia started screaming because she was scared of tonys dog(she doesnt like dogs) and the surprise was ruined anyways. but oh well we had a VERY fun night. It was great. Everyone was there. It ended around 130 and we all lost track of time. We go to mandis house afterwords and we walk in her door and the door falls down and lands on the computer. I felt bad but at the same time it was kinda funny, nothing was broke so its ok.

Today Im supposed to go to a party but seeing as how mandi hasnt called me yet I dont know...grr..

Well yesterday we were stuck out in the rain. I was cold and wet and wasnt really enjoying myself and Nathaly found it as a photo oppurtunity and took those lovely pictures. I think I am looking dead sexy, the rain really adds lovliness to my hair and I wear mike ortizs hoody well.

Tomorrrows prom and honestly I'm not looking forward to it at all, but I hope at least I'll have fun. The people me and mandi are going with are getting a bit annoying. I feel bad but oh well. The rest of my weekend is going to be fun at least.

And wait theres more..I made Nadia and Mike pretend they actually liked eachother and take a picture together, don't they look cute.

Anyways, I've been up to a lot kinda in the past few days. Monday went mini golfing with mandi and ron, almost died, seriously.But i won at mini golf so thats all that matters. Mike came over so we could finish our project, took us 6 hours then watched a movie. Someone stole 30 bucks from me today and I'm pissed, assholes. Oh well. So far my next two weekends are already planned which is kinda annoying but will be fun. Prom will be so much fun, just because I'll get to be with a lot of my friends and we will have fun.

I'm trying to make sure I don't make any stupid mistakes like I know I probably will. I'm just hoping I will be careful with my decision on things. I don't want to hurt anyone or be hurt. well that is all.<3"

SOme girls like to complain about my skirt for no reason. eh oh well. thats east haven. After school mike came over so we could work on our project. We tryed to do our project but then got bored and watched a movie, ate dinner, attempted to work on it again, got bored, watched tv. So all and all it was an ok day I guess. Actually it wasn't, but oh well. I'm definetely not looking forward to anything right now, not even the weekend. I gotta go to rhode island and I just dont wanna go. oh well, school will be out soon."

"event","Yes the neverending drama of my life is beginning again. Just when you think someone is totally out of your life and doesn't want anything to do with you they come crawling back the second they make a mistake.Yeah they finally realized that the people they have been ditching us for dont REALLY care like we once did. Ofcourse I am a sucker for caring, so I lend them my support although they would never give me the same support. It's annoying when you think about it, almost anyone can lean on me in their moment of suffering, but then wouldn't do the same back for me, not that I have any suffering right now. Knowing all this I'd still do all I can to help them to get better. As much as I can try to say I don't care. Well I really do. Maybe thats my flaw--I care too much.

Well getting that out was good. Anyways, I think I have been way over stressed about things lately, which isn't helping to make things better.  Everyday it seems I have more problems or things to do, and it keeps piling up higher and higher, which will eventually cause it all to fall down on me. Oh well, I can deal.  Maybe I'm just overanalyzing things.


On the better side of things.  New friendships have been forming with pretty cool people, which is making things a lot easier.

Well thats all <3"

I found this picture of mandi and found it funny. Mandi is so ghetto.

Anyways, this weekend has been good I guess. Hung out with mike mandi and ron on friday, we went bowling and then went to the Smyrk show. The smyrk was so awesome that night. The best I've heard them. It was fun. Ron is the kid mandis going to prom with and its hilarious because he doesn't talk like ever, so we were trying to get him to warm up to us, but It didnt work. I kinda felt bad for him. I've still been pretty busy which I guess I'm kinda getting used to.  I got into a big fight with my brother yesterday, we were killing eachother, and my mom just sat there and watched and yelled. I felt bad afterwards though cause he's sick and he couldn't breath. Oh well, his fault. Today I don't even know what I'm doing. Sundays suck as far as im concerned."

Yesterday was ok, went tanning, went shopping, dom and matt came over till like 9, i showered and ate, Mike called at 10 and I talked to him till like 1130, so I didnt get much sleep, but thats ok.  Today Me and Mike played match makers and now Mandi has a prom date so she shall be attending with us, which will be awesome cause I love mandi ofcourse, who knows what will come of mandi and this kid. You never know. When I got home I had to write an english paper, then do my algebra 2 hw, and then write the health essay, it sucked. I finally can just relax for the rest of the night. woo hoo.

I guess you'll have to see it. It was like 330 which was kinda expensive, but my dad wanted me to have a nice dress, he actually wanted me to go, which was surprising. I also got shoes and stuff which are also pretty. Im excited about it now. I'm gonna have fun."

"event","I dunno why but I've been kinda upset lately..which doesn't really make much sense to me seeing as how nothing real bad has happened. eh oh well. Yesterday I attempted to find a prom dress at the mall, but that was a failed attempt. I really liked one, but it was too long and I want to look other places first. but one thing I learned is never go dress shopping with ur parents, they are no help, well mine aren't anyways.  Last night I went out with some friends, which also turned out to be quite depressing because no one is ever in a good mood including myself, for the most part I'm at least fighting or arguing with one person at all times. Or someone is always mad at something and doesn't want to talk. I'm not saying anything bad about anyone, but c'mon we all got to learn to cheer up a little. Hopefully all this crap will pass. I think I'm going to the mall again today with some people and then later on I'll be going to the doublethink show, I will definetely cheer up when I'm there, its impossible not to have a good time when doublethink is playing. I love them. well that is all <3"

Today after school I was going to go to the mall with tony abe and mandi..but I couldnt get a hold of mandi, and I actually needed her to go otherwise I wouldnt be able to,so that sucked, but then my friend Dominic walked to my house and we then went to his friends house and hung out there for a bit, it was fun.

My computer teacher told me I was student of the month today and took my picture, woah I didnt even know they had students of the month, I don't even do anything to deserve it, so that was kinda the funny part of my day. I got a 68 on my algebra thingy, which is better than I thought I did.  I feel like such a two year old, I have to make a 3-d dinosaur for Biology, I thought I would be done with dinosaurs by now. Guess I was wrong.  Some good things have been coming about lately, I've been in a good mood. I hope things stay this way. Well that is all for today."

My last CISP meeting was thursday, It was sad to say goodbye to some people because some of the people in the program are a lot nicer and fun then most people. We did our dance on stage, we messed up pretty bad but who cares, we had fun doing it. Friday I had a party to go to, it was fun, although everyone seemed to be in a bad mood and many were depressed so it kinda was destroyed by that. Saturday went out for dinner with some people and Sunday went to Joes party, there was way to many people there. Today I don't know what I'm going to do yet, It's nice outside, I want to go outside. My computer has been going to slow lately so I havent felt like going on."

It was called suicide club and its a japanese movie and it has subtitles and crap, now I thought it would be bad, but it wasn't. It was about these people that commit suicide. I definitely can't explain it by typing its a very confusing movie and sick. The sickest part was when the little girl walked into the kitchen to ask her mom if she could have some chocolate and the mom started cutting her hand off into pieces, the little girl went into the living room and told her dad that her mom is funny . one girl was sitting by the oven reading something and next thing you know she opens the oven and sticks her head in it.

friday was the fashion show. I was nervous as hell, Hairdressers came 1 1/2 hours late and didn't bring makeup, assholes. I hated my hair and I hated my dress. It all turned out ok I guess. I might have pictures to put up in a lil bit. Afterwards went to mikes party.

Saturday went out to dinner with a few people. Good food. Sunday went to the mall. I hate shoppping.

Today made me sick, I really sometimes cant stand the people in our school. They make a big deal over nothing, I can't stand the fact how whenever I do something its brought up around the school to people I dont even talk to and then I'm bothered about it. Oh well I'll live. I got to talk to luigi today, it made me happy to know that hes doing ok. That was the better part of my day. Oh yeah and gel got a boyfriend..Awww!"

Spanish was fun cause we made signs for the fashion show and I get to make fun of mike cause his handwriting sucks.

After school I went on a CISP field trip. It was cool. We got to see a bunch of people do tai chi or however you spell it, and it was really cool to watch. Oh yeah and this african guy holy shit he was the coolest guy alive haha. We talked to dave from amity who lisa is in love with..its cute..i felt bad cause he told her she had a lot of freckles and she started crying he didnt mean it in a bad way though but she has very low confidence.

After CISP I went to the mall to get mike ortizs bday present..WE got him a hat that he probably already has and a cool card lol its funny. Oh yeah tomorrows the fashion show so all of you people that have nothing to do come and support us all..believe it or not we all worked hard and well you'll get to see me looking um well ull get to see me..I personally am not too fond of the dress. And after the fashion show Im going to mikes party and staying there overnight. Im gonna fall on stage..my shoes are too high my dress is too long and my feet hurt..so basically im screwed oh well."

Oh well. Right after school I had to go to a meeting to learn how to walk on stage for the fashion show, immediately after that I went tanning and then went to the place to pick out the dress, there weren't many to choose from and they were fucking huge on me.  So I got this red dress and Its pretty but its nothing special It doesnt look to great on me either but thats ok. Right after I finally picked out the dress I had to get shoes and now I have to clean my room eat dinner and shower. Wow today basically sucked."

For some reason this prom fashion show thing I'm in on friday is also stressing me because everything is being done last minute and no one has a clue as to whats going on.  We havent even gone to pick out our friggen dresses yet, we only got measured. So I think tomorrow they'll have the dresses in and I'll go tomorrow to pick one out, and it figures Mikes  party is going to be this friday as well so I'm gonna be going to the party with my hair done and makeup and shit on, oh well.

  Saturday I went to New canan with Mandi to see Nick, His sister was having a party. New canan girls are so stuck up that its funny I had the best night just sitting there listening to what they say and just laughing at them and omg dont even get me started on this kid that was there you could laugh at everything that came out of his mouth.

my birthday is on monday, & duhhh it's gonna suck, like always.
no one has any money, or is 21. & there's no clubs open.
so wtf.
there is nothing to do.

so that is why i say it's gonna suck, there's nada to do.

& this kid emmanuel,who lived in my neighborhood, & went to uhs found me on myspace & decided that he might go to kobe's with me & jasmine. sooo whatever. he asked me if i was seeing someone. ummmm. yeah. i dunno about that.

but, yeah & david.
always on my page.
constantly.
i guess reading my comments & shit & going to my friends page to see what i say back.

why does he still care? 

it's sad.
i know, i should ""move on""

but, it still depresses me.

it still depresses me because he was my best guy friend, the one i told everything & anything to. 
i really did love him.
i fell hard for him.

i do miss him sometimes, why did he have to fuck it up?
i didn't want it to end.
but it had to.
he turned his back on me.

i miss him sometimes, i still don't understand why he would do that to me.
seeing as how he said i was his best friend too.
& his favorite girl out of all the girls he dated.

i never got an explanation of why.
why.
that's the only thing i wanna know.

why would he screw us over.
he get's mad cause i write shit about him on myspace.
& calls me cause he's pissed off.
all i wanna know is why.
i just loved him.

i think about it every single day.
everything, even the simplest things still remind me of him.

like today, i was doing men's department.
i saw these nice dress shirts he would like.
what's wrong with me?

i'm so sad.

i dunno anymore. 

this is really getting to me."

"event","So this is random, but I took a few people off my friends list because either you don't ever comment, or I don't read your journal, you never update or what not, but there is 1 person that added me and I don't even know them, nor did they ask me to add them, or for them to add me. 
Take me off your list plz

There is more people I have in mind in cutting, but since some are friends from school, I didn't, yet."

"event","i have 800 regrets that arent really regrets.  not today, anyhow.  tomorrow may be different.  if i had done some things differently in the last 6 months, maybe the subsequent negative impacts would not have followed.  i've got nothing to prove to you, only to myself.  and thats the worst.  you know why?  because facing yourself is not an easy feat and i sure as hell dont know for sure if i'm ready to that.  but i really think i might be ready.  
all the people in my life who tell me what works for them their way may think that their way is right.  well not for me.  I've decided that when i have a problem, i will decide if its a bunch of bullshit and if i'm making something out of nothing.  shit, if you know me, i'm good at that.  I want to be bad at that.  
i'm tired.  i've decided that i'm getting too tired to deal with this bullshit anymore.  that's why if it relates to men, drama and distractions, i'm not doing it. no more random makeouts or body shots with my favorite bartender.   
I'm officially off the market.  I have a new bf now.  his name is chip and he sucks my fingers in the mornings.  cat slobber is disgusting.  sometimes he makes out with my chin if he's feeling especially frisky.  (it must be those friskies!....ha ha ha.  get it?  friskies, the cat food....at least i crack myself up.)
but really, i'm staying single for the time.  I go to greece in one week and 2 days.  cant count the days fast enough.  I mean, for real, if i can get away for two weeks and be cut off from this reality, I think the benefits will be blooming for me when i return.  
i'm not ready to grow up yet.  i'm still young.  i'm just ready to step forward a bit.  i'm still the hottest thing you've ever seen.
and if all of this shit does not work, well nevermind.  its my master plan, and it will.  and if i hear, ""you know what your problem is"" by some outspoken, know it all, non-understanding, judgemental individual one more time, they can kiss my ass tissue and come to find out that those were the last words they will ever speak to me again."

"event","so, yes, I was one of the luckies to meet MR. AZ himself.  (that would be jason mraz).  After a lovely show at the georgia theatre jason made my sis and I bff by signing our tickets as one signature on each half of the tickets.  he's pretty cute.
dont forget, I have about 50 pics of him from the show, 1 of which i am in with him.  I dig meeting the musicians.

Once again, or twice actually, I just give my ID like I am 21 (although it is clearly dated with 4/23/1984) and get to drink.  I do not understand this phenomena, however, I will continue to use it to my advantage.  Apparently, no one checks the date on ID's anymore.  I do suppose that if I am ordering alcohol, they ID me because they're supposed to, they're not expecting the ID to be underage.  The bitch at Padriac's (in vinings) didnt check the date on my id, questioned me if it was my id, asked me my zipcode, then let me through the door.  So I'm thinkin, score!  she's an idiot!  But when she roasted 3 or 4 people i was chatting with if they knew if I was 21 or not, I decided I had had enough to drink.  I didnt want to push the envelope.  But when dude at the bar ordered me a shot that i didnt really want in the first place, the bartender said she couldn't serve me anymore.  My question:  If it was that big of an issue, they could have asked me for my id again just to double check (b/c I've done that as a server myself).  And they could have also kicked me out.  go figure, dumb bitch.  I drank underage at your bar, and i'll be back in 3 weeks and I hope you do remember me.

And for the second year in a row, I think i cannot mow my lawn.  why?  because the allergies attack me, that's why.  Then it's all over because i think i have a sinus infection now.  sniffle sniffle."

I quit my job.  They can eat my shit.  Currently jobless.
21 days til I am 21. of the legal drinkin age.  What an irony...21 til 21!

I turned down 2 of the best lays I've ever had this week.  What the fuck is wrong with me?  Maybe I just dont want to get laid.  I'm becoming celibate, and apparently, it IS by choice.  Who makes that choice?  I guess I'm the lame-O that decides no sex, even when the penis is 2 feet away from me.  GOOD FOR ME!"

"event","So i'm writing although no one reads this thing.  I am currently doing fine negligent of my confusion.  Not looking to just date around.  Just want someone to enjoy my time with.  Although Chip, M.C., and Tatia keep me great company, it's almost not enough anymore.  I spend my days watching the stupid box alone and being lame, and all I want someone to watch it with.  Is that too much to ask?  I had a date last week, and it went great, but he is seemingly distant toward our future together.  At least he seems preoccupied with other things to go on another date.  (sighs).  So I suppose I have to just hang out for awhile.  And on the whole issue of not getting any, I'm ok with that too.  I've worked too long to give into that one.  Also, to respond to Deanimal's livejournal entry, some boys quit responding to you midconversation when you say you are not the horny type.  We dont need them anyways.  
In other notes, I work 5 shifts a week, and am still broke...and life doesn't seem so much like it is banging anymore.  That should change in about a week or so.  
Give me your shit and I will auction it off on ebay."

HELL NO!  
i do not condone drugs.  I do not condone it in my life especially.  Picking him up would just condone it.  Now he knows I really dont.  And he can sleep in his car.  Yes, i feel guilty about it because he drives a jeep, and it's cold outside.  but whose problem is this really?  Apparently ""this falls way above my standard of expectations"".  And yes, it does.  that's tough love.  Please agree with me.  I actually do feel really bad.  The guilt is worse because he bought me dinner tonight."

i realized that school and making new friends is important but after setting things straight and setting my priorities...i have come to realize that i need to do things not for myself but for God...there are so many things going on up here an i have been not a very good christian~ i need to get myself back on track and need not focus on Him and not on myself~ God should be the center and i haven't been a good child...so i confess that Jesus is Lord over all and i love Him with all my heart and soul. =)"

"event","isn't weird that your day can be ruined when you hear one sentence that makes you feel terrible and so it RUINS your whole day? or when someone invades your privacy and never realizes that they hurt you when they don't listen? and when something that you hoped for happens but then you don't feel better when you get it...OR even when they listen to you and hear you out but still doesn't get the point? and never gives up to invade your life? maybe even keeps calling and talking but in the end it never making sense....or even when it does you don't want to hear it... especially if it was what you were hoping for....but then you don't want it because you got it after the knowing that you shouldn't trust that person? BECAUSE of one sentence...that means SO MUCH but also SO LITTLE. cuz of what had happened...knowing that there is someone there to hold on to but realizing after that one conversation you're falling through a whole where you were pushed into~ 
i'm falling 
and there will be no one to help me 
because in the mist of falling there is no one else with me. 
i am alone and will forever be in isolation. 
i'll never reach the bottom and i will never see day light. 
there is nothing on this earth that can help me. 
the screams gets louder and the hole gets darker. 
as i fall i wonder about how much of an idiot i am.
there is no way to turn back and i am forever doomed.
i pray and there is no one there.
one understands and never will.
i'm falling"

anyways...i don't feel very happy about my birthday coming up no more...yea i'm 18 but it seems like it's not a big deal anymore...i just look at it as another day in ny...but that's ok...i'll probably go out...by myself.........*long pause*

so hopefully no one has been abducted....cause i need to take pictures of janine~ i have so many ideas..hehee can't wait for that and i think we're going to have noodle night with masako and janine...hopefully =P"

"event","...where to start...well went to B&H today to buy some photo stuff..omg it was so packed in there...and it took me approx. 5 min. to find everything i needed cus of the person helping me. he like knew where everything was. i was amazing! but yea masako was overwhelmed by it...then we headed towards korea town and i realized that we were on the same street as matt's hotel so stopped by and said hello...and yea we definitely stood in front of the hotel just talking for 5 min. anyways...this visit to korea town was interesting cause there were some cute guys around and they looked pretty good...of course janine would like them! but i don't think hot asian guys exist...but yea so we came back and had some lunch/dinner. went to take some pics for class and now i'm getting ready to take some self portraits with candle light...so cya~"

"event","ok..finally got back on my computer...and all i needed to do is take the battery out and put it back in...i feel like an idiot..and on top of that i waited almost an hour on the phone for the tech guy to tell me to so that...what an idiot..well, xanga got old and i couldn't log on so i switched to live journal which right now is being very confusing but hopefully by the time i post 5 entries i'll have it all htmled...haha you know i have html skills...anywyas ny is pretty cool. people up here are awesome and some of them remind me of like everyone back home. i miss you guys a lot and i want to see all of you!! but i've been walking around and riding the subway so i know where everything is pretty much...of course i couldn't find a restaurant today...yeah, i'm so bad at directions... but it's all good. 

xing's coming up on tuesday and hopefully he can find his way up here..we're going to go everywhere and chill in times square...lol so if anyone else wants to come up your welcome to!!! lol 

schools ok i guess but their teaching me stuff that i know and i'm reading the odyssey...i don't and will ever like this book...but i need to get good grades...=( so hopefully it will go by quickly... 

but anyways, not much exciting has happened but some idiot opened the door the roof and cause i'm on the 17th floor i can hear it! ahh it's soo annoying! that high pitched beeping!! but yea saw some crazy characters when the alarm was going off...ask me if you want to know who that person was...lol it's so funny thinking about what he was doing...hehee well, i'm out~"

"event","from today's NY Times...

In a political season marked by Republican efforts to outlaw gay marriage, Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday offered a defense of the rights of gay Americans, declaring that ""freedom means freedom for everyone"" to enter ""into any kind of relationship they want to.""

Asked to respond to Mr. Cheney's Tuesday comments, a spokesman for the Kerry campaign said, ""We believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, that it should be decided by the states, and we do not support a constitutional amendment.""

More proof that nothing is ever simple..."

"event","that's it.  i can't take it anymore and even though i'm going to regret it, i'm about to go majorly buck at the NYTimes.
because:

a) McGreevey is an affront to gay people everywhere for blatantly using his coming out as a political cover up, but the NYT is hailing him as an ""honest"" and ""courageous"" hero.  please.

b) just because it's bush and not kerry who wants to move our troops out of S. Korea and Germany does not mean it's a BAD idea.  Our alliance with NATO? dudes! the world is changing-- the cold war is over! Europe has NO military!  WHY in hell are we so worried about pissing them off by moving out our WAY expensive troops so we can deploy them somewhere where it matters? like, uh, i don't know? Sudan? oh wait, Germany said there wasn't a problem there, nope, no genocide going on there. guess we should just take their word for it.  alliances are only useful so long as they're useful-- aside from supporting NATO, which is kind of outdated at this point, why do we have so many troops in Europe? answer me that.

c) Kerry lied about being in Cambodia at Christmas.  this in itself is okay-- i mean, it's sketch, i wish he would just say, ""look i got confused, sorry."" and we could let it go.  but the NYT has completely IGNORED the story just because it tarnishes their precious candidate.  if their precious candidate can't stand up under the SLIGHTEST accusation of falsifying the truth, then why is he so precious?  bad reporting on the NYT's side.

sorry for anyone who had to read that.  feel free to shoot me comments telling me why i've got it all wrong.

wow. i feel kind of cleansed."

also we went to a free dispatch concert near the river-- or more accurately, while we sat by the river eating strawberries and talking about our lives, tons and tons and tons and TONS of drunken/high/smelly people congregated in a very small space from which we heard sounds that were very similar to dispatch music.  i know i'm officially a crank, i can't help it.  the river was pretty though and i got a bit of a tan. and in the morning we had dimsum. yum.

then we got to the ball in all our finery just in time to down like 5 million glasses of champagne, which made me completely ignore the fact that i was in a beautiful dress in a beautiful room surrounded by beautiful people, and instead run around flirting with every single guy i ran into.  oh how humiliating. the evening ended with me in asher's bed, wearing his clothing, listening to ""Eternal Flame,"" over and over and over again while he was in the bathroom looking after mark.  the patheticness of it was amazing.

and the hangover this morning was flamboyantly dramatic.  i just couldn't move.  so instead i wrote out a crappy thesis proposal, and started translating ""The Aeneid."" CRAP.  i want to go to another ball."

"event","okay no more blue!!! YAY!!! just stress. i have a paper due tomorrow and i haven't even started doing the reading for it.  i'm so not amused with myself.  damn orderic to hell.  at least he's kind of fun to read.

so i signed myself up to be secretary of the Collapsible Theatre Group, and we had our first exec board meeting yesterday.  I showed up, and I guess I was expecting to see Mandrea or Thu or Jenn or just about any other sane human being sitting there chairing the thing, but no.  I got 3 random dudes sitting around discussing how the company had no money (a former member stole it) and the company was just a ""shell,"" (i.e. had no members, except for the stealing dude.) And then worst of all, they demonstrated their complete LACK of any theatrical taste by saying that they want to do ""12 Angry Men,"" as their show this year.  That's right, they wanted to do ""12 Angry Men"" a play whose suckage is universally acknowledged by anyone who agrees with me that it sucks.

I'm resigning today.  Why did I somehow think that theatre people here would show the same appreciation for Shakespeare and the like that the Wellsley shakers do? Uh, I don't know...cause shakespeare was BRITISH, maybe!?! People, have some respect for your frickin' heritage.

okay rant finished. i get to pick out my tutorials for next semester today: i want to do this course called ""Scholasticism and Humanism."" I mean, 2 of my FAVORITE things in the world! And my housemate Naima today insulted my shawl and then told me i was one of the most enthusiastic Americans she had ever met.  HEEEHEEEE!! the lack of sleep and signs of stress are starting to show..."

"event","nothing much of any interest to say really.  it's raining (FINALLY i'm getting the crappy british weather that was promised to me.)  on saturday the choir sang Faure's requiem, which was frickin gorgeous then we went out to a variet of lovely bars and asher bought me a bunch of drinks.  then we all ended up in Matt's room, listening to Brahm's 1st Symphony (because he only had Queen and Classical Music.  it was bad.)  by 4 we were all making toast and we set off the fire alarm and woke up the junior dean.  Then this cranky old guy showed up to turn the thing off, so we offered him toast, and he confiscated our bread.  was that really necessary?

in other news, i'm a freak who is incapable of concentrating on her studies. and this is bad. so i think i'll go take a jog or sit around doing nothing for the next couple of hours."

today ""Henry IV"" opens and i had a really weird dream about it, but it was so nice to wake up and feel like i had spent some quality time in the house, even if there were no chairs and they were doing ""turandot."" alas, it was just a figment of my overworked imagination.  i miss all my shakers and i REALLY miss being on stage with them.  blast.

in other news i'm cooking dinner for some peeps tonight and am vainly trying to make it sort of classy.  because somehow i got the idea that i can cook.  What a laugh.  and i have this paper which might not suck, except that i wrote most of it after midnight and haven't reread it yet.  

oh, i went out clubbing on wednesday with a bunch of people, and got mildly trashed, and wore an outfit that will probably not reappear until shakes initiation because that's really where it belonged. of course if it lasts that long, it wasn't exactly made from anything durable, like material or something.

ACH! why do i leave papers to the last minute? WHY! good luck all you shakers, i know you'll be fantastical!!!"

yes, i have a deathwish.

i took it for a spin this afternoon and saw my life flash before my eyes on more than one occasion.  i met a nice lady on the street and told her it was my first time on a bike and she wished me luck.  but honestly, i need a miracle.

but now off to coffee with wendy, and yoga with helen, and hanging out with iona-- that is if i'm not flattened by a bus on the way over."

and i saw kill bill with some people from my house on tuesday.  then we all went out to dinner on wednesday to celebrate rie's birthday.  then on thursday cara woke up and realized that she had an essay due the next day and had not started the reading.  so she sat down to write a livejournal entry because that was the best way to deal with the situation.  oi.  

back to the murder of charles the good-- the murder is not half so good as the absolutely DISGUSTING way they executed the wrongdoers-- rabid dogs, wheels, and angry crows were involved.  yuck. the executioners were just so.... creative. have to admire that.

and now i'm writing a paper on Abbot Suger's thoughts on kingship and Louis the Fat of France who was rather large I take it, though I really know absolutely NOTHING else about him thanks to Suger's absolutely WORTHLESS account of his life.  and i always thought that suger was this warm-hearted little abbot.  instead he's a coniving propagandist who needs to die.  oh wait he already did... drat.

tomorrow i'm going to see romeo & juliet with wendy after choir practice and theatre drinks.  unfortunately i have to miss the historical society's first meeting.  damn.  they all sound so cool.  and historical and stuff.

all right, two paragraphs on the capetian monarchy down, more than several more to go... and the thing is due tomorrow.  ACH!"

On the upside tonight we have jazz and cocktails, which turns out to be a black tie affair.  So here I am, dressed in my snazzy purple frock with lovely black high heels, ready to go and not imbibe anything more adventurous than diet coke at the open bar.  

work starts tomorrow or maybe monday-- i have an essay due on friday about Abbe Suger's views on kingship and I'm actually excited about starting it though I feel like my brain has definitely turned to sludge.  Also I get to have coffee with Wendy tomorrow which will be LOVELY and I may go grocery shopping.  And i joined the chapel choir and get to sing lovely old hymns in a beautiful (if FREEZING) chapel.) for evensong on sunday (they can't just call it sunday service-- it has to be evensong...) we have to wear robes.  yahoo."

"event","finally i am in oxford.  i spent the last couple of days in hereford.  do you know where that is?  ever heard of it?  nope neither have i.  but apparently it was absolutely necessary that i spend my weekend there in the house run by an insane 5 year old, in order to fully experience british life.  on a whole though it wasn't so bad.  i got to hike about in wales in the wind and the rain, hey ho.  and i went out clubbing which was rather random with another wellesley girl, vanessa.

but now i've unpacked and will try never again to even look at my suitcases because they give me great displeasure.  i'm signed up for a tutorial called early gothic france.  and just now it has occurred to me that i know absolutely NOTHING about anything early, gothic, or remotely french.  screwed i tell you, screwed.  and i have to go out and be social and meet new people which is going very much against my extremely anti-social grain. but i will persever, be friendly, open, and interested, and in the end i will triumph.  right? god, i hope so.

i miss all my wellesley peeps and hope that you are all doing well, even if you're not at wellesley because you graduated and became a real adult."

6 days.  i went to campmor today and bought an absolutely HUMONGOUS backpack in which to put many of the essential things i will need.  i had brunch with lis yesterday-- YAY!!! then we saw this jewish dude rap in yiddish at a jewish life festival in washington square.  and miracle of miracles, i discovered that i might be able to plausibly fake an appreciation for robert pinksy!  do you know who he is?  no? good, it makes me feel more pretentious.

so now i need to buy a couple of mugs that show the new york skyline to give my host family.  and i need to have dinner with my aunt jane to talk about internships for next summer-- yuck.  but i think she'll take me to some classy restaurant place uptown.  so i'm way okay with that.

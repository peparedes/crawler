Our test has determined that you possess 
28% Hellbentness, 19% Sanguinity, and 82% Creeps!
Well done!  
""Youuu Raaang?"" Our test has determined that your Proto-Goth icon match is Lurch! 
Lurch, the butler for the Addams family, is our test's Eidolon of Creepitude. While personifying the image of a ""gentle giant"" (he plays harpsichord!), his great stature and quiet, zombielike nature always manage to make the ""normals"" feel unsettled and ill-at-ease. Little is known of his past and if asked about him, Morticia gets a strange glimmer in her eye and says only, ?A shovel, a grave, and a cute little book bound in human skin that my father gave me when I was a child; one of my fondest memories.? Lurch was a wedding present to Gomez from Morticia and her Grand Ma-ma; they exhumed him from the local cemetery and brought him to life via magical incantations. 

The Lurch Files website has the following to say about him: ""In truth, without the faithful Butler, the Addams mansion would probably be a cheerful place to live (eegads.. perish that thought!!)."" 
 
  
This test tracked 4 variables. How the score compared to the other people's: 
  
 Higher than 19% on Hellbentness 
  
 Higher than 23% on Glamitude 
  
 Higher than 9% on Sanguinity 
  
 Higher than 99% on Creeps

"event","You're Siddhartha!
by Hermann Hesse
You simply don't know what to believe, but you're willing to try anything once. Western values, Eastern values, hedonism and minimalism, you've spent some time in every camp. But you still don't have any idea what camp you belong in. This makes you an individualist of the highest order, but also really lonely. It's time to chill out under a tree. And realize that at least you believe in ferries.

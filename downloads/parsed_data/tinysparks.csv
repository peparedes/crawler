<b>Chapter Sixteen: 'Til Death Do Us Part</b>


""You went to my father?"" This time it came out as a question, one that he needed her to answer. 

""Yes."" As Logan pushed out of his chair, Rory immediately jumped to the defensive. ""Logan, I'm sorry.""

He made a move to stamp toward her, but quickly decided against it, instead turning around to face the wall to haphazardly run his fingers through his hair. ""Sorry? Rory how could you do that? You know how I felt... how I feel about him!""

""I had no other choice!""

""You always had a choice. You could've talked to me!""

""Yeah, like that always went over well!""

""You should've tried harder!""

""You are a self-righteous bastard, you know that, right? Here you are putting all the blame on my shoulders when this is all YOUR fault.""

""It's takes two, Rory,"" he bit back in defense.

She sighed in resignation. He was right, after all. She had put up as much fight to salvage their marriage as he did. ""I'll admit that maybe I could've tried a bit harder to reach you, to get you to see me, but what would've been the point? Just like what is the point of us talking? All we do is argue and transfer the blame from one to the other.""

He grew silent for a few moments, breaking the silence only to ask, ""How often?""

""How often, what?""

Logan walked toward her until he was standing in front of her. ""How often do you see him? Talk to him?""

She didn't like him being so close to her and she definitely did not like the way he was looking at her. He was trying to break her in half with his wayward stare and it was causing her knees to buckle...

""I talk to him about twice a week. Sometimes more often than that. We meet for lunch a couple of times a month, too."" The latter came out as a breathy confession, one that she hadn't intended on confessing at all, but flew out of her mouth unwillingly.

""Are you sleeping with him, Rory?""

Rory wasn't even sure what had compelled her to slap him. She just heard the smack the moment her hand contacted with his cheek and even his wild eyes did not have her cowering away or regretting her action. ""I cannot believe that you just had the fucking balls to ask me that.""

Logan flexed his jaw. ""Nice one. I certainly didn't expect that.""

""I want you to leave,"" she said, stalking to the door, throwing it open. She held it open, waiting for him to take the hint. 

After a few moments, Logan moved toward the open door, stopping in front of her to say, ""This isn't over.""

""I believe it is,"" she said, slamming the door behind him, before collapsing against it. It was only after she had slid to the floor that she let her defenses down and welcomed the flood of tears. 



His life was a fucking mess, Logan mused as he reentered his house the following morning. 

He had thought going to visit her in Boston would have him returning with a positive attitude. He had hoped that they'd get all of their problems worked out, but that all fell short when she'd confessed of her business dealings with his father.

HIS FATHER!

Of all people for her to go to why did he have to be his father? Why didn't she go to Richard and Emily? Christopher, even? Why did it have to be the bane of his very existence?

Logan peeled off his jacket as he touched his finger to the answering machine. He rolled his eyes through the messages from Stephanie, damning him to hell for the way he had been treating for Rory. He sighed exasperatedly through the one from Colin blasting him for showing up in Boston after she had made it <i>crystal</i> clear that she was going away to clear her head. And then the last one had him freezing midstep in the kitchen.

""Logan...,"" came his sister's cracked voice. She sounded broken, exhausted and most like she had been crying. ""Logan, please tell me you're home. GOD! Where are you? I've been trying to call you since yesterday. Why do you turn your damn phone off at the most inopportune times? When you get this get to Mount Sinai. There's been an accident. Dad's in the hospital. You need to be here. Logan, please, <i>please</i> be here.""

He felt his heart fall into his stomach.

Despite his utter disregard for his father, Logan grabbed his keys and hurried out the door.

A half-hour later he found himself at the hospital, breezing into the waiting room where his sister sat, sobbing in her husband's arms. She was at his side in a second, throwing her arms around his neck. ""What happened?"" he asked Josh, knowing that he wouldn't be able to understand Honor through her blubbering.

""His jet malfunctioned on the runaway as it was readying for takeoff. They're thinking it was an electrical problem right now. It caught fire and your father is the only one that got out alive.""

""How is he?""

""He's in critical condition right now, Logan. They won't let anyone in.""

""And where's Mom?""

Honor leaned back, spatting out, ""She's in Spain.""

""Spain?""

""SPAIN!"" Honor shouted before falling into his arms, her body convulsing with fresh sobs.

It was going to be a long day, Logan sighed as he held his sister close to his chest.



Rory was making her through the airport terminal when she heard her phone ringing from her purse. Groaning, she stopped to reach into her purse to grab the offending the device. ""Gilmore,"" she spat out.

""Where are you?"" came Stephen's hasty voice.

""Stephen?""

""Yeah. Where are you?""

""At JFK. I'm on my way to baggage claim to grab my bags,"" she said, resuming her walk. ""What's up?""

""I... uh... I don't know how to tell you this... you haven't heard the news?""

Rory stopped dead in her tracks. ""No. Why? What's happened?""

""Mitchum Huntzberger is in the hospital, Rory.""

""What?"" she rasped, her purse slipping from her grasp.

""It's been all over the news,"" Stephen continued as she bent to recover her purse and the contents that had fallen from it.

""What... what happened?""

""I'm not really sure. The networks are all pretty vague on the details. I only know that it was an airplane accident.""

""I told him that that stupid little jet was going to be the death of him! I told him that!"" she spat out angrily.

""I didn't know if you knew and I just... I thought you should know since you and Mitchum are so close and I just... I thought maybe you'd want to be there for Logan.""

Logan! God! She wondered if he even knew... if he even cared. She didn't have time to debate that now. She had to get to the hospital.

Rory quickly hung up with Stephen then made her way to baggage before she hailed a taxi and made her way to Mount Sinai.




Logan was sitting at Mitchum's beside when she walked into the room. He looked so concerned, dejected... tired. Her heart went out to him. She stood there for a few moments silently watching him. His head was resting on the bed, grasping his father's lifeless hand in his own. 

When her feet finally moved toward him, she came to stand beside him, touching his shoulder to gently wake him. When his dark eyes landed on hers, they softened. He bolted out of his chair to envelop her in his arms. ""I'm so glad you're here,"" he breathed into her hair.

""I didn't know if you wanted me here or...,"" she trailed off, taking another sidelong glance at Mitchum's still form.

""You're family. You have a right to be here,"" he said coolly before dropping himself back into his chair.

""How is he?"" she asked him.

""How does he look?"" Logan snapped at her. 

She didn't say anything further after that. They stayed for a long time listening to the music from the monitors, watching Mitchum's lifeless body going through the motions. It was as she made her way to leave that Logan spoke to her again. ""Did you come for me... or for him?""

At first she didn't know what to say. She knew that there was a right answer and a wrong answer and she didn't want to make him hurt anymore than he already was, but she owed him her honesty. It was the least she could do considering their enlightening conversation in Boston just days before. ""I came because I was concerned.""

""Right.""

""Logan, I'm...""

""Rory, it's fine. If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone with my father.""



As the days passed, the tension between she and Logan worsened the longer that Mitchum lay immobile. She tried her best to make him comfortable. She brought him coffee, food, his mail, hell even his work and nothing changed his attitude. He was closed off from her and she had no one to blame but herself. Perhaps her gravest mistake was trying to get him to leave his father's beside. He had chewed her head off, forcing her to scurrying out of the room in tears.

Honor had found her in the bathroom, ready to console her, but Rory refused to let her. She was getting everything she deserved. She had stomped out of the bathroom that day and not returned until the next day, keeping her interaction with Logan very limited since then.

Stephen had dropped by Friday afternoon, presenting her with Starbucks coffee and she had promised to build a statue in his honor. ""How're you holding up?"" he asked, wrapping a comforting arm around her shoulders.

""Fine.""

Stephen eyed her skeptically. ""No really?""

Her deep sigh rocked her whole body. ""I just wish he'd let me help him, but he won't. He's short with me and I just... I hate it.""

""And you think you deserve it?""

""I don't <i>think</i> I  do. I <i>know</i> I do, Stephen. I know that this is all my fault but it still doesn't make it hurt any less.""

""Just give him time, Rory. I'm sure he'll come around once his father is out of the woods.""

""I just hope you're right,"" she said, resting her head on his shoulder. ""I'm glad you came.""

""Me too,"" he said, entwining their fingers together.

It was as Logan made his way out of his father's room did he witness the intimate moment between the two friends.



For once Mitchum's room was vacant. Rory moved to his bedside, falling into the chair beside his bed. ""Oh, Mitchum, this has all gotten so out of hand,"" she said, taking his hand in hers. ""I finally came clean to Logan about you saving the paper. Of course he was furious. We both expected it which was why we agreed that I not tell him. I'm sure he views it as some form of adultery. I'm sure he'll have no reservations to divorce me now and will I be able to blame him? Not at all."" 

Taking his hand into both of hers, Rory brought it to her forehead, continuing along with her monologue. ""I don't know what else to do, Mitchum. Keeping this from him has been eating me alive and I just... I couldn't do it anymore. If these past few days have taught me anything seeing you lying here like this it's that life is short. I can't  go on pushing him away... but I just can't help but think I've lost him for good.""

""You... haven't,"" came the strained whisper from just above her head.

Rory's head shot up, staring into his deep, penetrating eyes. ""Mitchum?""

""Hey there, Rory,"" he said, a cough erupting from his throat.

""Do you need some water?"" He nodded. Rory quickly filled a glass, lifting to his lips. ""Not too fast,"" she coaxed. When he'd had enough, he pushed her hands gently away. ""Do you want me to get Logan and Honor?""

He shook his head. ""No. Just you.""

She moved to sit beside him on the bed, taking his hand in hers once again. 



Logan made his way toward his father's room, stopping short when he spotted Lorelai down the hallway talking to the doctor. Rage seized him, but instead of taking it out on his mother-in-law he decided to take it off on her counterpart. He barged into his father's room ready to ream Rory for allowing her mother to talk to his father's doctor, stopping in his tracks when he saw his father sitting up in bed wide-awake, Rory at his side, her hand nestled with his.

""Logan, look who's awake!"" she said cheerfully.

He stood frozen in the doorway, staring at the scene before him. 

""Hello Logan,"" came his father's gruff reply.

""You lied to me,"" spat out angrily.

""What?"" Rory and Mitchum barked out in unison.

He gestured to their joined hands. ""You're having an affair.""

Mitchum let go of Rory's hand the exact same moment she let go of his. ""Logan this is not what you think,"" Mitchum admonished. He hadn't spoken to his son and years and the last thing he wanted to do was argue with Logan while he was still recovering.

""Then, what is it? It's no surprise mom tramped off to Spain without her cell and no means of contact. She found out about your latest fling!""

Rory hopped from the bed. ""Logan, your father and I are NOT sleeping together!""

""Of course you are. Why else would my father agree to help you with your newspaper? It's not his M.O. Rory. He does NOTHING without getting something in return."" Logan glared at his father. ""What are you getting in return, Dad?""

Mitchum started to respond but Rory cut him off. ""No Mitchum. You don't have to say anything. I want you out of here, Logan!"" Rory shouted.

""What? He's MY father. I'm not leaving.""

""He just came out of a coma. He just survived a terrific ordeal and the last thing he needs is you coming in here and throwing accusations at him.""

He leveled her with a stern gaze, but she didn't deter. ""You can look at me like that all you want, I don't care. If you don't believe that my relationship with your father is anything but platonic, fine, suit yourself. But I won't let you make me feel uncomfortable here. He wants me here. Now <i>go</i>.""

Logan left the room in a huff, slamming the door in his wake.

She turned her head back to Mitchum as he said, ""Thank you for doing that but you didn't have to. I can handle him.""

""No, he's my problem. I'll handle him."""

Summary: Post-Let Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ringing Out. Logan breaks up with Rory, leaving Colin to pick her up after her fall.

<lj-cut text=""I want it to mean... I guess I just don't want to be your rebound guy."">

<b>Chapter Four: More Than Friends</b>

She stood up as he made his way down the sidewalk, picking up his speed as his eyes landed on her. ""I'm sorry... I was a little rattled and I needed someone to talk to and the only person I wanted to talk to was you,"" she spat out, as he slowed to a stop in front of her. 

He smiled at her, glad that she was the one that he turned to. It made him feel useful. ""It's okay. I'm glad you called."" Grabbing her arm, he made her sit back down as he fell down beside her. ""You didn't say much on the phone...,"" he began.

""It was Logan,"" she blurted out quickly.

<i>It would have to be</i>, he thought wryly. He pushed that thought aside as he asked, ""So, what happened?""

She shook her head, unable to voice the words aloud to him. She wasn't upset. She was embarassed. Seeing Logan had put into perspective what she and Colin had been doing. She knew that they weren't doing anything wrong. She and Logan were broken up and she and Colin were... 

<i>What were they?</i> Friends? More than friends? Were they on the cusp of dating? She wasn't sure. And she wanted to be sure. She needed to be sure.

""He showed up the Gazette,"" she said simply.

""To see you?""

""God, no. He was there on business for his father.""

""He was doing Mitchum's leg work,"" Colin repeated. That wasn't a surprise. Mitchum usually goaded Logan into doing his work as a feeble attempt to get Logan interested in the family business. ""Go on.""

""We... had words.""

""What'd he say?""

""Him? He didn't say much. He started to apologize for dumping me, but I told him that I didn't want his apologies."" She turned her eyes to meet Colin's. ""And I don't. I don't need them.""

""This isn't your fault. Logan made the decision to end your relationship.""

""I know,"" she said with a smile. ""This isn't about that. I'm not that broken up about it.""

""You're not?""

She shook her head. ""I saw him today for the first time since that night we broke up and I thought I'd feel... I don't know, something, anything... but I didn't. I did feel embarassed, though.""

""Embarassed? Why?""

""Because of us. Because we've been spending all this time together and no one knows. Because he doesn't know.""

Colin shifted uncomforably on the bench. This conversation was taking an awkward turn. He wasn't sure where it was leading and he wasn't sure if he wanted to know where it's destination would take them. But he felt compelled to keep the conversation going. ""We're not doing anything wrong here, Rory. We're friends, right? We're hanging out. We should haven't to hide it or make excuses for it.""

""But we have been, Colin. Hiding it, I mean.""

He stared at her blankly, not saying anything.

""Why?""

""Why, what? Why have we been hiding it?""

""Yeah.""

He cleared his throat. ""Uh, I, uh... I don't know.""

""You don't? Or you don't want to tell me?"" she asked, hopeful. The more time she spent with Colin, the more she wanted to spend time with Colin. He was easy to talk to. He was fun. In a way he reminded her of Dean, but he also reminded her of Logan, as well. But Colin was different from all of her ex-boyfriends in his own right. 

Hearing the lift in her voice gave him the courage to put his feelings into words. He wasn't sure if she felt the same way that he did, but he would never know if he wasn't honest with her first. ""I never intended to tell you this... I figured we could just continue being friends and it would all...,"" he trailed off, his eyes meeting hers for a brief second before he dropped them to stare at his shoes. ""Well, anyway things are different and I can't continue spending time with you without you knowing."" He licked his lips, then began his semi-confession. ""I've liked you for awhile, but you were with Logan so knew I didn't have a chance. Being your friend has been enough, but it's not anymore. I can't just sit by and be your friend anymore. I know that I probably don't have a chance in hell, but I...,"" his words quickly fell away when she crossed the space lingering between them, pressing her lips to his.

A few sweeps of her lips across his and then it was over. He sat, shocked, and a little bit shaky, when she pulled back. At first he wondered if his overactive imagination had conjured up the kiss from the deep recesses of his mind, but when he leaned toward her and she did it again, he knew that he wasn't hallucinating. 

""Wait, wait,"" he said, pushing her away. ""What are we doing?""

""We were kissing until you started talking.""

""I mean in the universal sense, Rory. What does this all mean?""

She smiled as she played with the lapels on his jacket. ""What do you want it to mean?""

""I want it to mean... I guess I just don't want to be your rebound guy.""

Grabbing his hand, Rory pulled him to his feet, leading him in the direction of her car. ""Where are we going?""

""I want to take you somewhere.""



A half-hour later, they were driving. 

Well, Rory was driving. Colin sat in the passenger side seat, staring out the window, wondering where the hell she was taking him. ""Where are we going?"" he asked again for the umpteenth time since they'd left city.

""Would you just sit back and relax? Geez.""

Colin did not deter. ""I don't like not knowing the destination before we get there.""

""The fact that you just said that you detest the element of surprise subtracts from your coolness factor,"" Rory said glancing at him. ""My best friend Lane will not like you. And neither will Lorelai.""

""Huh? And WHAT?""

Rory couldn't help but laugh. She was glad to have erupted his control. She smiled as she entered Stars Hollow. ""You need to just chill.""

""Hey, I've been here before,"" Colin said, taking in the surroundings as they swept into the tiny town.

""It's my hometown, moron.""

""Where are we going?"" He asked again. 

Rory pulled to a stop beside the curb outside Luke's Diner. ""Out! Out! Out!"" she said, unbuckling her seatbelt.

She pushed open her door as Colin stumbled out from the other side, asking, ""What are we doing here?""

""I was hungry for a hamburger and Luke has the best burgers.""

Colin stared up at the sign above the diner. ""But it says Williams Hardware,"" he said, pointing up at the sign as Rory grabbed his arm, leading him to the door. 

""Come on!""

Once inside, Rory and Colin settled at a table. Colin began looking over the menu as Rory stared outside. ""So... have you ever brought Logan here?""

""How long have you been waiting to ask me that?""

""Since we pulled up at the curb.""

""No. I've never brought Logan here. Logan's not a diner kind of a guy.""

""And I am?""

""Maybe,"" Rory said, catching Colin's eye. They held each other's gazes, but the brief moment was halted when the door swung open and Lorelai Gilmore walked in, appearing beside their table.

""Hi... you're not Logan,"" she said, her eyes landing upon Colin.

""MOM!""

Colin pushed back his chair, extending his hand to the vision that was Rory's mother. ""Miss Gilmore. Hello. Colin McRae.""

Rory watched as her mother shook hands with Colin. ""Nice to meet you, Colin."" She turned her eyes on her daugher. ""So, you didn't tell me that you were coming to town tonight.""

""It was just a spur of the moment thing. I was hungry so I came here.""

""And you brought Colin.""

""Yes, I did."" Lorelai waited a beat, then asked the question that both Rory and Colin knew she was dying to ask. ""Where's Logan?""

""<i>Mom</i>,"" Rory warned.

""What? I just figured...""

""No.""

Colin surveyed the scene between the two women with mock interest. They obviously knew what one another was talking about whereas he did not. ""I'm just... coffee all around?""

""Yes,"" they both snapped at him as he stood up.

""Be right back,"" he said, inching away from the table toward the counter. Sliding onto a stool, he waited for the burly guy in flannel to ask him for his order. ""Three coffees, please,"" he said, glancing back at Rory and her mother in a heated conversation.

""You know the Gilmore Girls?""

Colin nodded. ""I go to school with Rory.""

""Oh yeah? I'm Luke. I'm engaged to her mom.""

Colin exchanged handshakes with Luke. ""Well, congratulations. Colin McRae. So you're the infamous Luke, huh?""

""I wouldn't go as far as to say infamous.""

""No, you are. Rory talks about your food ALL the time. In fact, she never shuts up about it.""

From their table, Rory patted her mother's arm, encouraging Lorelai to be quiet, pointing out Luke and Colin conversing at the counter. ""That's never happened with any of your boyfriends.""

""I <i>know</i>.""

""This Colin has super powers!""

""He really does.""

""So what's the deal with the two of you?""

Rory shrugged. ""I'm not sure, really.""

""Rory, come on. You brought him here. He obviously means something to you.""

""Colin's a friend. A really good friend,"" she said with a lilt in her voice.

""Ah ha!"" Lorelai said, complete with finger point. ""There it was! I <i>knew</i> it!""

""You knew what?""

""You like Colin.""

""What? I do not.""

""You do, too. You have the rosy cheeks and your voice gets all soft and lilty whenever you talk. You like him. It's okay. You're entitled.""

Rory cast a cautious glance at Colin, but he was still talking to Luke. She wondered what they were talking about. She returned her attention to her mother. ""Am I, though? It hasn't been all that long since Logan and I broke up.""

""Honey, he dumped you, you're allowed to move on at your own leisure. However, moving on with one of his friends... I don't know the rules about that.""

""Colin's everything that Logan is not. He's not rich, but he is wealthy. He comes from a prominent family, but they're definitely not as prominent as the Huntzberger's. He's nice.""

""Logan's not nice?""

""Colin's compassionate. That better?""

""He does seem to be compassionate. And he fits around here. He doesn't stick out like a sore thumb like Logan would have.""

""Mom.""

""Well, it's true. Him with his blazers and slacks. Did the boy NOT own a pair of Levis?""

Rory remained silent as Colin rejoined them with their coffees. He handed them out accordingly, then slipped back into his chair silently. ""What?"" he asked when he noticed that both women were staring at him.

""You were gone awhile. Care to tell us what you and Luke were talking about up there?""

Colin shook his head. ""I'd rather not say.""

Rory glared at him, but said nothing further as he picked up his menu.

""I have to be going,"" Lorelai told Rory and Colin. 

""Oh? Where are you off to?""

""Luke promised to fix me dinner, that is if I can pull him away from work,"" Lorelai said as she stood up. She narrowed her eyes at Colin. ""Colin, it was very nice to meet you. I hope we bump into one another again.""

""I can't agree more, Miss Gilmore.""

""Call me Lorelai.""

With a smile, she moved away from their table, meeting Luke at the counter, then disappeared with him in tow upstairs.

""So, that was your mom?""

""That was my mom.""

""She's nice. Not at all scary and bitchy, like Logan described.""

""He did not.""

""He did, too.""

""Hey Colin?""

""Yeah?""

""I'm glad we did this.""

""I am, too.""

""Let's order.""

""Yes. I'm <i>starved</i>.""



""This is nice,"" Colin said as he and Rory walked through the snow covered town. ""It's like out of a movie.""

""I always thought that, too.""

""What was it like to grow up here? I bet it was surreal.""

""Not as surreal as boarding school in Switzerland, I'm sure.""

""Switzerland was nice, yes, but this... tell me about the small town life.""

""You really want to know?""

""I don't know much about you so yes, I really want to know.""

""The PG version?""

""I was the NC-17 version.""

""Okay, you asked for it,"" Rory said and began her tale."

<lj-cut text=""I don't want to be caught in the middle but I suddenly find myself stuck in exactly that place."">

<center><i>Where to begin, how do I start
At the moment love lit the spark
Staring at the dawn, it's impossible to bear
Endless longing hanging in the air
</i></center>


<i>""You could be that guy, Colin. And I'd let you be that guy.""</i>

Her words from the night before ring in my ear. Never before had such perfect words ever been uttered. The more conscientious side of me cajoles myself, baring a painful reminder that she was drunk and she had no control over what she was saying. But then there's that other part. The less logical part that told me that what she said did bare some truth. After all, Rory was more inclined to admit her feelings when she was drunk. She was more forthcoming with the truth.

Not that it made the situation any easier.

I don't want to be caught in the middle but I suddenly find myself stuck in exactly that place.

Logan's one of my very best friends and I know how deeply he cares for Rory. I know he loves her on some sick level, but he IS Mitchum Huntzberger's son, after all. A lasting, committed relationship is not for him. Sure, Mitchum and Shira have been married for the last twenty-something years, but that's not to say that Mitchum was always faithful. We all knew he wasn't. 

Could Logan be different? Possibly. Was he any different? No. 

Logan was the spitting image of Mitchum in every way. He liked to rebel against his father, but that was only because he knew that they were so much alike. Of course, it didn't help that Logan was destined to rule the Huntzberger publishing empire. Mitchum stuck it to him every chance he could get as if he were in line to rule a country. 

If you ask me the Huntzberger's are nothing if not drama queens.

And I'm a little tired of being upswept in all the chaos. Especially now that it concerns the sleeping beauty currently curled up in my sheets.

I tried to leave. Really, I did. I didn't want to be a part of this. I didn't want to be involved in anything that I could regret tomorrow, but as I lay awake, listening to her steady breaths, I realize that I won't regret any of it. I can't. I've dreamt about this moment for entirely too long.

I hear a door open, then close a few moments later. The sound of shoes hitting the floor make me sit up, but it's as Finn bellows, ""Colin! Do you have a girl here?"" that I fly out of bed. I quickly thrust on my bathrobe, then bolt out of the room before Finn happens to find that Rory is the girl that currently occupies my bed. He'll find out, I'll tell him myself, I just don't want him to wake her.

When I step out of my room, I see him standing near the couch. He's staring at the black purse that I had thrown there when we had arrived. The contents had spilled out, revealing her student I.D. 

Eyebrow quirked, he turns to me. ""Is she...?"" he asks, pointing to my door.

""Yes.""

""Did you...?""

""I didn't intend to.""

""Does he...?""

""No?!""

""Are they still...?""

I shrug my shoulders. ""I'm not sure.""

""Didn't you ask?""

I smile. ""No. She was so persistent. I tried to resist, really, I did, but she...""

""... wouldn't take no for an answer?""

I shake my head. 

Finn eyes me curiously for a few moments, then his eyes bug out as he jumps to his feet. ""You didn't want to turn her down.""

.......

<i>I help her into the room and onto the bed, laying her down amongst the blankets. She's still hazy with sleep, muttering words I can't comprehend as I settle her in. As I'm leaving the room to bunk on the couch I hear her call my name. It's soft and sensual and makes every hair on the back of my neck stand up.

Hesitantly I turn to her and a small gasp escapes my lips. I can't help it. She just looks so beautiful against the dark sheets. Her skin shines, glows, even. I have to touch her. I tamp down the urge to cross the room. My feet won't move. I'm paralyzed in the doorway. 

She kicks back the blankets, moving languidly across the room to me. ""I want you to stay,"" she whispers, taking hold of my hands.

""Rory...,"" I needed it to come out hard and demanding, but instead it comes out soft, more like a sigh--a surrender. Yeah, that's what I need to be doing right now, surrendering myself to Rory Gilmore. 

She reaches up to touch my cheek. I close my eyes as her fingers outline the contours of my face. ""I meant what I said earlier,"" she whispers. ""I do want you to be that guy. I want you to be that guy, tonight.""

My eyes snap open. ""We can't.""

Her eyes widen, then drop to my waist. ""We... can't?"" she asks, noting my sudden arousal.

I try not to, but, I smile. I fucking smile then she advances on me and that's it. Every rebuttal that I had quickly disappears and all that remains are the two of us. 

I kick the door closed and we share a smile before our lips finally collide and it's the most amazing thing ever. I sound like a gushing schoolgirl, but I've laid awake in bed nights just wondering how soft her lips were, how she tasted... And now? It's even better than I had imagined. Every fantasy, every daydream doesn't compare to the real thing. 

Her hands are quick and demanding. And tantalizing. Oh so fucking tantalizing. I wish they weren't but every brush of her hand, every agonizingly tender touch engulfs me in a fire that I cannot escape.

I find her zipper quickly as she reaches for the buttons on my shirt. ""I'm glad that you've stopped wearing those damn vests, Colin.""

""You noticed?""

""Yeah. Yeah, I did,"" she whispers as she pulls me on top of her down on the mattress.</i>

.......

Sitting at the counter in the kitchen, Finn asks, ""So what are you going to do? You fucked Gilmore. Logan's not gonna be a bit happy about that.""

""She found out about Logan's extracurriculars during Thanksgiving.""

""Oh,"" Finn says. ""What if you're just...,"" he begins to ask.

""Revenge?"" I supply. ""Yeah, I thought of that."" I stare across the room, my eyes landing on the closed bedroom door. ""You don't think she'd do that... do you?""

Finn shakes his head. ""Rory is not that kind of person, Colin. And I doubt you'd be the person she'd seek her revenge with.""

""I'm in love with her Finn."" The words leave my mouth before I can stop them. 

""You... WHAT?!"" he asks, incredulous. ""How? What the fuck, Colin? She's Logan's... I just...,"" he stammers.

""Lower your voice,"" I chaste him. ""I didn't really realize it until tonight. When she came and whispered my name, bit MY shoulder, I was a fucking goner. Everything I'd been feeling for the last few months... it just all made sense.""

""You're serious.""

""About as serious as handing my trust fund to a stranger on the street."" I shake my head. ""Why'd it have to be her, Finn? Anyone else. Why couldn't it have been anyone else?""

""You can't control who you're attracted to, Colin. It just... it just happens. But if this is what you want and you think she wants it too... don't be stupid enough to let it go.""

.......

Finn will possibly forget everything we've talked about by morning, but he's so fucking reasonable when he's drunk. Why can't he be like this all of the fucking time?

He's so fucking frustrating.

This situation is so fucking frustrating.

I ease back into the room, careful not to make much noise. I don't want to rouse her from her peaceful slumber, but as I softly click the door shut I hear her murmur, ""Colin?""

When I turn around she's sitting up in bed, holding the sheet to her chest. ""Hey. Sorry. Finn got home.""

""Does he know?""

I nod my head as I round the bed to the other side. ""How do you feel?""

""Satiated,"" she answers, a smirk lifting her lips. ""Tired,"" she continues before taking my breath away by admitting, ""and surprisingly aroused.""

""What?"" I asked, disbelievingly.

""Sit, Colin,"" she says patting the bed beside her.

I shake my head. ""No. I-I-I can't,"" I stammer.

She nods her head, then looks away. She looks pained for a minute, then she turns back to me. ""What are you thinking?""

""What do you mean?""

""About me? About... about this? You have reservations. Out with them.""

""I just want to know where we are now.""

""We had sex. We should be sleeping.""

""Rory."" Oh, now the callousness returns. <i>Now?</i> Ugh.

""Colin, what do you want me to say? That you were revenge? That you were agile hands and a warm bed and that's what I wanted, needed tonight?""

""Is that what I was?""

She remains steadfast for a few moments, but then her eyes begin to soften. ""No. I could never... I could never do that to you. To anyone. Sex is not just some hobby for me. It has to mean something. And you... you mean something to me.""

Slowly I sink on the bed beside her. I extend my arm out to her and she moves against me, resting her head against my shoulder. ""I'm sorry if you thought I was using you, Colin. I wasn't--I'm not.""

She entwines her fingers with mine and my stomach does a nervous flip. ""I've wanted you for so long, Rory. I just didn't want all of my waiting and hoping to be a waste and have you return to Logan's bed.""

""I'm not, Colin. I swear. Logan and I are done.""

""You say that now.""

""No, I'm serious. This has been a long time coming. I see that now.""

""I don't want to be your rebound guy, either.""

She smiles up at me. ""You're my all-deserving guy, Colin. Nothing else should matter.""

And nothing else does."

Fandom: Gilmore Girls
Rating: PG
Spoilers: None
Disclaimer: I claim ownership to nothing. 
Summary: Spoilers for 6.18; When Rory finds out about Logan's activities during their breakup, she drowns her sorrows and finds comfort in an unlikely source.

<lj-cut text=""Colin don't give anyone advice. EVER. You suck at it."">

<center><i>There's something broken in my heart
Something I just can't fix</i>
</center>


The thoughts scurry through her head as she knocks back yet another drink. She's hurt. She's disappointed. She's such a fool. Did she honestly think that he had stayed home alone throughout their entire breakup? Could she honestly think that he had done that?

""Why do guys cheat?"" she asked the bartender. ""I mean... why?""

""I... I don't know,"" he stammers.

""You're just like the rest of 'em,"" she spats out angrily.

""Maybe it's time to cool it,"" a voice says from beside her. 

Rory turns to look at the new arrival as he falls into the chair beside her. ""Did he send you?"" she asks, glaring at Colin.

""No. I saw your car parked outside.""

She nods her head slowly, then turns back to look at him. ""Did you know? Did you know about the others?""

Colin hangs his head. ""Yeah. Yeah I did.""

""But... why?""

Colin shrugs his shoulders. ""It's the way he is, Rory. No matter how much time he spent with you, no matter how much he loved you... this is the real Logan. That's a fact that you'll have to accept.""

""What if I don't want to accept it?""

""Then just walk away.""

""That's your advice?""

""Yeah.""

""Colin don't give anyone advice. EVER. You suck at it.""

""Rory... Logan's my friend, but... he doesn't deserve you.""

""Yeah, well... who does?""

Colin threw up his hands. ""I don't know... someone... deserving.""

Rory leaned closer to Colin. ""Got any ideas of who that is?""

Colin could smell her perfume. She always smelled good. Especially her hair. Fruity. Lively. Kinda like her. He found here quite endearing sitting her drowning her sorrows over Logan. ""I... I don't know.""

""Maybe it's you,"" she joked, laughing.

""I don't think so,"" he said, returning her smile.

""Hey Colin,"" she said, swiveling her chair to face him.

He knew that whatever was coming couldn't be good, she was inching closer to him and her hand was slowly creeping up his thigh. No, whatever was coming most certainly was not going to be good. 

Or innocent. 

Or friendly.

""Yeah, Rory?"" he asked, finally finding his voice.

""I... I think I need to puke."" Grabbing her mouth, Rory bolted out of her chair and ran for the restroom, leaving Colin to take a deep breath to steady the onslaught of feelings that crept up on him during Rory's close contact.

""Colin!""

Spinning around, Colin watched as Logan breezed through the door. ""Hey Logan,"" he said as his friend approached.

""Where is she?"" Logan asked, glancing around.

""She's, uh... she's in the restroom.""

""Is she okay?""

""Yeah. Just drunk, but, you know, you shouldn't be here. She's pretty ticked off at you.""

""Will you...?""

Colin nodded his head. ""I'll take care of her.""

""Thanks."" With a longing look at the restrooms, Logan headed back for the door.

When Rory came out a few moments later, Colin picked up her purse, threw some money on the bar, then met Rory by the door. Wrapping an arm around her shoulders, he led her out of the pub. ""Come on. You can sleep it off at my apartment.""

""Could you be one of those deserving guys, Colin?"" she asked, leaning her head against her shoulder as they made their way out into the parking lot.

""I could be. But you wouldn't want me to be.""

""I might.""

""You're drunk.""

Rory shook her head. ""No, no... I think better when I'm drunk. Things are... clearer. And you... you could be <i>that</i> guy. You <i>could</i>.""

With a sigh, Colin said, ""But we both know that I'm not. That I'll never be. You love Logan and even though you're pissed at him right now, you'll work through it.""

She pointed toward the pub. ""But what you said...""

""I meant what I said. Logan doesn't deserve you, but maybe I don't either."" He opened the door for her, ushering her inside his sports car. 

When he climbed in on the driver's side, she was staring at him, her head resting against the headrest. ""You could be that guy, Colin. And I'd let you be that guy.""

""Yeah?"" he asked as he started the engine.

""Yeah,"" she said as he pulled out onto the road and headed back to his apartment.

Rating: PG

Summary: Spoilers up to <i>Viva Las Vegas</i>. Liz confesses all to Max while they're still in Vegas.

<lj-cut text=""I can't sit down and tell you this. I have to... I have to walk. My feet have to move... or else... or else... I won't do this."">



""I thought you'd be at the airport by now,"" she says happy to see him. Her knight in shining armor--always there when she needs him, or, in this case, when she wants him.

She hates that they're at his place, a place that she thought they'd never be... all because...

No! She couldn't think like that. This was all for the best. It was for the fate of the world. This was the right decison. She was sure of it.

<i>Pretty sure...</i>

""I was on my way, but I had this weird moment.""

Her interest is piqued. ""What do you mean?""

He smiles a little, as if he's embarassed to reveal it to her. ""Well, I saw this vision. You and me, jumping out of a cab like we'd just been married in Vegas."" 

Huh. Of all things for Max to see it had to be <i>that</i>! ""That's weird.""

""Yeah, it was like this memory flash of something that really happened, but then...""

""Max. Oh Max,"" she begins to say as the music fades and Maria stops singing. She takes a step back, but Max never lets go of her hand. ""I... there's something that I have to tell you.""

""Okay,"" he says, nodding his head. 

She grabs his hand and manuevers him through the crowded room. At first she isn't sure of her destination, but then she remembered...

She'd stumbled into the gardens when she'd been looking for the bathroom. They off-set the pool area. Finding the doors, she let go of Max's hand as she pushed open the door, walking outside where the gardens were even more beautiful under the night sky, illuminated by the full moon.

She walks ahead of him, trying to get herself together as she summoned the courage to spill all. 

""Liz?"" she hears him behind her. He's so close.

""Max...,"" she whispers, spinning around, nearly tumbling over him in the process.

He takes her hand, realizing that something is wrong. ""You're shaking,"" he says, concerned etched in his tone as he leads her to a table by the pool.

""I... yeah... I just...,"" she stammers as he pulls out a chair for her.

She watches as he takes the chair across from her, waiting for her to tell him what she had dragged him out here to tell him.

Liz jumps to her feet, Max looking at her quizzically. ""I can't... I can't sit down and tell you this. I have to... I have to walk. My feet have to move... or else... or else... I won't do this.""

Max nods in understanding. ""Liz, whatever it is... you can tell me.""

""I've always done what you've asked of me, Max. Always. No matter what. I've never questioned you.""

""No. No you haven't.""

""So when you came to me that night and told me that things had to change, I did it. I really didn't want to do it, but... I had to.""

""What are you talking about?"" he asked, confused.

""You're gonna think I'm a crazy person.""

""Try me.""

She stopped to look at him. She let out a deep breath, then said, ""Remember when you were on your way to New York and I warned you about the Granolith?""

His features hardened as if the memory of that time still affected him--which it did. ""You said that you knew things, but you couldn't tell me how you knew them,"" he said with a nonchalant shrug of his shoulders.

""Right. You told me about the Granolith.""

""But I...,"" he began to object.

""The future you, I mean. The you from 2014.""

""What?""

Liz sank down into her chair as Max sank deeper into his. ""I know it's a lot to take in. I couldn't comprehend it at first, but he was there. I talked to him, I touched him...""

Max's head shot up at her. ""No, we...,"" she said with a curt smile. She blushed as she told him, ""We just... we danced.""

He couldn't help but smile at her. ""Your vision, Max... it was real. It really happened. You... Future Max, I mean, he said we got married here in Vegas. At the Elvis Chapel, to be exact. We were just nineteen,"" she said, smiling at the recollection.

""Nineteen,"" Max whispered, lifting his eyes to shoot her a smile. ""I can't believe we waited that long.""

""What?""

He shrugged his shoulders. ""I always envisioned us marrying after graduation.""

""That's... soon,"" she breathed out slowly. ""We'd be too young,"" she said, shaking her head.

""But we'd be together.""

A few moments of silence fell between them, unanswered questions running rampant in Max's head. Finally, after a few moments, he began to ask the question that he so desperately needed her to answer--truthfully. ""Liz...""

The thickness of his voice made her head shoot up. She could tell by his tone that whatever he was about to say she was to take with the utmost seriousness. And so she would. Because she knew what he was about to say. <i>Or ask</i>.

""I need to know... I know I said I wouldn't ask again, but I just can't make myself believe it... and with what you just said... I just can't help but think...,"" he trailed off. There was a short pause before he forged on. ""You never slept with Kyle, did you?""

Slowly, she shook her head. ""You were supposed to fall out of love with me. That's how he said it would work. How things would change. I did everything I could do to get you to stop loving me... but that... that was the last ditch effort. He said that he'd... that you'd... never be jealous of Kyle, but...,"" she stopped to look at him as the tears began to well. ""I'm so sorry, Max. I'm so, so..."" 

Her apology was shortlived when Max fell to his knees in front of her, molding his mouth to hers.

The burden of the past few weeks slowly lifted off her shoulders as she let herself enjoy the feel of Max's lips on hers. She groaned when he stopped kissing her, but she couldn't help but smile as he began spread gentle kisses across her tear-stained cheeks. ""It's okay, Liz,"" he whispered softly. He tilted his head back gently to peer into her eyes. ""We're together now. I'm not letting you go."""

<lj-cut text=""Our differences is what made us such a good match."">

Rory rapped softly on the door. &quot;Stephen?&quot;<p>&quot;Uh, yeah. Just a second.&quot; She heard him curse from inside the bathroom.</p><p>&quot;Did it come out?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. It didn't,&quot; he said, pushing open the bathroom door. Rory laughed, staring at his wine soaked pants.</p><p>&quot;Stephen, I'm so sorry. I really am.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not yet, but you will be,&quot; he warned, making an attempt to brush the wet washcloth across his pants. &quot;You have got to be the clumsiest person I know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't disagree with you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How are we supposed to go out to dinner when I look like I just peed my pants?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We could always order in?&quot;</p><p>Stephen turned around, chucking the washcloth back into the bathroom. &quot;Ordering in sounds like a good idea. I don't think I'd take well to the people pointing and giggling, thinking that my bladder has a mind of it's own,&quot; he joked.</p><p>Rory moved to the other side of the room where the menus were tucked away in the drawer of the desk. She watched as Stephen made his way around the room, picking up random objects that caught his interest. </p><p>She'd been friends with Stephen Carson since she'd started working at the Centennial. Before then, actually. They had worked together at the Yale Daily News during their senior year. The two of them had clicked instantly. She'd been able to talk to Stephen about things that she had never been comfortable talking to Logan about. She had Stephen had the same aspirations. To see the world. To be a hardcore journalist, a dream that she and Logan didn't share.</p><p>Stephen had moved to Hawaii when his girlfriend's job had transferred, but he returned on occasion to visit his family, and, more importantly, her.</p><p>&quot;I can't believe you're living in a hotel,&quot; he said, moving out onto the balcony.</p><p>&quot;I've always dreamed of living in a hotel. Like Eloise, you know. It's a dream come true.&quot;</p><p>Stephen turned to glare at her. &quot;Don't look at me like that,&quot; she said, knowing what he was about to say. </p><p><em>Five. Four. Three...</em></p><p>&quot;You shouldn't be here,&quot; Stephen pointed out. </p><p><em>Blast off!</em> </p><p>Rory rolled her eyes as he continued. &quot;You should be at home--working on your marriage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't want to talk about this, Stephen,&quot; she said, picking up the phone to dial room service. Stephen stalked across the room toward her, snatching the phone out of her hand. &quot;Hey!&quot; she objected.</p><p>&quot;The food can wait,&quot; he said, placing the phone back into it's cradle. &quot;We've always been able to talk, Rory. I'm here. Talk to me. Tell me what's going on. Tell me why you're here with me and not with Logan?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Chicken,&quot; she said, opening her menu. &quot;The hotel has some really good chicken,&quot; she continued, ignoring him.</p><p>Stephen pulled her menu out of her fingers. &quot;Come on. I think you can do better than that.&quot;</p><p>Rory shrugged her shoulders. &quot;I figured that you of all people would understand that I don't want to talk about this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why? Because I'm going through the same thing? I didn't run away from my problems with Connie like you did.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're here. You're in Connecticut and she's in Hawaii. If that's not running then what do you call it?&quot;</p><p>Stephen sat down on her bed, sighing. &quot;We needed a break. <em>She</em> needed a break. I figured I could either move out for a while until she was ready to have me back or I could come here... to see you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm really glad you're here, Stephen.&quot;</p><p>He smiled at her. &quot;I want to know what's going on, Rory. This isn't you. You've never really given up on Logan before. Why start now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's different now, Stephen. You don't know... you haven't been here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, and you haven't told me much, either. I've called. I've asked. You've always said that things are fine and you decide to drop this ball on me whenever I get into town that you moved out of your house?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry... I just... I didn't want to worry you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, now I'm worried. I'm here, in the flesh and we aren't going anywhere and we aren't ordering any food until you tell me exactly what is going on.&quot;</p><p>Rory sighed as she turned in her chair to face him. &quot;I guess you could say our problems started after Logan overheard Mitchum and I talking...,&quot; she began.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They sat in silence for a long time, sipping at their drinks, not bothering to hold a conversation. Finally after having had enough of his silence, she asked, &quot;So, what brings you here?&quot;</p><p>Logan shrugged his shoulders as he said, &quot;My wife is in a hotel room with another man.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, Logan,&quot; she whispered sadly, moving her hand to cover his reassuringly.</p><p>&quot;Don't patronize me, Francesca,&quot; he snapped, pulling his hand away from hers.</p><p>Francesca was taken aback. She wasn't used to Logan acting so coldly. &quot;I'm sorry. I wasn't...,&quot; she said.</p><p>Logan let out a deep breath, his tone softening. &quot;No, I'm sorry. It's not you... this isn't your fault. I just... I thought we were in sync, you know? I thought we were finally on the same page and that we were going to make this work.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Maybe it's not what you think, Logan. Did you see her with another guy?&quot;</p><p>He shook his head. &quot;He was in her hotel room. I heard him over the phone.&quot;</p><p>Francesca was at a lost for words. She and Rory were friends, but not the best of. She had tried to get closer to Rory, but always been rebuffed. Stephanie had always told her that Rory was hard to bond with, something that she'd come to believe over the last few months. During the course of Rory's estrangement with Logan, the animosity toward herself and Rory had increased tenfold. There was nothing she could do to try to break the ice between them. </p><p>Even though she didn't know Rory that well she couldn't believe that Rory would cheat on Logan. &quot;You could have misconstrued the situation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I didn't misconstrue anything! I know what I heard!&quot; Logan slid off his stool and made his way across the bar to the jukebox in the corner. As the looked through the titles, Francesca sidled up beside him.</p><p>&quot;Logan, I know you're my boss and I have no place in saying this, but perhaps... perhaps this isn't the relationship for you.&quot;</p><p>Logan snapped his head in her direction. &quot;Excuse me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm just saying that maybe...,&quot; Francesca stopped to take a breath. &quot;Maybe your time with Rory has passed. You're two completely different people now than you were when you first got married.&quot;</p><p>Logan scoffed. &quot;We were two completely different people when we married, Francesca. Our differences is what made us such a good match.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But maybe...,&quot; she began to object.</p><p>&quot;Enough. Don't you have a boyfriend? Shouldn't you be with Finn?&quot;</p><p>&quot;He's supposed to meet me here later.&quot;</p><p>Logan dug into his pocket for some change. &quot;If you don't mind, I'd rather be alone so if you could just... disappear that'd be great.&quot;</p><p>Francesca gave him a look, then did as he wished.</p><p>Logan pushed seventy-five cents into the jukebox, then made his way back to the bar, making it a point to sit as far away from Francesca as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A clock was ticking, he realized before his eyes opened. He squinted against the bright morning light, realizing that the ticking was coming from his watch. He lifted his head, wiping the drool from the corner of his mouth. He groaned against the bright intrusion. His head ached. He felt as if a thousand elephants were running through his head.</p><p>Just WHAT had he drank? And how much? Oy.</p><p>He took in his surrounds, realizing that he was lying on the floor in the kitchen.</p><p>He sat up, encountering pots and pans as he did so. </p><p>He leaned against the cabinets as he tried to figure out how he'd fallen asleep on the kitchen floor when Finn walked in, wearing his bathrobe. &quot;Mornin' Logan,&quot; Finn greeted him, yawning as he made his way to the coffee pot. &quot;What, no coffee?&quot; he asked, turning annoyed eyes on Logan.</p><p>&quot;Finn... why are you wearing my bathrobe?&quot;</p><p>Finn shrugged. &quot;I can't find my clothes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What happened to your clothes?&quot; Logan asked, struggling not to vomit all over the kitchen floor. It was getting hard with every intake of his breath.</p><p>&quot;Don't know, mate,&quot; Finn said as he began rummaging through cabinets. &quot;I had them on last night and by the time we got back here... I don't know what happened to them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Finn?&quot;</p><p>Finn spun around to see two women standing on the stairs, one wearing his shirt. &quot;Huh. So that's where it went,&quot; Finn said to himself, scratching his head. &quot;I found my shirt,&quot; he muttered to Logan who stood up, using the cabinets for leverage.</p><p>Logan moved closer to Finn. &quot;Who are they?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hell if I know. They did occupy your bed last night, though.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tell me I wasn't in it,&quot; Logan said, horrified.</p><p>Finn chuckled. &quot;No mate. Neither of us were. I slept on the floor in your bathroom. Head in the toilet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And yet you're chipper?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I got used to sleeping with my head in the toilet in college.&quot;</p><p>Logan nodded his head slowly. &quot;So who are your friends?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mandy and... Sandy... I think. I can't remember.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What happened with Francesca?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She was being a pissy polly. So she left.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think I may have pissed her off.&quot;</p><p>&quot;May have?&quot; Finn shook his head. &quot;No, you did.&quot;</p><p>Logan had no sarcastic remark for Finn. He pushed away from the cabinets, saying, &quot;I'm going take a shower.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good thing. You reek.&quot;</p><p>Logan smiled at the two girls as he passed them on his way upstairs. As he reached the landing at the top he heard Finn ask, &quot;What are you still doing here? Did we invite you to move in? I think not. The doors that away. Good day,&quot; Finn told them before he made his way out into the backyard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They stood in the kitchen conversing over coffee. &quot;You know, it's possible you misunderstood the situation,&quot; Finn told Logan as they resumed their conversation from the night before, this time sober.</p><p>&quot;I wish everyone would stop telling me that I misunderstood the situation. How could I possibly misunderstand that situation? He was in her bathroom. He was naked.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You do not know if he was naked.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well... he sounded naked.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Never mind,&quot; Logan said with a sigh.</p><p>&quot;You really need to get out of this house. You're delirious.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am not delirious.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, you're right. You're not. You're depressed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not dep...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes you are,&quot; Finn interrupted. &quot;You miss your wife. Stop being a schmuck and go tell her what you want.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can't do that. I can't...&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can't? No. You won't. If you want to save your marriage, Logan, you'll stop letting Rory call the shots.&quot;</p><p>Logan shook his head. &quot;I'm not letting her...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes you are.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Would you stop interrupting and let me get a word in?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; Finn said defiantly. &quot;You know, Colin and I have always wanted what you had with Rory. You had it and you just let it go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I didn't let it go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You just as well because you're damn sure not fighting to get it back. So what if she had a guy in her hotel? It doesn't mean anything. Just like you groping the waitresses at the bar didn't mean anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course it means something. It means that if Rory ever finds out this marriage is OVER.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How so?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She's already under the impression I had an affair with Francesca.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And how did she come to that conclusion?&quot;</p><p>Logan shrugged. &quot;How the hell am I supposed to know how the inner workings of Rory's mind works? I still haven't figured out why the hell she took all the furniture!&quot;</p><p>Finn was silent for a few moments, contemplating. Finally he asked, &quot;So did you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Did I, what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Did you have an affair with Francesca?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How can you even ask me that ridiculous question?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What makes it so ridiculous? Rory obviously had some reason as to wonder if you did so I'm asking you if you did.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks for the vote of confidence, Finn. You're some friend, and no, I didn't have an affair with Francesca. As if that changes anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It changes a hell of a lot. It would make you a hypocrite, Logan.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I didn't sleep with her, Finn!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're sure?&quot;</p><p>&quot;God, yes! I wouldn't do that to Rory... to my marriage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Finn said, dropping the subject. &quot;But would you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Would I, what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Would you sleep with Francesca?&quot;</p><p>Logan sent Finn a hard look, forcing Finn to say, &quot;Okay, okay. I'll be quiet now.&quot; As they stood silent in the kitchen, Finn said, &quot;You know, you should really get some living room furniture.&quot; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was Wednesday by the time Rory summoned the courage to visit Logan. Stephen had gone back to Hawaii and she had promised him before he left that she was going to go back home. </p><p>She stepped off the elevator, her heart beating rapidly in her chest as she made her way down the long corridor toward his office. His secretary greeted her with a surprised smile. &quot;Mrs. Huntzberger... hi,&quot; Megan greeted her awkwardly.</p><p>&quot;Hi Megan,&quot; she said in return, casting a glance toward Logan's office. &quot;Is, uh, is he busy?&quot;</p><p>Megan shook her head. &quot;No, he isn't. Just go on in.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rory knocked softly but didn't wait for him to answer her before she pushed open the door. He was sitting at his desk reading the newspaper, lifting his head to look at her as she entered his office.</p><p>&quot;Can't say that this isn't a surprise,&quot; he said, dropping his eyes back to the newspaper.</p><p>&quot;I wanted to talk to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You could've called.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is the type of thing you do in person.&quot;</p><p>Logan sensed that this was serious. He laid down his paper, then sat back in his chair, affording her his undivided attention. &quot;I'm listening.&quot;</p><p>Rory sighed, nodding her head as she dropped her purse into a chair. &quot;The other night... when I couldn't... when I didn't go to Friday night dinner. I was with a friend.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; he said, his mind twisting her coming words in a million different directions.</p><p>&quot;You remember my friend, Stephen, right?&quot;</p><p><em>Stephen. Stephen.</em> No, the name didn't ring a bell. &quot;No, I don't remember, Rory. Am I supposed to?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We worked together at the Yale Daily senior year and then at the Centennial after graduation?&quot;</p><p>It clicked after a few moments. During her senior year he'd had many run-ins with Stephen. He'd exploded into the newspaper room countless times only to find them hard at work. He hadn't been supportive of her friendship with Stephen and had reached a stand still with her, begging her to not inform him of anything in relation to Stephen. </p><p>So she hadn't. &quot;Stephen,&quot; he repeated after a moments, &quot;... was the guy that was in your hotel room?&quot;</p><p>Rory stared at him blankly, realization dawning on her after a few moments. &quot;What? No. It's not like that between me and Stephen,&quot; she assured him.</p><p>Logan pushed back his chair. &quot;Sure it isn't,&quot; Logan said sarcastically as he made his way across the room to the coffee cart in the corner.</p><p>&quot;Logan,&quot; she said in a soft voice, causing him to turn around to look at her. &quot;Stephen and I are just friends. We were just friends in college and we are just friends now. Last night we...,&quot; she began to explain.</p><p>&quot;I kissed Francesca.&quot; He blurted out the lie before she could confess whatever it was that she had come to confess.</p><p>She was silent for a few moments as his words sunk in. &quot;You kissed her?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I guess we're even now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Even?&quot; She stood up abruptly. &quot;I didn't come here to confess to some one night thing with Stephen! I came to tell you that I'm tired of running scared. I'm ready to put my all into this and come home!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rory, I...,&quot; he began to say. </p><p>By then it was too late. </p><p>She hurriedly grabbed her purse and bounded out the office leaving a speechless Logan staring after her."

<b>Chapter Nine: On the Rocks</b>

They'd decided that casual was the best option for their first date. When Stephanie called, inviting them to an afternoon barbecue, they had quickly accepted the invitation.</p><p>They'd been getting along lately, save for having the screaming match over the phone after Logan had gotten the latest credit card bill and realized that she'd maxed out his credit card. </p><p><em>On purpose</em>. </p><p>Hey, she was angry. What'd he expect her to do? Stay home and knit? </p><p>They got along better when they were in a group. That wasn't to say that they didn't get along when they were in each other's company. Lately they had been. They'd met twice for lunch in the past week since their brunch at the Yacht club. </p><p>Things were progressing smoothly. And without argument.</p><p>As she drove into Colin and Stephanie's neighborhood, she dwelled on the fact that she and Logan's anniversary was only a few weeks away. She had spent the last several weeks trying not to think about it, hoping that if she didn't, the day would pass just like any other day. </p><p>She wasn't that lucky.</p><p>She was holding out hope that he actually remembered this year.</p><p>But she wasn't expecting any miracles.</p><p>Logan was already there, she realized spotting his Porsche in the driveway as she drove up at Colin and Stephanie's. She parked her car beside the curb, behind a sleek, black Lexus. She wondered who the Lexus belonged to as she made her way up the sidewalk, hearing the ruckus from the backyard. The men were already in rare form. It was going to be an interesting afternoon, she thought as she rang the doorbell.</p><p>Rory smiled warmly when Colin opened the door, dripping wet. &quot;What happened to you?&quot; she asked as he ushered her inside.</p><p>&quot;Finn thought it would be funny to throw play the fun game of 'Wet the Cook' and I just so happened to be the cook so he got an added laugh by throwing me into the pool.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Get upstairs! You're dripping water all over the floor!&quot; Stephanie yelled from behind them.</p><p>&quot;I'm going! I'm going,&quot; he muttered under his breath, once again smirking at Rory as he said, &quot;I'll see you outside in a few minutes.&quot;</p><p>Colin began ascending the stairs as Stephanie took her arm, pulling her into the kitchen. &quot;So, how are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And Logan?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Logan's, uh, good, I guess. Why don't you ask him yourself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because I'm asking you.&quot;</p><p>Rory plopped her purse down on the kitchen counter. &quot;Are you plying me for information?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Stephanie said with a strangled breath. &quot;Logan's a sourpuss. He won't tell me anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then, I'm not going to either,&quot; Rory said, turning on her heel. She headed toward the back door with Stephanie quick at her heels.</p><p>&quot;That's not fair!&quot; Stephanie said, bumping into Rory as she stopped in the doorway. &quot;What are you looking at?&quot; she asked, following Rory's line of vision. </p><p>&quot;I didn't know that Francesca was going to be here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Finn invited her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hell if I know. Why does Finn do the things that he does?&quot; Rory stepped out into the backyard as Stephanie asked, &quot;Hey, you okay?&quot;</p><p>Rory stopped, turning around to face Stephanie. &quot;Yeah, I'm fine. I was just surprised to see her here is all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know you better than that. What's going on? I thought that you and her were okay? After that whole birthday party you helped orchestrate for her back in March, I just figured that the two of you had mended fences.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We did, I just...,&quot; Rory turned around so that her back was facing Logan who was engaged in a conversation with Francesca. </p><p>&quot;What?&quot; Stephanie asked when Rory didn't finish her sentence.</p><p>&quot;I accused Logan of sleeping with her,&quot; Rory spat out quickly.</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry, you did what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know what I was thinking! We were at dinner and he was... he was being an ass, so I <em>insinuated</em> that his business dinners with Francesca were far from platonic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, Rory...,&quot; Stephanie sighed. </p><p>&quot;I know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Francesca has no interest in Logan.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How do you know that? I don't even know that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She's dating Finn,&quot; Stephanie blurted out.</p><p>Confusion washed across Rory's face. &quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;They've been seeing one another for the last few months, but they kept it under wraps because Francesca works for Logan and they didn't want to complicate Francesca and Logan's working relationship in case things didn't pan out but since they're getting serious, they told him. And Finn told us and then he just showed up here with her today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wow,&quot; Rory said, turning around to look at Finn. &quot;Finn hasn't been serious about a girl since Rosemary.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It seriously broke his heart when he found out that she was seeing Robert behind his back...,&quot; Stephanie added, then, said, &quot;But you're changing the subject!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can't go over there and pretend to be nice, Stephanie.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure you can,&quot; Stephanie said, pushing Rory in the direction of Logan and Francesca. &quot;Just remember. She's sleeping with Finn and not your husband,&quot; Stephanie whispered.</p><p>&quot;Thanks. That helps a lot.&quot;</p><p>Logan and Francesca were laughing when they joined them. Logan's face lit up at the sight of Rory, as did hers. &quot;I was wondering when you were going to get here,&quot; he said as Finn emerged from the pool bellowing, &quot;Frannie, love, where did I put my drink?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is he drunk?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's Finn. When is he ever not?&quot; Logan asked, pulling her away. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. Why wouldn't I be?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I just figured what with Francesca here...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now, why would you say something like that?&quot;</p><p>Logan just shrugged. &quot;No reason I just thought...,&quot; he began.</p><p>&quot;Should I feel uncomfortable, Logan?&quot; she interrupted, her voice hinged with a haughty tone.</p><p>&quot;Rory, no. You know that...,&quot; he began to say.</p><p>She cut him off before he could finish his thought. &quot;I know. I do.&quot; She sighed. &quot;I want to forget that horrible dinner ever happened. And what we said... can we just forget that? Please?&quot; she pleaded.</p><p>He smiled at her. At least she wanted to make a valiant effort. &quot;Sure, we can do that.&quot; He began leading her in the direction of the drinks cart. &quot;We came here to have a nice afternoon with our friends. Let's try to do that, hmm?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After Finn and Francesca had made an early departure and Colin and Stephanie began arguing about the wet clothes that he'd left on the bathroom floor, Rory and Logan announced their leave before any blood was shed.</p><p>Rory linked her arm through his as he politely walked her to her car. Always the distinguished gentleman. &quot;I'm glad you came,&quot; he told her as they made their way down the sidewalk.</p><p>&quot;Me too. It's been ages since we've all hung out like this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Years,&quot; he agreed. He, Colin and Finn had been hanging out lately, but they were keeping an eye on him. Probably by Stephanie's orders. Stephanie was the anchor. Back in junior high school when he and Colin had fought over who was going to ask Casey Shelton to the prom, it was Stephanie who had gotten them talking again. When he and Rory had gone their separate ways before his graduation, she had done her damnedest to get them speaking again.</p><p>As she opened her car door, she turned to look at him. &quot;I'm sure I'll talk to you at one point during the week.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sure you will,&quot; he said with a wide smirk. &quot;Maybe we can get together for lunch sometime this week.&quot;</p><p>&quot;To talk, right?&quot;</p><p>He smiled at her in answer.</p><p>&quot;Right,&quot; she said, inwardly groaning. Talking meant disrupting the balance that they had going. Talking meant drudging up their less than perfect marriage. Talking meant telling him exactly how he made her feel and if there was one thing that she didn't want to do, it was upset Logan any further and any talking that they did would only do that.</p><p>&quot;There's only so long that we can put it off.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. I just... we're getting along. It's nice. I just don't want to screw it all up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You won't,&quot; he said, bracing her arms with his hands for reassurance. A surge of heat swept through her at the feel of his hands on her. </p><p>Logan caught the unsettled look in her eyes, causing him to drop his hands and step back. &quot;So, uh, drive safe.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Right. Umm... you, too. And I'll... bye,&quot; she said abruptly. She climbed into her car, gunned the engine and with a smile flashed at Logan, she sped away, stopping at the stop sign at the end of the block to rest her head against the steering wheel.</p><p>This reconciliation got harder everyday, she thought as she turned left and headed back for her hotel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Logan took a seat at the bar, signaling for the bartender. &quot;Whiskey on the rocks,&quot; he ordered, lifting his eyes to the television suspended from the ceiling. </p><p>He tapped his knuckles on the bar, looking around. The air was damp, holding the stench of a mixture of booze and cheap cologne. He stuck out like a sore thumb in his Armani suit, but he didn't care. He needed an escape from the real world. He didn't need to think about what his wife what doing at that particular moment. </p><p><em>Who she was doing it with.</em></p><p>He shook his head to get that train of thought out of his head. </p><p>He had called her earlier to say that he was going to be late for dinner at her grandparents house only to have her tell him that she wasn't going to be able to make it. She had other plans and had informed her grandmother of them earlier in the week. She had apologized profusely for not telling him. Things had been hectic at work. She quickly explained that a friend needed her help. Then he'd heard it.</p><p>The man's voice. </p><em>&quot;Rory, I need a towel and there's none left in the bathroom.&quot;</em><em> <p>&quot;I forgot to get more from housekeeping,&quot; she laughed. &quot;Let me go and do that.&quot; She had quickly turned her attention back to him, not bothering to explain why there was a man in her bathroom. &quot;Logan, I have to go. We'll catch up next week sometime.&quot;</p></em><p>That was the first conversation that they'd had since their awkward moment Sunday afternoon. </p><p>The pull was electric, he thought. He knew she felt it, too. He knew that she did. That was probably her reason for leaving so abruptly. She wasn't ready for things to be that easy between them yet. She would barely spend five minutes alone in his presence. They always met in a restaurant or somewhere where they were surrounded by people.</p><p>She was scared to be alone with him. <em>Really</em> alone with him and he wanted to know why. </p><p>The bartender set his drink before him. Logan thanked him as he stared down into the colored liquid. </p><p>She was close yet still so very far away. </p><p>He needed... he didn't know what he needed. He needed <em>her</em> that much was certain, but she'd erected a wall around herself to keep him at arm's length. </p><p>That's what had brought him here. He needed time away from the house, away from his office to think.</p><p>However, the only thing he kept thinking about was his wife in a hotel with another man.</p><p>It made his head hurt. </p><p>He couldn't afford jealousy. Not after the downfall of their marriage. He couldn't be that kind of guy. He'd been that guy so very long ago and the repercussions had been dastardly.</p><p>He felt someone fall onto the stool beside him. He curbed the impulse to turn to see who it was as he knocked back his drink, quickly ordering another to follow.</p><p>&quot;Hey stranger,&quot; came the voice from the chair beside him.</p><p>He turned his head, his eyes landing on the woman beside him.</p><p>He smiled. She wasn't the woman that he wanted to spend his night with, but she'd do. &quot;Can I buy you a drink?&quot;</p></span></div>"

<b>Chapter Eight: Thanks to the Meddlesome Emily Gilmore</b>

<p>Emily Gilmore stepped off the elevator with established poise, setting her eyes on the bumbling secretary as she made her way down the long corridor. &quot;Excuse me?&quot; </p><p>The young woman looked up, smacking annoyingly on the bubblegum in her mouth. &quot;Yes. May I help you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm here to talk to Logan Huntzberger.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mister Huntzberger asked not to be disturbed this morning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't care what Mister Huntzberger asked of you. I demand to speak with him,&quot; Emily demanded, already annoyed with the little secretarial twit.</p><p>&quot;One moment,&quot; the secretary said, picking up her phone. &quot;Mister Huntzberger, there's a woman here demanding to speak with you.&quot;</p><p>Emily snatched the phone out of the young girl's hand. &quot;Logan, it's Emily. I'm sorry to have dropped in like this, but I need to speak with you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Emily, uh, hi. Sure. Have Megan point the way.&quot;</p><p>Emily handed Megan back the phone. &quot;Which way is his office, dear?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Emily this is such a pleasant surprise,&quot; Logan greeted her at the doorway with a kiss to her cheek.</p><p>&quot;I was in the area,&quot; she lied as he led her to the chair in front of his desk. She'd come here on a mission and she was not leaving until she had completed that mission. Rory and Logan may be willing to throw their marriage away, but she wasn't just going to stand around and let them. The two of them had fought too hard, experienced too much together to call it quits now.</p><p>&quot;Can I get you something to drink? Water? Soda? Coffee?&quot; Logan asked as he moved back around his desk.</p><p>&quot;No, no. I'm fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay, well, what can I do for you, then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I came to talk about Rory.&quot;</p><p>Logan sighed as he fell into his chair. &quot;I was afraid you'd say that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This separation is absurd, Logan. You have to do something.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I've tried.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, try harder.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's not that simple.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Make it that simple. I will not stand by and watch the two of you throw away this marriage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Emily you can't even call what Rory and I have a marriage. You can barely call it a relationship.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But you love each other.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sometimes love ain't enough.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, it should be. I expect to see you at Friday Night Dinner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, I don't know...,&quot; Logan began to object. He had promised to give Rory her space and to show up at Friday Night Dinner... he didn't want to put her in that predicament.</p><p>&quot;You're a part of this family and you're going to start partaking in family tradition, including Friday Night Dinner. Rory knows that you're coming and is perfectly fine with it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She is?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Would I lie?&quot;</p><p>He gave her a skeptical look, but managed to muster up, &quot;No, I guess you wouldn't.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dinner is at seven. Be there at six.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have to be going. I'll see you Friday.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;So how's work?&quot; Richard asked as he and Rory joined Lorelai and Christopher in the living room for drinks.</p><p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Rory said settling down onto the couch. &quot;Actually, I was offered a job working in Boston.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Boston?&quot; Emily and Richard asked in unison.</p><p>&quot;Doing what?&quot; Richard asked.</p><p>&quot;Heading up an arts and leisure magazine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you going to take it?&quot;</p><p>Rory shook her head. &quot;I doubt it. As much as I would love to relocate after the divorce I just don't think Boston is the place for me. Plus, I love the Centennial. I'd be crazy to give up my job as editor now.&quot;</p><p>Rory watched the face her grandmother made. Emily was unhappy with her separation from Logan, a feeling that she had expressed at length over the past few weeks during her numerous phone calls and visits. </p><p>When the doorbell rang, Rory exchanged a look with her parents, then with her grandfather. &quot;Is someone else joining us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have no idea. No telling who your grandmother invited.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey everyone. Sorry I'm late,&quot; Logan said, walking into the living room, stopping when the maid appeared to take his coat. &quot;Traffic was horrible,&quot; he said taking in all of the surprised faces, especially Rory's.</p><p>Rory sat still for a few moments, surprised and confused as to why he was there, but then it sunk in: her grandmother. After a few moments, she said as she stood up, &quot;Well, you're here now. A drink?&quot;</p><p>He nodded his head. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he said, following her to the drink cart.</p><p>He watched as she poured him a club soda. &quot;Here you go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; he said, taking the glass from her. They moved to the sofa, sitting down only to have the maid announce that dinner was ready a few moments later.</p><p>Logan made his way into the dining room as Lorelai pulled Rory aside. &quot;Did you know that he was going to be here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. And we both know who was behind it.&quot; They glared at Emily as she walked in from the kitchen.</p><p>&quot;Stop loitering in the hall, you two,&quot; Emily snapped. &quot;You don't want your dinner to get cold.&quot;</p><p>Lorelai and Rory exchanged a look, then moved into the dining room. </p><p>Rory settled beside Logan as he placed his napkin on his lap, muttering an, &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; under his breath as the maid entered the room with their first course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;You don't have to apologize,&quot; Rory said later that evening after they had stepped outside, ready to leave.</p><p>&quot;I told you I was going to give you space and then... I thought you knew I was coming.&quot; </p><p>Rory shook her head. &quot;No. I didn't,&quot; she said, pulling her coat tighter around her body. &quot;But that's not to say that I didn't enjoy having you here tonight.&quot;</p><p>Logan stared at her dubiously as she began walking to her car, &quot;I've been expecting her to meddle. It's what she does. She can't just leave well enough alone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know this made you uncomfortable. I won't come back unless you want me to.&quot;</p><p>Rory dropped her eyes. &quot;It's not that I don't want you around, Logan, it's not that at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What is it, then?&quot;</p><p>Rory sighed. &quot;This is all... it's hard.&quot; </p><p>&quot;You're making it harder on yourself by fighting it.&quot; Logan leaned against the hood of his car as he said, &quot;You act like you hate me, but we sat beside each other tonight like it was the most normal thing in the world. We didn't argue. We didn't throw barbs at one another. It was like old times, Rory.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't read too much into it. It was just dinner,&quot; she bit back, sarcastically. Why did she do that? They could be having a normal conversation and she always had to act like a bitter bitch. </p><p>Logan ignored her sarcasm. He had gotten used to her decisive attitude the last few weeks. Sooner or later she'd soften. &quot;A dinner that neither of us walked out of,&quot; he pointed out.</p><p>Logan did have a point. They both sat back and enjoyed dinner. They had a few glasses of wine with dinner. They talked amiably with her parents and her grandparents. It was nice. It reminded her of the times that they'd attended the weekly dinners together before they were married. &quot;What are you getting at?&quot; she finally asked.</p><p>&quot;Maybe we should try it again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? Dinner?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Or something like it. Maybe lunch instead.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Brunch?&quot; she found herself offering.</p><p>&quot;That could work.&quot; Logan pushed himself away from his car, stopping in front of Rory. He bent his knees to make her look at him. &quot;And we'll actually talk this time?&quot;</p><p>She nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How's Sunday?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah... Sunday sounds fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;About eleven? At the Yacht Club?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll meet you there.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the yacht club Sunday morning, Rory had arrived first, taking advantage of her early arrival to drink a mimosa and delve into the morning paper. She was halfway through the world news when she heard Logan's voice.</p><p>She glanced up from the paper, spotting Logan near the doorway, chatting with the patrons and some of the other guests. She recognized one particular person as Matt McDermott, a close friend of Shira and Mitchum's. She watched Logan for a few moments, smiling as she watched the polished charm pull through, even to people that he didn't like. </p><p>And Logan didn't like Matt McDermott, something that he had told her every time he and Matt crossed paths. Matt was his father's people. Not his, he had told her once.</p><p>When he glanced in her direction and caught her watching him, he smiled. She couldn't help but return his smile, then quickly averted her eyes back to the paper while he continued his conversation.</p><p>He joined her nearly fifteen minutes later, sliding into the chair across from her with a casual, &quot;Hey.&quot; </p><p>&quot;You pulled yourself away from your fans long enough to come and see me? I'm honored,&quot; she teased as she refolded her newspaper, putting it aside.</p><p>&quot;I should know better than to come here,&quot; he said taking a sip from the glass of water that stood on the table in front of him.</p><p>&quot;We can leave.&quot;</p><p>Logan shook his head, relaxing in his chair. &quot;No, we're here now. We're not leaving because of &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Them? You mean the pod people,&quot; she teased.</p><p>&quot;They just as soon be pod people. They're Mitchum Huntzberger people. They're pretty much the same thing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Logan, you shouldn't let them get to you. You shouldn't let your father get to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know, Rory, but it's easier said than done, you know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot;</p><p>Logan let out a deep breath. &quot;I don't want to talk about my parents or their people. We came to talk about us, didn't we?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We did.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let's talk about that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay. But do you mind if we order first? I'm starving.&quot;</p><p>Logan chuckled softly as he opened his menu. &quot;Let's order, then.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An hour later, Rory and Logan sat in front of their cleaned off plates, laughing and reminiscing about their relationship. &quot;Remember when we all went to Colorado and Finn fell off the lift and his pants fell off?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's something I would rather not remember. Stephanie and I had seen way too much of Finn on that particular day. I wish I could get that image out of my head.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey now! I would rather not think of you thinking of Finn in any capacity, much less a half-naked one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Finn's a decent looking guy, Logan. I mean, I wouldn't be a woman if I didn't think he wasn't the least bit attractive.&quot;</p><p>Logan paused as he was about to take a sip of his coffee. &quot;Tell me that you're kidding. You aren't honestly attracted to Finn, are you?&quot;</p><p>Rory shrugged, nonchalantly. &quot;Maybe.&quot;</p><p>He caught her teasing tone. &quot;Not funny.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just a little.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you see me laughing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. And it makes this awfully hard to revel in.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Would you rather I act jealous and threaten to beat Finn to a bloody pulp?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, actually, I would.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I will if it would prove to you that I love you and would be willing to do anything to make you see that.&quot;</p><p>The playfulness was gone. It was serious time now. &quot;Logan...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Rory we've been tiptoeing around this all morning. We came here to talk. Let's talk.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fine,&quot; she said, relenting.</p><p>&quot;I know that there's no way to undo the last three years. The damage is done.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I agree.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But there is a way to make it better.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't see how, Logan. I don't know you. You don't know me. We haven't spent time alone in... it's been THAT long. Work has become our spouses. How do we try to maintain a relationship, a marriage, despite all this? I just don't see how we can do that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I've been thinking about this a lot. The only rational solution I can come up with is for us to start over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Start over?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Clean slate. Pretend that we don't know each, which, honestly, we no longer do.&quot;</p><p>He had put a lot of thought into this, she conceded and she had to admit, that she was intrigued by whatever it was that he had planned. &quot;What are you proposing, exactly?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do people normally do when they try to get to know one another?&quot;</p><p>Rory shrugged, not catching his drift. &quot;I don't know... date?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Precisely.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You want to date me?&quot; she asked, incredulous. Her husband wanted to date her. God, it sounded more insane in her head. &quot;Logan, that's ridiculous.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is it?&quot; He reached across the table to take her hand. &quot;The way I see it this is our best option. We're separated anyway, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right,&quot; she agreed with a nod of her head.</p><p>&quot;It'll be like the old days. We'll go out, have dinner, maybe take in a movie and you'll reject me like you used to. It'll be great.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, sorry, but if anyone did rejecting it was you,&quot; she reminded him.</p><p>&quot;Good point. That'll be the only X factor here. You won't have to worry about being rejecting. I, on the other hand, will be doing all the worrying for the both of us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're serious about this?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very. I want to make this work. I want to make it better. And if this is how low I have to stoop to get your trust back, then, well, I'm going to do whatever it takes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Logan, I don't know, this is too much for me to take in. I mean... &lt;i&gt;dating&lt;/i&gt;? We already did that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Poorly, if I must say.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Granted, we weren't the best at it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We'll do it right this time, Rory.&quot;</p><p>Rory saw the hopeful look in his eyes. She knew that look. She had saw that look so many times. He'd had the exact same look in his eyes the night that he'd proposed. &quot;On one condition.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No casual dating.&quot;</p></span></div>"

Summary: Post-Let Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ringing Out. Logan breaks up with Rory, leaving Colin to pick her up after her fall.

<lj-cut text=""You hit me with a golf ball so I expect clemency."">

<b>Chapter Three: Blowing Off Steam</b>

""I didn't know there was a mini-golf in New Haven,"" Colin said as they left the mini-golf course. Rory was limping, no thanks to him, who had hit her with a golf club. He had a <i>really</i> bad swing. And she'd been standing in a really bad place.

""Marty and I had stumbled across it one night. We came here pretty often to blow off some steam.""

""So were you visualizing that Logan was the ball?""

She snickered. ""Whatever do you mean?""

He laughed. ""Okay, so I'm really sorry about your knee.""

""As you've said a thousand times. It's okay. I just thought that you country boy types are bred for golf.""

Colin shook his head. ""We're not. My father was never a big golfer. He would go to the country club to sway the ladies. Usually the other members' wives.""

""Your dad sounds like a prime catch.""

""He is,"" he scoffed. ""He's already traded in Heidi so no telling who he'll have at the house when I go for Christmas.""

""Oh, Colin, I'm so sorry.""

He shrugged. ""As long as I'm not there to see it, I can care less what he does."" As they arrived at the car, Colin said, ""Hand me your keys.""

""Why?""

""Because your knee is hurt. I'll drive. At least back to Yale.""

She handed Colin her keys, smiling, as she said, ""Thank you."" He then helped her around the car and into the passenger side seat. 



After he and Rory had said their goodbyes, complete with an awkward hug and an even more awkward look afterwards, Colin had headed back to his apartment, not prepared to find Finn and Logan roused in a game of Playstation.

""Where have you been?"" Finn asked, not taking his eyes off the game as he closed the door behind himself.

""Out,"" he said simply.

""We're meeting the Thompson twins later,"" Logan said, turning around to glance at him. ""You wanna come?""

Colin shook his head. ""No. I have to start studying for finals. I'm actually gonna do that now,"" he said, making his way to his room.

Finn and Logan began to object. ""Hang out with us,"" Finn declared. ""We haven't seen you for the last few days.

""Yeah, where have you been?"" Logan asked.

""Around,"" Colin said vaguely. ""As much as I would love to stay out here and play another rousing game of Fight Night with the two of you, I can't."" Colin retired to his room, closing and locking the door behind himself. He leaned against the door for a few moments listening to Finn and Logan exchange theories as to what his problem was.

He crossed to his desk, and as he began sifting through the books on his desk, his cell phone rang. He dug it out of his pocket, answering, ""Hello?"" Anyone was a welcome distraction from studying.

""So, I was thinking...""

He smiled, recognizing her voice. ""About what?""

""That you owe me. You hit me with a golf ball so I expect clemency.""

""Do you?""

""I do. The whole nine yards and all.""

""The whole nine yards, huh?""

""Yeah. It's only fair."" 

""I do believe that nine yards could be arranged.""



Colin had made reservations at a restaurant in Hartford that came highly recommended by a girl in his English class. He wanted to impress Rory, but he didn't want to throw his money in her face like Logan had done during their time together. 

As he stepped out of his class, he grabbed his phone, dialing her number. He frowned when he got a busy signal. When he broke through the double doors and got outside, he headed in the direction of the coffee cart, having been denied his caffeine fix all day. It was as he gave his order that his phone began ringing.

""You always call when I'm in the shower. Do you have a complex?""

""Huh?""

""Do you sit and class and wonder what I'm doing and it just hits you, well, maybe Rory's in the shower? Let me call and see?""

""No,"" he says, exchanging his money for his coffee. He finds her neurosis endearing. She sighs. ""I was thinking about you, though. Hence the call.""

""That's nice to hear.""

""I was sitting in class and the professor was lecturing about women in third world countries and I was thinking about you. Naked. In the shower.""

She scoffed. ""Now, you're just mocking me!""

Colin couldn't help but laugh. He loved rifling her feathers. ""I would do no such thing.""

""Did you call me with an intent in mind?""

""Just to remind you that I'll be picking you up Friday at six-thirty.""

""Okay."" Rory waited for him to say something else. Anything else. But Colin wasn't big on the small talk. She usually had to draw the words out of his mouth. Maybe he didn't trust her. Maybe he couldn't trust her because of her long standing relationship with his best friend. But that was ridiculous. Colin wasn't that kind of person. Was he? After a few moments, she said, ""Colin, I hate to cut this conversation short, but I have to get dressed.""

""Right.""

""I have to be at the paper in an hour.""

""Yeah, sure.""

""But I'll see you Friday?""

""Friday it is,"" he agreed. 

""Bye Colin.""

""Bye Rory,"" Colin said as he began his trek toward the parking lot. 



Rory couldn't concentrate. The more she typed away at her computer trying to type out her article, the more her mind went back to Colin. She'd been thinking about him a lot lately. She'd be doing something as simple as watching television and a commercial would come on or a song would play that would remind her of him. 

""Oh, you have it bad, Gilmore,"" she muttered to herself.

""Talking to your computer?""

Rory turned in her chair, surprised to see Logan standing behind her. She remained silent.

""Still mad at me, huh?""

Rory returned to her computer. ""I have nothing to be mad at you for. You're a blip on my radar, Logan.""

""Of course. I'm just here running errands for my father. I saw you and thought I'd say hi.""

She looked at him. ""Next time do me a favor and curb that impulse."" Rory stood up abruptly and began walking away from him.

""Would you wait?"" he asked, falling into step behind her.

""No, I will not."" She spun around to face him. ""We,"" she said, with a motion of her hand between them, ""are no longer dating. We aren't even friends. So I don't have to bend at your will. I don't have to talk to you. I don't have to be nice to you. And I certainly do not have to stop just because you say so."" Logan looked around, realizing that they had conjured an audience.

""I'm sorry that I...,"" he began to apologize.

She held up her hand. ""Do not even finish that sentence,"" she warned. ""I don't need your apologies or your lame ass excuses. I'm <i>done</i>."" She turned to face the secretary. ""Peggy, I'm leaving early.""

""Sure thing, sweetie.""

Rory turned on her heel and headed for the elevator. She pressed a button, then stepped inside, glaring at Logan as the doors closed in front of her. She pressed the button to go down, pulling her phone from her belt clip. As she dialed the number, her hand shook. She smiled as the line clicked. 

""I need to see you..."""

Summary: Future-fic. When things begin to slip away, what to you do? You return to the beginning and start anew.

<lj-cut text=""She always wanted to believe the best in him, but sometimes he made it very difficult."">

Christopher was sitting in the living room, his computer in his lap, typing furiously at the keyboard, his wife constantly throwing a pillow at his head. ""Finished yet?"" she asked for the umpteenth time that evening.

""If you would stop attacking me with the pillow I would finish a lot sooner and then you'd get the attention that you've been demanding for the last two hours.""

""You just came home from a business trip. You did business on the trip and now you came home to do more business? You should've stayed on your trip and then come home after all your business was concluded.""

""This work comes after the business trip concludes, which I've told you half a dozen times already.""

""Yes, but when you talk shop with me I don't listen.""

""Obviously.""

Lorelai pushed herself to her feet as she flicked off the television. ""I want coffee. Do you want coffee?"" 

""At eight o'clock at night? I think not. I'll be up all night if I drink any,"" he yelled after her as she made her way into the kitchen.

""Maybe that was the point.""

""Why, are you planning on taking advantage of me?""

""Hmm, well, yes, that was the plan.""

""Stop talking so that I can finish my work, then.""

""Okay.""

Lorelai was finishing setting up the coffee pot when she heard the front door open and close, followed by Rory beckoning, ""Mom?""

""Rory?"" Lorelai walked into the foyer where her daughter was standing, a pair of strappy shoes in one hand, a beaded purse in the other. Her mascara streaked face was a sign that she'd been crying. ""Honey, what's wrong?""

Lorelai barely got the words out before Rory began crying again, seeking her mother's arms for comfort. From his perch on the sofa, Christopher closed his laptop, setting it on the coffee table. ""I'll make up the spare room,"" he told Lorelai before he disappeared upstairs.

Rory pushed away from Lorelai. ""I'm sorry to have just shown up. I just didn't want to go back to my hotel room.""

""It's okay. You know you can stay here as long as you want. Your Dad and I would love it if you stayed here. Gigi would, too,"" Lorelai said, leading Rory upstairs.

""I know, and thanks. I may take you up on that.""

""You gonna tell Mommy what happened?""

Rory nodded her head. ""Just not tonight. I have a really bad headache and I just... I just want to go to sleep if that's okay.""

""It's fine, sweetie. Dad's making up the bed for you. Go meet him and you can climb right into bed.""

""Thanks for understanding, Mom.""

Rory left her mother standing on the stairs to head in the direction of the spare room, stopping first to peek into GiGi's room before moving onto her room for the night. Her dad was turning down the sheets when she walked in. ""Hey,"" she said, falling into the large ottoman in the corner.

""Hey kiddo. Rough night?""

""You could say that.""

""A bender gone horribly awry?"" Christopher tried to joke. He wasn't trying to make light of the situation. If anything he wanted to see his daughter smiling again, something she hadn't done since after she had married Logan.

When she began sobbing again, Christopher quickly crossed the room to her, gathering her in his arms. ""Oh, Rory, honey, it's going to be okay. You're going to be okay. I can't say the same for Logan, however."" He smiled, kissing her forehead when she began laughing.

""Thanks Daddy,"" she said kissing his cheek. After a few moments of silence, she asked, ""How'd you know it was about Logan?""

Christopher hugged her closer. ""I just figured."" Patting her leg, he said, ""Come on. Let's get you into bed."" Christopher helped her over toward the bed, tucking her in like he never got to do when she was younger. ""Night honey,"" he told his daughter, kissing her forehead before he made his way toward the door.

""Hey Dad?""

""Yeah?""

""Thanks."" Chris turned off the light as he watched her roll over to get some much needed sleep. 

He wasn't surprised to find Lorelai waiting outside the door when he exited the room. ""How is she?""

""Tired, I would guess,"" he said, leading her into their bedroom. Closing the door, he began to strip for bed. ""What's going on, Lorelai? I feel so out of the loop with all of this. You told me that she had left, but her showing up here crying and upset is something that I hadn't anticipated.""

""She's taking this really hard, Chris. She doesn't want to give up, but thinks she'll be spinning her wheels for nothing if she goes back to him.""

""She tell you that?""

Lorelai shook her head. ""Colin did. Rory seldom tells me what's going on. I'm surprised she told me that she was leaving.""

They climbed into bed, Lorelai snuggling in close to Chris. ""Then, what do we do? Just standby and watch her continue to be miserable.""

""Yeah.""

""I was afraid you'd say that,"" Christopher said sarcastically. ""I don't like this, you know.""

""I know.""

Christopher looked at Lorelai, frowning. ""I guess we have to go to sleep, huh?""

Lorelai smacked him with the pillow. ""Your side of the bed, mister,"" she instructed, smiling to herself as he groaned, rolling over onto his side. 

 

 

Rory heard the door open way before she was pushed awake. ""Rory,"" came the whisper. ""Rory,"" it came again. ""RORY!!!""

Rory sat upright, not used to being awakened by a rowdy seven year old. ""Gigi... hi. What time is it?""

Gigi just shrugged her shoulders. ""I dunno.""

""Where's Dad?""

""I dunno.""

""Where's my mom?""

""I dunno.""

""Do you know anything?""

Gigi was silent a moment as she pondered Rory's question, but only shrugged. ""Why are you wearing a dress?""

Rory looked down, noticing that she was still wearing her dress from her dinner with Logan. ""I... uh... I don't have any pajamas.""

""Where's Logan?""

""There you are!"" Christopher barged into the room, setting his sights on Gigi. ""Come downstairs and leave your sister alone.""

""No, Dad, it's fine,"" Rory insisted.

""Really?""

""Really.""

""I was asking Rory where Logan was. Did he sleep here too?""

Rory exchanged a look with her father, thankful that he came to her rescue. ""No, honey. He had to work.""

""But he's always working,"" Gigi whined as Chris lifted her off the bed, setting her on her feet beside the bed.

""I know,"" Chris said as he began leading Gigi out of the room.

Rory took a moment to get herself together, then made her way out of the room and downstairs. Her parents were gathered at the table with Gigi, her mother pouring Gigi a bowl of cereal. 

""You're awake,"" Lorelai said as she walked into the kitchen. ""How'd you sleep?""

""Horrible,"" Rory said, pulling up a chair at the table.

""Yeah, that bed isn't comfortable at all,"" her dad added.

""You sleep in it often?""

""Your mom snores.""

""I do not!""

""Yes, you do,"" Rory agreed, laughing along with her dad.

Lorelai settled at the table beside Gigi. ""Traitor!"" she said, glaring at Rory. 

Chris stood up from the table abruptly. ""Hurry up, Gee. Finish your breakfast so that we can go.""

""Go?"" Rory asked. ""Where are you going?""

""I'm taking Gigi up to see Sherry in Boston. She has a few days off of school so Sherry wanted to spend some time with her.""

Rory and Lorelai took turns hugging Gigi before Chris carted her off towards the door, wheeling her bag after him.

After Chris and Gigi were gone, Lorelai focused on her daughter. ""Now, about last night...,"" Lorelai began.

""Mom, seriously, we're doing this now?"" she asked with a sigh, sitting back in her chair.

""Yes, we're doing this now.""

""I'd rather not do this at all.""

""Rory, we have to talk about this.""

""No, we don't. I'm not sixteen anymore,"" Rory said defiantly, pushing back her chair.

""I wish you'd tell me what's going on, but you don't tell me anything.""

""I can't. I wish you'd understand that. I just... I don't want to talk about this.""

""Why not?""

""Because it's my problem. You can't fix it. I have to fix it and I don't know how.""

""Rory...""

""Mom! No! I don't want any advice. I just... I need to figure out what I need, what I want... just let me do that. Please.""

""Okay.""

""I'm sorry for just showing up last night,"" Rory apologized. 

""You're always welcome here, Rory. Anytime. We're here for you, kid.""

""I know, Mom. I just needed to get out of Hartford, out of the same city as Logan so I came home. I didn't want to be at the hotel by myself.""

""You need to talk to him, Rory. Really talk to him. Not just throw barbs at him.""

""I know, but every time we talk or we come face-to-face, we both do it. It's not just me."" With a sigh, Rory fell back into her chair, admitting, ""We had dinner last night.""

Lorelai sunk into her chair. ""Wow.""

""Not really, no. He found out about the shellfish.""

""Oh.""

""That wasn't his reaction. He was hurt that I didn't call him.""

""But he wasn't around.""

""That's what I told him. I made everything so much worse,"" Rory said, running her fingers through her hair. ""I told him that there were things that he kept from me. I even insinuated that he was having an affair with Francesca.""

""Oh, Rory...,"" Lorelai began.

""I KNOW. Terrible, right? Francesca's a friend of mine. I mean, how could I even say that?""

""You're hurting, honey.""

""It's no excuse, Mom. Logan would never... he would never accuse me of something that. All the time that I spend with Colin... he could try to insinuate something there. But he doesn't.""

""Because Logan trusts you.""

""I trust him.""

Lorelai shook her head. ""No, honey. No you don't. You never really have.""

Rory stared at her mother. Lorelai was right. She had never truly trusted Logan. There was always a twinge of doubt in the back of her mind at how loyal to her he truly and if he truly loved her. She always wanted to believe the best in him, but sometimes he made it very difficult.

 

 

After Rory had gotten back to her hotel and showered, she sat on her bed, staring hard at her cell phone. With a deep breath, she pressed two buttons and waited.

 

 

Logan was sitting on the porch in the backyard with Colin and Finn, sharing a bottle of whiskey with his best friends. ""Logan your phone's ringing,"" Colin told him. 

Logan moved from his chair, walking back into the house to retrieve the phone. ""Hello?"" he answered.

""Hey... it's me.""

""Rory... hi. I wasn't expecting you to call.""

""After the way I took off last night I wasn't expecting you to, either.""

""Yeah... so, um, is something wrong?""

""No, not really. I thought I was okay with this, Logan. I thought I was ready.""

""But you're not?""

""No.""

""So, you're calling to tell me, what? That you need more time? More space? I've given you time. I've given you all the space you need.""

""Logan, I just... I can't, okay? Understand that. I need you to understand that.""

""I do, Rory. I do understand."" Logan let out a sigh. ""I'll leave you alone.""

""I'm not asking...,"" she began to say.

""No,"" he said quickly, cutting her off. ""You want space, I'll give you space. After last night I think we both need time to really think about what we're doing here. We can't keep throwing the past back at one another.""

""You're right about that.""

""We'll give it time,"" he said. ""Which is good because I'm leaving town tomorrow.""

""Big story?""

""Something like that,"" he answered vaguely.

""I guess I'll talk to you whenever you get back then.""

""Of course.""

""Have fun. And Logan?""

""Yeah?""

""Be careful. Please.""

""I will.""

Logan hung up the phone as Colin walked into the kitchen, holding the empty bottle of whiskey. ""Who was on the phone?""

""Oh, um, it was Rory.""

""You tell her about Atlantic City?""

Logan shrugged. ""Nah. It's not her scene, you know. Plus, it's just us guys.""

""And Stephanie.""

""I forget that you can't go anywhere without her.""

""Don't let her hear you say that.""

""Do you want me talk to her?"" Colin offered.

Logan shook his head. ""This decision has to be hers, Colin. Thank you for talking to her, but look where it got us. Right back where we started. I'll give her space and hopefully then she'll be ready to really try to work this out.""

Logan reached into a cabinet, taking out a fresh bottle of whiskey, glancing out the window at Finn. ""Come on,"" he told Colin as he moved toward the door. ""Finn's chasing a squirrel. Let's go save him from himself.""

""As if we have those powers,"" Colin said as he followed Logan outside.



Emily Gilmore sat in her living room, thumbing through the Monday morning newspaper. She'd been gone over a week and was catching up on current events. 

When she saw that Rory had made the paper, she smiled. Normally seeing her granddaughter in the paper excited her, but on this day, in this particular article, the excitement was gone.

Rory had been interviewed for an expose as the editor-in-chief of the Hartford Centennial. She'd acquired the position nearly a year earlier, after having worked at the Centennial since before her graduation. Rory talked about her previous work as a reporter for the Centennial, then to her promotion after her boss retired. She tried diligently to dodge all personal questions, but the one question that she did answer was to say that her and her husband were going through a trying time and were undergoing a trial separation. No decisions had been made yet.

Emily tossed the paper onto the table in front of her, debating her next move. She leapt off the couch, grabbed her keys and purse bellowing, ""Richard! I'm going to town!"" as she made her way to the door.

She was going to resolve this once and for all. She was not going to let Rory and Logan ruin their marriage. Not if she had anything to say about it."

Summary: Future-fic. When things begin to slip away, what to you do? You return to the beginning and start anew.

<lj-cut text=""I'm not going to win you back jetting off after a story now am I?"">

It was Monday, and boy did she hate Mondays. She detested them. Her first instinct was always to crawl back under the covers and pretend that it was still Sunday. But today she couldn't do that. She had meetings, with people. People that she couldn't ignore. Meetings that she couldn't cancel.

Mondays sucked.

As Rory ambled through her daily routine, she realized just how much she missed her own house. Her own bed. Her closet. Her coffeemaker.

What she didn't miss, though, was the echoes. No, she didn't miss those at all. 

Most of all she liked that her house wasn't a long commute to work. At the hotel it was. A very long commute. One that normally had her stuck in traffic for over an hour. 

And today was no different. She had been stuck in traffic for well over an hour, arriving at her office late for her first meetings with a new reporter.

""I know, I know, I'm three quarters past late,"" she said, bustling past her secretary.

""Your first meeting was canceled,"" Mary Jane blurted out after Rory.

""What?!""

""I tried to call your cell, but it went right to voice mail. Miss Henry had to rush her daughter to the hospital this morning. He swallowed a cat toy... or something.""

""A cat toy?""

""I'm pretty sure that's what she said.""

""Gross,"" Rory said, making a face that made her secretary giggle.

""She rescheduled for next week.""

""Hopefully it's on a day when there aren't three wrecks on the road to get to the office,"" she said, spinning back around to her office.

""Oh! You have a visitor!"" Mary Jane shouted after Rory.

But it was too late. Rory had already pushed open her door to find her husband sitting at her desk. 

He looked comfortable, she noted as she stared at him, reclined in her chair, his feet propped on her desk. And yet he was the picture of grace. Logan looked at his watch, tapping it with his finger. ""A quarter to ten and she finally arrives!""

Rory closed the door behind herself. ""I wasn't aware that we had an appointment.""

""We don't. I've been waiting here since eight-thirty for you. You're an hour late.""

""I'll refrain from reminding you of the many times I waited for you and you didn't show up when you were expected.""

""Okay, point taken.""

Rory threw her purse and her briefcase onto the nearest chair, then pulled off her jacket as she asked, ""So what are you doing here?""

""I'm on my way to Manhattan to have lunch with my sister.""

""But you felt compelled to stop by and annoy me first?"" she asked, moving toward the coffee pot on the far side of the room. 

""Well... yes,"" he said with a smirk. ""I wanted to run something by you. And doing it over the phone seemed so impersonal.""

""Oh? And here I thought impersonal was your new thing.""

He ignored her jabs. ""I was wondering if you'd like to go to dinner.""

Rory turned around to face him. ""With you?""

""That was the idea, yes.""

She turned back around to fumble with the coffee pot. ""Well, I, uh... I don't know,"" she stammered as she concentrated on brewing her coffee, trying hard to ignore the fact that her husband had just asked her out. <i>Stranger things have happened</i>, she chided herself. ""This is kind of short notice, Logan,"" she finally told him. ""I mean, I have a life, friends, plans... I can't just...,"" she went on.

""Not tonight, Rory,"" he interrupted, a bit annoyed that she had just assumed that he was just springing this on her.

""Oh, I just thought...""

""That I normally plan at the last minute?""

""Yeah, but in my defense you do so my assumption was partially correct.""

""Well, I'm turning over a new leaf.""

""Are you?"" she asked, eying him curiously. She didn't know how to take on this new and improved Logan. It was quite an adjustment from the one that she'd come to despise. ""So when did you want to have this dinner?""

""Whatever night is good for you.""

""What about whatever night is good for you? I'm sure you have obligations and whatnot.""

""My schedule is clear and will remain clear. Whatever night you pick, I'll be free.""

""How?""

""What do you mean <i>how</i>?""

""How can you just say that you'll be free? You have work and... you have work.""

He scoffed. She was making fun of him. ""Because that's how it is,"" he deadpanned.

""Oh, really?""

""I'm not going to win you back jetting off after a story now am I?""

""No... you're not.""

Logan pushed himself to his feet, making his way across the room toward her. ""I wanted to see you before I had lunch with Honor.""

""How come?"" she asked as she began pouring coffee into two mugs.

""Funny, I thought I made that pretty clear: I wanted to see you.""

Rory turned toward him, flashing him a smile. ""That's sweet."" Rory handed Logan a cup of coffee as she told him, ""I'm actually glad you stopped by.""

""You are?""

""Yeah."" She nodded her head. ""After our last conversation I just figured that you would've contacted before now. Waiting an entire week to make a 
move is not the typical Logan Huntzberger strategy.""

""I didn't want to seem too overeager."" Logan shrugged. ""Plus I was kind of holding out hope that you'd call.""

""You're the guy. You're supposed to call. That's the gentlemanly thing to do.""

""Says who?""

""Says Lorelai.""

""Ah."" Logan glanced at his watch. ""Damn. I have to go,"" he said, setting his coffee mug down on the coffee cart. ""Think about dinner.""

""I will. And tell Honor I said hi.""

""Of course."" Logan wanted to hug her, kiss her, something, but knew that would only make their situation all the more awkward. So he didn't. He gave her a longing look, then began making his way toward the door. 

""Hey Logan?"" Rory called after him. He turned back around to face her. ""Saturday?""

Logan nodded his head, smiling. ""Saturday sounds great.""

""Call me during the week and we can discuss it further.""

""Okay. I'll do that.""

Logan turned back around to leave.

""Oh, and hey?""

""Yeah?""

""Drive safe.""

 


Rory was frantic. She couldn't find her pearl earrings. Logan had given her those pearl earrings as a present after graduation. She loved those earrings and she couldn't find them. And they matched perfect with her cream colored dress!

Picking up her cell, she dialed her mother's number, begging for Lorelai to answer with each passing ring.

""Helloooo,"" Lorelai answered.

""Mom! Do you have my pearl earrings?""

""Well, hello to you, too, dear. How am I? I am fine. Perfect, actually. Oh, the weather, it's great. You know, I think the house needs to be painted again. I noticed that the paint has began chipping and I think that...,"" Lorelai trailed off when Rory cut her off.

""MOTHER!""

""What?! Sorry. My, my, aren't we in a mood.""

""I'm sorry. I just... Logan gave me those earrings and I can't find them and usually when my jewelry goes missing, you have it.""

""Well, I don't have those particular earrings. You always tell me that I'm not allow to borrow any of your Logan bought jewelry.""

""I do not.""

""Yes, you do. I'm always in awe of the pretty and you constantly rebuff any and all bribes I throw at you.""

""I do not.""

""You do, too. Sorry honey, but I don't have your earrings.""

""Dammit,"" Rory cursed as she threw clothes out of her suitcase in a frantic search to find her earrings.

""Why do you need them? Hot date?""

""As a matter of fact, yes.""

""You... you have a date?"" Lorelai couldn't believe her ears. Her daughter was dating again. Her divorce wasn't even final! Plus, Lorelai wasn't sure that she was even over Logan.

""It's just dinner with a guy I used to know,"" she said sadly.

Lorelai was shell shocked. ""Wow, I... I didn't think you were ready to date. Who is he?""

""I'm not,"" she said quickly. She wasn't ready for that particular discussion with her mother. Lorelai would be proud to know that she had agreed to work at her marriage. But until she knew if she had marriage left to work at, she didn't want to tell her mother anything. ""And it's not even really a date. It's just dinner with a friend, but I can't really talk right now. I need to find these earrings because I'm already late for meeting him.""

""Okay. Well... have fun, kid. Call me when you get home.""

""I will."" 

Rory hung up quickly, throwing her phone onto the bed as she reached the bottom of her suitcase, smiling as she caught site of her earrings, hidden in the corner fabric. ""Thank goodness!"" she said, swooping them up. 

Walking to the dresser, she put her earrings in, sighing as she gave herself a once over, then caught the site of the clock in the mirror. ""Shit. I'm late!"" 

She grabbed her purse and put on her jacket as she exited the room and headed for the elevator.

 

Rory was collecting her ticket from the valet when Logan pulled up behind her car. ""You're late,"" she said when he had stepped onto the sidewalk beside her. He reeked of cigar smoke, hidden under several sprays of expensive cologne. <i>He'd come straight from a meeting</i>, she noted, disappointed.

""Yeah, sorry. But I'm not the only one. You arrived just seconds before me.""

She smiled at him, despite reservations that had begun to sink in. ""I couldn't find my earrings,"" she spat out. It was as good of an excuse as any.

""You nearly stood me up for jewelry?""

""Not just any piece of jewelry."" 

Logan quickly recognized the earrings that he'd bought for her for her graduation from Yale. He had spent four hours in a jewelry store with Stephanie agonizing on the right type of gift for her. He wanted something beautiful, but totally Rory. He wanted something classy, but wanted to make sure that she would wear whatever it was he bought her. Stephanie had insisted on the pearls. Diamonds suggested something more, she had told him. So, he'd bought her the pearl earrings and Rory had loved them. She'd worn them on their wedding day as well. 

""They matched my dress.""

""So I see,"" Logan said, looking her up and down. ""We, um, we should get inside before they give away our table,"" he said, offering his arm to her. As they made their way into the restaurant, he whispered, ""You look beautiful.""

""And you smell like my grandfather.""

 

Logan stared across the table at his wife. She was nervous, that much was obvious. She had barely said two words since they had arrived at their table. She had sent him a look of disdain when she realized that they were dining at a restaurant where the staff knew him on a first name basis. But she'd made no complaints. Not to him, anyway. She'd followed him to the table and said nothing since, save for a few hmm's as she looked over her menu.

""I didn't mean to come straight from a business,"" he told her as they looked over their menus.

""It's fine. I can't say I wasn't expecting it.""

Logan didn't know what to say, and, apparently neither did she since she once again remained silent.

When the waiter approached to take their order, Logan sat back as she gave her order. She surprised him when she ordered a salad. ""Salad?"" he questioned. ""Since when do you eat salad?""

She just shrugged, choosing not to answer him. She made no move to order anything else, piquing his curiosity. Logan quickly ordered his meal, turning his attention to Rory once the waiter had left their table. ""When we used to go to restaurants like this you used to order shellfish of some kind.""

""I used to love shellfish, until I found out I was allergic to it.""

""You're allergic to shellfish?""

""Yeah. Paris and I had gone to a restaurant one night and I had an allergic reaction to lobster. She had to rush me to the hospital.""

""You were hospitalized?"" he asked, concern etched in his voice.

""Only for two days,"" she said, taking a sip of her water.

""When was this? How come I didn't know? How come you didn't call me?""

""Logan, it was a while ago. It's no big deal.""

""No big deal? You went to the hospital and I didn't get a courtesy call?""

""You were off somewhere. I didn't know where you were and I wasn't going to pull you away from whatever story it was you were covering to tell you that I was in the hospital after eating bad fish. I went to the hospital, they gave me a shot and the doctor said no more fish until I wanted to look like Flounder again. End of story. Now, would you please drop it?""

""No, I won't drop it!""

""Look, there are things that you don't care to share with me even though I deserve a right to know. This is one of the things that you probably had the right to know that I kept from you.""

""So, this is some form of retribution? I was a lousy husband and you're making me pay for it?""

""If you want to look at it that way...,"" Rory finished as the waiter arrived with the bottle of wine that Logan had ordered. The waiter filled Logan's  glass and as he moved to fill in her glass, she stopped him. ""No, thank you. I can't drink Merlot.""

""Allergic to that too?"" Logan scoffed.

She shook her head. ""I've taken a dislike to it.""

""Fine,"" Logan said shooing the waiter away with the remainder of the bottle. ""You've excluded me out of your life on purpose.""

""Like you haven't excluded me out of yours? Dammit, Logan you didn't even tell me that you were leaving your father's company. I had to hear it on the news. How do you think that made me feel? Then, to hear that you had been meeting with the president of the rival company? I had to take a step back and wonder who this person was that I married. After that it was one thing after another. You would call me en route to wherever it was that you were covering a story. Never once did you invite me along.""

""It was business.""

""Including all those dinners with Francesca Moreno?""

""How'd you know about those?""

""I just know, okay?""

""Nothing was going on between Francesca and I. You have to believe that.""

""I don't have to believe anything you say, Logan. Because, honestly, I don't anymore.""

""Then why the hell did you agree to this?""

Rory shifted her eyes away from him, not wanting to answer his question.

He followed her eyes. ""Come on. It's not a hard question. Did you do it just to appease me? To see if there was truly anything left between us? What? Come on. Tell me. I'm dying to know why you came when obviously you can't stand to be in the same room with the man that's a mere stranger to you.""

Rory shrugged. ""I don't know, Logan. I've been asking myself that very same question. I mean, I must've been completely insane to believe that Colin had made a valid point when he said that I should try to work things out with you.""

""Colin? You talked to Colin about us?""

""Yeah, he came to my office to reason with me about the divorce.""

""This is between <i>us</i>, Rory.""

""Colin's one of our oldest friends. He wants to see us work things out.""

""You came here because of Colin?""

She shook her head. ""No not <i>because</i> of Colin,"" she said sternly, letting out a deep sigh. This man was so frustrating. ""I wanted to see for myself if there was anything left between us. Obviously, there isn't,"" she said standing up quickly. ""I don't know why I agreed to this,"" she said, making a move to leave. His hand on her forearm gave her pause.

""Don't leave yet.""

""Why should I stay?""

""Because we already ordered.""

""And your point is?"" She pulled her arm free from his grasp. ""You've left me before in the middle of the meal to dine alone. Now you'll see how it feels.""

Rory left the table without so much as a backwards glance in Logan's direction, feeling horrible for having left him alone. By the time she'd climbed into her car, she realized that what she'd told him at the table was the truth. It wasn't any worse than the many times that he'd left her alone.

Once on the road, she decided not to return to the hotel. 

Instead, she went home."

<lj-cut text=""This is Hartford where anything concerning the Huntzberger's is everyone's business."">

It was the fourth night in a row that he'd stayed late at the office. After receiving the divorce papers,  he'd given up all hope that Rory was going to come home of her own free will so he had stopped waiting. He concerned himself with work, as usual. It was all he could do to keep his mind off of his failing marriage.

""Don't you ever go home?""

Logan looked up from his work surprised to find Colin standing in the doorway to his office. ""No, actually I don't,"" Logan said as Colin pushed his way into the office.

Colin's eyes roamed the large room. ""Nice digs you got here. An upgrade, I see.""

""That's right you haven't been here since my promotion.""

""Promotion? So you're a hot shot reporter, now?""

""It certainly helps to have been brought up with newspapers all your life. It gives you a certain advantage over everyone else. Plus putting me out there proves well against the competition.""

""I'm sure your father loves that.""

Colin took a seat in front of Logan, propping his feet onto the corner of his desk. ""Have you talked to him any?""

Logan shook his head. ""Not since I left the company.""

""What about Rory?""

""As far as I know, no. I know that Rory still talks to Honor every now and then, but my parents? No. She despises them almost as much as they do her. More, I think.""

""Rory doesn't despise your parents, Logan.""

""She doesn't?"" Logan asked, baffled.

Colin shook his head. ""She hates them. I'm talking deep-seated hate. Hate with every fiber of her being. Hate like...""

""Okay,"" Logan said, interrupting Colin's tirade. ""I get it. She hates them.""

Colin waited a few moments, then asked, ""So have you heard from her?""

""Why would I? I'm not expecting her to call me and say that she's changed her mind. It's not going to happen.""

""Logan...""

""Colin... don't. I know what you're going to say.""

""How do you know what I'm going to say?""

""I know what you were going to say because my conscience has been telling me the same thing for the past few weeks. You were going to say that if I love her I'd fight to win her back. That if I really wanted to save my marriage that I would've... that I would've done something.""

""I wasn't going to say that verbatim.""

""But something of the like?""

""Pretty much.""

""Look, I'm dealing with this my own way and forcing myself on her is not going to help. When she's ready to talk to me, she'll talk to me, until then I'm giving her all the space she needs.""

""But if you give her too much space she's going to start thinking that you don't want her, either. Call her. Talk to her. Make her see that even though she's ready to call it quits, that you aren't. You can talk to her at the party.""

""Shit,"" Logan muttered, cursing himself for forgetting his best friend's engagement party. ""Colin it totally slipped my mind... I've been so preoccupied lately...""

Colin waved it off. He had suspected that Logan had forgotten, which had spurned his late night visit to Logan's office. ""It's okay. You have a lot on your mind.""

""Rory and I had talked it over when she'd gotten the invitation a few weeks ago, but now... I don't know if it's such a good idea I go. I think I have a business meeting scheduled for tomorrow night anyway.""

""If you can't make it, it's fine. It's probably just as well because I think Stephanie's supposed to goad Rory into showing up. At least knowing that you're not going to be there will make it easier to get Rory to agree to show.""

""You're sure it's not a problem?""

Colin waved it off. ""Not at all. You know I want you there, but if you can't make it, you can't make it. I'm not gonna cry. Just as long as you don't miss the wedding.""

""Yeah, like I would miss THAT.""

 

If she didn't hurry she was going to be late, Rory realized, glancing at the clock as she sat down on the bed to put on her shoes. After weeks of ignoring Stephanie's phone calls, she had finally called her friend back, only to be blasted for not RSVP'ing to Stephanie and Colin's engagement party. So to make up for ignoring one of her best friends and forgetting to politely RSVP, she had promised Stephanie that she would be at the party early to keep her company.

But she was already fifteen minutes late. 

Moving to her suitcase, she roamed through for her jewelry pouch, her fingers skimming along the velvet box hidden at the bottom of her bag. Wearily, she opened the box, smiling at the glinting diamonds of her wedding ring. She had taken it off after her phone call with Logan feeling that if she was actually going to go through with the divorce that she should try getting used to not wearing her wedding ring. 

As far as she knew no one knew about her and Logan's marital problems. Most of her friends were still under the impression that she and Logan were still together so to keep up pretenses, she would act like a married woman.

She took a moment to weigh her options, then plucked the ring from it's box, sliding it onto it's rightful finger on her left hand. 

Slamming the box shut, she threw it back into her suitcase, hastily grabbed her purse and keys and was out the door.

 

Finn whistled as he walked into the sparse living room. ""She took everything with her?"" he asked as Logan made his way down the stairs.

Logan shook his head, clasping his watch around his wrist. ""I'm not sure what she did with the furniture. I know she hated it so she could've burned it for all I know.""

""Do you know where she is?"" 

""Yeah, I do.""  

""Well, have you gone to talk to her?"" Finn asked, following Logan into the kitchen. 

""She doesn't want to talk to me. She doesn't want to hear anything I have to say,"" Logan told Finn.

""So make her listen.""

""It's not that simple, Finn.""

""Why not?""

""Because... it's just... not. A lot's happened between Rory and I... even if we could save our marriage, I'm not sure that we could save our relationship. We're not the same people we were in college.""

""Obviously.""

""What's that supposed to mean?""

""Nothing.""

""No. That had to mean something. Now what was it?""

""Just... the Logan I knew in college went after what he wanted. He wouldn't have cared about extenuating circumstances or divorce papers. If he wanted to save his marriage, then he'd do whatever he could to save it. But you're right--you're not the same Logan you were in college.""

""Don't say that with such disappointment, Finn.""

""Well, I am disappointed, Logan. You're letting her just get away!""

""What the hell am I supposed to do?! Huh? She moved out. She's living in a goddamn hotel room. She served me with divorce papers. As far as she's concerned this is over! I'd be fighting a losing battle, Finn and I just... I can't.""

""You're scared that you'll lose her anyway.""

Logan stared blankly at Finn.

""If you don't try you'll lose her, but you're also scared that if you do try she'll reject you and it'd have been a moot point.""

""It's all moot now anyway. I lost her. I took her for granted. And now... now she's gone and our marriage is over."" Logan glanced down at his watch. ""I have to go. You know how to let yourself out,"" Logan yelled over his shoulder.

""You can't just give up, Logan!""

""Watch me!""

 

""You're late!"" Stephanie snapped when she opened the door before Rory had a chance to ring the doorbell.

""I know, I know. Traffic was...""

""Oh, don't you dare blame the traffic. You're always late."" As Rory began to object, Stephanie took her by the hand, leading her through the house toward the backyard.

""There's a lot of people here,"" Rory said as Stephanie dropped her hand as they stepped out into the backyard.

""Most of whom Colin and I can't stand, but what can you do. They're here to celebrate,"" Stephanie told Rory as she led her to the makeshift bar under an oak tree in the backyard of Colin's parents' house. They each ordered their drink and watched as their bartender prepared their drinks. ""This was all Candace's doing. She wanted to throw the party. I don't know why she went to so much trouble. She hates me.""

""She does not hate you, Stephanie,"" Rory cajoled her friend, accepting her drink from the bartender. 

""She does hate me. She's always hated me. I've never been good enough for Colin.""

""No one is, I think,"" Rory said as they watched Colin with his mother. 

Stephanie shrugged her shoulders as her eyes searched the crowd for Colin. Her eyes landed on him from across the yard talking to her mother. ""Look at them. They're so chummy. Your mom's not like that with Logan, is she?""

Rory shook her head. ""Not at all. I mean, they get along, thankfully, but they've never laughed like that.""

""You ever think that maybe that's part of your problem?""

""What problem?""

""Why you're so eager to end this marriage? Because your mother doesn't really bond with Logan?""

""What?!"" Rory exclaimed. ""That's not true. This has nothing to do with my mother.""

Stephanie shrugged. ""If you say so,"" she said as she began to walk away. 

Rory ran after her, spinning her around. ""Why'd you say that?""

""It was just an observation. Look. Rory, I've noticed that your mother's opinion of your life means a lot to you. You and her have a strong bond and sometimes I think that you're scared to have a strong relationship with anyone but her.""

""You think I'm running from my marriage because I'm afraid of being too close to Logan?""

""Precisely.""

""That's the craziest thing I've ever heard, Stephanie!""

""It may be but is it so far from the truth? You hold people at arm's length. You let a few get close, but then you manage to push them away. You may not do it consciously, but you do it.""

""I...,"" Rory stammered. Stephanie was making a point and GOD did she hate it that she was so transparent. She hated that Stephanie was able to see straight through her. There were so many reasons on why she had filed for divorce... she couldn't cite one in particular. There were so many reasons why she thought dissolving her marriage was the right thing to do even though in her heart, she knew it wasn't. But only she knew that. That was something she'd keep her herself for the time being.

When Colin joined them, Rory excused herself, leaving the betrothed by themselves. 

""Okay, what'd you do?"" Colin asked Stephanie once Rory was out of earshot.

""What makes you think that I did anything?"" Stephanie asked innocently.

""The way Rory just stalked off... she looks like the fun has been drained right out of her. What did you say to her, Stephanie?""

""Nothing that wasn't true.""

""Leave it be,"" Colin said sternly. ""You can't push them back together so don't try."" He knew his girlfriend and if there was one thing Stephanie hated it was when things were not perfect in her world. If an opportunity arose for her to meddle, she would. It was who she was. After all, Stephanie was partially responsible for Rory and Logan being together at all.

They had broken up during Logan's last semester at Yale. When Logan's problems with his father had gotten to be too overwhelming, he had broken things off with Rory. She concentrated on school and made no move to reconcile with him. It was then that Stephanie stepped in and pushed the two of them back together. 

""Oops, too late,"" she said, smiling as she raised her hand to wave at their latest guest.

""What are you...,"" Colin began to ask, turning around to spot Logan. ""How did you get them both here?"" Colin asked, watching as Logan stopped to talk to Stephanie's sister.

Stephanie put a finger over her lips to silence him. ""A girl never tells her secrets of deception, Colin,"" she told him as she began leading him in Logan's direction. 

 

Rory had been talking to Stephanie's parents and her sister Cindy for the past twenty minutes. Then, as if her night couldn't get any worse, Colin's cousin, Melinda, joined in on the conversation. 

Rory extended goodbyes to Stephanie's parents as they moved on to mingle with their other guests and was taken aback when Melinda asked, ""You're married to Logan Huntzberger, right?"" When Rory didn't answer right away, Melinda continued. ""At least I think that's what Colin said.""

""Yes, I'm married to Logan. Why? Do you know him?""

Melinda shook her head. ""Oh, no. I've just heard things about him. Most of it is just good old gossip, I'm sure,"" she said with a shrug. ""But I heard someone say that his reputation as a ladies man still prevails.""

""Does it?"" Rory asked, her voice hitching in her throat. She didn't even want to entertain the thought that that shred of gossip bearing any truth.

Melinda nodded. ""He works in an office congregated by women. That doesn't bother you?""

""Not at all.""

""So you're not at all worried about competition?"" Rory shook her head. ""I mean, even now that you and he are divorcing?""

Rory watched as Cindy's eyebrows shot up. ""You and Logan are divorcing?""

""I... uh... we...,"" Rory stammered as Colin sidled up beside her.

""Don't you two have other people to annoy. Whether or not Rory and Logan are divorcing is none of your business,"" he said pointedly, failing not to notice how they were gawking at Rory's wedding ring. Why his mother had chosen to invite Melinda, he would never know. He hated the majority of his kinfolk, barely even acknowledging his parents as members of his family. 

As Melinda slinked off with Cindy in tow, they heard Melinda whisper, ""If I was him, I'd demand the ring back. I'm sure it's probably worth a small fortune.""

""It's probably in the pre-nup,"" Cindy added with a look thrown over her shoulder at Rory and Colin.

""Don't listen to them,"" Colin said, wrapping a reassuring arm around her shoulders.

Rory leaned into him, resting her head on his shoulder. ""Does everyone know?""

""Word travels fast, Rory. This is Hartford, you know where anything concerning the Huntzberger's is everyone's business. At least they make it their business.""

""I wanted to keep it quiet... I wanted this to be just between Logan and I... and now... God, he's going to think I'm going around bragging to everyone that we're getting a divorce. He's going to hate me.""

""No he's not.""

Rory spun around quickly, her knees weakening at the sight of Logan standing behind her. Her eyes never left his as she heard Colin say, ""I'll leave you two alone to talk.""

 

It took Rory a few moments to find her voice, finally able to spit out a chocked, ""Hi.""

Logan smiled at her in kind. ""From the look on your face, I guess you didn't know that I was here either.""

Rory shook her head. ""Stephanie said that you weren't coming. I'm just surprised to see you.""

""I wasn't going to come. I didn't want to face everyone and the onslaught of questions regarding the two of us, and I guess a part of me didn't want to face you either, but I knew that I should be here.""

""I agree. Colin and Stephanie are your oldest friends. I thought it would've been rude for you to not celebrate with them."" She looked over her shoulder where Stephanie, Colin and Finn were watching them. 

""I came for you, too,"" he spat out truthfully.

""Pardon me?"" 

""I wanted to see you.""

At his sentiment, Rory didn't know what to do or say so she did the only thing that sprang to mind. She turned around to leave. Logan's hand caught her wrist, willing her around to face him.

""Look at me, Ace.""

She was reluctant to look at him at first, but finally lifted her eyes to meet his, hating what she saw--desperation.

""I just want to talk to you.""

Rory's eyes dropped to her waist, realizing that he was holding her hand. The moment they both noticed what had transpired within a few moments, they pulled their hands away.

She folded her arms across her chest. ""I don't know, Logan. I don't think...,"" she began to object.

""Five minutes. That's all I ask.""

""Five minutes.""

 

When Colin and Finn had carted Logan away, Rory took that as her chance to lash out at Stephanie for the obvious setup. ""You're devious!"" Rory shouted at Stephanie, pulling her away from her flirting match with the bartender.

""Oh, I guess you saw Logan.""

""Yes I saw Logan! Did you think I wouldn't?""

Stephanie let out a deep sigh. ""Look, Rory. I'm looking out for you. I don't want you to regret this,"" she said. ""And you will,"" she added when Rory scoffed. ""Things may not have turned out like you expected, but honestly what did you expect marrying a newspaper tycoon. It's who Logan is. It's who he's always been. He's been bred for it and you knew that even before you were married. I'm not saying to forgive him for what he's done because most of the blame lies with him, but you're not innocent here yourself. You could've told him what you were planning to do before you did it. But you didn't. You didn't give him the chance to try to mend fences. You closed the door on him before he could even unlock it."" Stephanie gulped down the remaining contents of her martini. ""And, FYI, I didn't invite him as a subplot to get the two of you together. You were invited before your separation. I had it on good authority that he wasn't coming, but obviously he changed his mind.""

""Obviously,"" Rory said, watching Logan with Colin and Finn. The three best friends were engaged in a private conversation, laughing and joking much like they did in college.

""Think about what you're doing putting him back on the market,"" Stephanie whispered in her ear before walking away. 

Rory made her way to the bar for another drink. As she sat down and began to sip on her second martini, she watched as Melinda joined Colin, Finn and Logan. She watched the easy way that Melinda flirted with Logan to only have him reject her by showing her his wedding ring. A chill ran down her spine when Logan turned in her direction to point her out to Melinda, sending her a half-hearted smile after Melinda had retreated in a huff.

Rory held Logan's gaze for a moment, then broke it to look down at her own wedding ring. 

Pushing off her barstool, she made her way toward the house. She bounded upstairs, heading for the bathroom, but changed her direction, finding her way into Colin's old bedroom. She closed the door behind herself, needing a few moments to collect herself. She made her way to the bed to sit down, dropping her head into her hands. 

It was supposed to be cut and dry. Leave. Divorce. The End. But it wasn't turning out to be as simple as she had hoped. The walls around her had been breaking since Logan's phone call a few days before. To hear his voice, to hear him remind her of how much he loved her was enough to make her crack and begin to rethink her decision. It wasn't easy letting go and she wasn't even all that positive that she was ready to let go even though she strongly backed her claim to her friends and her family.

She wanted to believe that if she gave him a chance that he would change. She wanted him to.  But she didn't want to risk being put into the exact situation six months from now. She couldn't risk it. She couldn't risk hurting again.

She heard the door creak open a few moments later. She let out a deep resonating sigh before she said, ""You know if you want to sneak up on me, you should start wearing a different cologne."" She turned to look at him, asking, ""What are you doing in here, Logan?""

""I thought we could talk since we were interrupted earlier.""

""Here? Now?""

""It seems as good a time as any.""

""You want to hash this out now? Can't it wait?""

Logan shook his head. ""No, it can't. You're not getting out of here until you talk to me,"" he said sternly. 

""What's there to talk about, Logan?""

""Everything, Rory,"" he said, pushing himself away from the door. He moved toward the bed, sitting down beside her, leaving a reasonable amount of space between. 

""Logan I just think... if we talk about this you're going to have false hope. I don't want to give you hope that this could work. I've made up my mind.""

""So you've completely closed the door? No matter what I do... no matter what I say, this is it?""

She nodded her head slowly. ""You closed the door when you shut me out. After you left your father's company you worked harder to prove to him that you could make it without him."" Rising to her feet, she told him, ""But you only proved that you could make it without me.""

""Rory...""

""Logan... I can't,"" she told him, taken off-guard when he grabbed her wrist. It had always been his way to get her attention. Every time they argued, she would do her best to shut him out, ignore him, but he would always grab her wrist, forcing her to look at him, forcing her to feel how powerful their connection was just by the touch of his hand. 

Like now. Pulsating stronger than ever. 

His eyes moved to her hand, his thumb brushing over her diamond ring. ""You're wearing your wedding ring,"" he noted, hopeful.

""So? I like it.""

""That's the only reason?""

""What other reason would there be?""

Logan shrugged. ""I don't know... I thought... maybe...""

""See? This is what I didn't want. This means nothing, Logan,"" she said, slipping the ring off. ""Our marriage is dead and if you need clarity, then here,"" she said, holding her wedding ring out to him.

""What are you doing? I don't want it.""

""Take it.""

""It's yours. I don't want the damn thing.""

Rory grabbed Logan's hand, placing the ring into his palm. She balled up his fist as she told him, ""There. We're finished. Are we all clear?""

""Crystal,"" he said through gritted teeth.

Rory left Logan alone in the room, passing Colin in the hallway. Colin peered into his old room, finding Logan sitting on his bed, staring at his hands. ""What happened?""

""It's over. I guess I finally have to accept it.""

Colin noticed what Logan was staring at it. ""Is that...?""

""Rory's wedding ring? It sure is. She wanted to make things crystal clear to me that we are over.""

""So you're just giving up?""

Logan rose from the bed, shaking his head. ""Of course not. If she thinks she's getting rid of me that easily she's sadly mistaken."""

"event","Title: The Dating Game
Characters/Relationships: Rory/Logan
Disclaimer: The characters aren't mine. They belong to ASP and Co. No copyright infringement intended.
Summary: Future-fic. When things begin to slip away, what to you do? You return to the beginning and start anew.


<lj-cut text=""I can't sustain this marriage by myself. I can't do this alone."">

Logan sat at his desk, watching as his co-workers bustled out of their offices, glad to be calling it a day before dusk. It was Friday so everyone was headed home to spend the long holiday weekend with their families. 

Fridays were a reminder of the start of a weekend normally filled with relaxation and free time. They were also a constant reminder of the one thing that he didn't have that his co-workers did: a family to go home to. 

Reclining back in his chair, Logan took a moment to run his hands across his face. He winced realizing that he hadn't shaved in days. Nearly a week, actually. He hadn't felt the need to. When at home he drowned himself in Scotch and the deafening silence of the house. At work he buried himself with his usual tasks. Anything to keep his mind off of Rory and the fact that she had yet to make any contact at all.

Pushing out of his desk chair, he made his way over to the window. 

He watched as the sun made it's descent from the sky, exploding the sky in a rainbow of colors. Rory loved sunsets. She loved sunrises, too. He wondered if she still did... 

Had things between the two of them really reached the breaking point? Where things between them so bad that he had to wonder if things that he had once loved and admired about her were no longer part of who she was?

He'd picked up the phone to call her numerous times, but always slammed it down. He never knew what to say. He never knew how to convey his feelings. Maybe that was the problem. He had never learned how to talk to her, to trust her. Perhaps that was why he had spent so much energy keeping her out. 

Perhaps.

Settling back into his chair, Logan stared at the empty computer screen before him, groaning. The shrill sound of his ringing phone, pierced the silence. ""Hello?""

""It's Friday and you're still working?""

Logan smiled, leaning back in his chair. ""Colin? Man, it seems like forever since we've spoken.""

""Yeah, it has been forever. So, did you get the invitation?""

""Invitation? For what?""

""For the engagement party?""

""Oh. Right. The engagement party. Yeah. We got it.""

""You didn't RSVP. I hope you and Rory can come.""

""Yeah... we'll see.""

""So speaking of the missus, how is she? I know that she's been avoiding Stephanie's phone calls. Finn's too. Everything okay?""

""I'm sure they are.""

""What, you don't know?""

""Actually, I don't.

""Is there something I should know?"" Colin asked, panicked.

""She, uh... she left.""

""Like... left?""

""Yeah. I came home from work one day and she was gone. She'd cleared out the living room and packed our marriage away into a box.""

""I'm sorry, Logan. I didn't know.""

""It's okay. No one did. It's not something you want publicized, you know.""

""I'm sure. Look if you ever need to talk...""

""Thanks for the offer, but it's not necessary. We'll work it out."" 

""Anyway, I was calling to invite you out for drinks with me and Finn.""

""I don't know... I have tons of work I should probably do."" 

""Just a few hours. It'll take your mind off of everything."" 

""Drinks sounds great. Where?""

""Murphy's Pub downtown. Finn and I will be there. Just find us.""

""I'll meet you there in a half-hour.""

As Logan began packing papers into his briefcase, he chanced a look up as a young blonde woman approached his door. ""Mr. Huntzberger?""

Smiling cordially, he asked, ""Yes? May I help you?""

She walked toward him, handing him a clipboard. ""I need you to sign,"" she told him, instructing to a blank line at the bottom of the page.

""What's this?"" Logan asked as scribbled his signature. 

The woman shrugged. ""I do not know, sir,"" she said as she handed him a long yellow envelope. ""I'm just the messenger. Have a nice weekend.""

""Yeah, you, too,"" he said, watching as the woman exited his office. Curious, Logan tore open the envelope. He pulled out the papers from inside, his eyes widening as he skimmed them. ""You have got to be kidding me,"" he muttered to himself.

Logan took a moment to thumb through the papers before he picked up his phone, taking a deep breath before he began to dial.



Rory was sitting out on the balcony of her hotel room, her phone lying in her lap as she waited for the inevitable phone call. When it vibrated, she looked down and wasn't surprised to see Logan's name on the display.

Clearing her throat, she answered the phone with a choked, ""Hello?""

""Divorce papers!,"" Logan shouted. ""You served me with divorce papers?"" He was angry. That much was obvious. She had prepared for him being angry. 

""Logan...""

""Don't even try to make me calm down, Rory! First you leave without telling me, then you file for divorce? We didn't get to talk this over.""

""What good would that have done? We'd be exactly where we are now.""

""I get it. You're upset. But this? Tell me that you aren't serious about this.""

""I am.""

""Come home. We can talk about this,"" he pleaded with her. He hated having to resort to begging, but if it was a last resort, he'd certainly take it.

""Home? Home is in Stars Hollow, Logan. My grandparents house is more homey than that castle that I've been living in for the past three years. I can't sustain this marriage by myself. I can't do this alone. I won't do this alone.""

""I'm not asking you to. I'm asking you to give me a chance to make it better.""

""You can't make it better. You've spent the last three years making it worse and frankly Logan I think it's time we both face it. This isn't going to work. You and me--we're not going to work."" She pleaded with him, ""Just... just sign the papers.""

""No, I'm not signing the papers,"" he said sternly. 

""If you love me, you'd sign them.""

""It's because I love you I'm refusing to sign them. We can work this out, Rory. I know we can. You can't be willing to throw away a six year relationship because...""

""Because what, Logan? I'd love for you to be able to tell me why it was I left.""

""That's just it. I have no idea why you left. You never said anything. If you'd just told me...""

""Told you? When was I supposed to tell you? When you were jetting off to Paris or London? When you were sleeping at the office instead of coming home? When you decided that work was more important than me?""

""How could you say that?"" He asked, genuinely hurt by her accusation. ""Rory, you're the most important thing in my life. Work is definitely not more important than you.""

""It certainly feels that way, Logan.""

""I can't help the way you feel, even if it is unfounded. You can't be questioning how much I love you. You know I love you.""

""Do I? You haven't... how could I when... I married you because I love you, because I wanted to spend my life with you. You married me because you needed an arm piece.""

""Seriously you can't honestly believe that?""

He waited for a response, but when he received none, he sighed knowing that he didn't need one. Her silence was all the answer he needed. He knew that he was fighting a losing battle anyway. She'd made up her mind and she wasn't about to let him change it. ""What do you want me to do?""

""I want you to sign the papers.""

""I won't do that.""

""Logan, please.""

""You can ask me to do anything but that. You may have made up your mind that we're not worth fighting for, but that doesn't mean that I have. I'm not giving up on us, Rory.""

""There's nothing you can do to make this right. It's over, Logan. I've faced it. It's time that you face it,"" she said, her voice cracking before she hung up the phone.

Logan closed his eyes, letting the phone slip from his grasp. He debated calling her back, but she would only ignore his call. Instead, he collected himself and headed downtown to meet Colin and Finn.



At the pub, Colin and Finn were circled around a table laden with beer bottles and shot glasses. Obviously they'd been at this a while, Logan mused as he joined them, greeting them with a forced smile, regretting having shown up at all seeing that his mood didn't mirror theirs.

Colin was the first to realize that something was remiss. ""Everything okay, buddy?"" he asked, sensing Logan's foul mood.

Logan shook his head as he stared at the table in front of him, lifting it only to say, ""No, everything's not okay."" 

He signaled to the waitress, ordering a round of shots, then five extra shots. It was then that Colin and Finn exchanged a look, realizing that something was definitely off-kilter.

When the waitress returned with their shots, Logan lifted his glass. ""A toast, gentlemen.""

Colin and Finn lifted their glasses as well, Colin asking, ""What are we toasting to?""

""Here's to friendship, good booze... and the demise of my marriage. Cheers!"" Logan clinked his glass with Colin's and Finn's, then knocked back his shot as his friends stared at him dumbfounded.

They didn't know what to say and he was grateful that they remained silent as he drowned himself in his drink of choice for the night. For some reason he found that tequila was solace. It helped dull the pain. For a little while at least. Sure, it wasn't what he was accustomed to, and he'd sure as hell regret it tomorrow, but for tonight he didn't give a damn.

His world as he knew it was slipping away and try as he might, he couldn't stop it. 

But he could prolong the knowledge of it for a few hours and he proceeded to do just that as he beckoned to the waitress for a fresh round of drinks."

Characters/Relationships: Rory/Logan

Summary: Future-fic. When things begin to slip away, what to you do? You return to the beginning and start anew.

<lj-cut text=""She wished for an article of clothing that belonged to him."">

She could hear the birds chirping before she even heard the alarm buzzing from her beside table. She groaned against the intrusion of the bright Monday morning sun in her still sleep hazed eyes as she reached over to turn off her alarm. She knew that she was alone in bed before she even turned her head.

It wasn't a new occurrence, waking up alone, going to bed alone. She spent the majority of her days alone, not including spending time with her friends and her family. 

She and Logan had been married almost three years to the day. He'd promised her when he'd took a job with an opposing company of his father's that he'd make time for her. He had promised her that he would not turn into his father.

He'd broken those promises.

She barely recognized the man that shared her home. It was Logan's face, his eyes, his voice, but it wasn't <i>him</i>, something that shook her to the core. She longed for the prankster, the guy that took her to plays and fell asleep. The one that had made her go on a scavenger hunt before he proposed. 

Forcing herself out of bed, she padded on bare feet to the bathroom. She flipped on the bathroom light, leaning against the doorjamb wishing for an article of clothing that belonged to him, his toothbrush on the bathroom counter, something that was his that gave her a signal that he at least came home. 

Unfortunately, there were none.

She moved to the sink, turning on the faucet to wash her face, but her reflection caught her eye. She stared at the woman in the mirror: unhappy, sad and lonely. This wasn't supposed to be her. She vowed to herself she'd never be one of those women yet now she was.

After a hot shower, Rory made her way downstairs to start her morning. She settled herself on the back patio with a fresh cup of coffee and the morning paper and wasn't surprised when her mother barged in at eight o'clock, screaming, ""I have bagels!""

Rory walked back into the kitchen as Lorelai helped herself to the coffee. ""I don't see Logan. Is he off to work already?""

""Yes,"" she replied as she fell onto a barstool at the counter.

""Things are still rough for the two of you, huh?""

""For them to be rough would entail us talking to one another."" Rory shrugged. ""His job has him so...""

""Don't make excuses for him, Rory. Please. He could make changes if he really wanted to.""

""I know, Mom. I just... and I know I should talk to him about it, but I don't want to be that kind of wife.""

""Honey, you won't be. Tell him that you feel abandoned. Tell him that you miss him. Let him know that you're unhappy. Maybe then he'll realize what he's doing and he'll change it.""

""I will.""

Lorelai gave her daughter a wavering look. ""You swear?""

""I swear.""

Lorelai glanced at her watch. ""Damn. I have to go. Dad is coming to the Inn to survey the damage from the fire.""

""Fire? You didn't tell me there was a fire.""

""I didn't? I'm pretty sure I did.""

Rory shook her head. ""No. You didn't. I would've remembered.""

""Sorry, kiddo. I thought I did. It's no big deal. There wasn't much damage.""

""That's good to hear.""

""I'll see you later, hun."" 

After her mother had made her exit, Rory walked around the house, taking in her surroundings. She wondered if Logan would notice if she'd redecorate. 

As her eyes roamed the walls, thinking of a different color scheme, they stopped, landing on her wedding picture. It was as she stared at the picture that she made up her mind. 

It was time to make a few changes.



It was nearly midnight as Logan made his way up the sidewalk toward his house. He realized as he stepped in front of the door that something was different. Then, he realized that the door was a different color.

He wondered what had possessed Rory to paint the front door. He'd ask her once he was inside. That was if she wasn't asleep. 

Digging into his pants pocket for his keys, he inserted his house key into the lock, turned it to the right and pushed the door open. He set his briefcase beside the door, then pulled off his coat, hanging it on the coat rack beside the door. 

The air was different, he noticed as he made his way throughout the house. 

Empty. 

As he made his way into the living room he saw why. 

There was no living room furniture. All the pictures had been taken from the walls. Boxes were piled in the middle of the floor, clearly marked. 

He walked up to them reading from the labels attached to each: <i>Your Stuff. My Stuff. Our stuff--to be divided accordingly.</i>

Confused, Logan ran upstairs only to find the bed neatly made. He opened up her dresser to find her clothes gone. He received the same result as he opened the closet. 

He backed away from the closet slowly, running his fingers through his hair as he came to the realization that she had left. 

Possibly for good."

""I wish you'd reconsider,"" she whispered, holding onto the handle of his suitcase, refusing to hand it over to him.

""I can't,"" he reminded her. 

They were off to Europe for the summer, leaving her behind. And he hated it. But there was last minute wedding details that she had to be here for. 

If not for that, then she'd be tagging along with them.

Unfortunately her mother needed her. This is where she should be, not tramping across Europe with he and his croonies. 

He took her hand, letting his suitcase drop to the floor with a thud. ""I'll be back for the wedding. I've already told Logan and Finn and they 

understand. I promise that I won't miss it.""

""You swear?""

""I swear.""

""On top of your sweater vests?""

""I swear on top of my sweater vests.""

""On top of your subscription to FHM?""

""I swear on top of my subscription to FHM.""

""On top of your porn stash?""

""I swear on top of my porn...,"" he stopped quickly, smirking. ""Hey! How'd you know about that?""

She just shrugged. ""Don't worry about that.""

He lifted her hands, brushing his lips across her knuckles. ""I promise I will be back here before the wedding.""

She nodded as the last call for his flight came. 

""Come on, Colin, we have to go,"" Logan said, stopping beside them.

""You'll call me when you get to the hotel?"" she asked, keeping her eyes focused on Colin.

""Promise.""

Colin took her into his arms, kissing her long and hard, not enjoying having to say goodbye to her like this. But she had insisted on seeing him off.

""I expect a phone call at least twice a week.""

""I'll see your twice and raise you three times a week.""

""Three sounds better."" Rory hugged him, whispering, ""Have fun.""

Colin grabbed his suitcase and followed his friends toward their gate. As he handed the flight attendant, his boarding pass, he glanced at her, 

watching as she began making her way out of the terminal.



""Can't you drive faster?"" Colin asked the cab driver, tapping his knee in rhythm with the radio.

""I'm going as fast as I can, sir. What's the hurry?""

""I've been in Europe all summer and I promised my girlfriend that I would be back in time for her mother's wedding.""

""What time does the wedding start?""

""A half-hour ago.""

""I wouldn't want to be you,"" the cabbie teased.

""Yeah. That makes two of us.""



""He didn't come?"" Jess asked  as he led Rory around the dance floor.

She shook her head. ""He promised me that he'd be here and he isn't.""

""Maybe he just forgot?""

""Thanks that makes me feel so much better.""

""Hey, well, maybe his plane had some trouble.""

""You're really not helping. STOP!""

""Okay, okay. I give up.""



Colin saw her dancing with Jess out on the dance floor. He was about to make his way toward her when he felt a hand on his arm. ""You're late!"" the 

annoyed bride snapped at him.

""I know,"" he said, averting his eyes from her. Lorelai Gilmore was a force to be reckoned with, something that he'd come to understand after dating 

Rory for so long.

""You're here now. That's all that matters."" She nodded her head to the dance floor. ""Go and save her from Jess.""

""Thank you,"" he says, then makes his way across the dance floor toward the two.

Jealousy doesn't overtake you once as you tap her back, asking, ""May I cut in?""

She turns abruptly doing something that you're not quite ready for: She throws her arms around you, her lips seeking yours as she molds her body 

against yours.

""You made it,"" she whispers once she's pulled back.

""I promised you I would.""

""But you're late.""

""I had to take a later flight.""

""Why?""

Colin smiles. ""I kinda slept through the last one.""

""Somehow that doesn't surprise me,"" she says as the two of you begin to dance. As she leans her head against his shoulder, she says, ""I'm glad 

you're back.""

""That makes two of us. I'm not going on any more European trips if you're not with me.""

""That's one promise that you'd better keep, mister."""

Summary: Post-Let Me Hear Your Bailiakas Ringing Out. Logan breaks up with Rory, leaving Colin to pick her up after her fall.

<lj-cut text=""I guess you could call it a date... unless you'd rather not because then we won't."">

<b>Chapter Two: Moving On</b>

""So how are you?"" Colin asked Rory as he walked her back to her car.

""Better, I think. Thank you, Colin, for the coffee. And your ear. Did I talk too much?""

""No more than usual,"" he teased.

Rory nodded with a smile. She had had fun. Colin was easy to talk to. He listened to her. He joked with her. She could tell him things that she had never been comfortable telling Logan. In three short hours, she had told Colin more about herself, about her childhood than she had ever told Logan. 

That spoke volumes to her about her relationship with Logan.

""Can I ask you a question?""

""Sure.""

""Why don't you have a girlfriend?""

Colin glanced down at his watch, whistling. ""My God, it's eleven already! I should be going.""

""Ha, ha,"" Rory said, grabbing his arm when he turned to walk away. ""You're not getting away that easily. You can tell me. What's the deal?""

Colin shrugged. ""Just never found the right girl, I guess.""

""And if you did?""

""I don't know... I'm only twenty-three. I'm nowhere near ready for marriage.""

""I wasn't talking about marriage,"" Rory said with a roll of her eyes. Why did guys always think you were automatically asking if they were ready to be a husband? Sheesh. ""But what about long term? Are you ready for that?""

""Yes. Of course. We all like to talk big, but we're not all like Logan, you know. At least I'm not. Finn... well, that's an entirely different story.""

Rory laughed. ""Yeah... I always knew you were different.""

Colin leaned against her car. ""Did you?""

""I did. Any girl would be lucky to have you calling her your girlfriend.""

""And you? You tamed Logan Huntzberger. You had him calling you his girlfriend. That could be deemed lucky.""

""Maybe,"" she said with a sigh. ""Can we... not...?""

""Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry.""

""It's no problem. I just... I want to put it behind me.""

""Can you do that?""

""I can surely try."" Rory dug into her purse for her keys. ""I'd love to do this again.""

Colin stared at her dubiously. Did she just ask him out? He wasn't quite sure. ""Yeah, I, um, I'd like that,"" he stammered. <i>Real smooth, McRae</i>.

""I'll call you?""

""Okay.""

Colin moved aside, letting Rory reach the handle of her car door. He held the door open for her, then stood watching as she drove out of the parking lot. After her taillights had disappeared, he turned on his heel and headed back in the direction of his apartment.



Colin was packing, getting ready to go home for Thanksgiving when she called. He smiled when he saw her name on the Caller ID, answering, ""Hey Rory.""

""Colin, hey. Busy?""

""Not really. Just packing.""

""Going home for the holiday.""

""For a few days, at least. I can only put up with my family for so long. You can understand that more than anyone, I bet.""

""You're right. So when will you be back. I was hoping for that coffee.""

""Well, I'll possibly be back here at Yale by the weekend.""

""Just call me and we can get together.""

""I'll do that.""

""I have to be going. Have a nice Thanksgiving.""

""Yeah... you, too,"" he said before she hung up.

The door to his room swung open. ""Hey! You ready?"" Logan asked, watching as Colin hung up his phone. 

""Uh, yeah,"" Colin said, zipping his suitcase closed.

""Who was that?""

""Huh?""

""On the phone. Who were you talking to?""

Colin grabbed his bag, slinging it over his shoulder. ""Just a friend,"" he said, leading Logan out of his room.



""Shirt, shirt,"" Colin muttered to himself as he ran around his apartment searching for the shirt that he had taken out before his shower to wear to his coffee date with Rory.

He stopped short.

<i>Date</i>. Was it a date? They hadn't really clarified it as being that. But was it? Could it be? He needed to sit down. 

Colin just had fallen down onto the leather sofa when there was a knock at the door. ""Uh... just a minute!"" He yelled, grabbing his shirt off the back of the sofa, pulling it over his head as he made his way to the door.

He opened it up to find a smiling Rory, holding a tray of coffees and a white paper bag. ""I brought coffee!"" she said, moving past him inside his apartment.

""Oh... well... I thought we were going out to get coffee,"" he said, closing the door behind her.

""Yeah, we were,"" she said, setting the coffees and her bag of goodies down on the table. ""But I thought we could have coffee and then maybe go out... and... do something.""

Colin feigned speechlessness for a moment. Finally, upon finding his voice, he asked, ""Like a date?""

Rory glanced up at him. ""Yeah. I mean... I guess you could call it a date. Unless, I mean... unless you'd rather not because then we won't, but, yeah, a date it what it would be,"" she stammered.

Colin nodded as she averted her eyes. It was difficult, this situation, he realized. She had just broken up with Logan and obviously wanted to move on, but with him? Did she want to move on with him? Of that he wasn't quite sure. He enjoyed spending time with her, that was a given. He liked her laugh, her smile... he liked everything about her, excluding the fact that she had spent the last six months dating his best friend. That fact never escaped him. 

Yet that simple fact didn't deter him, either. If Logan was dumb enough to let her go, then who was he to pass up his chance? 

He wasn't. 

""I just wanted to clear that up,"" he said pointedly.

""Right. Okay. So now that it's all clear...,"" Rory began, stopping short when Colin abruptly interrupted her.

""So what did you have in mind?"""

Her eyes are questioning now.

She turns around when she hears the click of the door.</p><p>""Logan... hey,"" she greets me with a fake smile.</p><p>""We should probably talk.""</p><p>She shuts down her computer, turning in her chair to face me. ""Yeah... we probably should."" Before I can get one word out, she says, ""You kissed me.""</p><p>Apparently a kiss from me is a death wish. Ah, the romance of it all.</p><p>""Yeah, I did.""</p><p>""Why'd you do that?""</p><p>""You kissed me first.""</p><p>""But I kissed you on the cheek, Logan. As a thank you for coming to my rescue.""</p><p>I play with the zipper on my jacket as she speaks. ""What do you want me to say, Veronica? I'm sorry? Because I'm not."" She's taken aback by my forwardness. ""I wanted to kiss you. I've wanted to kiss you for... a long time. I've thought about it... but the moment was never right and then the other day... the opportunity presented itself so I threw caution to the wind and seized the moment.""</p><p>She pushes herself to her feet and I realize that we're just inches apart. ""What now?""</p><p>She's looking at me with those big eyes of hers so I seize the moment again.</p><p>My arm circles her waist, pulling her against me as my lips attack hers.

""What are we doing?""</p><p>""Well, um...,"" I start to say, but I tamp down the urge to be a smartass.</p><p>""We can't do this, Logan. You're you and I'm me and we can't... we can't,"" she says defiantly.</p><p>""Veronica, it was only a kiss.""</p><p>""It was two kisses, Logan. No wonder you failed freshman algebra.""</p><p>I pull her back to me, surprised that she lets me. She fingers the lapels on my jacket as she says, ""Things are going to change, Logan."" She lifts her eyes to meet. ""Nothing is going to be the same.""</p><p>""I'm aware of that. I was actually counting on it.""</p><p>""Be serious, Logan. I've already been toyed with once this year.""</p><p>""I assure you, Veronica, I'm not toying with you. I wouldn't do that."" I gently tucked her hair behind her ears. ""Not to you.""</p><p>She steps forward, looping her arms around my neck. Her kiss is soft and her lips barely touch mine. ""I'm late,"" she says.</p><p>I watch as she turns to grab her backpack. ""Walk to you to your car?""</p><p>""Sure,"" she says with a smile. ""Who said Logan Echolls wasn't chivalrous.""</p><p>""Hey, I do have a reputation to withhold. Don't go on spreading that around school.""</p><p>""I can see the headline for the paper: LOGAN ECHOLLS - GENTLEMAN?""</p><p>I can't remember the last time I laughed so freely.</p><p>But it felt good.</p><p>We make our way outside to her car in silence. She unlocks it and I pull open the door for her. ""Thank you,"" she says, kissing my cheek before she climbs in behind the steering wheel.</p><p>""So, tomorrow's Friday,"" I say casually.</p><p>""Uh huh... usually it is the day that comes after Thursday.""</p><p>I roll my eyes before saying, ""Maybe we could do something.""</p><p>In true Veronica fashion, she says, ""Maybe,"" as she starts her car.</p><p>I watch as she pulls out of the school parking lot still watching her car as my phone vibrates from my pocket.

Summary: Colin doesn't take lightly to being Rory's second choice.

<lj-cut text=""I'm never ready to let her go. I'm selfish, I admit it."">

<center><i>It's a deep and dangerous thing
But I'll be ready when there's nowhere to run
See I been waiting for the heartache to come</i>
- Crash and Burn, Foreigner</center>

She's always quiet afterwards. I'm never quite sure if it's guilt or just because it's how she is after sex. I've never asked and I doubt I ever will. 

Like clockwork, she kisses the corner of my mouth before she sits up, declaring, ""I have to go."".

""Back to the boyfriend,"" I mutter, sitting up as she slips out of bed. I know that this always comes, however, I'm never ready for it. I'm never ready to let her go. I'm selfish, I admit it. I don't like sharing her with him... or maybe he's sharing her with me. 

She shoots me a glare as she picks up her clothes scattered about the floor. ""Don't call him that.""

""It's what he is.""

She shakes her head. ""You know it's not like that.""

Leaning my head back against the headboard of the bed, I choose to ignore her. 

""It's not,"" I hear her say.

""How long can we keep this up?"" I ask. I cast a glance at her as she clasps her skirt around her hips.

""What do you mean?""

""How long can you keep fucking me and Logan?""

She sighs. ""Colin...,"" she reaches for my hand, but I pull it away. ""You're being ridiculous.""

""I told you that I wanted to be with you and still you go back to him.""

""This is just... it's all really really hard.""

""Because you like us both?""

She nods.

""Because you can't stand to lose one of us?""

She nods again.

""Go back to Logan, Rory. He's the one that you really want to be with.""

""You don't mean that.""

""But I do. I'm tired of being your second choice.""

""You're not second choice.""

I laugh. ""I am, Rory. The only reason that you came to see me was because Logan was off-campus with Trisha Brown.""

Anger flashes in her blue eyes. ""I came here because I wanted to see you."" She circles the bed to the side where I'm laying. She pushes me over, moving into my arms. ""You know that this is part of our arrangement, Colin. I'm not his, he's not mine. I didn't enjoy it in the beginning, but it's how it is."" She entwines her fingers with mine as she says, ""But here... with you... it's mine. I can't explain it. Hell, I don't understand it... all I know is that I don't want to lose you... or this.""

""I don't either, Rory."" She turns to look at me. ""You know how I feel... and I just... you know I disagree with how he treats you. He may be one of my best friends, but if he can't see the good thing that he's got then... then he just doesn't deserve it.""

A smile quirks her lips. ""I have to go,"" she says again.

As she moves to slip out of the bed, I grab her wrist, pulling her on top of me. ""Let me take you out to dinner.""

She's quiet for a few moments as she wrestles with the decision, then she nods. ""Okay."" A beat, then, ""When?""

""Tonight?""

""I'll move some things around, but I have to go,"" she insists. She kisses me then slips back out of the bed.

This time I allow her to go. 

I hear her pause outside the door as she punches numbers on her phone. A few silent seconds tick by then I hear her speaking. ""Logan, it's me... I have to cancel our plans for tonight. Something important has come up...,"" she says.

And I can't help it. I smile."

Everywhere we were, there she was. At first it was attraction purely based on the fact that she was beautiful. She was... really, really beautiful. I could see what Logan saw in her.<br /><br />And then one day I really got a glimpse into who she was.<br /><br />It was after their first argument. I'd found her in the library sipping unceremoniously from a cup of coffee.

""Of course you do, Rory. A lot of people do and really it's okay. I know how I act and how I treat people. I'm not proud of it all of the time, but that's how it is. Blame it on bad breeding, if you will."" <br /><br />""Colin, you're not that bad.""<br /><br />I laugh. ""You're sweet."" <br /><br />""I just wanted to make sure that you were okay. You stormed out of the dorm pretty quick.""<br /><br />She sighs. ""It's just... it's weird getting readjusted. After the summer apart.""<br /><br />I don't know what urges me to do it, but my hand makes it way to her leg and I pat it lightly. ""If it's any consolation, Rory. He thought about you constantly. Talked about you incessantly.""<br /><br />She smiles and my heart flutters. ""Thank you, Colin. You're a good friend. Logan is lucky to have you.""<br /><br />I stand up as Logan walks into the library, his eyes falling upon her. ""I think we should talk,"" he tells her.<br /><br />She nods, then stands. She looks at me, smiles, then takes Logan's outstretched hand and they head for the door. <br /><br />At the door, she pauses, casting a look in my direction. Her blue eyes are dancing as she flashes a smile directed at me. <br /><br />As Logan pulls her through the door, she pulls a piece of my heart with her.<br /><br />And it's official.<br /><br />I'm in trouble.<br /><br />And I'm really okay with that.<"

Pairings: Rory/Colin; Rory/Logan

Summary: Post-Let Me Hear Your Bailiakas Ringing Out. Logan breaks up with Rory, leaving Colin to pick her up after her fall.

<lj-cut text=""How about coffee? Do you want coffee?"">

<b>Chapter One: How It All Started</b>

Logan sat in front of the TV waiting for the clock to reach seven. At seven he'd be in a bar somewhere, flocked by music, friends and insane amounts of alcohol. He won't have to think about the investor's meeting that his father is dragging him to the following morning or the fact that he hasn't talked to his girlfriend in five days.

<i>Five days</i>.

He's never gone that long without talking to her. Even when he was in Europe. He'd always made time to call her. 

Unfortunately the circumstances were different this time. This time he wasn't quite sure where he stood with her. This time he wasn't sure if she'd even take his calls, had he even tried to call.

The knock on the door came at a quarter to seven, way earlier that he'd expected. He flicked off the TV, frowning. They're early? They're never early. 

""What's the deal? You've gotten manners AND a watch?"" he teased as he pulled open the door. Logan's smile faded when his eyes land on <i>her</i>.

""Expecting someone else?""

""Yeah. Colin and Finn actually.""

She nodded her head, waiting for him to invite her and when he doesn't, she shook her and walked past him into the apartment. 

Logan closed the door behind her as she said, ""You never called.""

""I wasn't sure whether to or not.""

""Why?""

""We fought, Rory.""

""We've fought before, Logan and you've always called.""

""It was different this time.""

""Why?""

""Because it was.""

""I need a better answer than that.""

""I don't care what you need,"" he bit back harshly. He doesn't have time for this--for her. And he certainly doesn't want to fight with her. He hated fighting with her. 

""Is this about Jess?"" she asked.

Logan grit his teeth. 

<i>Jess</i>. 

Even though he didn't like the guy, this is neither here nor there. This had nothing to do with him. 

This is about the two of you and yet he's driven to ask the question that's been plaguing his mind since he drove at her grandparents' house and saw her with her ex. 

""Do you love him?"" He asked the question knowing full well just how big of an ass he's being. She's come here of her own free will and he's treating her like she's just <i>someone</i>.

""No,"" she answered quickly. 

""Never?"" For some reason he's not satisfied with her answer.

""No. I'm not sure I ever did... I mean...,"" she stammered.

""You're not sure?"" He twists her words around like she's done with him on so many occassions. 

She shook her head. ""At one point I thought I did, but... it's all ancient history. There's you now.""

""There's me now,"" he repeated. ""That makes me feel so special, Rory."" He walked away from her, moving into the kitchen. He rifles through cabinets, doing anything so he doesn't have to look at her.

He heard her sigh as he pulls open the refrigerator. ""I'm sorry, Logan. I didn't mean...""

He slammed it shut fiercely. ""You didn't mean to blame me for screwing up your life?"" He turned around to face her.

She blinked, but no words came out.

""Because that's what you were doing, wasn't it? I mean, everything's my fault, isn't it?  Us, the internship, the boat accident, quitting Yale... it's all MY fault.""

""No, Logan, it isn't.""

""But it is, Rory. None of this would've ever happened had we not started dating.""

She shook her head as she reached out to him only to have him move out of her grasp, rejecting her. ""The other night ... I didn't mean...""

""I can't do it, Rory. I can't do commitment and I was just fooling myself that I could. I pretended that I could when presented with the thought of losing you.""

""What are you saying?"" she asked, her voice dropped to a whisper.

""That maybe... you were right. That day you came to my room to break things off... we should've ended things there and gone back to just being friends.""

""Friends?"" she echoed. ""We were never friends, Logan. And we can't <i>be</i> friends.""

""We can't be at all, Rory. I'm sorry, but the other night at the pub a lot of ugly truths were revealed. We're not happy with our lives or with each other and I just think that it's time that we stop running from who we are and who we want to be. We can't hide with one another anymore.""

""You're breaking up with me?"" she asked, her voice cracking.

""Yeah. I think I am.""

""I can't believe this,"" she whispered.

As a tear trickled down her cheek, he wanted nothing more than to wipe it away, but kept that impulse in check. A clean break is what he needed, he reminded himself. 

When Colin and Finn breeze through the door a few moments later, their laughs die down when they survey the scene before them. ""Logan, we can come back later if you want to...,"" Colin trailed off, trying to find the best means of action to leave the two of you alone to finish the conversation.

""Not necessary, Colin. Rory and I are finished.""

""Yeah,"" she said, glancing at Colin and Finn. ""We're done."" She glared at Logan, then muttered a goodbye to Colin and Finn before she made her leave.

After she left, Logan is regarded with smacks upside the head from both of his friends. ""What'd you do that for?"" Colin asked as they lead him out of the apartment. ""You're such a jackass, Logan. The first girl to genuinely love you that you genuinely love as well and you kick her to the curb because she threw some ugly realities in your face?""

""I don't need this from you, Colin.""

Colin grabbed Logan's arm to stop him. ""Well, whether you need it or not, here it is: maybe you don't deserve her. Maybe she's better off with Jess,"" Colin said harshly. ""Heck, maybe she's better off with anyone else but you. This could've been the opportunity for you to turn things around, to make things right, but you just blew it. Rory's the kind of girl that you only get one shot with, Logan. And you just kissed yours goodbye."" Colin let out a frustrated sigh. ""You know, I'm not in the mood to go to the bar anymore. You two go on ahead.""

""What the hell's his problem?"" Logan asked Finn as they watched as Colin stalked off down the hallway.

Finn shrugged. ""Maybe he's got the hots for your girl?""

""That's not funny.""



Out in the parking lot, Colin found Rory fumbling with her keys. He watched her as she struggled to put her key in the lock. He shook his head and sighed, then made his way over to her.

""Can I help?""

When she turned teary eyes on him, a part of his heart broke. ""I can't do it,"" she said, dropping her keys. 

""I'm sorry,""  he whispered, bending down to swipe up her keys.

She shrugged. ""I knew it would happen sooner or later. He's <i>Logan</i>.""

""Rory, he...,"" he began to tell her.

She grabbed his hand. ""Don't, Colin. Please? I don't want any excuses.""

He nods. ""Okay? Well, how about coffee? Do you want coffee?""

""Are you buying?""

""Sure.""

""Then, I want coffee."""

"event","Title: Closet Case
Fandom: Gilmore Girls
Rating: PG
Genre: Fluff, Episode Related
Characters: Dean Winchester, Peyton Sawyer
Pairing: Rory/Colin
Disclaimer: I don't own anything.
Summary: Colin helps Rory move.

<lj-cut text=""You like this girl, more than you'd care to admit to anyone..."">
The phone call comes completely out of the blue. A quick voicemail message from Rory begging you to call her back. She needs your help. 

Your interest is automatically piqued.

Logan doesn't say much, but you do know that they aren't on speaking terms.

At first you don't want to call her back, but she sounded desperate.

Besides, she's your friend, too.

When you call her back, she asks you to meet her at her grandparent's house as soon as you can. Instead of attending your last class of the day, you blow it off and you and Finn hop into the car and head to Hartford.

She answers the door, all smiles. However, there's a sadness in her voice that pulls at you. You and Finn exchange a glance, then follow her upstairs without question.

She tells you of the changes that she's making. Moving out and moving on, she says. She looks happier. <i>Considering</i>.

But she never mentions him. Not once.

And you don't ask. You don't like to pry. It's their business and none of yours.

When she sends Finn down to the car with a box, you choose that particular moment to ask her if she's okay. She looks at you with dark, sad eyes and before you know it, her arms are around you.

""It's all messed up,"" she whispers and you note the soft tone of her voice.

Yes, you notice.

You try not to notice, but you do. 

You've tried for a long time to remain obsolete, but she has a pull on you. 

She calls you on your attitude, just as she calls Logan on his. You like this girl, more than you'd care to admit to anyone...

You have a thing for her. That's been obvious for a long time.

This cannot be happening. You cannot have a thing for your best friend's girlfriend. It's like... it's against the code is what it is!

This has got to end.

Her fingernails brush along your back and you're putty in her soft and delicate hands.

When you hear Finn making his way back upstairs singing a Madonna song, she steps back from you, glancing down at her watch. ""I, uh... I have to go. Can you guys finish?""

You nod. ""Sure. No problem.""

You watch as she walks to the desk. She reaches into a drawer pulling out a pen and paper. She scribbles something down then hands you the paper. ""Would you mind delivering everything to this address?""

You mod your head. ""Of course not.""

""Clear out that closet,"" she said, pointing to the left as Finn walks into the room. ""I'll see you at Lane's.""

She walks out with a smile thrown over her shoulder as she exits the room. 

After she's gone, you glance at Finn, asking, ""Which closet did she point to again?"""

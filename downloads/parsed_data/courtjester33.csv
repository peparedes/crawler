"event","Tired today, and I know why.
Ooh, COLs at RVCS were today. I went to David's. Quite intellectually stimulating, if truth be told. I really have to stop underestimating people all the time. It's getting to be annoying when I feel like a jerk afterwards.
E. Snow was there for a fleeting moment. I WISH I had gotten to talk to him, there is much to discuss and I feel like a jerkoff for blowing off going to that movie with him...Ah well. I hope I can make it up to him.
David had a lot to say about religion. I listened, but only because it captured what I had found so hard to say for so many years.
I discovered why I'm feeling depressed: I've lost sight of my personality. Hell, I think it went over the horizon already and is coming around the other side. I've gotten so wrapped up in crap that doesn't matter that I'm barely ME anymore.
Definitely going to have to work on that.

Reading an awesome book called Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment. It's very angsty and emotional, good because I've been looking for something cool to read during Math class. I swear Mrs. Reise is blind, at least partially. It's hilarious because sometimes I hold up last month's homework and say it's today's and she'll believe me without even looking. Very funny.

I need to get to bed before I flop down on the floor to snooze. 'night."

"event","Hi there. I feel like crap. Seriously. I went in late, but only because I had to turn in homework. I should have stayed home, it would have been better than moaning through classes and dealing with some idiots who pretended to sympathize. It actually wasn't that bad, but it FELT like it 'cos I'm really sick. Bleagh...

I left school early. I was going with the other kids to the ropes course in Proj. Adventure (God, I hate that name) and Ms. Peirce showed us the twenty-three tightropes we had to struggle across, and I just thought Oh, bugger this, I'm bailing out of here. So here I am--typing at the very time I would normally get out. Yay. Well, sitting at home is better than sitting in class. I'm glad Mom was able to come and pick me up. It saved me a lot of stress, not to mention pain. I seriously feel like someone yanked out my brain, shook it upside down, and smacked it with a sledgehammer. Cold medicine isn't helping much, so I'm just resting.

Reading some Anthony Horowitz novel. VERY creepy.
By the way, yesterday was my birthday. Yay. Happy birthday to me. I'm fifteen...but there's not a lot of difference. Ah well."

Well, rainy today. Suckage, to quote the phrase. I mean, I don't expect it to be sunny all the time, but I prefer it when it is. Hmm. But variety is also good.

Slept over Eric M.'s the other day, stayed up later than was healthy. I'm feelin' it now, though, and my throat hurts too from talking too much. I mentioned it and Mom started trying to find out whether I was sick or something. That's Mom for ya. She looks out for me even when I would prefer her not to...

Yeah, we played D&D at Morris' house with Sam and Connor. Feel free to call me a nerd. No, really. I truly merit the title, after playing the damn game till midnight...It was actually rather fun. I would describe what happened in the game, but that would probably be viewed as boring AND undeniable proof that I have no life at all.

Yeah, I'm bushed. More later once my brain is back up and running again..."

Today was...entrancing. My life seems better, for some reason I can't fathom. Ah, I bet it's just weekend giddiness setting in...

Hope it stays that way. I'm really goddamn sick of being depressed! I mean it. I mean, what's the point of hating everyone and wanting the world to burn in hell? Completely pointless...yet for some reason I do it anyway. But then again I do a lot of things that are pointless.

Mowed the lawn today. Got money. Yay. Was grueling work under the newly burning sun, though I was glad for the nice weather. I can't believe this world's meteorology sometimes...

Going to see Eric M. tomorrow with the Jabbering One (i.e. Connor) and possibly the Stunted One (Sam M.) to play nerdy games and talk of many things.

Bugger John B. edited my work when I wasn't looking, put all this gay homo stuff and nasty anatomy in it, now he's showing it to every other kid in his grade because he's bored. Stupid bastard. Ah well. Burn them all.
Sorry, just feeling utterly horrendous right now. Rather like Marvin the Paranoid Android, I at the moment weirdly enjoy being totally and utterly miserable and being able to say my life is hell.

I shouldn't even be on here, Mom banned me from the computer but of course being the disobedient piece of crud that I am I decided to jump on here and make an entry. She's probably gonna catch me, look in the History or something, whatever it is she thinks she knows how to do. Or maybe she'll just confront me outright. Hmm. I'll wait and see.

School today was so utterly wretched that I really don't--and yet do--want to talk about it. The thing is, my whining about my personal problems on here is just as pointless as it is self-satisfying, but anyway...

It all got to the max in Computers. I would have flipped out but Burda and Morris are freaking juniors and I would do absolutely nothing. Go figure. I hate being powerless. It's not a pleasant feeling.

Then World Cultures. It was a hellhole. At least for most of the time. I had my head on the desk for a while until that bitch Michelle Bashaw started going in on me, fakely trying to pity me and at the same time laughing as she made joking psychoanalysis quotes to her friend Brian. Little basta...well, I don't like him. I could easily squash his sorry rear, but in an Honors class beating people up is a BAD idea. I hate being stupid. I should have come up with some ridiculously painful comeback to his quips. But I didn't."

(Sorry. Reading Douglas Adams eventually leads to saying things like that.)

Feeling a little down, partly because the rain won't let up and partly because I'm feeling guilty for not searching harder for a meaning to my pitiful existence. Don't why I bother with looking or feeling guilty about not doing so, for both yeild the exact same result: nothing.
I'm getting moody. Another side effect of feeling like a jerk; don't mind it. Plenty of people are actually jerks and couldn't care less whether they are or not, but I have to go and get angsty about it.
Just goes to show.

Anyway, school today would have been great if I wasn't so tired. I really need to work on that insomnia issue. Well it's not really insomnia per se. It's more of an irritating lack of the ability to get my brain to shut up and shut off at the late hours. Most annoying.

We had an assembly about student leadership today, in, of all places, the cafeteria. Why they chose to do this I will never know, but it's a lot less sound-reflecting than the auditorium and so I pleasantly zoned out for most of the principal's ethical and academic blabber. Some kinds stood up at intervals to explain exactly why they wanted to be class officer or whatever, and I silently told most of them to stuff it. Some of them were actually friends of mine, so I made a small attempt to listen but kept either spacing out, nodding off to sleep, or pulling out my book, ""Life, the Universe, and Everything.""

There was a sub in Math. Thank the Good Lord in Heaven, if he's ingratiating enough to read online journals. I was soooo glad I didn't have to look at Mrs. Reise's hideous face and listen to her nasal whine all class. I don't really know why I hate that woman so much. Maybe it's because she's stupid, a crack addict, and a really annoying speaker. Or maybe it's just because she teaches algebra. Either way I was happy.
And I was even happier when I found she had accidently given us the answer key to our classwork packet. I can't wait to see her expression tomorrow when everyone tells her...

Looking forward to the Poetry Night tonight. Which reminds me, I should be writing some poems now for it. I was hoping to bring some optimistic stuff, but my current mood suggests a brand of poetry that is rich with regret, misery, and the utter pointlessness of stupid mistakes that dumb people make. Maybe something angsty, with a hint of suicide, or dark and forbidding, leaving a hanging tone of rather uncomfortable dread.
Well, I'd better hop off and get working..."

"event","Excellent day, considering the atrocious weather. In fact I'm in a disturbingly good mood. It won't last, though. It never does...

Sorry about no weekend updates. I really don't have time to sit down and write with Mom & Dad bustling about. I really don't like having to do this behind their backs (among other things) but I know that, inevitably, if I submit a formal request and ask nicely then they'll just tighten the noose. Seriously, they do have reasons to be paranoid, but I'm just one of billions of Internet users, and no one gives a damn about my existence anyway. No one outside of Massachusetts at least. Now that I mention it it's kinda depressing.

Chris still hasn't seen StarWars III yet. Must hook up with him and go see it sometime. Poor fellow gets little enough attention from anybody these days anyway; I really should try to be a better friend to him.

Got some kind of red bumps on my arm. Could be poison ivy. Whatever it is, it's driving me nuts and making me very, very paranoid. Experiences as a kid with poison oak and ivy aren't helping, and I can only hope it doesn't spread across my face and blemish what's already ugly.

I'm rereading the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and not just because the movie is out. Speaking of the movie, I should talk to Erik about seeing it; we tried to last weekend but my--actually, my parents'--goddam schedule interfered and thoroughly squashed the idea. Anyway, the book is hilarious, and makes me feel better about Life, the Universe and Everything by solemnly claiming the meaning of those things is actually 42.

Nothing much to report, except today academically was awesome. A nasty Great Expectations quiz in the morning through me for a loop, but when I subsequently discovered I skipped math period that day, and had a substitute in Spanish and World Cultures, well, things went pretty damn well.

Poetry night tomorrow at RVCS. I'm definitely gonna be there, maybe read some of my stranger limericks and poems just to make everyone go, ""HUH?"" and then smirk smugly to myself like a self-satisfied literature conniseur. Which I am--or usually make a pretense of being.

"event","Sorry for no update yesterday. I really didn't have a chance to sit down and type at any moment of the day; homework was piling up (and so were social issues.)

There was a whole big confusion going on yesterday over whether or not I was going to be able to see Episode Three (Star Wars) today at 9:00 pm. Of course, such a late departure signifies a very late return--I probably wouldn't have gotten back till midnight, as Mom was very quick to tell me, heheh. Of course then I didn't think it logical, and was on the verge of going on a huge long rant about how I am deprived compared to other kids (only partly true, I may add) and how I've never missed English first peroid because of sleeping in, so why couldn't I do it THIS time...Well, it went on for a while, and an explosion from Dad caused by my resistance seemed about to erupt, when my ugly neck was saved by a call from Connor (I'm going with him to see it.) He was able to negotiate an earlier time, and, well, I really didn't get much opposition against the fairly early hour of five P.M., and yeah...

So now I get to go see it! WOOT! Can't wait. It's actually surprising that this is THE last Star Wars Movie EVER. I mean, really, Star Wars has been around since before I was born! It's been around for as long as I can remember, and I don't really know whether I'll be glad to see the saga go.

Pat was in one of his weird moods today. For half the Programming class he worked diligently hard (I was shocked) and, after finishing his work, spent the next half of class in silence, voicing his opinions by typing them on the computer and then pointing at them for me and Harrison to see. What a whacko.
It was funny, though.

And I have begun to play Dungeons and Dragons. Yes, you may now officially label me a nerd. Or geek. Moron. Whatever you wish to call the people who use their imagination (I'm usually referred to as one of the three when I do.)

Yeah, we're learning about the Holocaust (or we're about to learn about it) in World Cultures. Cue the sarcasm: I can't wait. I mean, this is gonna be nasty. Hitler and Stalin and all those soulless idiots. Really, from their cruelty you can see that they were either mentally ill, stupid, or corrupt beyond all possibility. Or all three.

If I've learned anything in World Cultures this year...it's that the human race has an annoying habit of being really, really stupid.

Gotta love that song.

Getting that irritating ""life-has-no-purpose"" feeling at the moment. Trying to shrug it off, easy due to the many stimulants available in the outside world.
My fourth-quarter grades, I suspect, are slipping. I don't really know whether to care or not--I mean, it's a matter of situational apathy. I got Honors last term but only by a bit. I'm not feeling pressured to work really hard because this is basically the ""home stretch"" before the final bliss of summer vacation. Of course, the annoying desire to impress parents is prevalent, as is a lack of confidence in my own intelligence, which I wish to alter.
Got a 7/10 on the freaking Programming project. Doesn't matter how hard me and Pat worked on it, we still never make a 10/10. But some things, you really can't change.
Programming class was vexing. Charles (the idiot) kept singing random songs, completely out of tune, and in close proximity to me and Pat. I am harboring a strong suspicion that he is either gay or...well...really stupid, and I already know he's an idiot, so maybe it's just that.
Actually, stupidity isn't really the problem. You see, he's a jerk. You can be dumb, and simultaneously be a very nice and kind person, but being a jerk AND being stupid is a combination that often seems to be arranged by an evil, twisted form of Fate.

Just BARELY got out of a late grade on my notebook for Social Studies. I hope I can finish the notes and stuff tonight or I'm toast. I was surprised that Mrs. Koslowski was nice enough to let me turn it in in homeroom time tomorrow. Well, yay. More stress.

English class is as interesting as always. Did I mention the sophomores have MCAS this week? Sucks for them. Anyway, we went out into the ""pizza hut"" building outside instead of our regular main-building classroom, and read Great Expectations there instead. Not much of a change. We're at a part in the book where the main character (a fool, I might add) has hopelessly fallen in love with his old crush whom he was 'friends' with as a kid, and, I am certain, is doomed to a crashing, burning, horrendously painful disappointment in that department. I've been down that road before, Pip Gargery, and I can say it's not a fun one. Can't wait to see how long it is till Estella slaps him. (Yikes, did I express interest in a reading assignment? Must be something in the air at Triton.)

Hoping to see Star Wars sometime later this week, or the week after...gonna be a SWEET movie, no more of the bilge Lucas has been tossing up for the last two. Darkness, death, destruction, and the dominating Dark Side! Woohoo, go bad guys!

I just noticed, I have the odd tendency to root for the villains in many movies. Must be my nature."

Plenty of the day was spent just waiting for the teacher to SHUT UP. Sometimes I just feel like yelling in Spanish, ""NOBODY CARES about the grammatical stem changes for 'Nosotros' substitutional phrases!"" or in Algebra, ""JUST STOP BABBLING; we're never going to USE the multiplication of square roots in our adult lives!""
Apart from that I felt surprisingly well-humored today, an interesting shift from last week's random depression. I'm beginning to wonder if it's some kind of teenage hormonal imbalance that's causing these mood shifts...or maybe I'm just weird. Yeah, that's it.
Weekend updates will be difficult because I'm very busy on the weekend, trying to do my own stuff (recreational activities and such that the restrictions of high school and schedule do not allow.) So probably only on weekdays will I persist in my account.
Yeah, I realized that many of my friends are kind of jerks. I already knew that but decided to investigate it further. Apparently not everyone I thought was a miserable peice of excrement is actually that; some of the guys I know are better people once you get to know them.
The only real problem is I don't always know who to trust. I mean, if you have a secret and you want it kept, who do you tell safely? I mean that kind of thing.
I guess I'll find out...
Hmm, I need to find J.'s phone number."

Oops. Sorry. Exultation at pure, unrestricted freedom is hard to restrain.
Get to spend the weekend mowing. Whoopdefreakingdoo. Should be able to get out of the house more, as Mom and Dad might be out a lot. But there's no guaruntee, as always.

An excellent day today. School was just plain annoying until we went to the goal-meeting reward party thing. Complete with free food and a movie. Those Ignite mentors definitely know how to motivate some kids.
We watched ""The Goonies"". VERY strange movie, but enjoyable, even though it was filmed way back in the 70's or something...some extremely strange music that kid was listening to became deeply disturbing after only a few seconds. Sheesh. Glad to see the world has improved since then.
The flick was cheesy, but I liked it anyway. An odd blend of prepubescent slapstick comedy mixed with profanity, swearing, and no small amount of violence.
Chris and I got to sit in the front row of chairs, and Adam & co. won a ticket to sit on one of the two couches they supplied. Lucky idiots. Oh well. My leg fell into a coma when I stood up afterward, though. Fell asleep or something; pins and needles all over.

Anyway, great day until that bitch Marissa started pissing me off, asking ridiculously detailed questions about my nonexistent personal life for the amusement of her peers. An interesting thing about her and some others is that sometimes they see other humans as nothing more than something funny to laugh at. Of course, with my fumbling to form a comeback every time she subtly dissed me and botching it every single time, they're really not too far off in their perception of me. Which made me rather depressed when I thought of it.

Beautiful weather, though. Couldn't ask for better."

Our Final Exam (which in fact includes no paper at all) was today, and it was actually rather enjoyable, a statement I cannot make about any other P.A. activity, unless there's a substitute teacher in place of Mrs. Pierce.

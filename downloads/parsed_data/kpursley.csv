Your essence is that of<br>the tree or beast that casts you upon the<br>earth.  You feel a purpose to be in balance<br>with the cycles of life and are wise and<br>beautiful in your submission to the justice of<br>Mother Nature.  You are peaceful in nature and,<br>though you feel small, your spirit is precious,<br>strong, and mighty as the (green)forces with<br>which it is affiliated. (please rate my quiz<br>cuz it took me for freaking ever to create)
